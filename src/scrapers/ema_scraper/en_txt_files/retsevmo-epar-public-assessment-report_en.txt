2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant is seeking a Marketing Authorisation for the following indications: 
Treatment of adult patients with: 
– advanced RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who require systemic therapy 
– advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who have progressed 
following prior treatment 
Treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older with advanced RET-mutant medullary thyroid 
cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
Approximately 85% to 90% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and include 3 main 
subtypes: squamous cell, carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell (undifferentiated) carcinoma 
(Perez-Moreno et al. 2012; LCRF 2019). From all NSCLC cases, approximately 1% to 2% are expected 
to harbour a chromosomal rearrangement that produces a rearranged during transfection (RET) gene 
fusion and subsequently an oncogenically activated RET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (Kohno et al. 
2013; Kato et al. 2017; Ferrara et al. 2018).  
In Europe, approximately 500,000 patients developed lung cancer in 2019 (LUCE 2019). Assuming 90% 
of these new cases are NSCLC (450,000), and RET fusions are present in 1% to 2% of European 
descendent NSCLC patients the incidence of new cases of RET-fusion protein lung cancer is expected to 
be around 4,500 to 9,000 per year (ESMO 2019). 
While smoking and exposure to outdoor air pollution are known risk factors for NSCLC, they may not 
predict for RET fusion-positive NSCLC, given that patients with RET fusion-positive lung cancer have 
often been associated with never-smoker status. 
RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) 
Thyroid cancer can be broken down into 4 main types: papillary, follicular, medullary and anaplastic. 
Of these 4, medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare subtype representing about 3% to 5% of all 
thyroid cancers (Accardo et al. 2017). Medullary thyroid cancer is an uncommon malignant tumour 
arising from the calcitonin- producing parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid.  Robust epidemiology 
data specific to MTC are sparse. 
MTC accounts for 5% to 10% of all thyroid cancers, with 70% to 80% occurring as a sporadic entity 
(sMTC) and 25% as familial MTC (fMTC).  Familial MTC can occur as fMTC alone or as part of multiple 
endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) (Figlioli et al. 2013). The majority of MTCs are sporadic, with about 
10% identified as hereditary due to a germline activating mutation in the RET gene. Most sporadic 
MTCs also have activating RET mutations (Figlioli et al. 2013). Medullary thyroid cancer accounts for 
13.4% of all thyroid cancer-related deaths (Figlioli et al.2013).  
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 11/129 
 
 
  
The typical age of presentation of sporadic MTC is in the fifth or sixth decade, with a slight 
preponderance in females.  In contrast, MEN2A and fMTC typically present in the third decade of life, 
and MEN2B usually presents in those younger than age 20 (Roy et al. 2013). At presentation, 35% to 
50% of patients with MTC have regional metastasis, while 13% to 15% have distant metastasis mainly 
to the lung, bone, and liver (Priya et al. 2017). 
In Europe, an estimated 53,000 patients developed thyroid cancer in 2012. Assuming 5% of those 
cases were MTC (2,650), and assuming RET-mutations are present in 60% of MTC patients the 
incidence of new cases of RET-mutant MTC was approximately 1590 per year (ENRC 2019; Roskoski 
and Sadeghi-Nejad 2018).  
MTC is very uncommon in children, but is most commonly associated with one of the multiple 
endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes  
RET-Fusion Positive Thyroid Cancer (TC) 
The thyroid follicle-derived, differentiated cancers (papillary thyroid cancer [PTC] and follicular thyroid 
cancer [FTC]) are the most common thyroid cancers, accounting for 80% to 85% and 10% to 15% of 
all thyroid cancer cases, respectively (Aboelnaga and Ahmed 2015). Poorly differentiated subtypes 
[PDTC] and anaplastic thyroid cancer [ATC]) account for 5% to 10% of thyroid cancers and are 
characterized by less differentiated histologic features and more aggressive clinical behaviour than the 
differentiated subtypes (Landa 2016). 
RET gene fusions have been identified in approximately 6% to 9% of PTCs and approximately 6% of 
PDTCs (Fusco 1987; Agrawal 2013; Cancer Genome Atlas Research 2014; Kato 2017; Landa 2016). In 
contrast to PTC and PDTC, neither FTC nor ATC are frequently associated with RET gene fusions. Most 
differentiated thyroid cancers, including PTC, are largely asymptomatic, treatable tumours with an 
excellent prognosis after surgical resection and radioiodine therapy (Pacini et al., 2012).  
In Europe, an estimated 53,000 patients developed thyroid cancer in 2012.  Assuming 84% of those 
cases were PTC (44,520), and assuming RET- fusion gene alterations are present in 11% of PTC 
patients the incidence of new cases of RET- fusion positive PTC was approximately 4900 per year (ENRC 
2019; Roskoski and Sadeghi-Nejad 2018). 
Although extremely rare, the most common form of thyroid cancer in children is PTC. In addition, 
children with differentiated thyroid cancer have a higher prevalence of gene rearrangements (Segni et 
al. 2017). Thyroid carcinomas occurring in children carry a unique set of clinical, pathologic, and 
molecular characteristics.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Genetic alterations in the RET gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several human 
cancers. RET can become oncogenically activated through two primary mechanisms: 1) chromosomal 
rearrangements that fuse the RET kinase domain with a partner protein dimerisation domain (e.g., 
Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 6 (CCDC6)/papillary thyroid cancer-1 (PTC1), Kinesin Family 
Member 5B (KIF5B), NCOA4/PTC3), producing hybrid proteins that endow the kinase with ligand-
independent, constitutive activity; and 2) point mutations that directly or indirectly activate the kinase 
(Drilon et al. 2018). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis <and stage/prognosis 
RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 12/129 
 
 
  
RET fusion-positive lung cancer is associated with identifiable clinic pathologic characteristics, including 
younger age, never-smoker status, early lymph node metastas poor differentiation, and a 
solid-predominant subtype; RET rearrangement seems to be mutually exclusive with other driver 
mutations (e.g., EGFR, ROS1, KRAS mutations) (Bronte et al. 2019). Patients with RET fusion-positive 
lung cancer commonly have brain metastases at rates similar to the overall NSCLC population, in 
approximately 20-50% patients (Fenske et al. 2017; Drilon et al. 2018). 
Most patients with NSCLC present with advanced stage, unresectable disease, and poor prognosis, with 
5-year survival rates ranging from 10% to < 1% for Stage 4 (Planchard et al. 2018 ;). The symptoms 
associated with advanced NSCLC represent a significant burden to patients, and include dyspnoea, 
cough, fatigue, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and pain (Thompson et al. 2005; ). 
RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) 
The clinical course of MTC is highly heterogeneous, varying from indolent tumours that remain 
unchanged for many years to aggressive cancers associated with high mortality. Medullary thyroid 
cancer can present at late stages and does not respond to thyroid stimulating hormone suppression or 
iodine, conferring reduced survival compared with thyroid cancer overall (Machens et al. 2014). 
MTC may have an intermediate or severe prognosis accounting for a larger proportion of deaths 
attributed to thyroid cancer (Dal Maso et al. 2017). In Europe, the 5-year relative survival for patients 
with MTC was 88% (women) and 85% (men) (Dal Maso et al. 2017). The 10-year OS rate of patients 
with localised disease is approximately 95%, while that of patients with regional stage disease is about 
75%. Only 20% of patients with distant metastases (13% to 15% of the MTC population) at diagnosis 
survive 10 years after diagnosis (Priya et al. 2017). 
In paediatrics, MTC is most frequently associated with a family history of MEN2A, and children typically 
receive the diagnosis in the presymptomatic phase secondary to a family history of a known RET 
mutation transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance (Hanley et al. 2016).  
RET-Fusion Positive Thyroid Cancer (TC) 
The clinical course of RET fusion-positive PTC is heterogeneous, varying from some tumours being 
cured by surgical resection to aggressive cancers associated with metastases and high mortality.  
Recurrent disease is treated with reoperation and/or radioactive iodine therapy. However, these 
treatments are associated with significant morbidity and are often not curative. 
In comparison to adults, children more often present with aggressive, advanced stage disease. This is 
at least in part due to the underlying biologic and molecular differences between paediatric and adult 
thyroid cancer. Specifically, papillary thyroid carcinoma (which accounts for approximately 90% of 
paediatric thyroid cancer) has a high rate of gene fusions (50-60%, compared to approximately 15% 
seen in adults), are associated with more extensive extrathyroidal disease (Starenki and Park 2015).   
The prognosis is favourable for the papillary and follicular subtypes of thyroid cancer, as they are 
slower-growing, indolent and rarely fatal cancers, as evidenced by the high 5-year relative survival in 
the EUROCARE-5 study (greater than 95% in PTC and 87% in follicular thyroid cancer (Dal Maso et al. 
2017). In the US, the 5-year survival rate for metastatic PTC is 78% compared to 99% for localised 
cancer (ASCO 2019).

Although patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC have an identifiable driver mutation, they currently 
receive the same standard-of-care treatment as patients with NSCLC who do not have a driver 
mutation, as there are no RET-specific approved therapies.  
Approved second-line chemotherapy treatments such as docetaxel alone or with ramucirumab, or 
single-agent pemetrexed Immune checkpoint inhibitors in monotherapy such as nivolumab, 
pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab are also used in this setting.  
RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) 
MTC is not sensitive to radioactive iodine and is only curable through surgical resection (Pacini et al. 
2012), but recurrent disease occurs in approximately 50% of patients after resection. (Wells et al. 
2015). Locally recurrent disease is treated with reoperation and/or external beam radiation therapy; 
however, these treatments are associated with significant morbidity and are often not curative. 
Metastatic MTC is managed with resection, radiation, or systemic therapies as noted below, but is 
currently incurable. Children and adolescents with MTC are treated in the same manner as adults, with 
initial thyroidectomy then re-resection, radiation, or systemic therapy with recurrent disease (Starenki 
et al. 2015). 
No systemic agents are approved specifically for patients with advanced RET-mutant MTC, who are 
treated with standard of care for MTC. Two available multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) cabozantinib and 
vandetanib, which have received regulatory approval for advanced MTC, irrespective of the presence 
or absence of a RET mutation.   
RET-Fusion Positive Thyroid Cancer (TC) 
Patients with RET fusion-positive PTC or PDTC receive standard of care for their thyroid cancer 
subtype. Standard treatment options for PTC, include surgery and radioactive iodine (Nguyen et al. 
2015) ). PDTC is less responsive to radioactive iodine than PTC. Paediatric patients with PTC are also 
treated with surgical resection and RAI therapy, although the specifics of RAI are somewhat different in 
this population (Paulson et al. 2019).    
Two available multikinase inhibitors (MKIs), sorafenib and lenvatinib, which are approved for the 
treatment of unresectable, iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, irrespective of the presence 
or absence of a RET mutation.  
About the product 
Selpercatinib Selpercatinib is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the rearranged during 
transfection (RET) receptor tyrosine kinase. Selpercatinib inhibited wild type RET and multiple mutated 
RET isoforms as well as VEGFR1 and VEGFR3.  
The CHMP adopted a positive opinion for use of Retsevmo in the following indications: 
Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with:  
– 
advanced RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who require systemic therapy 
following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy 
– 
advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy following prior 
treatment with sorafenib and/or lenvatinib. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021

Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
with advanced RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy following 
prior treatment with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib. 
Retsevmo therapy should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the use of 
anti-cancer therapies. 
RET testing 
The presence of a RET gene fusion (NSCLC and non-medullary thyroid cancer) or mutation (MTC) 
should be confirmed by a validated test prior to initiation of treatment with Retsevmo. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of Retsevmo based on body weight is: 
- 
Less than 50 kg: 120 mg twice daily. 
-  50 kg or greater: 160 mg twice daily. 
If a patient vomits or misses a dose, the patient should be instructed to take the next dose at its 
scheduled time; an additional dose should not be taken.  
Treatment should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
The current selpercatinib dose should be reduced by 50% if co-administering with a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor. If the CYP3A inhibitor is discontinued, the selpercatinib dose should be increased (after 
3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the inhibitor. 
Dose adjustments 
Management of some adverse reactions may require dose interruption and/or dose reduction.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that: 
- the unmet medical in part of the claimed indications was not established due to the different 
treatment alternatives available for these populations with proven benefit in terms of PFS/OS. 
- whether selpercatinib was able to address any potential UMN could not been concluded. 
The applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The applicant 
recognises the importance of ensuring completion of the Phase 3 studies to confirm the benefit-
risk observed in LIBRETTO-001 and proposes to provide regular updates on the enrolment and 
progress of the studies throughout the review process. 
Planned Phase 3 Studies: 
−  Study J2G-MC-JZJB (LIBRETTO-531) is a global, multicentre, randomised (2:1), open-label, 
Phase 3 study comparing selpercatinib to physician’s choice of cabozantinib or vandetanib in 
patients with progressive, advanced, kinase inhibitor-naive, RET-mutant MTC. Approximately 
400 patients will be enrolled to the study. Endpoints of primary consideration are treatment 
failure-free survival (TFFS) and PFS. Secondary endpoints include ORR, DOR, OS and PFS2. 
TFFS is the primary endpoint and will serve as a gatekeeper to the evaluation of PFS. More 
specifically, PFS is type I error-controlled and will be assessed independently of and after 
assessment of TFFS, and only if TFFS achieves statistical significance. PFS will be the endpoint 
used for regulatory decision making.

Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as the data available demonstrate that selpercatinib 
provides a significant therapeutic benefit to patients with RET alterations. 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the 
fact that additional data are still required. The benefits to public health based on the ability of 
selpercatinib to provide benefit in refractory patients, and a meaningful advance over available 
first-line therapies, represents a major public health interest.

The product is available in a HDPE bottle containing 60 capsules or 120 capsules (80 mg only) as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The chemical name of selpercatinib is 6-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropoxy)-4-(6-(6-((6-methoxypyridin-3-
yl)methyl)-3,6-diazabicyclo[3.1.1]heptan-3-yl)pyridin-3-yl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carbonitrile 
corresponding to the molecular formula C29H31N7O3.  It has a relative molecular mass of 525.61 g/mol 
and the following structure: 
Assessment report

Figure 1. Active substance structure  
The active substance is a slightly hygroscopic powder. Selpercatinib has a pH-dependent solubility 
profile. Solubility is highest in acidic media and decreases as pH increases. The active substance has a 
non-chiral molecular structure.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in general in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances and the ICH guidelines on impurities. The chemical 
structure of selpercatinib active substance was elucidated by a combination of mass spectrometry 
measurements, UV and   infrared (IR) analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis (including 
chemical shift assignments and proton to carbon connectivity assignments), and elemental analysis. 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), 
DSC, dynamic vapor sorption (DVS), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).  
Polymorphism has been observed for the selpercatinib active substance. The selpercatinib active 
substance polymorphic form was identified and found suitable to be used as the commercial active 
substance. The control strategy ensures the correct polymorphic form.  
Selpercatinib is not the subject of a monograph in the Ph. Eur.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Selpercatinib is manufactured from well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. The 
proposed starting materials that are custom synthesised material and introduced in the penultimate 
chemical step of the proposed synthetic route were initially not considered acceptable by CHMP. A 
major objection was raised requesting redefinition of the initially proposed starting materials as 
intermediates and defining the starting materials at an earlier point in the synthesis to ensure that 
enough steps are conducted under GMP to appropriately mitigate risks associated with future changes 
to the starting materials’ synthetic routes, unless sound justification was given to support that the 
proposed control strategy is adequate. In response, the applicant provided additional information and 
an in-depth discussion to confirm that the selection of the proposed starting materials in the proposed 
synthesis for selpercatinib active substance meets the requirements given in ICH Q11 and ICH Q11 
Q&A. Specifications for both starting materials have been revised as requested. The description of the 
analytical methods used and summaries of the validation data have been provided.  
A detailed discussion regarding the specificity of the impurity determining methods for the starting 
materials was submitted. An acceptable explanation, demonstrating the specificity issue noted in the 
HPLC method for the impurities in one of the starting materials is not a cause for concern, was 
provided. Adequate control of these impurities is ensured, in an indirect manner, in a downstream 
step.  Concerning the impurities that show the same retention time, no discussion is provided in the 
response. Nevertheless, the information provided for genesis and fate and the control strategy 
overview for structurally related impurities was deemed sufficient to ensure an acceptable control of 
these impurities.  
Taking into account that the critical steps (i.e. those that impact the active substance impurity profile) 
are included in the selpercatinib manufacturing process, no impurity from two of the starting materials 
persists to the active substance and acceptable specifications are proposed for both materials were 
considered acceptable starting materials. The applicant has confirmed that the starting material 
suppliers use the same route of synthesis.

Initially, CHMP raised concerns about the control strategy for one of the proposed starting materials. In 
response, the applicant addressed the concerns raised. The acceptance limit for an impurity in the 
specifications has been tightened. The capability of the process to purge this impurity, as confirmed in 
the fate and purge studies, and the manufacturing batch history support the proposed acceptance 
limit. A further test for another impurity has been added to the specifications. The limit proposed has 
been properly justified. The description and a validation summary of the analytical methods used for 
the control of the starting material have been submitted and found acceptable.  
Information about the impurities with demonstrated specificity in the impurity determining GC method 
is given. All structurally related impurities potentially present have been included. The suitability of the 
specifications to control batches manufactured by the proposed processes has been adequately 
justified. Analytical data for batches have been provided as requested.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
It was initially stated that no critical process parameters have been determined in the active substance 
manufacturing process (i.e. all process parameters were categorized as non-critical process 
parameters), however the data presented were not sufficient to support this. In addition, proven 
acceptable ranges (PARs) for many of these process parameters were proposed in each step but 
initially they were not adequately justified. In response to questions raised by CHMP additional data 
was submitted by the applicant to support the proposed PARs. In addition, the applicant has clarified 
that any movement within a PAR range will occur only when other parameters are held at their target 
values, consistent with the definitions provided in ICH Q8 guideline on Pharmaceutical Development 
and EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/354895/2017. Considering the studies performed and the clarifications 
provided, the proposed PARs were considered acceptable. The optimized parametric target value/set-
point were defined in the manufacturing process for each step.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development programme. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail. Data 
demonstrating the absence of changes in the polymorphic form of selpercatinib manufactured by 
earlier processes and commercial process were provided. 
The active substance is packaged in LDPE which complies with the European Regulation 10/2011/EC, 
as amended and with Ph. Eur. Section 3.1.3, Polyolefins. Two container closure systems are proposed 
for the active substance. A third one is used in the stability study (LDPE liner (inner primary liner) and 
cable tied. This first liner was then placed into a second LDPE liner and the second liner was cable tied. 
This double LDPE package was then placed inside a mini-HDPE drum with a plastic closure). Data 
demonstrating equivalence of the 3 container closure systems from an active substance stability point 
of view were provided and found acceptable.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for identity (IR), crystal form (XRPD), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (HSGC), description (visual), water content (KF/Ph. Eur.), particle 
size (LLS) and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.). 
Considering the recommendations given in the ICH Q6A and the properties of the active substance, the 
tests included in the active substance specifications are adequate. Impurities present at higher than 
the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and 
appropriate specifications have been set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 19/129 
 
 
  
The absence of control of parameters such as elemental impurities and microbiological control has 
been adequately justified.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance are provided for 4 pilot scale batches for one manufacturer 
and 2 pilot scale batches and 1 production scale batch for the other manufacturer. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from three batches of active substance stored in a container closure system 
representative of that intended for the market for up to 12 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 
60% RH) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
The active substance was packed in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) primary contact liners and placed 
into small high-density polyethylene (HDPE) drums to mimic bulk active substance storage at the time 
of manufacture. These batches were manufactured by a process representative of the commercial 
manufacturing process. In addition, additional supportive stability data were provided.  
Photostability testing results were provided. These data support the stability of the active substance to 
light. Samples of selpercatinib active substance were subjected to stress testing at conditions of heat 
and humidity in alignment with ICH Q1A.  No significant degradation was observed for solid samples 
stressed at 70°C/20% RH and 70°C/75% RH for up to 21 days. These results conclude that 
selpercatinib active substance would be chemically stable when stored at ambient temperature and 
humidity.   
The applicant commits to place on stability three production batches of  selpercatinib active substance 
manufactured  at  commercial  scale.  The  proposed  post-approval  stability  protocol  is  considered 
acceptable. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
The finished product contains 40 mg or 80 mg active substance (selpercatinib) and excipients in hard 
gelatin capsules.  
The 40 mg is a size 2 (6 x 18 mm) gray opaque capsule with black “Lilly”, “3977” and “40 mg” script.  
The 80 mg product is a size 0 (8 x 22 mm) blue opaque capsule with black “Lilly”, “2980” and “80 mg” 
script.  
Both capsules are produced from the same blend formulation. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards with the exception of 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021

excipients iron oxide black and Brilliant Blue FCF that complies with Commission Regulation (EU) No 
231/2012. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. The compatibility of the 
active substance with the excipients has been adequately demonstrated.  
The development of the finished product has been adequately described. Discussion about properties 
of active substance and excipients has been given. No incompatibilities have been identified. The 
influence of particle size and polymorphism of used active substances is discussed.  
The development of the formulation composition is described. Bridging among the clinical and 
commercial presentations is explained. The clinical 40/80 mg formulation is identical to the commercial 
40/80 mg formulation, with the exception of the printing on the commercial capsule. For bridging of 
clinical/commercial 40 mg and 80 mg formulations, based on the formulation similarity, a request of a 
waiver of in vivo bioequivalence demonstration for the 40 mg formulation was submitted. For the 
bridging of 40 mg and 20 mg clinical formulations, it was explained that the 40 mg clinical formulation 
uses the same blend as the 20 mg clinical formulation. The only difference between the two 
formulations is the capsule shell. Comparison of dissolution of 40 mg and 20 mg strength capsules (2 
per vessel) were provided only for JP17 1st fluid (defined in the Japanese Pharmacopeia as pH 1.2 HCl 
with 0.2% NaCl) and pH 4.5 acetate buffer. Similarity of dissolution profile of 40 mg and 20 mg 
strength capsules (2 per vessel) was requested to be demonstrated at pH 6.8 and not only for JP17 1st 
fluid (defined in the Japanese Pharmacopeia as pH 1.2 HCl with 0.2% NaCl ) and pH 4.5 acetate buffer 
(see GL GUIDELINE ON THE INVESTIGATION OF BIOEQUIVALENCE CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ 
Corr **). The applicant further justified the absence of investigation of the similarity of dissolution 
profile of 40 mg and 20 mg strength capsules (2 per vessel) at pH 6.8. Bridging of 20 mg capsules to 
those used in earlier clinical studies was done using PK data (see PK assessment). 
The manufacturing process development was sufficiently well documented. Some Quality-by-Design 
concepts and tools were used in the pharmaceutical development. CQAs are defined for the finished 
product and a Failure Mode Effect & Criticality Analysis (FMECA) is performed as a risk assessment for 
manufacturing process development. The FMECA summary presented is not fully in line with ICH Q9 
(e.g., risk level of each parameter is not described in terms of severity, probability and detectability). 
However, since no regulatory flexibility or design spaces are claimed, it was considered acceptable 
detail.  
A dissolution method has been developed for quality control (QC) during release and stability testing of 
the finished product. An aqueous medium is used and the pH has been evaluated in the physiological 
range (1-7.5). Apparatus 2 (paddles) at 75 rpm are selected for the dissolution method. Since paddle 
apparatus is used in the dissolution method, the stirring speed higher than 50 rpm (75 rpm) was 
requested to be justified. The rationale presented by the applicant supports that a paddle speed of 50 
rpm provides equivalent dissolution behaviour to that of 75 rpm. Discriminatory power has been 
studied on batches with meaningful changes compared to the applied finished product (quantitative 
formulation and slightly modified process parameters). However, since the finished product contains an 
active substance which shows very rapid dissolution, it is not possible to detect any differences in the 
dissolution behaviour after meaningful changes. Hence the finished product specification limit for 
dissolution is set as per Ph. Eur. 2.9.3. 
The primary packaging is a HDPE bottle. The material complies with Commission Regulation (EU) No 
10/2011/EC and Ph. Eur. 3.1.3 Polyolefin.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  six  main  steps:  screening,  blending,  milling,  blending, 
encapsulation and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process / pharmaceutical form. 
Results of process evaluation performed on a total of six batches: three for 40 mg strength and three 
80 mg strength was provided. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) process validation has been conducted for the 40 mg and 80 mg 
strength selpercatinib capsules at the commercial manufacturing site at commercial scale. A total of 
four batches are presented: one for 40 mg strength and three 80 mg strength. Process validation for 
the 40 mg strength is being performed concurrently while the 80 mg was validated prospectively. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: identity 
(HPLC-PDA), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), description (visual), uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph. Eur. / HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur. / HPLC), dye identity (titanium & iron test), Brilliant Blue FCF 
(UC) and microbiological testing (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final  product  release  testing.  The  specifications  comply  with  the  general  requirements  of  ICH  Q6A 
guideline and the Ph. Eur. 
The absence of a test for polymorphic form in the finished product specification was justified based on 
development and PK data. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
As part of the elemental impurities evaluation per ICH Q3D guidance, characterisation testing on 
primary stability finished product batches manufactured was performed using inductively-coupled 
plasma with mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The data showed no Class 1 and Class 2A elemental 
impurities were present at any significant level and were well below (<30%) the ICH Q3D Option 2a 
limits.  These data support that routine testing and specifications for Class 1 and Class 2A elemental 
impurities are not required for the finished product. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. Batch analysis results are also provided for batches used in clinical trials. 
The applicant was requested to provide a risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the product and applying the principles outlined in the notice “Information on 
nitrosamines for marketing authorisation holders (EMA/189634/2019)” at D120. A risk evaluation 
concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been submitted. The 
identified root causes for presence of nitrosamines, listed in the Q&A on Information on nitrosamines

Stability  
Stability studies are currently being conducted on three batches of finished packaged in high density 
polyethylene (HDPE) bottles. These batches were manufactured by a process representative of the 
commercial process. Stability data for three batches of the 40 mg strength and three batches of the 80 
mg strength are available up to 12 months for the long-term conditions of 30°C/65%RH and 
25°C/60% RH and up to 6 months at accelerated storage  
Supportive stability studies are also currently being conducted on batches of 20 mg and 80 mg 
selpercatinib capsules of the same formulation. A common blend is used for the 20 mg and 80 mg 
strengths.  Up to 24 months of stability data are currently available for these batches and six months 
for all batches at the accelerated storage condition. Photostability testing has been performed on a 
single batch of each strength.  
The results show no significant changes or trends on stability are observed. 
In-use stability data were provided. According to EMA Q&A Part 2, storage without the protection of 
the immediate container is considered as a worst-case scenario and can in some instances be used to 
assess the need for an in-use shelf life. Since no relevant change is observed after 3 months of open 
dish storage, no in-use shelf life is necessary. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years without special storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

All pivotal non-clinical safety studies were conducted in compliance with the Principles of Good 
Laboratory Practices (GLP), except the reproductive and developmental toxicity study: effect on 
embryo-foetal development (LOXO-292-TOX-009). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Selpercatinib (LOXO-292) is an ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor of the RET receptor tyrosine 
kinase. Several human malignancies have been identified with aberrant RET kinase activity. In this 
regard, it has been described as a potent oncogene, taking part in initiation and progression in multiple 
carcinomas and disorders, such as RET-mutant medullary thyroid cancer and RET fusion-positive non-
small cell lung cancer. Selpercatinib has been proposed to inhibit both wild-type RET kinase and RET 
activating mutations (A883F, M918T, V804L and V804M). 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro  
In vitro selpercatinib inhibited wild-type RET and multiple mutated RET isoforms as well as VEGFR1 and 
VEGFR3 with IC50 values ranging from 0.92 nM to 67.8 nM. (LOXO-292-PHARM-003, LOXO-292-
PHARM-021; LOXO-292-PHARM-027).

Table 3. Inhibition of Wild-Type RET Kinase and RET Kinase Mutants by Selpercatinib at 1 mM ATP 
Concentration measured by HTRF KinEASE assay 
Selpercatinib maintained significant activity against diverse RET mutations, including germline MTC 
activating mutations (A883F, M918T, S891A) and acquired resistance mutations to vandetanib and 
cabozantinib (V804L, V804M). (LOXO-292-PHARM-003, LOXO-292-PHARM-012, LOXO-292-PHARM-
020; LOXO-292-PHARM-028). 
Table 4. Activity of LOXO-292 on WT and muted RET and other kinases (LOXO-292-PHARM-003) 
In addition, selpercatinib had no significant antiproliferative effects in human cancer cell lines that do 
not express constitutively activated RET. Selpercatinib maintained significant selectivity for RET against 
non-kinase targets when tested in additional binding and cell-based assays. (LOXO-292-PHARM-016)

Figure 2. Selpercatinib selectively inhibits the proliferation of RET-altered cells (LOXO-292-PHARM-016)  
In vivo 
In  mice  implanted  subcutaneously  with  NIH-3T3  cells  engineered  to  express  a  constitutively  active 
KIF5B-RET fusion protein, single oral doses of selpercatinib suppressed RET phosphorylation in tumours 
at single doses of 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg showed near complete inhibition of RET kinase activity (LOXO-
292-PHARM-008).  Selpercatinib  administered  14  days  caused  dose-dependent  inhibition  of  tumour 
growth of KIF5B-RET 3T3 tumours with 62%, 88%, 93% tumour regression when dosed at 10 mg/kg 
BID, 15 mg/kg BID and 30 mg/kg BID, respectively (LOXO-292-PHARM-006). Twice-daily oral dosing of 
selpercatinib  caused  inhibition  of  tumour  growth  in  multiple  RET-dependent  tumour  models  including 
those harbouring a V804M gatekeeper mutation (KIF5B-RET-V804M NIH-3T3 and CR2545 CCDC6-RET-
V804M ) with 16%, 50% and 70% tumour regression when dosed at 10 mg/kg BID, 30 kg/kg BID and 
100  mg/kg  BID,  respectively.  The  100  mg/kg  BID  dosing  schedule  was  not  well  tolerated  as 
demonstrated by a mean body weight loss of 13.2% (LOXO-292-PHARM-007).  
Selpercatinib also inhibited the growth of two different RET-dependent human cancer cell line mouse 
xenograft tumour models (TT human MTC cells harbouring an endogenous RET C634W substitution  
with 20% and 37% at 10 mg/kg BID and 30 mg/kg BID respectively and  with 3% and 16 % in LC-
2/ad human non-small cell lung cancer cells expressing a CCDC6-RET fusion (LOXO-292-PHARM-
004(GLP)). 
In  Females BALB/c Nude mice  implanted  with  CR2518 patient  derived colorectal carcinoma xenograft 
(PDX)  with  a  CCDC6-RET  fusion  protein  with  or  without  a  V804M  gatekeeper  mutation,  selpercatinib 
showed dose dependent inhibition of tumour growth with 108% and 113% tumour growth inhibition at 
doses of 10 mg/kg BID and 30 mg/kg BID, respectively (LOXO-292-PHARM-001(GLP)). In Female mice 
Athymic Nude-Foxn1 implanted with tumour model from CTG-0838 derived from Patient PDX with NSCLC 
that expresses a KIF5B-RET fusion protein orally (3 or 30mg/kg), selpercatinib caused dose-dependent 
inhibition of tumour growth with 82% and 106% tumour growth inhibition at day 25 for the 3 mg/kg BID 
and 30 mg/kg BID groups, respectively (LOXO-292-PHARM-017(GLP)).  
Selpercatinib at orally 30 mg/kg BID inhibited the tumour growth of a RET fusion-positive PDX model 
implanted  directly  into  the  brain  and  demonstrated  a  significantly  prolonged  survival  and  was  well 
tolerated throughout the 84 days of dosing (LOXO-292-PHARM-013).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Selpercatinib was more selective for RET over 98% of 329 non-RET kinases including VEGFR2 (Eurofins 
KinaseProfiler)  tested  in  a  large  in  vitro  kinase  activity  screen.  Among  the  remaining  2%  of  kinases, 
Selpercatinib  inhibited  the  kinase  activities  of  RET,  FLT1  (VEGFR1),  and  FLT4  (VEGFR3),  in  similarly 
executed assays containing 1 mM ATP, with IC50 values of 17.3 nM, 27.7 nM and 11.9 nM, respectively 
(LOXO-292-pharm-003).  
However, in more physiologically relevant cell-based assays, selpercatinib inhibited FLT4 with an IC50 
value of 33 nM, which is ~8-10 fold higher than the IC50 value for RET in cells (3.3 nM - 4 nM). (LOXO-
292-pharm-009)   
A significant inhibition (≥ 50%) was observed for two targets: the 5-HT (serotonin) transporter (70.2% 
inhibition of antagonist radioligand) and a2c(h) (51.7% inhibition of antagonist radioligand). There was 
no other significant inhibitory activity in any of the other assays. (LOXO-292-PHARM-002) 
Safety pharmacology programme 
For CNS and CV, safety pharmacology was investigated in the context of repeated-dose toxicity studies 
in  rat  and  minipig  with  individual  safety  pharmacology  endpoints,  with  additional  dedicated  safety 
pharmacology studies for CV. Respiratory function was investigated in a dedicated study.   
Cardiac function 
The cardiac safety of selpercatinib was evaluated in several in vitro assays, including in vitro assays for 
hERG  activity,  safety  pharmacology  studies  using  conscious  telemetry-instrumented  in  only  males 
minipigs given selpercatinib orally, and by monitoring ECGs in repeated-dose oral toxicity studies 28 and 
91 days in duration in males and females minipigs.  
In Vitro 
Selpercatinib had an IC50 value of 1.1 μM in the GLP hERG assay, which is approximately 7-fold higher 
than the maximum unbound concentration (geometric mean Cmax (unbound) = 153 nM) at the clinical 
dose of 160 mg BID (LOXO-292-SPHARM-003). In ion channel-blocking assays, selpercatinib only block 
hERG with a minimal to no effects on other cardiac channels (LOXO-292-SPHARM-001). 
In vivo 
The dose of 12 mg/kg was selected for the safety pharmacology cardiovascular study based on results 
from the 14-day minipig study in which the 25 mg/kg dose was not tolerated.  
No abnormal ECG waveforms, arrhythmias or quantitative effects on ECG and hemodynamic data 
occurred after single doses up to 12 mg/kg when given orally to conscious telemetry-instrumented 
males minipigs. At this dose, the Cmax corresponded to 909 ng/mL after a single dose which is 
approximately 0.3 times the human geometric mean maximum concentration (Cmax = 2980 ng/mL) at 
the clinical dose of 160 mg BID. (LOXO-292-SPHARM-002) 
In the 28-day males and females minipigs repeated-dose toxicity study, there were no ECG changes at 
doses up to 12 mg/kg which corresponded to a Cmax of 1120 ng/mL on Day 22. (LOXO-292-TOX-002)  
In the 91-day males and females minipigs repeated-dose toxicity study, females given 5 mg/kg/day 
were noted with a slight significant increase in QTc prolongation on Day 88 of the dosing phase. This 
prolongation was approximately 12% and 7 % relative to controls and pre-dose values, respectively. 
The dose of 5 mg/kg/day corresponded to a mean Cmax of 565 ng/mL for females on Day 91 which is

approximately 0.2 times the human geometric mean maximum concentration (Cmax = 2980 ng/mL) at 
the clinical dose of 160 mg BID. (LOXO-292-TOX-012) 
CNS 
The Effects of selpercatinib on the CNS were not evaluated in a dedicated safety pharmacology study 
but as part of the GLP 28-day repeated-dose oral toxicity study in SD rats (LOXO-292-TOX-001). 
Functional observational battery and locomotor activity were conducted during predose, dosing and 
recovery phase.  
On day 23 of dosing-decrease in the incidence of low locomotor activity in arena in the high-dose, a 
decreased Mean forelimb grip strength in males given 75/45 mg/kg/day that was reversible after the 
recovery period and decrease in number of basic movements and X + Y ambulation in high-dose males 
on day 23.The doses were established as the severely toxic doses in 10% of animals (STD10) in the 
GLP 28-day repeated-dose study. 
Respiratory function 
Effects on respiratory function (tidal volume, respiration rate, and minute volume) were also 
investigated in a stand-alone GLP respiratory function study using the head-out plethysmography in 
male SD rats. (LOXO-292-SPHARM-004)  
The single oral gavage dose of up to 45 mg/kg to male Crl:CD(SD) rats caused no general clinical 
observations or effects on respiratory function up to 24 hours post dose. The dose of 45 mg/kg of 
selpercatinib is considered to be the NOEL with respect to respiratory function in the rat.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions study was submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics and metabolism of selpercatinib have been examined through a series of in vitro 
and in vivo studies, including toxicokinetic studies. Selpercatinib has been given orally and 
intravenously to mice, rats, dogs, and minipigs. Oral pharmacokinetics have also been determined in 
the rabbit and monkey. 
In vitro, selpercatinib has a high protein binding in human plasma (97%), in mouse (98%) and in rat 
(97%), with a lower bound in dogs (90%) and minipigs (88%).  
Absorption 
Selpercatinib has a good exposure after oral administration in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey, 
and minipig, and thus demonstrates at least moderate intestinal absorption.  
In rats, there was no difference in bioavailability between solution and suspension formulations. 
Data on the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic properties of selpercatinib were also obtained from the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in the rat (4-, 14-, 28-, and 91-day) and minipig (14-, 28-, and 91-day) 
GLP studies. Sex differences in exposure in rodents was shown in rats studies with generally a greater 
exposure in males but with no difference between repeated doses and single dose across all studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 28/129 
 
 
  
 
Exposure, as assessed by mean Cmax and AUC0-24 values, increased with the increase in dose level in 
all three minipig studies. A small degree of accumulation (approximately 1.5-fold) was noted between 
the first and last day of dosing. 
A pH-dependent solubility of selpercatinib where seen in dogs with a greater exposure when stomach 
pH was acidified with pentagastrin in comparison with a neutralized stomach pH. 
Distribution 
Selpercatinib distributes into tissues with a volume of distribution ranging from 1.62 to 5.36 L/kg in the 
mouse, rat, dog, and minipig.  
Selpercatinib distribute into a large number of tissues with a predominant in meninges and tissues 
containing ocular melanin and integumentary melanin with at last sampling time of 672 hours 
postdose, persisted radioactivity in ocular or pigmented tissues (uveal tract, vitreous humor, eyes, 
pigmented skin and meninges). 
Following a 3-, 100-, or 300-mg/kg oral dose of selpercatinib to male CD-1 mice, the brain/plasma 
ratio of selpercatinib was approximately 0.03, 0.05, and 0.07, respectively. These data suggest limited 
penetration of selpercatinib into the CNS in mice, however pharmacodynamics studies suggest anti-
tumour activity of selpercatinib in the brain of mice. 
In mouse, rat, and human blood, the blood-to-plasma ratios were less than one, suggesting that a 
greater portion of the compound resides in the plasma compartment than in blood cells, whereas the 
blood-to-plasma ratio of selpercatinib in beagle dog was approximately one, suggesting that a similar 
portion of the compound resides in the blood and plasma compartments. 
Metabolism 
Selpercatinib was stable during incubation with human whole blood, but metabolized by microsomal 
fractions and hepatocytes from mice, rats, dogs, minipigs, and humans. 
The predicted Selpercatinib human clearance of 13 and 5 mL/min/kg, based on hepatic microsomes 
and hepatocytes, corresponds to 64% and 25% of liver blood flow, respectively. 
Based on semi-quantitative mass spectrometer ion current, unchanged selpercatinib was the major 
component in plasma of rats, minipigs and human cancer patients. 
Six metabolites were identified in human plasma: two oxidized metabolites (M2 and M5), an O-
desmethyl metabolite (M3), an N-dealkylated metabolite (M4), a secondary di-oxidized metabolite 
(M7), and an O-dealkylated glucuronide conjugate (M6). M2 was determined to be an N-oxide of 
selpercatinib at the N-6 nitrogen of the piperazine moiety, and structure confirmed by lack of 
hydrogen-deuterium exchange, reduction by TiCl3, and co-elution with a synthetic selpercatinib N6-
oxide standard.  
A human study with [14C]-selpercatinib showed that none of the metabolites of selpercatinib 
accounted for more than 10% of total drug-related material in plasma. 
Excretion 
In minipigs given an IV dose of selpercatinib, urine collected through 48 hours after dosing contained 
2.63% of the administered dose.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Selpercatinib was incubated with cloned, expressed human CYP450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 Only CYP3A4 was able to metabolize Selpercatinib. These 
data indicated that CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of Selpercatinib (LOXO-292-DMPK-017). 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 29/129 
 
 
  
Selpercatinib showed some induction of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 at higher concentrations (LOXO-292-
DMPK-018) 
Selpercatinib  showed  weak  inhibition  of  CYP2C8  (IC50  of  3.4  μM)  and  time-dependent  inhibition  of 
CYP3A4 (LOXO-292-DMPK-010).  
In vitro, Selpercatinib inhibits the transporter MATE1 with an IC50 of 0.666 μM (LOXO-292-DMPK-035). 
No other drug transporters were inhibited significantly at a clinically relevant unbound plasma geometric 
mean Cmax of 153 nM.  
Table 5: Inhibition of Drug Transporters by Selpercatinib 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Selpercatinib showed toxicity in both rats and minipigs with large target organs and tissues. Finding 
were in the haemtopoietic system, lymphoid system, gastrointestinal system (tongue in rat only), 
pancreas, skeletal system (epiphyseal growth plate of femur/sternum) and reproductive system. The 
toxic effects noted with selpercatinib share similarities to toxicities described in the literature for multi-
kinase inhibitors with anti-RET activity. 
Selpercatinib did not demonstrate phototoxic potential in the in vitro neutral red uptake assay in 
BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. 
Single dose toxicity 
Acute toxicity data were obtained from two in vivo micronucleus assays in rats.  
A first single dose effect was examined in SD male and female rats with oral single dose of Selpercatinib 
250, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg. A second single dose effect examined in SD male rats given a single 
oral dose of 37.5, 75, 150, 300 or 500 mg/kg of selpercatinib. Toxicity parameters measured were clinical 
signs and body weightsNo mortality occurred at any dose level Piloerection and body weight loss were 
observed in rats given with selpercatinib at ≥ 150 mg/Kg.

At 100 and ≥ 60 mg/kg/day of males and females, respectively hypocellularity of 
bone marrow. Erythroid and myeloid lineage affected. 
The incidence and severity of physeal dysplasia, bone marrow hypocellularity and 
gastric mineralisation were considered adverse at ≥ 30 mg/kg/day (males) and at 
≥ 60 mg/kg/day (females).  
(NOAEL) was considered to be 10 mg/kg/day for males (on Day 14, Cmax: 2720 
ng/mL and AUC(0-t): 32400 hr*ng/mL) and 20 mg/kg/day for females (on Day 
14, Cmax: 4870 ng/mL and AUC(0-t): 12200 hr*ng/mL). 
Based  on  dose,  males  were  more  sensitive  than  females  but  Clinical  signs  at  the 
high dose in both sexes were adverse. Males had lower body weight and high dose 
animals had lower body weight gain; food consumption was  in both sexes. During 
the  recovery  phase,  malocclusion  contributed  to  body  weight  loss,  and  powdered 
meal was fed to high dose animals from Day 9 of recovery. Effects on body weight 
did not fully reverse and were considered adverse. At the high doses, toxicity targets 
included: effects on bone marrow, liver (no microscopic correlate), physis, multiple 
tissues (mineralisation), tongue, pancreas, lung, Brunner’s gland and incisor teeth. 
At  the  high  doses  of  20  mg/kg/day  and  75  mg/kg/day  for  males  and  females, 
respectively,  Selpercatinib-related  clinical  observations  included  non-reversible 
teeth  abnormalities  (malocclusion,  white  incisor  teeth,  and  missing  teeth)  and 
thinning haircoat on the head and/or shoulders.

Selpercatinib-related 
females 
administered  ≥25  mg/kg/day  included  increased  mucification  of  the  vaginal 
epithelium and an altered (unstageable) oestrous cycle. 
 In  the  bone  marrow  (femur  and  sternum),  a  microscopic  finding  of  decreased 
cellularity occurred in males administered 20 mg/kg/day and females administered 
75  mg/kg/day  and  may  have  correlated  with  the  haemtology  finding  of  lower 
reticulocyte count in males administered 20 mg/kg/day. 
Finding in the lung of males administered 20 mg/kg/day and females administered 
75 mg/kg/day was an increased incidence of alveolar macrophage infiltrates. 
At  the  recovery  sacrifice,  testis  and  epididymis  findings  persisted  in  males 
administered ≥7.5 mg/kg/day. Degeneration/atrophy in the testis of recovery males 
administered 20 mg/kg/day was generally more severe than in males affectedd at 
the  terminal  sacrifice  and  correlated  with  macroscopic  findings  of  soft  testis  and 
decreased testis weights in recovery sacrifice males administered that dose level.  
Epididymis  findings  included  luminal  cell  debris  in  males  administered  ≥7.5 
mg/kg/day and reduced luminal sperm in  males administered 20 mg/kg/day. The 
microscopic  findings  in  the  epididymis  of  males  administered  20  mg/kg/day 
correlated with decreased epididymis weight and was considered secondary to the 
testis changes.

animals had recovered. 
In Göttingen Minipigs 
14-day daily repeat dose oral toxicity and toxicokinetic study of selpercatinib in Göttingen minipigs 
(study LOXO-RET-TOX-008, non-GLP) 
The study investigated 3 minipigs per sex/group at the doses of 0, 5, 25 or 65 mg/kg/day for a 
duration of 14 days. Selpercatinib was administered by oral gavage. 
Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical observations, food consumption, and clinical and 
anatomic pathology on selected organs. Blood samples were collected for toxicokinetic evaluations on 
Day 1 and 14. 
Oral  administration  of  65  mg/kg/day  of  Selpercatinib  to  Göttingen  minipigs  was  poorly  tolerated  and 
resulted  in  the  unscheduled  sacrifice  of  all  six  animals  administered  this  dose.  The  most  prominent 
microscopic  findings  included  decreased  cellularity  of  the  bone  marrow,  with  secondary  septicaemia, 
atrophy of the ovary, and epithelial blunting/fusion or atrophy in some segments of the small and large 
intestines.

The study investigated 6 minipigs per sex/group at the doses of 0, 2, 5, 12 mg/kg/day for a duration 
of 28 days followed by 28 days recovery phase. 
Assessment of toxicity was based on mortality, clinical observations, body weights, ophthalmic 
observations, electrocardiographic (ECG) measurements, and clinical and anatomic pathology. 
Selpercatinib was well tolerated when administered to Göttingen Minipigs by oral gavage for 28 days at 
a dose level of 2, 5, or 12 mg/kg/day. No test article-related effects on clinical observations, body weight, 
or food consumption were noted. 
No  selpercatinib-related  effects  were  observed  on  clinical  observations,  body  weight,  ophthalmic 
examinations,  ECG  evaluations,  organ  weights,  or  macroscopic  examinations.  Based  on  the  lack  of 
adverse findings, the dose of 12 mg/kg/day was the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL).  
91-Day Oral Gavage Toxicity in Göttingen Minipigs Followed by a 28-Day Recovery Period (study 
LOXO-292-TOX-012, GLP) 
The study investigated 6 minipigs per sex/group at the doses of 0, 2, 5, 12 mg/kg/day for a duration of 
91 days followed by 28 days recovery phase. Selpercatinib was administered by oral gavage. 
Three males and four females administered 15 mg/kg/day were sacrificed in a moribund condition on 
Day  27  (males)  or  26  (females)  of  the  dosing  phase.  These  unscheduled  sacrifices  were  considered 
selpercatinib-related.  
Animals sacrificed in a moribund condition on Day 26 or 27 had one or more Selpercatinib-related clinical 
pathology changes consistent with an inflammatory response, which involved the gastrointestinal tract, 
physeal changes, dehydration and general debilitation. Changes correlated with microscopic evidence of 
inflammation in the non-glandular mucosa of the stomach and esophagus and increased thickness of the 
physis. 
Selpercatinib-related microscopic findings in unscheduled sacrifice animals administered 15 mg/kg/day 
were not specifically associated with moribund condition: 
-changes in the femur (minimal to marked increased thickness of the physis), 
-testis (slight tubular degeneration/atrophy), epididymis (minimal luminal cellular debris),  
-ovary (marked decrease in numbers of corpora lutea and the presence of corpora luteal cysts), 
-esophagus (minimal to moderate mucosal atrophy, slight mucosal degeneration/necrosis, 
 -neutrophilic inflammation, and/or moderate ulcer/erosion), 
-tongue (minimal to slight mucosal atrophy)). 
A slight increase in QTc prolongation was noted on Day 88 of the dosing phase in females administered 
5 mg/kg/day compared with the time-matched percentage change for the control group and predose 
values (approximately 12% and 7%, respectively). 
Genotoxicity 
Conventional studies of genotoxicity (Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli reverse 
mutation assay, in vitro micronucleus assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow 
micronucleus assay following oral administration to rats) were conducted with selpercatinib. 
Selpercatinib is not genotoxic at therapeutic doses. Selpercatinib did not cause mutations in a bacterial 
mutagenicity assay. In an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats, selpercatinib was positive at 
concentrations >7 times the Cmax at the human dose of 160 mg twice daily. In an in vitro 
Assessment report

micronucleus assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, an equivocal response was observed at a 
concentration approximately 485 times the Cmax at the human dose.  
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The applicant has conducted studies in rats and minipigs to assess the effect of selpercatinib on male 
and female fertility. In the female fertility study (LOXO-292-TOX-023), adverse findings on oestrous 
cycles and embryonic survival were reported at the high dose level of 75 mg/kg inducing exposure 
levels within the clinical range. A reduction in the number of oestrous cycles were already reported in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies but did not impact on mating performance or fertility. However, 
embryolethality was reported with half of the females having 100% nonviable embryos at 75 mg/kg. 
This is in line with the results of the dose-range finding EFD study (increased post implantation loss 
due to increased early resorptions from the low dose of 50 mg/kg/day). Overall, a concern for female 
fertility is confirmed considering notably the findings observed at subclinical exposure levels (0.07 to 
0.3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended human dose) in minipig studies (ovarian atrophy, 
decreased corpora lutea, corpora luteal cysts). In male rats (LOXO-292-TOX-025), germ cell depletion 
and spermatid retention were seen from the low dose of 3 mg/kg/day inducing subclinical exposure to 
the test-article (x0.2 clinical AUC). Decreased testis weight (likely due to germ cell depletion), altered 
sperm parameters (morphology, motility), and epididymal findings were also observed at the high dose 
level of 30 mg/kg/day (x2 clinical AUC).  
In a dose-range finding embryo-foetal development study (LOXO-292-TOX-009) conducted in rats at 
doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day, selpercatinib induced developmental toxicity embryolethality 
(early resorptions) at all dose levels. At 50 mg/kg/day, only 3 foetuses from two litters could be 
evaluated; they were found to be affected by treatment-related and adverse malformations (local 
foetal oedema of neck and thorax, small snout, short tail). Hence, a foetal developmental NOAEL could 
not be determined. Exposure level at the low dose level were in the clinical range (animal-to-human 
exposure ratio of 1.5).  
Toxicokinetic data 
Exposure comparisons in the animals and humans (AUC0-24, Cmax) are shown in Table 35. The total 
plasma  geometric  mean  Cmax  of  2980  ng/mL  and  AUC  of  51600  ng*h/mL  for  selpercatinib  in  adult 
patients  at  steady  state  following  160  mg  BID  (198  mg/m2/day)  was  used  for  exposure  margin 
calculations. 
AUC values at the STD 10 in the rat 28-day study corresponded to approximately 3-5 times the human 
geometric mean AUC at the recommended clinical dose. The HNSTD in the 91-day study in rat was 20 
mg/kg/day (120 mg/m2/day) and 75 mg/kg/day (450 mg/m2/day) for males and females, respectively 
and corresponded to approximately 2 to 3 times the human geometric mean AUC at the recommended 
clinical  dose.  The  NOAEL  for  EFD  in  the  rat  (100  mg/kg/day  or  600  mg/m2/day)  corresponded  to 
approximately 4 times the human geometric mean AUC at the recommended clinical dose. In the 28-
day  study  in  minipig,  the  NOAEL  was  12  mg/kg/day  (420  mg/m2/day)  and  exposure  at  this  dose 
corresponded to approximately 0.4 times the human geometric mean AUC at the recommended clinical 
dose.

In the 91-day study in minipig, the HNSTD and NOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day (175 mg/m2/day) and exposure 
at  this  dose  corresponded  to  approximately  0.2  to  0.3  times the  human  geometric  mean  AUC  at  the 
recommended clinical dose.

Other toxicity studies 
Juvenile studies 
Preliminary, non GLP- compliant studies were conducted in juvenile rats aged 7 days at initiation of 
treatment (a single dose (LOXO-292-TOX-017) and two dose-range finding toxicity studies (LOXO-292-
TOX-019, LOXO-292-TOX-022).

Selpercatinib was not found to be phototoxic in this study. 
However  in  the  distribution  study  on  male  Long  Evans  pigmented  rat,  selpercatinib  shows  a  high

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Selpercatinb inhibits RET, RET fusions, and multiple RET mutants with a good potency and selectivity. 
In vitro selpercatinib inhibited the wild type RET kinases. Certain point mutations in RET or 
chromosomal rearrangements involving in-frame fusions of RET with various partners can result in 
constitutively activated chimeric RET fusion proteins that can act as oncogenic drivers by promoting 
cell proliferation of tumour cell lines. In in vitro and in vivo tumour models, selpercatinib demonstrated 
anti-tumour activity in cells arbouring constitutive activation of RET protein resulting from gene fusions 
and mutations, including CCDC6-RET, KIF5B-RET, RET V804M, and RET M918T. In addition, 
selpercatinib showed anti-tumour activity in mice intracranially implanted with a patient-derived RET 
fusion positive tumour (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
The safety pharmacology studies using conscious telemetry-instrumented animals was only conducted 
in male minipigs. The dose of 12 mg/kg did not show a cardiac toxic effect. However, in the 91-day 
minipig repeated-dose study, females administered the mid dose of 5 mg/kg/day exhibited a slight 
increase in QTc interval of approximately 12% and 7 %, relative to controls and pre dose values, 
respectively. In addition, considering the risk of QT interval prolongation based on clinical experience 
with Selpercatinib and clinical and non-clinical finding with multi-kinase inhibitors with anti-RET activity 
(vandetanib, sunitinib, and lenvatinib), a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Significant inhibition (IC50 ≥ 50%) was observed for the 5-HT transporter (70.2% antagonist 
radioligand) and a2c(h) (51.7% antagonist radioligand). The concentration of 1 μM is approximately 7-
fold higher than the maximum unbound plasma geometric concentration (Cmax(unbound) = 153 nM) 
at the clinical dose of 160 mg BID. No other receptors or enzymes were inhibited ≥ 50% (see section 
5.3 of the SmPC). Dependence to Selpercatinib was considered not likely and therefore dependence 
studies were not considered relevant.  
Selpercatinib was orally bioavailable in the mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey, and minipig, and thus 
demonstrates at least moderate intestinal absorption. The physicochemical properties of selpercatinib, 
along with in vitro data and in vivo data in six preclinical species, suggest that selpercatinib is likely to 
be well absorbed after its oral administration. A pH-dependent solubility of selpercatinib suggest that 
selpercatinib exposure could be lower in patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and other 
antacids; and a reduction in exposure was demonstrated in humans (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).  
Selpercatinib shows a high distribution into tissues containing ocular melanin and integumentary 
melanin and (uveal tract, vitreous humour, eyes, meninges, and pigmented skin). 
The rates of metabolism suggested that selpercatinib will have moderate clearance in humans. Except 
the metabolite M1 (glutathione conjugate), the predominant human metabolites detected in vitro were 
the same detected with rat and/or minipig microsomes and hepatocytes). M2, M3, and M4 and M5 
were present in the plasma of rats and minipigs dosed orally with selpercatinib.  
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 37/129 
 
 
  
Six metabolites were identified in human plasma: two oxidized metabolites (M2 and M5), an O-
desmethyl metabolite (M3), an N-dealkylated metabolite (M4), a secondary di-oxidized metabolite 
(M7), and an O-dealkylated glucuronide conjugate (M6).  
CYP3A4 appeared to contribute significantly to the clearance of Selpercatinib, there was the potential 
for co-administered inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 to affect the PK of Selpercatinib. 
Overall, the pharmacokinetic data for selpercatinib indicate it is well absorbed after oral administration 
and has the appropriate characteristics to enable its pharmacological and toxicological evaluation. 
Repeat-dose studies were conducted in rats and minipigs to characterize toxicity. Target organs of 
toxicity common to the rat and minipig were haemtopoietic system, lymphoid tissues, tongue, 
pancreas, epiphyseal growth plate, and male reproductive tissues. In general, toxicities in these organs 
were reversible; the exception was the testicular toxicity. Reversible toxicity was observed in the 
ovaries and gastrointestinal tract in minipigs only; at high doses, gastrointestinal toxicity caused 
morbidity at exposures in minipigs that were generally lower than exposures determined in humans at 
the recommended dose. In one minipig study, females exhibited a slight, reversible increase in QTc 
prolongation of approximately 12% compared to controls and 7 % compared to pre-dose values. 
Target organs of toxicity observed only in rats were incisor tooth, liver, vagina, lungs, Brunner’s gland, 
and multi-tissue mineralisation associated with hyperphosphatemia. These toxicities only occurring in 
these organs in rats were reversible (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Selpercatinib was considered non genotoxic based on the negative result of GLP bacterial mutation 
assay and the in vitro micronucleus assay in HPBL while in an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats, 
selpercatinib was positive at concentrations >7 times the Cmax at the human dose of 160 mg twice 
daily. As with other RTK inhibitors, the bone marrow is a target organ for selpercatinib. Those findings 
are reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
This  initial  MAA  follows  the  guidance  of  ICH  S9  which  states  that  carcinogenicity  studies  are  not 
scientifically warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced 
cancer. However, as MTC has a high prevalence of RET mutations but is often a slow growing tumour, 
the applicant is recommended to conduct carcinogenicity studies in rats and in RasH2 transgenic mice. 
The live phase of the rat study is expected to complete in May 2023, with a final report available in April 
2024.  The live  phase  of  the  mouse  study  is  expected  to  complete  in  November  of  2021,  with  a  final 
report available in October of 2022. 
The  applicant  has  submitted  studies  in  rats  to  assess  the  effect  of  selpercatinib  on  male  and  female 
fertility. A concern for female fertility is confirmed considering notably the findings observed at subclinical 
exposure levels in minipig studies (ovarian atrophy, decreased corpora  lutea, corpora luteal cysts). In 
male rats, germ cell depletion and spermatid retention were seen from the low dose. Decreased testis 
weight, altered sperm parameters, and epididymal findings were also observed at the high dose level. 
These  results  are  consistent  with  the  non-reversible  testicular  degeneration  reported  at  subclinical 
exposure levels in the repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in rats and minipigs. Fertility of male rats 
was  not  affected  in  the  male  fertility  study.  However,  this  result  does  not  mitigate  the  concerns  for 
human male fertility considering the findings observed at low exposure multiples in the rat and minipigs 
studies.  
In the dose-range finding embryo-foetal development study conducted in rats at doses of 50, 100 and 
200 mg/kg/day, selpercatinib induced developmental toxicity embryolethality (early resorptions) at all 
dose levels. Exposure level at the low dose level were in the clinical range (animal-to-human exposure 
ratio of 1.5). In view of these findings, it is agreed that no additional embryo-foetal developmental 
toxicity study is needed since there is sufficient information to inform on the potential risks for 
humans. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 38/129 
 
 
  
In line with ICH S9 guidance, a pre- and postnatal toxicology study was not conducted and the 
potential effects on fertility were evaluated based on the information available from repeat-dose 
toxicity studies. In males and female rats, these findings were reported at exposure levels either lower 
than or in the range of those reached in patients at the maximal human recommended dose. Overall, 
findings from repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in rats and minipigs suggest that selpercatinib 
may adversely impact on male and female fertility (see sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Juvenile animal studies will be conducted, as part of the EMEA-002544-PIP01-18. 
Based on data from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action, selpercatinib can cause 
foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential have to use 
highly effective contraception during treatment and for at least one week after the last dose of 
selpercatinib. Men with female partners of childbearing potential should use effective contraception 
during treatment and for at least one week after the last dose of selpercatinib (see sections 4.6 and 
5.3 of the SmPC). 
Selpercatinib did not demonstrate phototoxic potential in the in vitro neutral red uptake assay in 
BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. 
No dedicated local tolerance testing was conducted. Given that the intended route of administration is 
the oral route, this is acceptable. The gastrointestinal tract was evaluated in all repeat-dose toxicology 
studies in Sprague-Dawley rats and minipigs. 
Selpercatinib is unlikely to represent a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients. 
A phase II environmental fate and effects assessments is not required according to the EMEA Guideline 
but regarding the PECsw value of Selpercatinib (0.0099 µg/L) which is close to the limit of 0.01 µg/L, in 
case  of  any  extension  in  indication,  this  PECsw  will  be  exceeded  and  complementary  ad  hoc  phase  II 
studies will be required.  The applicant is recommended to submit a Phase II ERA by the end of 2021 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical documentation submitted was considered adequate. The relevant information 
has been reflected in the SmPC (sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6 and 5.3).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
 The MAH is recommended to submit: 
- the results of a 6-month carcinogenicity study in RasH2 transgenic mice 
- the results of a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats 
- the results of a GLP-compliant non-clinical toxicology study in juvenile rats 
- a Phase II ERA to reflect the patient population as reflected in the approved indication

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  clinical  pharmacology  investigations  of  selpercatinib  consisted  of  eight  clinical  studies  in  healthy 
volunteers and two clinical studies  in special  populations with  hepatic dysfunction  (LOXO-RET-18022) 
and renal impairment (LOXO-RET-18023).  
One ongoing clinical Phase 1/2 study is performed in patients with advanced solid tumours, including ret 
fusion-positive solid tumours, medullary thyroid cancer, and other tumours with RET activation (LOXO-
RET-17001, pivotal study) and another ongoing Phase 1/2 study is carried out in paediatric patients with 
advanced solid or primary central nervous system tumours (LOXO-RET-18036) (Table 9).  
Full PK profiling has been performed in healthy volunteers whereas rich and sparse PK sampling were 
performed in patients.  
Only PK data from patients were used to develop a Population PK model and Exposure-response analysis 
as presented in (Table 10).  
Table 10. Modelling and PK/PD Studies 
Bioanalysis 
Throughout the clinical development, a unique HPLC/MS/MS bioanalytical method (TM17-410) was used 
to quantify selpercatinib in human plasma with K2EDTA as anticoagulant in all clinical studies. The method 
was cross-validated and used to quantify selpercatinib in urine samples. The developed method allows 
quantification of selpercatinib over a concentration range of 1 ng/mL (LLoQ) to 1000 µg/mL in serum 
samples and over a range of 5.0 to 5000 ng/mL in urine samples.

Pharmacokinetic analyses 
For single or multiple-dose studies, PK parameters evaluated in plasma include Cmax, Cmax/Dose, Cmin, 
Tmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-12, AUC0-12/Dose, AUC0-24, AUC0-24/Dose, AUC0-∞, AUC%extra, RAUC, T1/2, 
λz, CL/F, and for multiple-dose studies, PK parameters evaluated in urine include Ae, CLr, and fe.  
Standard non-compartmental (model-independent) pharmacokinetic methods were used to calculate PK 
parameters using Phoenix® WinNonlin version 8.1 (Certara, Princeton, NJ). 
Population (Pop) PK, tumour size, survival and PK/PD analyses were performed based on interim data 
collected in the ongoing phase 1/2 study LOXO-RET-17001 in cancer patients. Pop PK and tumour size 
modeling were conducted based on the non-linear mixed effects modeling. 
The  Pop  PK  estimation  was  performed  using  the  first-order  conditional  estimation  with  interaction 
(FOCEI) method implemented in NONMEM 7, version 7.4. NONMEM and R (version 3.4) were used for 
simulations to derive exposure metrics for the subsequent exposure-response analysis.

After single or multiple dose administration of selpercatinib in both healthy subjects and patients with 
advanced malignancies, median Tmax ranged between 2 hours indicating that absorption is rapid.  
After a single dose of 160 mg in healthy volunteers, Cmax ranged from 1650 ng/mL to 2024 ng/mL and 
after multiple dose Cmax,ss ranged from 4082 ng/mL to 4574 ng/mL. In patients after a multiple dose 
of 160 mg BID at C1D1 and C1D8 geometric mean Cmax were 1120 ng/mL and 2980 ng/mL respectively. 
Based on in vitro investigations, LOXO-292 was found to be a substrate of both P-gp and BCRP, and a 
weak inhibitor of P-gp. 
LOXO-292 exhibit a pH dependent aqueous solubility with high solubility in very acidic (0.1 N HCL,) and 
low solubility at higher pH (pH 6.0,). Therefore given the information of the low fraction absorbed, LOXO-
292 can be classified as a BCS class IV compound. 
Absolute bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability of selpercatinib was estimated at around 73.2% (individual subject values 
ranging from 60.2 - 81.5%) following an oral dose of 160 mg selpercatinib capsule formulation (2x80 
mg) in the fasted state and intravenous administration of approximately 9.92 µg (~ 1 µCi) of [14C]-
LOXO-292.  
Relative bioavailability/Bioequivalence 
Two selpercatinib capsule strengths (40 mg and 80 mg) are claimed to be marketed, however only the 
80  mg  strength  was  used  during  the  B/R  pivotal  study  (LOXO-RET-17001)  and  in  all  the  clinical 
pharmacology  studies.  Therefore,  there  is  no  clinical  exposure  data  available  for  the  40  mg  capsule. 
However  the  40-mg  and  80-mg  capsule  formulations,  which  differ  only  in  their  capsule  shell,  are 
expected to perform equivalently in vivo. 
Influence of food 
The food effect on selpercatinib PK was evaluated  in 20  healthy  volunteers (study  LOXO-RET-18015) 
who were administered a single oral dose of 160 mg selpercatinib in the fasted (Period 1) and fed state 
(Period 2). PK results indicated that the geometric mean of selpercatinib Cmax decreased moderately by 
14% and AUC0-inf increased by only 9% after administration of a high-fat breakfast (see Figure 3). The 
geometric mean ratio (90% CI) of Cmax and AUC0-inf were 86.24 (57.27, 129.88) and 108.58 (81.17, 
145.25), respectively. In the fed state, median Tmax was delayed to approximately 4 hours postdose.

The effect of administration of PPI (omeprazole) on selpercatinib PK was also investigated in 20 healthy 
volunteers who were administered multiple QD dose of omeprazole and a single oral dose of 160 mg 
selpercatinib in the fasted (Period 3) and fed state (Period 4). PK results indicated in the fasted state 
that the geometric mean of selpercatinib Cmax decreased highly by 88% and AUC0-inf decreased by 69% 
whereas in the fed state, there were no significant change in PK parameters exposure except for Cmax 
which decreased by 50%.  In  the fasted state,  median  Tmax was delayed to approximately 2.5 hours 
postdose whereas in the fed state Tmax was delayed at 6h postdose. 
These data support that selpercatinib capsules could be administered with or without regards to food.

Distribution 
Based  on  in  vitro  investigations  (LOXO-292-DMPK-012),  selpercatinib  was  found  to  be  highly  bound 
(96.1%) to human plasma proteins, mainly on albumin and to a lesser extent to α1− acid glycoprotein. 
Protein binding was independent of selpercatinib concentration from 0.1 to 20 µM.  
From study LOXO-RET-18022 (hepatic impairment), the unbound fraction was confirmed at 3.89%. 
In the human AME study (LOXO-RET-18016), the blood-to-plasma radioactivity ratios of AUC0-24 was 
determined to be 0.59, respectively, suggesting lack of meaningful distribution of selpercatinib into blood 
cells. Based on in vitro investigation (LOXO-DMPK-013), B/P ratio was estimated at 0.70. 
Following IV dosing, in healthy volunteers the selpercatinib volume of distribution during the terminal 
phase (Vz) or at steady state in plasma was 127 L and 85 L respectively, whereas following oral dosing 
the apparent distribution volume was 307 L. 
Following  oral  dosing  of  selpercatinib  in  patients,  based  on  a  PopPK  analysis,  the  selpercatinib  mean 
(CV%) estimated volume of distribution (Vss/F) was 191 L (69%).

Elimination 
The mass balance study LOXO-RET-18016 was a two part study including both oral and IV administration 
of [14C]-LOXO-292 with a radiolabelled dose (160 mg ~40 µCi) and a microtracer design of the IV dose 
(~ 9.92 µg ~1µCi) administered to 6 healthy volunteers. Results are provided in Table 11. 
Table  11.  Summary  of  Absorption,  Metabolism  and  Excretion  Parameters  of  LOXO-292  in  Study  LOXO-
RET-18016. 
Following oral dosing, the overall recovery of radioactivity in this mass balance study was high (93.5% 
± 1.75%), with 69.3% ± 1.60% of the dose recovered in feces and 23.8% ±2.72% recovered in urine 
(Figure 4). Approximately 14% and 11.5% of [14C]-LOXO-292 was recovered unchanged in feces and 
urine  respectively.  Renal  clearance  was  found  to  be  low  and  estimated  at  0.579  L/h.  this  low  renal 
clearance was also confirmed in patients, estimated at 0.432 L/h (160 mg BID dose, Study LOXO-RET-
17001). Excretion was relatively rapid with most of the administered radioactivity (85%) excreted in 144 
hours.

healthy male 
Following IV dosing, the overall recovery of radioactivity in this mass balance study was high (90.7% ± 
5.8%),  with  60.3%  ±  10.7%  of  the  dose  recovered  in  feces  and  30.2%  ±4.3%  recovered  in  urine. 
Approximately 13.5% of [14C]-LOXO-292 was recovered unchanged in urine. Similarly renal clearance 
was found to be low, estimated at 0.789 L/h. 
LOXO-292  underwent  extensive  metabolism  (Figure  3)  which  involved  the  formation  of  6  oxidized 
metabolites.  O-Demethylation  was  the  main  biotransformative  pathway  to  produce  desmethyl-LOXO-
292  (M3),  followed  by  N-dealkylation  to  produce  N-dealkylated-LOXO-292  (M4).  Two  other  oxidative 
metabolites, oxy-LOXO-292 (M5), which was oxidized on the aliphatic portion of LOXO-292, and LOXO-
292 N-Oxide (M2), were present in minor to trace amounts. Metabolites M5 and M3 underwent further 
oxidation  to  produce  metabolites  carboxy-LOXO-292  (M9)  and  oxy-desmethyl-LOXO-292  (M8), 
respectively,  and  were  only  present  in  feces  in  minor  amounts.  In  plasma  the  parent  compound 
accounted for 86.17 of the total radioactivity with no major metabolite (≥ 10% of total compound-related 
material) were detected. In both urine and faeces more than 98% of the recovered radioactivity was 
identified. None of the metabolites (M2, M3 and M4) have an activity on RET kinase more potent than 
selpercatinib.

Figure  5.  Proposed  biotransformation  pathways  of  LOXO-292  after  a  single  oral  dose  of  [14C]-LOXO-
292 160 mg (~40 µCi) to healthy male 
Based on in vitro investigations using human recombinant CYP enzymes, selpercatinib was found to be 
predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. In addition, selpercatinib showed weak inhibition of CYP2C8, with 
an  IC50  values  of  3.4  μM,  and  weak  time-dependent  inhibition  of  CYP3A4  with  KI  of  9  μM,  kinact  of 
0.013 min-1 (kinact/KI of 0.0014 min-1 μM-1, this turn to R = 1.4, LOXO-292-DMPK-010).  
Across healthy subjects, studies (including DDI studies presented later in the DDI part) following single 
oral dose of 160 mg the geometric mean terminal half-life for selpercatinib was in the range of 20.6 to 
31.2 hours. The mean apparent clearances (CL/F) for selpercatinib in healthy volunteers were estimated 
between 6.58 to 7.89 L/h. In patients after MD of 160 mg BID, CL/F was estimated at 6.2 L/h with a 
calculated half-life of 22 hours, based on the results from the PopPK analysis.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies  
Dose proportionality 
Based on PK data from patients following BID dosing of ascending doses of selpercatinib (Study LOXO-
RET-17001), selpercatinib exposures PK parameters increase with increasing dose at C1D1 and at C1D8 
(Table 12 and Figure 6).  
LOXO-292 exhibits linear to supra-proportional PK in patients from 20 mg QD to 240 mg BID.

Time dependency 
Based on study LOXO-RET-18016 (mass-balance Part 2, Table 11), with a mean estimated half-life of 
31.5 h, in healthy volunteers, steady state is expected to be reached after a week following a multiple 
dose of 160 mg BID of LOXO-292. This is confirmed by both studies LOXO-RET-18017 and LOXO-RET-
18026 performed in healthy volunteers. 
Following 160 mg BID dosing of selpercatinib in patients (Study LOXO-RET-17001), PK sampling at 
Day 8 were considered at steady-state. Estimated half-life was 22h, Geometric mean Racc was 
estimated at 3.43 and AUC0-24h was 51,600 (58%) ng*h/mL (Table 12).

Special populations 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Across studies and using NCA approach, the between-patient variability in selpercatinib was moderate 
to high ranging from 38% to 85.6 % for Cmax, and ranging from 24.4 to 78.5 % for AUCs (variability 
shown as CV %).  
Data from Pop PK analysis showed very high between-patient variability for absorption related 
parameters ka and Dur (CV= 78 and 56%, respectively) and for Vc/F (CV = 69%). A bit lower IIV was 
estimated for CL/F = 49% but remains relatively high. The magnitude of the proportional errors was 
moderate (CV = 28%). 
PK Population analyses 
Additional to formal PK investigations in healthy volunteers, the applicant has performed Pop PK 
analyses in order to describe and identify sources of variability of selpercatinib after repeated 
administration in cancer patients.  
LOXO-RET-17001 
The study is ongoing. Briefly, patients with advanced solid tumours, including RET fusion-positive solid 
tumours, RET-mutant MTC, and other tumours with RET activation, received oral ascending doses of 
selpercatinib ranging from 20 mg once daily (QD) through 240 mg twice daily (BID) during phase 1. 
The dose of 160 mg BID was selected for Phase 2. 
LOXO-292-DMPK-050 
The final dataset included a total of 6379 PK observations from 512 patients, with 6246 non-BLQ and 
133 BLQ PK observations (2.1% <5%). The median number of PK observations per patient was 5, and 
the range was 1 to 68 observations. All BLQ PK observations were excluded from the analysis. 
The majority of patients included in the analysis received the dose 160 mg BID (n= 465, 91%) 
followed by 80 mg BID (n= 57, 11%), 120 mg BID (n=34, 6,6%) and 60 mg BID (n=33, 3,5%). To 
note, due to dose adjustments, some patients received multiple dose levels of selpercatinib during the 
study and are counted more than once. 
The final Pop PK model retained for selpercatinib after oral administration is a 2-compartment 
disposition model with sequential zero (DUR) and first-order absorption (ka), with a linear elimination 
and a combined multiplicative and additive errors model. Inter-individual variability (IIV) terms are 
included on CL/F, Vc/F, ka, and Dur with a correlation between the IIV terms for CL/F and Vc/F. 
A diagram of the final population PK model is presented in Figure 7. Parameter estimates for the final 
population PK model are presented in Table 13.

Table 13. Parameters of the Final Population PK Model  
The magnitude of the proportional errors was moderate (28%) and the additive error was estimated at 
47 ng/L (acceptable when compared to geometric mean steady state Cmax = 2980 ng/L). A large IIV 
was observed for absorption related parameters (CV= 78 and 56% for Ka and Dur, respectively) and 
for Vc/F (CV = 69%). A bit lower IIV was estimated for CL/F = 49% but remains relatively high. 
Two covariates (dose and body weight) were identified as significant parameters of PK variability. 
a) Non-linearity was identified on CL/F, which decreased with increasing dose. This leads to greater-
than-proportional increases in selpercatinib exposure with increasing dose levels. CL/F decreases 
significantly (by around one half) from 8.3 to 4,6 L/hr when dose levels of selpercatinib increases from 
20 to 240 mg. At the proposed clinical dose level of 160 mg BID, the typical value reported for CL/F is 
5.9 L/hr.  
b) BW was included in the final Pop PK model following allometric principles where volume parameters 
increase proportionally to body weight (exponent is 1) and clearance parameters increase slightly less 
than proportionally to body weight (exponent is 0.75). For illustration, CL/F increases by more than 
50% for a BW of 107.08 kg by comparison to the typical value observed with a reference BW of 70 Kg. 
In contrast, CL/F decreases by more than 30% for a BW of 45.9 kg compared to the typical CL/F value 
observed with a reference BW of 70 kg. The same impact was also observed for Vd/F and Vp/F but in a 
lesser degree; the relative change was +40% for a BW of 107.08 kg and -25% for a BW of 45.9 kg 
compared to typical volumes values. 
In general, the population typical values and covariate effects were precisely estimated (low RSE% 
<10%, except for the dose covariate on CL/F where RSE was 24%). Bootstrap results were based on 
954 (95%) runs out of 1000 replicates and are in good concordance with the final parameter 
estimates. Low eta shrinkage was associated with CL/F (2,3%), whereas medium to high eta shrinkage 
was observed for Vc/F and the absorption parameters Ka and DUR (27%, 50% and 50%, respectively).

data, despite some overprediction at times <1 hour postdose, with little impact on predicting steady-
state Cmax and Cmin).

Impaired hepatic function 
A formal dedicated study (LOXO-RET-18022) investigating the effect of various degree of hepatic 
impairment on PKs of selpercatinib was performed. Selpercatinib AUC0-∞ increased by 7% in subjects 
with mild, 32% in subjects with moderate Child Pugh classification. Thus, selpercatinib exposure (AUC) 
in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class A and B) is comparable to 
exposure in healthy subjects when a dose of 160 mg is administered. Selpercatinib AUC0-∞ increased 
by 77% in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class C). 
Impaired renal function 
The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of selpercatinib was evaluated in a renal 
impairment study in subjects with normal renal function, mild, moderate (≥30 and <60 mL/min/1.73 
m2) and severe (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment (LOXO-RET-18023). In subjects with mild 
and moderate renal impairment, the geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-∞ were similar to that of normal 
subjects. For severe renal impairment whereas a prolonged half-life is observed compared to other 
groups and normal subject 33.8h vs 24.8 h, PK parameter exposures (Cmax and AUC0-∞) appear 
similar between severe vs normal renal patients.  
End stage renal disease (eGFR <15 ml/min) and dialysis patients have not been studied. 
Age, sex, Race  
No formal investigations in matched groups with regard to intrinsic factors (age, sex and race) have 
been performed. Age, sex and race have been tested as covariates in the population PK modeling and 
no clinically relevant effect on the PKs of selpercatinib was observed.  
Weight

The effect of weight on the PKs of selpercatinib was investigated in patients based on a Pop PK 
approach. 
Based on the population PK analysis, BW was found to be a significant covariate on Vc/F, Vp/F, CL/F 
and Q/F parameters and therefore was retained in the final Pop PK model. BW was included following 
allometric principles, where volume parameters (Vc/F, Vp/F) increase proportionally to BW (exponent 
is 1.0) and clearance parameters (CL/F and Q/F) increase slightly less than proportionally to BW 
(exponent is 0.75). Indeed, CL/F was found to increase by more than 50% for a BW of 107.08 kg by 
comparison to the typical value of CL/F for patient weighting 70 Kg. In contrast, CL/F decreased by 
more than 30% for a BW of 45.9 kg compared to the typical CL/F value for a BW of 70 kg. The same 
impact was also observed for Vd/F and Vp/F but in a lesser degree; the relative change was +40% for 
a BW of 107.08 kg and -25% for a BW of 45.9 kg compared to typical volumes values for a reference 
BW of 70 Kg. 
Further investigation of the impact of BW on the systemic exposure of selpercatinib at steady state 
indicated clearly that a clinically relevant change (>30%) is observed on AUC0-24h, Cmin Cmax in patients 
with extreme BW (<45.9 and >107.1 kg) compared to a typical patient with median weight of 68 kg. 
Additional data show a significant change of the median AUC and Cmax between patient’s ≤ 50 kg and 
> 50 kg, confirming the influence of BW on exposures endpoints and consequently the need for a dose 
adjustment based on BW. 
Elderly 
The effect of age on the PKs of selpercatinib was investigated in patients based on a Pop PK approach. 
- The mean (±SD) age was 57,6 years (±13,5). The median (min; max) BW was 59 kg (15; 90). 
However, among the 512 patients included in the dataset, the number of elderly subjects included in 
the different subgroups of age: [65 to 74 years], [75 to 84 years] and >85 years old is not known.  
Age (tested as a continuous covariate) was not identified as a relevant covariate influencing PK 
parameters (CL/F, Vc/F, Ka, Dur) of selpercatinib. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required based on 
age. 
Table 14. Clinical pharmacology studies in elderly (> 65 or more) 
Paediatrics 
A study of selpercatinib in paediatric patients (LOXO-RET-18036) is ongoing. However, no PK data are 
yet available from this study. Based on the known clearance pathway of selpercatinib (CYP3A4) and 
CYP3A4 maturation by the age of 6 months, the dose of 92 mg/m2 BID with a maximum dose of 160 
mg BID was considered appropriate for paediatric patients to result in paediatric exposure (AUC) 
similar to that of adult patients in study LOXO-RET-17001. 
Healthy volunteers 
In all Phase 1 studies a 160 mg QD or BID dose or dose up to 720 mg QD with only 1 formulation 
(30% blend capsule of 80 mg) have been investigated. In patients, dose from 20 mg QD and 20 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 51/129 
 
 
  
 
BID to 240 mg BID was investigated with all developed formulations (20 mg capsule unmilled, 10 
mg/20 mg/80 mg 30% blend capsule and liquid formulation).  
The PopPK analysis was developed only with PK data from patients. No comparison of the PK 
parameters between HV and patients have been performed by the applicant.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In silico 
Multiple PBPK models using Symcip platform were developed including models for selpercatinib, the 
CYP3A4 inducers, bosentan, modafinil, and rifampin, and the CYP3A4 inhibitors itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, diltiazem, and fluconazole. They were verified and sensitivity analysis were performed. 
This allowed determination of effects of CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors: for example, CYP3A4 
moderate inducers caused a decrease in the single dose AUC of selpercatinib of 36-47%. CYP3A4 
inhibitors caused an increase in the single dose AUC of selpercatinib of 2.2- to 3.8-fold. 
In vivo  
The PK of selpercatinib appeared to be sensitive to gastric pH under fasted conditions based on the 
concomitant use of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, with a decreased exposure at higher pH. PK 
results indicated in the fasted state that the geometric mean of selpercatinib Cmax decreased highly by 
88% and AUC0-inf decreased by 69% whereas in the fed state, there were no significant change in PK 
parameters exposure except for Cmax which decreased by 50%. Administration of the H2 antagonist 
ranitidine given under fasted conditions had no effect on selpercatinib overall exposure.  
Based on in vitro investigations, selpercatinib was found to be predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. 
An effect of CYP3A4 inhibitor and inducer was shown. 
Therefore, the clinical drug interaction trial (LOXO-RET-18014) was conducted with the strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor (multiple-dose itraconazole) and a strong CYP3A4 inducer (multiple-dose rifampin).  
Multiple-dose steady-state administration of itraconazole resulted in an increase of approximately 
130% and 30% in selpercatinib AUC and Cmax, respectively, compared to selpercatinib alone. 
Multiple-dose steady-state administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) resulted in a decrease 
of approximately 87% and 70% in selpercatinib AUC and Cmax, respectively, compared to 
selpercatinib alone.  
In addition, selpercatinib showed weak inhibition of CYP2C8 in in vitro investigations. These findings 
were therefore studied in two clinical DDI studies LOXO-RET-18017 with midazolam as probe, and 
LOXO-RET-18026 with repaglinide as probe. 
Study LOXO-RET-18017 investigated effect of multiple dose selpercatinib on the single-dose PK of 
midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate. 
Multiple-dose steady-state administration of 160 mg BID selpercatinib resulted in an increase of 
approximately 54% and 39% in midazolam AUC and Cmax, respectively, compared to midazolam 
alone 
Multiple-dose steady-state administration of 160 mg BID selpercatinib resulted in an increase of 
approximately 27% and 6% in 1-hydroxymidazolam AUC and Cmax, respectively, compared to 
midazolam alone  
The increase in exposures to midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam were within the range of ≥ 1.25- to 
< 2-fold; indicating that selpercatinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021

Interactions with repaglinide, a sensitive CYP2C8 substrate, was investigated in study LOXO-RET-
18026. Selpercatinib increased the Cmax and AUC of repaglinide (a substrate of CYP2C8) by 
approximately 188% and 91% respectively. 
The increases in overall exposure (based on AUCs) to repaglinide were within the range of = 2 to < 5-
fold, indicating that selpercatinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8. 
To determine the magnitude of the effect of a P-gp inhibitor on Selpercatinib PK, a clinical drug 
interaction trial with a P-gp inhibitor (LOXO-RET-18014), single-dose rifampin, was conducted. 
Selpercatinib exposure was increased minimally by co-administration of rifampicin (increase of 
approximately 6.5% and 19% in selpercatinib AUC0-24 and Cmax, respectively). 
MATE1 contributes to the renal excretion of creatinine and its inhibition can cause changes in serum 
creatinine. The in vivo inhibition of MATE1 was evaluated by review of the change in serum creatinine 
caused by administration of 160 mg BID Selpercatinib for 10 days to healthy volunteers (LOXO-RET-
18017 and LOXO-RET-18026). Serum creatine increased slightly in all subjects.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of selpercatinib is based on the evidence of non-clinical studies, 
pharmacokinetics and PK/PD modelling, no human mechanistic data have been provided. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Related to primary pharmacology, only PK/PD models were provided with the PD data from LIBRETTO-
001 study. 
In relation to secondary pharmacology, a single-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and positive 
controlled, 4 way crossover study to evaluate the effect of selpercatinib on the QTc interval in healthy 
adult subjects was submitted (LOXO-RET-18032). In 32 healthy subjects, no large change (that is, 
>20 ms) in the QTcF interval was detected at selpercatinib concentrations similar to those observed 
with a therapeutic dosing schedule. 
PK/PD modeling 
A tumour size model was presented as an exploratory model.  
Exposure-response relationships 
Survival analyses (ER-efficacy)  
- A survival model was built to describe the observed efficacy endpoints [Overall Survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS)], with tumour size changes as a predictor. Instead of the Pop PK, 
tumour size and safety exposure-response analyses, this analysis included only data from patients in 
the primary analysis of the ongoing phase 1/2 Study LOXO-RET-17001: n=105 patients with RET 
fusion-positive NSCLC and n=55 patients with RET-mutant. Survival data up to 700 days were 
available. 
- The analysis was performed separately for the two tumour groups (n= 105 patients with RET Fusion 
NSCLC and n= 55 patients with RET Mutant MTC). Possible predictors including age, race, sex, prior 
therapy radiation, prior surgical therapy and tumour shrinkage ≥30% were investigated. Based on the

univariate Kaplan-Meier survival curves, tumour shrinkage was found to be a significant (p-value 
p<0.01) predictor for both OS and PFS for both tumour groups using a parametric survival model. A 
Gompertz model was retained for both OS and PFS RET fusion NSCLC and exponential and log-normal 
distributions were selected for OS and PFS RET Mutant MTC, respectively.

- As for the Pop PK analysis, the safety exposure-response analyses used the same interim data from 
the ongoing phase 1/2 study LOXO-RET-17001. The dataset included n= 512 patients (cut-off date of 
17 June 2019). The analyses examined 4 different adverse events (AEs):  
- Increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT),  
- Increases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
- Hypersensitivity and,  
- hypertension.  
Among 512 patients, it is noteworthy that only 45 (9%), 34 (7%), 5 (1%) and 71 (14%) patients 
developed an increase of ALT, increase of AST, hypersensitivity, and hypertension, respectively. 
- Based on the provided results, none of the predictors (dose, AUCss24h, Cmin, age, race, body weight, 
sex, and tumour group) were statistically significant for the prediction of increase in ALT, increase in 
AST or hypersensitivity AEs. Age was the only predictor of the incidence of hypertension. The reference 
patient in this analysis is 59 years old and has a 13.8% probability of experiencing a hypertension AE. 
A patient 38 years of age (10th quartile of observed data) has an odds ratio (OR) of 0.6 relative to the 
reference patient, and a patient 74 years of age (90th quartile of observed data) has an OR of 1.45 
relative to the reference patient.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  single  HPLC/MS/MS  bioanalytical  method  (TM17-410)  used  to  quantify  selpercatinib  in  human 
plasma  (K2EDTA  as  anticoagulant)  in  all  clinical  studies  appears  to  be  adequate  and  comply  with

(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1).  
Additionally to investigation in formal PK studies, Pop PK, tumour size, survival and PK/PD analyses were 
performed  based  on  interim  data  collected  in  the  ongoing  phase  1/2  study  LOXO-RET-17001.  These 
analyses utilized a dataset available up to the data cut-off date of 17 June 2019. 
During phase I of study LOXO-RET-17001, patients received repeated ascending doses ranging from 
20 mg QD to 240 mg BID. In phase 2 part, the dose of 160 mg BID was selected. Therefore, the 
majority of patients included in the modelling analyses received 160 mg BID dose (n= 465, 91%) 
followed by 80 mg BID (n= 57, 11%), 120 mg BID (n=34, 6,6%) and 60 mg BID (n=33, 3,5%). 
Overall, the final Pop PK model for selpercatinib could be considered adequate to describe observed 
data.  
Body weight affects selpercatinib exposure metrics as higher systemic exposure (AUC0-24h and Cmax) 
was observed in patients with lower body weights. Based on exposure-matching and avoidance of 
excess of adverse events (especially with regards to the concentration dependant QTC prolongation 
risk), and taking into account the relevant range of body weight for both adults and adolescents (≥ 12 
years), it is recommended that patients with a body weight ≤50 kg should start selpercatinib treatment 
with a dose of 120 mg twice daily, while patients >50 kg should start selpercatinib treatment with a 
dose of 160 mg twice daily. 
In a thorough QT study, no large change (that is, >20 ms) in the QTcF interval was detected at 
selpercatinib concentrations similar to those observed with a therapeutic dosing schedule. An 
exposure-response analysis (data not shown) indicated that supra therapeutic concentrations, could 
lead to an increase in QTc > 20 ms (see sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 of the SmPC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 55/129 
 
 
  
Safety exposure-response analyses do not establish clear relationships between the systemic 
exposures of selpercatinib (doses up to 160 mg BID) and the likelihood of occurrence of the 
investigated AEs: increase in ALT, AST, hypersensitivity or hypertension. 
Age (range: 15 years to 90 years) or gender had no clinically meaningful effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of Retsevmo. No dose adjustment is required based on age (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 
of the SmPC). 
Close monitoring of patients with impaired hepatic function is important. Based on submitted data, no 
dose adjustment is required for patients with Child Pugh mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Patients 
with Child Pugh severe hepatic impairment should be dosed with 80 mg selpercatinib twice daily (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
In a clinical pharmacology study using single dose selpercatinib 160 mg, exposure (AUC) was 
unchanged in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment, therefore dose adjustment is 
not necessary in these patients. End stage renal disease (eGFR <15 ml/min) and dialysis patients have 
not been studied.  
Based on limited pharmacokinetic data, the Cmax and AUC was similar in adolescent patients, 12-18 
years of age, and in adults.  
Sepercatinib metabolism is through CYP3A4. Therefore, medicinal products that can influence CYP3A4 
enzyme activity may alter the pharmacokinetics of selpercatinib. If strong CYP3A and/or P-gp 
inhibitors, including, but not limited to, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin, posaconazole and nefazodone, have to be coadministered, the dose of selpercatinib 
should be reduced. 
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers including, but not limited to, carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), should be 
avoided (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Selpercatinib showed inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, therefore coadministration with sensitive 
CYP2C8 substrates (e.g., odiaquine, cerivastatin, enzalutamide, paclitaxel, repaglinide, torasemide, 
sorafenib, rosiglitazone, buprenorphine, selexipag, dasabuvir and monteukast), should be avoided. 
Similarly, concomitant use with sensitive CYP3A4 substrates, (e.g., alfentanil, avanafil, buspirone, 
conivaptan, darifenacin, darunavir, ebastine, lomitapide, lovastatin, midazolam, naloxegol, nisoldipine, 
saquinavir, simvastatin, tipranavir, triazolam, vardenafil), should be avoided. 
Co-administration with multiple daily doses of omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor) decreased 
selpercatinib AUC0-INF and Cmax when selpercatinib was administered fasting. Co-administration with 
multiple daily doses of omeprazole did not significantly change the selpercatinib AUC0-INF and Cmax 
when Retsevmo was administered with food. Selpercatinib must therefore be accompanied by a meal if 
used concomitantly with a proton pump inhibitor. 
Selpercatinib has pH-dependent solubility, with decreased solubility at higher pH and should therefore 
be administered 2 hours before concomitant H2 receptor antagonists (see sections 4.2 and 4.5 of the 
SmPC). 
Selpercatinib inhibits the renal transporter multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1). In vivo 
interactions of selpercatinib with clinically relevant substrates of MATE1, such as creatinine, may occur. 
Selpercatinib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) in 
vitro, however these transporters do not appear to limit the oral absorption of selpercatinib, as its oral 
bioavailability is 73% and its exposure was increased minimally by co-administration of the P-gp 
inhibitor rifampicin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 56/129 
 
 
  
Selpercatinib is an in vitro inhibitor of P-gp and BCRP. Caution should be used when taking a P-gp 
substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, colchicine, saxagliptin). 
The provided safety exposure-response analyses do not establish clear relationships between the 
systemic exposures of selpercatinib (doses up to 160 mg BID) and the likelihood of occurrence of the 
investigated AEs: increase in ALT, AST, hypersensitivity or hypertension. However, it is important to 
note that the incident rates for each AEs were very low (<15%) to be able to highlight relationships.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall,  the  PK/PD  of  selpercatinib  has  been  sufficiently  characterized  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  the 
target patients based on formal phase 1 and 2 studies.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This application is based on a single pivotal study LOXO-RET-17001 (LIBRETTO-001), a multicentre, 
open-label, multicohort, Phase 1/2 study in patients with advanced solid tumours, including RET 
fusion-positive solid tumours (e.g., NSCLC, thyroid, pancreas, colorectal), RET-mutant MTC, and other 
tumours with RET activation (e.g., mutations in other tumour types or other evidence of RET 
activation). 
This study is ongoing and includes two parts: Phase 1 (dose escalation) and Phase 2 (dose expansion); 
the study is currently in Phase 2. The study schematic is provided below.

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
LIBRETTO-001 Study 
Phase 1 - Dose escalation 
Objectives 
The primary objective for the study was to determine the MTD/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 
selpercatinib. 
Secondary objectives included determination of the safety and tolerability of selpercatinib, 
characterisation of the PK properties, and assessment of the anti-tumour activity of selpercatinib by 
determining ORR using RECIST 1.1 or RANO, as appropriate to tumour type. 
Design - Methods 
This phase is a sequential-cohort dose escalation designed to identify the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) through incidence and characterisation of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). The study employs a 
classical 3 + 3 dose escalation design, with 3 or 6 patients enrolled in each dose cohort. The starting 
dose of LOXO-292 in oral capsule form was 20 mg per day (eg, 20 mg QD). The nine prespecified 
LOXO-292 dose levels were 20 mg QD, 20 mg BID, 40 mg BID, 60 mg BID, 80 mg BID, 120 mg BID, 
160 mg BID, 240 mg BID, 200 mg BID. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 58/129 
 
 
  
 
In order to be eligible for the assessment of DLT, each patient in a given cohort must have completed 
safety assessments through Day 28 of Cycle 1 and received at least 75% of the planned total dose in 
Cycle 1 (unless due to toxicity).  The rules for cohort advancement and the definition of the MTD are 
found in the protocol. Dose advancement was overseen by a Safety Review Committee (SRC). The SRC 
also periodically reviewed serious adverse events (SAEs) and other safety-related data throughout the 
conduct of the study. Enrolment in the next dose escalation cohort could begin, with SRC approval: 
• 
If the first 3 patients in the prior dose level cohort had received a minimum of 75% of the 
planned total dose in Cycle 1(unless due to toxicity) and completed safety assessments 
through Cycle 1 Day 28 and none had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT); or 
• 
If 1 of 3 patients within the prior dose level cohort had a DLT, and 3 additional patients had 
been enrolled and none of the additional 3 patients had a DLT (i.e., 1 of 6 patients had a DLT). 
Escalation could proceed through all dose levels or until the SRC and Sponsor determine that a suitable 
dose has been achieved based on available data (safety, PK exposure, clinical activity).   
After completion of the 28-day DLT period in Cycle 1, intrapatient dose escalation was permitted by the 
Sponsor, provided that the patient is tolerating their current dose and the dose level to which the 
patient will be escalated has already been evaluated, has a DLT rate of < 33%, and has been declared 
safe by the SRC. 
During the dose escalation phase, selected cohorts previously declared safe by the SRC may be 
expanded to a total of approximately 15 patients to further investigate the tolerability, PK and 
biological activity of LOXO-292.  These additional patients will have confirmed RET status, and priority 
will be given to patients with RET alterations.  During Phase 1, enrolment of patients to the current 
dose cohort under evaluation will take precedence.  The SRC will continue to monitor the cumulative 
safety data from the cohorts previously declared safe and the current dose cohort under evaluation. 
Patients consented on protocol version 4.0 or earlier could be enrolled in Phase 1 dose expansion 
cohorts based on tumour type and prior exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors with anti-RET activity as 
specified below: 
1.  Cohort 1: RET-fusion NSCLC previously treated with kinase inhibitor(s) with anti-RET activity 
2.  Cohort 2: RET-fusion NSCLC with no prior treatment with kinase inhibitor(s) with anti- RET 
activity 
3.  Cohort 3: RET-mutant MTC previously treated with kinase inhibitor(s) with anti-RET activity 
4.  Cohort 4: RET-mutant MTC with no prior treatment with kinase inhibitor(s) with anti- RET 
activity 
5.  Cohort 5: 
– 
– 
– 
– 
– 
evaluable but nonmeasurable disease 
other tumour type (not NSCLC or MTC) 
other RET gene alteration (excluding synonymous, frameshift, or nonsense mutations) or 
other evidence of increased RET activity

discordant or unknown and not further evaluable 
RET mutation-negative MTC.

This study established 160 mg BID as the recommended Phase 2 dose, with 496 of the 531 enrolled 
patients (93.4%) patients receiving at least one selpercatinib dose of 160 mg BID. There was 1 DLT 
among 439 patients who received 160 mg BID. The SRC determined to initiate enrolment to dose 
expansion (Phase 2) at a dose of 160 mg BID. The recommended Phase 2 dose was selected based on 
a favourable safety profile, PK analyses consistent with level of target engagement as predicted by 
preclinical models, and promising and durable anti-tumour activity at 160 mg BID. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
A Phase 1/2 Study of Oral LOXO-292 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumours, 
Including RET Fusion-Positive Solid Tumours, Medullary Thyroid Cancer and Other 
Tumours with RET Activation (LIBRETTO-001, LOXO-RET-17001) 
Phase 2 - Dose Expansion 
The study is currently ongoing and continuing to enrol up to ~750 patients with advanced solid 
tumours with evidence of a RET gene alteration in tumour and/or blood (e.g., gene fusions and/or 
mutations, excluding synonymous, frame shift, or nonsense mutations).  
Patients were planned to be enrolled to one of 5 Phase 2 cohorts to better characterize the safety and 
efficacy of selpercatinib in patients with specific abnormalities in RET. These cohorts were different 
from the expansion cohorts of the Phase I and defined a larger population; the type of RET alteration, 
the type of disease (solid vs MTC), and the number of previous treatments received were taken into 
account.  
Table 15. Phase 2 Cohorts in LIBRETTO-001 
Phase 2 Cohorts 
Cohort 1  RET fusion-positive solid tumour progressed on or intolerant to ≥ 1 prior standard first-line therapy  
Cohort 2  RET fusion-positive solid tumour without prior standard first-line therapy 
Cohort 3 
RET-mutant MTC progressed on or intolerant to ≥ 1 prior standard first-line cabozantinib and/or 
vandetanib 
Cohort 4 
RET-mutant MTC without prior standard first-line cabozantinib or vandetanib or other kinase 
inhibitors(s) with anti-RET activity 
Cohort 5 
•  Cohorts 1-4 without measurable disease;  
•  MTC not eligible for Cohorts 3 or 4;  
•  MTC syndrome spectrum cancers (e.g., MTC, pheochromocytoma) or poorly differentiated 
thyroid cancers with other RET-alteration/activation (allowed with Sponsor approval); 
•  cfDNA positive for a RET gene alteration not known to be present in a tumour sample. 
For Cohorts 1 through 4, evidence of a RET gene alteration in tumour (i.e., not just blood) as defined 
in Table below, was required (a positive germline test for a RET mutation was acceptable for patients 
with MTC). 
Table 16. Definition of RET Alterations 
Previously reported activating RET gene mutation excluding synonymous, frameshift, or nonsense 
mutations. For MTC, RET gene mutation not known to be activating, negative, or unknown could be

The Phase 2 study structure consisted of screening, the treatment period, SFU, and LTFU. An RP2D of 
160 mg BID was selected by the SRC during Phase 1 of the study. Cycles were 28 days of continuous 
BID dosing. Assessments included periodic radiologic evaluation and ongoing safety assessments. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Main Inclusion Criteria for Phase 1 
1. Patients with a locally advanced or metastatic solid tumour who: 
• have progressed on or are intolerant to standard therapy, or 
• no standard therapy exists, or  
• in the opinion of the Investigator, are not candidates for or would be unlikely to tolerate or derive 
significant clinical benefit from standard therapy, or 
• decline standard therapy. 
2. Prior MKIs with anti-RET activity are allowed.  
3. A RET gene alteration is not required initially. Once adequate PK exposure is achieved, evidence of 
RET gene alteration in tumour and/or blood is required (e.g., gene rearrangement and/or mutation, 
excluding synonymous, frameshift, or nonsense mutations) as identified through molecular assays, as 
performed for clinical evaluation. 
The RET alteration result should be generated from a laboratory with Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA), International Standards (ISO)/IEC, College of American Pathologists (CAP) or 
other similar certification. The Sponsor should be contacted to discuss test results from laboratories 
where such certification is not clearly demonstrated to determine eligibility. 
Notes: 
• During Phase 1, a RET gene alteration is not required initially. The Sponsor’s preclinical data indicates that a 
selpercatinib plasma level of 70 ng/mL is equivalent to the IC50 for RET (corrected for human plasma protein 
binding). Therefore, once a dose level is achieved that: (1) is associated with a DLT rate of < 33%; (2) is deemed 
safe by the SRC; and (3) is associated with a Cmin of > 70 ng/mL at steady state in ≥ 70% of patients in the same 
dosing cohort (e.g., 3/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6 patients, etc.), enrollment to subsequent dose levels during Phase 1 will be 
restricted to patients with: (1) RET fusion-positive solid tumours; (2) MTC; (3) an advanced solid tumour that 
harbors a RET gene alteration (excluding synonymous, frameshift, or nonsense mutations); or (4) with prior 
Sponsor approval, an advanced solid tumour with other evidence of RET activation (refer to Protocol Section 4). 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021

• A positive germline test for a RET mutation is acceptable for patients with MTC. 
• Local testing in a CLIA, ISO/IEC, CAP, or other similar certified laboratory is sufficient. 
• In all cases, an anonymised/redacted Molecular Pathology Report or other report(s) describing tumour RET (and 
other) alteration analysis should be submitted to the Sponsor or designee during/prior to eligibility. 
4. Measurable or non-measurable disease as determined by RECIST 1.1 or RANO as appropriate to 
tumour type. 
5. At least 18 years of age. • For countries and sites where approved, patients as young as 12 years of 
age may be enrolled. 
6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) score of 0, 1, or 2 (age ≥ 16 
years) or Lansky Performance Score (LPS) ≥ 40% (age < 16 years) with no sudden deterioration 2 
weeks prior to the first dose of study treatment. 
7. Life expectancy of at least 3 months. 
8. Archived tumour tissue sample available. 
9. Adequate haemtologic status 
10. Adequate hepatic function. 
11. Adequate renal function. 
Inclusion Criteria for Phase 2 
Inclusion Criteria were the same as for Phase 1, with the following modifications: 
1. 
 Cohorts 1 and 3: failed or intolerant to standard of care.  
-Cohort 1 (RET fusion-positive solid tumour). NSCLC: platinum-based chemotherapy (or other 
chemotherapy if not eligible for platinum) or PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy or both. Thyroid: 
sorafenib and/or lenvatinib, patients must also be radioactive iodine-refractory as appropriate 
-Cohort 3 (RET-mutant MTC). Cabozantinib or vandetanib or both agents2. Cohorts 1-4: 
enrolment will be restricted to patients with evidence of a RET gene alteration in tumour (i.e., 
not just blood). However, a positive germline DNA test for a RET gene mutation is acceptable 
in the absence of tumour tissue testing for patients with MTC.  
2.  Cohorts 1-4: at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1 or RANO, as appropriate 
for tumour type and not previously irradiated (unless PD for the irradiated lesion[s] has been 
radiographically documented).  
3.  Cohort 4: radiographic PD within the previous 14 months. Patients otherwise eligible for cohort 
4 who do not demonstrate radiographic PD within the previous 14 months may be enrolled to 
cohort 5 if a compelling rationale is provided by the investigator and approved by the Sponsor.  
Main Exclusion Criteria for Phase 1 and Phase 2 
1. Phase 2 Cohorts 1 through 4: an additional validated oncogenic driver that could cause resistance to 
selpercatinib treatment.  
2. Prior treatment with a selective RET inhibitor(s). 
3. Radiotherapy with a limited field of radiation for palliation within 1 week of the first dose of study 
treatment, with the exception of patients receiving radiation to more than 30% of the bone marrow or 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 62/129 
 
 
  
with a wide field of radiation, which must be completed at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study 
treatment. 
4. Symptomatic primary CNS tumour, metastases, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, or untreated spinal 
cord compression. Exception: Patients are eligible if neurological symptoms and CNS imaging are 
stable and steroid dose is stable for 14 days prior to the first dose of selpercatinib and no CNS surgery 
or radiation has been performed for 28 days, 14 days if stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). 
Note: During the Phase 2 portion of the study, all prior local treatments for CNS disease (e.g., surgery, whole brain 
radiation, SRS), the start and stop dates for each prior local therapy, the specific lesions treated (if SRS and/or 
surgery), whether the patient developed intracranial progression after the last prior local treatment, and which 
lesions progressed since completion of the local therapy must be documented. 
5. Clinically significant active cardiovascular disease or history of myocardial infarction within 6 months 
prior to planned start of selpercatinib or prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate using 
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) interval > 470 msec on at least 2/3 consecutive electrocardiograms (ECGs) 
and mean QTcF > 470 msec on all 3 ECGs during Screening. Correction of suspected drug-induced 
QTcF prolongation may be attempted at the Investigator’s discretion if clinically safe to do so. 
6. Uncontrolled symptomatic hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. 
7. Uncontrolled symptomatic hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia. 
8. Current treatment with certain strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. 
9. Current treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Note: Treatment with PPIs must be stopped 1 or 
more weeks prior to the first dose of selpercatinib. 
Treatments 
There were two study periods: 
• 
Dose Escalation Phase (Phase 1): Patients receive selpercatinib dose levels that ranged from 
20 mg QD to 240 mg BID. 
• 
Dose Expansion Phase (Phase 2): Patients received selpercatinib 160 mg BID. 
Individual patients continued selpercatinib dosing until PD, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for 
treatment discontinuation. Patients with PD could continue selpercatinib if, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, the patient was deriving clinical benefit from continuing study treatment, and 
continuation of treatment was approved by the Sponsor. 
Throughout the conduct of the selpercatinib clinical development programme, investigational product 
was available in capsule form with selpercatinib simple blend or in powder and a solution form (liquid 
suspension). 
Dosing followed a fixed milligram format (as opposed to weight-based or BSA-based). Dosing for an 
individual was to be at a consistent time each day and BID dosing was to be separated by 
approximately 12 hours; a minimum time period of 6 hours was required between consecutive doses. 
Doses that were late by more than 6 hours were to be skipped and recorded in the dosing diary as 
missed.  
Through Protocol v7.0, patients were not to consume food for at least 2 hours before and for at least 1 
hour after the dose of selpercatinib; after the data cut-off date, the protocol was amended to note that 
selpercatinib could be given with or without food based on a food effect study in healthy volunteers 
indicating that the effect of food on selpercatinib bioavailability was minimal.

Objectives 
The primary objective of Phase 2 was to assess, for each Phase 2 expansion cohort, the antitumour 
activity of LOXO-292 by determining ORR using RECIST 1.1 or RANO, as appropriate for the tumour 
type. 
Secondary objectives of Phase 2 included other efficacy parameters, as best change in tumour size 
from baseline, duration of response (DOR), central nervous system (CNS) ORR, CNS DOR, time to any 
and best response, and clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival 
(OS). Determination of the safety and tolerability of selpercatinib, and characterisation of the PK 
properties were also included. 
Exploratory objectives included determination of the relationship between PK and drug effects 
(including efficacy and safety), evaluations of serum tumour markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 
and calcitonin (medullary thyroid cancer [MTC]), thyroglobulin (for patients with non-MTC thyroid 
cancer), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)/cortisol (for patients with Cushing’s disease related 
to their cancer), before, during, and at the end of treatment with selpercatinib. Additional exploratory 
objectives include characterisation of RET gene fusions and mutations and concurrently activated 
oncogenic pathways by molecular assays, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) from tumour 
biopsies and circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) data 
to explore disease-related symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  
Objective response rate (ORR) by IRC assessment. ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with 
BOR of confirmed CR or confirmed PR based on RECIST v1.1. BOR was defined as the best response 
designation for each patient recorded between the date of the first dose of selpercatinib and the data 
cut-off of 17 June 2019, or the date of documented disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or the date of 
subsequent therapy or cancer-related surgery.  
Secondary endpoints: 
- ORR based on investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1;  
- Time to response (TTR);  
- Time to best response (TTBR); 
- Duration of response (DOR);  
- Clinical benefit rate (CBR), calculated as the proportion of patients reaching CR, PR, or stable disease 
lasting 16 or more weeks; 
- Progression-free survival (PFS); 
- Overall survival (OS);  
- CNS ORR and CNS DOR. 
IRC assessment provided the principal data for all analysis sets, while investigator assessments were 
considered supportive data for all analysis sets.

Sample size 
Phase 2: 
For Cohort 1 (patients with RET fusion-positive solid tumours who progressed on or were intolerant to 
standard first-line therapy for their cancers), a true ORR of ≥ 50% was hypothesised when 
selpercatinib was administered to patients with such malignancies. A sample size of 55 patients was 
estimated to provide 85% power to achieve a lower boundary of a two-sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence interval (CI) about the estimated ORR that exceeds 30%. Ruling out a lower limit of 30% 
was considered clinically meaningful and consistent with the estimated response rates seen with 
approved targeted therapies in molecularly defined patient populations who have failed prior therapies 
(e.g., osimertinib, crizotinib, alectinib, and others). 
For Cohort 2 (patients with RET fusion-positive solid tumours without prior standard first-line therapy), 
a true ORR of ≥ 55% was hypothesised when selpercatinib was administered to such patients. A 
sample size of 59 patients was estimated to provide 85% power to achieve a lower boundary of a two-
sided 95% exact binomial CI about the estimated ORR that exceeds 35%. 
For Cohort 3 (patients with RET-mutant MTC who progressed on or were intolerant to vandetanib 
and/or cabozantinib), a true ORR of ≥ 35% was hypothesised when selpercatinib was administered to 
such patients. A sample size of 83 patients was estimated to provide 85% power to achieve a lower 
boundary of a two-sided 95% exact binomial CI about the estimated ORR that exceeds 20%. Ruling 
out a lower limit of 20% was considered clinically meaningful in patients who have failed prior MKI 
therapy (e.g., cabozantinib) and currently have limited treatment options for their advancing disease. 
For Cohort 4 (patients with RET-mutant MTC who are MKI-naïve), a true ORR of ≥ 50% was 
hypothesised when selpercatinib was administered to such patients. A sample size of 55 patients was 
estimated to provide 85% power to achieve a lower boundary of a two-sided 95% exact binomial CI 
about the estimated ORR that exceeds 30%. 
Notwithstanding the statistical considerations above, if approved by the Safety Review Committee 
(SRC), enrolment beyond the above sample sizes in each of Cohorts 1 through 5, was allowed, in order 
to accommodate enrolment demand and allow for the characterisation of AEs that may occur with low 
frequency. With a sample size of 150 patients, the probability of observing one or more instances of a 
specific AE within a cohort with a true incidence rate of 1% and 2% was 77.9% and 95.2%, 
respectively. Up to ~150 patients in Cohort 1 would be allowed to accommodate enrolment of other 
RET fusion-positive solid tumours. 
Randomisation 
LIBRETTO-001 study was a non-randomised study. 
Blinding (masking) 
LIBRETTO-001 study was a single-arm study. 
Statistical methods 
The protocol (Original Version) was dated 01 March 2017. Prior to data cut-off (DCO), there were 7 
versions of the protocol that included subversions depending on the geographical location. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 65/129 
 
 
  
Major changes in the conduct of the study were performed by Protocol version 5.0 dated 30 May 2018 
that updated the trial design from a two-part Phase 1 (dose escalation and dose expansion) study to a 
Phase 1/Phase 2 study based on promising early evidence from ongoing Phase I of durable antitumour 
activity in patients with RET-altered cancers; RP2D of 160 mg BID was selected, modifications were 
made to the composition of the cohorts, planned statistical analyses were updated as a reflection of 
the changes. In addition, it added assessment of HRQoL with validated instruments, included a new 
liquid formulation of selpercatinib for patients who cannot swallow capsules and included assessment 
of tumour serum thyroglobulin levels for patients with non-MTC thyroid cancers. 
Analysis Sets 
In order to facilitate regulatory review of the LOXO-RET-17001 data in support of the proposed 
indications for marketing authorisation, the applicant has created data sets that are distinctive from 
those discussed in the clinical study report. 
The basis of the data supporting the MAA is primarily on an analysis of efficacy and safety data from 
patients enrolled into LOXO-RET-17001, as of 17 June 2019. The dataset includes 531 patients who 
have been treated with selpercatinib, 439 of whom were treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose 
(RP2D) of 160 mg BID.  
Specifically, these data sets were categorised into broad groupings of patients with RET fusion- positive 
NSCLC, RET-mutant MTC, and RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer. These groupings then formed the 
basis for defining primary analysis sets (PAS) in NSCLC and MTC, which specifically included patients 
who received prior platinum-based chemotherapy (in the case of NSCLC) or prior cabozantinib or 
vandetanib (in the case of MTC). The PAS data sets also met specific criteria in terms of a minimum 
follow-up duration of 6 months from first dose, and statistical considerations which led to the sample 
sizes of 105 and 55 patients for the NSCLC and MTC PAS, respectively. The majority of patients in the 
PAS received at least 1dose of selpercatinib at the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily (BID). 
The PAS data sets, together with supplemental analysis sets (SAS) of patients in the first-line 
treatment setting, and a supportive analysis set of RET fusion- positive thyroid cancer patients, deliver 
the evidence base for the proposed indications. 
It should be noted that results from Phase 1 of study LIBRETTO-001 were submitted to ASCO in April 
2018, prior to submission of the May 2018 Briefing Book, and disclosed in June 2018 based on an 
interim analysis of data from investigator assessment of responses in the first 25 RET fusion-positive 
NSCLC and 19 RET-mutant MTC patients enrolled. Although the disclosure of preliminary efficacy did 
not represent the PAS defined for registration, the absence of confirmatory testing criteria prior to this 
analysis and disclosure may introduce bias, as discussed with the CHMP in July 2019. Therefore, 
sensitivity analysis was performed on a modified NSCLC & MTC PAS, which excludes the initial 25 and 
19 patients who were enrolled and included in the ASCO disclosure, but includes the 25 and 19 
patients enrolled subsequent to the initial 105 & 55, to maintain an overall sample size of 105 &55 for 
the modified PAS. 
For RET fusion-positive NSCLC, the analysis sets include a PAS, integrated analysis set (IAS) and 3 
supplemental analysis sets (SAS):  the PAS and SAS1 primarily support the indication for advanced RET 
fusion-positive NSCLC in patients who require systemic therapy.

Sample Size Considerations 
NSCLC - For the PAS, the SAP hypothesized that a true ORR of ≥ 50% would indicate significant clinical 
benefit in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC who had progressed on or after treatment with 
platinum-based chemotherapy. Under this assumption, a sample size of 105 patients was estimated to 
provide more than 98% power to rule out 30% as the lower boundary of a 2-sided 95% exact binomial 
CI for the ORR. The applicant considered this boundary as clinically meaningful given the limited 
treatment options in the referenced disease setting. Under the primary analysis, the lower limit of the 
95% CI would exceed 30% when the observed ORR was 40% or greater (Clopper-Pearson method). 
MTC - For the PAS, the SAP hypothesized that a true ORR of ≥ 40% would indicate significant clinical 
benefit in patients with RET-mutant MTC who had progressed on or after treatment with cabozantinib 
or vandetanib. Under this assumption, a sample size of 55 patients was estimated to provide 89% 
power to rule out 20% as the lower boundary of a 2-sided 95% exact binomial CI for the ORR. The 
applicant considered this boundary as considered clinically meaningful given the limited treatment 
options in the referenced disease setting. Under the primary analysis, the lower limit of the 95% CI 
would exceed 20% when the observed ORR was 33% or greater (Clopper-Pearson method). 
TC – No former hypothesis was settled for RET- fusion positive TC. 
As already discussed with the applicant as part of Scientific Advice procedures 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/398728/2019 & EMA/CHMP/SAWP/398729/2019), and for the NSCLC and MTC PAS, 
respectively, no confirmatory testing was pre-specified in this study and the current ORR is based on a

substantial part of the proposed number of patients for the PAS that were not pre-defined but are 
subpopulations of the overall population of the open-label study LOXO-RET-17001. Results and 
analysis sets are defined post hoc. 
Results 
As of the 17 June 2019 data cut-off, 531 patients had been treated on LIBRETTO-001 (439 of whom 
were treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 160 mg BID), including 226 patients with 
RET-mutant MTC, 253 patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC, 27 patients with RET fusion-positive 
thyroid cancer and 11 patients with RET fusion-positive other tumours.  
All 531 patients were included in the Safety Analysis Set at the initial submission. At the initial DCO, 
304 patients (57.3%) were eligible for response analysis whereas all 531 patients enrolled had an 
opportunity to be followed for at least 6 months from first dose of selpercatinib at the later DCO date 
of 16 December 2019.  
RET alterations were documented in 525 (98.9%) of the 531 patients; this included all patients 
(100%) in Cohorts 1 through 4 and 94.8% of patients in Cohort 5, as was expected based on the 
enrollment requirements for the specific cohorts.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The protocol versions that were implemented and enrolled patients before the data cut-off date for this 
interim CSR included Protocol versions 1.0 through 7.0 (and subversions of versions 1.0 through 7.0) 
as listed in Table 19. 
Phase 2 cohorts enrolled patients beginning with protocol version 5.0 (through version 7.0). 
Table 19.:Protocol Versions and Dates 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations were reported in 40 (7.5%) patients. The most frequently reported 
important protocol deviations were those relating to investigational product in 17 patients, and 
Inclusion Criteria and SAE reporting, each in 8 patients. None of the protocol deviations were 
considered to have an effect on the safety or efficacy outcomes of the study. 
The following sections will present the results by applied indication: 
RET fusion-positive NSCLC  
A total of 253 RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients were enrolled and treated in LIBRETTO-001 study.  
From the total NSCLC population, the majority of the patients were still on treatment (68.0%), at the 
time of the December 2019 DCO (approximately 31 months after the first patient was enrolled). 
Generally, the main cause of treatment discontinuation was disease progression. Around 20.9% of the 
total NSCLC patients continued treatment with selpercatinib after progression. The main cause of study 
discontinuation was death; figures were of 21.9% and 2.6% in the PAS and SAS1 population, 
respectively.

Median time on treatment (TOT) from baseline to DCO were 10.12 months and 3.88 months for PAS 
and SAS1 subsets, respectively. These results were in line with the median time on study (TOS) for 
both subset. These observations periods, specifically the one on for the SAS1 subset are considered 
relatively short to establish the benefit of selpercatinib in both NSCLC settings.

Numbers analysed 
The evidence supporting of the claimed indication in NSCLC came mostly from the 105 and 184 
patients from the PAS and IAS respectively (2L+ NSCLC setting) and the 39 patients from SAS1 
subsets (1L NSCLC setting). Sample size could be considered limited to generate evidence in the 
claimed indication for NSCLC.

CNS Response in the Primary Analysis Set 
Among the 253 RET fusion positive NSCLC patients (independent of analysis set), 96 had CNS 
metastasis and 23 had measurable CNS lesions according to IRC assessment. The ORR in the evaluable 
patients was 87% (20/23; 95% CI: 66.4, 97.2). The DOR was 9.36 months (range: 2.8- 23.9+).

RET fusion-positive TC 
Baseline data 
For the primary analysis population, the median age of patients was 54 years old (range 25– 88 yo). 
Proportion between both sexes were well balanced (47.4% of patients were male). Most of the patients 
studied were White (73.7%) while 10.5% were Asian, 5.3% were Black and 5.3% were 
Hispanic/Latino. Median BMI value was of 25.28 suggesting a borderline overweight of the patients. 
ECOG performance status was reported as 0 1 (89.5%) or 2 (10.5%). 
The different histologies represented in the 19 patients included: papillary (n = 13), poorly 
differentiated (n = 3), anaplastic (n = 2), and Hurthle cell (n = 1). The most common fusion partner 
was CCDC6 (47.4%) followed by NCOA4 (31.6%). Most of the patients were diagnosed by NGS on 
tumour. None of this population presented a concomitant Oncogenic Driver mutation.

This is considered in line with histology proportions in real life. Mostly all the patients were metastatic 
at diagnosis. Median time from diagnosis to study entry was of 92.30 months (range of 2.6- 401.7 
months). Almost, all of the patients presented at least one measurable lesion per investigator 
assessment. 
All of the RET-fusion positive mutant patients were previously treated at study entry; patients had 
received a median of 4 prior systemic therapies (range: 1 7). Prior therapies included radioactive 
iodine (84.2%), MKI (78.9%), other systemic therapy (42.1%). 
Concerning the dose exposure to selpercatinib, 92.6% received at least one dose of 160 mg BID. 
Reasons why this dose was not reached for all the population are unknown.  
Numbers analysed 
Of the RET fusion positive thyroid cancer patients previously treated with systemic therapy other than 
Radioactive iodine, and enrolled in LIBRETTO-001, 22 patients had the opportunity to be followed for 
at least 6 months and were considered efficacy eligible. The primary assessment of efficacy was based 
on the first 19 of the 22 consecutively enrolled patients.

Note: For RET- mutant MTC, the PAS includes the first 55 patients from IAS. The “Total” column is the sum of the IAS, SAS1, and 
SAS2. 
Related to the exposure to Selpercatinib, not all the patients had received at least one dose of 160 mg 
BID. Median time on treatment was 11.86 months in the PAS population whereas it was 7.28 months, 
5.47 and 5.45 months for the IAS, SAS1 and SAS2 subpopulations, respectively. Median values for 
time of study were mostly in line with those for time on treatment. This exposure is considered 
relatively low and the follow-up time not enough to evidence the efficacy profile of the selpercatinib in 
the intended indication.

Hypothesis  
For the RET-Fusion Positive NSCLC Primary Analysis Set:  
• 
• 
A true ORR of ≥ 50% is hypothesized when selpercatinib is administered 
to patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC who progressed on or after 
receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy.   
A sample size of 105 patients is estimated to provide more than 98% 
power to achieve a lower boundary of a 2-sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence interval (CI) about the estimated ORR that exceeds 30%.  
For the RET-Mutant MTC Primary Analysis Set:  
• 
• 
A true ORR of ≥ 40% is hypothesized when selpercatinib is administered 
to patients with RET-mutant MTC who require systemic therapy, have 
progressed following prior treatment and have no acceptable alternative 
treatment options.   
A sample size of 55 patients is estimated to provide 89% power to 
achieve a lower boundary of a 2-sided 95% exact binomial confidence 
interval (CI) about the estimated ORR that exceeds 20%.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The main evidence supporting this CMA request is coming from a pivotal phase I/II study to determine 
the MTD/RP2D and to assess the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in patients with RET-fusion 
positive solid tumours, RET-mutant MTC and other tumours with RET activation (study LiBRETTO-001/ 
LOXO-RET-17001).  
The applicant has decided not to pursue the use of selpercatinib in treatment naïve patients with RET 
fusion-positive NSCLC or cabozantinib and vandetanib treatment naive patients with RET-mutant 
medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Only second line indications are now targeted. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study LIBRETTO-001 is a phase I/II multi cohort study. The trial was initially designed as two parts 
(dose escalation and expansion) Phase I study. The update into the current design Phase I/ Phase II 
was done in the Protocol version 5.0 dated 30 May 2018 based on the results of the Phase I.  
The main limitation of this clinical trial is its non-randomised nature and the lack of a control arm, in 
addition to the fact that this is the only clinical trial in support of this submission. These limitations 
could be considered acceptable by the CHMP in the context of a CMA when the effect observed is 
considered outstanding and all the requirements for a CMA are fulfilled.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
RET-fusion positive NSCLC 
The evidence supporting the claimed indication in NSCLC came mostly from the 105 patients from the 
PAS (2L+ NSCLC setting). An integrated analysis set (IAS) was also performed, including PAS patients 
and those enrolled after the 105th patient but on or before the data cut-off (n=218). From a 
demographical point of view, the study population is considered representative of the intended 
population in NSCLC with most enrolled patients being metastatic and with an important disease 
burden.  
Prior platinum chemotherapy 
At the 16 December 2019 data cut-off date, results for the PAS population showed an ORR of 63.8% 
(67/105; 95% CI 53.9, 73) by IRC assessment. ORR as assessed by the investigator was consistent 
with the primary analysis (69.5% [95% CI: 59.8, 78.1]) with a concordance rate of 83%. The median 
DoR was 17.5 months (95% CI: 12.0, NE), with a median follow-up of 12.1 months. These results 
were confirmed at the 30 March 2020 with a median duration of follow-up of 15.67 months. 
Considering the advanced stage of the disease (more than a half of the patients had received 3 or 
more prior regimens) this response rate can be considered of relevance.  
Several exploratory analyses have been provided for ORR and DoR showing that in almost all 
subgroups, median duration of response was similar to that of the overall population. 
CNS metastasis are common in lung cancer patients. From the 253 RET fusion positive NSCLC patients 
(independent of analysis set), 96 had CNS metastasis and 23 had measurable CNS lesions according to 
IRC assessment. The ORR in the evaluable patients was 87% (20/23; 95% CI: 66.4, 97.2). The DOR 
was 9.36 months (range: 2.8- 23.9+). These data, show the potential activity of selpercatinib on the 
Assessment report

CNS, however, although data are promising, they should be interpreted with caution due to the small 
sample size. 
The IAS population includes 184 efficacy evaluable patients. On 184 patients the ORR (IRC 
assessment) was 56.5% (95% CI: 49.0, 63.8) at the 16 December 2019 DCO. The median DoR was of 
17.51 months (95% CI: 12.1, NE), with 24% of events and a median follow-up of 9.23 months. ORR 
according to the investigator was 62.5% (95% CI: 55.1, 69.5). The median PFS was 19.32 months 
(95% CI: 13.9, NE). At the 30 March 2020 DCO, the IAS population includes 218 efficacy evaluable 
patients, the ORR (IRC assessment) as 56.9% (95% CI: 50.0, 63.6). The median DoR was of 17.5 
months (95% CI: 12.5, NE) with a median follow-up of 11.9 months. 
RET-fusion positive TC 
The applied indication is for the treatment of patients with RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who 
require systemic therapy and who have progressed following prior treatment (Cohort 1). As per 
inclusion criteria, patients in Cohort 1 must have failed or be intolerant to prior treatment with 
sorafenib and/or lenvatinib and must also be radioactive iodine-refractory as appropriate.  
The total number of patients supporting the claimed indication in RET-fusion positive TC population 
was 27. Nineteen (19) out of them had received at least one prior systemic therapy other than RAI and 
8 were treatment naïve (no other systemic therapy other than RAI). Thus, these 19 patients may be 
considered the target population. RET-fusion positive TC population was not hypothesized as PAS.  
This population is comprised of patients with thyroid cancer of different histologies and whose 
management in clinical practice may differ. In this sense, while differentiated and poorly differentiated 
thyroid cancer in addition to Hurthle cell thyroid cancer may follow a similar approach, anaplastic 
thyroid cancer represents an aggressive tumour, with a very poor prognosis and whose management is 
quite different (ESMO 2019). Efficacy data according to histology have been provided and support 
consistency of effect across different histologies (data not shown). 
At the 30 March 2020 DCO with an additional 9.5 months of follow-up (20.27 months in total), the ORR 
(IRC assessment) in the 19 patients initially enrolled was 78.9% (15/19) (95% CI: 54.4, 93.9). ORR 
by the investigator was 57.9% (11/15) (95% CI: 33.5, 79.7). A great difference percentage-wide 
between the IRC and the investigator in terms of ORR is still observed. The median DoR was 18.43 
months (95% CI: 7.6, NE. Even though responses in this patient population appear durable the CI is 
wide, probably due to the low number of events/patients. Median PFS was 20.07 months (95% CI: 9.4, 
NE) and median OS was 27.20 (95% CI: 25.2, NE). 
At the 30 March 2020 data cut-off, efficacy data for 3 additional efficacy eligible patients (22 total 
patients) was available. In this patient population, ORR (IRC assessment) was 77.3% (17/22) (95% 
CI: 54.6, 92.2). 
RET-mutant MTC 
The evidence supporting of the claimed indication in MTC came from 55 patients from the PAS (2L+ 
MTC setting) and 88 supportive patients from SAS1 subset (1L and 2L+ MTC setting, 16 and 72 
patients, respectively). In addition, an IAS including all patients who met PAS criteria and were 
enrolled up to the data cut-off, was also performed (n=124). The sample size is considered limited to 
generate evidence in the full claimed indication for MTC. 
No overall differences were observed in the treatment emergent adverse events or effectiveness of 
selpercatinib between patients who were ≥65 years of age and younger patients. Limited data are 
available in patients ≥75 years. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 100/129 
 
 
  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Selpercatinib is also intended to be used in adolescent patients (i.e. ≥12 years) with RET-mutant MTC. 
In the study LIBRETTO-001, a total of three adolescent patients (15, 16 and 17 years, respectively) 
were included. Since according to the PIP (P/0369/2019) at least 2 evaluable subjects must be 
included for the primary analysis this measure was considered compliant with the PIP. The proposed 
dose of selpercatinib in adolescent patients with MTC is the same as for adults (i.e. 160 mg BID). 
However, in the study LOXO-RET-18036, an ongoing study in paediatric patients, including adolescent 
patients, a dose of 92 mg/m2 BID (with a maximum dose of 160 mg BID) was considered appropriate. 
Thus, further justification was requested on the selected dose for adolescent patients with MTC. In 
study LIBRETTO-001, the same dose was selected for adults and adolescent patients, since from the 
perspective of drug metabolism, patients 12 years or older can be considered adults. In the case of 
selpercatinib, it is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, which by the age of 12 may have reached its adult 
level of expression. In study LIBRETTO-001 the same dose was selected for adults and adolescent 
patients, since from the perspective of drug metabolism, patients 12 years or older can be considered 
adults. In the case of selpercatinib, it is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, which by the age of 12 may 
have reached its adult level of expression. With regard to study LOXO-RET-18036 (LIBRETTO-121), in 
paediatric patients (6 to 21 years), the planned initial dose (i.e. 92 mg/m2 BID) is intended to result in 
a similar exposure than the 160 mg/m2 in adults. The applicant indicated that any new information, 
from study LIBRETTO-121 regarding dosing in younger patients will be applied if required.  
Of these patients, 2 had a starting dose of 160 mg BID whereas 1 patient had a starting dose of 80 mg 
BID and escalated to 160 mg BID. Two patients achieved a partial response and 1 had a stable disease 
lasting longer than 16 weeks. All these 3 patients remain on treatment as of the cut-off date. 
Differences in exposure for extreme body weights do not seem to have a worrying impact in safety 
based on data provided but the limited number of <50 kg patients included and duration of exposure 
make it hard to reach any final conclusion about dose adjustment recommendation in these low weight 
patients. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The main limitations in relation to the efficacy of selpercatinib are related to the uncontrolled nature of 
the pivotal evidence which hampers the assessment of the time-to-event endpoints and the limited 
number of patients included. 
To confirm the benefits observed in study LIBRETTO-001 and in order to fulfil a CMA, two global phase 
3 studies were projected to begin in December 2019 and to complete enrolment by July 2021 
(LIBRETTO 431 in RET fusion-positive NSCLC) and August 2023 (LIBRETTO 531 in RET-mutant MTC).  
These phase 3 studies will be conducted in patients with treatment-naive RET-fusion non-squamous 
NSCLC and previously untreated RET-mutant MTC. As of 3 August 2020, 12 patients had been enrolled 
in the LIBRETTO-431 and 7 patients in the LIBRETTO-531. No additional trials are planned in patients 
with RET-fusion positive thyroid cancer. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The claimed indications in the context of this application for a CMA are as follows:  
Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with:  
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 101/129 
 
 
  
•  
advanced RET fusion positive non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who require systemic therapy 
following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy 
• 
advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy following prior 
treatment with sorafenib and/or lenvatinib. 
Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
with advanced RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy following 
prior treatment with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib 
The unmet medical need in the applied indications is recognized. 
Major therapeutic advantage (MTA) can be considered demonstrated for RET-mutant MTC patients who 
have failed prior treatment with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib as well as for those patients with RET 
fusion-positive thyroid cancer who had received prior systemic therapy with MKIs, as treatment options 
in these settings are rather limited or even lacking.  
Regarding RET fusion-positive NSCLC, treatment options after progression on platinum-based therapy 
include immune checkpoint inhibitors as monotherapy (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab), 
single agent chemotherapy, or docetaxel in combination with ramucirumab or nintedanib. ORR in this 
setting range between 5-23% with chemotherapy and 14-21% with immunotherapy (DoR around 16-
17 months with immunotherapy). However, it should be pointed out that all these regiments have 
demonstrated a clinical benefit in terms of PFS/OS. Data in patients with RET fusion-positive NSCLC 
even though limited, suggest response rate of these second line regimens could vary from 6-38%, 
which is lower than the reported ORR for selpercatinib. In this regard, in the study LIBRETTO-001 
similar results were observed in an intrapatient analysis, which provides further insights on the 
apparently low response of immune and immune-chemotherapy in RET fusion-positive tumours.  
A MTA of selpercatinib in RET fusion-positive NSCLC patients can therefore be considered 
demonstrated after immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
- In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients with 
RET fusion-positive NSCLC, RET fusion -positive thyroid cancer and RET mutant MTC, the MAH should 
submit the final study report from the pivotal study LIBRETTO-001 by 31 December 2023 
- In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients with 
RET fusion-positive NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the Phase 3 study J2G-
MC-JZJC (LIBRETTO-431) comparing selpercatinib to platinum-based and pemetrexed therapy with or 
without pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, RET-fusion-positive non-
squamous NSCLC. The CSR should be submitted by 31 October 2023. 
- In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients with 
RET-mutant MTC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the Phase 3 study J2G-MC-JZJB 
(LIBRETTO-531) comparing selpercatinib to physician’s choice of cabozantinib or vandetanib in patients 
with progressive, advanced, kinase inhibitor-naive, RET-mutant MTC. The CSR should be submitted by 
28 February 2025 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Analysis of clinical safety data is based on LOXO-RET-17001 (“LIBRETTO-001”), “A Phase 1/2 study of 
oral LOXO-292 in patients with advanced solid tumours, including RET Fusion-positive Solid Tumours, 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 102/129 
 
 
  
Medullary Thyroid Cancer, and Other Tumours with RET Activation”. This study included a dose 
escalation (Phase 1) and dose expansion (Phase 2) portion.  
This clinical trial was initiated in May of 2017 and is currently ongoing. Patients were treated with 
selpercatinib at doses ranging from 20 mg once daily (QD) through 240 mg BID during Phase 1. The 
RP2D was selected to be 160 mg BID. 
Several pharmacology studies (listed below) have contributed to the safety dataset.  
In addition, data from an expanded access programme, consisting of single-patient protocols, for a 
subset of patients who completed these studies (i.e., stopped selpercatinib after successful surgery; 
withdrew consent; progressed) and for whom clinical study reports were therefore available, have been 
provided.  
Table 52. Clinical Pharmacology Studies Contributing Patient Data to the safety database 
Three analysis sets were utilized for the analysis and interpretation of the safety data, as outlined 
below: 
- The Overall Safety Analysis Set (OSAS, n = 746) includes all patients who were enrolled in 
LIBRETTO-001 and received 1 or more doses of selpercatinib as of the 30 Mars 2020 data cutoff date. 
- The RET Fusion-positive NSCLC Safety Analysis Set (n =345) includes all patients with documented 
RET fusion-positive NSCLC who were enrolled in LIBRETTO-001 and received 1 or more doses of 
selpercatinib as of the 30 Mars 2020 data cutoff date. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 103/129 
 
 
  
 
-The RET-mutant MTC Safety Analysis Set (n = 315) includes all patients with documented RET-mutant 
MTC who were enrolled in LIBRETTO-001 and received 1 or more doses of selpercatinib as of the 30 
March 2020 data cutoff date. 
- The RET Fusion-positive Thyroid cancer Safety Analysis Set (n=42)  
The OSAS included, in addition to the patients in the RET-mutant MTC and RET fusion-positive NSCLC 
analysis sets, 42 additional patients (28 patients with RET fusion-positive cancers other than thyroid or 
lung, and 16 patients with other cancers). 
Patient exposure 
At the 30 Mars 2020 data cutoff, the LIBRETTO-001 study was ongoing. Most patients were still being 
treated and new patients were still being enrolled. As of the data cutoff, 746 patients had received at 
least 1 dose of selpercatinib. 
Table 53. Patient Disposition 
Adverse events 
Overall safety is summarized in the table below. Most treated patients (99.2%) experienced at least 1 
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) of any grade, regardless of relationship to study drug 
during the study and most patients (92.5%) had at least 1 TEAE that was attributed by the 
investigator to selpercatinib. More than half of the patients (59.7%) had Grade 3 or higher TAEs, 32.0 
% considered related to selpercatinib.

Table 57. Summary of death occurred in Libretto-001 study, at the time of cut-off (Safety Analysis Set) - 
LIBRETTO-001 (Data Cut-off: 30 March 2020) 
One hundred and four subjects (13.9%, 104/746) in the safety population had died at the time of data 
cut-off date: 56 patients with RET fusion-positive NSCL, 28 with RET mutant MTC and 14 with other 
tumour RET alteration. In most cases (67.3%, n=70) the reported reason for death was disease 
progression followed by Adverse event (24%, n=25) then other (8.6%, n=9). 
One hundred and three (99%, 103/104) of patients died either while receiving selpercatinib or within 
28 days of their last dose. The reported reason for death was disease progression (67.9%, 70/103) 
followed by adverse event (24.3%, 25/103) then other (~0.8, 8/103). Although the population is too 
small to draw any precise conclusions, it is noted that the number of deaths is higher in NSCL patients 
(~54% , 55/103) than in the MTC population (27%, 28/103).  
Serious Adverse Events 
A total of 262 (35.1%) of the 746 patients experienced a treatment-emergent serious adverse event 
(SAE). 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 108/129 
 
 
  
 
 
Table 58. Overall Incidence of SAEs in ≥1% of Patients in decreasing order of frequency (Safety 
Analysis Set) - LIBRETTO-001 (Data Cut-off: 30 March 2020) 
Approximately 35% of subjects in the safety population experienced at least one SAE and only 8.3% 
were adjudicated as treatment-related by the Investigator. Although this could be considered overall 
reassuring, the absence of direct controls and the heterogeneity of the safety population limit the 
reliability of causality relationships.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Three adverse events of special interest (AESI) identified early in the clinical programme were ALT or 
AST increase, drug hypersensitivity, and hypertension by aggregating composite terms. All of these 
AEs are monitorable and are reversible with dose interruptions, reductions, or discontinuations.  
AST/ALT Increase 
Based on laboratory assessment, ALT and AST elevations were reported in 49.5% and 55% patients, 
respectively. Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations were reported in 10.6% and 9.0% patients 
respectively.  
The median time to first onset was: AST increase 4.1 weeks (range: 0.7, 108.1), ALT increase 4.1 
weeks (range: 0.9, 111.1). 
Hypertension 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 109/129 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In patients receiving selpercatinib, the median maximum increase from baseline systolic pressure was 
29 mm Hg (range: –11, +96). Only 13% of patients retained their baseline grade during treatment, 
45% had an increasing shift of 1 grade, 32.7% of 2 grades, and 8.3% of 3 grades. Hypertension was 
reported in 41.9% patients with history of hypertension (26.9% with grade 3) and 34.2% of patients 
without history of hypertension (14.1% with grade 3, 4). 
Overall, a total of 19.4% displayed treatment emergent Grade 3 hypertension (defined as maximum 
systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg). Diastolic blood pressure results were similar, but the 
increases were of lesser magnitude. No patients were permanently discontinued due to hypertension. 
Other Notable Event: 
QT prolongation 
Review of ECG data showed 6.2% of patients had >500 msec maximum post baseline QTcF value, and 
17.5% of patients had a >60 msec maximum increase from baseline in QTcF intervals. At the time of 
the last post-baseline measurement, increase in QTc value >60 msec was reported in 2.6% of 
patients. 
There were no reports of Torsade de pointes, sudden death, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular 
fibrillation, or ventricular flutter. No patient discontinued treatment due to QT prolongation. 
Haemorrhages 
Grade ≥3 haemorrhagic events occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with selpercatinib, including 
3 (0.4%) patients with fatal haemorrhagic events, one case each of cerebral haemorrhage, 
tracheostomy site haemorrhage, and haemoptysis. The median time to onset was 12.8 weeks (range: 
0.1 week to 124.3 weeks).

Hypersensitivity was analysed as a composite term including the MedDRA preferred terms (PTs) of 
‘hypersensitivity’ and ‘drug hypersensitivity.’ Hypersensitivity occurred in a total of 5.2% (39/746) of 
patients receiving selpercatinib, including Grade 3 hypersensitivity in 1.7% (13/746) of patients. There 
were no hypersensitivity events of Grade 4 or Grade 5 severity. Thirty-one (4.2%) patients had 
hypersensitivity related to study drug. Fourteen (1.9%) patients had SAEs of hypersensitivity, all of 
which were related to the study drug. Of the 39 total patients with hypersensitivity (composite term), 
26 patients (3.5%) underwent dose reduction, 6 patients (0.8%) underwent dose interruption, and 3 
patients (0.4%) had study drug discontinuation as the most significant action taken.  
In study LIBRETTO 001, 24.7% (184/746) of patients treated with selpercatinib had previously 
received anti PD 1/PD L1 immunotherapy. Of the 39 patients with hypersensitivity, 64.1% (25/39) had 
NSCLC and had received prior anti PD 1/PD L1 immunotherapy. Grade 3 hypersensitivity occurred in 
3.8% (7/184) of the patients previously treated with anti PD 1/PD L1 immunotherapy. The median 
time to onset was 1.9 weeks (range: 0.9 week to 77 weeks): 1.7 weeks in patients with previous anti 
PD 1/PD L1 immunotherapy and 8.9 weeks in patients who were immunotherapy naïve.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific data on safety-related to DDI has been submitted (see section on clinical pharmacology). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Forty-five patients (6.0%) permanently discontinued treatment because of an AE, with no predominant 
pattern among the specific AEs reported or any new safety concerns: 16 of the 45 patients (2.1% of all 
patients treated) discontinued selpercatinib because of a treatment-related AE. 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 112/129 
 
 
  
 
Nine AEs led to treatment discontinuation in more than 1 patient: 
•  ALT increased and sepsis (3 patients each, 0.4%), and 
•  AST increased, cardiac failure, drug hypersensitivity, fatigue, pericardial effusion, pneumonia, 
and thrombocytopenia (2 patients each, 0.3%). 
Two hundred fifty-one (33.6%) patients had dose reductions due to any AE. The most common TEAEs 
that led to dose reductions were  
•  ALT increase (53 patients, 7.1%) 
•  AST increase (48 patients, 6.4%) 
• 
fatigue (20 patients, 2.7%) 
•  QT prolongation (19 patients, 2.5%), and 
• 
drug hypersensitivity (17 patients, 2.3%).  
Three hundred and thirty-four (44.8%) patients had dose interruptions due to any AE. The most 
common TEAEs that led to dose interruptions were  
•  ALT increase (42 patients, 5.6%)  
•  AST increase and hypertension (each in 37 patients, 5.0%) 
• 
• 
• 
diarrhoea (24 patients, 3.2%) 
pyrexia (20 patients, 2.7%), and  
electrocardiogram (ECG) QT prolongation (16 patients, 2.1%).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The integrated safety database supporting the MAA of selpercatinib in the broad claimed indications is 
comprised of 746 subjects who received at least one dose of selpercatinib across a Phase I/II dose 
escalation/expansion study with a data cutoff of 30 March 2020.  
As a general concern, the uncontrolled design of the study on which the analysis is based and the 
limited median exposure (11.07 months versus 5.9 months in the initial report) do not allow to clearly 
differentiate between signs/symptoms of the underlying malignancy and selpercatinib-related adverse 
events (AEs), further limiting precise evaluations of selpercatinib safety profile. The integrated safety 
population is also characterised by a significant heterogeneity between populations in terms of age 
(min 15, max 90 years), type of underlying malignancy, dose administered (from 20mg QD to 240mg 
BID), that further complicates safety evaluation.  
The median treatment duration in adult patients was 11.7 months. The median time on treatment in 
MTC population was ~12 months vs 10.5 months in NSCLC. 
Patients with hepatic, renal or cardiac impairment (including prolonged QT syndrome) at baseline were 
not included in LIBRETTO-001 (as per inclusion/exclusion criteria). Clinical pharmacology studies are 
ongoing to further investigate use in patients with renal and hepatic impaired patients. Exposure and 
safety in patients with severe hepatic impairment and cardiac impairment have been included as 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 113/129 
 
 
  
missing information in the Risk management plan (RMP). There were also limited numbers of patients 
over 75 years of age. 
The 5 most frequently reported AEs were dry mouth (35.5%), diarrhoea (21.8%), hypertension 
(25.5%), AST increase (26.3%), and ALT increase (26.4%). Grade≥3 AEs were reported in 59.7% of 
patients. 
The most commonly reported Grade≥ 3 AEs were hypertension (19.2%) and ALT increased (9.8%). 
Apart from hypertension, most reported AEs which occurred in ≥ 15% of patients were Grades 1-2 in 
severity.  
ALT and AST should be monitored prior to the start of selpercatinib therapy, every 2 weeks during the 
first 3 months of treatment, monthly for the next 3 months of treatment, and otherwise as clinically 
indicated. Based on the level of ALT or AST elevations, selpercatinib may require dose modification. 
Dose modification is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST increase (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
In view of the risk of hypertension, patient blood pressure should be controlled before starting 
selpercatinib treatment, monitored during selpercatinib treatment and treated as needed with standard 
anti-hypertensive therapy. Based on the level of increased blood pressure, selpercatinib may require 
dose modification. Selpercatinib should be discontinued permanently if medically significant 
hypertension cannot be controlled with antihypertensive therapy (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC). 
QT interval prolongation was reported in patients receiving selpercatinib. Therefore, dose interruption 
or modification may be required in patients (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). Selpercatinib should be used 
with caution in patients with such conditions as congenital long QT syndrome or acquired long QT 
syndrome or other clinical conditions that predispose to arrhythmias.  
Patients should have a QTcF interval of ≤470 ms and serum electrolytes within normal range before 
starting selpercatinib treatment. Electrocardiograms and serum electrolytes should be monitored in all 
patients after 1 week of selpercatinib treatment, at least monthly for the first 6 months and otherwise, 
as clinically indicated, adjusting frequency based upon risk factors including diarrhoea, vomiting, 
and/or nausea. Hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia should be corrected prior to 
initiating selpercatinib and during treatment. Selpercatinib may require dose interruption or 
modification (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Serious including fatal haemorrhagic events were reported in patients receiving selpercatinib. 
Selpercatinib should be permanently discontinued in patients with severe or life threatening 
haemorrhage (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC).  
There are no available data from the use of selpercatinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity. Selpercatinib is not recommended during pregnancy. Women of 
childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception during treatment and for at least one 
week after the last dose of selpercatinib. Men with female partners of childbearing potential should use 
effective contraception during treatment and for at least one week after the last dose of selpercatinib. 
It should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. 
It is unknown whether selpercatinib is excreted in human milk. A risk to breast-fed newborns/infants 
cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with selpercatinib and for 
at least one week after the last dose. 
No human data on the effect of selpercatinib on fertility are available. Based on findings from animal 
studies, male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with selpercatinib. Both men and 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 114/129 
 
 
  
women should seek advice on fertility preservation before treatment (see sections 4.4 and 4.6 of the 
SmPC). 
Selpercatinib may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
advised to be cautious when driving or using machines in case they experience fatigue or dizziness 
during treatment with selpercatinib (see sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
Additional safety data including comparative data will be provided as part of the studies imposed as 
specific obligations. Longer follow-up from LIBRETTO-001 will allow a better characterisation of the 
long-term safety and the randomised phase 3 studies LIBRETTO-431 and LIBRETTO-531 will allow a 
contextualisation of the safety data compared to the control arm. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety database includes 746 patients treated with selpercatinib. Selpercatinib presents substantial 
toxicity, as shown by the high incidence of severe, including life-threatening and fatal adverse events. 
The safety profile is nevertheless consistent with that seen for other TKIs, with significant 
gastrointestinal toxicities, hypertension, increased transaminases and QT interval prolongation. 
Haemorrhages, including Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), CNS haemorrhage, and cardiac toxicity 
(other than QT interval prolongation). Relevant information has been reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.8 
of the SmPC.  
Based on available data, the safety profile of selpercatinib in adult patients is considered overall 
manageable. Uncertainties are still present due to the lack of direct controls and heterogeneity of 
patients which will be addressed by the specific obligations being imposed in the context of the CMA. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
- In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients with 
RET fusion-positive NSCLC, RET fusion -positive thyroid cancer and RET mutant MTC, the MAH should 
submit the final study report from the pivotal study LIBRETTO-001 by 31 December 2023 
- In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients with 
RET fusion-positive NSCLC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the Phase 3 study J2G-
MC-JZJC (LIBRETTO-431) comparing selpercatinib to platinum-based and pemetrexed therapy with or 
without pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, RET-fusion-positive non-
squamous NSCLC. The CSR should be submitted by 31 October 2023. 
- In order to further confirm the efficacy and safety of selpercatinib in the treatment of patients with 
RET-mutant MTC, the MAH should submit the clinical study report of the Phase 3 study J2G-MC-JZJB 
(LIBRETTO-531) comparing selpercatinib to physician’s choice of cabozantinib or vandetanib in patients 
with progressive, advanced, kinase inhibitor-naive, RET-mutant MTC. The CSR should be submitted by 
28 February 2025.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 08.05.2020. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers selpercatinib to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Retsevmo (selpercatinib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
• 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a] 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with:  
– 
advanced RET fusion positive non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who require systemic therapy 
following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy 
– 
advanced RET fusion positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy following prior 
treatment with sorafenib and/or lenvatinib. 
Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
with advanced RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy following 
prior treatment with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to ESMO and NCCN guidelines, the preferred standard of care in the second line setting, is 
systemic immune checkpoints inhibitors, such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab or atezolizumab, or other 
systemic therapy as docetaxel, pemetrexed or gemcitabine, among others. 
Regarding  the  treatment  of  RET-mutant  medullary  thyroid  cancer  (MTC),  there  are  currently  two 
alternatives available: cabozantinib and vandetanib, as per ESMO and NCCN guidelines. These two drugs 
are MKIs that have demonstrated in RCTs a better efficacy profile in RET mutated patient compared to 
the overall MTC population. In patients who are refractory or intolerant to vandetanib or cabozantinib 
there are no approved treatment options. 
There is no approved therapy for RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer (TC) after failure of one prior MKI. 
However, there are still alternatives available such as the use of subsequent MKIs after failure of a first 
line MKI which is not contraindicated in TC, although data on second line treatment are scarce and even 
more so in the RET fusion positive TC patients. There is a need for treatments showing efficacy in this 
patient population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Data are mainly taken from study LOXO-RET-17001 (LIBRETTO-001), a multicentre, open-label, phase 
1/2 study in patients with advanced solid tumours, including RET fusion-positive solid tumours (e.g., 
NSCLC, thyroid, pancreas, colorectal), RET-mutant MTC, and other tumours with RET activation (e.g., 
mutations in other tumour types or other evidence of RET activation). This study is ongoing and 
includes two parts: Phase 1 (dose escalation) and Phase 2 (dose expansion); the study is currently in 
Phase 2.

In PAS population (n=55), the ORR (IRC assessment) was 69.1% (95% CI: 55.2, 80.9%). At the time 
of the DCO, with a median follow-up of 17.45 months, median DoR was not reached (95% CI: 19.1, NE). 
Regarding other secondary endpoints, median PFS was not reached and median OS was of 33.25 months 
(95%CI: 33.2; NE).  
In the IAS population as of the March 2020 data cut-off, the number of evaluable patients was of 143 
and the ORR was 69.2% (95% CI: 61, 76.7). The median DoR was not reached (95% CI: 19.1, NE), 
with a median follow-up of 10.05 months. In line with the PAS population, median PFS was not reached 
at the time of the DCO and median OS was of 33.25 months (18% events). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The main limitations are related to the uncontrolled nature of the pivotal evidence which hampers the 
assessment of the time-to-event endpoints and the limited number of patients included. 
These limitations will be addressed post authorisation with the submission of updated data and longer 
follow-up from the LIBRETTO-001 study and the conduct of 2 randomised phase III trials: LIBRETTO-
431 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, RET-fusion-positive non-squamous NSCLC and 
LIBRETTO-531 in patients with progressive, advanced, kinase inhibitor-naive, RET-mutant MTC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety database is comprised of 746 subjects who received at least one dose of selpercatinib 
across a Phase I/II dose escalation/expansion study with a data cut-off of 30 March 2020. 
Grade ≥3 AEs and SAEs were experienced, respectively, by 63% and 35% of patients. 
The most commonly reported ADRs were AST increased (55.0%), ALT increased (49.5%), lymphocyte 
count decreased (46.2%), dry mouth (40.3%), diarrhoea (39.0%), Oedema (38.7%), fatigue (38.2%) 
and hypertension (37.4%). The most common Grade ≥ 3 ADRs are hypertension (19.4%), lymphocyte 
count decreased (16.1%), ALT increased (10.6%), AST increased (9%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/9037/2021 
Page 122/129 
 
 
  
The most commonly (≥1% of patients) reported SAEs by PT were pneumonia (3.1%), dyspnoea, and 
hyponatremia (each 1.9%). ALT increase, AST increase (each 1.6%), abdominal pain, pleural effusion 
(each 1.5%), drug hypersensitivity (1.3%), diarrhoea (1.2%), acute kidney injury and pyrexia (each 
1.1%). 
Grade 5 AEs occurred in 104 (13.9%, 104/746) patients, all in the adult population; none of which 
were assessed by the investigator as related to selpercatinib. The reported reason for 24.3% (25/103) 
of these early deaths is an adverse event. 
The impact of selpercatinib on the incidence of QT interval prolongation was also confirmed: 18.1% of 
patients experienced this ADR, of which 30 (4.0%) had events ≥Grade 3. QT interval prolongation was 
managed by selpercatinib dose interruptions or reductions. No patient discontinued treatment due to 
QT prolongation. 
As for other TKIs, the risk for haemorrhagic events and cardiac toxicity (other than QT interval 
prolongation) are of concern and considered as important identified risks (see RMP).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The uncontrolled design of LIBRETTO-001 study and the limited median exposure (11.7 months) do 
not allow to clearly disentangle signs/symptoms of the underlying malignancy and selpercatinib-related 
adverse events (AEs), limiting precise evaluation of selpercatinib’s safety profile. The integrated safety 
population is also characterised by a significant heterogeneity in terms of age (min 15, max 90 years), 
type of underlying malignancy, dose administered (from 20mg QD to 240mg BID), that further 
complicates safety evaluations. 
Finally, long-term follow-up is needed as uncertainties still remain on the safety profile of selpercatinib. 
The updated data from the LIBRETTO-001 and the two randomised phase 3 studies (LIBRETTO-431 
and LIBRETTO-531) to be submitted post approval will address these uncertainties.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Results  from  study  LIBRETTO-001  are  considered  promising  and  of  clinical  relevance  in  the  applied 
indications, with response rates ranging from 56.9% to 78.9% and a minimum duration of response of 
17.5 months depending on the indication and the patient population. 
From  a  safety  point  of  view,  the  most  common  AEs  reported  with  selpercatinib  were  gastrointestinal 
(mainly  diarrhoea  and  constipation),  dry  mouth,  hypertension,  fatigue  and  AST  and  ALT  increases. 
ALT/AST increases, hypertension and hypersensitivity are considered adverse events of special interest 
for selpercatinib.  
Uncertainties  remain  due  to  the  lack  of  direct  controls  and  population  heterogeneity  in  the  safety 
database. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The effect observed with selpercatinib in the intended target populations is considered of clinical 
relevance. 
Uncertainties are still present due to the lack of direct controls and population heterogeneity of the 
safety database and will be addressed by the studies imposed as specific obligations which will provide 
comprehensive data on both efficacy and safety aspects.  
The benefit -risk balance for selpercatinib in the applied indications is considered positive.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a seriously debilitating, life-
threatening disease. Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a 
conditional marketing authorisation: 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as the results from study LIBRETTO-001 are of clinical 
relevance in the applied indications, with response rates ranging from 56.9% to 78.9% and a 
minimum duration of response of 17.5 months depending on the indication and the patient 
population. From a safety point of view, the most common AEs reported with selpercatinib were 
gastrointestinal (mainly diarrhoea and constipation), dry mouth, hypertension, fatigue and AST 
and ALT increases. In view of the assumed clinical benefit, the safety of selpercatinib is 
considered acceptable. 
• 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. 
Study J2G-MC-JZJC (LIBRETTO-431) is a global, multicentre, randomised (1:1), open- label, controlled 
Phase 3 study of selpercatinib compared to platinum-based and pemetrexed therapy with or without 
pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, RET-fusion-positive non-squamous 
NSCLC. Twenty-two (22) patients had been enrolled as of 27 October 2020, and 155 sites (71.4%) 
were enrolment ready. In addition, the number of pre-screening patients has been increased in the last 
months up to a total of 502 subjects. Moreover, the inclusion of Chinese sites in the study will 
contribute to enrolment. The applicant expects the enrolment to be completed by July 2021 and that 
the primary outcome CSR will be available by May 2023. Considering that an indication in the first line 
setting (i.e. in RET fusion-positive NSCLC treatment-naïve patients) is not currently pursued by the 
applicant, the feasibility of the study is not questioned. 
Study J2G-MC-JZJB (LIBRETTO-531) is a global, multicentre, randomised (2:1), open-label, Phase 3 
study comparing selpercatinib to physician’s choice of cabozantinib or vandetanib in patients with 
progressive, advanced, kinase inhibitor-naive, RET-mutant MTC. As of 27 October 2020, 158 sites have 
been selected, of which 93 have initiated. A total of 18 patients have been enrolled so far in the study, 
65 patients have consented for RET testing and 29 are on the pre-screening/screening phase. 
Enrolment is expected to be completed by August 2023 and the CSR is expected by September 2024. 
Since the indication in the first line setting (i.e. in patients with RET-mutant MTC 
cabozantinib/vandetanib naïve) is not further pursued by the applicant, completion of the study is 
considered feasible. 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, in view of the high overall response rates and the long 
duration of response of selpercatinib in the applied indications. It can be assumed that there will be a 
clinical benefit in these patients which will be confirmed post authorisation as described above.  
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required. Given the positive benefit/risk and the unmet medical 
need in the applied indications as described above, this is considered fulfilled.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Retsevmo is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Retsevmo is not similar to Cometriq and Nexavar within 
the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Retsevmo is favourable in the following indication: 
Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults with:  
– 
advanced RET fusion positive non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who require systemic therapy 
following prior treatment with immunotherapy and/or platinum-based chemotherapy 
– 
advanced RET fusion positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy following prior 
treatment with sorafenib and/or lenvatinib. 
Retsevmo as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years and older 
with advanced RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) who require systemic therapy following 
prior treatment with cabozantinib and/or vandetanib. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

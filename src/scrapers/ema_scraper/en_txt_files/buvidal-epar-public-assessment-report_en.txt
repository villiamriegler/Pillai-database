2.  Introduction 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Buvidal is indicated for treatment of opioid dependence within a framework of medical, social and psychological 
treatment.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Opioid dependence constitutes a large burden to patients as well as to their families and to the wider society. It 
is estimated that 33 million people misused opioids globally in 2014. Of these, 17 million people misused opiates 
(heroin, morphine or opium). Worldwide there were an estimated 207,400 drug-related deaths in 2015, one 
third of which were due to overdoses. Illicit opioids were responsible for a majority of these deaths, with more 
than 33,000 deaths reported only in the US in 2015. 
There were at least 7585 overdose deaths reported in Europe in 2014 and in over 80% of those, illicit opioids (in 
particular heroin) were present. This is underpinned by a trend of increasing overdose deaths from methadone 
and potent synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, as shown by recent statistics from the UK and Scandinavia. This may 
also be related to poor adherence to current daily medication-assisted treatment (MAT), with continued on-top 
use of illicit opioids and other drugs, as well as to diversion and misuse of methadone, morphine and BPN-based 
medication. 
Use of injected drugs is a major risk factor for the acquisition and transmission of HIV, and about 5-10% of HIV 
infections are attributable to injecting drug use worldwide. Transmission of HIV between people who inject drugs 
is predominantly a result of the sharing of contaminated injecting equipment, but also sexual transmission, both 
of which are influenced by wider structural and environmental factors such as housing, patterns of drug use and 
commercial sex work. The prevalence of HCV in drug users is also very high and estimated to be 40-80% in 
many European countries. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features - Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Opioid dependence is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized by repeated, compulsive seeking, and use of an 
opioid despite adverse social, psychological, and/or physical consequences (ICD-10). 
Biological research indicates that opiate dependence is a chronic relapsing remitting brain disorder that requires 
long-term treatment.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The following are the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Opioid Use Disorder: 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 9/116 
  
  
2.1.5.  Management 
In Europe, there are an estimated 1.3 million high-risk opioid users and of those, only about 50% (630,000) 
receive medication-assisted treatment (MAT). Methadone was the first drug to be introduced for MAT in the 
1960’s when it was discovered that it had stabilizing effects on the addictive behavior and social functioning 
compared to injected heroin. Methadone also improved the treatment retention rate compared to 
non-pharmacological treatment and the retention has subsequently been shown to be around 50-70% after 
6-12 months in both controlled clinical studies and cohort studies. Furthermore, MAT with methadone has been 
shown to reduce mortality, illicit use of opioids and risk for infections with blood-borne viruses such as HIV. 
However, there are major disadvantages with methadone. As a full mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, 
methadone is attractive for diversion and the drug is therefore usually distributed in special programs including 
medical supervision, and as a daily supervised medication, methadone treatment is resource-intensive. 
Furthermore, methadone has pronounced negative effects on cognitive function and is associated with a greater 
risk of causing prolonged QTc intervals and potentially fatal heart arrhythmias compared to BPN. Most 
importantly, as a full MOR agonist, the drug can lead to overdoses and there is a substantial and increasing 
number of drug-related deaths in Europe that are related to methadone. Nevertheless, compared to no MAT, 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 10/116 
  
  
 
methadone is considered to have a positive benefit-risk balance and it is on the WHO model lists of essential 
medicines for treatment of opioid dependence.  
Currently available treatment options for opioid dependence vary between countries, with the full opioid mu (μ) 
opioid receptor (MOR) agonist methadone being used in 63%, buprenorphine (BPN)-based medications in 35% 
and other pharmaceutical drugs in 2% of patients in Europe. Besides methadone and BPN (with or without 
naloxone [NX]), other medicinal products for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) in Europe are the full MOR 
agonists slow-release oral morphine and supervised injectable heroin. There are several issues with currently 
available daily MAT: 
 Ne e d  fo r  d a ily ,  o ft e n  s u p e r v ised, dosing resulting in inconvenience, stigma and reduced quality of life for 
patients as well as burdens on the healthcare system

There is no prolonged release form of buprenorphine available in the EU for the treatment of opioid addiction. 
2.2.  About the product 
Buprenorphine is a well-known substance widely used in the treatment of opioid dependence. 
Buvidal products are prolonged-release solutions for injection designed to provide therapeutic levels of BPN that 
are comparable to those of daily sublingual (SL) BPN, over 1 week (CAM2038 q1w) or 1 month (CAM2038 q4w), 
following a single SC injection. 
Buvidal can be used for individualized therapy across treatment phases; from initiation and stabilization to 
maintenance treatment in adults and adolescents aged 16 years or over. The depot administration was 
developed to enhance treatment adherence, avoid diversion, misuse, unintentional paediatric exposure and 
reduce burdens of daily supervised administration. A primary goal of treatment for opioid dependence is to help 
patients to reduce or eliminate illicit opioid use as this facilitates achievement of other important goals, including 
improved physical and mental health, and psychosocial functioning. 
2.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific 
advice 
Pertinent CHMP Guidelines were followed. 
Scientific advice was provided by the CHMP (2015) Procedure No: EMEA/H/SA/3166/1/2015/III. CHMP provided 
scientific advice on the proposed Phase 3 trial to support an MAA submission including study design, study 
population, choice of comparator and proposed indication. In agreement with the scientific advice provided by 
the CHMP, the pivotal randomized, double-blind, double-dummy Phase 3 study (HS-11-421) evaluated the 
non-inferiority of CAM2038 compared to an existing standard of care sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone (SL 
BPN/NX) with percentage of urine samples negative for illicit opioids being the primary endpoint. 
Scientific advice was also provided by BfArM and the MPA in 2011. At these meetings, advice was received 
regarding additional need of Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) data and non-clinical data for start 
of late stage clinical development and for Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA), as well as the clinical 
Assessment report

development program. Both agencies supported the strategy to provide a combination of published data on BPN 
together with own non-clinical and clinical data to prove the efficacy and safety of the CAM2038 q1w product. 
2.4.  General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
The pivotal non clinical studies, including repeat dose and chronic toxicity studies of CAM2038 and FC vehicle as 
well as the toxicity studies for GDO and NMP were conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) 
regulations. For a majority of the publications cited in the nonclinical section of this submission, the GLP status 
of the studies was not stated. In some publications, however, the GLP status was stated and is noted when 
describing the results of a specific publication.  
The clinical studies submitted with these applications contain a statement that they were performed in 
compliance with GCP guidelines. 
2.5.  Type of application and other comments on the submitted dossier 
• 
Legal basis 
This  marketing  authorisation  application  for  the  2  formulations  50mg/ml  and  356mg/ml  subcutaneous 
buprenorphine injection depot is being submitted under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, with Subutex as 
the  reference  medicinal  product.  This  product  is  being  submitted  under  Special  medical  Prescription  in 
accordance with Article 71 of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
The reference product is Subutex sublingual tablets 0.4 mg, 2 mg and 8 mg. The proposed product differs from 
the reference medicinal product in that there is a change of pharmaceutical form, change in strength and change 
in route of administration. 
The application was supported by quality, non-clinical and clinical data. To establish a bridge to the data of the 
reference medicinal product, the applicant conducted a comparative bioavailability study with Subutex.  
• 
Accelerated procedure  
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest. Although the potential benefits of a one-weekly or four-weekly 
injections as opposed to daily administrations is clear, it was not considered that the proposed medicinal product 
would provide a major improvement over current therapies. 
2.6.  Quality aspects

2.6.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile filtered yellowish to yellow clear liquid aseptically filled into pre-sterilized, ready 
to use, 1 ml long, type I clear glass syringes with grey fluoropolymer coated bromobutyl elastomer, type I, 
plunger stoppers, and rigid needle shields. 
Buvidal  finished  product  is  formulated  as  weekly  or  monthly  depots,  both  containing  the  active  substance 
buprenorphine but in different delivery system compositions based on the proprietary FluidCrystal® injection 
depot technology. The FluidCrystal (FC) injection depot is a lipid-based liquid, with dissolved active substance 
buprenorphine,  that  can  be  injected  subcutaneously.  When  injected  into  the  subcutaneous  (SC)  or 
intramuscular (IM) tissue, the FC formulation absorbs interstitial aqueous body fluid and transforms from liquid 
to highly viscous (>>106 mPas) liquid crystal (LC) (or gel-like) phases in situ, which effectively encapsulate the 
active substance. This results in a slow and consistent release of buprenorphine, which can be controlled for a 
week or a month depending on the composition. 
Different drug product strengths are achieved by different syringe fill volumes. Buvidal for weekly administration 
contains 50mg/ml buprenorphine and Buvidal for monthly administration contains 356mg/ml buprenorphine. 
The compositions of each strength of either the weekly or monthly formulation are dose proportional. 
The pharmaceutical development of Buvidal was guided by the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) presented 
separately for the weekly (CAM2038 q1w) and the monthly (CAM2038 q4w) formulation.  
The composition consists of lipids and co-solvents. The lipids, soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) and glycerol 
dioleate (GDO), are the key excipients for the FC injection depot technology. These lipids are the key structure 
forming, release controlling components of the finished product.  
Polar organic co-solvents, ethanol for CAM2038 q1w and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) for CAM2038 q4w, are 
used to achieve appropriate product viscosity resulting in adequate manufacturability and injectability and may 
further aid in achieving appropriate solubility of the active substance in the formulation. The information 
provided on the solubility of buprenorphine in the individual lipid components and co-solvents is acceptable. The 
co-solvents are dissipated into the surrounding tissue upon injection of the drug product and are biocompatible 
(suitable for subcutaneous injection).  
The active substance encapsulated in the liquid crystal matrix after injection is released by a combination of 
simple diffusion and release kinetics due to the biodegradation of the lipid matrix in the SC (or IM) tissue. Clinical 
and non-clinical assessments of different FC based products have demonstrated similar pharmacokinetics (PK) 
for IM and SC injection sites, as well as between different SC injection sites. There is no indication during the 
studies conducted, that rubbing the skin over the depot site would have an adverse impact on the release of the 
buprenorphine from the depot. 
Depending on the ratio between the two lipids, different LC phases are formed with different properties 
regarding drug release rates. The LC phase is a water-in-oil phase, with an inherent property of absorbing only 
a certain amount of water up to the swelling limit and thereafter remaining unaltered upon further dilution. The 
LC phase is robust and stable within a broad temperature range. The LC gel is the in vivo functional release 
matrix and the structure of the gel in aqueous solution and as a function of temperature has been determined in 
vitro by Small-Angle X-ray Diffraction (SAXD) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Buprenorphine used as 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 16/116 
  
  
active substance in the CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w products is in the free base form because of the higher 
solubility in the drug product lipid matrices compared to the corresponding hydrochloric acid salt. Solubility of 
buprenorphine in the liquid lipid-based drug product formulation matrix is considered a critical material attribute 
to achieve the required buprenorphine concentration for the weekly and monthly dose of CAM2038 q1w and 
CAM2038 q4w, respectively.  
The chemical and physical compatibility of the active substance with the excipients (lipid matrix and solvent) 
was established in early phase R&D stability studies for the respective drug products. 
As  GDO  has  no  prior  use  in  registered  injectable  drug  products,  it  is  considered  a  novel  excipient  for  the 
parenteral route of administration. A risk assessment for use of GDO as a component in products based on the 
FC injection depot technology was undertaken, which included generation of primary toxicity and toxicokinetic 
data, as well as reference to relevant toxicity data in the scientific literature. The batch data provides further 
assurance that aflatoxins and pesticides are not of a critical concern, and justifies these are not included in the 
specification. In addition a commitment to test one batch of GDO annually for both aflatoxin and pesticides has 
been made and is included in the dossier. Full information regarding manufacture, characterisation and controls 
regarding GDO have been presented and are deemed satisfactory.  
CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w formulations of identical composition have been employed throughout Phases 
1  -  3  of  the  clinical  development  programme.  The  products  used  in  Phase  3  clinical  trials  and  the  product 
intended for commercial use are presented in pre-filled syringes (PFS), where different strengths, or doses, are 
achieved  by  different  syringe  fill  volumes.  During  the  early  development  phase  (Phases  1-2),  the  CAM2038 
formulations were provided in vials, and administered by means of a disposable syringe. The respective drug 
substance  and  drug  product  manufacturing  sites  used  throughout  the  development  were  explained.  The 
manufacturing process employed is similar for all sites, and is equivalent for batches used for Phase 3 clinical 
trials and those intended for commercial manufacture. 
The development of the product has been described, the choice of excipients is justified and their functions 
explained. The development batches are from clinical trial studies and stability studies. These batches  were 
manufactured at a different manufacturing site than the proposed commercial site, however the manufacturing 
processes  are  similar  and  comparative  in  vitro  dissolution  profiles  show  that  the  manufacturing  sites  are 
comparable.  
The composition of the finished product was guided by performing in vitro and in vivo PK studies. The critical 
quality attributes (CQAs) and the related material attributes listed in the respective QTTPs have been evaluated 
and the criticality of each identified material attribute related to formulation performance was determined and 
accompanied by a justification and control strategy where required. The following CQAs were identified during 
the formulation development: 
•  The weight ratio of SPC/GDO in the formulation. 
•  Mono-, di, and triglycerides in GDO are known to affect the release controlling properties of the FC injection 
depot system. These are controlled in the GDO specification.  
•  Mono- and triglycerides in SPC are known to affect the release controlling properties of the FC injection 
depot system. These are controlled in the SPC specification.  
•  The  ethanol  content  in  CAM2038  q1w  and  NMP  content  in  CAM2038  q4w  significantly  affects  the 
formulation viscosity and hence the injectability and the manufacturability.  
The ratio of SPC/GDO was identified as a CQA; it was determined and optimised by in vitro release experiments 
and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in rat as evaluation tools, respectively. Based on the combined in vitro 
release and multiple in vivo rat PK studies, it was concluded that the selected SPC/GDO weight ratio is 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 17/116 
  
  
appropriate with respect to functional release properties of CAM2038 q1w.  For the CAM2038 q4w formulation, 
the combined in vitro and in vivo results support a compositionally robust formulation with respect to drug 
release properties and the selected SPC/GDO weight ratio. Importantly, no observations of burst release (or 
dose dumping) have been detected for the CAM2038 q4w formulation in any non-clinical studies performed 
during formulation development. The drug release properties were shown to be robust during shelf-life as 
evidenced by the absence of change of the in vitro release profiles during stability studies as well as in vivo rat 
PK data comparing a freshly prepared formulation with aged formulation stored for 24 months at 25 °C / 60% 
RH. No significant difference in any PK parameter was observed between the fresh and aged CAM2038 q1w or 
CAM2038 q4w formulation.  
The same composition containing SPC and GDO in the above weight ratios has been used in human PK studies 
and throughout clinical development and confirmed to possess the desired drug release profile.  
The results for the CAM2038 q1w formulation and the corresponding placebo formulation (equivalent SPC/GDO 
weight ratio) show that the LC gel structure practically does not change within the temperature interval 25 °C to 
42 °C, demonstrating good robustness of the in vivo functional release matrix at a temperature 5 °C above 
normal body temperature. Importantly, the LC phases formed by the SPC/GDO lipid mixtures in contact with 
aqueous media are thermodynamic equilibrium phases and hence, will always form independent of the way the 
lipid formulation or the lipid formulation/water mixture has been prepared. 
A number of solvents and solvent mixtures were evaluated for use as co-solvents in the formulations. Ethanol 
was found to be the most suitable to achieve the desired viscosity in the weekly formulation whereas NMP was 
more suitable for the monthly formulation due to the increased drug load required for that formulation. The 
levels of the co-solvents, EtOH and NMP, have been studied in relation to viscosity, injectability (injection time 
and force) and in vitro release profiles. It was found that, within a broad concentration range, the EtOH or NMP 
content has no significant effect on the drug release properties whereas it was concluded that their content is a 
critical material attribute with regard to injectability properties for the respective formulations.  
An in vitro release (IVR) dissolution method has been developed and the development has been sufficiently 
described.  The  dissolution  apparatus  and  operating  conditions  were  selected  based  on  Ph.  Eur.  2.9.3.  The 
dissolution medium was selected to enable measuring the dissolution profile, under sink conditions, within an 
acceptable  time-period.  Since  the  dissolution  rate  of  buprenorphine  is  affected  by  the  pH  of  the  dissolution 
medium the solubility of buprenorphine in different aqueous media was determined. The QC dissolution medium 
was  selected  to  obtain  a  reasonable  dissolution  rate  for  the  respective  target  duration  (one  week  and  one 
month), with acceptable discriminating capability. Sampling time points for the QC method were agreed.  The 
conditions for the sample preparation and the proposed QC dissolution test have been described and the controls 
in place to reduce and minimise the variability of the gel monolith depot geometry and surface area can be 
accepted. The dissolution method is the basket apparatus (Ph. Eur.) Sampling points are clearly defined.  
The discriminatory power of the method was demonstrated by investigating the lipid composition i.e., the weight 
ratio between the two release controlling excipients, SPC and GDO. It was shown that the differences observed 
in the release profiles in vivo for CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w made with different SPC/GDO ratios were 
accurately detected by the IVR method. Therefore, the method is considered to be sufficiently discriminating. 
Also, the linear relationship between the in vitro release data and the human PK study further supports the 
dissolution method and specification limits. 
The finished product manufacturing process is straightforward, comprising only conventional pharmaceutical 
processing  steps,  i.e.,  weighing  and  dissolving  of  raw  materials,  sterile  filtration,  filling  and  closing,  visual 
inspection, labelling, assembly in the safety device and secondary packaging. The critical process parameters 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 18/116 
  
  
were  identified.  The  sterilisation  method  is  sterile  filtration.  Based  on  assessments  made  during  product 
development, a combination of sterile filtration, pre-sterilized containers and aseptic processing for sterilization 
of CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w drug products is used. To ascertain the most suitable sterilisation method, 
the decision tree for sterilisation of non-aqueous liquids, semi-solid or dry powder products was employed as 
stipulated in the Guideline on the Sterilisation of the Medicinal Product, Active Substance, Excipient and Primary 
Container  (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/850374/2015).  A  risk  assessment  on  the  impact  of  different 
sterilisation methods on the assembled CAM2038 drug product was carried out to investigate the effect of each 
sterilisation  process  would  have  on  the  individual  drug  product  components  e.g.  formulation,  glass  barrel, 
needle shield and plunger stopper. From the assessment, sterile filtration was the only process compatible with 
CAM2038 drug product. Sterilization at elevated temperatures, i.e., steam and dry-heat sterilization, results in 
solvent  evaporation  from  the  formulation.  In  addition,  steam  sterilization  is  not  generally  suitable  for 
hygroscopic non-aqueous lipid formulations, and might lead to increased water uptake by the product. Gamma 
irradiation is known to cause degradation of unsaturated lipids and is therefore unsuitable for the (unsaturated) 
lipid-based  drug  product  formulation.  Gamma  irradiation  is  also  known  to  cause  discoloration  of  the 
borosilicate-based  clear-glass  syringes.  It  was  concluded  that  that  the  proposed  method  of  sterilization  is 
suitable,  it  does  not  compromise  the  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of  the  product  and  thus  is  considered 
acceptable. 
There had been non-compliance GMP issues at the development manufacturing site and as a result of that, a 
different site is proposed as the commercial finished product manufacturing site. The risk assessment provided 
in relation to the development site adequately addressed concerns in view of cross contamination, quality 
oversight and sterilization procedures, and data integrity in relation to analytical testing and in reporting 
analytical results. Considering that the finished product is no longer manufactured at the development site and 
no product will be released from this site, the presented information can be accepted. In addition, the main 
differences between the commercial and development sites were discussed and none of them have any impact 
on the CQAs. Furthermore, comparative batch analyses (including in vitro dissolution profiles) were presented 
on 3 full scale batches from the development and commercial site. Based on the presented information, the 
manufacturing processes are considered similar for all sites and are equivalent for batches used for Phase 3 
clinical trials and commercial batches.  
The product is provided in single-dose pre-filled sterile syringe (Type I, clear glass), stainless steel staked needle 
and rubber needle shield and a bromobutyl plunger stopper. The filled syringe is assembled in a safety device for 
post-injection needlestick prevention. Both the pre-filled syringe, assembled in the safety device and the 
plunger rod are co-packaged in a secondary pack. The pre-filled syringe (PFS) components include the syringe 
barrel with staked needle, rigid needle shield (RNS) and plunger stoppers and are delivered pre-sterilised and 
are ready-to-use. Relevant studies performed to verify the suitability of the container closure including 
extractables and leachables, moisture ingress, container closure integrity, elemental impurities, safety device 
functionality, extractable volume, injectability and Human Factors Engineering (HFE) have been presented and 
are considered satisfactory. Ethanol loss over time has been specifically discussed. The origin of the ethanol loss 
during storage and potential mitigation measures, have been thoroughly investigated and it is concluded that 
there is no safety or efficacy concern related to the ethanol loss within a large range. This justification is 
sufficient as it is not expected that any loss would exceed this margin. In addition, any changes to the container 
closure system potentially affecting the product quality will be evaluated in terms of ethanol loss and if such 
changes are warranted they will be introduced through, at minimum, a Type 1B variation application. 
The primary packaging has been the same throughout late phase development and clinical Phase 3. The only 
difference is the needle shield which has been changed to a Datwyler FM 27/0 rubber formulation. The needle 
Assessment report

shield type is considered critical because it relates to ethanol loss. The proposed needle shield provides better 
protection and significantly reduces ethanol loss.  
Novel excipient  
Glyceryl dioleate  
Glyceryl dioleate (GDO) appears as an off-white solid at 15 °C or a colourless to slightly yellow liquid at 25 °C, 
with  the  molecular  formula  C39H72O5  and  a  molecular  weight  of  620.99  g/mol.  GDO  is  a  mixture  of 
glyceryl-1,2-dioleate and glyceryl-1,3-dioleate and the respective structures are shown in Figure 2.  
  Glyceryl-1,2-dioleate   
  Glyceryl-1,3-dioleate 
Figure 2. Structure of Glyceryl dioleate 
It is derived from the partial esterification of glycerol (also referred to as glycerine) with oleic acid followed by 
subsequent purification processes including distillation. 
The specification for GDO is based on the Ph. Eur. monograph for Glycerol Mono- oleates (01/2008:1430) with 
the limits being adjusted to account for the chemical differences in the two materials. A comparison table is 
provided below in  below which demonstrates the similarity between the specifications.  
The limits applied to the specification for GDO are appropriate for this grade of material and are aligned to those 
for Glycerol mono-oleates. Additional tests are added to the specification and the limits applied to heavy metals, 
bio-burden  and  endotoxins  are  judged  appropriate  for  the  parenteral  application.  Batch  analysis  data  are 
presented for three batches of GDO. Batches confirm compliance with all control specifications.  
GDO is packaged in conventional lacquer-lined steel drums with non-vented, pre-lacquered steel bungs. The 
lacquer used for the lining of the steel drums is based on a  phenolic resin dissolved in a mixture of organic 
solvents  with  a  dispersed  titanium  dioxide  pigment.  It  is  stated  that  the  lacquer  complies  with  current  US 
regulations 21 CFR 175.300 (for resinous and polymeric coatings for use as the contact surface of articles for 
packaging foodstuffs) as well as EU regulation (EC) 1935/2004 (on the use of coatings intended to come into 
contact with foodstuffs) and EC directive 94/62/EC (Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations). 
18 months ICH stability data at 25 °C / 60% RH and 30 °C / 65% RH and 9 months at 40 °C / 75% RH has been 
submitted in support of the claimed retest period. The material is stored in identical packaging to that for the 
sale and distribution of the finished GDO substance. Stability samples have been tested against the specification 
and using validated methods that have been provided. All results  currently  available  are  within  specification 
and no unexpected trends are observed. These data demonstrate that the proposed retest period of 24 months 
for GDO is appropriate.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing processes comprise conventional pharmaceutical processing steps, i.e., weighing, 
dissolving, sterile filtration, filling, closing, visual inspection, labelling, assembly in safety device and secondary 
packaging. The process and process controls are schematically described in Figure 3.   
Figure 3: Manufacturing scheme for Buvidal manufacturing processes. 
The following process parameters were identified as critical: mixing time, mixing tank tightness, sterile 
filtration, fill volume and the unit operations are controlled by suitable in-process controls. The manufacturing 
process is regarded as non-standard because it comprises sterilisation by filtration, therefore validation data on 
three consecutive full scale batches by the proposed finished product manufacturer have been provided 
according to the Guideline on process validation for finished products, 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012.  
Syringe barrels with staked needle and rigid needle shield are delivered by the supplier pre-sterilised by ethylene 
oxide (EtO) and ready to use. The provided sterilisation validation & re-validation reports conform with 
harmonised standard EN ISO 11135-1:2007 concerning EtO sterilisation of devices and thus, fulfil the Medical 
Device Directive ANNEX 1 requirements. The plunger stoppers are also delivered pre-sterilized and 
ready-to-use. The stoppers are sterilised by steam (autoclave) at 121.1 °C for 60 minutes, in line with the Ph. 
Eur. requirements and no further information is considered necessary.  
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 21/116 
  
  
 
The manufacturing process validation is satisfactory and the manufacturing process is considered validated. In 
conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is sufficiently robust to provide assurance 
that finished product of consistent quality, complying with the specification, is produced. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  and  limits  for  appearance  (visual), 
identification  of  buprenorphine  (HPLC,  UV-DAD),  assay  (HPLC-UV),  degradation  products  (HPLC-UV),  water 
content  (Ph.  Eur.),  ethanol  content  (GC),  viscosity  (Ph.  Eur.),  in  vitro  release  (Ph.  Eur.),  gelling  properties 
(visual),  uniformity  of  dosage  forms  (Ph.  Eur.),  fill  volume  (weight  control), sub-visible  particles  (Ph.  Eur.), 
break-loose force (ISO 11040), gliding force (ISO 11040), sterility (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) 
and container closure integrity (dye ingression test). 
The  specification  limits  were  determined  based  on  the  mean  results  of  82  batches  (CAM2038q1w)  and  47 
batches (CAM2038q4w) from development batches and stability batches. The same batches were used in the 
safety and efficacy studies. 
Norbuprenorphine is the main degradation product but is also the main buprenorphine metabolite. According to 
ICH Q3B(R2), degradation products that are also significant metabolites present in animal and/or human studies 
are generally considered qualified. 
An elemental impurities risk assessment has been performed according to ICH Q3D. The levels of elemental 
impurities in the finished product are within safe levels, well below 30% of the proposed ICH Q3D PDES. The risk 
for the patient is considered negligible and no further action to control elemental impurities in the finished 
product is required.  
The finished product is released on the market following traditional finished product release testing. The 
procedures for analytical methods used were provided. Non-compendial analytical methods were validated 
according to current ICH guidance. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the 
routine analysis of finished product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 3 commercial scale batches per strength from the proposed manufacturer was 
provided. In addition, batch results from 2-5 batches for each strength from the development site have also 
been presented.  All results obtained are within the proposed limits and any out of specification results have 
been satisfactorily discussed or justified as appropriate. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from two commercial scale batches from the proposed manufacturer for the 8 mg and 32 mg 
strengths and from one batch of the 16 mg and 24 mg of CAM2038 q1w have been presented. Stability data from 
two commercial scale batches from the proposed manufacturer for the 64 mg and 160 mg (not intended for 
marketing, but produced during development) strengths and from one batch from the 96 mg and 128 mg of 
CAM2038 q4w have also been presented. Since Buvidal is available in multiple strengths accomplished by filling 
different volumes of the same formulation in the same pre-filled syringe, the proposed bracketing approach in 
terms of number of batches tested per strength is considered acceptable as per the ICH guideline Q1D 
‘Bracketing and Matrixing Designs for Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products’.  
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 22/116 
  
  
The stability batches were stored in horizontal position which was argued to be the worst case scenario by risk 
assessment regarding the syringe orientation. This justification was accepted. Data were generated under 
long-term conditions (25 °C/60% RH, 30 °C/65% RH) for up to 9 months and under accelerated conditions at 
(40 °C/75% RH) for up to 6 months according to the ICH guidelines. Stability samples were tested for 
appearance, assay, degradation products, water content, ethanol content, viscosity, in vitro release, sub-visible 
particles, break-loose force (ISO 11040), gliding force and sterility. 
For both formulations, appearance, particulate matter, sterility and container closure integrity complied with the 
requirements for all strengths and all time points studied. For the buprenorphine assay and in vitro release 
parameters, no discernible trends were observed over time. Water content and the total amount of degradation 
products showed some increase with storage time and temperature but all levels are within the proposed 
specification limits. Ethanol content, viscosity, break-loose and gliding force parameters which are all linked and 
affect the injectability of the product were also within the specifications. 
Supportive data from the development manufacturing site have also been presented for seven batches of 8 mg 
strength, three batches of the 16 mg strength and five batches of the 32 mg strength from the weekly 
formulation. From the monthly formulation, the supportive data come from four batches of the 64 mg, three 
batches of the 160 mg and one of the 192 mg strength (not intended for marketing but manufactured during 
development).  Samples were stored for up to 24 months under the long-term condition (25 °C / 60% RH), and 
6 months under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH). The results of the supportive stability studies were 
consistent with the results of the pivotal stability studies. 
A photostability study according to ICH Q1B ‘Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products’ 
(November 1996) was performed on two pilot batches of the weekly formulation (8 mg and 32 mg strengths) 
and two pilot batches of the monthly formulation (64 mg and 192 mg strengths). Parameters tested were 
appearance, assay, degradation products, viscosity and in vitro release. The results of light exposed product in 
the primary packaging alone, compared to the control samples, showed no or negligible change for all 
parameters tested except for a slight increase in the specified degradation product norbuprenorphine. It was 
concluded that the product in the primary packaging and an outer carton representative of commercial 
secondary packaging, is stable when exposed to light. 
The proposed shelf-life is based on the available real-time data of the pivotal stability study (up to 9 months 
long-term and 6 months accelerated condition) and the statistical evaluation performed. The shelf-life is further 
supported by the consistency of the stability data from the supportive studies with up to 24 months. In addition 
the first three production batches will be placed on long term stability studies through the proposed shelf life and 
on accelerated studies for 6 months. 
The proposed shelf-life of 18 months with the precaution “Do not refrigerate or freeze” (SmPC 6.3 and 6.4) has 
been adequately justified is considered acceptable.

2.6.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The development of the formulation system has been adequately described.

The use of novel excipient glycerol dioleate (GDO) has been justified and sufficient information on the 
manufacture, control and stability of GDO has been presented in the dossier. The proposed in vitro release (IVR) 
method has been shown to be suitable for the quality control and stability studies of the product. The finished 
product manufacturing process has been validated. The container closure system is considered suitable for this 
type of product and its intended use as per the SmPC. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.6.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.6.6.  Recommendation for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following point for investigation: 
- any future changes in any component of the container closure system that could possibly affect quality of the 
product, but specifically any change in needle shield type, will have to be investigated in terms of ethanol loss. 
These changes will have to be introduced by Type IB variation as minimum. 
2.7.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.7.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which was 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. In addition, the applicant conducted some safety 
pharmacology and pharmacokinetics studies. The general toxicology programme consisted of single and repeat 
dose toxicity studies in the dog and 1 study in the mini-pig. For genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive 
and developmental toxicity, bridging studies in the mouse, rat and rabbit were used to cross-refer to the findings 
described in the Subutex label. 
In addition to the studies conducted with the active drug, single dose studies were conducted with the excipients 
GDO and NMP in rats and rabbits, and repeat dose studies with GDO, NMP and the FluidCrystal® vehicle. 
Genotoxicity studies were performed with the novel excipient GDO. 
The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has 
been discussed and was considered acceptable.

2.7.2.  Pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that BPN is a partial agonist with high affinity at µ-opioid receptors in the 
CNS, which are thought to be responsible for the therapeutic effects. However, BPN also has mixed but primarily 
antagonistic properties with high affinity at κ-receptors and weak affinity at and δ-opioid receptors. As a result 
of the high affinity partial agonist action of BPN at µ-receptors, commonly abused opiates (full agonists) are 
unable to displace BPN and therefore do not exert an effect if taken concomitantly. At ORL-1 (nociceptin) 
receptors BPN is a partial agonist, which is thought to be involved in the ability to treat opioid dependence.   
A single study from published literature conducted in multiple species following SC injections of BPN showed that 
mice, rats, and cats displayed an increase in activity whilst guinea pigs and monkeys exhibited a decrease in 
activity.  
Studies in humans show that a metabolite of BPN, NBPN, is also active at opioid receptors with high affinity for 
µ- and κ-receptors and lower affinity for δ-receptors. However, NBPN has weak pharmacodynamics activity as 
it is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and therefore has low CNS permeability.    
The secondary pharmacodynamic effects of BPN have been well established in the clinical setting and include 
CNS and respiratory depression. Considering this and the available information on this provided in the approved 
Subutex label the absence of secondary pharmacodynamic studies for the proposed formulation is accepted. 
Potential secondary pharmacology effects of the NMP solvent used in the Q4W formulations included CNS and 
respiratory depression. Although there is potential overlap of these effects with those seen with BPN use it is 
accepted that there exists a margin of exposure from the NOAELs compared to the NMP exposure levels seen in 
patients. Furthermore, these effects are more pronounced when administered via inhalation than SC injection. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
In vitro studies performed using human embryonic kidney cells and Chinese Hamster ovary cells demonstrated 
a concentration dependent increase in hERG potassium current inhibition for both BPN and NBPN. In hNav1.5 
(sodium) peak and late current, hCav1.2 (L-type) calcium and the hKvLQT1/hminK channels inhibition was seen 
with both BPN and NBPN, although the safety margins indicate that this is not clinically relevant.    
Results from the two 8-week in vivo studies conducted in dogs were varied with one showing no effect on QT 
interval but an increase in heart rate, whilst another showed a decrease in heart rate. Neither of these studies 
contained control groups and in TK-12-448 heart rate was not measured pre-dose, so it is difficult to accurately 
draw any conclusions from these studies.  In the 18-week study no effects on heart rate or QT interval were seen 
and the 9-month study showed a decrease in heart rate and a dose related prolongation of the QT interval after 
the first dose but was not observed thereafter. However, ECGs were not performed regularly throughout the 
studies so it is difficult to ascertain how long these effects lasted. QT prolongation is a well-known effect of BPN 
and therefore given the well-established clinical use, is acceptable. 
The novel excipient was tested for CNS safety in a modified Irwin test up to a dose of 1000 mg/kg with no 
behavioural or functional differences noted at any dose for the duration of the study. CNS endpoints were 
investigated and no significant safety concerns were observed.

EMA/693347/2018 
Page 25/116 
  
  
2.7.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The rat, dog, and mini-pig were chosen as species to evaluate the PK profile. The PK profile in rats and dogs is 
similar at the dose intervals examined and the metabolism of BPN in the rat and dog are similar to that seen in 
humans. 
In 6 rat studies, it was noted that on examination of the subcutaneous tissue at the site of the injections, that 
instead of a single depot being reported there were often a number of adjacent located depots. However, in 
some cases, no depots were found (Study 14-517, 1 rat per group that received mechanical challenge to the 
injection sites. No discussion has been provided on how the presence of several depots instead of a single depot, 
may have influenced release of the active substance from the depots and the pharmacokinetic parameters. The 
Applicant has performed an additional study showing that administration of two separate injections instead of 
one resulted in a group mean with a higher Cmax and AUC and a lower Tmax as would be expected given the larger 
surface area, however none of the pharmacokinetic parameters from two injection animals were significantly 
different to those that resulted from a single injection. It was not recorded in the original studies as to whether 
the injections formed single or multiple depots in dogs.   
In studies PK-14-509 and PK-14-517 using CAM2038 q1w and q4w in rats it is stated that at the time points of 
mechanical challenge at 1 and 6 hours post-dose, that the gelling process of the depot was ongoing and that at 
8 and 14 days post-dose the depot was in a completely gelled form. An in vitro model has been used to 
demonstrate that the gelling process begins shortly after contact with water, and the time taken has little effect 
on the controlled release parameter of the drug product.   
Single dose CAM2038 q1w 
In rats, there was rapid absorption with BPN concentrations detectable within 30 minutes of administration. 
Mean peak plasma concentrations were achieved within approximately 0.5-3.76 days, although an initial peak 
tended to be obtained from 6-24 hours post-dose with a second reached at around 5 days. Exposure of BPN 
increased approximately proportionally to dose. Half-life increased with increasing doses and volumes which 
was thought to be likely due to slower degradation of the higher dose volumes of the depot matrix. However, 
there was a large variability in the estimates of terminal t1/2 and therefore it is difficult to draw conclusions 
based on these results. . It is accepted that the secondary peak seen on the plasma concentration curves is due 
to variability in release of BPN from the CAM2038 depot matrix. The peaks are unlikely to be associated with 
exaggerated pharmacology or toxicity.  
BPN was quantifiable in most animals for the entire duration of all studies, therefore the applicant may not have 
extended the studies sufficiently to accurately capture the time course of the elimination of BPN from CAM2038 
q1w. 
Bioavailability in rats was estimated at over 100% which is considered unrealistic, this may have resulted from 
an underestimation of AUC after IV administration or an overestimation of the AUC for the SC formulation.  
After mechanical challenges of rubbing or squeezing the injection site, Cmax and AUCinf were similar to each 
other, but higher than the control group. The applicant has stated that external manipulation of the injection site 
had no effect on the release of BPN, although these experimental conditions are not considered to be a 
worst-case scenario. It is accepted that the depots are not altered substantially following mechanical challenge. 
Administration via the IM route in rats resulted in a faster and higher initial exposure however, the overall total 
exposure was similar for both administration routes.  
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 26/116 
  
  
The effect of storage of CAM2038 q1w was investigated in rats, with PK parameters largely consistent except for 
Tmax and t 1/2 which were faster following administration of the freshly prepared CAM2038 q1w.  
In dogs, no single dose studies were conducted with a clinically relevant formulation of CAM2038 q1w, therefore 
the data is considered to be of limited value. Similar to the rat studies there was rapid initial release of BPN, with 
mean Tmax values ranging from 15-72 hours (mean values). The applicant states that Cmax increased 
proportionally with dose volume and therefore proportionally with depot surface area. However, there was no 
report of examination of injection sites and therefore it is not known if there was one or multiple depots, so a 
surface area calculation cannot be made. Total exposure was proportional to dose volume. Half-life increased 
with increasing doses. 
In mini-pigs there no single dose studies conducted with a clinically relevant formulation, therefore the data is 
considered to be of limited value. Tmax was achieved in approximately 1 day and t 1/2 at 2.7 days.  
Repeat dose CAM2038 q1w 
There was a large amount of variability following repeat-doses of CAM2038 q1w in dogs. Cmax, t 1/2 and AUC 
increased with dose but not proportionally. Tmax was similar for the 15 mg and 30 mg dose groups after the 
second dose. Accumulation ratios indicated a potential for accumulation in some animals.  
Steady state was stated by the applicant to be achieved by day 85 in a 9-month study, however there were only 
3 time points taken for PK analysis at day 1, 141 and 225 so it is difficult to elucidate whether this calculation is 
accurate. 
Bioavailability was calculated as 156% in males and 130% in females, which is considered to be unrealistic.  
Single dose CAM2038 q4w 
Like the CAM2038 q1w formulation a small initial peak was followed by a second larger peak with the CAM2038 
q4w formulation. In the PK-14-517 rat study, after mechanical challenge Tmax (range 4.99-21 days) appeared to 
become more variable compared to the control group (8.05-14.0 days). Half-life was variable across all groups. 
Cmax was similar for the control group and the group that had the injection site squeezed at 1 hour before 
sampling at 6 hours and 8 days post-dose, while AUCinf was similar for the control, the group that had the 
injection site rubbed after dosing and the group that was squeezed at 1 hour before sampling at 24 hours and 
14 days post-dose. In all but 1 group there were individual animals that had the percentage of AUC estimated 
by extrapolation of the terminal phase as greater than 20%. 
Plasma profile and PK parameters were similar for both stored and fresh CAM2038 q4w. 
In dogs, no single dose studies were conducted with a clinically relevant formulation of CAM2038 q4w, therefore 
the data is considered to be of limited value. There was a large amount of variability between animals with the 
Cmax ranging from 8.5-75.6 ng/mL, Tmax 0.2-240 hours, AUCinf 2715-3619 and t 1/2 117-367 hours. BPN was 
detectable at all time points throughout the study indicating that the applicant may not have accurately captured 
the elimination profile. 
Repeat dose CAM2038 q4w 
Following repeated doses of CAM2038 q4w there was a high level of variability in plasma concentrations and 
AUC, however mean systemic exposure increased approximately proportionally with dose.  
In the TO-13-489 study, absorption was rapid with BPN quantifiable at the first sampling time of 30 minutes, 
Cmax was achieved after the first dose at 4 hours for the 64 mg dose and 5 hours for the 128 mg dose. However, 
following the 128 mg dose in TO-15-531 the Cmax was achieved at a mean of 30.4 hours. Mean exposures in 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 27/116 
  
  
females were greater than in males but this was attributed to data variability rather than differences in 
absorption or elimination. Accumulation ratios were variable but high.  
In TO-15-531 steady state was stated to be achieved on day 85, however the Ctrough values for the 160 mg and 
the 192 mg doses appear to be increasing throughout the study. The Applicant has withdrawn the 160 dosefrom 
the marketing authorisation application, therefore the highest dose available is 128 mg. The accumulation ratio 
for the 128 mg dose is approximately 1.4 after steady state is reached at around Day 85. It is accepted that 
there is minimal accumulation for this dose. 
Bioavailability was calculated as exceeding 100% in both sexes.    
BPN is approximately 96% plasma protein bound, with relatively higher concentrations in the brain than other 
compartments. Following IV administration BPN is distributed to the skin, muscle, fat, lung, spleen, liver, and 
kidney, with higher levels observed in the lung, spleen, muscle, and fat compared to blood. No discussion is 
included on how BPN is distributed following SC administration.  
BPN is metabolised by CYP 3A4 to a primary metabolite NBPN. BPN and NBPN undergo enterohepatic circulation 
after conjugation with glucuronide. Ratios of systemic exposure to NBPN in relation to BPN were calculated in 
repeat dose studies as 0.7-12%. The metabolic pathway in humans is consistent with that in animals. 
The elimination of BPN is bi- or tri-exponential with a long terminal elimination phase of 20-25 hours, due to its 
highly lipophilic nature and to reabsorption of the conjugated derivative. Elimination of BPN is primarily by biliary 
excretion of the glucuronide conjugates in the faeces.  
Pharmacokinetic interactions may occur when BPN is given concomitantly with agents that affect CYP3A4 
activity.  
In rats, the plasma concentration of GDO remained relatively constant, and similar to the control group with no 
notable difference between the endogenous pre-dose and post-dose GDO levels. Exposures were similar across 
increasing doses and similar to control.  
In vitro NMP showed a rapid initial release over 24 hours followed with a slower release resulting in 100% 
release over 1 week. In rats NMP Cmax increased with dose but was less than proportional to dose level. AUC 
increased with dose but was more than proportional to dose level, exposure was higher in females than males. 
Data from the literature confirm the applicant’s findings. The Applicant has demonstrated that there is little 
difference in exposures in rats following administration from the oral and IV routes. Additionally, exposure to 
NMP in humans is not significantly different between males and females when administered subcutaneously and 
therefore the difference in exposure following subcutaneous administration in rats is not clinically relevant. 
In rabbits, the Tmax of NMP was around 1 hour, with t 1/2 increasing with dose. AUC increased with dose and 
appeared to be more than proportional to dose level, whilst Cmax increased proportionally to dose level. 
2.7.4.  Toxicology 
Single and repeat dose toxicity 
Acute toxicity of CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w were performed in dogs and minipigs. In dogs, signs of 
reduced activity, trembling, ataxia, salivation, weight loss, soft faeces and hunched posture were seen in doses 
up to 192 mg. Swelling and tenderness was observed around injection sites which were associated with cystic 
spaces with granulomatous inflammation, with macrophages and occasional multinucleated giant cells. Some 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 28/116 
  
  
spaces contained yellow pigment thought to be the test item. Surrounding the spaces and inflammation were 
fibrous capsules. In mini-pigs the only clinical sign was weight loss seen at a dose of 20 mg. Injection sites 
reactions were similar to the dogs, with swelling, SC cystic spaces and fibrosis associated with granulomatous 
inflammation.  
Single dose toxicity was also reviewed for the GDO and NMP excipients.  GDO demonstrated low toxicity, limited 
to injection site reactions.  NMP again showed site reactions with mild findings of degeneration and ulceration.   
Repeat-dose toxicity of the CAM2038 products was evaluated in 4 studies in Beagle dogs. Animals received fixed 
doses corresponding to clinically relevant doses of CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w.  In addition, studies were 
completed to review the toxicity of GDO (rat) and of FluidCrystal (rat, dog, minipig).  The safety of NMP was 
reviewed from evidence from published literature.   
In repeat dose studies BPN in both CAM2038 q1w and q4w formulations, has been examined in dogs treated via 
SC injection for up to 9 months duration.  
Treatment with the CAM2038 products resulted in decreased activity, sedation, soft faeces, inappetence and 
weight loss, salivation, and abnormal gait. Vocalisation and aggressive behaviour were also observed but this 
occurred largely on dosing days. For the 9-month study a mild heart rate reduction and QT prolongation were 
observed post-dose on day 1. All are expected clinical signs with BPN. In addition, in this study beginning on Day 
169 the dogs required sedation prior to the administration of the q4w formulations, including the vehicle control, 
to alleviate injection-related discomfort as the dogs noted to have increased vocalisation immediately 
dose-dosing and aggressive behaviour. This behaviour was only associated with the q4w formulation and was 
also evident in the vehicle control animals. The data presented by the applicant suggest that the vocalisation and 
aggressive behaviour was evident from the beginning of this study and was not limited to just the NMP 
formulation with incidences also occurring in the CAM2038 q1w administered animals.  Microscopic examination 
of the injection sites did not differ between any of the formulations including placebo not containing NMP.  Taken 
together the data presented does not suggest local tolerance issues with the presence of NMP in the formulation. 
An increase in neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes was seen in one study, with a reduction in white blood 
cells and neutrophils for males only in another. Vacuolation of the axillary lymph nodes was seen in animals 
treated for 9 months with the CAM2038 q1w product as well as those treated with placebo CAM2038 q1w and 
q4w.  
Injection site reactions were similar to those seen in the single dose toxicity, with swelling/thickening, erythema 
and tenderness. Cystic spaces with granulomatous inflammation with macrophages and occasional giant 
multinucleate cells surrounded by fibrosis were seen in all repeat dose studies. Necrosis was reported 
occasionally. Recovery of the injection sites was noted as the severity of changes decreased with age of injection 
site. There were no indications that multiple injections into the same injection site enhanced the inflammatory 
response from a previous injection. 
GDO 
Repeat dose studies were performed in rats for up to 26 weeks. Increased white blood cells, neutrophils, and 
fibrinogen with a decreased percentage of lymphocytes were observed as well as an increased spleen weight in 
both sexes and at a dose of 1000 mg/kg extramedullary haematopoiesis of the spleen. Inflammatory response 
in regional lymph nodes was also seen. 
Reactions at the injection site were oedema, sores, slight to moderate haemorrhage, ulceration, staining and 
scabbing. There was cystic granulomatous inflammation with a dose related trend, which was sometimes 
associated with necrosis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 29/116 
  
  
FluidCrystal® 
The FluidCrystal® vehicle has been examined in repeat dose studies in the rat (26 weeks), dog (8 weeks) and 
mini-pig (4 weeks). In the rat study, there was an increase in white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes and 
monocytes and fibrinogen concentration. A decrease in plasma protein and a shorter activated partial 
thromboplastin time, enlarged lymph nodes and extramedullary haematopoiesis. All animals had swelling at the 
injection site, with rats sometimes having more than 1 swelling at a site. Cystic spaces associated with 
granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis were common to all animals. Rats showed pigmented macrophages 
and occasional foamy macrophages. Both rats and dogs showed a trend towards recovery. 
NMP 
Following oral administration clinical signs were decreases in body weight and hypocellular bone marrow in both 
sexes, testicular degeneration in males and thymic atrophy in females. An increase in liver weight and hepatic 
centrilobular hypertrophy were also observed.  
Repeated inhalational exposure resulted in an increase in neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes. In animals 
that had died pulmonary oedema and congestion were observed, with haemorrhage, hypoplasia and necrotic 
haematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Atrophy and lymphoid cell depletion of the thymus, spleen and lymph 
nodes was seen in sacrificed animals  
The use of the solvent NMP in the Q4W formulation and the safety evaluation made by the applicant is 
considered acceptable. Although the NMP is rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation leading to a bolus 
exposure to high levels of NMP, it is administered once monthly and quickly eliminated (T1/2=3h), resulting in 
intermittent and not continuous exposure or accumulation of NMP. A safety margin exceeding 50 has been 
calculated for reproductive toxicity endpoints with NMP. 
Genotoxicity 
The overall conclusion based upon literature was that BPN and the excipient, NMP, were not genotoxic.  Studies 
completed with GDO were negative for genotoxic potential.  
Carcinogenicity 
No new carcinogenicity studies with BPN were performed. A bridging study was conducted for BPN to enable the 
applicant to rely on the carcinogenicity data in the Subutex label. Margins of exposure to humans based on 
exposure to mice and rats are acceptable. Given the extensive clinical use of BPN it is concluded that BPN is not 
carcinogenic. 
Carcinogenicity for DAG, (in support of GDO), SPC and NMP have been reviewed from the published literature, 
which conclude that there is no added risk for carcinogenicity due to exposure to these additional excipients.  
Reproduction toxicity 
The ability of BPN to produce reproductive and developmental toxicity is well characterised and described in the 
reference product. As no additional risk was anticipated when BPN is delivered by injection of the CAM2038 
products the applicant has not conducted additional studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 30/116 
  
  
Literature evidence has been supplied to describe the effects of SPC, GDO (DAG) and NMP on reproductive 
toxicity.  The influence of each excipient is not expected to unduly influence the overall risk for use during 
pregnancy and breastfeeding over that of BPN.  GDO/DAG show some marginal effects in developmental 
toxicity, although more significant effects are noted for NMP.  In rabbits, high dose NMP (540 mg/kg), an 
increase in post-implantation loss, altered foetal morphology and increased incidences of cardiovascular and 
skull malformations. At doses of 175 mg/kg and 540 mg/kg there was a reduction in maternal weight gain.  
Overall the doses required to achieve these effects well exceed that which would be seen during treatment with 
CAM2038, and would not deviate much from risks already characterised with BPN.   
Local tolerance 
The reactions at injection sites were similar across species and showed a tendency towards recovery. There 
appeared to be no difference in reaction between the 2 drug products or the FC vehicle. Repeat injections into 
the same site did not result in an increase in response.  
The reactions were inflammatory in nature and are expected given that a ‘foreign body’ is being injected 
subcutaneously.  
2.7.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted an incomplete Phase I assessment with a refined PEC calculation, based on maximum 
recommended doses of buprenorphine used chronically without tapering.  The refined PECSURFACeWATER was 0.003 
µg/L which is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. No further assessment in Phase II is required; however a PBT 
screening should be included as part of Phase I. Information on the log K ow of buprenorphine is recommended 
to be provided. 
2.7.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The presented non-clinical data package was a mixture of bibliographic information for buprenorphine available 
from the public domain, along with additional studies conducted with the product on safety pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology.  
A brief summary on the pharmacology of buprenorphine was provided from the literature, describing the mixed 
partial agonist activity at µ-opioid receptors and antagonistic activity at κ- and δ-opioid receptors. The major 
metabolite norbuprenorphine is also active at opioid receptors but has low CNS permeability as it is a substrate 
for P-glycoprotein. Secondary pharmacodynamics effect for BPN and NBPN were well characterised.  
In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate cardiovascular safety pharmacology with the CAM2038 
products showing an expected prolongation of the QT interval commensurate with the known effects of 
buprenorphine. A modified Irwin test in rats was conducted, with the excipient GDO, which did not highlight any 
safety concerns.  
The pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine are well characterised, however absorption of the CAM2038 products 
was investigated in studies using rats, dogs, and pigs. In a number of the rat studies multiple adjacent depots 
were observed, although these are not judged to affect the pharmacokinetics significantly.  It was clarified that 
the length of time taken for a fully gelled matrix to form has limited influence on pharmacokinetics.  
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 31/116 
  
  
There was rapid absorption of buprenorphine with levels detectable at 30 minutes in all animals. The time taken 
to attain mean peak plasma concentrations were variable, however, there appeared to be an initial peak 
between 6 and 24 hours, with a second reached at around 5 days in both rats and dogs. Exposure of 
buprenorphine increased approximately proportionally with dose, and half-life increased with increasing doses. 
However, there was large variability in terminal half-lives. Exposure to buprenorphine following mechanical 
challenge was higher than the control group although was of limited significant difference. 
The measurements of BPN in rats has been performed with an ELISA method which appears to have 
overestimated Cmax, at least in dog plasma, the LC-MS/MS method was determined to be more specific. 
Following repeated dosing there was a high level of variability in plasma concentrations and AUC, however mean 
systemic exposure increased approximately proportionally with dose. Accumulation ratios were variable but 
high.  
The distribution, metabolism and elimination of buprenorphine were described using published literature. 
Buprenorphine is approximately 96% protein bound, with relatively higher concentrations in the brain than 
other compartments. It is metabolised by CYP3A4 to a primary metabolite, norbuprenorphine. The metabolic 
pathway is similar between animals and humans. Elimination has a long terminal elimination phase due to its 
lipophilic nature and to reabsorption of the conjugated derivative. 
Exposure to GDO in rats showed that GDO plasma concentration remained relatively constant with no notable 
difference between endogenous pre- and post-dose levels. NMP showed a rapid initial release over 24 hours 
followed by a slower release resulting in 100% over 1 week.  
The toxicity of the CAM2038 products was investigated in dogs, with 1 non-GLP study in mini-pigs. The main 
findings with both CAM2038 q1w and q4w products were the expected signs of buprenorphine, including 
reduced activity, ataxia and weight loss. At the injection sites swelling and tenderness was observed which were 
associated with cystic spaces with granulomatous inflammation, with macrophages and occasional 
multinucleated giant cells. Some spaces contained yellow pigment thought to be the test item. Surrounding the 
spaces and inflammation were fibrous capsules. In the 9-month study with CAM2038 q1w vacuolation of the 
lymph nodes was observed.  
Studies performed with GDO and the FluidCrystal® vehicle showed similar signs at the injection sites with 
increases in white blood cells, neutrophils, and fibrinogen with a decreased percentage of lymphocytes were 
observed. Data from the literature was provided in support of NMP however, the data supplied addressed the 
oral and inhalational routes of administration. Decrease in body weight, testicular degeneration in males and 
thymic atrophy in females were noted as well as an increase in liver weight and hepatic centrilobular 
hypertrophy.  
The 9-month repeat dose toxicity study reported that from Day 169 the dogs required sedation prior to the 
administration of any of the CAM2038 q4w drug products due to increased vocalisation and aggressive 
behaviour. The data presented by the Applicant suggests that the vocalisation and aggressive behaviour was 
evident from the beginning of the study and was not limited to just the NMP formulation with incidences also 
occurring in the CAM2038 q1w administered animals. 
Carcinogenicity data from the published literature was provided for DAG in support of GDO, SPC and NMP. There

2.8.  Clinical aspects  
2.8.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.8.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The CAM2038 products q1w and the q4w differ in composition and release rates.  
Both products contain the same active entity, BPN, as the authorized SL products Subutex® and Suboxone® 
but are provided in a new FC formulation for SC injection.  
BPN PK following SC injection of CAM2038 has been investigated in 5 clinical studies, whereof 2 studies were 
conducted in healthy volunteers under naltrexone (NTX) blockage and 3 studies were conducted in patients with 
opioid dependence. 
Five clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to support the proposed dosing of CAM2038, and to support 
the bridging of clinical pharmacology data from SL  BPN (Subutex) to CAM2038. The PK of BPN and norBPN 
following administration of SC CAM2038 q1w and SC CAM2038 q4w were compared with data obtained after 
administration of SL BPN (Subutex and Suboxone) and after a single IV injection of BPN (Temgesic) in healthy 
volunteers under NTX blockage and patients. The PK parameters were estimated using standard NCA methods 
and are summarized across all studies in Table 9 for BPN and in Table 10 for norBPN. 
A population PK model of BPN was developed for evaluation of the influence of covariates on the PK of BPN and 
for simulations of different treatment schedules with CAM2038 q1w, CAM2038 q4w and SL BPN (Subutex).

The SL BPN reference product Subutex (UK-sourced, Indivior Ltd) was used as a comparator in the two healthy 
volunteer studies (HS-11-426 and HS-13-487) to support the hybrid application. The active comparator (SL 
BPN/NX  tablet,  Amneal  Pharmaceuticals)  used  in  the  pivotal  Phase  3  study  (HS-11-421)  was  considered 
appropriate and comparable to the UK sourced reference product (Subutex, Indivior Ltd) used in the PK studies 
in healthy volunteers (HS-11-426 and HS-13-487). 
Overall, the absolute BA of BPN was estimated between 163% and 172% after single SC administration of 8, 16 
and 32 mg CAM2038 q1w and was between 151% and 165% after administration of CAM2038 q4w. For SL 
Subutex, the absolute BA of BPN was 27-29% (8 mg), 20-22% (16 mg) and 19-21% (24 mg). Thus, the BA of 
BPN was approximately 6 to 9 times higher for CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w than for Subutex at comparable 
BPN exposure levels. These absolute BA values were based on plasma sampling up to 24 hours after IV BPN 
administration. Extending the plasma sampling to 48 hours after IV administration resulted in lower absolute BA 
of 130% for 96 mg CAM2038 q4w and 114% for 192 mg CAM2038 q4w.  
Mean BPN plasma concentration-time profiles after single IV injection of 0.6 mg Temgesic, single and repeated 
daily SL doses of 8 mg Subutex and weekly SC injections of 16 mg CAM2038 q1w and after single SC injection 
of 64 mg CAM2038 q4w and 4 repeated weekly SC injections of 16 mg CAM2038 q1w are shown in the Figures 
below.

CYP 3A4 is the main clearance pathway of buprenorphine therefore interactions with inhibitors or inducers are a 
concern and may differ depending on the dose route. UGT1A1 also appears to be a major clearance pathway 
thus inhibitors of this enzyme may affect the systemic exposure of BPN. 
Drug-drug interactions are expected between buprenorphine and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 resulting in 
increased Cmax and AUC of BPN and norBPN.  The PBPK model used to investigate the possible effect of CYP 3A4 
inhibitors and inducers on the exposure of buprenorphine following subcutaneous dosing is not adequate to 
support any dose adjustment or recommendation about the DDI in the SmPC. CYP3A4 inhibitors may inhibit the 
metabolism of buprenorphine resulting in increased Cmax and AUC of BPN and norBPN.  
CYP3A4 inducers may induce the metabolism of buprenorphine resulting in decreased BPN levels. At the 
expected plasma concentrations inhibition of P450 enzymes or drug transporters is not expected.  
The posology and transitions from daily doses of SL BPN to initial weekly doses of CAM2038 q1w or monthly 
doses of CAM2038 q4w were based on the results of the clinical PK studies and the population PK analysis (refer 
to the Section 3.3.2 for further details). 
The population PK model was used to extrapolate the PK data in subjects over 16 years of age. Some differences 
may be observed by comparing the data predicted in this population with the results observed in adults in the 
clinical study HS-13-487. Particularly, after treatment with 16 mg q1w, lower Cmax (ca. 40% and 30% for male 
and female, respectively) and AUC (ca. 26% and 22% for male and female, respectively) are predicted in 16 
years old patients compared with adult. Steady-state data are not available for 64 mg CAM2038 q4w. Lower 
Css,max and AUCss,τ were predicted following repeated monthly administration of 64 mg CAM2038 q4w to 
16-year-old males and females compared to observed Cmax and predicted AUCss,τ following a single dose to 
adults.

2.8.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The relationship between BNP plasma concentrations and blockade of the subjective opioid effects of 
hydromorphone has been explored in patients with moderate or severe opioid use disorder after 2 
administrations of SC CAM2038 q1w 24 mg and 32 mg to guide target concentrations. 
CAM2038 q1w was associated with a gradual increase in mean plasma BPN concentrations following the first 
(Day  0)  and  second  (Day  7)  administration  of  CAM2038  q1w  24  mg  and  32  mg  with  peak  concentrations 
observed  at  approximately  24  hours  post-dose.  BPN  plasma  concentrations  following  the  first  (Day  0)  dose 
gradually  decreased  with  the  lowest  values  observed  at  168  hours  post-dose,  prior  to  administration  of  the 
second (Day 7) dose. Plasma concentrations following the second administration of CAM2038 q1w were higher 
than those observed  following the  first dose of  CAM2038 q1w, which is likely related to BPN concentrations 
present at the time of the second injection. Peak and overall exposure to BPN was higher in the CAM2038 q1w 
32 mg treatment group compared with the CAM2038 q1w 24 mg group. 
In literature, modelling studies have suggested that a BPN plasma concentration from 2 to 3 ng/mL (translated 
to ≥ 70% µ-opioid  receptor  occupancy)  is  needed  to  produce  significant  opioid  blockade.  (Greenwald  2014; 
Nasser  2014;  Nasser  2016).  Although  plasma  concentrations  may  be  useful  predictors  for  blockade,  the 
variability observed in HS-13-478 suggests that a few individuals may experience partial blockade also at high 
BPN  concentrations  >  2  ng/mL.  However,  most  patients  demonstrated  complete  opioid  blockade  for  a  BPN 
plasma concentration of 1.2 ng/mL, reached approximately within 4 hours after the 24 mg CAM2038 injections.  
Mean  BPN  concentration  vs  least  square  mean  estimates  of  treatment  difference  (18  mg  hydromorphone  vs 
placebo) for Drug-Liking VAS Emax in study HS-13-478  Values are mean (95% CI) 
The bridging of doses between SL BPN, CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w (Table below), are justified by 
comparable BPN steady-state exposure obtained by simulations using the population PK model.

Proposed switches from daily doses of SL BPN to initial weekly doses of CAM2038 q1w or monthly 
doses of CAM2038 q4w 
The comparison of Cmax and Ctrough values for steady-state administrations of SL BPN with the respective 
values (Cmax and Ctrough) for the initial dose of CAM2038 q1w (a) and CAM2038 q4w(b) are shown below. 
Simulated BPN PK parameters following switch from steady-state dosing of SL BPN to the first dose 
of CAM2038 q1w 
Following Cmax, the BPN plasma concentrations declined slowly for CAM2038 q1w, supporting weekly dosing 
and monthly dosing for CAM2038 q4w. Similar or higher simulated Ctrough values were shown following the first 
dose of CAM2038 q1w compared to steady-state dosing of SL BPN for the lowest doses in the dose intervals of 
2 to 6 mg, 8 to 10 mg, 12 to 16 mg and 18 to 24 mg. At the highest doses of SL BPN in the dose intervals, the 
simulated Ctrough values after the first dose of CAM2038 q1w were lower or equal to the Ctrough values at 
steady state for corresponding SL BPN doses, which may indicate a need for an additional 8 mg CAM2038 q1w 
dose during the first week of treatment with CAM2038 q1w. 
Geometric means of simulated Cmax and concentration before the next dose (Ctrough) for the steady-state 
administrations of SL BPN and the switch to the initial dose of CAM2038 q4w are presented in the table below.

Simulated BPN PK parameters following switch from steady-state dosing of SL BPN to the first dose

For all switches (except 10 mg SL BPN) from steady-state dosing of SL BPN to the first dose of CAM2038 q4w, 
similar or higher Ctrough values were shown for CAM2038 q4w compared to Ctrough at steady state for SL BPN.

administrations of CAM2038 q1w and the switch to the initial dose of CAM2038 q4w are presented in the table

Simulated BPN PK parameters following transfer from steady-state dosing of CAM2038 q1w to the 
first dose of CAM2038 q4w 
For the transfers from steady-state dosing of CAM2038 q1w to the first dose of CAM2038 q4w, the simulated 
Ctrough values for CAM2038 q4w were slightly lower than for CAM2038 q1w. Therefore, patients may need to 
be monitored more closely following transitions.  
The ability to block the subjective drug-liking response to intramuscular (IM) hydromorphone was investigated 
in patients with opioid dependence (CSR HS-13-478). Complete blockade of the subjective drug-liking response

was estimated at BPN plasma concentrations above 0.4 ng/mL by population PK/PD modelling. Except for the 
switch from steady-state dosing of 2 to 6 mg SL BPN to the first dose of 8 mg CAM2038 q1w, all simulated 
Ctrough values were higher than 0.4 ng/mL after the switches from SL BPN to CAM2038 q1w or CAM2038 q4w 
and after the transfers from CAM2038 q1w to CAM2038 q4w. Thus, complete blockade of the subjective 
drug-liking response is maintained throughout the treatment period already after the first dose of 16, 24 or 32 
mg CAM2038 q1w or 64, 96 or 128 mg CAM2038 q4w after transitions from previous treatments.

PK/PD relationships between BPN plasma concentrations and measured QT intervals corrected for heart rate 
using the Fridericia’s correction (QTcF) were evaluated for 128 mg CAM2038 q4w. BPN exposure and ECG 
measurements were performed at 18 to 22 occasions, including 3 occasions around Cmax (at 6, 10 and 24 hour) 
after the fourth dose, for each subject. The provide data suggests that the absolute QTcF interval prolongation 
was below the 500 ms threshold and the increase in QTcF from baseline was less than 60 ms for all subjects and 
measurements. Overall, it appears that no trends were observed in either absolute QTcF interval or change in 
QTcF from baseline with increasing concentration of BPN at steady-state dosing of 128 mg CAM2038 q4w. 
Moreover it appears that no ECG-related adverse events (AEs) have been reported in patients related CAM2038 
q4w administration.  
Opioid dependence has been associated with misuse of gabapentin and pregabalin and the applicant points out 
that concomitant prescription of BPN or methadone and pregabalin was associated with a higher rate of 
overdose deaths.  
2.8.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
On the whole, the PK of CAM2038 q1w could be considered sufficiently characterized in healthy volunteers and 
patients. Given the proportionality of composition of the different strengths, similar dissolution profiles and 
linearity, a strength biowaiver for the not fully evaluated doses could potentially be applied to the other 
strengths. 
For CAM2038 q4w, the applicant has withdrawn the 160mg strength as the pharmacokinetic profile for this 
strength is not currently sufficiently characterised.  There is an adequate understanding of the PK of the 
remaining dose levels. There are several issues to be considered regarding the interaction of buprenorphine with 
inhibitors or inducers of the CYP 3A4 and inhibitors of UGT1A that are the main clearance pathways of 
buprenorphine.  
Drug-drug interactions are expected between buprenorphine and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 resulting in 
increased Cmax and AUC of BPN and norBPN.  A PBPK model has been used to investigate the possible effect of 
CYP 3A4 inhibitors and inducers on the exposure of buprenorphine following subcutaneous dosing. However, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 42/116 
  
  
 
 
model appears to contradict some of the conclusions on the general PK properties and is not adequate to support 
any dose adjustment or recommendation about the DDI in the SmPC. 
The posology and transitions from daily doses of SL BPN to initial weekly doses of CAM2038 q1w or monthly 
doses of CAM2038 q4w were based on the clinical PK studies and the population PK analysis of these data.  
The applicant explored the relationship between BNP plasma concentrations and blockade of the subjective 
opioid effects of hydromorphone in patients with moderate or severe opioid use disorder after 2 administrations 
of SC CAM2038 q1w 24 mg and 32 mg. This data is important to understand the exposure of the current 
products in terms of efficacy. 
The evaluation of the relationship between PK and PD suggested that concentrations ~1.2 ng/mL, which were 
reached as early as 4 hours after the first administration of both CAM2038 q1w doses, were sufficient to block 
the subjective effects of hydromorphone. Higher plasma BPN concentrations were not associated with 
appreciable increases in blockade in the different treatment groups.  
In respect to transfers from SL BPN to weekly injections similar or higher simulated Ctrough values were shown 
following the first dose of CAM2038 q1w compared to steady-state dosing of SL BPN for the lowest doses in the 
dose intervals of 2 to 6 mg, 8 to 10 mg, 12 to 16 mg and 18 to 24 mg. On the other hand at the highest doses 
of SL BPN in the dose intervals, the simulated Ctrough values after the first dose of CAM2038 q1w were lower or 
equal to the Ctrough values at steady state for corresponding SL BPN doses. This may indicate that those 
patients are more likely to require additional 8 mg dose.  
In respect to transfer from SL BPN to monthly injections for all switches (except 10 mg SL BPN) from 
steady-state dosing of SL BPN to the first dose of CAM2038 q4w, similar or higher Ctrough values were shown 
for CAM2038 q4w compared to Ctrough at steady state for SL BPN.  
In respect to transfer from weekly to monthly injections for the transfers from steady-state dosing of CAM2038 
q1w to the first dose of CAM2038 q4w, the simulated Ctrough values for CAM2038 q4w were slightly lower than 
for CAM2038 q1w for all dose levels.  
2.8.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The submitted data package supports Marketing Authorisation of Buvidal from clinical pharmacology 
perspective. 
2.8.6.  Clinical efficacy 
Dose-response studies and main clinical studies 
Patients not currently taking BPN maintenance treatment 
The starting dose is supported by the results from the HS-13-478, HS-11-421 and HS-14-499 studies. The 
starting dose for patients not currently receiving BPN maintenance treatment in HS-11-421 and HS-14-499 was 
16 mg of weekly CAM2038 and all patients received one titration dose of 8 mg during Week 1 up to a total of 24 
mg CAM2038 q1w.  
As in clinical practice, dose adjustments (increases in case of withdrawal effects or cravings or decreases for 
tolerability reasons) were allowed during the Phase 3 studies at scheduled study visits. In the HS-11-421 study,  
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 43/116 
  
  
50.2% of patients reached a maximum dose of 24 mg CAM2038 q1w and  39.9% were titrated double-blinded 
to a dose of 32 mg of CAM2038 q1w, resulting in effective withdrawal suppression and non-inferior efficacy 
compared with SL BPN/NX, where 109 patients ( 50.7 %) reached a corresponding daily dose of 16 mg and 90 
patients ( 41.9 %) were titrated up to 24 mg/day SL BPN/NX.  
In the HS-14-499 study, 26 of the 37 new-to-treatment patients (70.3%) reached a maximum dose of 24 mg 
CAM2038 q1w, and 4 patients (10.8%) received a maximum of 32 mg of CAM2038 q1w during the treatment 
period. 
Furthermore, study HS-13-478 showed that 24 mg CAM2038 q1w provided rapid and sustained blockade of 
opioid effects and suppression of withdrawal from the first dose and was well tolerated by patients with opioid 
dependence. 
Thus, the approved posology is supported by substantial clinical evidence, including PK, PD, efficacy, safety and 
tolerability from studies HS-13-478, HS-11-421 and HS-14-499. 
Transitioning from Sublingual Buprenorphine to CAM2038 
Patients treated with SL BPN may be transitioned directly to weekly or monthly CAM2038. 
The transition criteria are based on the results of the clinical PK studies (HS-11-426, HS-13-487, HS-13-478 and 
HS-15-549) and the population PK analysis of these data. The aim is to achieve appropriate BPN exposures 
during initiation as well as comparable BPN PK exposure on transfer between SL BPN, CAM2038 q1w and 
CAM2038 q4w treatments, and to provide sustained efficacy, safety and tolerability in treatment of opioid 
dependence, as demonstrated in the Phase 3 studies HS-11-421 and HS-14-499. The dose conversion is based 
on single-dose and steady-state BPN systemic exposure data after repeated daily administration of SL BPN and 
CAM2038 in studies HS-11-426, HS-13-487, HS-13-478 and HS-15-549 as well as population PK modelling and 
simulation of data from these studies. 
Maintenance Treatment with CAM2038 
Patients may be switched from weekly to monthly dosing or from monthly to weekly dosing of CAM2038 (Table 
below).  
The transitioning between weekly and monthly dosing of CAM2038 is supported by PK and population PK 
modelling, as well as studies HS-11-421 and HS-14-499. Study HS-11-421 included a fixed transition from 
weekly to monthly treatment with CAM2038 after the initial 12 weeks of treatment. Dose conversions were 
made based on previous PK and PD study results. The transition between weekly and monthly CAM2038 was 
smooth, without any out-of-trend observations in any of the PD (withdrawal and cravings), efficacy (illicit opioid 
use) or safety and tolerability outcomes, or indications of loss of efficacy compared with the SL BPN/NX 
comparator group. Furthermore, the highest weekly (Phase 1) and monthly (Phase 2) individual doses reached 
in this flexible dose study were fully consistent with the pre-defined dose conversions between the weekly and 
monthly products. Moreover, the use of supplemental 8 mg CAM2038 q1w was limited, with fewer patients 
requiring supplemental doses in the CAM2038 arm compared to the SL BPN/NX arm. 
Furthermore, study HS-14-499 allowed investigators flexibility to transition from weekly to monthly CAM2038 
dosing in accordance with the same dose conversion schedule, without observations of reduced efficacy or 
tolerability across the study.

Methods 
The study was designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of CAM2038 compared to an existing standard of care (SL 
BPN/NX) in initiation and maintenance treatment with BPN. The study involved 4 phases: Screening (3 weeks), 
Phase 1 (12 treatment weeks), Phase 2 (12 treatment weeks), and Follow-up (4 weeks). The use of suboxone 
as control is acceptable as the naloxone component doesn’t interfere with the pharmacodynamic properties of 
buprenorphine and is added to deter from misuse of the tablets.

The reference therapy was SL BPN/NX tablets plus placebo injections. Subjects received sublingual BPN/NX 
tablets at 16 or 24 mg/day (up to 32 mg/day during Phase 2). 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the CAM2038 buprenorphine (BPN) 
treatment arm as compared to the sublingual (SL) BPN/naloxone (NX) treatment arm in treating adult 
outpatients with opioid use disorder in terms of urine samples negative for illicit opioids. Due to differences in 
analyses requested by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the Committee for Medicinal Products 
for Human Use at the European Medicines Agency (EMA), two statistical analysis plans (SAPs) were prepared: 
one for FDA submission and one for EMA submission. In the FDA SAP, the primary objective was the same as in 
the protocol, i.e., to demonstrate non-inferiority of the CAM2038 treatment arm as compared to the SL BPN/NX 
arm as measured by the primary efficacy measure of response rate (RR). In the EMA SAP, the primary objective 
was to demonstrate noninferiority of the CAM2038 treatment arm as compared to the SL BPN/NX arm as 
measured by the primary efficacy measure of percentage urine sample negative for illicit opioids. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of CAM2038 compared to SL BPN/NX as measured by the cumulative

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint for EMA was the percentage of urine samples negative for illicit opioids based on 
the 18 urine samples obtained during the post-induction period (between Week 2 and Week 25). (This endpoint 
was added as a primary endpoint for EMA in Protocol Amendment 5). 
In this analysis, if urine toxicology samples were missing, for example, due to missing scheduled visit, early 
discontinuation of the study, or subject’s refusal to provide the samples (scheduled or random samples), the 
results were imputed as positive. 
Efficacy evaluation was based on illicit opioid use (as measured through urine toxicology and self-reporting); 
retention rate (percent of subjects remaining in study); desire and need to use; use of other illicit drugs; 
withdrawal; need for supplemental SL BPN/NX; and need for supplemental counseling. The primary efficacy 
variable (for the FDA) was RR, based on urine toxicology results for illicit opioids. 
The primary efficacy variable (for EMA) was the percent negative urine samples, based on the 18 urine samples 
obtained during the post-induction period (between Week 2 and Week 25). 
Assessment report

The primary efficacy variable (for the FDA) was RR, based on urine toxicology results for illicit opioids. 
To be a responder for Phase 1 (the final responder definition was outlined in Protocol Amendment 4), the subject 
had to have no evidence of illicit opioids use at Week 13 and no evidence of illicit opioids use for at least two out 
of the three weeks from Week 10 to Week 12. 
To be a responder for Phase 2, the subject had to have no evidence of illicit opioids use at Month 6 (last illicit 
opioids use assessment in Month 6 or Week 25) and no evidence of illicit opioids use in five out of the six illicit 
opioids use assessments in Phase 2. To be a responder for the study, the subject must have been a responder 
for both Phases 1 and 2. Evidence of illicit opioid use was defined as a positive urine toxicology result or a 
self-reported illicit opioid use. 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. 
The clinical objective of the study, to demonstrate non-inferiority of the CAM2038 BPN treatment arm as 
compared to the SL BPN/NX treatment arm in treating adult outpatients with opioid use disorder, was tested 
using RR. The proportion of responders was calculated in both treatment arms.

Sample size 
The choice of non-inferiority margin for the variable percent negative urine was based on the outcome of the 
Rosenthal study (Rosenthal, 2013) where a comparison was evaluated over 24 weeks between SL BPN/NX 
(n=119) and placebo (n=54) for the outcome variable percent negative urine samples. The reported values 
from the ANOVA was 35.1% for SL BPN/NX and 14.4% for placebo (difference = 20.7%, P = 0.81). This 
translates to an approximate 95% CI for the difference of (11.5%, 29.9%). The power calculation was based on 
the lower limit of this CI representing a level of effect that can be viewed as clinically relevant, and can represent 
a hypothetical placebo arm in this study. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatments, to increase the likelihood 
that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demographics, baseline characteristics) were evenly balanced 
across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. 
Subjects who provided written informed consent were assigned a unique number in the Screening process. This 
number was used to identify the subject throughout the study. 
Subjects who met the eligibility criteria during the re-check on Day 1 and who tolerated the 4 mg test dose were 
randomized to one of the two treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio (Group 1: Daily SL BPN/NX plus SC placebo 
injections or Group 2: CAM2038 [q1w and q4w] SC injections plus SL placebo tablets). Due to the size of the 
study, it was expected that subjects would be balanced for various other baseline factors, including age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 47/116 
  
  
Once any subject number or randomization number was assigned, it could not be reassigned to any other 
subject. This study used central randomization, through an Interactive Web Response System managed by 
DSG, Inc. 
Blinding (masking) 
In order to reduce the potential for bias in the study, treatment group assignments were double-blinded. The 
subject, investigational site personnel, sponsor, and sponsor designees directly involved in the conduct and/or 
monitoring of this study were not aware of the treatment group assignments. 
SL BPN/NX tablets used during the study had a nearly matching placebo. Due to minor potential differences 
between active and placebo SL tablets, subjects were told that clinical supplies of SL BPN/NX were specifically 
developed for this study and may look or taste different than commercially available products that they may 
have been treated with previously. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of urine samples negative for illicit opioids based on the 18 
urine samples obtained during the post-induction period (between Week 2 and Week 25). This variable was 
analysed via an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment effects. The difference between the two 
treatments in percent negative urine samples was obtained from this model and the two-sided 95% CI for the 
treatment difference was presented.

A majority (70.8%) of subjects had previously used heroin as the primary opioid of abuse, and approximately 
half (52.3%) of the subjects used injection as the route of administering opioids (Table below). Positive 
screening results for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, marijuana, and phencyclidine 
were similar between treatment groups. 
Table 12: Opioid use history (safety population) 
Post Hoc Analysis: Other Baseline Characteristics - Most subjects (93.7% overall) had opioid-positive urine 
samples (supported by subjects’ self-reports of opioid use) at Day 1. A majority of subjects (71.0%) had a 
history of using non-opioid substances, and approximately one-fourth (25.9%) of subjects had a history of 
fentanyl use. Fentanyl use was slightly higher (29.1%) among subjects in the CAM2038 treatment group 
compared with the SL BPN/NX treatment group (22.8%).

Psychosocial and Medical History 
73 (17.1%) subjects did not have a high school education; 161 (37.6%) had a GED/high school diploma; 146 
(34.1%) had received some college or certificate program education; 40 (9.3%) subjects had a 2-year or 4-year 
college degree; and 7 (1.6%) subjects had a graduate degree. The majority of subjects were unemployed (236 
subjects; 55.1%) whereas 148 subjects (34.6%) were employed either full time or part time. The majority of 
subjects were single (228 subjects; 53.3%), renters (218 subjects; 50.9%), and had been arrested in the past 
(274 subjects; 64.0%). 
Psychosocial history results were comparable between the two treatment groups. 
A majority (97.4%) of subjects had medical history available. Overall, the most common medical conditions at 
study entry were in the SOCs of Psychiatric Disorders (86.9%), followed by Infections and Infestations (38.3%) 
and Surgical and Medical Procedures (35.3%). 
No subject had a medical history of HIV or AIDS. 
The majority of subjects were single (228 subjects; 53.3%), renters (218 subjects; 50.9%), and had been 
arrested in the past (274 subjects; 64.0%). 
Post Hoc Analysis: Hepatitis at Study Entry - Approximately one-fourth (25.9%) of subjects had any 
self-reported history of hepatitis, most of whom had a history of hepatitis C (23.1%). 
Prior and concomitant medication 
A total of 54 (12.6%) subjects took at least one medication before study entry; the most common class of prior 
medications was nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic products (2.8%). No subjects had prior use 
of strong CYP inducers or inhibitors. The use of prior medications was generally comparable between the two 
treatment groups.

A total of 54 (12.6%) subjects took at least one medication before study entry.  
A majority of subjects (67.1%) took at least one concomitant medication during the study. Overall, the most 
common class of concomitant medications was opioids (22.2%), followed by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and 
antirheumatic products (14.5%) (Table below). The use of concomitant medications was generally comparable 
between the treatment groups. 
Thirty-five subjects took CYP3A4 inhibitors during the study (after randomization). Of these, 11 were in the

Post-hoc analyses 
Subjects without other drugs of abuse at Screening (52 in the CAM2038 group and 60 in the SL BPN/NX group) 
and after the first two weeks of treatment (Weeks 4 – 25), including subjects’ self-reported opioid use, the LS 
mean (95% CI) was 45.7 % (35.1 – 56.3) in the SL BPN/NX group and 57.5% (46.1 – 68.9) in the CAM2038 
group. The difference between treatment groups was 11.8 % (CAM2038 – SL BPN/NX) with a 95% CI of -3.8 - 
27.4 (P = 0.136). 
A total of 11 subjects discontinued study medication but continued scheduled visits and completed the study, 
including Follow-up. Post hoc sensitivity analyses were conducted taking these 11 subjects into 
consideration. The first set of post hoc analyses included the percentage of urine samples that were negative for 
illicit opioids, excluding the 11 subjects who discontinued study drug but completed the study. In the analysis 
that included subjects’ self-reported opioid use, the treatment difference was 7.2 % favouring CAM2038 (95% 
CI: 0.3 – 14.1; P = 0.041). In the analysis that did not include subjects’ self-reported opioid use, the treatment 
difference was 7.1 favouring CAM2038 (95% CI: 0.1 – 14.1; P = 0.046). 
Percentage of urine samples that were negative for illicit opioids, performed with imputation of all urine samples 
that were positive after study drug discontinuation. In the analysis that included subjects’ self-reported opioid 
use, the treatment difference was 6.9 % favouring CAM2038 (95% CI: 0.1 – 13.7; P = 0.047). In the analysis 
that did not include subjects’ self-reported opioid use, the treatment difference was 6.8 favouring CAM2038 
(95% CI: -0.1 – 13.7; P = 0.053). 
Route of administration of illicit opioids (injected or not injected) – analysis of percentage of urine samples that 
were negative for illicit opioids without self-reported opioid use. Among subjects who injected opioids (114 in the 
CAM2038 group and 110 in the SL BPN/NX group), the treatment difference was 13.6 favouring CAM2038 (95% 
CI: 5.3 – 21.9) without self-reports; p= 0.001. Among subjects who did not inject opioids (99 in the 
CAM2038 group and 105 in the SL BPN/NX group), the treatment difference was 0.00 (95% CI: 
-10.7 – 10.8); p= 0.998. The test of interaction was significant (P = 0.048), with a stronger effect seen among 
subjects who injected opioids. Similar results were seen when the analysis was repeated with subjects’ 
self-reported opioid use (test for interaction: P = 0.040). 
A similar post hoc sensitivity analysis was performed to assess percentage of urine samples that were negative 
for illicit opioids by the primary opioid of use at initiation (heroin or prescription opioids); the analysis did not 
include subjects’ self-reported opioid use. Among subjects who used heroin (152 in the CAM2038 group and 151 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 55/116 
  
  
 
in the SL BPN/NX group), the treatment difference was 14.8 favouring CAM2038 (95% CI: 8.0 – 21.7); 
p<0.001. Among subjects who used prescription opioids (61 in the CAM2038 group and 64 in the SL 
BPN/NX group), the treatment difference was -11.6 (favouring SL BPN/NX) (95% CI: -24.6 – 1.5); 
p=0.082. The test of interaction was significant (P < 0.001), with a stronger effect seen among subjects who 
used heroin. Similar results were seen when the analysis was repeated with subjects’ self-reported opioid use 
(test for interaction: P < 0.001). 
Average maximum doses of SL BPN/NX (i.e. after titration) were 19 mg/day in Phase 1 and 20 mg/day in Phase 
2, i.e. known therapeutic doses. For CAM2038, the average maximum doses were 26 mg/week (3.7 mg/day) in 
Phase 1 and 110 mg/month (3.9 mg/day) in Phase 2. 
In the HS-11-421 study, 50.2% of patients reached a maximum dose of 24 mg CAM2038 q1w and 39.9% were 
titrated double-blinded to a dose of 32 mg of CAM2038 q1w, resulting in effective withdrawal suppression and 
non-inferior efficacy compared with SL BPN/NX, where  109 patients ( 50.7 %) reached a corresponding daily 
dose of 16 mg and 90  patients ( 41.9 %) were titrated up to 24 mg/day SL BPN/NX. 
Exploratory analysis of the EU primary endpoint 
In both phases of the study, the CAM2038 group demonstrated numerically higher LS means for the percentage 
of urine samples negative for illicit opioids (Phase 1: 35.8%; Phase 2: 33.9%) compared to the SL BPN/NX group 
(Phase 1: 29.9%; Phase 2: 25.4%) (Table 19 ). The treatment difference (95% CI) was 5.9 (-1.3, 13.1) for 
Phase 1 and 8.5 (1.2, 15.7) for Phase 2. These results indicate that CAM2038 treatment was superior to SL 
BPN/NX in allowing subjects to avoid opioid use and achieve a higher percentage of negative urine samples in 
Phase 2 of the study.

Secondary efficacy variables 
CDF of Percent of Urine Samples Negative for Illicit Opioids  
To evaluate the CDF, the percentage of negative urine samples from the 15 samples required was calculated for 
each subject with missing sample values imputed as positive. 
Let p denote the percentage of negative urine samples (PNU). It should be noted that the CDF in this case is the 
probability of PNU ≤  p (a less desirable outcome) and 1-CDF is the probability of PNU > p (a more desirable 
outcome). Therefore, per the CDF definition, the treatment with a consistently lower CDF value (thus higher 
1-CDF) indicates the treatment is more likely to produce a higher PNU. 
Superiority of CAM2038 versus SL BPN/NX on the CDF of the proportion of opioid-negative urine samples 
without self-reports during treatment Weeks 4 to 24 was demonstrated. The median CDF was 26.7% for 
CAM2038 and 6.7% for SL BPN/NX (p = 0.008).

Percentage of Subjects Remaining in the Study (Retention Rate) 
Of the 428 participants who were randomized in the study, all received at least one dose of study drug, and 
69.0% (147/213) of the CAM2038 and 72.6% (156/215) of the SL BPN/NX patients completed the 24-week 
treatment period. Including the 4 weeks of study follow-up, 56.8% (121/213) of the CAM2038 and 58.6% 
(126/215) of the SL BPN/NX patients finished the entire study.  
The results in the table below include the 11 subjects who discontinued study treatment but completed the study 
(7 in the CAM2038 group and 4 in the SL BPN/NX group). The proportion difference between treatment groups 
was -1.8 (95% CI: -11.2%, 7.6%), and the CAM2038 group achieved non-inferiority in retention rates 
compared to the SL BPN/NX group (P = 0.006; non-inferiority margin of 15%).

Among subjects who did not have other drugs of abuse (56 subjects in CAM2038 treatment group; 62 subjects 
in SL BPN/NX treatment group), the study completion rate (including follow-up) was almost identical between 
treatment groups (69.6% CAM2038; 69.4% SL BPN/NX). 
An additional analysis was performed to assess retention over time. As of Week 25, retention in the SL BPN/NX 
treatment group was 62.3% compared with 57.7% in the CAM2038 treatment group. Retention by week is 
presented in Post hoc Table 28.

Ancillary analyses 
Improvements were also seen for patients treated with CAM2038 compared with SL BPN/NX for exploratory 
endpoints of percentage of patients with negative urine samples by time point (overall [by week] and for 
sampling Weeks 7, 10, 11, 12, 17, and 25), percentage of patients with negative urine samples with self-reports 
of no illicit opioid use by time point (overall [by week] and for sampling Weeks 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 17), and 
percentage of patients with no self-reported illicit opioid use by time point (sampling Weeks 9, 11, 17, and 21).  
Percentage of Subjects with Negative Urine Samples by timepoint 
At Week 25, the percentage of subjects in the CAM2038 group with negative urine samples was 32.9% 
compared to the SL BPN/NX group (24.2%) with an overall proportion difference overall was 8.4% (95% CI: 
1.1%, 15.6%) with the following times points favouring the CAM2038 group over the SL BPN/NX group: Weeks

Cumulative Percentage of Subjects with Negative Urine Samples after Two Months of Treatment by Time Point 
(from Week 9 to Week 25) 
The proportion differences between treatment groups by time point were between - 1.1% (Week 9) and  3.8% 
(Week 25); no statistical difference was found between treatment groups at any time point between Weeks 9 
and 25 or overall for the cumulative percentage 
Percentage of subjects with no self-reported illicit opioid use by time point 
At all time points measured, a majority of subjects (> 54%) in both groups reported no illicit opioid use. At Week 
2, 62.3% of subjects in the SL BPN/NX group and 55.4% of subjects in the CAM2038 group reported no opioid 
use. Between Weeks 3 and 21, the percentage of subjects with no self-reported illicit opioid use in the SL 
BPN/NX group was within the range of approximately 55% to 67%; the range for the CAM2038 group was 
approximately 58% to 76%. By Week 25, these percentages were 70.6% for the SL BPN/NX group and 77.2% 
for the CAM2038 group, and the difference between treatment groups was not significant at this point (P = 
0.225). Based on subjects’ self-reporting, the CAM2038 group was favoured (P < 0.05) over the SL BPN/NX 
group for a greater proportion of subjects with no illicit opioid use at the following time points: Weeks 9, 11, 17, 
and 21.

Percentage of Subjects Meeting Criteria of Stability 
At each weekly visit, starting at Week 5, the subjects were evaluated with regard to the following stability 
criteria: 
• Has the subject been on a stable dose of CAM2038 q1w/Placebo SC injections without any fluctuations in doses 
for the last 4 weeks? 
• Does the subject exhibit minimal subjective and no objective withdrawal symptoms, based on SOWS ≤  7 and 
COWS < 5? 
• Does the subject exhibit diminished desire/need to use, based on VAS scores (defined as at least 50% 
reduction from baseline in the VAS score)? 
• Does the subject exhibit diminished use of illicit opioids, according to the Investigator’s discretion? 
Percent of subjects meeting criteria of stability by time point (by scheduled post baseline visit) was analyzed 
using chi square tests, with Week 13 as the primary time point. The percentages for each treatment and 
between treatment percentage differences were estimated with 95% confidence intervals of the estimated 
treatment differences. Additionally, for the primary time point (Week 13), sensitivity analysis were performed 
quantifying the number of subjects with at least 25% reduction in positive urine test performed at Weeks 10-13 
compared to Weeks 2-5 (replacing the last question where PI assessed diminished illicit opioid use. 
When the percentage of subjects meeting the criteria of stability included the PI assessment, the range 
demonstrated was within 33% to  54% for the SL BPN/NX group and  31% and 56% for the CAM2038 group. In 
general, results were similar between treatment groups. The greatest treatment difference (95% CI) observed 
was at Week 13 ( 5.3 % [-5.7 %, 16.3 %]) when 50.3 % of subjects in the SL BPN/NX group and 55.6% subjects 
in the CAM2038 group met the criteria for stability. Yet, when the superiority of CAM2038 to SL BPN/NX was 
tested with the chi square test, the P value at Week 13, along with the P values at all other time points, did not 
indicate a difference. 
When the analysis did not include PI assessment, the percentages of subjects who met the stability criteria at 
each time point were approximately 10% to 15% higher. In this analysis, the percentages of subjects who met 
the stability criteria at Week 13 were 67.7 % for the SL BPX group and 68.8 % for the CAM2038 group. The 
greatest treatment difference (95% CI) observed was at Week 11 (6.1 % [- 4.4%,  16.5%]) when 62.3 % 
subjects in the SL BPN/NX group and  68.4 % subjects in the CAM2038 group met the criteria for stability. 
Similar to the results for the analysis that included PI assessment, CAM2038 did not demonstrate improvement 
over SL BPN/NX at any time point. 
Opioid craving 
Mean VAS scores for morning desire/need to use were similar between treatment groups at Week 2 (SL BPN/NX: 
33.0; CAM2038: 37.1). For both treatment groups, morning cravings decreased between Week 2 and Week 12 
(SL BPN/NX: 15.1; CAM2038: 13.1 at Week 12), then remained relatively consistent until Week 25 (SL BPN/NX: 
18.3; CAM2038: 12.8). Overall, morning cravings were generally similar for subjects treated with CAM2038 or 
SL BPN/NX. With the exception of Week 9 (difference of -6.6 [95% CI -12.3, -0.9] favoring CAM2038; P = 
0.024) and Week 10 (difference of -5.8 [95% CI -11.2, -0.5]; P = 0.034), no statistical differences were found 
between treatment groups.

The mean COWS score at Baseline was 12.2 (mild to moderate withdrawal) for both treatment groups. The 
mean score for both groups declined rapidly up to Week 5, at which time the mean COWS score was 2.9 for the 
SL BPN/NX group and 3.0 for the CAM2038 group. These values had a mean change from Baseline of -9.4 for the 
SL BPN/NX group and -9.2 for the CAM2038 group. Following Week 5, the mean COWS scores were mostly 
stable and below 3.0. At Week 25, the mean COWS score was 2.8 for both groups, which represented mean 
changes from Baseline of -9.4 (SL BPN/NX) and -9.5 (CAM2038). The changes from Baseline in COWS scores 
were similar for subjects treated with CAM2038 or SL BPN/NX (Figure  8 ), and no statistical difference was found 
between treatment groups at any time point.

The mean SOWS score at Baseline was 30.6 for the SL BPN/NX group and 31.5 for the CAM2038 group (severe 
withdrawal for both groups). These values had a mean change from Baseline of -23.1 for the SL BPN/NX group 
and -22.7 for the CAM2038 group. Following Week 5, the mean SOWS scores were mostly stable. At Week 25, 
the mean SOWS score was 6.3 for the SL BPN/NX group and 7.3 for the CAM2038 group, which represented 
mean changes from Baseline of -24.2 for both groups. The changes from Baseline in SOWS scores were similar 
for subjects treated with CAM2038 or SL BPN/NX; no statistical differences were found between treatment 
groups at any time point. 
Percentage of Subjects Without Evidence of Using Other Drugs of Abuse by Time Point 
There was no statistical difference between study groups for the use of barbiturates, amphetamine, 
phencyclidine or marijuana at any time point.  
Evidence for the use of barbiturates was low at Screening (0.5% SL BPN/NX and 1.4% CAM2038) and remained 
low throughout the study (SL BPN/NX: 0.7% at Week 25, range 0.0% [Weeks 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 21] 
to 2.3% [Week 7]; CAM2038: 2.4% at Week 25, range 0.0% [Day 1 and Weeks 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 
17] to 2.4% [Week 25]). 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 66/116 
  
  
 
Evidence for the use of phencyclidine was very low at Screening (0.0% SL BPN/NX and 0.9% CAM2038) and was 
generally low throughout the study (SL BPN/NX: 1.5% at Week 25, range 0.0% [Screening] to 2.0% [Week 17]; 
CAM2038: 4.1% at Week 25, range 0.6% [Weeks 9 and 12] to 4.1% [Week 25]). 
Evidence for the use of marijuana was approximately 28% at Screening (29.8% SL BPN/NX and 27.0% 
CAM2038) and was generally stable throughout the study (SL BPN/NX: 29.9% at Week 25, range 27.7% [Week 
8] to 37.0% [Week 3]; CAM2038: 30.9% at Week 25, range 26.8% [Week 8] to 33.8% [Week 13]). 
Evidence for the use of amphetamines was approximately 15% at Screening (14.9% SL BPN/NX and 18.0% 
CAM2038) and was generally stable throughout the study (SL BPN/NX: 14.2% at Week 25, range 10.9% [Week 
12] to 16.4% [Week 17]; CAM2038: 17.9% at Week 25, range 13.5% [Week 7] to 18.6% [Week 21]). 
Evidence for the use of cocaine was approximately 25% at Screening (24.7% SL BPN/NX and 25.1% CAM2038) 
and increased slightly during the study (SL BPN/NX: 29.9% at Week 25, range 24.7% [Screening] to 37.8% 
[Week 12]; CAM2038: 30.1% at Week 25, range 25.1% [Screening] to 32.9% [Week 6]). 
The use of benzodiazepines was approximately 15% at Screening (16.3% SL BPN/NX and 14.2% CAM2038) and 
increased slightly during the study (SL BPN/NX: 21.6% at Week 25, range 9.6% [Week 8] to 21.6% [Week 25]; 
CAM2038: 20.3% at Week 25, range 13.3% [Week 4] to 21.4% [Week 21]). The proportion differences ranged 
from -11.2% at Week 21 to 2.3% at Week 5. With the exception of Week 10 (proportion difference of -7.9% 
[95% CI: -15.5%, -0.3%]; P = 0.044) and Week 21 (proportion difference of -11.2% [95% CI: -19.5%, 
-2.8%]; P = 0.010), there were no statistical differences between treatment groups. 
Illicit use by gender 
A post hoc analysis was performed by ma for the percentage of urine samples that were negative for illicit 
opioids (with subjects’ self-reports of opioid use). For women, the difference between treatment groups was 6.6 
(CAM2038 – SL BPN/NX) with a 95% CI of -5.0 - 18.3 (Post hoc Table 14). For men, the difference between 
treatment groups was 5.9 (CAM2038 – SL BPN/NX) with a 95% CI of -2.5 – 14.3. An ANOVA test of treatment 
by gender interaction found no difference between men and women for this endpoint (P = 0.919). Results were 
similar when subjects’ self-reports of opioid use were not included (P = 0.863)

Supportive studies 
Study HS-14- 
It is an open-label multicenter study evaluating the long-term safety of a q1w and q4w CAM2038 in adult 
outpatients with opioid use disorder. It differs from HS-11-421 in that the main objective of this 48 weeks 
open-label study was long-term safety but it included efficacy parameters such as urine toxicology screening for 
opioids and other drugs of abuse; self-reported illicit drug use; measures of withdrawal (Subjective Opiate 
Withdrawal Scale [SOWS] and Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale [COWS]); measures of craving (desire and need 
to use); quality of life questionnaires; subject satisfaction; and unscheduled visits, medication, and counselling. 
Patients recruited in this study were taking sublingual buprenorphine or were actively seeking BPN treatment 
before enrolment. At any visit, the investigator could transition patients from q1w to q4w. 
This study is further discussed in the discussion on clinical efficacy below. 
Study HS-07-307 
Study HS-07-307 was a Phase 1/2, single-center, single-blind, single dose, dose-escalation, parallel-group, a 
first-time-in-man study investigating tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 4 different doses of 
CAM2038 q1w in patients with opioid dependence. 
The study enrolled 41 patients (of whom 1 was included in 2 dose cohorts and is counted twice; N=42 ), who 
were on stable maintenance treatment with Subutex for ≥ 6 months and on a daily dose of 6 to 24 mg for ≥ 2 
weeks before screening. 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 73/116 
  
  
 
 
The primary objectives were to evaluate the systemic and local tolerability and the PK profile of BPN of 4 
different single doses of CAM2038 q1w when delivered via SC buttock injection. The secondary objectives were 
to assess the PK profile of norbuprenorphine (norBPN) and the PD profile of BPN. Withdrawal symptoms were 
evaluated by Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), and time 
from the CAM2038 dosing until dosing with rescue medication. 
The PK data from this study are discussed in the PK section of this report. The PD variables are limited and do 
not contradict previous findings but more importantly the formulation for this study is not the final one and the 
results are no further discussed. 
Phase 2 supportive study HS-13-478 
HS-13-478 was a Phase 2, multiple-dose opioid challenge study assessing blockade of subjective opioid effects 
of CAM2038 q1w in patients with moderate or severe opioid use disorder, who were physically dependent on IV 
or insufflated opioids, had self-reported opioid-use of a minimum of 21 days in the 30 days prior to screening 
and had positive urine drug screen for opioids at screening or check-in. 
The primary endpoint was the maximum rating on the visual analog scale (VAS) for ‘Drug Liking’ on a 100 mm 
bipolar scale (50 mm being neutral response and 100 mm being highest), study HS-13-478. This study is further 
described in the PD section of this report and provides evidence of opioid blockage with CAM2038 although the 
absence of dose relationship has not been justified considering the use of 32mg BPN in study HS-11-421. 
Phase 2 Supportive Study HS-15-549 
Phase 2, open-label, partially randomized, multi-center, 3-treatment group study that evaluated the 
steady-state PK of BPN and norBPN in opioid-dependent patients with a history of chronic non-cancer pain 
following multiple weekly SC administrations of CAM2038 at different injection sites or multiple monthly SC 
administrations of CAM2038 in the buttock. 
Patients had a current diagnosis of moderate to severe opioid dependence (based on DSM-5 or past medical 
history of opioid dependence) and with a history of moderate to severe chronic non-cancer pain. Patients had to 
be taking a daily dose of 24 mg SL BPN “Subutex equivalent” for at least 30 days prior to screening. 
The primary objectives were to evaluate the steady-state PK of BPN and norBPN following repeated SC 
administration of CAM2038 q1w at different injection sites (buttock, abdomen, thigh and back of upper arm) and 
to evaluate steady-state PK of BPN and norBPN following repeated SC administration of CAM2038 q4w with the 
buttock as the injection site. 
This was a phase 2 open label study investigating steady state PK following multiple injections of SC CAM2038.  
weekly injections of 32mg CAM2038 or four 128mg or 160 mg monthly CAM2038. PK data are further described 
in the PK section of this report. 
Duration of treatment was short (maximum 3 months and one week) with the main objective being to study the 
steady state profile of q1w and q4w CAM2038. Results of urine tests and craving do not contradict that of the 
other studies.

2.8.7.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study was a phase 3 randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel group, multi-centre study 
designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of CAM2038 compared to an existing standard of care (SL BPN/NX) in 
initiation and maintenance treatment with Once-Weekly and Once-Monthly, Long-Acting Subcutaneous 
Injectable Depot of Buprenorphine (CAM2038). The study involved 4 phases: Screening (3 weeks), Phase 1 (12 
treatment weeks), Phase 2 (12 treatment weeks), and Follow-up (4 weeks). The use of SL BPN/NX is acceptable. 
Subjects were on average white (75.5%) males (61.4%) of 38.4 years of age with a mean BMI of 25.9 kg/m2.  
They were heroin users in 70.8% of cases (prescription opioid pain reliver in 29.2% of cases). Concomitant use 
of other narcotic anaesthetics, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, or other central nervous 
system (CNS) depressants (including alcohol and sedative/hypnotics) was minimized during the pivotal study. If 
these sedatives were required during the study, the medical monitor was consulted. However, opioids were 
prescribed during the study for pain and tooth problems and this was seen more in the control group. The lower 
end of the 95% CI from the analysis of the primary endpoint in the ITT population is -0.1 and the applicant 
clarified in the response to another question that the ITT and the PP protocol were identical therefore it is 
concluded that such concomitant medication demonstrates the need for additional treatment in the control 
group. 
A majority (70.8%) of subjects had previously used heroin as the primary opioid of abuse, and approximately 
half (52.3%) of the subjects used injection as the route of administering opioids. They also had positive 
screening results for a number of other substances of abuse, e.g. marijuana (approx. 28%, cocaine (approx. 
25%), benzodiazepine (approx. 15%) and amphetamines (approx. 16%). A total of 91.8% of subjects had 
opioid-positive urine samples at screening down to 87.6% on Day 1 with similar numbers between groups. 
All patients received an open-label dose of active 4mg of BPN on Day 1 to test tolerability. Then patients received 
either active or matching placebo as follow: 
- an additional 4 mg SL BPN/NX (SL placebo in the CAM2038 group) was given on Day 1 with 0.32 mL SC placebo 
CAM2038 (16mg SC CAM2038 q1w in the CAM2038 group) 
- 16 mg SL BPN/NX on Days 2 and 3 (SL placebo in the CAM2038 group) 
- 16 mg SL BPN/NX and an SC injection of 0.16 mL placebo CAM2038 on Day 4 (16 mg SL placebo and 8 mg SC 
CAM2038 q1w in the CAM2038 group) 
- and 16 to 24 mg SL BPN/NX  with an optional 8mg SC injection of 16 mL of placebo CAM2038 on Days 5 to 7 
(16 to 24 mg SL placebo with an optional SC injection of 8 mg of CAM2038 q1w in the CAM2038 group).  
On the first day of Week 2 (i.e., Day 8), subjects received a CAM2038 SC injection (24 mg or 32 mg CAM2038 
q1w, or 0.48 mL or 0.64 mL CAM2038 placebo), based on total dose given by end of Week 1/Day 7. Subjects 
were also provided with one-week take-home SL BPN/NX / placebo (16 mg or 24 mg SL BPN/NX / placebo), 
based on total daily dose established at end of Week 1/Day 7.  
In Phase 2, subjects continued to receive the daily dose of SL BPN/NX or SL placebo that they received at the end 
of Phase 1. Based on their CAM2038 q1w (or SC placebo) dose at the end of Phase 1, subjects were transitioned 
to a corresponding dose of CAM2038 q4w or placebo SC injection in Phase 2. Dosage adjustment was allowed 
during at the monthly visits, up to a maximum of 32 mg SL BPN/NX (or placebo) and up to 160 mg CAM2038 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 75/116 
  
  
q4w (or placebo). The dose of 160mg has now been withdrawn by the applicant as this dose was not used by a 
sufficient number of subjects and its PK profile was not fully characterised. In study HS-11-421 1 supplemental 
dose q1w 8mg was allowed with q4w (2d phase) monthly; in study HS-14-499 supplemental q1w 8mg was 
allowed with both q1w and q4w (1 a week and up to 40mg weekly if on q1w and 2 per week if q4w). A maximum 
of 2 supplemental doses were given weekly in the open-label study but only one dose per month could be given 
in the pivotal study. Considering there are no PK data for more than one supplemental dose a week on a regular 
basis the wording of the SmPC for supplemental doses should be as follows: “A maximum of one supplemental 
Buvidal 8 mg dose may be administered at an unscheduled visit between regular weekly or monthly doses, 
based on individual patient’s temporary needs. The maximum dose per week for patients who are on weekly 
Buvidal treatment is 32 mg with an additional 8 mg dose. The maximum dose per month for patients who are on 
monthly Buvidal treatment is 128 mg with an additional 8 mg dose.  
The use of Suboxone as control is acceptable as the naloxone component doesn’t interfere with the 
pharmacodynamic properties of buprenorphine and is added to deter from misuse of the tablets. The test dose 
was followed by a dose escalation (starting dose of 16 mg CAM2038 q1w supplemented with another 8mg 
CAM2038 injection on Day 4 and also potentially between days 5 and 7). Also, patients were transitioned to q4w 
only after they had received q1w for 12 weeks. In the long-term safety and efficacy study HS-14-499 patients 
were transitioned to q4w only after a week of q1w at the earliest. The SmPC contains a recommendation for a 
test dose of SL BPN to be applied in patients who are new to buprenorphine. 
In phase 2 the maximum dose of buprenorphine from SL BPN/NX tablets was 32mg. The primary efficacy 
endpoint for EMA was the percentage of urine samples negative for illicit opioids based on the 18 urine samples 
obtained during the post-induction period (between Week 2 and Week 25). This variable was analysed via an 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with treatment effects. The difference between the two treatments in 
percent negative urine samples was obtained from this model and the two-sided 95% CI for the treatment 
difference was presented. In this analysis, if urine toxicology samples were missing, the results were imputed as 
positive. An analysis of non-inferiority in the primary efficacy variable between the two treatment arms was 
performed using a margin of 11% points. Non-inferiority was concluded if the two-sided 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for the difference between the percentage negative urine samples (Active-Control) was above -11%. 
Testing was done using hierarchical order. 
The applicant has provided a definition for the ITT and per protocol populations. All patients were included in the 
PP population since no major protocol deviation was reported in this study.  
The applicant has performed two post-hoc analyses using post-hoc defined per protocol populations. One PP 
population excludes patients with major violations relating to exposure and the second excludes the foregoing 
population along with those who missed two or more consecutive urine toxicology screens. In both PP 
populations non-inferiority was demonstrated. It would appear that major protocol violations were not well 
defined before database lock. However, the two post-hoc analyses presented are acceptable.  
The non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint is accepted, also considering that p-values are far from the 
5% limit and that superiority has been shown for some endpoints.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
These applications are for depot injections of buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid addiction in adults. 
Buprenorphine is currently available as sublingual tablets with or without naloxone; these tablets can be 
delivered daily but also for a number of days. The products are to be administered by healthcare professionals

and are meant to improve treatment adherence, improve convenience and decrease the risk of misuse and 
accidental absorption by e.g. children. 
Supportive studies looking at PK data and various PD variables support the possibility to bridge the efficacy and 
safety of SL buprenorphine to CAM2038 in the sought indication. 
Non-inferiority to SL BPN/NX was demonstrated in the pivotal study HS-11-421 for the primary endpoint of 
proportion of negative urine samples between Week 2 and Week 25 when the proposed products as 
administered sequentially over 12 weeks each (q1w then q4w). 35.1% in the CAM2038 had a negative urine test 
by the end of the treatment period compared to only 28.4% in the control group (ITT population). The difference 
between treatment groups is of 6.7% (95% CI: -0.1-13.6) with the lower end of the 95% CI close to 0 and well 
above - 11%. The same analysis without imputed data provides a 8.7% difference between treatments with a 
95% CI of 0.9-16.4.  
Treatment effect favours CAM2038 in patients using heroin at entry with a treatment difference of 13.6 % (95% 
CI: 5.3 – 21.9). But among subjects who did not inject opioids, the treatment difference was 0.00 (95% CI: 
-10.7 – 10.8); p= 0.998. The test of interaction was significant (P = 0.048), with a stronger effect seen among 
subjects who injected opioids. 
With regards to primary opioid of use at initiation, treatment effect favours CAM2038 in patients taking heroin 
(treatment difference of 14.8%, 95% CI: 95% CI: 8.0 – 21.7). But the treatment effect is clearly in favour of SL 
BPN in patients taking prescription opioids with a treatment difference of -11.6 % (95% CI: -24.6 – 1.5), i.e. 
non-inferiority was not demonstrated 
When looking at data obtained for period 1 and period 2, the difference between test and control group at the 
end of phase 1 in the ITT population is 5.9 % (95% CI: -1.3-13.1) and in phase 2 it is 8.5 % (95% CI: 1.2 - 
15.7). Therefore, non-inferiority can be inferred for both q1w and q4w, with additional superiority for the q4w 
only.  
The overall median cumulative percent urine samples negative for illicit opioids over treatment Weeks 4-24 was 
26.7% for CAM2038 vs 6.7% for SL BPN/NX. Also, treatment CAM2038 favoured for retention in the study 
(treatment difference -1.8, 95% CI: -11.2 – 7.6) and time to abstinence (p value = 0.221).  
The efficacy of CAM2038 is supported by the results from study HS-14-499 where the percent of negative urine 
tests increased from 0.0 % at baseline to 63.0% overall after 48 weeks. In stable patients who were receiving 
SL BPN at entry, the percentage of negative urine samples increased from 78.8% at baseline to 84.0% at Week 
48. Study retention was high with 68.4% of patients receiving all doses over the 48-week treatment period, 
higher that with study HS-11-421. Cravings and withdrawal outcomes also improved over the treatment period 
and patients generally reported high treatment satisfaction, including also comparison to pre-study treatment 
with daily SL BPN/NX. 
2.8.8.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data submitted in support of this application supports authorisation of Buvidal in the proposed 
indication.

2.8.9.  Clinical safety 
The safety of BPN is supported by clinical studies enrolling patients with opioid dependence (n=3,214) using the 
reference product Subutex SL tablet or Suboxone (SL BPN/NX tablet/film) at doses within the range used in the 
treatment of opioid dependence, i.e. 4 to 24 mg daily. The relative BA of BPN for CAM2038 q1w vs SL BPN 
(Subutex) was evaluated in studies HS-11-426 and HS-13-487 in part as a bridge to the established Subutex 
safety dataset. CAM2038 provided plasma levels of BPN comparable to those of daily SL BPN, supporting the use 
of Subutex as reference product. 
The pharmacological class effects of opioids are known, with nausea, constipation, headache, insomnia and 
withdrawal symptoms (e.g. hyperhidrosis, tremor, pain) being the most common adverse reactions of BPN. BPN 
may as other opioids cause respiratory depression, central nervous system (CNS) depression and dependence. 
Furthermore, opioids may cause orthostatic hypotension but have also been shown to increase pressure, e.g. 
elevate intracholedochal or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and the latter may also cause seizures. 
Opioids may also cause miosis, changes in the level of consciousness, changes in the perception of pain and 
prolonged QTc intervals. CAM2038 will as a BPN-containing opioid exhibit the same class effects and the general 
warning for the reference product is applicable to CAM2038. 
Buprenorphine as an active substance in the proposed indication is well known. The proposed product, unlike 
any other currently marketed buprenorphine product, is a depot injection and its main differences compared to 
the known safety properties of buprenorphine stem from its pharmacokinetics. A depot injection is likely to 
provide more stable blood levels of the active substance and it is not possible to remove it from the body in case 
of an overdose. It is also conceivable that the tolerance and dependence properties are different compared to 
the immediate release formulations. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 729 subjects were exposed to CAM2038 in the clinical program. Two of the 7 clinical studies included 
a total of 135 healthy volunteers exposed to CAM2038. The 5 clinical studies conducted in patients with opioid 
dependence included different subpopulations: patients on stable maintenance treatment with SL BPN for ≥ 6 
months (HS-07-307; N=42), patients who had a history of moderate to severe chronic non-cancer pain and 
were treated with SL BPN or SL BPN/NX at screening (HS-15-549; N=65), patients stabilized on IR morphine 
(HS-13-478; challenge study; N=47), untreated outpatients (HS-11-421; CAM2038: N=213; SL BPN/NX + SC 
placebo injections of CAM2038: N=215) and patients who were taking SL BPN or SL BPN/NX, or were actively 
seeking BPN treatment before enrolment (HS-14-499; CAM2038: N=227). 
The 729 subjects received in total 8693 injections (mean: 11.9 injections per subject) of CAM2038 
corresponding to 270.8 subject-exposure-years. Across regimens, 604 subjects received CAM2038 q1w and 408 
subjects received CAM2038 q4w. Many patients received both CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q1w since flexible, 
individualized dosing was applied in the Phase 3 studies, i.e. patients could switch between the regimens and 
between different dose levels (per protocol in HS-11-421 and per Investigators’ judgement in HS-14-499, i.e. 
based on patient’s stability). 132 patients were exposed to CAM2038 over 48 weeks, of whom 42 patients 
received CAM2038 q1w over the entire 48-week period, 45 patients received CAM2038 q4w over the entire 
48-week period and the remaining patients were transitioned between CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w, or vice 
versa, over 48 weeks of treatment in study HS-14-499. Only 7 patients who were exposed to weekly doses for 
at least 48 weeks and 22 patients were exposed to any dose in the q4w regimen for 48 weeks never changed 
dose.

Across all studies, the mean age was 39.5 years (range: 18 to 66 years) and 61.0% of the subjects were men. 
Most subjects were ‘White’ (78.1%) or ‘Black or African American’ (16.5%). Subjects of different BMI categories 
were exposed to CAM2038, 2.5% of the subjects were underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2), 81.2% had a BMI of 
18.5– <30 kg/m2 and 16.3% were obese (BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m2). The mean BMI was 25.6 kg/m2 (range: 15 to 50 
kg/m2). A majority of the patients had concomitant diseases and concomitant medications at study enrolment, 
but subjects with renal or hepatic impairment were excluded (see respective CSR for criteria). Concomitant 
hepatitis was common (128 patients receiving CAM2038 had hepatitis reported as ongoing at study entry). 
The development programme included healthy volunteers, patients with opioid dependence, and patients with 
pain. There were two products involved: the weekly injection (q1w) and the monthly injection (q4w). Some of 
the participants received single dose, while others received multiple doses of various lengths. Despite listing all 
exposures per study, the applicant initially failed to summarise this data to a format usable for assessment of 
safety. For the purposes of understanding the short and long-term safety, the data describing the extent of 
exposure has been presented in response to the initial list of questions outlining how many patients with target 
indication received each of the two versions of the product and for how long. This has been compared with the 
overall exposure. 
Adverse events 
Common AEs in Phase 1 Naltrexone Blockade Studies in Healthy Volunteers 
Safety was investigated in healthy volunteers under NTX blockage, i.e. the number of reported AEs also included 
AEs occurring after daily exposure to NTX throughout treatment with all 3 investigated IMPs (SL BPN [Subutex] 
and IV BPN [Temgesic] and CAM2038), which may have influenced the number and severity of reported AEs. 
128 (94.8%) of the 135 healthy volunteers who received at least one dose of CAM2038 had at least one AE. The 
most common AEs after administration of CAM2038 were dizziness (58.5% of subjects), nausea (57.8%), 
headache (33.3%), vomiting (33.3%) and somnolence (25.2%), all of which were also common for SL BPN and 
IV BPN and are known class effects of opioids. 
The number of AEs per subject-exposure-year was consistently higher for these AEs after SL BPN than after 
CAM2038 q1w or CAM2038 q4w. 
Ten subjects experienced a total of 11 injection site AEs, all of which were mild and transient. 
The number of AEs per subject-exposure-year increased with increasing dose of CAM2038 q1w, from 52.2 after 
8 mg to 94.7 after 32 mg, while no clear trend was observed after CAM2038 q4w. As for CAM2038 q1w, the 
number of AEs per subject-exposure-year increased with increasing dose of SL BPN, from 111.6 (8 mg) to 198.6 
(24 mg). 
A majority of the AEs reported after CAM2038 were assessed as related to the IMP and 91.9% of subjects 
receiving CAM2038 experienced at least one adverse drug reaction (ADR). 
703 of the 884 AEs (79.5%) occurring within 30 days of CAM2038 were of mild intensity, 175 AEs (19.8%) were 
moderate and 6 AEs (0.7%) were severe. The AEs of severe intensity were ADRs that resolved during the study 
and are known class effects of opioids. 
Two SAEs were reported by 2 subjects receiving 192 mg CAM2038 q4w. One SAE of withdrawal reaction of 
moderate intensity, which started after 35 days, lasted until the next day and was assessed as possibly related 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 79/116 
  
  
to both CAM2038 q4w and NTX. The event was classified as serious due to hospitalization and was reported as 
a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR), despite being a well-known class effect of opioids. 
The safety record of the products in this group of patients is of limited value in understanding the safety of the 
products in the target population, apart from the study of the local reactions. Buprenorphine is a substance of 
well-known clinical properties and unless adverse events are related to the excipients or the method of 
administration, they would be primarily connected to the high plasma levels acting on opioid receptors. In 
healthy subjects, presumably, there would be up or down regulation of opioid receptors and in these studies 
they would be protected by naltrexone, so the safety record seen in these studies is really only relevant to the 
clinical situation in those studies, and not particularly to the clinical situation in which the products are proposed 
to be used. 
Common AEs in the Single-dose, Dose Escalation Study (HS-07-307) and the Opioid Challenge 
Study (HS-13-478)  
Based on the design of studies HS-07-307 and HS-13-478, these studies were not included in any of the pools 
for analysis of common non-serious AEs presented by the applicant.  
Study HS-07-307 was carried out with a different formulation and it is agreed that the safety records from this 
study would not be relevant for the safety of the proposed products.  
However, study HS-13-478 is similar to the clinical situations that may be encountered in use of products. It is 
also conducted in the appropriate target population. The safety record from this study has been presented in 
response to the initial list of questions. 
Common Adverse Events in Phase 3 Studies 
Summary of AEs in Phase 3 Studies 
In total, 271 patients (61.6%) receiving CAM2038 in the Phase 3 studies reported 1240 AEs and 119 patients 
(55.3%) receiving SL BPN/NX reported 562 AEs. The mean number of AEs per subject-exposure-year was 5.1 
for patients receiving CAM2038 and 7.3 for patients receiving SL BPN/NX. The mean number of AEs per injection 
was 0.16 for patients receiving CAM2038 and 0.20 for patients receiving SL BPN/NX. 
130 patients (29.5%) receiving CAM2038 reported 443 ADRs and 64 patients (29.8%) receiving SL BPN/NX 
reported 193 ADRs. The mean number of ADRs per subject-exposure-year was 1.8 for patients receiving 
CAM2038 and 2.5 for patients receiving SL BPN/NX. 
Overall, 49.5% of the patients receiving CAM2038 reported 866 AEs of mild intensity, 32.5% reported 343 AEs 
of moderate intensity and 4.8% reported 31 AEs of severe intensity. The percentages of mild, moderate and 
severe AEs were similar between the treatments. 
87.3% of the AEs in patients receiving CAM2038 resolved, 11.9% did not resolve during the study, 0.4% 
resolved with sequelae and 1 AE (0.1%) resulted in death. The outcome was unknown for 0.2% of the AEs. 
In total, 17 patients (3.9%) receiving CAM2038 reported 20 SAEs and 13 patients (6.0%) receiving SL BPN 
reported 18 SAEs. The percentage of patients with at least one AE leading to withdrawal of treatment was 2.3% 
for patients receiving CAM2038 and 1.4% for patients receiving SL BPN.

Although the numbers presented here do not reflect the entire population involved in the clinical development 
programme, this subset allows for a comparison between those receiving the treatment and those on other 
treatments. 
As a general conclusion, it can be said that the numbers of AEs and their characteristics were comparable 
between those receiving CAM2038 and those receiving other treatments.  
AEs by Regimen and Dose in Phase 3 Studies 
The percentage of patients with at least one AE was 49.5% for CAM2038 q1w and 43.7% for CAM2038 q4w. The 
mean number of AEs per subject-exposure-year was higher for CAM2038 q1w (6.8) than for CAM2038 q4w 
(3.3), which may be explained by a visit frequency bias (patients receiving CAM2038 q1w once weekly had more 
frequent visits and had AEs collected more often than patients receiving CAM2038 q4w once monthly). 
The percentage of patients with at least one ADR was 24.6% for CAM2038 q1w and 14.6% for CAM2038 q4w. 
The mean number of ADRs per subject-expose year was 2.7 for CAM2038 q1w and 0.9 for CAM2038 q4w. 
The percentage of patients with at least one severe AE was 2.2% for CAM2038 q1w and 4.5% for CAM2038 q4w. 
The percentage of patients with at least one AE leading to withdrawal was 2.2% for CAM2038 q1w and 0.3% for 
CAM2038 q4w. 
Table below summarizes AEs by regimen in the Phase 3 studies. 
With increasing dose of CAM2038 q1w, there were trends of increasing percentage of patients with at least one 
AE, increasing number of AEs per subject-exposure-year, increasing number of ADRs per subject-exposure-year 
and increasing percentage of patients with at least one AE of severe intensity. For CAM2038 q4w (64 mg, 96 mg, 
128 mg, and 160 mg), the AE profile was more similar across dose levels. 
Table 31: Overall summary of AEs by regimen in Phase 3 studies (CAM2038 safety population) 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 81/116 
  
  
 
Although a death was recorded in the q4w subgroup and the number of patients in q1w was larger, it can still be 
seen that the related events occur more frequently in q1w group. Considering that there were no predefined 
criteria for comparison of the groups the difference can be regarded as being on the border of clinical 
significance, but it cannot be disregarded. It is also of potential significance that the dose played higher role in 
the frequency of the reported events for q1w than in q4w. 
Nature of AEs in Phase 3 Studies 
The most commonly reported AEs in the Phase 3 studies included injection site pain (overall 12.3% of patients 
receiving CAM2038), injection site swelling (8.2%), headache (7.7%), injection site erythema (7.5%), and 
nausea (7.0%). Table below shows AEs reported by at least 5% of the patients in the Phase 3 studies. The 
incidences and rates of these AEs were similar between the treatments in study HS-11-421. 
When looking at the 5 most commonly reported AEs by regimen (injection site pain, injection site swelling, 
headache, injection site erythema and nausea), the rates of these were higher for CAM2038 q1w than for 
CAM2038 q4w, which may be explained by a visit frequency bias (patients receiving CAM2038 q1w once weekly 
had more frequent visits and had AEs collected more often than patients receiving CAM2038 q4w once monthly), 
Table below. 
Across dose levels, there was a trend of increasing injection site pain with increasing dose of both CAM2038 q1w 
and CAM2038 q4w. A trend of increasing injection site swelling with increasing dose was observed for CAM2038 
q1w but not for CAM2038 q4w. Increases in injection site AEs with increasing dose, in applicant’s opinion, are 
likely to be driven by larger injection volumes at higher dose levels (the highest dose volume was slightly higher 
for q1w than q4w). 
It is difficult to draw any firm conclusion regarding dose relationships for individual PTs, however, the highest 
percentage of patients with nausea was observed at 160 mg CAM2038 q4w (9.7% of patients). 
Table 32: AEs by study, treatment group and PT (incidence of ≥ 5%) in Phase 3 studies (safety 
population)

Table 33: AEs by regimen, dose and PT (incidence of ≥ 5%) in Phase 3 studies (CAM2038 safety 
population) 
The comparison between the treatments clearly indicates the importance of the local injection site reactions for 
the safety of the products. While opioid related adverse events appear very similar across the treatment groups, 
the ones relating to the injections do not. The injection site safety should be regarded as event of special 
interest. 
It is also a curious finding that those on the open label product in HS-14-499 had somewhat lower frequencies 
of constipation than those in the oral treatment. While the numbers are too low to make reliable generalisations, 
the finding could be regarded as potentially important safety advantage. 
Intensity of AEs in Phase 3 Studies 
Overall, 49.5% of the patients receiving CAM2038 reported 866 AEs of mild intensity, 32.5% reported 343 AEs 
of moderate intensity and 4.8% reported 31 AEs of severe intensity. The percentages of mild, moderate and 
severe AEs were similar between the treatments.  
The most common PTs of severe intensity in patients receiving CAM2038 were road traffic accident, seizure and 
urinary tract infection, which were reported by 2 patients (0.5%) each. 
There was a trend of increasing rate of AEs of severe intensity with increasing dose of CAM2038 q1w, while no 
such trend was observed for CAM2038 q4w. However, the total number of patients with AEs of severe intensity 
was low (9 in total for CAM2038 q1w and 14 in total for CAM2038 qw). 
No important differences between the frequencies of severe adverse events can be deduced from these 
numbers.  
Relationship to IMP in Phase 3 Studies 
130 patients (29.5%) receiving CAM2038 reported 443 ADRs and 64 patients (29.8%) receiving SL BPN/NX 
reported 193 ADRs. The mean number of ADRs per subject-exposure-year was 1.8 for patients receiving 
CAM2038 and 2.5 for patients receiving SL BPN/NX. 
The most commonly reported ADRs in patients receiving CAM2038 in the Phase 3 studies were injection site pain 
(overall 12.3% of patients receiving CAM2038), injection site swelling (8.0%), injection site erythema (7.0%) 
and injection site pruritus (4.3%). The 3 most commonly reported non-injection site-related ADRs were 
constipation (overall 3.6% of patients receiving CAM2038), nausea (3.4%) and headache (3.0%). Table below 
shows ADRs reported by at least 1% of the patients receiving CAM2038 in the Phase 3 studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 83/116 
  
  
 
As for AEs overall, the percentage of patients with any ADRs was higher for CAM2038 q1w (24.6%) than for 
CAM2038 q4w (14.6%), which may be explained by a visit frequency bias (patients receiving CAM2038 q1w had 
more frequent visits and had AEs collected more often than patients receiving CAM2038 q4w). 
An increase in the rate of ADRs with dose was observed both for CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w. 
Few ADRs (4 in total) were of severe intensity, whereof 1 in the CAM2038 group (injection site pain) and 3 in the 
SL BPN/NX group (increased ALT, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase [γ-GT] and decreased libido), Table 
below. The one patient with an ADR of severe intensity in the CAM2038 group had a single event of severe 
injection site pain, which resolved the same day. 
One patient receiving CAM2038 was hospitalized with an SAE of vomiting 3 days after randomization and the 
first dose of IMP. The patient had a medical history of acid reflux (ongoing at Screening) had complained of 
nausea already before randomization and had induced vomiting to relieve heartburn on Day 1 of treatment. 
Further examination during the hospitalization revealed an ulcer, an oesophageal rupture and dehydration, all 
classified as non-serious AE and all likely associated with the acid reflux and the vomiting. The ADR resolved, but 
the patient withdrew from treatment. 
One patient receiving CAM2038 had ‘weight decrease’ of mild intensity considered by the investigator as 
treatment related. The event was not resolved by end of the study. The patient weighed 67.1 kg (BMI: 
23.9kg/m2) at Screening, and 56.8 kg (BMI 20.2kg/m2) at end of treatment 6 months later. No other patients 
in the Phase 3 studies had an event of ‘weight decrease’ reported as treatment related. 
One patient receiving CAM2038 had ‘lipase increase’ at the Week 25 visit (end of treatment), considered by the 
investigator as treatment related. The event resolved after 9 days. Except for the Week 25 visit, the patient had 
normal levels of lipase at all study visits. No other patients in the Phase 3 studies had an event of ‘lipase 
increase’ reported as treatment related. 
One patient receiving CAM2038 had cellulitis considered by the investigator as treatment related. The event was 
mild and resolved after 16 days. The event was not an injection site reaction. No other patients in the Phase 3 
studies had an event of non-injection site cellulitis reported as treatment related.

and PT in Phase 3 studies (safety population)

Table 35: Treatment-related AEs of severe intensity by study, treatment group and PT in Phase 3 
studies (safety population) 
The numbers are relatively small for reliable conclusions, but the trend does appear that injection site events are 
associated and more frequent in the CAM2038 groups. There is also a trend indicating the higher frequency of 
these problems with q1w product. While potentially explainable by the higher frequency of visits and injections, 
this nevertheless amounts to the potential inferiority in safety of the q1w product. If the rate of local events per 
injection was the same for q1w and q4w, this would still amount to real difference in frequencies per period of 
time in treatment. However, the importance of this difference is relatively small.  
Common Adverse Events in Multiple-dose Open-Label Studies (HS-15-549, HS-14-499) in Patients with Opioid 
Dependence  
AEs in the multiple-dose, open-label studies followed the same trends as in the Phase 3 studies, which to a large 
extent is explained by study HS-14-499 being included in both these pools. (HS-14-499 contributed with 227 of 
the 292 patients included in the multiple-dose, open-label studies).  
176 patients (60.3%) reported 838 AEs, corresponding to 4.5 AEs per subject-exposure-year.  
The 5 most commonly reported AEs in the multiple-dose, open-label studies were injection site pain (12.0% of 
patients), injection site swelling (10.3%), injection site erythema (8.2%), nausea: (7.2%) and headache 
(6.8%).  
16 patients (5.5%) reported any AE of severe intensity. Seizure and urinary tract infection (each reported by 2 
patients [0.7%]) were the only AEs of severe intensity reported by more than 1 patient. 
AEs of severe intensity was reported by 2.6% of patients receiving CAM2038 q1w and 5.9% of patients receiving 
CAM2038 q4w. 
69 patients (23.6%) reported any ADR. The most commonly reported ADRs in the multiple dose, open-label 
studies were injection site pain (12.0% of patients), injection site swelling (9.9%), injection site erythema 
(8.2%), fatigue (2.4%) and headache (2.1%).  
Focusing on the open label phase 3 studies does not reveal any trends different form the overall phase 3 pool. 
It is interesting that the injection site side events are more frequent in the phase 3 OL study HS-14-499 then in 
the phase 2 HS-15-549 study. 
Subjects could transition between weekly and monthly dosing regimens and vice versa. In the open label study 
the majority of subjects (65.6%,) had no transition between treatment regimens during the study; 33% of 
subjects (75/227) had a transition from weekly to monthly and 25.6% (58/227) had transition from monthly to 
weekly regimens. The safety of switching between regimens has been further discussed following the initial list 
of questions. A cumulative overview of safety data for subjects (those who were receiving BPN and those who 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 85/116 
  
  
 
 
were new to BPN) who transitioned from weekly to monthly and monthly to weekly regimens across the two 
phase 3 studies has been presented and the observed differences were not seen as clinically relevant.  
In the phase 3 open label study overall rates of AEs (both injection site reactions and non-injection site 
reactions) were higher in subjects who were receiving BPN at entry compared to those who were new to BPN in 
the open label study. The reason for this large discrepancy between these two populations was further discussed 
by the applicant and no clinically relevant trends were identified.  
40% of subjects in the long-term safety study required booster doses of 8mg CAM2038. The safety profile for 
subjects who received or didn’t receive booster doses has been summarised following the initial list of questions. 
The impact of these additional dose of CAM2038 on the safety profile has been discussed and found to be of no 
clinical importance.  
Injection site findings by treatment dose/regimen and anatomic location, injection site rotation and whether 
there are particular injection sites that are better for weekly versus monthly injections has been discussed by the 
applicant following the initial list of questions. The applicant has amended the SmPC to give instructions for 
choosing the injection site for monthly and weekly injections and about reinjecting.  
There were 7 cases of injection site ulceration across all studies. Five subjects in Study HS-11-421 (3, SL 
BPN/NX; 2, CAM2038) had an injection site ulcer (3, mild; 2, moderate).  Two cases of injection site ulcer were 
also reported at higher doses (96 mg and 128 mg in the Q4w regimen) in the open label studies. The 5 subjects 
in the pivotal trial with an injection site ulcer were enrolled at the same site. The ulcerative injection site 
reactions were all attributed to inappropriate injection technique by a single individual at the study site.  Further 
discussion on the cases of ulceration including further information on the inappropriate technique has been 
presented by the applicant. The appropriate instructions have been provided in the product information about 
the safe administration technique.  
Severe and Serious Adverse Events and Deaths 
Non-serious Adverse Events of Severe Intensity across Studies in Patients with Opioid Dependence (HS-07-307, 
HS-13-478, HS-15-549, HS-11-421, HS-14-499) 
Across studies in patients with opioid dependence, 31 patients (5.2%) receiving CAM2038 and 8 patients (3.7%) 
receiving SL BPN/NX reported any non-serious AEs of severe intensity. 
Four PTs of non-serious AEs of severe intensity were reported by more than 1 patient receiving CAM2038: drug 
withdrawal syndrome (2.2%), headache (0.8%), migraine (0.3%) and urinary tract infection (0.3%). The 
number of non-serious AEs of severe intensity per subject-exposure-year was higher in patients receiving 
CAM2038 q1w (0.44) than in patients receiving CAM2038 q4w (0.06). 
Non-serious ADRs of severe intensity were reported by 2 patients (0.3%) receiving CAM2038, who reported a 
total of 3 such ADRs (injection site pain, migraine and nausea) and 2 patients (0.9%) receiving SL BPN/NX, who 
also reported a total of 3 such ADRs (increased ALT, increased γ-GT and decreased libido). 
The numbers presented here are too small for any reliable generalisations, although the number of non-serious 
AEs of severe intensity per subject-exposure-year was higher in q1w group than in q4w (0.44 vs 0.06) which 
conforms to the overall trend of q1w being of inferior safety profile compared to q4w.

Serious Adverse Events in Healthy Volunteers 
Two healthy volunteers who had received CAM2038 experienced an SAE, both of which were assessed as related 
to the IMP, however, both occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of CAM2038.  
The products are not intended for administration to healthy individuals. The applicant’s handling and 
assessment of the reports of these two serious adverse events can be accepted, despite the fact that the onset 
of withdrawal symptoms at day 35 may well be linked to the discontinuation of the product. 
Serious Adverse Events across All Studies 
Across all studies, 17 subjects (2.3%) receiving CAM2038 experienced a total of 20 SAEs and 13 subjects 
(6.0%) receiving SL BPN/NX experienced a total of 18 SAEs. 
The number of SAEs was 0.07 per subject-exposure-year in subjects receiving CAM2038. 
Two SAEs were reported by more than 1 subject receiving CAM2038: road traffic accident and seizure (each 
reported by 2 subjects [0.3%]). The percentage of subjects with any SAE was 0.8% for CAM2038 q1w and 2.9% 
for subjects receiving CAM2038 q4w. 
For CAM2038 q1w, the highest number of subjects with any SAE was observed at the highest dose level (32 mg; 
3 subjects), while for CAM2038 q4w, the highest number of subjects with any SAE was observed at the lowest 
dose level (64 mg; 5 subjects). However, it is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding dose relationship due 
to the low number of SAEs. 
There was 1 treatment-related SAEs (vomiting) occurring within 30 days after the last dose of CAM2038. This 
SAE occurred in a subject receiving 16 mg CAM2038 q1w. 
Most of the SAEs were of severe intensity with 11 subjects (1.5%) receiving CAM2038 reporting 13 SAEs of 
severe intensity. 
Most SAEs (15 of 20) resolved during the study, 2 SAEs did not resolve during the study, 2 SAEs resolved with 
sequelae and 1 SAE was fatal (described  below). 
The overall SAE counts for the q1w and q4w do not follow the trends that q4w is safer although there seem to 
be a dose relationship with q1w. The numbers are, however, too low to make any reliable generalisations. It is 
not clear if the road traffic accident was the same case that resulted in death, or a separate incident. 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred in studies in the healthy volunteer studies (HS-11-426, HS-13-487) in the dose escalation 
study (HS-07-307), in the multiple-dose opioid challenge study (HS-13-478) or in the multiple-dose, open-label 
studies (HS-15-549 or HS-14-499). 
One death occurred in the CAM2038 group in study HS-11-421. The cause of death was a road traffic incident, 
which was assessed by the Investigator as unlikely related to the IMP. 
One case of death reported in the summary of safety in the dossier is related to a road traffic accident. The 
investigator has marked the event as unrelated, but the proposed SmPC bears the warring that buprenorphine 
can cause drowsiness and interfere with ability to drive and operate machinery. The proposed products are of 
different pharmacokinetic profile to the available oral buprenorphine products, which potentially can provide 
constant higher levels of buprenorphine in blood. This is especially a problem during the dose adjustment. The 
possible role of buprenorphine in this case of death cannot be entirely ruled out. The applicant was asked to 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 87/116 
  
  
discuss and consider including special warnings about driving and use of machinery during the period of dose 
adjustment in product literature.  
Other Significant Adverse Events across All Studies (Healthy Volunteer Studies and Studies in Patients with 
Opioid Dependence) 
Across all studies, 12 subjects (1.6%) receiving CAM2038 had any AE resulting in withdrawal from treatment 
(CAM2038 q1w: 1.8%; CAM2038 q4w: 0.2%). These were mainly injection site AEs and gastrointestinal events. 
AEs resulting in withdrawal from treatment reported by more than 1 subject included injection site pain and 
injection site swelling (3 subjects each), injection site erythema, injection site pruritus and injection site reaction 
(2 subjects each) and vomiting (2 subjects). 
Across all studies, 8 subjects (1.1%) receiving CAM2038 had any ADR resulting in withdrawal from treatment. 
These included injection site pain and injection site swelling (3 subjects each), injection site erythema, injection 
site pruritus, injection site reaction and vomiting (2 subjects each), and nausea, oedema peripheral and 
oesophageal rupture (1 subject each). 
Table 36: AEs leading to treatment withdrawal by regimen, dose and PT across all studies (safety 
population) 
From the data above, the safety areas of interest appear to be local injection site reactions, which is expected. 
In addition, gastrointestinal side-effects were a prominent finding in the studies. This too is expected. 
Furthermore, the injuries appear to be of importance, which is possibly related to the effects of the active 
substance on the CNS. 
Assessment report

Severe drug withdrawal syndrome was experienced by 2.2% of subjects with opioid dependence. The source of 
these reports is unclear. In study HS-07-307  the most frequent TEAE observed for 40 patients (95.2%) overall 
was drug withdrawal syndrome. This was expected due to the study design with a study duration exceeding the 
target effect duration of CAM2038-G. However, none of these cases were reported as severe in the CSR. These 
cases of severe drug withdrawal syndrome have been further discussed and clarified following the initial list of 
questions.  
Of particular interest was to find out if the GI side effects and locomotor injuries were any more frequent in 
patients treated with the products. Considering the changed PK profile, the more constant levels of 
buprenorphine might have been responsible for different overall reactions, e.g. due to different circadian 
influence etc. This issue has been clarified following the initial list of questions. No new risks with CAM2038 
compared to oral buprenorphine are identified. 
Laboratory findings 
The shift tables of clinical haematology data showed that the most frequently observed shifts from a normal 
baseline value to a low or high value at EOS in patients receiving CAM2038 were (% of patients): 
• shift from normal to low in haemoglobin (CAM2038: 7.8%; SL BPN/NX: 10.5%) 
• shift from normal to low in erythrocyte mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (CAM2038: 6.0%; SL 
BPN/NX: 7.1%) 
• shift from normal to low in erythrocytes (CAM2038: 5.1%; SL BPN/NX: 4.8%) 
These changes were similar between the treatments and may result from frequent blood sampling in the clinical 
study. 
The shift tables of clinical chemistry data showed that the most frequently observed shifts from a normal 
baseline value to a low or high value at EOS in patients receiving CAM2038 were (% of patients): 
• shift from normal to high in glucose (CAM2038: 10.5%; SL BPN/NX: 14.0%) 
• shift from normal to high in creatine kinase (CAM2038: 8.7%; SL BPN/NX: 6.5%) 
• shift from normal to high in cholesterol (CAM2038: 8.5%; SL BPN/NX: 6.5%) 
When looking specifically into increases in liver enzymes, the shift tables showed similar percentages of patients 
between the treatments (% of patients): 
• shift from normal to high in ALT (CAM2038: 5.6%; SL BPN/NX: 4.2%) 
• shift from normal to high in albumin (CAM2038: 0.5%; SL BPN/NX: 0.0%) 
• shift from normal to high in alkaline phosphatase (CAM2038: 2.5%; SL BPN/NX: 3.7%) 
• shift from normal to high in AST (CAM2038: 6.0%; SL BPN/NX: 4.2%) 
• shift from normal to high in bilirubin (CAM2038: 1.3%; SL BPN/NX: 0.5%) 
• shift from normal to high in γ-GT (CAM2038: 3.1%; SL BPN/NX: 5.1%)

Only 1 subject (in the SL BPN/NX group in study HS-11-421) in the pooled studies had ALT and AST values >3 
× ULN associated with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN. This subject did not meet the criteria for Hy’s law because the 
subject had hepatitis C reported as ongoing at time of entry. 
The shift tables of clinical coagulation laboratory showed that 10.9% of the patients in both groups had a shift 
from normal to high in prothrombin international normalized ratio (INR). 
Prothrombin time was not measured in study HS-11-421 and data on this parameter is therefore not available 
for SL BPN/NX. In patients receiving CAM2038, 6.4% of patients had a shift from normal to low, 3.6% of patients 
had a shift from normal to high and 2.7% had a shift from low to high. 
The percentages of patients with changes in laboratory values (clinical hematology, clinical chemistry and 
clinical coagulations) were similar between CAM2038 and SL BPN/NX. 
Changes in laboratory values as reported were similar between the treatment groups. However, Shift from 
normal to high for INR values following treatment with buprenorphine is noted. The clinical significance of 
increases in INR has been further discussed following the initial list of questions. No additional concerns were 
identified.

The incidence rate of the pre-defined potential AESIs was similar between CAM2038 and SL BPN/NX in the 
randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study HS-11-421, except for the AESI “Drug abuse and dependence”, 
which was more common in the SL BPN/NX group (p=0.03). No AEs were reported within this AESI in the 
CAM2038 group in HS-11-421, while ‘Accidental overdose’ (4 patients; heroin [3] and clonazepam [1]), 
‘Intentional overdose’ (1 patient; doxepin, prazosin, and venlafaxine) and ‘Substance-induced mood disorder’ 
(1 patient) were reported in the SL BPN/NX group. 
Based on pooled data from the Phase 3 studies, 10.2% of patients receiving CAM2038 and 8.8% of patients 
receiving SL BPN/NX had any treatment-related potential AESI. These were mainly within the pre-defined SMQs 
for ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ and ‘Psychiatric disorders’, all of which were known class effects of opioids. Five 
patients (1.1%) receiving CAM2038 had 5 serious events of potential AESIs and 4 patients (1.9%) receiving SL 
BPN/NX had 8 serious events of potential AESIs. In the CAM2038 group, 1 serious potential AESI (vomiting) was 
assessed as possibly treatment-related. Withdrawals from treatment due to any potential AESI were few and 
included 4 patients (0.9%) receiving CAM2038 (1 AE of sedation, 2 AEs of vomiting, 1 AE of nausea and 1 AE of 
non-cardiac chest pain) and 1 patient (0.5%) receiving SL BPN/NX (1 AE of drug withdrawal syndrome). No AEs 
of adrenal cortical insufficiency/Addison’s disease, device failure, elevated CSF or elevated intracholedochal 
pressure, miosis, orthostatic hypotension or pain perception changes were reported. 
The listed adverse events of special interest are based on the well-known safety of the active substance. The 
main difference between known oral formulations and the proposed product is in their pharmacokinetics and the 
possibility of local injection site reactions. There were also substantial number of injuries recorded in the 
development programme which are not sufficiently analysed and may need to be added to the list of events of 
special interest. 
Suicidality 
In the Phase 3 studies, 14 (3.2%) CAM2038-treated patients had any type of suicidal ideation at least once after 
Day 1; 14 (3.2%) had wished to be dead; 5 (1.1%) had non-specific active suicidal thoughts; and 3 (0.7%) had 
active suicidal ideation with any method without intent to act. Two (0.5%) patients had any type of suicidal 
behaviour at least once after Day 1, characterized as non-suicidal, self-injurious behaviour. No 
CAM2038-treated patients had an actual suicide attempt on study. No appreciable differences in C-SSRS results 
were observed between CAM2038 and SL BPN/NX in study HS-11-421. 
Cardiac safety 
QT prolongation is a known class effect of opioids. However, analyses of PK/PD relationships showed that 
CAM2038 was not associated with significant QTc interval prolongation. The QTcF profiles of CAM2038 were well 
aligned with those observed for Subutex and Temgesic in the same subjects at similar ranges of BPN plasma 
concentrations. 
The 12-lead ECG results showed that no healthy volunteers had any QTcF observation ≥ 480 ms at any 
post-baseline visit or an increase in QTcF of ≥ 60 ms from baseline at any time-point.  
Across all Studies in Patients with Opioid Dependence there was an increase from 1.8% at baseline to 2.6% at 
EOS in the number of subjects with a QTcF interval of 450 ms or longer. Only 1 patient (0.2%) (study 
HS-11-421) had a QTcF ≥500 ms at end of study. At end of study 3 (0.6%) patients (2, study HS-11-421; 1, 
study HS-14-499) had a change from baseline in QTcF ≥60 ms. Across all studies in subjects with opiod 
dependence thirteen (13) ECG related AEs were reported including 2 patients who reported QRS complex 
abnormal and   electrocardiogram QT prolonged (this patient was withdrawn from the study) and ventricular 
tachycardia. No of these AEs were assessed as being related to study drug.

The applicant has further discussed the potential for QT-prolongation with sc administration of CAM2038. The 
narratives for the 13 ECG related AES were presented for review. Appropriate warnings including a warning 
regarding the potential additive effect of CAM2038 if co-administered with other medications that prolong the QT 
interval have been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC by the applicant.  
In HS-11-421, 1 patient in each treatment group had a QTcF ≥ 500 ms at a post-baseline evaluation; both were 
isolated occurrences and none was reported in association with any cardiac-related AEs. One patient in 
HS-14-499 had a change from Baseline in QTcF of ≥ 60 ms at end of study. Similar results were observed for 
QTcB. 
In HS-11-421, 2 patients receiving CAM2038 and 3 patients receiving SL BPN/NX (not further described) had a 
clinically significant ECG abnormality reported as an AE. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities reported as AEs 
in CAM2038-treated patients across all studies included: 
 HS -15-549: 1 patient had a moderate paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (not related). 
 HS -13-478: 2 patients had mild ventricular tachycardia (possibly related), 1 patient had moderate ventricular 
extrasystoles (unrelated) and 1 patient had mild abnormal ECG STT segment (unrelated). 
 HS -11-421: 2 patients had mild atrial fibrillation and moderate abnormal ECG (not related). 
 HS -14-499: 1 patient had abnormal ECG QRS complex and prolonged QT, both of moderate intensity (not 
related), 1 patient had mild myocardial ischaemia (not related) and 1 patient had severe ventricular tachycardia 
(SAE; not related). 
The cardiac safety of the products, can generally be regarded as similar to that of oral preparations. 
Local injection site reactions – spontaneous reporting 
Across all studies, 118 subjects (16.2%) receiving CAM2038 reported a total of 385 unsolicited injection site 
AEs. The mean number of injection site AEs per injection was low (0.04) and the mean number of injection site 
AEs per subject-exposure-year was 1.4. In line with most injection site AEs by nature being treatment-related, 
109 subjects (15.0%) had any injection site ADR. 
The most commonly reported injection site AEs were injection site pain (9.3% of subjects), injection site 
erythema (5.5%) and injection site swelling (5.5%). A majority of the injection site AEs were of mild (78.7%) or 
moderate (21.0%) intensity. One injection site AE (0.3%), a transient event of injection site pain, was of severe 
intensity. 
The percentage of subjects with any injection site AE was 14.6% for CAM2038 q1w and 9.3% for CAM2038 q4w. 
There was a trend of increasing number of injection site AEs with increasing dose for both CAM2038 q1w (from 
2.7% at 8 mg to 18.3% at 32 mg) and CAM2038 q4w (from 4.5% at 64 mg to 11.1% at 160 mg). Overall, the 
percentage of subjects reporting any unsolicited injection site AE increased with increasing volume, from 2.9% 
after injection volumes of <0.27 mL to 13.7% after injection volumes of 0.45-0.64 mL. The increase in number 
of injection site AEs with increasing dose within the respective regimen (i.e. CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w) 
is, to a large extent, likely to result from the larger injection volume at higher dose levels. 
The highest rate of injection site AEs was observed after the first 5 injections and then decreased with increasing 
number of injections the subjects received. This might be due to reporting bias (higher awareness of AEs after 
the first doses), visit frequency bias (more frequent visits and thereby opportunities to report AEs in the 
beginning of the long-term studies) or that subjects not tolerating the treatment are more likely to drop out from 
studies. However, the latter is less likely since the number of withdrawals due to injection site AEs was low. 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 92/116 
  
  
The vast majority (98.4%) of the injection site AEs resolved, 1.4% did not resolve during the study and 1 (0.3%) 
was resolved with sequelae. Five subjects (0.7%) receiving CAM2038 withdrew from treatment due to any 
injection site AE. No injection site AEs were serious. 
Spontaneously reported injection site reactions were high. Around 15% of all patients reported such events. 
They were mostly mild, but in some cases there were more intense. There is a difference between spontaneous 
reports of injection site adverse reactions for q1w and q4w: 14.6% vs 9.3%. The volume of injected fluid, 
expectedly, influenced the likelihood of a reaction. To clarify the possible influence of formulations on the 
likelihood of local adverse reaction, considering that the products are given repeatedly, following  the initial list 
of questions, the applicant has presented the percentage of reactions per injection. They were comparable 
between the formulations. 
Local injection site reactions – active investigation 
There was no collection of solicited injection site reactions in the healthy volunteer studies or study HS-07-307. 
To further investigate solicited injection site reactions based on assessment forms, the following analyses were 
conducted using pooled data from studies HS-13-478, HS-15-549, HS-11-421, and HS-14-499: 
 S u m m a r y  o f in je c t io n  s it e  r e a c t io n s  a t  a n y  v is it  b y  s t u d y ;  in je c t io n  n u m b e r ;  a n d  in je c t io n  lo c a t io n  
 Wo r s t  in je c t io n  s it e  r e a ct io n  a t any visit by study; injection number; and injection location. 
These analyses were conducted using all available data reported on the assessment forms for each study; Ns 
used in the analyses are based on patients with available data. 
Overall, 63/487 (12.9%) patients reported 99 occurrences of injection site pain; 70/552 (12.7%) had 189 
occurrences of erythema/redness; 53/552 (9.6%) had 99 occurrences of swelling/oedema; 27/487 (5.5%) had 
60 occurrences of itching; 48/440 (10.9%) had 88 occurrences of tenderness; and 1/440 (0.2%) patient had a 
single occurrence of discharge. For each of these injection site signs/symptoms, reactions were mostly reported 
in the buttocks. This finding is likely a result of study 499, in which all injections were administered in the buttock 
(per protocol). Other injection site signs/symptoms were reported in the abdomen, arm, and thigh, but with 
much less frequency. 
All worst cases of injection site related erythema/redness and swelling/oedema were mild or moderate in 
severity based on the local tolerability assessment. Across all reported injection site related pain scores, 
individual pain scores ranged from 1 to 10 (with higher scores indicative of greater pain) and the majority of 
scores were ≤ 7. 
The numbers of local adverse reactions actively collected were also high. It is not clear how they compare with 
the numbers seen in spontaneous reporting. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
In patients with opioid dependence, a higher percentage of CAM2038-treated women than men had at least one 
AE (women: 69.9% [158/226]; men: 61.4% [226/368]). This pattern was not observed for the incidence of 
unsolicited injection site AEs (18.1% [41/226] vs 18.2% [67/368]) or drug-related, unsolicited injection site AEs 
(16.8% [38/226] vs 16.6% [61/368]). 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 93/116 
  
  
The mean number of AEs per patient-exposure-years after administration of CAM2038 was 9.6 in men and 7.7 
in women. 
The 2 most commonly reported PTs in women were nausea (12.8%) and urinary tract infection (11.9%); both 
occurred at a lower incidence in men (<5%). The incidence of headache was slightly lower in females (7.1%) 
than in males (11.4%), as was the incidence of injection site pain (8.4% vs 12.0%). A slightly higher percentage 
of CAM2038-treated women than men had injection site erythema (9.3%, vs 5.2%, males). The 1 severe 
unsolicited injection site AE occurred in a female patient. 
The reported differences in safety of products between men and woman are minor. The significance of increased 
frequency of nausea and urinary tract infection between men and women is unclear. This was queried and 
important differenced compared to the reference product were seen. 
Age 
No appreciable differences were observed among the age subgroups.  
One of 4 patients ≥ 65 years of age had an AE. The numbers of elderly exposed in the programme is insufficient 
to allow any conclusions on safety of the products in this age group.  
There does not seem to be any number of patients younger than 18 involved in the development programme.  A 
question about extrapolation of available data to these two populations was raised. The product information 
reflects the lack of information on the safety in elderly and paediatric populations. 
Race 
A higher percentage of CAM2038-treated ‘White’ patients than ‘Black or African American’ patients had at least 
one AE (66.9% [325/486] vs 49.5% [47/95]) or drug-related AE (32.5% [158/486] vs 17.9% [17/95]). A 
similar pattern was observed for the incidence of unsolicited injection site AEs (18.9% [92/486] vs 10.5% 
[10/95]) and drug-related, unsolicited injection site AEs (17.9% [87/486] vs 7.4% [7/95]). The mean number 
of AEs per patient exposure- years after administration of CAM2038 was 9.9 in ‘Whites’ and 2.1 in ‘Black or 
African Americans’; the mean number of unsolicited injection site AEs per patient-exposure years was 1.5 and 
0.42, respectively. 
Thirty-nine (8.0%) ‘White’ patients had a severe AE; none of the ‘Black or African American’ patients had a 
severe event. The 2 most commonly reported PTs in ‘White’ patients were injection site pain (11.7%) and 
headache (11.3%); both occurred at a lower incidence in ‘Black or African American’ patients (≤ 5.3%). 
Racial differences in safety have been recorded. The findings are inconclusive. The dossier does not discuss how 
the populations involved in the studies relate to the target European populations. This has been queried and 
sufficient information provided in the response. 
Renal Disease 
Early PK studies with IV BPN showed similar clearance in patients with normal and impaired renal function, as 
well as similar dose-corrected plasma concentrations of BPN (Hand 1990). 
BPN has in a review been concluded to be a safe choice for pain treatment of patients with reduced renal 
function, chronic renal insufficiency and hemodialysis (Böger 2006). Less has been published on the use of BPN 
in opioid-dependent patients with renal insufficiency and a literature search resulted in only 6 articles, among 
which one fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria to be assessed as directly relevant for providing information on 
benefit-risk for patients with opioid dependence undergoing BPN treatment. In addition, one other relevant 
article was found and included in the literature set after the medical expert review. 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 94/116 
  
  
One case report described an opioid-dependent patient with HCV developing acute hepatic and renal failure 
during BPN treatment, which resolved after suspension of the drug (Zuin 2009). 
The observed renal effect was most likely secondary to liver toxicity, possibly caused by direct mitochondrial 
toxicity. A similar case report has been published in a French patient with acute hepatitis and renal failure 
related to intranasal BPN misuse (Eiden 2013). 
In summary, in accordance with the label of the reference product and the proposed label for CAM2038, 
modification of the BPN dose is not generally required for patients with renal impairment (Subutex Label). 
Caution is recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 
mL/min), which may require dose adjustment. 
It is not expected that renal safety issues additional to those recognised with oral preparations will be seen due 
the formulation specific properties of the proposed products. 
Hepatic Disease 
A literature search of hepatic insufficiency and BPN resulted in 19 publications since 2007. Of those, 6 fulfilled 
inclusion and exclusion criteria to be assessed as directly relevant for providing information on benefit-risk for 
patients with opioid dependence undergoing MAT with BPN. In addition, 5 other relevant articles were found and 
included in the literature set. 
A number of case reports have been published of acute hepatic failure in patients with opioid dependence 
treated with, or misusing or abusing BPN (French 2015; Eiden 2013; Zuin 2009; Peyrière 2009). In particular, 
IV misuse appears to increase the risk of liver toxicity following BPN exposure. 
These case reports motivated a number of large prospective studies of the effects of BPN on liver health in 
patients undergoing MAT for opioid dependence. A large randomized controlled trial (CTN-0027) of 340 patients 
randomized to BPN who completed at least 24 weeks of treatment and provided at least 4 post-baseline 
transaminase specimens demonstrated no evidence of liver damage (Saxon 2013). Similar results were 
observed in a German prospective observational follow
 up study of with 181 BPN/NX-treated patients 
completing 12-month assessments, with 1-2% of patients having discrete elevations of liver enzymes and no 
‐
patient meeting the criteria for drug-induced liver injury (Soyka 2014b). Furthermore, no increased 
hepatotoxicity in BPN maintained patients compared to patients undergoing short detoxification with BPN was 
observed in a large 52-week randomized trial of over 1000 patients in China and Thailand (Lucas 2014). 
Three cohort studies examined the risk of hepatic insufficiency in opioid-dependent patients with HCV and/or 
HIV infection treated long-term with BPN (Tetrault 2016; Fareed 2014; Petry 2000). These publications found a 
higher risk of transaminase elevations in BPN-treated patients with co-infection of HCV and/or HIV, but no cases 
were considered to be clinically significant hepatic failure. Neither did a small study of BPN treatment in 4 
patients with acute HCV and elevated liver transaminases find any signs of development of hepatic failure (Bruce 
2007). 
A recent study examined PK of SL BPN/NX in patients with variable degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
classes A-C), in HCV-infected patients and healthy volunteers (Nasser 2015). The study found that severe and 
moderate hepatic impairment significantly increased exposure of naloxone and to a lesser extent of BPN. The 
combination product should therefore not be used in patients with hepatic impairment. This is in line with the 
indication for the reference product where BPN is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency 
and should be used with caution in patients with moderate impairment (Subutex Label).

The restrictions in use for those with liver impairment are necessary. Since the proposed products are depot 
injections and it is not possible to withdraw them once injected section 4.4 of the SmPC has been revised to 
reflect the fact that the products are depot injections and any measures to minimise the risks should be taken 
before administration. 
Pregnancy 
Seven pregnancies were reported within the CAM2038 clinical program: 
Four pregnancies were reported during study HS-11-421 (CSR HS-11-421): 
 S u b je c t  No .  1 0 2 -024 (CAM2038) became pregnant and lost the foetus to spontaneous abortion (reported as 
an SAE); no action was taken with IMP, and the subject completed the study. The investigator considered the 
event to be not related to the IMP. 
 S u b je ct No.105-006 (SL BPN/NX) became pregnant and discontinued the study due to the pregnancy. The 
subject declined any follow-up regarding her pregnancy; outcome of the pregnancy is unknown. 
 S u b je c t  No .  1 1 5 -006 (CAM2038) became pregnant during the study and elected to terminate the pregnancy. 
The subject chose to stop the IMP due to the pregnancy. The subject’s last injection of CAM2038 was 
administered on 05-May-2016. The subject completed the study on 14-Oct-2016. 
 S u b je c t  No .  1 3 3 -009 (CAM2038) became pregnant during the study. The subject’s partner (Subject No. 
133-010), was also a study participant (CAM2038). The couple elected to terminate the pregnancy. No action 
was taken with the IMP, and both subjects completed the study. 
Three pregnancies were reported during study HS-14-499: 
 S u b je c t  No .  9 0 -04-026 (CAM2038) had an elective abortion. 
 S u b je c t  No .  9 0 -06-026 (CAM2038) had an elective abortion. 
 S u b je c t  No .  9 0 -11-001 gave birth to a female infant who experienced an SAE of withdrawal symptoms. The 
subject had her last menstrual period on Day 77 and received her last dose of 128 mg CAM2038 q4w on Day 85. 
On Day 113, she had a positive urine pregnancy test and pregnancy was estimated to be 5 weeks gestation. On 
the same day, she was transitioned to standard of care consisting of 16 mg SL BPN daily dosing and her dose 
was tapered to 12 mg. 
She elected to withdraw from study medication. The Investigator assessed the event of infant withdrawal 
symptoms to be moderate in intensity and not related to the IMP or procedure (the subject had withdrawn from 
the study more than 230 days prior to the delivery and was taking prescribed Subutex during pregnancy and at 
the time of delivery). For further details, see the narrative located in the CSR (CSR HS-14-499). 
No studies have been conducted with CAM2038 in pregnant animals. To justify the reliance of the developmental 
and reproductive toxicity data described in the Subutex Label, bridging toxicokinetic studies were completed 
with BPN in pregnant rats and rabbits and in non-pregnant rats, and adequate margins of exposure for humans 
based on the exposure observed in pregnant rats and rabbits and the non-pregnant rat were shown. 
Animal studies demonstrated that low doses of BPN during pregnancy and lactation lead to changes in 
biochemistry and protein changes (Belcheva1998), but these changes were transient and diminished a few days 
after birth (postnatal day 7) (Belcheva 1994). Effects on offspring behaviour and neuroanatomy was observed 
following exposure of BPN (Robinson 2001), The effects could be explained by parental behaviour (i.e. pup

retrieval, grooming and hovering/crouching over the pups), being impaired during the prenatal or postnatal 
period (Barron 1997) (reviewed by Farid 2008). 
The following articles were found after a literature search on BPN and pregnancy or lactation and included after 
medical expert review. As reviewed by Goodman, opioid dependence during pregnancy is associated with 
serious adverse outcomes for the mother, the foetus, and the newborn (Goodman 2011). Use of opioids have 
been associated with numerous obstetrical complications including intrauterine growth restriction, placental 
abruption, preterm delivery, oligohydramnios, stillbirth, and maternal death (Stover 2015). Pregnant, 
opiate-dependent women experience a 6-fold increase in maternal obstetric complications such as third 
trimester bleeding, and foetal complications such as low birth weight, toxaemia, malpresentation, puerperal 
morbidity, foetal distress and meconium aspiration (Minozzi 2013). Neonatal complications include narcotic 
withdrawal, postnatal growth deficiency, microcephaly, neurobehavioral problems, increased neonatal mortality 
and a 74-fold increase in sudden infant death syndrome (Minozzi 2013). Intravenous drug use places pregnant 
women at additional risk from blood-borne disease, endocarditis, needle-site abscesses, and deep vein 
thrombosis (Goodman 2011). 
Publications on PK of BPN in pregnant women suggest that upward dose adjustments may be needed with 
advancing gestation (Kacinko 2009; Concheiro 2011; Bastian 2017). On the other hand, BPN (Minozzi 2013) as 
well as methadone and heroin are known to cross the placenta (Serra 2016) and affect placenta as well as 
foetus. 
A PK study by Concheiro 2010 showed statistically significant correlations between mean maternal daily dose of 
BPN and placenta BPN-glucuronide, as well as for norBPN-glucuronide concentrations and time to onset as well 
as duration of neonatal abstinence syndrome). In addition, norBPN/norBPN-glucuronide ratio correlated with 
and maximum NAS score, and newborn length. In another PK study by Kacinko 2008, free and total BPN and 
norBPN, nicotine, opiates, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and metabolites were quantified in meconium from 10 
infants born to women who had received BPN during pregnancy. Neither cumulative nor total third-trimester 
maternal BPN dose predicted meconium concentrations or neonatal outcomes. 
However, total BPN meconium concentrations and BPN/norBPN ratios were significantly related to NAS scores 
>4. Furthermore, as free BPN concentration and percentage free BPN increased, head circumference decreased. 
Time of last drug use and frequency of use during the third trimester were important factors associated with 
drug-positive meconium specimens (Kacinko 2008). 
A prospective observational cohort study (Chavan 2017) followed pregnant women receiving BPN for MAT of 
opioid use disorders. Data on NAS was available for 55 patients. The incidence of NAS was 34.5% (n=19). The 
occurrence of NAS was not related to the BPN dose used for MAT. 
A registry study (Wurst 2016) investigated adverse birth outcomes observed with BPN or methadone treatment 
compared to the general population. Pregnant women and their corresponding births during 2005-2011 were 
identified in the Swedish Medical Birth Register. 
746,257 pregnancies among 538,178 women resulted in 746,485 live births. No stillbirths or neonatal/infant 
deaths occurred among the 194 women treated with BPN or methadone. NAS developed in 23.3% of infants 
born to mothers treated with BPN and in 38.5% of infants born to mothers treated with methadone. The 
frequency of the selected adverse birth outcomes assessed in women treated with BPN as compared to the 
general population was not significantly different. In addition, a retrospective cohort study investigated whether 
infant gender influences the course of NAS following exposure to BPN during pregnancy. Maternal and infant 
data were collected for 46 male and 44 female infants born to women enrolled in a BPN treatment program. Male

infants experienced more severe NAS with a higher mean peak NAS score (10.04 vs. 7.98, p=0.028) and were 
more likely to require pharmacologic treatment for NAS (39.1% vs. 11.4%, p=0.005) (O'Connor 2013). 
A Cochrane review (Minozzi 2013) found 4 studies with 271 pregnant women. Three compared methadone with 
BPN and one methadone with oral slow-release morphine. The drop-out rate from treatment was lower in the 
methadone group than in the BPN group (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.41 to 1.01). The birth weight was higher in the 
BPN group in two studies, while a third study reported that there was no statistically significant difference. No 
significant difference between methadone and BPN was found for APGAR. The number of newborns treated for 
NAS did not differ significantly between groups. Only one study compared methadone- with BPN-reported side 
effects. For the mother, there was no statistically significant difference; for the newborns there were 
significantly fewer serious side effects in the BPN group. The authors conclude that while methadone seems 
superior in terms of retaining patients in treatment, BPN seems to lead to less severe NAS, but there is still a 
need for randomised controlled studies of adequate sample size comparing different maintenance treatments. 
In summary, there are not sufficient adequate data from the use of BPN in pregnant women and BPN should be 
used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus (Subutex Label). 
There were few pregnancies recorded during the development programme. The additional information has been 
supplied from the published literature. It is agreed that important additional safety issues will not be seen due 
the formulation specific properties of the products. The precautions applicable to the oral formulations should be 
sufficient for the proposed products.  
Lactation 
No data on exposure to CAM2038 are available for lactating women (one woman receiving SL BPN/NX in study 
HS-11-421 had a baby but declined to be contacted and one woman receiving CAM2038 in study HS-14-499 had 
a baby but stopped IMP >230 days before birth). 
BPN appears to transfer to human milk through diffusion, and the ratio of BPN concentration in breast milk to 
maternal serum (milk/plasma ratio) is approximately 1 (Goodman 2011). Levels in breast milk fluctuate with 
duration of time after maternal BPN dose. Because of the limited bioavailability of BPN orally, the amount of drug 
actually absorbed by the breastfed infant is assumed to be one-fifth to one-tenth of the dose present in breast 
milk. Because newborns who have been exposed to BPN in utero are habituated to much higher transplacental 
doses of BPN, limited exposure from breastfeeding is unlikely to cause adverse effects in those children. Low 
levels of BPN in breast milk are also unlikely to alleviate neonatal abstinence. Although symptoms consistent 
with NAS have been reported in infants after abrupt discontinuation of breastfeeding by mothers taking 
methadone, this phenomenon has not been observed in breastfed infants of mothers taking BPN. 
One study has investigated the transfer of BPN and its main active metabolite, nor BPN, into human milk in 7 
lactating women as well as the drug dose and effects in 6 exposed infants (Lindemalm et al. 2009). BPN and 
norBPN were found in low levels in the infants' urine and the authors conclude that the data support the use of 
BPN during breastfeeding and recommend that infants should be monitored closely. 
The proposed SmPC initially advised discontinuation of breast-feeding while on treatment with the proposed 
products. Following further consideration this has been downgraded to a warning. 
Immunological events

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Smoking 
There are no published studies indicating that smoking affects the outcome of BPN treatment of opioid 
dependence. However, smoking as a use disorder is exceptionally common in the opioid dependent population, 
and for instance, 88-95% of pregnant women receiving MAT smoke cigarettes (reviewed in Akerman 2015). 
There is a medical need for smoking cessation in particular in this subgroup of patients with opioid dependence 
and a number of studies have therefore focused on this (reviewed in Akerman 2015). 
Alcohol 
Alcohol use is very common among patients with opioid dependence and is potentially associated with significant 
morbidity and mortality, primarily as there is a risk for an additive effect on respiratory depression (reviewed in 
Nolan 2016). Another review indicated that up to one third of patients with opioid dependence has a dual 
diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, which might be a long-term risk factor for worse clinical outcome and can 
cause poor physical and mental health, including liver disorders, noncompliance, social deterioration and 
increased mortality risk (Soyka 2015). 
In the label of the reference product and the proposed label for CAM2038, BPN should not be taken together with 
alcohol and is contraindicated in patients with concomitant acute alcoholism or delirium tremens (Subutex 
Label). 
The restrictions on use of alcohol during the treatment are acceptable. 
Benzodiazepines 
A literature search of drug interactions and BPN resulted in 71 publications since 2007. Of those 24 fulfilled 
inclusion and exclusion criteria to be assessed as directly relevant for providing information on benefit-risk for 
patients with opioid dependence undergoing MAT with BPN. In addition, 3 other relevant articles were found and 
included in the literature set after medical expert review. 
Benzodiazepines have not been reported to influence BPN exposure or PK profile and the drug interaction at 
therapeutic doses appears to be a PD response in exacerbation of primarily the effects on sedation and 
depression of the respiratory and central nervous system (reviewed in Lintzeris 2010). Benzodiazepine use is 
very common in patients with opioid dependence and is thought to contribute to a large part of the fatal 
overdoses with BPN (reviewed in Jones 2012). 
Although there is a warning for concomitant benzodiazepine use in the label of the reference product (Subutex 
Label) as well as for other opioid agonists used for MAT, co-prescriptions appear to be common and contributing 
to the mortality in this patient population indicating a need for further education about the risks of respiratory 
depression with concomitant use of these medications (Abrahamsson 2017). There is a warning against 
concomitant use of benzodiazepines in the proposed label of CAM2038. 
The restrictions on use of benzodiazepines during the treatment are acceptable. 
CYP3A4 Inducers or Inhibitors 
BPN is a substrate of CYP3A4 and inhibitors of this enzyme (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, nelfinavir or 
indinavir, or azole antifungals such as ketoconazole and itraconazole, or macrolide antibiotics) might therefore 
increase BPN plasma concentrations, while CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin or 
rifampicin) might decrease BPN plasma concentrations. In the label of the reference product, these drug-drug 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 99/116 
  
  
interactions are mentioned and Subutex should be used cautiously together with these medications (Subutex 
Label). 
PK modelling after co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole was predicted to increase the 
exposure by 35% for CAM2038 q1w and by 34% CAM2038 q4w. Also, the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin was 
predicted to decrease the exposure by 26% for both CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w. These results suggest a 
lack of clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions when CAM2038 is co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitor or 
inducer (Liu published manuscript). 
The appropriate warnings regarding the use of CYP3A4 have been included in the SmPC. Buprenorphine is a 
substrate of CYP3A4. The potential for interactions is well described.  Due to lack of first-pass effect for 
CAM2038, the magnitude of drug interaction with a CYP 3A4 inhibitor or inducer may be less for CAM2038 in 
comparison to SL buprenorphine products. The applicant has discussed the impact of switching between SL BPN 
and SC CAM2083 and transitioning between weekly and monthly CAM2083 in subjects who are being treated 
with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors in their responses to the initial list of questions.  
Cocaine 
The literature safety search on drug-drug interactions with BPN identified two articles examining the effect of 
cocaine use on BPN plasma exposure in patients with opioid dependence. One study in patients treated with 
BPN/NX did not find any effect of cocaine on BPN plasma exposure (Tetrault 2015), while the other study 
indicates that cocaine use might lower BPN plasma concentrations (McCance-Katz 2010). 
Codeine 
The literature safety search on drug-drug interactions with BPN identified one article examining the effect of 
codeine on BPN exposure without finding any clinically relevant effect on PK (Gelston 2012). 
Product information does not contain sufficient warnings against the concomitant abuse of drugs. The applicant 
should review the PI and include appropriate warnings in both the SmPC and the PIL. 
Drug Interactions with Antiviral Drugs 
The majority of the articles identified in the literature safety search examine interactions between BPN and 
antiviral medications, mainly for treatment of HIV or HCV. 
Studies of the 3 direct-acting (3D) antiviral regimen containing ombitasvir, paritaprevir, ritonavir and dasabuvir, 
with and without ribavirin did not identify any clinically relevant effects on PK of BPN (King 2017; Menon 2015). 
Studies of boceprevir (Hulskotte 2015), faldaprevir (Joseph 2015), daclatasvir (Garimella 2015), 
elvitegravir/cobicistat (Bruce 2013b), raltegravir (Bruce 2013c), telaprevir (Luo 2012), darunavir-ritonavir 
(Gruber 2012; Sekar 2011), fosamprenavir-ritonavir (Gruber 2012), atazanavir (Vergara-Rodriguez 2011), 
lopinavir-ritonavir (Bruce 2010), didanosine, lamivudine, and tenofovir (Baker 2010), nevirapine 
(McCance-Katz 2010), efavirenz, delavirdine, nelfinavir and ritonavir (Moody 2009) did not identify any clinically 
relevant effects on BPN PK at therapeutic doses. 
One study has found that treatment with rifampin, but not rifabutin, might require a higher BPN dose 
(McCance-Katz 2011). 
Two studies have found that tipranavir/ritonavir might require higher BPN doses (Bruce 2011; Bruce 2009). 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 100/116 
  
  
One study has found that BPN treatment might influence the plasma concentrations of opinavirritonavir (Moody 
2009). Another study has reported that atazanavir or atazanavir/ritonavir may influence BPN PK and that a 
decreased BPN dose might be required (McCance-Katz 2007). 
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors 
The UK Subutex label states that the product should be taken cautiously together with monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors (MAOI) due to a possible exacerbation of the effects of opioids, based on experience with morphine. 
In the literature, there is one case report of a case of serotonergic syndrome triggered by BPN/NX for opioid 
dependence (Isenberg 2008). 
Overdose, Dependence, Withdrawal and Abuse 
Overdose 
An overdose of BPN causes a typical opioid toxidrome of miosis, respiratory depression, sedation, and 
hypotension (Milne 2009). Compared with the full mu-opioid agonist methadone, the partial-agonist properties 
of BPN with a potential “ceiling effect” on respiratory depression in many patients has obvious benefits for 
tolerability as well as for accidental or intentional overdose. The mortality due to overdoses with BPN is 
consequently lower than for methadone for patients retained in treatment (Marteau 2015; Kimber 2015). 
Several studies have shown that almost all cases of SL BPN overdosing have been reported to involve 
concomitant intake of benzodiazepines (Lintzeris 2010; Jones 2012). 
Compared to current standard treatment, the administration of SC CAM2038 by health care professionals in 
combination with the prolonged BPN release with less fluctuations and more stable BPN levels as well as a rapid 
and sustained blockade of the effects of exogenously administered opioids are expected to protect patients from 
illicit opioid use and potentially result in fewer occurrences of opioid overdoses. 
Withdrawal 
Symptoms of drug withdrawal (e.g. insomnia, headache, nausea, hyperhidrosis, tremor and pain) constitute a 
known pharmacological class effect of opioids after suboptimal dosing and patients should therefore be 
monitored for these symptoms to limit the risk of relapse (Subutex Label). 
For BPN, as a partial opioid receptor agonist, there is a risk of precipitating withdrawal during the initiation of the 
treatment, and to avoid this, inductions should be undertaken when objective signs and symptoms of mild to 
moderate withdrawal are evident (Subutex Label). There have been no literature reports on withdrawal 
changing the risk profile since approval of the reference product. 
BPN has been used for treatment of opioid withdrawal (reviewed in Gowing 2017). This is not the proposed 
indication for CAM2038 or the reference product Subutex, therefore, the literature on this off-label use is not 
described here. There are nevertheless no safety signals affecting the benefit-risk profile of the reference 
product based on the use of BPN in treatment of opioid withdrawal. 
Rebound has not been specifically studied with CAM2038 and no relevant literature on rebound has been 
identified. 
Abuse 
Current self-administered opioid substitution regimens are associated with several issues including e.g. misuse 
and abuse. In the EQUATOR survey, 25% of the respondents who had misused their opioid maintenance 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 101/116 
  
  
pharmacotherapy (Fischer 2012). Oral BPN misuse has been reported through crushing of the tablets followed 
by IV injection (Soyka 2013; Alho 2015; Uosukainen 2013). The addition of NX to BPN to deter parenteral 
misuse did not abolish diversion and the combination product is also misused (Alho 2015; Larance 2016). 
A large number of studies report substantial diversion of prescribed methadone and BPN (Yokell 2011; Lofwall 
2014; Launonen 2015; Reimer 2016). The exact prevalence of diversion is difficult to assess but surveys 
indicate that diversion over a period of 1 month in certain settings might be over 10% (Bleckwenn 2016) or even 
over 20% (Johnson 2015). 
In summary, BPN is subject to misuse, abuse and diversion, similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. However, as 
administration of CAM2038 is restricted to healthcare professionals, there is no potential for intentional misuse, 
abuse or diversion. 
The information provided in the dossier is sufficient. The issue of particular concern is the misuse of prescribed 
psychotropic medicines and drugs of abuse during the treatment.  The warnings regarding this are not sufficient 
in the product literature at the moment, and this will need to be addressed. The appropriate RMP measures are 
also necessary to address these concerns. 
Administration of CAM2038 is restricted to healthcare professionals. However, the condition of drug dispensing 
should be defined by national authorities. The risk of abuse, diversion and the potential for subsequent misuse 
of a prefilled syringe (i.e. intravenous injection of CAM2038) has been further discussed by the applicant. To 
limit the potential for diversion CAM2083 should be dispensed directly to the healthcare provider for 
administration by the healthcare provider to the patient. There was no evidence of attempts to extract CAM2038 
following injection. A warning regarding the potential for diversion, misuse and abuse has been included in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Long Term Safety 
The primary objective of study HS-14-499 was to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of CAM2038 in 
48-week BPN treatment in adult outpatients with opioid use disorder. 
In this study, the Full Exposure Safety Population was defined as all patients who completed scheduled visits for 
Week 48 and received their last injection (N=156). Mean duration of exposure to IMP was 48.1 (SD: 0.37) weeks 
(range: 46.9-49.9 weeks). 
In the Full Exposure Safety Population, 103 (66.0%) patients experienced at least 1 AE; 30 (19.2%) had at least 
1 injection site AE and 96 (61.5%) had at least 1 non-injection site AE. 42 (26.9%) patients had at least 1 ADR 
(19.2%, injection site AE; 11.5%, non-injection site AE). 12 (7.7%) patients had at least 1 severe AE; all of the 
severe AEs were non-injection site events. 
Nine (5.8%) patients in the Full Exposure Safety Population experienced at least 1 SAE; none were related to the 
IMP or occurred at the injection site. Eight (5.1%) patients were hospitalised. 
None of the patients in the Full Exposure Safety Population withdrew from treatment due to an AE; 4 were lost 
to follow-up. 
Overall AE incidence in the Full Exposure Safety population was higher in patients who were receiving SL BPN/NX 
at entry (74.2%) compared to patients who were new to BPN treatment (28.6%), as was the incidence of 
injection site AEs (22.7% vs 3.6%) and non-injection site AEs (68.8% vs 28.6%). The incidence of severe AEs 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 102/116 
  
  
was higher in patients who were receiving SL BPN/NX at entry (8.6% vs 3.6%), as was the incidence of SAEs 
(6.3% vs 3.6%). 
In the Full Exposure Safety population, the most common (≥ 5%) AEs were injection site pain (14.7%), injection 
site swelling (12.8%), nasopharyngitis (10.3%), nausea (9.6%), injection site erythema (9.0%), headache 
(7.7%), vomiting (7.7%), urinary tract infection (5.8%), diarrhoea (5.1%), migraine (5.1%), pain in extremity 
(5.1%), and hypertension (5.1%). 
Twelve (7.7%) patients had at least 1 severe AE, all of which were non-injection site events. 
In the Full Exposure population, 4 (1.8%) patients had at least 1 laboratory-related TEAE. None of the laboratory 
AEs were serious, severe in intensity, or related to IMP, and no laboratory AEs led to discontinuation of IMP. 
None of the patients met the criteria for Hy’s Law. 
In the Full Exposure population, 2 patients had an ECG-related AE: mild myocardial ischaemia (1 patient) and 
severe ventricular tachycardia (1 patient). None of the ECG-related AEs were related to the IMP. None of the 
vital signs or C-SSRS results indicated any clinically meaningful concerns. 
In the Full Exposure population, 2 pregnancies occurred during the study; outcome was reported as elective 
abortion (2 patients). 
In conclusion, with the exception of injection site AEs, the long-term safety profile observed with CAM2038 was 
consistent with the known systemic safety profile of BPN. No unexpected AEs were observed. All injection site 
AEs associated with CAM2038, except one, were mild to moderate in intensity and rarely led to discontinuation 
of IMP. 
The long term open label study lasted 48 instead of 52 weeks, which is closer to 11 rather than 12 months. This 
does not conform to the ICH requirements for investigation of long term safety. 
2.8.10.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety specification of CAM2038 as presented in the dossier is based on the established safety profile of BPN 
(including Subutex as reference product) and the safety profile observed in the clinical studies. 
Safety of the products is similar to the safety of oral buprenorphine products with the exception of injection site 
reactions, which were frequent. In that respect the safety of the products can be regarded as inferior to the 
safety of oral buprenorphine products. 
From the provided information, it appears that the safety of q1w is somewhat inferior to safety of q4w. This is 
primarily since q1w requires higher number of injections than q4w for the same period of time. Some other 
adverse reactions also appear in dose related manner with q1w and not with q4w, especially constipation. None 
of these differences constitutes a major concern.  
Overall exposure to CAM2038 in terms of numbers treated and duration of exposure up to 48 weeks is limited 
across the various dosing levels of both the q1w and q4w regimens; this is reflected in the SmPC. 
The products have not been investigated in those 16 to 18 years of age and those older than 66.  
The safety record gives only a limited amount of data on direct comparison of the safety of the proposed 
products to that of the licensed oral buprenorphine products. It is not possible to establish from the reported 
safety record if the relatively constant exposure to buprenorphine provided by CAM2038 introduces safety 
related issues compared to the known profile of the oral products, other than local injection site reactions.

4.  Benefit risk assessment 
4.1.  Therapeutic Context 
4.1.1.  Disease or condition 
There were at least 7585 overdose deaths reported in Europe in 2014 and in over 80% of those, illicit opioids (in 
particular heroin) were present. This is underpinned by a trend of increasing overdose deaths from methadone 
and potent synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, as shown by recent statistics from the UK and Scandinavia. This may 
also be related to poor adherence to current daily MAT, with continued on-top use of illicit opioids and other 
drugs, as well as to diversion and misuse of methadone, morphine and BPN-based medication. 
Use of injected drugs is a major risk factor for the acquisition and transmission of HIV, and about 5-10% of HIV 
infections are attributable to injecting drug use worldwide. Transmission of HIV between people who inject drugs 
is predominantly a result of the sharing of contaminated injecting equipment, but also sexual transmission, both

of which are influenced by wider structural and environmental factors such as housing, patterns of drug use and 
commercial sex work. The prevalence of HCV in drug users is also very high and estimated to be 40-80% in 
many European countries. 
4.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently available treatment options for opioid dependence vary between countries, with the full opioid mu (μ) 
opioid receptor (MOR) agonist methadone being used in 63%, buprenorphine (BPN)-based medications in 35% 
and other pharmaceutical drugs in 2% of patients in Europe. Besides methadone and BPN (with or without 
naloxone [NX]), other medicinal products for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) in Europe are the full MOR 
agonists slow-release oral morphine and supervised injectable heroin. There are several issues with currently 
available daily MAT: 
• Need for daily, often supervised, dosing resulting in inconvenience, stigma and reduced quality of life for 
patients as well as burdens on the healthcare system 
• Poor treatment adherence including continued use of illicit opioids and limited retention in treatment 
• Misuse, abuse, diversion and paediatric exposure 
• Safety concerns including respiratory depression, overdosing and cardiac events 
Several of these shortcomings are likely to contribute to health problems, the social burden on the patient, their 
relatives and the society, as well as criminality. 
There is no prolonged release form of buprenorphine available in the EU for the treatment of opioid addiction. 
4.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study HS-11-421, the pivotal study, was a phase 3 randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel 
group, multi-centre study designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of CAM2038 compared to an existing 
standard of care (SL BPN/NX) in initiation and maintenance treatment with Once-Weekly and Once-Monthly, 
Long-Acting Subcutaneous Injectable Depot of Buprenorphine (CAM2038). The study involved 4 phases: 
Screening (3 weeks), Phase 1 (12 treatment weeks), Phase 2 (12 treatment weeks), and Follow-up (4 weeks).  
Male and female subjects 18-75 years of age were recruited on the basis of primary diagnosis of moderate or 
severe opioid use disorder (DSM-5, that includes 11 symptoms, with moderate disorder if 4-5 symptoms) or 
severe disorder if > 6 symptoms).  Also, subjects were excluded from the study if they had received 
medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder within 60 days prior to randomisation.   
This study was conducted in the US only. Approximately 380 subjects (190 subjects per arm) were planned for 
study participation. A total of 428 subjects were randomized into the study (215, SL BPN/NX; 213, CAM2038). 
Following Screening and confirmation of eligibility, patients were randomized to one of two treatment groups in 
a 1:1 ratio: 
• Group 1: SL BPN/NX tablets + placebo SC injections 
• Group 2: CAM2038 SC injections + SL placebo tablets 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 110/116 
  
  
Randomized patients underwent initiation of BPN treatment with either SL BPN/NX or SC CAM2038 q1w and 
participated in weekly visits for 12 weeks (Phase 1). All patients received an open-label dose of active 4mg of 
BPN on Day 1 to test tolerability. Then patients received either active or matching placebo as follow: 
- an additional 4 mg SL BPN/NX (SL placebo in the CAM2038 group) was given on Day 1 with 0.32 mL SC placebo 
CAM2038 (16mg SC CAM2038 q1w in the CAM2038 group) 
- 16 mg SL BPN/NX on Days 2 and 3 (SL placebo in the CAM2038 group) 
- 16 mg SL BPN/NX and an SC injection of 0.16 mL placebo CAM2038 on Day 4 (16 mg SL placebo and 8 mg SC 
CAM2038 q1w in the CAM2038 group) 
- and 16 to 24 mg SL BPN/NX with an optional SC injection of 16 mL of placebo CAM2038  on Days 5 to 7 (16 to 
24 mg SL placebo with an optional SC injection of 8 mg of CAM2038 q1w in the CAM2038 group).  
On the first day of Week 2 (i.e., Day 8), subjects received a CAM2038 SC injection (24 mg or 32 mg CAM2038 
q1w, or 0.48 mL or 0.64 mL CAM2038 placebo), based on total dose given by end of Week 1/Day 7. Subjects 
were also provided with one-week take-home SL BPN/NX / placebo (16 mg or 24 mg SL BPN/NX / placebo), 
based on total daily dose established at end of Week 1/Day 7.  
After Week 12, patients were transitioned to Phase 2 with monthly visits. During Phase 2, patients in Group 1 
continued treatment with monthly dispensing of daily SL BPN/NX and monthly placebo SC injections, and 
patients in Group 2 (receiving CAM2038 q1w) were transferred to monthly injections of CAM2038 q4w and 
monthly dispensing of daily SL placebo. Patients participated in 6 visits during the 12 weeks of Phase 2; 3 
scheduled monthly visits and 3 random urine toxicology visits. At each visit, efficacy and safety outcome 
measures were assessed. 
Data for the efficacy study are supported by study HS-14-499, An Open-Label Multicenter Study Assessing the 
Long-Term Safety of a Once-Weekly and Once-Monthly, Long-Acting Subcutaneous Injection Depot of 
Buprenorphine (CAM2038) in Adult Outpatients with Opioid Use Disorder. The subject population was the same 
as for the pivotal study, male or female of 18-65 years of age with moderate to severe opioid use disorder but 
this time subjects seeking treatment as well as subjects already on SL BPN were included. This study was 
conducted in the US and in centre in Europe. 
Subjects received CAM2038 treatment for up to 12 months (48 weeks) during the study: 
• For subjects who were not receiving SL BPN or SL BPN/NX at entry, treatment was initiated with a single 
CAM2038 q1w 16 mg SC injection (following a 4 mg SL BPN/NX test dose); additional dose adjustments were 
allowed up to maximum weekly dose of 40 mg (the maximum weekly dose was increased from 32 to 40 mg in 
Protocol Amendment 2). 
• Subjects who were receiving SL BPN or SL BPN/NX at entry transitioned to CAM2038 q1w or q4w SC injections 
according to their current dose of SL BPN or SL BPN/NX. Subjects were advised not to take their ordinary SL BPN 
(or BPN/NX) tablet(s) on Day 1 (i.e., the last dose of SL BPN [or BPN/NX] was taken on the day before dosing 
with CAM2038 q1w or CAM2038 q4w). 
Subjects transitioned to CAM2038 q1w could return to the clinic for additional titration with CAM2038 q1w (8 mg 
SC supplemental injections), as needed, up to a maximum weekly dose of 40 mg per week. At any visit, the 
investigator could transition patients from q1w to q4w. 
265 subjects were screened for the study, and 228 subjects were enrolled. One subject refused to be dosed and 
withdrew consent prior to receiving the first dose of CAM2038, and 227 subjects received at least one dose of 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 111/116 
  
  
CAM2038. Of these, 190 subjects were receiving SL BPN (either SL BPN or SL BPN/NX) at entry and 37 were new 
to BPN treatment.  
PD variables evaluated in the phase 2 studies concur with the results from the two studies mentioned above. 
4.2.  Favourable effects 
This application is made under article 10.3 of the Directive 2001/83/EC, amended with reference to Subutex. 
These new depot formulations would allow to increase the choice of administration of buprenorphine for the 
treatment of opioid addition in adults with a weekly and monthly injection. 
Therefore, the pivotal study is study HS-11-421, a phase 3, double-blind, active-controlled parallel-group with 
Suboxone as comparator, which is acceptable.   
The non-inferiority study HS-11-421 is pivotal as it is a randomised double-blind comparison to the Suboxone. 
The primary endpoint prespecified in the SAP for these applications is the percentage of urine samples negative 
for illicit opioids based on the 18 urine samples obtained during the post-induction period. 35.1% in the 
CAM2038 had a negative urine test by the end of the treatment period compared to only 28.4% in the control 
group (ITT population). The difference between treatment groups is of 6.7% (95% CI: -0.1-13.6) with the lower 
end of the 95% CI close to 0 and well above - 11%. The same analysis without imputed data provides a 8.7% 
difference between treatments with a 95% CI of 0.9-16.4. Treatment difference also favoured CAM2038 when 
looking at: 
- presence or not of other drugs of abuse at baseline  
- injection of opioids 
- heroin use at initiation 
There was no effect of gender on the primary endpoint. Non-inferiority to Suboxone was demonstrated for 
CAM2038 and also for CAM2038 q4w, with additional statistical superiority for the q4w only. 
For CDF of percentage of urine samples negative over weeks 5-25 i.e. with grace period, without subjects’ 
self-reported opioid use, the median CDF was 26.7% for CAM2038 and 6.7% for SL BPN/NX with a treatment 
difference of 20% (p = 0.008).  
Retention rate - Including the 4 weeks of study follow-up, 56.8% (121/213) of the CAM2038 and 58.6% 
(126/215) of the SL BPN/NX patients finished the entire study; the proportion difference between treatment 
groups was -1.8 (95% CI: -11.2%, 7.6%), and the CAM2038 group achieved non-inferiority in retention rates 
compared to the SL BPN/NX group (P = 0.006; non-inferiority margin of 15%).  
Time to Sustained Abstinence of Opioid Use - 18.31% (39/213) in the CAM2038 group and 13.95% (30/215) of 
the SL BPN/NX patients had sustained abstinence of opioid use, with no statistical difference between the two 
groups (survival analysis p-value=0.221, log-rank). 
Desire/need to use and withdrawal symptoms decreased with time and no difference was seen between groups. 
There was no statistical difference between study groups for the use of barbiturates, amphetamine, 
phencyclidine or marijuana at any time point.  
At Week 25, the percentage of subjects in the CAM2038 group with negative urine samples was 32.9% 
compared to the SL BPN/NX group (24.2%) with an overall proportion difference overall was 8.4% (95% CI: 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 112/116 
  
  
1.1%, 15.6%) with the following times points favouring the CAM2038 group over the SL BPN/NX group: Weeks 
7, 10, 11, 12, 17, and 25. 
This is supported by the results of the long-term open-label safety and efficacy study HS-14-499. In patients 
who were receiving SL BPN at entry, the percentage of negative urine samples increased from 78.8% at baseline 
to 84.0% at Week 48 (similar results were obtained with self-reports).  
In patients who were new to BPN treatment (of whom 100% reported heroin use at screening), the percentage 
urine samples negative for illicit opioids increased from 0.0% at baseline to 63.0% at Week 48. 
Positive results are found in the phase 2 supportive studies. 
4.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The applicant has withdrawn the 160mg strength and conversion tables are available for patients not already 
taking SL BPN and for patients on maintenance SL BPN for a dose up to 24mg.  
A test dose is requested in the product information for patients not already receiving SL BPN. 
No specific dosing recommendation is required for patients with moderate OUD, patients totally new to BPN 
treatment and patients with OUD related to pain relievers.  
Further advice is given in the product information for concurrent pain relief or the possibility to extract the 
CAM2038 depot once injected. 
4.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of the active substance is relatively well known. The applicant is not proposing that any of the 
known unfavourable effects of buprenorphine would be improved by the use of their products.   
A total of 132 patients were exposed to CAM2038 over 48 weeks.  42 patients received CAM2038 q1w over the 
entire 48-week period, 45 patients received CAM2038 q4w over the entire 48-week period and the remaining 
patients were transitioned between CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w, or vice versa, over 48 weeks of treatment 
in study HS-14-499. 
Only 7 patients were exposed to weekly doses for at least 48 weeks and 22 patients were exposed to any dose 
in the q4w regimen for 48 weeks never changed dose.  The ICH guideline on extent of population exposure 
recommends 100 patients exposed for a minimum of one-year at dosage levels intended for clinical use to 
support long term safety. Although this criterion is met in terms of overall exposure, exposure in terms of 
numbers treated and duration of exposure up to 48 weeks is limited across the various dosing levels of both the 
q1w and q4w regimens.  Subjects were allowed to switch between the regimens and between different dose 
levels. Supplemental SC injections of CAM2038 q1w 8 mg were also permitted at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
Due to method of administration, the main recognised safety issue for the proposed products relates to injection 
site reactions. 
Across all studies, 118 subjects (16.2%) receiving CAM2038 reported a total of 385 unsolicited injection site 
AEs. The mean number of injection site AEs per injection was low (0.04) and the mean number of injection site 
AEs per subject-exposure-year was 1.4. In line with most injection site AEs by nature being treatment-related, 
109 subjects (15.0%) had any injection site ADR. 
Assessment report  
EMA/693347/2018 
Page 113/116 
  
  
The most commonly reported injection site AEs were injection site pain (9.3% of subjects), injection site 
erythema (5.5%) and injection site swelling (5.5%). A majority of the injection site AEs were of mild (78.7%) or 
moderate (21.0%) intensity. One injection site AE (0.3%), a transient event of injection site pain, was of severe 
intensity. 
The percentage of subjects with any injection site AE was 14.6% for CAM2038 q1w and 9.3% for CAM2038 q4w. 
There was a trend of increasing number of injection site AEs with increasing dose for both CAM2038 q1w (from 
2.7% at 8 mg to 18.3% at 32 mg) and CAM2038 q4w (from 4.5% at 64 mg to 11.1% at 160 mg). Overall, the 
percentage of subjects reporting any unsolicited injection site AE increased with increasing volume, from 2.9% 
after injection volumes of <0.27 mL to 13.7% after injection volumes of 0.45-0.64 mL. The increase in number 
of injection site AEs with increasing dose within the respective regimen (i.e. CAM2038 q1w and CAM2038 q4w) 
is, to a large extent, likely to result from the larger injection volume at higher dose levels. 
The highest rate of injection site AEs was observed after the first 5 injections and then decreased with increasing 
number of injections the subjects received. 
Overall, 63/487 (12.9%) patients reported 99 occurrences of injection site pain; 70/552 (12.7%) had 189 
occurrences of erythema/redness; 53/552 (9.6%) had 99 occurrences of swelling/edema; 27/487 (5.5%) had 
60 occurrences of itching; 48/440 (10.9%) had 88 occurrences of tenderness; and 1/440 (0.2%) patient had a 
single occurrence of discharge. 
The two formulations q1w and q4w have somewhat different safety profiles but this difference is not regarded to 
be of clinical importance. 
4.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There is limited exposure to all doses over the longer term. 
There is no data on safety in those older than 66 and those younger than 18. 
There is no substantial data on safety in pregnancy and lactation.

4.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
4.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid addiction is only currently available as sublingual tablets in Europe. It 
is agreed that additional treatment options would be beneficial for this condition. 
Non-inferiority to SL BPN/NX has been demonstrated in the pivotal study. The need for a test dose with SL BPN 
has been added to the product information documents and additional changes were proposed. No dose 
adjustment is required for special groups such as patients with moderate OUD and patients naïve to BPN 
treatment. 
From a safety point of view, it is accepted that injection reactions are to be expected. Safety data is absent for 
children and the elderly. Exposure particularly at the higher doses for both the weekly and monthly regimen is 
limited. This product is intended as a maintenance therapy with indefinite duration of treatment. The long-term 
safety with this new formulation at the doses proposed by the applicant has not been sufficiently evaluated and 
a warning is found in the SmPC. 
4.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
It is understood that opioid addiction is a major concern and that additional treatment options which could be 
helpful if increased adherence to treatment and decreased misuse and abuse is demonstrated. 
The addition of these products will allow HCP and patients to rely also on weekly or monthly buprenorphine 
depots for the treatment of opioid dependence.

4.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Buvidal prolonged release solution for injection is positive. 
5.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Buvidal is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of opioid dependence within a framework of medical, social and psychological treatment. Treatment 
is intended for use in adults and adolescents aged 16 years or over. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to special and restricted medical prescription 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and any 
subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Astellas  Pharma  Europe  B.V.  submitted  on  12  April  2020  an  application  for  marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Evrenzo, through the centralised procedure 
under Article 3 (2) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was 
agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 20 July 2017. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Evrenzo is indicated for treatment of anaemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0160/2020 on the agreement of a pediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
The PIP is not completed currently and therefore no opinion on compliance is issued yet. A positive 
partial compliance check EMEA-C2-001557-PIP01-13-M04 was completed in April 2020. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance roxadustat contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

The applicant received Scientific Advice on three occasions as mentioned in the table above for the 
development of Roxadustat for treatment of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 
adults. The Scientific Advice pertained to the following Quality and Clinical aspects: 
•  Designation of starting materials 
•  Strategy for controlling impurities in the drug substance and assessment of genotoxic impurities 
• 
Test methods and proposed specifications for the drug substance, particle size distribution 
specification limit, need to include Microbial Limit testing 
•  Dissolution method for release and stability testing 
•  Bridging strategy for demonstration of drug substance equivalence for change in manufacturing 
process 
Test methods and specifications for drug product characterisation 
• 
•  Degradation products control strategy 
• 
•  General clinical development strategy 
Tablet strength differentiation by tablet size and embossing 
•  Characterisation of cardiovascular (CV) safety: adjudicated CV safety endpoints, adequacy of 
envisaged patient exposure to evaluate CV safety, analytical approach 
In Europe, 3 National Scientific Advice meetings and 2 subsequent follow-up meetings were held in 
Sweden, Finland and the United Kingdom. Primary discussion topics included 
absorption/distribution/metabolism/ excretion (ADME), clinical pharmacology and modelling and 
simulation and clinical efficacy and safety. In addition, 2 EMA Scientific Advice meetings were held, 
with 1 subsequent follow-up meeting. Primary discussion topics included clinical, statistical and 
chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC)-related questions. EU scientific advice interactions 
included:

Justification of why any potential differences between coated and uncoated tablets for all the 
proposed strengths were not significant for the assessment of the dissolution method for the 
final product 
o  More information at the time of the MAA submission regarding test methods and 
specification 
● 
● 
The agency agreed with the sponsor’s strategy for not including the microbiological quality test 
but noted that it depended on the outcome of the microbial limit testing. 
The agency agreed with the sponsor’s proposed strategy for controlling impurities, analytical 
procedures for testing the drug substance and the drug product differentiation strategy. 
1.  Follow-up EMA Scientific Advice 
EMA (EMEA/H/SA/2684/2/FU/1/2015/I), 28 Jan 2016 
● 
Feedback provided requested redefinition of the regulatory starting material to an earlier point in 
the synthesis. 
The main change in the programme following receipt of Scientific Advice in 2014 was the addition of 
2 large efficacy and safety studies in NDD and DD patients (Studies D5740C00001 and D5740C00002). 
The purpose of these studies was to increase the number of major adverse cardiovascular events 
(death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and/or stroke) (MACE)/ MACE including hospitalisations for 
either unstable angina and/or chronic heart failure (MACE+) cases, particularly in support of the 
development in the US. This change in the programme was thought to enhance the robustness of 
conclusions to be drawn from analyses of CV events and therefore follow-up advice was not deemed 
required.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Treatment of anaemia in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools 
CKD is a growing worldwide public health challenge characterised by the progressive loss of kidney 
function, resulting in premature death or need for renal replacement therapy (kidney transplant or 
dialysis). In Europe, the average prevalence of CKD regardless of age lies between 5% and 11% 
[Zoccali et al., 2010]. CKD affects 14.8% of the US adult population, and its prevalence is growing 
rapidly [the United States Renal Data System, 2018]. All-cause mortality risk increases exponentially 
[Tonelli et al., 2006] and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) decreases [Mujais et al., 2009] as CKD 
stages advance. 
Anaemia is an important complication experienced by patients with CKD that requires careful 
management with the aim to prevent or delay the severe clinical consequences associated with 
prolonged low haemoglobin (Hb) levels. The prevalence of anaemia depends on its definition, but it 
increases in frequency and severity in the more advanced stages of CKD. Studying adult patients at 
Boston health clinics, [Hsu et al., 2001] described that mean haematocrit (Hct) values decreased with 
creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 60 mL/min in men and < 40 mL/min in women. More severe anaemia 
was common among patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 
in men and < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 in women. [Hsu et al., 2002] published another study based on 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988 to 1994) data and analysed 
15971 adults who had a serum creatinine, Hb and iron profile. Among these 15971 adults, anaemia, 
defined as Hb concentration < 12 g/dL in men and postmenopausal women and < 11 g/dL in 
premenopausal women, was more common with CrCl < 70 mL/min in men and < 50 mL/min in 
women. In comparison with subjects with CrCl > 80 mL/min, the decrease in Hb for subjects with CrCl 
of 20 to 30 mL/min was 1.4 g/dL in men and 1.0 g/dL in women. 
Various studies have reported a high prevalence of anaemia among patients with CKD. The Nadir-3 
study reported that 12.4% of patients developed anaemia (women: Hb < 11.5 g/dL; men aged > 70 
years: < 12.0 g/dL: men aged ≤ 70 years: < 13.5 g/dL) in the first year following diagnosis of stage 3 
CKD [Portoles et al., 2009]. A further cross-sectional survey of nephrologists in western Europe 
reported that among non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) patients with CKD (stage 3 and 4), the prevalence 
of moderate to severe anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dL) was 67% and prevalence of severe anaemia (Hb < 8 
g/dL) was 11% [Wiecek et al., 2013]. Over 90% of patients on dialysis are anaemic (Hb < 13.0 g/dL in 
males and < 12.0 g/dL in females) [Nakhoul & Simon, 2016]. In a cross-sectional survey of CKD 
patients under the care of a nephrologist, conducted between Jun and Sep 2012 in France, Germany, 
Italy, Spain and the UK, [Eriksson et al., 2016] reported a high prevalence of anaemia that worsened 
with the progression of kidney disease: CKD stage 3: 44%, CKD stage 4: 76%, and CKD stage 5: 
87%. Similar rates were observed by [Wong et al., 2019] in the prospective CKD Outcomes and 
Practice Patterns Study. A total of 6766 participants with CKD stages 3a to 5ND from nephrology clinics 
in Brazil, France, Germany and the US were included. Anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dL) was most prevalent in 
patients with stages 4 and 5 CKD (stage 4: Brazil: 51%, France: 44%, Germany: 86% and US: 50%; 
stage 5: Brazil: 45%, France: 18%, Germany: 2% and US: 34%) than stage 3 CKD (Brazil: 4%, 
France: 38%, Germany: 12% and US: 16%).

2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Although the pathogenesis of anaemia is multifactorial, as CKD progresses, there is a potential deficit 
in the oxygen-sensing mechanism in the kidney that may contribute to insufficient production of 
erythropoietin, a hormone produced primarily in the kidneys; this is considered an important etiologic 
factor [Fishbane & Spinowitz, 2018; Babitt & Lin, 2012; Peyssonnaux et al., 2008; Nangaku & Eckardt, 
2006]. The impaired ability of the body to absorb and use stored iron, the shorter life span of red blood 
cells (RBCs), the decrease in erythropoietin responses in hematopoietic cells due to inflammation and 
nutritional deficiency and the blood loss associated with haemodialysis (HD) are also considered 
contributing factors. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Anaemia contributes to excess morbidity and mortality in CKD patients [Foley et al., 1996]. Anaemia in 
patients with CKD is also associated with symptoms such as fatigue, reduced oxygen use, shortness of 
breath, increased cardiac output, left ventricular hypertrophy, insomnia, lethargy, headaches, 
dizziness, lack of concentration and reduced cognitive functioning, reduced libido and reduced immune 
responsiveness (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Chronic kidney disease: managing 
anaemia, Jun 2015) [Fishbane & Spinowitz, 2018; Eriksson et al., 2016; Hirakata et al., 2010]. 
Patients with the lowest Hb have worse outcomes [Unger et al., 2010]. In patients with CKD, the 
severity of anaemia correlates directly with the risk of hospitalisation, cardiovascular (CV) disease and 
death [Thorp et al., 2009]. The severity of anaemia in patients with CKD on dialysis is also strongly 
associated with increased CV disease, hospitalisation and mortality [Collins et al., 1998]. CKD patients 
on dialysis with Hct < 30% and Hb < 11.0 g/dL have an increased associated risk for death (18% to 
40% higher), whereas patients with higher Hct (33% to 36%) had a lower associated risk of death 
(7% lower) [Collins et al.,1998]. Symptoms of anaemia in patients with CKD also reduce their quality 
of life (QoL) and increase healthcare system burden [Akizawa et al., 2018; Fishbane & Spinowitz, 
2018; Covic et al., 2017; Eriksson et al., 2016]. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Treatment for anaemia associated with NDD or dialysis-dependent (DD) patients with CKD includes 
iron supplementation, RBC transfusions and/or treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) 
[Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), 2012]. 
Iron supplements alone are rarely sufficient to resolve anaemia in patients with CKD, and many 
patients with advanced CKD require additional treatment to raise Hb levels sufficiently to alleviate 
symptoms. Although iron supplementation can be effective to treat iron deficiency and reduce the need 
for blood transfusions or ESA therapy in CKD patients with anaemia, oral iron therapy is associated 
with variable absorption in the intestines and gastrointestinal side effects that may limit patient 
adherence. Furthermore, treatment with intravenous iron can potentially cause severe adverse 
reactions [Fishbane & Spinowitz, 2018; KDIGO, 2012]. Acute hypersensitivity reactions can occur 
during intravenous iron infusions, and even though these reactions are rare, they can be life-
threatening [Gómez-Ramírez et al., 2019; Rampton et al., 2014]. Intravenous iron injections also add 
to the healthcare burden as iron should be given in an environment where resuscitation facilities are 
available and caution should be exercised for every dose of intravenous iron that is given, even if 
previous administrations have been well-tolerated (New Recommendations to Manage Risk of Allergic 
Reactions with Intravenous Iron-containing Medicines; CHMP, 28 Jun 2013). 
There are no Hb thresholds specified for when to initiate RBC transfusion in CKD patients with 
anaemia; however, guidelines suggest initiation of RBC transfusion for immediate correction of 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 11/153  
 
 
 
anaemia or chronic anaemia in the absence of symptoms should be started when Hb < 7.0 g/dL [Kliger 
et al., 2013; KDIGO, 2012]. Blood transfusions are associated with a risk of allosensitisation, which 
decrease the availability of obtaining matching organs for patients eligible for kidney transplantation. 
Blood transfusions are also associated with the risk of introducing pathogens, hyperkalemia, volume 
overload and immunologic sensitisation [Obrador & Macdougall, 2013], with a longer-term risk of a 
decreased probability of receiving an immunologically-matching kidney transplant and a longer waiting 
time for patients on the waiting list for a kidney transplant [Brenner et al., 2019; Gill et al., 2013]. 
Given the need to reserve blood transfusions as a last-resort therapy mainly for cases of severe blood 
loss, the only current option for these patients is ESAs. 
Since their first approval in 1988, treatment with ESA has been effective in managing anaemia in 
patients with CKD, with a range of options now available such as the short-acting epoetin (EPO)-alfa or 
the long-acting darbepoetin alfa (DA) [Fishbane & Spinowitz, 2018; Babitt & Lin, 2012]. Treatment of 
anaemia with ESAs is standard of care in CKD [Fishbane & Spinowitz, 2018]. According to the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for the ESAs, iron status should be evaluated for all 
patients prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation is recommended when serum ferritin 
values are < 100 μg/L or transferrin saturation is < 20% [Aranesp SmPC, Dec 2019; Eprex SmPC, 
Apr 2019]. To date, there is no robust evidence to suggest that ESA is superior to another in terms of 
patient outcomes and it is considered that differences in clinical outcomes among different ESAs are 
low [KDIGO, 2012]. A review of efficacy, safety and other outcomes in clinical studies with ESAs also 
established that there is no current evidence to support the superiority of one ESA over another in 
terms of outcomes relating to economy, efficacy, QoL and safety [Arantes et al., 2018]. 
There have been safety concerns regarding the use of ESAs to achieve a high Hb target of 13.0 to 
15.0 g/dL, which is effective in the treatment of anaemia, and the resultant increase in the risk of CV 
adverse events (AEs), all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke [Unger et al., 2010; 
Pfeffer et al., 2009; Szczech et al., 2008; Drüeke et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2004; 
Besarab et al., 1998]. Data from 3 randomised controlled trials (The Normal Hematocrit Study, 
Correction of Hemoglobin and Outcomes in Renal Insufficiency [CHOIR] and Trial to Reduce 
Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy [TREAT]) identified that use of ESAs to achieve Hb targets 
of 12.5 to 14.0 g/dL caused a substantial increase in the incidence of fatal and nonfatal stroke and 
thromboembolic events [Unger et al., 2010; Weiner & Miskulin, 2010]. While these studies showed 
that there was an overall improvement of QoL with ESA treatment, there was no convincing evidence 
of any additional clinical or QoL benefits from targeting a high Hb level of 13.0 to 15.0 g/dL that were 
considered to outweigh the increased risk for nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and death. 
All ESAs are administered either intravenously or subcutaneously. Dosing schedules for intravenous 
and subcutaneous formulations are generally complex and resource-intensive, which can have a major 
impact on patients and caregivers. 
Despite the successful use of ESAs in treating CKD anaemia, optimal Hb targets are yet to be 
established [Unger et al., 2010]. Additionally, there is a subset of patients who are classified as poor 
responders, including those with inflammation [Santos et al., 2018; Solak et al., 2016; Icardi et al., 
2013; Johnson et al., 2007]. These patients have a suboptimal response to ESA therapy, evidenced by 
a lack of increase in Hb while on therapy or a requirement of increased ESA dose to maintain a stable 
Hb level [KDIGO, 2012]. Hb variability, as well as ESA poor responsiveness or non-responsiveness 
(causing low Hb levels), is associated with an increased risk of mortality compared with patients with 
stable Hb levels [Kainz et al., 2010].

About the product 
Roxadustat is an oral medication with the potential to manage CKD-related anaemia by correcting 
and/or maintaining target Hb levels. It stimulates endogenous erythropoietin production without the 
need for producing the supraphysiologic levels of circulating erythropoietin associated with parenteral 
ESA treatment. Roxadustat transiently stabilises hypoxia-inducible factor alfa subunits, leading to a 
response mimicking the natural erythropoietic response to hypoxia [Bernhardt et al., 2010]. Its ability 
to stimulate erythropoiesis makes it a candidate for the treatment of anaemia. Roxadustat is claimed 
to suppress hepcidin and activate the genes involved in iron homeostasis and therefore being effective 
at creating less need for iron supplementation [Maxwell & Eckardt, 2016].

Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by elemental analysis and various 
spectroscopic techniques: NMR (1H, 13C, and two-dimensional NMR), FTIR, UV-Vis and high-resolution 
mass spectrometry. The solid-state properties of the active substance were measured by X-ray 
crystallographic analysis. 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white to yellow powder.  
The active substance does not exhibit stereoisomerism due to the absence of chiral centres. Extensive 
polymorph screens on the active substance produced only one crystal form.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured according to a single manufacturing process. 
The active substance is synthesised using commercially available well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The 
specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have 
been presented and are considered acceptable. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Actual organic impurities, potential degradants, and potential 
process related impurities have been adequately discussed. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
The active substance manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of scientific 
knowledge, process understanding and manufacturing data, leading to defined operating ranges for 
process parameters. The proposed control strategy has been developed through an understanding of 
those process parameters and unit operations with the potential to introduce process variability and 
impact critical quality attributes (CQAs). The CQAs identified are typical for a non-sterile active 
substance and are provided as part of a summary of the control strategy. 
The active substance is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, inside a laminated 
aluminium foil outer liner, which is inside a rigid container which complies with the EC directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended on plastic materials and articles intended to come into 
contact with food. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), identity (FTIR, HPLC), assay 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), and particle size distribution (Laser Diffraction).  
The absence of tests for microbial enumeration, residual palladium, residual solvents, residual 
compounds from the sysnthesys route, elemental impurities, polymorphic form, and water content has 
been adequately justified.  
The acceptance criteria for impurities are set according to ICH Q3A. Based on a maximum daily dose of 
≤400 mg for roxadustat. Process impurities observed at reportable levels in the active substance have 
been specified and all other impurities are controlled as unspecified impurities. 
Impurities present at higher level than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified 
by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for testing of identification, assay and related substances has been provided. 
Batch analysis data of several batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial packaging for up to 36 months under long term conditions (30±2°C/65±
5%RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40±2°C/75±5%RH) according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided.

The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, impurities, water content, particle size 
distribution (PSD), X-ray powder diffraction and microbial limits. 
All tested parameters under long term and accelerated conditions were within the specifications. 
In addition to the primary stability, one pilot scale batch of the active substance was tested after 
storage at 60°C for one month. In addition, a humidity stressing study was performed using one pilot 
scale batch of the active substance after storage at 30°C/65% RH (close bottle) and 40°C/75%RH 
(open bottle) for one month. Roxadustat showed no change under these temperature and humidity 
conditions. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B performed on one pilot scale batch exposed to 
ICH Q1B option 2 showed susceptibility to photo-degradation. The results demonstrate that the active 
substance is sensitive to light and the commercial pack configuration is appropriate to protect the 
active substance from photodegradation and maintain its quality. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period and storage condition ‘Store 
protected from light’ in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as biconvex, film-coated, red coloured, immediate release (IR) 
tablets. Each tablet shape is oval (20 mg tablets (approximately 8 mm × 4 mm), 50 mg 
(approximately 11 mm × 6 mm), 100 mg (approximately 14 mm × 7 mm)), round (70 mg 
(approximately 9 mm)) and almond shaped (150 mg (approximately 14 mm × 9 mm)). Strengths are 
differentiated by size, shape, and debossing code (i.e., ‘20’, ‘50’, ‘70’, ‘100’, or ‘150’) on one side. 
The composition is summarised in 2.2.1. Introduction. 
By integrating knowledge gained from preclinical, clinical, formulation and process development 
studies, clinical trial material manufacture, and stability studies, a Quality Target Product Profile 
(QTPP) for the finished product was defined as film-coated immediate release tablets for oral 
administration containing 20 mg, 50 mg, 70 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg of roxadustat, stable for at least 
3 years and packed in polyvinyl chloride blisters with aluminum foil, and CQAs are defined as 
appearance, assay, dissolution, uniformity of dosage units and related substances.  
This QTPP was used to guide pharmaceutical development studies and to arrive to the to-be-marketed 
formulation. 
Compatibility of the active substance with the excipients of the core tablets was shown in binary 
mixtures and in a mock formulation stored at elevated temperature and humidity. Compatibility with 
excipients was additionally inferred from the results of the stability studies. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards except the coating agent which has an in-house specification. There are no novel excipients 
used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC 
and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
Hard gelatine and hypromellose capsules were used in Phase 1 and 2, and a film-coated immediate-
release tablet formulation was developed in Phase 3. Inmediate release tablet was developed to meet 
the demand for a wide range of dosage strengths. A bioequivalence study was carried out for the 150 
mg strength of the Phase 3 formulation and the proposed commercial product, and a biowaiver is

EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 15/153  
 
 
 
requested for the lower strengths. The provided comparative dissolution data support the biowaiver of 
strengths. 
The core tablets have to fulfil appropriate parameters to be coated to reach film-coated tablets in order 
to protect the photolabile active substance. The coating agent was selected based on its photoprotective 
and aesthetical attributes, as well as its resistance to bleaching or colour changes upon exposure to ICH 
Q1B Option 1 lighting conditions. Photostability study results using ICH Q1B Option 2 lighting conditions 
confirmed  that  to-be-marketed  tablet  strengths  are  photostable  in  absence  of  packaging  and  do  not 
require protection against light under intended use conditions. Therefore, the film-coated tablets are to 
be swallowed whole and are not to be chewed, broken or crushed in order to maintain protection of the 
light sensitive tablet core against photodegradation. 
The coating was also confirmed to have no effect on the dissolution rate of the finished product. 
The primary packaging consists of PVC/aluminium blisters. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of pre-blending, granulation, delumping, drying, milling, lubrication, 
compression,  film-coating,  and  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be a  standard  manufacturing 
process. 
A  process  validation  scheme  has  been  provided.  All  relevant  manufacturing  process  steps  will  be 
validated before commercial launch. This is considered acceptable for a standard process.  
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications shown in include appropriate tests for this kind 
of  dosage  form:  appearance  (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  degradants  (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (HPLC) and dissolution (Ph. Eur.). 
All degradants greater than the reporting threshold are summed and reported as total degradants. The 
limit for total degradants at release was set taking the historical batch data into account and to allow 
for both specified degradants and a small amount of unspecified degradants. 
The absence of tests for water content, residual solvents, and microbial limits in the specifications of 
the finished product has been adequately justified. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 8 
batches of finished product using a validated ICP-MS method were provided, demonstrating that each 
relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. 
During the procedure, a MO requesting to provide a risk evaluation concerning the presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the finished product applying the principles outlined in the notice 
“Information on nitrosamines for marketing authorisation holders (EMA/189634/2019)” was raised. A 
risk evaluation regarding the presence of nitrosamines addressing all potential sources listed in the 
EMA Q&A document was carried out. The risk evaluation was considered acceptable. As no risk was 
identified, confirmatory testing was considered not needed.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for several pilot and commercial scale batches of 20 mg, 50 mg, 70 
mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to 
manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 finished product pilot scale batches from each strength stored for up to 48 months 
under long term conditions (30 ± 2°C/75 ± 5%RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40 ± 2°C/75 ± 5%RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product 
are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating.  
A protocol design that employs matrixing of the batches within each dose strength is used. The matrix 
is based on ICH Guideline Q1D with the addition of full testing at 12 and 24 months to help support initial 
shelf-life  claims.  Matrixing  only  applies  to  the  30°C/75%RH  condition.  All  batches  were  tested  at  all 
timepoints for the 40°C/75%RH condition. This was considered satisfactory. 
All results passed the proposed commercial acceptance criteria. Little or no change were observed after 
48 months of storage at 30°C/75%RH, after 6 months of storage at 40°C/75%RH. 
In addition, one pilot scale batch of the 20 mg, 70 mg and 150 mg film coated tablets were exposed to 
light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. A 
dark control was added consisting of tablets in quartz dishes wrapped in aluminium foil. The tablets were 
shown to be photostable under ICH Q1B conditions. 
A bulk hold study (registration bulk hold study) was performed. Samples from two batches each of 20 
mg,  70  mg,  and  150  mg  strength  from  registration  batches  were  evaluated.  Results  are  considered 
applicable to the bracketed dose strengths 50 mg and 100 mg as all tablets are made from a common 
blend. Samples were tested after storage at 30°C/75%RH for up 24 months and 40°C/75%RH for up 6 
moths, and controlled room temperature (CRT) and ambient RH (CRT; i.e., normal working conditions 
of 20°C-25°C with excursions of 15°C-30°C allowed as long as the mean kinetic temperature is calculated 
to  be  not  more  than  25°C).  No  change  was  seen  in  appearance,  assay  and  degradants.  Only  small 
changes  were  observed  in  water  content  and  dissolution  profiles.  All  results  passed  the  proposed 
commercial specifications. 
Samples  from  one  batch  of  each  20  mg  and  150  mg  strength  were  manufactured  as  part  of  the 
cumulative bulk holding study. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 4 years and without storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
Two MOs were raised by CHMP during the evaluation: to define one of the reagents as an additional 
starting material in the synthesis of the active substance, and to provide a risk evaluation concerning 
the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product. All the issues were resolved 
satisfactorily. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In order to support the oral administration of roxadustat in CKD patients with anaemia, the nonclinical 
studies investigated the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicity of roxadustat in animals 
dosed by the oral route. Pivotal nonclinical studies described in this section were conducted in 
accordance with accepted practice for these study types and and selected toxicity and safety 
pharmacology studies were conducted in general agreement with the principles of Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The mechanism of action of roxadustat was evaluated using in vitro enzyme assays (Study 
301_05_3010_056 AMNDII), by testing the inhibitory potential of roxadustat for all three isoforms of 
the HIF-PH prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3, and collagen prolyl-4-
hydroxylase (CP4H). Another regulator of HIF activity, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) was also tested. All 
five enzymes are ketoglutaric acid-dependent non-heme iron hydroxylases. It was shown that 
roxadustat inhibited PHD1, PHD2, PHD3 and CP4H with high affinity and competitively to alpha-
ketoglutaric acid. Roxadustat IC50 values were 1.8, 2.5, 0.19 and 0.2 µM, and Ki values were 0.10, 
0.084, 0.36 and 0.33 µM for PHD1, PHD2, PHD3 and CP4H respectively. The IC50 and Ki value for FIH 
could not be determined, indicating a low affinity for this enzyme.

Cellular responses to roxadustat treatment were evaluated in Hep3B cells (Study 301_05_3040_057), 
or a clonal derivative of this cell line, 1G6. Treatment up to 30µM roxadustat resulted in dose-
dependent increases in HIF-α. A reporter gene, secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), under control of 
the HIF Response Element (HRE) present in the transfected cell lines showed a dose-dependent 
increased expression of up 155-fold. Expression of Erythropoietin (EPO) was increased similarly up to 
34-fold. The increased expression of EPO was still apparent, albeit at a lower fold change of 6.6, in the 
presence of EPO inhibiting factors TNF-α and IL-1β. A synergistic effect on SEAP and EPO expression 
was seen when cells were treated with roxadustat in the presence of IL-6. 
The effect of roxadustat on EPO production and erythropoiesis was studied in healthy mice (Studies 
301_05_3510_048 and 301_05_3510_049) and rats (Study 301_05_3510_037). EPO production was 
increased from a single dose of 6 mg/kg in mice. Erythropoiesis, as shown by increased Hb, Hct and 
reticulocytes, was increased in a dose, time and frequency-dependent manner in mice and rats. 
Although Hb was increased after 3 doses in one week of 6 mg/kg in mice, a more robust response was 
seen after the highest dose of 60 kg/mg when also Hct and reticulocytes were increased. After 4 weeks 
of dosing in rats, a dose of 30 mg/kg/week was sufficient to elicit a response on erythropoiesis, which 
became stronger with a higher dose of 60 mg/kg and more frequent dosing of twice or three times per 
week. 
In a rat model of anaemia (Study 301_07_3510_121_A01), two weeks treatment with 40 mg/kg three 
times a week (TIW) roxadustat resulted in increased erythropoiesis (increased Hb, Hct, RBC, RETI), 
reduction of microcytosis (increased MCV, MCH) and hypochromia (increased MCHC). However, this 
treatment regime was not sufficient to normalise the decreased iron levels in the anaemic animals. The 
expression of the gene encoding iron transporter DMT1 was only upregulated in non-anaemic sham-
treated animals, while iron regulator hepcidin was also decreased to normal levels in anaemic animals. 
Similar results were obtained when the animals were treated for 4 weeks at 30 mg/kg TIW (Study 
301_05_3510_047_A01). However, in contrast to 2-week treatment, plasma iron levels were increased 
after 4 weeks of treatment, as well as expression of iron transporters DMT1 and Dcytb indicating a 
delayed effect on iron levels, as this is time-dependent and will not occur within a short time period. 
In the 5/6 nephrectomy rat model of anaemia (Study 301_06_3510_071_A01), one-week dosing TIW 
followed by one week twice a week (BIW) of 20 or 40 mg/kg normalised Hb, Hct and RBC, without 
affecting serum iron levels, again indicating dosing of more than 2 weeks is required to normalise 
serum iron levels. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In the secondary pharmacology general receptor and enzyme screen, no other targets were identified 
that were inhibited by roxadustat at concentrations up to 10 µM (Studies 301_13_3010_009A2 and 
301_04_3010_010). The clinical Cmax at the maximum dose of 3 mg/kg TIW is 41.8 µM. However, 
taking into account protein binding which is 99%, then for a free fraction of 1% Cmax corresponds to 
0.41 µM, indicating that secondary binding is not an issue. 
Study 301_16_3040_187 showed that roxadustat can bind to the thyroid receptor (TR) at relevant 
concentrations (IC50 of 0.13 µM), although with much lower affinity than the natural ligand 
triiodothyronine (T3) and the TR agonist sobetirome. In an activity assay (Study 301_16_3040_185) 
using a luciferase construct, it was shown that binding of roxadustat to TRα, and β did not lead to 
significant activity of the receptors, as activation reached only 1% of the reference compound T3 when 
tested up to 300 µM, while sobetirome reached an activity of 64% of T3. At 10 µM concentration of 
roxadustat activity was only 0.3% of the T3 activity. In a second reporter assay (Study 
301_16_3040_186) using HEK293T cells with a beta-lactamase reporter gene, a maximal activity at 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 19/153  
 
 
 
TRβ of 36-39% of the reference compound was already reached at a roxadustat concentration of 3 µM. 
The activity was less pronounced at TRα, where a maximum of 15% was reached at a concentration of 
300 µM. Results show that binding to TR does not result in agonistic activity at the TR at clinically 
relevant concentrations. 
Since a reduction in glucose was seen in the toxicology studies in rats and monkeys (see toxicology 
section), a glucose tolerance test was performed in rats (Study 3510-10-047). A dose-dependent 
reduction in glucose tolerance was observed, with decreased glucose levels and increased insulin levels 
after a glucose challenge, from the lowest dose tested of 12.5 mg/kg TIW for 2 weeks.  
The mechanism behind the decreases in serum LDL, HDL and total cholesterol that were seen in 
toxicology studies was also investigated in vitro (Study 3510-12-005). Roxadustat administered 
intermittently lowered fasting serum total cholesterol, HDL and LDL, and increased fasting serum 
triglycerides compared to vehicle in a dose-dependent manner. These changes were observed after the 
first dose administration and were maintained after 2 and 4 weeks of dosing. The LDL/HDL ratio also 
tended to be lower after treatment with roxadustat. Roxadustat had no effect on fasting serum glucose 
compared to vehicle at any time point. Roxadustat increased erythropoiesis in a dose-dependent 
manner in agreement with stimulation of the HIF pathway by roxadustat.  
In order to investigate the mechanism of action of the in vivo cholesterol lowering effects of 
roxadustat, in vitro studies were carried out to determine effects on the rate-limiting enzyme in the 
cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, HMGCR (Studies 301_16_3040_184 and 350_15_3040_001). 
Roxadustat had no effect on HMGCR activity, the enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. 
However, a HIF-dependent effect was evident on HMGCR protein levels, which were reduced after 
treatment of cells with roxadustat. This was in turn dependent on increased Insig-2 expression. Results 
show that the reduction seen in serum LDL and HDL, which are also seen in the clinic, are likely due to 
a secondary effect of roxadustat on HIF and HMGCR protein levels.

When tested in the in vitro hERG channel assay, roxadustat at 93.2 μM caused 16.8% inhibition, 
indicating a low potential for repolarisation abnormalities or prolonged QT at clinical doses. 
In the cardiovascular (CV) assessment, cynomolgus monkeys treated with a single oral dose of 
roxadustat at 100 mg/kg showed up to 55% increase in heart rate (HR), from approximately 7 to 24 
hours post-dose as compared to vehicle control, while no increase in HR was observed at doses ≤ 30 
mg/kg. There were no measurable effects on BP in the cynomolgus monkey. 
Conscious rats treated with roxadustat either by iv bolus injection (30 and 60 mg/kg), or by oral 
gavage (30 and 60 mg/kg) showed an increase in HR alongside a simultaneous decrease in blood 
pressure (BP). Co-treatment with the β1-adrenergic receptor antagonist metoprolol indicated a role for 
β1-adrenergic receptors in the increase in HR, but there was no effect of metoprolol on the roxadustat-
induced decrease in BP. A cardiac function study in anesthetised rats treated orally with 60 mg/kg 
roxadustat showed cardiovascular changes, including increased HR, stroke volume, end-diastolic 
volume, and decreased systemic BP and total peripheral resistance (TPR), consistent with a reflex 
response to vasodilation. In an isolated rat heart Langendorff preparation study, roxadustat decreased 
coronary artery pressure and resistance, but did not exert direct cardiac effects on HR or cardiac 
contractility at up to 10 µg/mL (free roxadustat 1.7 µg/mL at 20 mg/kg oral dose in rats). In an in vivo 
assessment of rat regional haemodynamics, conscious rats administered 30 mg/kg iv displayed a rapid 
increase in HR and a biphasic BP response, with an early transient elevation in mean BP followed by a

prolonged decrease. The observed effects were accompanied by an early short-lived reduction in blood 
flow followed by a more sustained vasodilation in the renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vascular 
beds. In a 28-day repeat TIW dose CV study in rats, the increase in HR observed after the initial oral 
administration of 20 or 40 mg/kg on day 1 was less pronounced after repeated administration on days 
15 and 26. There was also a decrease in BP at the 40 mg/kg dose which was variable, with significant 
decreases of similar magnitude observed at days 1 and 26, but not day 15. 
In human healthy volunteers treated with roxadustat increases in heart rate have been observed, 
which were more prominent in higher dose ranges (doses greater than 2 mg/kg). In roxadustat clinical 
studies, no clinically significant differences in vital signs were observed between treatment arms in DD-
CKD and NDD-CKD pooled patient populations. 
In consideration of the mechanism of action of HR increase, evaluation of the in vitro selectivity profile 
of roxadustat did not reveal potential mechanisms that might contribute to the change in HR observed. 
The measured IC50 values for NE and DA transporters were ≥15 µM, which were higher than the 
highest estimated free concentration of roxadustat achieved in cardiovascular studies (10 µM, following 
dosing of 30 mg/kg iv in the regional blood flow study. 
These data suggested that a transient increase in HR was at least in part mediated by a reflex 
response to the transient decrease in BP. It appears that there is no direct effect of roxadustat on 
heart tissue that impacted HR, but the associated reduced total peripheral resistance (TPR) may result 
in an increase in HR as a reflex response. This mechanism is also supported by data indicating reduced 
TPR, and increased hemodynamic flow observed in regional tissues with roxadustat treatment. 
Reduced TPR is a recognised response to acute hypoxia as a physiological mechanism to optimize 
oxygen delivery and maintain tissue metabolism [Kuwahira et al, 1993]. What is currently unknown is 
the mechanism of roxadustat-induced reduction in TPR in the absence of a plausible role for off-target 
secondary pharmacology targets. HIF target genes can be related to vasodilation, such as 
adrenomedullin, heme oxygenase or nitric oxide synthase [Hu et al, 2003; Umbrello et al, 2013]. In 
summary, roxadustat has the ability to increase heart rate in a dose dependent manner in nonclinical 
studies. 
Respiratory system (Study 301_05_3510_023):  
The effect of a single iv dose of roxadustat on pulmonary function in anesthetised rats 30 min following 
administration of up to 100 mg/kg showed increased respiratory rates at ≥ 30 mg/kg. Minute volume 
increased in female rats at ≥ 30 mg/kg and in males at 100 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg, there were 
significantly increased tidal volumes in male rats only. 
Increased respiratory rate is reported as a response to hypoxia, with implication of the carotid body 
regulation of breathing rate and role of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α activation in the carotid body or 
adrenal medulla [Yuan et al, 2013]. Also, the Chuvash population with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) 
pathway disruption and increased HIF activation have increased respiratory response to hypoxia 
compared to non-Chuvash normal VHL function [Smith et al, 2006], a finding that has been 
reproduced in a mouse model of polycythemia [Slingo et al, 2014]. 
Central nervous system (Study 301_05_3510_022): No effects were seen on CNS parameters in rats 
when dosed up to 300 mg/kg single dose. 
Renal system (Study 301_05_3510_024) 
A renal function study in conscious rats showed that oral roxadustat at doses ≥ 30 mg/kg increased 
urine volumes, and urine pH was significantly higher in females at all dose levels and males at doses 
≥ 100 mg/kg. Urinary potassium (K+) concentration was significantly higher at ≥ 100 mg/kg, with K+ 
excretion ratios increased in females at all doses and in males at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg. Excretion ratios

for sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) were increased in males at all dose level, and in females at 30 and 
100 mg/kg roxadustat. 
Adverse effects in the kidney were also observed in the repeated dose toxicology studies, mainly 
related to congestion or linked to thromboembolic lesions of the kidney, and are therefore considered 
secondary to exaggerated pharmacology of roxadustat in healthy animals. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with roxadustat. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
To define absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) characteristics of roxadustat, a 
series of in vivo studies were conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans; as 
well as in vitro studies using human and animal biomaterials. The animal species used in these 
ADME/Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies included those used in the nonclinical pharmacology and 
toxicology studies. In vivo studies used either oral or intravenous administration, with oral dosing 
being the same route of administration as in pharmacology and toxicology studies and in clinical trials. 
Analytical Methods 
The analytical methods developed for the analysis of roxadustat with LC-MS/MS in plasma from mouse, 
rat, rabbit and monkey were validated with satisfactory accuracy, precision, LLOQ, dilution integrity, 
matrix effect and stability. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.000977 to 0.01 μg/mL using 
0.05 mL plasma of mice, rats, rabbits, and cynomolgus monkeys by LC-MS/MS, 0.1 μg/mL using 0.02 
mL plasma of rats by LC-MS/MS, and 0.1 μg/mL using 0.05 mL plasma of rabbits by HPLC-UV. 
Radioactive metabolite components (drug-related material) were profiled by HPLC with radiometric 
detection for selected samples to elucidate the metabolism of roxadustat. The estimates of quantitation 
were made by radioactivity and/or reference standards (when available), while the structure 
identification was based on LC/MS, LC-MSn or NMR analysis. 
Permeability and transport 
Two in vitro studies in Caco-2 cell monolayers suggest that roxadustat is highly permeable. Roxadustat 
is a substrate for the efflux transporter BCRP. No evidence of the involvement of P-gp, BSEP or MRP2 
in roxadustat intestinal transport was found in in vitro studies. 
Single dose pharmacokinetics 
The single-dose pharmacokinetics of roxadustat after oral and intravenous administration was 
investigated in rats (males), rabbits (females) and in cynomolgus monkeys (males, females). Following 
intravenous administration of roxadustat in rats (20 mg/kg) and rabbits (30 mg/kg), the plasma 
clearance approximated the hepatic blood flow. In cynomolgus monkeys, plasma clearance decreased 
with dose and approached at the highest dose (30 mg/kg) the hepatic blood flow (43.6 ml/min/kg). 
The values for Volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) were higher than the plasma volume (44.8 
mL/kg) or approached the volume of total body water (693 mL/kg), suggesting is distribution outside 
of the circulation.  
Orally administered roxadustat was rapidly absorbed with a short tmax (≤2 h), a moderate 
bioavailability in rabbits (37%), and a high oral bioavailability in rats (86%‒100%) and monkeys 
(40%‒83%). Cmax and AUC-values increased approximately dose-proportionally (rats) or more than 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 22/153  
 
 
 
dose-proportionally (rabbits, cynomolgus monkeys). No apparent gender-related difference was 
observed in oral bioavailability or other PK parameters, as found in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Repeated dose pharmacokinetics 
The toxicokinetics of roxadustat were investigated in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys as a part of 
the toxicology studies for once-daily dosing used in early, 4 week studies and intermittent dosing 
regimen of three times per week used in the longer-term studies, including the 13-week study (mice), 
the 2-years carcinogenicity studies (mice, rats), and the 22-week and 52 studies (cynomolgus 
monkeys). 
The intermittent dosing regimen demonstrated rapid oral absorption in all three species (tmax generally 
< 2 h). Cmax and AUC values increased approximately dose-proportional in mice and rats and more 
than dose-proportional in cynomolgus monkeys. There were no marked gender differences for Cmax 
and AUC values or other pharmacokinetic parameters. The plasma concentrations declined with a 
mean half-life of 3 to 4 hours in mice, 3 to 6 hours and rats and 7 to 11 hours in cynomolgus monkeys. 
All three species showed no signs of drug accumulation or change in half-life. 
Plasma protein binding 
Roxadustat is extensively bound to plasma proteins. The in vitro plasma protein binding ratios were 
90-95% in mice, 95-99% in rats, 92-98% in guinea pigs, 97-99% in rabbits, 98-99% in cynomolgus 
monkeys and 99% in human. No clear concentration dependency was observed in the range of 2 to 40 
μg/mL in mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and humans, and in the range of 2 to 400 μg/mL in 
monkeys. In human plasma, roxadustat was mainly bound to albumin with less than 1% free drug in 
the circulation. 
There was a concentration-dependent increase in the free fraction in the concentration range of 10 to 
400 μg/mL in plasma from juvenile rats aged 15, 22, 29 and 57 ±7 days. The highest level of free 
fraction was observed in the youngest rat plasma; aged 15 days (up to 2.69%), across the roxadustat 
concentration range, and the overall lowest free fraction was observed in the eldest rat plasma; aged 
57 ±7 day (0.21%).  
Distribution to red blood cells 
In vitro blood cell transfer of 14C -roxadustat in mice, rats, rabbits, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans 
were investigated. Results show that Roxadustat does not significantly distribute to red blood cells. The 
blood/plasma ratio in rats, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys (0.6-0.7) was in the same range of that 
in humans (0.6), but was somewhat higher in mice (0.8-1.1).  
Tissue distribution 
Following oral administration of 14C-roxadustat in pigmented (Long Evans) rats, radioactivity was 
widely distributed and almost all the tissues had maximum concentrations at 1-hour post-dose. 
No clear gender difference was apparent. Radioactivity was mainly presented in the gastrointestinal 
tract and excretory organs. Excluding the gastrointestinal tract, the tissues with the highest 
concentrations of radioactivity were the renal cortex, kidney, liver, renal medulla and lungs. The high 
levels in bile reflected that roxadustat-related material is excreted into the bile. The tissues with the 
lowest concentrations were seminal vesicle, medulla, spinal cord, cerebrum, bone, and eye. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 23/153  
 
 
 
Elimination of radioactivity was complete by 48 hours post-dose, with the exception of gastrointestinal 
tract, liver, and skin. There was no preferential binding of radioactivity to the skin or the uveal tract, 
indicating that roxadustat does not bind to melanin. 
Placenta transfer and transfer to milk 
In the prenatal and postnatal development study in rats, roxadustat was detected in fetal plasma, 
suggesting transfer to fetus via the placenta. Plasma concentrations of roxadustat were detected in 
pups, suggesting that roxadustat was excreted in milk, and absorbed into the pups via milk intake. On 
day 10 of lactation, milk concentrations of roxadustat increased with dose and the milk to plasma 
concentration ratios were considerably higher than concurrent plasma concentrations and (milk: 
plasma ratio = 1.4 to 4.4). 
Metabolism 
In-vitro studies 
In-vitro metabolic stability studies with liver microsomes and hepatocytes showed that roxadustat is 
nearly unchanged (microsomes) or remained as a major component across the tested species 
(humans, mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys). 
In human hepatocyte incubations, the largest metabolite by radiometric detection was C10 (~3%), 
estimated to be hydroxy roxadustat (MET4). C10 was also detected in hepatocytes from mice (~1%), 
rats (~2%), and cynomolgus monkeys (~2%). In mouse and monkey hepatocyte incubations, the 
major metabolites by radiometric detection were C4 (~18.5 and 5.2%, respectively) and C5 (~12.5 
and 3.9%, respectively), proposed as glucuronide metabolites of roxadustat. Among the minor 
metabolites observed, no human-specific metabolite was detected.

(c) 
Figure 2: Structure of a) Roxadustat, b) 4’-Hydroxy Roxadustat MET4, c) Glucuronide metabolite of 
Roxadustat MET1 
In-vitro CYP Identification studies with human liver microsomes and recombinant human enzymes 
showed that roxadustat is primarily converted in Phase I to MET4 by CYP2C8 (CLint was 0.0125 
μL/min/pmol P450) and in Phase II to MET1 by UGT1A9 (CLint was 2.29 μL/min/mg). 
In-vivo studies 
Unchanged roxadustat was the major component in plasma (as determined in rat, cynomolgus monkey 
and human), but was a minor component in urine (as determined in rat and cynomolgus monkey), bile 
(as determined in cynomolgus monkeys) and faeces (as determined in rat). 
In rats and cynomolgus monkeys, the metabolic pathways of roxadustat were glucuronidation (MET1, 
MET5), glucosidation (MET2), hydroxylation/oxidation (MET4, MET11-1 [=MET17], MET11-1

[=MET19]), dealkylation (MET6, MET7), sulfation (MET3, MET9, MET10, MET12, MET13) and 
desphenylation (M8). 
In bile duct-cannulated cynomolgus monkeys, roxadustat-related material accounted for 42.9% of the 
oral dose in the bile up to 24 h after administration of roxadustat. Constituents included roxadustat 
(4.3%), the metabolites MET3 (17.6%), MET1 (22.4%), MET2 (0.9%), MET8 (0.7%) and an 
unidentified metabolite MP7 (1.3%). 
Figure 3: Postulated, in-Vivo Metabolic Pathways of Roxadustat 
Glucuronidation (MET1), glucosidation (MET2), and hydroxylation followed by sulfation (MET3) were 
the major metabolic pathways in human. About 50% of the oral dose roxadustat was excreted in 
human faeces. Constituents included roxadustat (28.3%), the metabolites MET4 (17.2%), MET6 
(1.1%), and MET7 (2.6%). MET4 was a significant metabolite in human faeces. However, MET4 was 
not detected in human plasma nor in animal plasma, urine, faeces (rat) or bile (cynomolgus monkey). 
MET4 in human feces is most likely generated in the intestine from MET3, which is expected to be 
excreted into bile as it is in cynomolgus monkeys. In addition, comparable results of the product ion 
patterns between MET4 and MET11-1/2 (found in rat faeces) and the retention times between MET4 
and C10, indicated that one of MET11-1/2 is likely to be MET4. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
MET4 is not a human-specific metabolite. 
Excretion 
After a single oral dose of 14C-roxadustat to rats or cynomolgus monkeys, the majority of roxadustat-
related radioactivity was excreted in faeces (77%–79% in rats, 74% in cynomolgus monkeys), while a 
minor amount was recovered in urine (16%–17% in rats, 25% in cynomolgus monkeys). In contrast, 
the excretion of drug-related radioactivity in urine and faeces were nearly equal in humans (46% in

urine and 50% in faeces), suggesting differences in the primary route of elimination pathway following 
oral administration between animals and humans. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No relevant studies were performed in animal models. In vitro study results regarding potential 
involvement of roxadustat in drug interaction can be found in the clinical pharmacology sections.

A series of exploratory non-GLP tumour studies were conducted in xenograft, syngeneic and transgenic 
mouse models in order to investigate the potential effects of roxadustat on tumour promotion, 
progression, incidence and metastasis formation. No effect of tumour progression was observed at 
pharmacologically active roxadustat doses in any of the xenografted or syngeneic models tested.

Juvenile toxicity 
Dose range finding studies in juvenile animals have been performed to support future paediatric 
development of roxadustat. These preliminary studies showed that PND 15 rats are less tolerable to 
roxadustat than PND22/29 and adult rats. This resulted in a dose-dependent effect on mortality and 
growth in rats treated from PND15 onwards, whereas this was not observed in PND22 and older rats. 
The free fraction plasma concentration in PND15 rats was also higher compared to PND22 and older 
rats. 
Impurities 
Impurity was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay. 
Phototoxicity 
Roxadustat did not show phototoxic potential in the Balb/c 3T3 neutral red uptake assay. 
No dedicated studies were provided in local tolerance, antigenicity, immunotoxicity, dependence, 
metabolites toxicity.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacology studies provided by the applicant in general provide sufficient evidence for a proof 
of concept for roxadustat. In vitro results indicate that roxadustat inhibits all isoforms of the HIF-PH 
enzyme with high affinity, which results in accumulation of HIF-α and leads to increased expression of 
EPO. Several in vivo rat models of anaemia show increased EPO production and iron transport which 
provide sufficient evidence that treatment with roxadustat can be beneficial in patients suffering from 
anaemia. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 36/153  
 
 
 
 
Within in vitro inhibited HIF-PH enzymes was also collagen prolyl 4 hydrolase detected. This inhibition 
does not translate to an observable effect in vivo in animals within nonclinical studies, suggesting that 
roxadustat would have little or no effect on collagen synthesis in patients.  
It should be noted that the in vitro studies were conducted under normal oxygen conditions, which will 
not be the case in patients suffering from anaemia. 
Claimed increases in HIF-2α levels in the PD section which are responsible for erythropoiesis also play 
an important role in tumour progression and metastasis (Carroll VA, Ashcroft M., 2006). According to 
the analysis submitted by the applicant (results of nonclinical studies and cumulative clinical 
observations in a substantial number of patients) it could be concluded that roxadustat did not 
promote tumour formation. 
Accumulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α increase the expression of key enzymes for glycolysis (incl. 
increase IRS2 expression, which would lead to an increase in insulin secretion), leading to the increase 
in glucose consumption and a potential decrease in plasma glucose. Some statistically significant 
changes in blood glucose were observed in the 26-week intermittent dose studies in SD rats or F344 
rats.  However, these changes were transient or mild-to-moderate changes that were not associated 
with histopathologically relevant changes, suggesting that they were not biologically or toxicologically 
meaningful.  No effects on glucose parameters were seen in the clinical studies. Therefore, this effect is 
likely not relevant for humans. 
Also, vasodilation via HIF stimulation (targeting gens such as iNOS) is considered to be commonly 
conserved among animal species (incl. human), the sufficient safety margin between findings in rats 
and monkey to human exposure exist and in the clinical phase 3 programme, there was no overt signal 
of a hypotensive effect attributable to Roxadustat. It is expected that sufficient safety margin within 
animal to human exposure for vasodilatory findings exist. 
An in vitro pharmacodynamic study (301-05-3010-056) revealed that inhibition of HIF-PHs is 
independent of iron concentration. Although erythropoiesis is iron dependent, the basal levels of iron 
on hematopoiesis in administration of roxadustat in animal model or in clinical trials did not impact the 
initial erythropoietic effect of roxadustat. In the absence of clear evidence that iron supplementation 
enhances the erythropoietic effect of roxadustat, a decision on recommending iron supplementation 
would depend on multiple clinical factors including benefit risk analysis for the patient. 
In safety pharmacology studies, mainly effects that can be related to the pharmacological action of 
roxadustat were observed. Roxadustat had an effect on heart rate (HR) in monkeys, where it increased 
HR by 55% at the highest dose of 100 mg/kg tested. The mechanism behind this effect on cardiac 
function is not fully clear, but a pharmacology-related mechanism seems likely, since these effects are 
associated with acute hypoxia in order to increase the amount of oxygen circulated throughout the 
body, and could thus be in response to the increases in HIFα. This is further substantiated by the fact 
that increases in HR were seen in healthy volunteers given roxadustat, but no such effect was seen in 
patients that already have the physiological response to decreased oxygen concentration, and 
therefore the added effect of roxadustat is less pronounced than in healthy volunteers. Additionally, a 
renal function study in conscious rats showed that oral roxadustat increased urine volumes, and urine 
pH was significantly higher and increases in potassium (K+), sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) were 
seen. The effect was only seen at higher doses, with a safety margin of 1.8-fold, and appear to be rat-
specific as no effects were seen in the monkey studies. Moreover, no adverse effects on the urinary 
system were reported in patients with decreased renal function. A clinical relevance of the renal 
findings in rats for patients is therefore unlikely.

Pharmacokinetics 
Regarding the pharmacokinetics section, the applicant was requested to further discuss whether the 
safety of the metabolite MET4 in human has been sufficiently covered in the animal studies, regarding 
potential effects as the result of enterohepatic circulation of and/or drug interactions via transporter 
proteins. MET4 was a significant metabolite in human faeces. However, MET4 was not detected in 
human plasma nor in animal plasma, urine, faeces (rat) or bile (cynomolgus monkey). It is assumed 
that in monkeys, MET 3 is deconjugated in faeces by intestinal bacteria, similar to troglitazone, for 
which the sulfate position is the same as with MET3. In addition, one of MET11-1/2 (found in rat feces) 
is likely to be MET4, based on comparable results of the product ion patterns between MET4 and 
MET11-1 and the retention times between MET4 and C10. 
No pharmacokinetic parameters were submitted for the animal model of disease.  However, as 
Roxadustat is extensively metabolised and excreted only in minor amount (as parent compound) into 
the urine, the PK characteristics of animal model of disease and healthy animal are expected to be very 
similar. 
The results from HPLC-LSC method to measure plasma roxadustat concentrations in selected samples 
are considered as sufficiently reliable to conclude that no metabolites were present at more than 10% 
of the total drug-related material. 
The trend test for onset rate of fibrosarcoma in skin/subcutis fibrosarcoma was statistically significant. 
Roxadustat is distributed to skin. However, no clear dose-response relationship of fibrosarcoma was 
demonstrated across groups. In addition, the incidence is in a range for historical control for female 
mice. The results therefore do not suggest any compound-related increase over the basal levels of 
skin/subcutis fibrosarcoma. 
Toxicology 
Further discussion on clinical relevance of the myelofibrosis observed in the 4-week study in SD rats 
(ISN: 301_05_3510_019) and the possible mode of action was requested. The applicant clarified that 
myelofibrosis observed in the 4-week repeat-dose study in SD rats occurred in conjunction with bone 
marrow thrombosis. It is agreed that myelofibrosis observed in rats is not relevant for patients as 
these are clinically controlled to avoid the exaggerated pharmacological effect of roxadustat due 
excessive erythropoiesis. 
The applicant provided literature data [Haschek et al, 2010] to justify that occurrence of stomach ulcer 
is a well-known effect of response to stress. Thrombus was not recorded in the gastrointestinal tract in 
the 4-week study in SD rats, therefore the ulcer and erosion were considered as less likely to be 
related to thromboembolism in this study. As microscopic examination showed stress-related cortical 
atrophy in the thymus and since gastric ulcer or erosion occurred only in animals at moribund state at 
high dose, these effects do not raise further concern for patients.  
In the repeat dose studies (in SD Rats and F344 rats) mortality was related to severe exaggerated 
pharmacology effects related to erythropoiesis. In addition, other target organs were the heart, which 
was enlarged, and valvulopathy and valvular legions were observed in combination with 
thromboembolisms in multiple animals. Also, severe effects on the kidney were observed including 
kidney infarcts, multiple histological changes and leukocytes and blood in the urine. After one month of 
recovery, valvulopathy was observed at all dose groups. At higher doses which did not induce 
mortality, valvulopathy was observed in the absence of thrombosis. In addition, reticulocyte counts 
were decreased, spleen weight was increased, necrosis and inflammation of the cecum was observed. 
Also, at the doses inducing mortality, atrophy, scarring and pale kidney were observed, heart weight 
was increased in females and valvulopathy together with valvular thrombosis was observed.

The six-month repeat-dose toxicity study was performed twice in different rat strains the applicant 
justified repeating the study in a second strain to confirm that valvulopathy was not a strain-specific 
finding. The discussion provided by the applicant was considered sufficient. However, in this specific 
case it was commented that it would have been preferable if the applicant had applied for scientific 
advice at a regulatory authority to discuss the need to perform such a study before start of the study.  
In the rat, valvulopathy has been associated with excessive erythropoiesis in literature with other 
ESA’s. This effect was not observed in the cynomolgus monkey. The applicant argued that this is a rat 
specific effect due to increased shear stress on cardiac valves due to increased cell mass, increased 
blood viscosity and enhanced chance of thrombosis. The applicant discussed literature data (Elangbam 
et al, 2002) and historical data for the CRO of concern for the incidence of valvulopathy in long-term 
studies [Covance, 2020a; Covance, 2020b].   It is agreed that the incidence of valvulopathies observed 
in the low-dose group of SD rats fall within both the historical and literature incidence range and, as 
such could be a background finding. Based on Covance data, SD rats suffer for significantly higher 
incidence of age-related spontaneous valvulopathy than F344 rats. Minimal valvulopahy observed in 
one male at low dose necropsied on D210 (study 301_06_3510_088) thus does not raise a further 
concern.  It is however of note that dose-related (mid and high dose) chronic inflammation of heart 
valves was also observed in a repeat-dose one-month study (301_05_3510_019) next to the 
spontaneous incidence for SD rats clearly demonstrating drug-related effects. 
Across  all  studies,  decreased  cholesterol  and  glucose  levels  were  observed.  The  mechanism  behind 
roxadustat  related  decreases  in  cholesterol  and  glucose  have  been  discussed  in  the  non-clinical 
pharmacodynamics section. 
In conclusion, in rat, next to the expected pharmacological adverse effects related to erythropoiesis, 
the main target organs of roxadustat in the repeat-dose toxicity studies are the heart and kidney. 
Effects in these organs were only in part reversible and observed at dose levels not inducing mortality 
and at an exposure level slightly higher than exposure at MRHD.  
It is acknowledged that clinically excessive erythropoiesis can be managed by controlling rate of Hb 
rise and by setting maximum target Hb levels. However, in case of inadvertent higher Hb levels, in 
between the Hb control measurements, safety issues observed in the rat may be relevant for human. 
In addition, due to the relatively low exposure margin at which these adverse effects are observed in 
rat, and the long-term treatment with roxadustat in the clinic, the adverse findings in rat heart 
(including valvulopathy and thrombi), brain (hippocampal necrosis) and kidney (ischaemia, infarction), 
and infarctions in general can theoretically be considered a cause of concern for the clinical situation. 
Therefore, the applicant was requested to discuss the following findings in more detail in SmPC section 
5.3: Findings of 1) the valvulopathy in rat, 2) findings of necrosis in the hippocampus in rat, and 3) the 
ischaemic effects in kidney and heart in rat 4) general increased risk of infractions in rat. 
For the pivotal carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicology animal studies, AUC0-24h was measured. 
For human AUC0-48h is provided. The human profile shows a high exposure during the first 24 hours 
and a much less exposure during the next 48 hours. However, in animals, the intended 
pharmacodynamic effect and related toxicity was shown to be delayed by up to 3 days, and therefore 
not directly related or comparable to the exposure to roxadustat. Further, the difference in AUC 
calculation between animals and humans has little numerical effect. In addition, as after three days 
roxadustat would have been completely cleared, specific toxicity effects are not considered to be 
induced by direct presence of the roxadustat. Therefore, the effects observed are considered to be 
induced by upstream regulation induced by roxadustat. Furthermore, the applicant states that high 
doses were selected based on MTD. As more frequent administration of roxadustat would not have 
been feasible for such a long study, it is acceptable that under the circumstances this was an optimal 
dosing strategy.

Regarding the mammary tumours in mouse and rat, there is not a dose-response in either species, 
although there are increased exposures overdose. Also findings in a xenograft mouse model for human 
breast cancer showed increased VEGF levels systemically, but no increase in VEGF expression, a 
marker for increased angiogenesis, in the xenografted breast cancer tumour tissue. The mammary 
tumours seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies are likely not roxadustat induced and from 
the xenograft model it can be concluded that roxadustat did not have a pro-survival effect on breast 
cancer tumour and did not induce tumour growth. The applicant provided additional historical incidence 
data. Although the incidence for the 15 mg/kg per day dose group was outside the historical incidence 
range of this tumour in CD-1 male mice at the testing facility (0 - 16.7%), all groups were within the 
incidence reported for CD-1 male mice at other facilities (1.4% - 20.0%). It is agreed that 
bronchioloalveolar adenoma or carcinoma in the lung in mice are considered not to be roxadustat-
induced and there is no risk to humans. Haemorrhage and inflammation in the lung in the 4- and 26-
week SD rat studies is likely drug-related due to the dose-proportionality, but these were considered to 
be secondary effects of thrombus in the heart. 
In addition, in a scientific advice, CHMP raised a concern that the HIF pathway has been implicated in 
renal tumour biology, especially renal cell carcinoma. The applicant was asked to carefully examine 
signs of renal cancer during the long-term and carcinogenicity study. In mice, no renal tumours were 
observed. In rat, one case of renal tubular cell adenoma (mid-dose) and one animal with multiple renal 
carcinomas (high dose) were observed. The renal adenoma finding was within historical control range 
of the facility; however, the incidence of renal carcinoma was outside of the test facility and CRO’s 
combined test facility historical control range. However, as there was only one animal with renal 
carcinoma’s, there is not enough evidence to relate the finding to treatment with roxadustat. 
Furthermore, in a 786-O human renal tumour xenograft 26-day nu/nu Mouse model study showed no 
significant roxadustat induced effects on tumour growth, tumour tissue vascular density or circulating 
VEGF protein. 
In the FEED Study 352012001 in rats, enlarged spleens were observed which correlated with 
significantly higher spleen weights at 30 mg/kg on day 13 of gestation. These findings can be 
considered as reflections of the intended pharmacological activity. In another study after a 4-week 
recovery period with enhanced extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen, hematological parameters 
were not fully recovered showing prolonged pharmacodynamic effects of roxadustat. It is agreed that 
based on (healthy) animal data there is no direct effect of roxadustat on foetal lethality. 
As increased mortality was specifically observed with roxadustat exposure during the lactation period 
at relatively low maternal plasma exposure levels, a contraindication breastfeeding based on animal 
data as proposed by the applicant is agreed. 
The  applicant  also  provided  literature  data  to  clarify  that  possible  cause  of  the  early  achievement  of 
criterion for eye opening and incisor eruption observed in the PPND study could be due to the downstream 
effects of roxadustat's action on the HIF pathway via exposure of the pup to breast milk. EGF is one of 
the genes thought to be controlled by hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) [Rabinowitz, 2013], suggesting that 
HIF accumulation resulting from HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibition by roxadustat leads to an increase in 
EGF.  
In the non-clinical overview, the applicant discussed the effects of low maternal plasma cholesterol 
levels on the fetus. LDL cholesterol plasma changes in patients treated with roxadustat were lowered 
with approximately 0.5 mmol/L. Reference plasma levels of LDL cholesterol are less than 2.59 mmol/L 
in non-pregnant women, between 1.55-3.96 during the first trimester, between 1.99-4.77 in the 
second trimester and 2.62-5.8 during the third trimester1. However, this may not exactly apply to the 
current diseased CKD population in whom higher LDL-cholesterol levels may be expected in a 
1 (http://perinatology.com/Reference/Reference%20Ranges/Cholesterol,LDL.htm, accessed 2020 July 09).

considerable proportion of the patients. Based on the limited decrease of LDL cholesterol by roxadustat 
and the expected increased LDL cholesterol in patients indicated for roxadustat therapy it is not 
considered likely that roxadustat induced decreases in LDL-cholesterol will have an adverse effect on 
pregnancy. 
Regarding the ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment, roxadustat is not persistent, bioaccumulative 
and toxic (PBT), nor vPvB. Based on the prescribed use and considering the available data, roxadustat 
is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

has been included in the SmPC (sections 4.6, 5.1 and 5.3).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Various characteristics of roxadustat were investigated in healthy subjects, such as mass balance, dose 
proportionality, accumulation, age/sex, formulation comparisons, QT prolongation and DDIs, and in 
subjects with renal or hepatic impairment. A total of 28 phase 1 clinical studies (27 clinical 
pharmacology studies [Table 6] and 1 additional bioavailability study in China [not listed]) were 
performed and provide a characterisation of the clinical pharmacology of roxadustat. Additionally, a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis of roxadustat in NDD and DD patients (phase 3) supports the 
pharmacokinetic characterisation of roxadustat. 
Several bioanalytical assays have been used throughout the development programme. The 
bioanalytical methods for the quantification of roxadustat have been validated and results were 
extensively presented (results not shown in this report). Noncompartmental analysis was used to 
estimate pharmacokinetic parameters in the phase 1 studies. Analyses were conducted using actual 
sampling times. The primary pharmacokinetic parameters were AUCinf and Cmax. 
Absorption  
Roxadustat is a relatively high permeability compound with low solubility. Maximum plasma 
concentrations are observed at 2h post administration. The absorption of roxadustat from the 
gastrointestinal tract is at least 60%. 
Bioequivalence was concluded between the to-be-marketed and phase 3 tablets. Additionally, a 
justification was given for waiving additional in vivo bioequivalence studies for the lower strengths 
between the to-be-marketed and phase 3 tablets. It has sufficiently been supported that differences 
between the formulations used in the clinical studies do not hamper conclusions drawn from these 
studies and use of the to-be-marketed is accepted. 
The influence of food on the bioavailability of roxadustat was studied it can be estimated that the AUC 
is reduced by 6-11% under the influence of food. The Cmax is estimated to be reduced by 20-35% 
under the influence of food. The influence of food has not been investigated with the to-be-marketed 
tablets, which differ from the phase 3 tablets.  
Distribution 
Distribution of roxadustat has been characterised in several in vivo and in vitro investigations. The 
compound is highly bound to human plasma proteins (~99%), predominantly to albumin and 
Assessment Report

Page 43/153  
 
 
 
 
 
independent of the concentration. Distribution into RBCs is low. The estimated apparent volume of 
distribution, at steady state, is approximately 24 L in patients with CKD. 
Metabolism  
The metabolism of roxadustat has been characterised in several in vivo and in vitro investigations. 
Unchanged roxadustat is the predominant circulating compound in plasma. Based on urinary and faecal 
samples, the majority of roxadustat metabolism occurred through hydroxylation/oxidation followed by 
sulfation (MET4 and MET3, together 20% of the dose) and o-glucuronidation (MET1, 28% of the dose). 
CYP2C8 appears to be the major CYP enzyme responsible for the conversion of roxadustat to MET4. 
UGT1A9 appears to be the major contributor in the glucuronidation to MET1 in human liver. UGT1A7 
and UGT1A8 may be involved in the extrahepatic formation of MET1. Minor metabolic routes included 
glucosidation (MET2, 8.1% of the dose), acyl glucuronidation (MET5, 0.6% of the dose), and 
demethylation (MET7 and MET6, together ~3.6% of the dose). No metabolite detected in human 
plasma constituted more than 10% of total drug-related material exposure and no human specific 
metabolites were observed. 
Pharmacokinetic characteristics of the main metabolites have adequately been characterised. None of 
the metabolites are present at plasma concentrations higher than 10% of the total roxadustat dose, in 
healthy subjects, or patients. It is therefore agreed with the applicant that further evaluation of the 
metabolites is not a requirement. MET1 was the predominant component in urine and the main urinary 
metabolite, consisting of 28% of the radiolabeled dose. In plasma, MET1 is circulating at very low 
concentrations, between 0.2 and 0.7% of the parent. UGT1A9 is a major contributor in the 
glucuronidation of roxadustat to its O-glucuronide in human liver, with possible contributions of 
UGT1A7 and UGT1A8. MET3 is the primary metabolite in plasma and a sulfate conjugate of MET4. 
MET4 itself has no systemic exposure but was the main metabolite in faeces of healthy subjects 
accounting for 17% of the radiolabeled dose. Hydroxylation of roxadustat is mediated primarily by 
CYP2C8, although metabolism by CYP1A1 was also detected. Glucosidation to MET2 is a minor route of 
elimination for roxadustat, plasma concentrations were 0.1% to 0.4% of the parent. A total of 8.1% of 
a radiolabeled dose was recovered in urine as MET2. 
Elimination 
Approximately 50% of a total oral radiolabeled dose in healthy subjects is excreted in faeces, of which 
28% represented unchanged roxadustat. Approximately 46% of the total oral radiolabeled dose in 
healthy subjects is excreted in the urine, primarily as metabolites. Less than 2% of the dose was 
recovered in urine as unchanged roxadustat. Urinary excretion of unchanged roxadustat plays a minor 
role in the overall excretion. 
Polymorphism 
Roxadustat is a substrate for the polymorphic enzymes (CYP2C8 and UGT1A9), which are estimated to 
be responsible for 20% and 28%, respectively, of the clearance of roxadustat in healthy subjects. It is 
expected that polymorphisms of CYP2C8 and UGT1A9 will only influence clearance of roxadustat to a 
minor extent. Further, the impact of genetic variance on roxadustat pharmacokinetics is fully mitigated 
by the titration of the dosing regimen, which is based on the patient’s haemoglobin response. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Using a power model approach, the predicted increase in AUCinf was 2.08-fold with a predicted increase 
in Cmax of 1.95-fold for every 2-fold increase in dose within the range of 50 to 200 mg. The

pharmacokinetics of roxadustat behave in a dose proportional manner, over the dose range of 50 to 
200 mg. 
Roxadustat pharmacokinetics do not change over time. Results from studies 1517-CL-0201, FGCL-
SM4592-016 and 1517-CL-0541 demonstrate an accumulation ratio of roxadustat between 1.06 and 
1.14, and other pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable after single and multiple doses of 200 
mg roxadustat.

Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-subject variability for roxadustat Cmax and AUCinf was estimated to be approximately 20% to 40% 
in phase 1 studies and is, based on the phase 3 patient population, estimated to be 69.5% for AUC. 
Intra-subject variability was estimated to be 17.2% for Cmax and 9.9% for AUC. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Renal disease and on haemodialysis are the two main determinants of the patient population. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis based on sampling during the phase 3 studies support conclusions 
drawn in the renal impairment studies. Roxadustat AUC is approximately 2.2-fold higher in patients 
with severe renal impairment and 1.9-fold higher in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) on 
dialysis than in healthy subjects, but Cmax is comparable. Haemodialysis did not have a significant 
effect on roxadustat pharmacokinetic parameters, in line with the high plasma protein binding.

Special populations 
For the characterisation of roxadustat pharmacokinetic characteristics in special populations, several 
studies have been performed. Dedicated studies were performed to investigate the effect of renal 
impairment (study 1517-CL-0543), hepatic impairment (study 1517-CL-0513), and the effect of 
gender and age (study 1517-CL-0525). 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to aid in the characterisation of these factors, as 
well as race and body weight. The conclusions drawn regarding the effects of race and body weight on 
the pharmacokinetics of roxadustat were solely based on the population pharmacokinetics analysis. 
Urinary excretion and renal clearance of roxadustat and metabolites was decreased in subjects with 
severe renal impairment or ESRD on dialysis. Roxadustat AUC is approximately 2.2-fold higher in 
patients with severe renal impairment and 1.9-fold higher in patients with end stage renal disease 
(ESRD) on dialysis than in healthy subjects, but Cmax is comparable. 
For subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) and normal renal function, 
roxadustat AUC was increased by 23% and Cmax decreased by 16% and unbound roxadustat AUCinf was 
increased by app. 70% relative to healthy subjects. Starting dose is to be reduced by half when 
initiating treatment in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). No data were 
presented for patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class C). 
In the investigation into the influence of gender on the pharmacokinetics of roxadustat, weight-
normalised AUCinf and Cmax were only increased to a minor extent (9% and 2% respectively) for the 
female, compared to the male subjects. These increases are not clinically relevant 
Body weight has been investigated in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, in which it was 
identified as a statistically significant covariate on CL/F, with 13-18 % changes of AUC and Cmax when 
comparing 50 kg individuals to 70 kg patients, and 70 kg to 100 kg patients. Clinically relevant body 
weight subgroups between 46-118 kg were included in the simulations and this demonstrated that the 
expected effect on the roxadustat exposure is limited. 
Increases of the AUC were estimated for Asian, Black, American Indian/Alaskan native and ‘other’ 
included patients, in the range of 12-26%. A clear cause for these differences has not been identified 
but is more likely to be found in genetic polymorphisms and/or pharmacokinetic variability.  
In study 1517-CL-0525, elderly subjects (65-80 years) exhibited approximately 23% higher AUCinf and 
15% higher Cmax of roxadustat than the younger subjects (21-44 years). Phase 3 studies were largely 
conducted with sufficient inclusion of elderly patients. It can therefore be accepted that a small 
difference of pharmacokinetics between the younger and older groups exist.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Roxadustat is a substrate of BCRP, OATP1B1, OAT1 and OAT3, but not of P-gp, MRP2, OATP1B3, OCT1, 
OCT2, BSEP, and MATE1. 
Based on in vitro studies, roxadustat may be a clinically relevant inhibitor of CYP2C8 (Ki = 16 µM) at 
maximal systemic concentrations. Roxadustat is not an inhibitor of other CYPs at maximal systemic 
concentrations and not of CYP3A4 at maximal intestinal concentrations. Roxadustat is an inhibitor of 
UGT1A1 (IC50/2 = 29 µM) at maximal intestinal concentrations. However, roxadustat is not an inhibitor 
of UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9 and 2B7 at maximal systemic concentrations. Transporters were also 
identified to be inhibited by roxadustat; BCRP at relevant intestinal and systemic concentrations, 
OATP1B1 at relevant portal vein concentrations, and OATP1B1, OAT1, and OAT3 at relevant systemic 
concentrations. 
In vivo studies were performed for the potential for roxadustat as a victim for phosphate binders, 
adsorptive charcoal and omeprazole and with gemfibrozil (CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 inhibitor) and 
probenecid (UGT and OAT inhibitor). Studies for roxadustat as perpetrator have been performed for 
roxadustat’s potential to inhibit CYP enzymes (CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9) or transporters (BCRP 
and OATP1B1). 
Roxadustat as victim 
Absorption-based interactions were investigated. Concomitant administration of roxadustat and 
sevelamer carbonate or calcium acetate results in a lower roxadustat plasma exposure, by 
approximately 67% and 46% (AUC) and 66% and 52% (Cmax). The interaction is presumably a result 
of formation of insoluble chelation complexes in the gastrointestinal tract that inhibit roxadustat 
absorption. The reduction of roxadustat plasma exposure by concomitant administration of sevelamer 
carbonate or calcium acetate should be extrapolated to multivalent cation-containing drugs or 
products. Other absorption-based interactions are not expected, as no interaction was observed upon 
administration of roxadustat with proton pump inhibitor omeprazole, or an oral adsorptive charcoal. 
Co-administration with gemfibrozil (CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 inhibitor) or probenecid (UGT and OAT 
inhibitor) in healthy subjects resulted in an increase in roxadustat exposure. With gemfibrozil by 
approximately 2.3-fold (AUC) and 1.4-fold (Cmax), and with probenecid also by 2.3-fold (AUC) and 1.4-
fold (Cmax). A clinically relevant interaction with clopidogrel is not expected, based on the lower 
interaction potential of clopidogrel compared to gemfibrozil, clopidogrel was not identified as a 
significant factor on roxadustat pharmacokinetics in patients with chronic kidney disease by the 
population modeling analyses and the overall decreased metabolic and transporter function in the CKD 
population. 
Roxadustat as perpetrator 
In vivo DDI studies were performed with simvastatin, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, as these are 
probe substrates for BCRP and OATP1B1 transporters. Clinically relevant increases in plasma exposure 
of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin with simultaneous administration of 
roxadustat were identified. Simvastatin acid (OATP1B1 substrate) increased by 1.8 (AUC) and 1.9-fold 
(Cmax), rosuvastatin (BCRP and OATP1B1 substrate) by 2.9 (AUC) and 4.5-fold (Cmax), and 
atorvastatin (OATP1B1 substrate) increased by 2.0 (AUC) and 1.3-fold (Cmax). Time-separated 
administration of simvastatin and roxadustat did not reduce the interaction observed with 
simultaneous administration. 
Furthermore, in vivo DDI studies were performed with substrates for CYP2B6 (bupropion), CYP2C8 
(rosiglitazone) or CYP2C9 (S-warfarin) and confirmed that roxadustat does not affect the 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 49/153  
 
 
 
pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of these CYP enzymes. However, 
rosiglitazone is categorised as a moderate sensitive substrate for CYP2C8 by the FDA and not a 
sensitive substrate. A qualified PBPK model (SIMCYP® version 20) was used to confirm that roxadustat 
is not an inhibitor of CYP2C8. Roxadustat has no inhibitory effects on sensitive CYP2C8 substrate 
repaglinide following dosing with 300 mg roxadustat every other day (maximal clinical dose in patients 
that are not on dialysis). Therefore, it can be concluded that roxadustat is unlikely to be a clinically 
relevant inhibitor of CYP2C8 at roxadustat doses of up to 300 mg. 
Clopidogrel is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2C8 and OATP1B1 via its glucuronide metabolite, like 
gemfibrozil. A specific study to assess a possible interaction of roxadustat with clopidogrel has not 
been conducted, but some clinical data on the combination of roxadustat with clopidogrel were 
available. Out of the 2855 patients with CKD included in the population pharmacokinetic analysis, 189 
had roxadustat pharmacokinetic samples collected while on concomitant clopidogrel. In the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, it was concluded that concomitant administration of clopidogrel did not 
change roxadustat AUC and Cmax statistically significant. 
No clinical DDI study was conducted with roxadustat as intestinal UGT1A1 inhibitor 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved 
in erythropoiesis. Activation of the HIF pathway is important in the adaptative response to hypoxia to 
increase red blood cell production. 
Roxadustat mimics the body’s natural response to hypoxia by reversibly inhibiting HIF-prolyl 
hydroxylases (PH) enzymes that target HIFs for degradation under normal oxygen conditions. 
Through the inhibition of HIF-PH, roxadustat stimulates a coordinated erythropoietic response that 
includes the increase of endogenous plasma erythropoietin (EPO) levels, regulation of iron transporter 
proteins and reduction of hepcidin. This results in improved iron bioavailability increased haemoglobin 
production and increased red cell mass. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Several studies (10 phase I studies, 8 phase 2 studies, 13 phase 3 studies (6 global, one US, 2 China, 
4 Japan) have evaluated several pharmacodynamics parameters including EPO, Reticulocytes, CHr, 
Hepcidin, Serum Iron, TSAT, sTfR, and VEGF in healthy subjects and in patients with CKD. 
Erythropoietin 
Plasma EPO pharmacodynamic data after single and intermittent administration of roxadustat (once, 
twice or 3 times a week) were obtained across the phase 1 programme and in 5 phase 2 studies. 
Single and repeated intermittent administration of roxadustat resulted in transient increases in EPO, 
which returned to baseline at approximately 48 h post-dose. Mean maximum EPO levels increased 
more than proportionally with dose and were generally achieved approximately 8 to 12 h post-dose. 
There was no evidence of a substantial change in EPO profiles with repeated intermittent dosing 
compared with single doses (FGCL-4592-044). This is consistent with the absence of time-dependent 
pharmacokinetics, and the transient duration of the effect of roxadustat on EPO. 
Baseline-corrected maximum EPO values were higher (by < 15%) under fed conditions, but the 
difference was not statistically significant.

In DD patients (1517-CL-0543), baseline-corrected maximum EPO values were higher than in healthy 
subjects (see table and figure below).

Effect of Intrinsic Factors on Erythropoietin concentration 
Age and Sex: In healthy subjects receiving single dose of 200 mg, mean baseline- and placebo-corrected 
EPO  concentrations  were higher  in  elderly  than in  young  subjects,  and  higher  in  women  than  in  men 
(1517-CL-0525) (figure below).

Erythropoietin by Age Cohort and Sex (Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set - Study 1517-CL-0525)). Dose 
200 mg FG-4592 
Ethnicity: No marked differences in EPO response were observed between Chinese, Japanese, and 
Caucasian healthy subjects. 
Hepatic Impairment: In subjects with moderate HI, the baseline-corrected EPO AUC and maximum 
EPO levels were respectively 31% and 48% lower than in healthy control subjects (1517-CL-0513). 
The mean (s.d.) maximum EPO baseline-corrected concentrations were 141 (66) mU/mL in healthy 
control subjects with normal hepatic function and 103 (101) mU/mL in subjects with moderate hepatic 
impairment. 
Before or after dialysis session: Administration of 100 mg roxadustat before dialysis (2 hours prior to 
the start of HD on day 1 of treatment period 2) resulted in higher mean (SD) (IU/mL) EPO levels (409 
(225), n =8) than administration after dialysis (260 (200), n = 8) (2 hours after completion of HD on 
day 1 of treatment period 1) (1517-CL-0543).

Reticulocyte Hb Content 
In patients with NDD and in patients with DD, the mean (SD) baseline CHr was approximately 31.0 
(2.0) pg in each treatment arm. 
In patients with NDD, mean CHr (haemoglobin content in reticulocytes) initially decreased up to week 
6 in the roxadustat arm and then gradually increased up to week 52, while CHr remained 
approximately constant in the placebo arm (FGCL-4592-060). CHr values by the end of the study were 
similar between treatment arms. For roxadustat and placebo respectively, the mean (SD) changes (pg) 
from baseline were -0.51 (1.65) [n=550] and -0.01 (1.00) [n=274] at week 8; 0.35 (1.68) [n=504] 
and 0.17 (1.43) [n=214] at week 28; and 0.51 (1.76) [n=451] and 0.24 (1.60) [n=164] at week 52. 
In patients with DD, after an initial decrease up to weeks 6 to 8, CHr increased from baseline in 
roxadustat and epoetin alfa treatment arms through week 52 (FGCL-4592-063). For roxadustat and 
epoetin alfa respectively, the mean (SD) changes (pg) from baseline were -0.41 (1.73) [n=474] and 
−0.33 (1.52) [n=466] at week 8; 0.46 (1.87) [n=415] and 0.12 (1.86) [n=417] at week 28; and 0.76 
(2.04) [n=340] and 0.53 (2.01) [n=345] at week 52. 
Hepcidin 
The effect of roxadustat on hepcidin was studied in 6 phase 1 studies and the phase 2 and phase 3 
studies in patients with CKD. In healthy subjects, there was an initial increase in hepcidin from 
baseline in all dose groups including placebo, followed by a decrease in subjects receiving roxadustat: 
The mean baseline-corrected Emin (i.e. decrease in hepcidin concentration relative to baseline) was -2.9 
(3.3) -3.1 (2.9) -4.0 (4.1) and -5.8 (4.5) ng/mL for placebo, 50, 100 and 200 mg doses; the 
decreases were small and variable but appeared to be dose-dependent (1517-CL-0525). 
Serum Iron Markers 
In the main phase 3 studies, effects on iron utilisation were assessed with the following indices of iron 
status: serum iron, ferritin, TSAT and soluble transferrin receptor. The data from these studies were 
obtained with a proportion of patients using concomitant iron products. See efficacy part for the 
results. 
Secondary Pharmacology 
HR and Blood Pressure 
Roxadustat treatment produces a dose-dependent increase in HR in healthy subjects at doses 
> 2 mg/kg [1517-CL-0201, 1517-CL-0525, FGCL-4592-065]. The TQT study, FGCL-4592-065, 
demonstrated a placebo-corrected HR increase up to 9 to 10 bpm at 8 to 12 h post-dose for a 
therapeutic dose of 2.75 mg/kg and 15 to 18 bpm at 6 to 12 h post-dose for a supratherapeutic dose 
of 5.0 mg/kg. No adverse events were related to the increase in HR developed in the combined phase 
3 studies. An effect of roxadustat on blood pressure in humans has not been observed [1517-CL-0201, 
1517-CL-0525]. 
QT interval prolongation 
Based on data from a TQT study, concentration-effect modelling showed no significant relationship 
between plasma levels of roxadustat and ∆∆QTcI (QTcI = QT interval corrected for heart rate using an 
individual correction) with an intercept of -2.37 ms and slope of 0.3481 x 10-4 ms per ng/mL (90% CI: 
-0.2254, 0.9215; p = NS). The predicted effect on ∆∆QTcI at the geometric mean peak plasma 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021

concentrations was -1.84 ms (90% CI: -3.11, -0.58) and -1.37 ms (-2.80, 0.06) after dosing 
roxadustat at 2.75 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively. 
VEGF 
VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) expression is directly induced by HIF-1a. VEGF is a signaling 
molecule that stimulates vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in response to decreases in oxygen levels 
and as such is one element of a response to restore the oxygen supply to tissues in hypoxic conditions. 
VEGF was evaluated as an exploratory marker in 3 Phase 1 placebo-controlled, healthy subject studies 
(FGCL-SM4592-016, 1517-CL-0201, 1517-CL-0525) and a Phase 1 study in DD patients 
(1517-CL-0203). Single and repeated intermittent administration of roxadustat doses of 100 and 
200 mg and 3.0, 3.75, and 4.0 mg/kg resulted in transient increases in VEGF, with high inter-subject 
variability. At lower doses, VEGF concentrations were similar to those in placebo subjects or to pre-
dose levels. Mean VEGF concentrations peaked at approximately 8 to 12 h post-dose and generally 
returned to pre-dose values by 48 h post-dose. Change from baseline (pg/mL) was 62.8 (47.5) (n=17) 
for the 2 mg/kg dose, 58.1 (32.7) (n=10) and 40.2 (23.9) (n=6) for the 3 mg/kg dose, 112.6 (164.9) 
(n=5) and 180.3 (103.6) (n=6) for the 4 mg/kg dose, 15.0 (10.1) (n=48), 28.6 (34.20) (n=48) and 
40.8 (27.5) (n=49) for the 50, 100 and 200 mg doses. In DD patients (n=6) it was 142.3 (74.7) for 
the 3 mg/kg dose.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Overall, pharmacokinetic characteristics of roxadustat have adequately been characterised. The 
fragmented development of this product is evidenced by different clinical study locations, different 
CROs, methodologies and use of multiple drug product formulations. However, this did not hamper 
assessment of the pharmacokinetics and the totality of evidence is sufficient. 
It is accepted that the influence of food on the bioavailability of roxadustat for the to-be-marketed will 
not be different from the estimated effect on the 3 studied formulations. Therefore, proposed labelling 
(roxadustat can be taken with or without food, as was the method of administration during the phase 3 
studies) is supported. 
Regarding the pharmacokinetic characteristics of roxadustat in special populations, the applicant 
concluded that no dose adjustments are required for the administration of roxadustat. Roxadustat is 
not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class C) due to the 
absence of data in this population. 
PK differences in gender and race were not considered clinically relevant taking also into account that 
roxadustat is dosed based on titration based on the patient’s haemoglobin response. 
Safety and efficacy of roxadustat in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been 
established, which is in line with the pediatric investigation plan.

No clinical DDI study was conducted with roxadustat as intestinal UGT1A1 inhibitor. It can currently 
not be excluded that roxadustat is a clinically relevant inhibitor of intestinal UGT1A1 and could affect 
the bioavailability of UGT1A1 substrates (increased exposure). A warning in section 5.2 of the SmPC 
has been included regarding UGT1A1 inhibition potential in absence of clear recommendations for the 
prescriber. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Erythropoietin 
EPO is a key driver of erythropoiesis that facilitates the survival of red blood cell (RBC) progenitors and 
precursors in the bone marrow, allowing their differentiation into RBCs. EPO promotes precursor cell 
survival by inhibiting apoptosis. EPO is considered one of the main factors causing the rise in Hb 
concentration. 
Phase 1 studies demonstrate that the plasma EPO concentration increases with increasing dose of 
roxadustat. With doses of 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg, the mean maximum baseline-corrected EPO 
levels in plasma increased more than proportionally with dose. This can be seen in e.g. a 4-fold higher 
EPO level (mIU/ml, mean (s.d.) reached with 100 mg (92.5 (76.8)) compared to 50 mg (25.3 (16.8)) 
in healthy volunteers and a 24 fold higher level reached with 200 mg (599 (634)) compared to 50 mg. 
It should also be noted that at high roxadustat doses, there is large inter-individual variability in the 
EPO levels. Further, based on one study with a 100 mg dose, it was observed that mean (SD) 
maximum baseline-corrected EPO concentration (mIU/mL) was higher in patients with severe renal 
impairment, non-dialysis dependent (316 (307) or dialysis-dependent (253 (201)), compared to 
healthy volunteers (161 (128)). Comparable results were obtained in 5 phase 2 studies with various 
doses ranging from 0.7 mg/kg up to 2.0 mg/kg and 50 mg up to 200 mg. These studies showed a wide 
range of individual responses in plasma EPO level and EPO levels increasing more than proportionally 
with dose.  
It is noticed that the baseline-corrected EPO concentration after a roxadustat dose of 200 mg is higher 
in elderly patients and in females than younger patients and male, respectively. Further possible 
implications of these findings on Hb effects per subgroup are discussed in the efficacy section. 
Hepcidin 
Hepcidin is a hormone responsible for the regulation of iron mobilisation. There are non-clinical data 
demonstrating effects on hepcidin and iron parameters. For clinical evaluation, three phase 1 studies in 
healthy volunteers and 2 phase 1 studies in CKD patients could overall not clearly reveal a substantial 
effect of a decrease in hepcidin levels with the absence of a clear difference versus placebo or only a 
small and high variable effect. Hepcidin measurements in the Phase 3 studies showed a significant 
decrease in hepcidin at 24 weeks in non-dialysis patients treated with roxadustat compared to placebo 
and in dialysis patients in comparison to ESA therapy (see also efficacy section).  
Serum Iron Markers 
Transferrin(s) are blood plasma/serum glycoproteins that reversibly bind iron and therefore control the 
levels of circulating free iron and facilitate iron transport. Transferrin saturation (TSAT) is a measure of 
the percentage of transferrin that is bound to iron, namely serum iron divided by the total iron binding 
capacity. Overall, the results of these parameters should be interpreted in the context of concomitant 
iron treatment during these studies, which may complicate interpretation of the exact PD effect of 
roxadustat on these parameters. Nevertheless, the initial decrease in serum ferritin and TSAT as 
observed in the NDD and DD patients may reflect the increased use of iron if increased erythropoiesis 
is occurring after starting treatment with roxadustat with subsequent increase and stabilisation during 
further treatment. These data are further discussed in the efficacy section of this report. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 55/153  
 
 
 
The observed changes in reticulocyte Hb content (CHr) could be interpreted as mirroring these changes 
in serum ferritin and TSAT and may reflect iron utilisation in RBC production. In patients with NDD, 
mean CHr initially decreased up to week 6 in the roxadustat arm and then gradually increased up to 
week 52, while CHr remained approximately constant in the placebo arm (FGCL-4592-060). CHr values 
by the end of the study were similar between treatment arms. Although, CHr increased from baseline 
in roxadustat and epoetin alfa treatment arms through week 52 in patients with DD (FGCL-4592-063). 
QT prolongation 
In a thorough QT Study with doses of 2.75 mg/kg [120-280 mg] and 5 mg/kg [230-510 mg] no dose 
dependent placebo corrected effect on QT prolongation could be observed. 
VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
In 3 Phase 1 placebo-controlled healthy subject studies and one Phase 1 study in dialysis patients, 100 
and 200 mg and 3.0, 3.75, and 4.0 mg/kg resulted in transient increases in VEGF, with high inter-
subject variability, while this was not observed with the lower doses. This is potentially of concern 
considering that VEGF is a signaling molecule that stimulates vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and can 
theoretically promote several mechanism including a tumour-promoting effect and a retino-
proliferative effect. However, safety data on imbalance in tumour associated effects did not 
demonstrate any imbalance (see safety section). Further, particular studies 1517-CL-0304 and 1517-
CL-0307 examining ophthalmological effects did not show any clinically relevant mean changes from 
baseline in the total number of retinal haemorrhages or in the proportion of patients with evidence of 
retinal haemorrhages, hard exudates and cotton wool spots. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of roxadustat have adequately been 
characterised throughout this dossier. The relevant information has been included in the SmPC 
sections 4.2 and 5.2. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
At the time of MAA submission, the phase 2 and phase 3 clinical development programme for 
roxadustat for the treatment of anaemia in CKD patients consisted of 22 completed studies, 2 ongoing 
studies (Studies 1517-CL-0610 and 1517-CL-0310) and 1 ongoing extension study (Study FGCL-4592-
059). Studies 1517-CL-0610 and 1517-CL-0310 completed during the review period. Results for 1517-
CL-0610 within this assessment are based on the 36-week early timepoint analysis results available at 
the time of dossier submission, unless otherwise noted. Studies are summarised below:

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The following phase 2 studies were used to investigate dose response and conclude on starting dose 
for phase 3 studies: Study No. FGCL-SM4592-016, Study No. FGCL-SM4592-017, Study No. FGCL-
4592-041 Study No. FGCL-4592-040 Study No. FGCL-4592-053 Study No. FGCL-4592-047 Study No.

Roxadustat dosing is governed by haemoglobin (Hb) response. The aim of starting dose selection and 
dose adjustment rules for treatment with roxadustat is to achieve and maintain Hb within 10 to 
12 g/dL. As Hb response is variable and a single dose level cannot achieve the target Hb range for all 
patients, individualised dose adjustment is required following initiation of treatment with a defined 
starting dose setting. The details are summarised below.

Starting doses 
Different starting doses of roxadustat were studied in the phase 2 programme: using a tiered weight-
based approach where a patient’s starting dose was selected based on categorizing the patient’s body 
weight as low or high, and using an absolute starting dose regardless of body weight. These 
approaches were also adopted in the main phase 3 studies based on the efficacy and safety results 
from the phase 2 studies. 
Patients previously untreated with ESA 
A tiered weight-based approach for starting doses of roxadustat (70 or 100 mg 3 times weekly with 70 
kg as a cut-off point) was chosen in all except one of the studies in patients previously untreated with 
ESA. This approach was thought to provide the best opportunity for managing the controlled 
individualised correction to target Hb values by achieving a steady Hb increase associated with 
moderate rates of Hb overshoots. 
Absolute dosing was used for ESA-untreated patients in Study D5740C00001, and all patients started 
at a dose of 70 mg 3 times weekly in an attempt to simplify the setting of the starting dose. 
Patients previously treated with ESA 
Starting doses for the patients previously treated with ESA were chosen based on the patient’s average 
prescribed weekly ESA dose within 4 weeks prior to randomisation. Based on dose data and Hb data 
from earlier studies in DD patients, a simplified dosing guide for conversion from 3 or 4 different dose 
ranges of ESA at baseline for Hb maintenance was developed. 
Maximum dose 
The maximum allowed dose for the patients not on dialysis was 3.0 mg/kg or 300 mg per 
administration, whichever was lower, a maximum weekly dose of 300 mg 3 times weekly (maximum of 
900 mg per week). For patients on dialysis, the maximum dose step (level) was 3.0 mg/kg or 400 mg 
per administration, whichever was lower. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
Eight of the studies presented above are submitted as the main clinical phase 3 studies in support of this 
application.  Four  of  them  were  conducted  on  non-dialysis  dependent  (NDD)  patients  and  four  were 
conducted on dialysis dependent (DD) patients. The summary of the studies is presented in the tables

Randomisation Stratification Factors 
Most patients were stratified by region due to known variations in clinical practice between regions 
except for Studies D5740C00001 (NDD) and D5740C00002 (DD), in which patients were stratified by 
country only. Most studies were stratified by screening Hb value: ≤ 8 g/dL vs > 8 g/dL (Hb correction 
Studies NDD 1517-CL-0608, FGCL-4592-060, 1517-CL-0610 and DD FGCL-4592-063), ≤ 10.5 g/dL vs 
> 10.5 g/dL (ESA conversion Study FGCL-4592-064) and ≤ 11 g/dL vs > 11 g/dL (ESA conversion 
Study 1517-CL-0613). In addition, NDD studies were stratified by screening estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR). Patients in ESA conversion DD Studies 1517-CL-0613 and FGCL-4592-064 were 
stratified by previous average weekly ESA dose and previous ESA treatment (Study 1517-CL-0613 
only). 
Efficacy Assessment Schedule 
For the evaluation of Hb efficacy endpoints, all studies used central laboratory Hb assessments. The 
timepoints of Hb assessments for the main phase 3 NDD and DD studies were generally every 2 weeks 
until week 24 to 36 and every 4 weeks after that. Assessments undertaken for the analysis of other 
efficacy endpoints were generally similar across all main phase 3 studies. See also results tables for 
differences in endpoints. 
Study periods 
All main phase 3 studies had a minimum duration of 52 weeks. Studies FGCL-4592-060 before 
amendment 2 (NDD), and FGCL-4592-064 and FGCL-4592-063 after amendments 1 (DD studies) and 
all patients randomised into Studies D5740C00001 and D5740C00002 were scheduled to run until a 
common time point to observe the requisite number of patients with adjudicated CV endpoint events in 
the phase 3 study programme. Studies 1517-CL-0608 (NDD), 1517-CL-0610 (NDD), and 
1517-CL-0613 (DD) had a protocol-defined maximum treatment duration of 104 weeks.

Safety evaluation 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed safety data at least every 6 months or twice per 
calendar year while the trial was ongoing to ensure subject safety during the study. In general, an 
Independent Event Review Committee (IERC), blinded to the treatment group, adjudicated prespecified 
safety events of interest. 
Study Participants  
Patient were generally included with > 18 years of age, and body weight > 45 and < 160 kg. Patients 
in the non-dialysis studies were to be CKD stage 3, 4, or 5 (< 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) and not on dialysis. 
Serum folate levels and vitamin B12 were to be in the normal range. For the Hb correction studies 
patients were included with Hb < 10 g/dL, while for the ESA conversion studies (0613, 064, partly 
002) this was set at Hb > 9 to 9.5 g/dL and < 12.0 g/dL. Ferritin and TSAT levels could be ≥ 30 ng/mL 
to ≥ 50 ng/mL and ≥ 5% to ≥ 15%, respectively, for the placebo-controlled NDD studies, and 
≥ 100 ng/mL and ≥ 20% for the ESA comparator studies. Depending on the dialysis study, patients 
were to be on dialysis <> 4 months (but > 2 weeks), and ≥ 8 weeks on ESA prior to randomisation. 
For the non-dialysis Hb correction study 0610 comparing roxadustat with ESA therapy, the patients 
were eligible for treatment with ESA using the criteria specified in the Kidney Disease Improving Global 
Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 recommendation considering the rate of fall of Hb concentration, prior 
response to iron therapy, the risk of needing a transfusion, the risks related to ESA therapy and the 
presence of symptoms attributable to anaemia.   
Relevant exclusion criteria were ESA therapy within 6 to 12 weeks prior to randomisation (for the Hb 
correction studies), iv iron use 6 to 12 weeks prior to randomisation (in the NDD studies), iron-
chelating agents within 4 weeks before randomisation, RBC transfusion within 8 weeks before 
randomisation, conditions leading to blood loss (including elective surgery and GI bleeding). Patients 
with (recent) malignancies were also not allowed in the main studies. 
Treatments 
Initial dosing 
For patients who were not already receiving ESA, the study drug was initially dosed based on either a 
tiered weight-based approach for patients in NDD Studies 1517-CL-0608, FGCL-4592-060 and 
1517-CL-0610 and in DD Studies FGCL-4592-063 and D5740C00002, or on a fixed starting dose 
approach for patients in NDD Study D5740C00001. In the DD Studies 1517-CL-0613, FGCL-4592-064 
and D5740C00002, roxadustat dose for patients already treated with ESA was chosen based on the 
patient’s average prescribed weekly ESA dose within 4 weeks prior to randomisation.

Roxadustat dose adjustment to maintain target Hb levels between 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL were permitted at 
week 4 and at intervals of every 4 weeks until week 52 and every 8 weeks thereafter. For roxadustat, 
a dose adjustment algorithm, as summarised in the table below, was used. Dose adjustment by dose 
step increases and decreases for roxadustat were determined based on current Hb levels (measured 
locally using the HemoCue® device) as well as on change in Hb level. Roxadustat dose steps were as 
follows: 20, 40, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mg and for patients on dialysis only, up to 
400 mg. When the Hb level was ≥ 13 g/dL at any time, the dose of roxadustat was withheld until the 
Hb was < 12 g/dL and resumed at a dose that was decreased by 2 dose steps. 
Placebo dosing in individual placebo-controlled studies was blinded and thus followed the same 
monitoring schedule and adjustment instructions as those for roxadustat.  
DA dosing in Studies 1517-CL-0610 and 1517-CL-0613 followed centrally approved SmPC and EPO-alfa 
dosing in Study 1517-CL-0613 followed UK SmPC. Studies FGCL-4592-064 and D5740C00002 followed 
approved ESA package insert or SmPC and Study FGCL-4592-063 followed the US package insert or 
SmPC.

For the NDD studies, see rescue therapy. 
For DD studies, iron supplementation was permitted in the study with oral iron as the first-line iron 
supplementation. IV iron was permitted for subjects who did not respond (in the opinion of the 
investigator) or were not able to tolerate oral iron AND were iron deficient based on central laboratory 
results of ferritin <100 ng/mL or TSAT <20%. Up to 250 mg of IV iron was administered per 
administration cycle. 
Rescue therapy 
In the main phase 3 placebo-controlled NDD studies, rescue therapy included red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusion, ESA or intravenous iron. In the main phase 3 ESA-controlled NDD Study FGCL-4592-0610 
and all main phase 3 DD studies, rescue therapy included RBC transfusion and ESA (roxadustat-treated

patients only). Instructions for initiating these rescue therapies were similar in all main phase 3 
studies: 
● 
RBC transfusion was allowed in all patients who needed rapid correction of anaemia due to acute 
or severe blood loss, patients that had moderate to severe symptoms from their anaemia (e.g., 
dyspnea at rest or on mild exertion) or the investigator was of the opinion that the blood 
transfusion was a medical necessity. 
● 
ESA was allowed in patients who met all the following criteria: 
o  Hb level that had not sufficiently responded to ≥ 2 dose increases or maximum dose limit of 
the study drug had been reached. 
o  Hb was lower than a prescribed value depending on the study; either < 8 g/dL (placebo-
controlled NDD studies), < 8.5 g/dL (Studies FGCL-4592-0613 and FGCL-4592-063) or 
< 9 g/dL (Studies 1517-CL-0610, FGCL-4592-064 and D5740C00001) on 2 consecutive 
measurements. 
o  Clinical judgement did not suggest iron deficiency or bleeding as a cause of lack of response 
or rapid decline in Hb. 
o  Reducing the risk of alloimmunisation in transplant-eligible patients and/or reduction for other 
RBC transfusion-related risk was the goal. 
o  Rescue ESA was limited to a maximum of 4 weeks (2 courses in placebo-controlled NDD 
studies, 1 course in ESA-controlled NDD study and 1 course in DD studies). 
● 
In the individual placebo-controlled main phase 3 NDD studies, intravenous iron was initiated (as 
per local standard of care or a maximum dose of 250 mg once daily) by the investigator if Hb had 
not responded to ≥ 2 dose increases or the maximum dose (by body weight) of the study drug 
while taking oral iron (all studies except Study D5740C00001), the patient was unresponsive to or 
did not tolerate oral iron, and Hb was < 8.5 g/dL and ferritin were < 100 ng/mL or TSAT was 
< 20% (all studies). 
● 
The need for a third course of rescue therapy automatically led to treatment discontinuation. 
Objectives 
Placebo-controlled NDD studies 
The primary objectives of all placebo-controlled studies in NDD patients were to evaluate the efficacy 
of roxadustat compared to placebo for the treatment of anaemia in CKD patients, not on dialysis. 
ESA controlled ongoing open-label NDD study 
The 1517-CL-0610 study evaluated the efficacy of roxadustat compared to DA in the treatment of 
anaemia in NDD patients in the setting of correction of Hb. 
ESA controlled DD studies 
Of the 4 studies in DD patients, two had the primary objective to evaluate the efficacy of roxadustat 
compared with EPO-alfa and/or DA in the maintenance treatment of anaemia in ESRD patients on 
stable dialysis (1517-CL-0613, FGCL-4592-064) in the setting of conversion of ESA to roxadustat. 
In one study the primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of roxadustat in the 
treatment of anaemia in ID (initiating dialysis) DD patients compared with active control (FGCL-4592-
063) in the setting of correction of low Hb levels.

In one study the primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of roxadustat for the treatment 
of anaemia in CKD patients on dialysis (D5740C00002) both in the setting of conversion of ESA and

In the placebo-controlled NDD studies, a minimum of 450, and up to 600 (1517-cl-0608), 1200 (fgcl-
4592-060), 2600 (d5740c00001) patients were planned to be randomised to receive roxadustat or 
placebo (2:1 with approximately 300 roxadustat versus 150 placebo) in a double-blind manner in order 
to support the primary endpoint(s) of the study. Three hundred patients for the roxadustat group and 
150 patients for the placebo group were needed to achieve at least power of 95% to demonstrate a 
statistically significant difference with a 5% 2-sided significance level between roxadustat and placebo 
in the primary endpoint assuming that the proportion of patients with a response in the roxadustat 
group is at least 65% and in the placebo group is at most 25%. 
During the course of the Phase 3 studies, which were being conducted in parallel, up to 600 (1517-cl-
0608), 1200 (fgcl-4592-060), 2600 (d5740c00001) subjects might have been enrolled in the studies to 
support the overall safety evaluation of roxadustat across pooled multiple studies in the Phase 3 
programme, including adjudicated composite safety endpoints of interest. 
In Study 1517-cl-0610, approximately 570 patients were planned to be randomised to receive 
roxadustat or darbepoetin alfa as follows: 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 68/153  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 19: Sample size calculations per treatment arm 
Two hundred and forty-eight (248) patients for the roxadustat group and 208 patients for the 
darbepoetin alfa group will provide at least 98% test power to demonstrate statistically noninferiority 
of roxadustat versus darbepoetin alfa in the primary endpoint assuming that the proportion of patients 
with a response in both groups is at least 80% and a noninferiority margin for the difference of 
proportions of 15%. The power for the sensitivity analysis of post-amendment 1 data (336 patients) 
will be at least 93%. 
In the ESA controlled DD studies, 300 patients for the roxadustat treatment group and 300 patients for 
the ESA treatment group would provide 97% power to statistically demonstrate noninferiority of 
roxadustat versus ESA in the EU primary endpoint in both the total study population and the planned 
subset population analysis assuming a difference (roxadustat minus ESA) of -0.25 g/dL in the Hb 
change from baseline and an SD of 1.5 g/dL, following a parametric chain procedure. 
During the course of these studies, which were being conducted in parallel, up to 1200 (fgcl-4592-064 
and fgcl-4592-063) or 2000 (d5740c00002) subjects were to be enrolled for safety evaluation of 
roxadustat in comparison to epoetin alfa including prespecified and adjudicated safety events of 
interest. 
For the sample size for cardiovascular safety analysis, a 30% per year study drug discontinuation 
incidence rate is assumed in estimating the patient-exposed-years (PEYs) for roxadustat and the active 
control arms, based on data from the peginesatide phase 3 programme. For placebo, the rate of 
discontinuations is expected to be up to 70% per year. 1500 and 2320 patients are expected to be 
included for EMA MAA in non-dialysis and dialysis respectively. 
Table 20 shows the minimum number of events and test power expected for EMA MAA.

Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised using an IWRS and depending on the study at a 1:1 ratio or 2:1 ratio to 
receive roxadustat or placebo/ comparator. Depending on the study, several stratifications were 
applied. 
Blinding (masking) 
Three out of 4 NDD studies were placebo-controlled studies. Placebo tablets were identical to 
roxadustat tablets in appearance, packaging, and labelling. The storage and dose preparations were 
also the same as roxadustat. The investigator, study site staff, subject, and the sponsor and 
designees, were blinded to study drug assignment, but not to the dose. Treatment assignments 
remained blinded until the completion of the study. When possible and appropriate, the blind was 
maintained for sponsor personnel responsible for analysis and interpretation of results. Any intentional 
or unintentional breaking of the blind was reported and documented. Breaking the blind (for a single 
subject) was considered only when knowledge of the treatment assignment was deemed essential by 
the investigator for the subject’s care. Unplanned unblinding resulted in the discontinuation of subject 
participation from the study. 
For the comparator studies, an open-label design was selected  
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
Across all the main phase 3 studies, the full analysis set (FAS) was primarily used to show superiority 
and the per-protocol set (PPS) to show non-inferiority of the primary and/or secondary endpoints. The 
definitions of each population were similar across all main phase 3 studies: 
● 
● 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set included all randomised/enrolled patients. 
The FAS analysis set consisted of all randomised/enrolled patients who received at least 1 dose of 
the study drug and had at least 1 non-missing post-dose Hb assessment. In addition, patients in 
Studies FGCL-4592-060, D5740C00001 and D5740C00002 were also required to have baseline Hb 
assessment. 
● 
In Studies 1517-CL-0608, 1517-CL-0610 and 1517-CL-0613, the PPS included all FAS patients 
who received at least 2 weeks (Studies 1517-CL-0608 and 1517-CL-0610) or 12 weeks (Study 
1517-CL-0613) of treatment and did not meet any of the reasons to exclude a complete patient 
from the PPS. In Studies FGCL-4592-060, FGCL-4592-064, FGCL-4592-063, D5740C00001 and 
D5740C00002, the PPS consisted of all patients in the FAS population who received at least 
8 weeks of treatment, had at least 1 valid post-dose Hb assessment and were without any major 
protocol violations. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
For the placebo-controlled NDD studies, the proportion of responders in the primary efficacy variable 
was compared using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the region, history of CV, 
baseline Hb and baseline eGFR, comparing roxadustat to placebo. 
Subjects who discontinued or received rescue therapy before or on the date of the second consecutive 
Hb value that fulfilled the definition of response were classified as non-responders. 
For the ESA-controlled NDD and DD correction studies (1517-cl-0610 and fgcl-4592-063), the 
proportion of responders in the primary efficacy variable were compared using a Miettinen & Nurminen 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 70/153  
 
 
 
(MN) approach, adjusting for region, history of CV, baseline Hb and baseline eGFR and comparing 
roxadustat to darbepoetin alfa. 
The Miettinen and Nurminen method was used to calculate the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in 
rates. If the resulting lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI between roxadustat and darbepoetin alfa 
was > -0.15, non-inferiority would be concluded. 
Subjects who discontinued or received rescue therapy before or on the date of the second consecutive 
Hb value that fulfils the definition of response were classified as non-responders. 
For the DD conversion studies, the change from baseline to the average Hb of weeks 28 to 36, without 
having received rescue therapy within 6 weeks prior to and during this 8-week period, were computed 
from the Mixed Model of Repeated Measures method (MMRM). The MMRM model was run for the 
purpose of implicit imputation of missing data by using all the available information from the observed 
data via the within-patient correlation structure. The analysis was based on the estimated difference 
between the two treatment arms overall mean effects throughout the evaluation period (weeks 28 to 
36) based on this MMRM model. 
The model contained treatment arm, region, CV History, previous ESA treatment, visits and visit by 
treatment as categorical variables. It also contained baseline Hb and baseline Hb by visit as a 
continuous variable. The unstructured covariance pattern model was used. If the unstructured 
covariance pattern did not converge, then heterogeneous Toeplitz, (homogeneous) Toeplitz structure 
or first-order autoregressive covariance structure would be used to achieve convergence, 
consecutively. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the analysis of the primary endpoint would be repeated using different 
analysis sets, analysis methods and handling of missing data. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints 
Binary endpoints were analyzed using the same methods as for the binary primary endpoints. 
The analysis of the US primary endpoint change from baseline Hb, and some other continuous 
endpoints used ANCOVA. The mean value of all change from baseline values available within the pre-
specified timeframe was used as the dependent variable, baseline values and stratification factors used 
in randomisation were included as covariates (baseline values) or fixed effects (other covariates). For 
the primary efficacy analysis, a multiple imputation ANCOVA method was used, assuming MAR. 
For other continues endpoints, the MMRM, as described above, was used. 
For time to event variables, treatments were compared using a Cox proportional hazards model. 
Stratification factors used in randomisation will be used as covariates (baseline values) or fixed effects 
(other covariates). The Efron method was used for ties. The p-values, hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 
confidence intervals for the HR were reported. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative proportion of 
subjects with events were estimated and plotted, with the number of subjects at risk indicated below 
the plot at specific time points. 
Non-inferiority margins 
Non-inferiority margins for the primary endpoints were defined for both the correction (-15%) and the 
conversion (-0.7.5 g/dl) studies. The margin for the correction studies was accepted in a previous 
application (Mircera). The margin for conversion studies was based on relatively conservative statistical 
reasoning, preserving at least 70% of the EPO effect in previous studies, which is close to the natural 
fluctuation in Hb within patients (0.5%). For quality of life endpoints, the non-inferiority margin was 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 71/153  
 
 
 
based on the MCIs in the user’s manual, and for blood pressure, a margin of 1mmHg was chosen 
based on clinical judgement. 
Multiplicity 
Efficacy parameters were tested sequentially in contributing studies; however, the order as tested was 
not consistent between studies. 
In study 1517-cl-0613, the primary analysis of the EU (EMA) primary efficacy endpoint was tested both 
in the overall population and in the subset of patients defined as subjects with an average prescribed 
weekly epoetin or darbepoetin dose within the last four weeks prior to randomisation ≤ 200 IU/kg or ≤ 
1 μg/kg respectively, following a parametric chain procedure. The information fraction (subjects in the 
subset population/total study population) was calculated at the time of database hardlock. The overall 
one-sided significance level (alpha) was fixed at 0.025. If both null hypotheses are rejected, secondary 
endpoints were assessed on the overall population. 
Analysis of cardiovascular safety 
An adjudicated event was classified as on-treatment if it occurred on or after Day 1 of study treatment 
and up to 3, 7 or 28 days after the end of treatment (OT-3, OT-7 and OT-28, respectively). 
Post hoc on-study analyses were performed on data from the NDD population. 
A summary of the individual adjudicated events, and the composition of MACE categories specified in 
endpoint definitions is provided in the Table 21 below. 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 72/153  
 
 
 
 
 
Table 21: Adjudicated events and composite cardiovascular endpoint definitions 
The primary analysis used the Cox model that would be applied separately for each study and 
population, analyzing the time to the first occurrence of the event. Patients who had no event during 
their time in the study would be included as censored observations. Different models were applied for 
the non-dialysis and the dialysis studies, respectively. 
For non-dialysis studies, a very high discontinuation rate is expected after the transition to dialysis, 
during the trial, especially in subjects treated with placebo. Subjects were also expected to have a 
higher rate of MACE+ events after dialysis. Both mechanisms would lead to a significant bias should 
the standard Cox model be applied in this population. Therefore, a Cox model weighted inversely for 
the probability of censoring was fitted to MACE+ for the non-dialysis studies. In the censoring model, 
the event of interest was censoring. Time to MACE+/censoring data were merged with the eGFR 
values at baseline and during the study up to the event of interest and with the date of initiation of 
dialysis data using a vertical (long format) dataset as used for the counting process formulation of the 
Cox model. The eGFR/dialysis classes (eGFR >= 30; 15 <= eGFR < 30; 10 <= eGFR < 15; eGFR < 
=10; or dialysis) were used as a time-dependent covariate, treatment and endpoints as baseline 
covariates together with baseline log-transformed eGFR and age. Un-stabilised and stabilised IPCW 
weights for each subject and event time were calculated and a Cox model was fitted on MACE+ using 
these weights.

Studies 1517-CL-0613 and 1517-CL-0610 recruited patients from centres in Europe and Study 
FGCL-4592-064 planned to recruit patients from centres globally, however all patients who actually 
took part in the study were from the US region only. All other studies recruited patients from centres 
globally. 
Conduct of the studies 
Protocol violations: The most common protocol deviations were: receipt of wrong treatment or 
incorrect doses of the study drug (30.4% of patients on roxadustat; 22.2% on patients on placebo) 
[Study 1517-CL-0608], prohibited medication deviation (8.9% of patients on roxadustat; 13.7% of 
patients on placebo) and operational deviation (12.0% of patients on roxadustat; 8.5% of patients on 
placebo) [Study FGCL-4592-060] and violation of inclusion or exclusion criteria (11.2% of patients on 
roxadustat; 11.1% of patients on placebo) [Study D5740C00001]. 
GCP violations: A total of 47 all randomised patients from Studies D5740C00001 and D5740C00002 
were excluded from the study ITT populations due to major GCP violations or being phantom subjects 
due to technical issues.

The numbers in parentheses represent the sequence in which the endpoints were tested i.e., [1] represents the 
primary endpoint and [2] to [13] represent the secondary endpoints that were formally tested sequentially in a 
fixed sequence testing procedure. 
Endpoints indicated as ‘not formally tested’ refer to where the fixed sequential testing procedure was stopped based 
on pre-specified criteria. Not every efficacy endpoint listed in the table above was evaluated as a primary or 
secondary endpoint in all of the studies. Therefore, cells containing NA refer to the endpoints that were not formally 
tested as a primary or secondary endpoint in the studies as per protocol.

Iron parameters 
In the NDD pool, mean serum iron increased from baseline to week 52 in the roxadustat group 
(9.94 [38.47] µg/L); there was no change in the placebo group (1.54 [35.04] µg/L). In the roxadustat 
group, serum iron initially decreased from baseline to week 8, subsequently increased to above 
baseline at week 20 and remained relatively stable up to week 52. Serum iron levels in patients in the 
placebo group remained stable over the course of the study. Patients in the roxadustat group had a 
greater mean decrease in mean ferritin from baseline to week 52 (-52.09 [253.43] µg/L) than patients 
in the placebo group (14.59 [204.13] µg/L) [ISE]. This trend was observed over 52 weeks. In the NDD 
pool, the change from baseline to week 52 in mean transferrin saturation was comparable between 
treatment groups (0.05 [14.23]% on roxadustat and 0.30 [12.70]% on placebo). In the roxadustat 
group, mean transferrin saturation initially decreased from baseline to week 8, but then increased to 
baseline levels and remained stable up to week 52. Transferrin saturation in the placebo group 
remained similar over the course of the study. In the NDD pool, there was a statistically significant 
decrease from baseline in serum hepcidin to week 24 compared with the placebo group (LS mean 
difference: -25.86 µg/L; 95% CI: -33.09, -18.63; P < 0.0001)]. 
In the comparator study 0610, serum ferritin, TSAT and serum iron were comparable between 
roxadustat and ESA.

primary endpoint and [2] to [8] represent the secondary endpoints that were formally tested sequentially in a 
fixed sequence testing procedure.  
Endpoints indicated as ‘not formally tested’ refer to where the fixed sequential testing procedure was stopped based 
on pre-specified criteria. Not every efficacy endpoint listed in the table above was evaluated as a primary or 
secondary endpoint in all of the studies. Therefore, cells containing NA refer to the endpoints that were not formally 
tested as a primary or secondary endpoint in the studies as per protocol.

Iron Parameters 
In the stable DD subpool, there was a decrease from baseline in mean serum iron to week 52 in the 
ESA group (-9.20 [35.82] µg/L); there was no change in the roxadustat group (0.26 [42.70] µg/L). 
A greater decrease from baseline in mean ferritin to week 52 than those in the ESA group 
(-246.24 [332.82] µg/L roxadustat, -165.97 [386.12] µg/L ESA) was observed. Mean transferrin 
saturation decreased from baseline to week 52 in both treatment groups (-6.00 [16.88] µg/L 
roxadustat, -5.72 [15.28] µg/L ESA); this trend was observed at different timepoints and was similar 
between treatment groups. There was a nominally statistically significant decrease from baseline in 
serum hepcidin to week 24 in the roxadustat group compared with the ESA group (LS mean 
difference: -17.04 µg/L; 95% CI: -25.59, -8.50; P < 0.0001). 
In the ID DD subpool, change from baseline in serum iron, change in ferritin and transferrin saturation 
was not calculated. There was a nominally statistically significant decrease from baseline in serum 
hepcidin to week 24 (-63.47 [121.84] µg/L) in the roxadustat group compared with the ESA group

In Studies 1517-CL-0613, FGCL-4592-064 and D5740C00002, the proportion of patients who required 
the use of rescue therapy was comparable between groups over the efficacy emergent period in 
Studies 1517-CL-0613 and FGCL-4592-064 or up to 3 days after the EOT in Study D5740C00002. 
There was no difference between groups in time to first use of rescue therapy.

Cholesterol effect by statin use 
In the NDD pool and ID DD and stable DD subpools, approximately 20% of patients in each treatment 
group were on statin treatment at the start of the study. In the NDD pool, the change from baseline in 
LDL-C was -0.38 vs 0.13 mmol/L with statin use and -0.46 vs 0.01 mmol/L without statin use. This 
was -0.52 vs 0.07 mmol/L and -0.60 vs -0.13 mmol/L, respectively, in the ID DD subpool, and -0.31 
vs 0.04 mmol/L and -0.40 vs -0.02 mmol/L, respectively, in the stable DD subpool.

Supportive study(ies) 
Several phase 2 and 3 studies have been performed in the US, Japan, and China, some as part of the 
registration of the product for China and Japan. Studies were generally smaller and with shorter follow-
up than the main studies for this EU application. Two US phase 2 studies in NDD patients showed a 
dose-dependent Hb effect versus placebo and one phase 2 study showed conversion of ESA to 
roxadustat with maintaining of Hb effect. Further, one phase 2 and two phase 3 studies in NDD 
patients in Japan showed a dose-dependent effect on Hb versus placebo and/or possible conversion 
from ESA therapy. One phase 2 and four phase 3 studies in dialysis Japanese patients showed possible 
correction, maintenance and/or comparable Hb effect compared to ESA with different doses or dose 
regimens of roxadustat. One phase 2 study with different dose cohorts and one phase 3 study showed 
correction of Hb versus placebo in a study in Chinese NDD patients. One phase 2 and one phase 3 
study showed a comparable or improved Hb effect versus ESA therapy in Chinese dialysis patients. 
Further, one phase 2 Hb correction study in starting dialysis patients and one very small long-term 
study in dialysis and non-dialysis patients showed correction of Hb and maintenance of Hb conducted 
in US/Hong Kong/Russia. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The overall design was considered acceptable. The selection of an open label design for the comparator 
studies although not optimal was attributed to challenges due to different administration route (would 
need multiple additional injections or infusions), and potentially identifiable difference in iron 
supplementation requirements which was acceptable.

The primary endpoint for the main NDD phase 3 studies defined as the proportion of patients who 
achieved a Hb response at 2 consecutive visits during the first 24 weeks of treatment without rescue 
therapy is considered appropriate to evaluate the correction of Hb during a sufficient period of time. 
Response defined as Hb ≥ 11.0 g/dL and a Hb increase from baseline by ≥ 1.0 g/dL, or increase from 
baseline by ≥ 2.0 g/dL in any patient with baseline Hb ≤ 8.0 g/dL, is considered of clinical relevance. 
Although this endpoint should also be interpreted in conjunction with the endpoint of mean change in 
Hb during the study in week 28 to 36 (without rescue medication), used as secondary endpoints in 
these studies. Moreover, the other Hb related endpoints, including percentage of time within a certain 
Hb level range are of support as well to sufficiently understand the full Hb treatment effect. Further, 
the proportion of patients above a certain threshold Hb level is of interest for the risk of overshooting 
and in potentially in relation to safety aspects. 
For study FGCL-4592-063, a Hb correction study, a similar endpoint of proportion of patients who 
achieved a Hb response was used as for the NDD studies (all correction studies), which is acceptable. 
For 3 out of 4 DD studies, where DD patients were already on ESA therapy at thus more at or close(r) 
to appropriate Hb levels, the use of mean change in Hb during the study in week 28 to 36 as primary 
endpoint provides the most efficient use of the Hb data for evaluation, which is considered appropriate. 
Hb response as a key secondary endpoint in these studies is acceptable. These endpoints should be 
evaluated in conjunction with the other secondary Hb control endpoints to sufficiently understand the 
entire Hb treatment effect. 
All studies included secondary objectives which were analysed in sequential order. These included 
safety evaluation, the effect on LDL-cholesterol, Hb response, need for iv iron and need for RBC 
transfusion which are particularly useful in comparison to existing ESA therapy to provide further 
insight and nuance to potential advantages of roxadustat versus ESA. 
Hb response in the setting of increased CRP (hsCRP > ULN) as a secondary endpoint was defined in 2 
NDD studies (FGCL-4592-060, D5740C00001) and 3 of the DD studies (FGCL-4592-064, FGCL-4592-
06, D5740C00002), as Hb response may be less in the setting of inflammation, and thus could likely 
demonstrate that the effect of roxadustat would also be present in the setting of inflammation. In this 
context, though, inflammation defined by > ULN in hsCRP may be somewhat imprecise due to the lack 
in specificity of this marker. 
The relevance of evaluation of LDL-C cholesterol change in the context of treatment of anaemia was 
also discussed. In the literature, it has been described that this appears to be a drug class effect, as 
HIF activation increases lipoprotein uptake and has been shown to promote the degradation of HMG-
CoA reductase reducing cholesterol synthesis (Sanghani 2019). 
The definitions of the analysis sets are acceptable. Of note, for non-inferiority comparisons, both the 
per-protocol and the full analysis set are considered of importance and should lead to similar 
conclusions. These were provided as sensitivity analyses. Missing data after discontinuations is 
discussed below 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Non-dialysis pool (NDD pool) 
Placebo-controlled NDD studies 
During the placebo-controlled studies in the NDD pool, a large proportion of patients discontinued 
treatment. This was lower in the roxadustat group (901 [37.8%]) than in the placebo group 
(1115 [59.2%]). Reasons for discontinuation are not well understood as a large proportion of patients 
discontinued due to patient decision (10.5% vs 20.7%), development of study-specific discontinuation 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 105/153  
 
 
 
criteria (3.2% vs 13.4%), and withdrawal by patient (6.0% vs 7.6%) without further clear details on 
these categories. A clear understanding of these factors is important as such high proportion and 
difference in discontinuation may likely impact efficacy evaluation likely in the advantage of 
roxadustat. Discontinuations due to adverse events were higher for roxadustat than for placebo (6.3% 
vs 4.4%), but apparently not a major contributor to patients discontinuing therapy. A lower eGFR as 
one reason of earlier discontinuation has been presented. 
In the NDD pool, patients were generally representative of a CKD population not on dialysis with 
anaemia. Most patients had CKD stage 4 and 5 (38%, 43%), with a mean eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 
and a mean Hb level of 9.1 g/dL. A representative number of patients > 65 years of age was included 
(47%) and sufficient patients from Europe were included (25%). Approximately 40% had iron 
depletion (according to criteria of ferritin < 100 ng/ml and or TSAT <20%). Most pronounced reasons 
for CKD were diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy. 
For the 3 placebo-controlled studies in the NDD pool, the primary endpoint of patients who achieved 
Hb response during the first 24 weeks without rescue medication was higher for roxadustat (80.2%) 
than for placebo (8.7%)(OR 40.5% (95%CI 33 -50, p< 0.0001), and was consistent across the 
different studies. The difference in the correction of Hb between was maintained over time during 104 
weeks of treatment. Mean weekly dose of roxadustat was relatively stable over time (approximately 
3.2 mg/kg) during this period. Other Hb endpoints were consistent with the primary Hb endpoint. 
However, the proportion of patients with levels > 12 g/dL and > 13 g/dL was higher for roxadustat 
than placebo (in study 1517-CL-0608; 23.4% vs 3.65%, and 5.6% vs 0.5%, respectively). The need 
for dose adjustments was in line with these observations (12.8% vs 0.8% on dose hold due to Hb > 13 
mg/dL). Despite improvement in Hb, the effect of roxadustat on the improvement of patient-reported 
outcome measures at week 12 has not been clearly demonstrated, especially since superiority for the 
SF-36 PF (physical function) component (in contrast to the VT component) could not be met in study 
001 (HR 0.44 (-0.11, 0.99), while not formally tested in the other studies. 
Based on the difference in Hb effect, a lower proportion of patients required rescue therapy (difference 
in incidence rate per 100 patient-years at risk 0.19; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.23; P < 0.0001). Although the 
the time to RBC transfusion was only formally tested and showed a significantly lower risk (HR 0.37 
(0.30, 0.44)), with no formal testing for ESA use and i.v. iron use. In line with the mechanism of action 
initial decline (to week 8) with subsequent reversibility to baseline (week 20) was observed in iron 
need, expect for transferrin saturation where no difference was observed (0.05 [14.23]% vs 
0.30 [12.70]%). A decrease of hepcidin was also seen up to week 24 (LS mean 
difference: -25.86 µg/L; 95% CI: -33.09, -18.63; P < 0.0001), although the exact clinical meaning in 
terms of iron responsiveness is not clear (Batchelor, JASN, 2020). 
A significant larger reduction in LDL-C cholesterol was found with treatment of roxadustat (-17.35 vs 
2.1%; difference LS mean: -19.83; 95% CI: -22.16, -17.51; P < 0.0001) during week 12-28 (week 24 
in study D5740C00001) from a baseline level of 2.56 mmol/L. However, a counteracting effect on HDL-
C was observed, with a difference of -4.1 mg/dL (0.11 mmol/L) (-5.0 - -3.3), p <0.0001 for roxadustat 
vs placebo from a mean baseline of 47 mg/dL (1.22 mmol/L). Therefore, the clinical implications of this 
finding in the context of treatment for anaemia and in relation to the observed increased CV risk are 
unclear. 
There was no clinically relevant difference in an increase in blood pressure as evaluated by mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) and time to blood pressure increase in studies 608 (0.66 vs -0.08 mmHg; 13.4 
vs 12.1 event rate per 100 PY, respectively), and 060 (0.02 vs -0.12 mmHg; 12.3 vs 12.7 event rate 
per 100 PY, respectively). 
The renal function (eGFR) appears to remain stable during the first 12 weeks of treatment with 
roxadustat and appears to decline in a similar rate for both groups afterwards (not formally tested), 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 106/153  
 
 
 
with some difference between studies ((0.59, -0.65 and -0.51 ml/min/1.73m2 for the 3 placebo-
controlled studies).  
For the NDD placebo-controlled studies some differences in effect across subgroups appear, although 
no p for interaction has been provided. Especially the lower response for lower ferritin/TSAT status and 
baseline, CRP > ULN, and higher body weight, are of interest due to claims being made, and dosing 
according to weight as proposed. Although, the effect according to hsCRP level <> ULN was part of the 
sequential testing in study 060, where the effect according to this subgroup appeared comparable to 
the overall effect. 
Subgroup data according to age have been presented for age groups of <65, 65 to 75, 75 to 85 and 
>85 years in the ancillary subgroup analyses (see ancillary analysis) and do not suggest any difference 
in effect.  
Any effect on HbA1c has not been observed. 
ESA controlled open label NDD study 
For the ESA controlled open-label study (0610), study discontinuation is comparable (15.5% 
roxadustat, 14.0% DA). Also, for this study, patients were generally representative of a CKD 
population not on dialysis with anaemia. The main difference is that fewer patients than in the placebo-
controlled studies had iron depletion (15.8% vs 21.8%, according to criteria of ferritin < 100 ng/ml 
and or TSAT <20%), likely due to the different inclusion requirement. Patients characteristics were 
fairly similar between both treatment groups. 
The proportion of patients who achieved Hb response in the first 24 weeks was similar between the 
roxadustat (89.5%), and DA (78.0%) groups and non-inferiority was achieved (difference 11.5% 
(95%CI 5.7 – 17.4)) with a NI margin of -15%. Other Hb endpoints were consistent with these 
findings with maintenance of effect. However, the time percentage of time with haemoglobin values 
> 12 g/dL was higher with roxadustat than with darbepoetin ESA (23.9% vs 20.3%) and for > 13 g/dL 
(3.7% vs 2.7%) during the efficacy period. It is not clear whether this may be associated with 
potentially less accurate oral dosing steps of roxadustat versus sc or iv dosing with ESA. In line with 
the Hb effect, the need for rescue therapy (exploratory) showed to be comparable between treatment 
arms (RBC transfusions (6.2% vs 6.6%) and only 2.2% in the roxadustat needed ESA), and 
comparable improvements in SF-36-PF (difference in mean change -1.28 (-2.4 - -0.1) and SF-36-VT (-
0.42 (-1.6 - -0.8) were observed.  
Time to iv iron use was significantly improved for roxadustat versus ESA (HR 0.46 (0.27, 0.80)) and 
iron was less used for roxadustat (6.2%) than for darbepoetin ESA (12.3%) (not rescue therapy), 
while iron parameters (ferritin, TSAT and serum iron) were comparable between treatment groups. As 
with the placebo-controlled studies, a significantly larger reduction in LDL-C cholesterol was found with 
treatment of roxadustat difference. No difference in blood pressure or time to blood pressure increase 
versus ESA was observed (MAP difference from baseline 0.55 vs 0.59 mmHg; 30.0 vs 34.5 events rate 
per 100 PY). No substantial differences were observed for subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint 
of responders and the key secondary endpoint of mean Hb change between roxadustat and ESA 
therapy. 
ESA controlled DD studies 
For the DD pool, more patients discontinued the study and treatment for roxadustat than ESA 
treatment (28.3% vs 21.7%; 41.2% vs 32.4%, respectively), which could be of concern. This was 
consistent across the studies, except for the Hb correction study 063 (41.2 vs 40.7% treatment 
discontinuation). Main reasons for treatment discontinuation were death (8.6% vs 7.5%), 
discontinuation due to AEs (6.3% vs 3.6%), patient decision (5.7% vs 3.7%), and withdrawal by 
Assessment Report

Page 107/153  
 
 
 
patient (5.4% vs 4.4%). Except for AEs, these categories could not be clearly further specified. 
Comparison for the ID (incident dialysis) DD population versus the stable DD population has also been 
provided. The ID DD population consists of all patients from study FGCL-4592- 
063 (n= 1042), 36 patients from study FGCL-4592-064 and 411 patients from study D5740C00002. 
For the DD pool, the per-protocol set (PPS) is important for the assessment of the non-inferiority for 
the primary endpoint and several of the secondary endpoints. The PPS population was 80 to 95% of 
the intention to treat the population with some slight differences between treatment groups for each 
study, although acceptable. 
In all 4 DD studies, non-inferiority for roxadustat in comparison to ESA therapy on the primary 
endpoint of change from baseline in Hb without the use of rescue therapy up to weeks 28 to 36 was 
demonstrated with a Hb difference of approximately 0.30 g/dL. For the Hb correction 
study FGCL-4592-063, non-inferiority was evaluated based on the endpoint of patients who achieved 
haemoglobin response during the first 24 weeks, which showed NI was confirmed (difference of 
proportion 3.5 (95%CI -0.7 – 7.7), which is well within the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of 
> -15%). For the ESA conversion studies, comparable results were obtained. The effect on Hb could be 
maintained during long term follow-up. Mean dose level remained relatively stable between 3.2 and 
4.0 mg/kg during this period. Also for the ESA group, Hb was maintained and mean dose level 
remained relatively stable between 136.7 and 11.3 IU/kg (ID DD subpool) and 118 to 175 IU/kg 
(stable DD subpool). However, the proportion out of Hb range was higher with roxadustat (percentage 
of time > 12 g/dL was 17.1 (16.5) vs 10.0 (13.4)) and > 13 g/dL was 1.9 (4.1) vs 0.78 (2.6)). In line 
with these observations, more patients needed a dose withheld due to Hb >13 mg/dL (23.8% vs 
12.8% ID DD and 11.7% vs 3.4% in DD DD pool). In line with comparable Hb effect, rescue therapy in 
terms of the incidence rate of RBC transfusions or ESA therapy was comparable between roxadustat 
and ESA therapy (HR 0.98 (0.66-1.46); 0.89 (0.63 – 1.25) and 1.07 (0.84 – 1.36) for studies 0613, 
0645 and 002, respectively), and quality of life indicators ( SF-36-PF (physical function) 41.7 (10.1) vs 
41.7 (9.9) and SF-36-VT (vitality) 41.7 (10.1) vs 41.7 (9.9), as only formally tested in study 0613. 
The mean IV iron use was lower in all studies (12-59 mg vs 37-88 mg based on different evaluation 
periods), with some more decrease in mean ferritin levels and stable transferrin saturation. A decrease 
of hepcidin was also seen up to week 24, which would comply with the proposed mechanism of action, 
although the exact clinical meaning is not clear. 
A change of -0.37 to -0.47 mmol/L was observed in LDL-C to week 12-28, 12-24 or to 24 weeks for 
roxadustat versus ESA which was significant in all 4 individual studies (from a baseline level of 2.28 to 
2.92 mmol/L. HDL-C was changed over week 12 to 28 with a difference of -0.10 mmol/L. 
There was no clinical relevant difference in any increase in blood pressure as evaluated by mean 
arterial pressure (MAP) and time to blood pressure increase in studies 0613 (-0.60 vs 0.27 mmHg; 
32.8 vs 37.2 event rate per 100 PY), 064 (0.10 vs -0.59; 41.0 vs 33.9 event rate per 100 PY), and 063 
(-0.12 vs 1.15; 16.9 vs 17.9 event rate per 100 PY). 
Subgroup analyses for the DD pool were presented according to the ID (incident dialysis) DD subpool 
and the stable dialysis DD subpool. In the IDD subpool, no substantial differences appear across 
subgroups for the mean change in Hb from week 28 to 52. For the stable DD subpool, roxadustat 
appears to do slightly better for US vs Europe and others. Further, a lower ferritin/TSAT status showed 
a lower effect for roxadustat vs ESA for mean Hb levels, which may not be expected if roxadustat 
would improve iron availability, however no p for interaction has been provided. For the endpoint of 
proportion of responders no differences appear in de DD pool, although confidence intervals were wide.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Non-dialysis pool 
Treatment with roxadustat shows a clear improvement in efficacy for correction and maintaining Hb 
levels versus placebo; however this was not clearly associated with a significant improvement in 
patient-reported outcomes of SF-36 VT and PF. A clear lower need for rescue therapy (RBC 
transfusion, iv iron use, ESA therapy) was observed for roxadustat vs placebo. The proportion of 
overshooting (> 12 and >13 g/dL) was higher with roxadustat. Any effect on a delay of renal function 
decline could not be shown. In comparison to ESA, comparable efficacy for correction and maintaining 
Hb levels was observed with comparable improvement in QoL and a lower need for iv iron use. 
Roxadustat treatment is associated with a slight lowering of LDL-C; however, in relation to the 
increased CV risk (see safety), the clinical meaning is unclear. 
Dialysis pool 
Treatment with roxadustat shows comparable efficacy for correcting and maintaining Hb levels versus 
ESA therapy and was maintained over time in both groups. The proportion of overshooting (> 12 and 
>13 g/dL) was higher with roxadustat. Roxadustat treatment is associated with a slight lowering of 
LDL-C, however, in relation to the increased CV risk (see safety), the clinical meaning is unclear. 
Monthly iv iron use was lower with roxadustat than with ESA in 3 of the 4 studies. Time to rescue 
therapy (in particular RBC transfusions) was comparable to ESA therapy. Patient-reported outcomes 
have only been formally tested in one study and showed to be comparable to ESA therapy. Effects on 
blood pressure/hypertension appear to be comparable between roxadustat and ESA therapy. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall 
A total of 12,048 patients were treated in phase 2 and phase 3 studies of the clinical development 
programme, 5985 of whom were NDD patients, and 6063 of whom were DD patients. A total of 3542 
NDD patients were treated with roxadustat, 2020 patients with placebo, and 423 patients with 
darbepoetin alfa (DA). A total of 3353 DD patients were treated with roxadustat, 4 patients with 
placebo, and 2706 patients with erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). 
NDD pool 
Placebo controlled studies 
The median duration of treatment was substantially longer for the roxadustat groups than placebo 
groups for the NDD pool (87.1 vs 57.1 weeks), with a less pronounced difference in the NDD NDD 
(patients censored for dialysis) pool (62.0 vs 51.3 weeks). This was due to fewer patients discontinuing 
treatment in the roxadustat groups than placebo. 
For the NDD pool, greater percentages of patients in the roxadustat than placebo groups were on 
study drug for > 52 to 104 weeks (37.0% vs 32.3%), > 104 to 156 weeks (26.8% vs 18.9%), and 
> 156 weeks (7.2% vs 2.2%). The same trend was observed for the NDD NDD pool. 
Active comparator study 
In Study 1517-CL-0610, the median durations of treatment were similar for the roxadustat group 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 109/153  
 
 
 
(50.3 weeks) and DA group (48.1 weeks).  
The mean and median doses of roxadustat decreased in the period following start of treatment, with 
subsequent stabilisation. 
DD pool 
The DD pool consisted of 4715 patients and was further examined in 2 further subpools of ID DD and 
stable DD. The safety analysis set for the ID DD subpool consisted of 1526 patients, including 1039 
from Study FGCL-4592-063, 71 from Study FGCL-4592-064, and 416 from Study D5740C00002; 760 
patients were in the roxadustat group, and 766 patients were in the ESA group. The safety analysis set 
for the stable DD subpool consisted of 3188 patients, including 834 from Study 1517-CL-0613, 669 
from Study FGCL-4592-064, and 1685 from Study D5740C00002; 1594 patients each were in the 
roxadustat and ESA groups. 
The median duration of treatment was slightly longer for the ESA group than the roxadustat group for 
the DD pool (103.1 vs 94.1 weeks) and for the ID DD subpool (59.9 vs 54.6 weeks). For the stable DD 
subpool, the median duration of exposure was similar for roxadustat (103.7 weeks) and ESA (103.9 
weeks). In the DD pool, duration of exposure of > 104 to 156 weeks was 550 (23.4%) vs 636 (26.9%) 
and > 156 weeks was 302 (12.8%) vs 385 (16.3%). 
In conversion Studies 1517-CL-0613 and FGCL-4592-064, the mean and median doses of roxadustat 
decreased in the period following start of treatment with subsequent stabilisation, but the mean and 
median doses of ESA increased during the course of treatment. In Hb correction Study 
FGCL-4592-063, the mean and median doses of roxadustat and ESA remained stable over the course 
of treatment following a small decline after the start of treatment.

•  Ophtalmological effects (retinal disorders) 
As specifically evaluated during a 24 weeks phase 3 study, no clinically meaningful changes from week 
0 in the proportion of patients with the evidence of retinal haemorrhages, hard exudates and cotton 
wool spots were found in either the roxadustat or darbepoetin alfa group. The proportion of patients 
with new or worsening retinal haemorrhages during the treatment period was 32.4% (46/142 patients) 
and 36.6% (53/145 patients), respectively. No difference in retinal thickness was observed (change 
from baseline (-4.93 vs 1.64 (right eye) and -1.07 vs -0.31 um (left eye) at 24 weeks for roxadustat 
vs ESA). 
Post-hoc analysis of adverse events 
Imbalances in certain specific adverse events and laboratory measures were noted during the review of 
safety data from the NDD and DD pools. These TEAEs were identified using 3 methods: 
● 
TEAEs were identified that had either a ≥ 1% difference between roxadustat and comparator 
group or were double the incidence in 1 group and were at least 1% in either group and also had 
a difference in IR between treatment of > 1. 
● 
TEAEs were identified that had statistically significant increases in HR for roxadustat in the 
adjudicated event analysis. 
● 
TEAEs were identified based on known risks for ESAs. 
These events are presented as post-hoc TEAEs and SAEs of special interest in and are individually 
discussed in the sections below. 
A focus of the assessments was to determine whether there was conclusive evidence for a causal 
relationship between the occurrence of the event and the use of roxadustat. Decisions on whether a 
causal relationship existed were based on clinical judgment and factors such as: frequency, severity, 
seriousness, event incidence exceeding comparator incidence, whether the event occurred in both the 
NDD and DD populations, the extent to which the event was consistent with the pharmacology and 
non-clinical data of the drug.

Cardiovascular Safety and Overall Deaths 
NDD pool placebo comparison 
Analyses of on-treatment and ITT CV and mortality rate have been provided below. 
Table 44: Analysis of Time to MACE, MACE+ and ACM for Events Classified as OT-28 (Original 
and Simplified IPCW Cox Models) NDD Studies and Pool 
For the ITT MACE analyses this was 480 (20.1%) vs 350 (18.6%) with IR 10.6 vs 10.3 and HR 1.10 
(0.96, 1.27). For studies 060, 0608 and 001 this was 0.89 (0.60, 1.30), 1.23 (0.76, 1.99) and 1.13 
(0.96, 1.32), respectively. For MACE+ ITT this was 578 (24.2%) vs 432 (22.9%); IR 13.2 vs 13.2; HR 
1.07 (0.94, 1.21). 
For the ITT mortality analyses this was 400 vs 301 with IR 8.3 vs 8.1 and HR 1.08 (0.93, 1.26). For 
studies 060, 0608, and 001 this was HR 0.75 (0.50, 1.13), HR 1.11 (0.65, 1.90), and HR 1.15 (0.97, 
1.37), respectively. 
Fatal events occurred in 276 (11.6%) vs 134 (7.1%) with IR 6.9 vs 5.5. This was mainly observed in 
cardiac disorders (IR 1.3 vs 1.5), infections and infestations (IR 1.8 vs 0.7) with sepsis (IR 0.6 vs 0.1), 
renal and urinary tract disorders (IR 1.1 vs 0.9) and general disorders and administration site 
conditions (IR 1.0 vs 0.7). For other fatal AE SOC categories, IRs were below 1.

‡ HR comparing roxadustat to active control was derived using a meta-analysis method which combines individual 
study log-HRs with weights inversely proportional to the variance of the study-specific log-HRs  
§ HR in Study 1517-CL-0610 was obtained using a single Cox model stratified by region (Central and Eastern 
Europe vs Western Europe and Israel) and CV history (yes vs no), and adjusted on age, BL Hb and log-transformed 
eGFR as continuous covariates with treatment as a fixed effect. HR in Studies FGCL-4592-063 / FGCL-4592-064

DD pool (overall, conversion from ESA subpool) 
Overall 
MACE was increased in the a-priori defined OT-7 on-treatment analysis (7 days after last dose; HR of 
1.09 (0.95 – 1.26) (371 (15.8%) vs 398 (16.9%)).  
The mortality rate was also higher for roxadustat than for ESA therapy (IR of 6.7 vs 6.2 per 100PY; HR 
1.13 [95% CI: 0.95, 1.34]) during treatment (OT-7; follow-up to 7 days after the last dose), despite a 
lower total number of deaths for roxadustat (11.2% vs 11.7%). 
Fatal events occurred in 359 (15.3%) vs 359 (15.2%) with IR 9.1 vs 8.0. This was mainly observed in 
cardiac disorders (IR 3.0 vs 2.7), infections and infestations (IR 1.7 vs 1.3) with sepsis (IR 1.0 vs 0.8), 
and general disorders and administration site conditions (IR 1.7 vs 1.4). For other fatal AE SOC 
categories, IRs were below 1. 
Conversion from ESA 
Analyses of on-treatment CV and mortality risk have been provided below for conversion from ESA 
including studies 064 (90% of the patients), 0613, and 002 (80% of the patients).

Liver enzymes 
Effects on liver enzymes were ALT > 3 × ULN 1.2 vs 2.2, AST > 3 × ULN 1.8 vs 1.9 and total bilirubin 
> 2 x ULN 0.8 vs 0.3 for roxadustat vs placebo. Patients with elevated ALT, AST, and total bilirubin 
values are discussed below for each individual study in the NDD pool. No case of Hy’s law was 
observed in any study. 
Study 1517-CL-0608 
Only 1 patient in the roxadustat group had an ALT and/or AST level > 3 × ULN and total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN; this patient recorded values of ALT: 108 U/L, AST: 113 U/L, and bilirubin: 59.1 µmol/L at 
Week 2. The patient died on Day 15 due to pyelonephritis chronic and multiple organ dysfunction 
syndrome, which were considered unrelated to treatment by the investigator. The increases in liver 
enzymes were thought to be due to the multiorgan failure.

Study FGCL-4592-060 
One subject in the placebo group met potential Hy’s law criteria (ALT 220 U/L, AST 295 U/L, and 
bilirubin 2.46 mg/dL) at Week 60; however, these elevations were preceded by non-serious TEAEs of 
bile duct stone and biliary colic. 
Study D5740C00001 
Twelve patients (6 in the roxadustat group and 6 in the placebo group) met the laboratory criteria for 
potential Hy’s law cases (ALT ≥ 3 × ULN or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN). The 
elevations in ALT/AST and total bilirubin were independent of time and therefore may not have 
occurred concurrently. All cases had a plausible alternative etiology for the elevated liver function tests 
and did not meet Hy’s law criteria. Three roxadustat-treated patients had an observed AST level 
≥ 1000 U/L and were noted to have documented etiologies (i.e., acute hepatitis B, associated acute 
infection and ischemic hepatopathy, and alcoholic hepatitis). Narratives for these patients are provided 
in [Module 5.3.5.3, D5740C00001, Section 11.4]. 
Study 1517-CL-0610 
Effects on liver enzymes were ALT > 3 × ULN 0.3 vs 1.0, AST > 3 × ULN 2.5 vs 1.4 and total bilirubin 
> 2 x ULN 0.9 vs 0 for roxadustat vs ESA. No patients in either treatment group were recorded with 
ALT and/or AST > 3 × ULN and total bilirubin > 2 × ULN.

Liver enzymes 
Effects on liver enzymes were ALT > 3 × ULN 1.5 vs 1.6 (incidence rate per 100 PY), AST > 3 × ULN 
1.5 vs 1.8 and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN 1.4 vs 0.4 for roxadustat vs ESA. Patients with elevated ALT, 
AST, and total bilirubin values are discussed below for each individual study in the DD pool. 
Study 1517-CL-0613 
A total of 2 (0.5%) patients in the roxadustat group and 2 (0.5%) patients in the ESA group had ALT 
and/or AST > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN at any point during the study. The majority of 
patients’ values returned toward baseline by the end of the patients’ participation in the study, and the 
investigator considered there to be plausible reasons for the elevated liver values other than a 
relationship with study drug. 
Study FGCL-4592-063 
A total of 5 patients (2 in the roxadustat group and 3 in the EPO-alfa group) had ALT and/or AST > 3 x 
ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN. All 5 cases had established or suspected etiologies for the increases 
and, therefore, did not meet Hy’s law criteria. 
Study FGCL-4592-064 
One patient in the EPO-alfa group had concurrent elevations of AST ≥ 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x 
ULN. The patient was discontinued from study drug and permanently withdrawn from the study due to 
an AE of cholangiocarcinoma. Given an identifiable cause for the liver function transaminase 
elevations, the patient was not considered to have met Hy’s law. 
Study D5740C00002 
Twelve patients (4 in the roxadustat group and 8 in the ESA group) had ALT or AST ≥ 3×ULN and total 
bilirubin ≥ 2×ULN). The elevations in liver function values were independent of time and, therefore, 
may not have occurred concurrently. For all 12 patients, there was an alternative explanation for the 
elevation in liver biochemistry other than a relationship with study drug. 
Lipid parameters 
Change from baseline in LDL-C was -0.22 vs -0.19, HDL-C -0.006 vs -0.009, triglycerides -0.18 vs -
0.12 mmol/L for roxadustat vs ESA.  
Vital signs 
A systolic blood pressure of ≥ 170 and increase of ≥ 20 was 21.3 vs 20.0 (incidence rate per 100 PY), 
systolic BP ≤ 90 and decrease of ≥ 20 3.9 vs 3.2, diastolic BP ≥ 110 and increase of ≥ 15 4.6 vs 4.5, 
diastolic BP ≤ 50 and decrease of ≥ 15 5.8 vs 5.1, pulse rate ≥ 120 and increase of ≥ 20 1.9 vs 1.7,

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions (DDI) with statins: In Phase 1 studies, roxadustat increased the Cmax and AUCinf 
of the active metabolite of simvastatin 40 mg 1.9-fold and 1.75 -fold, respectively; of rosuvastatin 10 
mg 4.5-fold and 2.9-fold, respectively; and of atorvastatin 40 mg 1.3-fold and 2.0-fold, respectively. 
Roxadustat pharmacokinetics (PK) was unaffected. These DDI are well-characterised and described in 
the product label. In addition, the incidence and adjusted incidence rate of combined 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 129/153  
 
 
 
 
rhabdomyolysis/myopathy events, with or without concomitant use of statins, was similar in the NDD-
CKD safety pool between roxadustat, 0.3% (0.2/100 PY) and placebo, 0.4% (0.3/100 PY). In the DD-
CKD safety pool, the incidence and incidence rates were also low in both treatment groups, 0.3% 
(0.2/100 PY) for roxadustat and 0.1% (0.1/100 PY) for active comparators. Myopathy related adverse 
drug reactions (e.g., rhabdomyolysis), are known to be associated with statins, and it is routine health 
clinical practice to monitor patients taking statins for these events and to manage statin therapy when 
prescribing concomitant medications that interact with statins. Therefore, there is no expected clinically 
significant impact on the benefit-risk balance of roxadustat due to drug-drug interactions with statins 
and this risk is not considered a safety concern for roxadustat.

Post marketing experience 
Roxadustat received first marketing authorisation in China for treatment of anaemia in DD and NDD on 
17 Dec 2018 and 16 Aug 2019, respectively. As of the data cut-off date of 07 Sep 2019, 100 patients 
were exposed to roxadustat as part of a donation programme in China. The available post-marketing 
safety data have not suggested any new important risks. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A total of 12048 patients (5885 NDD, 6063 DD) have been included in the clinical development 
programme. For the pivotal NDD (non-dialysis dependent) placebo-controlled studies (NDD pool) there 
were 2386 on roxadustat and 1884 on placebo, for comparison to ESA in NDD this was however limited 
to 525 on roxadustat and 423 on ESA. For the pivotal DD (dialysis-dependent) population (DD pool) a 
substantial number of 2354 on roxadustat versus 2360 on ESA (2197 on epoetin-alfa, 163 on 
darbepoetin) have been evaluated. Other patients treated with roxadustat were mainly from other 
phase 2 and 3 supportive studies in the US, Japan and China. 
Further, particularly adverse events of interest have been evaluated, including acute pancreatitis, 
hepatic disorders, malignant tumours, retinal disorders, and rhabdomyolysis/myopathy. Moreover, in 
line with the EMA reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal products, 
MACE events have been adjudicated by an independent committee and evaluated for MACE and 
MACE+. Due to the increased risk of ESA therapy on CV safety, these analyses are of particular 
importance. MACE is considered the most relevant analysis, especially since no clear justification has 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 131/153  
 
 
 
 
 
been provided on the importance of analysing MACE+, and thus is considered only to be supportive. An 
analysis, including the on-treatment events, is the preferred analysis according to the EMA reflection 
paper. Also, thromboembolic risk has been reported with ESA, so specific attention for pulmonary 
embolism (PE) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) that required hospitalisation has been given. 
NDD pool placebo-controlled studies: In the NDD pool, roxadustat patients were treated substantially 
longer than placebo due to increased discontinuation in the placebo group (mean 84.6 vs 64.3 weeks). 
Long term safety has been evaluated, although more patients were treated for more than 52 weeks in 
the roxadustat arm than placebo. More adverse events, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, drug related 
serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs occurred in the roxadustat versus placebo however this 
cannot be entirely explained by the longer treatment duration of roxadustat due to higher 
discontinuation in the placebo group. 
NDD comparator study: Adverse events, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, drug-related serious AEs and 
discontinuations due to AEs occurred consistently higher for roxadustat however, substantial 
differences for increased frequency for roxadustat vs ESA were not found.  
DD pool: For the DD pool, in all studies, roxadustat was compared to ESA therapy, and therefore 
pooling of data can be considered appropriate despite that differences in study design are present. In 
the DD pool, the duration of treatment was slightly longer for the ESA group than the roxadustat group 
(mean 87.6 vs 98.7 weeks). Longer-term treatment data beyond 52 weeks are also present and this 
was also longer for ESA. Adverse events, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, drug-related serious AEs and 
discontinuations due to AEs occurred consistently higher for roxadustat versus ESA therapy, especially 
if calculated based on incidence rate (as treatment period was longer for ESA). This was more 
pronounced in the stable DD pool than the ID DD pool. However substantial differences for increased 
frequency for roxadustat vs ESA were not found.  
Based on further post-hoc evaluation by the applicant of difference in frequency, hazard ratio, or based 
on known risk of ESA, adverse events of nausea, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism (PE), 
convulsions (seizures), vascular access thrombosis (VAS), hyperkalaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, 
hypertensive exacerbation, diarrhoea, headache, peripheral oedema and insomnia have been included 
as adverse reaction in the labelling. However, for similar reasons constipation and pyrexia should also 
remain as ADRs in the labelling. 
CV and mortality risk evaluation 
Hb correction versus placebo (NDD placebo-controlled studies):  
A potentially increased CV safety risk with roxadustat versus placebo could not been excluded based 
on adjudicated MACE events in this pool. Both the MACE and MACE+ primary analyses are suggestive 
of an increased CV safety risk for treatment with roxadustat with a HR > 1 and with an upper CI 
outside the 1.3 margin. This strict(er) margin is considered relevant based on the known CV risk with 
ESA therapy, especially associated with increased levels of Hb, also the pivotal treatment effect for 
roxadustat. Further sensitivity analyses correcting for possible factors including Hb over time, 
hyperkalaemia, DVT/PE and hypertension, or a model with simple correction all show comparable 
increased HRs. Whether this method is able to appropriately correct for any residual confounding 
remains uncertain. An ITT approach was set a-priori at time of disclosure of the main studies but 
before unblinding of the adjudicated MACE events and shows a HR of 1.10 (0.96 – 1.27) for MACE and 
1.07 (0.94 – 1.21) for MACE+ with upper CI levels just below this margin. However, this method is not 
preferred due to lower sensitivity, because events will be less likely due to the randomised treatment 
and more likely due to the background event rate and subsequent therapies (especially due to the 
possibility of introducing ESA therapy after treatment discontinuation), hence adding noise and 
possibly introducing new confounders to the treatment comparison.  
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 132/153  
 
 
 
Further, increased mortality was observed in the roxadustat group versus placebo (10.9% vs 6.5%; IR 
6.4 vs 5.0; HR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.90, 1.51]) during treatment. CV mortality was also increased (HR: 
1.17 [95% CI: 0.82, 1.67]). The increased fatal events occurring with roxadustat vs placebo (11.6 vs 
5.5%; IR 6.9 vs 5.5) was primarily due to cardiac disorders (2.2 vs 2.0%; IR 1.3 vs 1.5), infections 
and infestations (3.0 vs 1.0%; IR 1.8 vs 0.7), and renal and urinary disorders (1.9 vs 1.2%; IR 1.1 vs 
0.9), with sepsis and renal death as most notable individual fatal AEs.  
Other possible factors associated with the observed increased CV and mortality risk have also been 
further explored. Hb overshooting could not clarify on any increased risk, however, non-responders (< 
10 g/dL Hb during) during 24 weeks of treatment clearly show an increased CV and mortality risk. A 
similar observation can be noticed in the DD pool, supporting the notion that this can likely not (only) 
be attributed to any possible difference in baseline population risk and/or early discontinuation.  In this 
context, it should be noticed that after a decrease from baseline a constant proportion of patients of 
10-15% is observed after 12 weeks of treatment for whom Hb levels remain < 10g/dL. This warrants 
specific dose recommendations for those patients not sufficiently responding on roxadustat treatment, 
as included in the SmPC.  
Hb correction in NDD and DD studies versus ESA  
Correction of Hb versus ESA has been evaluated in the NDD study 1517-CL-0610 and the DD study 
FGCL-4592-063, 20% of the patients in the DD study D5740C00002, (and 10% of the ID-DD patients 
in study FGCL-4592-064). As baseline characteristics and treatment discontinuation (33.8% vs 31.0%) 
were approximately comparable in these studies, on-treatment analyses for CV and mortality risk are 
likely the most reliable of the 3 data pools as presented. These data are not suggestive for an 
increased CV and mortality risk versus ESA therapy (HR 0.81 (0.62, 1.05) and 0.80 (0.59, 1.08) for 
OT-7 and 0.93 (0.73, 1.18) and 0.99 (0.76, 1.30) for OT-28 evaluations).  
ESA conversion in DD studies in stable dialysis patients (comparison versus ESA) 
In addition to the overall DD pool data showing an increase in MACE on-treatment OT-7 of HR of 1.09 
(0.95 – 1.26) (371 (15.8%) vs 398 (16.9%)) and mortality risk (IR of 6.7 vs 6.2 per 100PY; HR 1.13 
[95% CI: 0.95, 1.34]), data for the conversion from (stabilised) ESA treatment to roxadustat pool has 
also been evaluated based on studies 1517-CL-0613, FGCL-4592-064 (90%) and D5740C00002 
(approximately 80%).  
A difference in observed increased CV and mortality risk in this pool (MACE HR 1.21 (1.04, 1.42) and 
mortality (1.24 (1.05, 1.48)) versus the observed suggestion for absence of CV and mortality risk in 
the correction pool can be noticed. This has been clarified by the design related issue of the need for 
switching to roxadustat treatment in one study arm whereas ESA patients could remain on their 
stabilised dose for maintaining their Hb level in the target range. Fluctuations caused by necessary up- 
or down-titration of the doses of study treatment, likely increasing the patient burden and inflicting Hb 
variability, are only seen in the roxadustat-treated patients and could possibly clarify the differences in 
increased discontinuation for roxadustat (44.7 vs 32.7%) and CV and mortality outcomes compared to 
the stable ESA therapy. As clarified, such switching strategy for a stable ESA treated patient is not 
common clinical practice unless there is a valid clinical indication to do so. However, following this 
reasoning and the imposed possible treatment complications and possible increase in CV and mortality 
risk should have clear consequences for the switching recommendation as mentioned in posology 
section of the SmPC.  
In line with the increased hazard ratio as evaluated for the meta-analytic approach, slightly more fatal 
adverse events occurred in the roxadustat vs ESA (15.3 vs 15.2%), primarily due to cardiac disorders 
(5.0 vs 5.2%; IR 3.0 vs 2.7), general disorders and administration site conditions (2.9 vs 2.6%), and

infections and infestations (2.8 vs 2.5%) for the complete DD pool. Individual adverse events were too 
limited to identify any clear pattern. 
Both the non-dialysis versus placebo pool and the ESA conversion in stable dialysis pool have specific 
issues that complicate interpretation. As baseline characteristics and treatment discontinuation were 
approximately comparable in the pool of correction of Hb versus ESA (2), on-treatment analyses for CV 
and mortality risk are likely the most reliable of the 3 data pools as presented. 
Possible (other) factors associated with CV risk 
• 
ESA hyporesponsiveness 
Within the DD conversion setting, the applicant has provided the results according to (previous) ESA 
dose level. First, for the subgroup with baseline ESA of > 7000 IU/week higher roxadustat doses were 
needed vs baseline ESA of ≤ 7000 IU/week, while dosing adjustments (increases, decreases and 
holds) were comparable between both subgroups. Also, the proportion of roxadustat patients with Hb 
levels <10 g/dL during treatment appeared to be slightly lower in the low vs high ESA baseline dose 
group (data not provided), which could reflect a better response in the lower dose group. Further, the 
risk for MACE and mortality appears to be higher in the high baseline ESA dose group (MACE HR 1.49 
(1.13, 1.97) and mortality (1.45 (1.04, 2.01) for baseline ESA of > 7000 IU/week group vs HR 1.06 
(0.86, 1.29) and 1.17 (0.92, 1.48) in the baseline ESA of ≤ 7000 IU/week group).  
Further, in both the non-dialysis and dialysis pool a lack of sufficient response of remaining Hb levels 
below 10 g/dL have been observed to be associated with a possible increased CV and mortality risk, as 
already presented in previous round based on Hb levels measured prior to the event (MACE for R vs 
comparator event rates 17.1 vs 6.2 (NDD), 20.6 vs 14.1 (study 0610), 17.8 vs 15.9 (DD Hb 
correction), 22.5 vs 15.7 (stable DD)). Such results should have clear implications for dose 
recommendations, as included in the SmPC. 
•  Hyperkalaemia, exacerbation of hypertension, and baseline Hb level 
The applicant has provided subgroup analyses for hyperkalaemia, exacerbation of hypertension and for 
baseline Hb levels <> 8 g/dL for the correction of Hb study pool and the stable DD study pool. These 
data do not consistently demonstrate a pattern of increased CV and mortality risk with any of these 
baseline factors. Unfortunately, no such data have been presented for the NDD pool, where these 
factors have been integrated in the ICPW analysis model instead. 
Finally Fibrogen, Inc. (the development partner for roxadustat in response (to FDA by Fibrogen, Inc., 
April 6 2021), disclosed that it included post-hoc changes to the stratification factors as applied in the 
primary cardiovascular safety analyses. It has been formally confirmed that these post-hoc analyses 
did not substantially differ from the results as presented during the MAA procedure, nor were used in 
current submission. The correct data have been submitted for completeness and have not impacted 
the decision making during the MAA procedure.  
Other safety aspects 
Data according to age category did not identify any clear pattern related to age. 
Relevant increases in exposure of statins are observed based on phase I study PK data including 1.9-
fold and 1.75 -fold increase in Cmax and AUCinf for the active metabolite of simvastatin 40 mg, 4.5-fold 
and 2.9-fold for rosuvastatin 10 mg, and 1.3-fold and 2.0-fold for atorvastatin 40 mg. Despite this 
increased exposure of statins with roxadustat no clear increased risk of myopathy was observed in 
both the NDD pool (roxadustat, 0.3% (0.2/100 PY) and placebo, 0.4% (0.3/100 PY)) and the DD pool 
(0.3% (0.2/100 PY) for roxadustat and 0.1% (0.1/100 PY) for active comparators). Information on the 
interaction with statins has been included in section 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC.

No apparent increase of adverse events potentially associated with VEGF increase such as retinal 
disorders (3.1 vs 2.2% NDD (IR 1.9 vs 1.7); 1.6 vs 1.6% DD) or malignant tumours (2.0 vs 1.9%, IR 
1.2 vs 1.4 per 100PY in NDD; 2.5 vs 2.2% DD) were identified 
For liver enzyme evaluation no apparent differences were observed in ALT > 3 x ULN (2.6% vs 
3.0%), and AST > 3 x ULN (2.6% vs 3.5%), while total bilirubin > 2 x ULN was slightly greater for 
roxadustat (2.4% vs 0.9%; IR 1.4 vs 0.4). 
Post marketing data appear to be limited (100 patients in China as of the data cut-off date of 07 Sep 
2019) and do not sufficiently contribute to evaluate the safety profile of the product in clinical practice. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Adverse events, serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs occurred consistently higher for 
roxadustat than placebo in the NDD pool and versus ESA therapy in the DD pool. Specific adverse 
events could be identified based on increased frequency in both pools for roxadustat, including e.g. 
nausea, deep vein thrombosis, convulsions (seizures), and vascular access thrombosis (VAS).  
Further, the CV and mortality risk appear to be at a similar level as for ESA based on data from the 
correction of Hb study data. Evaluation in other data pools including comparison to placebo and in the 
stable dialysis pool are associated with methodological and study design issues complicating 
interpretation. Nevertheless, factors and circumstances can be identified that could increase this risk. 
These have been included in the product information.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 17.12.2018. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of roxadustat with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers roxadustat to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Evrenzo (roxadustat) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Roxadustat is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with symptomatic anaemia associated with 
chronic kidney disease (CKD). 
Anaemia in CKD is caused by insufficient production of erythropoietin or imbalance in oxygen sensing. 
The prevalence of anaemia increases in frequency and severity in the more advanced stages of CKD. 
The impaired ability of the body to absorb and use stored iron, the shorter life span of red blood cells 
(RBCs), the decrease in erythropoietin responses in haematopoietic cells due to inflammation and 
nutritional deficiency and the blood loss associated with haemodialysis (HD) are contributing factors. 
Anaemia contributes to the excess morbidity (risk of hospitalisation, CV risk) and mortality in CKD 
patients and is associated with symptoms such as fatigue, reduced oxygen use, shortness of breath, 
increased cardiac output, left ventricular hypertrophy, insomnia, lethargy, headaches, dizziness, lack of 
concentration and reduced cognitive functioning, reduced libido and reduced immune responsiveness 
resulting in a reduced quality of life (QoL) and increased healthcare system burden. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment for anaemia associated with NDD (non-dialysis) or dialysis-dependent (DD) patients 
with CKD includes iron supplementation (oral or iv), treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents 
(ESA) (sc or iv), and/or RBC transfusions. 
Iron supplementation can increase Hb levels to resolve anaemia in patients with CKD, but iron alone 
is rarely sufficient when CKD disease advances and requires additional treatment to sufficiently raise 
Hb levels. Oral iron is initially preferred, but responsiveness is variable (variable absorption) and GI 
effects are common. IV iron use is more potent in the dialysis population (in NDD this is not exactly 
clear). However, it may be associated with hypotension and dyspnoea and rarely results in potentially 
life-threatening events of acute hypersensitivity reactions requiring specific precautions upon 
administration. 
Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been regarded as the standard of care, depending 
on the type of patients. Several options include short-acting epoetin (EPO)-alfa or the long-acting 
darbepoetin alfa (DA). While improvement in QoL has been demonstrated, an increase in the risk of CV 
adverse events (AEs), all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and thromboembolic 
events is observed when high Hb targets of 13 to 15 g/dL are achieved. 
RBC transfusion in CKD patients with anaemia is seen as last resort therapy, mostly effective but can 
be associated with a risk of allosensitisation, which decreases the availability of obtaining matching

organs for patients eligible for kidney transplantation. Other risks can be introducing pathogens, 
hyperkalaemia, and volume overload. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical package of Evrenzo was primarily supported by eight main clinical studies, of which 4 were 
performed in non-dialysis dependent patients (NDD) and 4 were performed in dialysis-dependent 
patients (DD).Three out of 4 studies in NDD patients were randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies to evaluate the efficacy of roxadustat compared to placebo for the treatment 
(correction) of anaemia in CKD patients not on dialysis. The fourth study was a multicentre, 
randomised, open-label active-controlled (versus ESA) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
roxadustat in the treatment (correction) of anaemia in chronic kidney disease patients not on dialysis. 
The 4 studies in DD patients were all randomised, open-label active-controlled studies to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of roxadustat either in the maintenance treatment of anaemia (conversion of ESA) 
in CKD patients on stable dialysis, (correction) treatment of anaemia in ID (initiating dialysis) CKD 
patients compared with active control or both conversion of ESA or correction of anaemia in CKD 
patients on dialysis. 
The primary evaluation was based on evaluation of haemoglobin levels, including responder rates for 
the correction studies and mean Hb levels for the ESA conversion studies. Several other secondary 
endpoints were included for sequential testing. 
All studies included at least an evaluation period of 52 weeks with extension to 104 weeks or 3 to 4 
years for individual cases (versus placebo or active-comparator).The median duration of treatment was 
substantially longer for the roxadustat groups than placebo groups for the NDD pool (87.1 vs 57.1 
weeks), with a less pronounced difference in the NDD (patients censored for dialysis) pool (62.0 vs 
51.3 weeks). This was due to fewer patients discontinuing treatment in the roxadustat groups than 
placebo. For this reason, the safety characteristics expressed in IR per 100 patient-years are more 
reliable for an unbiased interpretation of the data. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
NDD pool (non-dialysis dependent pool) 
The 3 placebo-controlled studies demonstrated improvement in haemoglobin levels for 
roxadustat versus placebo as demonstrated by achieved Hb response during the first 24 weeks of 
treatment without rescue medication (80.2% vs 8.7%; OR 40.5% in patients generally representative 
of a CKD population not on dialysis with anaemia. This effect could be maintained over time during at 
least 104 weeks of treatment. The effect was consistent across the 3 placebo-controlled studies and 
consistent with an improvement in mean Hb levels (during week 28 to 36). Mean weekly dose of 
roxadustat was relatively stable over time (approximately 3.2 mg/kg) during this period. The 
correction of haemoglobin levels was comparable to that obtained with ESA therapy, as 
demonstrated in study 0610. The proportion of patients who achieved Hb response in the first 
24 weeks was non-inferior for roxadustat (89.5%) compared to darbepoetin (78.0%) (difference 
11.5%; NI margin of -15%) and was maintained during 104 weeks of treatment. Mean Hb levels were 
also comparable during week 28 to 36. 
The need for rescue therapy was improved with roxadustat versus placebo as formally tested in all 3 
studies (difference in incidence rate per 100 patient-years at risk 0.19;), with the greatest difference in 
the proportion of patients using RBC transfusions (5.0% vs 13%) and ESA therapy (2.0% vs 14%) and 
somewhat less for iv iron therapy (2.1% vs 4.8%). As formally tested in study D5740C00001, the need 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 139/153  
 
 
 
for RBC transfusion also showed a significantly lower incidence (HR 0.37 (0.30, 0.44)) for roxadustat 
versus placebo. As also formally tested, the need for iv iron use (not defined as rescue therapy in this 
study) was significantly lower for roxadustat versus ESA (HR 0.46 (0.27, 0.80)). 
Subgroup data, according to age do not suggest for any difference in effect. 
A significant larger reduction in LDL-C cholesterol was found with treatment of roxadustat versus 
placebo (-17.35 vs 2.1%) and ESA therapy (-0.39 mmol/L vs 0.11 mmol/L); during week 12-28 (week 
24 in study D5740C00001) from a mean baseline level of 2.56 mmol/L in the placebo-controlled 
studies and 2.61 mmol/L in the active comparator study. 
DD pool (dialysis dependent pool) 
A comparable effect on haemoglobin levels was observed for roxadustat versus ESA therapy in 
dialysis patients, as non-inferiority of change from baseline in Hb without the use of rescue therapy up 
to weeks 28 to 36 as the primary endpoint was demonstrated in 3 ESA conversion studies. All studies 
excluded the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of > -0.75 g/dL)) of the NI margin. A similar Hb effect 
was also observed for the primary endpoint of patients who achieved haemoglobin response during the 
first 24 weeks in correction study FGCL-4592-063 (difference of proportion 3.5 (95%CI -0.7 – 7.7), 
which was well above the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of > -15%). Comparable results were 
seen across the studies for these endpoints and the effect was maintained during 104 to 200 weeks of 
treatment. Mean dose level remained relatively stable between 3.2 and 4.0 mg/kg during this period. 
A significant lower mean IV iron use (although based on different evaluation periods) was observed in 
3 studies (12 (47.6) mg vs 44.8 (88.6) mg and 17.1 (53.4) vs 37.0 (107) mg conversion studies 0613 
and 064, respectively; 53.2 (175) vs 87.8 (260) mg correction and Hb maintenance study 002). 
Rescue therapy in terms of the incidence rate of RBC transfusions was similar (non-inferior) 
between roxadustat and ESA therapy (HR 0.66 (0.46, 0.97); 0.83 (0.64 – 1.07) for studies 064 and 
002, respectively). 
A significant larger reduction in LDL-C cholesterol was found with the treatment of roxadustat versus 
ESA (-0.37 to -0.47 mmol/L) from a baseline level of 2.28 to 2.92 mmol/L. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
NDD pool (non-dialysis dependent pool) 
During the placebo-controlled studies, a large proportion of patients discontinued treatment, which 
was higher for placebo 1115 [59.2%]) than for roxadustat (901 [37.8%]). The reasons for 
discontinuation were not exactly clear as important discontinuation categories could not be further 
detailed (patient decision (10.5% vs 20.7%), development of study-specific discontinuation criteria 
(3.2% vs 13.4%), and withdrawal by the patient (6.0% vs 7.6%)). Further, this could highly impact 
the primary efficacy evaluation in the advantage of roxadustat. Although, when compared to ESA study 
treatment discontinuation was slightly larger for roxadustat than ESA ((74 (22.9%) vs 58 (19.8%)) 
mainly due to unspecified ‘withdrawal by the patient’ (6.8% vs 5.8%). 
The proportion of patients that achieved too high Hb levels (overshooting) was higher for 
roxadustat versus placebo ((in study 1517-CL-0608; > 12 g/dL 23.4% vs 3.65%; > 13 g/dL 5.6% vs 
0.5% ) as well as versus ESA therapy (> 12 g/dL 23.9% vs 20.3%; > 13 g/dL 3.7% vs 2.7%) with an 
increased proportion of patients in need for a dose hold (12.8% vs 0.8% on dose hold due to Hb > 13 
g/dL vs placebo).  
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 140/153  
 
 
 
The clinical meaning of reduction in LDL-C cholesterol is not exactly clear as a counteracting effect 
on the exploratory endpoint of HDL-C was observed (difference of -4.1 mg/dL (-0.11 mmol/L) (-5.0 - -
3.3), p <0.0001) for roxadustat vs placebo from a mean baseline of 47 mg/dL (1.22 mmol/L) and -
0.14 vs -0.005 mmol/L vs ESA) and no improvement in CV benefit has been observed (see safety 
section). 
The effect of roxadustat versus placebo on the improvement of patient-reported outcomes has not 
been clearly demonstrated. Superiority for SF-36 VT (vitality) at week 12 has only been demonstrated 
in study 001 (HR 0.22 (0.15, 2.3) and not in studies 608 and 060 as part of sequential testing (HR 
1.13 (-0.19, 2.4) and 0.44 (-0.1, 0.99)). Further, SF-36 PF (physical function) superiority could not be 
formally tested in any of the studies. Other exploratory endpoints showed some improvement including 
FACT-An Total Score (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia) (mean difference 1.84 (0.56-
3.13, p=0.0048)), and EQ-5D-5L VAS Score (EuroQol Questionnaire-5 Dimensions 5 Levels on a visual 
analogue scale) (mean difference 1.67 (0.73-2.60, p=0.0005)), however, all these endpoints only 
showed numerical improvement when analysed at week 28. When analysed versus ESA, comparable 
improvements in SF-36-PF (difference in mean change -1.28 (-2.4 - -0.1) and SF-36-VT (-0.42 (-1.6 - 
-0.8) were observed. 
No superiority in renal function (eGFR) decline could be observed for roxadustat versus placebo 
(difference 2.53 (0.52, 4.6) in study 060), while differences in annual slope estimations were not 
consistent between studies (0.59, -0.65 and -0.51 ml/min/1.73m2 for the 3 placebo-controlled 
studies). Also, discontinuation due to kidney transplant or dialysis initiation was not in favour of 
roxadustat (24 (1.0%) vs 9 (0.5%) and 23 (1.0%) vs 11 (0.6%), respectively), although data are 
limited and not formally adjudicated as endpoints. An initial stabilisation in eGFR during the first 12 
weeks is observed for roxadustat. 
In line with a somewhat lower frequency of iv iron use, an exploratory evaluation showed that serum 
iron initially decreased from baseline to week 8, subsequently increased to above baseline at week 20 
and remained relatively stable up to week 52 and was generally higher for roxadustat than for placebo 
from baseline to week 52 (9.94 [38.47] µg/L vs 1.54 [35.04] µg/L). A decrease in mean ferritin to 
week 52 was observed (-52.09 [253.43] µg/L vs 14.59 [204.13] µg/L). Any difference in transferrin 
saturation was not observed (0.05 [14.23]% vs 0.30 [12.70]%). Mean transferrin saturation initially 
decreased from baseline to week 8, but then increased to baseline levels and remained stable up to 
week 52. These data may suggest some effect on iron mobilisation with roxadustat. A decrease of 
hepcidin was also seen up to week 24 (LS mean difference: -25.86 µg/L; 95% CI: -33.09, -18.63; 
P < 0.0001), which would comply with the proposed mechanism of action, although the exact clinical 
meaning in terms of iron responsiveness is not clear (Batchelor, JASN, 2020). 
Some differences in effect across subgroups appear in the placebo-controlled studies, although no p 
for interaction has been provided. A lower response appears for white and black vs Asian and others, 
Europe vs the US and others, lower ferritin/TSAT status, baseline CRP > ULN, and higher body weight. 
However, this was not consistent with subgroup analyses for mean level of Hb response where a lower 
effect was found for lower ferritin/TSAT level, Hb > 8, and a trend for lower effect with increasing GFR. 
The effect according to hsCRP level <> ULN was part of the sequential testing in study 060, where the 
effect according to this subgroup appeared comparable to the overall effect. Based on more limited 
data from the active-comparator study, no substantial differences in subgroup analyses could be 
observed.  
DD pool (dialysis dependent pool) 
All 4 studies comparing the treatment of roxadustat with ESA therapy in dialysis patients were open-
label which may be subject to bias in particular to endpoints with treatment management decisions 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 141/153  
 
 
 
(e.g. rescue therapy, iv iron use) and patient-reported outcomes. Further, ESA conversion study 064 
was only performed in the US and maybe less representative for the EU setting. 
For the dialysis patients, more patients discontinued study and treatment for roxadustat than ESA 
treatment (28.3% vs 21.7%; 41.2% vs 32.4%, respectively). This was consistent across the studies, 
except for the Hb correction study 063 (41.2 vs 40.7% treatment discontinuation). Any details for 
reasons for the patient decision and withdrawal by the patient are missing. 
However, the proportion of patients achieving too high Hb levels (overshooting) was higher for 
roxadustat versus ESA (> 12 g/dL, 17.1% vs 10.0%; > 13 g/dL, 1.9% vs 0.78% based on study 
0613). In line with these observations, more patients needed a dose to be withheld due to Hb >13 
mg/dL (23.8% vs 12.8% in patients starting dialysis (ID DD) and 11.7% vs 3.4% in stable dialysis 
patients (DD pool)).  
Regarding the reduction in LDL-C cholesterol, a counteracting effect on the exploratory endpoint of 
HDL-C was observed (difference of -0.10 mmol/L) and no improvement in CV benefit has been 
observed (see safety section). 
No difference (non-inferior) in patient-reported outcomes were observed versus ESA therapy as SF-
36-PF (physical function) (41.7 (10.1) vs 41.7 (9.9) with LS mean difference 0.21 (0.65 – 1.06)) and 
SF-36-VT (vitality) (0.96 (7.7) vs 0.15 (7.9) with LS mean difference 0.86 (-0.12 – 1.8)) were non-
inferior to ESA therapy in study 0613. Although no substantial differences in other studies were found, 
these were only exploratory. 
For the stable DD subpool (for ID DD subpool this was not measured), exploratory evaluation showed a 
decrease in mean ferritin to week 52 (-246.24 [332.82] µg/L roxadustat, -165.97 [386.12] µg/L ESA). 
Any difference in mean transferrin saturation was not observed ((-6.00 [16.88] µg/L 
roxadustat, -5.72 [15.28] µg/L ESA). A decrease of hepcidin was also seen up to week 24. 
Subgroup analyses for the DD pool were presented according to the ID (incident dialysis) DD subpool 
and the stable dialysis DD subpool. In the IDD subpool, no substantial differences appear across 
subgroups for the mean change in Hb from week 28 to 52. For the stable DD subpool, roxadustat 
appears to do slightly better for US vs Europe and others. Further, a lower ferritin/TSAT status showed 
a lower effect for roxadustat vs ESA for mean Hb levels, which may not be expected if roxadustat 
would improve iron availability, however, no p for interaction has been provided. For the baseline 
hsCRP <> ULN, no substantial differences in effect appear. In relation to this, for the sequential testing 
of the endpoint of change from baseline in Hb to weeks 18 - 24 among patients with baseline hs-CRP 
> ULN superiority was demonstrated in the 002 study, while NI was demonstrated in the 063 and 064 
studies. For the endpoint of proportion of responders, no differences appear in de DD pool, although 
confidence intervals were wide (no data for the ID DD pool). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
NDD pool 
The exposure to roxadustat in non-dialysis patients is 2386 patients treated with roxadustat and 
1884 with placebo beyond 52 weeks of treatment (> 52 to 104 weeks (37.0% vs 32.3%), > 104 to 
156 weeks (26.8% vs 18.9%), and > 156 weeks (7.2% vs 2.2%), although roxadustat patients were 
treated substantially longer than placebo due to more patients discontinuing treatment in the placebo 
group (mean 84.6 vs 64.3 weeks). 
More adverse events (IR 222 vs 211), drug-related AEs (IR 8.3 vs 6.6), and serious AEs (IR 45.9 vs 
43.9), occurred for roxadustat than placebo. The longer treatment duration of roxadustat could not 
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 142/153  
 
 
 
entirely explain this due to higher discontinuation in the placebo group (incidence rate 222/100 
patient-years vs 211/100 PY). Also versus ESA, adverse events (85.8 vs 84.6%), drug-related AEs 
(21.7 vs 19.8%), serious AEs (52.9 vs 47.8%), drug related serious AEs (5.3% vs 2.0%) occurred 
consistently higher for roxadustat, although the difference was less outspoken than versus placebo. 
Discontinuations due to AEs in the roxadustat arm were slightly higher than placebo (6.6 vs 4.9%; IR 
3.9 vs 3.8) ESA (5.3 vs 3.1%), although discontinuation due to AEs was relatively limited. 
Adverse events of nausea, deep vein thrombosis, convulsions (seizures), vascular access thrombosis 
(VAS), diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, hyperkalaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, headache, cough, peripheral 
oedema and insomnia are identified as treatment-related AEs. Further, pulmonary embolism (PE) 
events were limited, but slightly increased for roxadustat vs placebo (10 (0.4%) vs 3 (0.2%); IR 0.2 
vs 0.1) and comparable to ESA in the DD pool (13 (0.6%) vs 12 (0.5%); IR 0.3 vs 0.3) and has been 
included as ADR.  
In line with the Hb effects of roxadustat, haematocrit and erythrocytes were increased with 
roxadustat vs placebo (7.27% vs 0.78%; 0.696×1012/L vs 0.078×1012/L) and comparable to ESA 
therapy 6.01% vs 5.60%; 0.590×1012/L vs 0.628×1012/L).  
Hypertension, a known AE associated with ESA therapy, was more observed in the NDD pool (17.9 vs 
12.5% NDD; IR 12.1 vs 10.4) and the NDD comparator study (2.8 vs 2.4%; n= 9 vs 7) while being 
similar versus ESA in the DD pool (19.5 vs 19.4%). However, time to exacerbation of hypertension 
showed a numerically increased risk with roxadustat versus placebo in studies 608 (13.4 vs 12.1 (HR 
1.29 (0.77-1.26)) and 060 (12.3 vs 12.7 (HR 1.16 (0.83-1.62)).  
Infection and infestations were more reported for roxadustat in the NDD and DD pool (52.6 vs 
42.4%; IR 51.3 vs 47.4 NDD; 49.2 vs 49.4%; IR 29.3 vs 26.1 per 100PY DD pool). Also, more serious 
and fatal infections and infestations were reported. Compared to placebo, serious AEs of sepsis (2.4 vs 
0.4%; IR 1.4 vs 0.3) was most pronounced, but was not increased when compared to ESA in the DD 
pool (3.4 vs 3.4%)). However, based on sepsis SQM (serious events), serious sepsis incidence was 
increased (4.6% vs 1.6%; IR 2.8 vs 1.3 NDD pool; IR 7.3% vs 6.7% DD pool). Limited data of 
comparison to ESA in the NDD revealed a lower frequency for sepsis (0.9 vs 2.7%).  
DD pool 
The exposure to roxadustat for the dialysis-dependent population is 2354 patients treated with 
roxadustat versus 2360 with ESA (2197 on epoetin-alfa, 163 on darbepoetin) with treatment beyond 
52 weeks (> 52 to 104 weeks (29.2% vs 30.1%), > 104 to 156 weeks (23.4% vs 26.9%), and > 156 
weeks (12.8% vs 16.3%), although this was slightly shorter for roxadustat than for ESA (mean 87.6 vs 
98.7 weeks). 
Adverse events of nausea, deep vein thrombosis, convulsions (seizures), vascular access thrombosis 
(VAS) diarrhoea, nausea, hyperkalaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, headache, cough, peripheral oedema 
and insomnia are identified as treatment-related AEs. Most frequently observed serious adverse 
events with a clear higher frequency for roxadustat vs ESA (≥ 1%) were arteriovenous fistula 
thrombosis (4.9 vs 3.3%) and deep vein thrombosis (1.2 vs 0.3%).  
CV and mortality risk estimation 
A comparable on-treatment CV and mortality risk estimation (MACE HR 0.79 (0.61, 1.02) and mortality 
HR 0.78 (0.57, 1.05) for OT-7) has been shown for correction of Hb versus ESA pooled study data 
(NDD study 1517-CL-0610  and the DD study FGCL-4592-063, 10% of the patients in DD study FGCL-
4592-064, 20% of the patients in the DD study D5740C00002).  
Assessment Report 
EMA/CHMP/393136/2021 
Page 143/153  
 
 
 
An increased CV and mortality risk has been observed in patients not demonstrating response to 
roxadustat treatment (Hb levels < 10 g/dL over time) and for difficult-to-treat patients treated with 
high doses of ESA (> 7000 IU/week) before converted to roxadustat. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
NDD pool 
Exposure of roxadustat compared to ESA in non-dialysis patients is relatively limited to 525 on 
roxadustat and 423 on ESA therapy (patient exposure years 383 vs 316). 
Evaluation of CV safety based on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) assessment and mortality 
have been pre-specified. An a-priori defined inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) 
on-treatment (OT28; 28 days after treatment discontinuation) method adjusting for informative 
censoring due to treatment discontinuation was used and showed an on-treatment HR of 1.26 (1.02 -
1.55) for MACE (based on 344 (14.4%) vs 166 (8.8%) events; IR/100 PY 8.7 vs 6.8), mainly 
attributed to the largest D5740C0001 study (HR 1.26 (1.03 - 1.56)). Whether this method is able to 
appropriately correct for any residual confounding is uncertain. An ITT approach was set a-priori at 
time of disclosure of the main studies but before unblinding of the adjudicated MACE events and shows 
a HR of 1.10 (0.96 – 1.27) for MACE. However, this method is not preferred due to lower sensitivity, 
because events will be less likely due to the randomised treatment and more likely due to the 
background event rate and subsequent therapies (especially due to the possibility of introducing ESA 
therapy after treatment discontinuation), hence adding noise to the treatment comparison, possibly 
introducing new confounders to the treatment comparison. Mortality was also increased with 
roxadustat vs placebo (10.9% vs 6.5%; IR/100PY 6.4 vs 5.0; HR 1.16 [95% CI: 0.90, 1.51]) during 
treatment (follow-up to 28 days after treatment) and based on ITT data (400 (16.8%) vs 301 
(16.0%); HR: 1.08 [95% CI: 0.93, 1.26] and was primarily increased in the largest study D5740C0001 
(on-treatment HR 1.40 (1.02, 1.91)). The increased number of fatal events occurring with roxadustat 
vs placebo (11.6 vs 5.5%; IR 6.9 vs 5.5) was primarily due to cardiac disorders (2.2 vs 2.0% vs 
placebo (IR 1.3 vs 1.5) and 3.7 vs 3.1% vs ESA) and infections and infestations (3.0 vs 1.0% (IR 1.8 
vs 0.7) and 1.5 vs 2.0% vs ESA). 
DD pool 
Evaluation of CV safety based on major adverse cardiac events (MACE) assessment and mortality 
have been pre-specified in the dialysis patients versus ESA therapy. MACE was increased in the a-priori 
defined OT-7 on-treatment analysis (7 days after last dose; HR of 1.09 (0.95 – 1.26) (371 (15.8%) vs 
398 (16.9%)). The mortality rate was also higher for roxadustat than for ESA therapy (IR of 6.7 vs 
6.2 per 100PY; HR 1.13 [95% CI: 0.95, 1.34]) during treatment (OT-7; follow-up to 7 days after the 
last dose), despite a lower total number of deaths for roxadustat (11.2% vs 11.7%), and some 
heterogeneity across the 4 studies. The increased fatal events occurring with roxadustat vs ESA (15.3 
vs 15.2%) were primarily observed for cardiac disorders (5.0 vs 5.2%; IR 3.0 vs 2.7), general 
disorders and administration site conditions (2.9 vs 2.6%), and infections and infestations (2.8 vs 
2.5%). Individual adverse events were too limited to identify any clear differences. Since ESA already 
has an increased cardiovascular risk compared to placebo, it can be argued that stricter margins than 
suggested in the Reflection Paper on cardiovascular safety should be set when comparing roxadustat to 
ESA. The higher MACE risk with roxadustat treatment appears to be driven by the stable DD subpool 
(HR 1.18 (1.00 – 1.38); 297 (18.6%) vs 301 (18.9%)). This also applies to the mortality risk (HR 1.23 
(1.02-1.49)) and is explained by the fluctuations caused by necessary up- or down-titration of the 
doses of roxadustat study treatment, likely increasing the patient burden and inflicting Hb variability,

Page 144/153  
 
 
 
which could possibly clarify the differences in increased discontinuation for roxadustat (44.7 vs 32.7%) 
and CV and mortality outcomes compared to the stable ESA therapy. 
Other adverse events of arteriovenous fistula thrombosis (9.5 vs 7.5% DD pool) and pyrexia (5.0 vs 
4.8% DD pool) have been reported in a higher frequency for the DD pool as known AEs of ESAs; 
however, any data on this in the NDD pool have not been provided.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Correction and maintaining appropriate haemoglobin levels are considered of clinical relevance 
as this is generally associated with improvement of quality of life due to alleviation of symptoms such 
as fatigue, shortness of breath, insomnia, lethargy, headaches, dizziness, lack of concentration/ 
cognitive functioning, amongst others. Further, Hb correction is believed to result in improvement of 
CV morbidity and overall mortality eventually. Furthermore, the use of RBC transfusion may be 
prevented. 
In non-dialysis patients, anaemia severity increases with more advanced kidney disease but is 
generally less dysregulated than in dialysis patients. Managing correction of anaemia is very 
individualised in these patients, but iron use may be sufficient in a relevant proportion of patients and 
excludes ESA therapy's general need. In this context, roxadustat demonstrates a clear improvement in 
Hb correction versus placebo. One would expect that this would be accompanied by a clear 
improvement in quality of life (QoL) indicators; however, no clear significant improvement in SF-36 
assessment could be formally demonstrated versus placebo (although numerical improvements were 
observed). Due to the clear effect on correction of Hb levels obtained with roxadustat vs placebo, 
patients were less in need for rescue therapy than placebo as demonstrated by the need for blood 
transfusion and IV iron use/or ESA therapy. Any effect on the delay of renal function decline could not 
be shown, but this may be associated with too limited evaluation period to establish any differences on 
this endpoint. A comparable impact on Hb was seen in the study versus ESA therapy, with a 
comparable improvement in QoL, although data are limited compared to the data generated for 
comparison to placebo. 
In dialysis patients, ESA therapy is part of standard therapy in a relevant proportion of patients. 
Roxadustat has shown a comparable effect on Hb correction and maintenance versus ESA therapy. 
This was associated with comparable effects on QoL indicators, although formally assessed in one 
study only and based on an open-label design, thus limiting drawing firm conclusions. A potential 
advantage over ESA therapy could be that some effect of iron mobilisation appears present with 
roxadustat, as patients were less in need for iv iron use for roxadustat compared to ESA. To a certain 
extent, this could lower the risk of rare potentially life-threatening severe allergic reactions associated 
with iv iron use. Although, an appropriate iron status may still be needed for roxadustat to prevent 
hyporesponsiveness (as known with ESAs with inappropriate iron levels), as a diminished efficacy has 
been observed in patients with an inappropriate iron status too. 
Although the current studies were not specifically designed and powered to evaluate a potential 
improvement in morbidity and mortality, these aspects have been addressed in terms of safety, in 
particular as it is known from ESA therapy that too high levels of haemoglobin levels are associated 
with increased risk for mortality and cardiovascular events.  
In the non-dialysis patients, an increased risk has been observed for major adverse cardiac 
events (MACE), and an increased risk appears for mortality for roxadustat versus placebo, which 
compromises/outbalances the observed beneficial hematological effects compared to placebo. 
However, interpretation of these findings is complicated due to possible patient and study design bias 
with large difference in discontinuation as a result, for which it is not clear whether applied analysis 
appropriate correct for or display sufficiently sensitivity to observe the correct roxadustat induced 
signal. Best available data are those as provided by the haemoglobin correction studies which 
randomised roxadustat versus ESA both in non-dialysis and dialysis patients, and display similar 
randomised baseline characteristics and study discontinuation. Overall, these show a comparable MACE

and mortality risk for roxadustat versus ESA therapy. Based on this certainty, it is proposed that 
treatment with roxadustat should be restricted to those patients that would normally qualify for ESA 
therapy.  
In dialysis patients compared to ESA therapy, the observed increase in MACE and mortality risk is 
driven by the conversion to ESA studies, and can likely explained by dysregulation of ESA stabilised 
patients with randomisation to roxadustat, likely causing undesirable variability in haemoglobin levels 
which possibly triggers clinical issues including increased MACE and mortality risk. This increased risk 
as particularly seen in those difficult-to-treat patients who need high ESA dose may support this 
hypothesis. Further, non-responsiveness appears a factor likely associated with increased CV and 
mortality risk. Consequently, such circumstances should appropriately be accounted for in the labelling. 
Further, overshooting (too high levels of Hb) appears not to be an obvious factor to clarify this possible 
risk. Notably, any morbidity and mortality effect for the small reduction in LDL-C cholesterol with 
roxadustat treatment (although associated with a small decrease in HDL-C, which is generally 
considered disadvantages) could not be observed both compared to placebo and ESA therapy. 
Further, an increased tendency of (venous) thrombosis appears to be associated with roxadustat 
treatment based on an increased incidence for adverse events of deep venous thrombosis, vascular 
access thrombosis and likely increased pulmonary embolism (PE) risk, although events are somewhat 
limited. This is most pronounced in the non-dialysis patients compared to placebo but also observed for 
dialysis patients compared to ESA therapy. 
Three times a week of oral administration of roxadustat provides a benefit and convenience over iv 
or sc use of ESA therapy, especially for the non-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients without 
standard (arterio-venous) access, although an increased number of gastro-intestinal events was 
observed with oral administration of roxadustat both when compared to placebo and ESA therapy. 
Nevertheless, this seems not importantly result in tolerability issues as discontinuation due to AEs was 
generally limited. 
In addition to these safety issues, some other typical adverse events observed with ESA could also 
be identified for roxadustat, although not yet all included in the SmPC, which request further 
explanation (e.g. hyperkalemia, hypertension exacerbation). Further, any increased risk for infections 
could not be clearly associated with roxadustat treatment likely also due to increased background risk 
in this type of patients. Further, an increase of statin exposure has been observed with concomitant 
use of roxadustat, although any effect on typical statin-associated adverse effects of myopathy could 
not be identified. These issues have currently been addressed in the labelling. Further, any effect on 
tumour promotion (as potentially observed with ESAs) could potentially be likely for roxadustat as well. 
However, extensive non-clinical data do not suggest such an effect, while any imbalance on tumour 
adverse effects during the main clinical studies has not been observed.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Correction and maintenance of appropriate haemoglobin levels with (convenient) oral roxadustat have 
shown to be better versus standard of care in non-dialysis patients and comparable to what can be 
achieved with sc or iv ESA in non-dialysis and dialysis patients. This is of clinical relevance. Most 
notably, this resulted in a comparable improvement in the quality of life when compared to ESA 
therapy; however, an improvement in QoL appears somewhat unclear when compared to placebo in 
non-dialysis patients. However, this laboratory and (likely) symptomatic improvement accompanied by 
some suggestion of improved iron mobilisation with roxadustat in anaemic CKD patients does only 
outweigh the possible safety risk for those patients for whom the CV and mortality risk is sufficiently 
understood; meaning those patients that would normally qualify for ESA therapy as the risk could be 
estimated with sufficient confidence and the benefit of ESA therapy outweighs the potential risk.

Accordingly, this should have clear restriction implications for the indication of non-dialysis patients 
with CKD associated anaemia. Further, several contributing factors have been identified that may 
impose this risk, including non-responsiveness and converting stable ESA treated dialysis patients; 
especially those who are already difficult to treat.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Evrenzo is favourable in the following indication: 
Evrenzo is indicated for treatment of adult patients with symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic 
kidney disease (CKD). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that roxadustat is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union.

Summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Odomzo 
(sonidegib) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Odomzo, which details the measures to be 
taken in order to ensure that Odomzo is used as safely as possible. For more information on RMP 
summaries, see here. 
This RMP summary should be read in conjunction with the EPAR summary and the product information 
for Odomzo, which can be found on Odomzo’s EPAR page. 
Overview of disease epidemiology 
Odomzo (sonidegib) is a cancer medicine used to treat adults with basal cell carcinoma (a type of skin 
cancer). Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer but the number of people who 
get the cancer varies greatly between countries; during one year, as many as 1,800 people in 100,000 
are expected to get basal cell carcinoma in Australia and as few as 77 people in 100,000 are expected 
to get it in Malta. The number of people who get the disease increases with age but basal cell 
carcinoma also occurs in young people. Basal cell carcinoma which has spread nearby (locally 
advanced basal cell carcinoma) may represent between 1 and 10 cases out of every 100 patients with 
the cancer. In 3 to 500 cases in every 100,000 patients with basal cell carcinoma, the cancer may 
have spread to other parts of the body (metastatic disease). About 5 out of 10 million women and 8 
out of 10 million men are likely to die from basal cell carcinoma, most of whom will be over 65 years of 
age. The main factor that increases the risk of basal cell carcinoma is exposure to sun. The cancer 
usually grows slowly. 
Summary of treatment benefits 
Odomzo is used to treat adults with basal cell carcinoma which has spread nearby (locally advanced) 
and cannot be treated with surgery or radiation. It is available in capsules, each containing 200 mg 
sonidegib. 
Odomzo was studied in one main study involving 230 patients with basal cell carcinoma which was 
either locally advanced or metastatic (spread to other parts of the body). Patients were started on two 
different doses of Odomzo: 200 or 800 mg once a day. The main measure of effectiveness was the 
response to treatment, based on a reduction in tumour size and improvement in other signs of cancer; 
treatment was considered sufficiently effective if the response rate was at least 30%. 
Unknowns relating to treatment benefits 
The main study enrolled adults with basal cell carcinoma, nearly all of whom were Caucasians. The 
effects and tolerability of Odomzo in other races and in patients with other types of cancer have not 
been established, and are being investigated. Safety and efficacy of Odomzo in children and 
adolescents aged below 18 years have not been established.

Because many medicines are present in 
milk, and because of the potential for 
serious side effects in breastfed babies, 
women must not breastfeed while taking 
Odomzo or for 20 months after ending 
treatment.

Important potential risks 
Risk 
What is known  
Reduced ability to have children 
Based on findings from animal studies, Odomzo may 
(impaired fertility) 
permanently affect the ability of men and women to have 
children. 
New cancers in different sites 
Patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma have an increased 
(second primary malignancies) 
risk of developing a different type of skin cancer called 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Cases of cutaneous 
squamous cell carcinoma have been reported in patients with 
advanced basal cell carcinoma treated with Odomzo. It has not 
been determined whether cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is 
related to sonidegib treatment. 
Post-natal developmental defects 
Based on findings from animal studies, abnormal tooth and bone 
development is likely in infants and children exposed to 
Odomzo. 
Fractures 
Given Odomzo’s effect on growing bone, the risk of fracture is 
highest in children and adolescents. The effect of Odomzo on 
mature bones is not known; fractures are not likely in adult 
cancer patients because their bones are no longer developing. 
Effects of Odomzo on certain

Odomzo may also raise the levels of certain drugs that are 
transported in and out of cells by the protein BCRP, whose 
function is reduced by Odomzo.

Summary of risk minimisation measures by safety concern 
All medicines have a summary of product characteristics (SmPC) which provides doctors, pharmacists 
and other healthcare professionals with details on how to use the medicine, and also describes the 
risks and recommendations for minimising them. Information for patients is available in plain language 
in the package leaflet. The measures listed in these documents are known as ‘routine risk minimisation 
measures’. 
The SmPC and the package leaflet are part of the medicine’s product information. The product 
information for Odomzo can be found on Odomzo’s EPAR page. 
This medicine has special conditions and restrictions for its safe and effective use (additional risk 
minimisation measures). Full details on these conditions and the key elements of any educational 
material can be found in Annex II of the product information which is published on Odomzo’s EPAR 
page; how they are implemented in each country however will depend upon agreement between the 
marketing authorisation holder and the national authorities. 
These additional risk minimisation measures are for the following risks: 
Harm to the unborn baby (teratogenicity) and effect of ability to have children (impaired 
fertility)

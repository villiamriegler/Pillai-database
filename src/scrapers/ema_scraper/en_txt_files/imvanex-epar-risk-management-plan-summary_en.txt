MODIFIED VACCINIA ANKARA-BAVARIAN NORDIC 
(MVA-BN®) (LIVE ATTENUATED, NON-
REPLICATING)) 
RMP version to be assessed as part of this application: 
Data lock point for this RMP 
31-Jul-2022 
Version number 
9.3 
Date of final sign off 
06-Mar-2023 
Rationale for submitting an updated RMP:  
Considering the mpox outbreak in May 2022 and based on currently available safety information 
the indication of IMVANEX in EU is extended to include mpox and disease caused by vaccinia 
virus in adults in an accelerated procedure and approved on 22-Jul-2022. This version 
implements the PRAC recommendations received as part of the procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002596/II/0076.  
Summary of significant changes in this RMP:  
1.  Indication extension to include mpox and disease caused by vaccinia virus in adults 
2.  Children and adolescents (<18 years) removed from the safety specification as this 
subpopulation is not included in the targeted indication 
3.  The term ‘safety experience in a mass vaccination due to a smallpox outbreak’ removed 
from the safety specification 
4.  Section SVI.2 Potential for medication errors deleted since requirement from superseded 
RMP template guidance. Safety concern “incorrect route of drug administration” deleted 
thus as well

5.  Complete re-structuring of Part III.1 Routine Pharmacovigilance activities to comply to 
latest guidance” Core requirement for RMPs of COVID-19 vaccines” and other RMPs of 
authorised COVID-19 vaccines to align activities as much as possible 
6.  Addition of additional Pharmacovigilance activity: non-BN sponsored clinical study 
SEMVAc  
7.   Deletion of paediatric study POX-MVA-035. Paediatric studies are included in the 
Paediatric Investigation Plan of IMVANEX (EMEA-001161-PIP02-11) and are therefore 
removed from this RMP

IMVANEX® (MVA-BN®) 
Centralised 
Chemical class: Other viral vaccines (J07BX) 
Summary of mode of action: IMVANEX is a live viral vaccine 
produced from the strain Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian 
Nordic (MVA-BN), a highly attenuated orthopox virus. MVA-
BN is grown in chicken embryo fibroblast cells, harvested, 
purified and suspended in a Tris buffer (10 mM Tris, 140 mM 
NaCl, pH 7.7). The vaccine contains trace amounts of host cell 
DNA, protein, benzonase® and, the antibiotics gentamicin and 
ciprofloxacin. No preservative or adjuvant is added to the 
formulation. 
Important information about its composition: 
The vaccine is filled with a nominal virus titer of 1x108 
Inf.U/dose. One standard dose (0.5 mL) of the MVA-BN liquid 
frozen smallpox and mpox vaccine contains at least 0.5x108 
Inf.U/0.5 mL dose throughout its shelf life.

Information 
Indication(s) in the EEA 
In 2017, the MVA-BN potency assay changed from a TCID50 
based assay to a flow cytometry based assay, and the units 
changed from TCID50 to infectious units (Inf.U) (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002596/II/0027, positive opinion 14-Sep-2017 
EMA/CHMP/605563/2017). It should be emphasized that 
although the method of the potency assay changed from TCID50 
to flow cytometry and the unit changed from TCID50 to Inf.U, 
the conversion factor was 1:1, therefore the established limits 
and specifications remain unchanged. 
The non-replicating smallpox vaccine was developed by BN for 
active immunisation for the prevention of smallpox virus 
infections and protection against smallpox disease in adults ≥18 
years including persons with atopic dermatitis (AD) or allergic 
rhinitis (AR) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
infected individuals (CD4 ≥ 100 cells/µL). 
Each 0.5 ml dose of vaccine is supplied as a liquid frozen 
suspension in a 2-ml type I glass vial for subcutaneous use. 
A primary vaccination series consists of 2 doses of no less 
than 5 x 107 Inf.U IMVANEX, each dose administered 4 
weeks apart via the subcutaneous (SC) route in vaccinia-naïve 
subjects, and a single booster dose of no less than 5 x 107 
Inf.U IMVANEX administered via the SC route in vaccinia 
and IMVANEX experienced subjects.

PART II SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
PART II: MODULE SI EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) AND 
TARGET POPULATION(S) 
The indication for IMVANEX is active immunisation against smallpox, mpox and disease caused 
by vaccinia virus in adults.  
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
Incidence, Prevalence, Demographics of the population in the approved indication: 
The target population of IMVANEX is considered identical with the general population. In 
addition, due to the non-replicating properties, IMVANEX is expected to be used in individuals not 
eligible for vaccination with replicating smallpox vaccines like immunocompromised individuals 
and individuals with atopic dermatitis.

Natural history of smallpox, mpox and related orthopox, including vaccinia virus, in the 
untreated population and treatment options 
Smallpox is caused by variola virus, an orthopoxvirus of the poxviridae family. Variola virus 
occurred in two variants: variola major, leading to the classical smallpox disease with a case 
fatality rate of 30–40%; and variola minor (alastrim) observed in the late phase of the smallpox era, 
leading to a less severe form with a case fatality rate of 1–2% (Fenner, 1988). Variola virus infects 
only humans, does not persist in humans and has no animal reservoir. It is transmitted from person-
to-person, mainly via the respiratory route.

Last Revision: 06-Mar-2023 
Following an incubation period of approximately 12 to 14 days, early symptoms are characterized 
by sudden onset of fever, malaise, headache, backache and prostration. Two to 3 days later, the 
fever drops and a maculopapular rash with deeply embedded lesions appear on the mucosa of the 
mouth and on the face, hands and forearms, eventually progressing to the trunk, legs and feet in a 
centrifugal distribution pattern. The lesions appear in crops and progress to vesicular and pustular 
stages. Eight to 14 days after the onset of rash, scabs form, which can eventually lead to 
depressed, depigmented, pitted scars. Typical complications of smallpox are bacterial co-
infections, keratitis with consecutive blindness, encephalitis, as well as spontaneous abortion and 
stillbirth in pregnant women. As such, smallpox is a serious disease associated with morbidity 
that has substantial impact on day to- day functioning and high likelihood to result in death or 
permanent disability. 
A summary of the various forms of smallpox disease in humans is provided in Table 8.

Mpox is a viral zoonosis caused by the mypox virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus family. It was 
first identified in 1958 and the first cases of human mpox were reported in the 1970s in the Central 
African region. Mpox has since then been observed repeatedly in humans throughout Sub-saharan 
Africa, including West Africa and Central Africa (McCollum, 2014) The incidence of human mpox 
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) seems to be rising following the cessation of 
smallpox vaccination campaigns. In endemic countries incidences of human mpox virus infections 
in pediatric age groups are higher than in adult age groups (Rimoin, 2010) which might correlate 
with the lack of smallpox vaccine coverage as compared to older populations. However, in the last 
decades, the age of human mpox cases has gradually increased, probably in part due to growing 
proportions of the population without vaccination coverage (Bunge, 2022)

Since the first documentation of the large Nigerian mpox outbreak in 2017, cases exported to 
Western World countries were observed in 2018 in the UK and Israel, then again 2019 in the UK 
and Singapore (Mauldin, 2022) In 2020, no exported cases were reported, possibly due to COVID-
19 related travel restrictions. With only limited resumption of international travel, new cases were 
observed in 2021 in the US and the UK (Hobson, 2021); (Rao, 2022) In the long-term perspective, 
Nigeria’s working age population will be more than doubling to >240 million people by 2050, 
according to World Bank estimates, leading to advocacy for Nigeria to be part of the Global Skill 
Partnership program, which would support legal labor migration of Nigerians to Western World 
countries over the next decades (Adhikari, 2019). International long-distance travel to and from 
West and Central Africa is therefore projected to rise sharply over the next decades. At the same 
time, due to further waning of population immunity over time and population growth globally, 
disease modelling suggested (even before the current outbreak) that human mpox may soon reach 
pandemic potential, with a basic reproduction number above 1 when the proportion of 
unvaccinated individuals in a population falls below approx. 30% (Grant, 2020) 
Since May-2022, a multi-country outbreak of human mypox in a large number of previously non-
endemic countries is going on, with yet unknown perspectives about the further course (Saxena, 
2022). Results from a mathematical model, posted prior to peer review, suggest (based on still 
weak assumptions) that a very small number of sexually associated transmissions among the MSM 
(Men who have Sex with Men)  population are sufficient to cause a large outbreak over the MSM 
sexual network. All scenarios projected that, without interventions or changes to sexual behaviour, 
a major outbreak in the MSM population (defined as ≥ 10,000 cases excluding initial cases) is 
highly likely given the current outbreak size. In contrast, sustained transmission in the non-MSM 
population is unlikely in all scenarios considered due to the less heavy tail of the corresponding 
partnership distribution, although from 10 up to 10,000 additional cases may be observed if a 
substantial number of infections are introduced into the non-MSM sexual contact network (Endo, 
2022). A recent guidance document published by WHO recommends use of smallpox vaccines in 
the context of the mpox outbreak dependent on individual risk assessment in both, pre- and post-
exposure prophylaxis scenarios (WHO, 2022). 
In laboratories working with replicating orthopoxviruses such as vaccinia, accidental exposure of 
laboratory personnel is an occupational health risk. Cases of needlestick injuries or similar 
accidents leading to local infections with replicating vaccinia have repeatedly been reported 
((Campe, 2009)Whitehouse, 2019, Isaacs, 2019, Sennayake, 2009, Hsu, 2015, Wei, 2013, 
Mousstaché, 2003). 
In addition, there are rare case reports of other orthopoxvirus transmissions, such as human cowpox 
infections, mostly from pet rodents or cats of questionable origin (Campe, 2009, Eder, 2015). A

previous smallpox vaccination decades ago was shown to lead to a milder clinical course in one of 
the reported cases. 
Furthermore, the recently published de novo synthesis of horsepox virus may have direct 
implications for biosecurity by facilitating potential synthesis of other orthopox viruses, including 
variola, increasing the risk for emergence of new orthopoxvirus diseases (Koblentz, 2017, Noyce, 
2018). 
In summary, there is a medical need for vaccines protective across the whole orthopoxvirus 
spectrum. The cross-protectivity of orthopoxvirus vaccines has been first described by Edward 
Jenner in 1798 and was the basis for the successful smallpox eradication campaign.  
In the EU, no other prophylactic vaccines are specifically licensed for mpox or other orthopoxvirus 
infections. IMVANEX is currently approved in the EU for prevention of smallpox, mpox and 
disease caused by vaccinia in adults. In the US, it is approved under the tradename JYNNEOS for 
prevention of mpox. In Canada it is approved under the tradename IMVAMUNE, the approval 
includes the indications against mpox and related orthopoxviruses. 
Symptomatic treatment of orthopoxvirus infections includes close supervision of the patient and 
fluid replacement. Antibiotics are restricted to patients with bacterial superinfection. Available 
therapies for smallpox (and other orthopox) include the approved TPOXX (tecovirimat developed 
by SIGA Technologies Inc.) and the antiviral agent cidofovir (Gilead Sciences, Inc), as well as the 
potential use of CNJ-016 (Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous [Human]; Cangene Corporation) 
and of the (currently) investigational antiviral agent brincidofovir (Chimerix, Inc.).  
Historically, as a passive immunization method, intravenous vaccinia immunoglobulin (IVIG) 
produced from sera of recently vaccinated individuals was available to treat complications of 
replicating vaccinia vaccinations, such as generalized spread of vaccinia.

PART II: MODULE SII  NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION 
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage: 
SII.1 Toxicity 
  Key issues identified from acute or repeated-dose toxicity studies  
IMVANEX has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in a toxicity programme conducted in 
rats and rabbits, investigating acute and repeated dose toxicity, local tolerance, as well as 
reproduction toxicity with segment II (teratology) and segment III (peri- and postnatal toxicity) 
studies. Moreover, a bio-distribution study supports the in-vitro finding that IMVANEX is 
replication deficient (Suter, 2009), since it only remained detectable for the first few days post 
administration. 
Taken together, all preclinical studies show a good safety profile following up to four 
administrations via various routes (intramuscular [IM] or subcutaneously [SC]) at doses as high 
as 4.9 x 108 TCID50: 
-  No mortality or clinical signs indicative of systemic toxicity were observed at dose 
levels up to 4.9 x 108 TCID50 of IMVANEX.
-  Repeated administrations (SC and IM) of IMVANEX resulted in injection site irritations 
and some lymphoid changes in both rats and rabbits. However, these effects were minimal 
and reversible and are therefore not considered to be dose-limiting. 
-  In  developmental  toxicity  studies  IMVANEX  (up  to  1  x  108  TCID50)  neither  induced  a 
teratogenic effect nor caused intrauterine toxicity to conceptuses. 
-  IMVANEX  did  not  have  any  adverse  effect  on  dams  or  the  intrauterine  development  of 
embryos.  Furthermore,  it  did  not  have  any  effect  on  lactating  females  or  their  developing 
offspring. 
In addition, the following results on immunogenicity and efficacy were collected in the 
toxicity programme:

-  Vaccination  with  IMVANEX  via  SC  and  IM  routes  resulted  in  a  dose  related  immune 
response to vaccinia in rats and rabbits. 
-  Vaccination with IMVANEX yielded a robust, dose dependent antibody response in 
dams and conferred passive immunity to their litters. 
- 
IMVANEX has also been shown to induce an efficacy comparable to replicating 
smallpox vaccines in relevant mouse and non-human primate models. Since results 
of the reproductive toxicity and bio-distribution studies are of particular interest 
for this product, details of these studies are provided below.

  Reproductive/developmental toxicity 
Four reproductive studies on embryo-fetal toxicity were performed in two species, rat and 
rabbits, and included segment II and III studies. The same dose levels, 1 x 107 and 1 x 108 
TCID50 IMVANEX, were applied in all three reproductive toxicity studies. 
1 x 108 TCID50 IMVANEX is also the maximum human dose; the route of administration, SC, 
mimics the clinical route of administration. 
The following treatment schedules aimed at maximizing exposure of the developing fetus to the 
vaccine and to the immune response induced. As for other vaccines, the priming dose was applied 
prior to mating, and additional doses were applied during the period of gestation; in detail: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Segment II – rat: two vaccinations, Day –14, and Day 0; (day 0: day of sperm positivity) 
Segment II – rabbit: three vaccinations, Day –14, Day 0, and Day 14; 
Segment III – rat: two vaccinations, Day –14, and Day 0; 
Segment II – rat: two vaccinations, Day 0 and Day 6; 
In these studies, traditionally used endpoints were chosen to evaluate the potential for 
developmental effects. IMVANEX had no adverse effects on gestation, lactation or maternal 
behaviour in female dams nor on the behavioural/functional development of the offspring (F1 
generation) of treated female rats and rabbits. 
No adverse effects on embryo-fetal development were observed when dosing IMVANEX 14 days 
prior to the day of sperm positivity (Day –14), on the day of sperm positivity (Day 0) and on 
gestation day 6 in rats and at 14 days prior to the day of sperm positivity (Day –14), on the day of 
sperm positivity (gestation Day 0), and on gestation Day 14 of rabbit pregnancy. 
As the same dose level and treatment frequency was used in the rat segment II and III studies, 
reference regarding embryo-fetal exposure to MVA-specific antibodies during organogenesis 
between the two studies seems justified and the data confirm the presence of MVA-specific 
antibodies in milk and fetal serum up to day 28 post partum. 
Altogether, the results (further supported by immune response data collected as part of the 
repeated dose studies) confirm these species as relevant animal model for toxicity testing and 
confirm that dams were exposed to the immune response, which is the active principle of the 
vaccine, during organogenesis of the embryos. 
Direct exposure to the test item, the vaccine antigen, was addressed in the peri-/postnatal study.

In this study follow up of the pups from birth to day 28 post partum was performed to assess 
normal growth, nursing activity, body weight gain, and viability, and developmental landmarks 
(surface-righting reflex, pinna detachment, incisors’ eruption, and eye opening), which are 
considered the best currently available indicators for normal development. Pups were further 
subjected to necropsy, and gross pathology investigations on the presence of any 
abnormalities/malformations. These parameters did not reveal vaccine-induced adverse effects in 
either pregnant or lactating animals, embryo or fetal development, or development of offspring. 
In addition, all components of the formulation are well known and direct embryotoxic effects of 
any excipient of the vaccine formulation can be excluded; the formulation does not contain any 
adjuvant.

* at terminal sacrifice, the right atrium of the heart of the high dosed male (number 52 in study M254-03) was discoloured 
pink and the left atrium was pale; microscopic findings of myofiber degeneration and inflammation were observed in this 
tissue. The spleen of the same animal was described as slightly small at necropsy, but there were no correlative 
microscopic findings in this tissue. 
The table above shows a very low frequency of findings, supporting the conclusion that cardiac 
findings in animal number 52 in study M254-03 are considered a spontaneous background finding 
in rabbits. 
However, to reduce any potential safety risk, heart sections of this study were re-examined by two 
histopathologists (control and high dosed groups): This re-examination followed the specific intent 
of recording any observations, including those that were so slight and that were considered normal 
in the initial evaluation. Although additional observations were made noting tissue inflammation, 
the severity and distribution in the tissues examined were minimal. There were no modifications to 
the initial interpretation of clinical histopathology findings for this study: Both histopathologists 
came to the conclusion, that these minor findings in the heart sections were sporadic and are 
therefore not attributed to the vaccinia vaccination. They also did not find any positive correlation 
between the cardiac findings and inflammation response at the injection site, or any other 
pathological correlate.

In conclusion, with respect to the usage of the vaccine the findings in animal toxicology studies do 
not suggest any risk for cardiotoxicity to humans following SC vaccination with IMVANEX. 
SII.3 Safety concerns that have not been adequately addressed by clinical data 
or which are of unknown significance 
There are no safety concerns from nonclinical studies. 
Bavarian Nordic (BN) had agreed to conduct an additional Segment II study in rats as a post-
authorisation commitment. The study followed the Note for guidance on the development of 
vaccinia virus-based vaccines against smallpox (CPMP/1100/02), as suggested, with the exception 
that instead of a single intradermal vaccination, two doses of 1x108 TCID50 of IMVANEX were 
administered subcutaneously. The first immunisation occurred on the day of conception (sperm 
positivity) and the second immunisation was performed 6 days after conception with the aim to 
target the first trimester of pregnancy.

SII.4 Conclusions on non-clinical data 
Reproduction and developmental toxicity studies did not reveal vaccine-induced adverse effects in 
either pregnant or lactating animals, embryo or fetal development, or development of offspring. 
In conclusion, with respect to the usage of the vaccine the findings in animal toxicology studies do 
not suggest any risk for cardiotoxicity to humans following SC vaccination with IMVANEX.  
However, given that myo-/pericarditis is a known adverse drug reaction to replicating smallpox 
vaccines, it will be considered an important potential risk. 
There are no safety concerns from non-clinical studies that have been confirmed by clinical data, 
have not been adequately refuted by clinical data, which are of unknown significance, or which 
need to be analysed further. 
There are no safety concerns from nonclinical studies.

PART II: MODULE SIII  CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
 SIII.1 Brief overview of development 
The original, replicating smallpox vaccines were based on a number of different VV strains, e.g. the 
Lister-Elstree strain used primarily in Europe or the Dryvax® New York City Board of Health 
(NYCBH) strain used in the United States (US) and in Canada. These first-generation vaccines 
were produced using outdated production methods (i.e. growing the virus on the skin of calves prior 
to harvest and lyophilisation), which would not comply with today’s current Good Manufacturing 
Practice (cGMP) requirements. Remaining lots of Dryvax expired in 2008.

Last Revision: 06-Mar-2023 
In the US, Dryvax has been replaced by ACAM2000® a replicating smallpox vaccine based on the 
Dryvax NYCBH strain and manufactured in cell cultures according to cGMP standards. 
ACAM2000 is indicated for active immunisation against smallpox disease for persons determined 
to be at risk for smallpox infection and is not commercially available to the public. Although 
replicating smallpox vaccines proved to be highly effective immunising agents making the 
eradication of smallpox possible, they also show considerable side effects. Due to the formation of a 
virus filled pustule and replication of the VV they can cause severe and even life-threatening 
complications, particularly in people with immune deficiencies and skin disorders. Furthermore, in 
clinical trials an unexpected high frequency of myo-/pericarditis was observed for Dryvax and 
ACAM2000 (incidence of 10.38 events/thousand and 5.73 events/thousand, respectively). 
Bavarian Nordic (BN) has developed a non-replicating vaccine which represents a safer alternative 
to the first- and second-generation smallpox vaccines.  
BN’s non-replicating vaccine against smallpox , mpox and disease caused by vaccinia , IMVANEX, 
is prepared from the Modified Vaccinia Ankara – Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN) strain, which is a 
highly attenuated orthopox virus strain, propagated in Chicken Embryo Fibroblast (CEF) cells. 
The non-replicating vaccine against smallpox , mpox and disease caused by vaccinia, was 
developed by BN for active immunisation for the prevention of smallpox virus infections and 
protection against smallpox disease in adults ≥18 years including persons with atopic dermatitis 
(AD) or allergic rhinitis (AR) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected individuals 
(CD4+ ≥ 100 cells/µL). 
A primary vaccination series consists of 2 doses of no less than 5 x 107 Inf.U IMVANEX each dose 
administered 4 weeks apart via the subcutaneous (SC) route in vaccinia-naïve subjects, and a single 
booster dose of no less than 5 x 107 Inf.U IMVANEX administered via the SC route in vaccinia- 
and IMVANEX-experienced subjects. 
IMVANEX was centrally authorised in July 2013. At present, one pharmaceutical form is 
authorised. 
SIII.2 Clinical trial exposure 
BN has collected data of 26 completed clinical trials (17 sponsored by BN, 9 non-BN sponsored) 
evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of IMVANEX in both healthy subjects and special 
populations with contraindications to replicating smallpox vaccines; namely individuals diagnosed 
with atopic dermatitis or infected with HIV.

and two modes of delivery (POX-MVA-036). 
  POX-MVA-037, a randomized, open-label phase 2 trial to assess the safety and 
immunogenicity of MVA-BN smallpox vaccine when increasing the number of injections 
compared to the standard regimen in immunocompromised subjects with HIV infection. 
  POX-MVA-031, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 3 trial to evaluate 
the immunogenicity and safety of three consecutive production lots of a freeze-dried 
formulation of MVA-BN smallpox vaccine in healthy, vaccinia-naïve subjects. 
  POX-MVA-03X, a BN sponsored Special Access Program providing prophylactic 
vaccination with MVA-BN for personnel working directly with or in the vicinity of 
replicating vaccinia virus (included 22 male and female volunteers, aged 18 to 65). 
  Public Health England (PHE) introduced an observational surveillance type of study 
named “A Cohort Study of serological responses to MVA-BN Smallpox Vaccine 
(IMVANEX) Administered During a Monkeypox Outbreak in the UK” with a planned 
number of 120 participants. 
  MVA-BN has been used as a control arm in HIV infected subjects in two phase 1/2 trials 
evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of two recombinant MVA-based vaccines. One 
trial (HIV-NEF-004) compared MVA-BN to a recombinant MVA-based vaccine encoding 
the nef gene from HIV (MVA-Nef), while a second trial (HIV-POL-002) compared MVA-
BN to a recombinant MVA-vaccine encoding multiple T cell epitopes from various HIV 
genes (MVA-HIV polytope). 
  MVA-BN has been administered in the control arm of healthy subjects in a phase 1 double-
blind, placebo-controlled study (NIH sponsored) to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity 
of a recombinant MVA-BN yellow fever vaccine candidate (MVA-BN-YF), with and 
without the montanide ISA 720 adjuvant, using different immunization schedules. 
  A non-BN-sponsored clinical trial, the open label phase 0 study titled “A Study Exploring 
the Use of Vaccine and Antigen Challenges for Immune Monitoring in Healthy 
Participants” sponsored by Janssen Research & Development LLC. This study investigated 
immune status changes provoked by several interventions, including administration of 
IMVANEX. 
In total, the number of subjects having received the final dose of no less than 5 x 107 TCID50 of 
IMVANEX in the context of clinical trials, as per recommended schedule (2 doses of no less than 
5 x 107 TCID50 4 weeks apart in vaccinia-naïve subjects; 1 single dose of no less than 5 x 107 
TCID50 in vaccinia-experienced subjects) is 7490. Five of the BN sponsored clinical trials 
included at-risk populations for which replicating smallpox vaccines such as Dryvax and

ACAM2000 are contraindicated, e.g. individuals with atopic dermatitis or HIV infected subjects. 
Current clinical experience until the DLP of the RMP covers a total of N=9116 in completed trials 
and other studies with IMVANEX (including 152 vaccinees that were included twice, as having 
been part of studies POX-MVA-005 and POX-MVA-023); N=8992 in completed clinical trials. 
No trends for unexpected and/or serious adverse reactions were detected and no difference in the 
safety profile has been observed between vaccinia-naïve and vaccinia-experienced subjects 
receiving IMVANEX. The safe administration of IMVANEX in the general population (18-55 
years of age) is further substantiated by safety data from immunocompromised populations that 
have contraindications for receiving conventional smallpox vaccines, e.g. individuals with HIV or 
AD. The available data in these subjects as well as in healthy individuals revealed no special risks 
or safety concerns following IMVANEX administration (reviewed in Kennedy, 2009; Jones, 
2008). In addition, safe administration of IMVANEX has also been demonstrated in the elderly 
population 56-80 years of age (total of 120 vaccinees). Based on currently available clinical data, 
vaccination with IMVANEX is safe and well tolerated. The majority of adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) are related to local, injection-site reactions of mild to moderate intensity, which were 
completely reversible within days.

Pregnant women 
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy 
outcomes) from the use of IMVANEX in pregnant women. Animal 
studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with 
respect to reproductive toxicity. As a precautionary measure, it is 
preferable to avoid the use of IMVANEX during pregnancy unless 
the benefits of immunisation outweigh the risks of infection with 
Vaccinia or Variola virus. 
Breastfeeding women 
It is not known whether IMVANEX is excreted in human milk. 
IMVANEX should not be used during breastfeeding unless the 
benefits of immunisation outweigh the risks of infection with

Patients with relevant 
comorbidities: 
 
Immunocompromised 
patients 
Immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV infected, patients under 
immunosuppressive therapy) who have been previously vaccinated 
against smallpox should receive two booster doses. The second 
booster vaccination should be given no less than 28 days after the 
first dose. 
Population with relevant 
different ethnic origin 
Data have been generated in HIV infected individuals with CD4 
counts ≥100 cells/µl and ≤750 cells/µl. Lower immune response 
data have been observed in HIV infected individuals compared to 
healthy individuals (see section 5.1). There are no data on the 
immune response to IMVANEX in other immunosuppressed 
individuals. 
No effect of different racial/ethnic origin is expected on the effect of 
a vaccine. These parameters are more relevant for the drug 
metabolism of drugs that are repeatedly administered, rather than 
for the one or two times administration of IMVANEX. 
Subpopulations carrying 
relevant genetic polymorphisms 
Not included in the clinical development program 
No effect of genetic polymorphisms is expected on the effect of a 
vaccine. These parameters are more relevant for the drug 
metabolism of drugs that are repeatedly administered, rather than

Exposure 
Other 
Population with atopic disease 
(atopic dermatitis, atopic 
rhinitis) 
Individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD) developed more local 
and general symptoms after vaccination. 
In a non-placebo controlled clinical trial that compared the safety 
of IMVANEX in individuals with AD to healthy individuals, 
individuals with AD reported erythema (61.2%) and swelling 
(52.2%) at the injection site with a higher frequency than healthy 
individuals (49.3% and 40.8%, respectively). The following 
general symptoms were reported more frequently in individuals 
with AD compared to healthy individuals: headache (33.1% vs. 
24.8%), myalgia (31.8% vs. 22.3%), chills (10.7% vs. 3.8 %), 
nausea (11.9% vs. 6.8%), and fatigue (21.4% vs. 14.4%). 7% of 
the individuals with AD in clinical trials with IMVANEX 
experienced a flare-up or worsening of their skin condition during 
the course of the trial. 
The trial revealed no particular safety concerns for IMVANEX 
in subjects with atopic dermatitis (history or active). 
Furthermore, no indication or trend could be detected that 
vaccination with MVA-BN worsened the intensity of AD. 
Conclusions on populations not studied and other limitations of clinical trial development 
programme 
The target population for IMVANEX divides into four subgroups: 
-  General population at risk of smallpox, mpox or vaccinia virus infection, 
-  first-line responders (medical personnel, civil defence) in case of 
(imminent) smallpox outbreak (emergency situation), 
-  military personnel pre-deployment, and 
-  laboratory personnel potentially exposed to vaccinia or other orthopox 
viruses. 
Military personnel are generally required to be in good health status for deployment, whereas 
personnel with occupational exposure to infectious agents are at least required to be free of 
serious diseases, potentially afflicting their immune system or potentially aggravating after 
accidental contact with infectious agents. 
Pregnancy and breastfeeding can be excluded for pre-deployment military personnel. With 
regard to laboratory personnel, vaccination can be scheduled adequately, as pregnant and

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
breastfeeding women should not be exposed to vaccinia and other orthopox viruses at all and 
therefore do not require vaccination. 
With regard to the general population and first-line responders, this limitation is not considered 
relevant in case of an imminent or actual smallpox, mpox or vaccinia virus outbreak, compared 
to the risk of the diseases themselves.

SV.1.2 
Exposure 
Projected post-authorisation usage data 
Following authorisation in the EU, ,UK, Canada and the US, IMVANEX (also marketed as 
IMVAMUNE or JYNNEOS) was either intended for  
-  Stockpiling at Government and military facilities and for limited distribution for 
vaccination of laboratory personnel. Pre-deployment vaccination of military personnel and 
first-line responders is foreseen. In the event of a deliberate release of smallpox, vaccination of 
the general population (including immunocompromised subjects such as HIV individuals and 
subjects with AD) is also foreseen.  
-  Pre-deployment vaccination is not applicable to the general population. Laboratory 
personnel with potential exposure to vaccinia and poxviruses are a very limited population. 
While for smallpox, an actual use for an eradicated disease is currently not foreseen in 
vaccination guidelines, the human-to-human transmission of mpox, both in endemic countries 
as well as in the multi-country outbreak which started in May 2022, has led to the publication 
of various national and international guidelines for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis of 
individuals considered at high risk. In the long term, also an evaluation of the public health 
needs for vaccination to prevent mpox enendemic countries of sub-Saharan Africa should be 
considered in the context of the overall public health needs of these countries. 
To date some effectiveness data starts to be published providing initial reassurance that the 
vaccine will have an effect on disease and the evolution of the outbreak. 
As of September 28, 2022, a total of 25,341 mpox cases have been reported in the United 
States. To examine the incidence of mpox among persons who were unvaccinated and those 
who had received ≥1 JYNNEOS vaccine dose, 5,402 reported mpox cases occurring among

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
males aged 18–49 years during July 31–September 3, 2022, were analyzed by vaccination 
status across 32 U.S. jurisdictions. Average mpox incidence (cases per 100,000) among 
unvaccinated persons was 14.3 (95% CI = 5.0–41.0) times that among persons who received 1 
dose of JYNNEOS vaccine ≥14 days earlier. This early finding suggests that a single dose of 
JYNNEOS vaccine provides some protection against mpox infection. The degree and 
durability of such protection is unknown. (Incidence of Monkeypox Among Unvaccinated 
Persons Compared with Persons Receiving ≥1 JYNNEOS Vaccine Dose — 32 U.S. 
Jurisdictions, July 31–September 3, 2022 | MMWR (cdc.gov)) 
A study in the Clalit Health Services (CHS) of Israel, including subjects eligible for 
JYNNEOS as defined by the Israeli Ministry of Health commenced on July 31, 2022, when the 
vaccination campaign was initiated in CHS, and participants were followed until September 
12, 2022. A Cox proportional-hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates was 
used to estimate the association between vaccination and MPXV infections with adjustment 
for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors. A total of 1,970 subjects met the study 
eligibility criteria (0.04% of CHS members). Of them, 873 (44%) were vaccinated with MVA 
and completed at least 25 days of follow-up. 18 infections were confirmed in CHS during the 
study period, 3 in vaccinated and 15 in unvaccinated status (40.0 versus 6.4 per 100,000 person 
days). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated at 79% (95% CI: 24%-94%). These results 
suggest that a single dose of MVA is associated with a significantly lower risk for MPVX 
infection in high-risk individuals. (Arbel et al., 2022; DOI: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-
1976861/v2) 
More studies are ongoing and will further document the impact of the vaccine and the 
vaccination of individual at risk of acquiring mpox. 
The following table provides an overview of worldwide shipments of the vaccine cumulatively 
since IBD, which was 31-Jul-2013: 
Table 26 Worldwide Shipments of IMVANEX 
Actual post-authorisation usage data 
To date, about 28 million doses of IMVANEX have been delivered to the US Strategic 
National Stockpile (parts already before July 2013, which is the cut-off date for the tables 
above). Approximately 833,000 doses have been delivered to several governmental and 
military facilities outside the US. However, as some of the recipients are military 
organisations, they will not report the actual use of IMVANEX to Bavarian Nordic, but will 
only report serious adverse reactions, should they be observed. 
As of 31-Jul-2022, the MAH has distributed significant number of doses in several countries, 
including those from the European Union, and in the UK, for the purpose of immediate use as 
a public health measure to handle the current mpox outbreak. Several of these implementation 
plans have been initiated and will be rolled out in the weeks and months to come.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
In 2022, the MAH supplied vaccine doses to the European Health Emergency Preparedness 
and Response Authority (HERA), which made vaccine doses available to EU member states, 
Norway and Iceland. As per a contractual agreement, HERA will receive data on the use of the 
vaccine from the countries and will share this information with the MAH for inclusion in 
upcoming PSURs. 
In addition to this, in order to obtain actual exposure data, the MAH also actively screens local 
health authority webpages for data concerning the use of the product, including information of 
doses administered, first versus second dose, stratified by region (by country within the EU), 
gender and age groups and where available. The data received from these publicly available 
sources and received from reports such as from HERA, are summarized in overview tables in 
the PSURs.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
PART II: MODULE SVI  ADDITIONAL EU REQUIREMENTS FOR 
THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
The product is largely not available on the regular market but licensed for stockpiling to be 
used under controlled conditions in special populations (e.g. military and first-line responders). 
However, in the multi-country mpox outbreak in May 2022, the product is being used to 
vaccinate individuals at high risk for exposure to mpox and their contacts. Illegal use or misuse 
is unlikely and therefore no specific measures are warranted. 
Due to its properties it is unsuitable as a biological weapon since the risk for reversion and/or 
recombination to a replication competent virus strain can be virtually excluded due to the 
genetic properties of the product (Suter, 2009). 
PART II: MODULE SVII  IDENTIFIED AND POTENTIAL RISKS 
There have been no new risks identified as important potential or identified risks, based on the 
summary information prepared and submitted for IMVANEX to date. 
SVII.1  Identification of Safety Concerns in the Initial RMP Submission 
The safety concerns of MVA-BN vaccine in the initial RMP are listed in Table 28 Summary of 
safety concerns. 
All safety data available from the MVA-BN clinical development programme were evaluated 
in order to formulate the initial list of identified risks (adverse drug reactions), in addition to 
the important potential risks described within the initial approved version of this Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) (Version 1). Risks that were not included in the initial list of safety 
concerns are presented in Section SVII.1.1, with safety concerns relevant for inclusion in the 
initial approved RMP and their justifications presented in Section SVII.1.2

SVII.1.1  Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of Safety Concerns 
in the RMP 
The following topics were not considered relevant for inclusion in the list of safety concerns at 
the time of initial EU RMP approval: 
Not all potential or identified risks for the vaccine are considered to meet the level of 
importance necessitating inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. Reasons for not 
including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in this RMP include:  
Risks with minimal and temporary clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the 
disease prevented). The main risk associated with administration of MVA-BN is the 
development of local reactions at the vaccination site (e.g. pain, erythema, induration, swelling 
45

and pruritus at the injection site) as well as of generalized symptoms like fatigue, headache, 
myalgia, and nausea). 
Very rare potential risks for any medicinal treatment, including vaccines, which are well 
known to healthcare professionals are not included in the list of safety concerns. 
The following table summarises adverse reactions observed in more than 1% (1:100) of 
exposed subjects in clinical trials with IMVANEX (N=3432).

MVA-009 received Dryvax either on the same day or within 7 days after MVA-BN 
administration and were therefore not included to avoid a potential bias in adverse event 
reporting. 
In addition to the reactions reported above, a total of 7 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) have 
been reported for IMVANEX, which were assessed as possibly related by the investigator. 
The SAEs 
  Pneumonia, 
  Sarcoidosis, 
  Extraocular muscle paresis, 
  Crohn’s disease, and 
  Cardiomyopathy 
  Throat tightness and other hypersensitivity symptoms such as hives, pruritus, tender 
vaccination site, swollen axilla, angioedema of forearms 
  Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction 
have been thoroughly reviewed and it is the opinion of the MAH that there is no reasonable 
evidence for a causal relationship with IMVANEX. 
Regarding immunologic effects caused by vaccines, no evidence can be found in the literature 
referring to the observed events (Salemi, 2010), Orbach, 2010) It is more likely that the 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
observed potentially immunologically stimulated events (sarcoidosis, extraocular muscle 
paresis and Crohn’s disease) are incidental events with no causal relationship. 
The observed pneumonia is caused by bacteria; the early time to onset after vaccination in this 
case basically excludes an immunosuppressive effect. Moreover, such an effect should have 
been observed more likely in the HIV individuals or elderly subjects in the respective studies. 
The cardiomyopathy reported has been observed in a HIV patient. HIV is associated with 
cardiomyopathy in 10-15% and is therefore a rather plausible reason for the event (Barbaro, 
2011). 
Pneumonia: (Study POX-MVA-011) A vaccinia-naïve (18-55 year-old) HIV infected female 
was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia the day after the second vaccination. She 
recovered without sequelae, was discharged after 3 days and continued the study as planned. 
The investigator assessed the pneumonia as possibly related to study medication, since the 
event began within one day after injection and the subject was asymptomatic and had no 
abnormal physical findings on the day of vaccination. 
Comment: Bacterial pneumonia is not caused by viral vaccines; a hypothetical immuno-
suppressive effect can be excluded given the short interval of one day. 
Sarcoidosis: (Study POX-MVA-005) A 18-55 year-old man suffered from arthralgia, 10 
weeks after second vaccination and reported fever up to 38°C and night sweat. Based on 
bronchoscopy and biopsy 42 days later subject was diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Investigator 
classified the event as an important medical event and as possibly related to the study vaccine 
or other condition or treatment. He was treated with 600 mg ibuprofen five times daily for a 
month. Event was ongoing by time of report. 
Extraocular muscle paresis: (Study POX-MVA-008) A 18-55 year-old female received the 
first study vaccination on Study Day 1 and the second vaccination on Study Day 30. She 
experienced extraocular muscle paresis 8 days after the second vaccination. 
She experienced constant mixed horizontal and vertical diplopia. Upon examination by an 
ophthalmologist on Study Day 43 a discreet paresis of the right lower oculomotor muscle was 
diagnosed. The event was treated; on Study Day 48, right hypertropia was improving; and 
diplopia was less bothersome. On Study Day 52 subject presented with a red eye and increased 
palpebral volume; hyperemic eye conjunctive with papules was found. Bacterial conjunctivitis 
was diagnosed. By Study Day 55 paresis had virtually recovered. Neither diplopia nor 
hypertropia were evident. By Study Day 69 diplopia had disappeared completely. There was no 
ocular mobility limitation; conjunctivitis was resolved. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
The treating ophthalmologist mentioned that in the literature there have been isolated cases 
reported of transitory oculomotor paresis due to viral infections or to the use of different 
vaccines. In the absence of other risk factors, the ophthalmologist considered the paresis to be 
probably related to the study vaccine. The attending neurologist considered the event as a 
possible vaccination adverse reaction. 
Comment: In the scientific literature numerous cases of optic neuritis have been reported 
following administration of rubella, measles, hepatitis B, influenza as well as anthrax vaccines. 
However, in the current case the ophthalmologist did not report that the optic nerve was 
involved; rather the impairment seemed to have been limited to the extraocular inferior rectal 
muscle. 
To date, no other cases of any type of paralysis or similar events have been observed following 
administration of the study vaccine. 
Crohn’s disease: This case did not occur during the study period of POX-MVA-005, but 
rather was reported as a post study SUSAR, two years after last vaccination. Information is 
rather limited, as case was found during the screening for a booster study. 
Comment: Given the long interval and the lack of scientific evidence for a causal link between 
vaccination and Morbus Crohn case is assessed as not related (no reasonable evidence) to 
study vaccine. 
Cardiomyopathy: (Study POX-MVA-010) The event involved a 18-55 year-old, HIV-
infected female, who was hospitalized 133 days following her second/last vaccination with the 
study vaccine and was diagnosed with congestive heart failure due to cardiomyopathy. The 
diagnosis was confirmed by a cardiologist, in addition to several other “current problems”, i.e. 
shortness of breath, pleural effusion, hypertension, obesity, dyspnea on exertion, glaucoma and 
osteopenia. She was released after 10 days from the hospital in stable condition with cardiac 
medications. 
Subject had been concomitantly participating in a growth hormone releasing hormone (GH-
RH) study for treatment of lipodystrophy; she had denied this fact during screening for the 
Bavarian Nordic trial, otherwise this would have excluded her participation. The lipodystrophy 
study investigator also assessed the event "congestive cardiac failure" as being possibly related 
to the study drug GH-RH. 
Comment: Due to the latency period of 133 days since the last administration of the study 
vaccine in combination with the other more likely predisposing factors of HIV infection and 
concomitant treatment with GH-RH, Bavarian Nordic assessed the development of congestive 
heart failure due to cardiomyopathy to be unlikely related to the study vaccine.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Throat tightness and other hypersensitivity symptoms (Trial POX-MVA-036): The 
subject received her second dose of IMVANEX 21 days after the first dose and after 2 hours 
developed symptoms such as skin reactions and throat tightness which was responsive to 
epinephrine treatment. She had no wheezing and was not hypotensive. Symptoms subsided 
after several days under prednisone and diphenhydramine treatment. She has a family history 
of allergies and a medical history of shingles. She has received multiple vaccines before but 
never had previous hives or other problems with vaccines. 
Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (Trial POX-MVA-036): Positive family 
history for cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarctions, blood clots), as well as overweight 
with a BMI above 33. A few days before event onset, subject presented with diarrhea and was 
started on ciprofloxacine treatment (which per US prescribing information is associated with 
angina pectoris and myocardial infarction). He showed chest pain and increased troponin I, but 
no ST segment changes in the ECG and no coronary artery disease in cardiac catheterization. 
A post-infectious myocarditis (published case reports exist for campylobacter, shigella, 
salmonella) was considered as alternative etiology for the reported event. 
Please note that the information provided above is included to enable an overview of the 
clinical safety profile of IMVANEX. As no safety concerns have emerged from these data, 
upcoming revisions of the Risk Management Plan may no longer detail clinical data, unless 
any safety signals or safety concerns are found.

Suspected cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis have been observed in healthy adult 
vaccinees. 
An increased incidence of myo-/pericarditis compared to the general population has been 
observed following recent smallpox vaccination programs using Dryvax among US military 
personnel and in clinical trials comparing ACAM2000 to Dryvax (Halsell, 2003; Cassimatis, 
2004; Arness, 2004; Eckart, 2004; ACAM2000, 2007). 
In clinical trials, the reported incidence rates for developing myo-/pericarditis were 10.38 
events per 1000 vaccinations following vaccination with the replicating smallpox vaccine 
Dryvax, and 5.73 events per 1000 vaccinations with ACAM 2000 (ACAM2000, 2007). All 
cases of myocarditis or myo-/pericarditis were considered to be at least possibly related to 
(replicating) study vaccine. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Given this class effect, myo-/pericarditis has been added as an important potential risk for 
IMVANEX. 
Encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, progressive and generalized vaccinia, and erythema 
multiforme major (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and eczema vaccinatum resulting in 
permanent sequelae or death, ocular complications, blindness, and fetal death have occurred 
following either primary vaccination or revaccination with replication-competent smallpox 
vaccines. 
These risks, seen in use of replicating vaccines, are increased in vaccinees with the 
following conditions and may result in severe disability, permanent neurological sequelae 
and/or death: 
o  Cardiac disease or a history of cardiac disease 
o  Eye disease treated with topical steroids 
o  Congenital or acquired immune deficiency disorders, including 
those taking immunosuppressive medications 
o  Eczema and persons with a history of eczema or other acute or chronic 
exfoliative skin conditions 
o  Infants less than 12 months of age 
o  Pregnancy 
Live vaccinia virus can be transmitted to persons who have close contact with the vaccinee and 
the risks in contacts are the same as those for the vaccinee. 
IMVANEX is a live, highly attenuated strain of vaccinia that has been shown not to replicate 
in human cells and therefore cannot be transmitted or cause dispersed vaccinia-infection. 
In addition, the recommended administration of IMVANEX via the SC or IM route also 
excludes the risk of autoinoculation and viral spread. 
Therefore, the effects described above and related contraindications for replicating, replication-
competent vaccinia vaccines like Dryvax and ACAM2000 have neither been observed so far 
with IMVANEX nor are they expected with future use. 
The pharmacological class effects described above are proposed as important potential risks. 
They are not specific to any subgroup, i.e. they are specific to the active substance (and its 
class); hence stratification by a specific formulation, indication or route of administration, by a 
specific target population, or switch to non-prescription status (highly unlikely) is not 
applicable.

situation, the risk of 
smallpox infection is 
considered higher than the 
potential risk of the vaccine 
and possible interactions 
with other vaccines and 
concomitantly administered 
immunoglobulins. 
SVII.2  New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an 
Updated RMP 
For RMP 8.0, the deletion of the important potential risks/safety concerns vaccinia rash, 
eczema vaccinatum, generalised vaccinia, progressive vaccinia, erythema multiforme and 
incorrect route of drug administration were approved. The safety experience of the IMVANEX 
vaccine through the routine pharmacovigilance activities has not reported any incidences of 
any of these events. The absence of these events is expected, because IMVANEX is a live, 
highly attenuated strain of vaccinia that has been shown not to replicate in human cells and 
55

therefore cannot be transmitted or cause dispersed vaccinia infection. In addition, the 
recommended administration of MVA-BN via the SC or IM route excludes the risk of 
cutaneous autoinoculation and viral spread. 
As per regulatory procedure EMEA/H/C/002596/II/0076, the following missing information 
have been removed from the list of safety concerns for this current RMP: 
  Children and adolescents (<18 years) as this subpopulation is not included in the 
targeted indication  
  The term ‘safety experience in a mass vaccination due to a smallpox outbreak’ as per 
EMA request

vaccinees (95% CI: 1.9-13.3) 
Seriousness / 
outcomes 
In the completed clinical trials involving 8992 subjects, no cases of 
myocarditis have been observed, and only one case of possible albeit 
doubtful pericarditis. In this case, the only symptom was chest pain 
being worse when lying down, which met the protocol-specified 
diagnosis criteria. All further cardiac examinations, including 
auscultation, ECG, Troponin I, Echocardiography were normal, i.e. 
there was no pericardial rub or effusion. The subject had no decreased 
exercise capacity, making the diagnosis of an actual pericarditis 
doubtful. As possible alternative explanation, a positive Coxsackie-B 
virus titer was identified during laboratory workup of this condition. The 
outcome was favourable.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Important potential risk: Myo-/pericarditis  
SOC: Cardiac disorders 
Impact on risk- 
benefit balance of 
the product 
Smallpox vaccines have been associated with myopericarditis. If a 
vaccinated 
subject exhibits signs and symptoms potentially associated with cardiac 
disorder (e.g. chest pain or discomfort, dyspnea, palpitations), ECG 
and troponin I test should be performed. In case of ECG changes or 
troponin I elevations, further cardiologic examination should be 
performed. 
Health care professionals will be instructed to observe vaccinees for 
symptoms associated with cardiac disease. If vaccinees become 
symptomatic (i.e. chest pain, dyspnea), ECG and troponin control will be 
advised. In view of the fact that the potential risk has never been observed 
in more than 8992 subjects vaccinated with IMVANEX in contrast to 
other smallpox vaccines (in clinical trials an unexpected high frequency of 
myo-/pericarditis was observed for Dryvax and ACAM2000 (incidence of 
10.38 events/thousand and 5.73 events/thousand, respectively per 1000 
primary vaccinees (95% CI: 1.9-13.3) Pharmacological class effect, US 
Department of Defense Smallpox Vaccination Program (US DoD 2007);

effect is valid for IMVANEX.

Live vaccinia virus can be transmitted to persons who have close 
contact with the vaccinee and the risks in contacts are the same as 
those for the vaccinee. IMVANEX is a live, highly attenuated strain 
of vaccinia that has been shown not to replicate in human cells and 
therefore cannot be transmitted or cause dispersed vaccinia-infection. 
Therefore, this risk has neither been observed so far with IMVANEX 
nor is it expected with future use.

Pregnant women are not within the target population (military, first-line

smallpox, mpox or vaccinia virus infection is considered higher than the 
potential risk of the vaccine.

Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information 
Elderly (>=65 years) 
Individuals with 
organ impairment 
Immunocompromised 
patients  
Elderly are not within the target population (military, first-line responders, 
lab workers, individuals at risk for exposure to smallpox, mpox or vaccinia 
virus. In the current mpox outbreak, the vast majority of the affected 
subjects are young adults). Immune function declines with age in a process 
called immunosenescence. Both the innate and the adaptive immune system 
show reduced function of natural killer cells and dendritic cells and reduced 
diversity and memory of T and B cells. This may render vaccines less 
efficacious in this population (Hägg, 2022). In case of an outbreak situation, 
the risk of smallpox, mpox or vaccinia virus infection is considered higher 
than the potential risk of the vaccine. 
Individuals with organ impairment are not within the primary target 
population (military, first-line responders, lab workers, individuals at risk 
for exposure to smallpox, mpox or vaccinia virus). Their condition or the 
treatment of their condition might impact efficacy of the vaccine. 
Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population 
receiving MVA-BN will be different to that of the general population, 
given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. In case of an 
outbreak situation, the risk of smallpox, mpox or vaccinia virus infection is 
considered higher than the potential risk of the vaccine. 
Immunocompromised patients are not within the primary target population 
(military, first-line responders, lab workers, individuals at risk for exposure 
to smallpox, or vaccinia virus). For mpox, major parts of the target 
population may be immunocompromised, i.e. HIV positive. In case of an 
outbreak situation, the risk of smallpox, mpox or vaccinia virus infection is 
considered higher than the potential risk of the vaccine. 
Interactions with 
other vaccines and 
concomitantly 
administered 
immunoglobulins 
In case of an outbreak situation, the risk of smallpox, mpox or vaccinia virus 
infection is considered higher than the potential risk of the vaccine and 
possible interactions with other vaccines and concomitantly administered 
immunoglobulins. The concomitant administration of MVA-BN vaccine and 
immunoglobulins may alter the immune response of the vaccine. No 
interactions are known for IMVANEX. 
PART II: MODULE SVIII  SUMMARY OF THE SAFETY CONCERNS 
As of the date of this report, BN oversees 8992 subjects exposed with IMVANEX in 
completed clinical trials, including at-risk populations for which replicating smallpox vaccines 
such as Dryvax and ACAM2000 are contraindicated, e.g. individuals with AD or HIV infected

subjects. In addition, more than 110.000 doses had been administered in the US by the data 
lock point of this RMP. Latest numbers are disclosed in Table 27 . (). 
No trends for unexpected and/or serious adverse reactions were detected and no difference in 
the safety profile has been observed between vaccinia-naïve and vaccinia-experienced subjects 
receiving IMVANEX.

PART III: PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING POST-
AUTHORISATION SAFETY STUDIES) 
III.1 
Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities 
Safety concerns and overview of previous pharmacovigilance actions  
  As specified in the approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) BN commits to 
approach the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and/or the 
public health institution of a member state to support the planning and set up of post-
licensure studies to be applied in case of a declared smallpox or mpox outbreak. The 
PIP is being modified. The request for modification is related to the proposed extension 
of the indication of IMVANEX to “active immunisation against smallpox, mpox and 
related orthopoxvirus infection and disease”. Since May 2022, a mpox outbreak began 
spreading globally, mostly affecting countries from the EU/EEA. Although there have 
been only very limited confirmed paediatric cases in this mpox outbreak and the risk to 
human health and to the general public remains low, there is the potential for increased 
health impact with wider dissemination in vulnerable groups, including children. 
Infection with mpox virus during pregnancy may also lead to adverse outcomes for the 
foetus or newborn infant. 
Severe and life-threatening adverse reactions such as inadvertent inoculation, eczema 
vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, generalized vaccinia, and postvaccinal encephalitis 
that have been observed after the administration of conventional smallpox vaccines are 
due to the replication of the vaccinia strains. IMVANEX is replication incompetent in 
human cells and consequently has a better safety and tolerability profile. It is 
essentially impossible that IMVANEX could induce the severe side effects listed above 
associated with replication competent vaccinia viruses. Furthermore, with an overall 
rate (all age groups; data historically reported for Dryvax) of 529.2 cases/million 
vaccinations for inadvertent inoculation, 38.5 cases/million vaccinations for eczema 
vaccinatum, 241.5 cases/million vaccinations for generalized vaccinia, 1.5 
cases/million vaccinations for progressive vaccinia and 12.3 cases/million vaccinations 
for postvaccinal encephalitis in primary (vaccinia-naïve) vaccinees, these rare events 
are highly unlikely to be captured in a clinical trial and true monitoring may therefore 
only be possible during a post-market surveillance. Nevertheless, all these events 
would constitute an SAE and thus be captured via the routine AE reporting procedure 
within the clinical trials. 
62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Children and adolescents (<18 years), pregnant and lactating women, individuals with 
organ impairment or treated with other vaccines or concomitantly administered 
immunoglobulins were excluded from participating in either of both clinical trials. 
Nevertheless, pregnancies exposed to the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) 
cannot be excluded with certainty and would have been followed up until delivery. 
  Since it was not possible to assess effectiveness, at time of licensure, seroconversion 
was measured as a surrogate parameter at least in a subset of subjects in clinical trials 
and the special access program. 
  Regular updates on safety and efficacy of IMVANEX since approval were provided in 
PSURs in a 6-month cycle. 
Overview of routine pharmacovigilance activities 
It is needed to differentiate between routine pharmacovigilance activities in case of a mass 
vaccination campaign e.g. during a smallpox outbreak and vaccination of a specific target 
population. These are two different scenarios demanding different approaches. It is considered 
that for the current mpox outbreak routine pharmacovigilance activities such as ICSR reporting 
to EudraVigilance according to the legally binding timelines and regular PSURs are sufficient, 
whereas in a mass vaccination campaign e.g. during a smallpox outbreak with major impact on 
health systems and important infrastructure more focused pharmacovigilance activities may be 
needed. 
Bavarian Nordic undertakes routine pharmacovigilance activities consistent with the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E2E Pharmacovigilance Planning 
Guideline.  
Routine pharmacovigilance activities (as defined by standard operating procedures and 
guidelines) are designed to rapidly assess the ongoing safety profile of IMVANEX throughout 
clinical development and in the post-authorisation period in order to characterise and 
communicate pertinent safety data appropriately.  
In addition to ICH requirements, Bavarian Nordic’s routine pharmacovigilance activities in 
relation to IMVANEX are also aligned with the measures described in GVP IX.  
Routine activities to specifically address the challenges in the context of mass vaccination are 
described in the sections below.

Enhanced PV activities  
III.1.1 Signal Detection 
Given the specific requirements of vaccines and the need to rapidly identify potential safety 
issues during mass vaccination, routine signal detection activities are supplemented as 
described below. 
Adverse events of special interest 
For the purpose of the RMP and summary safety reports, an AESI list is defined taking into 
consideration the available lists of AESIs from the following expert groups and regulatory 
authorities:  
•  Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC) (Law, 2020) 
•  ACCESS protocol (ACCESS, 2020) 
•  US CDC (preliminary list of AESI for VAERS surveillance) (Shimabukuro, 2020) 
•  MHRA (unpublished guideline) 
The AESI list is comprised of medical conditions to allow for changes and customisations of 
MedDRA terms as directed by AE reports and the evolving safety profile of the vaccine. The 
terms searched (using MedDRA SMQ search terms) in the safety database to identify cases of 
potential AESIs are presented by System Organ Class. Medical concepts that are captured in 
the AESI list include (case definitions of these AESIs are presented in Annex 1 ): 
•  Myocarditis 
•  Pericarditis 
•  Encephalitis 
•  Anaphylaxis 
•  Lack Of Efficacy/vaccination failure 
The AESI list will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and will be updated as necessary.

Quantitative methodology 
Due to the nature of the license and thus the vaccine having been mainly used for 
governmental stock piling and the initial indication being for smallpox infection and disease 
only (which was officially declared eradicated in 1980 by the WHO), a low case volume was 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
received in the post-marketing setting just until recently. Signal assessment was performed 
considering all possible sources for safety relevant information periodically and was 
summarized in aggregate reports. During clinical development, adverse events were reviewed 
during trial duration, analyzed in clinical trial reports and aggregate reports. 
Up until 2021, cumulatively there were nine (9) post market cases received since license grant 
in 31 Jul 2013. Considering the amount of data available for MVA-BN since the license was 
first granted and with the finalization of clinical development it was further decided to evaluate 
the safety data as per review periods in order to identify trends. 
Disproportionality analysis is primarily a tool to generate hypotheses on possible causal 
relations between drugs and adverse effects, to be followed up by clinical assessment of the 
underlying individual case reports by dedicated pharmacovigilance professionals. It is still the 
predominant statistical and computational method; however, disproportionality analysis is 
generally recommended and necessary for large databases. Since the beginning of the recent 
mpox outbreak the case volume increased but the total number of cases in the GSDB is still 
close under 1000 cases in total.   
Within BN, following quantitative method is used: 
Disproportionality analysis using EudraVigilance 
EudraVigilance data are downloaded and integrated into the GSDB on a daily basis. These 
data are included in the weekly data review. Additionally, an eRMR is generated on a monthly 
basis and is included as a part of routine signal detection reports. The eRMR report is 
generated using the Active Substance High Level value of “MODIFIED VACCINIA 
ANKARA – BAVARIAN NORDIC LIVE VIRUS”. 
Filters are then applied to the eRMR to identify events requiring review. Examples of these 
filters include events that are statistically significant (RoR > 1.0), or are Important Medical 
Events, Designated Medical Events  per EMA, or have an increase in the number of reported 
cases. 
Qualitative methodology 
Routine safety data review:  Data from Bavarian Nordic’s global safety database (GSDB) are 
extracted weekly in the form of specific listings and reviewed weekly as part of routine 
surveillance activities. In addition, daily listings may be generated for cases not yet 
closed/locked in the safety database to allow for early identification of any potential safety 
issue. These listings include, besides all AEs, regardless of outcome and listedness also reports 
66 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
from special situations (such as reports of medication error, overdose/underdose, lack of 
efficacy, and potential interactions with other vaccines administered concomitantly). 
Monthly signal reports are created with listings that provide both per period and cumulative 
event counts, and comparisons with previous event counts are conducted to determine if there 
are any sudden increases or unusual patterns of AE reporting, as population-level exposure to 
MVA-BN is expected to increase over time. These reports also support the identification of 
potential serious but rare adverse reactions that may be associated with MVA-BN use. 
Batch related trends: The majority of recorded batch/lot numbers in the GSDB still stems from 
clinical trial cases. Batch numbers are tabulated per reported AEs and compared for trends in 
order to identify any safety issues potentially related to the quality of MVA-BN in the routine 
reports. 
Time-series analysis: In order to identify changes in case reporting over time, 
time-series analyses will be considered based on necessity, and subject to the availability 
of baseline data. 
Observed versus expected (O/E) analysis: This signal detection methodology is currently under 
evaluation. O/E analysis will be conducted for events/medical concepts provided on the AESI 
list (see Section III.1 ). The stratified background rates publicly available from the ACCESS 
program and other industry groups (as applicable) will be analysed against the observed 
reports received in the MAH’s GSDB, using distribution data and/or exposure data collected 
from EU member countries when made publicly available, on a monthly basis. To account for 
potential under reporting of AEs, sensitivity analysis will be performed. Where appropriate, 
standard statistical testing methodology will also be applied. To further enhance background 
rate identification additional literature review may be conducted if ACCESS data is 
insufficient or unavailable.  
Time-to-onset analysis: An additional signal detection methodology currently under evaluation 
is time-to-onset analysis. This methodology will consider the amount of time from vaccine 
administration to event onset for a given event compared to onset time for all other vaccines 
for that event. 
Mixed methodology 
Cluster Analysis: Cluster analyses will be performed ad hoc based on the results of routine 
surveillance methods described above. Should a cluster analysis be performed as part of the 
signal detection process, this will be included in the Summary Safety Report (see Section 
67 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
III.1.1 Signal Detection). Rationales will be described for such analyses, and all PTs will be 
provided. 
The MAH will attempt to acquire exposure data based on administered doses, first versus 
second dose, stratified by region (by country within the EU), gender and age groups, where 
available. Where such data are not available, exposure data will be included in the report 
based on doses distributed in each market by the MAH and its license partners, as part of 
SDEAs/PVAs. 
With regards to AESIs, safety concerns and fatal AEs, the total number of any such events are 
discussed in the context of O/E analyses, which is conducted as part of signal detection 
activities. 
III.1.1.1 Signal Evaluation 
Each evaluation of a signal should include information regarding the source or trigger of the 
signal, relevant background, method(s) of evaluation (including data sources, search criteria 
and standard definition for diagnoses), results (a summary and critical analysis of the data 
considered), discussion and conclusion. The conclusion of a signal evaluation can either refute 
that signal or determine that there is a potential or identified risk associated with the product. 
Risks are further categorised as non-important or important depending on the severity, 
reversibility, and other safety aspects. All validated signals will be presented in the Summary 
Safety Report (see (see Section III.1.1 Signal Detection). 
Following validation of any signal, a further internal safety review will take place based on 
BN’s standard operating procedures. Following this, should there be a reasonable possibility of 
a causal relationship with MVA-BN, appropriate updates will be made to the core product 
information, which will subsequently be shared with Competent Authorities through standard 
regulatory processes. 
III.1.2 ICSR Reporting in case of mass vaccination 
To address the challenges associated with a mass vaccination campaign it is necessary to 
ensure that the necessary pharmacovigilance infrastructure is in place to address the expected 
rapid increase in post-marketing individual case safety reports (ICSRs) for processing and 
regulatory reporting. This will in turn facilitate the rapid provision of high-quality data to 
support the detection and evaluation of potential safety issues.  
Measures to be put in place include scaling of infrastructure and systems, recruitment and 
training of additional resources, and implementation of specific processes and procedures. 
Spontaneous cases of confirmed lack of efficacy when MVA-BN is used in accordance with its 
authorisation, will be reported within the required 15 days of receipt.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
III.1.3 Specific Adverse Reaction Follow-Up Questionnaires 
  For the safety concern “important missing information: Use during pregnancy and 
breastfeeding” a specific Pregnancy Questionnaire was developed to ensure consistent 
data capture of pregnancy reports (documentation and follow up [pregnancy tracking]). 
  For the safety concern “Myo-/Pericarditis” a specific Adverse Event Follow-Up 
Questionnaire-Inflammatory cardiac disorders has been developed to ensure consistent 
data capture suspected myocarditis case reports. 
  For the safety concern “Postvaccinal encephalitis” a specific Adverse Event Follow-Up 
Questionnaire – Immune mediated neurologic disorders has been developed to ensure 
consistent data capture of all suspected encephalitis case reports. 
All the above-mentioned questionnaires are provided in Annex 4. 
III.1.4 Summary Safety Reports 
In case of mass vaccination in, for example, a smallpox outbreak scenario, in addition to the 
submission of Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) at 6-monthly intervals, Summary 
Safety Reports (SSR) will be compiled as a complement to the submission of PSURs at 
initially monthly intervals for MVA-BN. This is to support timely and continuous benefit risk 
evaluations. Topics and frequency for the first SSR should be agreed with the regulators and 
will include as a minimum: 
- 
- 
- 
Interval and cumulative number of reports per HLT and SOC. Interval and cumulative 
number  
Interval and cumulative number of reports of fatal events and case reports involving PT 
of sudden death 
Interval and cumulative number of reports, stratified by report type (medically 
confirmed/not) and by seriousness (including fatal separately) 
-  Overview of data presented in tabulations (Observed versus Expected analyses, AESIs, 
safety concerns, vaccination errors associated with harm and/or where risk 
minimisation activities are considered warranted, batch analysis and lack of efficacy) 
Interval and cumulative number of pregnancies 
- 
-  Reports per EU country 
-  Estimated exposure data from post-marketing experience  
-  Changes to reference safety information in the interval, and current CCDS 
-  Ongoing and closed signals in the interval 
-  Conclusion and actions (reflecting risk-benefit considerations) 
For the first few SSR submissions a discussion if any unusual pattern of fatal reports is 
observed during initial post-marketing use will be included. Data on medication errors will be 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
included only if a pattern of errors leading to harm is identified and/or risk minimisation 
activities are considered. 
The MAH will attempt to acquire exposure data based on administered doses, first versus 
second dose, stratified by region (by country within the EU), gender and age groups, where 
available. Where such data are not available, exposure data will be included in the report 
based on doses distributed in each market by the MAH and its license partners, as part of 
SDEAs/PVAs. 
With regards to AESIs, safety concerns and fatal AEs, the total number of any such events are 
discussed in the context of O/E analyses, which is conducted as part of signal detection 
activities. 
III.1.4 Enhanced Passive Surveillance 
Enhanced passive surveillance activities are not planned as other additional pharmacovigilance 
measures are in place (see Section III.2).  
III.1.5 Traceability, shipping and transport conditions 
Traceability: 
Where regional practices permit, the batch number for MVA-BN, if not already provided, is 
systematically followed up for each post marketing ICSR. When available, batch information 
is included in the GSDB. The SmPC, includes instructions for healthcare professionals to 
clearly record the name and batch number of the administered vaccine to improve traceability 
(section 4.4). 
The Bavarian Nordic packaging/tracking configuration for 
IMVANEX/IMVAMUNE/JYNNEOS follows Standard Operating procedures and is as 
follows: 
•  Primary: Labels on vials includes batch/Lot number 
•  Secondary: Vials are packed in cartons of 20 and the cartons are serialized 
•  Tertiary: Cartons are packed in cases of 70 and the cases are serialized 
The serialization includes all relevant information. 
During packaging, vial labels are printed with batch specific data and applied to the vials. The 
labelled vials are placed in an insert and a leaflet applied. Inserts with vials and leaflet are then 
put in cartons, and the carton ends glued to secure tamper evidence of the carton. The cartons 
are printed with batch specific and serialization data and put in a case, where the cartons are 
aggregated to the case. The cases are closed with tape, a case label with serialization data for 
the case is applied, and the case is put on a pallet.  
After the batch has been started on the line, the control functions of the packaging line are 
tested. Samples of printed packaging materials will be collected from the packaging line when 
these have been imprinted and controlled by the Vision system. The samples will be controlled 
for appearance and correct imprint by an operator and added to the batch journal. 
In process controls at vial- and carton level are taken during start-up, hourly and before ending 
the batch to continuously verify correctness and quality of print and packaging.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
A packed carton with 20 vials will be collected at the end of the batch as a retention sample for 
Quality Assurance. 
Traceability is also available for every shipment of MVA-BN smallpox/mpox vaccine through 
correlation of relevant shipment information (packing list, sales order/invoice, freightbill etc.) 
and shipped batch/quantity. Each shipment is equipped with Electronic Data Logging Monitors 
(EDLMs) for registration of temperature during shipment. The EDLMs are traceable to unique 
serial nos. which are logged prior to and after shipment to ensure matching information. 
EDLM serial nos. are available on the temperature readouts. 
Shipping and transport conditions 
MVA-BN smallpox/mpox vaccines require storage and shipping at ultra-cold conditions and 
per standard procedures are shipped in qualified shipping equipment and transport modes. 
EDLMs are used to monitor and ensure that the temperature during shipment has been 
maintained within the required conditions throughout as per pre-defined specifications. In case 
excursions from the required conditions take place, escalation for product impact assessment is 
effectuated with the aim to report back to consignee soonest possible whether received 
shipment is still acceptable for use. Temperature excursions are identified through a 
combination of evaluating when the shipment took place and how the temperature readout 
appears in the relevant period. Alarm limits are programmed into the EDLMs to point to 
potential shipment temperature excursions. 
Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities 
III.2 
Given differences in the vaccination policy between member states in terms of type of vaccine 
used, target population prioritised for vaccination, setting of vaccination and surveillance 
systems already in place, it is considered that a single method cannot be proposed. 
PASS/PAES POX-MVA-039 summary:  
Study short name and title:  
POX-MVA-039: An observational post-authorization safety and efficacy study for the 
prophylactic vaccination with IMVANEX following re-emergence of circulating 
smallpox infections 
Rationale and study objectives:  
The primary objective of the study will be to monitor and characterise incidence of serious 
adverse events and/or medically attended adverse events in patients exposed to IMVANEX in 
accordance with a national public health vaccination program and/or other real-life use, in 
case of a smallpox outbreak. 
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Effectiveness endpoints will also be included in the PASS/PAES.  
Study design:  
A prospective non-interventional cohort study (POX-MVA-039) will be started as soon as 
the vaccine is used in mass vaccination in a smallpox outbreak situation. Concurrent cohorts 
of non-exposed individuals are not required given the conditions of an outbreak situation. 
Study population:  
The recruitment procedure will ensure that an adequate number of subjects will be included 
in each age category. The following numbers of subjects to be studied are considered a 
minimum sample size: 
<18 years: 
please refer to PIP (P/0038/2012), 342 
18 - 44 
45 - 60 
>60 years: 
2,658 
3000 
3000. 
Please note: safety data of PIP and PASS will be combined for evaluation. 
For practical reasons, flexibility in the age categories is allowed. The total sample size of 
9000 subjects would be able to rule out events occurring with a frequency of 1 per 3000 if 
no event is observed (provided the event may occur in all age categories). 
Milestones:   
At this time it is not possible to plan for even first steps (incl. which registries to use, establish 
first contacts to potential investigators etc.) since a mass vaccination would be performed in 
case of a smallpox outbreak. However, it cannot be foreseen where in the world such an 
outbreak would occur. 
Non-BN sponsored Postmarketing Safety and Efficacy Studies in the context of the 
current mpox outbreak 
Given the fast evolution of the current outbreak, incompatible with the timelines to set up a 
PAES, it would be unfeasible for Bavarian Nordic to set-up a study that provides effectiveness 
and safety data in a timely manner, especially since the vaccine supply situation and the mpox 
outbreak dynamics is continuously changing since the start of the outbreak and might continue 
to change substantially over the next months. This is an agreed approach with the regulators 
per outcome of Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/002596/II/0076 
SEMVAc study summary:

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Bavarian Nordic has agreed with the investigators of the SEMVAc study (a prospective, non-
interventional, multicentric cohort study to determine the vaccine effectiveness and safety of 
MVA-BN against symptomatic mpox virus infections - study synopsis in Annex 3) to be able 
to share the data of the study as part of its commitments. 
Study short name and title: 
Sicherheit und Effektivität der MVA-BN Impfung gegen MPXV-Infektion bei Risikopersonen 
in Deutschland (SEMVAc)  
(Safety and Effectiveness of MVA-BN vaccination against MPXV infection in at-risk 
individuals in Germany) 
Note: The study protocol still contains the term monkeypox instead of mpox. At Bavarian 
Nordic, we change the names wherever possible, but as Bavarian Nordic is not the sponsor of 
the SEMVAc study, we can only recommend the principal investigator changing the protocol 
terminology asap. 
Rationale and study objectives: 
The primary outcome measure is vaccine effectiveness of MVA-BN against symptomatic 
PCR-detected mpox disease, defined as reduction in risk of disease in vaccinated versus 
unvaccinated individuals. Safety and tolerability of MVA-BN vaccination will be assessed 
through questionnaires as one of the secondary outcome measures. 
Study design: 
This is a prospective non-interventional observational cohort study without randomization. 
Baseline demographic characteristics will be collected, and the risk behaviour of participants 
be collected (sexual behaviour, occurrence of STIs) and quantified (number of contact). All 
study participants will be prospectively observed for 1 year, for estimate of vaccine 
effectiveness (calculated based on symptomatic PCR-detected mpox disease), and safety. 
In a subset of participants (1000 vaccinated and 1000 unvaccinated), serology response to 
mpox will be analysed. 
Study population: 
The study population is healthy MSM, with indication for PrEP of IMVANEX and without 
known exposure to mpox, but individuals with existing medical conditions (HIV, STIs, atopic 
dermatitis) and medication (HIV PrEP) are allowed to be recruited. The study will include 
subjects at high risk for a mpox infection, 5’000 who received MVA-BN and 10’000 controls 
that will not be vaccinated.

1.8.2 Risk Management Plan 
Study start was on 07 Jul 2022. Last Participant Out is planned to be in December 2023, with 
study end planned on 31 Dec 2023. The total duration of the study is planned to be 18 months.

PART V: RISK MINIMIZATION MEASURES (INCLUDING 
EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK 
MINIMIZATION ACTIVITIES) 
Risk Minimisation Plan  
IMVANEX has been shown to be safe and well tolerated, revealing no risks requiring risk 
minimization activities by safety concern. Moreover, IMVANEX is not intended for regular 
marketing (government use programmes only). 
V.1 
Routine Risk Minimisation Measures

potential risk 
Myo-/pericarditis 
Objectives of risk minimization

Identification of risk factors. 
Facilitation of appropriate measures if increased risk is 
noted. 
Routine risk minimization 
measures 
All cases of suspected/possible myo-/pericarditis will be 
followed-up according to the case definitions as published 
by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention 
In the event that information should become available to 
suggest that myo/pericarditis must be regarded as an 
identified risk for IMVANEX, the Applicant is committed 
to include a respective warning in the product information. 
In this context, the Applicant will use the definition for 
“identified risk” as provided in GVP module V, i.e. “an 
untoward occurrence for which there is adequate evidence 
of an association with the medicinal product of interest”. 
In the case of IMVANEX, such adequate evidence would 
be generated in particular by “a number of well-
documented spontaneous reports where causality is 
strongly supported by temporal relationship and biological 
plausibility.”

How effectiveness of risk 
minimization measures for 
safety concern will be measured 
Any significant number of spontaneous ADR cases of 
myo-/pericarditis received – or corresponding information 
in published literature – would indicate possible lack of 
efficacy of current risk minimization measures. 
Criteria for judging success of 
proposed risk minimization 
measures 
If there is no evidence for an increase in the number of 
spontaneous ADR cases of myo-/pericarditis received – or 
corresponding information in published literature – this 
would be considered evidence for efficacy of current risk 
minimization measures. 
Planned dates for assessment 
As per submission due date of each PSUR. 
Results of effectiveness 
measurement 
As no confirmed cases of myo-/pericarditis have been 
reported for IMVANEX, no additional risk minimization 
activities are considered necessary.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR IMVANEX® 
(SMALLPOX AND MPOX VACCINE MODIFIED VACCINIA ANKARA-
BAVARIAN NORDIC (MVA-BN®) (LIVE ATTENUATED, NON-
REPLICATING)) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for IMVANEX. The RMP details 
important risks of IMVANEX, and how more information will be obtained about IMVANEX's 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
IMVANEX's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how IMVANEX should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for IMVANEX should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
IMVANEX's RMP. 
I 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
IMVANEX is authorised for active immunisation against smallpox, mpox and disease caused 
by vaccinia virus in adults (see SmPC for the full indications). It contains smallpox vaccine 
live Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN®) (live attenuated, non-
replicating) as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous (SC) injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of IMVANEX’s benefits can be found in 
IMVANEX’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/imvanex. 
II 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE 
THE RISKS 
Important risks of IMVANEX, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about IMVANEX's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
ꞏ  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;

Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of IMVANEX is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
II.A 
Important risks of IMVANEX are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of IMVANEX. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine). 
As of the date of this report, BN oversees 8992 subjects exposed with IMVANEX, including 
at-risk populations for which replicating smallpox vaccines such as Dryvax and ACAM2000 
are contraindicated, e.g. individuals with AD or HIV infected subjects. (late breaking: more 
than 900.000 doses have been administered in the US in the ongoing mpox outbreak as of 11-
Oct-2022, numbers from other countries are still being compiled). 
No trends for unexpected and/or serious adverse reactions were detected and no difference in 
the safety profile has been observed between vaccinia-naïve and vaccinia-experienced subjects 
receiving IMVANEX.

studies with other vaccines or medicinal products have 
been performed. Therefore, concomitant administration of 
IMVANEX with other vaccines should be avoided. The 
concomitant administration of the vaccine with any 
immunoglobulin including Vaccinia Immune Globulin 
(VIG) has not been studied and should be avoided’ 
Additional risk minimisation measures

Studies Which Are Conditions of the Marketing Authorization 
Study short name: PASS/PAES POX-MVA-039: An observational post-authorization safety 
and efficacy study for the prophylactic vaccination with IMVANEX following re-emergence 
of circulating smallpox infections 
Purpose of the study: The primary objective of the study will be to monitor and characterise 
incidence of serious adverse events and/or medically attended adverse events in patients 
exposed to IMVANEX in accordance with a national public health vaccination program and/or 
other real-life use. 
Effectiveness endpoints will also be included in the PASS/PAES. 
The POX-MVA-039 study is not designed or operationally feasible to adapt during current 
mpox outbreak, due to the difference between smallpox and mpox mode of transmission and 
the present implementation of vaccination campaigns to target a limited number of people in 
close contact with mpox cases and people at high risk of exposure.

Study short name: SEMVAc (Sicherheit und Effektivität der MVA-BN Impfung gegen 
MPXV-Infektion bei Risikopersonen in Deutschland) (Safety and Effectiveness of MVA-BN 
vaccination against MPXV infection in at-risk individuals in Germany) 
Purpose of the study: This is a prospective, non-interventional, multicentric cohort study. It is 
a non-BN sponsored clinical study. The primary outcome measure is vaccine effectiveness of 
IMVANEXagainst symptomatic PCR-detected mpox disease, defined as reduction in risk of 
disease in vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals. Safety and tolerability of IMVANEX 
vaccination will be assessed through questionnaires as one of the secondary outcome 
measures. 
The study has started on 07-Jul-2022.

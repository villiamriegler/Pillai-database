2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
MS is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects as many as 2.1 
million  people  worldwide  (National  Multiple  Sclerosis  Society,  2011).  The  prevalence  rate  varies 
between  races  and  geographical  regions,  with  reported  rates  of  more  than  100  per  100,000  in 
Northern and Central Europe to 50 per 100,000 in Southern Europe (CPMP/EWP/561/98 Rev. 1).  
Similar variation in prevalence is also observed by geographical latitude in the United States (US; 
Noonan, 2010, Prev Chronic Dis).  The age of onset ranges from approximately 10 to 60 years, 
with  most  cases  typically  occurring  between  20  and  50  years  of  age.    As  with  most  other 
autoimmune  disorders,  multiple  sclerosis  is  more  common  among  women  than  men  and  has  a 
female predominance of approximately 2:1 (Noseworthy, 2000, N Engl J Med). 
Prognosis of multiple sclerosis is highly variable. Its overall prognosis is known, with irreversible 
limitation  in  ambulation  (EDSS  4),  a  unilateral  aid  required  for  walking  (EDSS  6)  and  patients 
becoming wheelchair-bound (EDSS 7) after median times of approximately 8, 20 and 30 years of 
evolution,  respectively.  It  takes  longer  for  cases  with  an  exacerbating-remitting  onset  than  in 
those  with  a  progressive  onset  to  reach  levels  of  irreversible  disability.  Life  expectancy  is  only 
marginally  reduced.  Another  hallmark  of  the  disease  is  the  high  degree  of  variability  in  the 
outcome from one patient to another, with the full spectrum of disease ranging from benign and 
even  asymptomatic,  to  more  malignant  cases  (Confavreux  C  et  al:  Brain  2003,  Volume  126, 
Issue 4, 770-782). 
 Its  clinical  course  is  typically  characterised  by  initial  episodes  of  transient  neurological 
compromise  (relapses)  with  recovery,  followed  by  a  phase  of  cumulative  deficits  that  may 
increase  with  each  new  episode.    Many  relapsing  patients  eventually  develop  secondary 
progression  leading  to  a  constellation  of  chronic  sequelae  including  profound  muscle  weakness, 
impaired gait and mobility, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and cognitive and visual impairments.  
Although patients typically experience some degree of recovery following a relapse, even a single 
relapse  can  lead  to  permanent  disability  in  a  substantial  number  of  patients  with  a  sizeable 
majority  being  left  with  disability  after  two  events  (Lublin,  2003,  Neurology).    Furthermore, 
approximately 70% of those patients with relapsing-remitting MS eventually enter the secondary 
progressive phase of the disease characterised by continued physical and cognitive decline, with 
or without relapses, and are often unresponsive to existing treatments.   
Pathologically, MS is characterised by focal tissue injury of the brain and spinal cord due to the 
complex interplay of inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury, astrocytosis and tissue atrophy.  
Given  the  central  role  of  inflammation  in  the  pathogenesis  of  MS,  a  number  of  immunological 
therapies have been studied in patients with this disease, including alemtuzumab.   
In  addition  to  symptomatic  therapy  and  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  acute  relapses  such  as 
corticosteroids,  there  are  currently  eight products  (representing  5  different  drug  classes) 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 9/116 
 
 
  
  
approved  as  disease-modifying  therapies  (DMTs)  for  treatment  of  relapsing  forms  of  MS  in  the 
the European Union (EU) and US.   
Four  of  the  approved  DMTs  are  beta-interferon  drugs  that  are  typically  used  as  first-line 
treatments:  Betaseron/Betaferon  and  Extavia  (subcutaneous  [SC]  IFNB-1b  250  μg  on  alternate 
days), Avonex (intramuscular [IM] IFNB-1a 30 μg once per week) and Rebif (SC IFNB-1a 22 or 
44 μg  3  times  per  week).    Glatiramer  acetate  (Copaxone;  20  mg/day  SC)  is  also  used  as  first-
line  therapy  while  mitoxantrone  (Novantrone,  Elsep;  12  mg/m²  intravenous  [IV]  infusion  every 
3 months) is usually confined to aggressive or progressive cases due to associated toxic effects 
(Compston,  2008,  Lancet;  Pascual,  2009,  Mult  Scler).    The  most  recently  approved  DMTs  are 
natalizumab  (Tysabri;  300  mg  IV  infusion  every  4  weeks)  and  fingolimod  (Gilenya;  0.5  mg 
capsule once daily).   
Clinical  experience  with  the  existing  approved  DMTs  indicate  a  reduction  in  relapses,  slowed 
accumulation  of  disability  and/or  improvement  in  MRI  outcomes  to  varying  extent  relative  to 
placebo  (Jacobs,  1996,  Ann  Neurol;  PRISMS  Study  Group,  1998,  Lancet;  Johnson,  1995, 
Neurology;  Li,  1999,  Ann  Neurol).    The  pivotal  registration  studies  for  the  more  recently 
approved  natalizumab  (as  monotherapy)  and  fingolimod  also  used  placebo  as  a  comparator 
(Polman,  2006,  N  Engl  J  Med;  Kappos,  2010,  N  Engl  J  Med)  and  none  of  the  studies 
demonstrated in the longer term (e.g., studies of at least 2 years duration) that they are a more 
appropriate treatment or superior to the existing first-line therapies, particularly with regards to 
effects  on  accumulation  of  disability.    A  reduction  in  relapse  rate  was  observed  with  fingolimod 
versus low-dose IM IFNB-1a over a 12-month period although there was no difference between 
treatments with regards to effect on disability progression (Cohen, 2010, N Engl J Med).  Patients 
who  received  low-dose  IM  IFNB-1a  and  switched  to  fingolimod  in  an  extension  study  showed 
improvements in relapse rates and MRI outcomes, but not disability progression, relative to the 
previous IFNB-1a treatment period (Khatri, 2011, Lancet Neurol).  Fingolimod was not compared 
to  high-dose,  high-frequency  IFNB-1a,  nor  was  it  formally  studied  in  patients  experiencing 
disease activity on another MS treatment. 
The active substance, alemtuzumab, is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, 
one  of  several  specific  surface  antigens  acquired  by  cells  of  the  hematopoietic  system  during 
leukocyte  differentiation.    Alemtuzumab  binds  to  CD52  which  is  present  at  high  levels  on  the 
surface  of  T  and  B  lymphocytes  and  at  lower  levels  on  natural  killer  cells,  monocytes  and 
macrophages.  There is little or no CD52 detected  on neutrophils, plasma cells or bone marrow 
stem cells. 
Alemtuzumab  was  approved  until  recently  as  MabCampath  for  the  treatment  of  B-cell  chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia. The posology, however, is considerably different for MS as compared to B-
CLL:  the  cumulative  dose  in  B-CLL  was  around  1100  mg,  administered  in  a  dose  escalation 
scheme within 12 weeks, while in MS the cumulative dose is much lower: a maximum cumulative 
dose of 96 mg, administered in two cycles 12 months apart. 
The  mechanism  by  which  alemtuzumab  exerts  its  therapeutic  effects  in  multiple  sclerosis  is 
unknown,  but  may  involve  immunomodulation  through  the  depletion  and  repopulation  of 
lymphocytes.  Research  suggests  that  alemtuzumab  alters  the  number,  proportions  and 
properties  of  some  lymphocyte  subsets  on  repopulation.  The  proposed  mechanism  of  action  is 
antibody  dependent  cell-mediated  cytolysis  and  complement-mediated  cytolysis  following  cell 
surface binding of alemtuzumab to lymphocytes.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  active  substance  of  the  finished  product  is  alemtuzumab,  a  genetically  engineered  human 
immunoglobulin  subclass  gamma  1  (IgG1)  kappa  monoclonal  antibody  containing  6 
complementarity-determining  regions  derived  from  an  IgG2a  rat  monoclonal  antibody,  specific 
for the cell surface glycoprotein, CD52.  
Alemtuzumab  binds  to  CD52,  an  antigen  present  at  high  levels  on  the  surface  of  B  and  T 
lymphocytes,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  on  other  leukocytes  including  natural  killer  (NK)  cells, 
monocytes, and macrophages.  Alemtuzumab acts by causing cell lysis through both complement 
fixation  as  well  as  antibody  dependent  cell-mediated  cytolysis  following  cell  surface  binding  of 
alemtuzumab to lymphocytes. 
The  finished  product  is  a  concentrate  solution  for  infusion  and  will  be  available  as  1.2  ml  (10 
mg/ml) vials. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The alemtuzumab molecule is a genetically engineered human IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody 
with  a  molecular  weight  of  approximately  150  kD.  The  humanized  antibody  was  made  by  the 
insertion  of  six  complementarity-determining  regions  (CDRs)  from  an  IgG2a  rat  monoclonal 
antibody into a human IgG1 immunoglobulin molecule.  
The  alemtuzumab  molecule  consists  of  two  ~24  kD  small  polypeptide  chains  (light  chains,  214 
amino acids) and two larger ~49 kD polypeptide chains (heavy chains, 450 amino acids) linked 
together by two inter (light chain - heavy chain) disulphide bridges and two inter (heavy chain - 
heavy chain) disulphide bridges to form a Y-shaped molecule, typical for immunoglobulins of the 
IgG1  subclass.  Each  molecule  also  contains  a  total  of  12  intra-chain  disulphide  bridges  and  an 
asparagine residue (301) in each heavy chain which is glycosylated. 
Manufacture 
Alemtuzumab active substance is manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. 
KG.  
Source, history and generation of the cell substrate 
The  source  of  the  antibody  and  the  generation  construction  of  the  expression  construct  are 
adequately  described.  The  expression  construct  has  been  characterized  in  accordance  with  ICH 
Q5B.  Alemtuzumab  was  generated  by  humanisation  of  a  rat  antibody  (CAMPATH-1G)  directed 
against the human CD52 antigen.  
The  cell  line  development  has  been  described  in  details,  including  the  animal  derived  materials 
used  during  the  culturing  and  selection  procedures.  Alemtuzumab  is  produced  in  a  Chinese 
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line.

The cell banking system, including the procedure for establishment of future working cell banks, 
is  considered  properly  described.  The  characterization  of  the  Master  Cell  Bank  (MCB)  and 
Working Cell Bank (WCB) is in accordance with ICH Q5D and Q5B. Viral examination of the WCB 
and  MCB  is  in  accordance  with  Q5A.  The  first  MCB,  designated  MCB1,  was  prepared  from  the 
premaster cell line. MCB1 was used to produce  WCBs that  produced  clinical trial material. After 
the  production  of  MCB1,  a  second  MCB  (MCB2)  was  prepared  from  a  subclone  of  MCB1  to 
improve  stability.  MCB2  was  fully  characterized  and  is  the  source  of  all  WCBs  utilised  for 
commercial  production.  The  testing  of  future  WCB  includes:  viability,  cell  growth,  sterility, 
mycoplasma,  identity  (isoenzyme),  adventitious  virus  (in  vitro  and  in  vivo),  bovine  virus, 
infectious  retroviruses  and  genetic  stability  (copy  number  estimation,  restriction  enzyme 
mapping, DNA sequencing and RNA integrity).  
Manufacture  
The  cell  culture  process  consists  of  four  main  stages:  (1)  thawing  of  vials  and  expansion  of 
inoculum  in  spinner  flasks,  (2)  further  expansion  of  the  seed  train  in  growth  bioreactors,  (3) 
batch production at the bioreactor scale, and (4) clarification of the harvest.  
The  purification  and  formulation  processes  consist  of  seven  unit  operations:  (1)  an  initial 
ultrafiltration/ diafiltration process, (2) an affinity capture chromatography  column, (3) a cation 
exchange  chromatography  column  run  in  conjunction  with  an  anion  exchange  chromatography 
membrane,  (4)  virus  reduction  nanofiltration  process,  (5)  a  second  ultrafiltration  /  diafiltration 
process, (6) a size exclusion chromatography column (SEC), and finally (7) formulation.  
The harvest from one production bioreactor is purified to provide one active substance batch. 
The  active  substance  is  defined  as  the  SEC  column  eluate  that  has  been  adjusted  for 
concentration to 10 mg/ml and formulated.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The  overall  alemtuzumab  process  has  a  planned  set  of  controls,  derived  from  product  and 
process understanding, which ensure consistent process performance and a resulting product of 
required  quality.  Each  step  of  the  cell  culture,  purification,  and  formulation  processes  is 
controlled  by  monitoring  critical  process  parameters  (CPPs),  intermediate  specifications  (ISs), 
and in-process controls (IPCs). 
During  the  evaluation  procedure,  upon  request,  further  information  had  been  provided  on  the 
control strategy.  
There is no animal origin components utilised in the alemtuzumab process, with the exception of 
the CHO cell-line.  
The  manufacturing  process  development  is  considered  properly  described.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the major process changes performed (extension of cell culture duration and 
change  of  media  component)  during  the  sclerosis  clinical  trials  have  not  affected  the  quality  of 
the product.  
The  manufacturing  process  was  fully  validated.  The  validation  data  demonstrate  a  consistent 
manufacturing  process.  The  validation  results  were  within  pre-defined  acceptance  criteria  and 
comparable to historical data.

Characterisation and Impurities 
Alemtuzumab  has  been  characterised  structurally  by  spectroscopic,  electrophoretic  and 
chromatographic  assays  and  characterised  functionally  by  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay 
(ELISA)  and  immunoassay.  The  characterisation  is  based  on  studies  performed  for  first  product 
of  alemtuzumab  (MabCampath),  additional  testing  and  release  analysis  of  the  present  active 
substance  and  finished  product  batches.  The  characterization  data  on  the  active  substance 
batches  and  finished  product  batches  demonstrate  that  the  manufacturing  process  results  in  a 
consistent product.  
The  complete  primary  structure  of  alemtuzumab  has  been  defined  by  a  combination  of  protein 
and  cDNA  sequencing,  amino  acid  and  carbohydrate  analysis,  carbohydrate  structure 
determination and mass spectroscopy. Carbohydrate moieties are linked to the CH2 domain at a 
single N-linked site. Mapping of proteolytic digests using reverse phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography  (RP-HPLC),  electrospray  ionisation  mass  spectrometry  (ESI-MS),  and  matrix 
assisted laser desorption ionisation–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) has demonstrated the glycoforms 
present  in  alemtuzumab.  The  secondary  and  tertiary  structure  of  alemtuzumab  has  been 
confirmed  using  circular  dichroism  spectroscopy  and  x-ray  crystallography.  The  results  are 
consistent with an antibody of the IgG class. 
Alemtuzumab  mediates  lysis  of  CD52+  lymphocytes  in  vivo  by  both  complement  mediated  cell 
lysis (CMCL) and antibody dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanisms.  
The  alemtuzumab  antigen,  designated  CD52,  is  acquired  by  cells  during  the  leukocyte 
differentiation cascade. With an apparent molecular weight of 21 to 28 kDa the mature CD52 is a 
small  but  heavily  glycosylated,  non-modulating  glycophosphatidylinositol  (GPI)-anchored 
glycoprotein.  Its  length  of  only  12  amino  acids  makes  it  one  of  the  shortest  cell-surface 
glycoproteins ever found. 
The potential process-related impurities have been identified and it has been demonstrated that 
the manufacturing process is capable of consistently reducing these impurities to very low levels. 
The omission of routine testing for the process-related impurities is considered properly justified 
by validation and long manufacturing experience.  
The  potential  product-related  impurities  include  alemtuzumab  aggregates  and  alemtuzumab 
fragments , with the desired active substance composed of alemtuzumab monomer.  
Specification 
The  release  specification  for  alemtuzumab  active  substance  include  tests  for  identity,  purity  , 
potency,  protein  content  ,  safety  (endotoxin,  bioburben),  and  physical  characteristics  (pH, 
osmolarity, appearance). 
Overall,  the  control  tests  proposed  for  active  substance  are  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q6B  and 
EMEA/CHMP/BWP/157653/2007 and are considered adequate in order to ensure sufficient quality 
with regard to identity, purity, quantity, potency and physiochemical properties. The specification 
acceptance criteria are based on historical release and stability data and data on clinical batches 
and are considered acceptable. The omission of routine testing for the process related impurities 
has been properly justified. 
The CMCL assay has been justified as suitable for potency testing also for the MS indication.

 Stability 
The proposed shelf-life for the Alemtuzumab active substance can be accepted based on stability 
data provided. 
In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines1,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Lemtrada  is  supplied  as  a  sterile,  clear,  colorless  to  slightly  yellow,  concentrate  solution  that 
must  be  diluted  prior  to  IV  infusion.  It  is  presented  as  a  single  use  vial  containing  12  mg 
alemtuzumab in 1.2 ml solution (10 mg/ml). Each 1.0 ml of concentrate solution contains 10 mg 
of  alemtuzumab,  along  with  sodium  chloride,  dibasic  sodium  phosphate,  potassium  chloride, 
potassium  dihydrogen  phosphate,  polysorbate  80,  disodium  edetate  dihydrate,  and  water  for 
injections.  
Alemtuzumab  is  administered  by  I.V.  infusion.  This  route  of  administration  requires  that  the 
solution is further diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, or 5% dextrose solution. Studies 
have been performed to evaluate finished product quality and stability in both of these solutions.  
Pharmaceutical Development 
Alemtuzumab  finished  product  is  an  isotonic  solution  for  intravenous  infusion.  The  current 
formulation  for  alemtuzumab  (10  mg/ml),  was  based  upon  the  results  of  cumulative  stability 
studies  to  determine  which  formulations  were  suitable  for  intravenous  administration  and 
exhibited a long term stability profile. 
Alemtuzumab  finished  product  was  initially  manufactured  at  a  concentration  of  10  mg/ml  and 
filled into 5 ml Type 1 glass ampoules. In order to improve product handling, a new dosage form 
was introduced in 2004 by the license holder for alemtuzumab at that time. The concentration of 
the active ingredient was increased from 10 mg/ml to 30 mg/ml and the  container closure was 
changed from the 5 ml Type I glass ampoule to a 2 ml Type I glass vial/stopper format.  
The  vial  format  was  maintained  when  the  12  mg/1.2  ml  dosage  using  the  alemtuzumab  10 
mg/ml formulation was selected for multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trials. Subsequent long term 
stability  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  10  mg/ml  formulation  in  the  12  mg  vial  format 
exhibits an acceptable stability profile. 
There  is  no  formulation  overage  incorporated  into  the  alemtuzumab  10  mg/ml.  However,  an 
overfill is added to the vial to ensure delivery of a nominal 1.2 ml dose to the patient. 
Manufacture of the product 
The  active  substance  is  defined  as  the  formulated  product  pool  containing  alemtuzumab, 
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), disodium edetate dihydrate (EDTA) and polysorbate 80.

The manufacture of alemtuzumab finished product consists of three major steps: 
1. bulk sterile filtration and aseptic filling, 
2. stoppering and capping, 
3. labelling and packaging. 
The  manufacture  is  acceptably  described  and  the  in-process  controls  are  deemed  suitable  for 
controlling  and  monitoring  the  manufacturing  process.  The  aseptic  manufacturing  process  has 
been satisfactorily validated. All validation batches complied with the established in-process and 
release  specifications  as  well  as  additional  process  monitoring  data.  No  critical  deviations  were 
observed. The results and requirements for the media fill validation is found acceptable and are 
in line with current EU requirements.  
All the excipients comply with Ph Eur requirements.  
Product Specification  
The proposed finished product specification includes general controls (colour & clarity, particulate 
matter, pH, osmolality, extractable volume and tests for excipients, as well as controls for safety 
(endotoxin,  sterility),  identity,  purity/impurity,  protein  concentration  and  potency  (Complement 
Mediated Cell Lysis).  
The proposed finished product specifications are suitable for control of the finished product. Upon 
request the limits proposed for potency have been tightened to reflect clinically qualified potency 
results.  
Many tests used for release testing of the finished product are also used for release testing of the 
active substance.  
Batch analysis data from batches used in MS indication clinical trial, non-clinical studies and for 
process  validation  are  presented.  All  data  comply  with  the  acceptance  criteria  in  the  release 
specification. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life of the finished product is 36 months at 2-8°C and is acceptable based on 
the submitted data (pilot-scale and large-scale finished product batches).  
Chemical  and  physical  In-use  stability  has  been  demonstrated  for  24  hours,  when  stored  at  2-
8ºC or at room temperature, and followed by an infusion period of 8 hours at room temperature. 
The Applicant recommends that the solution for infusion is prepared just prior to administration 
to  minimize  the  potential  for  protein  aggregate  formation  and  for  microbiological  reasons  since 
the  product  does  not  contain  preservatives.  This  recommendation  is  reflected  in  section  6.3  of 
the SmPC.

In  accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines2,  any  confirmed  out  of  specification  result,  or  significant 
negative trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and the EMA. 
Adventitious agents 
The  evaluation  of  adventitious  agents  demonstrates  presence  of  control  for  contamination  by 
mycoplasma, bacteria and fungi by adequate methods. 
The  use  of  human  and  animal  derived  components  has  been  reduced  to  bovine  albumin  for 
establishment of Working Cell Banks. Transmissible spongiform encephalitis (TSE) certificates for 
these have been provided demonstrating compliance with the TSE guideline.  
The cell banks and the manufacturing process are under control for adventitious viruses in that 
cell  banks  are  tested  for  presence  of  viruses,  and  viral  reduction  of  the  manufacturing  process 
has  been  evaluated  using  model  viruses.  The  process  contains  6  steps  contributing  to  the  viral 
clearance.  The  results  for  reduction  of  viruses  are  acceptable  and  the  company  is  actively 
pursuing future improvements.

Acceptable GMP status has been verified for the involved manufacturers. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Quality Development 
In the Quality Dossier for Lemtrada the development, characterisation, manufacture and control 
of  the  active  substance  alemtuzumab  and  the  finished  product  Lemtrada  are  adequately 
described.  No  major  objections  have  been  identified  that  would  have  precluded  a  Marketing 
authorisation.  However,  a  number  of  other  concerns  have  been  raised  and  satisfactorily 
addressed by the Applicant during the evaluation procedure. In conclusion, based on the review 
of the quality data provided, the CHMP considers that the marketing authorisation application for 
Lemtrada is approvable.   
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The  applicant  has  acceptably  resolved  all issues  identified  during  the  assessment  and  there  are 
no remaining quality issues preventing a positive opinion. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In  the  context  of  the  obligation  of  the  MAHs  to  take  due  account  of  technical  and  scientific 
progress, the CHMP has recommended some future quality developments be considered.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Alemtuzumab  is  a  recombinant  DNA-derived  humanised  monoclonal  IgG1  kappa  antibody 
directed  against  the  cell  surface  glycoprotein  CD52.  The  CD52  antigen  is  present  on  the 
surface of T and B lymphocytes and is expressed to a lesser extent on monocytes, eosinophils 
and macrophages. Low level expression is also found on mature NK cells and haematological 
stem  cells.  CD52  is  also  present  in  the  human  male  reproductive  tissues  such  as  the 
epididymis, vas deferens, and in semen. 
The  majority  of  the  toxicology  studies  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  OECD  GLP  and/or 
European Community Directives.   
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  non-clinical  pharmacology  of  alemtuzumab  was  assessed  in  a  number  of  in  vitro  and  in 
vivo studies. 
In vitro 
In  vitro  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  alemtuzumab  on 
human  cells,  including  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cell  (PBMC)  subsets  and  hematopoietic 
precursors.  
In  study  10GSTR059  investigating  the  susceptibility  of  various  myeloid  and  lymphoid  cell 
populations  to  alemtuzumab  mediated  complement-dependent  cytolysis  (CDC),  alemtuzumab 
had significant cytolytic effects on human B and T cells, with minimal effects on NK cells. This 
effect correlated with the density of CD52 on these cells. Alemtuzumab did not have significant 
complement-mediated depleting effects on monocytes, dendritic cells, basophils and lymphoid 
derived plasmacytoid dendritic cell.  
Evaluation  of  alemtuzumab  mediated  cytotoxicity  on  human  primary  T  cells  by  antibody-
dependent  cell-mediated  cytolysis  (ADCC)  and  CDC  in  study  10GSTR079  showed  significant 
CDC lysis and ADCC activity in all donors at concentrations as low as 250 ng/ml.  
In Study 10GSTR058, following alemtuzumab depletion of normal human T cells through CDC, 
an increase in the percentage of T cells with a regulatory phenotype (FoxP3+ CD4+ T cells) in 
the  remaining  live  population  was  observed  compared  to  control  antibody-exposed  cells. 
Furthermore, the alemtuzumab CDC-exposed T cells displayed functional regulatory activity as 
indicated by their lack of proliferation when stimulated with allogeneic dendritic cells and their 
ability to suppress the allogeneic response of autologous T cells. 
In  study  BPAT/91/0062,  alemtuzumab  exposure  had  no  observable  effects  on  bone  marrow 
progenitor  cells,  which  suggested  that  alemtuzumab  was  unlikely  to 
impair  early 
hematopoietic development. 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 17/116 
 
  
  
In vivo 
The  primary  pharmacodynamic  effect  evaluated  in  the  in  vivo  pharmacology  studies  was 
lymphocyte  cell  depletion.  The  studies  were  conducted  in  the  human  CD52  (huCD52) 
transgenic mouse model and in the cynomolgus monkey. In studies 07-1727 and 10-00373 in 
the  huCD52  transgenic  mouse,  for  both  single  and  repeat  dosing  and  at  dose  levels  ranging 
from  0.1  to  1  mg/kg,  depletion  of  T  and  B  cells  was  consistently  observed  at  24  hours 
following  alemtuzumab  administration.  Depletion  was  noted  in  blood  and  selected  lymphoid 
tissues (spleen and inguinal lymph nodes).  
Lymphocyte depletion was observed also in cynomolgus monkeys at doses 3 mg/kg i.v. or s.c.  
Efficacy  studies  in  animal  models  of  MS  were  not  conducted  with  alemtuzumab,  because 
clinical efficacy data were already available from clinical experience with alemtuzumab for MS 
at the time huCD52 transgenic mice were developed and characterised. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  secondary  pharmacodynamic  studies  investigated  temporal  relationship  of  lymphocyte 
depletion  and  repopulation  following  alemtuzumab  administration  and  were  conducted  in 
huCD52  transgenic  mouse  and  the  cynomolgus  monkey.    Studies  in  the  huCD52  transgenic 
mouse were also performed to characterise the release of cytokines following alemtuzumab. 
In  study  10-00283,  the  kinetics  of  alemtuzumab-mediated  depletion  and  potential 
repopulation  of  multiple  immune  cell  subsets  was  evaluated  within  a  period  of  28  days 
following  5  daily  i.v.  doses  of  alemtuzumab  in  huCD52  transgenic  mice.  The  results  showed 
that  depletion  of  total  T  cells,  T  helper  cells,  T  cytotoxic  cells  and  T  regulatory  cells in  whole 
blood persisted at D28 following a 5-day cycle of dosing. In contrast, T cell levels in the spleen 
were  similar  to  those  observed  in  control  animals  at  D28,  suggesting  that  depletion  in  the 
spleen was shorter-lived. Depletion of B cells was noted in the blood and spleen at Day 7 and 
Day 14, but no significant decrease compared to control animals was seen at Day 28 for any B 
cell  subset  evaluated.  In  cynomolgus  monkeys,  following  completion  of  a  5-day  cycle  of 
alemtuzumab,  both  B-cells  and  CD8+Tcells  recovered  to  levels  close  to  baseline  by  Day  60. 
This  recovery  to  baseline  levels  at  the  end  of  the  60-day  study  period  was  not  observed  for 
CD4+T cells. 
The  cytokine  release  was  investigated  following  a  single  i.v.  or  s.c.  administration  of 
alemtuzumab  (0.5  or  3  mg/kg)  in  heterozygous  huCD52  transgenic  mice  (5/sex/group).  The 
levels of the cytokines IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1 and TNF-α were significantly elevated especially at 
2-4 hours post-dosing. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Two  studies  were  conducted  in  the  cynomolgus  monkey  that  evaluated  the  safety 
pharmacology of alemtuzumab. A single-dose study was conducted in anaesthetised monkeys 
at doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg/kg of alemtuzumab administered over a 40 minute infusion 
period (study BPHP/92/0039). No major effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems 
were noted at 3 mg/kg. Transient and moderate hypotension and tachycardia were observed 
at  higher  dose  levels.  A  single  animal  dosed  at  30  mg/kg  exhibited  severe  hypotension  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 18/116 
 
  
  
tachycardia,  which  ultimately  resulted  in  cardiovascular  collapse  and  subsequent  respiratory 
arrest and eventually death.  
A repeat-dose study (5 daily doses) was conducted in monkeys at doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg over 
a  180  minute  infusion  period  (study  FFA00142).  In  this  study,  a  single  male  animal  had  9 
ventricular  premature  complexes.  Referring  to  ventricular  premature  complexes  as  a  normal 
variant  in  cynomolgus  monkeys,  the  applicant  concluded  that  there  were  no  apparent  or 
biologically  relevant  changes  in  heart  rate,  blood  pressure  or  qualitative  electrocardiograms 
associated with administration of alemtuzumab at any of the doses tested in this study.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  of  alemtuzumab  were  not  studied  by  the  applicant  (see 
2.3.6 Discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of alemtuzumab were assessed in single- and repeat-dose 
studies  in  huCD52  transgenic  mice,  wild-type  CD-1  mice  and  cynomolgus  monkeys. 
Alemtuzumab  pharmacokinetics  was  assessed  following  i.v.  and  s.c.  routes  of  administration 
at doses ranging from 0.5 to 10 mg/kg in the huCD52 transgenic mouse and 0.1 to 30 mg/kg 
in the cynomolgus monkey.  
Comparing  pharmacokinetics  of  alemtuzumab  following  a  single  i.v.  dose  of  1  mg/kg  in 
huCD52  transgenic  mice  vs  wild-type  CD-1  mice,  significant  differences  were  seen  for  the 
terminal  elimination  half-life  (~3-fold  shorter),  the  clearance  (~9  fold  higher),  the  volume  of 
distribution (~3 fold larger) and the AUC (~5 to 8 fold lower) in huCD52 transgenic mice. 
Single  dose  studies  with  i.v.  and  s.c.  alemtuzumab  administration  to  transgenic  mice  and 
cynomolgus  monkeys  did  not  indicate  any  significant  deviations  from  the  dose  proportional 
pharmacokinetics at the dose levels studied (0.5 and 1 mg/kg for transgenic mice and 0.3 and 
3 mg/kg for cynomolgus monkeys). The terminal elimination half-life was 34.5 to 45.3 hours 
in  transgenic  mice  and  4.6  to  6.7  days  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Bioavailability  following  s.c. 
administration  ranged  from  53.6  to  74.6%  in  transgenic  mice  and  from  60.3  to  62.9%  in 
cynomolgus monkeys.  
The  repeat-dose  pharmacokinetic  analysis  of  alemtuzumab  was  performed  in  huCD52 
transgenic  mice  following  one  cycle  of  daily  dosing  for  5  days  and  in  cynomolgus  monkeys 
following one or two cycles of daily dosing.  
In transgenic mice, results of the repeated administration (i.v. dosing of 1 mg/kg for 5 days) 
indicated  time-dependent  pharmacokinetics.  The  systemic  exposure  (AUC0-∞)  on  Day  5  was 
higher than following a single dose. This was related to a decrease in clearance and more than 
2-fold decrease in volume of distribution. These changes in pharmacokinetic parameters were 
suggested  to  be  related  to  the  decreased  target  availability  following  sustained  lymphocyte 
depletion resulting from the mechanism of action of alemtuzumab.  
The  PK  of  alemtuzumab  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  was  characterised  following  repeated  i.v. 
dosing  of  3  mg/kg/day  in  two  cycles  (administered  28  days  apart),  with  five  daily  doses  in 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 19/116 
 
  
  
Cycle  1  and  three  daily  doses  in  Cycle  2.  The  results  indicated  that  alemtuzumab  exposure 
was sustained for at least 28 days with a half-life of approximately 5 days following cycles 1 
and 2. No apparent differences in half-life, Cmax or systemic exposure were seen in this study 
between treatment cycles. 
No apparent pharmacokinetic differences were observed between female vs male cynomolgus 
monkeys  or  female  vs  male  transgenic  mice  following  single  or  repeated  doses  of 
alemtuzumab.  
Alemtuzumab  pharmacokinetics  was  also  evaluated  in  pregnant  huCD52  transgenic  mice  to 
support  the  reproductive  toxicity  studies.  Results  of  5  daily i.v. dosing  of  3 and  10  mg/kg  to 
pregnant  and  non-pregnant  transgenic  mice  indicated  that  during  pregnancy,  the  effect  of  a 
changing  body  composition  (e.g.  increase  in  plasma  volume,  total  body  water  and 
placental/foetal  growth)  led  to  changes  in  alemtuzumab  pharmacokinetics.  This  was 
characterised by faster clearance, larger volume of distribution and lower overall exposure to 
alemtuzumab.  Alemtuzumab  was  detected  in  foetuses  of  dams  treated  with  alemtuzumab 
during gestation which confirmed transfer across the placental barrier.  
Alemtuzumab was detected in the milk of lactating female mice administered 10 mg/kg for 5 
consecutive days postpartum and also in serum of their pups. 
No dedicated metabolism, excretion and PK drug interaction studies were submitted. 
Anti-alemtuzumab  antibodies  were  detected  in  one  of  the  studies  in  transgenic  mice  and  in 
several of the studies in cynomolgus monkeys. Neutralizing anti-alemtuzumab antibodies were 
observed in one animal in one of the studies in cynomolgus monkeys.

Local Tolerance  
Non-clinical local tolerance studies for alemtuzumab were not performed (see 2.3.6 Discussion 
on non-clinical aspects). In non-clinical toxicity studies, there were no serious adverse findings 
related to the injection/infusion of alemtuzumab.  
Other toxicity studies 
Several  tissue  cross-reactivity  studies  were  conducted  with  alemtuzumab  using  tissues 
obtained  from  humans,  cynomolgus  monkeys  and  huCD52  transgenic  mice.  Preliminary  data

indicated that alemtuzumab did not bind specifically to monkey spleen and lymphoid tissues. 
With respect to human tissues, alemtuzumab bound to mononuclear cells, primarily T- and B-
cell  lymphocytes,  NK  cells,  monocytes,  granulocytes  and  myeloid  cells.  Mononuclear  cell 
staining  was  present  in  all  lymphoid  organs,  mucosal  associated  lymphoid  tissue  and 
mononuclear cell infiltrates in the majority of tissues examined. No binding was observed with 
either  erythrocytes  or  platelets.  Specific  binding  was  also  observed  in  the  male  reproductive 
tract  (epididymis,  sperm,  and  seminal  vesicles)  and  the  skin.  Appropriate  positive  and 
negative tissue controls, isotype control antibody and tissue staining control were included in 
GLP-compliant  studies.  In  a  study  comparing  tissue  reactivity  between  human  and  huCD52 
transgenic mice, a generally consistent pattern was observed. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Environmental  risk  assessment  of  alemtuzumab  was  not  performed  (see  2.3.6  Discussion  on 
non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  CHMP  considered  that  in  studies  testing  human  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells, 
alemtuzumab  induced  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity  of  B  and  T  cells,  thus  supporting 
the  role  of  complement-dependent  cytotoxicity  in  the  mechanism  of  action  of  alemtuzumab. 
Cells  expressing  high  levels  of  complement-inhibitory  proteins,  such  as  monocytes  and 
basophils, may be therefore more resistant to the pharmacological effects of alemtuzumab as 
observed  in  the  in  vitro  study  10GSTR059.  In  addition,  alemtuzumab  induced  in  vitro 
cytotoxicity of human T cells by induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
ADCC  and  CDC  were  thus  considered  mechanisms  by  which  alemtuzumab  exerts  its  cytolytic 
effect on immune cells. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considered that alemtuzumab appeared to lead to an enrichment of T 
cells  with  regulatory  phenotypes,  since  the  T  cell  population  remaining  after  CDC  in  vitro 
displayed  functional  regulatory  activity  and  was  capable  of  suppressing  T  cell  responses. 
Similarly,  MS  patients  treated  with  alemtuzumab  in  clinical  studies  showed  an  increased 
percentage of T cells with a regulatory phenotype in the reconstituting T cell population. These 
data  indicated  that  alemtuzumab  could  potentially  act  to  control  autoimmune  responses  via 
lymphocyte repopulation.  
In  vivo,  significant  depletion  of  T-  and  B-cells  in  huCD52  transgenic  mice  and  cynomolgus 
monkeys  was  seen,  supporting  the  pharmacological  activity  on  human  mononuclear  cells 
observed  in  vitro.  The  CHMP  considered  that  several  studies  were  performed  to  characterise 
the distribution, expression level and consistency of human CD52 expression in the transgenic 
mouse  to  substantiate  the  suitability  of  this  model.  The  level  of  CD52  expression  on  human 
PBMCs and huCD52 transgenic mice was similar and the T and B cell responses did not appear 
to  be  affected  by  human  CD52  expression  in  mice.  Moreover,  in  both  humans  and  huCD52 
transgenic  mice,  less  depletion  of  regulatory  and  memory  T-cells  was  observed  when 
compared  to  naïve  cells.  Although  functional  differences  cannot  completely  be  excluded, 
Assessment report

heterozygous  HuCD52  transgenic  mice  were  considered  to  be  a  relevant  animal  model  for 
studying  pharmacology  of  alemtuzumab.  With  respect  to  cynomolgus  monkeys,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  although  alemtuzumab  was  pharmacologically  active  in  the  species,  the 
relevance of this species was limited due to species differences in the amino acid sequence for 
the CD52 antigen.  
The primary animal model of multiple sclerosis is experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis 
(EAE).  No  proof-of-concept  studies  in  this  model  were  conducted  by  the  applicant.  However, 
as  clinical  experience  with  alemtuzumab  in  the  treatment  of  MS  was  already  available  at  the 
time huCD52 transgenic mice were developed and characterised, the lack of these studies was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
No  dedicated  safety  pharmacology  studies  were  conducted  by  the  applicant.  Taking  into 
account  clinical  experience  with  alemtuzumab  in  cancer  patients,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view 
that this was acceptable. Nevertheless, effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems 
were evaluated in a GLP-compliant single-dose toxicity study and a non-GLP-compliant dose-
ranging  repeat-dose  study  conducted  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Cardiovascular  effects  were 
observed  in  both  studies  at  doses  of  30  mg/kg,  but  the  effects  were  only  seen  in  a  single 
animal per study. With respect to the ventricular premature complexes seen in one animal in 
the  repeat-dose  study,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  this  observation  could  be  a  normal 
variant  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  and  therefore  not  treatment-related.  None  of  the  findings 
were considered as clinically relevant. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  CHMP  considered  that  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  alemtuzumab  were  appropriately 
characterized in pharmacologically relevant animal species, i.e. huCD52 transgenic mouse and 
cynomolgus monkey, following i.v. and s.c. administration of single and repeat doses, and that 
the results provided adequate exposure information to support interpretation of the toxicology 
studies.  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  alemtuzumab  appeared  to  be  dependent  on  the  presence  of  the 
human CD52 target. Elimination was faster (higher clearance and shorter terminal elimination 
half-life)  and  the  volume  of  distribution  was  larger  in  huCD52  transgenic  mice  than  in  wild-
type  CD-1  mice.  This  suggested  that  alemtuzumab  remained  longer  in  the blood  of  the wild-
type CD-1 mice due to the lack of the human CD52 target, indicating that the primary route of 
elimination is target-mediated internalisation. 
Consistent  and  significant  differences  were  noted  for  PK  parameters  between  pregnant  and 
non-pregnant  transgenic  mice.  This  was  characterized  by  higher  clearance,  concomitant 
diminishing of the overall alemtuzumab exposure and an increase in the volume of distribution 
in  pregnant  animals.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  PK  observed  during  pregnancy  was  a 
result  of  the  transfer  across  the  placental  barrier  to  the  foetus,  as  confirmed  by  detection  of 
alemtuzumab in foetuses of dams treated during gestation. 
While  it  is  not  known  whether  alemtuzumab  is  excreted  in  human  milk,  alemtuzumab  was 
detected  in  the  milk  and  offspring  of  lactating  female  mice.  Considering  that  a  risk  to  the 
breastfed  child  cannot  be  excluded,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  breast  feeding  should  in 
general  be  discontinued  during  each  course  of  treatment  with  Lemtrada  and  for  4  months 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 25/116 
 
  
  
following the last infusion of each treatment course, as reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
This  recommendation  was  based  on  the  fact  that  the  human  serum  concentration  of 
alemtuzumab  is  low  or  undetectable  within  approximately  30  days  following  each  treatment 
course. Therefore, the 4-month window was considered to represent a conservative approach 
to avoid exposure to the infant. 
No  metabolism  and  excretion  studies  were  submitted.  As  alemtuzumab  is  a  recombinant 
humanised protein, the expected metabolic pathway is proteolysis. Thus, the CHMP considered 
lack of these studies acceptable.  
There  were  no  studies  of  pharmacodynamic  or  pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions  performed 
with  alemtuzumab.  Based  on  its  expected  metabolism  (i.e.  proteolysis),  alemtuzumab  is  an 
unlikely  candidate  for  cytochrome  P450  mediated  drug-drug  interactions  and  therefore,  no 
drug-drug interaction studies were performed. This was accepted by the CHMP. 
Anti-alemtuzumab  antibodies  were  detected  in  the  majority  of  the  animals  tested.  However, 
the  presence  of  anti-alemtuzumab  antibodies  was  not  considered  by  the  CHMP  to  have  any 
significant influence on the alemtuzumab pharmacokinetics in the studies conducted. 
Toxicology 
Single  and  repeated  dose  toxicity  studies  were  investigated  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  In  a 
previous CHMP scientific advice, the 30-day toxicity testing was considered sufficient to cover 
the  clinical  schedule  for  alemtuzumab  treatment,  i.e.  administration  on  5  consecutive  days 
followed by administration on 3 consecutive days after one year. 
With respect to the results of single and repeated dose toxicity studies, the CHMP considered 
that these should be interpreted with caution due to the low number of animals per group (i.e. 
1-2  animals/sex/group),  immunogenicity  (potentially  neutralising  the  effects  and  observed  in 
approximately half of the animals), dose-limiting toxicity (increased susceptibility to infections 
or  hypersensitivity  leading  to  lethality/early  sacrifice)  and  limitation  of  the  animal  model 
(decreased affinity of alemtuzumab for CD52 in the cynomolgus monkey). Still, the CHMP was 
of the view that the repeat-dose toxicity of alemtuzumab was sufficiently addressed from the 
pre-clinical point of view.  
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  previous  CHMP  scientific  advice  focused  also  on  the  need  for 
additional toxicity testing. In their advice, the CHMP had acknowledged that evaluating doses 
corresponding  to  a  10-fold  exposure  margin  when  compared  to  the  exposure  in  the  MS 
patients would not be feasible due to immunosuppression and severe infections. The resulting 
need  for  long-term  co-administration  of  antibiotics  had  been  considered  interfering  with 
evaluation of the toxicology profile of alemtuzumab. Overall, the CHMP had concluded that no 
further long-term repeat dose testing in cynomolgus monkey was warranted. 
The lack of genotoxicity testing was considered acceptable, as in accordance with the ICH S6 
guideline, the range and type of genotoxicity studies routinely conducted for pharmaceuticals 
are  not  applicable  to  biotechnology-derived  pharmaceuticals  and  therefore  are  not  needed. 
The  CHMP  also  considered  acceptable  that  no  carcinogenicity  testing  was  performed,  taking 
into  account  the  lack  of  an  appropriate  animal  model,  the  well-established  risk  of  indirect 
tumorigenicity  caused  by  prolonged  immunosuppression  and  the  previous  scientific  advice 
provided by the CHMP.

Reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  the  huCD52  transgenic 
mouse  model.  This  model  was  characterised  in  a  series  of  pharmacodynamic  studies. 
Cynomolgus  monkey  was  not  considered  an  appropriate  species  for  reasons  of  anti-
alemtuzumab  antibodies  developing  in  proportion  of  monkeys,  which  in  some  cases  could 
exert  a  neutralizing  activity.  The  CHMP  also  considered  that  the  studies  were  conducted  in 
compliance with the CHMP scientific advice. 
The  female  and  male  reproductive  effects  were  observed  at  exposures  significantly  below 
those  observed  in  the  clinical  setting,  following  administration  of  the  recommended 
therapeutic  dose  (based  on  Cmax).  Higher  exposure  margins  were  established  by  the 
applicant  based  on  AUC  values  obtained  in  a  PK  study.  The  use  of  these  AUC  data  yielded 
exposure margins of 1.7- to 7.1-fold.  
The  applicant  proposed  that  women  of  child-bearing  potential  should  use  effective 
contraceptive measures when receiving a course of treatment with Lemtrada and for 4 months 
following  that  course  of  treatment.  Considering  that  the  human  serum  concentration  of 
alemtuzumab  is  low  or  undetectable  within  approximately  30  days  following  each  treatment 
course,  this  conservative  approach,  agreed  to  be  applied  also  to  breast-feeding,  was 
considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
CD52  is  known  to  be  present  in  human  as  well  as  rodent  reproductive  tissues.  The  CHMP 
considered  that  effects  on  fertility  were  seen  in  humanised  mice,  but  was  of  the  view  that  a 
potential impact on human fertility during the period of exposure was unknown based on the 
available data. 
No gross external, soft tissue or skeletal foetal alterations were observed when alemtuzumab 
was dosed GD6 through 10 or GD11 through 15 to humanized CD52 transgenic pregnant mice 
mated  with  wild-type  CD-1  male  mice.  Increase  in  the  number  of  dams  with  all  conceptuses 
dead  or  resorbed  and  a  reduction  in  the  number  of  dams  with  viable  foetuses  occurred  in 
animals exposed to 10 mg/kg/day alemtuzumab during GD 11 through 15. The CHMP was of 
the opinion that the clinical relevance of these findings in transgenic mice was not known.  
The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 10 mg/kg/day for alemtuzumab when administered 
for  GDs  6  to  10  and  3  mg/kg/day  when  alemtuzumab  on  GD11  through  15.  Based  on  Cmax 
values, the exposures were significantly below those observed in the clinical setting, following 
administration  of  the  recommended  therapeutic  dose.  Higher  exposure  margins  were 
established  by  the  applicant  based  on  AUC  values  obtained  in  a  PK  study.  The  use  of  these 
AUC data yielded exposure margins of 0.6- to 4.4-fold.  
The effects of peri-natal/post-natal administration of alemtuzumab were evaluated in huCD52 
transgenic  mice  including  a  post-natal  functional  immune  evaluation.  Alemtuzumab  was 
present  in  serum  of  both  the  F0  and  F1  generation  and  in  milk  from  the  F0  generation.  As 
expected  based  on  the  mode  of  action  of  alemtuzumab,  alterations  in  lymphocyte  numbers 
and  sub-populations  were  observed  during  each  period  of  immune  development  evaluated. 
However,  only  subtle  effects  on  the  humoral  immune  response  of  unclear  clinical  relevance 
(decreased IgM response without an effect on IgG) were observed. 
Overall, the CHMP considered that the non-clinical data on reproductive toxicity are adequately 
reflected in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 27/116 
 
  
  
With  respect  to  the  local  tolerance  testing,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that  alemtuzumab  is 
administered by i.v. infusion following dilution and does not include concentrations of irritants 
or corrosive components likely to lead to serious reactions at the injection site. Therefore the 
lack  of  dedicated  local  tolerance  toxicity  studies  was  accepted.  Furthermore,  the  absence  of 
serious adverse findings related to the injection/infusion of alemtuzumab in nonclinical toxicity 
studies was considered re-assuring. 
The  lack  of  an  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  was  deemed  acceptable  in  accordance 
with the current guidance. Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody and therefore, it is exempt 
from  the  ERA  requirements,  as  proteins  are  considered  not  to  pose  significant  risks  to  the 
environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall,  the  non-clinical  properties  of  Lemtrada  were  adequately  documented  and  met  the 
requirements to support this application.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  alemtuzumab  were  evaluated  in  a  total  of  216  patients  (19  in 
CAMMS223,  57  in  CAMMS323  and  140  in  CAMMS324)  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple 
sclerosis  (RRMS)  who  received  either 12  mg/day  (157  patients  in  studies  223,  323  and  324) 
or 24 mg/day (59 patients in studies 223 and 324) for 5 days, followed by 3 days of treatment 
12 months after the initial treatment cycle.  The results of the Phase 2 and 3 studies showed 
consistent  trends  in  alemtuzumab  pharmacokinetics.  Serum  concentrations  increased  with 
each  consecutive  dose  within  a  treatment  course,  with  the  highest  observed  concentrations 
occurring  following  the  last  infusion  of  a  treatment  course.   Administration  of  12 mg/day 
resulted  in  a  mean  Cmax  of  3014 ng/ml  on  Day  5  of  the  initial  treatment  course,  and 
2276 ng/ml on Day 3 of the second treatment course. The functional half-life approximated 5 
days and  was  comparable  between  courses 
leading  to 
low  or  undetectable  serum 
concentrations within approximately 30 days following each treatment course. 
Absorption 
No studies of bioavailability were conducted, as alemtuzumab is administered intravenously.  
The  composition  of  the  to-be-marketed  formulation  is  the  same  as  that  used  in  the  clinical 
trials in multiple sclerosis and the same as the previously approved formulation used in the B-
CLL indication. Therefore, no bioequivalence studies were performed by the applicant. 
Distribution 
Based on the population PK analysis, the central volume of distribution (V1) was proportional 
to  body  weight  and  approximated  the  extracellular  fluid  volume  (14.1  l),  suggesting  that 
alemtuzumab  was  largely  confined  to  the  blood  and  interstitial  space.  The  inter-subject 
variability for V1 was approximately 26 %.  
The peripheral volume (V2) was estimated to be 16.2 l.  
Elimination 
Classical  biotransformation  studies  were  not  conducted.  Alemtuzumab  is  a  large-molecule 
monoclonal antibody and as such it is cleared primarily through target-mediated clearance and 
through  simple  non-target  specific  IgG  clearance  mechanisms.  Alemtuzumab  is  not  excreted 
renally or eliminated via cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes.  
Clearance  of  alemtuzumab  ranged  from  0.012  –  0.096  l/h  depending  on  study,  dose  group 
and  anti-alemtuzumab  antibody  status.  The  inter-subject  variability  for  clearance  was  large 
(58 %). Higher clearance values were observed in cycle 1 compared to cycle 2, the decrease 
in clearance from cycle 1 to cycle 2 being less than 20%.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In studies CAMMS223 and CAMMS 324 which tested doses of 12 mg and 24 mg, the observed 
alemtuzumab concentrations suggested dose proportionality in both cycle 1 and cycle 2. When

comparing  the  estimated  exposure  data  in  anti-alemtuzumab  negative  patients,  there  was  a 
trend towards a less than proportional increase.  
Special populations 
No dedicated studies in special populations were conducted. The small number of patients with 
mild  renal  impairment  and  absence  of  patients  with  more  severe  renal  dysfunction  in  the 
clinical  programme  precluded  assessment  of  the  influence  of  renal  impairment  on 
alemtuzumab PK.  
75% of the patients had normal values of the hepatic function parameters measured (alkaline 
phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin). Several patients had values above 
the upper limit of normal, but when evaluated as covariates in the population PK analysis, no 
impact on alemtuzumab PK was found.  
No effect on gender and race was observed in the population PK analysis. 
The maximum age in the patient population was 53 years, precluding evaluation of impact of 
higher age on alemtuzumab PK. Alemtuzumab was not investigated in children. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  drug-drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  (see  Discussion  on  clinical 
pharmacology 2.4.4).  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Alemtuzumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody (IgG1 kappa) which binds to CD52, a cell 
surface antigen present at high levels on T (CD3+) and B (CD19+) lymphocytes, and at lower 
levels on natural killer cells, monocytes and macrophages. There is little or no CD52 detected 
on  neutrophils,  plasma  cells,  or  bone  marrow  stem  cells.    Alemtuzumab  acts  through 
antibody-dependent  cellular  cytolysis  and  complement-mediated  lysis  following  cell  surface 
binding to T and B lymphocytes.  
The  mechanism  by  which  alemtuzumab  exerts  its  therapeutic  effects  in  MS  is  not  fully 
elucidated. However, research suggests immunomodulatory effects through the depletion and 
repopulation of lymphocytes, including: 
-  Alterations  in  the  number,  proportions,  and  properties  of  some  lymphocyte  subsets  post-
treatment 
- Increased representation of regulatory T cell subsets 
- Increased representation of memory T- and B-lymphocytes 
-  Transient  effects  on  components  of  innate  immunity  (i.e.,  neutrophils,  macrophages,  NK 
cells) 
Assessment report

The  reduction  in  the  level  of  circulating  B  and  T  cells  by  alemtuzumab  and  subsequent 
repopulation  may  reduce  the  potential  for  relapse,  which  ultimately  delays  disease 
progression. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Alemtuzumab  depleted  circulating  T  and  B  cells  after  each  treatment  cycle  with  the  lowest 
values typically occurring at the first post-treatment assessment, which was after one month 
in the Phase 3 studies (and as early as two days after the end of the first treatment cycle in 
the phase 2 study).  Lymphocyte repopulation appeared to occur at about the same rate after 
each treatment cycle (Figure 1) and the nadir and degree of repopulation following the second 
cycle  was  comparable  to  the  first,  with  no  indication  that  effects  of  alemtuzumab  on 
lymphocytes  were  cumulative.    Similar  patterns  of  lymphocyte  depletion  and  repopulation 
were generally observed for the 24 mg/day dose groups as compared to the 12 mg/day dose 
groups.

alemtuzumab at month 0 and month 12 in CAMMS323 and CAMMS324 
Lymphocytes  repopulated  after  depletion,  with  the  time  to  reach  repopulation  milestones 
varying  by  lymphocyte  subset.    Approximately  40%  and  80%  of  patients  receiving  the 
12 mg/day  dose  had  total  lymphocyte  counts  reaching  the  LLN  by  6  and  12  months, 
respectively, after each treatment cycle.  Approximately 10 to 20% of patients had CD3+ and 
CD4+  counts  reaching  the  LLN  by  12  months  after  each  treatment  cycle  in  the  Phase  3 
studies.  The proportion of patients with CD8+ repopulation over time was similar to that for 
total lymphocytes, with approximately 50% of patients having CD8+ counts reaching the LLN 
by  9  months  following  each  cycle.    Almost  all  patients  (≥85%)  had  CD19+  counts  that 
reached  LLN  by  6  months  following  a  treatment  cycle.    NK  cells  were  reduced  to  a  lesser

extent  than  T  and  B  cells,  with  mean  cell  counts  remaining  within  the  normal  range,  which 
may relate to the greater expression of CD52 antigen on T and B lymphocytes as compared to 
NK cells.   
PK/PD  models  were  developed  for  CD3+  lymphocytes,  CD19+  lymphocytes  and  total 
lymphocytes.    Only  anti-alemtuzumab  antibody  status  had  a  significant  effect  on  total 
lymphocyte count, however the inter-individual variability was large (> 70 %CV).  
The  observed  total  lymphocyte  count  by  observed  anti-alemtuzumab  antibody  status  for  the 
first 100 days after dosing is presented in Figure 2.

Components  of  the  innate  immune  system  such  as  neutrophils,  monocytes,  eosinophils, 
basophils and natural killer cells were only transiently affected by alemtuzumab. 
Immunogenicity 
The  majority  of  patients  (691/811,  85.2%)  treated  with  12 mg/day  alemtuzumab  in  the 
pooled  Phase  3  studies  tested  positive  for  anti-alemtuzumab  antibodies.    Of  the  85.2%  of 
patients  who  tested  positive  for  anti-alemtuzumab  antibodies  at  any  time-point  during  the 
course of the study, 92.2% (637/691) tested positive for inhibitory antibodies.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In  general,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  data  available  adequately  characterised  the 
pharmacology profile alemtuzumab.  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  alemtuzumab  was  mainly  investigated  based  on  a  population  PK 
modelling,  analysing  patient  data  from  one  phase  II  study  and  two  phase  III  studies  (216 
patients in total).  
The population pharmacokinetics was best  described by a linear, 2-compartment model. This 
was  in  contrast  to  what  was  previously  seen  with  alemtuzumab  in  B-CLL  patients.  In  those 
patients, non-linear kinetics was observed, most likely due to their tumour burden and higher 
numbers of lymphocytes, since the target-mediated elimination of alemtuzumab might change 
with the tumour burden decrease and lymphocyte concentration decrease over time.  
No  studies  of  bioavailability  were  conducted,  as  alemtuzumab  is  to  be  administered 
intravenously.  Furthermore,  since  the  to-be-marketed  formulation  is  the  same  as  the 
formulation  used  in  the  clinical  studies,  no  bioequivalence  studies  were  performed.  This  was 
agreed by the CHMP. 
Alemtuzumab is a biotechnologically synthesized IgG1 monoclonal antibody and therefore, its 
Assessment report

metabolism  is  expected  to  follow  the  IgG1  metabolism  pathway.  No  investigation  of  the 
metabolism was considered necessary by the CHMP. 
With  respect  to  elimination,  systemic  clearance  was  observed  to  be  influenced  by  the 
lymphocyte count: larger clearance values were observed in cycle 1 compared to cycle 2.  This 
decrease  in  clearance  was  considered  to  be  attributed  to  the  loss  of  CD52  antigen  in  the 
periphery. However, the decrease from cycle 1 to cycle 2 was less than 20%, despite a larger 
difference in lymphocyte count. Overall, the CHMP was of the view that this finding would not 
have any clinically significant impact on the dosing regimen of alemtuzumab.  
The large inter-subject variability for clearance was probably due to differences in lymphocyte 
counts and available CD52+ antigen. 
No  significant  differences  in  the  PK  of  alemtuzumab  were  identified  in  special  populations 
based on the performed covariate analysis. However, several shortcomings were identified in 
the proposed PK model limiting the possibility to draw conclusions about the PK and potential 
covariate effects, e.g. effect of gender and race on the pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab.  
The CHMP considered that alemtuzumab was not studied in sufficient numbers of patients with 
impairment  of  renal  or  hepatic  function.  However,  given  the  metabolism  and  elimination  of 
alemtuzumab  (IgG1  antibody),  renal  and  hepatic  impairment  were  considered  to  have  a 
limited influence on the pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab.  
While no effect on gender and race was observed in the population PK analysis, the population 
PK  model  was  not  considered  qualified  by  the  CHMP  and  thus,  the  effect  of  these  two 
covariates on the PK of alemtuzumab could not be concluded. 
With respect to age, the CHMP considered that the pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab was not 
studied  in  patients  aged  55  years  and  older.  Nevertheless,  given  that  neither  the  liver  nor 
kidney are involved in elimination, impact on the PK of alemtuzumab in the older patients was 
seen  as  limited.  No  data  in  the  paediatric  population  were  available  at  the  time  of  the  initial 
marketing authorisation application. A deferral to performing a clinical trial in patients aged 10 
to less than 18 years was granted and a waiver applies to population from birth to less than 
10 years of age. 
Considering  the  short  duration  of  drug  administration  and  as  no  direct  P450-mediated  drug-
drug  interactions  would  be  expected  with  alemtuzumab,  the  CHMP  accepted  that  no  formal 
interaction  studies  were  conducted.  In  addition,  a  wide  range  of  medications  were 
administered  concomitantly  with  alemtuzumab  in  clinical  studies  without  any  apparent  drug-
drug interactions being observed, which was considered reassuring by the CHMP. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  mechanism  by  which  alemtuzumab  exerts  its  therapeutic 
effects  in  multiple  sclerosis  is  not  fully  elucidated.  However,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  that 
immunomodulatory  effects  through  the  depletion  and  repopulation  of  lymphocytes  might  be 
involved  in  mediating  the  therapeutic  activity  of  alemtuzumab  in  MS  patients.  In  particular, 
the  reduction  in  the  level  of  circulating  B  and  T  cells  by  alemtuzumab  and  subsequent 
repopulation  may  reduce  the  potential  for  relapse,  which  could  ultimately  delay  disease 
progression. 
Alemtuzumab  was  seen  to  rapidly  deplete  circulating  T  and  B  lymphocytes  after  each 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 35/116 
 
  
  
treatment  cycle  with  the  lowest  values  occurring  at  the  first  post-treatment  assessment. 
Lymphocytes  repopulated  after  depletion,  with  the  time  to  reach  repopulation  varying  by 
lymphocyte  subset.  Overall,  no  apparent  differences  were  seen  between  the  24  mg/day  and 
12  mg/day  dose  levels  in  the  pharmacodynamic  response  (depletion  and  repopulation  of 
lymphocytes)  as  measured  in  peripheral  blood,  despite  the  expectedly  higher  serum 
concentrations of alemtuzumab observed after administration of the higher dose.  
Approximately  40%  and  80%  of  patients  had  total lymphocyte  counts  reaching  the  LLN  by  6 
and 12 months, respectively, after each treatment cycle. 50% of patients had CD8+ reaching 
the lower limit of normal within 9 months. However, CD3+ and CD4+ repopulated slower and 
did  only  reach  the  LLN  within  12  months  in  10-20  %  of  patients.  The  CHMP  considered  that 
due  to  the  lack  of  CD4+  cells,  an  increase  in  infections  would  be  expected,  but  this  was  not 
seen  in  the  safety  database.  Of  note,  in  clinical  studies,  oral  prophylaxis  (acyclovir  200  mg 
BID) 
for  herpes 
infection  was  administered  1  month  post-treatment.  Prophylactic 
administration  of  antiviral  medication  for  herpes  infection,  starting  on  the  first  day  of  each 
treatment  course  and  continuing  for  a  minimum  of  one  month,  was  also  considered  as  an 
appropriate risk minimisation measure and was reflected in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The CHMP considered the effect of anti-alemtuzumab antibody status on the total lymphocyte 
count. The observed total lymphocyte count versus time by antibody status indicated that the 
decrease in counts was less for patients with positive status. The median individual minimum 
total  lymphocyte  count  for  anti-alemtuzumab  antibody  positive  records  was  0.21x109  and 
0.08x109  for  negative  records.  Considering  that  lymphocyte  counts  started  at  approximately 
1.0x109  to  4.0x109  at  time  0,  the  reduction  in  lymphocyte  count  following  alemtuzumab 
administration  was  substantial  regardless  of  anti-alemtuzumab  antibody  status.  Therefore, 
despite  the  large  inter-individual  variability,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  impact  on 
lymphocyte counts should not pose a problem, as all patients would be expected to have their 
lymphocytes  cleared  within  one  month.  During  lymphocyte  repopulation  the  profiles  of  the 
counts were approximately the same and there was no apparent difference by dose group. 
With  respect  to  immunogenicity,  the  CHMP  considered  that  more  than  60  %  of  patients  in 
cycle  1  and  more  than  80  %  in  cycle  2  had  detectable  anti-alemtuzumab  antibodies  after  1 
month of treatment in the 12 mg dose group. The number had declined to 29 % by month 12 
in cycle 1 and to 75 % in cycle 2. Most patients with anti-alemtuzumab antibodies also tested 
positive for anti-alemtuzumab inhibitory antibodies. Almost 87 % of patients were positive for 
inhibitory  antibodies  1  month  after  treatment  in  cycle  1  and  almost  94  %  after  1  month  in 
cycle  2.  Whereas  only  2  %  of  patients  were  positive  for  anti-alemtuzumab  inhibitory 
antibodies  at  month  12,  41.5  %  were  positive  at  month  24.  While  these  findings  were 
indicative  of  some  sort  of  boosting  for  both  the  anti-alemtuzumab  antibodies  and  the  anti-
alemtuzumab inhibitory antibodies in cycle 2 compared to cycle 1, the CHMP was of the view 
that this had no impact on the depletion or repopulation of the lymphocytes. 
In conclusion, no notable differences in T or B lymphocyte depletion by dose-level, treatment 
cycle,  antibody  status  or  titer  were  seen,  suggesting  that  anti-alemtuzumab  or  inhibitory 
antibodies  did  not  impact  depletion  of  these  lymphocyte  subsets.  Lymphocyte  repopulation 
was also unaffected by anti-alemtuzumab or inhibitory antibody status. 
With respect to potential pharmacodynamics interactions, the CHMP considered that the ability 
Assessment report

to generate an immune response to any vaccine following treatment initiation was not studied 
and  highlighted  that  patients  should  complete  local  immunization  requirements  at  least  6 
weeks  prior  to  treatment  with  alemtuzumab.  Furthermore,  as  alemtuzumab  was  not 
administered  in  MS  concomitantly  with/  or  following  antineoplastic  or  immunosuppressive 
therapies, the potential combined effects on the patient’s immune system should be taken into 
account  when  considering  administration  of  alemtuzumab.  These  considerations  were 
adequately reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data submitted were considered satisfactory. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No  formal  dose-finding  studies  in  the  indication  of  multiple  sclerosis  were  conducted  for 
alemtuzumab. The dosing in pilot investigator-sponsored MS studies was guided by historical 
data from oncology use and by pilot studies in patients with rheumatologic disorders.  The MS 
pilot studies suggested that 1 or 2 pulsed cycles of 20 mg/day alemtuzumab (total dose of 100 
mg  in  cycle  1  and  60  mg  in  cycle  2)  significantly  suppressed  relapses  and  cerebral 
inflammation  (measured  by  MRI)  for  at  least  6  years  (Coles,  2004,  Clin  Neurol  Neurosurg).  
The subsequent selection of the dose and dosing regimen used in the later clinical programme 
of the applicant was based on these empirical observations. 
The  two  alemtuzumab  dose  levels  (12  mg/day  and  24  mg/day)  used  in  the  initial  three-year 
treatment period of the Phase 2 CAMMS223 study bracketed the 20 mg/day pilot study dose in 
MS  patients  and  were  selected  to  evaluate  any  dose-dependent  relationship  in  terms  of 
efficacy or safety.  The alemtuzumab cycle 2 dose regimen was calculated as 60% of the initial 
cycle 1 dose, i.e. a 3-day cycle instead of 5 days. This was done in consideration of the data 
from  the  pilot  studies  where  lymphocytes  did  not  repopulate  to  baseline levels, i.e.  at Month 
12 after treatment (compared with baseline) reduced lymphocyte levels were seen. 
In  CAMMS223,  both  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  and  24  mg/day  were  more  effective  than 
subcutaneous (SC) interferon beta-1a (IFNB-1a). The efficacy results for the alemtuzumab 12 
mg/day  and  24  mg/day  doses  were  compared  for  all  endpoints.  The  two  doses  showed 
generally comparable efficacy, with non-statistically significant differences in favour of the 24 
mg/day  dose  over  the  12  mg/day  dose  in  most  clinical  endpoints  (i.e.,  relapse  reduction, 
EDSS change from baseline and MSFC), and on reduction in brain atrophy. 
Dose  selection  for  the  Phase  3  studies  was  based  on  the  clinical  data  from  CAMMS223.  In 
study CAMMS323, which included a similar treatment-naïve patient population to the Phase 2 
study  CAMMS223,  only  the  lower  12  mg/day  dose  was  used.  Study  CAMMS324  was  initiated 
with both the 12 mg/day and 24 mg/day doses, since patients in this study had an inadequate 
response  to  prior  MS  therapy  and  were  considered  potentially  similarly  less  responsive  to 
alemtuzumab.  Enrolment in the 24 mg/day arm in CAMMS324 was subsequently closed by a

protocol amendment in order to reduce the overall sample size, the duration of the enrolment 
period  and  the  overall  duration  of  the  study,  but  this  decision was  not  driven  by  any  interim 
data  analysis  from  the  Phase  3  programme  and  the  applicant  remained  blinded  to  efficacy 
data at all times during the decision-making process.   
The  CHMP  conclusions  regarding  absence  of  formal  dose-finding  studies  are  summarised  in 
section 2.6.3 Discussion on clinical efficacy. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
CAMMS323 - A phase 3 randomized, rater-blinded study comparing two annual cycles 
of  intravenous  alemtuzumab  to  three-times  weekly  subcutaneous  interferon  beta-1a 
(Rebif)  in  treatment-naive  patients  with  relapsing-remitting  multiple  sclerosis 
(RRMS) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
To be eligible to participate in the study, patients had to present with early, active RRMS. These 
patients were defined as ambulatory patients with an EDSS score between 0 and 3, who had first 
onset of MS symptoms within 5 years prior to study entry and at least two clinical episodes of MS 
in  the  prior  two  years  and  at  least  one  in  the  prior  year.  Patients  meeting  any  of  the  following 
criteria could not be enrolled: any progressive form of MS, history of malignancy, CD4+, CD8+, 
B  cell  or  absolute  neutrophil  count  <  lower  limit  of  normal  (LLN)  at  screening,  known  bleeding 
disorder, significant autoimmune disease, presence of anti-TSHR antibodies and active infection/ 
high  risk  of  infection.  Prior  or  concomitant  use  of  therapy  for  MS  other  than  corticosteroid  and 
prior exposure to immunosuppressive agents were not allowed. 
Treatments 
Alemtuzumab was administered by daily i.v. infusions of approximately 2-4 h duration. At Month 
0, alemtuzumab was administered IV over 5 consecutive days at a fixed total dose of 60 mg (12 
mg/day),  and  at  Month  12,  alemtuzumab  was  administered  over  3  consecutive  days  at  a  fixed 
total  dose  of  36  mg  (12  mg/day).  Premedication  with  methylprednisolone  (1  g  IV)  immediately 
prior  to  alemtuzumab  administration  was  required  on  the  first  3  days  of  any  treatment  cycle. 
Further  to  a  protocol  amendment,  all  alemtuzumab  patients  received  acyclovir  200  mg  twice 
daily  (or  a  therapeutic  equivalent)  starting  on  the  first  day  of  each  alemtuzumab  cycle  and 
continuing for 28 days after the last day.  
The  comparator  used  in  the  trial  was Rebif  (IFNB-1a).  Following  initial  dose  titration  as per  the 
prescribing information, IFNB-1a was self-administered at 44 μg tiw, i.e. in a total weekly dose of 
132  μg.  The  dose  could  be  decreased  based  on  patient  tolerance.  All  patients  received  IV 
methylprednisolone (1 g/day) on Days 1, 2 and 3 at Month 0 and 12.  
On-study  relapses  could  be  treated  with  corticosteroids  at  the  discretion  of  the  Treating 
Neurologist.  A  standardized  regimen  of  methylprednisolone  was  strongly  recommended  as 
follows:  1  g  of  methylprednisolone  administered  by  IV  over  approximately  1  hour,  daily  for  3 
consecutive days.

Objectives 
The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  compare  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  two  annual  cycles  of 
intravenous alemtuzumab to 3-times weekly subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in treatment-naïve 
patients with RRMS who had recent MS disease activity as demonstrated by clinical relapses. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  active-controlled  phase  3  studies  utilized  the  co-primary  efficacy  endpoints  of  MS  relapse 
rate  and  time  to  SAD  (6-month  criteria).  Secondary  endpoints  included  imaging  findings  (MRI) 
along  with  additional  relapse  and  disability  endpoints.  Definitions  of  the  co-primary  and 
secondary endpoints are provided in Table 11.

With  respect  to  imaging,  the  following  endpoints  were  evaluated  as  tertiary:  %  change  in  T1-
hypointense  lesion  volume,  %  change  in  brain  parenchymal  fraction,  new  or  enlarging  T2-

hyperintense  lesion  counts,  Gd-enhancing  lesion  counts,  new  T1-hypointense  lesion  counts  and 
conversion of Gd-enhancing lesions to new T1-hypointense lesions. 
The  efficacy  assessments  also  comprised  a  number  of  additional  exploratory  and  tertiary 
endpoints, including quality of life parameters (FAMS, SF-36 and EQ-5D).  
Sample size 
Approximately  525  patients  were  to  be  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  2  annual  cycles  of  12 
mg/day  alemtuzumab  or  tiw  s.c.  injections  of  IFNB-1a.  This  sample  size  was  estimated  to 
provide  ≥95%  power  to  detect  the  expected  treatment  effect  in  the  2  co-primary  endpoints  of 
relapse rate and time to SAD. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomized  to  alemtuzumab  or  IFNB-1a  using  an  interactive  voice  response 
system  (IVRS).  Treatment  assignment  was  at  a  ratio  of  2:1  for  alemtuzumab  or  IFNB-1a.  The 
randomisation was stratified by centre using blocks of fixed size (3 in each block). The block size 
was not revealed to clinical sites until after database lock. 
Blinding (masking) 
The phase 3 studies were conducted as rater-blinded, since the choice of Rebif (SC IFNB-1a) as 
an  active  comparator  precluded  a  double-blinded  study  design.  Rebif  44  μg  is  commercially 
available  only  in  proprietary  prefilled  syringes  preventing  the  possibility  to  create  a  matching 
placebo.  Furthermore,  there  are  substantial  differences  between  alemtuzumab  and  Rebif  in 
timing  and  mode  of  administration  (yearly  i.v.  infusions  versus  s.c.  injections  3  tiw)  and  safety 
profiles  (infusion-associated  reactions  versus  injection  site  reactions  and  flu-like  symptoms). 
Therefore,  the  studies  were  rater-blinded  and  designed  to  minimise  the  potential  impact  of 
treating physicians and patients being aware of treatment assignment. Key efficacy assessments 
were  performed  by  trained  EDSS  and  MSFC  raters  who  were  blinded  to  treatment  assignments 
and  had  no  access  to  patient  study  data.  The  integrity  of  rater  blinding  was  preserved  by 
training,  specific  documentation  and  procedures  regarding  the  blinding  of  efficacy  assessments 
and education of patients regarding their role in maintaining the study blind. 
Analyses of the relapse co-primary endpoint and all other relapse-related endpoints in the Phase 
3  studies  were  based  on  relapse  determinations  made  by  a  blinded  Relapse  Adjudication  Panel 
(RAP)  of  independent  neurologists  with  expertise  in  MS  clinical  research.  All  cranial  MRIs  were 
evaluated  by  neuro-radiologists  at  an  independent  central  facility  with  no  access  to  patients’ 
treatment  assignment  and  the  results  of  these  evaluations  were  not  provided  to  study  sites. 
Finally, there was limited access to study data for personnel of the study sponsor. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy  was  evaluated  using  the  full  analysis  set  of  all  patients  who  were  randomized  to 
treatment  and  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug.  Patients  were  compared  for  efficacy 
according to the treatment they were randomized to receive, irrespective of the treatment they 
actually received. 
The  same  endpoints  and  statistical  methodology  were  used  for  the  primary  and  secondary 
efficacy analyses in both of the Phase 3 studies. The primary efficacy analysis (evaluation of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 41/116 
 
  
  
co-primary efficacy endpoints of relapse rate and time to SAD) was conducted on all patients in 
the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day and IFNB-1a groups and was adjusted for multiple comparisons via 
the Hochberg method. Using the Hochberg method, each study was to be considered to have met 
its  primary  efficacy  objective  if  the  p-values  corresponding  to  the  analysis  of  the  primary 
endpoints  satisfied  at  least  1  of  the  following  conditions:  the  maximum  of  the  2  p-values  is 
≤0.05; the minimum of the 2 p-values is ≤0.025. Therefore, each study would be considered to 
have  met  its  primary  efficacy  objective  if  a  statistically  significant  difference  between 
alemtuzumab and IFNB-1a was observed in time to SAD or relapse rate. 
The comparison of the relapse rate co-primary endpoint used the proportional means model with 
treatment  group  indicator  and  geographic  region  as  covariates.  Annualized  relapse  rate  (ARR) 
was estimated using negative binomial regression.  
The  comparison  of  the  SAD  co-primary  endpoint  used  a  Cox  proportional  hazards  regression 
model with treatment group indicator and geographic region as covariates. 
Hypothesis testing for the secondary efficacy analyses was performed using a hierarchical closed 
testing procedure with the following rank order:  
(1) Proportion of patients who were relapse free at Year 2  
(2) Change from baseline in EDSS 
(3) Per cent change from baseline in MRI-T2-hyperintense lesion volume at Year 2  
(4) Acquisition of disability as measured by the MSFC.  
Hypothesis  testing  proceeded  from  the  highest  rank  (1)  to  lowest  rank  (4)  and  if  nominal 
statistical  significance  (p≤0.05)  was  not  achieved  at  an  endpoint,  then  endpoints  of  lower  rank 
were  not  formally  tested.  For  descriptive  purposes,  estimated  treatment  effects,  confidence 
intervals (CIs) and nominal p-values (i.e. not adjusted for multiple comparisons) were presented 
and statistical significance was noted  when the nominal p-values were <0.05, regardless of the 
outcome of the closed testing procedure. 
The comparison of the proportion of patients relapse free at Year 2 was performed using a Cox 
proportional  hazards  regression  model  with  robust  variance  estimation.  Treatment  effects  with 
respect  to  the  change  from  baseline  in  EDSS  and  MSFC  were  compared  using  the  Wei-Lachin 
method  for  the  non-parametric  analysis  of  repeated  measures  and  the  per  cent  change  in  T2-
hyperintense  lesion  volume  from  baseline  to  Year  2  was  compared  using  a  ranked  analysis  of 
covariates (ANCOVA) model. 
In both phase 3 studies, for assessment of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and other time-to-
event  endpoints,  patients  were  censored  at  their  last  visit  if  the  respective  event  (e.g.  SAD  or 
relapse)  had  not  occurred.  For  the  assessment  of  continuous,  repeated  measures  efficacy 
endpoints  (e.g.  change  from  baseline  in  EDSS),  missing  at  random  was  assumed  and  methods 
appropriate  to  the  assumption  were  used.  For  the  assessment  of  change  from  baseline  to  a 
specific time-point (e.g., per cent change from baseline in MRI T2-hyperintense lesion volume at 
Year 2), the last post-treatment observation was used for the analysis if data were missing. For 
the assessment of binary or categorical efficacy endpoints, the last known post-treatment status 
of the efficacy measure was used for the analysis if data were missing.

Conduct of the study 
There were five amendments to the protocol introduced during the conduct of the study. The key 
changes  included  measures  implemented  in  reaction  to  occurrence  of  safety  events,  ensuring 
patient safety and allowing for collection of information related to risk detection and minimisation 
activities. Additional measures were implemented to improve blinding.

A  total  of  581  patients  (195  IFNB-1a;  386  alemtuzumab)  were  randomized  in  this  study.  563 
patients  (187  IFNB-1a;  376  alemtuzumab)  were  treated  and  included  in  both  the  Full  Analysis 
Set used for the primary efficacy analyses and the Safety set (Table 14).

Outcomes and estimation 
Relapse 
Two annual cycles of alemtuzumab treatment resulted in a statistically significant 55% reduction 
in  relapse  rate  compared  with  IFNB-1a  (p<0.0001),  meeting  the  relapse  co-primary  endpoint, 
and  satisfying  the  predefined  protocol  criteria  for  declaring  that  this  study  met  its  efficacy 
objective.  The  estimated  ARR  through  two  years  was  0.18  for  alemtuzumab  versus  0.39  for 
IFNB-1a (Table 15).

The  superior  effect  of  alemtuzumab  on  relapse  reduction  was  statistically  significant  within  six 
months of initiating treatment and was maintained throughout the study period (Figure 4). 
Figure 4 Cumulative plot of relapse rate 
Compared  with  IFNB-1a,  alemtuzumab  reduced  the  relapse  rate  by  53%  in  Year  1  and  57%  in 
Year 2 Figure 5. 
Figure 5 – Annualised relapse rate (ARR) by time interval: Full analysis set 
Alemtuzumab significantly increased the proportion of patients who were relapse free through 2 
years compared with IFNB-1a. At Year 2, 78% of alemtuzumab versus 59% of IFNB-1a-treated 
patients  remained  relapse  free,  which  represents  a  55%  reduction  in  the  risk  of  relapse  over  2 
years (Figure 6).

Disability 
During  the  2-year  follow-up,  8.0%  of  alemtuzumab-treated  patients  and  11.1%  of  IFNB-1a-
treated patients experienced 6-month SAD, but the difference between the treatment groups in 
the risk of SAD was not statistically significant (p=0.2173) and therefore, the study did not meet 
this co-primary endpoint (Table 16, Figure 7)

MRI findings 
While alemtuzumab and IFNB-1a were both efficacious in reducing Gd-enhancing lesions and T2 
lesion  volume  compared  with  baseline,  alemtuzumab  was  significantly  more  efficacious  than 
IFNB-1a  on  all  MRI  measures  in  the  second  year  of  follow-up.  In  addition,  over  the  duration  of 
follow-up,  alemtuzumab  significantly  reduced  the  risk  of  developing  Gd-enhancing  and  new  or 
enlarging  T2-hyperintense  lesions.  Alemtuzumab-treated  patients  had  significant  reductions  in 
severe  established  and  ongoing  tissue  damage  as  measured  by  the  T1-hypointense  lesion 
volume  and  significant  reductions  in  the  rate  of  brain  atrophy  as  measured  by  the  brain 
parenchymal  fraction,  compared  with  IFNB-1a-treated  patients.  Alemtuzumab  significantly 
decreased the odds of experiencing MRI activity (p=0.0388) through 2 years (Table 18).

Quality of life 
Alemtuzumab patients showed significantly greater improvements from baseline in self-reported 
quality of life than IFNB-1a patients on both the FAMS (at all time-points assessed) and the SF-
36  PCS  (at  Year  1  but  not  Year  2).  On  both  the  FAMS  and  the  SF-36,  these  between-group 
differences  were  largely  driven  by  greater  improvements  on  scales  pertaining  to  physical 
functioning  as  opposed  to  mental  or  social  functioning.  While  there  were  no  significant 
differences between the treatment groups on EQ-5D utility scores or health states, alemtuzumab 
patients did show significantly greater improvements from baseline on the EQ-5D VAS at Year 1. 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity  analyses  conducted  to  assess  the  influence  of  alternative  MS  treatments,  unblinded 
EDSS raters and other factors that could potentially affect the primary relapse- and time to SAD- 
analyses  demonstrated  that  the  influence  of  these  factors  was  minimal  and  did  not  alter  the 
estimates of the treatment effects in either of the co-primary endpoints. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the influence of gender, age, geographic region and 
other  baseline  or  demographic  factors  on  the  MS  relapse  and  the  time  to  disability  progression 
sustained for 6 months. Summaries of these analyses are presented in Figures 8 and 9.

CAMMS324  -  A  phase  3  randomized,  rater-  and  dose-blinded  study  comparing  two 
annual cycles of intravenous low- and high-dose alemtuzumab to three-times weekly 
subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (Rebif) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis who have relapsed on therapy 
Methods 
Study Participants  
To be eligible to participate in the study, patients (aged 18-55) had to present with active RRMS. 
These  patients  were  defined  as  patients  with  an  EDSS  score  between  0  and  5,  who  had  first 
onset of MS symptoms within 10 years prior to study entry and at least two clinical episodes of 
MS  in  the  prior  two  years,  at  least  one  episode  in  the  prior  year  and  at  least  one  MS  relapse 
during treatment with a beta interferon therapy or glatiramer acetate after having been on that 
therapy for ≥6 months within 10 years prior to study entry. Patients meeting any of the following 
criteria could not be enrolled: any progressive form of MS, history of malignancy, CD4+, CD8+, 
CD19+  cell  or  absolute  neutrophil  count  <  lower  limit  of  normal  (LLN)  at  screening,  known 
bleeding  disorder,  significant  autoimmune  disease,  presence  of  anti-TSHR  antibodies  and  active 
infection/  high  risk  of  infection  and  previous  treatment  with  natalizumab,  methotrexate, 
azathioprine or cyclosporine in the past six months. 
Treatments 
Alemtuzumab was administered by daily intravenous infusions at 2 dose levels of 12 mg/day and 
24  mg/day.  Patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  received  daily  infusions  for  5 
consecutive  days  at  Month  0  (Cycle  1;  60  mg  total)  and  for  3  consecutive  days  at  Month  12 
(Cycle 2; 36 mg total). Patients in the alemtuzumab 24 mg/day group received daily infusions for 
5 consecutive days at Month 0 (Cycle 1; 120 mg total) and for 3 consecutive days at Month 12 
(Cycle 2; 72 mg total). Initial infusions were given over a period of at least 4 hours. If the first 2 
doses  of  each  annual  visit  were  well  tolerated,  subsequent  daily  infusions  could  be  given  more 
rapidly,  but  never  over  a  period  of  less  than  2  hours.  If  not  well  tolerated,  the  infusion  period 
could be extended at the physician’s discretion, but the total infusion period on any day was not 
to  exceed  8  hours.  All  alemtuzumab-treated  patients  received  IV  methylprednisolone  (1  g/day) 
on  Days  1,  2  and  3  at  Month  0  and  12.  Further  to  a  protocol  amendment,  all  alemtuzumab 
patients received acyclovir 200 mg twice daily (or a therapeutic equivalent) starting on the first 
day of each alemtuzumab cycle and continuing for 28 days after the last day.  
The  comparator  used  in  the  trial  was Rebif  (IFNB-1a),  administered  at  44  μg  tiw, i.e. in a  total 
weekly  dose  of  132  μg.  The  dose  could  be  decreased  based  on  patient  tolerance.  All  patients 
received IV methylprednisolone (1 g/day) on Days 1, 2, and 3 at Month 0 and 12.  
On-study  relapses  could  be  treated  with  corticosteroids  at  the  discretion  of  the  Treating 
Neurologist.  A  standardized  regimen  of  methylprednisolone  was  strongly  recommended  as 
follows: 1 gram of methylprednisolone administered by IV over approximately 1 hour, daily for 3 
consecutive days.

Objectives 
The  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  compare  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  2  annual  cycles  of  IV 
alemtuzumab  at  either  12  mg/day  or  24  mg/day  versus  subcutaneous  interferon  beta-1a 
administered  3-times  weekly,  in  patients  with  RRMS  who  had  experienced  at  least  1  relapse 
during  prior  treatment  with  interferon  beta  or  glatiramer  acetate  after  having  received  that 
therapy  for  ≥6  months.  The  alemtuzumab  24  mg/day  group  was  closed  by  Amendment  2  in 
order  to  reduce  the  overall  sample  size,  the  duration  of  the  enrolment  period  and  the  overall 
duration  of  the  study.  Efficacy  comparisons  with  alemtuzumab  24  mg/day  were  considered 
exploratory. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  active-controlled  phase  3  studies  utilized  the  co-primary  efficacy  endpoints  of  MS  relapse 
rate  and  time  to  SAD  (6-month  criteria).  Secondary  endpoints  included  imaging  findings  (MRI) 
along  with  additional  relapse  and  disability  endpoints.  Definitions  of  the  co-primary  and 
secondary endpoints in studies CAMMS223, CAMMS323 and CAMMS324 are provided in Table 11 
(above).  With  respect  to  imaging,  the  same  endpoints  as  in  CAMMS323  were  deployed:  % 
change  in  T1-hypointense  lesion  volume,  %  change  in  brain  parenchymal  fraction,  new  or 
enlarging T2-hyperintense lesion counts, Gd-enhancing lesion counts, new T1-hypointense lesion 
counts  and  conversion  of  Gd-enhancing  lesions  to  new  T1-hypointense  lesions.  The  efficacy 
assessments also comprised a number of additional exploratory and tertiary endpoints, including 
quality of life parameters (FAMS, SF-36 and EQ-5D), as in study CAMMS323. 
Sample size 
Under the original study protocol, assuming a 2:2:1 randomisation to alemtuzumab 12 mg/day, 
alemtuzumab  24  mg/day  or  IFNB-1a,  a  sample  size  of  1200  patients  was  planned  in  order  to 
provide >80% power to detect a 45% treatment effect in time to SAD, assuming a 2-year SAD 
rate  of  20%  for  the  IFNB-1a  patients.  Under  Amendment  2,  the  24  mg/day  arm  was  closed  to 
further  enrolment  and  randomisation  continued  until  approximately  382  patients  were  assigned 
to  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  and  191  were  assigned  to  IFNB-1a.  Approximately  573  patients 
across the 2 treatment groups should provide >80% power to detect a 50% treatment effect in 
time to SAD given a 2-year SAD rate of 20% for the IFNB-1a patients. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomized  to  alemtuzumab  (12  mg/day  or  24  mg/day)  or  IFNB-1a  using  an 
interactive  voice  response  system.  Treatment  assignment  was  at  a  ratio  of  2:2:1.  After  closing 
the 24 mg/day arm, all patients were randomised at a 2:1 ratio to alemtuzumab 12 mg/day or 
IFNB-1a. Patients already randomized to the alemtuzumab 24 mg/day arm continued to receive 
the 24 mg/day dose as originally planned. 
Blinding (masking) 
The same approach was taken as in study CAMMS 323.

Conduct of the study 
There were four amendments to the protocol introduced during the conduct of the study. The key 
changes  introduced  through  Amendment  2  included  closing  the  alemtuzumab  24  mg/day  group 
in order to reduce the overall sample size, the duration of the enrolment period and the duration 
of the study. The other amendments of the protocol were similar to those implemented for study 
CAMSS323,  i.e.  pertained  to  ensuring  patient  safety  and  introducing  measures  to  improve 
blinding.

Numbers analysed 
A  total  of  840  patients  (231  IFNB-1a;  436  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day;  173  alemtuzumab  24 
mg/day)  were  randomized  in  this  study.  798  patients  (202  IFNB-1a;  426  alemtuzumab  12 
mg/day;  170  alemtuzumab  24  mg/day)  were  included  in  the  Full Analysis  Set  (all  patients  who 
were randomised and received at least one dose of the study drug) used for the primary efficacy 
analyses.  The  number  of  patients  in  each  treatment  group  for  the  Full  Analysis  Set  and  the 
Safety  Set  were  not  the  same,  because  9  patients  were  randomised  to  the  alemtuzumab  24 
mg/day treatment group but received alemtuzumab 12 mg/day.

Outcomes and estimation 
Relapse 
Two annual cycles of alemtuzumab treatment resulted in a statistically significant 49% reduction 
in  relapse  rate  compared  with  IFNB-1a  (p<0.0001),  meeting  the  relapse  co-primary  endpoint, 
and  satisfying  the  predefined  protocol  criteria  for  declaring  that  this  study  met  its  efficacy 
objective.  The  estimated  ARR  through  two  years  was  0.26  for  alemtuzumab  versus  0.52  for 
IFNB-1a (Table 22).

Alemtuzumab significantly increased the proportion of patients who were relapse free through 2 
years  compared  with  IFNB-1a.  At  Year  2,  65.4%  of  alemtuzumab  versus  46.7%  of  IFNB-1a-
treated patients remained relapse free, which represents a 47% reduction in the risk of relapse 
over 2 years (Figure 13).

Disability 
Alemtuzumab  reduced  the  risk  of  SAD  through  2  years  by  42%  compared  with  IFNB-1a 
(p=0.0084).  Thus,  the  disability  co-primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  met.  The  percentage  of 
patients  experiencing  SAD  at  2  years  was  12.7%  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  and 
21.1% in the IFNB-1a group (Table 23, Figure 14).

Time to sustained reduction in disability 
Alemtuzumab-treated  patients  were  more  likely  to  achieve  a  sustained  reduction  in  disability 
compared  with  IFNB-1a-treated  patients  (92/321  patients  [28.8%]  versus  18/153  patients 
[12.9%], respectively; HR [95% CI] = 2.57 [1.57, 4.20], p = 0.0002). (Figure 16)

MRI findings 
Alemtuzumab was more effective than IFNB-1a on MRI measures involving all lesion types (T2-
hyperintense,  Gd-enhancing  and  T1  hypointense).  Alemtuzumab  also  reduced  the  risk  of 
developing  GD-enhancing  lesions,  new  or  enlarging  T2-hyperintense  lesions  and  new  T1-
hypointense  lesions  at  all  timepoints.  The  secondary  endpoint  of  change  from  baseline  in  T2 
lesion volume at year 2 was not met. However, the T2 lesion volume change from year 1 to year 
2  was  better  with  alemtuzumab  than  with  IFNB-1a.  Alemtuzumab  patients  had  significant 
reductions  from  baseline  through  Year  2  in  the  rate  of  brain  atrophy  and  alemtuzumab 
significantly  reduced  the  risk  that  enhancing  lesions,  which  developed  during  the  study,  would 
convert  to  T1-hypointense  black  holes.  A  significant  improvement  favouring  alemtuzumab  was 
seen in the change in T1-hypointense lesion volume during the first year of the study, but there 
was no difference in the second year between treatment groups. 
Alemtuzumab also significantly decreased the odds of experiencing MRI activity at Year 1, Year 2 
and for the composite of Year 1 and 2 (p<0.0001) (Table 26).

Quality of life 
Alemtuzumab  patients  experienced  significant  improvement  on  the  SF-36  PCS  compared  with 
IFNB-1a. Significant differences favouring alemtuzumab were also noted at Year 1 on the SF-36 
MCS, but not at Year 2. In the instrument designed specifically for measuring MS-related impacts 
on QoL (FAMS), alemtuzumab-treated patients demonstrated significant improvement compared 
with  IFNB-1a-treated  patients  at  all  time-points  assessed.  The  significant  between-group 
differences  were  observed  mainly  because  alemtuzumab-treated  patients  demonstrated  greater 
improvements  on  scales  pertaining  to  physical  functioning.  While  there  were  no  significant 
differences in the health status of the treatment groups as measured by EQ-5D utility scores at 
Years  1  and  2,  alemtuzumab  patients  showed  significantly  greater  improvements  from  baseline 
on the EQ-5D VAS at all time-points. 
Ancillary analyses 
Sensitivity  analyses  conducted  to  assess  the  influence  of  alternative  MS  treatments,  unblinded 
EDSS raters and other factors that could potentially affect the primary relapse- and time to SAD- 
analyses  demonstrated  that  the  influence  of  these  factors  was  minimal  and  did  not  alter  the 
estimates of the treatment effects in either of the co-primary endpoints. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess the influence of gender, age, geographic region and 
other  baseline  or  demographic  actors  on  the  MS  relapse  and  the  time  to  disability  progression 
sustained for 6 months. Summaries of these analyses are presented in Figures 17 and 18.

Notes 
The primary efficacy analysis was conducted on the available 2-year follow-up data for 
all patients in the Full Analysis Set and was adjusted for multiple comparisons via the 
Hochberg method. The comparison of the relapse rate co-primary endpoint used the 
proportional means model with treatment group indicator and geographic region as 
covariates in the model. The comparison of the SAD co-primary endpoint used a Cox 
proportional hazards regression model with treatment group indicator and geographic 
region as covariates and robust variance estimation.

The primary efficacy analysis was conducted on the available 2-year follow-up data for 
all patients in the FA Set and was adjusted for multiple comparisons via the Hochberg 
method. The comparison of the relapse rate co-primary endpoint used the proportional 
means model with treatment group indicator and geographic region as covariates in 
the model. The comparison of the SAD co-primary endpoint used a Cox proportional 
hazards regression model with treatment group indicator and geographic region as 
covariates and robust variance estimation.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
No  studies  in  special  populations  were  performed  by  the  applicant.  (See  2.3.6  Discussion  on 
clinical efficacy.) 
Supportive studies 
Supportive study: CAMMS223 (Phase II study): Phase 2, Randomized, Open-Label, Three-Arm 
Study  Comparing  Low-  (12  mg)  and  High-Dose  (24  mg)  Alemtuzumab  and  High-Dose 
Subcutaneous  Interferon  Beta-1a  (Rebif)  in  Patients  With  Early,  Active  Relapsing-Remitting 
Multiple Sclerosis.  
The original study plan called for a 3-year treatment period.  The protocol was later amended 
to  add  a  follow-up  period  and  to  enable  retreatment  with  alemtuzumab  with  up  to  two 
additional 12 mg cycles separated by at least 12 months, if patients met qualifying criteria for 
each retreatment. 
Alemtuzumab  demonstrated  superiority  over  IFNB-1a  on  both  co-primary  endpoints,  i.e. 
relapse rate and time to SAD. For the disability (SAD) component of the co-primary endpoint 
alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  reduced  the  risk  of  SAD  by  76%  as  compared  to  IFNB-1a  (hazard 
ratio  of  0.24;  95%  CI  [0.110,  0.545];  p  =  0.0006)  over  3  years.  Alemtuzumab  24  mg/day 
also  reduced  the  risk  of  SAD  by  69%  as  compared  to  IFNB-1a  (HR=0.31;  95%  CI  [0.151, 
0.658];  p  =  0.0021).  For  the  relapse  rate  component,  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  significantly 
reduced  the  relapse  rate  by  67%  as  compared  to  IFNB-1a  (rate  ratio=0.33;  95%  CI  [0.196, 
0.552];  p<0.0001)  through  3  years.  Similarly,  alemtuzumab  24  mg  significantly  reduced  the 
relapse  rate  by  77%  as  compared  to  IFNB-1a  (rate  ratio=0.23;  95%  CI  [0.126,  0.431]; 
p<0.0001). The estimated ARR through 3 years was 0.37 for IFNB-1a, 0.12 for alemtuzumab 
12  mg,  and  0.09  for  alemtuzumab  24  mg.  Sensitivity  analyses  and  subgroup  analyses  were 
largely  consistent  and  supportive  of  superiority.  Further  analyses  related  to  relapse  rate, 
disability and MRI imaging were supportive of the superiority of alemtuzumab 12 mg/day and 
24  mg/day  over  IFNB-1a.  Data  from  the  longer-term  follow-up  indicated  that  superiority  of 
alemtuzumab  over  beta-interferon  in  terms  of  slowing  the  disability  accumulation  may  be 
sustained over 5 years. 
Study CAMMS03409 - An Extension Protocol For Multiple Sclerosis Patients Who Participated in 
Genzyme-Sponsored Studies of Alemtuzumab (ongoing at the time of the initial MAA) 
This was an open-label, rater-blinded extension study for patients who participated in studies 
CAMMS223,  CAMMS323  or  CAMMS324.  The  study  included  collection  of  additional  follow-up 
data  and  “as-needed”  retreatment  with  additional  cycles  of  alemtuzumab  for  patients  who 
received alemtuzumab in the Phase 2 and 3 studies and alemtuzumab treatment and follow-up 
for patients who received IFNB-1a in the Phase 2 and 3 studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 71/116 
 
  
  
As  of  31  Dec  2011,  1,320  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  extension  study  CAMMS03409, 
including 305 patients who had received IFNB-1a in a prior study and 1015 patients who had 
received  alemtuzumab  in  a  prior  study.  As  of  31  Dec  2011  cut-off  date,  496  patients  had 
received  alemtuzumab  in  this  extension  study:  199  patients  previously  treated  with 
alemtuzumab  received  re-treatment  with  alemtuzumab  and  297  patients  previously  treated 
with  IFNB-1a.  Preliminary  efficacy  analyses  suggested  that  the  relapse  rates  for  patients 
treated with IFNB-1a in the prior studies, who crossed over to alemtuzumab 12 mg/day, were 
lower in the extension study than in the prior studies. The CHMP considered that this further 
supported  the  assumption  that  alemtuzumab  may  also  be  effective  when  initiated  further  in 
the course of MS. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  main  clinical  studies  submitted  to  support  the  claim  of  efficacy  were  performed  as 
multicentre,  randomised,  active-controlled  and  rater-blinded.  The  CHMP  acknowledged  that 
the applicant complied with the previous CHMP Scientific Advice whereby comparison against a 
high-dose  beta-interferon  rather  than  placebo  was  encouraged.  Thus,  the  choice  of  Rebif 
(interferon  beta-1a,  administered  subcutaneously  at  3x  44  μcg/week)  as  an  active  control 
used throughout the clinical studies was considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
Of note, the choice of Rebif as an active comparator precluded a double-blinded study design. 
Rebif  44  μg  is  commercially  available  only  in  proprietary  prefilled  syringes  preventing  the 
possibility  of  creating  a  matching  placebo.  In  addition,  the  CHMP  considered  the  differences 
between alemtuzumab and Rebif in terms of timing and the mode of administration (yearly i.v. 
infusions versus s.c. injections 3 tiw) and safety profiles (infusion-associated reactions versus 
injection  site  reactions  and  flu-like  symptoms)  and  acknowledged  the  difficulties  of  designing 
the  studies  in  a  double-blind,  double  dummy  fashion.  In  this  context,  special  attention  was 
paid  to  taking  other  appropriate  measures  to  maintain  the  blind  and  minimise  bias. 
Specifically,  the  studies  were  conducted  as  rater-blinded  and  designed  to  minimise  the 
potential impact of treating physicians and patients being aware of treatment assignment (see 
Section 2.5.2 Blinding). This approach was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
All three active-controlled studies utilized the co-primary efficacy endpoints of MS relapse rate 
and  time  to  Sustained  Accumulation  of  Disability.  The  combination  of  relapse  rate  and  a 
disability-related  endpoint  as  co-primary  endpoint  was  acknowledged.  The  current  Guideline 
on  multiple  sclerosis  (CPMP/EWP/561/98  Rev.1)  stipulates  that  an  appropriate  disability 
outcome  can  be  defined  based  on  sustained  worsening  of  relevant  magnitude,  measured  by 
EDSS as the most widely used scale, and that two consecutive examinations should be carried 
out  at  least  6  months  apart.  The  CHMP  considered  that  these  requirements  were  met  by 
Sustained  Accumulation  of  Disability  definition  used  in  all  three  trials,  i.e.  increase  in  EDSS 
score of ≥1.5 points from a baseline score of  0 or an increase of ≥1.0 point from a baseline 
score of 1 or more, on 3 consecutive quarterly assessments (i.e., for ≥6 months). 
Evaluating  imaging  endpoints  as  secondary  endpoints  was  considered  relevant,  since  the 
combination  of  MRI  lesion  activity  and  relapse  activity  was  suggested  to  correlate  with 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013

subsequent accumulation of disability (Sormani et al: Combined MRI lesions and relapses as a 
surrogate  for  disability  in  multiple  sclerosis.  Neurology.  2011  Nov  1;77(18):1684-90).  Other 
endpoints including the MSFC, an emerging disability assessment tool that involves especially 
functional aspects, were also considered relevant. 
Patients  in  all  three  active-controlled  studies  had  active  RRMS,  in  studies  CAMMS223  and 
CAMMS323  treatment-naïve  patients  were  enrolled,  whereas  relapse  on  prior  therapy 
(interferon  beta  or  glatiramer  acetate  taken  for  at  least  6  months)  was  an  inclusion  criterion 
for  study  CAMSS324.  Furthermore,  in  contrast  to  CAMMS223  and  CAMMS323,  patients  in 
CAMMS324 could have had MS symptoms for longer (up to 10 years), a higher EDSS score (up 
to  5)  and  were  required  to  have  an  MRI  scan  with  abnormalities  exceeding  threshold  criteria 
(at least 1 of the following: ≥9 T2 lesions ≥3 mm in any axis; a gadolinium-enhancing lesion 
≥3 mm in any axis plus ≥1 brain T2 lesions; or a spinal cord lesion consistent with MS plus ≥1 
brain  T2  lesions).  Overall,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  patient  populations  enrolled  in 
the clinical programme were representative of both previously untreated MS patients and MS 
patients with an inadequate response to prior therapy. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  applicant  did  not  perform  formal  dose-finding  studies  for 
alemtuzumab  in  the  MS  setting.    Nevertheless,  the  approach  to  evaluate  in  phase  2  doses 
bracketing the 20 mg/day used in the pilot phase (see Section 2.5.1), i.e. doses of 12 mg/day 
and 24 mg/day, was accepted as well as the resulting choice of doses for the phase 3 trials. 
Taking into account the generally comparable efficacy of the 12 mg/day and 24 mg/day doses 
and the issues of tolerability linked to the higher dose, the choice of the lower dose applied for 
by the applicant was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
With respect to tolerability, especially the infusion associated reactions (Moreau, 1996, Brain), 
the  CHMP  also  noted  that  each  annual  treatment  cycle  with  alemtuzumab  is  administered  in 
divided doses. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  protocol  violations  were assessed  by  the  applicant  with  respect  to 
their nature and potential impact on the conduct of the studies, including sensitivity analyses 
on the efficacy outcomes, and agreed that the results suggested the impact was minimal. The 
majority  of  deviations  fell  in  the  category  of  a  study  procedure  or  assessment  not  being 
performed  per  protocol,  primarily  attributed  to  missing  laboratory  test  results  or  survey 
responses that were required as part of the intensified surveillance efforts to detect potential 
events  of  ITP  or  anti-GBM  disease.  A  similar  pattern  of  protocol  deviations  was  observed  in 
both  phase  III  studies.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  intensified  safety  monitoring  was  a 
programme  involving  more  than  30,000  laboratory  results,  which  may  include  a  certain 
probability of occurrence of such protocol deviations. 
The  CHMP  also  discussed  the  amendments  implemented  during  the  conduct  of  the  studies. 
Whereas measures introduced for safety reasons were accepted by the CHMP, concerns were 
originally  expressed  with  respect  to  measures  implemented  to  improve  blinding,  due  to  the 
lack of clarity of their impact on the study conduct, in particular with respect to data collected 
before  implementation  of  these  amendments.  Following  review  of  the  sensitivity  analyses 
performed  by  the  applicant  and  presented  separately  for  each  of  the  Phase  3  studies,  the 
CHMP  concluded  that  no  impact  of  the  protocol  amendments  on  efficacy  outcomes  was 
expected.

No  studies  in  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  were  performed.  Since  monoclonal 
antibodies  are  neither  metabolized  by  the  liver  nor  excreted  by  the  kidneys,  the  CHMP 
considered that studies in these special populations were not needed.  
With respect to the paediatric population, the CHMP considered that a waiver was granted for 
the paediatric subsets in the range from birth to less than 10 years and a deferral was granted 
for conducting and submitting results of a clinical trial in MS patients 10 to less than 18 years. 
The CHMP noted that the information is adequately covered in the Product Information. 
The clinical studies did not include any patients aged over 55 years and it was not determined 
whether these patients would respond to the treatment differently than the younger patients.   
This was appropriately reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy of alemtuzumab in the treatment of multiple sclerosis was supported by results of two 
phase 3 clinical trials, i.e. CAMMS323 and CAMMS324 as well as by data from a phase II study 
CAMMS223 and an extension study CAMMS03409, which was ongoing at the time of the initial 
MAA. 
Baseline  demographics  were  in  large  comparable  across  the  three  controlled  clinical  studies 
and  represented  a  typical  patient  population  for  RRMS.  When  comparing  studies  CAMMS223 
and  CAMMS323  (treatment-naïve  patients)  with  study  CAMMS324  (previously  treated 
patients), a more advanced MS population was noted in study CAMMS324, e.g. in terms of the 
mean  EDSS  score  and  MS  history.  This  was  in  line  with  the  intended  study  population  of 
previously  treated  patients  who  are  expected  to  be  more  affected  than  treatment-naïve 
patients. 
Study CAMMS323 (Phase III study in treatment-naïve patients) 
The relapse rate component of the primary endpoint was met with a reduction in relapse rate 
of  55%  following  alemtuzumab  treatment  compared  to  IFNB-1a,  with  an  ARR  of  0.18  in  the 
alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group compared with 0.39 in the IFNB-1a group.  
Sensitivity  analyses  and  subgroup  analyses  were  generally  consistent  and  supportive  of  the 
superiority  for  relapse  rate.  Kaplan-Meier  plots  as  well  as  analysis  by  time  intervals  showed 
that the superior effect of alemtuzumab on relapses was persistent over time. 
The  disability  component  Time  to  Sustained  Accumulation  of  Disability  (SAD)  showed  no 
significant  difference  between  the  treatment  groups.  The  CHMP  considered  that  study 
CAMMS323 enrolled treatment-naïve patients and, as documented by the baseline and disease 
characteristics, a less affected patient population. This may explain why statistical significance 
was  reached  in  the  relapse-related  parameters  (including  the  relapse-related  component  of 
the  co-primary  endpoint),  as  opposed  to  only  a  trend  towards  a  higher  effect  in  disability-
related  endpoints,  where  statistical  significance  was  not  reached  (including  the  disability-
related  component  of  the  co-primary  endpoint).  Based  on  the  threshold  hypothesis  in  MS,  it 
was  considered  that  within  a  follow-up  of  two  years,  a  significant  impact  on  disability 
separating  alemtuzumab  from  beta-interferon  may  not  yet  be  observed.  The  CHMP  also 
considered that the failure to demonstrate effect on the SAD component might be attributed to 
the  lower  disability  progression  in  the  beta-interferon  arm  (11.1%)  than  expected  based  on 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 74/116 
 
  
  
the previous observations (i.e. expected rate of disability progression of 20%). 
Alemtuzumab showed a superior effect as compared to high-dose beta-interferon on most MRI 
parameters.  In  general,  the  effect  on  imaging  was  more  pronounced  in  the  second  year  of 
treatment.  Given  the  importance  of  MRI  lesions  in  conjunction  with  relapse  rate  on  disability 
(see  discussion  above  on  the  threshold  hypothesis),  the  CHMP  considered  the  MRI  results 
relevant and meaningful in terms of alemtuzumab efficacy. 
Patients  treated  with  alemtuzumab  showed  also  significantly  greater  improvements  from 
baseline on two self-report measures of quality of life (FAMS and SF-36), which were largely 
driven by improvements on scales pertaining to physical functioning. This finding was mirrored 
in the results on the MSFC.  
Study CAMMS324 (Phase III study in previously treated patients) 
The  proportions  of  patients  previously  treated  with  IFNB-1a,  IFNB-1b  and  glatiramer  acetate 
were  balanced  across  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  and  IFNB-1a  groups.  Approximately  one 
third of patients in each treatment  group had received Rebif prior to entering the study.  The 
mean duration of all prior MS therapies in both treatment groups was approximately 3 years 
and 25-30% of patients had used two or more prior MS medications. As such, the CHMP was 
of the view that the study population can be seen as adequately representing the pre-treated 
MS population. 
The  Annual  Relapse  Rate  component  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  met:  alemtuzumab 
significantly  reduced  the  relapse  rate  through  2  years  by  49%  compared  with  IFNB-1a.  The 
ARR  through  2  years  was  0.26  for  alemtuzumab-treated  patients  versus  0.52  for  IFNB-1a-
treated patients.  
In contrast to study CAMMS323, the disability component Time to Sustained Accumulation of 
Disability  (SAD),  sustained  over  a  6-month  period,  was  also  met:  alemtuzumab  significantly 
reduced the risk of SAD through 2 years by 42% compared with IFNB-1a. The percentage of 
patients experiencing SAD at 2 years was 12.7% in the alemtuzumab group and 21.1% in the 
IFNB-1a group. 
Sensitivity  analyses  and  subgroup  analyses  were  in  large  consistent  and  supportive  of 
superiority. All secondary endpoints, apart from the imaging-related endpoint “Percent change 
from  baseline  in  MRI  T2-hyperintense  lesion  volume  at  Year  2”,  were  highly  statistically 
significant and were considered clinically relevant by the CHMP. The finding that the effect of 
alemtuzumab on imaging endpoints was more pronounced at year 2 compared to year 1 was 
consistent with the findings of study CAMMS323 in treatment-naïve patients. 
In study CAMMS324, analyses of the EDSS-based endpoints (EDSS change from baseline and 
sustained reduction in disability) indicated that alemtuzumab treatment might not only reduce 
the  risk  of  disease  progression,  but  could  potentially  reverse  pre-existing  disability. 
Specifically,  alemtuzumab-treated  patients  experienced  significant  mean  improvement  from 
baseline  in  EDSS  score,  suggesting  a  decrease  in  disability  with  alemtuzumab  treatment, 
whereas  IFNB-1a-treated  patients  experienced  a  significant  worsening.  The  difference  in  the 
mean EDSS scores was statistically significant by Month 6 and this difference was maintained 
throughout the 2-year study period.  
In  addition,  alemtuzumab-treated  patients  were  significantly  more  likely  to  achieve  a 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 75/116 
 
  
  
sustained reduction in disability, defined as improved EDSS scores for at least 6 months, than 
IFNB-1a-treated  patients  (28.8%  versus  12.9%,  p=0.0002).  The  issue  is  discussed  further 
under “Claim on reversal of disability”, also reflecting the input from the SAG Neurology. 
Similarly  to  study  CAMMS323,  patients  treated  with  alemtuzumab  showed  also  significantly 
greater improvements from baseline on two self-report measures of quality of life (FAMS and 
SF-36). 
Supportive studies 
Overall,  in  study  CAMMS223,  superiority  of  alemtuzumab  over  placebo  was  observed  in  all 
domains considered relevant to treatment of MS, i.e. relapse rate, disability and MRI imaging, 
as  summarised  in  section  2.5.2.  Despite  being  a  phase  2  trial,  the  study  was  considered  by 
the  CHMP  to  show  features  of  a  phase  3  trial,  such  as  duration  or  choice  of  endpoints. 
Therefore, the CHMP was of the view that the evidence provided by this study contributed to 
the  efficacy  dataset  of  alemtuzumab  and  hence  included  considerations  regarding  these  data 
also in their overall benefit-risk assessment. Of note, the CHMP considered that the applicant 
provided data over a follow-up period longer than usually expected, i.e. two years. These data 
indicated  that  superiority  of  alemtuzumab  over  beta-interferon  in  terms  of  slowing  the 
disability accumulation may be sustained over 5 years. 
The  CHMP  considered  the  preliminary  efficacy  results  from  the  extension  study  CAMMS3409 
provided by the applicant. The data suggested that the relapse rates for patients treated with 
IFNB-1a in the prior studies, who crossed over to alemtuzumab 12 mg/day, were lower in the 
extension  study  than  in  the  prior  studies.  The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  this  further 
supported  the  assumption  that  alemtuzumab  may  also  be  effective  when  initiated  further  in 
the course of MS. 
Immunogenicity 
Most  patients  treated  with  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  (85.2%)  in  the  Phase  3  studies  tested 
positive  for  anti-alemtuzumab  antibodies,  with  92.2%  of  these  also  testing  positive  for 
inhibitory antibodies (see also section 2.4.3). A higher proportion of patients tested positive in 
Cycle 2 compared to Cycle 1 and peak antibody titres for both types of antibodies were higher 
following  Cycle  2  than  Cycle  1.  Overall,  through  either  2  cycles  of  treatment  in  the  Phase  3 
studies  (CAMMS323  and  CAMMS324)  or  3  cycles  of  treatment  in  the  Phase  2  study 
(CAMMS223),  anti-alemtuzumab  or  inhibitory  antibodies  did  not  appear  to  diminish  the 
efficacy of alemtuzumab as shown by a number of analyses. This was considered re-assuring 
by the CHMP. 
Reversal of disability 
The  CHMP  discussed  the  applicant´s  claim  that  the  indication  should  also  reflect  on  the 
reversal of disability. During their review, the CHMP expressed concerns about the consistency 
of  the  data  available,  i.e.  the  fact  that  statistically  significant  results  were  obtained  only  in 
studies  CAMMS223  and  CAMMS324,  but  not  in  CAMMS323,  and  questioned  the  clinical 
interpretability of the evidence.  
In further analyses, the applicant demonstrated that the results were consistent among EDSS 
and MSFC and supported by the quality of life data (although these data have to be seen as of 
limited  value  due  to  the  open-label  nature  of  the  clinical  studies)  and  MRI  data  showing 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 76/116 
 
  
  
reduction of brain atrophy-related parameters.  
The lack of significant findings on reversal of disability in study CAMMS323 in treatment-naïve 
patients  was  attributed  by  the  applicant  to  the  slow  disability  progression  in  the  active 
comparator  arm.  In  addition,  the  CHMP  also  considered  that  in  the  early  stage  of  MS, 
neurological deficits can still be compensated by the unaffected brain areas. 
In an additional analysis (Table 25), the applicant also examined the longer-term outcome for 
individuals  who  achieved  6-month  SRD  during  CAMMS324.  Around  one  quarter  of  patients 
sustained this effect for at least 12 months.  
EDSS improvements in CAMMS223 and CAMMS324 were seen not to be restricted to single or 
few  FSS  (functional  system  scores)  but to  be consistent within the EDSS scale, including the 
pyramidal  and  cerebellar  FSS  (fig.  15).  Improvements  after  alemtuzumab  were  also  seen  in 
patients  who  did  not  experience  a  relapse  in  the  three  months  before  study  entry,  thus 
suggesting  that  improvements  in  EDSS  were  not  merely  a  result  of  recovery  from  an  MS 
relapse. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  applicant  did  not  present  such  analyses  for  study  CAMMS323  where 
this difference was not observed. In this context, the CHMP also considered the fact that the 
effect  was  seen  in  study  CAMMS223,  which  included  the  treatment-naïve  patients  (as  in 
CAMMS323), hence questioning the consistency. Moreover, the CHMP was of the view that the 
mechanism by which alemtuzumab would initiate and promote repair are not quite elucidated. 
As  discussed  below,  the  CHMP  requested  input  from  the  SAG  Neurology  on  this  issue.  The 
experts agreed unanimously that the claim was not sufficiently supported by the current data, 
and may even be misleading for the patient who could expect a healing of the disease, which 
can  currently  not  be  inferred  from  the  data.  The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  SAG  Neurology  that 
the claim of reversal of disability should not  be part of the indication and concluded that the 
relevant data on SRD should be reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Additional expert consultation 
In the course of the procedure, the CHMP identified need for input from the SAG Neurology on 
the two following questions: 
•  Question 1 
How  does  the  SAG  see  the  benefits  of  Lemtrada  in  connection  with  the  safety  profile, 
especially  autoimmune  disorders?  Should  the  indication  be  restricted  like  e.g.  for  Tysabri  or 
Gilenya? How do neurologists see the handling of non-neurological complications that can be 
rapid and severe (e.g. nephrological complications like glomerulonephritis)? 
• 
 Question 2 
What  is  the  experts'  view  on  the  Applicants  claim  on  reversal  of  disability,  given  statistically 
significant findings on one hand but methodological considerations on the other, e.g. if mean 
changes in EDSS and MSFC can be clinically interpreted? 
Overall,  the  members  of  the  SAG  were  in  agreement  that  efficacy  of  LEMTRADA  in  patients 
with RRMS has been demonstrated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 77/116 
 
 
 
  
  
Several provisions to be introduced in the SmPC were proposed by the SAG experts, regarding 
the therapeutic use of the drug. The following were agreed upon by consensus: 
• 
• 
The  initiation  of  treatment  with  LEMTRADA  should  be  done  by  an  experienced  neurologist, 
within an appropriate setting, providing the needed specialists and equipment required for 
the  management  of  the  most  frequent  adverse  reactions,  as  described  by  the  available 
data.  
Prior to the initiation of treatment, a proactive targeted screening of the patients should be 
introduced,  aiming  to  minimize  the  risk  of  developing  opportunistic  infections,  neoplasms 
and cytopenic reactions. 
•  During  treatment  interphases  and  after  the  second  administration,  patients  should  be 
submitted to a very strict clinical and biological follow-up, as described in the RMP proposed 
by the applicant. 
The experts of the SAG were split in their opinion with regard to the most appropriate target 
population. Some of the experts advocated the position that an unrestricted indication should 
be  granted.  They  supported  their  view  by  the  fact  that  there  are  positive  data  on  efficacy  in 
both  treatment-naïve  and  pre-treated  patients  with  RRMS,  and  the  expected  adverse  events 
can be monitored and managed with a good prognosis for recovery, and even in some cases 
prevented, if appropriate risk mitigation strategies are put in place.  
Others supported the view that the population should be restricted to the patients with highly 
active  disease  and  the  ones  that  have  failed  first  line  treatment  with  interferon  beta  and 
glatiramer acetate, as previously done for other immunomodulators (such as natalizumab and 
fingolimod).  The  reasons  for  that  were  that  the  benefit/risk  was  considered  negative  in 
treatment-naïve patients with low disease activity, for whom only limited data on efficacy are 
available  and  are  insufficient  to  counter-balance  the  risk  from  the  already  identified  serious 
adverse events.  
With  respect  to  the  second  question,  the  SAG  concluded  by  consensus  that  in  the  proposed 
indication,  the  text  “…or  reverse…”  regarding  disability  progression  should  be  removed, 
leaving  only  the  mention  of  slowing  of  disability  progression.  The  reasons  for  that  are  the 
inconsistency  of  the  data  from  the  pivotal  trials  on  the  effect  on  disability,  and  also  the 
ambiguity of the wording that could create the impression that a reversal of the clinical course 
of  the  disease  is  to  be  expected  as  a  result  of  the  treatment  with  LEMTRADA.  The  SAG  also 
noted that such claim for reversal of disability cannot be ascertained without additional data. 
Moreover,  it  was  not  considered  possible  to  determine,  despite  the  efforts  made  by  the 
applicant  in  this  respect,  whether  the  observed  effect  on  disability  is  due  to  improved  re-
myelination and functioning of the neurons, or an artefact from the effect of the drug on the 
disease activity i.e. on relapses. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the clinical efficacy data submitted were considered satisfactory and supportive of the 
indication of alemtuzumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple 
sclerosis (RRMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1,485 alemtuzumab-treated MS patients constituted the safety population. Of these, 
972  patients  were  treated  in  the  phase  3  studies  (CAMMS323  and  CAMMS324)  and  216 
patients  in  the  phase  2  study  CAMMS223.  Alemtuzumab  exposure  in  the  active-controlled 
studies through 2-year follow-up is summarized in Table 29.  
297  patients  who  received  IFNB-1a  in  a  prior  study  were  treated  with  alemtuzumab  in  the 
extension study CAMMS03409.  
Table 29 Exposure Alemtuzumab in All Active-Controlled Studies (2-Year Follow Up) 
Patients  received  between  one  and  five  cycles  of  alemtuzumab  and  were  followed  for  safety 
for up to 8.9 years, resulting in a total of 4,262 person-years of follow-up (Table 30).

Adverse events 
Across the active-controlled studies, adverse events (AEs) were reported for 97.5% of patients 
in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  and  94.6%  of  patients  in  the  IFNB-1a  group.  The 
majority of the AEs were reported to be mild or moderate in severity.  
The  most  frequent  events  reported  were  rash  (48%),  urticaria  (17%)  and  pruritus  (16.5%) 
within  the  SOC  “Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders”,  headache  (52%),  MS  relapse 
(26.4%)  and  paresthesia  (12.3%)  within  the  SOC  “Nervous  System  Disorders”  and 
nasopharyngitis (23.5%), urinary tract infection (17.6%) and upper respiratory tract infection 
(15.3%) within the SOC “Infections and Infestations”. 
The incidence of the treatment-emergent adverse  events (TEAEs) and an overall overview of 
adverse  event  categories  in  all  active-controlled  studies  are  presented  in  Tables  31  and  32, 
respectively.

Table  32  Overview  of  Adverse  Events  in  the  active-controlled  studies  (CAMMS223, 
CAMMS323 and CAMMS324) 
The percentage of  patients with treatment-related AEs (as assessed by the investigator) was 
higher  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  than  in  the  IFNB-1a  group  (94.1%  vs  with 
73.4%).  Grade  3  or  Grade  4  AEs  were  reported  for  a  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  the 
alemtuzumab 12 mg/day and IFNB-1a groups. The incidence of AEs of Grade 3 or higher was 
greater in the alemtuzumab pooled dose group compared to the 12 mg/day group.  
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  generally  decreased  over 
time through Year 4 (93.6% at Year 1, 86.0% at Year 2, 72.7% at Year 3, 49.7% at Year 4).  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The incidence of SAEs was 18.3% in both the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group and the IFNB-1a 
group. SAEs were assessed by the investigators as related to study drug in 7.1% and 1.6% of 
patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  and  IFNB-1a  groups,  respectively.  The  most 
frequently  reported  SAEs  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  were  MS  relapse  (6.1%), 
pneumonia 
(0.4%),  autoimmune 
thrombocytopenia 
(0.4%),  gastroenteritis 
(0.4%), 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013

appendicitis  (0.4%)  and  urticaria  (0.4%).  In  the  pooled  alemtuzumab  group,  in  addition  to 
these events, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) occurred in four patients. 
Deaths 
There  were  a  total  of  eight  deaths  reported  in  the  clinical  studies,  seven  in  patients  who 
received alemtuzumab and one patient who received IFNB-1a. The causes of death are listed 
in  Table  33.  Fatal  events  in  three  alemtuzumab-treated  patients  were  assessed  as 
possibly/likely related to treatment by the investigator. 
Table 33 Listing of deaths (all studies) 
  Infusion-Associated Reactions (IARs) 
The overall incidence of IARs in the active-controlled studies was 91.1% in the alemtuzumab 
12 mg/day group, which was similar to the incidence in the pooled dose group (92.6%). The 
overall  incidence  in  the  24  mg/day  group  was  97.8%.  The  most  common  IARs  (occurring  in 
≥10%  of  patients)  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  were  headache,  rash,  pyrexia, 
nausea,  urticaria,  pruritus  and  insomnia.  Cardiac  events  had  an  incidence  of  approximately 
12%.  Additional  events  that  occurred  in  ≥10%  of  patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  24  mg/day 
group were fatigue, chills, chest discomfort and dyspnea. 
Serious  IARs  were  identified  for  2.8%  patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group;  the 
incidence of serious IARs was similar in the pooled dose group (2.7%). The incidence in the 24 
mg/day  group  was  2.2%.  Serious  IARs  included  cases  of  pyrexia,  urticaria,  atrial  fibrillation, 
Assessment report

nausea,  chest  discomfort  and  hypotension.  In  addition,  one  case  of  a  Grade  4  anaphylactic 
reaction  was  reported  in  a  patient  treated  with  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  in  the  extension 
study.  This patient had previously received 2 cycles of alemtuzumab 24 mg/day in CAMMS324 
and  had  experienced  non-serious  IARs  of  pruritus  and  dyspnea.    The  reaction  (redness  and 
swelling  of  eyes,  lips,  hands  and  face,  itching  and  swelling  in  mouth  and  throat  with  cough) 
occurred  on  Day  1  of  the  patient’s  third  treatment  cycle  and  resulted  in  discontinuation  of 
alemtuzumab treatment. The patient recovered without sequelae.  
No events of severe cutaneous reactions, such as Stevens Johnson syndrome, were observed. 
The  incidence  of  IARs  decreased  from  Cycle  1  to  Cycle  2  for  each  alemtuzumab  dose  group. 
For the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group, the incidence of IARs in Cycle 1 was 86.2% compared 
with 69.5% for Cycle 2. Results were similar for the alemtuzumab pooled dose group. For the 
alemtuzumab 24 mg/day group, the incidence of IARs was 96.7% and 86.2% in Cycle 1 and 
Cycle  2,  respectively.  The  incidence  of  IARs  decreased  over  the  course  of  the  infusion 
treatment cycle, with the highest incidence reported on Day 1. 
The  majority  of  patients  treated  with  alemtuzumab  had  detectable  anti-alemtuzumab 
antibodies  and  anti-alemtuzumab  inhibitory  antibodies.  The  presence  or  level  of  these 
antibodies had no apparent effect on the development of IARs or other AEs. 
Thyroid disorders  
In  the  active-controlled  studies,  the  incidence  of  thyroid  AEs  was  higher  in  the  alemtuzumab 
12 mg/day group (16.6%) than in the IFNB-1a group (5.2%).  The most frequently reported 
thyroid  AEs  (reported  for  >2%  of  patients)  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  were 
hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism,  Basedow’s  disease  and  decreased  blood  TSH.  No  thyroid 
AEs  were  reported  for  >2%  of  the  IFNB-1a  treated  patients.  The  majority  of  thyroid  AEs 
(94.9%)  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  was  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.    Most 
thyroid  events  were  managed  with  conventional  medical  therapy.  Few  patients  required 
surgical intervention and few discontinued treatment due to thyroid disorders. Serious thyroid 
AEs over two years of follow up in the active-controlled studies were reported in 0.8% patients 
in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  including  a  case  of  thyrotoxic  crisis  (Grade  3)  and 
endocrine  ophthalmopathy  (Grade  2)  that  occurred  23  months  after  start  of  alemtuzumab 
treatment.  
Based  on  data  from  all  alemtuzumab-treated  MS  patients,  thyroid  AEs  were  observed  in 
36.2%  and  44.7%  of  patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  through  4  and  8  years 
after  treatment  initiation,  respectively.    No  consistent  pattern  was  observed  with  regards  to 
time  of  onset  after  treatment  initiation,  although  the  highest  incidence  of  thyroid  AEs  was 
observed between 24 and 42 months after the first treatment cycle. Unlike the general trend 
observed for AEs, i.e. their decrease with the second cycle, there was an increase of AEs in the 
SOC  ‘Endocrine  disorders’  (4.6%  incidence  in  Year  1  and  9.0%  in  Year  2).  The  observed 
increase  in  the  incidence  of  ‘Endocrine  Disorders’  at  Year  2  was  primarily  driven  by  higher 
incidences of hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and Basedow’s disease when compared to Year 
1.  ‘Endocrine  Disorders’  were  reported  more  frequently  for  females  (17.3%)  compared  to 
males (5.6%) in the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group.

Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) 
Over  the  2-year  follow-up  in  the  active-controlled  studies,  ITP  was  reported  in  0.9%  of 
patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group,  2.2%  of  patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  24 
mg/day  group  and  1.6%  patients  in  the  IFNB-1a  treatment  group.  Serious  ITP  AEs  were 
reported  for  0.7%  patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  and  1.5%  patients  in  the 
alemtuzumab  24  mg/day  group;  no  serious  ITP  events  were  reported  in  IFNB-1a-treated 
patients (Table 34). 
Table  34  Incidence  and  annualized  rate  of  first  treatment-emergent  immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura 
Sixteen of the alemtuzumab-treated patients had confirmed ITP with no alternative etiologies. 
The  events  occurred  predominantly  between  14  and  36  months  after  the  start  of  alemtuzumab 
treatment (range 3 to  85 months after the first alemtuzumab  dose). With regards to treatment 
cycles, the first occurrence of ITP was more common after the second treatment cycle.   
Based  on  data  from  all  alemtuzumab-treated  MS  patients,  platelet  counts  and/or  symptoms 
indicative of ITP occurred in 22 (1.5%) patients, 13 (1.1%) in the 12 mg/day dose group and 9 
(3.3%)  in  the  24  mg/day  dose  group.  Following  medical  review,  16  of  these  alemtuzumab-
treated patients had confirmed ITP with no alternative etiologies. 
Nephropathy Including Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane (anti-GBM) Disease 
Cases of nephropathies were reported in 5 (0.4%) patients in the 12 mg/day alemtuzumab dose 
group  (0.3%  in  the  pooled  dose  group,  with  no  additional  cases  reported  in  the  24  mg/day 
group).The events occurred generally within up to 39 months following the last administration of 
alemtuzumab.  These  5  cases  included  membranous  glomerulonephritis  and  tubulointerstitial 
nephritis,  glomerulonephritis  (reported  as  anti-GBM  glomerulonephritis),  Goodpasture’s 
syndrome  (reported  as  anti-GBM  disease)  and  nephropathy.  Both  cases  of  anti-GBM  disease 
were serious, were identified early through clinical and laboratory monitoring and had a positive 
outcome after treatment.   
Infections 
In  the  active-controlled  studies,  the  incidence  of  infection  AEs  for  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day 
group was 70.9%, compared with 53.2% in the IFNB-1a group (Table 35).

Table 35 Incidence of infections reported in ≥5% of patients in any treatment group 
in all active-controlled studies 
The overall incidence of any fungal infection in the active controlled studies was higher in the 
alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  (12.1%)  than  in  the  IFNB-1a  group  (3.4%).  The  most 
commonly reported events (reported for ≥2% of patients) in the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day and 
IFNB-1a groups were vulvovaginal candidiasis and oral candidiasis. Results were similar in the 
alemtuzumab pooled and 24 mg/day groups. A serious event of distal oesophageal candidiasis 
was  reported  for  one  patient  in  the  12  mg/day  group.  The  event  occurred  following  cycle  1 
and responded to conventional treatment. 
There were no systemic fungal infections. 
In all active-controlled studies during the first 2 years of follow up, the overall incidence of any 
tuberculosis infection was 0.1% (1 patient) in the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group (reported as 
disseminated  TB)  and  0.2%  (1  patient)  in  the  IFNB-1a  group  (recorded  as  renal  TB).  Three 
additional events were identified in the alemtuzumab 24 mg/day group (recorded as latent TB, 
pulmonary tuberculoma and pulmonary TB), resulting in an incidence of 0.3% (4 patients) in 
the alemtuzumab pooled dose group. All 4 events occurred in the first 2 years of follow up.  
Human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  infections  were  reported  for  2.4%  of  patients  in  the 
alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group and 1.4% in the IFNB-1a group, but these did not appear to 
lead  to  an  increased  risk  of  cervical  pathology,  as  the  incidence  of  cervical  dysplasia  was 
similar in both treatment groups (1.1% and 1.0%, respectively).   
Serious  infections  were  reported  for  2.7%  of  patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group 
and  1.0%  in  the  IFNB-1a  group  over  2  years  of  follow-up  in  the  active-controlled  studies 
(Table 36).

Table  36  Incidence  of  serious  infection  (reported  in  ≥2  patients)  in  all  active-
controlled studies (2-year follow-up) 
There  were  no  reports  of  hepatitis  C,  progressive  multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy, 
toxoplasmosis, HIV, P. jiroveci or other opportunistic infections. 
Malignancies 
In  the  active-controlled  studies  (2-year  follow  up),  four  patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12 
mg/day  and  2  patients  in  the  IFNB-1a  treatment  groups  reported  malignant  neoplasms. 
Additionally, 4 patients in the alemtuzumab 24 mg/day group reported malignant neoplasms, 
for a total of 8 patients in the alemtuzumab pooled group (Table 37). 
Table  37  Incidence  of  treatment-emergent  malignancies  in  the  active-controlled 
trials 
In the alemtuzumab pooled dose group over all available follow-up, 13/1485 (0.88%) patients 
reported a total of 15 malignancies (6 patients in the 12 mg/day group, 7 patients in the 24 
mg/day  group).  The  most  common  malignancies  reported  in  more  than  1  alemtuzumab-
treated patient were thyroid cancer (5 patients), basal cell carcinoma (3 patients) and breast 
cancer (2 patients). 
Of  note,  one  patient  died  of  sepsis  during  the  course  of  chemotherapy  to  treat  Burkitt´s 
lymphoma 40 months after the third annual treatment with alemtuzumab. 
Laboratory findings 
During  2-year  follow  up  in  the  active-controlled  studies,  alemtuzumab  was  associated  with 
fewer  hematologic  abnormalities  than  IFNB-1a  with  respect  to  parameters  other  than 
lymphocyte  depletion.  Values  below  normal  for  platelets,  neutrophils  and  hemoglobin  were 
observed less frequently in the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group than in the IFNB-1a group. 
Assessment report

Elevations  in  ALT  and  AST  were  less  frequently  observed  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day 
group  than  in  the  IFNB-1a  group,  but  elevations  in  bilirubin  were  more  frequent  in  the 
alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group. Three IFNB-1a-treated patients and one patient treated with 
alemtuzumab 12 mg/day met Hy’s Law criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury.  
Renal  function  was  monitored  by  creatinine  testing  and  urinalysis,  monthly  for  alemtuzumab 
patients and quarterly for IFNB-1a patients. Elevations in serum creatinine at quarterly testing 
occurred with similar frequency in the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group and the IFNB-1a group 
and were of low severity. The proportions of patients with occult blood or urine protein levels 
flagged  as  clinically  significant  or  RBCs  in  the  urine  were  higher  in  the  alemtuzumab  12 
mg/day group than in the IFNB-1a group. 
During all available follow up in all alemtuzumab patients, there was no apparent increase in 
the  number  of  patients  with  low  platelets,  neutrophils  or  hemoglobin  or  high  AST,  ALT, 
bilirubin  or  creatinine  or  the  severity  of  any  abnormal  laboratory  value  with  the  number  of 
alemtuzumab  cycles  received  or  the  total  alemtuzumab  dose.  A  majority  of  patients  treated 
with  alemtuzumab  had  detectable  anti-alemtuzumab  or  anti-alemtuzumab 
inhibitory 
antibodies, with titers that increased in the 3-month period following each cycle of treatment, 
but  which  declined  to  low  levels  by  the  time-point  12  months  following  treatment.  Peak 
antibody levels were higher after administration of each subsequent treatment cycle.  
Safety in special populations 
No clinically meaningful differences were seen across age groups in the incidence of AEs, IARs, 
infections  and  cytopenias.  Alemtuzumab  was  not  specifically  investigated  in  the  elderly  and 
the  clinical  studies  did  not  include  any  patients  aged  over  55  years.  This  was  appropriately 
reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
No patients younger than 18 years were included in the clinical programme. 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  not  different  in  males  (94.8%  IFNB  1a  and  97.8% 
alemtuzumab  12  mg/day)  versus  females  (94.4%  IFNB  1a  and  97.3%  alemtuzumab  12 
mg/day)  with  the  exception  of  endocrine  disorders,  which  were  reported  more  frequently  for 
females (17.3%) compared to males (5.6%) in the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group. 
No  studies  in  patients  with  renal  or  hepatic  impairment  were  performed.  Since  monoclonal 
antibodies  are  neither  metabolized  by  the  liver  nor  excreted  by  the  kidneys,  as  discussed  in 
the  Clinical  pharmacology  section,  the  CHMP  considered  that  studies  in  these  special 
populations were not needed.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In  the  active-controlled  studies,  2.3%  patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12 mg/day  group  and 
7.9%  in  the  IFNB-1a  group  discontinued  treatment  due  to  an  AE  during  the  2-year  study 
period.  SAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment were even less frequent: 0.8% patients 
in the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group and 2.0% in the IFNB-1a group. 
The AEs leading to discontinuation of treatment in more than one patient in the alemtuzumab 
12  mg/day  group  were  non-cardiac  chest  pain  (3  patients),  hypothyroidism,  infusion-related 
reaction,  MS  relapse  and  dyspnea  (2  patients  each).    Of  note,  despite  the  high  frequency  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 87/116 
 
  
  
infusion associated reactions (IARs) in alemtuzumab-treated patients, only a small proportion 
of patients (0.8%) discontinued treatment due to an IAR.   
The most frequent AEs leading to discontinuation of IFNB-1a were mainly related to MS factors 
and the tolerability issues linked to the use of IFNB-1a: MS relapse (5 patients), influenza-like 
illness 
(4  patients),  hepatic  enzyme 
increased 
(3 patients)  and 
lymphopenia, 
thrombocytopenia,  injection  site  erythema,  injection  site  pain,  pyrexia,  depression  and  mood 
altered (2 patients each).   
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Alemtuzumab  was  previously  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  B-CLL  in  a  more  than  tenfold 
higher  cumulative  dose.  The  previous  experience  with  alemtuzumab  provided  important 
information, e.g. relevant to the use of appropriate pre-medications to avoid cytokine release. 
Nevertheless, while it could be argued that a higher dose in more than 38,000 patients from 
the  B-CLL  safety  database  should  be  reassuring  and  a  lower  dose  should  then  be  considered 
safer,  the  safety  findings  with  alemtuzumab  used  in  MS  support  the  hypothesis  that  for  an 
immunomodulatory  biologic,  the  safety  profile  is  not  necessarily  dose-dependent  but  rather 
only  different,  as  compared  to  the  high  dose.  For  example,  the  occurrence  of  autoimmune 
phenomena with alemtuzumab in MS was not expected from the B-CLL experience and severe 
opportunistic infections, commonly observed with alemtuzumab in the B-CLL indication, were 
not observed to that extent in the MS indication.  
The  clinical  development  programme  for  alemtuzumab  in  MS  involved  a  sufficient  number  of 
patients with an adequate follow-up period.  
The CHMP considered that data from the completed, active-controlled studies and the ongoing 
extension were pooled in order to improve the precision of the estimates and gain insight into 
or identify safety signals for lower frequency events. Pooling of alemtuzumab safety data was 
accepted  as  all  studies  were  conducted  in  patients  with  RRMS,  the  alemtuzumab  treatment 
regimen was the same in all studies and all controlled trials used IFNB-1a as an active control. 
A  comparison  of  baseline  characteristics  in  studies  CAMMS223,  CAMMS32  and  CAMMS324 
suggested  that  the  treatment  groups  were  similar  across  studies  with  the  only  notable 
differences  occurring  in  baseline  EDSS  score  and  time  since  initial  MS  episode  in  the 
CAMMS324 patients, which was expected as a result of study entry criteria. 
The  safety  profiles  following  alemtuzumab  treatment  were  not  different  across  the  individual 
studies. The majority of AEs in both treatment groups were of mild or moderate severity. 
Of  note,  the  overall  incidence  of  AEs  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  generally 
decreased  over  time  through  Year  4.  The  CHMP  considered  that  it  was  difficult  to  estimate 
whether the decrease in AEs over time is driven by the long-term modulation of the immune 
system, increase of unwanted immunogenicity (thus preventing on-target toxicity), or due to 
an artifact of the naturally smaller database in longer-term exposed patients. 
Nearly  all  patients  in  the  studies  reported  at  least  one  AE,  although  the  total  number  of 
reported  events  was  higher  in  the  alemtuzumab-treated  patients.    This  was  mostly  due  the 
higher number of patients randomized to receive alemtuzumab than IFNB-1a, but the number 
of  IARs  reported  for  alemtuzumab-treated  patients  was  also  a  contributory  factor,  as 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 88/116 
 
  
  
supported by a safety analysis excluding IARs.  
The percentage of patients with treatment-related AEs (as assessed by the investigators) was 
higher  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  than  in  the  IFNB-1a  group,  but  this  was 
considered in view of the unblinded design, i.e. treating physicians and patients were aware of 
the treatment assignment. 
With respect to the severity of adverse events, the incidence of AEs of Grade 3 or higher was 
greater in the alemtuzumab pooled dose group and the 24 mg/day group compared to the 12 
mg/day group. A similar trend towards a worse safety profile was observed also with respect 
to some of the events of special interest, e.g. immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).  The 
CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  these  findings  were  supportive  of  the  applicant´s  decision  not  to 
pursue the higher dose group based on a less favorable safety profile. 
The  CHMP  discussed  the  following  events  more  specifically  during  their  review:  infusion 
associated reactions (IARs), thyroid disorders, ITP, nephropathy and infections, ensuring that 
these  safety  issues  are  appropriately  addressed  in  the  risk  management  plan  and  in  the 
Product Information. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  IARs  are  a  known  phenomenon  with  alemtuzumab,  as  they 
were  previously  documented  in  the  B-CLL  indication,  albeit  in  a  considerably  more  severe 
form. Although most MS patients treated with alemtuzumab 12 mg/day reported at least one 
IAR,  these  were  mostly  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  and  manageable  with  prophylactic 
corticosteroids, antihistamines and antipyretics. The incidences of IARs were generally higher 
in the alemtuzumab 24 mg/day group with a higher incidence also of severe (Grade 3 and 4) 
IARs, suggesting that the tolerability of the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day dose is superior to that 
of the 24 mg/day dose and supportive of the applicant´s decision to apply for approval of the 
12  mg/day  dose.  Serious  IARs  were  reported  in  2.8%  of  patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12 
mg/day group and included one case of a Grade 4 anaphylactic reaction. The CHMP requested 
that  the  information  about  IARs  should  be  reflected  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC,  including 
warnings  and  precautions  to  be  taken,  including  monitoring  of  the  patient  during  and  for 
2 hours after the infusion. 
The  incidence  of  IARs  was  not  different  between  anti-alemtuzumab  antibody  positive  and 
negative patients, as supported by a number of analyses presented by the applicant. The lack 
of  apparent  clinical  impact  of  both  binding  and  neutralizing  (“inhibitory”)  antibodies  could  be 
explained  by  the  strong  premedication  with  methylprednisolone,  which  is  part  of  any 
alemtuzumab treatment cycle. The clinical impact of immunogenicity on safety was therefore 
considered by the CHMP less prominent than in situations where no premedication is foreseen. 
Based  on  the  review  of  the  available  safety  data,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  treatment 
with  alemtuzumab  may  increase  the  risk  of  autoimmune  conditions,  particularly  antibody-
mediated  autoimmunity,  including  thyroid  disorders,  ITP  or  rarely  nephropathies  (e.g.  anti-
GBM  disease).  The  mechanisms  underlying  the  increased  risk  were  not  fully  established. 
Literature  suggested  that  peripheral  T  cells  proliferate  in  response  to  self-antigens  in 
lymphopenic hosts, but proliferation toward these antigens is prevented when T cell numbers 
are normal; in lymphopenia multiple co-factors could lead to a loss of self-tolerance after the 
“first  hit”  of  induction  of  lymphopenia  (“two-hit  model”,  described  e.g.  by  Krupica  et  al,  Clin 
Immunol (2006) 120, 121-128).  Of note, occurrence of autoimmunity was observed in other 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 89/116 
 
  
  
settings  of  immune  reconstitution  in  lymphocytopenic  patients  (e.g.  Graves’  disease  with 
HAART  or  after  allogeneic  HST)  and  MS  patients  have  an  increased  background  risk  for 
development  of  other  autoimmune  diseases.  However, 
the  CHMP  considered  that 
autoimmunity  should  not  be  seen  as  an  inevitable  consequence  of  lymphopenia.    Most 
lymphopenic subjects do not develop autoimmunity, suggesting that additional co-factors are 
required. During the clinical development, the applicant implemented several risk identification 
and  minimisation  measures  for  early  detection  of  autoimmune  conditions,  such  as  frequent 
laboratory measures. In literature IL-21 was suggested as a potential predictive biomarker of 
autoimmunity.  The  CHMP  recommended  that  the  applicant  should  further  investigate  its 
potential  usefulness  and  feasibility  as  well  as  continue  to  explore  additional  potential 
biomarkers.   
Based  on  the  findings  regarding  the  effect  on  the  thyroid,  the  CHMP  considered  that  thyroid 
function  tests,  such  as  thyroid  stimulating  hormone  levels,  should  be  obtained  prior  to 
initiation  of  treatment  and  every  3  months  thereafter  until  48  months  following  the  last 
infusion.  After  this  period  of  time,  testing  should  be  performed  based  on  clinical  findings 
suggestive of thyroid dysfunction. This was reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Serious events of ITP were observed in approximately 1% of patients treated in the controlled 
clinical  trials  in  MS.  Of  note,  one  patient  developed  ITP  that  went  unrecognised  prior  to 
implementation  of  monthly  blood  monitoring  requirements  and  died  from  intracerebral 
haemorrhage.  The  CHMP  considered  that  during  the  development  programme,  the  applicant 
reacted  on  the  emerging  safety  issues  such  as  occurrence  of  ITP  by  intensifying  the  safety 
monitoring  in  the  clinical  studies.  These  monitoring  measures  formed  the  basis  for  the 
proposed risk minimization strategies. In particular, as part of the risk minimization strategy, 
complete  blood  counts  (CBC)  with  differential  should  be  obtained  prior  to  initiation  of 
treatment and at monthly intervals thereafter until 48 months after the last infusion. If ITP is 
suspected,  a  complete  blood  count  should  be  obtained  immediately.  The  patient  information 
material  explicitly  informs  about  signs  and  symptoms  of  ITP,  which  was  endorsed  by  the 
CHMP. 
Nephropathies,  including  anti-glomerular  basement  membrane  (anti-GBM)  disease,  were 
observed  in  0.3%  of  patients  in  clinical  trials  in  MS  and  occurred  within  up  to  39  months 
following the last administration of alemtuzumab.  In clinical trials, there were 2 cases of anti-
GBM  disease.    In  order  to  minimise  the  risk,  the  applicant  proposed  monthly  urinalysis  and 
serum  creatinine  monitoring  through  to  48  months  after  the  last  alemtuzumab  dose  as  a 
marker to detect anti-GBM disease.  Anti-GBM disease is usually rapidly evolving with patients 
developing  terminal  renal  failure  within  days,  if  left  untreated  and  hence,  timely  diagnosis  is 
important.  The  measures  to  minimise  the  risks  were  discussed  by  the  CHMP.  The  CHMP 
considered that while monthly serum creatinine may not be rapid enough to capture an acute 
event, it would nevertheless be useful to capture potential other nephropathies developing in a 
more  subacute  manner,  and  also  to  raise  awareness  of  patients  and  treating  doctors.  The 
Product Information and the educational material were adequately revised to ensure that the 
patient  remains  vigilant  for  symptoms  of  nephropathies  and  seek  immediate  medical  help 
accordingly. 
The  most  frequently  reported  infections  for  both  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  and  IFNB-1a 
groups were the types of infections that are commonly described in most MS treatment trials 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 90/116 
 
  
  
and  included  nasopharyngitis,  urinary  tract  infection  (UTI),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection, 
sinusitis  and  influenza.    Additionally,  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group,  oral  herpes  and 
bronchitis were listed among the most frequent infections. The CHMP considered that with the 
implementation of prophylactic acyclovir during the phase 3 studies (starting on the first day 
of each alemtuzumab cycle and continuing for 28 days after the last day), the risk of herpes 
simplex  infection  was  substantially  reduced  as  compared  to  those  who  did  not  receive 
prophylaxis.    Fungal  infections  were  also  reported  more  frequently  in  alemtuzumab-treated 
patients  with  none  of  them  being  systemic.  The  most  common  fungal  infections  were  oral 
candidiasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis. 
Tuberculosis  was  reported  in  alemtuzumab-treated  patients  in  the  active-controlled  clinical 
trials.  The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  before  initiation  of  therapy,  all  patients  must  be 
evaluated  for  both  active  or  latent  tuberculosis  infection,  according  to  local  guidelines.  This 
was reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Given  the  degree  of  lymphocyte  depletion  immediately  following  alemtuzumab  infusion,  the 
CHMP  considered  noteworthy  that  the  incidence  of  serious  infections  on  alemtuzumab 
treatment  was  not  substantially  higher  than  in  patients  receiving  IFNB-1a.  Serious  infections 
reported  in  ≥2  patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  group  included  appendicitis, 
gastroenteritis,  herpes  zoster,  tooth  infection  and  pneumonia.  Analysis  of  the  incidence  of 
infections  by  month  showed  the  highest  incidence  in  the  first  month  after  each  cycle  (i.e., 
Month 1 and Month 13) and the largest increase during the first month after initiation of the 
first treatment cycle.  
Human  papillomavirus  infections  were  reported  for  2.4%  of  patients  in  the  alemtuzumab  12 
mg/day group and 1.4% in the IFNB-1a group in the active-controlled trials. While there was 
not  an  apparent  link  to  an  increased  risk  of  cervical  pathology,  as  the  incidence  of  cervical 
dysplasia was similar in both treatment groups (1.1% and 1.0%, respectively), the applicant 
proposed routine screening for HPV infection in women treated with alemtuzumab, as reflected 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC. This was endorsed by the CHMP. 
In the active-controlled studies, 4 (0.4%) patients in the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group and 
2  (0.4%)  patients  in  the  IFNB-1a  group  had  a  malignancy  during  the  2-year  follow-up.    The 
malignancies in the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day group were 3 cases of thyroid cancer and one of 
basal cell carcinoma, while in the IFNB-1a group  were acute  myeloid leukemia and basal cell 
carcinoma. A total of 15 events were reported in 13 (0.9%) patients during all available follow 
up for all alemtuzumab-treated patients, among them thyroid, basal cell carcinoma and breast 
cancer, which is in line with the most frequently reported cancers in white, young adults in the 
general  population.  The  CHMP  considered  that  of  the  five  thyroid  malignancies  in 
alemtuzumab-treated  patients,  three  occurred  in  patients  who  reported  relevant  pre-existing 
conditions, including existing thyroid neoplasm and thyroid nodules. Whether administration of 
alemtuzumab  could  have  been  a  trigger  or  accelerator  to  a  pre-existing  dormant  malignancy 
remains  unknown.  The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that,  given  the  relatively  short  observation 
period  in  a  pre-authorisation  setting,  firm  conclusion  as  regards  the  risk  of malignancy  could 
not be made. The CHMP considered that malignancy is reflected in the Risk Management Plan 
as  an  important  potential  risk  and  that  the  issue  will  be  further  monitored  in  the  post-
authorisation  setting  by  means  of  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities,  including  a  PASS 
study.

Changes  in  laboratory  parameters  were  generally  consistent  with  the  expected  clinical 
manifestations  of  RRMS  and  the  known  pharmacodynamic  effects  of  the  respective 
treatments,  i.e.  alemtuzumab  (especially  lymphopenia)  or  IFNB-1a.  A  higher  proportion  of 
patients with occult blood, hematuria or proteinuria were flagged as clinically significant during 
the  2-year  follow-up  period  in  the  alemtuzumab  12 mg/day  group  than  the  IFNB-1a  group, 
which  might  be  a  consequence  of  the  more  frequent  (monthly)  testing  in  the  alemtuzumab 
group  versus  the  quarterly  testing  in  IFNB-1a-treated  patients.  Elevations  in  hepatic  enzyme 
ALT  and  AST  levels  were  more  frequent  in  IFNB-1a-treated  patients  than  in  alemtuzumab-
treated patients in the 2-year follow-up period in the active-controlled studies. Asymptomatic 
elevations  of  hepatic  transaminases  are  described  in  the  Rebif  Product  Information.  Post-
baseline  bilirubin  values  ≥1.5  x  ULN  were  more  frequent  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day 
group  (3.5%  of  patients)  than  in  the  IFNB-1a  group  (1.8%).  The  laboratory  findings  with 
alemtuzumab  were  in  general  not  accompanied  by  clinical  signs  suggestive  of  impairment  of 
hepatic  function.  Alemtuzumab  was  associated  with  fewer  hematologic  abnormalities  than 
IFNB-1a with respect to parameters other than lymphocyte depletion. 
With respect to safety in women of child-bearing potential, the CHMP considered that human 
IgG is known to cross the placental barrier and thus, alemtuzumab may potentially pose a risk 
to the fetus. It is not known whether alemtuzumab can cause fetal harm when administered to 
pregnant  women  or  whether  it  can  affect  reproductive  capacity.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  was  of 
the  view  that  women  of  child  bearing  potential  should  use  effective  contraceptive  measures 
when receiving a course of treatment and for 4 months following that course of treatment. The 
possibility  of  administering  alemtuzumab  during  pregnancy  was  discussed  by  the  CHMP.  A 
total of 72 pregnancies for female patients treated with alemtuzumab were reported as of 31 
December 2011. The spontaneous abortion rate was calculated to be approximately 20%. No 
congenital  abnormalities  or  birth  defects  have  been  reported  in  the  MS  clinical  programme. 
The CHMP concluded that  the use of alemtuzumab  during pregnancy should be based on  the 
physician´s assessment of benefit-risk for the individual patient. This was reflected in section 
4.6  of  the  SmPC  as  follows:  LEMTRADA  should  be  administered  during  pregnancy  only  if  the 
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.  
The  post-marketing  safety  data  came  from  alemtuzumab  use  primarily  in  the  treatment  of 
patients with B-CLL. As discussed above, while the totality of experience in B-CLL provides a 
useful  background  to  assess  events  occurring  with  higher  and  more  frequent  doses  of 
alemtuzumab, the applicability of these data to an MS population was seen as limited by the 
CHMP due to significant differences in the patient populations and dosing regimens for B-CLL 
and MS. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall,  based  on  the  available  safety  data,  the  CHMP  considered  that  while  several  safety 
concerns  were  identified,  provided  that  appropriate  post-authorisation  measures  are  in  place 
(as summarised in section 2.8 Risk Management Plan), alemtuzumab can be used safely in the 
proposed indication. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials were included in 
the SmPC.

antihistamines and/or antipyretics prior to 
Lemtrada administration may also be considered.  
Most patients in controlled clinical trials received 
antihistamines and/or antipyretics before at least 1 
Lemtrada infusion. IARs may occur in patients 
despite pretreatment. Observation for infusion 
reactions is recommended during and for 2 hours 
after Lemtrada infusion. Resources for the 
management of hypersensitivity and/or 
anaphylactic reactions should be available. If an 
IAR occurs, provide the appropriate symptomatic 
treatment, as needed. If the infusion is not well 
tolerated, the infusion duration may be extended. If 
severe infusion reactions occur, including 
anaphylactic reactions immediate discontinuation of 
the intravenous infusion should be considered. 
SmPC 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for 
Use: Thyroid function tests (TFT’s), such as 
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, should 
be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and 
every 3 months thereafter until 48 months 
following the last infusion 
SmPC 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for 
Use: Complete blood counts (CBC) with 
differential should be obtained prior to initiation of 
treatment and at monthly intervals thereafter until 
48 months after the last infusion.  If ITP is 
suspected, a CBC with differential should be 
obtained immediately. 
If ITP onset is confirmed, appropriate medical 
intervention should be promptly initiated, 
including referral to a specialist.  Data from clinical 
trials in MS has shown that adherence to the blood 
monitoring requirements and education relative to 
signs and symptoms of ITP has led to early 
detection and treatment of ITP with most cases 
responding to first-line medical therapy. 
SmPC 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for 
Use: Serum creatinine levels should be obtained 
prior to initiation of treatment and at monthly

- Patient guide 
Tuberculosis screening should be done according to

local guidelines prior to initiation of alemtuzumab. 
Physicians should consider delaying initiation of 
alemtuzumab administration in patients with active 
infection until the infection is fully controlled. 
Prophylaxis with an oral anti-herpes agent should 
be initiated starting on the first day of 
alemtuzumab treatment and continuing for a 
minimum of 1 month following each course of 
treatment. Alemtuzumab has not been 
administered for treatment of MS concomitantly 
with antineoplastic or immunosuppressive 
therapies. Concomitant use of alemtuzumab with 
any of these therapies could increase the risk of 
immunosuppression. 
No data are available on the association of 
alemtuzumab with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or 
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) reactivation as patients with 
evidence of active or chronic infections were 
excluded from clinical trials. Screening patients at 
high risk of HBV and/or HCV infection before 
initiation of alemtuzumab should be considered, 
and caution should be exercised in prescribing 
alemtuzumab to patients identified as carriers of 
HBV and/or HCV, as these patients may be at risk 
of irreversible liver damage relative to a potential 
virus reactivation as a consequence of their pre-
existing status.

(Section 4.4), and Fertility, Pregnancy and 
Lactation (Section 4.6): 
Fertility 
There are no adequate clinical safety data on the 
effect of Lemtrada on fertility. In a sub-study in 13 
male alemtuzumab-treated patients (treated with 
either 12 mg or 24 mg), there was no evidence of 
aspermia, azoospermia, consistently depressed 
sperm count, motility disorders or an increase in 
sperm morphological abnormalities. CD52 is known 
to be present in human and rodent reproductive 
tissues. Although animal data have not shown a 
direct effect on fertility in male humanised mice 
(see section 5.3), a potential impact on human 
fertility during the period of exposure is unknown 
based on the collective available data. 
Pregnancy 
SmPC Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation (Section 
4.6): 
None 
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of 
Lemtrada in pregnant women. No formal studies 
have been conducted. Lemtrada should be 
administered during pregnancy only if the 
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the 
foetus. 
Human IgG is known to cross the placental 
barrier; alemtuzumab may cross the placental 
barrier as well and thus potentially pose a risk to 
the foetus.  It is not known whether alemtuzumab 
can cause foetal harm when administered to 
pregnant women or whether it can affect 
reproductive capacity. 
Thyroid disease (see section 4.4) poses special risks 
in women who are pregnant. Without treatment of 
hypothyroidism during pregnancy, there is an 
increased risk for miscarriage and foetal effects 
such as mental retardation and dwarfism.  In 
mothers with Graves’ disease, maternal thyroid 
stimulating hormone receptor antibodies can be 
transferred to a developing foetus and can cause 
transient neonatal Graves’ disease.

Breast-feeding 
Lemtrada was detected in the milk and offspring of 
lactating female mice administered 10 mg/kg for 5 
consecutive days postpartum. 
It is unknown whether Lemtrada is excreted in 
human milk. A risk to the suckling child cannot be 
excluded. Breast feeding should be discontinued 
during each course of treatment with Lemtrada and 
for 4 months following the last infusion of each 
treatment course.  No data are available on 
detection of alemtuzumab in breast milk after a 
course of Lemtrada treatment. Benefits of conferred 
immunity through breast- milk may outweigh the 
risks of potential exposure to alemtuzumab for the 
suckling child. 
SmPC 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for 
use: It is recommended that patients have 
completed local immunisation requirements at 
least 6 weeks prior to treatment with 
alemtuzumab.  The ability to generate an 
immune response to any vaccine following 
alemtuzumab treatment has not been studied. 
The safety of immunisation with live viral 
vaccines following a course of alemtuzumab 
treatment has not been formally studied in 
controlled clinical trials in MS and should not be 
administered to MS patients who have recently 
received a course of alemtuzumab. 
Varicella zoster virus antibody testing/vaccination 
As for any immune modulating drug, before 
initiating a course of alemtuzumab treatment, 
patients without a history of chickenpox or 
without vaccination against varicella zoster 
virus (VZV) should be tested for antibodies to 
VZV.  VZV vaccination of antibody-negative 
patients should be considered prior to 
treatment initiation with alemtuzumab.  To 
allow for the full effect of the VZV vaccination 
to occur, postpone treatment with 
alemtuzumab for 6 weeks following vaccination

The  PRAC,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  proposed  risk 
minimisation  measures  are  sufficient  to  minimise  the  risks  of  the  product  in  the  proposed 
indication.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes. 
With respect to the PASS OBS13434, the CHMP considered that the applicant should target a 
higher number of sites in order to increase the rate of enrolment. As an additional measure to 
prompt availability of safety data, the applicant was requested to implement annual reporting 
from  this  study  and  submit  an  interim  report  5  years  after  study  initiation.  The  applicant 
amended the PASS study protocol synopsis accordingly. 
The  changes  also  concerned  the  risk  minimisation  measures  pertaining  to  nephropathies 
including  anti-GBM  disease.  Specifically,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  urinalysis  with  microscopy 
should be obtained at monthly, rather than quarterly, intervals until 48 months after the last 
infusion. 
2.9.  User consultation 
The  results  of  the  user  consultation  with  target  patient  groups  on  the  package  leaflet 
submitted by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as 
set  out  in  the  Guideline  on  the  readability  of  the  label  and  package  leaflet  of  medicinal 
products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
One active-controlled phase 2 study and two active-controlled phase 3 studies formed the core 
of  the  development  programme  for  alemtuzumab  in  MS.  The  phase  2  study  (CAMS223)  and 
one  of  the  phase  3  studies  (CAMMS323)  included  treatment-naïve  RRMS  patients  and  the 
other phase  3 study (CAMMS324) included RRMS patients who had relapsed on therapy. The 
three studies shared features such as endpoints, which allowed for an inter-study comparison 
of results. 
The indication initially applied for was: “Lemtrada is indicated for adult patients with relapsing 
remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to decrease the frequency of relapses and slow or reverse 
accumulation of disability.” 
The  clinical  programme  of  alemtuzumab  demonstrated  a  convincing  statistical  and  clinical 
effect  on  relapse  rate,  one  of  the  co-primary  end-points,  in  both  treatment-naïve  RRMS 
patients  and  RRMS  patients  failing  first-line  therapy.  In  studies  CAMMS323  and  CAMMS324, 
the  relapse  rate  through  2  years  was  significantly  reduced  in  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day 
group  by  55%  and  49%,  respectively,  as  compared  with  IFNB-1a  (p  <0.0001).  The  relapse 
rate  through  2  years  was  significantly  reduced  by  57%  compared  with  IFNB-1a  (p  <0.0001) 
also  in  the  discontinued  24  mg/day  group  in  study  CAMMS324.  In  study  CAMMS223,    the 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013

relapse rate was reduced in the alemtuzumab 12 mg/day and 24 mg/day groups by 67% and 
77%, respectively, compared with IFNB-1a (p<0.0001). 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  applicant´s  choice  of  the  active  comparator  for  the  clinical 
programme was made in compliance with the CHMP Scientific Advice and set a higher hurdle 
in establishing efficacy as compared to placebo. Rebif (INFB-A) is considered to be effective as 
a first-line treatment of RRMS. Therefore, using this product as an active control was viewed 
as appropriate to evaluate a product intended as a first-line and second-line treatment. 
A superior effect on disability compared to INFB-1a was seen in the 12 mg/day group in study 
CAMMS324. In this study, alemtuzumab was seen to reduce the risk of SAD through 2 years 
by 42% compared with IFNB-1a (p= 0.0084). 
The  phase  2  study  CAMMS223  including  only  treatment-naïve  RRMS  patients  also  showed  a 
significant effect on SAD between the alemtuzumab arms and the INFB-1a arm, supporting a 
beneficial effect of alemtuzumab on SAD.  
Unlike  in  studies  CAMMS223  and  CAMMS324,  in  the  phase  3  study  CAMMS323  enrolling 
treatment-naïve  patients,  the  disability  component  of  the  co-primary  endpoint  was  not  met. 
The  difference  in  the  effect  on  SAD  between  the  alemtuzumab  12  mg/day  and  INFB-1a 
showed a trend (risk reduction of 30%), but it was not statistically significant (p=0.2173).  
Nevertheless,  the  CHMP  was  still  of  the  view  that  the  trend  seen  in  study  CAMMS323  was 
clinically relevant and supportive of alemtuzumab efficacy. In particular, the CHMP considered 
that the study was conducted as an actively controlled trial against high-dose beta-interferon, 
which  is  expected  to  have  an  effect  on  disability  progression,  increasing  the  hurdle  to  show 
statistical significance. The CHMP also considered that the failure to demonstrate effect on the 
SAD component in study CAMMS323 might be attributed to the lower disability progression in 
the  beta-interferon  arm  (11.1%)  than  expected  based  on  the  previous  observations  (i.e. 
expected  rate  of  disability  progression  of  20%).  Lower  than  expected  disease  activity  in  a 
comparator  arm  is  not  unprecedented  and  was  seen  for  other  drugs  in  MS  in  the  respective 
placebo groups. 
Recent literature suggested that  the combination of MRI lesion activity (indicative of ongoing 
inflammation) and relapse activity (i.e. the clinical manifestation of more severe inflammations 
or  lesions  involving  functionally  relevant  white  matter  areas)  correlates  with  subsequent 
accumulation of disability (Sormani et al, 2011). The CHMP agreed that mechanistically, this is 
supported,  since  continuous  inflammation  (as  measured  by  MRI),  even  if  not  clinically 
manifesting itself as a relapse, is a known feature of MS, and the literature suggested that MRI 
imaging  correlates  with  the  long-term  outcome  (Rudick  et  al,  2006).  It  was  also  considered 
that  MS  patients  show  higher  recruitment  of  functional  brain  areas  as  compared  to  healthy 
controls  in  order  to  fulfil  the  same  task  as  measured  by  functional  MRI  (Rachbauer  et  al, 
2006), indicating the need to compensate for existing, but still subclinical brain damage. The 
CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  this  suggests  that  disease  activity  in  MS  can  lead  to  brain 
damage  already  before  becoming  clinically  detectable  as  sustained  disability,  and  that  a 
certain  threshold  is  required  before  disability  becomes  clinically  apparent.    Based  on  this 
threshold  hypothesis,  it  is  plausible  that  within  a  follow-up  of  two  years,  a  significant  impact 
on  disability  separating  alemtuzumab  from  beta-interferon  may  not  yet  be  observed.  In  this 
respect,  the  effects  seen  in  more  advanced  patients  (study  CAMMS324)  were  considered  of 
Assessment report

importance,  since  the  likelihood  to  detect  an  impact  on  disability,  if  any,  is  higher  in  a 
population which is closer to the threshold of manifesting disability.  
Alemtuzumab  treatment  was  superior  to  beta-interferon  in  a  number  of  further  clinically 
relevant outcomes, including the increase in the percentage of patients who were relapse-free 
at Year 2, a reduction in the rate of relapses treated with steroids, the rate of severe relapses 
and reductions in relapses leading to hospitalisations. 
Highly significant outcomes in MRI parameters were observed supporting the claim of superior 
efficacy  of  alemtuzumab  over  beta-interferon.  As  discussed  above,  MRI  parameters  were 
considered of relevance by the CHMP, since they are a measure of disease activity and there is 
emerging evidence suggesting their role in predicting further course of the disease. The effect 
on  imaging  was  more  pronounced  in  the  second  year  of  treatment.  Alemtuzumab  showed  a 
superior effect as compared to high-dose beta-interferon on most MRI parameters, notably in 
the  number  of  newly  emerging  gadolinium-enhancing  lesions  (reflecting  active  inflammation 
due to local breakdown of the blood brain barrier at the site of inflammation), the number of 
newly  developing  T1-hypointense  lesions  (reflecting  places  where  axonal  density  was 
permanently  reduced  by  MS-related  tissue  destruction),  conversion  of  Gadolinium-Enhancing 
lesions  to  “black  holes”  (reflecting  progression  to  permanent  demyelination)  and  brain 
atrophy.  
Further  analyses  on  EDSS  supported  by  MSFC,  suggested  an  improvement  of  the  EDSS  over 
time.  Therefore,  the  applicant  initially  claimed  that  the  indication  should  also  reflect  on  the 
reversal  of  disability.  Following  input  from  the  SAG  Neurology  and  discussion  by  the  CHMP 
(see  section  2.5.3),  it  was  concluded  that  such  claim  was  not  adequately  supported  by  the 
current  dataset  and  could  be  misunderstood  by  patients  in  a  way  that  Lemtrada  could  heal 
MS. The applicant did not pursue this claim further.  
The  follow-up  efficacy  data  from  the  phase  2  trial  suggested  that  the  superiority  of 
alemtuzumab  over  beta-interferon  in  terms  of  slowing  the  accumulation  of  disability  may  be 
sustained over 5 years. 
With respect to the ongoing extension study CAMMS3409, the CHMP considered that data from 
a  relevant  number  of  patients  were  available  and  that  the  preliminary  efficacy  analyses, 
although considered exploratory, were supportive of a longer lasting efficacy of alemtuzumab 
in the treatment of MS. 
As  compared  to  the  active  control,  high-dose  beta-interferon  (Rebif),  several  adverse  events 
typical of interferon beta, such as flu-like symptoms and haematological alterations, occurred 
to a lesser extent with alemtuzumab.  
The  CHMP  also  considered  that  the  dosing  schedule  of  alemtuzumab,  i.e.  two  treatment 
courses  of  drug  administration,  on  5  and  3  consecutive  days  at  Year  1  and  2,  respectively, 
compared  to  s.c.  or  i.m.  injections  once  or  several  times  per  week  with  the  current  first-line 
therapy can be seen as more convenient and may be a benefit for the individual patient.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
A formal dose-finding study was not conducted for alemtuzumab in MS. The dosing in the pilot 
investigator-sponsored  MS  studies  was  guided  by  historical  data  from  oncology  use  and  by 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 103/116 
 
  
  
pilot  studies  in  patients  with  rheumatologic  disorders.  The  two  alemtuzumab  dose  levels  (12 
mg/day and 24 mg/day) used in the initial 3-year treatment period of the Phase 2 CAMMS223 
study bracketed the 20 mg/day pilot study dose in MS patients and were selected to identify 
any dose-dependent relationships in terms of efficacy or safety variables.  
While  the  outcomes  at  two  years  were  not  significantly  different  in  clinical  terms,  the  higher 
dose  suppressed  the  MRI  activity  more  potently,  which  could  have  a  beneficial  long-term 
impact on the disease course. This stronger effect of the 24 mg/day dose on the MRI could be 
interpreted  such  that  the  higher  dose  may  be  more  potent  and  effective  in  the  long  run. 
However, as the safety profile of the higher dose was less favourable compared to the lower 
dose and the efficacy of the higher dose was not superior over the lower dose, the 12 mg/day 
dose was considered the preferred option. 
The  choice  of  s.c.  IFNB-1a  (Rebif)  as an  active  comparator  precluded  a  double-blinded  study 
design,  as  discussed  in  section  2.5.3.    The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  the  open-label  design 
may  have  had  an  influence  on  the  outcomes.  However,  the  applicant  followed  the  CHMP 
Scientific  Advice  and  implemented  a  number  of  measures  to  improve  blinding.  In  particular, 
the studies were conducted as rater-blinded and designed to minimise the potential impact of 
treating  physicians  and  patients  being  aware  of  treatment  assignment  (both  patients  and 
raters  were  trained).  Furthermore,  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  to  evaluate  the 
potential impact of the rater-blinded study design on the co-primary efficacy analyses. Relapse 
determinations in the phase 3 studies were made  by a blinded  Relapse Adjudication Panel of 
independent  neurologists.  All  cranial  MRIs  were  evaluated  by  neuro-radiologists  at  an 
independent  central  facility  with  no  access  to  the  patients’  treatment  assignment  and  the 
results of these evaluations were not provided to study sites. The CHMP was of the view that 
these measures were appropriate to ensure blinding to a sufficient extent, and considered that 
a GCP inspection did not identify any critical findings. 
Patients  in  study  CAMMS223  (unlike  in  the  phase  III  studies)  did  not  participate  in  training 
runs of MSFC implemented to reduce practice effects. Therefore, an improvement in MSFC in 
this  study  could  be  attributed  to  a  training  effect.  However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  this 
should not be of major impact, since the effect would apply to both arms. 
A superior effect on disability compared to INFB-1a was seen in the 12 mg/day group in study 
CAMMS324. In this study, alemtuzumab was seen to reduce the risk of SAD through 2 years 
by 42% compared with IFNB-1a (p= 0.0084). However, it should be noted that alemtuzumab 
was  compared  to  INFB-1a  in  patients  previously  failing  first  line  therapy  including  the 
comparator  INFB-1a.  Consequently,  the  observed  effect  of  the  IFNB-1a  comparator  on 
disability  and  relapse  rate  could  have  been  less  pronounced  than  would  be  expected  if  the 
study  had  included  exclusively  a  patient  population  previously  failing  a  different  first  line 
therapy, e.g. glatiramer acetate.  
In  open-label  follow-up  of  alemtuzumab  clinical  trials,  some  patients  received  additional  “as 
needed” treatment upon documented evidence of resumed MS disease activity.  The additional 
courses were administered at 12 mg/day for 3 consecutive days (36 mg total dose) at least 12 
months after the prior treatment course. The benefits of >2 treatment courses were not fully 
established.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  therapy  should  be  recommended  as  2  treatment 
courses, as reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Furthermore, if additional treatment courses

are  to  be  given  they  must  be  administered  at  least  12  months  after  the  prior  course,  as 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Alemtuzumab  (MabCampath)  was  approved  from  July  2001  until  August  2012  as  a  single 
agent  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  B-CLL  with  an  estimated  exposure  of  >38,000 
patients  as  of  May  2011,  and  was  used  in  clinical  studies  in  MS  since  2002.  The  marketing 
authorisation of MabCampath was withdrawn voluntarily by the MAH for commercial reasons. 
In  view  of  the  CHMP,  the  experience  with  previous  exposure  of  patients  to  alemtuzumab  in 
patients  with  B-CLL  was  on  one  hand  relevant,  since  data  were  available  as  regards  for 
example  appropriate  pre-medications  to  avoid  cytokine  release  etc.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
patient  populations  for  MS  and  B-CLL  are  quite  different  and  the  dose  in  B-CLL  is  likewise 
considerably higher (the cumulative dose was more than tenfold). The CHMP considered that 
for  a  biological  immunomodulator,  a  lower  dose  is  not  necessarily  safer  than  a  higher  dose, 
but may display a distinct safety profile. 
For  example,  the  occurrence  of  autoimmune  phenomena  with  alemtuzumab  in  MS  was  not 
expected  from  the  B-CLL  experience.  Pathogenesis  of  these  phenomena  is  not  fully 
understood,  but  it  may  involve  repopulation  of  the  B-  and  T-cells  in  predisposed  patients. 
During the conduct of the clinical studies, the applicant reacted to occurrence of these events 
by  intensifying  the  safety  monitoring  and  evaluating  effectiveness  of  the  measures  with 
respect  to  early  detection  of  emerging  adverse  events  and  their  treatment.  This  formed  the 
basis for strengthening the risk management strategies. 
Several risks were identified, including infections and infusion-associated reactions. The risk of 
infections,  including  re-activation  of  latent  infections,  is  one  of  the  main  safety  concerns  for 
immunomodulating agents/ monoclonal antibodies.  The serious infections reported in the MS 
population included amongst others herpes/varicella, HPV and tuberculosis infections. Some of 
them occurred months after initiation of treatment.  
The  most  common  adverse  events  related  to  treatment  with  alemtuzumab  were  infusion-
associated  reactions  occurring  between  start  and  stop  of  infusion  +24  hrs,  such  as  rash, 
pyrexia  and  urticaria,  and  infections  such  as  nasopharyngitis,  urinary  tract  infections  and 
upper  respiratory  infections.    Of  note,  a  relatively  high  number  of  cardiac  events  (around 
12%)  were  labelled  as  infusion-associated  (including  seven  cases  considered  as  serious 
adverse  events).  However,  in  general  the  IARs  were  manageable  and  their  frequency 
decreased after the first cycle.  
The  cumulative  proportion  of  patients  experiencing  thyroid  events  (including  hypo-  and 
hyperthyroidism,  Basedow´s  disease,  laboratory  abnormalities  and  anti-TPO  antibodies)  over 
a  follow-up  of  8  years  was  44.7%.  No  clear  mechanisms  of  these  effects  were  found.  The 
CHMP considered that this effect will have a major impact on the MS population treated with 
alemtuzumab and that appropriate monitoring needs to be put in place. To this end, the CHMP 
was of the view that thyroid function test, such as thyroid stimulating hormone levels, should 
be  obtained  prior  to  initiation  of  treatment  and  every  3  months  thereafter  until  48  months 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 105/116 
 
  
  
following  the  last  infusion.  The  4-year  timeframe  was  based  on  the  median  time  that  the 
events  were  observed.  After  this  period,  it  was  considered  sufficient  to  perform  the  tests 
based on  clinical findings suggestive of thyroid dysfunction, as reflected in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC. 
Contraindication  of  alemtuzumab  in  patients  with  thyroid  disorders  was  not  considered 
appropriate  by  the  CHMP,  given  the  intensive  follow-up  in  place  and  the  fact  that  these 
patients  could  still  benefit  from  the  treatment.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  use  of 
alemtuzumab  in  patients  with  ongoing  thyroid  disorder  should  be  based  on  the  physician´s 
assessment  of  benefit-risk  for  the  individual  patient.  This  was  reflected  in  section  4.4  of  the 
SmPC as follows: LEMTRADA in patients with ongoing thyroid disorder should be administered 
if the potential benefit justifies the potential risks.  
Further  autoimmune  conditions  confirmed  as  important  identified  risks  by  the  CHMP  were 
immune thrombocytopenic purpura and nephropathies. 
ITP was medically confirmed in 16 out of 22 identified patients, one of which died of ITP and 
cerebral  haemorrhage  prior  to  implementing  CBC  into  the  study  schedules.  Nephropathies 
occurred  in  5  patients  treated  with  alemtuzumab,  including  2  patients  with  the  anti-GBM 
disease. 
Importantly,  the  treatments  of  adverse  events  such  as  ITP  or  infusion  reactions  were  not 
expected to negatively impact the underlying condition (RRMS). For example, ITP is normally 
treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids, both of which were described as 
having 
favourable 
impact  on  RRMS.  Likewise 
the  anti-inflammatory  premedication 
(methylprednisolone)  is  the  same  as  used  in  treatment  of  an  MS  relapse  and  thus  was  not 
expected to be harmful to the course of RRMS. Finally, antiviral prophylaxis with acyclovir was 
also  not  expected  to  adversely  impact  on  MS,  since  data  in  literature  suggested  a  potential 
beneficial and at least not harmful effect of some antivirals such as gancyclovir on the course 
of MS. 
In the alemtuzumab pooled dose group over all available follow-up, a total of 15 malignancies 
was reported. The most common malignancies reported in more than 1 alemtuzumab-treated 
patient  were  thyroid  cancer  (5  patients),  basal  cell  carcinoma  (3  patients)  and  breast  cancer 
(2 patients). The CHMP considered that there were also cases of cancer of viral or potentially 
viral  origin,  including  a  case  of  cervical  carcinoma  (HPV+),  vulvar  carcinoma  (HPV+)  and 
Burkitt´s lymphoma. The patient with Burkitt´s lymphoma died of sepsis during the course of 
chemotherapy to treat the underlying malignancy. The CHMP considered that malignancies are 
adequately reflected in the RMP as an important potential risk. The issue is discussed further 
in section “Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects”. 
Immunogenicity 
Most patients in the phase 3 studies tested positive for anti-alemtuzumab antibodies and also 
inhibitory  antibodies,  and  both  the  occurrence  of  antibodies  against  alemtuzumab  and  their 
titer increased upon re-exposure, i.e. cycle 2. The occurrence of an immune response per se is 
not necessarily a problem and can be expected for a biological; it is the clinical consequences 
which should guide the clinical assessment. Following the CHMP Guideline on immunogenicity 
assessment 
of  monoclonal 
antibodies 
intended 
for 
in 
vivo 
clinical 
use 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013

EMA/CHMP/BMWP/86289/2010,  a  risk-based  approach  is  recommended  considering  also  the 
clinical context and availability of alternative treatments. 
Usually, the immunogenicity of humanised antibodies is observed in around 5-10% of patients 
(in  chronic  and  continuous  treatment,  depending  on  the  clinical  indication  etc.),  but  the 
immunogenicity of alemtuzumab was considerably higher. MS is an autoimmune disease, and 
patients  with  a  pre-activated  immune  system  may  thus  be  at  higher  risk  of  developing  an 
unwanted immune response.  
Alemtuzumab depletes B and T cells, thus potentially eliminating the effector cells which would 
be  capable  of  mounting  an  immune  response.  On  the  other  hand,  alemtuzumab  was  also 
considered  to  be  involved  in  triggering  of  other  autoimmune  phenomena  such  as  anti-GBM 
glomerulonephritis  or  thyroid  autoimmune  conditions.  Therefore,  the  mechanistic  impact  of 
alemtuzumab  on  a  predisposition  to  mounting  an  unwanted  immune  response  is  difficult  to 
estimate.  Alemtuzumab  is  administered  as  a  cyclic  treatment  where  every  new  treatment 
cycle  could  be  recognised  by  the  immune  system  as  a  kind  of  a  “vaccination”.  This  may 
explain the considerable triggering of an immune response with cycle 2 and is most probably 
the likely explanation of the high immunogenicity. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  following  aspects  are  important  for  a  risk-based  approach  to 
the observed high incidence of an unwanted immune response: 
• 
The  efficacy  of  alemtuzumab  is  considerable  across  studies  including  relevant  subgroups. 
Analysis by presence or absence of inhibitory antibodies did not suggest relevant impact of 
anti-alemtuzumab  antibodies.  This  might  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  B  and  T  cell 
depletion  with  alemtuzumab  could  be  that  rapid  that  any  immune  response  would  take 
longer to be triggered or reactivated again. 
•  MS is a disease, where loss of efficacy (reoccurrence of disease activity) would be detected 
by  regular  MRI  scans  that  are  normally  part  of  routine  clinical  management  or  by 
occurrence of relapses. 
• 
There are numerous treatment alternatives including other monoclonal antibodies in case 
alemtuzumab  shows  reduced  or  diminished  efficacy; 
immune  responses  against 
monoclonal antibodies are normally anti-idiotypic and therefore product-specific, thus not 
expected  to  interfere  with  administration  of  other  monoclonal  antibodies.  If  such  other 
treatments  can  be  given  to  a  patient,  will  have  to  be  decided  on  a  case-by-case  basis 
considering additive immunosuppressive effects. 
• 
Infusion reactions, normally a main concern, are effectively curbed by methylprednisolone 
treatment that is administered to every patient. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The lack of information about the pathogenetic mechanisms as well as clearly elaborated time 
course of events for developing the various thyroid disorders  was initially seen as  an area of 
uncertainty.  While  there  is  still  a  lack  of  full  understanding  of  the  mechanisms,  the  CHMP 
considered  that  the  safety  of  alemtuzumab  can  be  adequately  controlled  in  the  post-
authorisation setting by the risk management strategies, including a post-authorisation safety 
study, and by the regular PSUR reporting. 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 107/116 
 
  
  
The  potential  for  re-activation  of  infections  was  seen  as  another  area  of  uncertainty.  The 
applicant  put  in  place  safety  measures  such  as  prophylactic  medication  (oral  anti-herpes 
agents)  and  laboratory  assessments  after  a  few  cases  of  serious  infections  occurred  in  the 
clinical studies. The CHMP was of the view that the risk of infections is of considerable clinical 
importance and should be one of the key areas for follow-up in the post-authorisation setting. 
The  CHMP  considered  that  this  objective  would  also  be  pursued  in  the  context  of  a  post-
authorisation safety study. 
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  were  no  confirmed  predictive  biomarkers  that  could 
help identifying patients at higher risk of developing an autoimmune condition. Interleukin-21 
was  reported  in  scientific  literature  as  a  potential  predictor  of  autoimmunity  following 
alemtuzumab treatment, which was detectable even before treatment; however, these results 
could  not  reproduced  by  the  applicant.  The  CHMP  recommended  the  applicant  to  further 
investigate  potential  biomarkers  predictive  of  safety  concerns  and  report  back  to  the  CHMP 
within the PSURs. 
One  of  the  safety  concerns  for  this  type  of  disease  modifying  drug,  apart  from  induction  of 
certain  forms  of  autoimmunity,  is  the  potential  risk  of  malignancies.    With  respect  to  thyroid 
cancer,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  primary  focus  should  be  risk  management  strategies 
that focus on thyroid conditions in order to detect any thyroid condition in time, together with 
intensive  physician  and  patient  education.  The  fact  that  all  thyroid  malignancies  observed  in 
alemtuzumab treated patients were found during the diagnostic work-up of recently identified 
underlying  thyroid  conditions  could  suggest  that  the  existing  risk  minimization  measures  for 
thyroid  conditions  are  sufficient  mechanisms  by  which  a  thyroid  malignancy  could  be 
identified. The CHMP also considered that malignancies will be closely monitored in the post-
authorisation study.  
Anti-GBM  disease  is  a  potentially  severe  and  rapidly  developing  condition.  The  long-term 
prognosis  of  patients  affected  by  the  condition  and  treated  is  currently  unknown,  due  to  the 
lack of long-term outcome data. However, although not seen in Lemtrada studies, even small 
permanent  changes  of  serum  creatinine  were  suggested  in  medical  literature  to  negatively 
impact the cardiovascular prognosis. Anti-GBM disease is usually rapidly evolving with patients 
developing terminal renal failure within days if left untreated highlighting the need for a timely 
diagnosis.  The  CHMP  considered  that  monthly  analyses  of  serum  creatinine  and  urine  status 
could  be  used  as  a  basic  screening  tool,  but  acknowledged  the  concern  of  potentially  higher 
rate  of  false  positives,  triggering  unnecessary  diagnostic  procedures,  as  well  as  the  fact  that 
even  monthly  serum  creatinine  measurement  may  not  be  able  to  capture  a  rapidly  evolving 
event.  In  this  context,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  the  most  important  risk  minimisation 
activity is awareness of the patient and any doctor that will see the patient with an acute renal 
failure,  underlining  the  importance  of  the  educational  programme,  including  the  patient  alert 
card, as an additional risk minimisation measure.  
At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  it  was  not  known  whether  there  could  be  an  increased 
incidence of infections, including opportunistic infections, and malignancies after a longer time 
following 
treatment. 
This  was 
considered 
as 
a 
common 
concern 
for 
immunosuppressants/immunomodulators  and  not  necessarily  specific  of  alemtuzumab. 
Nevertheless,  the  long-term  follow-up  data  available  for  a  considerable  number  of  patients 
were considered reassuring by the CHMP.  
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013

The  safety  concern  of  using  alemtuzumab  during  pregnancy  was  considered  as  missing 
information  and  thus  as  an  uncertainty,  particularly  when  seen  in  the  context  of  a  condition 
affecting  women  of  child-bearing  potential.  The  CHMP  considered  that  this  issue  was 
adequately addressed in the risk management plan by setting up a pregnancy registry in order 
to assess adverse pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to alemtuzumab. 
Lemtrada  was  not  administered  for  treatment  of  MS  concomitantly  with  or  following 
antineoplastic  or  immunosuppressive  therapies.  As  with  other  immunomodulating  therapies, 
potential  combined  effects  on  the  patient´s  immune  system  should  be  taken  into  account 
when considering administration of the product. The CHMP considered that concomitant use of 
alemtuzumab with any of these therapies could increase the risk of immunosuppression. This 
was reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The  risks  of  >2  treatment  courses  were  not  fully  established,  but  the  results  suggested  that 
the  safety  profile  did  not  appear  to  change  with  additional  courses.  Overall,  the  CHMP 
concluded that the therapy should be recommended as 2 treatment courses with safety follow-
up  of  patients  from  initiation  of  treatment  and  until  48  months  after  the  last  infusion,  as 
reflected  in  section  4.2  of  the  SmPC.  Furthermore,  if  additional  treatment  courses  are  to  be 
given  they  must  be  administered  at  least  12  months  after  the  prior  course,  as  reflected  in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
An  improved  effect  compared  to  first  line  therapy  on  relapse  rate  and  disability  progression 
can  be  considered  of  importance  in  light  of  the  limited  effects  of  the  current  first  line 
therapies.  In  addition,  the  dosing  schedule  of  alemtuzumab,  i.e.  two  treatment  courses  of 
maximum  5  days  of  drug  administration,  one  year  apart,  compared  to  s.c.  or  i.m.  injections 
once  or  several  times  per  week  could  be  seen  as  more  convenient  and  beneficial  for  an 
individual patient.  
Although  there  are  several  licensed  treatments  for  RRMS,  there  is  still  unmet  medical  need, 
since  the  current  first-line  treatments  (beta-interferons  and  glatiramer  acetate)  are  not 
sufficiently  effective  in  all  patients,  and  further  lines  of  treatments  such  as  fingolimod  or 
natalizumab  are  accompanied  with  significant  safety  issues  that  require  careful  treatment 
decisions by the treating physician. 
On the other hand, clinically significant unfavourable effects were observed, most noteworthy 
the  occurrence  of  autoimmune  diseases  (especially  thyroid  disease  which  occurred  relatively 
frequently). While patients can  be monitored by means of  clinical observation and laboratory 
values, the adverse events can nevertheless be severe and require medical treatment.  
The  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  adverse  events  occurring  with  alemtuzumab  in  the 
indication of multiple sclerosis should be assessed in view of the typical MS patient population, 
i.e.  predominantly  young  and  otherwise  healthy  women  of  child-bearing  potential.  In  this 
context, particularly the occurrence of autoimmune diseases such as thyroid disease (Graves’ 
disease, hypo- and hyperthyroidism), anti-GBM renal disease and ITP were seen as significant. 
Adverse  events  such  as  infusion-related  reactions  can  effectively  be  clinically  managed  with

appropriate pre-medication. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
In  the  clinical  programme,  alemtuzumab  was  seen  to  have  consistent  efficacy  both  in 
previously  untreated  RRMS  patients  and  RRMS  patients  failing  first-line  therapy,  also  across 
various  subgroups  analysed.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  benefits  in  terms  of  effects 
observed  on  the  relapse-  and  disability-related  endpoints  were  clinically  meaningful  and  that 
the efficacy was further supported by relevant MRI-related outcomes. 
As discussed above, the SAG-Neurology was consulted as to whether the safety profile would 
warrant  a  restriction  of  the  indication.  In  general,  the  SAG-Neurology  experts  were  positive 
towards efficacy of alemtuzumab, but highlighted that the safety issues observed and the risk 
management required special attention. The SAG-Neurology experts were split with respect to 
the issue of  restricting the indication versus leaving the decision up to  the treating physician 
and the patient. In either case, however, the SAG-Neurology felt that physicians and doctors 
need to be well-trained and educated about the risks of alemtuzumab treatment.  
This was taken up by the CHMP in their discussion regarding the importance of the physician 
and  patient  education  and  risk  management.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  applicant 
proposed  a  specific  and  pro-active  risk  management  plan  that  was  developed  in  the  clinical 
studies  and  that  builds  on  regular  medical  surveillance  including  monthly  complete  blood 
counts, monthly serum creatinine measurements and monthly urinalysis. A patient alert card 
was  proposed  alongside  the  patient  and  physician  educational  material  in  order  to  inform 
physicians  about  the  adverse  events  that  might  occur  on  treatment  with  alemtuzumab.  This 
was agreed by the CHMP, particularly considering that the physicians diagnosing and treating 
the  complications,  i.e.  endocrinologists,  nephrologists  etc.,  would  not  be  the  same  as  the 
physicians treating the underlying disease, i.e. neurologists.  
The  CHMP  also  acknowledged  that  the  patient  information  material  includes  information  on 
key  symptoms  the  patients  need  to  be  aware  of  in  order  to  allow  for  timely  diagnosis  and 
treatment of potentially serious adverse reactions. 
Based  on  their  evaluation  of  the  benefits  and  risks  of  alemtuzumab  in  the  MS  population,  as 
detailed in the sections above, the CHMP discussed the appropriate indication of alemtuzumab. 
Overall,  it  was  concluded  that  patients  with  inactive  disease  or  stable  on  current  therapy 
should  not  be  treated  with  alemtuzumab.  At  the  same  time,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that 
the treating physicians should have sufficient flexibility to reach more individualized treatment 
decisions  in  patients  showing  activity  as  documented  by  clinical  or  imaging  features,  and 
concluded on the following indication: 
“LEMTRADA  is  indicated  for  adult  patients  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (RRMS) 
with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. (See Section 4.4 and 5.1)” 
The CHMP made the following considerations: 
• 
The reference to “active disease” was considered to ensure that patients being stable on 
treatment,  patients  with  currently  “benign”  course  or  patients  with  low  disease  activity 
are  not  treated.  Furthermore,  the  following  wording  added  to  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC 
Assessment report  
EMA/563018/2013 
Page 110/116 
 
  
  
was  considered  to  add  further  clarity  to  the  prescriber:  “Lemtrada  is  not  recommended 
for patients with inactive disease or stable on current therapy.” 
• 
The  reference  to  “as  defined  by  clinical  or  imaging  features”  was  considered  to  ensure 
that the diagnosis for “activity” is based on commonly used criteria. It was considered to 
refer  to  “or”  instead  of  “and”,  since  a  clinical  presentation  may  already  be  sufficiently 
severe  to  trigger  treatment  (e.g.,  certain  cerebellar  or  pyramidal  symptoms  causing 
severe  disability),  but  also    MRI  evidence  of  continuing  disease  activity  without 
corresponding clinical symptoms could equally qualify, on a case-by-case basis, for active 
treatment. 
• 
• 
The reference to section 4.4 was considered useful to ensure that the treatment decision 
is  made  in  full  awareness  of  the  safety  profile  of  Lemtrada,  thus  addressing  the  safety 
concerns. 
The  reference  to  section  5.1  was  considered  useful  in  raising  awareness  of  the 
prescribers  to  the  inclusion  criteria  of  the  clinical  trials,  thus  strengthening  the 
recommendation for “active” disease only. 
The  CHMP  was  of  the  view  that  this  indication  would  avoid  restricting  alemtuzumab  to  patients 
with  high  disease  activity  only.  Thus,  such  approach  was  seen  as  allowing  for  disease 
modification also for patients, whose disease course is not yet highly active, but is still disabling 
or likely to become highly active or may later result in higher cumulative disability. 
The CHMP concluded that this indication, when read in conjunction with the entire physician and 
patient  documentation,  would  facilitate  a  more  individualised  treatment  decision  for  a  given 
patient by the prescribing specialist neurologist, while at the same time preventing treatment of 
patients with inactive disease (benign course) or those stable on an alternative treatment.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considers  by 
majority decision that the risk-benefit balance of Lemtrada in the treatment of adult patients 
with  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (RRMS)  with  active  disease  defined  by  clinical  or 
imaging  features  is  favourable  and  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing

DIVERGENT POSITIONS 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the 
granting of a Marketing Authorisation for Lemtrada.  
The reasons for divergent positions were as follows: 
It  is  agreed  that  efficacy  of  alemtuzumab  has  been  shown  in  patients  with  relapsing  remitting 
multiple  sclerosis  (RRMS).  However,  there  are  serious  safety  concerns  with  the  use  of  the 
product. 
While  the  benefit/risk in  a  limited  indication  in  patients  with  RRMS  with  high  disease  activity 
defined by clinical and imaging features could be considered positive, the benefit in a population 
with less active disease is considered not to outweigh the risks. 
Therefore the benefit/risk is deemed negative in the broader indication, as proposed by the MAH.

3, 4, and 5) 
To evaluate the anti-PnPs serotype-specific IgG GMCs at 30 days following Dose 4 for 
participants administered a complete dosing schedule of V114 (Group 5) compared with

Study design 
This was a multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind interchangeability 
study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of mixed pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (PCV) regimens in infants approximately 2 months of age. In 2 intervention groups, infants 
received a 4-dose series of either Prevnar 13™ (Group 1) or V114(Group 5). In 3 other intervention 
groups, the immunization series was initiated with Prevnar13™ and changed to V114 at Dose 2, 3 or 
4(Groups 4, 3, and 2, respectively). Infants also received other licensed paediatric vaccines 
administered concomitantly with the PCV, including RECOMBIVAXHB™ and RotaTeq™. 
Study population /Sample size 
The planned enrolment total was 900 participants. As no hypothesis testing was planned the study size 
is intended for descriptive data.  
Eligible participants were healthy male or female infants approximately 2 months of age (42 to 90 
days, inclusive) without a history of invasive pneumococcal disease or prior administration of any 
pneumococcal vaccine. 
Treatments 
All participants received Rotateq concomitantly with study and comparator vaccines. The study 
participants were randomized to the following groups:

•  Solicited injection-site AEs from Day 1 through Day 14 postvaccination 
•  Solicited systemic AEs from Day 1 through Day 14 postvaccination 
•  Vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) through completion of study participation

13™ at 30 days postdose 4 (PD4) 
Secondary endpoints:

13™at 30 days PD4 
CHMP comment: This report will focus on endpoints relevant to Rotateq.  
Statistical Methods 
The primary immunogenicity objective was descriptive without formal hypothesis testing. The 
serotype-specific IgG GMCs for 13 shared serotypes contained in V114 and Prevnar 13™ at 30 days 
PD4 were compared between groups through the estimation of serotype-specific IgG GMC ratios for 
each serotype. Estimation of the IgG GMC ratios and computation of the corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with 
vaccination group and stratification factor (hepatitis B vaccination status before enrolment = Yes, No) 
as covariates. The pairwise comparisons included Group 2 vs Group 1; Group 3 vs Group 1; and Group 
4 vs Group 1.For the secondary objective of the noninferiority evaluation of immunogenicity of 
RECOMBIVAX HB™ when given concomitantly with V114 or Prevnar 13™, the proportions of participants 
with anti-HBsAg concentration ≥10 mIU/mL at 30 days PD3 of V114 or Prevnar 13™ were compared 
between groups. The between-treatment difference based on the proportions of participants with anti-

HBsAg concentration ≥10 mIU/mL [V114 (Group 5) minus Prevnar 13™ (Group 1 + Group 2)] and its 
95% CI were calculated using stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method. For the secondary objective 
of the noninferiority evaluation of immunogenicity of RotaTeq™ when given concomitantly with V114 or 
Prevnar 13™, the anti-rotavirus IgA GMT at 30 days PD3 of V114 or Prevnar 13™ was compared 
between groups through the estimation of anti-rotavirus IgAGMT ratios. Estimation of the anti-
rotavirus IgA GMT ratio [V114 (Group 5)/Prevnar 13™ (Group 1 + Group 2)] and the corresponding 
95% CIs were calculated using ANCOVA with vaccination group and stratification factor (hepatitis B 
vaccination status before enrolment = Yes, No) as covariates. Safety and tolerability were assessed by 
clinical review of all relevant parameters including AEs and postvaccination temperature 
measurements. P-values (Tier 1 endpoints) and 95% CIs (Tier 1 and Tier 2 endpoints) were provided 
for between-vaccination group differences in the percentage of participants with prespecified events.

Anti-rotavirus IgA Response at 30 Days Postdose 3 
Following 3 doses of either V114 (Group 5) or Prevnar 13™ (Groups 1 and 2)in the infant primary 
series, RotaTeq™ administered concomitantly with V114elicited an immune response that was 
generally comparable to that elicited by RotaTeq™ administered concomitantly with Prevnar 13™. 
•  Responses to RotaTeq™ administered concomitantly with V114 met noninferiority criteria as 
assessed by anti-rotavirus IgA GMTs at 30 days PD3.The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of

the anti-rotavirus IgA GMT ratio (Group5/[Group 1 + Group 2]) was greater than 0.50 (Table

covariates. 
b A conclusion of non-inferiority of RotaTeq™ administered concomitantly with V114 to RotaTeq™ administered 
concomitantly with Prevnar 13™ is based on the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMT ratio (Group 
5/Group 1+Group 2) being >0.5 (1-sided p-value <0.025). 
Safety results 
•  When administered concomitantly with RECOMBIVAX HB™ and RotaTeq™, complete V114 and 
mixed Prevnar 13™ and V114 dosing regimens were generally well-tolerated with safety 
profiles generally comparable to a complete dosing regimen of Prevnar 13™. 
•  When an investigator assessed a systemic AE as related to PCV, it was usually assessed as 
related to all concomitantly administered vaccines. 
• 
The proportions of participants with systemic AEs related to PCV, RECOMBIVAX HB™, or 
RotaTeq™ were generally comparable across intervention groups and in general, the vaccine-
related systemic AEs for the concomitant vaccines were consistent with those reported for PCV. 
•  No new safety issues for RECOMBIVAX HB™ or RotaTeq™ were identified. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The immune responses in terms of IgA against Rotateq when administered together with the 
investigational vaccine compared administration together with Prevenar 13. No concern regarding 
immunogenicity of RotaTeq was raised based on this study. Likewise, no new safety signal for RotaTeq 
was raised in this study. Immune responses to other antigens are not assessed within this procedure. 
Thus, further regulatory action concerning RotaTeq is not considered necessary based on these results.  
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

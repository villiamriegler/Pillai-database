4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Nexium Control is indicated for the short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (e.g. heartburn and acid 
regurgitation) in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 20 mg esomeprazole (one tablet) per day. 
It might be necessary to take the tablets for 2-3 consecutive days to achieve improvement of 
symptoms. The duration of treatment is up to 2 weeks. Once complete relief of symptoms has 
occurred, treatment should be discontinued. 
If no symptom relief is obtained within 2 weeks of continuous treatment, the patient should be 
instructed to consult a doctor. 
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is not required in patients with impaired renal function. Due to limited experience in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency, such patients should be treated with caution (see section 5.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild to moderate liver impairment. However, patients 
with severe liver impairment should be advised by a doctor before taking Nexium Control (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Elderly patients (≥65 years old) 
Dose adjustment is not required in elderly patients.

Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Nexium Control in the paediatric population below 18 years of age for the 
indication of “short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (e.g., heartburn and acid regurgitation)”. 
Method of administration  
The tablets should be swallowed whole with half a glass of water. The tablets must not be chewed or 
crushed. 
Alternatively, the tablet can be dispersed in half a glass of non-carbonated water. No other liquids 
should be used as the enteric coating may be dissolved. The water should be stirred until the tablet 
disintegrates. The liquid with the pellets should be drunk immediately or within 30 minutes. The glass 
should be rinsed with half a glass of water and the water drunk. The pellets should not be chewed or 
crushed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, substituted benzimidazoles or to any of the excipients listed 
in section 6.1. 
Esomeprazole must not be used concomitantly with nelfinavir (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Patients should be instructed to consult a doctor if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
They have significant unintentional weight loss, recurrent vomiting, dysphagia, haematemesis 
or melaena and when gastric ulcer is suspected or present, malignancy should be excluded as 
treatment with esomeprazole may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis. 
They have had previous gastric ulcer or gastrointestinal surgery. 
They have been on continuous symptomatic treatment of indigestion or heartburn for 4 or more 
weeks. 
They have jaundice or severe liver disease. 
They are aged over 55 years with new or recently changed symptoms. 
Patients with long-term recurrent symptoms of indigestion or heartburn should see their doctor at 
regular intervals. Patients over 55 years taking any non-prescription indigestion or heartburn remedy 
on a daily basis should inform their pharmacist or doctor. 
Patients should not take Nexium Control as a long term preventive medicinal product. 
Treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may lead to a slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal 
infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter and in hospitalised patients, also possibly 
Clostridium difficile (see section 5.1). 
Patients should consult their doctor before taking this medicinal product if they are due to have an 
endoscopy or urea breath test. 
Combination with other medicinal products 
Co-administration of esomeprazole with atazanavir is not recommended (see section 4.5). If the 
combination of atazanavir with a PPI is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended 
in combination with an increase in the dose of atazanavir to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir. 
Esomeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Esomeprazole is a CYP2C19 inhibitor. When starting or ending treatment with esomeprazole, the 
potential for interactions with medicinal products metabolised through CYP2C19 should be 
considered. An interaction is observed between clopidogrel and esomeprazole. The clinical relevance 
of this interaction is uncertain. The use of esomeprazole with clopidogrel should be discouraged (see 
section 4.5). 
Patients should not take another PPI or H2 antagonist concomitantly. 
Interference with laboratory tests 
Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. 
To avoid this interference, Nexium Control treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA 
measurements (see section 5.1). If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after 
initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump 
inhibitor treatment. 
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) 
Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially 
in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical 
help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Nexium Control. SCLE after 
previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton 
pump inhibitors. 
Sucrose 
This medicinal product contains sugar spheres (sucrose). Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not 
take this medicinal product. 
Sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium free’.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Effects of esomeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
As esomeprazole is one enantiomer of omeprazole it is reasonable to advise about interactions 
reported with omeprazole. 
Protease inhibitors 
Omeprazole has been reported to interact with some protease inhibitors. The clinical importance and 
the mechanisms behind these reported interactions are not always known. Increased gastric pH during 
omeprazole treatment may change the absorption of the protease inhibitors. Other possible interaction 
mechanisms are via inhibition of CYP2C19.  
For atazanavir and nelfinavir, decreased serum levels have been reported when given together with 
omeprazole and concomitant administration is not recommended. Co-administration of omeprazole 
(40 mg once daily) with atazanavir 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg to healthy volunteers resulted in a 
substantial reduction in atazanavir exposure (approximately 75% decrease in AUC, Cmax and Cmin). 
Increasing the atazanavir dose to 400 mg did not compensate for the impact of omeprazole on 
atazanavir exposure. The co-administration of omeprazole (20 mg once a day) with atazanavir 
400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg to healthy volunteers resulted in a decrease of approximately 30% in the 
atazanavir exposure as compared with the exposure observed with atazanavir 300 mg/ritonavir 
100 mg once a day without omeprazole 20 mg once a day. Co-administration of omeprazole 
(40 mg once a day) reduced mean nelfinavir AUC, Cmax and Cmin by 36–39 % and mean AUC, Cmax 
and Cmin for the pharmacologically active metabolite M8 was reduced by 75-92%. Due to the similar 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacodynamic effects and pharmacokinetic properties of omeprazole and esomeprazole, 
concomitant administration with esomeprazole and atazanavir is not recommended and concomitant 
administration with esomeprazole and nelfinavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3 and 4.4). 
For saquinavir (with concomitant ritonavir), increased serum levels (80-100%) have been reported 
during concomitant omeprazole treatment (40 mg once a day). Treatment with omeprazole 20 mg once 
a day had no effect on the exposure of darunavir (with concomitant ritonavir) and amprenavir (with 
concomitant ritonavir).  
Treatment with esomeprazole 20 mg once a day had no effect on the exposure of amprenavir (with and 
without concomitant ritonavir). Treatment with omeprazole 40 mg once a day had no effect on the 
exposure of lopinavir (with concomitant ritonavir).  
Methotrexate 
When given together with PPIs, methotrexate levels have been reported to increase in some patients. 
In high-dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of esomeprazole may need to be 
considered. 
Tacrolimus 
Concomitant administration of esomeprazole has been reported to increase the serum levels of 
tacrolimus. A reinforced monitoring of tacrolimus concentrations as well as renal function (creatinine 
clearance) should be performed, and the dose of tacrolimus adjusted if needed. 
Medicinal products with pH dependent absorption 
Gastric acid suppression during treatment with esomeprazole and other PPIs might decrease or 
increase the absorption of medicinal products with a gastric pH dependent absorption. The absorption 
of medicinal products taken orally such as ketoconazole, itraconazole and erlotinib can decrease 
during treatment with esomeprazole and the absorption of digoxin can increase during treatment with 
esomeprazole.  
Concomitant treatment with omeprazole (20 mg daily) and digoxin in healthy subjects increased the 
bioavailability of digoxin by 10% (up to 30% in two out of ten subjects). Digoxin toxicity has been 
rarely reported. However, caution should be exercised when esomeprazole is given at high doses in 
elderly patients. Therapeutic monitoring of digoxin should then be reinforced. 
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 
Esomeprazole inhibits CYP2C19, the major esomeprazole metabolising enzyme. Thus, when 
esomeprazole is combined with medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19, such as warfarin, 
phenytoin, citalopram, imipramine, clomipramine, diazepam, etc., the plasma concentrations of these 
medicinal products may be increased and a dose reduction could be needed. In case of clopidogrel, a 
prodrug which is transformed into its active metabolite via CYP2C19, the plasma concentrations of 
the active metabolite may be decreased. 
Warfarin 
Concomitant administration of 40 mg esomeprazole to warfarin-treated patients in a clinical study 
showed that coagulation times were within the accepted range. However, post-marketing, a few 
isolated cases of elevated INR of clinical significance have been reported during concomitant 
treatment. Monitoring is recommended when initiating and ending concomitant esomeprazole 
treatment during treatment with warfarin or other coumarine derivatives. 
Clopidogrel 
Results from studies in healthy subjects have shown a pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) 
interaction between clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose/75 mg daily maintenance dose) and 
esomeprazole (40 mg orally daily) resulting in decreased exposure to the active metabolite of 
clopidogrel by an average of 40%, and resulting in decreased maximum inhibition of (ADP induced) 
platelet aggregation by an average of 14%. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
In a study in healthy subjects, there was a decreased exposure by almost 40% of the active metabolite 
of clopidogrel when a fixed dose combination of esomeprazole 20 mg + acetylsalicylic acid 81 mg 
was given with clopidogrel compared to clopidogrel alone. However, the maximum levels of 
inhibition of (ADP induced) platelet aggregation in these subjects were the same in both groups. 
Inconsistent data on the clinical implications of this PK/PD interaction in terms of major 
cardiovascular events have been reported from both observational and clinical studies. As a 
precaution, concomitant use of esomeprazole and clopidogrel should be discouraged. 
Phenytoin 
Concomitant administration of 40 mg esomeprazole resulted in a 13% increase in trough plasma levels 
of phenytoin in epileptic patients. It is recommended to monitor the plasma concentrations of 
phenytoin when treatment with esomeprazole is introduced or withdrawn.  
Voriconazole 
Omeprazole (40 mg once daily) increased voriconazole (a CYP2C19 substrate) Cmax and AUCτ by 
15% and 41%, respectively. 
Cilostazol 
Omeprazole as well as esomeprazole act as inhibitors of CYP2C19. Omeprazole, given in doses of 
40 mg to healthy subjects in a cross-over study, increased Cmax and AUC for cilostazol by 18% and 
26% respectively, and one of its active metabolites by 29% and 69% respectively. 
Cisapride 
In healthy volunteers, concomitant administration of 40 mg esomeprazole resulted in a 32% increase 
in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and a 31% prolongation of elimination 
half-life(t1/2) but no significant increase in peak plasma levels of cisapride. The slightly prolonged QTc 
interval observed after administration of cisapride alone, was not further prolonged when cisapride 
was given in combination with esomeprazole. 
Diazepam 
Concomitant administration of 30 mg esomeprazole resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of the 
CYP2C19 substrate diazepam. 
Investigated medicinal products with no clinically relevant interaction 
Amoxicillin and quinidine 
Esomeprazole has been shown to have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of 
amoxicillin and quinidine.  
Naproxen or rofecoxib 
Studies evaluating concomitant administration of esomeprazole and either naproxen or rofecoxib did 
not identify any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions during short-term studies. 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole 
Medicinal products which inhibit CYP2C19 and/or CYP3A4 
Esomeprazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of 
esomeprazole and a CYP3A4 inhibitor, clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day (b.i.d.)), resulted in a 
doubling of the exposure (AUC) to esomeprazole. Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and a 
combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP 3A4 may result in more than doubling of the esomeprazole 
exposure. The CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor voriconazole increased omeprazole AUCt by 280%. 
A dose adjustment of esomeprazole is not regularly required in either of these situations. However, 
dose adjustment should be considered in patients with severe hepatic impairment and if long-term 
treatment is indicated.

Medicinal products which induce CYP2C19 and/or CYP3A4 
Medicinal products known to induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 or both (such as rifampicin and St. John’s 
wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may lead to decreased esomeprazole serum levels by increasing the 
esomeprazole metabolism. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformative or feto/ neonatal toxicity of esomeprazole. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3).  
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Nexium Control during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether esomeprazole/metabolites are excreted in human milk. There is insufficient 
information on the effects of esomeprazole in newborns/infants. Esomeprazole should not be used 
during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies with the racemic mixture omeprazole, given by oral administration do not indicate 
effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Esomeprazole has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Adverse reactions such as 
dizziness and visual disturbances are uncommon (see section 4.8). If affected, patients should not 
drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea are among those adverse reactions that have been 
most commonly reported in clinical studies (and also from post-marketing use). In addition, the safety 
profile is similar for different formulations, treatment indications, age groups and patient populations. 
No dose-related adverse reactions have been identified. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been identified or suspected in the clinical studies programme 
for esomeprazole and post-marketing. The reactions are classified according to MedDRA frequency 
convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is very limited experience to date with deliberate overdose. The symptoms described in 
connection with 280 mg esomeprazole were gastrointestinal symptoms and weakness. Single doses of 
80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful. No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively 
plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialysable. Treatment should be symptomatic and 
general supportive measures should be utilised. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for acid related disorders, proton pump inhibitors, 
ATC code: A02BC05. 
Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole and reduces gastric acid secretion through a specific 
targeted mechanism of action. It is a specific inhibitor of the acid pump in the parietal cell. Both the R- 
and S-isomer of omeprazole have similar pharmacodynamic activity. 
Mechanism of action 
Esomeprazole is a weak base and is concentrated and converted to the active form in the highly acidic 
environment of the secretory canaliculi of the parietal cell, where it inhibits the enzyme H+K+-ATPase 
(the acid pump) and inhibits both basal and stimulated acid secretion. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
After oral dosing with esomeprazole 20 mg and 40 mg the onset of effect occurs within one hour. 
After repeated administration with 20 mg esomeprazole once daily for five days, mean peak acid 
output after pentagastrin stimulation is decreased 90% when measured 6-7 hours after dosing on day 
five. 
After five days of oral dosing with 20 mg and 40 mg of esomeprazole, intragastric pH above 4 was 
maintained for a mean time of 13 hours and 17 hours, respectively over 24 hours in symptomatic 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients. The proportion of patients maintaining an 
intragastric pH above 4 for at least 8, 12 and 16 hours respectively were for esomeprazole 20 mg 76%, 
54% and 24%. Corresponding proportions for esomeprazole 40 mg were 97%, 92% and 56%. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using AUC as a surrogate parameter for plasma concentration, a relationship between inhibition of 
acid secretion and exposure has been shown. 
During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products, serum gastrin increases in response to the 
decreased acid secretion. Also CgA increases due to decreased gastric acidity. The increased CgA 
level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. 
Available published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be discontinued between  
5 days and 2 weeks prior to CgA measurements. This is to allow CgA levels that might be spuriously 
elevated following PPI treatment to return to reference range. 
An increased number of ECL cells possibly related to the increased serum gastrin levels, have been 
observed in some patients during long-term treatment with esomeprazole. 
Decreased gastric acidity due to any means including PPIs, increases gastric counts of bacteria 
normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with PPIs may lead to slightly increased risk 
of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter and in hospitalised patients, also 
possibly Clostridium difficile. 
Clinical efficacy 
Esomeprazole 20 mg has been demonstrated to effectively treat frequent heartburn in subjects 
receiving one dose per 24 hours over 2 weeks. In two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled pivotal studies 234 subjects with a recent history of frequent heartburn were treated 
with 20 mg esomeprazole for 4 weeks. Symptoms associated with acid reflux (such as heartburn and 
acid regurgitation) were evaluated retrospectively over a 24 hour period. In both studies esomeprazole 
20 mg was significantly better compared to placebo for the primary endpoint, complete resolution of 
heartburn, defined as no heartburn episodes during the last 7 days prior to the final visit  
(33.9% - 41.6% vs. placebo 11.9 – 13.7%, (p<0.001). The secondary endpoint of complete resolution 
of heartburn, defined as no heartburn on the patient’s diary card for 7 consecutive days, was 
statistically significant at both week 1 (10.0% - 15.2% vs placebo 0.9% - 2.4%, p = 0.014, p<0.001) 
and week 2 (25.2% - 35.7% vs placebo 3.4% - 9.0%, p<0.001).  
Other secondary endpoints were supportive of the primary endpoint, including relief of heartburn at 
week 1 and week 2, percentage of 24 hour days without heartburn at week 1 and week 2, mean 
heartburn severity at week 1 and week 2, and time to initial and sustained resolution of heartburn over 
a 24 hour period and during the night compared to placebo. Approximately 78% of the subjects on  
20 mg esomeprazole reported first resolution of heartburn within the first week of treatment compared 
to 52 – 58% for placebo. Time to sustained resolution of heartburn, defined as when 7 consecutive 
days of no heartburn was first recorded, was significantly shorter in the esomeprazole 20 mg group 
(39.7% - 48.7% by day 14 vs placebo 11.0% - 20.2%). The median time to first resolution of 
night-time heartburn was 1 day, statistically significant compared to placebo in one study (p=0.048) 
and approaching significance in the other (p=0.069). About 80% of nights were heartburn free during 
all time periods and 90% of nights were heartburn free by week 2 of each clinical study, compared to 
72.4 – 78.3% for placebo. The investigators’ assessments of heartburn resolution were consistent with 
the subjects’ assessments, showing statistically significant differences between esomeprazole  
(34.7% - 41.8%) compared to placebo (8.0% - 11.4%). The investigators also found esomeprazole to 
be significantly more effective than placebo in resolving acid regurgitation (58.5% - 63.6% vs placebo 
28.3% - 37.4%) during the week 2 evaluation.  
Following Overall Treatment Evaluation (OTE) of patients at week 2, 78.0-80.7% of patients on 
esomeprazole 20 mg, compared to 72.4 – 78.3% for placebo, reported their condition as improved. 
The majority of these rated the importance of this change to be Important to Extremely Important in 
performing their activities of daily living (79 - 86% at week 2).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Esomeprazole is acid labile and is administered orally as enteric-coated granules. In vivo conversion to 
the R-isomer is negligible. Absorption of esomeprazole is rapid, with peak plasma levels occurring 
approximately 1-2 hours after dose. The absolute bioavailability is 64% after a single dose of 40 mg 
and increases to 89% after repeated once-daily administration. For 20 mg esomeprazole the 
corresponding values are 50% and 68% respectively. Food intake both delays and decreases the 
absorption of esomeprazole although this has no significant influence on the effect of esomeprazole on 
intragastric acidity. 
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy subjects is approximately 0.22 l/kg body 
weight. Esomeprazole is 97% plasma protein bound. 
Biotransformation  
Esomeprazole is completely metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system (CYP). The major part of 
the metabolism of esomeprazole is dependent on the polymorphic CYP2C19, responsible for the 
formation of the hydroxy- and desmethyl metabolites of esomeprazole. The remaining part is 
dependent on another specific isoform, CYP3A4, responsible for the formation of esomeprazole 
sulphone, the main metabolite in plasma. 
Elimination 
The parameters below reflect mainly the pharmacokinetics in individuals with a functional CYP2C19 
enzyme, extensive metabolisers.  
Total plasma clearance is about 17 l/h after a single dose and about 9 l/h after repeated administration. 
The plasma elimination half-life is about 1.3 hours after repeated once-daily dosing. Esomeprazole is 
completely eliminated from plasma between doses with no tendency for accumulation during 
once-daily administration. The major metabolites of esomeprazole have no effect on gastric acid 
secretion. Almost 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as metabolites in the urine, the 
remainder in the faeces. Less than 1% of the parent compound is found in urine. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole has been studied in doses up to 40 mg b.i.d. The area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve increases with repeated administration of esomeprazole. This 
increase is dose-dependent and results in a more than dose proportional increase in AUC after repeated 
administration. This time and dose-dependency is due to a decrease of first pass metabolism and 
systemic clearance probably caused by an inhibition of the CYP2C19 enzyme by esomeprazole and/or 
its sulphone metabolite.  
Special patient populations 
Poor metabolisers 
Approximately 2.9±1.5% of the population lack a functional CYP2C19 enzyme and are called poor 
metabolisers. In these individuals the metabolism of esomeprazole is probably mainly catalysed by 
CYP3A4. After repeated once-daily administration of 40 mg esomeprazole, the mean area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve was approximately 100% higher in poor metabolisers than in subjects 
having a functional CYP2C19 enzyme (extensive metabolisers). Mean peak plasma concentrations 
were 60% higher. 
These findings have no implications for the posology of esomeprazole. 
Gender 
Following a single dose of 40 mg esomeprazole the mean are under the plasma concentration-time 
curve is approximately 30% higher in females than in males. No gender difference is seen after 
repeated once-daily administration. These findings have no implications for the posology of 
esomeprazole. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
The metabolism of esomeprazole in patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction may be impaired. 
The metabolic rate is decreased in patients with severe liver dysfunction resulting in a doubling of the 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve of esomeprazole. Therefore, a maximum of 20 mg 
should not be exceeded in patients with severe dysfunction. Esomeprazole or its major metabolites do 
not show any tendency to accumulate with once-daily dosing. 
Renal impairment 
No studies have been performed in patients with decreased renal function. Since the kidney is 
responsible for the excretion of the metabolites of esomeprazole but not for the elimination of the 
parent compound, the metabolism of esomeprazole is not expected to be changed in patients with 
impaired renal function. 
Elderly patients (≥65 years old) 
The metabolism of esomeprazole is not significantly changed in elderly patients (71-80 years of age). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no particular hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development.  
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
Carcinogenicity studies in the rat with the racemic mixture have shown gastric ECL-cell hyperplasia 
and carcinoids. These gastric effects in the rat are the result of sustained, pronounced 
hypergastrinaemia secondary to reduced production of gastric acid and are observed after long-term 
treatment in the rat with inhibitors of gastric acid secretion.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Nexium Control is indicated for the short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (e.g. heartburn and acid 
regurgitation) in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is 20 mg esomeprazole (one capsule) per day. 
It might be necessary to take the capsules for 2-3 consecutive days to achieve improvement of 
symptoms. The duration of treatment is up to 2 weeks. Once complete relief of symptoms has 
occurred, treatment should be discontinued. 
If no symptom relief is obtained within 2 weeks of continuous treatment, the patient should be 
instructed to consult a doctor. 
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
Dose adjustment is not required in patients with impaired renal function. Due to limited experience in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency, such patients should be treated with caution (see section 5.2). 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild to moderate liver impairment. However, patients 
with severe liver impairment should be advised by a doctor before taking Nexium Control (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Elderly patients (≥65 years old) 
Dose adjustment is not required in elderly patients.

Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Nexium Control in the paediatric population below 18 years of age for the 
indication of “short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (e.g., heartburn and acid regurgitation)”. 
Method of administration  
The capsules should be swallowed whole with half a glass of water. The capsules must not be chewed, 
crushed or opened. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance, substituted benzimidazoles or to any of the excipients listed 
in section 6.1. 
Esomeprazole must not be used concomitantly with nelfinavir (see section 4.5). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
General 
Patients should be instructed to consult a doctor if: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
They have significant unintentional weight loss, recurrent vomiting, dysphagia, haematemesis 
or melaena and when gastric ulcer is suspected or present, malignancy should be excluded as 
treatment with esomeprazole may alleviate symptoms and delay diagnosis. 
They have had previous gastric ulcer or gastrointestinal surgery. 
They have been on continuous symptomatic treatment of indigestion or heartburn for 4 or more 
weeks. 
They have jaundice or severe liver disease. 
They are aged over 55 years with new or recently changed symptoms. 
Patients with long-term recurrent symptoms of indigestion or heartburn should see their doctor at 
regular intervals. Patients over 55 years taking any non-prescription indigestion or heartburn remedy 
on a daily basis should inform their pharmacist or doctor. 
Patients should not take Nexium Control as a long term preventive medicinal product. 
Treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may lead to a slightly increased risk of gastrointestinal 
infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter and in hospitalised patients, also possibly 
Clostridium difficile (see section 5.1). 
Patients should consult their doctor before taking this medicinal product if they are due to have an 
endoscopy or urea breath test. 
Combination with other medicinal products 
Co-administration of esomeprazole with atazanavir is not recommended (see section 4.5). If the 
combination of atazanavir with a PPI is judged unavoidable, close clinical monitoring is recommended 
in combination with an increase in the dose of atazanavir to 400 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir. 
Esomeprazole 20 mg should not be exceeded. 
Esomeprazole is a CYP2C19 inhibitor. When starting or ending treatment with esomeprazole, the 
potential for interactions with medicinal products metabolised through CYP2C19 should be 
considered. An interaction is observed between clopidogrel and esomeprazole. The clinical relevance 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of this interaction is uncertain. The use of esomeprazole with clopidogrel should be discouraged (see 
section 4.5). 
Patients should not take another PPI or H2 antagonist concomitantly. 
Interference with laboratory tests 
Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. 
To avoid this interference, Nexium Control treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA 
measurements (see section 5.1). If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after 
initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump 
inhibitor treatment. 
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) 
Proton pump inhibitors are associated with very infrequent cases of SCLE. If lesions occur, especially 
in sun-exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanied by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical 
help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping Nexium Control. SCLE after 
previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton 
pump inhibitors. 
Sucrose 
This medicinal product contains sugar spheres (sucrose). Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not 
take this medicinal product. 
Sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium free’.  
Allura red AC (E129) 
This medicinal product contains azo colouring agent, Allura red AC (E129), which may cause allergic 
reactions.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Effects of esomeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
As esomeprazole is one enantiomer of omeprazole it is reasonable to advise about interactions 
reported with omeprazole. 
Protease inhibitors 
Omeprazole has been reported to interact with some protease inhibitors. The clinical importance and 
the mechanisms behind these reported interactions are not always known. Increased gastric pH during 
omeprazole treatment may change the absorption of the protease inhibitors. Other possible interaction 
mechanisms are via inhibition of CYP2C19.  
For atazanavir and nelfinavir, decreased serum levels have been reported when given together with 
omeprazole and concomitant administration is not recommended. Co-administration of omeprazole 
(40 mg once daily) with atazanavir 300 mg/ritonavir 100 mg to healthy volunteers resulted in a 
substantial reduction in atazanavir exposure (approximately 75% decrease in AUC, Cmax, and Cmin). 
Increasing the atazanavir dose to 400 mg did not compensate for the impact of omeprazole on 
atazanavir exposure. The co-administration of omeprazole (20 mg once a day) with atazanavir 
400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg to healthy volunteers resulted in a decrease of approximately 30% in the 
atazanavir exposure as compared with the exposure observed with atazanavir 300 mg/ritonavir 
100 mg once a day without omeprazole 20 mg once a day. Co-administration of omeprazole 
(40 mg once a day) reduced mean nelfinavir AUC, Cmax, and Cmin by 36 - 39 % and mean AUC, Cmax, 
and Cmin for the pharmacologically active metabolite M8 was reduced by 75 - 92%. Due to the similar 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pharmacodynamic effects and pharmacokinetic properties of omeprazole and esomeprazole, 
concomitant administration with esomeprazole and atazanavir is not recommended and concomitant 
administration with esomeprazole and nelfinavir is contraindicated (see section 4.3 and 4.4). 
For saquinavir (with concomitant ritonavir), increased serum levels (80-100%) have been reported 
during concomitant omeprazole treatment (40 mg once a day). Treatment with omeprazole 20 mg once 
a day had no effect on the exposure of darunavir (with concomitant ritonavir) and amprenavir (with 
concomitant ritonavir).  
Treatment with esomeprazole 20 mg once a day had no effect on the exposure of amprenavir (with and 
without concomitant ritonavir). Treatment with omeprazole 40 mg once a day had no effect on the 
exposure of lopinavir (with concomitant ritonavir).  
Methotrexate 
When given together with PPIs, methotrexate levels have been reported to increase in some patients. 
In high-dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of esomeprazole may need to be 
considered. 
Tacrolimus 
Concomitant administration of esomeprazole has been reported to increase the serum levels of 
tacrolimus. A reinforced monitoring of tacrolimus concentrations as well as renal function (creatinine 
clearance) should be performed, and the dose of tacrolimus adjusted if needed. 
Medicinal products with pH dependent absorption 
Gastric acid suppression during treatment with esomeprazole and other PPIs might decrease or 
increase the absorption of medicinal products with a gastric pH dependent absorption. The absorption 
of medicinal products taken orally such as ketoconazole, itraconazole and erlotinib can decrease 
during treatment with esomeprazole and the absorption of digoxin can increase during treatment with 
esomeprazole.  
Concomitant treatment with omeprazole (20 mg daily) and digoxin in healthy subjects increased the 
bioavailability of digoxin by 10% (up to 30% in two out of ten subjects). Digoxin toxicity has been 
rarely reported. However, caution should be exercised when esomeprazole is given at high doses in 
elderly patients. Therapeutic monitoring of digoxin should then be reinforced. 
Medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 
Esomeprazole inhibits CYP2C19, the major esomeprazole metabolising enzyme. Thus, when 
esomeprazole is combined with medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19, such as warfarin, 
phenytoin, citalopram, imipramine, clomipramine, diazepam, etc., the plasma concentrations of these 
medicinal products may be increased and a dose reduction could be needed. In case of clopidogrel, a 
prodrug which is transformed into its active metabolite via CYP2C19, the plasma concentrations of 
the active metabolite may be decreased. 
Warfarin 
Concomitant administration of 40 mg esomeprazole to warfarin-treated patients in a clinical study 
showed that coagulation times were within the accepted range. However, post-marketing, a few 
isolated cases of elevated INR of clinical significance have been reported during concomitant 
treatment. Monitoring is recommended when initiating and ending concomitant esomeprazole 
treatment during treatment with warfarin or other coumarine derivatives. 
Clopidogrel 
Results from studies in healthy subjects have shown a pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) 
interaction between clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose/75 mg daily maintenance dose) and 
esomeprazole (40 mg orally daily) resulting in decreased exposure to the active metabolite of 
clopidogrel by an average of 40%, and resulting in decreased maximum inhibition of (ADP induced) 
platelet aggregation by an average of 14%. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
In a study in healthy subjects, there was a decreased exposure by almost 40% of the active metabolite 
of clopidogrel when a fixed dose combination of esomeprazole 20 mg + acetylsalicylic acid 81 mg 
was given with clopidogrel compared to clopidogrel alone. However, the maximum levels of 
inhibition of (ADP induced) platelet aggregation in these subjects were the same in both groups. 
Inconsistent data on the clinical implications of this PK/PD interaction in terms of major 
cardiovascular events have been reported from both observational and clinical studies. As a 
precaution, concomitant use of esomeprazole and clopidogrel should be discouraged. 
Phenytoin 
Concomitant administration of 40 mg esomeprazole resulted in a 13% increase in trough plasma levels 
of phenytoin in epileptic patients. It is recommended to monitor the plasma concentrations of 
phenytoin when treatment with esomeprazole is introduced or withdrawn.  
Voriconazole 
Omeprazole (40 mg once daily) increased voriconazole (a CYP2C19 substrate) Cmax and AUCτ by 
15% and 41%, respectively. 
Cilostazol 
Omeprazole as well as esomeprazole act as inhibitors of CYP2C19. Omeprazole, given in doses of 
40 mg to healthy subjects in a cross-over study, increased Cmax and AUC for cilostazol by 18% and 
26% respectively, and one of its active metabolites by 29% and 69% respectively. 
Cisapride 
In healthy volunteers, concomitant administration of 40 mg esomeprazole resulted in a 32% increase 
in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and a 31% prolongation of elimination 
half-life(t1/2) but no significant increase in peak plasma levels of cisapride. The slightly prolonged QTc 
interval observed after administration of cisapride alone, was not further prolonged when cisapride 
was given in combination with esomeprazole. 
Diazepam 
Concomitant administration of 30 mg esomeprazole resulted in a 45% decrease in clearance of the 
CYP2C19 substrate diazepam. 
Investigated medicinal products with no clinically relevant interaction 
Amoxicillin and quinidine 
Esomeprazole has been shown to have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of 
amoxicillin and quinidine.  
Naproxen or rofecoxib 
Studies evaluating concomitant administration of esomeprazole and either naproxen or rofecoxib did 
not identify any clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions during short-term studies. 
Effects of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole 
Medicinal products which inhibit CYP2C19 and/or CYP3A4 
Esomeprazole is metabolised by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of 
esomeprazole and a CYP3A4 inhibitor, clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day (b.i.d.)), resulted in a 
doubling of the exposure (AUC) to esomeprazole. Concomitant administration of esomeprazole and a 
combined inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 may result in more than doubling of the esomeprazole 
exposure. The CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitor voriconazole increased omeprazole AUCt by 280%. 
A dose adjustment of esomeprazole is not regularly required in either of these situations. However, 
dose adjustment should be considered in patients with severe hepatic impairment and if long-term 
treatment is indicated. 
Medicinal products which induce CYP2C19 and/or CYP3A4 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicinal products known to induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 or both (such as rifampicin and St. John’s 
wort (Hypericum perforatum)) may lead to decreased esomeprazole serum levels by increasing the 
esomeprazole metabolism. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformative or feto/ neonatal toxicity of esomeprazole. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3).  
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Nexium Control during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether esomeprazole/metabolites are excreted in human milk. There is insufficient 
information on the effects of esomeprazole in newborns/infants. Esomeprazole should not be used 
during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Animal studies with the racemic mixture omeprazole, given by oral administration do not indicate 
effects with respect to fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Esomeprazole has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Adverse reactions such as 
dizziness and visual disturbances are uncommon (see section 4.8). If affected, patients should not 
drive or use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and nausea are among those adverse reactions that have been 
most commonly reported in clinical studies (and also from post-marketing use). In addition, the safety 
profile is similar for different formulations, treatment indications, age groups and patient populations. 
No dose-related adverse reactions have been identified. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse reactions have been identified or suspected in the clinical studies programme 
for esomeprazole and post-marketing. The reactions are classified according to MedDRA frequency 
convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is very limited experience to date with deliberate overdose. The symptoms described in 
connection with 280 mg esomeprazole were gastrointestinal symptoms and weakness. Single doses of 
80 mg esomeprazole were uneventful. No specific antidote is known. Esomeprazole is extensively 
plasma protein bound and is therefore not readily dialysable. Treatment should be symptomatic and 
general supportive measures should be utilised.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs for acid related disorders, proton pump inhibitors, 
ATC code: A02BC05. 
Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole and reduces gastric acid secretion through a specific 
targeted mechanism of action. It is a specific inhibitor of the acid pump in the parietal cell. Both the R- 
and S-isomer of omeprazole have similar pharmacodynamic activity. 
Mechanism of action 
Esomeprazole is a weak base and is concentrated and converted to the active form in the highly acidic 
environment of the secretory canaliculi of the parietal cell, where it inhibits the enzyme H+K+-ATPase 
(the acid pump) and inhibits both basal and stimulated acid secretion. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
After oral dosing with esomeprazole 20 mg and 40 mg the onset of effect occurs within one hour. 
After repeated administration with 20 mg esomeprazole once daily for five days, mean peak acid 
output after pentagastrin stimulation is decreased 90% when measured 6-7 hours after dosing on day 
five. 
After five days of oral dosing with 20 mg and 40 mg of esomeprazole, intragastric pH above 4 was 
maintained for a mean time of 13 hours and 17 hours, respectively over 24 hours in symptomatic 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) patients. The proportion of patients maintaining an 
intragastric pH above 4 for at least 8, 12 and 16 hours respectively were for esomeprazole 20 mg 76%, 
54%, and 24%. Corresponding proportions for esomeprazole 40 mg were 97%, 92%, and 56%. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using AUC as a surrogate parameter for plasma concentration, a relationship between inhibition of 
acid secretion and exposure has been shown. 
During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products, serum gastrin increases in response to the 
decreased acid secretion. Also CgA increases due to decreased gastric acidity. The increased CgA 
level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. 
Available published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be discontinued between  
5 days and 2 weeks prior to CgA measurements. This is to allow CgA levels that might be spuriously 
elevated following PPI treatment to return to reference range. 
An increased number of ECL cells possibly related to the increased serum gastrin levels, have been 
observed in some patients during long-term treatment with esomeprazole. 
Decreased gastric acidity due to any means including PPIs, increases gastric counts of bacteria 
normally present in the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment with PPIs may lead to slightly increased risk 
of gastrointestinal infections such as Salmonella and Campylobacter and in hospitalised patients, also 
possibly Clostridium difficile. 
Clinical efficacy 
Esomeprazole 20 mg has been demonstrated to effectively treat frequent heartburn in subjects 
receiving one dose per 24 hours over 2 weeks. In two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled pivotal studies 234 subjects with a recent history of frequent heartburn were treated 
with 20 mg esomeprazole for 4 weeks. Symptoms associated with acid reflux (such as heartburn and 
acid regurgitation) were evaluated retrospectively over a 24 hour period. In both studies esomeprazole 
20 mg was significantly better compared to placebo for the primary endpoint, complete resolution of 
heartburn, defined as no heartburn episodes during the last 7 days prior to the final visit 
(33.9% - 41.6% vs. placebo 11.9 - 13.7%, (p<0.001). The secondary endpoint of complete resolution 
of heartburn, defined as no heartburn on the patient’s diary card for 7 consecutive days, was 
statistically significant at both week 1 (10.0% - 15.2% vs. placebo 0.9% - 2.4%, p = 0.014, p<0.001) 
and week 2 (25.2% - 35.7% vs. placebo 3.4% - 9.0%, p<0.001).  
Other secondary endpoints were supportive of the primary endpoint, including relief of heartburn at 
week 1 and week 2, percentage of 24 hour days without heartburn at week 1 and week 2, mean 
heartburn severity at week 1 and week 2, and time to initial and sustained resolution of heartburn over 
a 24 hour period and during the night compared to placebo. Approximately 78% of the subjects on 
20 mg esomeprazole reported first resolution of heartburn within the first week of treatment compared 
to 52 - 58% for placebo. Time to sustained resolution of heartburn, defined as when 7 consecutive 
days of no heartburn was first recorded, was significantly shorter in the esomeprazole 20 mg group 
(39.7% - 48.7% by day 14 vs. placebo 11.0% - 20.2%). The median time to first resolution of 
night-time heartburn was 1 day, statistically significant compared to placebo in one study (p=0.048) 
and approaching significance in the other (p=0.069). About 80% of nights were heartburn free during 
all time periods and 90% of nights were heartburn free by week 2 of each clinical study, compared to 
72.4 - 78.3% for placebo. The investigators’ assessments of heartburn resolution were consistent with 
the subjects’ assessments, showing statistically significant differences between esomeprazole 
(34.7% - 41.8%) compared to placebo (8.0% - 11.4%). The investigators also found esomeprazole to 
be significantly more effective than placebo in resolving acid regurgitation (58.5% - 63.6% vs. 
placebo 28.3% - 37.4%) during the week 2 evaluation.  
Following Overall Treatment Evaluation (OTE) of patients at week 2, 78.0 - 80.7% of patients on 
esomeprazole 20 mg, compared to 72.4 - 78.3% for placebo, reported their condition as improved. The 
majority of these rated the importance of this change to be Important to Extremely Important in 
performing their activities of daily living (79 - 86% at week 2).

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Esomeprazole is acid labile and is administered orally as enteric-coated granules. In vivo conversion to 
the R-isomer is negligible. Absorption of esomeprazole is rapid, with peak plasma levels occurring 
approximately 1-2 hours after dose. The absolute bioavailability is 64% after a single dose of 40 mg 
and increases to 89% after repeated once-daily administration. For 20 mg esomeprazole the 
corresponding values are 50% and 68% respectively. Food intake both delays and decreases the 
absorption of esomeprazole although this has no significant influence on the effect of esomeprazole on 
intragastric acidity.  
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution at steady state in healthy subjects is approximately 0.22 l/kg body 
weight. Esomeprazole is 97% plasma protein bound. 
Biotransformation  
Esomeprazole is completely metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system (CYP). The major part of 
the metabolism of esomeprazole is dependent on the polymorphic CYP2C19, responsible for the 
formation of the hydroxy- and desmethyl metabolites of esomeprazole. The remaining part is 
dependent on another specific isoform, CYP3A4, responsible for the formation of esomeprazole 
sulphone, the main metabolite in plasma. 
Elimination 
The parameters below reflect mainly the pharmacokinetics in individuals with a functional CYP2C19 
enzyme, extensive metabolisers. 
Total plasma clearance is about 17 l/h after a single dose and about 9 l/h after repeated administration. 
The plasma elimination half-life is about 1.3 hours after repeated once-daily dosing. Esomeprazole is 
completely eliminated from plasma between doses with no tendency for accumulation during 
once-daily administration. The major metabolites of esomeprazole have no effect on gastric acid 
secretion. Almost 80% of an oral dose of esomeprazole is excreted as metabolites in the urine, the 
remainder in the faeces. Less than 1% of the parent compound is found in urine. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The pharmacokinetics of esomeprazole has been studied in doses up to 40 mg b.i.d. The area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve increases with repeated administration of esomeprazole. This 
increase is dose-dependent and results in a more than dose proportional increase in AUC after repeated 
administration. This time and dose-dependency is due to a decrease of first pass metabolism and 
systemic clearance probably caused by an inhibition of the CYP2C19 enzyme by esomeprazole and/or 
its sulphone metabolite.  
Special patient populations 
Poor metabolisers 
Approximately 2.9±1.5% of the population lack a functional CYP2C19 enzyme and are called poor 
metabolisers. In these individuals the metabolism of esomeprazole is probably mainly catalysed by 
CYP3A4. After repeated once-daily administration of 40 mg esomeprazole, the mean area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve was approximately 100% higher in poor metabolisers than in subjects 
having a functional CYP2C19 enzyme (extensive metabolisers). Mean peak plasma concentrations 
were 60% higher. 
These findings have no implications for the posology of esomeprazole. 
Gender 
Following a single dose of 40 mg esomeprazole the mean are under the plasma concentration-time 
curve is approximately 30% higher in females than in males. No gender difference is seen after 
repeated once-daily administration. These findings have no implications for the posology of 
esomeprazole. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
The metabolism of esomeprazole in patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction may be impaired. 
The metabolic rate is decreased in patients with severe liver dysfunction resulting in a doubling of the 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve of esomeprazole. Therefore, a maximum of 20 mg 
should not be exceeded in patients with severe dysfunction. Esomeprazole or its major metabolites do 
not show any tendency to accumulate with once-daily dosing. 
Renal impairment 
No studies have been performed in patients with decreased renal function. Since the kidney is 
responsible for the excretion of the metabolites of esomeprazole but not for the elimination of the 
parent compound, the metabolism of esomeprazole is not expected to be changed in patients with 
impaired renal function. 
Elderly patients (≥65 years old) 
The metabolism of esomeprazole is not significantly changed in elderly patients (71-80 years of age). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no particular hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development.  
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
Carcinogenicity studies in the rat with the racemic mixture have shown gastric ECL-cell hyperplasia 
and carcinoids. These gastric effects in the rat are the result of sustained, pronounced 
hypergastrinaemia secondary to reduced production of gastric acid and are observed after long-term 
treatment in the rat with inhibitors of gastric acid secretion.

- Further helpful information 
1.  What Nexium Control is and what it is used for 
Nexium Control contains the active substance esomeprazole. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
‘proton pump inhibitors’. They work by reducing the amount of acid that your stomach produces. 
This medicine is used in adults for the short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (for example, 
heartburn and acid regurgitation). 
Reflux is the backflow of acid from the stomach into the gullet (“foodpipe”) which may become 
inflamed and painful. This may cause you symptoms such as a painful sensation in the chest rising up 
to your throat (heartburn) and a sour taste in the mouth (acid regurgitation). 
Nexium Control is not meant to bring immediate relief. You may need to take the tablets for 2-3 days 
in a row before you feel better. You must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel worse 
after 14 days. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Nexium Control  
Do not take Nexium Control  
- 
If you are allergic to esomeprazole or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
If you are allergic to medicines containing other proton pump inhibitors (e.g. pantoprazole, 
lansoprazole, rabeprazole or omeprazole). 
If you are taking a medicine containing nelfinavir (used to treat HIV infection). 
- 
- 
Do not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before taking Nexium Control if: 
• 
You have had a stomach ulcer or stomach surgery in the past.

food intake. 
You begin to vomit food or blood, which may appear as dark coffee grounds in your vomit. 
You pass black stools (blood-stained faeces). 
You have severe or persistent diarrhoea; esomeprazole has been associated with a small 
increased risk of infectious diarrhoea. 
You get a rash on your skin, especially in areas exposed to the sun tell your doctor as soon as 
you can, as you may need to stop your treatment with Nexium Control. Remember to also 
mention any other ill-effects like pain in your joints.

1.  What Nexium Control is and what it is used for 
Nexium Control contains the active substance esomeprazole. It belongs to a group of medicines called 
‘proton pump inhibitors’. They work by reducing the amount of acid that your stomach produces. 
This medicine is used in adults for the short-term treatment of reflux symptoms (for example, 
heartburn and acid regurgitation). 
Reflux is the backflow of acid from the stomach into the gullet (“foodpipe”) which may become 
inflamed and painful. This may cause you symptoms such as a painful sensation in the chest rising up 
to your throat (heartburn) and a sour taste in the mouth (acid regurgitation). 
Nexium Control is not meant to bring immediate relief. You may need to take the capsules for 2-3 
days in a row before you feel better. You must talk to a doctor if you do not feel better or if you feel 
worse after 14 days. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Nexium Control

section 6).

lansoprazole, rabeprazole or omeprazole). 
If you are taking a medicine containing nelfinavir (used to treat HIV infection). 
• 
• 
Do not take this medicine if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking this medicine.

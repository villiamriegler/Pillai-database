CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
ZINPLAVA is indicated for the prevention of recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in
adult and paediatric patients 1 year of age and older at high risk for recurrence of CDI (see sections
4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
ZINPLAVA should be administered during the course of antibacterial therapy for CDI (see sections
4.4 and 5.1).
Adult and paediatric patients 1 year of age and older
ZINPLAVA should be administered as a single intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg (see below and
section 6.6).
The experience with ZINPLAVA in patients is limited to a single CDI episode and single
administration (see section 4.4).
Special populations
Elderly
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 5.2).
2
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
There is no relevant use of bezlotoxumab in children under 1 year of age for the indication of
prevention of CDI.
Method of administration
• 
• 
• 
Administer the diluted solution for infusion intravenously over 60 minutes using a sterile,
non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2 micron to 5 micron in-line or add-on filter. ZINPLAVA
should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.
The diluted solution can be infused via a central line or peripheral catheter. 
ZINPLAVA must not be co-administered with other medicinal products simultaneously through
the same infusion line.
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
ZINPLAVA is not a treatment for CDI and has no effect on the current CDI episode. ZINPLAVA
should be administered during the course of antibacterial therapy for CDI. There is no data regarding
the efficacy of ZINPLAVA if given after the initial 10- to 14-days of antibacterial therapy for CDI.
ZINPLAVA should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus.
There is no experience with repeat administration of ZINPLAVA in patients with CDI. In clinical
trials, patients with CDI were only administered a single dose of ZINPLAVA (see section 5.1).
Sodium
This medicinal product contains up to 182.8 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 9.1 % of the WHO
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No formal interactions studies with other medicinal products were conducted. Therapeutic monoclonal
antibodies do not typically have significant drug-drug interaction potential, as they do not directly
affect cytochrome P450 enzymes and are not substrates of hepatic or renal transporters.
Bezlotoxumab-mediated drug-drug interactions are unlikely as the target of bezlotoxumab is an
exogenous toxin.
Concomitant oral standard of care (SoC) antibacterial therapy for CDI was given together with
ZINPLAVA.
3
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are limited data from the use of bezlotoxumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not
indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). ZINPLAVA should not be used during pregnancy
unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with bezlotoxumab.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether bezlotoxumab is secreted in human milk. Because monoclonal antibodies may
be excreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to not
administer ZINPLAVA, taking into account the importance of ZINPLAVA to the mother.
Fertility
No clinical data are available on the possible effects of bezlotoxumab on fertility. Fertility studies have
not been conducted in animals. There was no binding of bezlotoxumab to reproductive tissue in tissue
cross-reactivity studies, and no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs in repeat
dose toxicity studies in mice (see section 5.3).
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Bezlotoxumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The safety profile of ZINPLAVA was assessed in two Phase 3 clinical studies in adults. The most
common adverse reactions following treatment with ZINPLAVA (reported in ≥ 4 % of patients within
the first 4 weeks of infusion) were nausea, diarrhoea, pyrexia and headache. These adverse reactions
were reported at a similar frequency in placebo treated patients compared with ZINPLAVA-treated
patients.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Table 1 presents the adverse reactions reported within 4 weeks of infusion in ZINPLAVA-treated
patients and listed by System Organ Class. The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows:
very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare
(≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare (< 1/10 000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available
data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing
frequency.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Serious adverse reactions
In clinical studies, serious adverse reactions occurring within 12 weeks following infusion were
reported in 29 % of ZINPLAVA-treated patients and 33 % in patients receiving placebo.
Infusion related reactions
Overall, 10 % of subjects in the ZINPLAVA group experienced one or more infusion specific adverse
reactions on the day of, or the day after, the infusion compared to 8 % in the placebo group. Infusion
specific adverse reactions reported in ≥ 0.5 % of subjects receiving ZINPLAVA and at a frequency
greater than placebo were nausea (3 %), fatigue (1 %), pyrexia (1 %), dizziness (1 %), headache (2 %),
dyspnoea (1 %) and hypertension (1 %). Of the patients who experienced an infusion specific adverse
reaction, the majority reported a reaction with a maximum intensity of mild (78 %) or moderate
(20 %), and the majority of reactions resolved within 24 hours following onset.
Immune-related adverse reactions
In a Phase 1 clinical trial, healthy subjects received two consecutive doses of 10 mg/kg of
bezlotoxumab separated by 12 weeks. The adverse reactions after the second dose were not markedly
different from those observed after the first dose, and are consistent with adverse reactions observed in
the two Phase 3 trials (MODIFY I and MODIFY II; see section 5.1) in which all patients received a
single dose.
Paediatric population
The safety of ZINPLAVA was assessed in one Phase 3 clinical trial (MODIFY III) in which
107 paediatric patients 1 to < 18 years of age (4 patients 1 to < 2 years, 33 patients 2 to < 6 years,
26 patients 6 to < 12 years, and 44 patients 12 to < 18 years) received a single dose of 10 mg/kg of
ZINPLAVA. The safety profile in paediatric patients was consistent with that in adults.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
There is no clinical experience with overdosage of ZINPLAVA. In clinical trials, healthy subjects
received up to 20 mg/kg, which was generally well tolerated. In case of overdose, patients should be
closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment
should be instituted.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiinfectives for systemic use, antibacterial monoclonal antibodies.
ATC code: J06BC03
Mechanism of action
Bezlotoxumab is a human monoclonal antitoxin antibody that binds with high affinity to C. difficile
toxin B and neutralizes its activity. Bezlotoxumab prevents CDI recurrence by providing passive
immunity against toxin produced by the outgrowth of persistent or newly-acquired C. difficile spores.
5
Pharmacodynamic effects
Microbiology
Activity in vitro and in vivo
The toxin B epitope to which bezlotoxumab binds is conserved, though not identical, across all known
toxin sequences.
Clinical trials
The efficacy of ZINPLAVA (bezlotoxumab) was investigated in two randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multicentre, Phase 3 studies (MODIFY I and MODIFY II) where 810 patients
were randomised to bezlotoxumab and 803 to placebo. The number of patients completing the studies
and included in the full analysis set (FAS) was 781 in the ZINPLAVA group versus 773 in the placebo
group. All patients received concomitant standard of care antibacterial therapy for CDI.
Randomisation was stratified by the antibacterial agent and hospitalisation status (inpatient vs.
outpatient) at the time of study entry. Adult patients had a confirmed diagnosis of CDI, which was
defined as diarrhoea (passage of 3 or more loose bowel movements as defined in the Bristol stool chart
as types 5 through 7 in 24 or fewer hours) and a positive stool test for toxigenic C. difficile from a
stool sample collected no more than 7 days before study entry.
Patients received a 10- to 14-day course of oral antibacterial therapy for CDI (metronidazole,
vancomycin or fidaxomicin, chosen by the investigator). Patients on oral vancomycin or oral
fidaxomicin could have also received IV metronidazole. 
A single infusion of ZINPLAVA or placebo was administered prior to completion of antibacterial
therapy and patients were followed for 12 weeks following the infusion. The day of the infusion of
ZINPLAVA or placebo ranged from prior to the start of antibacterial therapy up to day 14 of
treatment, with a median on day 3.
The baseline characteristics of the 781 patients receiving ZINPLAVA and 773 receiving placebo were
generally similar across treatment groups. The median age was 65 years, 85 % were white, 57 % were
female, and 68 % were inpatients. A similar proportion of patients were receiving oral metronidazole
(48 %) or oral vancomycin (48 %) and only 4 % were receiving fidaxomicin as antibacterial treatment
for CDI.
The CDI recurrence rates are shown in Table 2.

Table 3 shows the results of a prospectively planned combined analysis of the CDI recurrence rates in
pre-specified subgroups of patients at high risk for CDI recurrence across the two Phase 3 Trials.
Overall, 51 % were ≥ 65 years, 29% were ≥ 75 years and 39 % received one or more systemic
6
antibacterial agents during the 12-week follow-up period. Of the total 28 % had one or more episodes
of CDI within the six months prior to the episode under treatment (18 % of the patients had one, 7 %
had two and a few patients had 3 or more prior episodes). Twenty-one (21) percent of the patients
were immunocompromised and 16 % presented with clinically severe CDI. Among the 976/1554
(62 %) patients who had a positive baseline stool culture for C. difficile a hypervirulent strain
(ribotypes 027, 078 or 244) was isolated in 22 % (217 of 976 patients), of which the majority (87 %,
189 of 217 strains) were ribotype 027.
These patients presented with risk factors primarily but not exclusively associated with higher risk of
CDI recurrence. Efficacy results did not point towards a benefit of ZINPLAVA in patients with no
known risk factors for CDI.

treatment arms.
Paediatric population 
ZINPLAVA was evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial
(MODIFY III) in paediatric patients aged 1 to < 18 years. Enrolled patients had a diagnosis of CDI
and received SoC (vancomycin, metronidazole, or fidaxomicin) for the baseline CDI episode. In this
trial, 143 patients were randomised and treated, of whom 107 received a single infusion of
ZINPLAVA (10 mg/kg) and 36 received a placebo infusion. Of these randomised patients, 58% were
1 to < 12 years of age, 52% were male, 80% were white, and 7% were multi-racial. The majority
(94%) of patients had one or more risk factors for CDI recurrence. The most common risk factors were
being immunocompromised (72.7%) and having received treatment with 1 or more systemic
antibacterial agents during treatment for CDI during the baseline episode (62.6%). 
The primary objectives in this study were to assess safety and pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab;
efficacy was a secondary descriptive endpoint. For results concerning pharmacokinetics, please refer
to section 5.2. Following administration of a single infusion of bezlotoxumab or placebo, the
percentage of patients in the mITT population with initial clinical response who had CDI recurrence
within 12 weeks and were at high risk for CDI recurrence was 12.1% (11/91) vs. 15.2% (5/33),
respectively.
7
Immunogenicity
Immunogenicity of ZINPLAVA was evaluated using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays in
MODIFY I, MODIFY II and MODIFY III.
Following treatment with ZINPLAVA in MODIFY I and MODIFY II, none of the 710 evaluable
patients tested positive for treatment-emergent anti-bezlotoxumab antibodies. Although ZINPLAVA is
intended for single dose administration, the immunogenicity of bezlotoxumab following a second
administration of 10 mg/kg, 12 weeks after the first dose, was assessed in 29 healthy subjects. No
anti-bezlotoxumab antibodies were detected after the second dose.
Following treatment with ZINPLAVA in MODIFY III, 2 of the 100 evaluable paediatric patients
tested positive for anti-bezlotoxumab antibodies; neither had neutralizing antibodies.
There are no data on repeated administration of bezlotoxumab in patients with CDI.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Bezlotoxumab is dosed via the IV route and therefore is immediately and completely bioavailable.
After a single IV dose of 10 mg/kg bezlotoxumab, geometric mean (%CV) AUC (0-∞), Cmax, and C12
weeks were 53 000 mcg.h/mL (40.2%), 185 mcg/mL (20.7%), and 3.23 mcg/mL (120.7%), respectively,
in patients with CDI. Bezlotoxumab exposures in healthy subjects increased in an approximately dose
proportional manner across the 0.3 to 20 mg/kg dose range.
Distribution
Bezlotoxumab has limited extravascular distribution. The mean volume of distribution of
bezlotoxumab was 7.33 L (CV: 16 %).
Biotransformation
Bezlotoxumab is catabolized through protein degradation processes; metabolism does not contribute to
its clearance.
Elimination
Bezlotoxumab is eliminated from the body primarily by protein degradation. The mean clearance of
bezlotoxumab was 0.317 L/day (CV: 41 %) and the terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 19 days
(28 %).
Special populations
The effects of various covariates on the pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab were assessed in a
population pharmacokinetic analysis. The clearance of bezlotoxumab increased with increasing body
weight; the resulting exposure differences are adequately addressed by the administration of a
weight-based dose.
The following factors had no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of bezlotoxumab and no
dose adjustment is required: age (range 18 to 100 years), gender, race, ethnicity, renal impairment,
hepatic impairment, and presence of co-morbid conditions.
8
Renal impairment
The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab was evaluated in patients
with mild (eGFR 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), or severe
(eGFR 15 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal impairment, or with end stage renal disease
(eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2), as compared to patients demonstrating normal (eGFR
≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) renal function. No clinically meaningful differences in the exposure of
bezlotoxumab were found between patients with renal impairment and patients with normal renal
function.
Hepatic impairment
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab was evaluated in patients
with hepatic impairment (defined as having two or more of the following: [1] albumin ≤ 3.1 g/dL;
[2] ALT ≥ 2 X ULN; [3] total bilirubin ≥ 1.3 X ULN; or [4] mild, moderate or severe liver disease as
reported by the Charlson Co-morbidity Index), as compared to patients with normal hepatic function.
No clinically meaningful differences in the exposure of bezlotoxumab were found between patients
with hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function.
Elderly
The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab was evaluated in patients ranging from 18
to 100 years of age. No clinically meaningful differences in the exposure of bezlotoxumab were found
between elderly patients 65 years and older and patients under 65 years of age.
Paediatric population
The pharmacokinetics of bezlotoxumab in paediatric patients 1 year of age and older (N=91) who
were administered a single intravenous infusion of 10 mg/kg bezlotoxumab are shown in Table 4.
Bezlotoxumab exposure (AUC0-inf) in paediatric patients was similar to that in adults.

There is no apparent relationship between bezlotoxumab exposure and body weight following weight-
based dosing of bezlotoxumab in paediatric patients. Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis of
bezlotoxumab, the following factors had no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of
bezlotoxumab: age, sex, renal impairment, and race.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose
toxicity. Genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential have not been evaluated.
Animal reproduction or developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with bezlotoxumab.
There were no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs in mice based on repeat
dose toxicity studies and no binding to reproductive tissues was observed in tissue cross-reactivity
studies.

information for you.

Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.

2.  What you need to know before you are given ZINPLAVA
3.  How you are given ZINPLAVA
4.  Possible side effects
5.  How to store ZINPLAVA 
6.  Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What ZINPLAVA is and what it is used for
ZINPLAVA contains the active substance bezlotoxumab.
ZINPLAVA is a medicine that is given together with an antibiotic to prevent Clostridioides difficile
infection (CDI) from coming back in adults and children 1 year of age or older who have a high risk of
CDI coming back.
How ZINPLAVA works
•  When people get CDI, they are usually given an antibiotic to get rid of the infection, but CDI
can often come back within weeks or months.
• 
The bacteria responsible for CDI produce a toxin that can inflame and damage your colon,
causing stomach pain and severe diarrhoea. ZINPLAVA acts by attaching to the toxin and
blocking it, thereby preventing the symptoms of CDI from coming back.
2.  What you need to know before you are given ZINPLAVA
Talk to your doctor before you are given ZINPLAVA.
You should not be given ZINPLAVA if:
• 
you are allergic to bezlotoxumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in
section 6).
Warnings and precautions 
ZINPLAVA is not a treatment for CDI. ZINPLAVA has no effect on the CDI you have now. 
ZINPLAVA is given with the antibiotic therapy you are taking for CDI.
Children
ZINPLAVA should not be used in children below 1 year of age.
Other medicines and ZINPLAVA
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.
27
If you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant, tell your doctor.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
• 
•  We don’t know if ZINPLAVA will harm your baby while you are pregnant. 
• 
•  We don’t know if ZINPLAVA gets in your breast milk and is passed to your baby.
• 
If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, check with your doctor first.
You and your doctor should decide together if you will use ZINPLAVA.
Driving and using machines
ZINPLAVA has no or very little effect on the ability to drive and use machines.
ZINPLAVA contains sodium
This medicine contains up to 182.8 mg sodium (main component of cooking / table salt) in each vial.
This is equivalent to 9.1 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.
3.  How you are given ZINPLAVA
• 
• 
You will get ZINPLAVA as an infusion (drip) into a vein.
You will get ZINPLAVA in one dose and it will take about 1 hour. Your dose will be calculated
using your body weight.
• 
You should keep taking your antibiotic for CDI as directed by your doctor.
If you miss an appointment to get ZINPLAVA
• 
• 
It is very important that you do not miss the dose of this medicine.
Call your doctor or healthcare professional right away to reschedule your appointment.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

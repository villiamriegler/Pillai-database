CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Intuniv is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children 
and adolescents 6-17 years old for whom stimulants are not suitable, not tolerated or have been shown 
to be ineffective.
Intuniv must be used as a part of a comprehensive ADHD treatment programme, typically including 
psychological, educational and social measures.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment must be initiated under the supervision of an appropriate specialist in childhood and/or 
adolescent behavioural disorders.
Pre-treatment screening
Prior to prescribing, it is necessary to conduct a baseline evaluation to identify patients at increased 
risk of somnolence and sedation, hypotension and bradycardia, QT-prolongation arrhythmia and 
weight increase/risk of obesity. This evaluation should address a patient’s cardiovascular status 
including blood pressure and heart rate, documenting comprehensive history of concomitant 
medications, past and present co-morbid medical and psychiatric disorders or symptoms, family 
history of sudden cardiac/unexplained death and accurate recording of pre-treatment height and weight 
on a growth chart (see section 4.4).
Posology
Careful dose titration and monitoring is necessary at the start of treatment since clinical improvement 
and risks for several clinically significant adverse reactions (syncope, hypotension, bradycardia, 
somnolence and sedation) are dose- and exposure-related. Patients should be advised that somnolence 
and sedation can occur, particularly early in treatment or with dose increases. If somnolence and 
sedation are judged to be clinically concerning or persistent, a dose decrease or discontinuation should 
be considered.
For all patients, the recommended starting dose is 1 mg of guanfacine, taken orally once a day.
The dose may be adjusted in increments of not more than 1 mg per week. Dose should be 
individualised according to the patient’s response and tolerability.
Depending on the patient’s response and tolerability for Intuniv the recommended maintenance dose 
range is 0.05-0.12 mg/kg/day. The recommended dose titration for children and adolescents is 
3
provided below (see tables 1 and 2). Dose adjustments (increase or decrease) to a maximum tolerated 
dose within the recommended optimal weight-adjusted dose range based upon clinical judgement of 
response and tolerability may occur at any weekly interval after the initial dose.
Monitoring during titration
During dose titration, weekly monitoring for signs and symptoms of somnolence and sedation, 
hypotension and bradycardia should be performed.
Ongoing monitoring
During the first year of treatment, the patient should be assessed at least every 3 months for:

Signs and symptoms of:
o
o
o
somnolence and sedation
hypotension
bradycardia
weight increase/risk of obesity

It is recommended clinical judgement be exercised during this period. 6 monthly monitoring should 
follow thereafter, with more frequent monitoring following any dose adjustments (see section 4.4).

The physician who elects to use guanfacine for extended periods (over 12 months) should re-evaluate 
the usefulness of guanfacine every 3 months for the first year and then at least yearly based on clinical 
judgement (see section 4.4), and consider trial periods off medication to assess the patient’s 
functioning without pharmacotherapy, preferably during times of school holidays.
4
Downward titration and discontinuation
Patients/caregivers should be instructed not to discontinue guanfacine without consulting their 
physician.
When stopping treatment, the dose must be tapered with decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 
7 days, and blood pressure and pulse should be monitored in order to minimise potential withdrawal 
effects, in particular increases in blood pressure and heart rate (see section 4.4).
In a maintenance of efficacy study, upon switching from guanfacine to placebo, 7/158 (4.4%) subjects 
experienced increases in blood pressure to values above 5 mmHg and also above the 95th percentile for 
age, sex and stature (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).
Missed dose
If a dose is missed, the prescribed dose can resume the next day. If two or more consecutive doses are 
missed, re-titration is recommended based on the patient’s tolerability to guanfacine.
Switching from other formulations of guanfacine
Immediate-release guanfacine tablets should not be substituted on a mg/mg basis, because of differing 
pharmacokinetic profiles.
Special populations
Adults and elderly
The safety and efficacy of guanfacine in adult and the elderly with ADHD has not been established.
Therefore, guanfacine should not be used in this group.
Hepatic impairment
Dose reduction may be required in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment (see
section 5.2).
The impact of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of guanfacine in paediatric patients 
(children and adolescents 6-17 years old) was not assessed.
Renal impairment
Dose reduction may be required in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 29-15 ml/min) and an 
end stage renal disease (GFR<15 ml/min) or requiring dialysis. The impact of renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetics of guanfacine in paediatric patients (children and adolescents 6-17 years old) was 
not assessed (see section 5.2).
Children under 6 years
The safety and efficacy of guanfacine in children aged less than 6 years have not yet been established.
No data are available.
Patients treated with CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 inhibitors/inducers
CYP3A4/5 inhibitors have been shown to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
guanfacine when co-administered. Dose adjustment is recommended with concomitant use of 
moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, grapefruit juice), or strong CYP3A4 
inducers (e.g., carbamazepine) (see section 4.5). 
In case of concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors, a 50% reduction of the 
guanfacine dose is recommended. Due to variability in interaction effect, further dose titration may be 
needed (see above). 
If guanfacine is combined with strong enzyme inducers, a retitration to increase the dose up to a 
maximum daily dose of 7 mg may be considered if needed. If the inducing treatment is ended, 
retitration to reduce the guanfacine dose is recommended during the following weeks (see section 4.5).
5
Method of administration
Oral use.
Guanfacine is taken once daily either morning or evening. Tablets should not be crushed, chewed or 
broken before swallowing because this increases the rate of guanfacine release.
Treatment is recommended only for children who are able to swallow the tablet whole without 
problems.
Guanfacine can be administered with or without food but should not be administered with high fat 
meals, due to increased exposure (see sections 4.5 and 5.2).
Guanfacine should not be administered together with grapefruit juice (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Hypotension, bradycardia and syncope
Guanfacine can cause syncope, hypotension and bradycardia. Syncope may involve risks of falls or 
accidents, which could result in serious harm (see sections 4.8 and 4.7).
Prior to initiation of treatment, patient’s cardiovascular status including heart rate and blood pressure 
parameters, family history of sudden cardiac death/unexplained death, should be assessed to identify 
patients at increased risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and QT-prolongation/risk of arrhythmia. 
Monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure parameters should continue on a weekly basis during dose 
titration and stabilisation and at least every 3 months for the first year, taking into consideration 
clinical judgement. 6 monthly monitoring should follow thereafter, with more frequent monitoring 
following any dose adjustment.
Caution is advised when treating patients with guanfacine who have a history of hypotension, heart
block, bradycardia, or cardiovascular disease, or who have a history of syncope or a condition that 
may predispose them to syncope, such as hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, or 
dehydration. Caution is also advised when treating patients who are being treated concomitantly with 
antihypertensives or other medicinal products that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase 
the risk of syncope (see section 4.5). Patients should be advised to drink plenty of fluid.
Blood pressure and heart rate increase upon discontinuation
Blood pressure and pulse may increase following discontinuation of guanfacine. In post-marketing 
experience, hypertensive encephalopathy has been very rarely reported upon abrupt discontinuation of 
treatment (see section 4.8). To minimise the risk of an increase in blood pressure upon discontinuation, 
the total daily dose should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days (see 
section 4.2). Blood pressure and pulse should be monitored when reducing the dose or discontinuing 
treatment.
QTc interval
In phase II-III randomised double-blind monotherapy studies respective increases in QTc interval 
prolongation that exceeded change from baseline greater than >60 ms Fridericia-correction and 
Bazett-correction were 0 (0.0%) and 2 (0.3%) among placebo and 1 (0.1%) and 1 (0.1%) among 
guanfacine patients. The clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain.
6
Guanfacine should be prescribed with caution in patients with a known history of QT prolongation,
risk factors for torsade de pointes (e.g., heart block, bradycardia, hypokalaemia) or patients who are 
taking medicinal products known to prolong the QT interval (see section 4.5). These patients should 
receive further cardiac evaluation based on clinical judgement (see section 4.8).
Sedation and somnolence
Guanfacine may cause somnolence and sedation predominantly at the start of treatment and could 
typically last for 2-3 weeks and longer in some cases. It is therefore recommended that patients will be 
closely monitored weekly during dose titration and stabilisation (see section 4.2), and every 3 months 
during the first year, taking into consideration clinical judgement. Before guanfacine is used with any 
other centrally active depressants (such as alcohol, sedatives, phenothiazines, barbiturates, or 
benzodiazepines) the potential for additive sedative effects should be considered (see section 4.5).
Patients should not drink alcohol whilst taking guanfacine.
Patients are advised against operating heavy equipment, driving or cycling until they know how they 
respond to treatment with guanfacine (see section 4.7).
Suicidal ideation
There have been post-marketing reports of suicide-related events (including suicidal ideation, attempts 
and  completed  suicide)  in patients  treated  with  guanfacine.  In  most  cases, patients  had  underlying 
psychiatric disorders. Therefore, it is recommended that caregivers and physicians monitor patients for 
signs  of  suicide-related  events,  including  at  dose  initiation/optimisation  and drug  discontinuation. 
Patients and caregivers should be encouraged to report any distressing thoughts or feelings at any time 
to their healthcare professional.
Aggression
Aggressive  behaviour  or  hostility  has  been  reported  in  clinical  trials  and  in  the  post-marketing 
experience of guanfacine. Patients treated with guanfacine should be monitored for the appearance of 
aggressive behaviour or hostility.
Effects on height, weight and Body Mass index (BMI)
Children and adolescents treated with guanfacine may show an increase in their BMI. Therefore, 
monitoring of height, weight and BMI should be done prior to initiation of therapy and then every 
3 months for the first year, taking into consideration clinical judgement. 6 monthly monitoring should 
follow thereafter, with more frequent monitoring following any dose adjustment.
Excipients
Intuniv contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
When guanfacine is used concomitantly with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors or inducers, plasma concentrations 
of guanfacine may be elevated or lowered, potentially affecting the efficacy and safety of guanfacine. 
Guanfacine can increase plasma concentrations of concomitantly administered medicinal products that 
are metabolised via CYP3A4/5 (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2).
Guanfacine is an in vitro inhibitor of MATE1 and the clinical relevance of MATE1 inhibition cannot 
be excluded. Concomitant administration of guanfacine with MATE1 substrates may result in 
7
increases in the plasma concentrations of these medicinal products. Furthermore, based on in vitro
studies, guanfacine may be an inhibitor of OCT1 at maximal portal vein concentrations. Concomitant 
administration of guanfacine with OCT1 substrates with a similar Tmax (e.g., metformin) may result in 
increases in Cmax of these medicinal products.
The pharmacodynamic effect of guanfacine can have an additive effect when taken with other 
products known to cause sedation, hypotension or QT prolongation (see section 4.4).
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. However, the outcome is expected to be 
similar in the indicated paediatric age range.
QT prolonging medicinal products
Guanfacine causes a decrease in heart rate. Given the effect of guanfacine on heart rate, the 
concomitant use of guanfacine with QT prolonging medicinal products is generally not recommended
(see section 4.4).
CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 inhibitors
Caution should be used when guanfacine is administered to patients taking ketoconazole and other 
moderate and strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, a decrease in the dose of guanfacine within the 
recommended dose range is proposed (see section 4.2). Co-administration of guanfacine with 
moderate and strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors elevates plasma guanfacine concentrations and increases 
the risk of adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. There was a substantial 
increase in the rate and extent of guanfacine exposure when administered with ketoconazole; the 
guanfacine peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and exposure (AUC) increased 2- and 3-fold, 
respectively. Other CYP3A4/5 inhibitors may have a comparable effect, see table 3 for a list of 
examples of moderate and strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, this list is not definitive.
CYP3A4 inducers
When patients are taking guanfacine concomitantly with a CYP3A4 inducer, an increase in the dose of 
guanfacine within the recommended dose range is proposed (see section 4.2). There was a significant 
decrease in the rate and extent of guanfacine exposure when co-administered with rifampicin, a 
CYP3A4 inducer. The peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and exposure (AUC) of guanfacine 
decreased by 54% and 70% respectively. Other CYP3A4 inducers may have a comparable effect, see 
table 3 for a list of examples of CYP3A4/5 inducers, this list is not definitive.

Valproic acid
Co-administration of guanfacine and valproic acid can result in increased concentrations of valproic 
acid. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown, although both guanfacine and valproic acid are 
metabolised by glucuronidation, possibly resulting in competitive inhibition. When guanfacine is 
co-administered with valproic acid, patients should be monitored for potential additive central nervous 
system (CNS) effects and consideration should be given to the monitoring of serum valproic acid 
concentrations. Adjustments in the dose of valproic acid and guanfacine may be indicated when co-
administered.
Antihypertensive medicinal products
Caution should be used when guanfacine is administered concomitantly with antihypertensive 
medicinal products, due to the potential for additive pharmacodynamic effects such as hypotension 
and syncope (see section 4.4).
CNS depressant medicinal products
Caution should be used when guanfacine is administered concomitantly with CNS depressant 
medicinal products (e.g., alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and 
antipsychotics) due to the potential for additive pharmacodynamic effects such as sedation and 
somnolence (see section 4.4).
Oral methylphenidate
In an interaction study, neither guanfacine nor Osmotic Release Oral System (OROS)-
methylphenidate HCl extended-release were found to affect the pharmacokinetics of the other 
medicinal products when taken in combination.
Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate
In a drug interaction study, administration of guanfacine in combination with lisdexamfetamine 
dimesylate induced a 19% increase in guanfacine maximum plasma concentrations, whereas exposure 
(AUC) was increased by 7%. These small changes are not expected to be clinically meaningful. In this 
study, no effect on d-amphetamine exposure was observed following combination of guanfacine and 
lisdexamfetamine dimesylate.
Food interactions
Guanfacine should not be administered with high fat meals due to increased exposure, as it has been 
shown that high fat meals have a significant effect on the absorption of guanfacine (see section 4.2).
4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of guanfacine in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Guanfacine is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether guanfacine and its metabolites are excreted in human milk.
9
Available pharmacodynamic and toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of guanfacine 
and its metabolites in milk (see section 5.3). Therefore, a risk on the breast-fed infant cannot be 
excluded.
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue and/or abstain from 
guanfacine therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman.
Fertility
There are no or limited amount of data regarding effect on fertility from the use of guanfacine in 
humans.
Animal studies indicate an effect on male fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Guanfacine may have a moderate to severe influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Guanfacine can cause dizziness and somnolence. These effects occur predominantly at the start of
treatment and may occur less frequently as treatment continues. Syncope has also been observed. 
Patients should be warned of these possible effects and be advised that if affected, they should avoid 
these activities (see section 4.4).
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The most frequently reported adverse reactions include somnolence (40.6%), headache (27.4%), 
fatigue (18.1%), abdominal pain upper (12.0%), and sedation (10.2%). The most serious adverse 
reactions commonly reported include hypotension (3.2%), weight increase (2.9%), bradycardia (1.5%) 
and syncope (0.7%). The adverse reactions somnolence and sedation occurred predominantly at the 
start of treatment and may typically last for 2-3 weeks and longer in some cases.

Somnolence/sedation, hypotension, bradycardia and syncope
In the overall pool of guanfacine-treated patients, somnolence occurred in 40.6% and sedation in 
10.2% of guanfacine-treated patients. Bradycardia occurred in 1.5%, hypotension in 3.2% and syncope 
occurred in 0.7% of all guanfacine-treated patients. The occurrence of somnolence/sedation and 
hypotension was most prominent in the first few weeks of treatment and diminished gradually 
thereafter.
Effects on height, weight and body Mass index (BMI)
Careful follow-up for weight suggests that children and adolescents who took guanfacine in the study 
(i.e., treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year) have demonstrated by an age- and 
sex-normalised mean change from baseline in BMI percentile, 4.3 over 1 year (average percentiles at 
baseline and 12 months were 68.3 and 73.1, respectively). Consequently, as part of routine monitoring 
height, weight and BMI should be monitored at the start of treatment and every 3 months during the 
first year, then 6 monthly taking into consideration clinical judgement with maintenance of a growth
chart.
Thorough QT /QTc study
The effect of 2 dose levels of immediate-release guanfacine (4 mg and 8 mg) on QT interval was 
evaluated in a double-blind, randomised, placebo- and active-controlled, cross-over study in healthy 
adults. An apparent increase in mean QTc was observed for both doses. This finding has no known 
clinical relevance.
In phase II-III randomised double-blind monotherapy studies respective increases in QTc interval 
prolongation that exceeded change from baseline greater than 60 ms Fridericia-correction and 
Bazett-correction were 0 (0.0%) and 2 (0.3%) among placebo and 1 (0.1%) and 1 (0.1%) among 
guanfacine patients. The clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain.
Blood pressure and heart rate increase upon discontinuation of guanfacine
Blood pressure and pulse may increase following discontinuation of guanfacine. In post-marketing 
experience, hypertensive encephalopathy has been very rarely reported upon abrupt discontinuation of 
guanfacine (see section 4.4).
In a maintenance of efficacy study in children and adolescents, increases in mean systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure of approximately 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg, respectively, above original baseline were 
observed upon discontinuation of guanfacine. However, individuals may have larger increases than 
12
reflected by the mean changes. The increases in blood pressure were observed in some individuals at 
the end of the follow up period which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose (see sections 4.2 
and 5.1).
Adult patients
Guanfacine has not been studied in adults with ADHD.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Signs and symptoms of overdose may include hypotension, initial hypertension, bradycardia, lethargy, 
and respiratory depression. Haemodynamic instability has also been associated with a guanfacine 
overdose 3 times the recommended daily dose. Management of guanfacine overdose should include 
monitoring for and treatment of these signs and symptoms.
Paediatric patients (children and adolescents 6-17 years old inclusive) who develop lethargy should be 
observed for the development of more serious toxicity including coma, bradycardia, and hypotension 
for up to 24 hours, due to the possibility of delayed onset of these symptoms.
Treatment of overdose may include gastric lavage if it is performed soon after ingestion. Activated 
charcoal may be useful in limiting the absorption. Guanfacine is not dialysable in clinically significant 
amounts (2.4%).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antihypertensives, antiadrenergic agents, centrally acting ATC code: 
C02AC02.
Mechanism of action
Guanfacine is a selective alpha2A-adrenergic receptor agonist in that it has 15-20 times higher affinity 
for this receptor subtype than for the alpha2B or alpha2C subtypes. Guanfacine is a non-stimulant. The 
mode of action of guanfacine in ADHD is not fully established. Preclinical research suggests 
guanfacine modulates signalling in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia through direct modification 
of synaptic noradrenalin transmission at the alpha2A-adrenergic receptors.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Guanfacine is a known antihypertensive agent. By stimulating alpha2A-adrenergic receptors, 
guanfacine reduces sympathetic nerve impulses from the vasomotor centre to the heart and blood 
vessels. This results in a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure, and a reduction 
in heart rate.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The effects of guanfacine in the treatment of ADHD has been examined in 5 controlled studies in 
children and adolescents (6 to 17 years), 3 short-term controlled trials in children and adolescents aged 
13
6 to 17 years, 1 short-term controlled study in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years, and 1 randomised 
withdrawal trial in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years, all of whom met the DSM-IV-TR criteria 
for ADHD. The majority of patients achieved an optimised dose between 0.05-0.12 mg/kg/day.
Three hundred and thirty-seven patients aged 6-17 years were evaluated in the pivotal Phase 3 Study 
SPD503-316, to assess safety and efficacy of once-daily dosing (children:1-4 mg/day, adolescents:
1-7 mg/day). In this 12-week (6-12 years) or 15-week (13-17 years), randomised, double-blind, 
parallel-group, placebo- and active-reference (atomoxetine), dose-titration study, guanfacine showed 
significantly greater efficacy than placebo on symptoms of ADHD based upon investigator ratings on 
the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS). The ADHD Rating Scale is a measure of the core symptoms of 
ADHD. The results with respect to the primary endpoint study are presented in Table 5.

Results of the secondary endpoints were consistent with that of the primary endpoint. The percentages 
of subjects who met response criteria (≥30% reduction from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV Total Score 
and a CGI-I value of 1 or 2) was 64.3% for guanfacine, 55.4% for atomoxetine and 42.3% for placebo. 
Guanfacine also showed significant improvement in learning, school and family functioning as 
measured with the (WFIRS-P score).
In addition a 15-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-optimisation study 
(SPD503-312) conducted in adolescents aged 13-17 years (n=314) to confirm the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of guanfacine (1-7 mg/day) in the treatment of ADHD. Guanfacine showed a significantly 
greater improvement in the ADHD-RS-IV total score compared with subjects receiving placebo.
Guanfacine-treated patients were in statistically significantly better conditions on the functional 
outcome as measured by the clinical global impression of severity (CGI-S) at endpoint compared to 
placebo-treated patients. Superiority (statistical significance) over placebo on the family and school, 
and learning domains of the WFIRS-P score was not established in this study.
Study (SPD503-315) was a 41 week long term maintenance of efficacy study which included an 
open-label phase (up to 13 weeks) followed by double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
randomised-withdrawal phase (up to 26 weeks), conducted in paediatric patients (children and 
adolescents aged 6-17 years old inclusive) (n=526 in the open-label phase and n=315 in the 
double-blind randomised-withdrawal phase) to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
once-daily dosing with guanfacine (children: 1-4 mg/day, adolescents:1-7 mg/day) in the treatment of 
ADHD. Guanfacine was superior to placebo in the long-term maintenance of treatment in children and 
adolescents with ADHD as measured by cumulative treatment failures (49.3% for guanfacine, and 
64.9% for placebo, p=0.006). Treatment failure was defined as a ≥50% increase in ADHD-RS-IV total 
score and a ≥2 point increase in CGI-S score compared to the respective scores at the double-blind 
baseline visit. At the end of their double-blind treatment, a significantly larger proportion of subjects 
in the guanfacine compared with placebo group were normal or borderline mentally ill as measured by 
the clinical global impression of severity (CGI-S) that includes assessment of functioning. Superiority 
(statistical significance) over placebo on the family and school, and learning domains of the WFIRS-P 
score was not consistently established in this study.
Similar results for the efficacy of guanfacine in the treatment of ADHD were established in 
2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose (range of 1-4 mg/day) monotherapy trials 
in paediatric patients (children and adolescents 6-17 years old inclusive). Studies SPD503-301 and 
14
SPD503-304 were 8 and 9 weeks in duration, respectively, both conducted in the United States. 
Guanfacine showed significantly greater improvement compared to placebo on the change from 
baseline to final on treatment assessment in the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) score in both 
studies (placebo-adjusted reduction in LS mean range from 5.4 to 10.0, p<0.02).
Study SPD503-314 was conducted in children aged 6-12 years to assess the efficacy of once daily 
dosing with guanfacine (1-4 mg) administered either in the morning or the evening. This was a 
double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-optimisation study, 9-weeks in duration conducted 
in the United States and Canada. Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated as the change from baseline to 
week 8 (final on treatment assessment) in the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS-IV) total scores. 
Guanfacine showed significantly greater improvement compared to placebo regardless of time (AM or 
PM) of administration (placebo-adjusted LS mean difference of -9.4 and -9.8 for AM and PM dosing, 
respectively, p<0.001).
Co-administration with psychostimulants
The effect of co-administration with psychostimulants was examined in an add-on study in partial 
responders to psychostimulants. The study was double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
multi-centre, dose-optimisation 9-weeks study. It was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
guanfacine (1, 2, 3, and 4 mg/day) when co-administered with long-acting psychostimulants 
(amphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate) in children and adolescents 
aged 6-17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD and a suboptimal, partial response to psychostimulants. 
Suboptimal response was defined as an ADHD-RS-IV total score of ≥24 and a CGI-S score ≥3 at 
screening and baseline. The primary efficacy assessment was the ADHD-RS-IV total score.
The results showed that patients treated with add-on guanfacine improved more on the ADHD-RS-IV 
compared to those treated with add-on placebo (20.7 (12.6) points vs. 15.9 (11.8); difference: 4.9 
(95% CI 2.6, 7.2). No age differences were observed with respect to response to the ADHD-RS-IV.
ADHD with oppositional symptoms study
Study SPD503-307 was a 9-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-optimisation 
study with guanfacine (1-4 mg/day) conducted in children aged 6-12 years with ADHD and 
oppositional symptoms (n=217). Oppositional symptoms were evaluated as the change from baseline 
to endpoint in the Oppositional Subscale of the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale – revised Long Form 
(CPRS-R:L) score. Results show statistically significantly (p≤0.05) greater mean reductions at 
endpoint from Baseline (indicating improvement) in oppositional subscale of CPRS-R:L scores in the 
guanfacine group compared to placebo (10.9 points vs. 6.8 for guanfacine vs. placebo, respectively) 
and the effect size was 0.6 (p<0.001). These reductions represent a percentage reduction of 56% vs. 
33% for guanfacine vs. placebo, respectively.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
Guanfacine is readily absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations reached approximately 5 hours after 
oral administration in paediatric patients (children and adolescents 6-17 years old inclusive). In adults, 
the mean exposure of guanfacine increased (Cmax ~75% and AUC ~40%) when guanfacine was taken 
together with a high fat meal, compared to intake in the fasted state (see section 4.2).
Distribution
Guanfacine is moderately bound to plasma proteins (approximately 70%), independent of active 
substance concentration.
Biotransformation
Guanfacine is metabolised via CYP3A4/5-mediated oxidation, with subsequent phase II reactions of 
sulfation and glucuronidation. The major circulating metabolite is 3-OH-guanfacine sulfate which 
lacks pharmacological activity.
15
Guanfacine is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and exposure is affected by CYP3A4 and 
CYP3A5 inducers and inhibitors. In human hepatic microsomes, guanfacine did not inhibit the 
activities of the other major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 or CYP3A5); guanfacine is also not expected to be an inducer of 
CYP3A, CYP1A2 and CYP2B6.
Transporters
Based on in vitro studies, guanfacine is a substrate of OCT1 and OCT2, but not BCRP, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1 or MATE2. Guanfacine is not an inhibitor of BSEP, MRP2, 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 or MATE2K, but it is an inhibitor of MATE1 and may 
be an inhibitor of OCT1 at maximal portal vein concentrations.
Elimination
Guanfacine is cleared by the kidneys via filtration and active secretion and the liver. Active renal 
secretion is mediated via OCT2 transporter. At least 50% of the clearance of guanfacine is hepatic. 
Renal excretion is the major elimination pathway (80%) with parent active substance accounting for 
30% of the urinary radioactivity. The major urinary metabolites were 3-hydroxy guanfacine 
glucuronide, guanfacine dihydrodiol, 3-hydroxy guanfacine sulfate. The elimination half-life of 
guanfacine is approximately 18 hours.
The pharmacokinetics of guanfacine is similar in children (aged 6 to 12) and adolescents (aged 
13 to 17) ADHD patients, and healthy adult volunteers.
Special populations
There have been no studies performed in children with ADHD under the age of 6 years with 
guanfacine.
Systemic exposure to guanfacine is similar for men and women given the same mg/kg dose.
Formal pharmacokinetic studies for race have not been conducted. There is no evidence of any impact 
of ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of guanfacine.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
No carcinogenic effect of guanfacine was observed in studies of 78 weeks in mice at doses up to 
10 mg/kg/day. A significant increase in incidence of adenomas of the pancreatic islet was observed in 
male rats treated with 5 mg/kg/day guanfacine for 102 weeks but not in female rats. The clinical 
relevance is unknown.
Guanfacine was not genotoxic in a variety of test models, including the Ames test and an in vitro
chromosomal aberration test.
General toxicity observed in animals (rat, dog) upon treatment with guanfacine included prolongation 
of uncorrected QT interval (heart), atrophic spleen and decreased white blood cells, affected liver –
increased bilirubin and ALT levels included, irritated and inflamed intestines, increased creatinine and 
blood urea nitrogen levels (kidney), corneal clouding (eye) in rat and mouse only, alveolar 
macrophage infiltration & pneumonitis and reduced spermatogenesis.
No adverse effects were observed in a fertility study in female rats at doses up to 22 times the 
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis.
Male fertility was affected at 8 mg/kg/day, the lowest dose tested, equivalent of 10.8 times the 
maximum recommended human dose of 0.12 mg/kg on a mg/m2 basis. Due to lack of proper 
16
toxicokinetic data, comparison to human clinical exposure was not possible.
Guanfacine showed embryo foetal developmental toxicity in mice and rats (NOAEL 0.5 mg/kg/day) 
and in rabbits (NOAEL 3.0 mg/kg/day) in the presence of maternal toxicity. Due to a lack of proper 
toxicokinetic data, comparison to human clinical exposure was not possible.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  liraglutide,  the  scientific 
conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
In view of available data on headache from clinical trial,  the literature, spontaneous reports including 
in  12  cases  a  close  temporal  relationship,  a  positive  de-challenge  and  in  at  least  one  case  a  re -
challenge and  in  view of  a  plausible mechanism of  action,  the  PRAC considers a  causal relationship 
between liraglutide in weight management and headache is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC 
concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products  containing  liraglutide  for  weight  management 
should be amended accordingly. 
Update  of  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  to  add  the  adverse reaction  ‘headache’  with  a  frequency  very 
common.  
The Package leaflet is to be updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s)  
On  the  basis of  the  scientific conclusions  for liraglutide  the  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  the  benefit-
risk balance of the  medicinal product(s)  containing  liraglutide  is unchanged  subject to  the  proposed 
changes to  the product information 
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

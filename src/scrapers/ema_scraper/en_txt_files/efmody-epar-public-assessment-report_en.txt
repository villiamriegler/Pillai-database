2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication applied for is: "Treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in adolescents aged 
12 years and over and adults." 
CAH is caused by genetic mutations in genes responsible for adrenal steroid hormone synthesis. 
Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by mutations in CYP21A2, the gene encoding adrenal 
steroid 21-hydroxylase. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The most recent estimates are that  the worldwide birth prevalence of classical CAH (CAH due to 21-
hydroxylase deficiency presenting at birth/during  childhood) ranges from 1:11,000  to  1:18,000  births 
(10,000  to 1:16,000  live births in the European and North American populations). A reasonable 
estimate is that CAH affects 0.5 to 2:10,000  people within  the European Union  (EU). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
CAH is an autosomal recessive condition commonly caused by mutations in  the 21 hydroxylase gene 
(CYP21A2), which plays a role in the cortisol biosynthetic pathway. Patients with  CAH have a cortisol 
deficiency, hyperandrogenism and may also present with  impaired production of aldosterone, which 
regulated the mineral homeostasis.

EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 9/79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 Adosterone, Cortisol, Testosterone biosynthetic pathways 
This enzyme converts 17-OHP  to 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone to deoxycorticosterone, with these 
products being precursors for cortisol and aldosterone. The blockage of cortisol synthesis leads to a 
rise in  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation of the adrenal cortex, resulting in a build-up  of 
steroid precursors such as progesterone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and especially 17-
hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP). A substantial fraction of the increased 17-OHP levels is diverted to the 
synthesis of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione (A4) and testosterone. See Figure 1. 
Disease severity is correlated with  genotype. Almost 300  pathogenic mutations in CYP21A2 are known, 
but  genotyping individuals with  CAH is difficult due to the  complexity of gene duplications, deletions, 
and rearrangements within chromosome 6p21.3.   
A minority of patients  have mutations in  11-beta-hydroxylase, 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 
17-hydroxylase or steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) deficiency (approximately 5% of the cases).  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is divided into the  classic (severe, early-onset) form and the 
non-classic (mild, late-onset) form. Classic CAH can be subdivided in salt-wasting CAH (approximately 
two-thirds  of patients) and simple-virilising CAH (one-third  of patients),  reflecting the degree of 
aldosterone deficiency.  
Clinical presentation in females 
Females with  severe forms of adrenal hyperplasia due to deficiencies of 21-hydroxylase, 11-beta-
hydroxylase or 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase have ambiguous genitalia at  birth due to excess 
adrenal androgen production  in utero. Salt-wasting CAH presents in the first weeks of life with failure 
to thrive, recurrent vomiting,  dehydration, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalaemia, and shock. 
Simple-virilising adrenal hyperplasia is identified  later in childhood because of precocious pubic hair, 
clitoromegaly, or both, often accompanied by accelerated growth and skeletal maturation due to 
excess postnatal exposure to adrenal androgens. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 10/79 
 
 
 
 
 
Milder deficiencies of 21-hydroxylase or 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (non-classic 
adrenal hyperplasia) may present in adolescence or adulthood with  oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, and/or 
infertility.  
Females with  17-hydroxylase deficiency appear phenotypically female at birth  but do not develop 
breasts or menstruate in adolescence because of inadequate estradiol production. They may present 
with  hypertension. 
Clinical presentation in males 
21-hydroxylase deficiency in males is generally not identified in the  neonatal period because the 
genitalia are normal. If the  defect is severe and results in salt wasting,  these male neonates present at 
age 1-4  weeks with  failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting,  dehydration, hypotension, hyponatremia, 
hyperkalemia, and shock. Patients with less severe deficiencies of 21-hydroxylase present later in 
childhood because of the early development of pubic hair, phallic enlargement, or both,  accompanied 
by accelerated linear growth and advancement of skeletal maturation (simple-virilising CAH). 
Adrenal crisis 
Due to  the insufficient or absent cortisol production,  patients with  CAH are at risk of adrenal crisis 
when experiencing physiological stress. This life-threatening condition requires emergency medical 
treatment.  
Diagnosis 
CAH is included in many neonatal screening programmes in the EU.  Early diagnosis can prevent 
significant morbidity and mortality. In general, the diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and the 
demonstration of inadequate production of cortisol, aldosterone, or both in the presence of 
accumulation of excess concentrations of precursor hormones such as 17-OHP. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The main goal of CAH treatment is glucocorticoid replacement therapy, ie replacing the  deficiency in 
corticosteroids while minimising  adrenal sex hormone and glucocorticoid excess, preventing virilisation, 
optimising growth,  and protecting potential fertility.  Management of classic CAH is, therefore, a difficult 
balance between hyperandrogenism and hypercortisolism. Optimal  treatment is hampered by the 
physiological rhythms in hormone production, which is difficult  to mimic with oral replacement therapy. 
The first drug of choice is oral hydrocortisone (HC).  Hydrocortisone was introduced as replacement 
therapy in  patients with  CAH in the 1950s.  The majority of existing marketed oral formulations of 
hydrocortisone are provided at doses of 10  mg and 20  mg and are designed to deliver “immediate-
release” of the  active ingredient. Given the  short plasma half-life of hydrocortisone, to achieve 
efficacious plasma levels of hydrocortisone throughout  the day multiple  daily dosing is required 
(typically 3 times a day). This treatment regimen provides supra-physiological levels of hydrocortisone 
within  1-2 hours of dosing, but this  results in high peak-to-trough fluctuations in  plasma 
concentrations. This 3-times daily dosing with  immediate-release hydrocortisone (IRHC) also results in 
abnormally low early morning cortisol levels before the first hydrocortisone dose is taken, which in 
turn,  due to  the lack of a negative feedback, causes high ACTH levels leading to high adrenal androgen 
levels in the morning.  
Alternative treatment  regimens involve giving a high dose of steroids before bedtime (reverse 
circadian), but  this is unphysiological, and some patients complain that  it affects their sleeping pattern. 
In addition, there is a greater risk of giving excess steroid doses as the patient still  needs steroid 
replacement during the day. It has been suggested that  a delayed (modified) release steroid, such as 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 11/79 
 
 
 
 
those used to treat ulcerative colitis, might  be useful in the  treatment of CAH. One such "modified-
release" formulation (Plenadren, Shire Pharmaceuticals Ltd.)  has been marketed in Europe for the 
separate indication of adrenal insufficiency (AI) in adults  only. However, Plenadren has an immediate 
and sustained release profile and is given once daily in the morning to replace daytime cortisol levels 
i.e. it does not mimic the physiological secretion of cortisol. In particular, it does not release 
hydrocortisone overnight, and therefore there are still  abnormally low morning cortisol levels and 
unrestrained ACTH secretion overnight, with resultant  high adrenal androgens in the  morning in 
patients with  CAH.  
According to the  Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline 1 (2018),  hydrocortisone should be 
administered at  a dose of 15  mg to 25 mg for adults and 10 mg/m2/day to  15 mg/m2/day in children, 
usually as 2 or 3 divided oral doses per day. Insufficient data exist to recommend fractional distribution 
of doses throughout  the day or empiric dosing in the  very early morning hours. However, the  usual 
practice is to  give the highest dose (50-66%)  in the morning at awakening, the next either in the early 
afternoon (2  hours after lunch and 6-8 hours after the morning dose if using a 2-dose regimen) or at 
lunch (4-6  hours after the first dose) and evening (4-6 hours after the second dose) for a 3-dose 
regimen. Decisions on dosing are based on regular assessments of weight (including  Body Mass Index, 
ie BMI), blood pressure, examination for Cushingoid features and, in growing adolescents, growth 
velocity and bone age estimation, in  addition to obtaining  biochemical measurements to assess the 
adequacy of the glucocorticoid replacement. The goal is to achieve the best clinical result with  the 
lowest possible daily dose of steroid.  
As an alternative to hydrocortisone, another synthetic longer-acting glucocorticoid, prednisone (which 
is converted to active prednisolone) at a dose of 4-7.5 mg/day can be used, administered orally once 
or twice daily. Prednisone/prednisolone/methylprednisolone are 4 to 5  times more potent than 
hydrocortisone and have a longer duration of action of around 12  hours and so are useful in patients 
who are not  compliant with  the 2 or 3  times daily dosing regimen of IRHC; however, they may be up to 
15 times more growth-suppressive. In patients with  salt-wasting, the  requirement for aldosterone may 
be greater when taking long-acting glucocorticoids, since hydrocortisone has a greater 
mineralocorticoid action than prednisolone and dexamethasone. This mineralocorticoid deficiency can 
be treated with  fludrocortisone. 
Dexamethasone, another long-acting glucocorticoid, is not usually recommended for the treatment  of 
CAH because of its potent growth-suppressive effect and the risk of Cushingoid side effects due to 
difficulties in dose titration.  If used, glucocorticoid replacement should be monitored using clinical 
assessments such as body weight, postural blood pressure, energy levels, and signs of glucocorticoid 
excess.  
However, the  longer-acting glucocorticoids have also been reported to  have greater catabolic activity 
on bone. Although there is no direct evidence that  longer-acting glucocorticoids behave differently to 
cortisol, the effects on bone are probably because these glucocorticoids are being used at 
inappropriately high doses. The longer biological half-life of prednisone/prednisolone is also likely to 
result in unfavourably high night-time  glucocorticoid activity, with  potentially detrimental effects on 
insulin sensitivity and bone mineral density, as well as disturbed sleep.  
In the only published survey to date, it was seen that  physicians used the different IRHC and 
long-acting glucocorticoids in equal proportions, confirming that  there is no consensus for treating 
adults. It remains to be seen whether the 2018  guidelines are taken up widely and help to rationalise 
the approach to  therapy. 
Thus, there is an unmet medical need for more physiological hydrocortisone replacement options that

allow for control of cortisol and androgen levels, without  exposing patients to unnecessarily high 
steroid doses. 
Mineralocorticoid use.  
All classic CAH patients should be treated with  fludrocortisone at diagnosis in the new-born period. 
Dosage requirements in early infancy range from 0.05–0.30  mg/d, whereas typical maintenance doses 
are 0.05–0.2  mg/d, depending on the sodium intake. Such therapy will reduce vasopressin and ACTH 
levels and lower the  dosage of glucocorticoid required. The need for continuing  mineralocorticoids 
should be assessed based on plasma renin activity (PRA) and BP. Sodium chloride supplements are 
often needed in infancy. 
The non-classic form of CAH is not  usually treated with  complete replacement therapy (only 
supplementation in stress situations).

The active compound in Efmody is hydrocortisone (HC).  HC is the synthetic form of cortisol. HC  is used 
to treat immune, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. It  was discovered in the 1930s  by Edward 
Kendall and named Compound F, or 17-hydroxycorticosterone. It is on the World Health Organization's 
List  of Essential Medicines and was granted FDA approval on 5 August 1952. 
Corticosteroids influence the functioning  of most of the  body's systems (heart, immune, muscles and 
bones, endocrine and nervous system). They exert a wide array of effects including  effects on the 
metabolism of carbohydrates, protein and fats. They help to maintain  the balance of fluids and 
electrolytes. 
Hydrocortisone is classified as a glucocorticosteroid (ATC code H02AB09; Glucocorticoids, 
hydrocortisone). 
Efmody is a modified-release formulation of hydrocortisone that  was designed to treat CAH more 
effectively. 
Efmody is claimed to present an optimal delivery of hydrocortisone with  a dosage form that  has a 
delayed-release and sustained absorption. With  this drug delivery modality, dosing the formulation at 
night  (and early in the morning) would lead to a profile of hydrocortisone levels more similar to 
endogenous daily cortisol rhythm (without  the necessary spikes in stress situations). 
The applicant initially developed Efmody using the  name Chronocort. This name may appear in  figures 
and tables and is the  previous name used for Efmody.

Figure 2: hydrocortisone structure 
Hydrocortisone exhibits stereoisomerism due to  the presence of 6 chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by specific optical rotation.   
Information on the  chemistry, manufacturing and control on hydrocortisone has been evaluated by the 
EDQM and a European Certificate of Suitability  of the Monograph of the  European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) 
has been issued. It was noticed that two  additional supplementary tests (Other impurities,  particle size 
and residual solvents) were included in the  CEP.  
Manufacture,  characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing process, process controls and active substance characterisation are covered by the 
EDQM Certificate of Suitability.  The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before 
issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
A valid QP declaration was provided by the QP of the proposed batch  release site , on the basis of an 
on-site audit of the manufacturing site carried out  by a third  party. The operations include the 
manufacture and micronisation of the active substance. 
The active substance is packed as stated on the  EDQM Certificate of suitability. 
The primary packaging used for hydrocortisone complies with  the current regulations contained in 
Ph.Eur. Monograph 3.1.3  (Polyolefins), -Ph.Eur. Monograph 3.2.2  (Plastic Containers and Closures for 
Pharmaceutical Use). 
Specification 
The active substance specification, , includes tests  for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
optical rotation (Ph.Eur.),  loss on drying (Ph.Eur.), impurities (HPLC),  residual solvents (GC), residual 
catalyst – chromium- (AAS) and particle size (light  diffraction).  
The specification of the active substance manufacturer has been assessed by the EDQM for the grant of 
the CEP. The active substance is compliant with  the Ph.Eur. monograph on hydrocortisone with 
additional tests for related substances  residual solvents, residual catalyst) and particle size 
distribution.  The specifications also comply with  ICH Q3A.

The active substance manufacturer conducts testing,  according to Ph. Eur. and therefore, no validation 
of the analytical methods has been provided. Full method validation data was provided for the  in-house 
analytical methods and are in  accordance with the relevant ICH Guidelines. 
Batch analysis data of the active substance were provided. The results are within  the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. The results of parallel testing of three active substance batches 
conducted by the finished product manufacturer are comparable. 
Stability 
Long-term stability  data at  25°C/60% RH  were presented for twenty-three batches covering up to 60 
months packaged in the proposed packaging. Stability data at 30°C/65%  RH were presented for 2 
batches covering up to 24 months.  The following parameters were tested: hydrocortisone assay dried 
basis, loss on drying and related substances. The active substance is stable, and no negative trends 
can be observed. The stability studies were performed according to  ICH guidelines.  
Hydrocortisone micronised was found to be photostable, there was no significant change in  visual 
appearance, colour in solution and potency. There were no impurities  at 0.10% or greater in the 
material exposed to light.  The photostability  study performed complies with ICH Q1B. The active 
substance is proved to be photostable.   
The stability results indicate that  the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability  results justify the proposed retest period and storage conditions in  the 
proposed container.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the  product and Pharmaceutical development 
Efmody is presented as modified release hard capsules filled with  a multiparticulate granule 
formulation of hydrocortisone.  
The dosage form is a hard gelatine capsule filled with white  to off-white  granules with  a modified 
release coating. They are filled into  capsules at different fill weights to produce three strengths  of the 
finished product 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg. The different strengths are sufficiently distinguished. 
The physical descriptions of the  finished product are: 
- for 5mg strength - Size 1 capsule with  opaque white  body and opaque blue cap printed with 
“CHC 5mg”  on the  body 
- for 10mg strength - Size 1 capsule with  opaque white  body and opaque green cap printed 
with  “CHC 10mg” on the  body 
- for 20mg strength - Size 0 capsule with  opaque white  body and opaque orange cap printed 
with  “CHC20mg”  on the  body. 
The composition of hydrocortisone granules and the  composition of modified release coating of 
granules per capsule is presented.  
No overage is included in  the final product. 
This is a hybrid product to Hydrocortone. Due to changes in pharmaceutical form and changes in 
strength bioequivalence cannot be demonstrated through  bioavailability studies.

The dosage form has been developed to imitate  the hydrocortisone circadian profile. A pharmaceutical 
form was developed to achieve the following target product profile:  
- An initial absence of release to allow transit through the  stomach  
- pH-triggered dissolution when the dosage form reaches the mid-distal region of the small intestine.  
- A sustained release phase (after the initial  delayed release period)  
- Oral route of administration  
- Accurate dosing at various dose strengths   
Micronised hydrocortisone crystal form is used in the finished product manufacture. The particle size 
and polymorphic form are controlled by the active substance manufacturer.  
All excipients are commonly used in  pharmaceutical preparations. The compatibility of the active 
substance with excipients was demonstrated by stability data. No novel excipients have been used. The 
excipients used within  the finished product were selected in order to provide a multi-particulate  dosage 
form that  would yield a lag and then  release the active substance at  a specific pH.  
The suitability of chosen excipients and capsule sizes for the target age group of adolescents aged 12 
to 18 years have been adequately discussed. The capsules should be swallowed whole and are not to 
be opened or chewed. The accuracy of dosing in the  target age group 12 to 18  years is ensured. 
Excipients were chosen as both  exhibit pH dependent dissolution, with  the pH  solubility threshold . The 
plasticizer and glidant  chosen was DiButyl Sebacate (DBS) in combination with  Talc. The choice of 
excipients and levels therein was as suggested by the enteric polymer manufacturer to enable the 
production of robust and dense film coats.  
The most optimal ratio of excipients was selected to yield a dissolution  at a specific pH . A total  weight 
gain in relation to the Hydrocortisone coated microcrystalline spheres was selected on the basis that it 
had provided good reproducibility in dissolution performance. 
The lead formulation was chosen based on the selection of desired in vitro dissolution profiles of 
prototype formulations  which  were then used in pilot  clinical evaluations in human volunteers. The 
granule formulation utilised  in all late stage clinical studies and stability  programs, and intended for 
commercial production, has remained unchanged. 
Comparison of dissolution profiles of each dose strength of hydrocortisone modified release capsules in 
pH media and under the  QC test  method conditions demonstrated their similarity.  
The QC dissolution  test complies with  Ph. Eur. 2.9.3  (apparatus 1,  basket, rotation speed 100 rpm). 
The specification of the dissolution  test includes points: to demonstrate resistance of the modified 
release coating to release in the fed stomach; and to ensure that majority of active substance has 
been released.  
The QC dissolution  test method was proved to be robust to changes in dissolution  media volume and 
stirring rate. The test method is able to  discriminate between batches with  different coating levels. 
The impact of gastric conditions has been evaluated in vitro in two studies. Pharmacokinetic data 
indicate that absorption of hydrocortisone is delayed when given shortly after food; however, this is 
not considered to be clinically significant. 
The impact of alcohol consumption on the modified release characteristics and the probability of dose 
dumping was also investigated in an in vitro study. No  significant drug release was observed prior to 
the final pH  change media at various alcohol concentrations. It was concluded that the  delayed release 
coating provides robust enteric performance without resulting in  premature coat dissolution or 
affecting the downstream release of hydrocortisone in the presence of typical alcohol consumption 
levels.

To achieve modified release of hydrocortisone to  produce a common multiparticulate  granule 
formulation. The process involves layering steps. The granules are filled into the individual hard 
capsules at different fill weights  to produce the different dose strengths.   
The first batches for clinical studies were manufactured at small scale and then transferred to a new 
manufacturing site where the process was scaled up and optimized . An evaluation of the 
manufacturing process parameters that may affect the finished product quality attributes,  the potential 
failure mechanism and the actions taken to  address the risk for each step of manufacturing process 
were discussed. The CQA were identified. A ‘side by side’ comparison of the small-scale manufacturing 
process parameters and of commercial scale process parameters for the  production stages have been 
presented. 
The proposed primary packaging for all strengths  of the  finished product is an opaque HDPE (High 
Density Polyethylene) bottle,  closed with  a child-resistant, tamper-evident PP screw cap with 
integrated desiccant. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability  data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the  product. The HDPE bottle  and PP screw cap were well 
characterised and compliance with  Commission Regulation (EU) No  10/2011  has been declared. The 
resins used in bottle  and closure meet the  Ph. Eur. monographs requirements. The desiccant is 
declared to be in compliance with  Regulation (EC) 1935/2004  and EU regulation 10/2011.  The PP 
closure is certified child resistant, according to ISO 8317 (2015). 
Manufacture  of the  product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: preparation of hydrocortisone coated granules, 
preparation of modified release coated granules, encapsulation and bulk packaging and primary 
packaging. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
The final theoretical batch  size for hydrocortisone modified release bulk granules is presented.  
The stability study to support the proposed holding times for intermediates was carried out under 
20°C ± 5°C/<85% RH. Very little change was observed in all testing parameters across all 
intermediates and the bulk product. Holding  times for hydrocortisone coated granules, hydrocortisone 
modified release granules and bulk hydrocortisone modified release capsules have been declared and 
accepted. The shelf life is calculated according to  the Note for guidance on the manufacture of the 
finished dosage form. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner.  
A comprehensive process validation conducted on three batches of a common blend of the  finished 
product has been performed at the proposed commercial manufacturing scale. In terms of the 
Guideline on process validation for finished products –  a manufacture of modified release preparations 
is a non-standard process. However, the Applicant designated the manufacture of the proposed 
product as a standard process, and this was appropriately justified based on previous experience with 
the same manufacturing principle, and therefore this  was accepted. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
appearance, identity (HPLC/UV),  assay (HPLC), uniformity (HPLC),  dissolution (HPLC),  purity (GC) and 
microbiology.

The proposed specification parameters and limits are adequately set in line with  ICH Q6A and are 
generally acceptable for this type of dosage form. 
Risk assessment for elemental impurities  according to ICH Q3D is acceptable as presented in the 
dossier. The risk assessment involved following  potential sources of elemental impurities, excipients, 
capsule shells, container closure system, and manufacturing process and equipment. The calculated 
potential total  daily exposure from the Class 1 and 2A elemental impurities in  the finished product at a 
maximal dose of 40  mg/day are all well below the alert threshold of 30%  of the oral PDE. There is no 
risk of elemental impurity contamination from either the container closure system or the 
manufacturing process. No additional controls are required to be applied for the finished product.   
During the assessment a major objection was raised on the  nitrosamines; the  company provided a risk 
assessment regarding the  presence of nitrosamine that was incomplete. A risk evaluation concerning 
the presence of nitrosamine impurities in  the finished product has been performed considering all 
suspected and actual root causes in line with  the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation 
holders/applicants on the  CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  referral on 
nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020)  and the “Assessment report- 
Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004-  Nitrosamine impurities in human 
medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). 
With  regards to primary packaging (a HDPE bottle with  PP cap with  desiccant), only absence of 
nitrosamines in the manufacture of PP cap is confirmed by its supplier  It is acknowledged that  an 
updated documentation for HDPE bottle by its supplier to confirm the absence of nitrosamines is 
awaited by company and the  finished product risk assessment will be provided following the  receipt of 
the updated conformance documentation by the bottle supplier. No risk is expected as the bottling 
process is not a heat-based process and formation of nitrosamines is likely during printing  of the 
blister´s lidding foils, not  HDPE bottles. 
However, as the risk evaluation report remains incomplete, this was raised as a recommendation. The 
information about packaging process and container closure system (HDPE bottle  with  PP screw cap) 
should be included in the evaluation report for nitrosamines (Recommendation(s) for future quality 
development). 
The test methods and the specification limits for the following tests are referenced to the Ph.Eur. 
monographs: uniformity of dosage units  (limit based on Ph.Eur. 2.9.40)  and microbiological testing 
(2.6.12,  2.6.13).  The proposed limits for residual solvents are in line with  ICH Q3C and the limits  for 
impurities are set in line with  ICH Q3B (R2) and Ph. Eur. Monograph for Hydrocortisone 0335. 
All analytical methods were described in detail. In-house methods were developed for identification, 
uniformity of dosage units,  assay, impurities, residual solvents and dissolution. 
Results from method validation were presented in tabulated form for in-house methods. Validation of 
in-house analytical methods is in line with  ICH guideline Q2 (R1). Representative chromatograms have 
been included. 
Forced degradation study for this HPLC method was performed, and the assay results were presented, 
including the  results of individual impurities and mass balance data. Assay and related substances 
were shown to  be stability  indicating. 
The Primary Reference Standard used by the finished product manufacturer for quantitative analysis 
(as described for assay, content  uniformity and dissolution  testing of the capsules) is the  Ph. Eur. 
Hydrocortisone Certified Reference Standard (CRS) or an active substance batch which has been 
certified as a working reference standard against the Ph. Eur. Hydrocortisone CRS reference standard.

Analytical results of commercial-scale batches  are in compliance with  specification proposed and 
confirm consistency and uniformity of finished product. 
Stability of the product 
The stability studies were conducted with  a bracketing approach on three production scale batches of 
5 mg and 20 mg strengths and one production scale batch of 10 mg of the finished product under long-
term conditions of 30°C/75% RH and accelerated conditions of 40°C/75% RH.  The bracketing approach 
is justified since the different dose strengths are manufactured from a common granulate filled at 
different weights to produce the required strength. The deviation in the long-term storage conditions 
(30°C/75% RH instead of standard 30°C/65%  RH) is in line with the Explanatory Note on the 
Withdrawal of ICH Q1F (CPMP/ICH/421/02). The testing frequency in stability studies is in line with ICH 
Q1A. Stability batches were tested for appearance, assay, purity, dissolution and microbiology 
(annually). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
Real-time data for the finished product stored 30°C/75% RH covering 24 months are available. The 
proposed product was shown to be stable when stored in the proposed container. At accelerated storage 
conditions 40°C/75% RH, all three strengths were shown to be stable for up to 6 months when stored in 
the proposed container. No out  of specification results were reported, and extrapolation of up to 12 
months is accepted.  
Photostability testing  was conducted under ICH Q1B conditions on one batch of each strength. The 
results of the samples packed in the HDPE bottle remained largely unchanged. It is concluded that the 
product is photostable. 
An in-use stability study has been performed on one batch of 5 mg and one batch of 20 mg dose 
strength capsules stored in the proposed packaging and stored at 25°C/60%  RH. The study was 
designed to simulate routine use and samples were tested for appearance, assay, purity, dissolution and 
microbiology. The data after storage for 30 and 60 days show that all results are within  specification and 
no trends in data were observed. As no relevant deterioration was observed in long-term, accelerated 
and in-use stability studies, there is no need to claim in-use shelf life as outlined in the Quality of 
medicines Q&A Part 2.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years and storage conditions “Store in  the 
original package. Keep the bottle tightly  closed in  order to protect from moisture. This medicinal 
product does not  require any special temperature storage conditions.”,  as stated in the SmPC (section 
6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
TSE/BSE certificates for the  active substance and all the  excipients are provided. This is considered to 
be adequate. The gelatine used in  the hard capsules is of animal origin and is obtained from suppliers 
who are holders of valid TSE CEP certificates. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn  lead to the  conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. A Major Objection on 
the risk of nitrosamines was raised during the assessment that  has been practically resolved. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 20/79 
 
 
 
 
At the time of the CHMP  opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to  nitrosamines. This point  is put  forward and agreed 
as a recommendation for future quality development. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
The CHMP has identified the following measures necessary to address the identified quality 
developments issues that  may have a potential  impact on the safe and effective use of the  medicinal 
product: 
- An incomplete risk evaluation report was submitted. The information about packaging process and 
container closure system (HDPE bottle  with  PP screw cap) should be included in the risk evaluation 
report for nitrosamines. No risk is expected as the bottling  process is not a heat-based process and 
formation of nitrosamines is likely during printing  of the blister´s lidding foils, not HDPE bottles. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs  to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP  recommends the following points for investigation: 
•  The applicant is requested to provide missing parts of a risk evaluation for potential formation of 
nitrosamines, i.e. an evaluation of the packaging process together with  the container closure system 
(HDPE bottle  with PP screw cap with  desiccant). 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date  and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to  generate additional non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology data. The non-clinical  aspects of 
the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) are in  line with the  SmPC of the reference product.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that  no further non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies are 
required. The applicant submitted  new non-clinical pharmacokinetics data to  support the modified-
release formulation of the product,  intended to treat CAH more effectively. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Two non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies in dexamethasone-suppressed beagle dogs have been 
performed in which five early development formulations of Efmody were evaluated and (in one study) 
compared with  an immediate release product. Exposure following administration of 30 mg is shown in 
Figure 2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 21/79 
 
 
 
 
Figure  3 Comparison of exposure following oral administration of 30 mg  of 5 different  early 
development  formulations  of  Efmody  (DIURF-000-006)  and  an  immediate  release  product 
(IR).  Note:  Results of  study S34516  (IR,  DIURF-000  and DIURF-002)  and  study  S35326  (DIURF-004, 
DIURF-005  and DIURF-006)  are plotted in  a single graph. In both studies, the same dogs were used. 
According to the  clinical overview, in healthy volunteer studies in which the subjects received 
dexamethasone to suppress endogenous cortisol production, formulation DIURF-006 provided the 
highest cortisol levels and increased exposure compared to the  other formulations and showed the 
closest match to the cortisol profile in healthy humans. Therefore, this formulation was selected as the 
final Efmody formulation. 
2.3.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant conducted a Persistence-Bioaccumulation-Toxicity (PBT) screening/assessment and a 
Phase I ERA calculation on the  basis of a refined market penetration factor (Fpen) value based on the 
prevalence of CAH. 
According to the  applicant, the bioaccumulation potential (log Kow) is below 4.5. The Predicted 
Environmental Concentration in surface water (PECsw) is below the  trigger value of 0.01.  In addition, 
literature data indicate that hydrocortisone is readily biodegradable. The applicant concluded that  the 
absence of tailored Phase II ERA with further studies could be justified. However the CHMP  could not 
accept the published reference to support the ERA. 
Therefore the CHMP, in the  context of the  obligation of the MAH to  take due account of technical and 
scientific progress, the CHMP  recommends the following points to be addressed post-authorisation: 
- To provide a test on ready biodegradability. In case that  hydrocortisone is readily biodegradable the 
tailored ERA can stop; 
- To provide the study protocol or literature of the log Kow data. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Hydrocortisone is a well-known and widely used substance. Therefore no non-clinical studies are 
submitted,  except for two non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies in dexamethasone-suppressed beagle 
dogs; instead reference is made to published literature to  demonstrate adequate non-clinical safety. 
This is considered sufficient by the CHMP. The conducted pharmacokinetic studies in beagle dogs in 
which five early development formulations of Efmody were evaluated and compared with  an immediate 
release product, support (together with  the results of the  clinical studies)  the choice for formulation

DIURF-006. 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical aspects of Efmody have been adequately documented and meet the 
requirements to support this  application.  
In order to conclude on the environmental risk of Efmody, the CHMP recommended the applicant to 
address the remaining issues in the  context of their obligation  to take due account of technical and 
scientific progress. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement  to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out  in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic data were obtained in studies DIUR-002, DIUR-004 and DIUR-008, including  healthy 
adult volunteers and in  study DIUR-003, including adult  patients with  CAH. For the analysis of cortisol 
in human serum, a LC-MS/MS  assay was applied. The method proved to be sensitive and robust for 
analysis of cortisol in serum. Cortisol stability in  serum during sample handling  was shown.  Validation 
results showed acceptable performance within the normal standard criteria. Incurred sample reanalysis 
also showed good reproducibility. 
The applicant used pharmacokinetics for bridging to the marketed immediate-release tablet. Efmody 
needed to show a similar total exposure (AUC) of the  active substance hydrocortisone as for the 
immediate release hydrocortisone formulation, without  requirement for bioequivalence. 
A population based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model for Efmody was developed in adults  and then 
verified using data from studies  in adults (single-dose studies DIUR-004 and DIUR-008 and the 
multiple-dose study DIUR-003). Studies DIUR-003 and DIUR-004 were used for model development 
and verification in this  study, and the model was further verified using data from DIUR-008.  The adult 
PBPK model was applied to predict the paediatric pharmacokinetics of Efmody. The adult healthy 
volunteer population  and the  paediatric population were used for the adult and paediatric simulations. 
The PBPK model was developed from a previous PBPK model for Infacort (Alkindi immediate release 
granules) from the same Applicant (EMEA/H/C/004416/0000).   
Absorption  
The aim of the modified release formulation with  dosing at night  or at night and early in the  morning is 
to obtain a timely delay and elevation of the hydrocortisone levels following the  endogenous profile for 
cortisol. The formulation that  provided the best-fit  to the reference endogenous cortisol profile and the 
projected doses required to provide an optimal 24-hour cortisol coverage based on cortisol normative 
data (published dataset of endogenous serum cortisol profile over a 24 hr period) appeared to be 
formulation Efmody 30  mg DIURF-006. This formulation was selected as the clinical trial formulation. 
After administration of Efmody, serum cortisol tmax was observed later (0.88h  vs 4.5h),  Cmax was 
17% lower and AUC 19% was higher compared to  a 20  mg immediate-release formulation (Auden 
McKenzie),  the reference product, showing  the delayed-release properties of Efmody (study DIUR-
004).   
The inter-subject variability in Cmax and AUC was about 20 – 30%,  and the intra-subject variability 
has not been evaluated. 
30 mg Efmody administered as one 20  mg capsule in the evening (23.00 hr) and one 10 mg capsule in 
the morning (7.00  hr) resulted in about  25% higher exposure compared with a single 30 mg dose 
(study DIUR-002). When indirectly compared to immediate release hydrocortisone (30 mg, study 
DIUR-001) data, the 20  mg and 10  mg Efmody administration showed a greater bioavailability than IR 
30 mg (AUC 16% higher) and a lower Cmax (42% lower). The 20 mg and 10 mg Efmody 
administration resulted in a more physiological serum cortisol peak in  the morning and sustained 
cortisol exposure over the day. 
In patients, administration  of Efmody 20 mg at 23.00  hr and 10  mg at 7.00 hr, resulted in a tmax 
around 5.00 hr in the morning and a second tmax at 10.00hr  – 11.00 hr in the  morning. In between a 
trough is reached at about 8.00  hr. The cortisol profiles after dose titration  according to androgen 
levels indicate that  the cortisol profiles at month  2, 4 and 6 were comparable to the pharmacokinetic 
profile after 2 days. Furthermore, a comparable serum cortisol exposure profile is observed compared

to the physiological circadian rhythm of cortisol observed in healthy dexamethasone-suppressed 
volunteers and a healthy reference population. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
A less than dose-proportional increase in AUC and Cmax is observed over the dose range of 5 –  30 mg 
as Efmody capsules. It should be noted that  the 30 mg dose was not  administered as one dose but as 
a divided dose of 20  and 10  mg with an 8 h interval. Still,  over the 5 – 20 mg dose range, a less than 
dose-proportional increase in AUC and Cmax is observed. However the increase in serum cortisol 
concentration was linear over the dose-range 5 mg to 30  mg, but the proportionality constant as 
reflected by a slope for Cmax of 0.486  (95%  CI:0.418, 0.555),  AUC0-t of 0.692  (95% CI: 0.651, 
0.733)  and AUC0-inf of 0.668  (95%  CI: 0.625,0.711),  was not unity. 
No unexpected accumulation is observed after applying the SmPC recommended dose scheme. Steady-
state was estimated to be reached after 1 – 2  doses, with  a low accumulation ratio (Cmin levels at the 
end of the dosing interval (i.e. at 23.00  hr) were less than about 2%  of the Cmax levels). 
Special populations 
The model predicted the AUC after a single 20 mg dose under fasting and fed conditions well, with 
simulated values within  12% of observed values. However, Cmax values were under-predicted, with 31 
and 25% lower simulated value vs. observed values after fasting and fed conditions,  respectively.  
A comparable simulated vs. observed food effect was observed, although the  simulated food effect on 
tmax was considered less pronounced that  the observed effect (1.08  fold vs. 1.51-fold). 
Model verification with  study DIUR-008 (single 20 mg dose, fast) showed a similar pattern, i.e. under-
predication of Cmax (-22%), a comparable AUC and an earlier tmax (0.77-fold). 
Although after a single-dose the Cmax was under-predicted, after multiple  dosing (study DIUR-003) in 
which 20  mg was given at 23.00h,  and 10 mg at 7.00h,  simulated mean AUC and Cmax values were 
within  1.1-fold of the observed values.  
Of note, data were used from study DIUR-003, which  included CAH patients, while the simulation 
included a healthy population  group. Although the included CAH patients were in general good health 
conditions, they were on glucocorticoid replacement therapy prior to the start  of the  study, including 
dexamethasone which is known to be a CYP3A4 inducer, which could had an effect on CYP3A4 cortisol 
metabolism. Doses used in the  model application simulations were calculated using the  body weights 
and body surface areas of the adult subjects in study DIUR-003. For the  body weight-based 
simulations, the administered doses of 20 mg and 10 mg were divided by the individual body weights 
of study subjects, resulting in mean body weight-based doses of 0.3 and 0.15 mg/kg, respectively. 
Similarly, the doses of 20  mg and 10  mg were divided by each individual's body surface area (BSA 
calculated using the DuBois formula) to obtain BSA-based doses 11.6 and 5.8  mg/m2, respectively. 
For single-dose, following  body weight-based dosing of 0.3 mg/kg, mean Cmax, tmax, and AUC in 
paediatrics were within  5% of adult values. Following  a body surface area-based dosing of 11.6 
mg/m2, mean Cmax, tmax, and AUC in  paediatrics were within  15%  of adult  values. 
For the divided dose, i.e. 0.3  mg/kg in the  evening (23.00h)  and 0.15 mg/kg the following morning 
(7.00h),  mean Cmax and AUC at day 3 in paediatrics were within  8% of adult values. Following  a body 
surface area-based dosing of 11.6  mg/m2 and 5.8  mg/m2, respectively, mean Cmax, tmax, and AUC 
at day 3 in paediatrics were within  5%  of adult  values.

It should be noted that  the quality of the simulations is not considered adequate for making claims on 
the exposure in the adolescent population. However, the impact  of the PBPK model results is low due 
to the titration  guided dosing.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
A high-fat breakfast delayed tmax of serum cortisol levels with about  2 h (from 4.5h  to 6.75h), 
resulting in a 22% lower Cmax and no statistically significant  effect on AUCinf (+10%).  A comparable 
pattern was observed for free cortisol levels, with  a 33% lower Cmax and 3% lower AUCinf. The lower 
free cortisol levels reflect the  plasma protein binding of cortisol. 
To minimise the  food effect, and in line with  the applied phase 3 dosing recommendations, the morning 
dose should be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before a meal and the evening dose taken 
at bedtime at least 2 hours after the  last meal of the day. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application. 
Study DIUR-003 was designed to examine the disease biomarker response to treatment both  in the 
short-term (after 2 days dosing), and after 6 months of treatment in order to inform on the dose and 
study design for the  subsequent phase 3 study inform on the study design and dosing regimen of the 
phase III studies. The methodology and results of this  study are presented at the  beginning of section 
2.4.4.   
2.4.4.  Clinical efficacy  
No formal dose-finding study was performed for Efmody. The starting dose, titration  regimen and 
dosing regimen tested in the  phase III studies was based on phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and 
a phase 2 PK/PD study (DIUR-003). 
Study DIUR-003 was a Phase 2 pilot, single cohort, multiple-dose, open-label study in 16  patients aged 
≥18 years with  CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (classic CAH) based on hormonal and genetic 
testing  currently treated with  hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone or dexamethasone on a stable 
dosage for a minimum  of 3 months.   
In Part A, the baseline disease control status of patients on standard therapy was assessed by 
biochemical measurement of androgenic precursor levels. Patients started on Efmody therapy at a 
30 mg fixed daily dose (administered as 20 mg at 23:00  hours and 10 mg at 07:00  hours) and, after 
2 days, cortisol PK parameters were measured, and disease control (androgenic precursor levels) were 
compared with  baseline levels.  
In Part B, patients  entered a 6-month dose-titration  period to assess the  efficacy of Efmody treatment 
through measurement of biochemical markers, body composition, insulin  resistance and bone turnover. 
Formal dose titration  occurred at the start  of Part B, and was adjusted as necessary at the 2-month 
and 4-month CRC visits. Dose adjustments were considered to  a maximum daily dose of 50mg  if 3 or 
more of the 5 sample times showed out  of range values for 17-OHP  and androstenedione. 
The main secondary efficacy pharmacodynamic endpoint was to  examine the proportion of subjects 
with  (17-OHP) and A4 levels within  proposed optimal ranges whilst  on Efmody and whilst  on standard 
therapy at  baseline. For 17-OHP the  normal range was defined as 30-300  ng/dl  (1-9 nmol/l), and the 
Assessment report

Page 30/79 
 
 
 
 
optimal range was defined as the  upper limit  of normal to 4 times the upper limit  of normal 300-1200 
ng/dl (9-36  nmol/). For androstenedione the optimal  range was defined as the same as the normal 
range 40-150  ng/dl (1.4-5.2  nmol/l)  for males and 30-200  ng/dl (1.0-7.0  nmol/l)  for females. 
Figure 4 Study design DIUR-003 . Note:  Efmody was previously known as Chronocort 
In study DIUR-003, 8 males and 8 females were enrolled. In the males, the  mean age was 33.3  (range 
of 18-60)  years, the mean weight  was 67.24  (range of 50.6-88.4)  kg, and the mean BMI was 24.44 
(range of 19.5-29.5)  kg/m2. In the females, the  mean age was 24.1  (range of 18-40)  years, the mean 
weight  was 72.35  (range of 46.4-115)  kg, and the mean BMI was 27.26  (range of 20.5-41.1)  kg/m2. 
The proportion of subjects in DIUR-003 on the different glucocorticoid medications were similar to 
those reported in large cohort studies from the UK and USA, where in approximately a third of subjects 
are treated with  either dexamethasone, or prednisolone/prednisone, or hydrocortisone. 
Results from part B (dose titration,  ACTH profiles, androgen control) are presented below in Table 5 
and Figure 6, Figure 7,and Figure  8.

On standard treatment, ACTH levels were observed to rise from 0300h,  reaching a plateau from 0700h 
to 1300h,  before declining after 1700h. On Efmody, ACTH levels did not rise at 0300h and were stable 
and notably lower than  those on standard treatment through  the day. See Figure 6.

Study DIUR-005 
The pivotal phase III study was a multicentre, open-label, randomized, controlled trial to  assess the 
efficacy and safety of Efmody in patients  with CAH.   
Methods 
As part of the baseline assessment, participants were admitted  overnight for a 24-hour endocrine 
profile while  remaining on their standard glucocorticoid (GC) therapy, with  17-OHP and A4 samples

and 15:00. 
24-hour hormone profiles were determined after 4 and 12 weeks of intervention after which dose 
titration  was possible guided by an independent physician.  
After 6 months of treatment, all the baseline tests  were repeated (including  the 24-hour androgen 
profile). Participants could then  either return to  their standard GC therapy or enter an open-label 
extension study (DIUR-006)  and receive Efmody on an ongoing basis. 
Figure 8 Study design DIUR-005. Note:  Efmody is formely known  as Chronocort. 
Patients were recruited in 11 study sites in 7  countries: Denmark (n=1),  France (n=2),  Germany 
(n=1),  the Netherlands (n=1),  Sweden (n=1),  the UK (n=4),  and the US (n= 1).  
Main inclusion  criteria were: known CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (classic CAH) diagnosed in 
childhood with  documented (at  any time) elevated 17-OHP  and/or A4 and treated at entry into the 
study with  hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone or dexamethasone (or a combination of the 
aforementioned GCs) on a stable GC therapy for a minimum of 6 months; Male or female participants 
aged 18  and above.

Main exclusion criteria were: co-morbid condition requiring daily administration of a medication (or 
consumption of any material) that  interfered with  the metabolism of GCs; clinical or biochemical 
evidence of hepatic or renal disease; participants on regular daily inhaled, topical, nasal or oral 
steroids for any indication other than CAH; participants with  a history of bilateral adrenalectomy; 
participants having previously been exposed to Efmody; participants who routinely worked night  shifts 
and so do not  sleep during the usual night-time  hours. 
Treatments 
Investigational medicinal products:  
• 
Efmody (hydrocortisone modified release capsule) supplied in 3 unit  dose strengths  of 5 mg, 
10 mg and 20 mg per capsule. Oral administration. The starting dose for each participant  was 
the hydrocortisone equivalent of their  previous GC therapy dose with  the hydrocortisone dose 
calculated as prednisone dose multiplied by 5 and dexamethasone dose multiplied by 80 (up to 
a maximum starting  dose of Efmody 30 mg, split  as 20  mg at night and 10  mg in  the 
morning). Efmody was taken at 23:00  hr (approximately 2/3rd of the  total daily dose) and 
07:00  hr (approximately 1/3rd of the total  daily dose).  
• 
The standard GC therapy that  the participant  was receiving prior to the study was used for 
participants randomised to the  comparator group. The starting  dose for each participant was 
the same as that  used prior to the study.  
Dose refinements/titrations could be conducted in both treatment  groups as necessary after 4 weeks 
and 12 weeks after the participant had been re-admitted for further 24-hour 17-OHP  and A4 profiles. 
The decision to change the dose in both treatment groups was made by 2 independent blinded 
physicians, who  were blinded to the treatment  group and made their decision based on the  Adrenal 
Insufficiency Checklist which was completed by the local Investigator (who was blinded to the 
androgen results) and captured clinical signs and symptoms of under- or over-treatment, and the 17-
OHP and A4 results from the 24-hour endocrine profiles. The 5 androgen samples taken between 
01:00  and 09:00 from the 24-hour profile reflected the GC doses taken in the  evening and the 5 
samples taken between 11:00 hr and 19:00  hr reflected the morning GC doses. Dose adjustments 
were to  be considered if 3 or more of the 5 samples showed out of range values for 17-OHP  or A4. 
Where 17-OHP  and A4 show inconsistent  trends, the A4 parameter took precedence in directing dose 
adjustment. 
Fludrocortisone dose adjustment was allowed if medically indicated and was based on BP 
measurements and laboratory data (goal supine PRA above the  lower limit  and <1.5 times upper limit 
of normal [ULN]) 
Non-Investigational Products 
If the participant suffered an intercurrent illness or there were other reasons that  additional GCs were 
needed, the 'sick day rules' provided by the study site were to be followed. Fludrocortisone dose 
adjustment was allowed if medically indicated and was to  be based on BP measurements and 
laboratory data (goal supine PRA above the lower limit  and <1.5 times ULN.   
Participants were to  continue to take Efmody twice daily or standard GC therapy at their usual dosing 
regimen when taking stress doses. Any additional doses of hydrocortisone needed were only to be 
taken from the safety pack and should not have been taken from the study medication pack.

Objective 
To demonstrate the superior efficacy of Efmody compared with standard GC replacement therapy in 
the treatment of CAH based on 17-OHP.   
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to 24  weeks of the  mean of the 24-hour 
standard deviation score (SDS) profile for 17-OHP.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints were: change from baseline to 24  weeks of the  mean of the 24-hour SDS 
profile for A4 (calculated in  the same way as the primary endpoint);  17-OHP and A4 by individual 
baseline treatment  strata presented in the same manner as the  primary endpoint (using 24-hour SDS 
profile at  24 weeks); 17-OHP  and A4 levels at 09:00  hr as a responder analysis (i.e. the number of 
participants achieving results in  the optimal range).; Changes relative to standard GC replacement 
therapy in  body composition (DEXA) (fat mass, lean mass and total bone density) - measured at all 
sites except Germany. 
Main exploratory endpoints were: partial area under the curve (AUC) of 17-OHP  at 15:00 hr-23:00  hr , 
23:00  hr-07:00 hr, and 07:00  hr-15:00h  r (all refer to  actual clock time of sampling); changes relative 
to standard GC therapy in bone markers - serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) and osteocalcin (after 
fasting) and Quality of Life (QoL) using 36-item  Short Form Health  Survey (SF-36), Multidimensional 
Assessment of Fatigue (MAF),  and 5 Level Standardised Health Questionnaire (EQ-5D); use of GCs at 
the beginning and end of the study, presented both  as individual GCs used and as calculated 
hydrocortisone equivalents using  accepted conversion constants for the  calculations.  
Sample size 
A sample size of 102  subjects provides greater than  95% power and 2-sided alpha 5% to demonstrate 
a fall in the logarithm of the mean daily unsigned standard deviation score of 17-OHP relative to the 
standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy group.  
Randomisation 
There was a fully stratified randomisation of participants using an Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS). Stratification was based on participants’ current treatment at the  time of entering the  study: 
hydrocortisone only; prednisone or prednisolone, alone or in combination with  hydrocortisone; 
dexamethasone, alone or in combination with  any other GC. 
Blinding (masking) 
Since this  was an open label study, no blinding was performed. However, the decision to change the 
dose in  both treatment groups was made by independent blinded physician.  
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy variable was the natural logarithm of the mean of the 24-hour hormonal profile of 
the SDS for the natural logarithm of 17-OHP. The primary analysis focused on the  change from 
baseline to Week 24 in the primary efficacy variable. The SDS was defined as the absolute (unsigned) 
number of SDs above or below the average of the lower and upper limit  of normal using the  reference 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 36/79 
 
 
 
 
range for 17-OHP and A4 (see Table 6). The comparison between treatment groups was performed 
using an ANCOVA linear model, with  the unadjusted mean of the  primary efficacy variable being 
presented, along with  the least-square (LS) estimated mean. The difference in LS means was 
presented with  the associated 95%  2-sided CI and p-value. Residual plots of scaled residuals were 
used to check the fit  of the  model and assess whether there was any evidence of non-normality. 
Summary statistics were produced for the absolute values and change from baseline at each visit 
(Weeks 4, 12  and 24)  for the  primary efficacy variable by treatment group and pre-baseline therapy 
strata. The geometric mean of the  17-OHP concentration was plotted along with  the 95% CIs at each 
timepoint  over the 24-hour sampling period (15:00  hr to 15:00  hr) for each treatment group and by 
pre-baseline therapy strata. 
The primary analysis was repeated for A4, change from baseline to  Week 24 in the secondary efficacy 
variable. A responder analysis was also conducted to compare the response between the Efmody group 
and the standard GC therapy group within  the  efficacy evaluable analysis set using  logistic regression 
with  adjustment for pre-baseline therapy strata. A participant was considered a responder if their 
09:00  hr result at Week 24 was in the optimal and reference ranges as defined in Table 6.  The mean 
change from baseline to 24  weeks in body composition (DEXA) between the  Efmody group and the 
standard GC therapy group was compared separately for fat mass, lean mass and total bone density 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) linear model. Summary statistics were produced for the 
absolute values and change from baseline in body composition (DEXA) at each visit (Weeks 4, 12 and 
24).

*There  is no lower reference range  available for 17-OHP, hence  the lower limit of the optimal range was used in the 
derivation of the average SDS score. This enabled  calculation of an ‘unsigned’  SDS score  which was  used  to assess 
potential over-treatment as  well as under-treatment.  Note the Mayo  Clinic laboratory  reference ranges  for 17-OHP 
were derived from a very small number of volunteers, who did not have CAH and for whom nothing  else was known, 
e.g.  time  of  day,  co-morbidities.  The  appropriateness  of  trying  to  drive  the  CAH  population  into  this  range  is 
questionable and therefore based on verbal feedback from clinicians who manage these patients, a broader "optimal 
range" has been used for 17-OHP. 
Uncontrolled subjects were defined as those with  at least one 17-OHP  measurement in the baseline 
24h profile, which exceeds the normal range.  
Missing 17-OHP  and A4 values (including those considered missing due to being taken outside the 
permitted time window)  within  the 24-hour hormone profile were imputed  by linear interpolation of the 
two closest non-missing measurements to the scheduled missing timepoint (including  out-of-window 
measurements). In the event that several values were missing from a single profile, a decision was 
made about the  validity of the whole profile at the Data Review Meeting on a case-by-case basis. 
For efficacy analyses based on the Week 12 and Week 24  visits, participants who had withdrawn from 
the study were assessed on the basis of the latest available 24-hour profile. When calculations had to 
be based upon incomplete dates, the following process was used. If the year was missing, no imputing 
was conducted, and the value was considered missing. If the  year was populated but  both month and 
day were missing, then the date defaulted to 1st July.  If day only was missing, then the  day defaulted 
to the 15th  of the month. 
There was no adjustment for multiple testing.

Following  a review of the pre-defined analyses results and the apparent discrepancy between 17-OHP 
SDS results and absolute values, the previous EMA scientific advice was revisited and a number of 
post-hoc analyses advised in the 2014  were conducted on the primary endpoint as follows: 2-sided 
SDS score using difference from top  of the  range for high values and bottom of the range for low 
values with  all values in the range scoring 0;1-sided SDS score for high values using only the lower 
boundary of the reference range; 1-sided SDS score for low values using only the  upper boundary of 
the reference range. For each of the 1-sided analyses, which are anchored on the boundary of the 
reference range, an SDS above 4 represents a value outside the reference range.  
Additional analyses were also conducted for: unsigned SDS score from the upper limit  of the reference 
range; unsigned SDS score from the lower limit of the reference range; responders using the reference 
range for 17-OHP and log-transformed AUCs for 17-OHP and A4.

The primary efficacy analysis was repeated using  8-hour profiles rather than the 24-hour Profiles. This 
analysis showed a difference between the 2  treatment groups in  the 07:00 to  15:00 hour profile 
(difference in LS means: -0.286;  95%  CI: [-0.564,  -0.008];  p=0.0442)  but  not in the  other 8-hour 
periods. No  notable differences were seen between the treatment groups in the analysis of the 8-hour 
profiles based on prior GC therapy (hydrocortisone only, prednisone or prednisolone alone or in 
combination with  hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone alone or in combination with  any other GC).

The partial profile was the natural logarithm of the mean of the 8-hour SDS between each time period for the natural 
logarithm of 17-OHP. The mean of the 8-hour  SDS profile for each  visit is the  arithmetic mean of all the  SDSs with 
first and last (5th) weighted  ½ relative to the intermediate SDSs. For each of the 5  log-transformed 17-OHP values 
at each visit, an SDS was calculated by counting the number of SDs which were above or below the mean of the log-
transformed range. An ANCOVA model was based on the change  from baseline of the natural logarithm of the mean 
of the 8-hour  SDS profile of 17-OHP as  the dependent  variable, treatment group  and  pre-baseline therapy  as fixed 
effects and baseline of the natural  logarithm of the mean of the 8-hour  SDS profile of 17-OHP as the covariate.

2 A difference in LS means <0 favours Efmody. Note: Efmody was previously known as Chronocort. 
The analysis using 8-hour profiles rather than the  24-hour profiles was also repeated for A4. This 
analysis showed no differences between the treatment  groups for any of the 8-hour profiles. No 
notable differences were seen between the treatment  groups in the  analysis of the  8-hour profiles 
based on prior GC therapy (hydrocortisone only, prednisone or prednisolone alone or in combination 
with  hydrocortisone, and dexamethasone alone or in combination with  any other GC).  
Post-hoc analyses of the primary efficacy variable 
Data of the  2-sided unsigned SDS using  the difference from top of the range for high values and 
bottom of the range for low values (with  all values in  the range scoring 0) are presented in  Table 15. 
Table 12 Post-hoc Analysis of 2-sided Unsigned SDS Outside the Normal Reference  Range for 
17-OHP  at  Baseline  and Week  24 in DIUR-005  (EES) 
Note: Efmody was previously known as Chronocort. 
Data of the  1-sided SDS for high values using  only the lower boundary of the reference range and for 
low values using only the upper boundary of the reference range is provided in Table 13.  The SDS 
analysis of the 1-sided SDS above the lower limit of the reference range for 17-OHP  demonstrated that 
the Efmody treated cohort had a less controlled baseline but  that  the Efmody groups values decreased 
more, i.e. moved into  the reference range following Efmody treatment.  The 1-sided SDS below the 
upper limit of the reference range for 17-OHP  demonstrated that  more Efmody values at baseline were 
at the upper end of the  reference range, but the 17-OHP  values decreased more with Efmody 
treatment, without  the mean values suggesting  over-treatment.

Note: Efmody was previously known as Chronocort. 
One of the  points raised in the 2014  protocol assistance, was that a 2-sided SDS was not particularly 
sensitive to  amplitude, a point that  was borne out in the  pre-defined primary analysis. To examine the 
amplitude, an analysis of the change in range from baseline to Week 24  in 17-OHP values was 
conducted. This analysis shows a greater reduction in range in the  Efmody group, consistent with  less 
variable and more controlled 17-OHP concentrations (see Figure 13  and Figure  14). 
The dashed horizontal  lines represent  the optimal and reference (normal) ranges. For the reference range, 
the widest range is displayed for males and females.

An additional post-hoc analysis was also conducted on the log-transformed AUCs for 17-OHP. The 
changes from baseline are provided in  Table 14 This analysis showed a reduction in 17-OHP AUC in 
both treatment  groups throughout  the duration of the study. This reduction at Week 24 was greater in

1)  Change from Baseline to 24  Weeks in  the Natural  Logarithm of  the Mean of  the 24-hour  SDS Profile 
for the Natural Logarithm for A4 
Predefined analysis 
Very little  change was seen in both  treatment groups compared to baseline, and there was no notable 
difference between the 2 treatment groups (difference in LS means: 0.047;  95% CI: [-0.234,  0.329]; 
p=0.7405).

ANCOVA  Model  in Protocol DIUR-005 (EES) 
Note: Efmody was previously known as Chronocort. 
When the geometric mean A4 24-hour profiles were plotted graphically, a similar pattern was seen to 
17-OHP,  with participants  receiving Efmody having a flatter  profile showing stable and consistent A4 
levels throughout  the 24-hour period, while participants receiving standard GC therapy had a rise in A4 
levels overnight and in the morning before they took their first  dose of GC (See Figure 15).  However, it 
is of note that the  geometric mean A4 values were below the  lower limit  of the reference range for the 
Efmody group at most time points.

2)  Change from Baseline to 24  Weeks in  the Natural  Logarithm of  the Mean of  the 24-hour  SDS Profile 
for the Natural Logarithm of 17-OHP and A4 by Pre-Baseline Therapy Strata 
The analysis conducted for the primary endpoint variable analysis of 17-OHP  was repeated for each of 
the 3 subgroups of pre-baseline therapy strata: hydrocortisone only, prednisone or prednisolone (alone 
or in combination with  hydrocortisone), and dexamethasone (alone or in combination with  any other 
GC). All three subgroups showed better hormonal control at Week 24 compared to  baseline in both 
treatment groups; however, there were no notable differences between the  2 treatment groups for any 
of the pre-baseline therapy strata subgroups.  
3)17-OHP  and A4 Levels at 09:00 Hours as a Responder Analysis 
Predefined analysis 
A similar number of responders were seen in both treatment  groups for both 17-OHP  and A4. See 
Table 22. 
Table  19  Responders  at  09:00  Hours  at  Week  24  for  17-OHP  and  A4  Using  a  Logistic 
Regression Model in DIUR-005  (EES). Note  : Efmody was previously known as Chronocort. 
Post-hoc analyses 
A responder analysis was undertaken for the 09:00  17-OHP  values, with  a responder defined as a 
participant with  their 09:00  results at Week 24 in the  reference range for 17-OHP (rather than the 
optimal range used in the pre-defined analysis). At Week 24,  there were 19 responders (35.8%) in  the 
Efmody group and 16 responders (30.8%)  in the standard GC therapy group (Odds Ratio=1.33;  95% 
CI: [0.58, 3.10];  p=0.5067).   
A subsequent analysis restricted to  non-responders at baseline did not show a difference between the 
two treatment  groups. There were 18 responders (36.7%)  in the Efmody group and 8 responders 
(22.2%)  in the standard GC therapy group (Odds Ratio= 2.11,  95%CI: : [0.79,  6.07];  p=0.1404).

4) Changes in Body Composition (DEXA) 
Results of changes in body composition (DEXA) are presented in Table X. No significant differences 
between the 2 treatments groups were seen from the DEXA scans for total  fat and lean mass or bone 
mineral density. See Table 23. 
Table  20  Change  from baseline  in  body  composition (DEXA).  Note:  Efmody  was  previously 
known as Chronocort. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analysis was performed per baseline treatment strata. These analyses were included as a 
secondary endpoint in the study protocol “17-OHP and A4 by individual baseline treatment strata 
presented in the  same manner as the primary endpoint (using  24-hour SDS profile at 24  weeks)”.  
A large variety of post-hoc analyses were conducted, described above for the  respective efficacy 
variables.

Supportive study 
Study DIUR-006, is a Phase 3, open-label extension study enrolled participants who completed Studies 
DIUR-003 or DIUR-005. Patients continued Efmody therapy or switched  from their current GC therapy 
to Efmody. After screening, all participants underwent a full set of baseline assessments before starting 
treatment in this  extension study. Participants entering immediately from Study DIUR-005 who were

previously on Efmody continued on the same dose of Efmody that they were receiving at the  end of the 
feeder study. Participants from Study DIUR-005 on standard therapy, participants  from DIUR-005 who 
had a gap between completing Study DIUR-005 and starting Study DIUR-006 during which  they 
received standard GC therapy, and participants from Study DIUR-003 had their  initial dose of Efmody 
determined using  the hydrocortisone equivalent of their previous treatment (immediately prior to  the 
baseline visit).   
Participants returned to the study centre at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after starting  Study DIUR-006, and 6-
monthly thereafter for follow-up assessments. Dose titration  could be performed by the investigating 
physician at these visits. Dose adjustment  was to  be based on clinical symptoms using the Adrenal 
Insufficiency Checklist and the measurement of 17-OHP and A4 at 09.00 hr and 13.00  hr. Dose 
adjustments were considered if the  samples showed out  of range values for 17-OHP or A4. If 17-OHP 
and A4 showed inconsistent  trends, the A4 parameter took precedence in directing dose adjustment.  If 
there was a change of dose, an interim visit was needed in between the 6-monthly  visits. 
Interim data with a cut-off date of 30 April 2019 is submitted  in the present application. A total of 83 
participants were ongoing treatment  at the time of the cut-off date. 
The interim analysis set includes participants who had received at least one dose of Efmody and had 
completed the Visit 4 (Week 24)  assessment by 30  April 2019,  plus any participants who  discontinued 
or were withdrawn  prior to the  data cut-off  date. A total  of 92 participants are included in this  interim 
analysis: 41  who were already on Efmody, 40 who  were on standard GC therapy and switched  to 
Efmody, 6 who had a gap between completing Study DIUR-005 and starting Study DIUR-006 during 
which they received standard GC therapy, and 5 patients  from Study DIUR-003 had their initial  dose of 
Efmody determined using the hydrocortisone equivalent of their previous treatment (immediately prior 
to the baseline visit). Demographic characteristics were as follows:31.9% male, 68.1%  female, 33.0% 
aged 18  to <30 years, 48.4%  aged ≥30  to <50 years, and 18.7%  aged ≥50  to <70 years (no 
participants were aged ≥70 years). The number of participants  with data after Month  18 decreased so 
conclusions after this  point are limited  at the time of this interim analysis and thus  results are reported 
until  Month  18. 
Duration of treatment was a maximum of 3.5  years in this extension study. 
A reduction in the median total daily dose of Efmody was seen, falling from a median total  daily dose 
of 30 mg during the baseline to  Week 4 period (i.e. before the  first dose titration  period) in  all 
participants to a median of 20  mg during the Month  12 to Month  18 period. This represents a reduction 
in the median total daily dose of Efmody of 10  mg over the  course of the  first 18 months treatment  in 
this study which  represents a clinically meaningful steroid-sparing in  these participants.  Participants 
entering from the  standard GC therapy group in Study DIUR-005 tended to have a higher median dose 
during the baseline to Week 4 period (30  mg) compared to participants entering from the  Efmody 
group in Study DIUR-005 (25 mg). By the Month  12 to Month  18 period, the median dose was 22.6 mg 
in the DIUR-005 standard GC therapy group and 20.2 mg in the DIUR-005 Efmody group. There are 
too few participants in Study DIUR-003 and those who completed Study DIUR-005 and had a gap 
before starting Study DIUR-006 at the  time of this  interim analysis to draw any meaningful conclusions 
in these groups. 
An increase in the percentage of participants achieving disease control was seen at 09:00  hours for 
most visits compared to baseline for both 17-OHP  and A4 (from 56.7%  at baseline to a maximum of 
71.3%  at Week 12 for 17-OHP and from 53.3%  at baseline to a maximum of 68.0% at Month  18  for 
A4. (. For the 13:00  hour results, the 17-OHP and A4 levels remained relatively constant to  those seen 
at baseline.

Participants who entered this  study from the  standard GC therapy group in feeder Study DIUR-005 had 
a fall in the percentage of participants achieving disease control at 13:00  hours when they switched to 
Efmody (i.e. a change from 82.5%  at baseline to 62.5%  at Week 4 for 17-OHP and from 47.5% at 
baseline to 37.5%  at Week 4 for A4), but  by Week 12  the percentage of participants considered a 
disease responder was similar to the  participants treated with Efmody in Study DIUR-005.  
For all the 17-OHP  evaluations, the geometric mean values remained within  the optimal  range but 
became more established in the middle of the optimal range during the  evaluation period for this 
interim analysis (from a starting point near the bottom of the optimal range). See Figure 16.  For A4 
evaluations, the  geometric mean values remained around the lower limit  of the  reference range during 
the same period. See Figure 17.

2.4.5.  Clinical safety 
The safety assessment is mainly based on the pooled data from DIUR-003, DUIR-005 and the long 
term extension study DIUR-006. This population  is referred to as the “pooled population” for the 
remainder of this report. 
Six clinical studies contributed  safety data to support safety in  the dossier. All the clinical studies were 
open label which  is a limitation  when analysing the  safety data since unintentional bias in adverse 
effect reporting could be expected. Three of the clinical studies were conducted in adult  patients with 
CAH (DIUR-003, DIUR-005 and DIUR-006). In addition, three single-dose administration  studies were 
conducted in healthy adult volunteers (DIUR-002, DIUR-004, and DIUR-008).  
Study DIUR-005 was the only study  with a comparator. In this 6-months  study Efmody was compared 
with  standard glucocorticoid therapy (i.e. hydrocortisone only; prednisone or prednisolone alone or in 
combination with  hydrocortisone; and dexamethasone alone or in combination with  any other 
glucocorticoid) in 61+61  adult CAH patients. Results from DIUR-006 gives an overall safety profile for 
treatment with  Efmody longer than 6  months. 
Patient exposure 
In study DIUR 003  and -005 all patients (N=77)  received Efmody for 6 months (the  remaining 61 
patients received standard CG treatment).  Besides patients from DIUR-003 and -005  there were 43 
patients included in study  DIUR-006 who  were earlier treated with standard GC and are included in the 
“pooled analysis”. Of the 120 patients  in the “pooled analysis” three patients received standard therapy 
in Study DIUR-005 and then switched to  Efmody on Study DIUR-006. Therefore, the total patients  in 
the “pooled analysis” adds up to 120 instead of the expected 123.  Seventy-nine (79) of the 120

patients in  the “pooled analysis” was exposed to Efmody > 12 months including  43 subjects with  an 
exposure duration > 24 months. 
With  currently 91  patients included the mean total treatment duration in  the second interim analysis of 
Study DIUR-006 was 580.8 days (i.e., approximately 19 months), with  a range from 62  to 985 days. 
For patients who  received already Efmody in Study DIUR 005 (N=61),  the overall mean exposure to 
continuous Efmody treatment was 685.1  days (i.e. approximately 1 year 11 months), ranging from 85 
to 1147  days. The follow-up of patients on Efmody is very limited. 
Adverse events (AE) 
In the single dose healthy volunteer studies (doses varying from 5 to  50 mg hydrocortisone), all but 1 
of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild (1 TEAE was moderate in severity), were 
single episodes and reported by 1 subject each. Three subjects had a total  of 4 TEAEs considered 
related to  administration of study medication: 1 subject (1.5%) with  2 events of upper abdominal pain 
and dyspnoea who received Efmody and 2 subjects (8.3%)  with  1 event each of dyspepsia and mood 
swings who received Cortef (Immediate release hydrocortisone).  
A total of 211 treatment-related TEAEs were reported in  68 patients (56.7%)  who received Efmody. 
The most common treatment-related TEAEs by PT were unexpected therapeutic response (21.7%), 
fatigue (11.7%),  headache (7.5%),  and increased appetite (5.8%).  All treatment related adverse 
events reported in the pooled population  are summarised in Table 25.

In the overall assessment, there were few differences of note between the treatments  in treatment 
related AEs reported (by preferred term [PT]). The most notable differences between the Efmody and 
standard glucocorticoid therapy pools, respectively, were observed for therapeutic response 
unexpected (21.7%  vs 1.6%),  headache (7.5%  vs 1.6%),  increased appetite (5.8% vs 3.3%), weight 
increase (including abnormal weight gain) (9.2%  vs1.6%), decreased appetite (5.0%  vs 0%)  and 
nausea (4.2%  vs 1,6%). 
Serious adverse event (SAE)/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in any of the clinical studies conducted with  Efmody.  
A total of 41 SAEs were reported in 19 patients  (15.8%)  who received Efmody. The most common 
SAEs were acute adrenocortical insufficiency (2.5%),  gastroenteritis (3.3%),  diverticulitis (1.7%); 
appendicitis, adrenal insufficiency, and abdominal pain (1.7%),  and viral gastroenteritis and dyspnoea 
(0.8%).  All other SAEs were only reported by 1 patient. Single SAEs in patients  who received Efmody 
were: gastroenteritis norovirus, lower respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, salpingitis,  tonsillitis, 
abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea, fatigue, fall, red blood cell (RBC) microcytes, hypokalaemia, arthritis, 
intervertebral disc protrusion, breast cancer, depressed level of consciousness, loss of consciousness, 
and anxiety. All SAEs resolved. 
Laboratory findings 
On average, there were no clinically meaningful changes over time or differences between the 
treatment groups in haematology or biochemistry variables or urinalysis. Further, the changes reported 
over time or differences between the treatments  for the vital signs (weight,  BMI and waist 
circumference) are not clinically relevant.  
None of the healthy volunteers had a corrected QT interval by Bazett (QTcB)/QTcF interval that was 
greater than  500 msec, or a change in QTcB/QTcF interval that  was greater than  60 msec. Further, 
there were no clinically relevant differences observed in vital signs or 12-lead ECG between Efmody 
and immediate-release hydrocortisone. 
Vital signs 
In the comparative study DIUR-005, there were small increases from baseline to the  end of study in 
both the  Efmody and standard GC therapy groups for mean weight  (+0.87 and +1.01  kg, 
respectively), BMI (+0.330  and +0.346  kg/m2, respectively), and waist circumference (+0.21 and 
+0.96  cm, respectively). These small increases were not  sustained in the DIUR-006 extension study, 
where instead of a small decrease from baseline to Month  24 in mean weight (-0.28  kg) and BMI 
(-0.083  kg/m2).  
Other significant adverse events  
Adrenal crises 
Overall, available safety data from study DIUR-003, DIUR-005 and DIUR-006 did  not indicate any 
increased risk for adrenal crisis with  Efmody compared to standard GC therapy. The risk for adrenal 
crisis is reflected in the proposed SmPC in section 4.4. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 59/79 
 
 
 
 
There were no SAEs or TEAEs considered indicative of an adrenal crisis in studies DIUR-002, DIUR-
003,  DIUR-004 or DIUR-008. 
Signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and over treatment 
The diagnosis of adrenal crisis used were published by Allolio, 2015.  These criteria include the  general 
accepted criteria (2 issues out  of the following: hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100  mmHg), 
nausea or vomiting, severe fatigue, fever, somnolence, hyponatraemia (<132 mmol/l) or 
hyperkalaemia (as judged by characteristic ECG changes)or hypoglycaemia). The frequency of signs 
and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or over-treatment (among others fatigue, sleeping difficulties, 
muscle weakness, weight gain, headache and increased appetite) was higher in  the Efmody group (35 
patients (57.4%))  compared to the  standard GC-treatment (26  patients (42.6%)).   In this section all 
AEs are included regardless of the assigned relation with  the treatment). 
•  Signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency 
In the Efmody group, the  proportion of subjects reporting headache and fatigue as symptoms of 
under-treatment were reduced early (4 weeks) after initiation  of Efmody. Headache reduced from 
13.1%  at baseline to 3.3%  (week 4) and 0% at the  visits thereafter. Fatigue  reduced from 18.0%  at 
baseline to 6.6%  at week 4 and thereafter varied between 6.6-8.2%.  In the standard GC therapy 
group a slight  decrease overtime was noted for fatigue with  14.8% at baseline and week 4. Thereafter, 
the frequency varied between 8.2% and 11.5%.   
•  Signs and symptoms of over-treatment  
In the Efmody group, changes from baseline of >5 percentage points in the frequency of participants 
with  signs and symptoms of over-treatment were observed for sudden weight  gain (1.6% at baseline, 
11.5%  at Week 4 and 9.8% at Week 24/End of study) and in the standard GC therapy group, a change 
in frequency with  >5 percentage points was noted for fatigue (0% at baseline, 6.6% at Week 12), 
sudden weight gain (0%  at baseline, 6.6%  at Week 24 and 8.2% at end of study), and increased 
appetite (0% at  baseline, 6.6% at  Week 24 and end of study) for the standard GC therapy group. 
In DIUR-006, signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or over-treatment were reported for 
45 patients  (49.5%) with  22  participants (24.2%)  having signs and symptoms due to over-treatment 
and 32 participants (35.2%)  due to under-treatment. The most frequently reported symptoms of 
adrenal insufficiency were headache (highest incidence of 5.5% at Visit 2/Week 4) and fatigue (highest 
incidence of 8.8%  at Visit 4/Week 24),  and the most frequently reported symptoms of over-treatment 
were increased appetite (highest  incidence of 6.6% at  Visit 2/Week 4), sudden weight  gain (highest 
incidence of 7.7%  at Visit 3/Week 12),  headache (highest incidence of 5.5%  at Visit 2/Week 4) and 
sleeping difficulties (highest incidence of 4.4%  at Visit 2/Week 4).   
Overall, patient switching  from standard GC therapy in  DIUR -005 to  Efmody in study DIUR-006, 
reported sign and symptoms related to over treatment with  higher frequencies compared to the group 
of patients that  continued treatment with  Efmody without  a gap between DIUR-005 and DIUR-006. 
Patients without  a gap of Efmody treatment when entering DIUR-006 from DIUR-005, had fewer 
reports of overtreatment in  the extension study.  
•  Unexpected therapeutic benefit or detriment effect 
In study DIUR-005 unexpected therapeutic benefit was reported for 10 patients (16.4%)  in the Efmody 
group and one patient  (1.6%) in the  standard GC therapy group. These events can be summarised as 
improvement of mood, alertness and energy in 6 patients, improvement in reproductive hormone 
regulation in 5 patients  (with more regular menstrual cycles being reported in 4 patients),  and other 
improvements in 3 patients.  One patient  in the standard GC therapy group had an improvement in 
reproductive hormone regulation (more regular menstrual cycle). Due to the  lack of information 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 60/79 
 
 
 
 
considering the  correctness of the pre-baseline regimen the beneficial effect – although clearly 
observed – cannot be attributed  to the  Efmody treatment as a less optimal pre-baseline treatment 
regimen cannot be excluded.  
Besides the unexpected beneficial effect of Efmody some of the  patient report adverse events (4) that 
can be considered a detriment effect. Adverse events considered detriment were less alert-
“somnolence”, menstrual deterioration-“menses irregular”, increased hair loss “alopecia” and increased 
hirsutism “hair growth  abnormal”.  
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
Although the  overall frequency of TEAEs appear not different between the sexes, the frequency of SAE 
is higher in women compared to men. On an AE level the following  SAE are reported more by females 
than by men (nausea (9.5%  males vs. 21.8% females), headache (33.3%  males vs. 44.9% females) 
and pyrexia (16.7% males vs. 28.2%  females. While dizziness (26.2%  males vs. 12.8% females) and 
arthralgia (21.4% males vs. 10.3%  females) were more frequently reported by male than  by female 
patients. Given the limited patient  population (61 patients  on Efmody and 61 on standard GC 
treatment) and follow-up (about  6 months) these differences are considered change findings.  The only 
notable difference between the gender groups was for infections and infestations, with  females having 
a higher number of these events (14 events in 9 females [11.5%]  compared to 2 events in 2 males 
[4.8%]).  However, a variety of different PTs within  the SOC infections and infestations  were reported 
as SAEs, and no specific pattern could be identified. 
In the safety study pool 7 SAEs were reported in 4/42  males (9.5%),  and 34 SAEs were reported in 
15/78  females (19.2%).  The only SAE PTs reported by more than two  subjects were “gastroenteritis” 
(4 events reported by 4 females, no such event was reported in males) and “adrenocortical 
insufficiency acute” reported in three subjects (5 events in 2 females and one event in one male). To 
note is that  one patient  had recurrent episodes of gastroenteritis and associated adrenal crises and 
reported 5 SAEs. Overall, no specific difference of clinical relevance in SAE pattern  between males and 
females could be noted. 
Race and age 
Given the fact that  all but  5 patients were Caucasian and all but  2 patients were within  the 18-64 age 
an analysis by race and age is considered not necessary.  
Preceding GC treatment 
There were no meaningful differences between the previous treatments in the  proportion of patients 
with  TEAEs or the characteristics of the TEAEs. The number of patients  previously treated with 
dexamethasone alone or combined with  any other GC was too low for meaningful comparison with  the 
other previous treatments.  
Use in renal and hepatic impairment 
Patients with  clinical or biochemical evidence of renal and hepatic impairment respectively, were 
excluded from the Efmody trial programme.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted, which is considered acceptable by the CHMP.   
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Three (3)  subjects across the patient  and healthy subject study pools discontinued study intervention 
due to TEAEs. One patient  treated with Efmody in Study DIUR-005 (1/61,  1.6%) discontinued Efmody 
due to TEAEs of mild nausea, increased body temperature, increased appetite, depressed mood, and 
hyperhidrosis; 1 patient  treated with  Efmody in Study DIUR-006 (1/91, 1.1%)  discontinued treatment 
due to carpal tunnel  syndrome; and 1 subject treated with  Efmody in Study DIUR-004 (1/18, 5.6%) 
discontinued treatment due to upper abdominal pain and dyspnea. 
2.4.6.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. According to the  applicant, the medicinal product has not  been 
marketed in any country. 
2.4.7.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Hydrocortisone is a well-known and well-characterised substance, with  a known mechanism of action.  
Based on the reference product and scientific literature (Le Roux et al., 2002; McKay and Cidlowski, 
2003),  the pharmacokinetic profile of hydrocortisone (distribution,  metabolism and elimination)  has 
been adequately characterised and the proposed SmPC information is considered in  line with the  state 
of scientific knowledge. 
In line with  the current Guideline on the pharmacokinetics and clinical evaluation of modified release 
dosage forms (EMA/CPMP/EWP/280/96  Corr1), the modified release formulation properties were 
characterised in vivo regarding (i)  the rate and extent of absorption, (ii) fluctuations  in drug 
concentrations at steady-state, (iii) inter-subject variability in pharmacokinetics, (iv) dose 
proportionality, (v) factors affecting the performance of the  modified-release formulation, and (vi) the 
risk of unexpected release characteristics, e.g. dose dumping  (see quality part).The applicant also used 
pharmacokinetic data in order to evaluate which formulation and dosage regimen that  would best 
mimic the physiological circadian serum cortisol profile over the day. 
In the bridging study (DIUR-004), after administration of Efmody, serum cortisol Tmax was observed 
later (0.88h vs 4.5h),  Cmax was 17% lower and AUC 19% was higher compared to the  20  mg 
immediate release reference product, showing a delayed-release properties of Efmody, expected for a 
modified release formulation. 
The 5, 10 and 20 mg formulations were dose-proportional. In addition,  although not dose linear, linear 
pharmacokinetics were observed . The use of the different 5, 10 and 20 mg formulations is acceptable, 
as comparable relative pharmacokinetics can be expected. 
The applicant developed a PBPK model to support the indication in  children from the age of 12. 
Simulations indicated that  dosing of Efmody based on either body weight  (mg/kg) or body surface area 
(mg/m2) will  result in a cortisol pharmacokinetic profile comparable to adults. However, the 
simulations are not  considered adequate for making claims on the exposure in the adolescent 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 62/79 
 
 
 
 
 
population. Nonetheless, dosing in adolescents is endorsed based on the  titration  guided dosing 
regimen.  
No specific dose recommendation is needed for subjects with  renal or hepatic impairment, elderly, 
gender or race, in line with  known SmPC recommendations of hydrocortisone, in which no specific dose 
recommendations are indicated for orally administered hydrocortisone. Additionally, known interactions 
of hydrocortisone have been included in the  SmPC which is agreed, as it is not expected that  the 
interaction profile of Efmody will differ from that  of other oral hydrocortisone release formulations. No 
formal dose-finding study was performed for Efmody. The starting  dose, titration  regimen and dosing 
regimen was based on phase 1 PK studies and study DIUR-003 and consisted of a start dose of 30 mg 
Efmody, 10 mg in the morning and 20 mg in the evening. This regimen was shown to mimic 
physiological cortisol rhythm in the phase I studies and was considered adequate for control of 
androgen secretion. The dosing advice in  the SmPC is based on the international  treatment guidelines, 
which is considered appropriate.   
In the context of CAH, 17-OHP and A4 were assessed as biomarkers for treatment  response in study 
DIUR-003 and are used as pharmacodynamic endpoints in study DIUR-005. This is acceptable since in 
clinical practice, androgen levels are used to guide treatment, and in CAH, the suppression of 
androgens is a specific goal of the GC replacement therapy. 
Study DIUR-003 was conducted to confirm the efficacy of the two  daily dosing regimen in  suppressing 
androgen secretion and to  inform on dose and study  design of the subsequent phase 3 study. The 
study design is considered adequate to provide this  proof of concept. It is not considered sufficient to 
provide evidence to confirm the hypothesis that  Efmody can provide superior androgen control 
compared to standard treatment since the study did not contain a control arm. The patient  population 
and titration  regimen were largely the same as that of the phase 3 study.  
On standard treatment, a rise in ACTH levels was observed from 03:00  hrs, reaching a plateau from 
07:00  hrs to  13:00 hrs, before declining after 17:00 hrs. On Efmody, ACTH levels did not rise at 
03:00hrs and were stable and notably lower than those on standard treatment through the day. The 
ACTH profiles observed is suggestive of the interaction between glucocorticoid therapy, the central 
clock, and glucocorticoid feedback. Improved androgen control was also reflected in more stable 17-
OHP and A4 levels whilst on Efmody compared to standard treatment. After 6 months of treatment, 15 
of 16 patients had a 09.00  hours 17-OHP  level within  the optimal range. For the standard therapy 
group this was 5 of 16 patients.  
Overall, the proposed dosing regimen of 30 mg per day divided in two doses (20  mg in the evening 
and 10 mg in the morning) in  this study provided a physiological cortisol profile and suppression of the 
androgen peak in  the early morning via normalization of the  ACTH profile. These data suggested that  a 
twice daily dose regimen was appropriate in  the phase III studies. 
Design and conduct of phase 3 clinical studies 
Main study DIUR-005 
The general outline of this randomized, open-label study has been endorsed as part of CHMP   scientific 
advice(s).  
The primary objective of the study was to show superiority (efficacy) of Efmody compared to standard 
GC replacement therapy. This is understandable since the applicant aimed to show a significant benefit 
over standard treatment. However, the  fact that patients  are titrated based on 17-OHP levels, while 
this is also the primary efficacy variable complicates the interpretation  of the results. A comparison

with  only conventional hydrocortisone would have been strongly preferred as also pointed out  several 
times in scientific advice procedures.  
Patients with  classical CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency were included, both simple virilising and 
salt-wasting.  Patients were to be on a minimum treatment with  GC’s for 6 months to  try to  include 
patients that  were optimised on current treatment. The currently proposed indication includes all 
patients above 12  years of age with  congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This is not  considered an 
issue since GC replacement therapy forms the mainstay of CAH management, and in  clinical practice, 
treatment will  always be initiated by an experienced physician.  
Patients >18  years of age were included in the studies, while the  applicant proposes an indication 
>12 years of age. Efficacy and safety are extrapolated from adults to adolescents based on PBPK 
modelling (see Pharmacokinetics). From a clinical perspective, the extrapolation to adolescents is 
acceptable.  
Patients with  salt-wasting  CAH were included in the study if properly managed on mineralocorticoids. 
Since a large proportion of the indicated patient  population is treated with mineralocorticoids, this  is 
appropriate.  
Patients were randomized to receive either Efmody or to stay on their standard GC therapy. The 
starting dose of Efmody was calculated as prednisone/prednisolone dose multiplied by 5 and 
dexamethasone dose multiplied by 80 with  a maximum of 30 mg Efmody per day to  prevent 
overtreatment.  
Randomization was based on three pre-treatment strata; hydrocortisone only, prednisone/prednisolone 
and dexamethasone. Randomization was performed stratified by baseline treatment. This is endorsed.  
This was an open-label study. Blinding was considered not feasible given the wide variety of baseline 
therapies. This is acknowledged. To minimize bias due to  knowledge of the therapy, dose titration  was 
carried out by an independent blinded physician, which  is acceptable. The primary efficacy variable was 
the 24-hour hormone profile, and therefore unlikely to be impacted by the physician or the 
participants' behaviour or measurement error due to knowledge of the treatment received. 
Patients were followed for 6 months. Dose titration  was possible for all treatment arms during the 
study based on 24h  17-OHP, and A4 profiles were taken at week 4  and 12  and an adrenal insufficiency 
checklist. The decisions to increase or decrease the dose were made by an independent physician. In 
clinical practice, this  is not feasible, and dose titration is based on consistently timed hormone 
measurement and even more so guided by the  overall clinical picture of the patient.  This limits the 
conclusions on the  daily dose, and the data are to be interpreted with caution.  These findings are 
further discussed in conjunction  with the  dose titration  used in the extension study DIUR-006 and its 
results (see further below). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to 24  weeks of the  mean of the 24-hour 
standard deviation score (SDS) profile for 17-OHP. Key secondary endpoints were the change from 
baseline to 24  weeks of the mean of the 24-hour SDS profile for A4, 17-OHP  and A4 by individual 
baseline treatment  strata and a responder analysis for 17-OHP and A4 levels at 09:00  (i.e. the number 
of participants achieving results in the optimal  range).  
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the EES, which comprises a per-protocol set of completers, 
i.e. subjects with relevant data available at Week 24. According to the  SAP, a corresponding primary 
endpoint analysis was also performed on the FAS, however, the  FAS definition  here does not  follow the 
Intent To Treat (ITT) principle. Therefore, an analysis of the primary endpoint would have been 
expected for all randomised subjects analysed according to  the randomised treatment and using an 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 64/79 
 
 
 
 
appropriate imputation  method to handle missing data. However, since only 1  subject in  each 
treatment group is excluded from the  FAS, this analysis was not further requested.  
The primary efficacy variable 17-OHP and secondary efficacy variable A4 are used as biomarkers to 
assess treatment outcome. Since in clinical practice, 17-OHP and A4 are often used as a target for 
treatment; this  was considered acceptable by the  CHMP. Using the  SDS to depict the hormone levels is 
common practice and is accepted, however a mean unsigned SDS has several limitations. By taking 
the mean, circadian rhythms are cancelled out.  The unsigned SDS does not separate effects under or 
above the normal mean, a difference that might  be clinically relevant. The SDS is also not very 
sensitive to  amplitude, while the treatment  is aimed at decreasing the early morning peak in androgen 
levels.  
Clinical endpoints are not  extensively included in the  study protocol. Fat  mass, lean mass and total 
bone density were included as secondary efficacy endpoints. Body weight  could be used as a clinically 
relevant marker for over- or under-treatment but  is prone to bias. 
The study duration of 6 months is considered adequate to assess a treatment effect on biomarkers 
such as 17-OHP  and A4. However, the effects on clinical endpoints may take longer to occur.  
A responder analysis was performed as a secondary analysis. Responders are defined as patients that 
have hormone levels within  the optimal range for 17-OHP and within  the normal range for A4. This is 
considered clinically relevant since treatment  is guided by these reference ranges in clinical practice.  
An important exploratory endpoint was the use of GCs at the beginning and end of the study, 
presented both  as individual GCs used and as calculated hydrocortisone equivalents using accepted 
conversion constants for the calculations. 
The amendments made to the study protocol for study DIUR-005 are not  considered to have affected 
the outcome or the  interpretation of the study. 
Supportive study DIUR-006 
The primary goal of this  study was to  assess the long-term safety of Efmody. Long term efficacy 
variables included daily GC dose, the proportion of responders and the  change from baseline in 17-OHP 
and A4 levels. This is considered relevant given the  necessity for life-long treatment  in this condition. 
In general, the lack of a control arm limits  the interpretation of the data.  
Patients from study DIUR-003 and DIUR-005 could be enrolled in this  study. Both Efmody naïve and 
experienced patients were enrolled. It  has to be noted that  as a result, only treatment-experienced 
patients contribute  to the information on long term safety and efficacy at the moment.  
Starting dose of Efmody was calculated in the  same way as in DIUR-005, as the hydrocortisone 
equivalent of their pre-baseline treatment.   
Dose titrations  were possible in this study, albeit in  a different manner than  that of the study DIUR-
005.  Since this was an uncontrolled, open-label study,  dose titrations  were carried out by the 
investigator based on only two hormone measurements; the  09.00 hr measurement to guide the 
evening dose and the 13.00 hr measurement to  guide the  morning dose. This is considered acceptable 
since it better resembles clinical practice than the  24 hour profiles taken in study DIUR-005.  
Efficacy data  and additional analyses 
DIUR-005 
Of the 138 patients  screened, 122 patients were randomized over the two treatment  arms, 61 patients 
per arm. The evaluable efficacy data set comprised of 53 patients  for the Efmody arm and 52 patients 
for the standard GC therapy arm. The main reason for exclusion was a major protocol deviation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 65/79 
 
 
 
 
Review of the protocol deviations (79.5%  overall) showed many patients had an endocrine 
measurement out of window.  Since 24h hormone profiles were used, this  is not  of concern.  
Prior CAH medication was balanced due to stratification.  The largest proportion of the  patients used 
hydrocortisone only as their standard therapy, in  line with common clinical practice. The second largest 
group used prednisolone/prednisone, and only a minor proportion of the patients  used dexamethasone, 
making subgroup analysis for this group difficult.   
There was a difference in baseline disease control between the Efmody and standard therapy group, 
which cannot be explained and is considered a chance finding. Glucocorticoid daily dose, measured as 
a hydrocortisone equivalent dose (mg/day), increased in most subjects during the study (see Table 
12), likely due to  the rigorous titration  regimen. In contrast, an overall GC sparing effect was reported 
for Efmody compared to standard therapy after 24 weeks of treatment (mg/day/BSA). This was mainly 
driven by the dexamethasone and prednisolone/prednisone subgroup. A similar daily dose was 
reported in the  Efmody versus the hydrocortisone C immediate release subgroup.  
In the overall study population, the total  median daily GC dose per BSA was 15.82  mg/m2/day in the 
Efmody group and 17.04  mg/m2/day in the  standard therapy group (see Table 12).   
Hormone levels 
The mean of the 24-hour SDS profile of 17-OHP was negative for both Efmody and standard GC 
therapy group, indicating  that both  groups achieved more optimal  hormonal control during the study, 
likely due to the possibility to  titrate the dose based on the 24h  17-OHP and A4 profiles. This is 
considered beneficial for the patient,  although this way of dose titration  is not feasible in  clinical 
practice. The primary endpoint,  namely clinical superiority compared to the standard glucocorticoid 
therap, was not met. The titration  possibility on the primary endpoint variable (17-OHP)  might have 
contributed to  the failure to show the clinical superiority of Efmody compared to standard GC therapy. 
In addition, the circadian rhythm in part cancelled out the  response as was also indicated by the 
applicant.  
A relevant clinical difference can however be observed through “eyeball statistics”  in the mean 17-OHP 
curves (nmol/L) between Efmody and standard therapy. The early morning 17-OHP  peak seems to be 
reduced in the  Efmody group as compared to the  standard GC therapy (see Figure 11 and Figure 12). 
In particular, at 24 weeks the 17-OHP  SDS was lower in the morning period (07:00 hrs to 15:00  hrs) 
but  not in the evening or overnight. 
The applicant has performed a range of post-hoc analyses on the data to further explore the effect of 
Efmody on 17-OHP  curves, part of these analyses were suggested through  CHMP scientific advice 
procedures. The main relevant findings were as follows: 
- 
The 1-sided unsigned SDS above the lower limit  of the reference range for 17-OHP at  baseline 
and week 24 showed a difference between the  treatment arms (difference in LS 
means: -0.976;  95%  CI [-1.895,-0.058];  p=0.0374).  The same was shown for the 1-sided 
unsigned SDS below the upper limit of the reference range (difference in LS means: 0.816; 
95%CI [0.094,1.539];  p=0.0272).   
-  A reduction in 17-OHP AUC in both treatment  groups throughout  the duration of the study. 
This reduction at Week 24 was greater in  the Efmody group (difference in LS means: -13.771; 
95% CI [-25.783,  -1.758];  p=0.0251) 
-  A difference between the  2 treatment groups was observed in the 07:00  to 15:00  hour profile 
(difference in LS means: -0.286;  95%  CI: [-0.564,  -0.008];  p=0.0442)  but  not in the  other 8-
hour periods.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 66/79 
 
 
 
 
No correction for multiplicity  has been performed, and therefore these analyses should be regarded as 
exploratory but overall supportive for an effect of Efmody in achieving morning control of androgens.  
When pre-treatment therapy subgroups were analysed separately, no difference between the 
treatment arms could be shown on either 17-OHP and A4 levels.  
Responder analysis 
The responder analysis is considered relevant (See Table 22).  A similar number of responders were 
seen in  both treatment groups for both  17-OHP and A4 (17-OHP: 30  responders in each group, Odds 
Ratio=0.99;  95% CI: [0.45, 2.19];  p=0.9877;  A4: 25 responders in the  Efmody group and 26 
responders in the standard GC therapy group, Odds Ratio=0.93;  95% CI: [0.43,  2.02]; p=0.8498).   
Although differences in baseline responder proportions, disease control and the classification of 
patients ending up below the lower limit  of normal (LLN)  as “non-responder” makes the results difficult 
to interpret,  the  proportions of patients with  17-OHP levels (09.00h)  below the upper limit  of the 
optimal range (36  mmol/L) is considered more informative. In the  Efmody group 90.6% of the patients 
(48/53)  achieved control versus 71.2% (37/52)  of the patients in  the standard therapy group.  
Clinical endpoints 
No clinically relevant changes were observed in bone markers. The clinical endpoints body mass and 
bone mineral density were measured by DEXA scan.  
No differences between the 2 treatments groups were seen from the DEXA scans for total  lean mass or 
bone mineral density. Although a reduction in total  fat mass was seen, with  an estimated 0.413 kg LS 
mean reduction in  the Efmody group compared to an estimated 0.547 kg LS mean increase in the 
standard GC therapy group from baseline to Week 24, the overall difference between treatment groups 
was not statistically significant  (difference in LS means: -0.960  kg; 95% CI: [-2.294,  0.347]; 
p=0.1560). 
Exploratory endpoints 
Change in  Bone Markers, fasting glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)   
The majority of the results related to changes in bone markers, fasting glucose and HbA1c were not 
considered clinically significant, and in those that  were, only a small number of participants  were seen 
to have clinically significant changes during the study. The only difference between the treatment 
groups was for fasting glucose, where a higher number of clinically significant increases were seen 
during the study in  the Efmody group compared to the standard GC therapy group, which is in line with 
the established mechanism of action of Efmody which normalises cortisol levels in the  early morning 
with  a corresponding normalising effect on morning glucose levels but no impact on HbA1c. 
No effect of Efmody was observed on quality of life measured by several different questionnaires (SF-
36, MAF,  EQ-5D). As also pointed out  by the applicant,  this may be due to the relatively short follow up 
time. 
Overall, the data from study DIUR-005 show that the titration  regimen was likely too aggressive, with 
putting  too much emphasis on hormonal control at the cost of potential GC overreplacement.  
DIUR-006 
In total, 92  out of 133 patients eligible for treatment decided to  enrol for the extension study (DIUR-
006).  Although the number of patients in study DIUR-005 declining participation in  the extension study 
was balanced between groups, the willingness to continue (or start) Efmody treatment gives an 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 67/79 
 
 
 
 
 
indication on the satisfaction with  either the standard treatment or Efmody. The CHMP  however noted 
that the majority of patients declined participation in the follow-up  study due to  administrative reasons 
or due to  the long gap between the  studies. 
In DIUR-006, the dose optimization  regimen was more in line with  clinical practice. During the  course 
of the study, there was an overall decline in the median daily dose recorded for all patients, while 
androgen control was largely maintained.  
Since there is no control arm, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the dose titration  data. However, 
the data gives some reassurance that the dose titration  regimen in  DIUR-005 was too aggressive and 
that  long-term androgen control can be achieved on adrenal replacement doses of Efmody. In 
particular, the initial  decrease in the number of participants achieving disease control for those who 
were on standard GC therapy and switched to Efmody, is possibly due to participants initially  being on 
a higher dose of Efmody based on the conversion from standard GC therapy that  had been intensively 
titrated  during study DIUR-005 and so ending up below the lower limit of the reference range, but  once 
the dose of Efmody was reduced they returned to within  the  reference range. In this  context, the 
SmPC dosing information recommends the use of the  lowest possible dose and for maintenance 
therapy, the dose must be individualised according to the response of the individual patient.  
No studies have been conducted in special populations which  is considerable acceptable by the CHMP.    
Safety  data  and additional analyses 
With  138 unique patients  included in the studies the safety database on Efmody is very limited, even 
taken into consideration that  CAH is a rare disease (prevalence is 1 – 9/100,000  therefore ample 
patients should be available).  
Based on the limited data derived from the clinical studies, no comprehensive assessment of the safety 
of Efmody can be made. However, the  safety profile of hydrocortisone is considered well-known. 
Therefore it is considered sufficient that  the applicant relies on the general safety knowledge of 
hydrocortisone and shows in a limited  safety population that  Efmody does not raise any new safety 
issues compared with  hydrocortisone or that the frequencies of AEs is different. 
In the pooled analysis of patients  with CAH (pooled data from study DIUR-003, -005  (patients on 
Efmody only) and -006)  a total  of 211 treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 68  patients (56.7%). 
The most common treatment-related TEAEs by PT were fatigue (11.7%),  headache (7.5%),  and 
increased appetite (5.8%).  As such, these are the adverse event to  be expected in  this population of 
patients treated with  corticosteroids. No unexpected adverse events are observed, however, a 
consistent increased frequency of known adverse events was observed for Efmody. 
The greatest differences between the Efmody and standard glucocorticoid therapy arms in the overall 
occurrence of treatment  related AE’s, respectively, were observed for headache (7.5% vs 1.6%), 
increased appetite (5.8%  vs 3.3%),  weight increase (including  abnormal weight gain) (9.2%  vs1.6%), 
decreased appetite (5.0%  vs 0%)  and nausea (4.2% vs 1.6%).Most  of the TEAEs were mild or 
moderate. The patients switching  from their standard GC treatment (either hydrocortisone, 
prednisone, prednisolone or dexamethasone) to Efmody reported a higher frequency of adverse 
events, this might  be explained by the open-label design of the study were the patients in the control 
group continued on their respective treatment. It is, therefore, not  unexpected that  these patients 
reported lesser adverse events.  
The frequency of “signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or over-treatment” were higher in  the 
Efmody treated patients  (57.4%) as compared to the standard GC treatment (42.6%).  These AE were 
mainly reported during the first 12  weeks during the titration  phase of the study.  
No deaths were reported in any of the clinical studies conducted with  Efmody.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 68/79 
 
 
 
 
Due to  the study design, the adrenal crisis during standard glucocorticoid therapy were reported in the 
first six months only with no follow-up information. Those reported during the use of Efmody appeared 
in the follow-up  phase of the clinical programme. Although there is a theoretical risk for 
undertreatment and adrenal crisis short after initiation/switch  to a modified release formulation 
(Efmody), no adrenal crisis were reported during the first 6 months  of treatment.  
No children were included in the  studies. As the proposed indication  is from 12 years onwards the data 
of children between 12  and 18  is lacking. Literature data clearly indicate that  the clinical profile 
observed in adolescents is comparable with the adult  population, especially considering the 
cardiovascular risk factors. As these adolescents are near adulthood it  is considered acceptable to 
extrapolate the results obtained with  adults to the children aged 12 to 17. As adolescents approach 
adult size and weight, and so near completion of growth, an adult empirical dose-based strategy is 
used of 15-25  mg/day of hydrocortisone. Furthermore, the improved control of overnight androgen 
precursors might be more in line with  the normal physiology. In addition, lower doses of 
hydrocortisone with  disease control should reduce potentially adverse effects on bone mass accretion, 
growth and development of cardiovascular risk factors.  
No data is available in elderly population.  
Appropriate warnings have been made in the SmPC in line with  the reference product and the known 
safety profile of oral hydrocortisone. Particularly, warnings on growth retardation and accelerated 
sexual maturation were included in line with  the important potential  risks from the RMP. 
2.4.8.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The main study failed to demonstrate clinical superiority of Efmody over standard GC therapy. 
However, Efmody treatment provided adequate cortisol replacement for a significant proportion of CAH 
patients. The curves suggested optimized disease control concerning the morning 17-OHP  levels. This 
was supported by the proportions of CAH patients with  17-OHP level (9.00  hrs) below 36 mmol/L after 
24 weeks of treatment favouring Efmody.   
No unexpected adverse events have been identified with  Efmody. Overall, the safety of Efmody is 
comparable to the well known safety profile of oral hydrocortisone.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication claimed by the applicant is “Treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in 
adolescents aged 12 years and over and adults.” 
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of genetic disorders leading to hyperandrogenism and 
adrenal insufficiency. Approximately 95% of CAH cases are caused by mutations  in CYP21A2, the gene 
encoding adrenal steroid 21-hydroxylase.  
The worldwide incidence in most studies ranged from; 1:14000  to 1:18000  births.   
CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is divided into the  classic (severe, early-onset) form and the 
non-classic (mild, late-onset) form. Classic CAH can be subdivided in salt-wasting CAH (approximately 
two-thirds  of patients) and simple-virilising CAH (one-third  of patients),  reflecting the degree of 
aldosterone deficiency 
In patients were mineralocorticoids production is affected, a life-threatening salt-wasting condition 
manifests in the first weeks of life. In addition, all CAH patients are at  risk of adrenal crisis when 
experiencing physiological stress, another life-threatening  situation that  occurred due to the lack of 
adequate cortisol production. 
Simple-virilising CAH in  males and females appeared later in childhood and is characterised by early 
onset of puberty, and premature completion of growth leading to short stature. Due to excess 
androgen formation, female patients  can present with  atypical or ambiguous genitalia and menstrual 
irregularities.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The recommended treatment of choice is glucocorticoid replacement therapy with  oral hydrocortisone.  
In adults, treatment with  long-acting  GC such as prednisone/prednisolone or dexamethasone is also 
possible. Replacement therapy with  long-acting GC requires less doses per day and is therefore 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 71/79 
 
 
 
 
preferred by some patients.  Since the growth-suppressive effect of long-acting GC is more potent than 
hydrocortisone, these products should not be used in growing patients.  In addition, all patients, but 
especially those still growing, should always be treated with  the lowest effective dose to  achieve 
treatment goals.  
To overcome the disadvantages of the available therapies, particularly, the lack of control of the early 
morning peak in androgen levels, new treatment approaches and GC formulations are needed that 
mimic the circadian rhythm of physiological adrenocortical secretion. Better control of the peak in 
androgen levels could lead to the prevention of long-term consequences of GC overreplacement and 
facilitate the restoration of fertility in patients who desire to have children. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This is an hybrid application for a modified-release formulation of hydrocortisone according to Article 
10(3).   
Study DIUR-004 evaluated the relative bioavailability of Efmody versus the reference product, 
hydrocortisone 20 mg tablet.   
Study DIUR-005 was a multicentre,  open-label, randomized, controlled trial to assess the efficacy and 
safety of Efmody in patients 18 years and above with  CAH due to  21-hydroxylase deficiency. The 
primary objective was to demonstrate the superior efficacy of a 24-week treatment with  Efmody 
compared to standard glucocorticoid treatment. 
Patients were randomized to either receive Efmody twice daily or stay on their respective standard 
therapy. Groups were randomized per baseline treatment strata; hydrocortisone only, 
prednisone/prednisolone or dexamethasone. Efmody start dose was the hydrocortisone equivalent of 
their pre-baseline treatment. Dose titrations  were possible based on 24-hour 17-OHP  and A4 profiles at 
week 4 and 12 and clinical symptoms (adrenal insufficiency checklist). Decisions to change the dose 
were made by a blinded independent physician.  
24-hour endocrine profiles (17-OHP and A4 levels) were measured at baseline, 4, 12 and 24 weeks. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to 24  weeks in 17-OHP, depicted as the 
unsigned standard deviation score (SDS). Secondary endpoints included change from baseline to  24 
weeks in A4 (calculated the same way as the  primary endpoint), responder analysis at 09.00  hours for 
17-OHP and A4 and changes relative to standard GC replacement therapy in  total body mass/ fat 
mass/lean mass/bone mineral density as measured by DEXA scan.  
At the end of the study, participants could then  either return to their  standard GC therapy or enter an 
open-label extension study (DIUR-006) and receive Efmody on an ongoing basis. The primary objective 
was long term safety of Efmody. Secondary efficacy variables were daily GC dose, disease control at 
09.00  and 13.00  hours and change from baseline in 17-OHP  and A4 levels. In this  study, participants 
returned to the study centre at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after starting  the study, and 6-monthly thereafter 
for follow-up assessments. Dose titration  could be performed by the investigating physician at these 
visits. Dose adjustment was to be based on clinical symptoms (adrenal insufficiency checklist) and the 
measurement of 17-OHP and A4 at 09.00  and 13.00 hours. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study DIUR-004 
In the bridging study, after administration of Efmody, serum cortisol Tmax was observed later (0.88h 
vs 4.5h),  Cmax was 17% lower and AUC 19% higher compared to the 20 mg immediate release

formulation. 
Study DIUR-005 
In the pivotal clinical study, better disease control was achieved in both treatment arms from baseline 
to week 24  as measured by 17-OHP. The unadjusted mean change from baseline (SDS) in 17-OHP  was 
-0.403  for Efmody and -0.172 for the standard GC therapy.   
In the 24 hour 17-OHP  curve, the early morning peak was reduced in the Efmody group compared to 
the standard GC group. Various post-hoc analyses were conducted on the primary efficacy variable, 
17-OHP,  which support the effect of Efmody: 
- 
The 1-sided unsigned SDS above the lower limit  of the reference range for 17-OHP at  baseline 
and week 24 showed a difference between the  treatment arms (difference in LS 
means: -0.976;  95%  CI [-1.895,-0.058];  p=0.0374).  The same was shown for the 1-sided 
unsigned SDS below the upper limit of the reference range (difference in LS means: 0.816; 
95%CI [0.094,1.539];  p=0.0272).   
-  A reduction in 17-OHP AUC in both treatment  groups throughout  the duration of the study. 
This reduction at Week 24 was greater in  the Efmody group (difference in LS means: -13.771; 
95% CI [-25.783,  -1.758];  p=0.0251). 
-  A difference between the  2 treatment groups was observed in the 07:00  to 15:00  hour profile 
(difference in LS means: -0.286;  95%  CI: [-0.564,  -0.008];  p=0.0442)  but  not in the  other 8-
hour periods.  
An increase in responders defined as the proportion of patients  having an 09.00  hour 17-OHP 
measurement within  the optimal range, was shown for Efmody; from 7.5%  at baseline to 30%  at 24 
weeks. In the standard therapy group, the proportion of responders was 30.8%  at baseline and 30% 
at week 24.  More importantly,  after 24  weeks of treatment,  48/53 (90.6%)  of patients in the  Efmody 
group had a 09.00h  17-OHP  level below 36  mmol/L, against 37/52  (71.2%) of the patients  in the 
standard therapy group.  
In addition, a post-hoc analysis showed a reduction in  A4 AUC in both  treatment groups throughout 
the study. This reduction at Week 24  was greater in the Efmody group (difference in 
LS means: -10.478;  95%  CI: [-18.696,  -2.259]; p=0.0130). 
No differences were observed for 17-OHP  and A4 (change form baseline to 24 weeks) per pre-baseline 
treatment strata.  
In the overall study population, the total  median daily GC dose per body surface area (BSA) was 
15.82  mg/m2/day in the  Efmody group and 17.04 mg/m2/day in the standard therapy group.  
Study DIUR-006 
In the long-term extension study  DUR-006, an increasing proportion of patients  achieved disease 
control as defined by 17-OHP levels (09.00  hour) being within  the optimal range while  further dose 
decreases were possible.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No data is available on patients from 12-18 years of age.  
Using the SDS to  depict the hormone levels is common practice and is accepted, however it  has 
several limitations. By taking the mean, circadian rhythms are cancelled out. The unsigned SDS does

not separate effects under or above the normal mean, a difference that might  be clinically relevant. 
The SDS is also not very sensitive to amplitude, while the treatment  is targeted at  decreasing the early 
morning peak in androgen levels.  
Study DIUR-005 
In study DIUR-005, no significant difference on the primary endpoint was observed between the 
treatment groups (difference in LS means: -0.069;  95%  CI: -0.229,  0.161;  p-value: 0.5521).  Clinical 
superiority of Cirkono over GC replacement therapy in CAH patients  was not  demonstrated.  
The aggressive titration regimen used in study DIUR-005 is not feasible in clinical practice. The 
proposed titration  suggested an emphasis on the importance of driving patients into  the reference 
range at the  cost of potential  over-replacement.   
A wide variety of post-hoc analyses were conducted on both  the primary endpoint variable and the 
secondary variables. However, there were no corrections for multiplicity.  Therefore, the differences in 
outcomes cannot be regarded as statistically different, and no claims on clinical superiority versus 
standard GC therapy can be made.  
Reference range was based on a small sample of healthy volunteers, it  is questionable whether this 
can be extrapolated to  CAH patients. The LLN  was an arbitrary limit  based on the detection  limit of the 
assay. Differences in baseline responder proportion, disease control, and the classification of patients 
ending up below the LLN  as “non-responder” were thus  difficult to interpret and no conclusions can be 
drawn on these data. 
There were no significant  differences between the  groups on clinical endpoints (total  body mass, fat 
mass, lean mass, bone mineral density, bone markers, QoL).  
The extension study DIUR-006 is still  ongoing. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the pooled analysis of patients  with CAH (pooled data from study DIUR-003, -005  (patients on 
Efmody only) and -006),  a total  of 211 treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 68  patients (56.7%). 
The most common treatment-related TEAEs by PT were fatigue (11.7%),  headache (7.5%),  and 
increased appetite (5.8%).   
The greatest differences between the Efmody and standard glucocorticoid therapy arms in the overall 
occurrence of treatment-related AEs, respectively, were observed for headache (7.5%  vs 1.6%), 
increased appetite (5.8%  vs 3.3%),  weight increase (including  abnormal weight gain) (9.2%  vs 1.6%), 
decreased appetite (5.0%  vs 0%)  and nausea (4.2% vs 1.6%).  Most of the TEAEs were mild or 
moderate. The (serious) adverse events, laboratory findings and vital signs reported are to be 
expected in a population of CAH patients treated with  corticosteroids. No unexpected adverse events, 
laboratory findings or vital signs are observed, 
The frequency of “signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or over-treatment” were higher in  the 
Efmody treated patients  (57.4%) as compared to the standard GC treatment (42.6%).  These AE were 
mainly reported during the first 12  weeks during the titration  phase of the study.  
The frequency and timing  (events/year) of adrenal crisis in the  Efmody and standard GC therapy 
appeared comparable with no major increase in the Efmody group.  
No deaths were reported in any of the clinical studies conducted with  Efmody.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
With  138 unique patients  included in the studies, the safety database of Efmody is limited, even taken 
into consideration that  CAH is a rare disease (prevalence is 1  – 9/100,00).  The follow-up of patients on 
Efmody is also very limited. Therefore, no comprehensive safety assessment can be made for Efmody.  
A strong limitation with  the three clinical CAH studies is that  all of these had an open-label design and 
were unblinded  for patients.  Thus, susceptibility to unintentional  bias in adverse effect reporting could 
not be excluded. Therefore, results especially when comparing treatment with  Efmody vs standard GC 
therapy, should be interpreted with  caution.  
No data is available on patients from 12-18 years of age.  
The patients switching  from their standard GC treatment (either hydrocortisone, prednisone, 
prednisolone or dexamethasone) to Efmody reported an unexplained higher frequency of adverse 
events (headache, increased appetite, weight increase (including  abnormal weight gain), decreased 
appetite and nausea).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efmody is developed as a modified release formulation of a known substance, hydrocortisone. The 
effect of Efmody corresponds to what would be expected of a GC replacement therapy based on overall 
effects on biomarkers 17-OHP and A4 levels. This is clinically relevant since 17-OHP  and A4 levels are 
generally used as both a diagnostic marker and to guide treatment in the management of CAH. As 17-
OHP is a precursor of A4, these variables are correlated. Complete androgen suppression is not the aim 
of treatment, the titration  regimen used in study DIUR-005 was considered too aggressive, 
overemphasizing the effect on androgens at  the cost of potential  overreplacement. Since in clinical 
practice, a more physiological dose optimization  is used, this  issue is considered adequately addressed 
through appropriate dosing recommendations in  the SmPC. In addition, despite the titration  regimen, a 
GC sparing effect was seen in the overall population. In the long-term extension study, further dose 
reductions of Efmody were possible without  losing androgen control, suggesting a more optimal 
dosing. This finding is considered of additional clinical benefit for the  patients, given the adverse 
consequences of long term GC treatment.  
No clinical superiority of Efmody was shown  over the standard GC therapy in study  DIUR-005. 17-OHP 
and A4 levels were analysed by comparing the unsigned SDS over 24 hours. Using the  SDS to depict 
the hormone levels is common practice and is accepted, however it has several limitations that   might 
have contributed  to the failure to  show clinical superiority. Nevertheless, in the 24  hour 17-OHP  curve, 
the early morning peak was reduced in the Efmody group compared to the standard GC group, 
suggesting a clinical relevant difference in favour of Efmody treatment.  Additional post-hoc analyses 
were conducted to further support the  superior efficacy of Efmody over standard therapy. These 
analyses were considered clinically relevant and supportive of the efficacy of Efmody; however, given 
the number of analyses without  corrections for multiplicity,  no conclusions on clinical superiority can be 
drawn. The primary analysis was also hampered by the strict titration  regimen guided by 17-OHP 
levels for both treatment groups.  
Nevertheless, the CHMP  considered that the  active substance of Efmody, hydrocortisone, is well known 
and recommended as the oral treatment of choice for CAH patients in the current clinical guidelines.  
The clinical characteristics of Efmody treatment (delayed release effect mimicking the physiological 
circadian rhythm, twice  daily dosing, GC sparing effect) are considered of added clinical values for CAH 
patients.  
Although adolescents (12-17 years) were not included in the studies, this  near mature population can 
be considered almost fully grown exhibiting  the same disease characteristics as adults. Based on 
literature data, the clinical profile observed in adolescents is also comparable with the adult  population. 
Therefore, extrapolation of the adult data to the  adolescents was considered acceptable by the  CHMP.  
Furthermore, when optimally treated with  Efmody the early morning androgen peak is expected to be 
lower as compared to treatment  with immediate-release hydrocortisone. This is considered an 
additional treatment improvement, especially for reducing the effect of androgens on the sexual 
development. 
A limited assessment of relevant clinical endpoints (e.g Total body mass, fat and lean mass, bone 
mineral density and quality of life outcomes) was included either as secondary or exploratory 
endpoints. However, the CHMP noted that  since both treatment groups were optimally titrated  in the 
studies and given the  short follow up time, no significant differences were observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/233437/2021 
Page 77/79 
 
 
 
 
The safety profile of Efmody was overall comparable to the well-known  safety profile of oral 
hydrocortisone. A higher AE frequency in patients  switching from their standard GC treatment to 
Efmody was noted, however this  difference could be explained by the open-label design of the study 
where patients  in the control group remained on their standard treatment, and were considered less 
prone to  report adverse events. Furthermore, the titration  of Efmody was considered less optimal, 
which could also explain part of the increased frequency of adverse events. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Despite the  pivotal study did  not demonstrate clinical superiority over standard GC replacement 
therapy, Efmody has shown to provide adequate cortisol replacement for a significant proportion of 
CAH patients in the  studies, which is expected with  an oral hydrocortisone treatment. In addition,  the 
pharmacokinetic profile of Efmody mimics the  physiological circadian rhythm, which  cannot be 
achieved with  immediate release or long-acting  GCs. The totality  of the  data suggested an improved 
androgen control with  Efmody and this  effect was considered clinically relevant; however, given the 
methodological limitations of the additional efficacy analyses, these findings could not be regarded as 
statistically significant.  The long-term data suggested the androgen balance can be largely maintained 
while further dose decreases were possible, this  finding is of additional clinical benefit, given the 
adverse consequences of long-term GC treatment.   
The reported AEs are considered in line with  those known for oral hydrocortisone.  
Overall, the clinical characteristics of Efmody treatment (delayed release effect mimicking physiological 
circadian rhythm, twice  daily dosing, GC sparing effect) were considered of added clinical values for 
CAH patients. Thus, the  CHMP concluded that Efmody can be regarded as an additional  treatment 
option next to the  standard of care.  
4.  Recommendation 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that  Efmody is not similar to Plenadren within  the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that  the benefit-risk balance of Efmody is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in adolescents aged 12  years and over and adults. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

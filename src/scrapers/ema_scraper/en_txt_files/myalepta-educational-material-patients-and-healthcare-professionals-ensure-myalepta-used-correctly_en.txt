Educational material for patients and healthcare 
professionals to ensure Myalepta is used correctly 
Material will include training video on how to prepare and give medicine 
Educational materials will be provided to patients and healthcare professionals to ensure that the 
medicine Myalepta (metreleptin) is prepared and injected correctly, and to prevent the risk of 
medication errors. 
Myalepta is a medicine used to treat lipodystrophy, where patients have loss of fatty tissue under the 
skin and build-up of fat elsewhere in the body such as in the liver and muscles. Myalepta is given as a 
daily injection under the skin of the abdomen (belly), thigh or upper arm. The medicine comes as a vial 
of powder to which water is added to make a solution for injection. The recommended daily dose 
depends on the patient’s bodyweight and sex, which the doctor can then adjust based on the patient’s 
response to treatment. Patients, their parents or carers can inject the medicine once they have been 
trained by their doctor or nurse.  
With each vial of Myalepta the pharmacist will dispense an ampoule or vial of water for injection to 
prepare the solution as well as two syringes (one to make up the medicine and one to give it) and 
needles.  
Using the wrong syringe to make up the medicine or not withdrawing the correct dose could cause 
dosing errors. This might result in the patient receiving too much or too little of the active substance. 
In addition giving the medicine in the muscle instead of under the skin could lead to the medicine 
being absorbed faster than recommended which can change the effects of the medicine. 
To avoid medication errors, healthcare professionals and patients will be given educational material 
with detailed instructions on how to prepare the solution and how to inject the correct dose. This 
includes written training materials as well as a video with instructions on how to prepare the solution 
for injection and how to inject it.   
More information on Myalepta can be found on the Agency’s website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine.

Together with the vial containing Myalepta powder, your pharmacist will give you a vial or ampoule 
of water for injection as well as a 3 ml syringe. You will need to use the 3 ml syringe to withdraw 
the water from the vial or ampoule and transfer it into the vial containing Myalepta powder. Your 
pharmacist will give you detailed instructions on how to do this. 
Your pharmacist will also give you a second syringe (the size of syringe to use varies depending on 
the dose prescribed and is either 0.3 mL, 1.0 mL or 2.5 mL ) that you must use to give the 
injection.  Once you have made up the solution you must draw the amount prescribed by your 
doctor (this may be in units or in ml depending on the syringe) using the second syringe. Your 
pharmacist will give you detailed instructions on how to do this. Any remaining solution should be 
discarded. 
You must then inject the medicine under the skin. It is important that you follow the instructions 
given to you by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
You should speak to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you have any questions about your 
treatment. 
Information for healthcare professionals

The recommended daily dose depends on the patient’s bodyweight and sex as shown in the 
following table, and is adjusted based on the patient’s response to treatment. The dose should be 
prescribed in both milligrams and milliliters:

Patients, their parents or carers can inject the medicine once they have been trained. They must 
however always prepare and give the first dose under supervision of the doctor or nurse. Patients 
should be reviewed every 6 months to ensure that their injection technique is correct. With every 
prescription of Myalepta the pharmacist should dispense: 
  Water for injection to reconstitute the powder (2.2 ml of water for injection are needed);

  A 3 ml syringe (21 gauge and 40 mm) to draw up the water for injection and reconstitute 
the powder.  
  A second syringe to inject the dose. The size of the syringe depends on the dose prescribed 
and is determined as follows:

 (≤ 0.3 mL)

  The pharmacist must also dispense the corresponding needles, alcohol swabs and sharps 
bin.  
Healthcare professionals must carefully explain to the patient or carer how the solution for injection is 
prepared and how the prescribed dose should be measured (in ml or units). In order to convert the 
dose for the 0.3 mL U100 insulin syringe the following table should be used:

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
About the product 
The  proposed  product  is  an  immediate  release  film-coated  tablets  containing  Sildenafil  citrate  as  active 
substance. Sildenafil citrate dosage form has been  developed as generic product to the centrally authorised 
product Revatio 20 mg film-coated tablets containing the same active substance in the same pharmaceutical 
form. 
Sildenafil  is  a  potent  and  selective  inhibitor  of  cyclic  guanosine  monophosphate  (cGMP)  specific 
phosphodiesterase  type  5  (PDE5),  the  enzyme  that  is  responsible  for  degradation  of  cGMP.  Apart  from  the 
presence  of  this  enzyme  in  the  corpus  cavernosum  of  the  penis,  PDE5  is  also  present  in  the  pulmonary 
vasculature. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in 
relaxation.  In  patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  this  can  lead  to  vasodilation  of  the  pulmonary 
vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation.  
Sildenafil is approved in the EU for the treatment: 
Adults 
Treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, 
to  improve  exercise  capacity.  Efficacy  has  been  shown  in  primary  pulmonary  hypertension  and  pulmonary 
hypertension associated with connective tissue disease. 
Paediatric population 
Assessment report  
EMA/645375/2016 
Page 7/25 
 
  
  
Treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Efficacy in 
terms  of  improvement  of  exercise  capacity  or  pulmonary  haemodynamics  has  been  shown  in  primary 
pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease. 
Proposed posology and method of administration 
Adults 
The recommended dose is 20 mg three times a day (TID). 
Paediatric population (1 year to 17 years) 
For  paediatric  patients  aged  1  year  to  17  years  old,  the  recommended  dose  in  patients  ≤  20  kg  is  10  mg  
three  times  a  day  and  for  patients  >  20  kg  is  20  mg    three  times  a  day.  Higher  than  recommended  doses 
should  not  be  used  in  paediatric  patients  with  PAH.  The  20 mg  tablet  should  not  be  used  in  cases  where 
10 mg  TID  should  be  administered  in  younger  patients.  Other  pharmaceutical  forms  are  available  for 
administration to patients ≤ 20 kg and other younger patients who are not able to swallow tablets. 
Patients using other medicinal products 
In  general,  any  dose  adjustment  should  be  administered  only  after  a  careful  benefit-risk  assessment.  A 
downward dose adjustment to 20 mg twice daily should be considered when sildenafil is co-administered to 
patients already receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors like erythromycin or saquinavir. A downward dose adjustment to 
20  mg  once  daily  is  recommended  in  case  of  co-administration  with  more  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors 
clarithromycin,  telithromycin  and  nefazodone.  Dose  adjustments  for  sildenafil  may  be  required  when  co-
administered with CYP3A4 inducers. 
Special populations 
Elderly (≥ 65 years) 
Dose  adjustments  are  not  required  in  elderly  patients.  Clinical  efficacy  as  measured  by  6-minute  walk 
distance could be less in elderly patients. 
Renal impairment  
Initial  dose  adjustments  are  not  required  in  patients  with  renal  impairment,  including  severe  renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min). A downward dose adjustment to 20 mg twice daily should be 
considered after a careful benefit-risk assessment only if therapy is not well-tolerated. 
Hepatic impairment 
Initial dose adjustments are not required in patients with hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and B). A 
downward dose adjustment to 20 mg twice daily should be considered after a careful benefit-risk assessment 
only if therapy is not well-tolerated. 
Sildenafil is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 
Paediatric population 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  sildenafil  in  children  below  1  year  of  age  has  not  been  established.  No  data  are 
available. 
Method of administration 
Assessment report  
EMA/645375/2016

Granpidam  is  for  oral  use  only.  Tablets  should  be  taken  approximately  6  to  8  hours  apart  with  or  without 
food. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  was  submitted  under  Article  3(3)  of  Regulation  EC  726/2004 
“Generic  of  a  Centrally  Authorised  Medicinal  Product”  and  article  10(1)  Generic  Application  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC, as amended.  
The reference medicinal product is Revatio 20mg tablets by the company Pfizer, originally authorised in the 
community on 28 October 2005 (marketing authorisation numbers EU/1/05/318/001 and EU/05/318/004) 
Bioequivalence with the product Viagra 100 mg (sildenafil citrate) tablets by the company Pfizer is claimed, 
the applicant has requested a biowaiver for the 20 mg tablets presentation of sildenafil citrate. 
The CHMP Guidelines were followed. The applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the 
clinical investigation. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction

d]pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-4-methylpiperazine citrate corresponding to the molecular 
formula C22H30N6O4S.C6H8O7. It has a relative molecular mass of 666.71 g/mol and the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/645375/2016 
Page 9/25 
 
  
  
As there is a monograph of sildenafil citrate in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of the active 
substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for sildenafil 
citrate which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Proof of structure has been provided in the CEP. The active substance is a white or almost white, slightly 
hygroscopic crystalline powder, slightly soluble in water. It is achiral. The manufacturing route routinely 
delivers the proposed commercial polymorphic form as documented in the CEP. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information on manufacture, characterisation, process controls, and the container closure 
system was assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes the specification parameters and test methods described in the 
Ph. Eur. monograph and CEP for Sildenafil Citrate, along with a number of additional specification 
parameters. The following parameters are tested: appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), identity of citrate (colour 
test), polymorphic form (XRD), water content (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), 
impurities (Ph. Eur. and HPLC), assay (HPLC), citric acid content (titrimetry), residual solvents (GC) and 
microbiological examination (Ph. Eur.). No limit for particle size is necessary as this was demonstrated not to 
impact the performance (i.e. dissolution) of the finished product. 
All non-compendial methods have been adequately validated and described according to ICH Q2. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three pilot to production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on ten batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended 
commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. Stability data on four of these batches stored for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) were also provided. Samples were tested, in accordance with active substance 
specification, for identity, water content, impurities, polymorphic form and assay. A commitment to test 
microbiological quality at the end of the re-test period was deemed acceptable. The analytical methods used 
Assessment report  
EMA/645375/2016 
Page 10/25 
 
  
  
 
were the same as for release and are stability indicating. All test results were in compliance with the active 
substance specification throughout the duration of the studies. 
Forced degradation studies were carried out on solid samples exposed to heat, UV light and sunlight, and in 
acidic, neutral, basic and oxidizing aqueous solutions. While significant degradation occurs under oxidizing 
conditions and acid causes slight degradation, sildenafil citrate proved stable under all other stressed 
conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 60 months in the proposed container without 
special storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Granpidam is presented as 20 mg white to off-white round, biconvex film-coated tablets debossed with “20” 
on one face. 
Development work was aimed at producing a robust, stable solid oral dosage form bioequivalent to the 
reference product Revatio and with an equivalent dissolution profile. Sildenafil citrate is slightly soluble in 
water but more so under acidic conditions of the stomach and is considered to be BCS class I. Particle size 
distribution was found not to impact dissolution, other than a slight reduction at early time-points. Complete 
dissolution is observed within 15 minutes under acidic conditions and thus no limit for particle size is applied 
to the active substance. Since sildenafil citrate has poor flow properties, a wet granulation process was 
selected. 
Excipients were chosen based on the reference product and compatibility studies. The excipient content is 
qualitatively similar to Revatio with the addition of hypromellose as a binder. All excipients are well known 
pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. 
Various studies were carried out in order to optimise the relative amounts of excipients and to determine 
appropriate lubrication, compression and coating parameters. 
Assessment report  
EMA/645375/2016 
Page 11/25 
 
  
  
The dissolution method was developed by investigating different media and apparatus. While rapid 
dissolution was observed at pH 1.2 and 4.5, sink conditions were not possible at pH 6.8 without the addition 
of a surfactant. The latter conditions were selected as the QC method. Being a BCS class I compound, 
absorption of sildenafil is liable to be impacted by disintegration time and thus the discriminatory power of 
the dissolution method was investigated using batches containing less and no disintegrant. Significant 
differences in dissolution rate were shown at early time points. 
Four quantitatively proportional tablet strengths were developed, as sildenafil is used at different doses to 
treat PAH (20 mg, Revatio) and erectile dysfunction (Viagra, 25, 50 and 100 mg). A bioequivalence study 
was carried out using 100 mg tablets of Granpidam, with 100 mg Viagra tablets as a comparator, and 
bioequivalence was thus demonstrated. The use of Viagra as comparator was deemed acceptable as Revatio 
and Viagra are qualitatively and quantitatively identical, except for the colour of the non-functional film 
coating. Comparison of in vitro dissolution was carried out between the Granpidam 100 mg biobatch and 
Viagra. Rapid dissolution (>85% in 15 mins) of both at pH 1.2, 4.5 and under QC conditions was 
demonstrated. Significantly slower dissolution was observed at pH 6.8 without surfactant (non-sink 
conditions) for the biobatch compared to Viagra, reflecting the slower disintegration of Granpidam tables. 
A proportionality biowaiver was requested for the 20 mg tablets applied for in this MAA given that they have 
the same relative composition as the 100 mg tablets and that sildenafil citrate is BCS class I. The dissolution 
profiles of 20 mg Granpidam tablets were compared to those of 100 mg Granpidam tablets and 20 mg 
Revatio tablets under various conditions. Rapid dissolution of all three tested products was observed at pH 
1.2, 4.5 and under QC conditions. At pH 6.8 without surfactant, complete dissolution did not occur for any of 
the tested products but the profiles are considered similar based on calculated f 2 values. Therefore, the 
proportionality biowaiver is considered acceptable. 
The  primary  packaging  is  PVC/Alu  blisters.  The  materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC  requirements.  The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended 
use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of six main steps: blending of intra-granular excipients, wet granulation 
followed  by  drying  and  sizing,  blending  with  extra-granular  excipients,  compression,  film-coating  and 
packing. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The main steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three consecutive batches of blended 
granules and subsequently compressed film-coated tablets. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-
process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  including 
appearance, average weight of tablets (in house), identity (UV, HPLC), identity of citrate counter ion (colour 
test), identity of titanium dioxide (colour test), dissolution (UV), water content (Ph. Eur.), impurities (HPLC), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), assay (UV) and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.).

Specification  limits  for  impurities  are  below  the  qualification  threshold.  There  are  no  new  impurities  as 
compared to the active substance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  three  production  scale  batches  of  finished  product  from  the  proposed  manufacturer  and 
stored  for  up  to  60  months  under  long  term  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated 
conditions  (40  ºC  /  75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  medicinal 
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. 
Samples were tested for description, dissolution, water content, impurities, assay and microbiological quality. 
The  analytical  procedures  used  are  stability  indicating.  No  significant  changes  to  any  of  the  measured 
parameters under either condition were observed. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug  Substances  and  Products.  No  significant  changes  to  any  of  the  measured  parameters  were  observed, 
indicating that Granpidam tablets are photostable. 
Data  on  three  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  6  months  in  bulk  in  a  polypropylene  co-polymer 
(PPCP)  container  was  also  provided.  The  results  support  a  bulk  holding  time  of  6  months  in  the  PPCP 
container. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 60 months without specific storage conditions as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
Magnesium stearate and triacetin are of vegetal origin. No other excipients derived from animal or human 
origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

The product has been shown to be bioequivalent to the reference product and a strength biowaiver has been 
deemed adequate. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
•  microbiological quality of the active substance should be tested at the end of its re-test period. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Granpidam manufactured by Accord Healthcare Limited is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all sildenafil containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview on the pre-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology is adequate. 
A valid justification for not submitting ERA is given. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of Granpidam from a non-clinical point of view.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for tablets containing sildenafil. To support the marketing authorisation application, the 
applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design under fasting conditions. This study was 
the pivotal study for the assessment. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) as 
well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09) and Question number 
10 of the Questions & Answers: Positions on specific questions addressed to the Pharmacokinetics Working 
Party (PKWP) EMA/618604/2008 Rev. 13 are of particular relevance.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption  
This application for marketing authorisation is for the 20 mg sildenafil strength. One bioequivalence study 
was conducted on the 100 mg strength and a biowaiver is requested for the 20 mg strength.  
The results of study 084-09 with 100 mg formulation could be extrapolated to the other strength 20 mg, 
according to conditions in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1/Corr**). 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
To support the application, the applicant has submitted one (1) bioequivalence study. 
Methods 
Study design 
The study was an open label, balanced, randomised, laboratory-blinded, two-sequence, two-treatment, two-
period, single oral dose, cross-over bioequivalence study comparing two different formulations of sildenafil 
100 mg tablets in healthy, adult human male subjects under fasting conditions. 
Test and reference products 
Sildenafil citrate 100 mg film-coated tablets by Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India  has been compared to 
VIAGRA® 100 mg film-coated tablets by Pfizer PGM (from the UK market). 
Population(s) studied 
Thirty-six (36) healthy adult male subjects were randomised and dosed. There was one dropout from the 
study. Thirty-five (35) subjects completed both periods of the study and were included in the final statistical 
analysis of AUC and C max.  
Analytical methods 
A LC-MS/MS method for the determination of sildenafil concentration in K2EDTA human plasma was validated 
pre-study and within study.         
A detailed description of the operative procedures was provided. The validation of the method and extended 
stability evaluation was performed and a detailed description of the validation process was provided.  
In conclusion, the analytical method allowed a suitable investigation of the bioavailability of sildenafil after 
oral administration.   
Pharmacokinetic Variables 
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters C max, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-∞ and the secondary pharmacokinetic 
parameters T max, λ Z, t1/2 and AUC_%Extrap_Obs were estimated for sildenafil by a standard non-
compartmental model using WinNonlin Professional Software Version 5.0.1 (Pharsight Corporation, USA). 
Standard methods were used. 
Statistical methods 
Assessment report  
EMA/645375/2016 
Page 16/25 
 
  
  
 
Analysis of variance was carried out by employing PROC MIXED of SAS® Release 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc., 
USA) for un-transformed and ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters C max, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for 
sildenafil. ANOVA model included sequence, formulation and period as fixed effects and subject (sequence) as 
a random effect. Sequence effect was tested using subject (sequence) as error term.  
Two one-sided tests for bioequivalence and 90% confidence interval for both the un-transformed and ln-
transformed ratios of the least squares mean between the formulations were calculated for sildenafil. Ratio of 
least squares means of test and reference formulation was computed for un-transformed and ln-transformed 
pharmacokinetic parameters C max, AUC 0-t and AUC0-∞ for sildenafil.  
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence: 
Bioequivalence of the test product B vs. the reference product A was concluded, if the 90% confidence 
interval for the ratio of the least square means for the ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters C max, 
AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞ for sildenafil fell within the acceptance range of 80.00-125.00%.

The test product B (Sildenafil Citrate Tablets 100 mg – Manufactured by Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd., India ) 
when compared with the reference product A (Viagra®, Sildenafil Citrate Tablets 100 mg – Manufactured by 
Pfizer PGM France, Marketing Authorisation Holder – Pfizer Limited, UK) under fasting conditions meets the 
bioequivalence criteria with respect to the rate and extent of absorption of sildenafil.  
Safety data 
A total of four post-dose adverse events (AEs) (headache, vomiting and pruritus) were reported by three 
subjects during the conduct of the study. One AE was reported in a subject who had received the reference 
product and three AEs were reported in subjects who had received the test product. All the AEs were mild in 
nature and were followed up till resolution. Two AEs (headache and pruritus) required treatment with 
medication (paracetamol 500 mg and cetirizine 10 mg, respectively) prior to resolution.  
Data from this study demonstrated that both the test and the reference drugs were well tolerated. There 
were no serious and significant adverse events reported during the course of the study. There were no 
clinically significant findings in the vital signs assessment, the laboratory tests and ECGs.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetic conclusion 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Granpidam 100 mg film-coated tablets are considered 
bioequivalent with Viagra® 100 mg film-coated tablets. The applicant is applying for the marketing 
authorisation of the 20 mg strength only and therefore requesting a biowaiver for the 20 mg strength. The 
results of study 084-09 with 100 mg formulation could be extrapolated to the 20 mg strength, according to 
conditions in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr**).   
The  acceptability of the biowaiver is further discussed below. 
2.4.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.5.  Additional data 
In vitro dissolution tests complementary to the bioequivalence study 
Assessment report  
EMA/645375/2016 
Page 18/25 
 
  
  
 
 
Comparative dissolution tests were conducted between the 100 mg strength of the test and reference  
biobatches in 0.01N HCl, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. 
In 0.01N HCl and pH 4.5 acetate buffer more than 85% was dissolved in 15 min for both products. At pH 6.8 
phosphate buffer the The calculated f 2 value is 27 and the dissolution profiles can thus not be considered 
comparable. However, a valid justification for the discrepancy has been addressed and justified.The results of 
comparative in vitro dissolution do not reflect bioequivalence as demonstrated in vivo. 
In vitro dissolution tests in support of biowaiver of strengths 
Comparative dissolution tests were conducted between the 100 mg test biobatch and 20 mg test product 
(different batches) in 0.01N HCl, pH 4.5 acetate buffer and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. 
In 0.01N HCl and pH 4.5 acetate buffer more than 85% was dissolved in 15 min for all tested products. At pH 
6.8 phosphate buffer the calculated f 2 value was 53 and thus the dissolution profiles can be considered 
similar.  
In conclusion the data provided support the biowaiver request. 
2.4.6.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.7.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This is a generic application for the marketing authorisation of Granpidam 20 mg film-coated tablets. One 
bioequivalence study on the 100 mg strength is submitted to support the application and a biowaiver is 
requested for the 20 mg strength.  
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Granpidam 100 mg film-coated tablets are considered 
bioequivalent with Viagra® 100 mg film-coated tablets. It is acceptable to use Viagra 100mg as it contains 
the same active substance as Revatio. However the strength differs (see below discussion on the biowaiver). 
The applicant is applying for the marketing authorisation of the 20 mg strength only and therefore requesting 
a biowaiver for the 20 mg strength. The results of study 084-09 with 100 mg formulation can be extrapolated 
to the 20 mg strength, according to conditions in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr**). 
It is acknowledged that the study #084-09 and validation of the analytical method were conducted before the 
Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev.1 Corr. 2**) came into 
force and ISR was not preformed. The applicant has provided a valid justification of the lack of ISR data in 
line with Question 10. Requirement to perform incurred sample reanalysis of Questions & Answers: positions 
on specific questions addressed to the Pharmacokinetics Working Party (PKWP) (EMA/618604/2008 Rev. 13). 
The bioanalytical method can be considered reliable and thus the study results are considered acceptable.  
Thus the biowaiver request is acceptable.

2.4.8.  Conclusions on clinical aspects  
The application contains an adequate review of published clinical data and the bioequivalence has been 
shown between Granpidam and Viagra® 100 mg film-coated tablets. A biowaiver for the 20 mg strength is 
considered acceptable. 
Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Granpidam is considered bioequivalent with Viagra (reference 
product used).  
The results of study 084-09 with 100mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths 20mg, according 
to conditions in the Guidelines.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 3.0 is acceptable.  
2.6.  PSUR submission 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found  acceptable for the following reasons: 
Except MAH specific details, all the critical /less critical sections are identical to that of reference PIL and 
therefore the key messages including all safety messages are exactly same for both the PIL. As the complete 
text is adopted from reference package leaflet, difference in design and layout, if any, will not have any 
impact on readability. 
Based on the above justification the daughter PIL is considered comparable with the parent PIL and assessed 
as readable in compliance with Articles 59(3) and 63(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of Revatio 20 mg film coated tablets. The reference product 
Revatio is indicated for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this 
application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the active substance was 
Assessment report  
EMA/645375/2016 
Page 23/25 
 
  
  
presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data 
on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; 
the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was 
considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the 
bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. The study was 
an open label, balanced, randomised, laboratory-blinded, two-sequence, two-treatment, two-period, single 
oral dose, cross-over bioequivalence study comparing two different formulations of sildenafil 100 mg tablets 
in healthy, adult human male subjects under fasting conditions. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall 
sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. Of note the reference product used was Viagra 
100mg. Viagra contains the same active substance as Revatio , the reference product for this application. The 
strength used is 100 mg compared to the 20 mg applied for in the PAH indication.  A biowaiver has been 
submitted and is considered applicable. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical 
methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Grandipam met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with 
the 100 mg tablet Viagra. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, 
AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 
125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus decision 
that the benefit-risk balance of Granpidam is favourable in the following indication: 
Adults 
Treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, 
to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary 
hypertension associated with connective tissue disease. 
Paediatric population 
Treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Efficacy in 
terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary haemodynamics has been shown in primary 
pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease (see section 
5.1).

The concept of spondyloarthritis (SpA) as described in the EU Guideline (EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 
Rev.1, Corr 1) comprises a group of diseases which share common clinical and genetic features, and 
includes ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, arthritis/spondylitis with inflammatory bowel 
disease, reactive arthritis, as well as undifferentiated SpA. All of these can present with a 
predominantly peripheral or axial arthritis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 7/103 
 
 
 
 
 
Axial SpA (axSpA) is defined as a chronic inflammatory disease that involves primarily the sacroiliac 
joints and the axial skeleton. Clinical manifestations usually begin in late adolescence or early 
adulthood (mean age of onset 26 years) and onset after age 45 is rare. Clinical manifestations include 
lower back pain with predominant nocturnal pain, morning stiffness and impaired physical function. 
Also chest pain, pain and swelling of peripheral joints and extra-articular tenderness may occur as well 
as several extra-skeletal manifestations such as anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel 
disease. 
The diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, the most frequent subtype of axial SpA, requires the presence 
of radiographic sacroiliitis. However, it is now well established that patients with axial SpA who do not 
meet radiographic criteria for sacroiliitis may experience a significant burden of disease that is 
comparable to patients with well-defined AS. The 2009 ASAS criteria thus define the entity of axial 
spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) which includes a broader set of patients than the original 1984 criteria for 
AS. The new group is captured under the term “non-radiographic axial SpA” and can be identified by 
the presence of clinical features of axial SpA combined with either “imaging” evidence (active 
sacroiliitis seen on the MRI scan) or HLA-B27 positivity (“clinical arm”). 
The prevalence of axial SpA (including AS and non-radiographic forms) is estimated to be 0.3-0.8%. 
The prevalence of AS is estimated around 0.1 % - 0.5 % of the European population. While AS is more 
common in males (male to female ratio is estimated to be 2-3:1), women are slightly more often 
affected compared to men in the nr-axSpA stage. AxSpA tends to be more severe in men, in whom the 
spine is more frequently involved. 
Management 
According to clinical guidelines, physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
comprise the first line treatment in axial SpA. Physical therapy has a positive effect on stiffness and on 
spinal mobility and even on pain. NSAIDs are used to control pain with good response in up to 50-70% 
of axial SpA patients, and due to their high symptomatic efficacy and possible disease-modifying 
properties, NSAIDs are considered the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with axial SpA 
and if tolerated, these are usually maintained as background therapy in patients with insufficient 
response. 
Several biological products, including anti-TNF agents and secukinumab, are authorised for use in 
patients with AS who continue to have active disease despite NSAIDs. In Europe, several anti-TNF 
agents (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept and golimumab) are also authorised for nr-axSpA 
with objective signs of inflammation. 
Whereas anti-TNF agents have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of nr-axSpA, a 
substantial proportion of patients do not show a good therapeutic response to these agents. The 
impact of these agents on axSpA-associated structural damage and diseases progression also remains 
to be established. There is a need for new therapies, including therapies with alternative mechanisms 
of action beyond TNF inhibition. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Cosentyx (secukinumab) is a fully human monoclonal anti-human interleukin-17A (IL-17A) antibody of 
the Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)/κ-class. It binds to IL-17A and neutralises the activity of this cytokine. 
Cosentyx was initially approved in the EU for the treatment of plaque psoriasis on 15 Jan 2015; 
indications for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were approved on 19 Nov 2015. 
Cosentyx is currently approved in over 90 countries worldwide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 8/103 
 
 
 
The AS indication was originally approved within procedure EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0002. This approval 
was based on studies CAIN457F2305 and F2310, and the approved indication reads as follows: 
“Cosentyx is indicated for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis in adults who have responded 
inadequately to conventional therapy.” 
The originally approved posology was based on a 150 mg monthly maintenance dose. More recently, a 
third AS study (CAIN457F2314) was assessed within procedure EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0051, for which 
a positive CHMP opinion was adopted in September 2019. Study F2314 provided support for a higher 
300 mg maintenance dose, and as a result, the revised posology for AS reads as follows: 
“The recommended dose is 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 
and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Based on clinical response, the dose can be increased 
to 300 mg. Each 300 mg dose is given as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg.” 
2.1.3.  The development programme 
The current submission provides data from an ongoing Phase 3 study (Study CAIN457H2315 or 
PREVENT; hereinafter H2315) in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). 
According to the MAH, patients with nr-axSpA can progress to develop AS, and nr-axSpA along with AS 
should therefore be considered to be part of the spectrum of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). In the 
MAH’s opinion, the submitted study provides evidence that secukinumab demonstrates clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant efficacy in patients with active nr-axSpA, including in those who 
have previously had an inadequate response to TNF-alpha inhibitors, and that the safety data observed 
in Study H2315 confirm the established safety profile of secukinumab and demonstrate that no new 
safety signals arise from this patient population. Accordingly, the purpose of this submission is to 
provide evidence supporting the registration of a 150 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) dose (with loading) of 
secukinumab for the treatment of patients with active nr-axSpA. 
The indication and posology proposed by the MAH were as follows: 
“Secukinumab is indicated for the treatment of active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with 
objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) evidence in adults who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).” 
The recommended dose is 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 
and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As a monoclonal antibody, secukinumab is exempt from testing in accordance with the current CHMP 
guideline (CHMP/SWP/4447/00) on environmental risk assessment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 9/103 
 
 
 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This single study submission comprises a clinical study report from an ongoing randomised, placebo-
controlled Phase 3 study assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two different regimens of 
secukinumab, 150 mg with loading and without loading, compared to placebo in patients with nr-
axSpA. It should be noted that the MAH is not applying for authorisation for the regimen without 
loading. 
The study population consists of adult patients fulfilling the ASAS classification criteria for axSpA as 
well as an abnormal CRP and/or evidence of inflammation in the sacroiliac joints (SI-joints) on MRI, 
but with no radiographic evidence of changes in the SI-joints that would meet the modified New York 
criteria for AS. Patients were stratified at randomisation according to the subgroup of objective signs of 
inflammation they belong to. Patients who had experienced an inadequate response to a TNF inhibitor 
were allowed entry into the study, but inclusion of TNF-IR patients was limited to no more than 20% of 
the overall randomised population. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics in main study 
In Study H2315, secukinumab concentrations were assessed in serum. At Week 4 in the Load arm, the 
mean serum concentration at trough was approximately 5-fold higher than in the No Load arm and 
reflected the rise in exposure due to the 3 additional 150 mg doses at Weeks 1, 2 and 3. At Week 16, 
the mean trough serum concentration was approximately 40% higher in the Load group compared to 
the No Load group. By Week 52, similar mean trough serum concentrations were observed in all 
groups, including the group that had initially been randomised to placebo and switched to active 
medication from Week 20 onward. Table 1 display mean trough concentrations in all treatment groups 
from Week 0 to Week 52.

Table 1 Serum secukinumab (AIN457) concentrations (mcg/mL) summary statistics up to Week 52 
(FAS) 
Immunogenicity results in main study 
In Study H2315, anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were observed in a total of eight patients. Among these, six 
patients had ADA at baseline only. One patient had a positive result at baseline and at Week 16 and 52, 
and one patient had treatment-emergent ADA only at Week 52. 
One  patient had  an  AE  (dermatitis  contact)  that  was  potentially  related to immunogenicity;  this non-
serious AE occurred at Day 522 in a patient with ADA detected at baseline. No influence of ADAs on PK 
was observed among the four patients in whom assessable PK data was available. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No separate clinical pharmacology studies were submitted as part of the current application. In study 
H2315, trough concentrations of secukinumab in serum were within the expected range, and by Week 
52, steady state appeared to have been reached also among patients who were initially randomised to 
placebo and switched to secukinumab from Week 20 onward. 
Immunogenicity results are consistent with observations from the programmes in Pso and AS and 
continue to indicate a relatively low immunogenic potential for secukinumab. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Reported pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity data from study H2315 are consistent with previous 
observations within other secukinumab development programmes. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dedicated dose response studies were performed. The previously completed Phase 3 studies in AS 
(F2310 and F2305) were used to support selection of the dosing regimen for Study H2315.

2.4.2.  Main study 
CAIN457H2315 “A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study of secukinumab 150 
mg in patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability and efficacy up to 2 years, followed by an optional phase of either 150 mg or 300 mg 
randomised dose escalation for up to another 2 years” 
The study is also referred to by the acronym PREVENT. 
Methods 
Study  H2315  is  an  ongoing  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study,  consisting  of  a  core 
phase (up to Week 104) and an extension phase (Week 104 to Week 208). An outline of the study design 
is displayed in Figure 1. Two separate analysis plans were specified for the study to support regulatory 
filings in different jurisdictions. Analysis Plan A (to support a filing in EU) assesses the primary endpoint 
at Week 16, whereas Analysis Plan B (to support a filing in the US) assesses the primary endpoint at 
Week 52. 
Figure 1 Study design of the core phase 
A first interim data cut-off for the study was done on 17 December 2018, when all patients had completed 
24 weeks of treatment, and this 24-week database was subsequently locked on 22 February 2019; data 
from this database lock (supporting Analysis Plan A) forms the basis of the current submission. At the 
time of the first data cut-off, 71.5% of enrolled patients had reached their Week 52 visit, and an interim 
analysis for the Week 52 time point (Analysis Plan B) was performed for these patients. These data were 
also included in the initial submission. 
A second data cut-off was done on 01 July 2019, when all patients had completed 52 weeks of treatment, 
and the database for this cut-off was subsequently locked on 13 September 2019. Analyses of the Week 
52 time point (supporting Analysis Plan B) were repeated for the full patient population, and the updated 
results were submitted for review during the assessment process. Analyses under Analysis Plan A were 
not repeated. 
No data from the extension phase are included in the submission.

Eligible  patients  were  randomised  to  one  of  3  treatment  groups  (secukinumab  150  mg  Load, 
secukinumab 150 mg No Load, or placebo) in a ratio of 1:1:1. 
•  Group 1 (secukinumab 150 mg Load): secukinumab 150 mg (1 mL, 150 mg/mL) s.c. prefilled 
syringe (PFS) at baseline, Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by administration every 4 weeks starting 
at Week 4 
•  Group 2 (secukinumab 150 mg No Load): secukinumab 150 mg (1 mL, 150 mg/mL) s.c. PFS at 
baseline,  placebo  at  Weeks  1,  2  and  3,  followed  by  secukinumab  150  mg  PFS  administration 
every 4 weeks starting at Week 4 
•  Group 3 (placebo): placebo (1 mL) s.c. PFS at baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3, followed by administration 
every 4 weeks starting at Week 4 
From Week 16 onward, background medications, such as NSAIDs and DMARDs, could be modified or 
added to treat signs and symptoms of nr-axSpA, based on the clinical judgment of disease activity by 
the Investigator and the patient. 
Furthermore, from Week 20 onward, patients who were repeatedly (e.g., at 2 or more consecutive visits) 
considered  to  be  inadequate  responders,  based  on  the  clinical  judgment  of  disease  activity  by  the 
Investigator and the patient, could receive open-label secukinumab 150 mg s.c. or other biologics as 
standard  of  care  treatment.  Patients  switching  to  a  biologic  therapy  (e.g.  anti-TNF)  other  than 
secukinumab were not to receive any further study medication and had to observe a 12 week wash out 
period after the last application of study treatment prior to starting any other biologic treatment. 
Starting at Week 52, all patients were assigned to receive secukinumab 150 mg s.c. in an open-label 
fashion except for those patients who discontinued study treatment (secukinumab 150 mg or placebo) 
during the initial 52 weeks of the study.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
In Analysis Plan A, the primary efficacy variable of this study was response to treatment according to 
the ASAS40 criteria at Week 16 in TNF-alpha naïve patients. The analysis of the primary variable was 
based on the FAS population. The ASAS Response Criteria (ASAS40) were defined as an improvement 
of ≥ 40% and ≥ 2 unit on a scale of 10 in at least 3 of the 4 main domains and no worsening at all in 
the remaining domain. 
In Analysis Plan B, the primary efficacy variable was response to treatment according to the ASAS40 
criteria at Week 52 in TNF-alpha naïve patients. The analysis of the primary variable was based on the 
FAS population at the Week 52 DBL. 
Secondary endpoints 
Secondary efficacy variables for Analysis Plan A included: 
•  Response to treatment according to the ASAS40 criteria at Week 16 
•  Response to treatment according to the ASAS 5/6 criteria at Week 16 
•  Change from baseline in total BASDAI score at Week 16 
•  Response to treatment at Week 16 according to the BASDAI50 criteria 
•  Change from baseline in hsCRP at Week 16 
•  Change from baseline in total BASFI score at Week 16 
•  Change from screening in MRI SI joint edema score at Week 16 
o  According to the MAH, MRI images of the SI joints and the spine were acquired according 
to a specific imaging charter and read by trained central readers. The scoring methods 
used were the Berlin Active Inflammatory Lesions Scoring for the SI-joints and the Berlin 
score, a validated MRI scoring method of the spine. 
•  Response to treatment according to the ASAS20 criteria at Week 16 
•  Change from baseline in SF-36 PCS score at Week 16 
•  Change from baseline in ASQoL score at Week 16 
•  Response to treatment at Week 16 according to the ASAS partial remission 
The secondary efficacy variables were analysed using the FAS population.

For  Analysis  Plan  B,  response  to  treatment  was  assessed  at  both  Week  16  and  at  Week  52,  using 
variables corresponding to Analysis Plan A. 
Exploratory endpoints 
Treatment responses on ASDAS criteria endpoints and spinal mobility on BASMI were evaluated within 
the exploratory analyses. 
Sample size 
A total of 555 patients were to be enrolled into the study. 
The statistical power calculation for Analysis Plan A was based on an expected ASAS40 response rate 
of 47.1% for the secukinumab groups and 27.9% for placebo among TNF naïve patients at Week 16. 
Based on these assumptions, 185 patients per treatment arm was expected to provide 91% power to 
reject a hypothesis of equal treatment response based on Fisher’s exact test. 
Randomisation 
At baseline, all eligible patients were randomized to one of the treatment arms via IRT. 
At randomization, patients were stratified according to which subgroup of objective signs of inflammation 
they belonged to (based on their CRP and MRI status at Screening). CRP+ was defined as a value above 
the upper limit of normal as defined by the central lab (hsCRP > 5mg/L); MRI+ was defined as SIJs MRI 
with  presence  of  inflammatory  lesions  according  to  the  ASAS/OMERACT  (Outcome  Measures  in 
Rheumatology) Definition. 
The only condition that was placed on enrollment was that no less than 15% of patients were to belong 
to either of the 3 subgroups of objective signs of inflammation: 
•  CRP+ and MRI+, 
•  CRP+ and MRI-, 
•  CRP- and MRI+. 
Additionally, it was planned to enroll no more than approximately 20% TNF-alpha inhibitor inadequate 
responder  (TNF-IR)  patients  in  the  study.  Randomization  was  conducted  in  blocks  of  size  6.  Forced 
randomization was allowed, and used twice. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind randomized treatment study. Although unblinding did occur after the Week 24 
DBL, the original randomization to active treatment vs. placebo continued to remain blinded to the 
study team conducting the trial, all investigators, site personnel and patients until all patients have 
completed the treatment period 2 (Week 52) and the Week 52 DBL has occurred. A separate restricted 
study team conducted the Week 24 interim analysis and no access to the interim data was given to the 
study team conducting the ongoing trial until Week 52 DBL as detailed in the CAIN457H2315 blinding 
charter.

Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
Randomized  set  was  defined  as  all  patients  who  were  randomized.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  mis-
randomized patients (mis-randomized in IRT) were excluded from the randomized set. 
Mis-randomized patients were defined as those patients who were mistakenly randomized into the IRT 
prior to the site confirming all eligibility criteria had been met and to whom no study medication was 
given. Mis-randomized patients were treated as screen failures. 
Full analysis set (FAS): The FAS was comprised of all analyzable patients from the randomized set to 
whom  study  treatment  had  been  assigned.  Following  the  intent-to-treat  principle,  patients  were 
evaluated according to the treatment assigned to at randomization, but actual stratum. 
Full analysis set 2 (FAS2): The FAS2 was comprised of all patients from the randomized set to whom 
study treatment had been assigned and who had been in enrolled at least 379 days (upper limit of visit 
window for Analysis Plan B primary endpoint) before date cut-off. Following the intent-to-treat principle, 
patients were evaluated according to the treatment assigned to at randomization, but actual stratum, if 
stratified randomization was used. This analysis set was used to analyse the Week 52 efficacy endpoints 
in  Analysis  Plan  B  only  at  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis  (Week  24  DBL),  and  results  based  on  this 
analysis set are not presented within this Assessment Report. 
Safety set: The safety set included all patients who took at least one dose of study treatment during the 
treatment period. Patients were evaluated according to treatment received. 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy variable of this study was response to treatment according to the ASAS40 criteria 
at Week 16 in TNF-alpha naïve patients. The analysis of the primary variable was based on the FAS. The 
ASAS Response Criteria (ASAS40) were defined as an improvement of ≥ 40% and ≥ 2 unit on a scale of 
10 in at least 3 of the 4 main domains and no worsening at all in the remaining domain. 
The primary estimand was defined as follows: 
a. Population – defined through appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria to reflect the targeted nr-axSpA 
population 
b. Variable – composite of remaining on the study and on randomized treatment through 16 weeks and 
achieving ASAS40 response at 16 weeks 
c. Intercurrent event: the intercurrent event was captured through the variable definition 
d. Population-level summary – odds ratio of response proportions between treatment conditions 
The  primary  analysis  was  conducted  via  logistic  regression  with  treatment  and  stratification  factor 
(CRP+/MRI+, CRP+/MRI-, CRP-/MRI+) as factors and weight as a covariate. Odds ratios and 95% CI 
were  presented  comparing  each  secukinumab  regimen  to  placebo.  Odds  ratio  and  95%  CI  were  also 
presented comparing the 2 secukinumab regimens. 
Sensitivity analyses and supportive analyses were conducted in order to provide evidence that the results 
seen  from  the  primary  analysis  were  robust.  Interactions  between  treatment  and  selected  baseline 
demographics  and  disease  characteristics  were  explored  for  ASAS40  response  in  TNF-alpha  naïve 
patients at Week 16. 
The impact of missing data on the analysis results of ASAS40 in TNF-alpha naïve patients was assessed 
as well by repeating the logistic regression model using different ways to handle missing data:

Tipping point analysis 
Assuming significance was shown for the primary analysis using non-responder imputation, the tipping 
point  analysis  investigated  if,  and  at  which  point,  significance  was  not  achieved  anymore  as  patients 
imputed  as  non-responders  were  increasingly  reclassified  as  responders  independently  for  each 
treatment group. 
Secondary efficacy variables are categorized below to binary - response to treatment and “continuous” 
- change from baseline/screening. 
Following response to treatment at week 16 endpoints were used: ASAS40, ASAS 5/6 criteria, BASDAI50 
criteria, ASAS20, and ASAS partial remission. The proportion of patients meeting each response criteria 
was evaluated using a logistic regression model with treatment group, stratification factor (CRP+/MRI+, 
CRP+/MRI-,  CRP-  /MRI+)  and  TNF-alpha  status  as  factors  and  weight  as  a  covariate.  For  BASDAI50 
criteria also BASDAI score at baseline was included as covariate in the model. 
For continuous endpoints MRMM or ANCOVA if there was no other time point than week 16 post baseline, 
was applied. The model included with treatment group, stratification factor (CRP+/MRI+, CRP+/MRI-, 
CRP- /MRI+) and TNF-alpha status as factors, baseline value and weight as covariates, and in case of 
MRMM  treatment  by  visit  and  baseline  value  and  visit  as  interaction  terms  in  the  model.  For  hsCRP, 
prespecified log-transformation was applied. 
Multiplicity 
The following null hypotheses were included in the sequential testing strategy, and type-I-error was set 
such that a family-wise type-I-error of 5% was kept: 
Primary objective: 
H1: secukinumab 150 mg (with load) is not different to placebo regimen with respect to ASAS40 response 
in TNF-alpha naïve patients at Week 16

Subgroup analysis 
The  primary  endpoint  was  evaluated  within  stratification  factor  levels  (CRP+/MRI+,  CRP+/MRI-,  and 
CRP-/MRI+). 
Secondary  endpoints  were  evaluated  within  TNF-alpha  inhibitor  status  (TNF-alpha  naïve  and  TNF-IR) 
and within stratification factor levels (CRP+/MRI+, CRP+/MRI-, CRP-/MRI+). 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 1,583 patients were screened for this study, of which 555 patients (35.1%) were randomised. 
Overall, 1,028 patients (64.9%) discontinued prior to screening phase completion, most due to screen 
failure (1,000 patients, 63.2%). The most common reasons for screen failure were lack of objective signs 
of  inflammation  at  screening  (466/1,028  patients;  45.3%),  presence  of  radiographic  evidence  of 
sacroiliitis  (295/1,028  patients;  28.7%),  and  lack  of  diagnosis  of  axSpA  per  ASAS  axSpA  criteria 
(205/1,028  patients;  19.9%).  Overall,  at  least  one  inclusion  or  exclusion  criterion  was  not  met  for 
1,005/1,028 patients (97.8%) who discontinued prior to screening phase completion. Other reasons for 
not completing the screening phase were subject/guardian decision (26 patients, 1.6%), AEs (1 patient, 
0.1%) and pregnancy (1 patient, 0.1%). 
A summary of patient data disposition at Week 16 (time point for primary efficacy analysis) is provided 
below. While the schedule of study assessments did not contain a dedicated Week 16 completion form, 
the  table  summarises  availability  of  efficacy  data  for  each  group  at  the  Week  16  time  point.  Overall, 
efficacy  data  was  available  for  95.1%  of  patients  (528/555)  at  Week  16,  similar  to  the disposition  at 
Week 24.

Patient  disposition  at  Week  24  is  provided  in  Table  3.  Overall,  95.0%  of  the  randomised  patients 
completed Week 24 of the study, with similar proportions across all 3 treatment groups. AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported for 2.2% of patients in the secukinumab 150 mg No Load group and 1.1% 
of patients in the secukinumab 150 mg Load and placebo groups. Overall, the most frequent reason for 
discontinuation was subject/guardian decision (2.2% in the secukinumab 150 mg Load group, 0.5% in 
the secukinumab 150 mg No Load group, and 2.7% in the placebo group). 
Table 3 Patient disposition at Week 24 (Randomized Set/FAS) 
Patient disposition at Week 52 is provided in Table 4. Overall, 86.7% of patients completed Week 52, 
with similar percentages across treatment groups. In the secukinumab 150 mg Load group, the most 
common primary reason for discontinuation was due to subject/guardian decision (6.5%) whereas in the 
secukinumab  150  mg  No  Load  group  and  placebo  group,  it  was  lack  of  efficacy  (3.8%  and  5.9%, 
respectively). 
By Week 52, 94/185 (50.8%) patients in the secukinumab 150 mg Load group, 87/184 (47.3%) patients 
in the secukinumab 150 mg group and 119/186 (64.0%) patients in the placebo group had switched to 
either open-label secukinumab 150 mg (N=297) or standard of care (N=3).

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for Study H2315 had an effective date of 30 September 2015, and first patient first 
visit took place on 29 April 2016. The first data cut-off date for the current submission was 17 December 
2018, and the database was subsequently locked on 22 February 2019. The second data cut-off was 01 
July 2019, when all patients had completed 52 weeks of treatment, and the database for this cut-off was 
subsequently locked on 13 September 2019. 
The  study  protocol  was  amended  on  two  occasions.  In  Amendment  1,  dated  28  November  2016, 
significant changes included a change in the testing hierarchy, a change in the population for the primary 
analysis to TNF-alpha naïve patients only, and a change in the maximally allowed proportion of TNF-IR 
patients from 30% to 20% (Table 6).

Table 6 Key changes in Protocol Amendment 1, dated 28 Nov 2016 
Amendment 2, dated 11 July 2018, added an extension phase into the study as well as a Week 24 interim 
analysis for the Week 52 time point for Analysis Plan B (Table 7). 
Table 7 Key changes in Protocol Amendment 2, dated 11 Jul 2018 
Protocol  deviations  were  reported  for  22.0%  of  patients  overall,  with  similar  percentages  across 
treatment  groups.  Approximately  half  of  the  patients  with  protocol  deviations  took  prohibited 
concomitant medication such as opioids or unstable doses of NSAIDs (10.1% overall). Selection criteria 
were not met for 4.5% of patients overall (5 patients in the secukinumab 150 mg Load group, and 10 
patients each in the secukinumab 150 mg No Load and placebo groups), and 1.8% of patients overall 
had  a  treatment  deviation  (e.g.,  administration  of  incorrect  or  additional  study  medication  in  four 
patients). The category of Other deviations included deviations related to informed consent, incorrect 
stratum  assignment,  non-compliance  with  investigator  responsibilities,  etc.  Protocol  deviations  by 
deviation category are summarised in Table 8.

Baseline data 
Demographic  characteristics  were  similar  across  the  treatment  groups  (Table  9).  In  the  overall 
population, 91.5% of patients were white. Mean (SD) age was 39.4 (11.5) years with a range of 18 to 
80 years;  98.4%  of  patients  were  less  than  65  years  of  age.  Mean  (SD)  BMI  was  27.1  (5.6)  kg/m2. 
There  were  slightly  more  female  patients  in  each  treatment  group;  overall,  54.1%  of  patients  were 
female.

Disease characteristics and history at baseline were also similar between the treatment groups 
(Table 10). Mean time since onset of back pain was 8.56 years and mean time since first diagnosis of 
axSpA was 2.61 years. Over 90% of randomised patients were naive to TNF-alpha inhibitors, with 
9.7% of patients having received 1 prior TNF-alpha inhibitor. The mean global assessment of disease 
activity on a 100 mm VAS was 70.8 mm and median hsCRP was 4.5 mg/L. Mean Berlin scores for SI 
joint oedema on the MRI were 2.80 (SD 3.83) in the secukinumab Load group, 2.24 (SD 3.29) in the 
No Load group, and 2.70 (SD 3.96) in the placebo group. Regarding objective signs of inflammation 
used for stratification, 42.3% of patients were CRP- and MRI+, 29.9% were CRP+ and MRI+, and 
27.7% were CRP+ and MRI-. There were no patients with radiographic evidence for sacroiliitis 
according to the modified NY criteria for AS.

At baseline, mean BASFI score was 6.02 (SD 1.99), mean BASDAI score was 6.92 (SD 1.34), and mean 
linear BASMI score was 2.82 (SD 1.24). There were no substantial differences between treatment groups 
in BASFI, BASDAI or linear BASMI at baseline. 
At baseline, 9.9% of all patients used methotrexate with a median dose of 15 mg/week; 14.8% used 
sulfasalazine (median dose of 2 g/day), and 8.6% used corticosteroids (median dose of 6.67 mg/day).

Outcomes and estimation 
The  study  met  its  pre-defined  primary  and  secondary  objectives  according  to  Analysis  Plan  A. 
Secukinumab  150  mg  Load  and  No  Load  groups  were  both  superior  to  placebo  on  the  hierarchically 
tested endpoints (Table 12). The primary endpoint of ASAS40 response in TNF-naïve patients at Week 
16 was statistically significantly higher for both secukinumab groups versus placebo. For the secondary 
variables  at  Week  16,  both  secukinumab  groups  showed  significantly  higher  rates  of  ASAS  20  and 
ASAS40  response,  ASAS5/6  response,  BASDAI50  response,  ASAS  partial  remission,  as  well  as 
significantly greater changes from baseline in BASDAI, hsCRP, BASFI, SI-joint edema on MRI, SF-36 PCS 
and ASQoL, as compared with the placebo group.

Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy variable was the response to treatment according to the ASAS40 criteria in TNF-
naïve  patients  at  Week  16.  As  seen  in  Table  14,  both  secukinumab  groups  showed  statistically 
significantly  higher  ASAS40  response  rates  among  TNF-naïve  patients  at  Week  16;  response  rates  of 
41.5% and 42.2% were reported in the secukinumab 150 mg Load and No Load groups, respectively, 
compared to 29.2% in the placebo group. At Week 16, the ASAS40 response rates were similar between 
the Load and No Load groups, but the onset of action was faster in the Load group (Figure 2).

Ancillary analyses 
Persistence of effect - analyses at Week 52 
Long-term efficacy data were assessed using Analysis Plan B. As seen in Figure 13 and Table 25, the 
ASAS40  response  rate  using  non-responder  imputation  was  sustained  over  time  and  remained 
significantly higher in both secukinumab groups compared to placebo at Week 52 (p=0.0127 vs placebo 
for both secukinumab groups based on hierarchical testing per Analysis Plan B). 
Table 25 presents a comparison of the interim data presented in the original submission (FAS2) vs the 
updated analysis based on the complete Week 52 dataset (FAS).

Subgroup analyses - Week 16 and Week 52 
MRI and CRP status - stratification factor 
An exploratory analysis was carried out to assess ASAS40 response in TNF-naïve patients using non-
responder  imputation  by  the  protocol-defined  randomisation  strata  (i.e.  CRP  and  MRI  status  at 
screening). At Week 16, there was a significant response to treatment among patients who were CRP+ 
and  MRI+  at  screening,  whereas  the  effect  was  much  less  marked  among  the  CRP+/MRI-  and  CRP-
/MRI+  patients  (Table  26).  Figure  14  displays  line  graphs  for  the  ASAS40  response  over  time  in  the 
different  randomisation  strata.  Similar  patterns  of  response  were  generally  observed  on  secondary 
endpoints, including ASAS5/6, BASDAI50, and BASFI.

Table 27 ASAS40 response in TNF-alpha naive patients using non-responder imputation by 
randomisation strata - at Week 52 (FAS) 
Considering that the observed treatment response was clearly higher in the CRP+/MRI+ subpopulation, 
the  MAH  was  requested  to  provide  further  justification  for  recommending  use  of  secukinumab  in 
CRP+/MRI- and CRP-/MRI+ subpopulations of nr-axSpA patients. To further explore these trends and 
increase the size of the subgroups, the MAH conducted additional analyses based on only the CRP or the 
MRI status at baseline (either CRP+ vs CRP- or MRI+ vs MRI-) along with logistic regression analyses to 
determine the propensity to achieve ASAS40 at Week 16 based on baseline CRP or MRI values. 
When considering MRI and CRP status at baseline independently as indicators of systemic inflammation, 
ASAS40 responses at Week 16 in the secukinumab 150 mg Load and No Load groups in patients with 
either positive MRI or abnormal CRP at baseline were consistently higher than for patients with negative 
MRI or normal CRP at baseline. Specifically, for the subgroup of patients with positive MRI at baseline, 
the  absolute  treatment  differences  of  ASAS40  between  both  secukinumab  groups  versus  placebo 
(14.20% for secukinumab 150 mg Load, 16.54% for secukinumab 150 mg No Load) were higher than 
for  patients  who  were  MRI  negative  at  baseline  (5.87%  for  secukinumab  150  mg  Load,  2.23%  for 
secukinumab 150 mg No Load). Similarly, treatment differences were higher for the subgroup of patients 
whose  baseline  CRP  level  was  >  5  mg/L  (referred  to  as  positive  CRP  at  baseline)  compared  to  the 
subgroup of patients whose baseline CRP level was ≤ 5 mg/L (referred to as negative CRP at baseline). 
For the subgroup of patients with positive CRP at baseline, the absolute treatment differences of ASAS40 
between both secukinumab groups versus placebo (17.91% for secukinumab 150 mg Load, 15.09% for 
secukinumab 150 mg No Load) were higher than for patients who were CRP negative at baseline (5.85% 
for secukinumab 150 mg Load, 10.36% for secukinumab 150 mg No Load). These data are summarised 
in Figure 15.

Figure 15 Differences in ASAS40 response between secukinumab and placebo at Week 16 by MRI and 
CRP status at baseline (FAS) 
In  addition,  a  logistic  regression  analysis  of  ASAS40  response  using  non-responder  imputation  by 
treatment  and  baseline  MRI  and  CRP  values  as  continuous  covariates  demonstrated  a  correlation 
between the baseline MRI and CRP values and the propensity to achieve ASAS40 at Week 16. As shown 
in Table 28, the propensity to achieve ASAS40 at Week 16 was correlated with increasing MRI score and 
CRP  value  at  baseline  in  the  secukinumab  treatment  groups,  whereas  this  was  not  the  case  for  the 
placebo group. In the model, baseline MRI SI-joint oedema score and baseline CRP (log transformed) 
were  added  to  estimate  the  impact  within  treatment.  The  parameter  estimate  coefficients  can  be 
interpreted as change in log (odds) for achieving ASAS40 with one unit change in baseline MRI SI-joint 
oedema score or baseline log(CRP) value. Within the secukinumab 150 mg Load group, the odds ratio 
for achieving ASAS40 with 1 unit increase in baseline MRI SI-joint oedema score was 1.18 (p-value = 
0.001) and for a unit increase in baseline log(CRP) the odds ratio was 1.31 (p-value = 0.0208), both 
implying  a  positive  relationship  with  a  p-value  lower  than  0.05.  For  placebo,  the  corresponding  odds 
ratios were 0.99 (p-value = 0.7984) for baseline MRI SI-joint oedema score and 0.96 (p-value = 0.7524) 
for baseline log(CRP).

The MAH also presented an analysis of adverse event data based on MRI and CRP status at baseline. 
These analyses did not reveal any differences of note between the subgroups. 
TNF-naïve vs. TNF-IR patients 
As described above, the primary endpoint of the study was the ASAS40 response at Week 16 among 
TNF-naïve patients, and among these patients, ASAS40 response using non-responder imputation was 
higher in the secukinumab 150 mg Load (41.5%) and secukinumab 150 mg No Load (42.2%) groups 
compared  to  placebo  (29.2%).  Among  TNF-IR  patients,  ASAS40  response  using  non-responder 
imputation at Week 16 was also higher in the secukinumab 150 mg Load (6/21 patients; 28.6%) and 
secukinumab  150 mg  No  Load  (5/18  patients;  27.8%)  groups  compared  to  placebo  (2/15  patients; 
13.3%); the calculated OR for Load vs. placebo was 2.80 (95% CI 0.43, 18.23). 
The MAH also presented a side-by-side comparison of additional efficacy responses between TNFi-naïve 
and TNF-IR patients to support similar efficacy in both subgroups (Table 29).

Demographic factors - gender and weight 
ASAS40 responses at Week 16 in subgroups based on age, gender and in different weight groups are 
shown  in  Figure  16.  In  these  analyses,  the  original  age  cut-off  deployed  by  the  MAH  (65  years)  was 
considered inappropriate, and an additional analysis based on a more relevant cut off was requested. In 
other subgroup analyses, males were observed to respond better than females, and in the subgroup of 
weight >90 kg, the difference between either secukinumab group and placebo was virtually 0. 
Figure 16 Forest plot for the difference of ASAS40 response between secukinumab and placebo at 
Week 16 by subgroups based on age, gender, and weight (Full Analysis Set) 
The MAH presented an additional analysis of age groups based on a cut-off of 50 years. In this analysis, 
there were 435 patients < 50 years of age and 120 patients ≥ 50 years of age. The estimated treatment 
differences of ASAS40 against placebo at Week 16 were all in favour of secukinumab 150 mg Load and 
No Load groups. For patients < 50 years of age, the treatment differences versus placebo were 11.0% 
for the secukinumab 150 mg Load group and 12.2% for the secukinumab 150 mg No Load group. For 
patients ≥ 50 years of age, the treatment differences versus placebo were 11.7% and 7.3%, respectively. 
With  respect  to  gender  effects,  the  MAH  contended  that  females  with  spondyloarthritis  generally 
demonstrate a trend toward lower efficacy responses than males, even if the patient burden in terms of 
baseline  disease  activity  parameters  is  similar  or  worse  in  females  compared  to  males.  At  Week  52, 
ASAS40 response rates in females were about 28% for secukinumab and around 15% for placebo, and 
in males, the rates ranged from 41% (secukinumab 150 mg Load group) to 50% (secukinumab 150 mg 
No  Load  group)  vs  24%  for  placebo.  The  MAH  thus  claimed  that  in  the  longer  term,  there  was  an 
additional  benefit  observed  for  females  with  the  treatment  difference  versus  placebo  increasing  over 
time, although a difference in relative response remained between males and females. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020

With  respect  to  weight,  the  MAH  presented  additional  data  from  the  Week  52  analysis,  in  which  the 
placebo-adjusted treatment effect for both secukinumab groups in patients weighing > 90 kg increased 
to 7.7% and 8.7%, respectively (Figure 17). According to the MAH, while this remains somewhat lower 
than the other weight subgroups, it indicates that in the longer term, secukinumab 150 mg does provide 
benefit to patients weighing > 90 kg.

52 by subgroups based on weight (FAS) 
Disease factors - baseline BASDAI, baseline hsCRP and HLA-B27 status 
At Week 16, ASAS40 responses in secukinumab 150 mg Load and no Load groups were generally higher 
compared with placebo in subgroups based on baseline total BASDAI score, baseline hsCRP level, and 
HLA-B27 status (Figure 18).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The current submission is supported by results from an ongoing randomised, placebo-controlled Phase 
3 study assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two different regimens of secukinumab, 150 
mg with loading and without loading, compared to placebo in patients with nr-axSpA. The posology 
without loading is not being applied for by the MAH. 
The general design features of this randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study is generally in line 
with the current EU Guideline EU Guideline on AxSpA (EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 Rev.1, Corr 1). However, 
the  Guideline  (including  its  previous  version)  foresees  the  need,  for  products  belonging  to  new 
therapeutic classes, of a comparison against an accepted active comparator (e.g. anti TNF treatment) 
for the target population in order to properly assess the relative B/R balance of the new product. A three-
arm  trial  is  recommended,  particularly  when  biological  naïve  patients  are  to  be  studied.  The  current 
study lacks an active comparator, and the MAH was therefore requested to provide a critical discussion 
characterising the place of secukinumab in the treatment armamentarium of nr-axSpA. In its response, 
the MAH presented and discussed ASAS40 response rates reported across published studies for several 
TNF inhibitors vs. that reported for secukinumab. The CHMP considered that indirect comparisons across 
different studies are complicated e.g. by large differences in response rates on placebo, and that the 
lack of a concurrent comparator therefore remains a shortcoming when attempting to assess the place 
of a new therapeutic modality with the treatment armamentarium for a given disorder. However, the 
CHMP agreed that a clinically relevant effect against placebo for secukinumab in the treatment of nr-
axSpA had been demonstrated in a large controlled study. Moreover, data from a secukinumab study 
with  a  concurrent  “TNFi”  control  group  in  psoriasis,  a  partly  interrelated  indication,  demonstrates  a 
favourable  benefit/risk  profile.  Based  on  the  additional  justification  provided  by  the  MAH,  the  CHMP 
concluded  that  even  in  the  absence  of  a  direct  active  comparator,  an  overall  favourable  benefit/risk 
profile for secukinumab has been demonstrated, and the issue was not pursued further. 
The eligibility criteria represent accepted definitions for active nr-axSpA. With the exception of the X-ray 
criterion differentiating AS from nr-axSpA, the eligibility criteria were also very similar to those used in 
the  original  secukinumab  AS  studies.  Radiographic  and  MRI  images  were  read  centrally,  and  hsCRP 
concentrations were analysed by a central laboratory. Inclusion of patients having failed treatment with 
one TNF-alpha inhibitor was permitted per protocol. 
The  fixed  treatment  schedule  from  baseline  to  Week  16  enables  a  robust  assessment  of  efficacy  for 
purposes of Analysis Plan A. In principle, assessment of the natural course of nr-axSpA over a 1-year 
period was enabled with the selected design; however, it should be noted that the number of patients 
completing 52 weeks of treatment on placebo was quite limited. See discussion below. 
The  defined  objectives  and  endpoints  support  assessment  of  the  effects  of  secukinumab  across 
inflammatory,  symptomatic,  structural  and  functional  aspects  of  nr-axSpA.  However,  the  study  was 
initiated before the current EU Guideline on AxSpA came into effect. There are some deviations to the 
choice of the endpoints as recommended per the Guideline that were not found by CHMP to impair the 
suitability of the study to investigate secukinumab in nr-AxSpA. Indeed, the primary endpoint of ASAS40 
is considered the preferred ASAS response criterion as per the current Guideline.  
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 59/103 
 
 
 
ASDAS  responder  criteria,  such  as  ASDAS-CRP  and  ASDAS-ESR  clinically  important  improvement; 
ASDAS-CRP  and  ASDAS-ESR  clinically  major  improvement;  and  ASDAS-CRP  and  ASDAS-ESP  inactive 
disease, represent endpoints that are being increasingly adopted as part of the emerging treat-to-target 
approach in axSpA and are recommended within the current Guideline. These endpoints, although only 
included as exploratory endpoints in the current submission, are considered to provide information of 
clinical  relevance  to  future  prescribers.  Determination  of  spinal  mobility  is  considered  an  important 
efficacy  domain  in  the  current  Guideline.  However,  in  the  current  study,  BASMI  scores  were  still 
evaluated among the exploratory objectives. 
The  study  was  conducted  across  144  Investigator  sites  in  24  participating  countries.  Of  the  total  of 
555 patients enrolled, the largest numbers were recruited in Spain (72), Czech Republic (71), Poland 
(65), Russia (54), and Germany (52). 
Overall,  only  35.1%  of  the  patients  screened  for  the  study  were  randomised  and  the  most  common 
reason  for  not  being  randomised  was  screening  failure.  The  most  common  reasons  for  screen  failure 
were  a  lack  of  objective  signs  of  inflammation  at  screening,  presence  of  radiographic  evidence  of 
sacroiliitis, and lack of diagnosis of axSpA per ASAS axSpA criteria. 
The  overall  discontinuation  rate  until  Week  24  was  5%,  with  no  substantial  differences  between  the 
treatment groups. It thus seems unlikely that premature discontinuations would have a significant impact 
on  the  robustness  of  the  dataset  used  for  the  primary  statistical  analyses.  At  Week  52,  the  overall 
discontinuation rate was about 13%, with lack of efficacy and subject/guardian decision constituting the 
most frequent reasons for discontinuation. 
Between Week 20 and Week 52, some 49% of patients in the secukinumab groups opted to switch from 
double-blind  study  medication  to  open-label  secukinumab.  In  the  placebo  group,  the  corresponding 
proportion of  switchers  was  64%.  The  numbers  thus  suggest  that  fewer  patients  in  the  secukinumab 
groups perceived the treatment as ineffective, and also that a high proportion of patients with active nr-
axSpA suffer from persistent symptomatology. 
Patients enrolled into the study had a history of about 2.6 years since the first diagnosis of AxSpA, and 
active disease as evidenced e.g, by a mean value of 70.8 on the global assessment of disease activity, 
72.1 on total back pain, and a mean BASDAI score of 6.92. Assessments of disease activity were very 
comparable to values reported in the AS study F2310, where mean global assessment of disease activity 
was  67.5,  total  back  pain  was  66.8,  and  mean  BASDAI  was  6.65.  With  respect  to  functional  indices, 
BASFI scores were comparable to the AS study (6.02 in the current study vs. 6.10 in the AS study); 
however, mean linear BASMI was 2.82 in the current study vs. 3.81 in the AS study, suggesting slightly 
better spinal mobility among patients in the current study. 
Whereas  the  protocol  would  have  permitted  enrolment  of  up  to  20%  of  TNF-IR  patients,  the  actual 
proportion  of  such  patients  was  9.7%  (total  N  =  54).  The  CHMP  therefore  noted  that  conclusions 
regarding efficacy in this subpopulation should thus be treated with caution due to the small sample size 
(see discussions below). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A forest plot of key efficacy endpoints at Week 16 for the secukinumab 150 mg Load group vs. placebo 
is displayed in the Figure below.

Figure 19 Forest plots of key efficacy endpoints displaying treatment difference of secukinumab 150 
mg Load vs. placebo at Week 16 (Full analysis set) 
A statistically significant treatment effect was observed on the primary endpoint using a conservative 
non-responder imputation strategy; ASAS40 response rates of 41.5% in the secukinumab 150 mg Load 
group  vs.  29.2%  in  the  placebo  group  correspond  to  an  OR  of  1.72  favouring  secukinumab.  The 
robustness of the observation is supported by appropriate sensitivity analyses. 
Although the posology is not being applied for secukinumab 150 mg, No Load also had a significantly 
better ASAS40 response in TNF-alpha naïve patients than placebo (42.2% vs. 29.2%; p=0.0146). 
As reference, the 29.2% response rate observed in the placebo group is somewhat higher than reported 
in similar studies reported earlier with TNF-alpha inhibitors (e.g. 14.8% at Week 12 in the etanercept 
study B1801031; 14.9% at Week 12 in the adalimumab study M10-791; 16.3% at Week 12 in the non-
radiographic  subpopulation  of  the  certolizumab  pegol  study  AS001;  and  23.0%  at  Week  16  in  the 
golimumab study P07642). Conversely, the ASAS40 response rates in the active arms of the respective 
studies were reported as 33.3% for etanercept; 36.3% for adalimumab; 47.8% for certolizumab pegol; 
and 56.7% for golimumab, compared to 41.5% for the Load group in the current study. In the original 
secukinumab AS Study F2310, where a dosing regimen corresponding to the 150 mg Load regimen in 
the  current  study  was  investigated,  ASAS40  response  rates  at  Week  16  were  10.8%  for  placebo  and 
36.1% for secukinumab 150 mg. 
The  result  on  the  primary  endpoint  is  supported  by  analyses  of  secondary  endpoints,  where  both 
secukinumab groups consistently demonstrated efficacy on variables related to inflammation and disease 
activity, function and health-related quality of life: 
- ASAS40 response using non-responder imputation at Week 16 was statistically significantly higher in 
the secukinumab 150 mg Load and No Load groups compared to the placebo group (40.0% and 40.8% 
vs. 28.0%; p=0.0108 and p=0.0087). 
- ASAS 5/6 response using non-responder imputation at Week 16 was statistically significantly higher 
for secukinumab 150 mg Load and No Load than for placebo (40.0% and 35.9% vs. 23.7%; p=0.0005 
and p=0.0094). 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 61/103 
 
 
 
 
- Total BASDAI change from baseline using MMRM at Week 16 was statistically significantly greater in 
the secukinumab 150 mg Load and No Load groups compared to placebo (−2.35 and −2.43 vs. −1.46; 
p=0.0006 and p=0.0002). 
- BASDAI50 response using non-responder imputation at Week 16 was statistically significantly higher 
for  secukinumab  150  mg  Load  and  No  Load  compared  to  placebo  (37.3%  and  37.5%  vs.  21.0%; 
p=0.0001 and p=0.0002). 
-  BASFI  change  from  baseline  using  MMRM  at  Week  16  was  statistically  significantly  greater  for 
secukinumab 150 mg Load and No Load than for placebo (−1.75 and −1.64 vs. −1.01; p=0.0041 and 
p=0.0143). 
-  hsCRP  change  from  baseline  using  MMRM  at  Week  16  was  statistically  significantly  greater  for  the 
secukinumab  150  mg  Load  and  No  Load  groups  compared  to  the  placebo  group  (0.64  for  both 
secukinumab groups vs. 0.91 for placebo; p=0.0002 for both comparisons). 
- MRI SI joint edema score change from baseline using ANCOVA based on multiple imputation at Week 
16  was  statistically  significantly  greater  for  secukinumab  150  mg  Load  and  No  Load than  for  placebo 
(−1.68 and −1.03 vs. −0.39; p< 0.0001 for both comparisons). 
-  SF-36  PCS  change  from  baseline  using  MMRM  at  Week  16  was  statistically  significantly  greater  for 
secukinumab  150  mg  Load  and  No  Load  than  for  placebo  (5.71  and  5.57  vs.  2.93;  p=0.0006  and 
p=0.0011). 
-  ASQoL  change  from  baseline  using  MMRM  at  Week  16  was  statistically  significantly  greater  for 
secukinumab 150 mg Load and No Load than for placebo (−3.45 and −3.62 vs. −1.84; p=0.0008 and 
p=0.0002). 
-  ASAS  partial  remission  using  non-responder  imputation  at  Week  16  was  achieved  by  a  statistically 
significantly  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  secukinumab  150  mg  Load  and  No  Load  groups 
compared to placebo (21.6% and 21.2% vs. 7.0%; p< 0.0001 and p=0.0001). 
-  Efficacy  was  also  seen  in  treat-to-target  -oriented  variables  that  were  assessed  among  exploratory 
analyses.  For  example,  ASDAS-CRP  inactive  disease  (using  non-responder  imputation)  in  the 
secukinumab 150 mg Load and No Load groups vs. the placebo group were 20.5% and 21.7 vs. 8.1%.  
Consistent, statistically significant efficacy vs. placebo was observed across the pre-defined secondary 
endpoints. For some endpoints, a more rapid onset was observed with the Load regimen compared to 
the  No  Load  regimen;  this  was  seen  for  higher  hurdle  endpoints  such  as  ASAS40  and  ASAS  partial 
remission, where it can be expected that the hurdle is reached more rapidly with higher initial exposure, 
whereas ASAS20 responses developed very similarly on both active treatment groups over time. Also 
for hSCRP, the responses between the Load and No Load regimens were very similar over time. At Week 
16,  an  effect  was  also  observed  on  active  inflammation  based  on  MRI  assessment  of  sacroiliac  joint 
oedema. The CHMP agreed that the overall data support an earlier onset of efficacy for the Load group; 
as such, the MAH’s decision to apply for authorisation for the Load regimen is supported by the CHMP. 
The  current  EU  Guideline  for  AxSpA  (EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03  Rev.1,  Corr  1)  gives  considerable 
emphasis to ASDAS response rates, which were analysed among the exploratory endpoints in the current 
study.  Consistently  higher  response  rates  were  observed  for  both  secukinumab  groups  compared  to 
placebo  on  these  endpoints;  for  example,  20.5%  of  patients  in  the  Load  group  reached  ASDAS-CRP 
Inactive disease, compared to 8.1% of patients on placebo. 
In  general,  the  exploratory  endpoint  analyses  at  Week  16  supported  analyses  of  the  primary  and 
secondary efficacy endpoints, although little difference between the groups was seen on enthesitis as 
assessed with the MASES score. It is noted that the results for on BASMI, an additional efficacy domain 
Assessment report

Page 62/103 
 
 
 
that is considered important in the current EU Guideline, were assessed among exploratory endpoints. 
Some support for efficacy on spinal mobility was observed on BASMI, with numerically greater decreases 
seen in the active groups compared to placebo. 
Week  52  results  based  on  Analysis  Plan  B  were  used  to  assess  persistence  of  therapeutic  effect. 
Maintenance of effect was supported by consistent differences being observed between the secukinumab 
groups  vs.  placebo  across  most  endpoints  assessed,  and  statistically  significant  differences  between 
active groups and placebo (although p values being adjusted within Analysis Plan B only) were observed 
on the primary endpoint using a conservative imputation strategy. The analysis was primarily intended 
to  support  regulatory  submissions  outside  of  the  European  Union,  but  it  was  acceptable  to  CHMP  to 
briefly mention maintenance of effect at Week 52, without reference to specific p-values, within Section 
5.1 of the SmPC. 
The proposed dosing regimen of 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 
3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
It is currently not known whether treatment in a well responding nr-axSpA patient should be continued 
indefinitely, or whether consideration could be given to discontinuing treatment at some point. Studies 
deploying  randomised  withdrawal  designs  are  currently  ongoing  with  several  TNF-alpha  inhibitors  to 
explore this issue. Neutralisation of IL-17A activity would represent a new mechanism of action in the 
treatment of nr-axSpA, and the CHMP recommended the MAH to explore this question with secukinumab. 
The MAH agreed to address this issue in an adequately designed clinical study. In accordance with the 
current EU Guideline, such data will be generated in the post-approval setting. 
Earlier studies have shown that the treatment response to TNF inhibitors in nr-axSpA patients is more 
pronounced in patients with a higher degree of active inflammation at baseline, as determined with an 
elevated hsCRP and/or joint oedema on MRI. To date, “objective signs of inflammation” for all approved 
TNF has been defined by either elevated CRP or MRI evidence, i.e., the simultaneous presence of both 
indicators  has  not  been  not  required.  In  the  current  study,  the  efficacy  was  clearly  driven  by  the 
CRP+/MRI+ subgroup, and observations in both the CRP+/MRI- and CRP-/MRI+ subgroups seem to be 
characterised by both a) a larger placebo response, and b) a comparatively lesser response to active 
drug. It was acknowledged that the sample sizes in some of the subgroups are rather small, and the 
analyses  may  suffer  from  possibly  random  fluctuation  in  treatment  responses  over  time  or  other 
unidentified factors, but the MAH was requested to provide further justification for recommending use of 
secukinumab in CRP+/MRI- and CRP-/MRI+ subpopulations of nr-axSpA patients. In the response, the 
MAH argued that the stratified randomisation was based on a request by the US FDA to ensure that a 
similar number of patients was enrolled into the respective subgroups. When considering MRI and CRP 
status at baseline independently, ASAS40 responses at Week 16 in the secukinumab 150 mg Load and 
No Load groups in patients with either positive MRI or abnormal CRP at baseline were consistently higher 
than for patients with negative MRI or normal CRP at baseline. Based on results of the current study, a 
subgroup difference in terms of efficacy outcome seems credible. The effect size is more pronounced in 
patients for whom the inflammation is confirmed by both MRI and CRP. This was further elaborated with 
log-linear model which showed that higher baseline CRP or MRI would lead to better response rate in 
terms of ASAS40 with active treatment, and that baseline CRP or MRI has no impact on placebo response. 
Based on additional justification and analyses presented by the MAH showing that CRP+/MRI- or CRP-
/MRI+  derive  also  benefit  from  secukinumab,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  both  MRI  evidence  of  active 
inflammation  and  an  elevated  CRP  are  associated  with  a  greater  likelihood  of  treatment  response. 
Consequently, the indication wording proposed by the MAH “….with objective signs of inflammation as 
indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence …..” 
was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020

Based on the reported data and consistent with observations in AS patients, response rates were higher 
for  secukinumab  vs.  placebo  in  both  TNF-naïve  and  TNF-IR  patients.  In  principle,  this  supports  the 
consideration of secukinumab as a useful treatment alternative for nr-axSpA patients not responding to 
a TNF inhibitor. The MAH ascribed part of the challenge in recruiting TNF-IR patients to the fact that TNFi 
were not approved, or were only recently approved, for the treatment of nr-axSpA in many countries 
during conduct of the study, and this explanation was acknowledged by the CHMP. However, due to the 
small  sample  size,  observations  in  the  TNF-IR  nr-axSpA  subpopulation  still  need  to  be  viewed  with 
considerable  caution;  data  in  the  TNF-IR  subgroup  is  generally  limited  to  less  than  20  patients  per 
treatment group, and each individual responder/non-responder thus changes the overall response rate 
by 5% or more. As the reported data is based on a conservative non-responder imputation, even the 
limited dataset was considered by the CHMP to generally support efficacy in TNF-IR patients at Week 
16. A short statement was included in the Section 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect this conclusion. 
In an analysis of age groups based on a cut-off of 50 years, similar efficacy was observed in patients 
below and above 50 years of age. 
In the current study, males were observed to respond better than females. The MAH pointed out that 
females  with  spondyloarthritis  generally  demonstrate  a  trend  toward  lower  efficacy  responses  than 
males, even if the patient burden in terms of baseline disease activity parameters is similar or worse in 
females compared to males, and that a similar observation has been made in other studies such as the 
golimumab  study  P07642.  At  Week  52,  ASAS40  response  rates  in  females  were  about  28%  for 
secukinumab and around 15% for placebo, and in males, the rates ranged from 41% (secukinumab 150 
mg Load group) to 50% (secukinumab 150 mg No Load group) vs 24% for placebo, and the MAH thus 
claimed that in the longer term, additional benefit is observed for females with the treatment difference 
versus placebo increasing over time, although a difference in relative response remained between males 
and  females.  The  MAH’s  additional  justification  was  acknowledged,  and  while  the  response  rates  on 
average are lower in females than males, the CHMP accepted that individual female patients can attain 
benefit from the use of secukinumab. 
The treatment response at Week 16 was negligible in patients weighing >90 kg. The MAH acknowledged 
the  finding  and  presented  additional  data  from  the  Week  52  analysis,  in  which  the  placebo-adjusted 
treatment effect for the secukinumab groups in patients weighing > 90 kg increased to 7.7% and 8.7%, 
respectively.  While  the  treatment  effect  remains  smallest  in  the  patient  group  weighing  >90  kg,  the 
CHMP considers that the trend based on weight groups is not consistent, and in contrast to the Week 16 
dataset, some efficacy is also seen in in the patient group weighing >90 kg at Week 52. The issue was 
therefore not pursued further. 
Of  note,  subgroup  analyses  based  on  baseline  disease  characteristics  suggested  a  greater  treatment 
response  among  patients  with  an  elevated  hsCRP  level  at  baseline;  this  further  supports  previous 
observations of improved efficacy among patients with confirmed active inflammation. A comparatively 
larger treatment response was also seen in HLA B27 negative patients compared to HLA B27 positive 
patients;  however,  no  conclusion  can  be  drawn  in  view  of  the  relatively  sample  size  in  the  HLA  B27 
negative subgroup. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Secukinumab at a dose of 150 mg by subcutaneous injection, with initial dosing at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 
and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing, was studied in a large placebo-controlled study. The 
study met its primary and secondary endpoints, and robustness of the results is supported by 
appropriate sensitivity analyses. Maintenance of effect up to 52 weeks of treatment was supported by 
an additional statistical analysis based on complete Week 52 data from this still ongoing study.

The CHMP concluded that study H2315 provides demonstration of efficacy of secukinumab on 
symptoms, inflammation, function and quality of life in patients with active nr-axSpA despite treatment 
with NSAIDs. 
The proposed dosing regimen of 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at weeks 0, 1, 2, 
3 and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
As the required duration of treatment in a well responding patient has not been evaluated, the MAH 
has committed, based on CHMP’s recommendation, to conducting an adequately designed clinical trial 
(with a randomised withdrawal design) with the goal to assess whether treatment in a well responding 
nr-axSpA patient should be continued indefinitely. In accordance with the current EU Guideline, the 
CHMP agreed that this study can be conducted in the post-approval setting. 
Based on the data presented, secukinumab can be considered approvable in this indication from an 
efficacy perspective. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The pivotal study H2315 in non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis is briefly introduced in Table 31. 
Table 31 Study H2315 
The pivotal study is designed as a 2-year study (core phase), with an additional 2-year extension phase 
to assess the efficacy and safety of secukinumab in non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis patients. As 
of the data cut-off date (17-Dec-2018), safety data are available for all patients up to Week 24 and for 
some patients up to 104 weeks. No data from the extension phase beyond week 104 for any patient is 
provided in this submission. 
Safety results for both the first 20 weeks (i.e. the period during which all patients remained on the study 
treatment  to  which  they  were  originally  randomised  to)  as  well  as  the  entire  treatment  period  were 
evaluated for the following treatment groups: 
•  Secukinumab (AIN457) 150 mg Load: includes patients randomized at baseline to secukinumab 
150 mg s.c. with loading at baseline and Weeks 1, 2, and 3. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 65/103 
 
 
 
 
•  Secukinumab  (AIN457)  150  mg  No  Load:  includes  patients  randomized  at  baseline  to 
secukinumab 150 mg s.c. without initial loading. 
•  Any  secukinumab  (Any  AIN457):  a  combination  of  the  secukinumab  150  mg  Load  and 
secukinumab  150  mg  No  Load  groups;  placebo  switchers  after  the  switch  to  open-label 
secukinumab are also included in this category in analyses of the entire treatment period. 
• 
Placebo: includes patients up to Week 20 and those with data past Week 20 who did not switch 
to open-label secukinumab. 
For all three secukinumab groups, events were attributed to secukinumab up to 12 weeks after the last 
dose and includes patients who switched to standard of care after secukinumab treatment. 
In order to evaluate the need for updating the current list of adverse drug reactions for secukinumab 
with  data  from  study  H2315,  data  pooling  was  performed  on  secukinumab  studies  from  multiple 
indications: non-radiographic spondylarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 
psoriasis  (Pso),  described  in  Table  32.  Data  cut-off  was  either  12  (Pso)  or  16  weeks  (AS  and  PsA) 
depending on the length of the initial placebo controlled period.

Patient exposure 
A total of 1583 patients were screened for this study, of whom 555 patients (35.1%) were randomized. 
Overall,  95.0% of  the  randomized patients  completed  Week  24  of  the  study,  with  similar proportions 
across all treatment groups. For the demographic and disease baseline characteristics of the patients, 
refer to the efficacy-sections of this AR. The patient exposure in study H2315 is described in Table 33.

Adverse events 
Up to week 20 
Adverse events that were suspected to be related to study drug were more frequently reported in the 
secukinumab  group  compared  to  placebo  at  Week  20  (Any  secukinumab  group:  23.8%  vs.  placebo 
group: 14.0%). Refer to Tables 34 and 35. 
Infections  and  infestations  were  the  most  frequent,  with  the  largest  group  difference  between 
secukinumab and placebo (Any secukinumab group: 12.7% vs. placebo group: 7.0%). AEs contributing 
to this difference in incidence rates were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis. 
All were mild to moderate and did not lead to study discontinuation. Other AEs with higher rates in the 
secukinumab  group  included  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (Any  secukinumab  group:  4.3%  vs.  placebo 
group: 3.2%), mainly due to nausea (all mild or moderate cases, with none leading to discontinuation), 
and  General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (Any  secukinumab  group:  4.1%  vs.  placebo 
group:  2.2%),  mainly  due  to  injection  site  events  such  as  injection  site  pain,  bruising,  erythema  or 
haematoma  (mainly  mild  and  moderate  cases,  with  one  moderate,  recovering  case  that  resulted  in 
discontinuation in the placebo group). 
Possible suspected treatment-related AEs occurred more frequently for patients in the secukinumab 150 
mg Load group (26.5%) compared to the secukinumab 150 mg No Load group (21.2%). This difference 
was mainly due to nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection (all mild 
or moderate cases for all three of these PTs, with only a few drug interruptions and no discontinuations) 
within the Infections and infestations SOC (secukinumab 150 mg Load group: 16.2% vs. secukinumab 
150 mg No Load group: 9.2%).

The  safety  profile  for  secukinumab  in  non-radiographic  axial  spondylarthritis  patients  in  study 
CAIN457H2315  is  comparable  to  that  of  secukinumab  in  ankylosing  spondylitis  patients  in  study 
CAIN457F2310, based upon the overall frequency of treatment-emergent AEs in the two studies and the 
similarities in the most commonly occurring AEs per SOC. The incidence rates in the secukinumab 150 
mg Load and the No Load group from Study CAIN457H2315 were overall comparable to those of the 
secukinumab group (with loading) in Study CAIN457F2310. Refer to Table 36.

The entire treatment period 
Suspected  study  drug-related  treatment-emergent  AEs  were  reported  more  frequently  in  the 
secukinumab  group  compared  to  placebo  for  the  entire  treatment  period  (Any  secukinumab  group: 
33.1%  vs.  placebo  group:  18.3%).  When  taking  into  account  the  differences  in  exposure  between 
secukinumab (mean days of patient exposure: 509.8 days) and placebo (mean days of patient exposure: 
214.6 days) for the entire study period, causality assessment was similar between the two groups. 
The  overall  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  (EAIR,  per  100  PY)  of  AEs  by  SOC  was  lower  in  the 
composite  secukinumab  group  compared  to  placebo  (166.2  per  100  PY  in  the  Any  AIN457  group  vs. 
200.1 per 100 PY in the placebo group). This difference was primarily due to the imbalance in EAIRs for 
AEs belonging to Infections and infestations (76.1 per 100 PY in the Any AIN457 group vs. 100.6 per 
100 PY in the placebo group). Other AEs by SOC contributing to this imbalance between treatment groups 
include Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (22.8 per 100 PY in the Any AIN457 group vs. 
29.3 per 100 PY in the placebo group), Gastrointestinal disorders (21.6 per 100 PY in the Any AIN457 
group vs. 26.4 per 100 PY in the placebo group), Cardiac disorders (1.5 per 100 PY in the Any AIN457 
group vs. 4.7 per 100 PY in the placebo group) and Blood and lymphatic system disorders (3.3 per 100 
PY in the Any AIN457 group vs. 6.5 per 100 PY in the placebo group). See Tables 37 and 38. 
Treatment comparisons of secukinumab to placebo for the entire treatment period, however, should be 
interpreted with caution, in case the reported event rates are not constant over time. Moreover, reporting 
rates, depending on types of AEs, may vary from the initial trial period, with very frequent study visits 
compared  to  later  study  periods  with  less  frequent  visits.  As  noted  above,  overall  exposure  was 
286.1 patient-years for the AIN457 150 mg Load group, 291.3 patient-years for the AIN457 150 mg No 
Load  group,  757.9  patient-years  for  the  Any  AIN457  group,  and  109.3  patient-years  for  the  placebo 
group. 
The  AIN457  150  mg  Load  group  had  higher  EAIRs  compared  to  the  AIN457  150  mg  No  Load  group 
(212.7 per 100 PY vs. 158.0 per 100 PY). This was mainly due to differences in Infections and infestations 
(91.5  per  100  PY  vs.  71.6  per  100  PY),  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  differences  in  Musculoskeletal  and 
connective tissue disorders (29.6 per 100 PY vs. 21.7 per 100 PY), Gastrointestinal disorders (27.3 per 
100 PY vs. 21.8 per 100 PY), Nervous system disorders (15.7 per 100 PY vs. 11.5 per 100 PY), and Skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders (13.7 per 100 PY vs. 8.6 per 100 PY). Based upon the detailed review 
of  the  events  in  these  SOCs,  taking  into  account  the  nature,  severity,  and  outcome,  there  were  no 
clinically meaningful differences between the AIN457 150 mg Load and No Load groups. See Tables 37 
and 38.

Safety data from secukinumab studies, covering multiple indications, were pooled together to evaluate 
the need for updating the current list of ADRs with new, additional data from study H2315. Among the 
studies involving AS, only study F2305 and study F2310 were included in the pool, as these studies were 
the basis for the registration of the AS indication. However, three other Phase 3 trials have now been 
completed  that  add  to  the  safety  profile  and  are  included  in  AIN457  PSUR  (26-Dec-2017  to  25-Dec-
2018). 
The  incidence  rates  for  all  ADRs  according  to  dosing  regimen  for  all  indications  (psoriasis,  psoriatic 
arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis) have been evaluated. Out 
of a total of 2848 patients, 503 patients (Any secukinumab group: 17.7%) reported upper respiratory 
tract  infection  (HLT)  and  296  patients  (10.4%)  experienced  nasopharyngitis,  both  of  which  were 
designated very common ADRs. Common ADRs included the following: upper respiratory tract infection 
(3.9%),  diarrhea  (3.3%),  rhinitis  (1.3%),  oral  herpes  (1.1%),  pharyngitis  (1.1%),  sinusitis  (0.8%), 
tonsillitis  (0.7%),  tinea  pedis  (0.6%),  and  rhinorrhoea  (0.6%).  Uncommon  events  included  urticaria 
(0.7%), conjunctivitis (0.6%), otitis externa (0.5%), oral candidiasis (0.4%), and neutropenia (0.3%). 
Rare events included anaphylactic reactions (0.04%). The  MAH concluded that the information in the 
SmPC section 4.8 is up to date except for “Tinea pedis” from which the frequency was proposed to be 
moved from uncommon to common.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported for the entire treatment period. 
Serious adverse events 
Non-fatal  SAEs  occurred  more  frequently  in  the  secukinumab  groups  compared  to  placebo  (Any 
secukinumab  group:  7.2%  vs.  placebo:  4.3%).  Discontinuations  due  to  AEs  were  higher  in  the 
secukinumab groups compared to placebo (Any secukinumab: 4.4% vs. placebo: 1.6%). However, when 
taking into account the longer exposure times in terms of mean days of patient exposure on secukinumab 
(509.8  days)  compared  to  placebo  (214.6  days),  the  frequency  of  events  was  comparable  between 
secukinumab and placebo groups (Table 39).

Until 20 weeks a total of 7 secukinumab patients reported at least one SAE (2 patients, 1.1% from the 
secukinumab 150 mg Load group and 4 patients, 2.2% from the secukinumab 150 mg No Load group) 
compared with 4 patients (2.2%) from the placebo group. 
In the secukinumab 150 mg Load group, all the SAEs were moderate in severity and consisted of 
device-related cochlear implant infection, eczema infection (deemed related to study drug by the 
investigator) and wrist fracture. 
Among the 4 patients with SAEs in the secukinumab 150 mg No Load group, severe intervertebral disc 
disorder and myelopathy (both deemed unrelated to study drug by the investigator) was reported in 
one patient, which prompted study drug discontinuation. Two patients interrupted study drug 
treatment during the first 20 weeks due to non-infectious hepatitis (based on LFTs, considered related 
to the study drug by the investigator) in one case and due to gastroenteritis in another case. The 
patient with the gastroenteritis SAE also experienced severe diarrhoea, which was considered related 
to the study drug by the investigator. The fourth patient reported a severe case of sciatica that was 
deemed unrelated to the study drug by the investigator. 
In the placebo group, myocardial infarction, severe pyrexia, back pain, and arteriosclerosis were 
reported, none leading to interruption of study drug. 
Additional SAEs in the secukinumab 150 mg Load group after Week 20 (See also Table 40 which 
includes all the data until week 52 interim cut-off) comprised infections including tonsillitis, vaccination 
site cellulitis (deemed related to the study drug by the investigator), and a severe case of post-
operative wound infection that resulted in study drug interruption. Injuries included one event of brain 
contusion and another event of severe tendon injury; the latter led to study drug interruption. Severe 
Crohn’s colitis in one patient (considered related to the study drug) led to study drug withdrawal, and 
another case of ulcerative colitis (considered related to the study drug) resulted in drug interruption. 
Musculoskeletal disorders included arthritis and back pain, both severe and unrelated (according to the 
investigator), in a single patient. Metabolism disorders included diabetes mellitus and diabetic 
ketoacidosis in 2 patients, both deemed unrelated to the study drug. Renal disorders occurred in 2 
patients, one IgA nephropathy and one nephrolithiasis (both severe), the case of IgA nephropathy led 
to study drug discontinuation and the case of nephrolothiasis led to study drug interruption although 
both were deemed unrelated to the study drug. One patient reported a mild neoplasm (acrochordon), 
unrelated to the study drug, leading to study drug interruption. Respiratory disorders included 
pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax in one patient, considered to be related to the study drug. 
One patient with a previous history of depression and suicide from the secukinumab 150 mg Load 
group, who switched to standard of care (TNF-alpha inhibitor), reported a suicide attempt 10 months 
after the last dose of secukinumab. 
New treatment-emergent SAEs in the secukinumab 150 mg No Load group, occurring after Week 20, 
consisted of Eye disorders (one iridocyclitis),  and Infections and infestations. The infections occurred 
in single patients and consisted of severe tonsillitis, anal abscess, and severe subcutaneous abscess of 
the abdomen that was considered related to the study drug by the investigator and led to temporary 
drug interruption. 
Seven patients in the placebo group who switched to secukinumab treatment after Week 20 reported 
one SAE each: diverticulitis, epiglottitis, arthritis, a severe case of skin disorder, ovarian cyst, back 
disorder, and malignant melanoma. All cases were mild or moderate in severity and deemed unrelated 
to study treatment by the investigator. The malignant melanoma SAE led to discontinuation of the 
study drug, as required by the protocol. 
Eight patients reported SAEs while on placebo treatment that were mild or moderate and deemed 
unrelated to the study drug by the investigator. One patient developed acute coronary syndrome and

viral tracheitis and another patient reported arthralgia. The third patient had a radius fracture prior to 
the switch to secukinumab in the screening period. The fourth patient reported back disorder and the 
following reproductive SAEs: an abnormal pathology test (endometrium pathology), Bartholin’s cyst, 
cervix enlargement, and vaginal prolapse. Cervix enlargement and vaginal prolapse both led to 
interruption of the study drug.

Adverse events of special interest 
In order to properly manage all safety risks, a safety profiling plan (SPP) was developed for the 
secukinumab development program. The following SPP risks were evaluated up to Week 20, based 
upon reported treatment-emergent AEs for all treatment groups: compound and class-related risks, 
important identified risks, and important potential risks (Tables 41 and 42). 
Compound and class-related risks included Immune/administration reactions and various infections 
(Infectious pneumonia, Fungal infections, Viral herpes, and Skin structure infections). Overall low rates 
were observed between treatment groups for injection site reactions (HLT) and herpes viral infection 
(HLT) (secukinumab 150 mg Load group: 3.2%, secukinumab 150 mg No Load group: 1.1%, Any 
secukinumab: 2.2%, and placebo: 1.6%, for injection site reactions (HLT); secukinumab 150 mg Load 
group: 2.2%, secukinumab 150 mg No Load group: 1.6%, Any secukinumab: 1.9%, placebo: 1.1%, 
for herpes viral infections (HLT)). Incidence rates of fungal infectious disorders (HLGT) were similar 
across treatment groups, and only one case each of Infectious pneumonia (NMQ, broad search) were 
noted in the secukinumab 150 mg Load group and placebo group. No events for oesophageal 
candidiasis (narrow search) and mycobacterial infections were reported up to Week 20. 
Important identified risks present in both secukinumab and placebo treatment groups included 
Infections, Hypersensitivity, and Neutropenia, with Infections representing the most frequently 
reported risk among all risks from the SPP. Comparable rates of Infections and infestations (SOC) were 
reported across treatment groups (secukinumab 150 mg Load group: 38.4%, secukinumab 150 mg No 
Load group: 33.2%, Any secukinumab: 35.8%, placebo: 33.3%). Incidence rates of Hypersensitivity 
(SMQ, narrow search) were also comparable across groups (secukinumab 150 mg Load group: 4.9%, 
secukinumab 150 mg No Load group: 4.3%, Any secukinumab: 4.6%, placebo: 3.2%). A search of 
Neutropenia (NMQ, narrow search) yielded comparable rates in the Any secukinumab group compared 
to placebo. 
Important potential risks included malignant or unspecified tumors, MACE, Suicidal ideation and 
behavior, IBD, Hepatitis B reactivation and Interactions with live vaccines. A search of Inflammatory 
bowel disease (NMQ, narrow search) for the important potential risk of Crohn's disease revealed one 
case in the secukinumab 150 mg No Load group of a patient with no prior history of inflammatory 
disease. A total of seven cases of IBD were reported in the entire study period (5 cases of Crohn’s 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 80/103 
 
 
 
 
disease and 2 cases of ulcerative colitis). Two of the patients had a history of IBD. Three of these 
cases were reported as SAEs; the other four cases were AEs. Three of the reported AEs were mild or 
moderate with one event reported as severe (ulcerative colitis). Three of the IBD events resulted in 
drug discontinuation (two of the SAEs and one AE). 
No MACE events were reported in the secukinumab groups. Only one patient in the placebo group 
reported a MACE event of myocardial infarction.  
No cases of Hepatitis B reactivation, Interactions with live vaccines, or Malignancies were found.  
One case of attempted suicide occurred off-treatment (44.7 weeks after last dose of secukinumab) in a 
patient with a previous history of depression and suicide attempt who had switched from secukinumab 
150 mg Load to standard of care.

In addition to the same SPP risks reported up to Week 20, additional SPP risks were observed during the 
period after Week 20. These risks were mainly compound and class-related risks (Central nervous system 
infections and inflammations, Staphylococcal infections, Malignant or unspecified tumours (except non-
melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and malignant and unspecified skin tumours) and the important potential 
risk of Malignant or unspecified tumours. The risks reported after Week 20 often occurred in 1-2 patients 
within a single treatment group. See Table 42.

Immunogenicity 
Eight patients showed ADAs, with one of them having a positive result at both baseline and post-
baseline. Only one patient was noted to have a treatment-emergent ADA (i.e., negative at baseline 
and positive post-exposure) at Week 52. Two patients reported AEs that were possibly related to 
immunogenicity. One patient with ADA detected only at baseline had a non-serious AE (contact 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020

dermatitis) that occurred at Day 522. Another possibly IG-related AE (allergic rhinitis) occurred at Day 
525 in the patient with an ADA signal at baseline and post-baseline. 
Laboratory findings 
Criteria for clinically notable laboratory abnormalities were based on CTCAE grades for the following 
parameters: heamoglobin, platelets, WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, creatinine, total bilirubin (TBL), 
gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG). 
Haematology 
Up to week 20, Grade 1 and 2 decreases in haemoglobin and lymphocytes were comparable between 
the treatment groups. Small numerical differences were observed between treatment groups in Grade 
1 leukocyte abnormalities, and Grade 2 leukocyte decreases were infrequent and showed no clinically 
meaningful differences. No Grade 3 or 4 decreases were reported for haemoglobin, leukocytes, 
lymphocytes, or platelets. Neutrophil decreases were low in frequency among the Grade 1 and 2 
categories. One Grade 3 decrease in neutrophil count was reported in the secukinumab 150 mg Load 
group and one Grade 4 abnormality was noted in the placebo group. The Grade 3 on-treatment 
abnormality was deemed related to study drug by the investigator and occurred in a patient with a 
mild, non-serious upper respiratory tract infection around the same time period. Both the neutropenia 
and URTI did not require interruption of the study drug. This was a single event occurring early in the 
study (Week 2). With the exception of a Grade 1 decrease in neutrophil count at Week 52, all other 
values for this patient before and after Week 2 were within normal range. The Grade 4 abnormality in 
the placebo patient also occurred at the start of the study (Week 2), with all other values within 
normal range. 
Similar to the data results from the first 20 weeks, most of the haematological abnormalities reported 
for the entire treatment period were Grade 1 or 2. Among the more severe grades occurring after 
Week 20, a Grade 3 decrease in lymphocyte count was noted in one patient in the secukinumab 150 
mg No Load group. The patient had the following AEs (in chronological order): stomach pain, 
diarrhoea, IBD, and Crohn's disease starting at Week 16 with Crohn's diagnosis at around the time of 
the Week 52 visit. The patient entered the study with a lymphocyte cell count screening value of 1 X 
109/L, with values below 1 x 109/L for most visits, and no value exceeding 1.3 x 109/L. One new case 
of a Grade 3 decrease in neutrophil count was reported in a patient who was a placebo-switcher. The 
Grade 3 neutropenia event resolved without study drug interruption or discontinuation. One case of 
Grade 3 neutropenia in the AIN457 150 mg Load group, and one case of Grade 4 neutropenia in the 
placebo group had been reported previously in the first 20 weeks of the study. After Week 20, two new 
cases of Grade 3 neutropenia were reported in patients who were placebo switchers. 
Chemistry 
Most of the newly occurring or worsening chemistry laboratory abnormalities up to Week 20 were 
CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. One Grade 3 AST abnormality was reported each in the secukinumab 150 mg 
Load group and in the placebo group; there were no Grade 3 or 4 ALT abnormalities. The abnormalities 
occurring at the highest frequencies among all chemistry parameters were cholesterol and fasting 
levels of triglycerides. The following shifts in grade of abnormalities were reported: 
•  An AST shift from normal levels to Grade 3 occurred in one patient in the AIN457 150 mg Load 
group and in one patient in the placebo group. 
•  A shift in cholesterol levels from Grade 2 to Grade 3 occurred in one patient in the AIN457 150 
mg Load group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020

•  Decreased fasting serum glucose levels shifted from normal range to Grade 3 in one patient in 
the AIN457 150 mg No Load group. 
• 
• 
Increased  fasting  serum  glucose  levels  shifted  from Grade  2  to  Grade 3 in one  patient  in the 
AIN457 150 mg Load group and three patients in the placebo group. 
Triglycerides levels shifted from Grade 2 to Grade 3 in two patients in the AIN457 150 mg Load 
group and in one patient in the placebo group. 
As seen in the data for the first 20 weeks, the majority of patients had values within normal range at 
baseline with low frequencies of patients shifting to Grade 1 or Grade 2 for the entire treatment period. 
In addition to the observed shifts in CTCAE grades up to Week 20, the entire treatment period also 
included shifts in grades for ALT and gamma glutamyl transferase. The additional shifts reported after 
Week 20 are as follows: 
•  ALT levels shifted from normal range to Grade 3 in one patient in the secukinumab 150 mg No 
Load group. 
•  Additional shifts in AST levels from normal range to Grade 3 were reported after Week 20 in two 
patients in the secukinumab 150 mg Load group, one patient in the secukinumab 150 mg No 
Load group and one placebo-switcher. 
•  A  shift  from  Grade  2  to  Grade  3  in  cholesterol  levels  was  reported  in  one  patient  in  the 
AIN457 150 mg  Load  group  during  the  first  20  weeks.  After  Week  20,  no  additional  shifts  in 
cholesterol levels were reported. 
•  Gamma glutamyl transferase levels had shifted from Grade 1 to Grade 3 in one patient in the 
AIN457 150 mg Load group, from normal range to Grade 3 in two patients in the AIN457 150 
mg No Load group, and from Grade 2 to Grade 3 in one patient in the placebo group. 
•  Decreased fasting serum glucose levels shifted from normal range to Grade 4 in one patient in 
the AIN457 150 mg Load group and from Grade 1 to Grade 4 in one patient in the AIN457 150 
mg No Load group. A shift from normal range to Grade 3 was reported in the placebo group. A 
shift from normal range to Grade 3 was previously reported in a patient in the AIN457 150 mg 
No Load group during the first 20 weeks of the study. 
• 
• 
Increased fasting serum glucose levels shifted from Grade 1 to Grade 3 in two patients in the 
AIN457 150 mg Load group. Shifts from Grade 2 to Grade 3 in one patient in the AIN457 150 
mg Load group and in three patients in the placebo group were reported previously in the first 
20 weeks. 
Fasting levels of triglycerides shifted from normal range to Grade 3 in the AIN457 150 mg Load 
and the AIN457 150 mg No Load groups (one patient in each group). One patient in the AIN457 
150 mg Load group experienced a shift from Grade 1 to Grade 3. Shifts from Grade 2 to Grade 
3 in two patients in the AIN457 150 mg Load group and in one patient in the placebo group were 
reported during the first 20 weeks of the study. 
Abnormalities in AST levels were observed at > 3 x ULN and > 5 x ULN. There were no patients with 
AST levels > 8 x ULN. As seen for Week 20, four patients reported total bilirubin (TBL) > 1.5 x ULN only 
in the secukinumab group. Increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were also reported during the 
entire treatment period in the AIN457 150 mg No Load group (one patient each at ALP levels > 2 x ULN, 
and > 3 x ULN). No patient met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s Law.

Vital signs 
Rates of elevated systolic blood pressure were similar between all groups (secukinumab 150 mg Load 
group:  18.0%,  secukinumab  150  mg  No  Load  group:  19.7%,  Any  secukinumab  group:  18.9%,  and 
placebo: 19.0%). 
Elevations  were  more  frequent  than  decreases  in  diastolic  blood  pressure  for  all  treatment  groups. 
Diastolic  blood  pressure  increases  were  higher  in  the  secukinumab  150  mg  No  Load  group  (19.1%) 
compared to the secukinumab 150 mg Load group (15.1%), and placebo (16.8%). Decreases in diastolic 
blood pressure were higher in the secukinumab groups compared to placebo (secukinumab 150 mg Load 
group: 5.5%, secukinumab 150 mg No Load group: 5.6%, Any secukinumab group: 5.5%, and placebo: 
4.3%). 
Decreases in pulse rate (secukinumab 150 mg Load group: 14.6%, secukinumab 150 mg No Load group: 
13.0%, Any secukinumab group: 13.9%, and placebo: 14.0%) were more frequent than elevated pulse 
rates  (secukinumab  150  mg  Load  group:  2.2%,  secukinumab  150  mg  No  Load  group:  3.3%,  Any 
secukinumab group: 2.7%, and placebo: 3.2%) for all treatment groups. Both elevated and decreased 
pulse rates were similar across treatment groups. 
Observed trends in the entire treatment period were similar to those seen up to Week 20. 
There were no clinically significant ECG abnormalities reported for this interim analysis. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors analysed included age, gender, race, and weight while extrinsic factors included prior 
use of TNF-alpha inhibitors, concomitant use of methotrexate, and concomitant use of corticosteroids. 
Since the number of patients were highly imbalanced between age groups (<65, ≥65), no meaningful 
comparisons  could  be  made  between  the  two  age  groups.  However,  the  reported  AEs  by  SOC  were 
similar to that of the overall population and consistent between data up to Week 20 and data up to Week 
52. 
The reported AEs by SOC for each of the subgroups (males, females) were similar to that of the overall 
population and consistent between data up to Week 20 and data up to Week 52. 
Since  the  number  of  patients  were  highly  imbalanced  between  race  groups  with  over  90%  of  the 
population being White, no meaningful comparisons could be made between the various race groups. 
However, the reported AEs by SOC were similar to that of the overall population and consistent between 
data up to Week 20 and data up to Week 52. 
Among the three weight subgroups, the highest incidence rates of AEs for secukinumab were reported 
in the >90 kg subgroup and the lowest incidence rates of AEs for secukinumab reported in the 70-90 kg 
subgroup, with higher incidence rates in the secukinumab group compared to placebo in all three groups. 
The reported AEs were similar to that of the overall population and consistent between data up to Week 
20 and data up to Week 52. 
The mean duration of exposure was longer in inadequate responders to TNF-alpha inhibitors compared 
to TNF-alpha inhibitor naive patients (Any secukinumab for inadequate responders: 481.1 days vs. naive 
patients: 402.5 days). Similar to the initial 20-week period, since the majority of patients in the study 
were naive to TNF-alpha inhibitor treatment, the trends observed in the incidence rates of AEs and SAEs 
in this subgroup up to Week 52 were similar to that of the overall population. The reported AEs and SAEs 
in both subgroups were consistent with that of the overall population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 88/103 
 
 
 
As  observed  in  the  first  20  weeks,  since  the  majority  of  patients  in  the  study  did  not  take  MTX,  the 
patterns of AEs and SAEs reported for MTX non-users up to Week 52 were similar to that of the overall 
population. Reported AEs in both subgroups were consistent with that of the overall population. 
The mean duration of exposure was longer in corticosteroid users compared to corticosteroid non-users 
(Any secukinumab for corticosteroid users: 433.0 days vs. non-users: 407.6 days). Similar to Week 20, 
as the majority of patients in the study were not concomitant corticosteroid users, the patterns of AEs 
and SAEs observed in this subgroup were similar to that of the overall population. The reported AEs and 
SAEs in both subgroups were consistent with those in the overall population. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The majority of patients in the study did not take MTX or sulfasalazine (90.1% and 85.2% of the total 
population); therefore, the patterns of AEs and SAEs reported for MTX or sulphasalazine non-users were 
similar to that of the overall population. The profile of AEs in each of these subgroups was consistent 
with that observed for the overall population for both the 20-week and 52-week treatment periods. Thus, 
concomitant MTX or sulfasalazine use does not change the safety profile of secukinumab in patients with 
nr-axSpA based on this study. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
All reasons for discontinuation from the study before week 24 are listed in Table 43. 
Table 43 Patient disposition at Week 24 in Study H2315 (Randomized Set) 
For the entire treatment period, the incidence of AEs causing study drug discontinuation was higher 
in  the  secukinumab  150  mg  No  Load  group  compared  to  the  secukinumab  150  mg  Load  group  and 
placebo (secukinumab 150 mg No Load group: 7.1% vs. secukinumab 150 mg Load group: 3.8% and 
placebo: 1.6%). Refer to Table 46. 
Table 44 Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation by preferred term irrespective 
of causality in study H2315 entire treatment period (Safety Set) 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 89/103 
 
 
 
 
AEs leading to temporary dose interruption  up  to  Week  20  were  reported  at  similar  rates  in  the 
secukinumab dose groups and placebo (Any secukinumab group: 8.7% vs. placebo: 7.5%). Similar rates 
were  also  observed  between  the  secukinumab  treatment  groups  (secukinumab  150  mg  Load  group: 
8.1% and secukinumab 150 mg No Load group: 9.2%). The most commonly affected SOC was Infections 
and infestations, occurring at incidence rates of 4.6% in the Any secukinumab group and 4.8% in the 
placebo group. 
Over the entire treatment period, AEs leading to temporary interruption of study treatment were reported 
at a similar frequency in the secukinumab groups compared to placebo (Any secukinumab: 14.5% vs. 
placebo: 8.1%) when taking into account the difference in terms of patient years of exposure. Due to 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 90/103 
 
 
 
 
the greater number of patient years (approximately 5 times more) in the secukinumab group than the 
placebo group for the entire treatment period, these crude rates, when adjusted, would reflect a higher 
frequency  in  the  placebo  group  compared  to  the  secukinumab  group.  Higher  incidence  rates  were 
reported in the secukinumab 150 mg Load group compared to the secukinumab 150 mg No Load group 
(21.6%  vs.  13.6%,  respectively).  The  majority  of  dose  interruptions  were  caused  by  AEs  in  the  SOC 
Infections  and  infestations  (Any  secukinumab  group:  8.8%  vs.  placebo:  4.8%).  The  majority  of 
Infections and infestations reported in the secukinumab groups were nasopharyngitis (6 events), upper 
respiratory tract infection (5 events), urinary tract infection (5 events), and pharyngitis (4 events). In 
the placebo group, only single events occurred within the Infections and infestations SOC. 
Post marketing experience 
Cosentyx  was  first  registered  in  Japan  on  26  Dec  2014.  Through  the  end  of  this  reporting  interval, 
Novartis (including Sandoz and Alcon) has obtained approvals in 92 countries worldwide (including 31 
European Union/European Economic Area [EU/EEA] countries through European Medicines Agency [EMA] 
approval). Cosentyx is registered in the following indications: 
•  Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
• 
Psoriatic arthritis 
•  Ankylosing spondylitis 
• 
Pustular psoriasis (Japan only) 
The  combined  exposure  to  secukinumab  and  comparators  from  both  completed  studies  and  ongoing 
studies with interim analysis database locks up to 25 Dec 2018 is presented in Table 47. 
Table  45  Combined subject exposure to secukinumab  by age and gender  from  both  completed  studies 
and ongoing studies with interim analysis database locks 
An  estimate  of  patient  exposure  is  calculated  based  on  worldwide  sales  volume  in  kilograms  (kg)  of 
active substance sold during the reporting interval and the average maintenance daily dose (10 mg). 
The  sales  volume  of  Cosentyx  during  the  reporting  interval  was  approximately  501.2  kg  (active 
substance). 
The estimated interval exposure was approximately 137,325 patient-treatment years (PTY). During the 
interval covered by the previous PSUR (26 Dec 2016 to 25 Dec 2017), the estimated cumulative exposure 
was approximately 148,485 PTY. 
The  cumulative  patient  exposure  since  the  International  Birth  Date  of  the  product  is  estimated  to  be 
approximately 285,811 PTY. Refer to table 48.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The MAH has evaluated the safety profile of secukinumab and placebo in study H2315 dividing it to two 
phases, the initial 20 weeks (including all the patients on placebo) and the entire treatment period 
(some placebo patients converted to secukinumab). In addition, the MAH has pooled safety findings 
from 9 placebo controlled phase III studies in non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis, ankylosing 
spondylitis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in order to evaluate the need to update the SmPC section 
4.8. 
The total exposure of secukinumab in non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis in the interim analysis at 
week 52 was 286.1 patient-years for the AIN457 150 mg Load group, 291.3 patient-years for the 
AIN457 150 mg No Load group, 757.9 patient-years for the Any AIN457 group, and 109.3 patient-
years for the placebo group. The median secukinumab exposure per patient was roughly 540 days and 
for placebo 145 days. The CHMP is of the opinion that this provides a sufficient dataset for the safety 
evaluation. 
A slightly elevated incidence of infections in the secukinumab groups was observed compared to the 
placebo group. Patients with loading regimen appeared to have a slightly elevated incidence of upper 
respiratory tract infections, diarrhoea, headache, oropharyngeal pain, nausea, and urinary infections 
compared to non-loading regimen. The increased frequency of infections seems to have increased the 
need for temporary dose interruptions in the loading secukinumab group. The AE profile during the 
initial 20-week observation period resembled closely the AE profile in the initial psoriasis submission. 
Compared to the previous ankylosing spondylitis submission and the initial 16 or 20 week phase with 
placebo group, the incidence of AEs in different organ classes appeared quite similar, if not less severe. 
For the entire treatment period, the differences between the loading and non-loading groups 
diminished, as the exposures approach each other. Exposure adjusted incidence rates of most of the 
AEs (preferred terms) did not significantly differ between the secukinumab and placebo groups. There 
were no new significant AE findings. 
Based on the pooled data analysis, from nine randomised phase III studies in psoriasis, ankylosing 
spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis, the SmPC section 4.8 was 
considered to be up to date except for the change in frequency for “Tinea pedis” from uncommon to 
common frequency class. This change was acceptable to CHMP. 
There were no deaths in study H2315. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 92/103 
 
 
 
 
Serious adverse events were reported from 10.8%, 6.5%, and 4.3% of patients in loading dose group, 
non-loading dose group, and placebo group, respectively, during the entire treatment period. SAEs 
were reported mostly as single occurrences randomly observed from each treatment group. 
A total of seven cases of IBD were reported in the entire study period (5 cases of Crohn’s disease and 
2 cases of ulcerative colitis). Two of the patients had a history of IBD. Three of these cases were 
reported as SAEs; the other four cases were AEs. One case of Crohn’s disease and two cases of 
ulcerative colitis were considered attributable to secukinumab treatment and resulted in 
discontinuation. IBD and IL-17 antagonists are currently under evaluation. One suicide attempt took 
place in a patient 10 months after last secukinumab dose, not implying to a causal relationship. 
Malignant melanoma was observed in one patient switching from placebo to secukinumab resulting in 
discontinuation from the study. These findings are not considered of concern or requiring changes to 
the RMP or SmPC. 
The immunogenic potential of secukinumab appeared negligible, as it has been also earlier. There were 
no new findings regarding the effects of secukinumab on the haematology or chemistry laboratory 
findings, or vital signs. 
The subgroup analyses (intrinsic factors: age <65 or ≥65 years, gender, race, or weight 70-90 or >90 
kg, or extrinsic factors: TNF-alpha naïve or non-responders, concomitant MTX or sulphasalazine yes or 
no, concomitant corticosteroids yes or no) did not reveal any meaningful differences between the 
subgroups in the AE/SAE profiles. 
The discontinuation rates during the initial 24 weeks were 5.4%, 3.8%, and 5.9% in loading 
secukinumab group, non-loading secukinumab group, and the placebo group, respectively. 2, 4, and 2 
patients, respectively, discontinued due to AEs. For the entire study, the discontinuations due to AEs 
took place in 3.8%, 7.1%, and 1.6% in loading secukinumab group, non-loading secukinumab group, 
and the placebo group, respectively. 
Somewhat higher rates of temporary dose interruptions were reported in the loading secukinumab 
group compared to the non-loading secukinumab group (21.6% vs. 13.6%, respectively), mainly 
attributable to the slightly more frequent infections in the loading secukinumab group. 
Judged from the discontinuation rates or temporary dose interruption rates, the CHMP concluded that 
there seems to be no clinically significant difference between the loading or non-loading regimens 
regarding the tolerability. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The AE and ADR profile of secukinumab is well established from the clinical studies submitted for the 
already approved indications. There were no new safety concerns identified in the current submission 
aimed at treatment of moderate to severe non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis. The SmPC section 
4.8 was updated to change the frequency for “Tinea pedis” from uncommon to common frequency. 
Long term follow-up safety data in the applied for indication is currently lacking. However, this is 
alleviated by the fact, that there is an extensive database on long term safety follow-up in the 
approved indications and that the clinical use has been extensive.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this group of variations, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being 
updated to reflect the extension of indication. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  A  full  user  test  was  performed  and  found  acceptable  for  the  original  application  of  Cosentyx 
(secukinumab) in the indication of plaque psoriasis. Two additional full user tests of the Cosentyx 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 96/103 
 
 
 
 
PL  were  performed  during  the  registration  of  the  psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA)  and  ankylosing 
spondylitis (AS) indications. 
• 
The approved Cosentyx PL has now been updated with information related to the new proposed 
indication of nr-axSpA. The changes proposed to be included in the PL are minor and limited to 
the following: 
o 
o 
o 
the indication wording, which is comparable to wording for compounds already approved 
for  the  nr-axSpA  indication  in  Europe  (Humira/adalimumab,  Enbrel/etanercept, 
Cimzia/certolizumab and Simponi/golimumab), 
the posology wording, which is the same as the one tested in 2015 for the AS indication, 
and 
the  change  in  frequency  of  one  side  effect  (tinea  pedis),  a  term  which  was  already 
included  in  the  Cosentyx  PL  at  the  time  of  the  previous  user  testing  consultations 
performed in 2014 and 2015. 
•  Given that the proposed changes to the PL are not significant and were either already tested in 
a  previous  user  consultation  of  the  PL  or  are  already  used  in  approved  PLs  available  on  the 
market for the same indication, a new user consultation is not deemed necessary. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The concept of spondyloarthritis (SpA) as described in the EU Guideline (EMA/CPMP/EWP/4891/03 
Rev.1, Corr 1) comprises a group of diseases which share common clinical and genetic features, and 
includes ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis, arthritis/spondylitis with inflammatory bowel 
disease, reactive arthritis, as well as undifferentiated SpA. All of these can present with a 
predominantly peripheral or axial arthritis. 
Axial SpA (axSpA) is defined as a chronic inflammatory disease that involves primarily the sacroiliac 
joints and the axial skeleton. Clinical manifestations usually begin in late adolescence or early 
adulthood (mean age of onset 26 years) and onset after age 45 is rare. Clinical manifestations include 
lower back pain with predominant nocturnal pain, morning stiffness and impaired physical function. 
Also chest pain, pain and swelling of peripheral joints and extra-articular tenderness may occur as well 
as several extra-skeletal manifestations such as anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel 
disease. 
The diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, the most frequent subtype of axial SpA, requires the presence 
of radiographic sacroiliitis. However, it is now well established that patients with axial SpA who do not 
meet radiographic criteria for sacroiliitis may experience a significant burden of disease that is 
comparable to patients with well-defined AS. The 2009 ASAS criteria thus define the entity of axial 
spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) which includes a broader set of patients than the original 1984 criteria for 
AS. The new group is captured under the term “non-radiographic axial SpA” and can be identified by 
the presence of clinical features of axial SpA combined with either “imaging” evidence (active 
sacroiliitis seen on the MRI scan) or HLA-B27 positivity (“clinical arm”). 
The prevalence of axial SpA (including AS and non-radiographic forms) is estimated to be 0.3-0.8%. 
The prevalence of AS is estimated around 0.1 % - 0.5 % of the European population. While AS is more 
common in males (male to female ratio is estimated to be 2-3:1), women are slightly more often 
Assessment report  
EMA/199991/2020  
Page 97/103 
 
 
 
affected compared to men in the nr-axSpA stage. AxSpA tends to be more severe in men, in whom the 
spine is more frequently involved. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
According to clinical guidelines, physical therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
comprise the first line treatment in axial SpA. Physical therapy has a positive effect on stiffness and on 
spinal mobility and even on pain. NSAIDs are used to control pain with good response in up to 50-70% 
of axial SpA patients, and due to their high symptomatic efficacy and possible disease-modifying 
properties, NSAIDs are considered the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with axial SpA 
and if tolerated, these are usually maintained as background therapy in patients with insufficient 
response. 
Several biological products, including anti-TNF agents and secukinumab, are authorised for use in 
patients with AS who continue to have active disease despite NSAIDs. In Europe, several anti-TNF 
agents (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept and golimumab) are also authorised for nr-axSpA 
with objective signs of inflammation; in the US, only certolizumab pegol is authorised for nr-axSpA. 
Whereas anti-TNF agents have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of nr-axSpA, a 
substantial proportion of patients do not show a good therapeutic response to these agents. The 
impact of these agents on axSpA-associated structural damage and diseases progression also remains 
to be established. There remains a need for new therapies, including therapies with alternative 
mechanisms of action beyond TNF inhibition. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This single study submission comprises a clinical study report from an ongoing randomised, placebo-
controlled Phase 3 study assessing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two different regimens of 
secukinumab, 150 mg with loading and without loading, compared to placebo in patients with nr-
axSpA. The MAH is not applying for authorisation for the regimen without loading. 
The study population consisted of adult patients fulfilling the ASAS classification criteria for nr-axSpA 
and active disease despite treatment with NSAIDs, as evidenced by an abnormal CRP value and/or 
evidence of inflammation in the sacroiliac joints (SI-joints) on MRI. A limited number of patients who 
had experienced an inadequate response to a TNF inhibitor were enrolled into the study. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Reported pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity data from study H2315 are consistent with previous 
observations within other secukinumab development programmes. 
In the primary analysis at Week 16, secukinumab 150 mg Load was superior to placebo in the ASAS40 
response using non-responder imputation in TNF-alpha naïve patients with active nr-axSpA (41.5% vs. 
29.2%; p=0.0197).  
The  result  on  the  primary  endpoint  is  supported  by  analyses  of  secondary  endpoints,  where  both 
secukinumab groups consistently demonstrated efficacy on variables related to inflammation and disease 
activity, function and health-related quality of life.  
In an ancillary analysis based on Analysis Plan B, maintenance of effect until Week 52 was demonstrated 
based on the primary endpoint as well as most secondary endpoints.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Based on the reported data and consistent with observations in AS patients, response rates were 
higher for secukinumab vs. placebo in both TNF-naïve and TNF-IR patients. Due to the small sample 
size, observations in the TNF-IR nr-axSpA subpopulation need to be viewed with considerable caution. 
However, as the reported data is based on a conservative non-responder imputation, even the limited 
dataset was considered by the CHMP to generally support efficacy in TNF-IR patients at Week 16. 
Furthermore, it is currently unknown whether a nr-axSpA patient responding well to therapy should be 
treated indefinitely, or whether discontinuation of treatment can be considered at some point. This 
question is currently being explored in clinical trials with several TNF inhibitors. Considering that 
secukinumab would represent a new mechanism of action in the treatment of active nr-axSpA, the 
MAH has committed, based on CHMP’s recommendations, to conducting an adequately designed 
clinical trial (with a randomised withdrawal design) with the goal to assess whether treatment in a well 
responding nr-axSpA patient should be continued indefinitely. In accordance with the current EU 
Guideline, the CHMP agreed that this study can be conducted in the post-approval setting. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The AE and ADR profile of secukinumab is well established from the clinical studies submitted for the 
already approved indications.  
There were no new safety concerns identified in the current submission aimed at treatment of active 
non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis.  
The SmPC section 4.8 was updated to change the frequency for “Tinea pedis” from uncommon to 
common frequency. 
The RMP was updated to change the due date of the Psoriasis Registry (category 3 study). This was 
considered acceptable. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long term follow-up safety data in the applied for indication is currently lacking. However, this is 
alleviated by the fact, that there is an extensive database on long term safety follow-up in the 
approved indications and by the extensive clinical use available to date.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
It seems well established that patients with active nr-axSpA despite treatment with NSAIDs experience 
a persistent burden from the disease, and currently available TNF inhibitors are not universally 
effective in the treatment of nr-axSpA. As such, there remains a need for new therapies in this 
indication, where secukinumab represents a new mechanism of action.  
In the current study, robust demonstration of efficacy was obtained at Week 16 across symptomatic and 
functional  aspects  of  nr-axSpA,  and  MRI  and  hsCRP  data  support  a  direct  effect  on  the  inflammatory 
component of the disease. A beneficial effect was also seen on quality of life. In an ancillary analysis 
based on Analysis Plan B, maintenance of effect until Week 52 was demonstrated based on the primary 
endpoint as well as most secondary endpoints. 
Despite the very small number of TNF-IR patients enrolled in the study, data demonstrating activity in 
TNF-IR patient supports consideration of secukinumab as a valuable treatment option for such 
patients. 
The potential unfavourable effects of secukinumab are already well established based both on clinical 
trials in other indications as well as its clinical use in the post-marketing setting. No new signals or 
safety concerns have been identified in the current study. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Data presented by the MAH demonstrates the efficacy of secukinumab in the “treatment of active non-
radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-
reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence in adults who have 
responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)”, and the safety profile is in 
line with the known safety profile for Cosentyx. Consequently, the benefit-risk balance is considered 
positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Cosentyx is positive.

version 5.1. Minor editorial change was made in the Annex II. 
One type IB C.I.11.z to change the due date of the Psoriasis Registry (category 3 study) within the 
RMP. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the group of variations, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and 
to the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

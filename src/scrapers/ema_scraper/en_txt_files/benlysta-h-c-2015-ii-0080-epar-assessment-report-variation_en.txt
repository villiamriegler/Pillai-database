2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The marketing authorisation approval of belimumab (Benlysta) for treatment of systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) in  2011 was based on clinical trials in subjects with  active SLE receiving standard 
therapy. Due to the differences in treatment  and efficacy measures between SLE and lupus nephritis 
(LN),  subjects with severe active renal lupus were excluded from these trials. The MAH  has since 
conducted BEL114054,  a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the 
efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) belimumab plus standard therapy compared to placebo plus 
standard therapy for induction and maintenance of renal response and prevention of renal worsening in 
adult subjects with  active LN  over a 2-year treatment period.  This study was a Post-Marketing 
Commitment (PMC)  to the US Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) and a Category 3 Study in the EU 
RMP.  
In this variation application, the MAH  sought initially to include the  following therapeutic indication: 
- treatment of lupus nephritis in  adult patients who are receiving standard therapy. 
The proposed posology in Section 4.2 of the SmpC was: 
- Subcutaneous dosing: 400 mg dose (two  200 mg injections) once weekly for 4 doses, then 200 mg once 
weekly thereafter. In patients  not requiring induction therapy for lupus nephritis,  the recommended 
dosage is 200 mg once weekly 
- Intravenous dosing: 10 mg/kg Benlysta on Days 0, 14  and 28,  and at 4 week intervals thereafter. 
- Transition from IV to SC administration: first subcutaneous injection could be proposed 1  to 2 weeks 
after the last intravenous dose. The transition  could occur any time after the  patient completes the first 2 
intravenous doses. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
SLE is a heterogeneous chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease. A complex interplay between 
abnormally activated B and T cells, antigen presenting cells, and the complement system results in a 
multisystem injury, including kidneys [Anders, 2016 1; Menez, 2018 2; Lech, 2013 3;  Edelbauer, 2011 4]. 
Renal involvement is present in an average of 38%  of patients  at the time of SLE diagnosis and occurs in 
40-70%  of SLE patients during the course of their disease. SLE patients  that are more likely to develop 
renal disease are typically of younger age, are male and are African, Asian or Hispanic. Approximately 10-
20% of patients progress to  ESRD within  10-15 years since LN diagnosis. LN  is the most common and

severe systemic manifestation of SLE that remains the  most significant cause of morbidity and mortality 
[Hanly, 2016Error! Bookmark not defined.; Menez, 20182; Anders, 2020 5]. 
LN  is an immune complex mediated glomerulonephritis. Intra-renal pathogenesis of LN  includes antibody 
binding to  multiple intrarenal autoantigens, tertiary lymphoid tissue formation with  local antibody 
production and complement activation resulting  in complement-mediated damage, and release of 
cytokines associated with  cellular proliferation and matrix formation. Elevated serum and intra-renal 
levels of B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) play an important role in development and perpetuation of renal 
inflammation cycle [Lech, 20133;  Liu, 2014 6;  Kang, 2017 7]. 
The location of immune complex deposition as confirmed by renal biopsy, defines the different 
histopathological classes of LN according to the Renal Pathology Society Working Group and the 
International Society of Nephrology Working Group (ISN/RPS Criteria from 2003) classification and 
informs the LN management and prognosis. 
LN  manifestations range from minimal proteinuria and microscopic hematuria to nephrotic range 
proteinuria, urinary casts, severe hypertension, peripheral edema, and renal insufficiency or acute renal 
failure. Typical disease course of LN is characterized by episodes of flares interspersed between periods of 
disease quiescence [Yap, 2018 8]. The proportion of LN  patients experiencing a flare will vary depending 
on LN  stage, therapies used and adherence to said therapies [Haji,  2017 9]. Each LN flare and poorly 
controlled renal disease activity between the flares result in accumulating nephron loss and progressive 
decline in renal function  decades before the end of normal life span, making LN a major risk factor for 
progression to ESRD and mortality in SLE [Anders, 20161]. In a recent review of a large inception SLE 
cohort, patients had significantly higher risks of developing ESRD (HR:  44.7, 95%  CI: 6.1-329.7)  and 
death (HR: 3.2,  95% CI: 1.6-6.5)  after being diagnosed with LN  [Hanly, 2016 10;  Almaani, 2017 11; Menez, 
20182]. 
Mortality  is highest  amongst SLE patients with  proliferative renal involvement (Classes III and IV) and 
progression to renal failure is strongly predictive of mortality. This poor prognosis is related to risk 
associated with  the development of chronic renal disease, as well as manifestations of more severe forms 
of systemic disease and cardiovascular complications [Anders, 20161;  Almaani, 201711].  Pure 
membranous LN  (Class V) is a less common form of LN, but  some studies have found that  its impact is 
almost as high  as diffuse proliferative LN [Vachvanichsanong, 2009 12].  It has been reported that  in 
approximately 40% of patients with  pure Class V LN, it  eventually transformed to proliferative LN 
[Narvaez, 2017 13].

Clinical management 
At present, there are no (e.g., US) or limited  (e.g., UK, cyclophosphamide/corticosteroid) approved 
treatment options for LN.  Current approaches to the  management of LN continue  to rely on high dose 
corticosteroids (HDCS) and broad-spectrum immunosuppressive agents. First line standard therapies 
include CYC and HDCS for induction followed by AZA for maintenance or MMF  and HDCS for induction 
followed by MMF  for maintenance [Appel, 2009 14;  Dooley, 2011 15; Houssiau, 2002 16; Houssiau, 2010 17; 
Morris, 2013 18]. 
The overarching goal of a long-term LN  management strategy is to prevent chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
and ESRD by aggressively treating acute renal inflammation and minimizing  the risk of further renal 
flares.  
The objective of induction therapy in active LN  is to rapidly attenuate  immune complex mediated 
inflammation with  HDCS and to  interrupt the autoimmune pathways with  potent immunosuppressants to 
prevent reignition  of the  inflammatory cycle. The objective of less intensive but prolonged maintenance 
therapy is to  consolidate the achieved response into a clinical remission and to keep patients  relapse-free 
while minimizing  treatment toxicity [Parikh, 2016 19; Almaani, 201711].   
Despite the  aggressive nature of treatment, management of LN  remains unsatisfactory. More than  60% 
of patients fail to achieve remission and up to 25%  of patients  in remission experience relapse. 
Suboptimal disease control results in irreversible nephron loss and progression to ESRD within  10-15 
years of LN  diagnosis. In addition to the challenges presented by the  severity of the disease, cumulative 
exposure to potent non-selective immunosuppressants and corticosteroid burden are associated with 
significant side effects, long-term toxicities and organ damage accrual [Almaani, 20172; Menez, 20182].   
A recent meta-analysis of LN  outcomes in more than 18000  LN patients  over a 40  year period 
demonstrated that the rates of progression to ESRD and mortality have not changed appreciably in recent 
years [Tektonidou, 2016 20]. This pattern further underlines the limitation  of current LN  therapies and 
urgent need for new targeted treatments that  can optimize outcomes and improve long-term benefit by 
reducing kidney inflammation, decreasing LN  flares, and delaying progression to ESRD. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Belimumab is a recombinant human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody that binds and antagonizes the biological 
activity of soluble BLyS [also known as B-cell activating factor (BAFF)]  protein, a member of the tumour 
necrosis factor ligand superfamily that promotes the survival of B lymphocytes. Benlysta is approved for 
the treatment of patients  with active, autoantibody-positive SLE who are receiving standard therapy and 
has been on the market since 2011.  Benlysta has been studied in  5 efficacy and safety double-blind 
randomized controlled trials in adult patients  with SLE,  and a large double-blind  randomized controlled 
safety trial.  In the  clinical development programme as of 08 March 2019,  7232 subjects have received 
treatment with  belimumab (IV or SC), and the  post marketing exposure is over 83,500 subject-years. In

2019,  belimumab IV formulation was approved for the treatment of children 5 years and older with active 
autoantibody-positive SLE who are receiving standard therapy. 
The belimumab SLE studies excluded subjects with  severe active LN because those trials required 
subjects to be on stable background therapy and had main outcome measures for overall SLE disease 
activity; patients with  active nephritis receive more aggressive background therapy with renal specific 
assessments required for trial conduct.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
No central scientific advice has been sought from the CHMP.  The LN  study was an agreed post approval 
commitment with  both the  EMA and the FDA at the time of the initial  MA for Benlysta IV in 2011  and the 
protocol was submitted  to both  agencies. Study protocols amendments were assessed as part of 
variations IB/0030/G and II/0049. 
The original agreed study sample size and endpoints were amended after the  study initiation.  The key 
changes were communicated to  the agencies and are as follows: 
•  Sample size change from 464 subjects (1:1 Benlysta, placebo allocation) to at least 400 subjects 
due to difficulties enrolling. The final actual total enrolled was 448  subjects. 
• 
The original primary endpoint  definition was changed from an ordinal response rate (ORR) 
endpoint (complete, partial, no response) to a binary endpoint (responder, non-responder) 
referred to as PERR. The PERR endpoint is easier to interpret and is clinically relevant as a 
predictor of long-term renal outcomes. The more stringent  endpoint of CRR was included as the 
first major secondary endpoint in the statistical  testing  hierarchy. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP 
All studies were undertaken in accordance with standard operating procedures of the GSK Group of 
Companies, which  comply with  the principles of GCP. During the  conduct of BEL114054,  GCP non-
compliance was identified at 2 sites; efficacy data from these sites were excluded. All studies were 
conducted with  the approval of Ethics Committees or Institutional  Review Boards. Informed consent was 
obtained for all subjects, and the studies were performed in accordance with  the version of the 
Declaration of Helsinki that  applied at the time  the studies were conducted. Where required, regulatory 
approval was obtained from the relevant health  authority. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in  this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody and is consequently classified as a protein. According to the 
Guideline on the  Environmental Risk Assessment on Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  amino acids, peptides and proteins are exempted because they are unlikely 
to result in significant  risk to the environment. Consequently, no Environmental Risk Assessment for 
belimumab is required. The CHMP  considered this acceptable.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
Belimumab PK are consistent with  other mAbs targeting  soluble ligands. The PK are linear, dose-
proportional and time-independent  after both  IV and SC administration.  Belimumab is restricted to the 
plasma and interstitial  fluid of the more permeable tissues and has a small volume of distribution  (5.3 L), 
a clearance (CL) of 215  mL/day, and a 19.4-day terminal half-life [Struemper, 2013 21].  Belimumab is 
eliminated by cellular catabolism following non-specific uptake by pinocytosis. In SLE, the geometric 
mean of the population  PK predicted belimumab steady-state Cavg,ss was 100 µg/mL  at the

recommended IV dose of 10 mg/kg q4w and was 102 µg/mL  for the  recommended SC dose of SC 200  mg

Methods 
Bioanalytical  methods 
There have been no relevant changes to  the information presented in the initial  marketing authorisation 
dossier in the treatment  of adult  SLE for the  IV and SC formulations of belimumab. 
The immunogenicity methods have been used in previous submissions of Benlysta. 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The population analysis dataset contained data from 448  subjects, 224  randomized to placebo (59  who 
received cyclophosphamide, CYC, and 165 who received mycophenolate mofetil, MMF,  as the induction 
regimen) and 224  randomized to 10 mg/kg belimumab (60 who received CYC and 164 who received MMF 
as induction regimen). 
The population PK analysis dataset utilized 2156 observed belimumab concentrations from the 224 
subjects randomized to belimumab after excluding all pre-first dose records and all records reported as 
missing or below the  limit of quantification.  The median number of PK concentrations per subject was 10 
with  a minimum of 1  and a maximum of 12.  During the  model fitting  process, it  was necessary to exclude 
one PK concentration (57.4  μg/mL on day 728)  since this observation occurred approximately 2 years 
after the last reported belimumab dose and the concentration was not consistent with  the 19-day 
terminal half-life expected for belimumab.  
Of the 448 subjects in the overall population  PK analysis dataset (Table 1 and Table 2), the  majority of 
patients were female (88%) and approximately half the subjects were Asian. The continuous  and 
categorical covariate distributions  at baseline were similar for the belimumab and placebo treatment 
groups. The median proteinuria level at baseline in the  overall study population was 2.5 g/g.

The population PK model previously developed for an adult SLE population included several covariates on 
the clearance (CL) and central volume (V1) parameters. Significant covariates on CL included bodyweight, 
creatinine clearance, proteinuria as a categorical covariate (above or below 2 g/g), angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitor use, corticosteroid use, albumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. 
Significant covariates on V1 included body weight,  body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin level and white 
blood cell count.  The adult SLE model was used to evaluate the PK in the adult  LN study (BEL114054)

with  the population parameters fixed at their  adult SLE derived estimates. The results acted as a point  of 
reference to explore the similarities in PK between adult SLE and adult LN  patients and to assess how 
potential improvement in renal function  during the study impacts belimumab exposure. The adult SLE 
model was then  reduced to include only the covariates considered essential in characterizing the  PK of 
belimumab in an adult LN  population: body weight  to capture the allometric effects of body size on 
clearance and volume of distribution  as observed in the previous adult SLE study and proteinuria to 
capture the renal component of belimumab clearance. The PK model was updated to include fat-free mass 
instead of body weight  to describe the allometric effects of body size in adults with  LN,  and updated to 
capture the correlated and time-varying relationship between proteinuria, albumin and belimumab CL. 
Albumin levels were standardised relative to a theoretically derived value which would be observed in 
healthy subjects with no proteinuria (estimated to be 42 g/L).  
The following covariates were tested in the model development: Age, Sex, Induction regimen, Asian race, 
Black race, baseline BLyS, baseline eGFR, baseline SELENA-SELEDAI. The Likelihood ratio test,  5% 
significance level, was used for covariate testing. Subsequently, a covariate was considered 
pharmacokinetically relevant if either the R05 or R95 ratio was outside than 0.8 to  1.25 domain (the same 
thresholds used for bioequivalence studies) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) in the covariate 
parameter estimate was wholly positive or wholly negative. The R05 or R95 ratio were defined as the  ratio 
of the model parameter at the  5th and 95th  percentiles of the covariate within  the study population, 
relative to the  model parameter at the median covariate value. 
The population PK analysis was performed using software NONMEM  version 7.3,  PsN version 4.6.0  and R 
version 3.2.5. 
Final population  PK model  
The population PK model for adults with  LN was 2-compartment with  first order distribution  and 
elimination. The allometric effects of body size were best described by the fat-free mass. Albumin and 
proteinuria were also found to be significant  time-dependent covariates of the CL.  The final parameter 
estimates are presented in Table 3. Shrinkage in empirical Bayes estimates in CL, V1 and V2 were 4%, 
17%, and 22%,  respectively. Model evaluation as per goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks 
(VPC) are presented in Table 3. 
Age and Asian race were found to be statistically significant  covariates of CL according to  the likelihood 
ratio test at the  5% level of uncertainty. The CL in Asian patients  with LN  was predicted to  be 13.7% 
higher than for non-Asians. However, the covariate effect for age and Asian race was not  sufficiently large 
for the covariate to be considered pharmacokinetically relevant and so these covariates were not included 
in the final model.

The pharmacokinetic relevance of the covariate effects was assessed by comparing with a covariate effect 
of 0.8 to 1.25  on the pharmacokinetic parameter of interest  (Figure 3).  In the calculation of the baseline 
albumin effect on clearance, the proteinuria correction was partly accounted for by setting the  proteinuria 
to its  median baseline value. Thus, the effect of albumin on clearance may be over-estimated to some 
extent, since the true correlation between albumin and proteinuria was not  fully accounted in this 
calculation. Additional covariates of potential clinical relevance, including sex, induction  regimen (CYC or 
MMF),  black race, baseline BLyS levels, baseline estimated glomerular filtration  rate (eGFR) and baseline 
Safety of Estrogen in Lupus National  Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 
(SELENA-SLEDAI) score were not found to  be statistically  significant covariates of belimumab CL.

Figure 3 Covariate analysis of final model 
Pharmacokinetics in Target Population 
LN  is a renal manifestation of SLE,  with the  same underlying pharmacology and mode of action for 
belimumab. In subjects with  normal glomerular permeability, it is not  expected that belimumab 
(molecular weight  147 kDa) would  be cleared via the kidneys due to size restriction of glomerular 
filtration.  However, in patients  with LN,  inflammation of the glomeruli results in an increase in elimination 
of intermediate molecular weight proteins and high molecular weight  proteins including  mAbs and 
immunoglobulin G (IgG). This increased urinary excretion of proteins (proteinuria) is expected to 
correlate with  increased renal elimination of belimumab resulting in decreased systemic exposure to 
belimumab. This was noted in  the population PK analysis for IV SLE where a higher degree of proteinuria 
(≥2 g/g) resulted in a 14% increase in central clearance of belimumab. 
An important point  to consider in the interpretation  of the  population PK results from BEL114054  is that 
all subjects started induction therapy with standard medications within  60 days of the first belimumab 
dose. The induction  regimens result in proteinuria reduction within  the first 3 to 4 months  of treatment. 
During the first 8 to 12  weeks in both the belimumab and placebo groups, there was a rapid decline in 
urinary proteinuria, as measured by urine protein to creatinine ratio (Figure 4). 
There is an inverse correlation between proteinuria and belimumab Cavg with  high proteinuria associated 
with  low belimumab exposure. The correlation is apparent across the duration of the study but is 
strongest over the first 24  weeks where the highest  levels of proteinuria were observed (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Proteinuria Levels versus Belimumab Cavg by Time Period 
The population PK summary was derived from the final model parameters with  the covariates set to their 
reference or default value: a 60 kg subject with 38.4  kg fat-free mass, who  had no proteinuria and a 
normal albumin  level of 42  g/L, and who received 10 mg/kg belimumab infused over 1 hour. In this 
scenario, the belimumab clearance and volume of distribution  estimates were 175  mL/day and 4720  mL, 
with  corresponding distributional and terminal-phase half-lives of 1.53 days and 20.0  days. The area 
under the curve at steady state over a 28-day dosing period was 3436  μg.day/mL, which corresponds to 
an average concentration of 123 μg/mL.  The minimum  and maximum concentrations at steady state were 
67.7  μg/mL and 286 μg/mL. 
At the start  of treatment,  estimated belimumab CL was higher in adults with  LN (Table 4) compared to 
adults with  SLE which is most likely due to  the higher renal component in the CL of belimumab at the 
initiation  of treatment. Belimumab CL decreased during the first 24  weeks of the  study, and from Week 
24 onwards CL was similar to that  observed in the adult SLE population.  This is consistent with  the 
improvement in renal activity as shown by the decrease in proteinuria due to induction  therapy.

Table 4  Estimated Steady State Clearance of Belimumab in LN Subjects
The population PK model captured the time-dependent change on belimumab CL associated with 
reduction in proteinuria throughout  the study. Belimumab CL was higher at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 
compared to Week 24,  by approximately 46%, 35%,  24% and 15%, respectively (Table 4). The higher CL 
early in the study did not  translate into a similar percent reduction in belimumab concentrations due to 
the administration of a loading dose at Week 2  (Figure 5). Compared to Week 24,  observed pre-dose 
concentrations were 14% lower at Week 2,  23% higher at Week 4 and 32% lower at Week 8 (Table 5).

The population PK analysis for BEL114054  showed that the  induction regimen (CYC or MMF)  was not  a 
statistically significant  covariate of belimumab clearance. Since MMF  was previously shown not to  have a 
significant impact on belimumab PK, it can be assumed that CYC would also not have a significant effect 
on the PK. This is supported by the similarity in the geometric mean belimumab observed pre-dose 
concentration in the CYC and MMF  treated groups (Table 6).

Mean (CV%)
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
According to the  MAH, the  pharmacodynamic responses to belimumab in subjects with  LN  were consistent 
with  the known mechanism of action of belimumab and previous experience in patients with  SLE [Stohl, 
2012 22] with  the exception of IgG and IgG-based autoantibodies due to  urinary excretion of proteins 
(proteinuria). In contrast to belimumab-treated SLE patients (who experienced significant reductions in 
IgG), in LN patients,  serum IgG levels increased as a result of a rapid decline in  urinary excretion of 
proteins over the first 8 to 12  weeks (which was to a similar extent for belimumab and placebo). 
Consistent with  the known pharmacodynamic response of belimumab, smaller increases in serum IgG 
levels were observed in the belimumab group relative to placebo. At Week 104, the median percent 
increase from baseline in IgG was 17% for the belimumab and 37% for the  placebo group.  
A sensitivity analyses to control for changes in  urinary IgG loss were performed for anti-double  stranded 
DNA (anti-ds DNA) -and C1q antibodies. The results of these analyses demonstrated a notable reduction 
in anti-dsDNA and anti-C1q  antibodies levels relative to the overall level of IgG antibodies in serum for

subjects treated with  belimumab. Subjects randomized to placebo only showed a modest reduction in the 
levels of autoantibodies relative to the overall level of IgG antibodies. 
Increases in complement C3 and C4 in response to belimumab in LN patients  are consistent with 
observations made in belimumab-treated SLE patients [Stohl,  201222]. 
B cell responses to belimumab in LN  patients were consistent  with the  mechanism of action of 
belimumab. Naïve B cells and memory B cells responded similarly between LN and SLE subjects treated 
with  belimumab [Stohl,  201222].  
As for rare B cells subsets, these results should be interpreted with  caution due to the large between-
subject variability of B cell measurements, 
Baseline imbalances in absolute values for total CD19+ B cells and B cell subsets were observed in 
subjects stratified to the different induction/maintenance subgroups but also those randomized within  a 
subgroup; particularly noticeable in CYC/AZA-subgroup. Such baseline imbalances could affect 
interpretation of the degree of pharmacodynamic effects achieved by each treatment. The relatively lower 
total CD19+ B cells and subsets thereof observed in CYC-subgroup compared to the MMF-subgroup  is 
likely due to the different mode of action of the induction  therapies. It  is been reported that  CYC mainly 
reduces naïve and memory B cells, whilst  sparing transitional B cells and late-stage B cells such as 
plasmablasts and plasmacells. In contrast, MMF  primarily reduces late-stage B cells whilst  sparing early 
stage B cells such as naïve and transitional B cells [Dörner, 2009 23; Eickenberg, 2012 24; Fassbinder, 
2015 25].  
Despite the  different modes of action of the drugs used in the induction  and maintenance regimen, overall 
pharmacodynamic responses to belimumab in LN  patients in the  CYC-subgroup and the MMF-subgroup 
were consistent  with the  mechanism of action of belimumab. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
The objective of the exposure-response (E-R) analysis for BEL114054  was to evaluate whether the  lower 
exposure to belimumab early in  the study impacted the clinical response at Week 104 and whether these 
data suggest that  a dose adjustment is required in patients with  high  level proteinuria. 
E-R assessment for BEL114054  was limited  by 2 factors. Firstly, the  study was conducted at a single dose 
level. Secondly the E-R analysis is confounded by an association between belimumab exposure and 
proteinuria and between proteinuria and the efficacy endpoints primary efficacy renal response (PERR) 
and complete renal response (CRR) which  both have proteinuria levels as a component in the definition  of 
a responder. For PERR, a responder must achieve a urine protein to  creatine ration (uPCR) ≤0.7 g/g and 
for CRR, a responder must achieve a uPCR <0.5  g/g. 
Pharmacology Exposure Response 
There is a flat relationship between naïve B-cell response and belimumab Cavg at Weeks 24, 52  and 104 
in both  the ≤2.5 g/g and >2.5  g/g subgroups (Figure  6). This indicates that the  reduction in circulating 
naïve B-cell is saturated over the observed belimumab Cavg concentration range in both  the low and high 
proteinuria subgroup during  the first 24 weeks of treatment.

Figure 6 Naïve B Cell Response versus Average Concentration 
Efficacy exposure-response 
Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate  the Cavg in non-responder and responders for PERR and CRR, 
respectively.  
For the >2.5  g/g proteinuria subgroup median Cavg is lower than the ≤2.5 g/g subgroup. This is likely to 
be consequence of the higher overall renal disease activity in  the >2.5 g/g baseline proteinuria subgroup 
which results in higher belimumab renal clearance and hence lower belimumab Cavg.  
Within  the >2.5  g/g baseline proteinuria subgroup, the distribution  of Cavg values is similar for the non-
responders and responders for both Week 104  PERR and CRR. In the ≤2.5 g/g  subgroup, Cavg values 
appear to be slightly higher in the responders than non-responders for PERR and CRR at Week 104, but 
the differences were not  considered meaningful. Overall, this  indicates no association between response 
at Week 104  and belimumab Cavg values in the early weeks of the study.

To further elucidate if the  lower percentage of PERR and CRR responders in the  >2.5 g/g proteinuria 
subgroup was due to low  belimumab exposure at the start of treatment,  an assessment of belimumab 
Cavg Wk(0-12)  by tertiles and corresponding percentage of responders was evaluated. Cavg Wk(0-12) 
was selected as the belimumab exposure endpoint as this represented the time  period with  lowest 
exposure to belimumab due to high  proteinuria and switching  from q2w to the q4w  dosing regimen after 
Week 4. 
In order to investigate if the lower percentage of responders in the  >2.5 g/g baseline proteinuria 
subgroup was due to low  belimumab exposure at the start of treatment,  Cavg Wk(0-12) values were 
divided into tertiles and the percentage of responders within each tertile was determined for both PERR 
and CRR at Week 104, Table 7 and Table 8, respectively. 
In the >2.5  g/g subgroup, there was no consistent trend in percentage of PERR or CRR responders across 
the tertiles, indicating  no evidence that the lower response rates in  this subgroup are related to  lower 
belimumab exposure (Table 7). 
For the ≤2.5  g/g baseline proteinuria PERR, there is some evidence of a higher percentage of PERR 
responders in the 2nd and 3rd tertiles compared to  the 1st tertile, although percentage of PERR responders 
was similar in  the 2nd and 3rd tertiles. For CRR the percentage of responders increased with increasing 
exposure tertiles (Table 8).

Table 8  Percentage of PERR and CRR Responders at Week 104 by Tertiles of Belimumab Cavg Wk(0-12) 
for Subjects with  Less than  or Equal to  2.5 g/g uPCR at Baseline
For increasing tertiles of Cavg Wk(0-12),  there is no consistent trend for an increase in PERR or CRR 
(Figure 9) response rates. For both PERR and CRR, within  each belimumab Cavg Wk(0-12)  tertile, the 
≤2.5  g/g baseline proteinuria subgroup has approximately 20% higher response rate than  the >2.5 g/g 
baseline proteinuria subgroup, despite having similar Cavg Wk(0-12)  values.

Safety  exposure-response 
For safety E-R, Cavg Wk(0-4) was selected as the exposure endpoint for the  serious adverse events 
(SAEs) through Week 24 as this represented the highest  exposure to belimumab early in the study due to 
the loading dose at  Week 2. Cavg Wk(0-24)  was selected as the  exposure endpoint for SAEs post Week 
24 as this is representative of overall systemic exposure to belimumab (Table 5). 
There is no evidence of belimumab E-R relationship for the rates of reported SAEs, including serious 
infections (Table 9). Higher event rates of SAEs and serious infections were observed in subjects in the 
lowest belimumab Cavg tertile. This is likely due to a higher systemic SLE and LN  activity with more 
significant levels of proteinuria, while receiving intensive immunosuppressive therapy and high doses of 
corticosteroids. 
The number of patients experiencing SAEs in each exposure tertile was small, therefore the results should 
be interpreted with  caution.

Simulations to inform dose selection 
Simulations of belimumab concentration-time profiles for IV and SC dosing regimens were conducted 
using the population  PK model fitted to the  BEL114054  LN dataset. For each scenario 1000 virtual 
patients were simulated. The model covariates (proteinuria, albumin and baseline fat-free mass) were 
sampled from the BEL114054  dataset by individual with  replacement, which  preserved the correlation 
between the covariates. The entire time-course profiles for proteinuria and albumin for a sampled patient 
was used as the input  to the PK model. Figures of simulated belimumab concentration-time profiles were 
summarized by the median, inter-quartile range (IQR) and 95% prediction intervals (PI). The simulations 
were summarized by the belimumab Cavg over 2 week time  periods for the  first 4 weeks and 4 week time 
periods, thereafter. 
IV  Simulations by Proteinuria Subgroup 
PK simulations were conducted firstly to identify what levels of baseline proteinuria may warrant a dose 
adjustment based on belimumab Cavg and secondly to evaluate a dosing regimen that  would provide 
belimumab Cavg values closest to the exposure observed in subjects with  low proteinuria.  
In order to identify what  levels of proteinuria may benefit from dose adjustment to  match PK, the 
belimumab treated population  in BEL114054  was divided into subgroups of approximate quartiles of the 
baseline proteinuria (uPCR) levels: <1 g/g, 1 to  2.5 g/g, 2.5  to 4.5 g/g and >4.5  g/g. 
Predicted belimumab concentration time profiles for the IV dosing regimen used in BEL114054  of 10 
mg/kg q2w to week 4  and q4w  thereafter, were simulated for each baseline proteinuria subgroup. The 
<1 g/g subgroup, which  is representative of the SLE patient  population, was treated as the reference 
group. For the <1 g/g subgroup, the median Cavg over the first  12 weeks (107 µg/mL)  and the first 24 
weeks (105  µg/mL) of treatment were similar to  belimumab Cavg,ss values in  subjects with  SLE 
(population median = 110 µg/mL  and geometric mean =100 µg/mL).  For  the baseline proteinuria 
subgroups above 1 g/g, Cavg tended to be lowest during weeks 4-8,  8-12 and 12-16,  compared to weeks 
0-4 and weeks 16  onwards (Figure 10).  The belimumab Cavg for the 1 to 2.5  g/g and 2.5 to 4.5  g/g was 
within  30% of the <1  g/g subgroup. For the >4.5 g/g subgroup, the Cavg was within  40%  of the <1 g/g 
subgroup.

and compared to Cavg for <1 g/g subgroup with  the standard q2w to week 4 regimen. Durations of 
loading doses to weeks 8,  12 and 16 were simulated each followed by q4w thereafter (Figure 11).

Dosing 
The simulations showed that in subjects with  baseline proteinuria values >4.5  g/g IV dosing of 10 mg/kg 
q2w up to  week 12 with  10 mg/kg q4w thereafter, provided the closest match  to the predicted 
belimumab Cavg values in the <1  g/g subgroup following  IV 10 mg/kg q2w up to  week 2 with  10 mg/kg 
q4w thereafter.  
SC Simulations by Proteinuria Subgroup 
The results from the pivotal SC Phase III efficacy study in adults with  SLE (BEL112341)  showed that 200 
mg q1w results in a similar pharmacological and efficacy response as the IV dose regimen of 10  mg/kg 
q4w. Population PK modelling and simulations showed that  for SC 200  mg q1w  the belimumab Cavg,ss of 
100 µg/mL  was similar to the IV 10  mg/kg q4w  Cavg,ss of 110  µg/mL  (Figure 12).

then IV 10 mg/kg  q4w vs SC 200mg q1w  in Subjects with  SLE 
The population PK model developed for the adult  LN population  was extended to include SC dosing by 
incorporating the absorption component of the population  PK model developed from the adult SLE 
analysis (lag time of 0.179  days and absorption rate constant of 0.235  h-1 which corresponds to a half-
life of 2.9 days) [Struemper, 2018 26]. It was assumed that  bioavailability for SC administration of 
belimumab in LN population  was similar to that  observed in SLE (74.2%).   
Simulations were conducted to evaluate the predicted impact of proteinuria on Cavg following SC 
administration and alternative SC regimens to  achieve similar Cavg in subjects with  <1 g/g. In doing so, 
the weekly regimen was maintained but  the SC dose was doubled i.e., for <4.5 g/g  loading doses of 400 
mg q1w up to  Week 4 followed by 200 mg q1w  thereafter and for >4.5  g/g baseline proteinuria 
subgroup, loading doses of 400 mg q1w up to  Week 12 followed by 200  mg q1w thereafter. These 
simulations showed that  SC 400 mg loading doses provided belimumab Cavg values were comparable to 
the corresponding IV loading doses to Week 4 in all proteinuria subgroups (Figure  13 and Table 10)  and 
to Week 12  for the ≥4.5  g/g baseline proteinuria subgroup (Table 11).

(>4.5  g/g Baseline Proteinuria Subgroup) 
Simulations showed that belimumab Cavg values for SC loading doses of 400  mg q1w  were similar to IV 
loading dose of 10 mg /kg q2w and that  belimumab Cavg was also similar for the subsequent standard 
dosing of IV 10 mg/kg q4w and SC 200 mg q1w. 
SC simulations for the full LN population 
The current approved SC regimen of 200 mg q1w does not achieve belimumab steady-state 
concentrations until  approximately week 12 and the exposure to belimumab is lower than the IV dosing 
regimen during the  first 8 weeks of dosing (Figure 14). The phase 3 study in  subjects with  SLE 
(BEL112341)  showed that  the efficacy response following SC dosing is similar to  that for IV, and so the 
absence of a SC loading regimen was not detrimental to treatment  outcome. PK simulations have been 
used to show how introducing a SC loading regimen to all patients, irrespective of proteinuria levels, 
raises belimumab exposure over the first  12 to 24 weeks of treatment in  line with  exposures following IV 
dosing. These loading doses provide similar belimumab exposures to those achieved with  the IV dosing 
regimen of 10 mg/kg q2w to  week 4, followed by 10 mg/kg q4w  thereafter. The predicted belimumab 
concentration-time profiles for all proteinuria subgroups for the proposed IV and SC dose regimens are 
provided in Figure 15  and predicted belimumab Cavg values for the both regimens along with  the 
standard SC 200  mg q1w dosing are provided in Table 12.

Thereafter Compared to 200 mg q1w  (All Proteinuria Subgroups Combined) 
The SC dosing regimen has higher predicted belimumab Cmin and lower belimumab Cmax and similar 
belimumab Cavg values compared to the IV dosing regimen. This suggests that SC dosing regimen should 
provide similar efficacy and safety to that observed with  IV. 
Switching from IV  to SC 
For the 10  mg/kg IV dose with  loading to week 4 (that  is, an extra IV dose administered at week 2 as for 
SLE), the switch  to SC can be made at  week 3 (Figure 16) or at week 4  (Figure 17). Providing the first 
two IV doses are administered on days 0 and 14, it  is considered acceptable making the switch  to SC 1 to 
2 weeks after the last IV dose. The same recommendation will equally apply at later times as proteinuria 
levels are expected to  be lower and exposures closer to steady state when the switch  to SC dosing is 
made.

Switching  to SC 1 or 2 weeks after the 2nd IV dose resulted in belimumab Cavg values similar to those 
that  achieved with IV 10 mg/kg q4w from week 4 onwards (Table 13). Therefore, if a patent with  LN 
switches from IV to SC they can have the  1st SC dose between 1 and 2 weeks after the last IV dose.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
In order to support dosing recommendations in LN  population, the MAH  performed population PK analysis 
from 448  randomized to placebo (n=224)  or belimumab (n=224)  in the double-blind phase of study 
BEL114054  and E-R analysis for study  BEL114054. 
The bioassays used in this  application have been previously submitted.  The same cut-point  used in the 
bioassay for anti-belimumab antibodies in the  SLE population was used in the  LN population.  This is 
considered a conservative approach since the false positive ADA rate was somewhat higher in the LN 
population and thus  accepted by the  CHMP. The pharmacokinetics of belimumab in the  LN patient 
population was characterised by population  PK modelling. A 2-compartment with  first order distribution 
and elimination was identified, consistent with  the previous PK analysis in adults with  SLE. The allometric 
effects of body size were best described by the fat-free mass. Albumin and proteinuria were also found to 
be significant time-dependent covariates of the  CL. Thirteen percent of the PK data collected were 
excluded from the PK model development, of which 12%  were below limit of quantification.  Although 
excluding BLQ data could have an impact on the estimated CL/F  value, the CHMP  considers that  the data 
exclusion was not expected to  impact the dose selection. Overall, the CHMP  considers that the  final model 
appropriately describes the PK data in  the LN population.   
At the start  of randomized treatment  in adults with  LN in  Study BEL114054,  estimated belimumab CL 
(~334  mL/day) was higher than for adults with  SLE (232  mL/day) due to renal disease. Belimumab CL 
decreased during the  first 24 weeks of the study, and from Week 24 onwards, was similar to that 
observed in the adult SLE population.  The average difference in CL at week 2 and week 24  was 46%.  The 
time-varying CL is largely attributed  to the  reduction in  proteinuria over time (decreased proteinuria leads 
to increased exposure). The effect of body size on belimumab PK was best described by fat-free mass. 
Section 5.2 of the SmPC is updated with  results on population PK analysis in LN patients. 
According to the  population PK analysis, as well as observed belimumab concentrations, no influence of 
concomitant use of cyclophosphamide on belimumab PK was observed. Section 4.4  of the SmPC is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/548269/2020

updated to remove the statement on the absence of studies on Benlysta use in combination with 
cyclophosphamide and to remove caution to  be exercised if Benlysta is co-administered with  Benlysta.  
Exposure-response 
There was no trend with  increasing B cell response with  increasing belimumab concentration, for either 
high or low proteinuria subgroups.  
The graphical analysis on exposure versus responder/non-responder, stratified on proteinuria, suggests a 
minor difference in exposure between responders and non-responders. Nonetheless, there is a consistent 
higher response rate in the  low proteinuria group. Graphical analysis did not provide evidence to suggest 
that  an increase in belimumab systemic exposure via dosage adjustment would improve clinical efficacy 
response in subjects with high  baseline proteinuria. However, the efficacy E-R evaluation was limited by 
the fact that  only 1 dose level was studied, and that proteinuria was a confounding factor affecting both 
belimumab exposure and efficacy outcomes. Thus,  E-R modelling on the  data from study BEL114054  are 
not considered meaningful as it is not possible to discriminate between the influence of exposure and 
proteinuria due to  the high correlation between the two  factors and that  proteinuria is not independent of 
the response variable. 
The number of patients with  SAEs in each exposure tertile was small and thus  the results were 
interpreted with  caution. Nonetheless, no apparent trend with  increasing SAEs with increasing exposure 
was detected. A higher incidence of SAEs in the low exposure group, could potentially  be correlated to a 
highly active disease (i.e. high  proteinuria) in this group. 
Simulations to support dose selection 
Since the  interpretation of the exposure-response results are limited by confounding factors (correlation 
between proteinuria and exposure), there is no evidence confirming that  an increase in exposure (via 
dose adjustment  to match PK in  patients with  low proteinuria) for LN  patients with  high proteinuria at 
baseline would improve efficacy outcome. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that  the proposed IV dosing 
regimen for LN is the  same as SLE for all proteinuria subgroups i.e., 10 mg/kg q2w to  week 4 then 10 
mg/kg q4w.  
PK simulations for the SC dosing were provided for the LN  population PK model by incorporating the 
absorption parameters from the SLE SC population PK model. The assumption that the  SC absorption is 
similar between the  two patient  populations is endorsed by the CHMP.  According to the  simulation results, 
the best match between IV and SC exposure was achieved when a SC loading dose of 400  mg was 
administered q1w,  week 1-4,  followed by 200 mg q1w.  Population PK modelling and simulation results 
supporting the dose selection have been appropriately included in Section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Simulations to support a recommendation for transitioning between IV and SC administration were 
presented. The simulations indicate that  the preferred timeframe for a switch  to SC dosing would be 1-2 
weeks after the last IV dose to maintain steady-state concentration levels. This is endorsed by the  CHMP.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of belimumab in the LN  population is well described and the simulations to support dose selection 
are adequate. The following  dosing recommendations are agreed by CHMP: 
- IV dosing: 10  mg/kg q2w  to week 4 then  10 mg/kg q4w.  
- SC dosing: loading dose of 400  mg administered q1w,  week 1-4, followed by 200 mg q1w 
- transition  from IV to  SC administration:  the first dose of 200 mg subcutaneous injection should be 
administered 1  to 2 weeks after the last IV dose. This transition should occur any time after the patient

The following factors were used to  define active renal disease at screening: 
Urinary protein: creatinine ratio of ≥1.0 AND  
•  Active urinary sediment as defined by at least 1 of the following (in  absence of menses and 
genitourinary tract  infection).  
o  5 red blood cell (RBC)/high power field (hpf)  or above the laboratory reference range 
o  5 white  blood cell (WBC)/hpf or above the laboratory reference range. 
o  Presence of cellular casts (RBC or WBC). 
•  Subjects without  active urinary sediment were eligible if they met at least 1 of the following 
criteria:  
o  A confirmatory biopsy performed within  3 months prior to the screening visit or during the 
screening period meeting the biopsy criteria outlined above. 
o  Proteinuria ≥3.5  grams/day (or urinary protein:creatinine ratio≥3.5). 
Key exclusion criteria included subjects who  previously failed both CYC and MMF  (or other forms of 
mycophenolate) induction  therapies based on the  investigator’s opinion. Other key exclusion criteria 
included: severe active central nervous system (CNS) lupus; a history of malignant neoplasm within  the 
last 5 years, except for adequately treated cancers of the skin (basal or squamous cell) or carcinoma in 
situ of the uterine cervix; required management of acute or chronic infections within  60 days of Day 1; 
receipt of specific treatments/therapy (e.g., B cell targeted therapy, any biologic agent other than  B cell 
targeted therapy, plasmapheresis, non-biologic investigational agent, a live vaccine) within  protocol-
defined timeframes prior to Day 1;  subjects who had been on dialysis within  364 days of baseline (Day 
1), and subjects who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30mL/min/1.73m2  at the screening 
visit. 
Treatments 
The double-blind treatment groups included one active treatment arm of 10 mg/kg belimumab and a 
placebo arm, with  all treatment  groups receiving standard of care therapy. 
Subjects was dosed with study agent on Days 0 (baseline), 14, 28  and then  every 28 days thereafter 
through 100  weeks with  a final evaluation for the  double-blind treatment period at  104 weeks. All 
subjects received background therapy consisting of one of the following standard of care regimens: 
•  High  Dose Corticosteroids (HDCS) + Cyclophosphamide (CYC) for induction  therapy followed by 
Azathioprine (AZA)for maintenance therapy 
OR 
•  HDCS+ Mycophenolate Mofetil  (MMF)  for induction  therapy followed by MMF  for maintenance 
therapy 
The study recommended corticosteroid regimen included 0-3 IV pulses of methylprednisolone 500mg-
1000mg/pulse followed by oral prednisone at a recommended dose of 0.5-1.0  mg/kg/day with  total daily 
dose up to  60 mg/day. Adjustments could be made for tolerability issues. It was recommended that  oral 
corticosteroids should be tapered according to Table 14.  If necessary, it could take longer than 12  weeks 
to complete the taper. By Week 24,  the dose of corticosteroids should be at 10 mg of prednisone/day or 
less (can be 0 mg) or subject was considered a treatment failure.

The randomization of all eligible subjects was stratified by their induction/maintenance regimen (HDCS 
plus CYC followed by AZA vs HDCS plus MMF  followed by MMF)  and race (black race vs other).

Immunosuppressives 
Other immunosuppressives (eg, methotrexate [MTX]) were allowed provided these were started prior to 
baseline and met eligibility criteria. Dose alterations during the trial of these agents were permitted. 
Subjects who newly initiated  immunosuppressives (with the  exception of topical agents) after the 
baseline visit outside the  induction regimen was considered treatment failures. 
Angiotensin Pathway  Antihypertensives 
Starting a new angiotensin pathway antihypertensive (ACE inhibitor, angiotensin  receptor blocker) 
treatment after the Week 24 visit  would cause the subject to be declared a treatment failure. Dose 
titration  was allowed.  
Antimalarials 
A subject starting  antimalarial treatment after the  Week 24 visit was declared a treatment  failure. 
Objectives 
The objectives of this  study were to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of belimumab with 
standard of care versus placebo plus standard of care in adult  subjects with  lupus nephritis  Class III, IV, 
and/or V using the  2003 ISN/RPS criteria.

PERR at Week 52 was defined in the same manner as PERR 
at Week 104 only using a response at the Week 48 visit that 
was confirmed by a repeat measurement at the Week 52 visit 
to derive the endpoint. 
Defined as first of the following: 
i) Death   
ii) end stage renal disease (ESRD),  
iii) doubling of serum creatinine,  
iv) renal worseningc as evidenced by increased proteinuria 
and/or impaired renal function, or 
v) renal disease-related treatment failure. 
Defined as: 
- CRR (see definition above) 
- Partial Renal Response (PRR): eGFR no more than 10% 
below the baseline value or within normal range and ≥50% 
decrease in the uPCR with one of the following: 
a uPCR of <1.0, if the baseline ratio was ≤3.0 
OR  
a uPCR of <3.0, if the baseline ratio was >3.0 
AND 
- Not a treatment failure 
- No Renal Response (NRR): Not meeting criteria for either 
CRR or PRR. 
Note: If the endpoint specific concurrent medication guidelines described in the protocol were not followed, the 
subject was to discontinue IP and considered a treatment failure (non-responder) for the respective analysis.

Endpoint 
a.  Treatment failure: Subject who took a protocol-prohibited or restricted medication or dose (see Section 5.5 
Definition 
b. 
and Section 5.6 of the protocol with further detail in RAP Section 14.6.3.4). 
In the protocol, RAP and outputs this endpoint is “Time to death or renal-related event”. In this report this is 
referred to as “Time to renal-related event or death” as putting death first is misleading as these were 
primarily renal-related events. 
c.  Renal worsening is the development of increased proteinuria and/or impaired renal function defined as: 
Increased Proteinuria (using spot urine); A reproducible increase in 24-hour urine protein levels (as 
measured in uPCR) to:>1 g if the baseline value was <0.2 g OR >2 g if the baseline value was between 
0.2 g and 1 g OR More than twice the value at baseline if the baseline value was >1 g. 
Safety Endpoints:  Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events of special 
interest (AESI), Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C- SSRS), clinical laboratory parameters, 
immunogenicity, and vital signs. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Endpoint: serum belimumab concentrations. 
Sample size 
The original sample size calculations for ORR resulted in a target sample size of N=464  subjects (232  per 
arm) in order to achieve at least 85% power to detect a treatment difference for the  initial primary 
endpoint. Recruitment was completed with a final sample size N=448;  the primary endpoint  was revised 
to PERR and power was estimated at 80% for response rates of 40% and 53.6%. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to study treatment  in accordance with the randomization schedule. On Day 1, 
subjects were assigned to  IP by Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). Subjects were randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio to treatment with  either 10 mg/kg belimumab plus standard of care or placebo plus standard 
of care. Randomization of all eligible subjects was stratified by their induction  regimen (HDCS plus CYC vs 
HDCS plus MMF)  and race (black race vs other). There was race stratification  in this study because race 
may be an important factor related to outcomes in patients with  lupus nephritis.  Race was to be self-
designated. 
Blinding (masking) 
Belimumab and placebo were supplied as open-label vials; 3rd party unblinding was employed. The 
investigational product (IP) was reconstituted  and diluted by the unblinded site pharmacist or qualified 
designee, independent of the study (person responsible for receiving and dispensing IP). Except for a 
limited number of safety oversight personnel, all study site personnel, the subject, the sponsor, and the 
CROs were blinded to the IP received and to the results of certain biomarker and pharmacodynamic 
laboratory results. Separate monitors were responsible for the  clinical (blinded monitor) and IP (unblinded 
monitor) aspects of the study.  Treatment codes could be unblinded by the investigator or treating 
physician only in the  case of a medical emergency or in the event of a serious medical condition, when 
knowledge of the study drug was essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject. The GSK 
Central Safety Department (CSD, formerly Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance [GCSP]) staff 
could unblind treatment  codes in the event of a serious adverse event (SAE).

Statistical methods 
All statistical models for the  primary and major secondary endpoints controlled for induction  regimen, 
race, baseline uPCR, and baseline eGFR. Subjects who  met treatment failure (TF)  criteria were to 
continue in the  study. For the primary efficacy endpoint and major secondary efficacy endpoints (other 
than time  to renal-related event or death), subjects who discontinued IP or from the study were imputed 
as non-responders from the visit after the first missed IP dose. For the  time to renal-related event or 
death endpoint, the  data was censored from the first missed IP dose. 
No interim analyses were planned or performed for this study.  The two  database locks for this study 
correspond to the primary analysis (end of double-blind period, this report) and the open-label extension 
analysis (end of study analysis). All subjects and study  site personnel (except the unblinded  site 
pharmacist) were to remain blinded until the  open-label extension data was locked. 
Analysis populations 
Modified Intent-To-Treat (MITT):  All randomised participants  who received at least one dose of study 
treatment. This population  will be based on the treatment to  which the subject was randomised. Excludes 
the one subject at site 107299  due to  GCP non-compliance issues and the one subject at site 107398  due 
to insufficient  source documentation. 
Per-Protocol (PP): A subset of the MITT population who  comply with  the protocol. Protocol deviations that 
would exclude participants from the PP population are defined in RAP. The PP set will  only be analysed if 
this population  excludes more than 15%  of the  MITT population. 
Completers on Study agent: Subjects in the MITT population who completed through Week 104  and were 
not permanently discontinued from treatment  prior to Week 104. 
Completers on Study: Subjects in the MITT population who completed through Week 104  including 
subjects both on and off treatment. 
Analysis of primary endpoint 
PERR at  Week 104 was measured as a dichotomous response (Responder vs Non-Responder). PERR was 
determined by reproducible changes in  proteinuria and renal function. The PERR at Week 104 was defined 
by a response at the  Week 100 visit that  was confirmed by a repeat measurement at the Week 104  visit. 
PERR (Responder vs. Non-Responder) at  Week 104 was compared between belimumab and placebo using 
logistic regression controlling for induction regimen (CYC vs. MMF),  race (Black vs. Non-Black), baseline 
uPCR, and baseline eGFR. 
For the primary efficacy analysis several sensitivity/supplementary analyses were performed including a 
treatment policy analysis, an unadjusted analysis and a completer analysis. In addition, tipping  point 
analyses were performed on the treatment policy and hybrid non-TF  Estimands. 
Two treatment policy analyses were performed. One analysis, referred to as the Treatment Policy 
analysis, ignores intercurrent events of IP discontinuation  and treatment failure such that  all data 
observed after these events will  be used in the analysis. Additionally, a hybrid treatment policy analysis 
implements the composite strategy for treatment failure since it  is a component of the primary endpoint, 
and a treatment policy strategy for intercurrent events of IP discontinuation.  In this hybrid treatment 
policy analysis, treatment failures are treated as non-responders from the date of treatment failure 
onward and IP discontinuations  are ignored such that  all observed data after IP discontinuation  is used in 
the analysis. Missing  data due to study withdrawal, loss to follow-up, or death were treated as non-
responders from the date of the intercurrent event onward. 
Tipping point  analyses were performed for the primary endpoint (PERR) and the complete renal response 
(CRR) endpoint. The tipping point  analysis were based on the modified Intent-to-treat  population  using 
both the  hybrid treatment policy and treatment policy intercurrent event strategies.

Analysis of secondary endpoints 
Major secondary efficacy endpoints were Complete Renal Response at Week 104, Primary Efficacy Renal 
Response (PERR) at Week 52, Time to Renal-related Event or Death, and Ordinal Renal Response at Week 
104.  CRR at Week 104  and PERR at Week 52  were analysed using logistic regression as described for the 
primary analysis. Time to renal-related event or death was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards and 
ORR was analysed with  a rank ANCOVA. All four statistical models controlled for induction  regimen, race, 
baseline uPCR, and baseline eGFR. 
Control of type I error 
The primary and the 4 major secondary efficacy endpoints were evaluated based on a pre-specified step-
down sequential testing  procedure to control the  overall type 1 error rate. With  this procedure, the 
primary and 4 major secondary endpoints were evaluated for statistical significance, as follows: 
• 
PERR at  Week 104 
•  CRR at  Week 104 
• 
• 
PERR at  Week 52 
Time to Renal Related Event or Death 
•  ORR at  Week 104. 
Analyses of other efficacy endpoints were not subject to any multiplicity  adjustment.

Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled on 12 July 2012, and the last  visit in the double-blind phase occurred on 25 
July 2019.  The open label extension portion of the study was ongoing at the time of variation submission. 
Final report was submitted during the  procedure.  
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
There were 6 global amendments and 6 local (country specific) amendments to  the original protocol 
(dated 19 Oct 2011).  Global Protocol Amendment 07 was used to prepare this  CSR. A brief summary of 
the most important protocol amendments is provided below. 
Amendment 01 
The protocol was modified to clarify exclusion criteria, concurrent medications and standard of care, 
addition of anti-malarials, and use of corticosteroids.  
There were also changes to  prohibited medications and non-drug therapies, live vaccines, screening 
procedures, and the double-blind treatment period and study calendar. An open-label extension replaced 
the continuation  phase. An exploratory analysis of urinary biomarkers related to lupus nephritis was 
added. Clarifications were made to the withdrawal  of study treatment  and adverse event reporting 
sections. The endpoints and statistical  analysis sections were updated to  reflect changes made in other 
sections of the  protocol. 
Amendment 02 
Language describing subject unblinding  in the protocol was amended. Language regarding the body 
weight  used for dose calculation was corrected.   
Amendment 03 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/548269/2020 
Page 45/96 
 
 
  
  
 
The protocol was modified to expand Hepatitis  B serology testing, and to exclude patients who  tested 
positive according to the criteria specified, and to specify hepatitis  C screening test by HCV RNA-PCR 
assay with  additional wording to further clarify subject eligibility.  
The Screening window was extended from 28 days to 35  days and the Induction initiation  window  has 
been extended from 14  days to 21 days to  improve the feasibility of subject identification.   
The exclusion criteria were modified to  exclude subjects treated with  interleukin-6 targeted therapy within 
364 days of baseline, to clarify that  Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities include serum IgG level, and 
“Hyperuricemia or blood urea nitrogen (BUN) elevation due to  lupus nephritis or SLE” was added to the 
list of Grade 3 or greater laboratory abnormalities allowed. 
In addition, clarification was added for screening for active or latent  infections. The concurrent medication 
section was modified. Steroid rescue for non-renal SLE disease activity and non-SLE disease activity was 
revised. Measurement of vital signs and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) were added. Timing of 
pharmacokinetic sampling in subjects who withdrew from the study was clarified. A new section was 
added to  clarify management of patients with  liver chemistry events during the  study. Reason for 
treatment withdrawal  was modified to include “Missing  3 or more consecutive doses of study drug”. 
Subject unblinding information was updated.  
Amendment 05  
The eligibility criteria were modified to  allow patients who initiated  an induction most recently and have 
continued, to  be considered for enrollment. The slight  expansion of the induction initiation window  up to 
60 days prior to Day 1 was unlikely to confound the primary efficacy evaluation because patients will  only 
have been on SoC induction  for a short period before enrolment and their disease is still highly active at 
baseline. Relevant sections were modified accordingly. 
Local Amendment 05  (France (1)) 
In addition to the  changes described above for Amendment 05 for all sites, at the request of the  French 
National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM),  the protocol was revised to include 
guidance for French investigators to evaluate suspected cases of PML  using brain imaging and polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) on cerebrospinal fluid for JC virus (JCV). 
Local Amendment 05  (France (2)) 
The Local Amendment 05 (2)  for France was implemented on 13 July 2016  and applied only in France. In 
addition to  the changes described above for Amendment 05 (1),  at the request of the ANSM, the protocol 
was modified to  comply with  the information updated in November 2015  in the Cellcept Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SPC) and package leaflet reflecting changes to pregnancy test and contraception 
requirements requirements for women of childbearing potential  receiving MMF  or Mycophenolate sodium. 
Amendment 06 (all countries and sites except for France).  
The Local Amendment 06 for France was implemented on 26 Apr 2017 and applied only in France. It 
contains the same global protocol changes described here in  a separate protocol amendment created for 
specifically for use in France. 
The Renal Response definition used for key efficacy endpoints evaluation was modified to  remove the 
urinary sediment component. This change was driven by the latest  medical practice suggesting that 
urinary sediment level is not  an appropriate measure for disease change in  lupus nephritis as reported in 
the recent publications on the long-term predictors of renal outcomes in patients  with lupus  nephritis and 
the sponsor’s experience in urinalysis data collection in a multicenter trial setting.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/548269/2020 
Page 46/96 
 
 
  
  
Calculated GFR based on 24-hour urine collections used in the  Complete Renal Response definition  was 
changed to estimated GFR to minimize bias due to sample collection errors. Estimated  GFR will be used 
for all renal function evaluations including the primary and major secondary endpoints. 
Time to first renal flare was added as a major secondary efficacy endpoint to support the clinical 
interpretation of the primary endpoint and to  provide additional clinically meaningful evidence. It was 
placed third  in the testing  hierarchy after the primary endpoint  of renal response and the first major 
secondary endpoint of complete renal response at Week 104.  
In addition, clarification was added regarding timing  of the renal biopsy; other relevant sections/text have 
been modified accordingly. In the Study Design and Statistical  analysis sections, language was added 
allowing for a reduction in sample from the original N=464  due to recruitment difficulties and the timeline 
for fulfilling the PAC. The recruitment would  be curtailed by July 2018 if at least 400 subjects were 
randomized. There was a sample size sensitivity added to provide context to  power at various sample 
sizes. Contraception requirements were updated. The GFR calculation was corrected to  include “/1.73m2”. 
The Benefit-Risk section text was updated in line with  current belimumab safety information. The 
concomitant medications section was updated to  clarify concurrent medication rules applicable to the 
double-blind period. Laboratory text section was updated with the  most recent simplified Modification of 
Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] equation for estimation  of GFR. In the Statistical  analysis section, the Van 
Elteren test was replaced with  a Rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for the primary and major 
secondary endpoints analysis. Updates were also made to how missing values will  be handled, how  the 
sensitivity analyses will be performed, and additional  other efficacy endpoints were defined. The rate of 
renal flare from Week 24,  time to first renal flare from Week 52,  and the rate of renal flare from Week 52 
were also added as other efficacy endpoints and for some of the other efficacy endpoints, clarification text 
has been added. 
Amendment 07 (all countries and sites, except for France), 24 January 2019. 
The Local Amendment 07 for France was implemented on 18 Feb 2019  and applied only in France. The 
same global protocol changes described here were summarized in a separate protocol amendment and 
applied to sites in France. In this  amendment, the primary endpoint definition  was changed from an 
ordinal renal response endpoint (complete, partial, no response) to a binary endpoint (responder, non-
responder) referred to as PERR. The PERR endpoint is more easily interpretable, is clinically relevant, and 
has reasonable power to detect a treatment effect. The Time to renal flare at Week 24 endpoint  was 
changed to time to death or renal-related event (now referred to as renal-related event or death). The 
revised endpoint is more inclusive of events that  reflect worsening of renal disease and counting events 
from initiation  of randomized therapy onward. The testing  hierarchy was updated to  reflect the clinical 
relevance of the endpoints and statistical  power estimations.  The analysis methodology of the major 
secondary endpoints was changed to control for baseline proteinuria and estimated GFR as the endpoints 
are dependent on changes in these parameters. Power calculations were added to the sample size section 
to provide estimates for the PERR endpoint  given the randomized sample. In addition, the Study Design 
schematic was updated for the changes to  the primary and major secondary endpoints. A subgroup for 
baseline renal biopsy class was added. Other efficacy endpoints were updated to be consistent with  and 
supportive of the revised testing  hierarchy. Endpoints inadvertently omitted were added to other efficacy 
endpoints. The timeframe for pregnancy reporting was updated to sponsor requirements. 
Protocol deviations 
Important deviations included, but were not  limited to, those related to study inclusion or exclusion 
criteria, adherence to the protocol, conduct  of the  study, violation of GCP principles, subject management 
or subject assessment. The percentage of subjects with  important protocol deviations in the mITT 
population was similar between the  placebo and belimumab groups (51.6%  and 48.9%,  respectively, 
Table 18).  In both treatment groups, the largest proportion of important  protocol deviations was in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/548269/2020 
Page 47/96 
 
 
  
  
category of assessments and/or procedures. This broad category included deviations related to the 
informed consent process, failure to comply with  required safety assessments, missed assessments or 
procedures, and study treatment supply procedures. Most of the informed consent deviations were due to 
delay in timing  of re-consenting for ICF revisions and there were no specific patterns for the subcategory 
of other deviations. 
Table 18.  Subjects with  Important Protocol Deviations (Double-Blind, mITT Population) 
GCP noncompliance  
Due to  GCP noncompliance issues, subjects who  had at  least one assessment at site 107299  in the US 
and site 107398  in the Philippines were excluded from the mITT population; 2 subjects (1 at each site) 
were impacted and data from these 2 subjects were excluded from all efficacy analyses, but were 
included in the safety analyses.

Primary endpoint – PERR at week 104 
The PERR (Responder vs. Non-Responder) at Week 104  was compared between the belimumab and 
placebo groups using a logistic regression model controlling for induction regimen (CYC vs. MMF),  race 
(Black vs. Non-Black), baseline uPCR, and baseline eGFR. Baseline proteinuria, race, and treatment group 
were statistically  significant predictors of response in the model with  higher levels of proteinuria and black 
race predicted lower overall response rate.

Time to renal-related event or death 
Time to renal-related event or death is a composite endpoint defined as the  first event occurring after 
Day 1 among the following: 1) death,  2) ESRD, 3) doubling  of serum creatinine, 4)  renal worsening as 
evidenced by increased proteinuria and/or impaired renal function,  or 5)  renal disease-related treatment 
failure. Figure 20 shows the probability of experiencing a renal-related event over time or death. The risk 
of a renal-related event or death at any time up to  Week 104 was 49% less in the belimumab group than 
in the placebo group (HR=0.51;  95% CI: 0.34, 0.77;  p=0.0014).  The percentage of subjects with  a 
renal-related event or death was 15.7%  in the belimumab group and 28.3%  in the placebo group. Among 
those subjects who experienced a renal-related event or death, the median study day to event was 170 
for the belimumab group and 188 for the placebo group.

Efficacy results in the Class V subgroup were explored further. While no differences between treatment 
groups were observed for the percentage of PERR and CRR responders at Week 104, there was a higher 
percentage of PERR and CRR responders in the  belimumab group compared to placebo at earlier visits 
(Figure 22).  According to the applicant,  evidence of earlier proteinuria reduction in belimumab treated 
subjects with Class V LN,  and the numerically greater response with belimumab observed in the Class 
III+V/IV+V subgroup, which  would require improvement of Class V nephritis, may suggest potential 
efficacy of belimumab in Class V LN.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The approval of belimumab (Benlysta) for treatment of SLE was based on clinical trials in subjects with 
active SLE receiving standard therapy. Subjects with  severe active renal lupus were excluded from these 
trials. The indication initially sought  by the  MAH was as follows: treatment  of lupus nephritis in adult 
patients who are receiving standard therapy. 
BEL114054  was a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled, 104-week study 
to evaluate the  efficacy and safety of IV belimumab 10  mg/kg plus standard of care compared to placebo 
plus standard of care in adult subjects with  active LN  (histological classes III, IV, V or V in combination 
with  III or IV LN).  Eligible subjects were 18 years or older in age with  active, biopsy- proven proliferative 
lupus nephritis Class III or IV [excluding Class III(C), IV-S(C), and IV-G(C)], either with  or without  the 
presence of Class V, or pure Class V membranous disease using the 2003  ISN/RPS criteria. All patients 
had SLE according to the  ACR and SLICC (biopsy-proven LN in  combination with ANA or anti-dsDNA) 
classification criteria. This is in line with  EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for 
the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis (EMA/CHMP/51230/2013  corr 1, 
referred to as “EMA  Guideline” hereafter) and acceptable to  the CHMP. Active disease was defined as 
urinary protein:creatinine ratio of ≥1.0 and either active urinary sediment, confirmatory biopsy within  3 
months or proteinuria ≥3.5 grams/day. 
Patients were randomised to either 10 mg/kg belimumab or placebo for 104  weeks, both on top  on 
standard of care with high  dose corticosteroids and either: 
-Cyclophosphamide according to the  Euro-Lupus regimen (500  mg by IV infusion every 2 weeks for 6 
infusions), followed by azathioprine with  a target dose of 2 mg/kg/day 
- Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)  0.5 g twice  a day (bid) for the first week, increase to 1 g bid for the 
second week, and then  1.5 g bid for the third and subsequent weeks. 
Mycophenolate sodium could be used in lieu of MMF  for induction  and/or maintenance therapy 
(recommended dose from 720 mg/day to  2160 mg/day). 
The dosing regimen is in line with  the 2019 EULAR  recommendations for the management of systemic 
lupus erythematosus.

The randomization was stratified by their induction/maintenance regimen (HDCS plus CYC followed by 
AZA vs HDCS plus MMF  followed by MMF)  and race (black race vs other). According to  the EMA Guideline, 
“Patients should be stratified at randomisation by relevant baseline characteristics e.g. histological class 
of lupus nephritis, level of proteinuria, and/or creatinine clearance”. Furthermore, “care should therefore 
be taken that  both study arms include comparable numbers of patients of different ethnic  background”.  
Although it  would have been valuable to stratify also for the factors exemplified in the EMA Guideline, the 
currently used stratification  factors are considered relevant and acceptable to  the CHMP. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the PERR at Week 104 measured as a dichotomous response 
(Responder vs. Non-Responder). A responder is defined as uPCR ≤0.7  and eGFR is no more than 20% 
below pre-flare value or ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2  and-Not a Treatment Failure. The 4 major secondary 
efficacy endpoints were: CRR at Week 104,  PERR at Week 52,  Time to  Death or Renal-related Event, and 
ORR at  Week 104. According to  the EMA Guideline, “Studies conducted in patients with  lupus nephritis 
should be aimed for the control of renal activity. It is expected that  primary endpoints should be 
contextualised by reference to clinically meaningful values for major/complete response, such as 
normalisation/return to baseline of measured GFR or proteinuria of <0.5 g/24-h.  A partial response, i.e. 
not full  recovery but renal response able to maintain an eGFR within  pre-specified margins with  respect to 
baseline values, could only be accepted as primary endpoint if prospectively defined and relevance is well 
justified”. Thus, the  EMA recommended primary endpoint of complete renal  response differs from the 
primary efficacy renal response used in this study which  is a partial response. Therefore, CHMP 
assessment was much focused on the secondary endpoint of CRR. 
The EMA Guideline also recommends to assess prevention of long-term damage. Although  this is highly 
clinically relevant, the study duration is too short to allow safe conclusions on such an outcome. However, 
this issue was not further pursued by the CHMP  since prevention of long-term damage is partly covered 
by the CRR which  has been associated with  favourable long-term renal prognosis in the context of RCTs 
and long-term observational studies (Kostopoulou, Curr Rheum Rep 2020  22:30 27).. 
There were many important protocol amendments throughout the  study, including several changes to the 
primary endpoint:  
• 
• 
The first subject was included in  the study on 12 Jul 2012, and the  last visit in the double-blind 
phase occurred on 25  July 2019.   
In Protocol Amendment 6 (dated 25 Apr 2017) the primary endpoint of ORR was updated to 
remove the urinary sediment component and use estimated GFR for evaluation of kidney function. 
According to the  MAH, this  change to  modified ORR was driven by the latest  medical practice 
suggesting that  urinary sediment level was not an appropriate measure for disease change in 
lupus nephritis as reported in the  recent publications on the long-term predictors of renal 
outcomes in patients with LN and the  sponsor’s experience in urinalysis data collection in a 
multicenter trial setting.  Calculated GFR based on 24-hour urine collections used in the  CRR 
definition was changed to estimated GFR to minimize bias due to sample collection errors. From a 
clinical point of view, the rationale for these changes is agreed by the CHMP. 
Concurrently, the  primary analysis method was updated from a Van Elteren test  to a rank 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Use of a Rank ANCOVA allowed the analysis to  adjust for the 
continuous covariates of baseline uPCR, and baseline eGFR as well as the stratification factors of 
induction  regimen (CYC vs MMF),  and race (Black vs Non-  black). The inclusion of additional 
baseline covariates had the potential to  increase power. The change of analysis method is agreed 
by CHMP since it allows the use of covariates in line with the EMA  guideline on Adjustment  for 
27Kostopoulou, Myrto, Christina Adamichou, and George Bertsias. "An Update on the Diagnosis and Management of Lupus 
Nephritis." Current Rheumatology Reports 22 (2020): 1-12.

baseline covariates in clinical trials (EMA/CHMP/295050/2013)  and was performed before 
unblinding  of any data. 
The original study primary endpoint of ORR including urinary sediment and calculated GFR at 
Week 104  (IPD/TF/WD=NR; Van Elteren test)  was included as a pre-planned sensitivity analysis. 
The results favoured belimumab but were  not statistically significant. Thus, this change 
impacted the outcome of the  study, in favour of the sponsor. 
• 
In Protocol Amendment 7 (dated 24 Jan 2019) the  primary endpoint was updated from the 
modified ORR to the PERR. The ORR had 3 levels (complete, partial or no response) however the 
PERR had 2 levels (response, or no response) similar to the major secondary endpoint of CRR 
which was analyzed by logistic regression. Therefore, the analysis method selected for the PERR 
was also a logistic regression. The previous primary endpoint of modified ORR analyzed using a 
Rank ANCOVA was retained as a key secondary endpoint in the prespecified hierarchy. Modified 
ORR demonstrated statistical  significance in favour of the belimumab group compared with 
placebo (p=0.0096).  Although the rationale behind this change is not completely understood, 
CHMP  concluded that  this change did not affect the results in favour of the sponsor.  
The CHMP raised concerns about the impact of the changes to the  primary endpoint on the reliability of 
the study results. Upon CHMP’  request, the MAH clarified that these changes were made prior to 
unblinding  of the  study results on 08 Nov  2019. Furthermore, the  MAH clarified that the sponsor, study 
site personnel and the CROs were blinded to the investigational product received and to the results of 
certain biomarker and pharmacodynamic laboratory results with  potential  for unblinding  (such as B cell 
subsets). This is particularly reassuring, since the B cell depleting mode of action of Benlysta might easily 
help to identify patients treated with  active drug through  laboratory monitoring.  
It was also noted that  the clinically most important endpoint  of CRR recommended in the EMA Guideline 
was affected by these protocol amendments, since the  urinary sediment component was removed. 
According to the  EMA Guideline, induction of major/complete renal response should be ”demonstrated as 
clinically significant improvement of renal function  during induction phase e.g. by improvement of eGFR 
and reducing renal injury, primarily protein excretion and findings in active urinary sediment”. 
Nonetheless, from a clinical point of view, the removal of the urinary sediment item is considered 
acceptable to the  CHMP. 
The CHMP was also concerned about the timing for change to  the primary endpoint since the first change 
occurred in 2017  i.e. 5 years after the first patient entered the study.  However, the MAH  clarified that  the 
revisions to the study protocol were agreed with  EMA before implementation  to the study (change from 
ORR to  mORR: variation II/0049, change from mORR to  PERR: variation II/0062) and that no laboratory 
parameters were unblinded prior to unblinding  of the  study. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the 
changes to  the primary endpoint were not  data driven. 
Overall, the CHMP  concluded that  the changes to the primary endpoint are clinically and statistically 
motivated and that they were made without  knowledge of the outcome of the study. 
Important protocol deviations were frequent and occurred in more than  50% of the patients.  The largest 
proportion of important  protocol deviations was in the category of assessments and/or procedures. The 
MAH  clarified that  important protocol deviations that  could affect key efficacy evaluations and lead to 
subject’s exclusion from PP population were prespecified in the  Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP) based 
on the ICH/E6,  E3, E9 guidelines. The PP set would only be analysed if this population excluded more 
than 15%  of the  mITT population.  Since only 11 (2.5%)  patients were excluded from the PP population 
due to important protocol deviations that  could affect key efficacy analyses, no PP analysis was 
performed. This was agreed by the CHMP.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 448 patients  were included in the study (n=224  in each arm). All randomised patients  were 
included in the safety population. More subjects in  the placebo arm discontinued  from the study (40.8% 
for placebo vs 34.5%  for belimumab). The main reason for discontinuation  in both  arms was adverse 
event. A total  of two patients were excluded from the mITT population because of GCP issues. This is 
acceptable to CHMP.  Most  patients were female (almost 90%),  and of Asian origin (50%).  Only 33%  were 
Caucasian. This can be expected because of the higher prevalence in Asian and black populations, 
however differences in treatment response can differ between populations and subgroup analyses are 
important, as further discussed hereafter. 
A total of 88% of the patients  had a class III or IV nephritis, with  or without  elements of class V. Pure 
membranous (class V) nephritis was found in 16.1%  of the patients. Significant  proteinuria (>0.5  g/g) 
was found in 95% of the patients.  There were no important  differences between the treatment  groups. All 
patients fulfilled the  ACR nephritis criterion. There were no important  differences between the groups with 
regards to ACR criteria. MMF  was the most frequently used induction therapy (73.5% in  both arms). The 
mean prednisone dose was 69.5 mg. Concomitant  antimalarials was used by 71.7%  of the  patients 
(slightly higher in the  belimumab group), and immunosuppressants by 87.4%.  ACEi or ARB were used 
with  a similar frequency in both groups (~65%). 
The primary endpoint, PERR at week 104, was achieved by 72/223  patients (32.3%)  in the placebo group 
and 96/223  patients (43%)  in the belimumab group. The more important  secondary endpoint CRR at the 
same timepoint  was achieved by 44/223  patients (19.7%)  in the placebo group and 67/223  patients 
(30%)  in the belimumab group. The difference is statistically significant  and clinically relevant. Treatment 
group, induction regimen (CYC vs. MMF),  race (Black vs. Non-Black), baseline uPCR, and baseline eGFR 
were included as covariates in the analyses. The results of the components of the PERR and CRR were all 
in favour of belimumab. The risk for renal-related event or death was lower in the belimumab arm. 
For the predefined subgroup of European patients,  there was no convincing difference between the 
groups for PERR, while the difference on CRR was more convincing (9/45  patients, 20% for placebo and 
12/41  patients, 29.3%  for belimumab). Furthermore, an inferior effect in patients from America excluding 
US/Canada was observed. This was found particularly important based on the  knowledge that  patients 
with  proliferative nephritis of African/Hispanic origin have a worse prognosis than other patients.  
The MAH was therefore asked by the CHMP to  discuss differences in treatment effect in patients of 
different ethnicity (not  regions). In response, the MAH  presented data on the Hispanic population,  overall 
and separate for US/Canada and America excluding US/Canada. The inferior efficacy for belimumab than 
compared to placebo seemed to be restricted to America excluding US/Canada only. When looking at 
non-Hispanics in the  same region, the  same pattern was observed. The inferior efficacy for belimumab 
seemed to be observed in the  America-non-US/Canada region, regardless of ethnicity. The MAH  has also 
presented post-hoc analyses of efficacy across race (Asian, White,  Black, American Indian or Alaskan 
Native), where the results for the primary and secondary endpoint displays the  same pattern as in the 
overall analyses. The MAH  concluded that the results in the  overall Hispanic population were driven by the 
negative treatment  effect observed in the Americas excluding US/Canada, while in the US/Canada region 
both Hispanics and non-Hispanics benefited from belimumab treatment,  and that  the efficacy results in 
the Americas excluding US/Canada region were not driven by any particular race or ethnicity. The CHMP 
agrees with  the MAH’s conclusion that  there is no clear explanation to these findings and that  there is no 
evidence that efficacy of Benlysta is influenced by any particular race or ethnicity. 
Subgroup analyses showed that  the efficacy is most prominent in the subgroup of patients  treated with 
concomitant MMF,  and the difference for Benlysta vs placebo is smaller in the  subgroup of patients 
treated with  concomitant cyclophosphamide.

In the pre-specified subgroup analysis of renal biopsy class, there seemed to  be no increased efficacy 
measured as PERR for belimumab than compared to  placebo for patients  with a pure membranous 
nephritis (class V). Class V nephritis is a distinct  clinical entity characterised by proteinuria, often within 
nephrotic-range (>3.5  g/day).  
In patients with  high baseline proteinuria (>=3g/g),  there were no (PERR) or very small (CRR) increase in 
treatment response for the belimumab group compared to the placebo group. The uPCR percent change 
from baseline was similar for the belimumab and placebo groups at week 104.  This was of concern to the 
CHMP,  since these are the patients  with  the worst prognosis. The MAH  argued that  patients with  high 
proteinuria have more advanced LN  with lower response rates due to longer time to proteinuria recovery 
and lower likelihood of complete response. Furthermore, hypocomplementemia, higher SLE activity, and 
low renal function  were reported to be associated with more refractory renal disease and poorer ability to 
respond to  treatment. Review of demographics and baseline characteristics by baseline proteinuria status 
using the 3 g/g  threshold revealed that  subjects in the  ≥3 g/g proteinuria subgroup had higher SLEDAI-
S2K scores, lower eGFR and higher rates of organ damage compared to the  <3 g/g subgroup. 
However, patients  with  high proteinuria are at high unmet need for new treatments.  Standard treatment 
also for these patients is CYC or MMF,  with  MMF  being first line treatment in class V LN  with  nephrotic 
proteinuria. According to EULAR guidelines, in refractory or relapsing disease, off-label treatment  with 
RTX may be considered. There is some support for MMF  and high-dose CYC in severe forms of LN 
associated with  increased risk of progression into end-stage renal disease (reduced glomerular filtration 
rate, histological presence of fibrous crescents or fibrinoid necrosis, or tubular  atrophy/interstitial 
fibrosis). Furthermore, calcineurin inhibitors may be considered as second-line agents for induction or 
maintenance therapy mainly in membranous LN,  podocytopathy, or in proliferative disease with refractory 
nephrotic syndrome, despite standard-of-care within 3–6  months. Thus, there are no approved 
treatments for these patients  that  treatment. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that  the use of belimumab in 
this group could be supported by the efficacy primarily based on the  small observed increase in CRR 
compared to placebo even though  limited. Nonetheless, the MAH  was requested to further justify the 
efficacy for this  subgroup of patients  with nephrotic range proteinuria, with  special focus on reduction of 
proteinuria. In their response, the MAH presented a reasonable rationale as to why patients  with 
nephrotic-range proteinuria were less likely to respond to therapy, referring to  publications describing 
association with  longer time to proteinuria resolution and lower likelihood of complete response in these 
patients. In some studies, more than 5 years was needed to achieve complete renal response. The MAH 
argued that  although belimumab did not increase the  renal response or remission rate compared to 
treatment with  only cyclophosphamide or MMF,  there seemed to be a benefit when it comes to  renal-
related event or death also in patients  with high  baseline proteinuria. The MAH’s  argumentation was 
acceptable to the  CHMP, and the issue on the post-hoc efficacy analysis across subgroups of baseline 
proteinuria was not  further pursued.  
The lower belimumab exposure in subjects with  high baseline proteinuria and its  impact on the efficacy 
results is discussed in the PK assessment (Section 2.3.5. of the assessment report). The available data do 
not support a dose adjustment  in subjects with  high  baseline proteinuria. 
In the overall population, a small numerical difference in percental reduction of proteinuria is shown in 
favour of belimumab, however the absolute reduction was numerically higher in the placebo group. This 
could possibly be explained by a slightly  higher mean baseline proteinuria level at baseline for the placebo 
group. A gradual decline in  mean eGFR values is observed for the placebo group starting from Week 52, 
while renal function seems relatively stable in belimumab treated subjects. 
Corticosteroid use was not a multiplicity-controlled  endpoint. A numerical higher proportion of patients  in 
the belimumab arm was able to reduce steroids below 5 and 7.5  mg, respectively.

The initially proposed indication was not  agreed by CHMP  since it  was too broad and included all biopsy 
classes of LN. Study BEL114054  did not  include patients with  class I or II nephritis whereas Benlysta is 
proposed for LN patients  in combination with  MMF  or cyclophosphamide, which  is not applicable for LN 
class I and II. The MAH  argued that  in the pivotal SLE studies, where patients with  class I and II nephritis 
were eligible for inclusion i.e. Benlysta was given to patients  with  high disease activity despite standard 
therapy. However, the pivotal SLE studies were not  designed to study the  efficacy in the specific 
subgroup of class I and II LN patients.  The MAH agreed upon the CHMP’s  request to  revise the indication 
to patients  with active  lupus nephritis  where treatment with  background immunosuppressives is 
considered.  
Since LN  is a severe manifestation of SLE, the MAH  was also requested to justify a separate LN  indication 
from the  SLE indication in patients  with active, autoantibody-positive SLE with a high degree of disease 
activity despite standard therapy in order to apply the CHMP´s principles of wording of the indication 
(EMA/CHMP/483022/2019)  foreseeing that if a study population is already covered by the already 
approved indication, an extension of the indication  in section 4.1 of the SmPC is not  accepted. The MAH 
clarified that  in Study BEL114054  as in the claimed LN  indication, treatment  with Benlysta is first line 
therapy in  combination with intensive immunosuppressants whereas the existing SLE indication is for use 
in patients  who do not  respond to standard treatment i.e., continue to  have active disease “despite 
standard therapy”. The CHMP  agreed with the  justification that  the different place in therapy for Benlysta 
in SLE patients  and the  LN subgroup supports the inclusion of a separate LN indication.   
Finally, the  MAH was requested to justify the  inclusion of Class V LN  patient  in the indication and to 
discuss the benefit of adding belimumab to SOC in this subgroup. The MAH presented data supportive of 
an efficacy in this subgroup, in particular a reduced risk for renal-related event or death. It is 
acknowledged by the CHMP that  there is an overlap between class III/IV and class V nephritis, and that 
the subgroup of patients with  pure class V nephritis  was too small to enable firm conclusion. The CHMP 
agreed to a broad LN  indication including  patients with  class V nephritis provided that  the prescribers are 
clearly informed of the efficacy results on membranous LN (class V). Class V LN is a specific LN  entity, 
and the efficacy in this subgroup is considered of importance for the prescribers. The MAH  was thus 
requested to  include the  results in  subgroups of patients with  different biopsy classes in section 5.1  of the 
SmPC. The inclusion of these clinically relevant subgroup analyses in the SmPC is in  line with the  SmPC 
guideline, “In the exceptional cases where clinically relevant information from subgroup or post-hoc 
analyses is presented; it  should be identified as such in a balanced manner reflecting the limited 
robustness of both  positive and negative secondary observations”. The MAH agreed to  include a forest 
plot showing the  primary endpoint for the prespecified subgroups in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from study BEL114054  show a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect for 
belimumab when it comes to  primary and all major secondary endpoints.  
The MAH agreed to revise the initially  claimed broad indication upon the CHMP’s  request to following 
agreed indication (section 4.1  of the  SmPC): in combination with  background immunosuppressive 
therapies for the treatment of adult  patients with  active lupus nephritis (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Subgroup analyses showed that  the efficacy was most prominent in  the subgroup of patients  treated with 
background MMF,  and in  patients with  histopathological class III/IV nephritis. Subgroup analyses results 
are included in Section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Furthermore, section 4.4 of the SmPC is updated to remove the statement that  Benlysta has not been 
studied and is not recommended in severe active LN. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of Benlysta includes infections, hypersensitivity and infusion/injection-related systemic 
reactions, and psychiatric events including  depression and suicidality.  Potential risks listed in the RMP 
include progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML),  malignancies, immunogenicity, and effects on 
immunizations. At the  approval of Benlysta, there was concern on an increased mortality for Benlysta 
than compared to placebo, primarily due to infections. A large PASS (BASE) including  >4000 patients  was 
recently finished. The results led to a DHPC on the risk for psychiatric events including  depression and 
suicidality (II/65), and updates of the SmPC to include an increased risk for fatal infections (II/76). 
Patient exposure 
A total of 448 subjects were randomized in  study BEL114054  (224 in each group), all of whom received 
at least 1 dose of IP and constitute  the safety population.  
The mean (SD) duration of exposure to study agent in  the BEL114054  mITT population was 546.4 
(251.3)  days for placebo and 577.3 (243.5)  days for belimumab. The median (range) duration of 
exposure was 726.0  (28 to  748) days in  the placebo group and 727.0 (28  to 743) days in the belimumab 
group. 
Adverse events 
The AE presentations in this  section are primarily for the on-treatment period. For subjects who did not 
continue into  the OLE, the on-treatment  period is defined by the treatment  start date up to and including 
the treatment stop  date +28  days or the date of IP discontinuation  (whichever was longer). The AE must 
have started on or any time after the first dose of IP (having been absent pre-treatment or worsened 
relative to the  pre-treatment state). AEs with  missing start dates were assumed to be on-treatment. For 
those subjects who continued on to the OLE,  the on-treatment stop date for the double-blind period was 
the date of the Week 104  infusion (as the  Week 104 infusions represent Day 1 of the OLE)  but any events 
pre-infusion on that day are part of the double-blind period. AEs reported on the day of the first OLE-
infusion are accounted for in both study periods.  
Additionally, pre- and post-treatment  AE summaries were generated. The pre-treatment period is defined 
as the date prior to the  first dose of IP. The start of post-treatment period is defined by the start date of 
the first missed dose of IP +1  day or 29 days after the last dose of IP (whichever was longer). For all 
subjects, AEs were to be reported through 8 weeks after the last IP administration. For subjects who 
discontinued IP but remained in the  study, SAEs collection continued through  Week 104.  
It was expected that  there would  be different safety profiles observed during the first 24  weeks of 
treatment (induction  phase) and post Week 24 (maintenance phase) due to high disease activity with 
high levels of proteinuria and intensive immunosuppressive therapy during  the induction phase. 
Therefore, summaries were generated for AEs during first  24 weeks which included induction  therapy and 
for AEs during the maintenance phase (post  Week 24). Differences in AEs between the time  periods 
(where relevant) are discussed.

Adverse event summary 
An overall summary of incidence of AEs for the on-treatment period is provided in Table 35.  
Table 35.  Adverse Events Summary (Double-Blind, Safety Population) 
Adverse Events by System Organ Class 
The system organ classes (SOCs) with  >30% of subjects (in both groups) experiencing an AE were 
infections and infestations (76.3%  placebo, 82.1%  belimumab), gastrointestinal  (GI) disorders (47.3% 
placebo, 45.1%  belimumab), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (36.2%  placebo, 32.6% 
belimumab) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (31.3% placebo, 33.9% belimumab) (Table 36).  
The 3 SOCs with  a >5% difference between treatment groups overall were infections and infestations 
(76.3%  placebo, 82.1%  belimumab), general disorders and administration  site conditions (28.1% 
placebo, 22.8%  belimumab) and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (21.4% placebo, 27.7%

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
An overview of serious adverse events is presented in  Table 35. 
Serious AEs by SOC were similar between treatment  groups in the  overall population (29.9% placebo, 
25.9%  belimumab; with  the highest  incidence in infections and infestations (17.0%  placebo, 13.8% 
belimumab). 
During the first 24 weeks of treatment,  there were 24 and 27 serious infections in placebo [in 20 (8.9%) 
subjects] and belimumab [in  19 (8.5%),  subjects], respectively. Post Week 24 (80-week maintenance 
phase), subjects reported fewer events in both  treatment groups with 19  and 13 serious infections in 
placebo [18  (9.2%) subjects] and belimumab [12  (6.1%)  subjects], respectively.  
The overall rates of serious infections in BEL114054  were higher than  observed in the  pooled SLE 
population; however, this  was driven by the events within  the first  24 weeks of treatment (while subjects 
are receiving intensive induction  of LN  remission therapy). The rate of serious infections during the 
maintenance phase of BEL114054  was comparable to the  rates observed in the pooled SLE studies.   
Four subjects in the belimumab group experienced SAEs associated with Grade 4 (laboratory toxicity) 
neutropenia: 2 events of febrile neutropenia and 2 events of pancytopenia. One subject with 
pancytopenia had received 2 doses of induction therapy with  CYC after which the total  leukocyte and 
neutrophil counts decreased prior to receiving belimumab and prior to  the onset of pancytopenia. 
Neutropenia has been reported in  patients with  SLE (20% to 40%)  with  severe neutropenia reported in 
cases (0.8%  to 4%) in those treated with  CYC, AZA or MMF  and patients  with SLE [Carli, 2015 28]. 
Additionally, in BEL114054  subjects with stable Grade 3 neutropenia or stable Grade 3 leukopenia were 
permitted to enrol in the study, if they were not receiving CYC at  screening. All cases of neutropenia in 
BEL114054  were confounded by the  concurrent use of CYC, AZA, or MMF  in  the setting of underlying 
neutropenia associated with  the disease under study. 
Deaths 
A total of 11 deaths (including  off-treatment deaths) occurred during the double-blind phase, 5  (2.2%) 
subjects in the placebo group and 6 (2.7%)  in the belimumab group (Table 35). In 7 subjects 
(4 belimumab and 3 placebo) these fatal SAEs occurred while on study treatment.  In the  remaining 4 
subjects, the fatal SAEs occurred post treatment  (2 placebo, 2 belimumab). 
A summary of the  deaths is provided in  Table 39.  
Infections was the  most common cause of death in both  groups, including  2 possibly related to 
belimumab: 
-  the first case was a 63-year-old woman with  concomitant CYC who developed pancytopenia and a 
bacterial pneumonia 14 days after the first dose of Benlysta. Abnormalities reported in bone marrow 
could be a result of a possible synergic effect of cyclophosphamide and Benlysta, but  firm conclusions of 
the role of Benlysta cannot be drawn. 
- the second case was a 49-year-old women from Taiwan. Sixty (60)  days after the  first dose of 
belimumab and 4  days after the  most recent dose, she was admitted to  the ICU with severe bilateral 
pneumonia. Pathogens proved by BAL and sputum  examinations included Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
pneumocystis jirovecii, cytomegalovirus, and throat swab was also positive for Influenza A. Sputum 
culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment was given against TB, influenza, CMV, pneumocystis

Adverse events of special interest 
Given the potential  risks associated with  immune modulating therapeutic proteins as well as data from 
previously completed studies, a group of AESI were pre-specified: malignant neoplasms, post-
infusion/anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions, all infections of special interest, and 
depression/suicide/self-injury. A summary of AESI in study BEL114054  and completed SLE studies  are

Malignant  neoplasms 
There were no malignancies reported in the placebo group. Three subjects (1.3%)  in the belimumab 
group (during on-treatment phase) experienced malignancies: one case each of basal cell carcinoma (AZA 
maintenance period), papillary thyroid cancer (MMF),  and thymoma (MMF).  The papillary thyroid cancer 
(T1a R/O N1a) occurred 159 days after the first  dose of belimumab + MMF  and was treated with  a total 
thyroidectomy. The thymoma (type B/type 1) occurred 1 year and 118  days after the  first dose of 
belimumab + MMF  and was a low-grade hyperplasia that was conservatively adjudicated as a malignancy. 
According to the  MAH, no clinically meaningful differences were observed for any malignant  neoplasm 
category. 
Infections of special interest 
Infections of special interest included: opportunistic infections, herpes zoster (HZ), tuberculosis and 
sepsis (all and serious). In general, there were no clinically relevant differences observed between the 
treatment groups in the overall safety population  and by induction/maintenance subgroup.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/548269/2020 
Page 81/96 
 
 
  
  
 
 
A slightly higher number of serious infections of special interest was observed during the first 24 weeks of 
treatment in both  treatment arms (2.2%  placebo, 3.1%  belimumab), which was likely due to intensive 
immunosuppressive therapy and high doses of corticosteroids. Serious infections of special interest 
decreased (1.0% placebo and 1.0% belimumab) during the maintenance phase (post  Week 24) of the 
study. 
Regarding herpes zoster, there were no clinically meaningful differences in the  incidence of HZ events 
between treatment groups overall (8.5% placebo, 9.4%  belimumab), during the first 24 weeks (4.5% 
placebo, 5.8%  belimumab) or post Week 24  (5.6% placebo, 4.1%  belimumab).  
Although the  incidences of HZ were higher in this  study compared to those observed in the pooled SLE 
studies (4.0%  placebo, 3.6% belimumab), the incidence of HZ in the belimumab group was within  the 
range (6.5%  to 11.2%)  described in literature in studies most closely aligned with  BEL114054  in terms of 
follow-up and patient  demographics [Mok, 2019 29; Park, 2019 30; Houssiau, 2010 31]. 
The main risk factors for HZ in SLE and LN  have been described as exposure to corticosteroids, 
immunosuppressive drugs including  oral and IV CYC, renal impairment, and lymphopenia [Chen, 2011; 
Hu,  2016; Singh, 2016].  Multiple  reports have described increased incidence of HZ in patients treated 
with  MMF.  A study in LN  showed a higher frequency of HZ infection (18%) during  the first 6 months of 
treatment with  MMF  vs 3% in patients  treated with  tacrolimus [Mok, 2016 32].  Opportunistic infections and 
HZ (disseminating and recurrent) are expected in the SLE patient  population, in association with the  use 
of background immunosuppressant medications, and have been reported in LN  patients being treated 
with  MMF. 
The MAH concludes that the  observed frequencies in this  study of all events of HZ  (serious, opportunistic 
and disseminated) are in line with  published data for HZ infection in LN. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology parameters 
The total percentage of subjects with either a Grade 3 or Grade 4 value post-baseline were generally 
similar between the  belimumab and placebo groups for each haematology parameter, except that  a 
slightly higher proportion of subjects in the  belimumab group had a Grade 3  value neutrophils (2.7% 
placebo, 3.6%  belimumab).  
Events of Grade 4 neutropenia were balanced overall and between the  induction regimens for the 8 
subjects (4 belimumab, 4 placebo) that  had their laboratory results reported by central laboratory. Two 
additional belimumab subjects developed Grade 4 neutropenia during AZA maintenance. In 4 out  of the 6 
belimumab subjects with  Grade 4 neutropenia, treatment with  belimumab was resumed and the subjects 
remained in the study.  Given the small numbers, the  presence of confounding medications and the 
underlying disease state, these cases were considered not to be causally related to belimumab and 
clinically meaningful differences were not seen.

Immunoglobulins 
Two subjects; one placebo and one belimumab (both in the MMF  subgroup), had IP withdrawn  as a result 
of a Grade 4  IgG, with  no obvious signs of infection noted. 
Immunogenicity 
Belimumab has a low propensity for inducing anti-drug  antibodies. None of the 224  belimumab-treated 
subjects confirmed positive for anti-belimumab antibodies. 
Safety in special populations 
A total of 8 pregnancies were reported during the double-blind phase of study BEL114054.  Five 
pregnancies were in  subjects receiving placebo: 4  resulted in live births and1 resulted in a spontaneous 
abortion. Three pregnancies were reported in subjects receiving belimumab: 2 resulted in an elective 
abortion, 1 subject was lost to follow-up. No congenital anomalies were reported. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The large molecular weight  of belimumab precludes it  from being metabolized by the cytochrome P450 
system. Thus, the types of drug interactions that  occur between 1 or more drugs that compete for 
metabolism by this  family of enzymes are not expected with  belimumab. For these reasons, nonclinical 
drug interaction studies were not  considered relevant for belimumab. Also, since belimumab is a 
monoclonal antibody with  high specificity, no nonclinical studies were undertaken to examine potential 
pharmacodynamic drug interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of AEs resulting in IP discontinuation  were the  same between the treatment groups (12.9% 
in both  treatment groups). Infections and infestations were the most common AEs leading to IP 
discontinuation:  overall (4.5% in both  treatment groups), in the CYC/AZA subgroup (1.7% placebo, 
3.3% belimumab) and in the MMF  subgroup (5.5%  placebo, 4.9%  belimumab).

Post marketing experience 
Benlysta has been approved since 2011 for use in the treatment of patients with  active, autoantibody-
positive SLE who are receiving therapy. Although  not approved for LN,  as of 06  Mar 2020 there were 11 
SAEs reported when using Benlysta off-label for a LN indication.  There were no trends detected in the 
types of events reported and all were consistent with  the known safety profile of Benlysta.  
This section discusses the post marketing experience with the current registered SLE indication. The 
cumulative post-marketing exposure to belimumab is estimated to be 83,577 patient  years based on data 
from IQVIA through  31 December 2018. This estimate reflects exposure to both the IV formulation 
(78,427  patient years) and the SC formulation (5150 patient years). 
Routine pharmacovigilance is ongoing for belimumab. In addition,  the EU Risk Management Plan specifies 
risk minimization  measures including ongoing surveillance of important  identified and potential risks. 
Based on headline results for study BEL115467,  GSK recategorized depression and suicidality from a 
potential risk to an identified risk. The other identified risks are hypersensitivity and infusion or injection-
related systemic reactions, and infections. Potential risks are PML, malignancies, immunogenicity, and 
effects on immunizations,  including interactions with  live vaccines. Areas requiring confirmation or further 
investigation include pregnancy outcomes, the use of belimumab in elderly patients, severe active CNS 
lupus and investigation into  SLE patients with  severe LN.  
Two belimumab registries are ongoing. HGS1006-C1124  (BEL116543/SABLE)  is a 5-year prospective 
observational registry to assess adverse events of interest and effectiveness in adults with  active, 
autoantibody-positive SLE treated with or without  Benlysta (belimumab). The Benlysta Pregnancy 
Registry is a prospective cohort study. The primary objective of this  registry is to evaluate pregnancy and 
infant outcomes following Benlysta exposure and health status of live born infants  at 1 year. 
A cumulative and periodic report of post-marketing surveillance was submitted  as scheduled in the 
belimumab Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report dated 08  May 2019,  which covers the reporting period 
from 09  March 2018 to 08  March 2019.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The cumulative exposure to belimumab (both IV and SC formulations) post-marketing is 108,447  patient 
years. The safety profile of Benlysta includes infections, hypersensitivity and infusion/injection-related 
systemic reactions, and psychiatric events including depression and suicidality. Potential risks listed in  the 
RMP include PML,  malignancies, immunogenicity, and effects on immunizations.   
A total of 448 subjects with  LN were randomized in study BEL114054  (224  in each group), all of whom 
received at least 1  dose of study drug and constitute  the safety population.  
The mean (SD) duration of exposure to study agent in  the BEL114054  mITT population was 546.4 
(251.3)  days for placebo and 577.3 (243.5)  days for belimumab. The median (range) duration of 
exposure was 726.0  (28 to  748) days in  the placebo group and 727.0 (28  to 743) days in the belimumab 
group. 
Adverse events 
The incidence of subjects experiencing at least 1 AE in the  overall population was 94.2%  in the placebo 
group and 95.5% in the  belimumab group. The most common adverse event SOC was infections and 
infestations, with  the most common adverse event being upper respiratory tract infection.   
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/548269/2020 
Page 84/96 
 
 
  
  
Serious AEs occurred in 29.9% of the patients  in the placebo group and 25.9% of the patients  in the 
belimumab group. In the subgroup of patients treated with  CYC/AZA, the frequency of AEs and SAEs was 
slightly higher for belimumab than  compared to placebo, however there were few patients in this 
subgroup hampering firm conclusions. 
There were 11 deaths in the study (5 placebo, 6 belimumab). The incidence of deaths in BEL114054  was 
higher (2.2% placebo and 2.7%  belimumab) compared to the incidence observed in the pooled SLE 
studies (0.4%  placebo, 0.6% belimumab). According to  the MAH, this  is consistent with  literature where 
the risk of mortality in LN  (6- to  6.8-fold) is higher than SLE (2.4-fold)  when compared to general 
population which  could be attributed  to a higher frequency of co-morbidities, frequent use of potent 
immunosuppressants and HDCS as well as higher disease activity. This is agreed on by CHMP. 
Infections was the  most common cause of death in both  groups. This is consistent with  the known safety 
profile of Benlysta, and not  surprising because treatment  was given on top of intense 
immunosuppression. There were 2 cases of deaths due to  infections possibly related to  belimumab.  
The first death occurred in a patient with  concomitant CYC who developed pancytopenia and a bacterial 
pneumonia 14 days after the first dose of Benlysta. Abnormalities reported in bone marrow could be a 
result of a possible synergic effect of cyclophosphamide and Benlysta, but  firm conclusions of the role of 
Benlysta cannot be drawn. 
The second death was reported in a patient who  presented severe bilateral pneumonia 60  days after the 
first dose of belimumab and 4 days after the most recent dose. Pathogens proved by BAL and sputum 
examinations included Mycobacterium tuberculosis, pneumocystis jirovecii, cytomegalovirus, and throat 
swab was also positive for Influenza A. Sputum  culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Treatment was 
given against TB, influenza, CMV, pneumocystis jiroveci and bacterial pneumonia. Upon  the CHMP’s 
request, the MAH confirmed that TB testing  was not  performed in this case. The risk for reactivation of 
latent TB was thoroughly discussed in the  latest PSUSA where it  was concluded that  no recommendation 
on latent TB screening was needed in section 4.4  of the SmPC. Furthermore, the patient was positive for 
pneumocystis jiroveci. Patients  with LN  are at high  risk for pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) and 
there is support in literature for prophylactic treatment of patients treated with  cyclophosphamide. The 
MAH  was asked to  discuss whether PCP prophylaxis with pentamidine inhalations should be recommended 
for LN patients  treated with  Benlysta, both  in combination with  CYC and MMF.  The MAH  provided further 
details on the case of PCP reported in  study BEL114054.  Furthermore, a review of company’s safety 
database revealed 11 additional reports of PCP. According to the MAH,  all of the cases of PCP received for 
patients concurrently receiving belimumab from both clinical trial and spontaneous sources were 
significantly confounded by the severity of the disease, levels of intense immunosuppression and high 
dose corticosteroid use, and there are no evidence for a causal relationship between PCP and the  use of 
belimumab. The MAH  concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support a SmPC update to include 
PCP prophylaxis recommendations for LN patients  treated with  Benlysta. This is agreed on by the CHMP. 
In the 28-week open-label extension phase, there was one additional death (multiple  organ dysfunction 
syndrome, sepsis secondary to healthcare associated pneumonia, and chronic kidney disease) 85 days 
after the first open-label infusion in  a patient  switching  from placebo to belimumab. 
Infections are known side effects of Benlysta treatment, and there are no new safety signals observed in 
these data. 
AESIs 
Pre-specified AESIs were malignant neoplasms, post-infusion/anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions, all 
infections of special interest, and depression/suicide/self-injury. Although there was an imbalance in 
cases of malignancies with  2 cases both occurring in the Benlysta arm and the cases occurred after a 
reasonable latency, there were few cases and no conclusions can be drawn. According to the MAH,  there 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/548269/2020 
Page 85/96 
 
 
  
  
were no malignancies reported during the open-label phase. Serious infections of special interest 
(including  herpes zoster) were slightly more frequent for Benlysta than for placebo during the first 24 
weeks. CHMP  agrees with the  MAH that  the observed frequencies of herpes zoster are in line with 
published data for HZ  infection in LN patients. 
Laboratory values 
A slightly higher proportion of subjects in the belimumab group had a Grade 3 value neutrophils  (2.7% 
placebo, 3.6%  belimumab). However, when looking at the actual values, there are no important 
difference between the arms. Events of Grade 4 neutropenia were balanced between the arms. 
Although there was a case of death due to pneumonia and pancytopenia, overall there seems to be no 
clinically meaningful increase in  risk for neutropenia for belimumab than  compared to placebo. 
Leukopenia is listed in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. This is considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
No Benlysta-treated patient  developed ADAs.  
Long-term data in the LN  population are limited. The MAH clarified that no additional pharmacovigilance 
activities will be performed in LN  patients. Spontaneous cases received with  a reported indication of LN 
will be documented in future reviews including signal evaluations, and PSURs. This was agreed by CHMP 
since even though the  safety in patients with  severe LN and intense concomitant treatment might  differ 
from the  non-LN population,  no new safety concerns were identified from the available data in LN  patients 
(104-week double-blind phase plus 28  weeks open-label extension). 
The safety data presented from study BEL114054  is overall consistent with  the known safety profile of 
Benlysta, with  an increased risk for infections and fatal infections. The current population of LN  patients 
are more fragile than the overall SLE population  due to  severe organ involvement and concomitant  heavy 
immunosuppression, and an increased risk for infections and death than compared to the overall SLE 
population was observed in the study. Nonetheless, given the  high unmet medical need for the LN 
population at an increased risk for organ failure and death, these risks are accepted. Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC is updated with  summary of safety data in LN  patients (most common ADRs) and incidences of 
infections, serious infections and fatal infections.   
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety data presented from study BEL114054  is overall consistent with  the known safety profile of 
Benlysta in the  SLE population, with  an increased risk for infections and fatal infections. LN  patients are 
more fragile than the overall SLE population due to severe organ involvement and concomitant  heavy 
immunosuppression. However, given the high  unmet medical need in the LN  population at an increased 
risk for organ failure and death, the safety profile of Benlysta in the treatment of patients with  LN  is 
found acceptable to the  CHMP.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list  of Union  reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7)  of Directive 2001/83/EC

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication,  sections 4.1,  4.2, 4.4,  4.8, 5.1  and 5.2  of the  SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with  target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted  by the  MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the proposed 
changes are limited and not considered to significantly affect the readability of the package leaflet. No 
change to the layout is proposed. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
SLE is a heterogeneous chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease. Renal involvement is present in an 
average of 38% of patients  at the time of SLE diagnosis and occurs in  40-70% of SLE patients  during the 
course of their disease. SLE patients that  are more likely to develop renal disease are typically of younger 
age, male and African, Asian or Hispanic. Approximately 10-20%  of patients progress to ESRD within  10-
15 years since LN diagnosis. LN  is the  most common and severe systemic manifestation of SLE that 
remains the most significant  cause of morbidity and mortality.  The location of immune complex 
deposition as confirmed by renal biopsy, defines the different histopathological classes of LN  according to 
the Renal Pathology Society Working Group and the International Society of Nephrology Working Group 
(ISN/RPS Criteria from 2003)  classification and informs the LN  management and prognosis. 
LN  manifestations range from minimal proteinuria and microscopic haematuria to nephrotic range 
proteinuria, urinary casts, severe hypertension, peripheral oedema, and renal insufficiency or acute renal 
failure. Typical disease course of LN is characterized by episodes of flares interspersed between periods of 
disease quiescence. 
Mortality  is highest  amongst SLE patients with  proliferative renal involvement (Classes III and IV) and 
progression to renal failure is strongly predictive of mortality. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current approaches to the management of LN  continue to rely on high  dose corticosteroids (HDCS) and 
broad-spectrum immunosuppressive agents. First line standard therapies include CYC and HDCS for 
induction  followed by AZA for maintenance or MMF  and HDCS for induction  followed by MMF  for 
maintenance. Despite the aggressive nature of treatment,  management of LN remains unsatisfactory. 
More than 60%  of patients  fail to  achieve remission and up to 25% of patients in  remission experience 
relapse. Suboptimal disease control results in irreversible nephron loss and progression to ESRD within 
10-15  years of LN  diagnosis. In addition  to the challenges presented by the severity of the disease, 
cumulative exposure to potent non-selective immunosuppressants and corticosteroid burden are 
associated with  significant side effects, long-term toxicities and organ damage accrual.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study BEL114054  was a Phase 3,  multi-center, multi-national,  randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, 104-week study to evaluate the  efficacy and safety of IV belimumab 10  mg/kg plus 
standard of care compared to placebo plus standard of care in  adult SLE patients with  active LN 
(histological classes III, IV, V or V in combination with  III or IV LN).  
All subjects received background therapy consisting of one of the following standard of care regimens: 
•  HDCS + CYC for induction  therapy followed by Azathioprine (AZA) for maintenance therapy 
OR 
•  HDCS+ MMF  for induction therapy followed by MMF  for maintenance therapy 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the PERR at Week 104 measured as a dichotomous response 
(Responder vs. Non-Responder). A responder is defined as urine protein to creatine ration (uPCR) ≤0.7 
and eGFR is no more than 20% below pre-flare value or ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2  and Not  a Treatment 
Failure.  
“Not  a treatment failure” equals to patients who  did not take protocol prohibited or restricted medication 
or dose specified in the  protocol as: 
•  New immunosuppressant agents (other than as part of the induction  and maintenance regimens). 
•  Corticosteroid use outside of the limits. 
•  Other investigational agents (biologic or non-biologic). Investigational applies to  any drug not 
approved for sale in the country in which it  is being used.   
•  Anti-TNF  therapy (eg, adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab).  
•  Other biologics (eg, rituximab, abatacept, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist  [anakinra]). 
•

Plasmapheresis. 
The 4 major secondary efficacy endpoints were: CRR at  Week 104, PERR at Week 52, Time to Death or 
Renal-related Event, and ORR at  Week 104.  
A total of 446 patients  were included in the study (n=223  in each arm). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint, PERR at week 104, was achieved by 72/223  patients (32.3%)  in the placebo group 
and 96/223  patients (43%)  in the belimumab group (OR=1.55,  95% CI: 1.04-2.32,  p value for difference 
between belimumab and placebo=0.03).  
Among secondary endpoints, CRR at the same timepoint  was achieved by 44/223  patients (19.7%)  in the 
placebo group and 67/223  patients (30%)  in the belimumab group (p value for difference between 
belimumab and placebo =0.0167).  PERR at  52 weeks was achieved by 79/223  patients (35.4%)  in the 
placebo group and 104/223  (46.6%)  in the belimumab group (p value for difference between belimumab 
and placebo =0.02).  Renal-related event or death occurred in 63/223  patients (28.3%)  in the  placebo 
group and 35/223 patients  (15.7%)  in the belimumab group (HR  0.51, 95%  CI 0.34-0.77,  p value for 
difference between belimumab and placebo =0.001).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No data are available in patients  with class I or II nephritis. Study BEL114054  did not include patients 
with  class I or II nephritis whereas Benlysta is proposed for LN  patients in combination with  MMF  or 
cyclophosphamide, which is not applicable for LN  class I and II. The MAH  argued that  in the pivotal SLE 
studies, where patients with  class I and II nephritis were eligible for inclusion i.e. Benlysta was given to 
patients with  high disease activity despite standard therapy. However, the pivotal SLE studies were not 
designed to  study the efficacy in the specific subgroup of class I and II LN  patients. The MAH  agreed upon 
the CHMP’s  request to revise the indication  to patients with  active  lupus nephritis where treatment with 
background immunosuppressives is considered.  
The efficacy in the pre-specified subgroup analysis of renal biopsy class V on the primary endpoint  PERR 
was not shown. However, a trend for reduced risk of renal-related event or death was observed in this 
subgroup, CHMP agrees that  class V LN patients  could benefit from treatment with  Benlysta in  addition to 
SOC. Furthermore, the efficacy is most prominent in the subgroup of patients treated with  concomitant 
MMF,  and the  difference for Benlysta vs placebo is smaller in the subgroup of patients treated with 
concomitant cyclophosphamide. Hence, the CHMP  agreed that class V should be included in the indication. 
Subgroup analyses results are included in Section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
There were many protocol amendments made throughout the  study, including change of primary 
endpoint that  raised concerns on the study reliability. The original study primary endpoint of ORR 
including urinary sediment and calculated GFR at Week 104  (IPD/TF/WD=NR; Van Elteren test)  was 
included as a pre-planned sensitivity analysis. The results favoured belimumab but were not statistically 
significant. Thus,  this change had an impact on the outcome of the study, in favour of the sponsor. The 
changes to  the primary endpoint were thoroughly reviewed as part of the  clinical efficacy assessment. 
The timing for the changes to  the primary endpoint and their impact on the study reliability were 
discussed. The MAH  confirmed that  these changes were made prior to unblinding  of the study results. All 
changes were agreed with EMA  before implementation and made prior to unblinding  of the study results. 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that  these changes were not data-driven but motivated from a clinical 
and statistical point  of view and therefore did not affect study results reliability. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The incidence of subjects experiencing at least 1 AE in the  overall population was 94.2%  in the placebo 
group and 95.5% in the  belimumab group. The most common adverse event SOC was infections and 
infestations, with  the most common adverse event being upper respiratory tract infection.   
Serious AEs occurred in 29.9% of the patients  in the placebo group and 25.9% of the patients  in the 
belimumab group. In the subgroup of patients treated with  CYC/AZA, the frequency of AEs and SAEs was 
slightly higher for belimumab than  compared to placebo, however there were few patients in this 
subgroup (placebo n=59,  belimumab n=60). 
There were 11 deaths in the study (5 placebo, 6 belimumab). One additional death in a belimumab-
treated patient occurred during the  open-label extension phase. Infections were the most common cause 
of death in both groups. The current population  of LN  patients are more fragile than  the overall SLE 
population due to severe organ involvement and concomitant heavy immunosuppression, and an 
increased risk for infections and fatal infections than compared to the overall SLE population was 
observed in the study. Nonetheless, given the  high unmet medical need for the LN population at an 
increased risk for organ failure and death, these risks are accepted.

3.5.   Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long-term data in the LN  population are limited. CHMP agreed that  monitoring through  routine 
pharmacovigilance in the post marketing setting is sufficient since no new safety concerns were identified 
from the  available safety data. 
There was one case of death in  a woman with  bilateral pneumonia where pathogens proved by BAL and 
sputum examinations included Mycobacterium tuberculosis and pneumocystis jirovecii. This patient  had 
not been screened for TB. No SmPC update was deemed necessary since the risk for reactivation of latent 
TB was reviewed in the  latest PSUSA where it  was concluded that  no recommendation on latent TB 
screening was needed in section 4.4  of the  SmPC. Furthermore, patients with  LN are at high risk for PCP 
and there is support in  literature for prophylactic treatment of patients treated with cyclophosphamide. A 
review of the MAH’s  safety database where 11 additional reports of PCP were identified indicated that  the 
cases were significantly confounded by the severity of the  disease, levels of intense immunosuppression 
and high dose corticosteroid use. The CHMP  agreed with  the MAH’s conclusion that  there are no evidences 
for a causal relationship between PCP and the use of belimumab and that there is insufficient evidence to 
support a SmPC update.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The aim of treatment for LN  is to achieve complete renal response. This has been shown to be associated 
with  a favourable long-term renal prognosis in the context of RCTs and long-term observational studies, 
and therefore, is considered the ultimate therapeutic goal in LN  (Kostopoulou, Curr Rheum Rep 2020 
22:3027). 
According to the  EMA Guideline (EMA/CHMP/51230/2013  corr 1),  studies conducted in patients with  LN 
should be aimed for the control of renal activity with  complete renal response recommended as 
primary endpoint. The primary endpoint chosen in the pivotal study BEL114054,  PERR which is a partial 
response differs from the EMA  Guideline recommendation. A partial response could possibly have been 
accepted by the CHMP  if assessed at an earlier timepoint,  however, at 104 weeks, the CHMP considers 
that the treatment should aim for remission. Therefore, the efficacy assessment focused also on the 
secondary endpoint of complete renal response (CRR). 
The primary endpoint, PERR, was achieved by a higher proportion of patients in the  belimumab group 
than compared to the  placebo group. The difference is statistically  significant. Also, the  clinically more 
relevant secondary endpoint of CRR was achieved by a higher proportion of patients  in the belimumab 
group than compared to the placebo group. 
The primary endpoint was changed several times throughout  the ongoing study. The changes to the 
primary endpoint while the  study was ongoing were thoroughly discussed during the procedure. The MAH 
clarified that  the revisions to the  study protocol were agreed with EMA  before their implementation, that 
all changes to the  primary endpoint were made prior to unblinding  of the study results and that no 
laboratory parameters were unblinded prior to unblinding  of the  study. Therefore, CHMP concluded that 
the changes to primary endpoint were not  data driven but  motivated from a clinical and statistical  point of 
view and therefore did  not affect the  study results reliability. 
No data are available in patients  with class I or II nephritis from Study BEL114054  since patients with 
class I or II nephritis were not included. However, in  the pivotal SLE studies, where patients  with class I 
and II nephritis were eligible for inclusion, Benlysta was given to patients with  high  disease activity 
despite standard therapy. During the procedure, the MAH  agreed to revise the indication to specify that 
Benlysta should only be given to patients  with active  nephritis,  and in  combination with background 
immunosuppressive therapy. 
In the pre-specified subgroup analysis of renal biopsy class, no or very limited increased efficacy was 
observed for belimumab compared to placebo for patients with  a pure membranous nephritis (class V). A 
trend for reduced risk of renal-related event or death was observed in this  subgroup. Hence, the CHMP 
agreed that  class V can be included in the indication.  Furthermore, the efficacy was most prominent in 
patients treated with  background MMF than  CYC. The results in these important pre-specified subgroups 
are clearly reflected in section 5.1  of the  SmPC. 
The safety data presented from study BEL114054  is overall consistent with  the known safety profile of 
Benlysta, with  an increased risk for infections and fatal infections. The incidence of deaths in  BEL114054 
was higher (2.2% placebo and 2.7%  belimumab) compared to the  incidence observed in the pooled SLE 
studies (0.4%  placebo, 0.6% belimumab). The targeted LN population is more fragile than the  overall SLE 
population due to severe organ involvement and concomitant heavy immunosuppression. However, given 
the high unmet  medical need in the LN  patient population at  an increased risk for organ failure and death, 
the safety profile in the LN  patients is found acceptable to  the CHMP.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
There is a high unmet medical need for new treatments in patients with  LN.   
The results from study BEL114054  show a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect for 
belimumab when it comes to  primary and all major secondary endpoints. The efficacy was demonstrated 
when Benlysta is used in combination with  background immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of 
adult patients  with  active lupus nephritis and was most prominent in the subgroup of patients treated 
with  background MMF,  and in patients  with  histopathological class III/IV nephritis. 
The safety in the current population shows the same pattern as the  known safety profile of Benlysta, but 
with  an increased risk for death than  compared to the overall SLE population. This is expected in the 
fragile LN  population with  severe organ involvement and heavy concomitant immunosuppression. 
Exposure comparisons between IV dosing and SC dosing based on simulations  from population PK models 
are the justification  for the  change of the SC posology for the treatment  of LN  patients.  The benefit-risk 
balance for the 400 mg Q1W to  week 4 followed by 200  mg Q2W posology is considered unchanged 
compared to the 10  mg/kg IV posology since the average concentration is comparable between SC and IV 
dosing. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The adequacy of a separate, LN  indication which is a severe manifestation of SLE was questioned during 
the assessment since Benlysta is already approved in the treatment of SLE patients while considering the 
CHMP´s  principles of wording of the indication (EMA/CHMP/483022/2019)  foreseeing that if a study 
population is already covered by the already approved indication, an extension of the indication  in section 
4.1 of the SmPC is not  accepted. However, the current indication for SLE,  ”Benlysta is indicated as add-on 
therapy in  patients aged 5 years and older with  active, autoantibody-positive systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) with  a high degree of disease activity (e.g., positive anti-  dsDNA and low 
complement) despite standard therapy  (see section 5.1)”  does not apply to LN,  since in LN,  Benlysta is 
indicated for use as first-line therapy  in combination with intensive immunosuppressants. Thus, 
due to the different places in therapy for Benlysta in SLE and LN respectively, a separate LN indication  is 
agreed by CHMP. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Benlysta is positive in the following indication: 
Benlysta is indicated in combination with  background immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of 
adult patients  with  active lupus nephritis (see sections 4.2  and 5.1).

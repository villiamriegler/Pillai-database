SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1. 
Introduction 
Chronic  myelogenous  leukaemia  (CML)  is  one  of  several  chronic  myeloproliferative  diseases,  a 
family of clonal disorders of pluripotential hematopoetic stem cells in the marrow. CML has a yearly 
incidence of 1 in 100 000 in Western countries and its frequency increases steadily with age (Greer JP 
2004). It is uncommon in children and accounts for less than 5 % of all childhood leukemias (Rowe 
and Lichtman 1984). In the population, men are affected more than women (3:2) (Moloney 1977).  
A reciprocal chromosome translocation t(9;22), in which the ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 
is  translocated  near  the  BCR  gene  on  chromosome  22,  is  the  main  cause  of  CML.  This  genetic 
alteration,  called  the  Philadelphia  chromosome  (Ph),  results  in  the  formation  of  a  chimeric  fusion 
protein,  BCR-ABL  (Rowley  1973;  Ren  2005).  The  presence  of  the  Ph  chromosome  results  in  an 
uncontrolled  protein  phosphorylation  of  BCR-ABL,  rendering  it  constitutively  activated.  The  BCR-
ABL fusion protein is present in more than 90% of CML patients. 
CML is characterized by an overproduction of immature myeloid cells and mature granulocytes in the 
spleen,  bone  marrow  and  peripheral  blood.  These  cells  have  few,  if  any,  morphologic  or  functional 
abnormalities. However, if untreated CML progresses and may lead to a disorder associated with bone 
marrow failure or transformation to acute leukaemia. There are three phases of the disease: a chronic 
phase (CP), an accelerated phase (AP) and the blast crisis phase (BC). From an initial CP of 4-6 years, 
CML progresses into the AP marked by the presence of primitive blast cells in the bone marrow and 
peripheral  blood.  Finally,  the  terminal  BC  phase  is  characterized  by  the  presence  of  over  30%  of 
undifferentiated  blasts  in  the  bone  marrow  and  peripheral  blood  (Kantarjian  and  Talpaz  1988). 
Usually, patients in the BC phase have a median survival of 18 weeks.  
The BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Glivec) is now the treatment of choice for CML. A high 
percentage  (89%)  of  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  CML  are  alive  after  five  years  of  therapy  with 
imatinib  (Druker,  Guilhot  et  al.  2006)  and  the  median  survival  of  patients  with  AP  CML  is  42.6 
months  (Silver  2004).  The  annual  rate  of  progression  to  AP/BC  ranges  from  1.5%  in  the  first  year, 
2.8% in the second year to 0.6% in the fifth year in newly diagnosed patients (Druker, Guilhot et al. 
2006).  In  patients  with  AP,  the  estimated  rate  of  progression  is  73% at  4  years  (Silver  2004).  All 
patients with BC will ultimately progress and die of their disease. 
Nilotinib was developed as a second-generation inhibitor of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase that would be 
effective  in  patients  with  imatinib-resistant  or  -intolerant  CML.  Imatinib  resistance  results  from  the 
emergence of point mutations within the kinase domain of BCR-ABL that reduce the binding affinity 
of  the  drug  (Cowan-Jacob,  Guez  et  al.  2004;  Hochhaus  and  La  Rosee  2004).  Currently,  the  only 
therapy for these patients is dasatinib (Sprycel), a drug recently approved in Europe and US. 
Other non-targeted therapeutic options for the management of these patients include hydroxyurea, low 
dose  Ara-C,  IFN-α,  and  multi-agent  chemotherapy  (usually  for  advanced  phases  of  the  disease). 
Ultimately, bone marrow transplantation is the most effective therapy for these patients, but its use is 
limited to young patients who have a suitable donor and can cope with significant toxicities.  
About the product 
Nilotinib,  a  synthetic  aminopyrimidine,  is  an  ATP-competitive  inhibitor  for  BCR-ABL.  Nilotinib  is 
highly selective for BCR-ABL, binding to wild-type BCR-ABL with 20 times the affinity of imatinib, 
and has in vitro activity against many imatinib-resistant mutants. Nilotinib also has increased potency 
as compared to imatinib, giving it a broader spectrum of activity against BCR-ABL in vitro against all 
but  the  T315I  mutation  (also  demonstrates  resistance  to  other  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors).  This  is 
expected to result in a clinical benefit for CML-CP and CML-AP patients that are imatinib-resistant or 
-intolerant.

Nilotinib 
2.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Nilotinib  has  been  formulated  as  200  mg  hard  capsules  for  oral  administration  in  the  treatment  of 
chronic  phase  and  accelerated  phase  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  chronic  myelogenous 
leukemia in patients resistant to or intolerant of at least one prior therapy including imatinib.  
Active Substance 
The chemical name of nilotinib hydrochloride monohydrate is 4-methyl-N-[3-(4-methyl-1H-imidazol-
1-yI)-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-[(4-pyridin-3-ylpyrimidin-2-yl)amino]benzamide 
hydrochloride 
monohydrate, and corresponds to the molecular formula: C28H22F3N7O·HCl·H2O. It does not contain a 
chiral  centre  and  no  tautomerism  is  possible.  The  molecular  mass  is  583.99  (as  monohydrate)  and 
565.98  (as  anhydrate).    It  appears  as  a  white  to  slightly  yellowish  or  slightly  greenish  yellowish 
powder. 
The solubility of nilotinib hydrochloride monohydrate in aqueous solutions at 25°C strongly decreases 
with increasing pH, and it is practically insoluble in buffer solutions of pH 4.5 and higher pH values. 
Nilotinib is sparingly soluble in ethanol and methanol. 
The pKa1 for nilotinib hydrochloride monohydrate is 2.1, and pKa2 is around 5.4. 
The  distribution  coefficient  (D)  for  nilotinib  hydrochloride  monohydrate  in  n-octanol  /  0.1  N  HCl 
buffer at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C was determined to be 0.08, and the corresponding Log D -1.1. 
The active substance has no asymmetric carbons and is, consequently, not optically active. 
Several crystal hydrates and solvates of nilotinib hydrochloride monohydrate have been found to date. 
The different crystalline Forms A, B, C and amorphous have been characterized. Form A corresponds 
to  a  dihydrate  form.  Form  B  and  Form  C  are  monohydrate  forms  obtained  after  desolvation  of 
different solvates.  
Form B, isolated from the synthetic process and used in the medicinal product, is the most stable form. 
It  shows  the  least  hygroscopic  behaviour  of  all  the  three  crystalline  forms  A,  B,  and  C.  No 
transformation  was  observed  after  storing  these  three  forms  at  room  temperature  even  for  several 
months. 
•  Manufacture 
The  procedure  for  the  manufacture  of  nilotinib  hydrochloride  monohydrate  involves  four  synthetic 
transformations and one sieving step. Reprocessing may take place according to the above procedure, 
starting at an appropriate stage. 
Altogether  thirty  nine  batches  of  the  nilotinib  active  substance  have  been  manufactured  during 
development  and  launch.  Following  the  production  of  the  first  batch,  manufacturing  has  been 
transferred to a different site where slight modifications to the synthesis were implemented. 
The particle size of the sieved active substance is routinely determined by laser light diffraction. The 
current  particle  size  requirements  for  nilotinib  hydrochloride  monohydrate  were  set,  basically,  on 
technological considerations.

The  process  validation  results  show  that  manufacturing  process  is  reproducible  and  well  controlled 
within the pre-determined manufacturing acceptance criteria. 
•  Specification 
The  specification  for  the  control  of  the  active  substance  includes  tests  for  Appearance  (visual 
examination),  Particle  size  (laser  light  diffraction),  Clarity  and  Colour  of  the  solution  (Ph.  Eur.), 
Identity  (IR,  X-ray  diffraction),  Impurities  (HPLC),  Residual  solvents  (GC),  Water  (Karl  Fischer) 
Sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), Heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), Microbial limit test (Ph. Eur.), Assay of salt forming 
agent (potentiometric titration) and Assay (HPLC). 
Two  different  HPLC  methods  have  been  developed  and  are  utilised  for  the  determination  of  the 
impurities. One of these methods is also used for the Assay test.  
The batch analysis results from 39 batches manufactured by the commercial process indicate that the 
manufacturing process is under control. 
•  Stability 
3  pilot  batches  manufactured  by  the  commercial  process  have  been  stored  at  -20°C,  5°C, 
25°C/60%RH, 30°C/65%RH for 12 months and at 40°C/75%RH for 6 months in the proposed market 
packaging. Due to the slight hygroscopicity and the slight hydrolysis of the active substance observed, 
appropriate  packaging  allowing  minimal  water  permeation  is  necessary  for  Nilotinib  hydrochloride 
monohydrate. 
Comparative stability tests for up to 6 months have been performed between two packaging materials 
at  different  conditions.  Both  packaging  options  can  be  used  for  the  commercial  active  substance. 
Additional packaging materials such (for stress testing) have also been tested. The stability studies are 
planned to continue up to 60 months at -20°C, 5°C and 25°C/60% RH. 
No  significant  changes  are  observed  at  ICH  conditions  when  stored  in  the  proposed  packaging 
materials.  All  quality  parameters  tested  comply  with  the  requirements  after  storage  of  the  active 
substance at the given storage conditions. 
Stress testing (solid state, forced decomposition and hygroscopicity) and photostability in accordance 
with ICH conditions have also been performed at different conditions.  
After  1  month  storage  all  quality  parameters  tested  comply  with  the  requirements  regardless  of  the 
storage conditions. Some changes related to water content and to hydrolysis to different extents were 
observed. However, this observation is in agreement with other stability findings that dictated the use 
of packaging material with very low water permeability.  
The  results  from  photostability  studies  did  not  show  significant  change  in  stability  indicating 
parameters. The active substance is considered slightly light sensitive. 
In conclusion, the stability data provided indicate that the active substance remain stable at different 
storage conditions and support the proposed retest period and storage conditions. 
Medicinal Product 
•  Pharmaceutical Development 
The  objective  of  the  development  was  to  develop  an  immediate  release  solid  dosage  form  for  oral 
administration by taking the following prerequisites into account: 
•  High dose to be administered (maximum daily dose = 1200 mg of active substance) 
•  Active substance is slightly soluble at pH 1 but practically insoluble at pH 6.8 
•  Tendency of active substance to agglomeration and electrostatic behaviour, low bulk density 
of active substance 
From  the  existing  polymorphic  forms,  form  B,  a  monohydrate  form  of  nilotinib  hydrochloride,  has 
been selected for development and has been used over the toxicity and clinical program. It shows least 
hygroscopic behaviour among the existing crystalline forms. In development of the active substance 
no transformation of the polymorphic form has been observed. 
Nilotinib  hydrochloride  monohydrate  is  characterized  as  a  Class  IV  compound  (low  /  moderate 
aqueous  solubility  and  low  permeability)  according  to  the  Biopharmaceutical  Classification  System 
(BCS).

The impact of the particle size on the drug release kinetics has been assessed by testing the dissolution 
rate of product manufactured with active substance of different particle sizes. It could be observed that 
the  particle  size  has  no  impact  on  the  dissolution  characteristics  of  the  medicinal  product. Based  on 
these results the limits for particle size were set on technological considerations only, i.e. to limit the 
amount of coarse particles of the active substance and thus to ensure an appropriate content uniformity 
of the medicinal product and to control the electrostatic behaviour of the active substance resulting in 
acceptable  flow  properties  of  the  final  blend.  The  particle  size  of  the  sieved  active  substance  is 
routinely determined by laser light diffraction. 
Appropriate compatibility studies have been carried out and it was shown that nilotinib is compatible 
with all the excipients tested. The finally selected excipients are commonly used for solid oral dosage 
forms and in compliance with internationally accepted pharmacopoeial standards. There are no known 
excipient-excipient incompatibilities among the chosen excipients. 
Considering  the  high  amount  of  active  substance  per  dosage  unit  and  its  physical  characteristics 
(tendency  to  agglomeration  and  electrostatic  behaviour,  low  bulk  density),  aqueous  granulation  was 
the  method  of  choice  for  the  manufacture  of  the  capsule  fill  mass  to  allow  the  use  of  an  acceptable 
capsule size for the selected dosage strength of 200 mg.  
Differences between the clinical formulation and the formulation to be marketed were discussed and 
the biopharmaceutical equivalence appropriately demonstrated 
•  Adventitious Agents 
Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. Lactose monohydrate and gelatin in the capsule shells are 
of animal origin. 
Lactose  monohydrate  is  of  pharmaceutical  grade  derived  from  bovine  milk  sourced  from  healthy 
animals and under the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption as per the relevant 
EU Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of 22 May 2001.  
For the gelatin in the capsules valid CEPs have been presented.  
•  Manufacture of the Product 
The  manufacturing  process  of  Tasigna  is  a  standard  process  including  aqueous  wet  granulation, 
drying,  screening,  mixing  and  encapsulation.  Therefore  manufacturing  process  development  was 
focused on the evaluation of critical process parameters. 
The  applicable  process  parameters  were  established  based  on  the  experiments  performed  during 
laboratory,  pilot  and  pre-validation  phases.  The  data  gathered  during  process  validation  and  the 
provided batch analyses demonstrates that the manufacturing process of Tasigna 200 mg hard capsules 
is  robust  and  consistently  yields  medicinal  product,  which  meets  the  predetermined  quality 
characteristics.  The  chosen  in-process  controls  have  been  shown  to  be  suitable  for  monitoring  the 
manufacturing process. 
•  Product Specification 
The  specification  for  batch  release  and  shelf-life  include  the  following  tests:  Appearance  (visual 
examination),  Identification  (UV  and  HPLC),  Mean  mass  of  the  capsule  content  (weighing)  , 
Dissolution (Ph.Eur.), Impurities (HPLC), Microbial limit tests (Ph.Eur.), Uniformity of dosage units 
(Ph.  Eur.),  Assay  (HPLC).  Two  different  HPLC  methods  are  applied  for  the  determination  of  the 
impurities. 
Batch  analyses  for  nine  batches,  manufactured  by  the  commercial  manufacturing  chain,  have  been 
provided.  All  results  meet  the  specifications  and  provide  evidence  that  the  quality  of  the  finished 
product  is properly  controlled  by the  analytical  methods  and  the  set  specifications.  In  addition,  they 
demonstrate the reproducibility of the manufacturing process for the medicinal product. 
•  Stability of the Product 
Three pilot batches and three full scale production batches have been put into stability study. The six 
batches have been manufactured at the commercial facilities to the final commercial process. 
All batches have been placed on long term testing at 25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75% RH, accelerated 
testing  at  40°C/75%  RH,  as  well  as  testing  at  other  temperatures  (e.g.  -20°C,  5°C  and  50°C)  and 
special tests (e.g. photostability and microbial limit tests). 
Up to 12 months of stability data for the pilot batches and up to 6 months for the full scale production 
batches  are  presented  in  this  application.  Batches  stored  in  the  three  different  blister  packaging  but 
©EMEA 2007

data  were  presented  only  for  two  of  them.  Parameters  investigated:  Assay,  degradation  products, 
appearance, mean mass, dissolution and microbiological purity.  
All results met the requirements at long term storage conditions (25°C/60% RH and 30°C/75% RH). 
Some gelatin shell cross linking was observed which was always reversible after addition of pepsin to 
the dissolution medium as recommended according to USP. 
At  accelerated  storage  conditions  gelatin  shell  cross  linking  was  also  observed.  For  some  samples 
cross  linking  could  not  be  reversed  by  addition  of  pepsin  and  thus  did  not  comply  with  the 
specifications.  
The cross linking of the gelatin shell (i.e. formation of water insoluble membrane during dissolution 
acting as a barrier restricting drug release) is a well known phenomenon observed when hard gelatin 
capsules  are  stressed  by  high  temperature  and  humidity.  The  proposed  shelf-life  and  storage 
conditions take these findings into account. 
No change for the chemical results has been observed over 3 months at 50°C. Regarding the physical 
data, no change has been observed for the appearance and the mean mass. 
Two  batches  have  been  tested  for  6  months  at  -20°C  and  no  change  has  occurred  except  the 
observation of a gelatin shell cross linking.  
In both cases gelatin shell cross linking was observed. However, after the use of dissolution medium 
with pepsin, the results complied with the requirements in all cases. 
The photo stability test conducted at two batches on unprotected capsules (1200 kluxh) demonstrates 
that the capsules are only very slight sensitive to light. No changes have been observed. 
Based on the stability data obtained and their statistical evaluation the proposed shelf-life and storage 
condition are accepted.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The  quality  of  Tasigna  hard  capsules  is  adequately  established.  In  general,  sufficient  chemical  and 
pharmaceutical  documentation  relating  to  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active 
substance and medicinal product has been presented. There are no major deviations from EU and ICH 
requirements. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity of all the 
important product quality characteristics. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of 
minor  unresolved  quality  issues  having  no  impact  on  the  Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  the  product.  The 
applicant  submitted  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  dated  on  19  September  2007  and  committed  to  resolve 
these as Follow-Up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed timeframe. 
It can be safely concluded that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the 
clinic.  
Stability tests indicate that the product under ICH guidelines conditions is chemically stable for the 
proposed shelf life. 
3.  Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Pivotal non-clinical studies were claimed by the applicant to be conducted in compliance with GLP-
regulations.  In  vitro  safety  pharmacology  and  the  mutagenicity  studies  for  the  genotoxic  impurities 
540-04 and 371-03 were not GLP-compliant. 
Pharmacology 
Test systems for in vitro studies were based on human cancer cell lines or transfected cell lines of 
different, mostly murine, origin constitutively expressing different types of ligand-dependent tyrosine 
kinases. Phosphorylation rates could be detected using ELISA techniques and intracellular ATP-
concentrations were taken as a marker for cell viability. For the in vivo studies CML was modelled 
using orthotopic mouse systems where haematopoietic or bone marrow cells were retrovirally 
©EMEA 2007 
5/52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transduced to carry the human BCR-ABL gene, and either injected intravenously into athymic mice 
(acute model) or transplanted into the bone marrow of syngeneic mice (chronic model). 
•  Primary pharmacodynamics 
Nilotinib inhibited native BCR-ABL auto-phosphorylation in cell lines derived from human 
Philadelphia-positive in CML cells (K-562, KU812F) and from transfected murine haematopoietic 
cells (32D, Ba/F3), with IC50 values ranging between 20 to 60 nM. Cells that did not express the 
BCR-ABL  were resistant to nilotinib below 2 µM. Nilotinib was active against many mutant forms of 
BCR-ABL that proved resistant against imatinib (M237I, M244V, L248V, G250A/E/V, Q252H, 
E255D, E275K, E276G, E281K, E292K, F311V, F317C/L/V, D325N, S348L, M351T, E355A/G, 
A380S, M388L, F486S) with IC50 values in the range of 30 - 150 nM. Y253H, E255K/R/V, K285N, 
F359C/V and L387F mutants were less sensitive to nilotinib with IC50 values of 150 - 390 nM, while 
T351I was resistant up to below 10,000 nM. Using the same cell lines nilotinib inhibited viability and 
proliferation with IC50 values ranging from 8 to 24 nM. In summary, nilotinib inhibited 
autophosphorylation and proliferation of 33 out of 34 BCR-ABL mutants with IC50 values in the 
concentration range of 20 to 800 nM. 
The in vivo efficacy of nilotinib was investigated in athymic nude mice i.v. injected with 32D tumour 
cells, stably transfected with native BCR-ABL (acute model). Tumour growth was measured using a 
non-invasive imaging system. Following oral administration of either q.d. (18, 45 or 68 mg/kg) or 
b.i.d. (10, 20 or 30 mg/kg) nilotinib reduced disease burden in a dose-dependent manner. Tumour 
stasis was observed at 45 mg/kg q.d. and 30 mg/kg b.i.d. Similar anti-tumour efficacy and toxicity (in 
the form of body weight changes) were obtained with the q.d. and b.i.d. treatment regimens. Following 
b.i.d. 30 mg/kg treatment for 14 days, nilotinib plasma concentrations were 62, 41, 4.4 µM at 1, 6 and 
12 hours following dosing. 
To determine if nilotinib treatment would be able to prolonged survival, 75 mg/kg/day nilotinib was 
orally administered to a larger cohort of mice over a 16-day period, commencing three days after 
injection of the tumour 32D cells stably transfected with native BCR-ABL (chronic model) (Weisberg, 
Manley et al. 2005). Vehicle-treated animals (19/20) developed a lethal disease with a median survival 
of 16 days whereas nilotinib treatment resulted in survival of 15/20 animals when observed over a 105 
day observation period.  
The effects of nilotinib on survival were also evaluated in a bone marrow transplant model, where 
bone marrow cells from normal balb-c mice were transduced with BCR-ABL and transferred to mice. 
Prolonged survival was observed in animals treated p.o. with either imatinib (125 mg/kg/day) or 
nilotinib (75 mg/kg/day). Vehicle-treated animals exhibited splenomegaly and marked leukocytosis 
and were sacrificed on day 18 post-transplantation, whereas imatinib and nilotinib-treated animals all 
were alive at the study end point, 20 days after transplantation. Nilotinib decreased the spleen weight 
(tumour burden) relative to both vehicle and imatinib-treated animals. Similarly, nilotinib (75 
mg/kg/day, p.o.) prolonged survival in the presence of the BCR-ABL mutant E255V and M351T 
BCR-ABL mutant (Weisberg, Manley et al. 2005). 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
The kinase inhibition profile of nilotinib was evaluated in a panel of cell lines expressing a selection of 
tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinases. Several important targets were identified. Nilotinib 
inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the PDGF-R with an IC50 of 69 nM. This translates into potent 
inhibition of PDGF-Rα and PDGF-Rβ-dependent cell proliferation with IC50 values of 2.5-11 nM and 
53 nM in Ba/F3 cells, respectively. In a TEL-PDGFRβ mouse model of chronic myelomonocytic 
leukaemia (CMML), nilotinib administered by gavage at 75 mg/kg/day q.d. significantly prolonged 
the survival of animals compared to vehicle-treated controls. Furthermore, nilotinib (75 mg/kg/day 
q.d.) also significantly prolonged animal survival in the FIP1-L1-PDGFRα model of hypereosinophilic 
syndrome (HES). 
In addition, nilotinib was able to potently reduced mutant c-Kit autophosphorylation in GIST cells 
with a mean IC50 of 210 nM. Consistent with these effects nilotinib strongly inhibited c-Kit 
dependent cell proliferation. Nilotinib was also a potent inhibitor of the ABL-related tyrosine kinase 
Arg and it has recently been reported that it inhibits the kinase domain activity of the ephrin receptors, 
EphB1, EphB2 and EphB4, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (Melnick, Janes et al. 2006). 
©EMEA 2007

Nilotinib did not significantly inhibit (IC50>3 µM) the kinase autophosphorylation and/or cell 
proliferation of cells expressing any other tested kinases including VEGFR2, EGFR, erbB2, FLT3, 
Ret, c-Met, c-Src, PKA, PKB, IGF-1R, Insulin receptor, FGF, JAK2, Ras, NPM-Alk, Akt, Pim2. 
When evaluated in a kinase activity assay, nilotinib was a weak inhibitor of c-Raf-1 (1.2 µM), p38 (1.7 
µM), B-Raf-V599E (5.1 µM), Tek/Tie-2 (3.3 µM), KDR/VEGFR-2 (5.3 µM) and c-Src (3.7 µM), and 
remained inactive (IC50 > 10 µM) against a panel of  34 other kinases. 
Nilotinib  was  assessed  against  a  panel  of  79  different  receptors,  ion  channels,  transporters  and 
enzymes  by  competitive  binding  assay.  Significant  activity  was  found  only  against  the  human 
recombinant  adenosine  receptor  Ad3  and  the  human  adenosine  transporter  ENT1  (AdT)  with  Ki 
values of 3.2 µM and 1.1 µM, respectively.

2. CNS and respiratory effects 
The  risk  for  adverse  effects  on  the  CNS  and  the  respiratory  system  was  evaluated  following  single-
dose p.o. administration of nilotinib to male rats (n=10). The animals were evaluated up to 24 hours 
post-dose. One animal died prematurely during the study, however the cause of death was considered 
associated  to  the  route  of  administration.  No  treatment-related  effects  were  observed  on  the  CNS 
functions  following  administration  of  300  mg/kg  nilotinib.  Likewise,  nilotinib  administration  (30  or

300  mg/kg)  had  no  effect  on  respiratory  functions  when  evaluated  using  whole  body 
plethysmography.  
•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted. 
Pharmacokinetics 
A variety of in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies were performed. Plasma, serum and tissue 
concentrations of nilotinib were determined in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys using validated 
high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods coupled to liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS) or radioactivity detection. Plasma protein binding studies used the active 
substance with 3H label, and tissue distribution studies were conducted with 14C-nilotinib. Limits of 
quantification in plasma were 2.5 ng/mL (except for rats that were 10 ng/mL). 
•  Absorption-Bioavailability 
The absorption of nilotinib following a single administration was evaluated in mice, rats, rabbits and 
monkeys. The results are summarised in Table 2.

Repeated-dose administration of nilotinib to monkeys resulted in a less-than-proportional increase in 
exposure, as estimated by the AUC, after both single and multiple oral doses. After multiple doses, the 
inter-animal  variability  was  generally  much  greater  than  after  a  single  dose.  Evidence  of  plasma 
accumulation  (up  to  5-fold)  was  observed  following  repeated  dosing.  No  gender  differences  were 
observed  with  respect  to  peak  concentration  or  plasma  exposure  in  monkeys.  After  repeated  oral 
administration to rats, exposure to nilotinib was generally higher in female rats compared to male rats. 
An increase in dose resulted in a generally proportional increase in exposure after single and multiple 
doses in male and female rats. 
•  Distribution 
Radioactivity tissue distribution was investigated by quantitative whole-body autoradiography in rats 
following a single p.o. dose of  14C-nilotinib. Maximal tissue concentrations were generally observed 
between  2  and  6  hours  following  14C-nilotinib  administration  and  radioactivity  was  higher  in  the 
majority of tissues than in the blood. The highest tissue-to-blood ratios were observed in the adrenal 
cortex (8-9), liver (8-11), uveal tract (8-19) and small intestine (14-40). Substantial radioactivity was 
detected in the bile. There was minimal passage to the central nervous system with tissue:blood ratios 
for  brain  and  spinal  cord  of  0.06  and  0.05  respectively.  Ratio  for  testis  was  0.12.  At  the  final  time 
point  (168  hours),  radioactivity  could  still  be  detected  in  the  aorta  wall,  liver,  lung,  skin  and  uveal 
tract. Nilotinib displayed affinity towards pigmented skin (melanin). 
Following a single 20 mg/kg oral dose of 14C-nilotinib in pregnant rats, the highest tissue-to-maternal 
blood  concentration  ratios  (2  to  10)  were  observed  in  the  maternal  liver,  kidney,  uterus,  heart,  and

amnion.  The  foetus-to-maternal  blood  ratio  at  day  10  gestation  was  1.5-2.3  (24  h  time  period  post 
dose).  Foetal  tissue  concentrations  at  gestation  day  17  were  all  below  those  observed  in  maternal 
blood except 1.6-fold higher in the foetal liver. In pregnant rabbits after oral daily nilotinib dosing, the 
nilotinib concentration in all foetuses for the dose groups of 30 and 100 mg/kg was below the lower 
limit of quantification. The mean nilotinib concentration in foetuses in the 300 mg/kg group was 29.8 
ng/g  tissue,  while  the  mean  maternal  serum  concentration  was  372  ng/mL.  The  relative  exposure 
(foetus-to-maternal serum ratio) was estimated at approximately 8%. 
Following  an  oral  dose  (20  mg/kg)  of  14C-nilotinib  in  lactating  rats,  the  overall  milk:plasma 
concentration  ratio  was  ~2  based  on  AUC0-∞  values.  Unchanged  nilotinib  was  present  at  higher 
concentrations in rat milk compared to that observed in plasma. There were no metabolites detected 
that were unique to rat milk. 
The  average  nilotinib  plasma  protein  binding  was  97.4%,  99.1%,  98.2%,  99.0%  and  98.4%  in  the 
mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human, respectively. The nilotinib blood-to-plasma concentration ratios 
were less than one in mice (0.84), rats (0.79), dogs (0.83), monkeys (0.81) and humans (0.68). Heparin 
did not affect the protein binding of nilotinib in human plasma. Nilotinib is also highly bound (93.4 to 
93.9%) to human serum albumin and to α-1 acid glycoprotein (in vitro). 
•  Metabolism 
The metabolism of  3H-nilotinib was investigated in vitro using rat, dog, monkey, human liver slices 
and  human  hepatocytes.  The  metabolic  reactions  involved  oxidation  of  the  methyl-imidazole  ring, 
degradation  of  the  oxidized  imidazole,  oxidation  of  the  pyridinyl-pyrimidinyl-amino-methyl-
benzamide  moiety,  amide  hydrolysis,  glucuronic  acid  conjugation  with  parent  compound  or 
metabolites,  and  various  combinations  of  the  above  reactions.  The  rates  of  test  substance 
disappearance at a concentration of 0.7 µM [3H] nilotinib were comparable in all test matrices ranging 
from  0.89  to 2.7  pmol/h/mg  in  wet  tissue  (slices)  and  approximately  2.7  pmol/h/mg  in  liver  and    in 
human  hepatocytes  (3.3  pmol/h/105  cells).  All  of  the  major  metabolites  found  in  human  liver  slices 
were also detected in rat or monkey liver slices. 
Biotransformation of nilotinib was investigated in vivo in mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey, and human. The 
metabolism of nilotinib was extensive and a total of 74 different nilotinib metabolites were detected in 
plasma, urine and faeces. Unchanged nilotinib was the predominant component in plasma (one hour 
following i.v. and p.o.). In all the animal species the amount of nilotinib excreted as unchanged drug 
into the faeces ranged from 18.3% of the dose in the mouse to 57.8% of the dose in monkeys. There 
were more than thirty metabolites detected in the faeces, however, none contributed greater than 5% of 
the excreted dose with the majority contributing less than 2% each. Additional metabolites found were 
unique to rat, all present at levels of less than 3% of the dose.  
In humans, unchanged nilotinib was the main circulating component in human serum, accounting for 
88% of the AUC0-48h. The two metabolites present at the highest levels in human serum were P36.5 
and P41.6 with AUC0-48h values of 6.9% and 5.3% relative to the unchanged drug. These metabolites 
are  formed  by  a  common  biotransformation  pathway,  where  the  methyl  group  in  the  methyl-
midazolam  moiety  of  nilotinib  is  initially  hydroxyl  Ted  (P41.6)  and  then  further  oxidized  to  a 
carboxylic  acid  (P36.5).  Additional  metabolic  pathways  observed  in  humans  included  hydroxylation 
of  the  methyl  group  in  the  amino-methyl-benzamide  moiety  (P42.1),  N-oxide  formation  on  the 
pyridine nitrogen (P36), oxidative/ hydrolytic degradation of the midazolam ring leading to multiple 
products,  oxygenation  of 
the  pyridinyl-pyrimidinyl-tolyl-amine  and  methyl-phenyl-imidazole 
moieties, and cleavage of the amide linkage (P20). P36 and P42.1 were found in human serum with 
AUC0-48h  values  of  0.58%  and  1.5%  relative  to  unchanged  drug.  Combinations  of  these  primary 
biotransformation pathways lead to the observation of twenty distinct human metabolites of nilotinib. 
There were numerous metabolites observed in the animal species investigated that were not detected 
in human. All of the metabolites identified in humans were also detected in one or more of the animal 
species tested, with the exception of the two minor faecal metabolites (P38 and P40, mono and di-
oxygenated nilotinib respectively), which each accounted for ≤ 1.2% of the dose. With respect to 
plasma metabolites, higher percentages of total AUC were observed in human metabolites P36.5 and 
P41.6 than in the animal species.

•  Excretion 
Radiolabelled nilotinib was predominantly excreted via faeces following both i.v. and oral 
administration (see Table 3). An i.v. excretion study in bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats revealed that 
the faecal excretion (94.2% of the dose) was the result of both biliary (72.4% of the dose) and GI 
secretion routes (21.8% of the dose).

CYP enzyme inhibition and induction 
When tested at concentrations of up to 100 µM in human liver microsomes, nilotinib showed little or 
no inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 enzymes and a moderate inhibition of CYP2C19 (Ki of 3.82 
µM) and CYP2D6 (Ki  of 1.46 µM). More potent inhibition was observed for CYP2C9 (Ki of 0.132 
µM),  CYP3A4/5  (Ki of  0.448  µM)  and  CYP2C8  (Ki  of  0.236  µM).  Nilotinib  also  acted  as  a  partial 
inhibitor for CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5, and it was a fully competitive inhibitor of 
CYP2C19 activity. 
Kinetic  experiments  performed  with  pooled  human  liver  microsomes  and  recombinant  human  CYP 
enzymes showed that CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 are expected to be the main contributors to the oxidative 
metabolism  of  nilotinib  in  humans  (CLint,CYP2C8  ≈  24%  of  CLint,CYP3A4).  CYP3A4  and  CYP3A5 
demonstrated the highest nilotinib turnover followed by CYP2C8, CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1. 
Co-incubation  with  the  CYP3A4  inhibitors  ketoconazole  and  troleandomycin  reduced  nilotinib 
oxidative metabolism by >95%, with apparent IC50 values of 0.012 and 1.2 µM respectively. Minimal 
inhibition  was  observed  with  furafylline  (CYP1A2),  quercetin  (CYP2C8/3A4)  or  paclitaxal 
(CYP2C8/3A4).  Furthermore,  in  a  clinical  study  in  which  26  healthy  subjects  were  administered  a 
single 200 mg oral dose of nilotinib on day 4 plus ketoconazole on days 1-6, a three-fold increase in 
the nilotinib serum AUC was observed. 
Nilotinib (up to 10 µM) was examined for its potential to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes activities 
in primary human hepatocytes of three individual donors after 72 h of treatment. The results indicate 
that  nilotinib  can  be  considered  to  be  an  in  vitro  inducer  of  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  and  CYP2C9 
activities. Induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA levels and activity constituted less than 40% of 
the  positive  control  level.  UGT1A1  mRNA  levels  were  approximately  within  40%  of  the  positive 
controls.  In  addition,  there  was  no  observed  induction  of  CYP2C19,  ABCB1  (Pgp)  or  ABCC2 
(Multidrug resistance-related protein 2, MRP2) mRNA levels.

Inhibition of transporters 
The IC50 value for inhibition of the Pgp mediated efflux of Rho123 by nilotinib was 1.7 ± 0.11 µM, 
representing  an  inhibition  of  33%,  compared  to  the  positive  control  10  µM  cyclosporine.  The 
permeability  of  nilotinib  (6  µM)  across  confluent  Caco-2  cell  monolayers  ranged  between  an  efflux 
ratio of 3.9-4.1 (determined by dividing the permeability in the basolateral to apical direction by the 
permeability in the apical to basolateral direction). In the presence of the Pgp inhibitor PSC833, the 
nilotinib efflux ratio was reduced to near unity (0.80-1.2). However, no effect on the nilotinib efflux 
ratio  was  observed  in  the  presence  of  the  MRP  inhibitor  MK571.  The  intrinsic  permeability  of 
nilotinib (6 µM), estimated from the average permeability values for transport in either direction in the 
presence of sufficient levels of PSC833 was moderate. 
UGT1A1 inhibition 
Nilotinib  was  a  potent  in  vitro  inhibitor  of  human  uridine  diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase  1A1 
(UGT1A1) at clinically relevant concentrations, with an estimated Ki value of 0.19 µM.  
Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
• 
Intravenous  single-dose  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  in  rats  (see  Table  4).  The  following 
investigations  were  performed:  mortality,  clinical  signs,  body  weight,  food  consumption, 
haematology,  clinical  biochemistry,  toxicokinetics  measurements,  organ  weights,  macroscopy  and 
microscopy.  A  15-day  observation  period  following  dosing  was  included  in  the  study.  The  no-
observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for the intravenous administration study was 9 mg/kg.

Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
• 
Repeated-dose toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. The pivotal studies 
were performed in rats (26-weeks) and monkeys (39-weeks). 
Nilotinib  caused  toxic  effects  in  animals  without  a  safety  margin  to  clinical  use  (based  on  plasma 
AUC).  Reductions  in  body  weight,  body  weight  gain  and  food  consumption  were  consistently 
observed and overt body weight reductions caused dose group termination in some cases. In addition, 
gastrointestinal  symptoms  in  the  form  of  alterations  of  faecal  character  and  bloody  faeces 
accompanied by abdominal pain (hunched appearance) were observed in monkeys receiving 200 and 
600  mg/kg  nilotinib,  respectively.  A  number  of  findings  related  to  hepatobiliary  toxicity  were  made 
following  repeated  administration  of  nilotinib.  Liver  weight  increases  were  observed  in  rats  (≥30 
mg/kg). Liver inflammation, bile stasis, bile inspissation and bile duct proliferation accompanied by 
increases  in  ALT  and  ALP  were  observed  in  dogs  at  ≥45  mg/kg.  Moreover,  increased  plasma 
cholesterol  levels  were  observed  in  all  species  tested  except  for  mice.  Bilirubinuria  and 
hyperbilirubinemia  was  observed  in  female  dogs  at  45  mg/kg  in  the  4-week  toxicity  study  and 
bilirubinuria was also seen in female dogs at 15 mg/kg. Findings in monkeys administered 30 mg/kg, 
consisted  of  mononuclear  cell  infiltration,  bile  duct  hyperplasia,  periportal  fibrosis.  Additional 
findings made at higher doses were sinusoidal cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy, cytoplasmic aggregation 
of  sinusoidal  cells,  enlarged  bile  duct  and  an  increase  in  ALT.  At  the  end  of  the  39-week  monkey 
study,  elevated  cholesterol  values  were  still  observed  in  the  600  mg/kg  recovery  female.  The  single 
600 mg/kg recovery male animal showed increased liver weight and altered liver histology that did not 
show evidence of recovery. Mild haematological changes were observed in mice (reduced red blood

cell counts together with reductions in haemoglobin), rats (increases total leukocyte counts, neutrophil 
counts,  lymphocyte  counts  and  monocyte  counts,  decreases  of  erythrocyte  counts,  haemoglobin 
concentrations,  and  haematocrit  values)  and  monkeys  (increases  in  platelet  counts,  decreases  in  red 
cell mass, prolongation in activated partial thromboplastin time APTT) at oral doses > 20 mg/kg for 
mice and rats and 200 mg/kg for monkeys. Furthermore, increased heart weight, adrenal weight and 
ovarian weight (including ovarian follicular or luteal cysts) were observed in nilotinib-treated rats. 
Toxicokinetics: 
Nilotinib was monitored in the large majority of repeat-dose toxicity studies. The animal:human 
exposure margins at NOAEL (safety margin) obtained from the repeat-dose toxicity studies are given 
in Table 5.

Genotoxicity 
• 
Nilotinib was not genotoxic in a standard battery of in vitro and in vivo studies. The genotoxic 
potential of nilotinib was assessed in gene mutations tests in bacteria (Ames test), chromosomal 
damage in human lymphocytes in vitro and in rat bone marrow following oral application. In addition, 
two non-pivotal studies were submitted: an Ames test and a comet assay for the detection of DNA 
single strand breaks in the mouse L5178Y cell line. The results of all studies were negative. 
• 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with nilotinib.

Reproduction Toxicity 
• 
All male and female fertility parameters were unaffected by treatment. Due to findings in the repeat-
dose toxicity studies, it cannot be fully excluded that long term nilotinib treatment may affect female 
fertility. Nilotinib treatment caused embryolethality, decreased foetal weights, an increased incidence 
for skeletal malformations, and skeletal and visceral variations in rats. Overall, the maternal NOAEL 
was established at 10 mg/kg/day whereas no NOAEL for developmental toxicity could be established. 
Based  on  an  increase  in  the  incidence  of  embryo  resorption  and  skeletal  variations,  the  NOAEL  for 
embryo-foetal  effects  in  rabbits  was  100  mg/kg/day.  The  NOAELs  established  in  rats  and  rabbits 
corresponded to plasma levels 0.8 and 0.2-fold of the average human nilotinib plasma exposure level 
(AUC). Consequently, there is no safety margin to human use for the embryo- and foetotoxic effects.  
Local tolerance 
• 
Intravenous injection in New Zealand White rabbits was locally well tolerated. Perivenous or intra-
arterial injection led to slight to moderate erythema and slight oedema which were recorded at higher 
severity and incidence at test item injection sites when compared with the control item injection sites. 
The observed effects are of no relevance for the clinical administration mode. 
Other toxicity studies 
• 
Metabolites 
In a competitive receptor binding assay, P36.5 displayed Ki values of 6.5 and 0.46 µM against 
adenosine receptor type 3 and adenosine transporter ENT1, respectively. P36.5 is passively 
transported in Caco-2 cells and showed permeability lower than 20% of projected absorption in human 
GI tract. Treatment with P36.5 neither affected the hERG current (at concentrations up to 30 µM) nor 
did it cause electrophysiological effects in the rabbit isolated heart assay at concentrations up to 2 µM. 
Studies on impurities 
The impurities are considered qualified up to the following levels: 374-03 (0.34%), 541-04 (0.38%) 
and 512-05 (0.5%). 
The impurities 376-03, 540-04, and 371-03 displayed mutagenic potential when evaluated in Ames 
tests. 376-03 and 371-03 appeared to be weak mutagens (2-fold increase in the number of revertants 
when compared to vehicle), whereas 540-04 was more potent (up to 6-fold increase). 
Phototoxicity 
Nilotinib showed significant absorption within the UV-B and -A range and distribution in the skin 
after oral administration was observed in rats. In two separate in vitro 3T3 NRU phototoxicity 
experiments, Photo-Irritation-Factor s (PIF) of 4.7 and 9.6 were detected. No photoallergic potential 
was detected in the UV-local lymph node assay when skin and eyes were exposed to nilotinib at the 
highest dose of 400 mg/kg. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Nilotinib is unlikely to pose an appreciable risk to the environment. The Phase I calculation of PECSW 
was conservatively based on a market penetration factor (Fpen) of 1%. PECSW was 6 µg/L. Log Kow 
was  below  4.5  thus  further  assessment  of  nilotinib  persistence  and  bioaccumulation  is  not  required. 
The  Phase  II  –  tier  A  refinement  of  PECSw  gives  rise  to  a  value  of  8.44  ng/L.  A  Tier  B  sediment 
organism  toxicity  study  indicates  that  nilotinib  is  unlikely  to  pose  a  risk  to  aquatic  organisms  and 
confirm the expected strong sorption to sludge and soil. Based on the results from the activated sludge 
respiration inhibition study, a PNECmicroorg. was established at 3 mg/L. Since the PECSw: PNECmicroorg. 
ratio is below 0.1, further evaluations of the effect on microorganisms are not required. It is considered 
acceptable that a Phase II - Tier B terrestrial assessment may not be conducted given that PECsoil was 
more than 3500 fold below the action limit (PEC < 100 µg/kg soil) for veterinary medicinal product 
environmental  risk  assessment.  A  PNECgroundwater  was  not  calculated  because  the  substance  is  highly 
unlikely  to  be  found  in  groundwater,  due  to  its  physico-chemical  and  structural  properties  e.g.  low 
biodegradability and high KOC.

Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Nilotinib is a potent inhibitor of native BCR-ABL with an IC50 value of 25 nM, thus it is expected to 
be efficient in patients overexpressing BCR-ABL. Nilotinib was a more potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL 
than imatinib (around 10-fold). Nilotinib inhibited the autophosphorylation and proliferation of 33 out 
of  34  BCR-ABL  mutants  with  IC50  values  in  the  concentration  range  of  20  to  800  nM,  whereas 
imatinib  was  consistently less  efficient.  T315I  mutation  was  resistant  to  both nilotinib  and imatinib. 
Based  on  a  clinical  Cmax  value  of  4.3  µM  (400  mg  b.i.d.),  nilotinib  is  expected  to  inhibit  the  large 
majority of BCR-ABL mutants at therapeutic plasma levels. 
Presently,  no  clinical  safety  data 
increased  risk  for  congestive  heart  failure 
(cardiomyopathy) in patients treated with imatinib, however, there have been recent clinical reports in 
which  imatinib  caused  cardiotoxicity  because  of  the  inhibition  of  c-  ABL  (Kerkelä  et  al.  2006). 
Considering  that  nilotinib  is  a  more  potent  inhibitor  of  c-  ABL  than  imatinib,  the  applicant  has 
committed to conduct further non-clinical post-authorisation studies to address these findings. 
Nilotinib  treatment  caused  inhibition  of  the  hERG  channel  with  an  IC50  of  0.13  µM.  In  accordance 
with  these  findings,  prolongation  of  action  potential  duration  was  observed  at  doses  ≥3  µM  when 
evaluated in vitro. However, no effects were seen in ECG measurements in dogs or monkeys treated 
for  up  to  39 weeks  or  in  a  special  telemetry  study  in  dogs.  Still,  QT-prolongation  was  observed 
clinically and this safety information has been included in section 5.3 of the SPC. 
indicate  an 
Pharmacokinetics 
Nilotinib was readily absorbed after oral administration (tmax 0.5 to 4 h in animals and humans). 
Bioavailability was moderate and a high tendency for metabolism can be supposed from the single 
dose animal data. Generally, exposure values in experimental animals were below or equivalent to the 
human exposure at a dose of 800 mg/day (400 mg bid). 
In general, all of the metabolic pathways observed in humans were also observed in the animal 
species. Accordingly, all of the metabolites identified in humans were also detected in one or more of 
the animal species tested. The parent drug was the major circulating component (~83%) in rats with an 
additional 9 minor radioactive components. The metabolite profiles in human liver slices were 
comparable to those in rat, dog, and monkey. 
Toxicology 
Studies in dogs and monkeys revealed the liver as the primary target organ for toxicity of nilotinib. 
Exposures at the lowest dose levels at which the liver effects were seen were lower than the exposure 
in humans at a dose of 800 mg/day. Alterations included increased alanine aminotransferase and 
alkaline phosphatase activity and histopathology findings (mainly sinusoidal cell or Kupffer cell 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy, bile duct hyperplasia and periportal fibrosis). In general the changes in 
clinical chemistry were fully reversible and only minor liver alterations were seen at longer follow-
ups. These results have been included in the wording of section 5.3 of the SPC. Monitoring for hepatic 
toxicity is included in the ongoing and planned clinical studies and hepatic toxicity is included in the 
risk-minimisation plan. 
Hyperbilirubinaemia could effectively be explained by the effect of nilotinib on UGT1A1. In vitro 
studies showed that nilotinib inhibits activity of UGT1A1. Furthermore pharmacogenetic analysis in 
patients in Phase I and Phase II trials found a statistically significant association between a specific 
genotype of the TA repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of UGT1A1 gene ((TA)7/(TA)7) and 
risk of hyperbilirubinemia. The mechanism is unknown and the possibility of other mechanisms 
cannot be excluded. Elevated bilirubin is mention as an undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Mild haematological changes were observed in mice. These effects may be a consequence of the 
pharmacological activity of the compound on c-Kit and PDGF receptors, which play a crucial role in 
normal haematopoiesis.

Carcinogenicity studies are normally not required for anti-cancer medicinal products due to the short 
life-expectancy i.e. less than 2 to 3 years (CPMP/SWP/997/96, ICHS1A). However, due to the life-
expectancy of CML-CP patients receiving nilotinib (4-6 years), the applicant commits to perform 
post-authorisation carcinogenicity studies, which results are expected to be submitted by the end of 
2010. 
There is no safety margin to human use for the embryo- and foetotoxic effects. Consequently, the 
possibility that pregnant patients in need of  nilotinib treatment at different stages of pregnancy cannot 
be excluded. The potential toxicity of nilotinib on prenatal and postnatal development will be 
addressed post-approval. As a post-authorisation obligation, the results of the pre- and post-natal study 
conducted with nilotinib are expected. 
Nilotinib did not induce teratogenicity in rats but was embryo- and foetotoxic in rats and rabbits at 
doses that also showed maternal toxicity. Increased post-implantation loss was observed in both the 
fertility study, which involved treatment of both males and females, and the embryotoxicity study, 
which involved treatment of females. Embryo-lethality and foetal effects (mainly decreased foetal 
weights, skeletal malformations (fused maxilla/zygomatic), visceral and skeletal variations) in rats and 
increased resorption of foetuses and skeletal variations in rabbits were present in the embryotoxicity 
studies. Exposure to nilotinib in females at NOAEL was generally less or equal to that in humans at 
800 mg/day. These results are adequately reflected in the wording of section 5.3 of the SPC. 
Nilotinib was shown to absorb light in the UV-B and UV-A range, distribute into the skin and 
demonstrated a phototoxic potential in vitro, but no effects were observed in vivo. The risk that 
nilotinib causes photosensitisation in patients is considered very low and this was stated in section 5.3 
of the SPC. In addition, photosensitivity will be followed as an adverse event in future phase III 
randomized studies as part of the risk management plan. 
4.  Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Nilotinib is an oral formulation containing 200 mg per capsule developed to treat CML patients in the 
CP and AP phases that are resistant or intolerant to prior therapy including imatinib.  
There were five trials in healthy volunteers and a trial with sub-studies conducted in patients (CML 
and other haematological malignancies) evaluating the pharmacokinetics of nilotinib. 
Pharmacokinetics studies were performed following a single or multiple oral doses of 200, 400, 600 or 
800 mg of nilotinib. A single study in healthy volunteers and a trial (2101) with 5 sub-studies was 
conducted in patients to evaluate pharmacodynamics. 
The clinical development program for nilotinib consisted of a trial (2101) with a Phase IA dose 
escalation study and a Phase II dose expansion study. These studies were conducted mainly in CML 
patients. No data was submitted regarding patients with CML-BC and no indication is claimed for 
those patients. The data on efficacy was collected up to a data cut-off date of 4 May 2006 for study 
2101E2 (CML-CP) and 23 May 2006 for study 2101E1 (CML-AP) and updated in two following cut-
offs on 4 September 2006 and 4 January 2007 for CML-CP patients and 23 September 2006 and 23 
January 2007 for CML-AP patients. 
GCP 
5. 
All clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The pharmacokinetics of nilotinib was evaluated over a total of 5 trials in healthy volunteers and in 
one trial with several sub-studies for the target population (patients with chronic phase and accelerated 
phase Philadelphia chromosome positive CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy 
including imatinib). The pharmacokinetic studies for nilotinib are summarised in table 6 and 7.

The analytical method used to determine the concentration of nilotinib and the minor pharmacological 
active metabolite (BEJ866) in human serum was high performance liquid chromatography - tandem 
mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The lower limit of quantification was 2.50 ng/ml and 1.00 ng/ml, 
respectively. Full validation reports were submitted.  
Standard statistical analyses were used for PK analysis. 
• 
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
The absolute bioavailability of nilotinib was not assessed, as this formulation has a low aqueous 
solubility and was administered orally. Therefore, the extent of absorption was estimated based on 
excreted radioactive [14C]nilotinib in healthy subjects. The estimated absorption was approximately 
30%, where the Tmax was reached approximately 3 hours following administration.  
Bioequivalence 
Two formulation of nilotinib were used, the clinical service formulation (CSF), which was used in 
study 2101 and the final market image (FMI), which was introduced in study 2101E1 and 2101E2. 
The FMI differs from the CSF by a reduction in capsule size. Only minor quantitative, and no 
qualitative modifications were made between the CSF and the FMI  and no bioequivalence study in 
humans was conducted. Pharmacokinetic parameters, Cmax, Cmin, and the ratio of Cmax/Cmin were 
studied and no relevant differences were detected between the two formulations.

Influence of food 
The effect of food on the pharmacokinetic parameters of 400 mg oral dose of nilotinib (FMI 
formulation) was evaluated (Study 2106). The subjects received 3 treatments of single dose of 
nilotinib under fasting, high fat meal and light meal conditions. The concomitant administration of 
nilotinib with food significantly increased subjects exposure to nilotinib, especially in high fat meals. 
The increase in the total exposure (AUC0-t) was 82% and Cmax was 112% after a high fat breakfast 
whereas the increase in AUC0-t was 29% and Cmax was 55% after a light breakfast given 30 minutes 
prior to dosing.  
• 
Distribution 
Study  2104  evaluated  the  distribution  of  nilotinib  in  the  plasma.  The  mean  apparent  volume 
distribution (Vz/f) was calculated as 579 litres. The fraction of nilotinib distributed to red blood cells 
(fBC) ranged from 0.09 to 0.23 in humans. It was demonstrated that α1-acid glycoprotein was the main 
plasma protein binding to nilotinib (99.1%). 
• 
Elimination 
Unchanged nilotinib was the predominant circulating component detected in the serum, accounting for 
87.5 ± 9.2% of the total nilotinib-related radioactivity from 0-48 h. The apparent plasma clearance 
(CL/f) was determined as 29.1 l/h. The plasma half-life of nilotinib was not influenced by the intake of 
food. Nilotinib administered orally was excreted primarily into the faeces as unchanged drug (69% of 
the dose), with an additional 21% of the excreted dose in the faeces being distributed between 18 
different faecal metabolites, accounting for a total of 90% of the administered dose. Only 4.5% of the 
dose was excreted by the kidneys. 
A total of 74 distinct metabolites of nilotinib were observed. Based on the analysis of nilotinib and its 
metabolites found in faeces and urine, the major metabolic pathway was found to be hydroxylation of 
the methyl group in the methyl-imidazole ring (metabolite P41.6, resulting in 6.7% of total drug 
exposure in serum), with further oxidation of the hydroxyl group to carboxylic acid (metabolite P36.5, 
resulting in 4.7% of total drug exposure in serum). Although these metabolites were present at high 
levels in human serum, 88% of the total drug-related exposure was still due to unchanged nilotinib. 
Studies in human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP enzymes have shown that nilotinib is 
primarily metabolised by CYP3A4, with additional contribution from CYP2C8. 
In studies of Caco-2 cells, nilotinib was a weak substrate for P-gp.

Dose proportionality was measured in the range between 50 to 1200 mg q.d. in the Phase IA (Study 
2101PhI_PK). There was a nilotinib dose-dependent correlation with Cmax and AUC where increase 
Cmax and AUC was observed with nilotinib doses between 50 mg to 400 mg. However, Cmax and AUC 
appeared to plateau for doses above 400 mg, remaining relatively constant over the dose range 
between 400 mg and 1200 mg.  
Once daily doses of nilotinib, 400 mg or 800 mg, showed no appreciable differences in serum 
exposure to drug. Twice daily dosing of 400 mg schedule resulted in a 35% greater than with 800 mg

once daily dose. There was no further increase in exposure to nilotinib when given 600 mg dose with 
the twice daily schedule (1200 mg/day). 
Nilotinib was shown to accumulate with prolonged exposure. At the clinical dose of 400 mg b.i.d., 
accumulation index is about 3.8 for Cmax. A 600 mg b.i.d. dose showed no significant increase in 
exposure over 400 mg b.i.d. To evaluate the Phase II stage of the study, 400 mg b.i.d. dose regimen 
was selected based on the relevant pharmacokinetic properties, as well as based on satisfactory safety 
and preliminary efficacy data reported. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
• 
Over the dose range of 50-1200 mg/day, the inter-patient variability (coefficient of variation) was 34 
to 72 % for Cmax and 32 to 64% for AUC0-t. The inter-patient variability on clearance was 33%, and 
the inter-occasion variability on the bioavailability was 44%. The intra-subject variability estimated 
from data in healthy subjects was 31% for Cmax and 30% for AUC0-inf. 
• 
Comparable exposure in healthy volunteers and the target population has been demonstrated. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Special populations 
• 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic evaluation in 253 patients in the Phases IA/II Study 2101, 
exposure to nilotinib in female patients was approximately 20% greater than in male patients. Race, 
weight and age had no effect on the pharmacokinetic of nilotinib. 
Nilotinib was not studied in a paediatric population.  
Nilotinib has not been studied in patients with a renal or hepatic impairment.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
In vitro studies revealed that CYP3A4 may be the primary enzyme responsible for metabolizing 
nilotinib. In addition, nilotinib was shown to inhibit the metabolic clearance of other CYP3A4 
substrates, suggesting that there may be drug interactions between nilotinib and other compounds 
utilizing this metabolic pathway.  The potential of nilotinib to inhibit the activity of cytochrome P450 
(CYP) enzymes was investigated using pooled human liver microsomes and enzyme-specific probe 
substrates. Ki values of 0.24, 0.13, 3.8, 1.5, and 0.45 µM were determined for CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5, respectively. These results suggest that nilotinib is a moderately 
potent inhibitor of CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 and a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and 
CYP3A4/5. Based on the steady-state nilotinib serum Cmax of 4.3 µM (2260 ng/ml) observed in 
patients receiving twice daily doses of 400 mg, it is likely that nilotinib could act as an inhibitor of 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 activity in clinical settings, but less likely for 
CYP2C19. Preincubation experiments using human liver microsomes and nilotinib showed no 
potential for time-dependent inhibition (i.e., no mechanism-based inactivation) of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5.  
To further investigate and characterize the drug-drug interaction, nilotinib was studied in combination 
with midazolam (study 2108), a CYP3A4 substrate, and ketoconazole (study 2110), a CYP3A4 
inhibitor. 
Study 2108 was an open-label, single center, randomized, three-way crossover study that showed that 
co-administration of midazolam and nilotinib did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics 
of nilotinib. There were no significant differences observed in any of the different  
treatment sequences. Therefore, there are no statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetic 
parameters of nilotinib when administered in conjunction with midazolam. However, in the presence 
of nilotinib, the AUC and Cmax of midazolam increased by 30% and 20%, respectively. Given that 
nilotinib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, it is still recommended to avoid co-administration of 
nilotinib and other medication that are CYP3A4 substrates.  
Study 2110 was an open-label, single center, two-period, single sequence crossover study that showed 
that co-administration of ketoconazole with nilotinib increased AUC and Cmax of nilotinib. The

As shown in table 9, the half-life of nilotinib was prolonged by approximately 115%, Cmax was 
increased by 84% and AUC was increased by approximately 3 fold. Inversely, there were no effects of 
nilotinib on the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole (data not shown). The effect of inhibition of 
CYP3A4 by ketoconazole on nilotinib pharmacokinetics was statistically significant.  
The potential of nilotinib to act as an inhibitor of human UGT1A1 was investigated by examining the 
effect of increasing drug concentrations on bilirubin and estradiol glucuronidation activity in in vitro 
assay systems.  Inhibition of UGT1A1 activity by nilotinib was apparent using either probe reaction 
with an estimated IC50 <1 µM. A follow-up kinetic study estimated a Ki value of 0.19 µM for 
inhibition of estradiol glucuronidation, suggesting that nilotinib could inhibit the activity of UGT1A1 
in a clinical settings. 
Nilotinib was found to be a weak substrate for P-gp mediated efflux (efflux ratio: 3.9-4.1 at a nilotinib 
concentration of 6 µM). The relatively small P-gp mediated efflux ratios for nilotinib coupled with its 
moderate  intrinsic  permeability  suggest  that  nilotinib  should  be  sufficiently  absorbed  following  oral 
administration.  Additional  experiments  indicated  that  nilotinib  inhibits  the  P-gp  mediated  efflux  of 
Rhodamine 123, a known P-gp substrate, with an IC50 of 1.7 µM. Based on this IC50 and the steady-
state nilotinib Cmax of 4.3 µM. The interaction between nilotinib and P-gp was not investigated in vivo. 
In addition, the effect of neutralizing agents, such as antacids and proton pumps inhibitor (PPIs) or 
antiemitics on nilotinib pharmacokinetics were not investigated. Given that the solubility of nilotinib 
is poor in environments with pH values of >1, absorption of nilotinib may be compromised.  
Pharmacodynamics 
There was one pharmacodynamic study in healthy volunteers( 2119), 3 PD studies in patients as part 
of a Phase I study (BMD CAMN107A 2101,  2101-01, 2101-02) and 2 PD studies in patients as part 
of phase II studies (BMD CAMN107A 2101-04, 2101-05).

Studies measuring QTc prolongation was investigated in healthy volunteers and in the target 
population. Volunteers received either nilotinib or a placebo in one of the following regimens: 1)once 
daily doses of 400 mg for a total of 3 doses, 2) twice daily doses of 400 mg for a total of 5 doses, 3) 
once daily doses of 400 mg for a total of 8 doses, 4) a single dose of 800 mg with a high fat meal, and

Concentration (ng/mL)
Nilotinib at doses of 400 mg administered under fasting conditions on once daily schedule for 3 to 8 
days had no consistent effects on the QTcF interval. When nilotinib was administered after a high fat 
meal as a single dose of 800 mg (Cmax of 1669 ng/mL) or 400 mg once daily dose after a high fat meal 
for 3 days (day 3 Cmax of 1532 ng/mL), the drug produced modest, but statistically significant 
increases in QTcF. The time averaged QTcF change was 6.4 msec (90% CI: 2.1-11 msec) for 400 mg 
once daily dose for 3 days with a high fat meal, and 7.4 msec (90% CI: 3.2-12 msec) for a single 800 
mg dose with a high fat meal. 
Studies measuring QTc prolongation was explored in the target population. In Phase IA of study 2101, 
the relationship between dose or serum concentration and changes in QTcF interval was measured.

A relationship between plasma concentration and effect was established. There was an association 
between nilotinib AUC and white blood count (WBC) reduction. Age and gender did not show a 
significant influence. 
The promoter polymorphism of the UGT1A1 gene was investigated by DNA sequencing to identify an 
association between genetic variation and hyperbilirubinemia. The TA(7)/TA(7) genotype was 
identified to be associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of hyperbilirubinemia.  
Overall discussion and conclusion 
• 
Pharmacokinetics of nilotinib was reasonably well studied in healthy volunteers and in the target 
population.  Nilotinib was not studied in a paediatric population and, thus, is not recommended to be 
used in children at this time, as stated in section 4.2 of the SPC. 
Administration of nilotinib with food significantly increased AUC exposure, especially in high fat 
meals. Therefore, it is recommended that nilotinib not be taken with a meal in order to minimize the

effect of food on nilotinib bioavailability.  A statement in this regard is included in sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 4.5 of the SPC.  
The dose-proportionality study of nilotinib demonstrated that nilotinib was not dose-proportional. The 
AUC and Cmax exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner until a maximum dose of 400 mg q.d. 
was reached. A dose-limiting exposure was apparent above this dose, since increases above this level 
resulted in significantly less exposure to nilotinib than expected. This limitation is overcome to some 
extent by increasing the daily dose in two separate dosing steps; administering 400 mg nilotinib b.i.d. 
instead of 800 mg q.d. This dosing regimen was shown to increase nilotinib AUC exposure by 35%, 
where the mean maximum plasma concentration reached approximately 2260 ng/mL (SD 800).  
A pharmacokinetic study based on the stratification of population was performed to identify extrinsic 
factors influencing the pharmacokinetic of nilotinib. There were no significant influences of weight, 
age and race on the pharmacokinetic properties of nilotinib, though data are insufficient for the latter. 
However, exposure in female patients appears to be increased by approximately 20%. 
Pharmacokinetics in a paediatric population was not studied 
The pharmacokinetic of nilotinib was not studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Given 
the metabolism and excretion profile of nilotinib, pharmacokinetics of nilotinib are likely to be 
affected in patients with hepatic impairment but unlikely in patients with renal impairment. A warning 
statement regarding patients with renal and hepatic impairment was included in section 4.2 of the SPC 
and the company has committed to study PK in hepatic impaired patient as a post-authorization study. 
Given that the solubility of nilotinib is poor in environments with pH values of >1, absorption of 
nilotinib may be compromised. Effects of neutralizing agents or antiemitics should be further 
investigated. The applicant has committed to perform a drug-drug interaction study with PPIs in 
healthy subjects as a follow-up measure. A special statement warning of these potential interactions 
has been included in the SPC, sections 4.4 and 4.5. 
In vitro studies suggested that nilotinib may have the potential to inhibit several CYP enzymes, as well 
as  inhibition  of  P-gp  and  UGT1A1.  The  applicant  demonstrated  a  clinically  significant  increase  in 
nilotinib  exposure  following  co-administration  with  ketoconazole,  a  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitor. 
Therefore,  it  is  recommended  that  co-administration  of  nilotinib  with  other  compounds  that  are 
inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be avoided. A warning statement stating the risks of co-administration of 
nilotinib with other CYP3A4 subtrates  is included  in sections 4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC. The effect of 
nilotinib  on  midazolam,  a  model  substrate  and  inducer  of  CYP3A4,  was  moderate  and  does  not 
suggest that nilotinib inhibition of CYP3A4 may be a clinically relevant issue. However, the applicant 
will provide the final report on a drug-drug interaction study with a CYP3A4 inducer like rifampicin 
as  a  post-authorization  follow-up  measure,  as  this  may  have  important  safety  implications.  The 
applicant also commits to provide post-authorization studies to quantify the possible effect of nilotinib 
on CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, p-glycoprotein and UGT1A1. 
Results from pharmacodynamic studies measuring QTc prolongation in healthy volunteers and target 
population show a significant increase in the mean time-averaged change from baseline in QTcF 
associated with nilotinib treatment. Therefore, nilotinib should be used with caution in patients who 
have or may develop prolongation of QTc, including co-treatment with other drugs that may prolong 
QTc. An appropriate warning to the effect was included in sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the SPC. In 
addition an educational material addressing  the cardiac risks associated with nilotinib will be 
provided to prescribers and pharmacists prior to launch.  
Clinical efficacy  
The clinical efficacy program of nilotinib in imatinib-resistant/intolerant Ph+ CML in CP or AP was 
based on study 2101, an uncontrolled unblinded, non-randomised, multi-centre Phase IA/II trial which 
contained several treatment arms, two of which provided the CML patient cohorts: Study 2101E2 
(Phase II) for the indication in patients with CML-Chronic Phase (CML-CP) and study 2101E1 (Phase 
II) for the indication in patients with CML-Accelerated Phase (CML-AP). In addition, some 
supportive efficacy was provided in the Phase I part of the study.

Dose response study(ies) 
• 
The dose-escalation Phase IA component of study 2101 evaluated the safety, tolerability, biologic 
activity, and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of nilotinib. Eligibility criteria included age ≥ 18 years with 
imatinib-resistant Ph+ CML in CP, AP or BC; or relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL, adequate performance 
status (WHO ≤ 2), and normal hepatic, renal, and cardiac functions. 119 patients were enrolled and 
analyzed. 
Nilotinib hard gelatin capsules were administered orally and dose strengths of 50mg and 200mg were 
supplied.  The  starting  dose  was  a  flat  dose  of  50  mg  administered  continuously  on  a  once-daily 
schedule, repeated as a 28-day cycle. A second schedule evaluated twice-daily dosing, starting at 400 
mg  orally.  Following  completion  of  cycle  1  (28  days),  treatment  with  nilotinib  continued  until  the 
patient experienced unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. 
The two-sample MCRM model determined that 600 mg b.i.d was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). 
The criteria for selection of a dose regimen included the PK profile, the hematologic and cytogenetic 
responses observed, and safety data of patients in the CML-AP cohort (see Table 11). The 400 mg 
b.i.d. dose regimen was selected for evaluation in the Phase II component of the study.

Imatinib  intolerance  (at  any  dose  and/or  duration)  included  patients  who  did  not  have  a  major 
cytogenetic response to imatinib, and had discontinued imatinib therapy due to the following: Grade 3 
or 4 adverse events that persisted in spite of optimal supportive care measures, for example: skin rash, 
fluid  retention,  cardiopulmonary  events,  thrombocytopenia,  liver  function  abnormalities,  peripheral

G-CSF, GMCSF) ≤ 1 week prior to starting study drug. Erythropoietin was allowed. 
Treatments 
The dose for Phase II was 400 mg nilotinib b.i.d. (total daily dose of 800 mg). Patients may have had a 
dose escalation to 600 mg b.i.d. according to escalation criteria. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
•  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of nilotinib in patients with imatinib-resistant or intolerant 
CML-CP 
Secondary objectives included:  
•  To detect of BCR-ABL transcripts by Q-RT-PCR, to detect Crk-L protein by western blot and 
to perform a mutational analysis of the BCR-ABL kinase domain during and after therapy in 
malignant cells taken from the bone marrow and/or blood 
•  To evaluate the population pharmacokinetics of nilotinib 
•  To examine whether individual genetic variation in genes relating to drug metabolism, CML 
and the drug pathway confer differential response to nilotinib  
•  To identify gene expression patterns in tumor cells that are associated with treatment response 
to nilotinib or that correlate with the severity or progression of CML 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  for  CML-CP  was  major  (complete  +  partial)  cytogenetic  response 
(MCyR). 
©EMEA 2007 
23/52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  secondary  efficacy  variables  included:  loss  of  MCyR,  duration  of  MCyR,  rate  of  CHR,  loss  of 
CHR, duration of CHR, time to treatment failure (TTF), time to AP or BC, major molecular response 
(MMR),  number  (and  percent)  of  patients  who  received  stem  cell  transplants  (HSCT),  and  overall 
survival  (OS).  Additional  efficacy  variables  included:  time  to  MCyR,  time  to  CHR,  time  to 
progression  (TTP).  Baseline  mutations  and  gene  expression  patterns  during  and  after  therapy  were 
also investigated. 
Sample size 
The  protocol-specified  efficacy  analysis  for  CML-CP  is  defined  for  the  time  when  the  first  132 
patients either completed 12 months of treatment, discontinued the study, or a confirmed hematologic 
response  had  been  observed.  The  sample  size  was  calculated  assuming  a  true  response  rate  of  p  ≥ 
20%, based on a one-sided level of significance of 2.5% and a power of 90%. 
An interim analysis was scheduled when the first 132 patients either completed 6 months of treatment 
or discontinued study. The interim analysis took place with a data cut-off from the 04 May 2006 and is 
the basis of this MAA. Additional cut-off dates  for follow-up data collection were performed on 04 
Sep 2006 and 04 Jan 2007. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
There was no randomisation or blinding in this open and uncontrolled phase II study. 
Statistical methods 
The  study  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  major  (complete  +  partial)  cytogenetic  response  rate  using 
Fleming’s single-stage, single-arm test procedure to test H0: p ≤ 10% where p is the major cytogenetic 
response rate.  
Assuming a true response rate of p ≥ 20%, with α = 2.5% (one-sided) and power = 90%, the required 
number of responders were 21/132 in the CML-CP  patient group. Response rate was calculated and 
95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  was  provided  using  Pearson-Clopper  limits.  Time-to-event  variables 
were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. 
Safety variables were analyzed by frequency counts of adverse events, newly-occurring or worsening 
grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities along with shift table analysis and of QT prolongation. 
Patients who discontinued before any cytogenetic assessment were considered as non-assessable (NA) 
in terms of efficacy evaluation, except for patients who discontinued due to progression (PD) or death 
without any cytogenetic assessment, in which case patients were considered as ‘PD’ or ‘Death’. For 
patients  who  discontinued  the  study,  any  assessment  after  the  discontinuation  was  not  used  for 
efficacy evaluation. Date of study discontinuation was considered as the date of study completion visit 
or date of last dose of nilotinib. 
Subgroup analysis was performed in the ITT primary population concerning the matter of resistance or 
intolerance on demographic and disease factors and with regard to the item dose escalation. 
RESULTS 
Participant flow and Recruitment 
The  originally  planned  and  required  sample  size  of  132  patients  (primary  enrolment)  was  recruited 
between  21 April  2005  and 17  October  2005.  Patients  from  North  America  (N=35),  Europe  (N=93) 
Australia (N=2) and Asia (=2) from 63 centres in 10 participating countries (USA, Belgium, Germany, 
Spain, France, Italy, Netherlands, UK, South Korea and Australia) were enrolled. The cut-off date at 
the time of the initial MAA was on 4 May 2006 for this primary population. Additional patients were 
enrolled according to protocol, in order to provide continued patient access to nilotinib. Later cut-off

dates for collection of efficacy and safety data were performed on 04 Sep 2006 and 04-Jan-2007 from 
total of 280 and 320 patients respectively (overall populations).  
The majority of treatment discontinuations in the overall population were because of adverse events 
(15.9%) or disease progression (15.9%) (cut-off 4 Jan 2007).  
Conduct of the study 
Ten amendments were made to the original protocol. The most important was amendment 8 (dated 
Feb 2006) which included modifications regarding cardiac safety:  
•  Contraindication, unless absolutely necessary, of concomitant administration of agents that 
prolonged the QT interval and CYP3A4 inhibitors. In cases where unavoidable, a strong 
recommendation that ECG be obtained 24 to 48 hours and one week after initiating the 
concomitant therapy 
•  Revision of criteria for discontinuation or dose reduction of nilotinib based on ECG QTc 
prolongation 
•  Lowering of the maximal QTcF for inclusion: from 480 to 450 msec 
•  Exclusion of patients diagnosed with or treated for unstable angina during the past 12 months 
Protocol violations occurred in 51.5 % (68/132) of all ITT primary patients (cut-off 4 May 2006): 28 
were considered major violations and led to exclusion of patients from per-protocol efficacy analyses. 
Baseline data 
The median time since first diagnosis of CML was 4.6 years with a range from 0.4 to 22.9 years. 
Approximately half of all patients (48.2%) were diagnosed with CML ≥ 5 years prior to study entry. 
The majority of patients (57.4%) had achieved prior cytogenetic response. In approximately one third 
of all patients, a complete haematologic response (CHR) was the best response achieved and about 9% 
never reached CHR. In the ITT primary population, 68.9% of the patients were imatinib resistant. The 
majority (58.3%) of these patients had received ≥600 mg of imatinib per day for at least 3 months. Of 
the remaining patients, 4.5% had not received ≥600 mg of imatinib per day for at least 3 months and 
had evidence of disease progression, and 6.1% of all patients had not received ≥600 mg of imatinib 
per day for at least 3 months and did not have evidence of disease progression. Overall, less than one 
third (31.1%) of the ITT primary patients were imatinib-intolerant.

Numbers analysed 
Efficacy populations were defined as follows: 
ITT  primary  population  includes  the  first  132  CML-CP  patients  who  have  either  completed  6 
months  of  treatment  or  discontinued  study.  Patients  with  major  protocol  violations  were  considered 
non responders regardless of whether or not they experienced a response. 
Conventional  ITT  population  consisted  of  all  patients  in  the  ITT  primary  population  who  were 
assessed for their response irrespective of any major protocol violation. In the ITT primary population, 
patients with major protocol violations were considered non responders. In the revised ITT population, 
actual observed responses of these major protocol violators were considered.

Per-protocol  (PP)  population  consisted  of  all  patients  in  the  ITT  primary  population  who  had  no 
major  protocol  violations.  The  list  of  patients  eligible  for  the  PP  population  was  finalized  prior  to 
database lock. 
In addition, two categories of patients were distinguished based on the time of their enrolment: 
Primary  enrolment  consists  of  the  first  132  consecutively  enrolled  CML-CP  patients.  This  is  the 
patient population as specified in the statistical analysis plan of the original MAA. 
Overall  enrolment  includes  all  320  patients  in  the  study,  including  the  first  primary  enrolled  132 
patients mentioned above.  
All  efficacy  analyses  were  based  on  the  ITT  primary  population.  In  addition,  cytogenetic  and 
haematologic responses were analyzed using per-protocol populations. Populations analysed (cut-off 
04 May 2006) were as follows:

b) Study 2101 E1: For patients who are resistant to or intolerant of imatinib with CML-
Accelerated phase (CML-AP) 
METHODS: 
Study Participants 
The  study  population  was  defined  as  including  adult  patients  with  CML-AP  who  were  imatinib-
resistant / intolerant under the following criteria: 
Imatinib resistance for CML-AP patients included: 
1.  Any  of  the  following  during  imatinib  therapy  with  at  least  600  mg  per  day  (unless  they  met  the 
criteria outlined below for the definition of imatinib intolerance): 
• Disease progression from CP to AP occurring during imatinib therapy. 
•  Disease  progression  defined  as  ≥  50%  increase  in  peripheral  white  blood  cell  count,  blast 
count, basophils, or platelets during imatinib therapy for AP. 
•  Lack  of  hematologic  response  in  the  bone  marrow  following  a  minimum  of  4  weeks  of 
imatinib therapy for AP. 
2. Patients otherwise eligible for study receiving < 600 mg per day were eligible if the presence of one 
of the following amino acid mutations was detected by direct sequencing: 
• L248, G250, Q252, Y253, E255, T315, F317, H396 CML-AP patients who became resistant 
 during  chronic  phase  and  met  the  definition  of  imatinib  resistant  in  the  CML-chronic  phase 
were eligible for entry. 
Imatinib  intolerance  included  patients  who  did  not  have  a  major  cytogenetic  response  to  imatinib, 
and had discontinued imatinib therapy due to the following: Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that persisted 
in spite of optimal supportive care measures, for example: skin rash, fluid retention, cardiopulmonary 
events, thrombocytopenia, liver function abnormalities, peripheral neuropathy and diarrhea; or Grade 
2  adverse  events  related  to  imatinib  therapy,  in  spite  of  optimal  supportive  care  measures,  that 
persisted  for  ≥  1  month  or  that  recurred  for  more  than  3  times  whether  dose  was  reduced  or 
discontinued. 
Eligibility criteria included patients with imatinib resistant or intolerant CML-AP, defined as never in 
blast  crisis  before  starting  treatment,  age  ≥  18  years,  with  adequate  performance  status  (WHO  ≤  2), 
and  normal  hepatic,  renal,  and  cardiac  functions.  One  or  more  of  the  following  criteria  had  to  be 
present  within  4  weeks  prior  to  beginning  treatment:  1.  ≥  15%  but  <  30%  blasts  in  blood  or  bone 
marrow,  2.  ≥  30%  blasts  plus  promyelocytes  in  peripheral  blood  or  bone  marrow  (providing  that  < 
30%  blasts  present  in  bone  marrow),  3.  Peripheral  basophils  ≥  20%,  4.  Thrombocytopenia  <  100  X 
109/L unrelated to therapy. The same exclusion criteria as in patients with chronic phase CML were 
applied including no prior treatment with an investigational TKI other than imatinib. 
Treatments 
The dose for Phase II was 400 mg nilotinib b.i.d. (total daily dose of 800 mg). Patients may have had a 
dose escalation to 600 mg b.i.d. according to escalation criteria.

Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of nilotinib  in  patients  with  imatinib-
resistant or intolerant CML-AP. 
Secondary objectives were the same as for patients with chronic phase CML. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable for CML-AP was confirmed overall hematologic response (HR). 
The secondary efficacy variables included: loss of HR, loss of complete hematologic response (CHR), 
duration of HR, time to HR, time to progression, time to treatment failure (TTF), cytogenetic response 
(CyR),  loss  of  major  cytogenetic  response  (MCyR),  loss  of  complete  cytogenetic  response  (CCyR), 
duration  of  MCyR/CCyR,  time  to  MCyR/CCyR,  major  molecular  response  (MMR),  number  (and 
percent) of patients who received stem cell transplants, and overall survival (OS). Additional efficacy 
variables included: time to CHR, time to MCyR, time to progression (TTP). Baseline mutations and 
gene expression patterns during and after therapy were also investigated. 
Sample size and statistical methods 
The protocol-specified Group A efficacy analysis for CML-AP was to be performed after the first 132 
CML-AP  patients  either  completed  24  weeks  of  treatment,  discontinued  the  study,  or  a  confirmed 
hematologic  response  had  been  observed.  However,  the  Phase-IA  results  demonstrated  that  the 
majority of patients achieved a hematologic response well before 24 weeks of treatment. The median 
time  to  best  hematologic  response  for  CML-AP  patients  was  28  days  and  the  observed  rate  of 
hematologic response (76%) achieved in Phase IA was much higher than anticipated (20%). Based on 
this  observations,  the  claim  of  efficacy  for  CML-AP  patients  was  modified  to  the  first  64  patients 
included in the study who have completed 4 months of treatment or discontinued study. 
Randomization/blinding (masking) 
There was no randomisation or blinding in this open and uncontrolled phase II study. 
Statistical methods 
The study was designed to evaluate the confirmed overall hematologic response rate using Fleming’s 
single-stage, single-arm test procedure to test H0: p ≤ 10% where p is the hematologic response rate. 
Assuming a true response rate of p ≥ 25%, with α = 2.5% (one-sided) and power = 90%, the required 
number  of  responders  were  12/64  in  the  CML-AP  patient  group.  Response  rate  was  calculated  and 
95% confidence interval (CI) was provided using Pearson-Clopper limits. Time to event variables was 
analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. 
RESULTS 
Participant flow and Recruitment 
The originally planned and required sample size of 64 patients (primary enrolment) was recruited 
between 9 May 2005 and 18 January 2006. The cut-off date at the time of the initial MAA was on 23 
May 2006 for this primary population. Additional patients were enrolled according to protocol, in 
order to provide continued patient access to nilotinib. Later cut-off dates for collection of efficacy and 
safety data were performed on 23 Sep 2006 and 23 Jan 2007 from total of 96 and 119 patients 
respectively (overall populations). 
The majority of treatment discontinuations in the overall population were because of adverse events 
(15 patients, 12.6%) or disease progression (35 patients, 29.4%) (cut-off 23 Jan 2007).

Conduct of the study 
The  conduct  of  the  study  was  the  same  as  in  patients  with  chronic  phase  CML.  The  same  ten 
substantial amendments also apply for accelerated phase CML patients. 
Protocol  violations  occurred  in  76.6%  (49/64)  of  all  ITT  primary  patients  (cut-off  4  May  2006).  28 
were considered major violations and led to exclusion of patients from per-protocol efficacy analyses.

Numbers analysed 
All  efficacy  analyses  were  based  on  the  ITT  primary  population.  In  addition,  cytogenetic  and 
hematologic  responses  were  analyzed  using  per-protocol  populations.  For  the  definitions  of  the 
populations please refer to the respective bullet point in the chronic phase CML arm above. 
Populations analysed (cut-off 23 May 2006) are as follows:  
In addition the two categories of patients based on the time of their enrolment were: 
Primary  enrolment:  the  first  64  consecutively  enrolled  CML-AP  patients.  This  is  the  patient 
population as specified in the statistical analysis plan of the original MAA. 
Overall  enrolment:  Since  the  study  was  still  enrolling  at  the  time  of  data  cut-off,  out  of  the  127 
patients enrolled at the cut-off date, the efficacy population included the 119 patients who have either 
completed 6 months of treatment or discontinued from the study for progressive disease, including the 
first primary enrolled 64 patients mentioned above.

Supportive studies were not performed. 
•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
An open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre Phase II study was conducted to determine the efficacy of 
Tasigna in patients with imatinib resistant or intolerant CML with separate treatment arms for chronic 
and accelerated phase disease. The study is ongoing. Efficacy was based on 320 CP patients and 
119 AP patients enrolled. Overall, 73% of patients were imatinib-resistant, while 27% were imatinib-
intolerant. Median duration of treatment was 341 days for CP patients and 202 days for AP patients. 
Tasigna was administered on a continuous basis (twice daily 2 hours after a meal and with no food for 
at least one hour after administration) unless there was evidence of inadequate response or disease 
progression. Dose escalation to 600 mg twice daily was allowed. 
Efficacy data was updated by changing the cut-off date for the CML-CP study to 04-Jan-2007 and for 
the CML-AP study to 23-Jan-2007. This adds 8 months compared to the original submission resulting 
in a minimum follow-up of 14 months in the CML-CP study and 12 months in the CML-AP study. 
The efficacy data was confirmed in the updated cut-off. The MCyR and CHR are both convincing for 
the CML-CP population and CML-AP population respectively. Efficacy data in patients with CML-
BC are not available. At present only dasatinib, which was approved in November 2006 after 
submission of the Tasigna application, is indicated in these patients. The efficacy of nilotinib appears 
to be similar to dasatinib, however not head to head comparison is available.  
Resistance to imatinib included failure to achieve a complete haematological response (by 3 months), 
cytogenetic response (by 6 months) or major cytogenetic response (by 12 months) or progression of 
disease after a previous cytogenetic or haematological response. Imatinib intolerance included patients 
who discontinued imatinib because of toxicity and were not in major cytogenetic response at time of 
study entry. The majority of patients had a long history of CML that included extensive prior 
treatment with other antineoplastic agents, including imatinib, hydroxyurea, interferon, and some had 
even failed organ transplant. The median highest prior imatinib dose had been 600 mg/day for CP 
patients and 800 mg/day for AP patients. The highest prior imatinib dose was ≥600 mg/day in 75% of 
all patients, with 41% of patients receiving imatinib doses ≥800 mg/day. 
Separate treatment arms were also included in the Phase II study to investigate Tasigna in a group of 
CP and AP patients who had been extensively pre-treated with multiple therapies including a tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor agent in addition to imatinib. The study is ongoing. Of these patients 30/36 (83%) 
were treatment resistant not intolerant. In 22 CP patients evaluated for efficacy Tasigna induced a 32% 
MCyR rate and a 50% CHR rate. In 11 AP patients, evaluated for efficacy, treatment induced a 36%

overall HR rate. 
After imatinib failure, 24 different Bcr-Abl mutations were noted in 45% of chronic phase and 57% of 
accelerated phase CML patients who were evaluated for mutations. Tasigna demonstrated efficacy in 
patients harbouring a variety of Bcr-Abl mutations associated with imatinib resistance, except T315I. 
Clinical safety 
The primary safety population included 438 imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients with CML-CP or 
CML-AP (318 patients with CML-CP/120 patients with CML-AP) treated with 400 mg b.i.d. of 
nilotinib during the two pivotal phase II treatment arms of study 2101 (2101E2 in CML-CP and 
2101E1 in CML-AP). Dose escalation to 600 mg b.i.d. was performed only in a small number of 
patients (12.9% and 21.7%). Additional supportive safety data was presented from the Phase I of 
Study 2101 and some other small studies. Overall the safety information derived from these studies is 
in line with the findings in the pivotal studies.

The  mean  dose  intensity  was  roughly  700 mg/day  (±  202  mg/day),  comparable  for  both  indications 
and corresponded to 400 mg b.i.d dosing. 
•  Adverse events 
The most frequently observed adverse events (AEs) in patients with CML-CP or CML-AP (Phase II of 
Study 2101)  are  shown  for  each  disease  stage  in  Table  25.  Overall,  haematological  and 
myelosuppressive toxicity was noted as the most frequent cause of AEs, followed by gastrointestinal 
and  skin  related  AEs.  Due  to  short  duration  of  treatment,  especially  in  CML-CP  patients,  no 
assessment concerning changes of AEs after long term exposure was possible.

Updated results from the 4 January 2007 cut-off confirm that a majority of CML patients experienced 
severe  AEs  (SAE)  during  the  course  of  the  study,  with  69.5%  of  CML-CP  patients  and  67.5%  of 
CML-AP patients presenting CTC grade 3 or 4 AEs. The most frequently reported CTC grade 3 or 4 
AEs overall included thrombocytopenia (25.3%), neutropenia (16.7%), anaemia (8.7%) and increased 
lipase (7.5%). In CML-CP patients, the most frequently reported CTC grade 3 or 4 AEs were identical 
to  above  (22%,  15.4%,  6.9%  and  6.9%  for  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  anaemia  and  increased 
lipase,  respectively).  In  CML-AP  patients,  additional  frequently  reported  CTC  grade  3  or  4  AEs 
included leucopenia (6.7%), pneumonia (4.2%) and decreased haemoglobin (4.2%). 
The  most  frequent  SAEs  overall  were  related  to  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (7.3%), 
followed  by  those  of  cardiac  disorders  (5.7%),  gastrointestinal  disorders  (4.6%),  general  disorders 
(5.3%),  and  infections  and  infestations  (5.5%).  In  CML-CP  patients,  the  most  frequent  SAEs  were 
thrombocytopenia  (2.8%),  neutropenia  (1.9%),  and  myocardial  infarction  (1.3%).  In  CML-AP 
patients, the most frequent SAEs were thrombocytopenia (7.5%), neutropenia (6.7%) and pneumonia 
(5.0%). 3 Patients (0,8%) were reported with pancreatitis as SAE.

Blood and lymphatic disorders 
Myelosuppression  was  a  common  finding.  Thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  and  anaemia  were  the 
most frequently reported grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities in CML-CP and CML-AP patients. 
• 
• 
• 
The  incidences  of  treatment-emergent  CTC  grade  3-4  thrombocytopenia  in  CML-CP  and 
CML-AP patients were 22% and 34.2%, respectively. 
The incidences of treatment-emergent CTC grade 3-4 neutropenia in CML-CP and CML-AP 
patients were 15.7% and 30%, respectively. 
The  incidences  of  treatment-emergent  CTC  grade  3-4  anaemia  in  CML-CP  and  CML-AP 
patients were 6.9% and 13.3%, respectively. 
In the CML-CP population, the most frequent CTC grade 3-4 haematological abnormalities concerned 
absolute  lymphocytes  (24%),  neutrophils  (28.3%),  white  blood  count  (17.1%)  and  platelet  counts 
(11.2%).  The  median  time  to  first  grade  3  or  4  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  anaemia  and 
leucopenia  was  49.5,  39,  46  and  50.5  days,  respectively.  The  median  duration  of  grade  3  or  4 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leucopenia was 15, 22, 8 and 15 days, respectively (cut-
off date 4 May 2006). 
In  the  CML-AP  population,  the  findings  were  similar:  the  most  frequent  CTC  grade  3-4 
haematological abnormalities concerned absolute lymphocytes (35.1%), haemoglobin (22.9%), white 
blood count (30.5%), neutrophils (37.1%) and platelet counts (37.4%). The median time to first grade 
3  or  4  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  anaemia  and  leucopenia  was  19,  14,  13.0  and  28  days, 
respectively.  The  median  duration  of  grade  3  or  4  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  anaemia  and 
leucopenia was 15, 26, 8 and 14 days, respectively (cut-off date 4 May 2006). 
Bleeding 
Severe bleeding events were rare in both phase II CML-CP and CML-AP studies. In CML-CP patient 
in phase II of Study 2101 (n = 341), all grades and grade 3-4 gastrointestinal haemorrhages occurred 
in 9 (2.6%) and 4 (1.3%) patients only. In CML-AP patient in phase II of Study 2101 (n = 120), all 
grades  and  grade  3-4  gastrointestinal  haemorrhages  occurred  in  5  (3.8%)  and  2  (1.5%).  Intracranial 
bleeding occurred in 1 (0.3%) and 3 (3%) CML-CP and CML-AP patients, respectively. One case of 
cerebral haemorrhage lead to death. Haematological toxicity was reversible after 2-3 weeks of study 
drug discontinuation. Haematological toxicity was more pronounced in CML-AP patients compared to 
CML-CP patients.

Clinical chemistry 
Elevation  in  serum  lipase  (CTC  grade  4)  was  found  in  2.7%  of  the  target  population.  Pancreatitis 
occurred in 5 (0.8%) of 622 patients treated in phase II of Study 2101 and in 2 (0.7%) and 1 (1.1%) of 
CML-CP and CML-AP patients. It resulted in treatment discontinuation in all 3 cases in the CML-CP 
and CML-AP population 
Deaths 
In  the  original  studies,  three  deaths  occurred  in  CML-CP  and  7  in  CML-AP.  Out  of  these,  the 
investigators  suspected  that  two  deaths  in  CML-CP  patients  and  two  deaths  in  CML-AP  population 
had a suspected cause of death related to the study drug. These patients died from sequelae related to 
the  haematological  toxicity  (sepsis,  bleeding)  and  cardiac  disorder  (cardiac  failure,  coronary  heart 
disease). In the complete phase II program 47 deaths occurred in 622 patients. Most of these deaths 
were  due  to  the  underlying  disease  (25/47),  deaths  to  infection  or  sepsis  were  observed  in  9/47 
patients,  death  as  a  consequence  of  an  intra-cerebral  bleeding  was  seen  in  7/47  patients  and  cardiac 
reason was reported in 4 patients. 
As  of  July  25,  2007  approximately  2,740  patients  received  nilotinib  in  Novartis  sponsored  clinical 
studies  and  investigator-initiated  clinical  trials  for  CML,  GIST,  and  other  hematologic  malignancies 
and the Compassionate use program. From the total safety population of 2,740 nilotinib patients, 10 
cases of sudden cardiac deaths have been identified. Overall, the investigator causality assessment for 
nilotinib  was  considered  suspected  in  5,  not  suspected  in  4  and  not  provided  in  1  case.  Based  on  a 
review  of  these  10  cases  by  an  external  expert  cardiologist,  a  causality  assessment  of  not  related  or 
unlikely  was  made  in  5  cases  and  for  the  remaining  5  cases  a  causal  role  for  nilotinib  could  not  be 
ruled out. This means the frequency is 0.18-0.36%.

•  Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy  
No pregnancies have been reported during the nilotinib clinical development program. 
Children and adolescents 
Tasigna was not investigated in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. 
Elderly patients 
Approximately 30% of subjects in clinical studies were 65 years of age or over. No major differences 
were observed for safety and efficacy in patients ≥ 65 years of age as compared to adults aged 18 to 65 
years. 
Patients with renal impairment 
Clinical studies have not been performed in patients with impaired renal function. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Tasigna has not been investigated in patients with hepatic impairment.  
•  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interactions resulting from CYP3A4 interference of nilotinib have been investigated in two studies in 
healthy volunteers using midazolam as substrate and ketoconazole as an inhibitor of the CYP3A4. Co-
administration of ketoconazole with nilotinib increased nilotinib Cmax by 84% and AUC by 3-fold. No 
change in ketoconazole pharmacokinetic was observed. Nilotinib decreased the apparent clearance of 
midazolam  resulting  in  increases  of  Cmax  and  AUC  by  20%  and  31%,  respectively.  Studies  with 
CYP3A4 inducers like Rifampicin were not performed. 
The potential of nilotinib to act as an inhibitor of human UGT1A1 was investigated by examining the 
effect of increasing drug concentrations on bilirubin and estradiol glucuronidation activity in in-vitro 
assay systems. Inhibition of UGT1A1 activity by nilotinib was apparent therefore it could inhibit the 
activity of UGT1A1 in clinical settings. 
Food influence 
Food factors affecting the serum concentration of nilotinib have been identified in the pharmacokinetic 
studies  in  phase  I  and  II.  The  serum  concentration  of  nilotinib  is  increased  when  it  is  taken  with  or 
immediately after food, and particularly when it is taken with or after a high fat meal.  
©EMEA 2007 
42/52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A high-fat meal increases the QTcF by 10 msec from baseline. If the patient at the same time takes a 
CYP 3A4 inhibitor the predicted prolongation is 18 msec. 
•  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation due to AEs was seen in both studies in 68 of 438 (15.5 %) patients who develop AEs 
(98.4%).  The  most  frequent  reason  for  discontinuation  due  to  AEs  was  haematological  toxicity 
(26/438; 5.9%) with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Cardiac (6/438; 1.4%), gastrointestinal (7/438, 
1.6%) and cutaneous (6/438, 1.4%) AEs were the other important reasons for discontinuation. 
•  Post marketing experience 
No post marketing experience was available at the time of submission of the application. 
•  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  main  focus  of  the  assessment  of  safety  results  is  the  data  of  the  pivotal  phase  II  CML-CP  and 
CML-AP patient population. Overall, from the result presented in the interim analysis, nilotinib seems 
to be tolerated relatively well in both populations. A mean dose intensity of approx 700 mg/day (±202 
mg/day)  was  observed  at  date  of  cut-off,  with  short  median  duration  of  exposures  of  341  days  for 
CML-CP patients and 202 days for CML-AP patients. 
The overall incidence of adverse events was 99.1% in CML-CP patients (phase II study) and 96.7% in 
CML-AP patients (phase II study). Nearly all patients included in the pivotal studies some AEs were 
observed during the treatment, however the toxicity is manageable and it has been adequately stated in 
section  4.8  of  the  SPC.  Overall,  haematological  and  myelosuppressive  toxicity  and  cardiac  events 
were noted as the most frequent cause of AEs. 
Treatment with nilotinib is associated with thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia (National 
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3-4). Thrombocytosis is often seen in CML-CP.I In 
more advanced stages of the disease, thrombocytopenia is a common finding. Occurrence is more 
frequent in patients with CML-AP. Complete blood counts should be performed every two weeks for 
the first 2 months and then monthly thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Myelosuppression was 
generally reversible and usually managed by withholding nilotinib temporarily or dose reduction (see 
section 4.2) 
Nilotinib was shown to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarisation as measured by the QT interval on 
the surface ECG in a concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, nilotinib must be used with caution 
in patients who are at a significant risk of developing prolongation of QTc. Close monitoring for an 
effect on the QTc interval is advisable and a baseline ECG is recommended prior to initiating therapy 
with nilotinib as clinically indicated. Moreover, significant prolongation of the QT interval may occur 
when nilotinib is inappropriately taken with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or medicinal products with 
a known potential to prolong QT, and/or food. The presence of hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia 
may further enhance this effect. These concerns have been adequately stated in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of 
the SPC. In addition,  educational material addressing the cardiac risks associated with nilotinib will 
be provided to prescribers and pharmacists prior to launch.  
The incidences of QTcF change from baseline > 60 ms and QTcF > 500 ms do not increase with 
cumulative exposure to nilotinib. Thus the two analyses are consistent and confirm that the risk from 
QT prolongation does not increase with duration of exposure.  
Bleeding-related events are not uncommon in a bone marrow disorder like CML. Gastrointestinal tract 
bleedings and CNS bleedings are also well recognized complication in this severely ill population. 
Haematologic toxicity is known from other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs: imatinib, dasatinib) and 
was reversible after 2-3 weeks of study drug discontinuation. As expected and partly caused by the 
progressing underlying disease, haematological toxicity was more pronounced in CML-AP patients 
compared to CML-CP patients. 
Elevation in serum lipase, not observed in preclinical toxicology studies, was an unexpected safety 
finding in the target population and was observed in an overall 2.7% CTC grade 4. However it was 
©EMEA 2007 
43/52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinically manageable in the majority of CML-CP and CML-AP patients. Caution is recommended in 
patients with previous history of pancreatitis and a warning has been included in sections 4.2 and 4.4 
of the SPC. Additionally bilirubin and hepatic transaminases levels should be tested monthly or as 
clinically indicated. For Grade 3-4 bilirubin elevations, doses should be reduced to 400 mg once daily 
or interrupted as specified in section 4.2 of the SPC. 
Clinical studies were not performed in patients with impaired renal function. Clinical studies excluded 
patients  with  serum  creatinine  concentration  >  1.5  times  the  upper  limit  of  the  normal  range.  Since 
nilotinib  and  its  metabolites  are  not  renally  excreted,  a  decrease  in  total  body  clearance  is  not 
anticipated in patients with renal impairment. A warning has been included in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of 
the SPC. 
Nilotinib was not investigated in patients with hepatic impairment. Caution is recommended in these 
patients  and  a  warning  has  been  included  in  sections  4.2  and  4.4.  The  applicant  has  committed  to 
perform a post-authorization study in patients with hepatic impairment. 
There are no adequate data on the use of nilotinib in pregnant women. Studies in animals show that 
nilotinib while not genotoxic or teratogenic, was embryolethal and produced foetotoxicity in embryo-
foetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses that also produced maternal toxicity. Thus, 
nilotinib should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If the drug is used during 
pregnancy, the patient must be informed of the potential risk to the foetus and women of childbearing 
potential must be advised to use effective contraception during treatment. In addition, it is not known 
whether nilotinib is excreted in human milk. Studies in animals demonstrate that it is excreted into 
breast milk. Women should therefore not breastfeed while taking nilotinib. A warning regarding 
pregnancy and lactation has been included in section 4.6 of the SPC. 
Nilotinib is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to a lack 
of data on safety and efficacy. A warning has been included in section 4.2 of the SPC. 
Approximately 30% of subjects in clinical studies were 65 years of age or over. No major differences 
were observed for safety and efficacy in patients ≥ 65 years of age as compared to adults aged 18 to 65 
years.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application is of the opinion that the 
following risk minimisation activities are necessary for the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product:  See as detailed in section 2.3 
6.  Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance  of the product were investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no 
unresolved quality issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Nilotinib is a potent inhibitor of the ABL tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein both 
in cell lines and in primary Philadelphia-chromosome positive leukaemia cells. The substance binds 
with high affinity to the ATP-binding site in such a manner that it is a potent inhibitor of wild-type 
BCR-ABL and maintains activity against 32/33 imatinib-resistant mutant forms of BCR-ABL. As a 
consequence of this biochemical activity, nilotinib selectively inhibits the proliferation and induces 
apoptosis in cell lines and in primary Philadelphia-chromosome positive leukaemia cells from CML 
patients. In murine models of CML, as a single agent nilotinib reduces tumour burden and prolongs 
survival following oral administration. 
Nilotinib has little or no effect against the majority of other protein kinases examined, including Src, 
except for the PDGF, Kit and Ephrin receptor kinases, which it inhibits at concentrations within the 
range achieved following oral administration at therapeutic doses recommended for the treatment of 
CML 
Nilotinib did not have effects on CNS or respiratory functions. In vitro cardiac safety studies 
demonstrated a preclinical signal for QT prolongation, based upon block of hERG currents and 
prolongation of the action potential duration in isolated rabbit hearts by nilotinib. No effects were seen 
in ECG measurements in dogs or monkeys treated for up to 39 weeks or in a special telemetry study in 
dogs. 
Repeated-dose toxicity studies in dogs of up to 4 weeks’ duration and in cynomolgus monkeys of up 
to 9 months’ duration revealed the liver as the primary target organ of toxicity of nilotinib. Alterations 
included increased alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activity and histopathology 
findings (mainly sinusoidal cell or Kupffer cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy, bile duct hyperplasia and 
periportal fibrosis). In general the changes in clinical chemistry were fully reversible after a four-week 
recovery period and the histological alterations showed partial reversibility. Exposures at the lowest 
dose levels at which the liver effects were seen were lower than the exposure in humans at a dose of 
800 mg/day. Only minor liver alterations were seen in mice or rats treated for up to 26 weeks. Mainly 
reversible increases in cholesterol levels were seen in rats, dogs and monkeys. 
Genotoxicity studies in bacterial in vitro systems and in mammalian in vitro and in vivo systems with

and without metabolic activation did not reveal any evidence for a mutagenic potential of nilotinib. 
Carcinogenicity studies with nilotinib have not been performed. 
Nilotinib did not induce teratogenicity, but did show embryo- and foetotoxicity at doses that also 
showed maternal toxicity. Increased post-implantation loss was observed in both the fertility study, 
which involved treatment of both males and females, and the embryotoxicity study, which involved 
treatment of females. Embryo-lethality and foetal effects (mainly decreased foetal weights, skeletal 
malformations (fused maxilla/zygomatic) visceral and skeletal variations) in rats and increased 
resorption of foetuses and skeletal variations in rabbits were present in the embryotoxicity studies. 
Exposure to nilotinib in females at No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Levels was generally less or equal to 
that in humans at 800 mg/day. No effects on sperm count/motility or on fertility were noted in male 
and female rats up to the highest tested dose, approximately 5 times the recommended dosage for 
humans. 
Nilotinib was shown to absorb light in the UV-B and UV-A range, is distributed into the skin and 
showed a phototoxic potential in vitro, but no effects have been observed in vivo. Therefore the risk 
that nilotinib causes photosensitisation in patients is considered very low. 
Efficacy 
Efficacy claimed for nilotinib in adult patients for the orphan indications: CML-Chronic Phase (CML-
CP) and CML-Accelerated Phase (CML-AP) in patients who are resistant to or intolerant to imatinib 
was based on the basis of two pivotal phase II studies (study 2101E2, study 2101E1). This application 
is made on the basis of updated interim analyses in both studies and the final analysis reports. 
The primary endpoint for patients with CML-CP was major cytogenetic response (complete or partial) 
(MCyR). The efficacy data of the pivotal study arm of patients (n=132) and the overall enrolment 
(n=320) were based on a mean nilotinib exposure of 460 and 341 days respectively. The best MCyR 
response was 44.7% (59/132), 95% CI 36.0-53.6 for the primary enrolment population and 48.8% 
(156/320), 95% CI 43.2-54.4 for the overall enrolment population. The complete haematologic 
response (CHR) rate was 70.9% for CML-CP patients without CHR at baseline. 
The primary endpoint for patients with CML-AP was CHR. The efficacy data of the pivotal study arm 
of patients (n=64) and the overall enrolment (n=119) were based on a mean nilotinib exposure of 211 
and  202  days  respectively.  The  best  CHR  was  51.6%  (33/64),  95%  CI  38.7-64.2  for  the  primary 
enrolment  population  and  42.0%  (50/119),  95%  CI  33.0-51.4  for  the  overall  enrolment  population. 
The MCyR rate was 31.3% (95% CI: 20.2% - 44.1%) for patients with CML-AP. 
Safety 
The present review refers to a total of 438 patients who were exposed to nilotinib. The most frequent 
study drug-related AEs in the overall population and in the CML-CP patients were thrombocytopenia 
(25.8%), rash (28.3%), pruritus (23.6%), nausea (22.3%), fatigue (19.8%), headache (17.6%), 
neutropenia (13.8%) and diarrhoea (10.4%). In CML-AP patients, the most frequent study drug-
related AEs were thrombocytopenia (31.7%), neutropenia (20%), rash (20.8%), pruritus (17.5%), 
anaemia (15%) and constipation (10.8%). Lipase was increased in 11.6% of patients and bilirubin in 
5.7% of patients.  
A majority of CML patients experienced severe AEs during the course of the study with 69.5% of 
CML-CP patients and 67.5% of CML-AP patients presenting CTC grade 3 or 4 AEs. The most 
frequently reported CTC grade 3 or 4 AEs overall included thrombocytopenia (25.3%), neutropenia 
(16.7%), anaemia (8.7%) and increased lipase (7.5%). In CML-CP patients, the most frequent SAEs 
were thrombocytopenia (2.8%), neutropenia (1.9%), and myocardial infarction (1.3%). In CML-AP 
patients, the most frequent SAEs were thrombocytopenia (7.5%), neutropenia (6.7%) and pneumonia 
(5.0%). 3 Patients (0,8%) were reported with pancreatitis as SAE. 
A high number of patients in the phase II study experienced QTc prolongations from baseline of 
> 30 msec (39.6%). QTcF increases of > 60 msec were reported in 2.9%. The risk of sudden deaths 
observed in patients receiving nilotinib is 0.36%.

From the safety database, all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Having considered the safety concerns in the risk management plan, the CHMP considered that the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these.

Risk-benefit assessment 
The  efficacy  of  nilotinib  in  CML-CP  and  CML-AP  has  been  sufficiently  documented  as  regards  to 
generally accepted surrogate endpoints and durability of the response.  
The  risk  of  sudden  cardiac  death  was  assessed  in  CML  patients  taking  nilotinib.  Results  from  PD 
studies and clinical trials showed that the risk over time for patients on nilotinib for a baseline increase 
in QTcF of > 30 msec is 15-30% and for a > 60 msec increase is 0.3-3%, without a cumulative trend. 
The present risk benefit assessment includes a total of 2,740 patients who were exposed to nilotinib. 
This includes all patient enrolled in clinical studies and compassionate use. In this population, 10 cases 
of sudden cardiac death were reported. Following a review from an external expert cardiologist, 5/10 
cases were classified as ‘possible’ while the remaining 5/10 were considered ‘not related’. The risk of 
sudden  cardiac  death  is  then  0.18%  if  ‘possible’  cases  are  included,  or  0.36%  if  all  the  cases  are 
included.  Although  the  cardiac  risk  is  of  concern,  the  precautionary  measures  proposed  by  the 
applicant indicate that this risk was decreased over time and is manageable. 
Recently the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib (Sprycel) has been approved for the treatment of adults 
with  chronic,  accelerated  or  blast  phase  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  (CML)  with  resistance  or 
intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib mesilate. No data are available for a direct comparison 
of  the  efficacy  and  safety  profiles  of  the  two  agents.  However,  broadly  speaking,  the  efficacy  of 
nilotinib in chronic and accelerated phases appears to be in the range of what described for dasatinib in 
these  disease  stages.  Concerning  safety,  the  cardiac  risk  of  nilotinib  was  of  concern.  The  applicant 
showed that this risk seems to decrease over time and that precautionary measures may make this risk 
acceptable. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131)  Pharmacovigilance activities, in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance, are needed 
to investigate further some of the safety concerns 
(cid:131)  Additional risk minimisation activities are required, (see as detailed in section 2.3) 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The  CHMP  is  of  the  opinion  that  Tasigna  is  similar  to  Glivec  within  the  meaning  of  Article  3  of 
Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  847/200.  See  appendix  5.1.  Tasigna  and  Glivec  share  the  same 
principal  molecular  structural  features,  both  containing  a  N-(2-methylphenyl)-4(3-pyridinyl)-2-
pyrimidinamine part, rendering half of the molecules identical. In addition, due to the flexibility and 
reversibility of amide bridges, the common part may be extended to include the phenyl group linked to 
the amide bridge. If a molecule is 50% identical with the possibility of even more additional similarity 
it is enough to conclude structural similarity. 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Tasigna is not similar to Sprycel within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  847/200.  See  appendix  5.2.  Tasigna  and  Sprycel  do  not share  the 
same principal molecular structural features and the only major common element is the aniline-amide

portion of the molecules, which corresponds to 22% of Tasigna and to 24% of Sprycel as assessed by 
molecular weight. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus  that  the  risk-benefit  balance  of  Tasigna  in  the  “treatment  of  adults  with  chronic  and 
accelerated  phase  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  chronic  myelogenous  leukaemia  (CML)  with 
resistance  or  intolerance  to  prior  therapy  including  imatinib.  Efficacy  data  in  patients  with  CML  in 
blast  crisis  are  not  available.”  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation. 
In addition, the CHMP, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation EC No 141/2000, considers Tasigna 
not to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 847/2000) to Sprycel for 
the same therapeutic indication. 
In addition, the CHMP, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation EC No 141/2000, considers Tasigna 
to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 847/2000) to Glivec for the 
same therapeutic indication. However, the holder of the marketing authorisation for Glivec has given 
his consent to the applicant.

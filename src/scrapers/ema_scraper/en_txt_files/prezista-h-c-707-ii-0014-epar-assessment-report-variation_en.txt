Introduction 
This  submission  pertains  to  the  Specific  Obligation (SO2  003.2): The  data  of  the  48  week  (primary 
analysis) final study report from study TMC114-C214 (A randomised, controlled, open-label trial to 
compare  the  efficacy,  safety  and  tolerability  of  TMC114/RTV  versus  LPV/RTV  in  treatment-
experienced  HIV-1  infected  patients)  should  be  presented  within  a  Type  II  variation  to  extend  the 
indication to the patient population studied, as appropriate. 
Prezista was granted a conditional marketing authorisation (MA), which means that the MAH has to 
fulfil a number of SOs prior to requesting the switching to a full MA. A conditional MA is valid for 
one year only and needs therefore to be renewed annually. During the first renewal the MAH already 
presented  data  of  one  of the  specific  obligations:  The  48  week  (primary  analysis)  final  study  report 
from Study TMC114-C214. The CHMP concluded then that the MAH should file a type II variation 
for  inclusion  of  ‘treatment  experienced’  patients  in  the  indication.  Up  until  now  Prezista  is  only 
indicated  for  highly  experienced  adult  patients  who  failed  more  than  one  regimen  containing  a 
protease inhibitor. 
Study TMC114-C214 (TITAN) is a randomised, controlled, open-label multi centre trial to compare 
the  efficacy,  safety  and 
the 
pharmacokinetic enhancer ritonavir (RTV) versus Kaletra (lopinavir; LPV co-formulated with RTV), 
both in  combination  with an  optimised  background  regimen  (OBR)  in  treatment-experienced  HIV-1 
infected patients. The duration of the trial is 96 weeks. The Week 48 primary analysis is submitted in 
support of the current variation. The week 96 final study report is due by March 2009. 
tolerability  of  darunavir  (DRV)  administered 
together  with 
The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate non-inferiority in efficacy of DRV/RTV versus 
LPV/RTV at 48 weeks, when administered in combination with an individualised OBR.  
The MAH proposed the following extension and changes in the approved indication: 
“PREZISTA,  co-administered  with  100  mg  ritonavir  is  indicated  in  combination  with  other 
antiretroviral  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV-1) 
infection in treatment-experienced highly pre-treated adult patients who failed more than one regimen 
containing a protease inhibitor (PI).”… 
The proposed posology is  the same as for the presently approved indication. Consequential changes 
for section 5.1 of the SPC were also proposed. 
2. 
Clinical aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. The MAH has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out 
in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.1  Methods 
2.1.1  Design  
This  is  a  randomised,  controlled,  open-label  multi-centre  trial  to  compare  the  efficacy,  safety  and 
tolerability DRV/RTV versus LPV/RTV (both in combination with an OBR) in treatment-experienced 
HIV-1 infected patients. The duration of the trial is 96 weeks. Primary efficacy analyses for this trial 
were performed when all patients had reached 48 weeks of treatment or discontinued earlier (cut-off 
date of 17-01-2007). 
Treatment-experienced  (but  LPV-,  DRV-,  tipranavir  (TPV),  and  enfuvirtide  (ENF)-naïve),  HIV-1 
infected patients with viral load > 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml were to be randomised. Patients had to 
be  on  their  current  highly  active  antiretroviral  therapy  regimen  (HAART)  for  at  least  12  weeks.  At 
baseline, patients changed their HAART. An optimised background regimen (OBR) consisting of at 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
least  2  antiretrovirals  (Nucleoside/Nucleotide  Reverse  Transcriptase  Inhibitors  (NRTIs)  with  or 
without  Non-Nucleoside  Reverse  Transcriptase  Inhibitors  (NNRTIs)),  and  the  patients  were 
randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  a  new  Protease  Inhibitor  (PI)  regimen  consisting  of  either 
DRV/RTV (600/100 mg twice daily; b.i.d.) or LPV/RTV (400/100 mg b.i.d.). 
The trial included a screening period of 4 weeks, a 96-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow-up 
period.  Patients  meeting  the  per  protocol  defined  criteria  for  virological  failure  (DRV/RTV  or 
LPV/RTV group), or who experienced a grade 4 adverse event (AE) or confirmed grade 4 (or specific 
grade  3)  laboratory  abnormality1  considered  at  least  possibly  related  to  LPV/RTV  treatment  could 
enter a rollover phase during which all patients received DRV/RTV. 
The primary objective of this trial was to demonstrate non-inferiority in efficacy of DRV/RTV versus 
LPV/RTV at 48 weeks, when administered in combination with an individualised OBR.  
In  addition,  safety,  tolerability,  durability  of  efficacy,  quality  of  life,  pharmacokinetics,  effects  of 
covariates, and pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic relationships over 96 weeks were assessed. 
Study Participants  
• 
Patients had to be on their current highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen (HAART) for at least 
12  weeks.  Initially,  patients  on  a  structured  treatment  interruption  (STI)  of  at  least  4  weeks  were 
permitted  to  be  enrolled.  When  the  protocol  was  subsequently  amended,  patients  on  a  STI  were 
excluded. 
Main inclusion criteria were: 
a.  Male or female, aged 18 years or older. 
b.  Treatment with current HAART regimen for ≥ 12 weeks. 
c.  Pre-screening  and  screening  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  >  1000  copies/ml  (assayed  by  RNA  PCR 
standard specimen procedure) on current HAART regimen. 
Main exclusion criteria were: 
a.  Active  AIDS-defining  illness  with  the  following  exceptions:  stable  cutaneous  Kaposi’s 
sarcoma or wasting syndrome. 
b.  Previous or current use of LPV, ENF, TPV or DRV. 
c.  Use of any non-ARV investigational agents within 90 days prior to screening. 
d.  Use of disallowed concomitant therapy. 
e.  Pregnant or breastfeeding. 
f.  Patients  with  clinical  or  laboratory  evidence  of  significantly  decreased  hepatic  function  or 
decompensation (i.e., liver insufficiency), irrespective of liver enzyme levels. 
g.  Subjects with a grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality as defined by DAIDS grading tables, with 
the  following  exceptions  unless  clinical  assessment  foresaw  an  immediate  health  risk  to  the 
subject: 
•  Pre-existing diabetes, or asymptomatic grade 3 or 4 glucose elevations; 
•  Asymptomatic grade 3 or 4 triglyceride or cholesterol elevations. 
h.  Previously  demonstrated  clinically  significant  allergy  or  hypersensitivity  to  any  of  the 
excipients of the study medication DRV, LPV or RTV. 
Treatments 
• 
After the screening period in which patients continued HAART regimen (4 weeks) in both groups the 
treatments were as follows: 
1 according to the DAIDS scale 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                      
Control Group 
(LPV/RTV) 
Treatment period (96 weeks): 
OBR  consisting  of  ≥  2  ARVs  (NRTIs  with  or  without  NNRTIs)  and  LPV/RTV 
400/100  mg  b.i.d.  given  as  three  133.3/33.3-mg  capsules  or  two  200/50mg 
(Meltrex) tablets per intake once Meltrex tablets became available*. 
In case an NNRTI such as EFV or nevirapine (NVP) was included in the OBR, to 
compensate  for  the  expected  decrease  in  plasma  levels  caused  by  the  co-
administration, an increased LPV/RTV dosage was required: 
- capsule formulation: LPV/RTV 533/133 mg (4 capsules) b.i.d.; 
- tablet formulation: LPV/RTV 600/150 mg (3 tablets) b.i.d. 
*Once a patient had switched from the capsule to the tablet formulation, the patient had to remain on the tablet 
formulation for the remaining treatment period. Patients randomised to LPV/RTV subsequent to availability of 
the tablets, initiated therapy with the tablet formulation. 
DRV/RTV ** 
Group 
Treatment period (96 weeks): 
OBR  consisting  of  ≥  2  ARVs  (NRTIs  with  or  without  NNRTIs)  and  DRV/RTV 
600/100 mg b.i.d. given as: two 300-mg tablets of DRV + one 100-mg capsule of 
RTV per intake. 
** DRV/RTV to be taken orally within 30 minutes after completion of a meal, every 12 hours. 
• 
Endpoints 
Efficacy 
The primary endpoint was virological response, defined as the percentage of patients with confirmed 
plasma viral load < 400 copies/ml at Week 48 (using the TLOVR algorithm).  
The TLOVR (time to loss of virological response) algorithm: response and loss of response had to be 
confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and patients who prematurely discontinued were considered as non-
responders  after  withdrawal.  Patients  with  intermittent  missing  viral  load  values  were  considered 
responders  if  the  preceding  and  succeeding  visits  indicated  response.  In  all  other  cases,  intermittent 
values were imputed with non-response. 
Secondary endpoints included: 
-  Virological response defined as a viral load < 50 copies/ml (using the TLOVR algorithm); 
-  Virological  response  defined  as  a  decrease  in  viral  load  of  ≥  1.0  log10  compared  with  the 
baseline value (TLOVR); 
- 
Immunologic parameters (CD4+ cell count (absolute and %) and CD8+ cell count (absolute 
and %).  
-  Compare  the  Quality  of  Life  (QoL)  questionnaire  results.  QoL  questionnaire  had  to  be 
completed  by  the  patient  if  a  validated  translated  version  was  available.  The  Functional 
Assessment of HIV Infection (FAHI) QoL questionnaire was used. 
Safety 
Safety  evaluations  included  AEs,  clinical  laboratory  tests,  biochemistry,  haematology,  coagulation 
tests, urine analysis, hepatitis, serology/viraemia, blood pressure, ECG readings (performed by central 
ECG Lab.). The ECG parameters analysed were heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QT 
interval,  QTcB  (QT  interval  corrected  for  heart  rate  according  to  Bazett),  and  QTcF  (QT  interval 
corrected  for  heart  rate  according  to  Fridericia).  Vital  signs  included  pulse,  systolic  blood  pressure 
(SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

Resistance determinations 
Viral  pheno-  and  genotype  determinations  were  performed  by  Virco  BVBA,  by  means  of  the 
Antivirogram and VircoTYPE HIV-1, respectively. 
The number of all protease (PR) mutations (primary PI mutations, PI resistance-associated mutations 
[RAMs],  DRV  RAMs,  and  LPV  RAMs  as  defined  by  the  International  AIDS  Society  (IAS)-USA 
guidelines, and PI mutations as defined by FDA [FDA-defined PI RAMs]), and number of all reverse 
transcriptase (RT) mutations (NRTI RAMs and NNRTI RAMs as defined by the IAS-USA guidelines, 
and  extended  NNRTI  RAMs)  were  tabulated  per  treatment  group.  The  incidence  of  all  individual 
protease and RT mutations was also tabulated. 
The  FC  measured  by  Antivirogram  was  analysed,  and  categorised  into  ‘susceptible’  or  ’resistant’ 
based on cut-off values. A drug was considered susceptible if the FC was below or equal to the clinical 
cut-off when this was available (i.e., LPV, TDF, abacavir [ABC], TPV, and DRV), or below or equal 
to the biological cut-off otherwise. 
The  FC  measured  by  VircoTYPE  was  also  analysed.  For  each  drug,  FC  was  categorised  into 
‘susceptible/maximal response’, ‘reduced response’ and ’resistant/minimal response’ based on cut-off 
values. To get an idea of the overall sensitivity to a class of drugs (NRTIs, PIs, NNRTIs, all ARV), a 
total sensitivity score was calculated as the sum of continuous phenotypic sensitivity scores (CPSS) of 
the individual drugs in the corresponding class. 
Sample size 
• 
Assuming a virological response (confirmed viral load < 400 copies/ml) rate of 70% at 48 weeks in 
both  treatment  arms,  229  patients  were  required  per  treatment  arm  to  establish  non-inferiority  of 
DRV/RTV  versus  LPV/RTV  with  a  maximum  allowable  difference  (delta)  of  12%,  with  a  1-sided 
significance  level  of  α  =  0.025  and  80%  power.  To  account  for  an  approximate  10%  of  patients 
expected  to  be  excluded  for  the  on-protocol  analysis,  a  total  of  500  HIV-1  positive  patients  were 
needed  in  the  trial,  250  per  treatment  group.    However,  95  supplementary  patients  were  recruited 
compared to what was planned per protocol. This was due to the high rate of enrolment in particular 
during the last month of recruitment for the trial.  
A delta of 12 % was considered appropriate, as it was small relative to observed differences between 
LPV/RTV and other active regimen or between other ARTs in a similar patient population.  
Randomisation  
• 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with DRV/RTV or LPV/RTV and according to 
stratification for: 
- 
- 
use of an NNRTI in the OBR (yes/no) (due to potential interaction that impacts on PI plasma 
levels) 
screening plasma viral load (< 50,000 or ≥ 50,000 copies/ml) 
A  central  randomisation  system  was  used.  Randomisation  was  done  by  a  predefined  randomisation 
list,  constructed  via  random  permuted  blocks  to  ensure  balance  across  treatments  groups  in  each 
stratum of the 2 stratification factors. 
Blinding  
• 
No blinding took place (open-label). The MAH justified this by referring to a very high pill burden for 
patients.  
Statistical methods 
• 
The present primary efficacy analysis was performed when all patients in this trial reached Week 48 or 
discontinued  earlier.  All  statistical  tests  were  interpreted  at  the  1-sided  2.5%  or  equivalently  at  the 
95% 2-sided significance level, unless specified differently. 
The primary objective analysis was to demonstrate non-inferiority in virological response defined as a 
confirmed plasma viral load of < 400 copies/ml with DRV/RTV 600/100 mg b.i.d. versus LPV/RTV 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
400/100 mg b.i.d. at Week 48 with a delta/ non-inferiority margin of 12%. Secondary objectives were 
to  evaluate  other  virological  and  immunologic  parameters,  to  compare  the  QoL,  and  to  evaluate 
pharmacokinetics, effects of covariates, and pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic relationships, as well 
as safety and tolerability over time.  
In  case  non-inferiority  was  concluded,  superiority  in  virological  response  defined  as  a  confirmed 
plasma viral load of < 400 copies/ml with DRV/RTV 600/100 mg b.i.d. versus LPV/RTV 400/100 mg 
b.i.d. at Week 48 was assessed. 
Two populations were defined for analysis: 
- 
Intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population:  all  patients  who  where  randomised  and  who  received  trial 
medication, regardless of their compliance with the Protocol.  
-  On-protocol (OP) population: all randomised patients who received trial medication, and who 
did  not  take  any  disallowed  ARV  medication  as  described  in  the  Protocol  for  >  1  week;  in 
addition,  patients  who  were  not  compliant  for  the  trial  medication  for  >  4  weeks  were 
excluded. 
The primary population for testing the primary efficacy parameter was the OP population. 
A  logistic  regression  model,  including  baseline  log10  plasma  viral  load  as  covariate  and  use  of  an 
NNRTI  in  OBR  (‘as  used’,  not  ‘as  stratified’)  as  factor,  was  applied  to  estimate  the  difference  in 
virological  response  rate  (defined  as  a  confirmed  plasma  viral  load  <  400  copies/ml  [TLOVR]) 
between  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV.  For  this  purpose,  95%  2-sided  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  were 
derived to compare treatment groups at all time points.  
The  main  comparison  was  at  Week  48:  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  2-sided  CI  of  the  difference 
between  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV  did  not  exceed  -12%  (for  the  OP  population),  non-inferiority  of 
DRV/RTV versus LPV/RTV was concluded. In case non-inferiority was concluded and the lower limit 
of the 95% 2-sided CI of the difference between DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV exceeded 0 (for the ITT 
population), superiority of DRV/RTV versus LPV/RTV could be concluded. Additionally, a 95% CI 
of the difference in proportion of response between the 2 treatments was derived by means of a normal 
approximation of the binomial distribution. 
In addition, several sensitivity analyses were performed e.g. observed response defined as a viral load 
< 400 copies/ml (without requiring confirmation of response or loss of response), and NC = F (non-
completer  is  failure  analysis).  In  addition,  the  impact  on  the  conclusions  of  discontinuation  due  to 
patient wish (DCPW; non compliance, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow-up) was assessed by a 
last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  analysis,  i.e.,  the  last  observed  virological  response  was 
carried forward to Week 48 for patients discontinuing due to patient wish.

a   One patient received both DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV. 
b   Additionally taking into account one patient who discontinued due to an AE (diarrhoea) after 17 January 2007, 
the cut-off date for the current analysis. 
The overall discontinuation rate (for any reason) was lower in the DRV/RTV group (21%) than in the 
LPV/RTV group (29%). The majority of discontinuations was due to AE/HIV related events (7%), or 
virological  failure  (6%).  Discontinuation  due  to  AE/HIV-related  events  occurred  with  similar 
frequency  in  both  treatment  groups  (7%);  discontinuations  due  to  virological  failure  occurred  less 
frequently in the DRV/RTV group (1%) than in the LPV-RTV group (11%).  
Up to Week 24, the number of patients in the trial was similar for both treatment groups; at Week 24, 
this was 91% for both treatment groups. At Weeks 36 and 48, the number of patients remaining in the 
trial  was  higher  in  the  DRV/RTV  group  than  in  the  LPV/RTV  group:  87%  versus  83%,  and  85% 
versus 77%, respectively. This was mainly due to a higher rate of discontinuations due to virological 
failure in the LPV/RTV group compared to the DRV/RTV Group. 
At the time of database cut-off, 79.2% of  DRV/RTV-treated patients and 71.0% of LPV/RTV-treated 
control patients were still in the trial. The mean duration of exposure for the respective treatment groups 
was 53.5 and 51.5 weeks.  
Compliance  
Compliance  was  generally  high  in  both  treatment  groups.    The  proportion  of  patients  with  DRV 
plasma concentrations below the detection limit was ≤ 5%, and the proportion of patients with LPV 
plasma concentrations below the detection limit was ≤ 6% at all time points.

N = number of patients; n = number of observations. 
The  trial  included  patients  who  were  not  highly  ART-experienced.  This  ranged  from  patients  who 
were  NNRTI  (23.7%)  or  PI  naïve  (31.4%)  to  those  who  had  been  experienced  to  ≥  2  PIs  (31.1%). 
Approximately half of the patients had received ≥ 4 previous NRTIs.  The median FC (fold change in 
EC50)  for  DRV  and  LPV  was  0.6  and  0.7,  demonstrating  a  relatively  low  overall  PI  resistance. 
At baseline 32.0% of the patients in trial TMC114-C214 had ≥ 1 primary PI mutation and 9.4% had 1 
DRV  resistance-associated  mutation  (RAM).    The  median  number  of  primary  PI  mutations  was  0 
(range: 0 - 6); the median number of PI RAMs was 4 (range: 0 - 17). The median number of DRV 
RAMs and LPV RAMs was 0 (range: 0 - 5) and 1 (range: 0 - 11), respectively.

There were no notable differences between the treatment groups with respect to susceptibility to PIs, 
NRTIs and NNRTIs at baseline, or with respect to the number of susceptible PIs, NRTIs, or NNRTIs 
used in the screening ART, or underlying OBR. Most patients (87.5%) were able to use ≥ 1 NRTIs in 
the OBR to which the virus was susceptible. 
There  were  no  relevant  differences  between  the  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV  treatment  groups  with 
respect to the ARV therapies used in the initial OBR. The overwhelming majority of patients (90%) 
used  only  NRTIs  in  the  OBR.  The  majority  of  patients  used  2  or  3  NRTIs  (69%  and  25%, 
respectively);  the  three  combinations  emtricitabine  (FTC)  and  tenofovir  (TDF)  (11%),  lamivudine 
(3TC) and zidovudine (AZT) (10%) and 3TC, TDF and AZT (12%) were most frequently used. 
Concomitant disease 
In  addition  to  the  cases  of  co-infection  with  hepatitis  B  or  C,  the  incidence  of  other  concomitant 
diseases  at  screening  was  high  in  both  treatment  groups.    The  most  common  were  dermatologic 
conditions (29%)  and  conditions related  to  the  gastrointestinal (GI)  system  (29%). These  conditions 
were noted more frequently in the DRV/RTV group than in the LPV/RTV group (34% versus 23%, 
and 34% versus 24%, respectively). There were no other relevant differences between the DRV/RTV 
and LPV/RTV treatment groups with respect to the concomitant diseases reported at screening. Eleven 
percent of all patients (10% and 13% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, respectively) 
had a history of sulfonamide allergy. 
2.2  Efficacy 
Primary endpoint  
The percentage of patients with confirmed plasma viral load < 400 copies/ml at Week 48 in the OP 
population  was  77%  for  the  DRV/RTV  group  and  68%  for  the  LPV/RTV  group.  The  difference  in 
virological response [95% CI] between the treatment groups was 9.5 [2.1; 16.9]; the lower limit of the 
95%  CI  of  the  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  was  >  -12%,  therefore,  non-inferiority  of 
DRV/RTV versus LPV/RTV was concluded. The lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference between 
the  treatment  groups  was  also  >  0  (in  support  of  the  pre-defined  superiority  rationale).  Statistical 
comparison  using  the  logistic  regression  model  showed  an  estimated  difference  [95%  CI]  in 
virological response at Week 48 between the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups of 9.1 [1.9; 
16.4], with a p-value confirming non-inferiority of < 0.001. See the following table.

The results obtained for the ITT population were consistent with those of the OP population. 
The  favourable  results  of  DRV/RTV  were  also  reflected  in  the  following  display  of  the  virological 
response (% patients with confirmed plasma viral load < 400 copies/ml at Week 48) according to the 
TLOVR algorithm. Of the 298 DRV/RTV patients, 31 (10.7%) experienced virological failure versus 
65 of 297 (21.2%) LPV/RTV patients. There were less patients with an initial lack of response (7% 
versus  14%  of  patients)  and  less  rebounders  (3%  versus  6%  of  patients)  in  the  DRV/RTV  group 
compared to the LPV/RTV group.

The  different  sensitivity  analyses  indicated  that  the  results  for  virological  response  defined  as  the 
percentage of patients with confirmed viral load < 400 copies/ml were robust and consistent across the 
different populations and imputation methods used. See the following display.

The  MAH  illustrated  also  that  the  virological  response  (percentage  of  patients  with  viral  load 
< 400 copies/ml)  at  Week  48  with  LPV/RTV  was  comparable  with  the  virological  response  rates 
observed  in  previous  trials  performed  with  LPV/RTV  400/100  mg  b.i.d.  in  treatment-experienced 
HIV-1 infected patients.  The difference in virological response at Week 48 between the DRV/RTV 
and LPV/RTV treatment groups was apparently maintained across several subgroups by baseline e.g. 
DRV  FC  and  LPV  FC,  number  of  DRV  and  LPV  RAMs  at  baseline,  STI  at  screening,  number  of 
susceptible NRTIs and susceptible ARVs in the OBR.  See the following table.

It should be noted that for certain subgroups, the number of patients was relatively limited and these 
comparisons should be interpreted with caution.  
Secondary endpoints 
Week 48 results of main secondary virological response parameters such as the percentage of patients 
with  confirmed  plasma  viral  load  <  50  copies/ml,  and  the  percentage  of  patients  with  a  confirmed 
decrease in plasma viral load ≥ 1.0 log10 copies/ml from baseline are displayed in the following two

The different sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results for virological response defined as the 
percentage of patients with confirmed viral load < 50 copies/ml were robust and consistent across the 
different populations and imputation methods used. 
The difference in virological response (viral load < 50 copies/ml) at Week 48 between the DRV/RTV 
and LPV/RTV treatment groups was maintained across several subgroups by baseline e.g. viral load, 
baseline DRV FC and LPV FC, number of DRV and LPV RAMs at baseline, STI at screening, use of 
an NNRTI in the OBR, number of susceptible NRTIs and susceptible ARVs in the OBR.

The  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  showed  that  virological  response  defined  as  plasma  viral  load  <  50 
copies/ml was achieved more frequently in the DRV/RTV group than in the LPV/RTV group, see the 
following figure. The difference between the treatment groups in time to virological response defined 
as plasma viral load < 50 copies/ml was statistically significant (p = 0.0005), with a greater probability 
of responding to DRV/RTV treatment compared to LPV/RTV treatment (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 1.40 
[1.16; 1.68]).

Figure 1  Time  Virological  Response:  Proportion  of  Patients  Achieving  Plasma  Viral  Load 
< 50 copies/ml 
Similar, the Kaplan-Meier estimate showed that the proportion of patients never achieving a plasma 
viral load < 50 copies/ml was smaller in the DRV/RTV group than in the LPV/RTV group, and that 
loss  of  virological  response  over  time  occurred  less  frequently  in  the  DRV/RTV  group  than  in  the 
LPV/RTV group. The difference between the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups in time to 
loss of virological response defined as plasma viral load < 50 copies/ml was statistically significant (p 
=  0.0268),  with  a  smaller  probability  of  failing  under  DRV/RTV  treatment  compared  to  LPV/RTV 
treatment (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.74 [0.56; 0.97]). 
Similar results were obtained for time to loss of virological response defined as a decrease of ≥ 1.0 
log10 versus baseline, where the difference between the treatment groups was statistically significant 
(p = 0.0397),  and  the  hazard  ratio  for  failing  under  DRV/RTV  treatment  relative  to  LPV/RTV 
treatment [95% CI] was 0.73 [0.54; 0.99]. 
Furthermore, the Week 48 mean change in log10 viral load from baseline in the ITT population was -
1.95 and -1.72 log10 copies/ml for the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups, respectively. See 
the following table.

These  results  for  the  mean  viral  load  DAVG  were  similar:  at  Week  48  this  was  -1.96  and  -1.78 
copies/ml for the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV treatment groups, respectively.  
The  majority  of  subjects  harboured  HIV-1  clade  B  (81.8%  and  80.8  %  in  the  DRV/RTV  and 
LPV/RTV group, respectively). Other clades that were found in at least 10 subjects in each treatment 
group were clade C (4.7% and 4.0 % in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV group, respectively) and clade 
CRF01_AE (7.4% and 9.1 % in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV group, respectively). Other clades were 
present  in  less  than  10  subjects  in  each  treatment  group.  It  should  be  noted  that  for  all  the  clades 
except for clade B, the number of subjects was relatively limited and therefore those results should be 
interpreted with caution.

The virologic response in the DRV/RTV group or in the LPV/RTV group in subjects harbouring clade 
C,  clade  CRF01_AE  or  ‘other  clades’  was  not  significantly  different  from  the  response  in  subjects 
harbouring clade B. 
Influence of the number of DRV or LPV RAMs on virological response.  
A  diminished  virological  response  rate  defined  by  the  %  of  patients  with  confirmed  viral  load  < 
400 copies/ml at Week 48 (TLOVR [Non-VF Censored]) was observed for the DRV/RTV subgroup of 
patients  with  ≥  3  DRV  RAMs  (60%,  representing  <  75%  of  the  overall  response  rate  for  the 
DRV/RTV group). The same was observed for the LPV/RTV subgroups of patients with 2 or ≥ 3 DRV 
RAMs (36% and 46%, respectively, representing < 75% of the overall response rate for the LPV/RTV 
group). The median number of IAS-USA PI RAMs was 3 and 4 for the subgroups of patients with no 
DRV RAMs at baseline in the DRV/RTV or LPV/RTV groups, respectively. A higher median number 
of IAS-USA PI RAMs (range 8 - 13) was observed for all subgroups of patients with ≥ 1 DRV RAM 
at  baseline.  Note that the number  of  patients in the subgroups  with  >  1  DRV RAM  at  baseline  was 
low. Similar results were observed for virological response defined as the percentage of patients with 
viral load < 50 copies/ml at Week 48 (TLOVR [Non-VF Censored]). See the figures below.

A similar trend was also observed for the mean change in log10 viral load. 
A diminished virological response rate (percentage of patients with viral load < 400 copies/ml at Week 
48) was observed for the LPV/RTV subgroup of patients with ≥ 6 LPV RAMs (41%, representing < 
75% of the overall response rate for the LPV/RTV group). The presence of LPV RAMs at baseline did 
not influence virological response to DRV/RTV, even if the median number of IAS-USA PI RAMs 
was  12  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  ≥  6  LPV  RAMs.  Similar  results  were  seen  for  virological 
response rate defined as percentage of patients with viral load < 50 copies/ml at Week 48 and for mean 
change in log10 viral load. See illustrations below.

Proportionally  fewer  virological  failures  in  the  DRV/RTV  group  than  in  the  LPV/RTV  group 
developed  DRV  RAMs  (18%  versus  23%),  LPV  RAMs  (25%  versus  36%),  IAS-USA  primary  PI 
mutations (21% versus 36%), IAS-USA PI RAMs (36% versus 48%), FDA defined PI mutations (21%

Among the 5 patients in the DRV/RTV group who developed DRV RAMs endpoint, 1 patient had 2 
DRV RAMs at baseline, while the other 4 patients already had ≥ 3 DRV RAMs at baseline. Two of 
these 5 patients were already resistant to DRV (FC > 10) at baseline, and the other 3 patients became 
resistant to DRV after the development of the additional DRV RAMs. All 5 patients were resistant to 
LPV (FC > 10) at baseline.  
Among  the  20  patients  in the  LPV/RTV  group  who developed  LPV  RAMs  at endpoint,  10  patients 
had < 6 LPV RAMs at baseline. Seven patients were already resistant to LPV (FC > 10) at baseline, 
and all other patients except 2 became resistant to LPV after the development of the LPV RAMs.  
Analyses  to  identify  the  protease  mutations  that  developed  in  >  10%  of  virological  failures  on 
DRV/RTV treatment showed that the V32I mutation developed in 11% (3/28) of virological failures.

Fewer  virological  failures  treated  with  DRV/RTV  than  with  LPV/RTV  lost  susceptibility  to  PIs  or 
NRTIs  after  treatment:  4/31  (14%)  patients  in  the  DRV/RTV  group  were  susceptible  to  fewer  PIs 
(excluding DRV) after treatment compared to 18/65 (33%) patients in the LPV/RTV group. See the

QoL- FAHI score 
FAHI  imputed  score  at  baseline  was  rather  high  (124  and  121  for  the  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV 
treatment  groups,  respectively),  leaving  relatively  limited  room  for  improvement.  There  were  no 
statistically or clinically relevant differences between the two treatment groups for the slight observed 
changes.  
Population PK/PD data (These were already assessed in the CHMP renewal AR). 
Of the 298 patients randomised and treated with DRV/RTV, 285 patients with sparse sampling data 
were  included  in  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  for  DRV.    The  Bayesian  estimates  of  the 
DRV pharmacokinetic parameters from the sparse sampling data are summarised in the below table.

The analysis concluded that plasma trough DRV concentrations (C0h) exceeded the predefined target 
trough  concentration  of  550  ng/ml  (based  on  the  EC50  value  for  PI-resistant  HIV-1  strains  when 
corrected for protein binding) in all patients. Results from this analysis confirm previous findings in 
treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected patients following dosing with DRV/RTV 600/100 mg b.i.d. 
Concomitant use of EFV and NVP at baseline, age, and weight did not influence the DRV AUC12h or 
C0h values. A trend toward higher DRV exposure in females (approximately 8%, N = 67) compared to 
males (N = 218), and higher exposure in Blacks (approximately 15%, N = 49) and lower exposure in 
Asian patients (approximately 16%, N = 27) compared to Caucasian patients (N = 154) was observed. 
These differences were not considered clinically relevant. 
No apparent relationships were observed between the DRV pharmacokinetic parameters AUC12h and 
C0h, and the occurrence of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of the trial medication, or rash-, 
cardiac-, GI-, liver-, lipid- and glucose-related AEs, or AEs of the SOCs Nervous System Disorders, 
and Psychiatric Disorders. 
Discussion on Efficacy 
Study C214 demonstrated the non-inferiority of the efficacy of DRV/RTV at the recommended dosage 
of  DRV/RTV  600/100  mg  b.i.d.  compared  to  LPV/RTV  both  in  combination  with  an  OBR  in  the 
studied ART-experienced HIV-1 infected patients based on the primary virological endpoint (i.e. the 
percentage  of  patients  with  confirmed  plasma  viral  load  <  400  copies/ml  at  Week  48  in  the  OP 
population) at the chosen delta of 12%. DRV/RTV was at least as efficacious as LPV/RTV based on 
the  results  for  secondary  virological  and  immunological  response  parameters.  In  this  comparison, 
DRV/RTV treatment appeared to be associated with more favourable virological response as defined 
by the primary endpoint (77% for the DRV/RTV group and 68% for the LPV/RTV group). This was 
also  evident  from  the  results  for  the  percentage  of  patients  with  confirmed  plasma  viral  load 
< 50 copies/ml  at  Week  48  (which  was  a  secondary  endpoint)  and  other  secondary  virological 
parameters.   
Justification  of  the  chosen  non-inferiority  margin  was  based  on  trials  with  other  PIs  and  not  on  a 
discussion  of  potential  clinical  relevance  in  the  context  of  morbidity  or  survival.  However,  the 
observed lower bound of the 95% CI was > -10% and therefore there is no reason for concern in that 
regard.  
Virological response tends to decrease over time at least partly due to viral resistance associated with 
RAM,  as  noted  also  in  the  original  pre-registration  assessment  for  the  highly  pre-treated  HIV-1 
infected patients. The results of the Week 96 of the present ongoing trial are of interest for the further 
evaluation  of  the  development  of  resistance and  evaluation  of  the  long-term  safety  of  DRV/RTV in 
this  HIV-1  infected  population.  In  this  regard  there  is  an  ongoing  FUM,  to  which  the  MAH 
committed;  in  this  context,  the  MAH  should  also  present  the  virologic  response  by  clade  (see  also 
Letter of Undertaking).  
The  submitted  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  did  not  reveal  unexpected  findings.  Some  small 
differences in plasma concentrations were observed between studied groups, but this is considered not 
clinically relevant. 
2.3  Safety 
Trial  TMC114-C214  showed  that  the  overall  AE  profile  of  DRV/RTV  600/100  mg  b.i.d.  was 
comparable to that of LPV/RTV 400/100 mg b.i.d, which represents a standard of care for treatment-

LPV/RTV and rash which was more frequent with DRV/RTV, the incidence of the most common AEs 
was comparable for the 2 treatment groups. See the following table.

The  incidence  of  cardiac-related  AEs  was  generally  comparable  for  the  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV 
groups. Heart-failure-related AEs were reported in 0.3% and 1% of patients in the respective treatment 
groups, ischemia-related AEs in 0.3% and 2%, and rhythm disturbance- or ECG- related AEs in 6% 
and 5%, respectively. The most frequent cardiac-related AE by preferred term was ECG QTc interval 
prolonged (2% and 0.3% with DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV, respectively). All other cardiac-related AEs 
occurred in ≤ 1% of patients in the DRV/RTV and/or LPV/RTV group.  
QTcF values of > 500 ms were not observed. QTcB values of > 500 ms were observed in 2% and 1% 
of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, respectively. Increases in QTcF of > 60 ms were 
observed in 2% and 1% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, respectively. Increases in 
QTcB of > 60 ms were observed in 4% and 2% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, 
respectively.  In  2  DRV/RTV-treated  patients,  an  increase  in  QTcB  of  >  60  ms  resulted  in  a  QTcB 
value of > 500 ms (509 and 502 ms, respectively). No other increases in QTc of > 60 ms resulted in 
QTc values of > 500 ms. No patients presented any clinical events related to QTc prolongation. 
The  incidence  of  liver-related  AEs  was  generally  comparable  between  both  treatment  groups.  The 
most frequent liver-related AEs (preferred term) were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (2% 
in  both  groups),  gamma-glutamyl  tranferase  (GGT)  increased  (2%  and  1%  with  DRV/RTV  and 
LPV/RTV, respectively), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (1% and 3%) and jaundice (1% 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 0%). All other liver-related AEs occurred in < 1 % of patients in the DRV/RTV and/or LPV/RTV 
group. Grade 3 or 4 liver-related AEs occurred in 4% of patients in both treatment groups. 
Hyperbilirubinemia (increase in total bilirubin) was observed less frequently in the DRV/RTV group 
(2%)  than  in  the  LPV/RTV  group  (6%).  Grade  3  or  4  hyperbilirubinemia  was  observed  in  2 
DRV/RTV-treated patients and not in LPV/RTV-treated patients. 
In  both  treatment  groups,  the  overall  incidence  of  liver-related  AEs  was  higher  in  patients  with 
hepatitis  B  or  C  co-infection  (25%  and  24%  with  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV,  respectively)  than  in 
patients not co-infected with hepatitis B or C virus (5% and 4%). 
The  incidence  of  lipid-related  AEs  was  generally  comparable  between  both  treatment  groups.  The 
most  frequent  lipid-related  AEs  (preferred  term)  were  hypertriglyceridaemia  (7%  and  10%  with 
DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV,  respectively),  hypercholesterolaemia  (4%  and  6%),  blood  triglycerides 
increased  (4%  in  both  groups),  blood  cholesterol  increased  (4%  and  3%),  and  hyperlipidaemia  (3% 
and 4%). All other lipid-related AEs occurred in ≤ 2 % of patients in the DRV/RTV and/or LPV/RTV 
group. 
Glucose-related AEs were reported in 3% and 4% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, 
respectively.  None  of  the  glucose-related  AEs  were  reported  in  >  1%  of  patients  in  any  treatment 
group and the incidence of glucose-related AEs was comparable between both treatment groups. One 
patient in the DRV/RTV group permanently discontinued the trial medication due to grade 2 diabetes 
mellitus (possibly related). 
The incidence of increased amylase was higher in the DRV/RTV group (24%) than in the LPV/RTV 
group  (17%);  the  incidence  of  increased  lipase  and  creatinine  was  comparable  for  both  treatment 
groups (8% versus 5%, and 6% versus 8%, respectively). There were no relevant differences between 
the treatment groups in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 abnormalities for amylase (6% versus 3%), lipase 
(2% versus 0.3%), or creatinine (0% for both treatment groups). The increases in amylase and lipase 
were asymptomatic in all cases. 
The incidence of haematology laboratory abnormalities was generally comparable for the DRV/RTV 
and LPV/RTV treatment groups. The majority of haematology abnormalities in this trial were grade 1 
or  2.    The  incidence  of  prothrombin  time  (PT)  and  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  (PTT) 
abnormalities was low. Grade 4 increased PT was observed in 1 LPV/RTV-treated patient and not in 
DRV/RTV-treated patients; grade 4 increased PTT was observed in 1% of patients in both treatment 
groups.  Grade  4  decreases  in  haemoglobin  were  observed  in 1% of  patients in  the  LPV/RTV  group 
and not in the DRV/RTV group. There were no grade 3 or 4 decreases for white blood cell (WBC) 
count. Grade 3 decreases in platelet count were observed in 0.3% of patients in the DRV/RTV group 
and  1%  of  patients  in  the  LPV/RTV  group.  Grade  3  or  4  decreases  in  neutrophil  count  were  not 
observed in the DRV/RTV group and in 2% of patients in the LPV/RTV group. 
The incidence of AEs related to urinalysis was low and comparable for the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV 
treatment  groups.  The  most  frequent  AE  related  to  urinalysis  was  haematuria,  reported  in  1%  of 
patients in both treatment groups. No AEs related to urinalysis were grade 3 or 4 in severity. 
Serious Adverse Events were reported in 9% and 10% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV 
treatment groups, respectively. All SAEs, except 2 (anaemia and cardiorespiratory arrest), occurred in 
only 1 patient in the DRV/RTV and/or LPV/RTV group. The SAE anaemia occurred in 2 DRV/RTV-
treated  patients,  and  the  SAE  cardiorespiratory  arrest  occurred  in  2  LPV/RTV-treated  patients.  The 
most  frequent  SAEs  by  SOC  (in  >  1%  of  patients  in  any  treatment  group)  were  Infections  and 
Infestations (3%  and  3%, with  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV,  respectively),  and  Cardiac  Disorders  (0% 
and 2%). 
Seven  percent  of  patients  of  both  treatment  groups  permanently  discontinued  treatment  due  to  ≥  1 
AEs.  The  incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  was  generally  comparable  for  the 
DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV  treatment  groups.  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  were  most 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
commonly from the SOC Gastrointestinal Disorders (2% of patients in both groups), of which the AE 
diarrhoea  (1%  and  2%  with  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV,  respectively)  was  reported  most  frequently, 
and the SOC Investigations (2% in both groups). All other AEs leading to permanent discontinuation 
occurred in ≤ 1% of patients in the DRV/RTV and/or LPV/RTV group. 
AEs  of  all  grades  that  were  considered  at  least  possibly  related  to  DRV/RTV  or  LPV/RTV  were 
reported in 58.7% and 64.3% of patients in the DRV/RTV and LPV/RTV groups, respectively. Grade 
≥  2  AEs  at  least  possibly  related  to  DRV/RTV  or  LPV/RTV  were  reported  in 36.9%  and  40.7%  of 
patients,  respectively.  The  majority  of  grade  ≥  2  AEs  at  least  possibly  related  to  DRV/RTV  or 
LPV/RTV occurred in ≤ 1% of patients in any treatment group.

Discussion on Safety  
The  relative  AE  profile  of  DRV/RTV  emerging  from  this  Week  48  analysis  of  the  study  results  for 
trial  TMC114-C214  indicates  that  DRV/RTV  at  the  recommended  dosage  (as  for  the  highly  pre-
treated patients) for this population is at least similar to the profile of LPV/RTV. The safety results of 
DRV/RTV from this study are in line with the earlier assessment of the safety of DRV/RTV during the 
renewal  procedure  in  which  the  present  results  were  integrated.  An  amendment  of  the  SPC  in  that 
regard is not needed.

Pharmacovigilance  
Risk Management Plan 
The Risk Management Plan (RMP) version 5.0, dated 7 February 2008 was assessed to evaluate the 
need for an update in relation to this extension of indication. 
The MAH conducted a comparative phase III trial TMC114-C214 with 298 less treatment-experienced 
patients on DRV/RTV and 297 less treatment-experienced patients on LPV/RTV. The adverse events 
profile  observed  after  48  weeks  (data  cut-off  date)  was  for  the  most  part  consistent  with  what  is 
already  known  for  DRV  in  (highly)  treatment-experienced  patients.  In  the  DRV/RTV  group,  26.8% 
reported any grade 3 or 4 adverse event. In the SPC of DRV/RTV the percentage of any grade 2, 3, or 
4 adverse events is 30% and 9% of these patients (DRV/RTV) experienced a severe adverse event.  
However,  these  figures  cannot  be  compared  accurately,  because  the  MAH  provided  no  clear  data 
about the percentages of grade 3 and 4 adverse events separately in the study group. In the final study 
report, the MAH has to provide these figures per grade group (see also Letter of Undertaking).  
The  most  common  events  were  diarrhoea  (32%  and  42%  with  DRV/RTV  and  LPV/RTV, 
respectively),  nausea  (18%  and  21%),  nasopharyngitis  (12%  and  11%),  headache  (11%  and  7%), 
infection  (10%  and  7%)  and 
abdominal  pain 
hypertriglyceridaemia (7% and 10%). This is consistent with the already known data for DRV/RTV. 
(10%  and  7%),  upper 
respiratory 
tract 
The incidence and severity of the adverse events do not give cause for changes in the RMP, except for 
the rash-related adverse events. 
In the comparative phase III trial TMC114-C214, the overall frequency of rash-related adverse events 
was  higher  during  treatment  with  DRV/RTV  (16.4%)  than  with  LPV/RTV  (7.1%).  However,  the 
incidence of grade 3 or 4 rash-related events was low in both groups (0.7% vs. 0%), but still higher 
than  the  already  known  percentage  for  DRV/RTV.  Rash  is  reported  in  the  SPC  as  common,  and 
generalised rash, allergic dermatitis, urticaria, pruritus as uncommon.  
Rash-related adverse events, including Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), are already an identified risk 
in the Risk Management Plan. In the complete dataset there have been 4 case reports of SJS, of which 
1 ‘very likely related’, 1 ‘doubtfully related’, and 2 ‘not or doubtfully related’. Also, there is a higher 
incidence  of rash-related  events  in  the less treatment-experienced  patients  on  DRV/RTV than  in  the 
control group.  
The MAH therefore was requested to amend the RMP, section 2.2.1’ Important Identified Risks’: for 
all  rash-related  events  that  have  occurred  with  DRV/RTV.  It  was  also  requested  to  be  recorded 
whether the patients concerned were naïve, highly pre-treated or less pre-treated. The updated version 
7.0 of the RMP dated 31 July 2008 was submitted in eCTD sequence 0079 in the framework of the 
PSUR covering the period PSUR 24 Dec 2007 - 23 Jun 2008.  
The MAH  consequently  has  also  revised  in this  version  of the  RMP the  presentation  of  the  clinical 
data  on  rash-related  events  in  Section  1.5.2.1.1  in  order  to  distinguish the  risk  characteristics  of  the 
pooled safety data (n = 3063 subjects), from the less pre-treated subjects (TITAN trial) and from the 
naïve  subjects  (ARTEMIS  trial).  This  updated  version  is  currently  being  assessed  with  a  CHMP 
conclusion awaited during the November 2008 CHMP meeting.

Changes to the Product Information 
The  CHMP  agreed  to  the  proposed  extension  of  indication  in  section  4.1  of  the  SPC,  however, 
requested  a  slight  rewording  to  highlight  both  the  new  and  the  old  patient  population.  The  MAH 
agreed to this request and updated the SPC in accordance (see also attachment 1).  
Regarding the proposed changes to section 5.1, the CHMP requested that references to superiority of 
DRV/RTV above LPV/RTV should be deleted, as the trial design was aimed at non-inferiority. The 
MAH agreed and revised the section accordingly.  
Also, proposed changes regarding the mention that no new RAM or FC findings of clinical relevance 
were observed were requested to be deleted. The CHMP regarded this information as not informative 
for the prescriber. The MAH agreed and updated section 5.1 accordingly (see also attachment 1). In 
addition, the MAH committed to update the resistance section according to the new template B of the 
revision of the CHMP guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of 
HIV infection.  
The CHMP agreed to the initially proposed changes in the Package Leaflet.

Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Study C214 demonstrated the non-inferiority of the efficacy of DRV/RTV at the recommended dosage 
of  DRV/RTV  600/100  mg  b.i.d.  compared  to  LPV/RTV  both  in  combination  with  an  OBR  in  the 
studied ART-experienced HIV-1 infected patients based on the primary virological endpoint (i.e. the 
percentage  of  patients  with  confirmed  plasma  viral  load  <  400  copies/ml  at  Week  48  in  the  OP 
population) at the chosen delta of 12%. DRV/RTV was at least as efficacious as LPV/RTV based on 
the  results  for  secondary  virological  and  immunological  response  parameters.  In  this  comparison, 
DRV/RTV treatment appeared to be associated with more favourable virological response as defined 
by the primary endpoint (77% for the DRV/RTV group and 68% for the LPV/RTV group). This was 
also  evident  from  the  results  for  the  percentage  of  patients  with  confirmed  plasma  viral  load 
< 50 copies/ml  at  Week  48  (which  was  a  secondary  endpoint)  and  other  secondary  virological 
parameters.   
Justification  of  the  chosen  non-inferiority  margin  was  based  on  trials  with  other  PIs  and  not  on  a 
discussion  of  potential  clinical  relevance  in  the  context  of  morbidity  or  survival.  However,  the 
observed lower bound of the 95% CI was > -10% and therefore there is no reason for concern in that 
regard.  
Virological response tends to decrease over time at least partly due to viral resistance associated with 
RAM,  as  noted  also  in  the  original  pre-registration  assessment  for  the  highly  pre-treated  HIV-1 
infected patients. The results of the Week 96 of the present ongoing trial are of interest for the further 
evaluation  of  the  development  of  resistance and  evaluation  of  the  long-term  safety  of  DRV/RTV in 
this  HIV-1  infected  population.  In  this  regard  there  is  an  ongoing  FUM,  to  which  the  MAH 
committed; in this context, the MAH should also present the virologic response by clade.  
The  submitted  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  did  not  reveal  unexpected  findings.  Some  small 
differences in plasma concentrations were observed between studied groups, but this is considered not 
clinically relevant. 
The  relative  AE  profile  of  DRV/RTV  emerging  from  this  Week  48  analysis  of  the  study  results  for 
trial  TMC114-C214  indicates  that  DRV/RTV  at  the  recommended  dosage  (as  for  the  highly  pre-
treated patients) for this population is at least similar to the profile of LPV/RTV. The safety results of 
DRV/RTV from this study are in line with the earlier assessment of the safety of DRV/RTV during the 
renewal procedure in which the present results were integrated. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no 
amendments to the Product Information are needed in the framework of this extension of indication.

The CHMP considered the benefit risk balance of Prezista positive for the sought indication variation: 
“PREZISTA,  co-administered  with  100 mg  ritonavir  is  indicated  in  combination  with  other 
antiretroviral  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV-1) 
infection  in  treatment-experiencedhighly  pre-treated  adult  patients,  including  those  that  have  been 
highly pre-treatedwho failed more than one regimen containing a protease inhibitor (PI). 
In  deciding  to  initiate  treatment  with  PREZISTA  co-administered  with  100 mg  ritonavir  careful 
consideration  should  be  given  to  the  treatment  history  of  the  individual  patient  and  the  patterns  of 
mutations  associated  with  different  agents.  Genotypic  or  phenotypic  testing  (when  available)  and 
treatment history should guide the use of PREZISTA.”

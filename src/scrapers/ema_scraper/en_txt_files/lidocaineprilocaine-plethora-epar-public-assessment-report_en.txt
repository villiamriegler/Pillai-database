Executive summary 
Premature ejaculation (PE), also referred to as early (EE) or rapid ejaculation (RE), is generally defined 
by  three  essential  criteria:  brief  ejaculatory  latency;  loss  of  control;  and  psychological  distress  in  the 
patients  and/or  partner  (Althof  et  al.  2010).  According  to  the  American  Psychiatric  Association’s 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version IV (DSM-IV TR), PE is described as ‘the 
persistent or recurrent onset of ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after 
penetration  and  before  the  person  wishes  it.  The  disturbance  must  cause  marked  distress  or 
interpersonal  difficulty.  The  premature  ejaculation  is  not  due  exclusively  to  the  direct  effects  of  a 
substance (e.g., withdrawal from opioids)’. PE has two subtypes: lifelong and acquired PE. Lifelong PE 
is  characterised  by  early  ejaculation  at  every/or  nearly  every  intercourse  with  every  or  nearly  every 
sexual partner from the first sexual encounter onwards, whereas men  with acquired PE develop early 
ejaculation at some point in their life having previously had normal ejaculation experiences (Wespes E 
et al. 2006). 
The  approaches  to  the  management  of  PE  have  been  primarily  based  on  behavioural  techniques  and 
pharmacological treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The latter is based on 
increasing  the  time  it  takes  to  ejaculate  by  preventing  the  neurotransmitter  5-hydroxytryptamine 
(serotonin) from being taken back up into nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.  
In  September  2013,  the  European  Medicines  Agency’s  Committee  for  Medicinal  Products  for  Human 
Use  (CHMP)  recommended  the  authorisation  of  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  (lidocaine/prilocaine)  for 
the treatment of premature ejaculation in adult men. Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora (also called PSD502, 
TEMPE) contains the active substances lidocaine and prilocaine, local anaesthetics that act by blocking 
the transmission of nerve impulses, reducing sensory stimulation. The medicine has been developed as 
a cutaneous spray solution able to provide rapid-onset topical anaesthesia to the glans penis mucosal 
surface  for  the  treatment  of  primary  premature  ejaculation  in  adult  men.    The  recommended  dose  is 
3 actuations applied to cover the glans penis. Each such dose supplies a total of 22.5 mg lidocaine and 
7.5 mg prilocaine. A maximum of 3 doses can be used within 24 hours  with  at least 4 hours between 
doses.  
Clinical  efficacy  of  lidocaine/prilocaine  in  males  with  PE  was  demonstrated  in  two  multi-centre, 
multinational,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  studies,  both  followed  by  an  open-label 
phase.  In  the  general  population  of  patients  with  PE,  lidocaine/prilocaine  was  shown  to  increase  the 
time  to  achieve  ejaculation  after  penetration  (intra-vaginal  ejaculatory  latency  time  or  IELT,  an 
indicator  of  pharmacological  activity);  it  also  increased  control  over  ejaculation  and  reduced  the 
feelings  of  distress  in  patients  with  premature  ejaculation  as  measured  by  the  Index  of  Premature 
Ejaculation  (IPE).  During  the  3 months  of  the  double-blind  treatment  phase,  the  average  IELT 
increased  from  0.58  to  3.17 minutes  in  the  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  group  and  from  0.56 to 
0.94 minutes  in  the  placebo  group.    The  clinically  significant  increases  in  IELT  were  paralleled  by 
significant differences in the IPE scores (p <0.0001).   
The  most  common  side  effects  were  hypoaesthesia  (reduced  sensation)  and  genital  burning  in  both 
men  and  women,  plus  erectile  dysfunction  in  men  and  headache,  influenza,  nasopharyngitis  and 
vulvovaginal discomfort in female sexual partners. 
Although  the  lidocaine/prilocaine  clinical  development  program  allowed  inclusion  of  males  with  no 
upper  age  limit,  due  to  the  low  number  of  elderly  subjects  enrolled,  there  are  limited  data  on  the 
efficacy and safety of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora in patients 65 years and over.  
The  metabolism  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  results  in  the  formation  of  2,6-xylidine  and  o-toluidine, 
respectively, amongst other metabolites. Therefore prilocaine in high doses may cause an increase in

methaemoglobin  level.  Caution  should  therefore  be  raised  in  patients  with  anaemia,  congenital  or 
acquired methaemoglobinaemia or patients on concomitant therapy known to produce such conditions. 
In  an  ex-vivo  study  in  rats,  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  was  shown  to  reduce  sperm  motility  and 
therefore  the  potential  for  reduction  of  sperm  motility  following  clinical  use  of  the  medicinal  product 
cannot be excluded. 
A  pharmacovigilance  plan  for  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  will  be  implemented  as  part  of  the 
marketing  authorisation. The  risk  management  plan  includes  an  updated  drug-utilisation  study  aimed 
to characterise real clinical practice and the patients who are prescribed the product.  
Lidocaine/Prilocaine  is  not  expected  to  pose  a  risk  to  the  environment.  The  Applicant  should  provide 
the  study  reports  of  the  experimental  determination  of  the  log  Kow  value  for  both  lidocaine  and 
prilocaine. 
Overall,  the  efficacy  of  lidocaine/prilocaine  over  placebo  has  been  demonstrated.  The  adverse  effect 
profile  of  lidocaine/prilocaine  for  both  male  subjects  and  their  female  partners  appears  to  be  benign 
and manageable and no new safety signals have been observed with lidocaine/prilocaine. Therefore the 
benefit/risk  balance  of  lidocaine/prilocaine  in  the  treatment  of  premature  ejaculation  in  adult  men  is 
considered positive.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Although there is no clear consensus on the definition of Premature ejaculation (PE), also referred to as 
early (EE) or rapid ejaculation (RE), it is generally accepted it consists of three essential criteria: brief 
ejaculatory latency; loss of control; and psychological distress in the patients and/or partner (Althof et 
al.  2010).  According  to  the  American  Psychiatric  Association’s  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 9/126 
 
 
 
 
Mental Disorders, version IV (DSM-IV TR), rapid (premature) ejaculation is defined as ‘the persistent or 
recurrent onset and ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration 
and  before  the  person  wishes  it.  The  disturbance  must  cause  marked  distress  or  interpersonal 
difficulty.  The  premature  ejaculation  is  not  due  exclusively  to  the  direct  effects  of  a  substance  (e.g., 
withdrawal from opioids)’. 
PE  is  the  commonest  sexual  complaint,  affecting  30%  of  sexually  active  men  (Lauman,  1999)  to  as 
high  as  66%  in  Germany  (Aschka  et  al.,  2001).  Also  PE  is  self-reported  and  the  obvious  stigma 
associated  with  it  is  likely  to  lead  to  it  being  underreported.  Furthermore  it  is  important  to  clearly 
distinguish between PE and Erectile Dysfunction (ED) as they may coexist. 
Ejaculation generally occurs because of reflex mechanism initially triggered by stimulation of the penis 
via  pudendal  sensory  nerves,  with  communication  to  the  spinal  cord  and  the  sensory  cortex.  The 
secondary reflex is completed after activation of the efferent somatic fibers to the ischiocavernosus and 
other perineal muscles. The aetiology of PE is however not well understood, with little data to support 
suggested  biological  and  psychological  hypotheses  (Rowland  et  al.,  1993),  including  anxiety,  penile 
hypersensitivity (Xin et al., 1997) and serotonin receptor dysfunction.  
PE comprises several subtypes; lifelong or acquired PE. Lifelong PE is characterised by early ejaculation 
at  every/or  nearly  every  intercourse  with  every  or  nearly  every  sexual  partner  from  the  first  sexual 
encounter  onwards.  Men  with  acquired  PE  develop early  ejaculation  at  some point  in  their  life  having 
previously  had  normal  ejaculation  experiences  (Wespes  E  et  al.  2006).  In  2008  the  International 
Society  for  Sexual  Medicine  defined  lifelong  PE  as  a  male  sexual  dysfunction  characterised  by 
“….ejaculation  which  always  or  nearly  always  occurs  prior  to  or  within  about  one  minute  of  vaginal 
penetration, the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations, and the presence 
of negative personal consequences, such as distress, bother, frustration and/or the avoidance of sexual 
intimacy” (McMahon et al. 2000). 
Acquired PE may be due to sexual performance anxiety, psychological or relationship problems, erectile 
dysfunction, prostatitis or hyperthyroidism among other causes.  Several psychoactive drugs can cause 
delayed or retarded ejaculation.  
A detailed and complete sexual history should be obtained for all patients for the correct diagnosis to 
be  established.  This  should  be  accompanied  with  a  questioning  of  the  patients  about  frequency  and 
duration of activity required for ejaculation, as well as whether the problem exists with certain types of 
sexual stimulation versus others. New devices that can stimulate patients to ejaculation may be useful 
(O’Leary et al., 2001). 
The  approaches  to  the  management  of  PE  have  been  primarily  based  on  behavioural  techniques  and 
pharmacological treatment (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)). 
The  current  available  pharmacological  treatment  for  PE  is  based  on  increasing  the  time  it  takes  to 
ejaculate  by  preventing  the  neurotransmitter  5-hydroxytryptamine  (serotonin)  from  being  taken  back 
up  into  nerve  cells  in  the  brain  and  spinal  cord,  thereby  increasing  the  amount  of  serotonin  between 
nerve cells. At the present time, no CHMP scientific guidelines specific for PE are available.

The  pharmacological  mode  of  action  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  is  well  established.  Like  other  local 
anaesthetics,  they  act  directly  on  nerve  cells  to  block  their  ability  to  transmit  impulses  down  their 
axons. Lidocaine and prilocaine have similar anaesthetic potency. The molecular targets of both are the 
voltage-dependent sodium channels of neurons. The drugs bind selectively to the intracellular surface 
of sodium channels and block the entry of sodium into the cell. The blocking of sodium influx prevents 
the  depolarisation  necessary  for  action  potential  propagation  and  at  sufficient  concentrations  block 
impulse  conduction.  Since  binding  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  to  sodium  channels  is  completely 
reversible,  when  drug  administration  is  stopped  the  drug  diffuses  away.  Restoration  of  active  sodium 
pumping  and  continued  leakage  of  potassium  restores  the  membrane  potential  to  its  polarised  state. 
The  membrane  potential  remains  deactivated  and  refractory  to  further  stimulation  for  a  short  period. 
Eventually nerve function is completely restored (Lagan and McLure, 2004; Becker and Reed, 2006). 
Lidocaine  has  a  rapid  onset  of  action  and  anaesthesia  is  obtained  within  a  few  minutes,  with  an 
intermediate duration of action. Prilocaine has a slower onset of action with slightly longer duration of 
action  (Martindale  Lidocaine  2012,  Martindale  Prilocaine  2012).  The  combination  of  lidocaine  and 
prilocaine in PSD502 provides a rapid onset of action. So, application of lidocaine and prilocaine in their 
base  forms  at  a  pH  of  8.0,  optimises  penetration,  maximising  the  depth  of  neural  blockade  and 
minimising  time  to  onset of  numbness  (Henry  et  al.,  2008).  Lidocaine  and  prilocaine,  are  well  known 
substances that have been used extensively for many years in various formulations, including creams, 
gels  and  solutions,  which  are  available  over-the-counter  or  on  ‘prescription  only’  depending  on  their 
concentration and use.  Lidocaine and prilocaine have been used in anaesthesia for many years, and as 
such  there  is  considerable  experience  with  these  drugs  in  the  healthcare  industry.    In  addition  to 
anaesthesia, lidocaine has been widely used in treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. 
Lidocaine/prilocaine  cutaneous  spray,  solution  incorporates  a  combination  of  two  active  substances, 
lidocaine and prilocaine at concentrations of 150 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml respectively. 
The combination of lidocaine and prilocaine results in a lowering of the melting point of the mixture in 
comparison to the melting point of the individual components. As such they co-exist in an appropriate 
ratio in liquid form at standard temperature and pressure. Both drug substances are readily absorbed 
through  mucous  membranes  such  as  the  glans  penis,  but  not  through  normal  keratinised  skin.  The 
only other constituent of the spray is the propellant 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (also referred to as HFA-
134a and norflurane), which is a commonly used propellant in pharmaceutical products within the EU. 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  cutaneous  spray  is  presented  as  a  6.5  ml  filled  in  an  aluminium  spray 
container  with  metered  valve.  Each  spray  dispenses  50  μL  of  solution  (PSD502  delivers  7.5  mg 
lidocaine  and  2.5  mg  prilocaine  per  metered-dose  spray  (actuation))  and  each  dose  consists  of  three 
spray actuations. After application, the propellant evaporates, leaving a thin layer of the drugs on the 
glans penis. 
Type of Application and aspects on development

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  objective  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  develop  a  cutaneous  spray  to  provide  rapid 
onset  of  topical  anaesthesia  to  the  glans  penis  mucosal  surface  for  the  treatment  of  premature 
ejaculation in adult men. 
The  medicinal  product  is  a  metered-dose  aerosol  spray  that  delivers  a  mixture  of  lidocaine  and 
prilocaine. It provides a film of local anaesthetic when delivered at the site of application.  
Each  actuation  dispenses  7.5  mg  lidocaine  and  2.5  mg  prilocaine  in  their  base  forms.  The  active 
substances  are  mixed  in  a  3:1  ratio  and  have  a  pKa  that  is  favourable  for  the  absorption  through 
mucous membranes.

The  only  excipient  present  in  the  formulation  is  the  propellant  1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane,  which 
evaporates  at  the  site  of  application  following  actuation.  Tetrafluoroethane  is  a  well-established, 
commercially available, non-flammable, non-CFC propellant. This excipient is used as both a propellant 
and solvent, eliminating the requirement for additional surfactants or vehicles.  
The formulation used during clinical studies is the same that the used for marketing. 
The  primary  packaging  is  an  aerosol  can  with  a  valve,  dip  tube,  button  actuator  collar  and  dust  cap. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
Compatibility  studies  were  performed  with  a  wide  range  of  materials  that  are  used  in  contraceptive 
devices  currently  on  the  EU  market  (male  condom,  cervical  cap,  the  diaphragm  and  the  female 
condom).  Deterioriation  was  observed  when  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  was  used  with 
polyurethane-based  female  and  male  condoms.    A  statement  is  included  in  the  package  leaflet  that 
polyurethane-based  barrier 
contraception  when 
lidocaine/prilocaine cutaneous spray is used.  
contraceptives  do  not  provide  effective 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: (1) mixing, (2) filling, (3) additional filling with 
tetrafluoroethane  and  (4)  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing 
process. 
The major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this cutaneous spray.  
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  include  tests  for  appearance  (visual  inspection), 
identification of lidocaine (HPLC, TLC), identification of prilocaine (HPLC, TLC), assay of lidocaine and of 
prilocaine  (HPLC),  dose  content  uniformity  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  delivered  dose  (HPLC),  impurities 
(HPLC),  mean  content  delivered  per  dose  (HPLC),  number  of  expelled  actuations  (shot  counting), 
moisture (Karl Fisher), leakage rate (weight check) and microbial contamination (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  five  production  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  of  four  production  scale  batches  stored  under  long  term  conditions  for  36  months  at 
25ºC/60%RH  and  for  up  to  6  months  under  accelerated  conditions  at  40ºC/75%RH  according  to  the 
ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  lidocaine/prilocaine  cutaneous  spray  are  identical  to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for all parameters as stated in the finished product specification.  
Testing was performed with the finished product in the upright position with reduced testing performed 
in an inverted position to provide information on the effect of the orientation. The analytical methods

used  in  stability  study  are  identical  to  those  used  in  the  release  of  drug  product  and  therefore  no 
further validation studies were necessary. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, a freeze/thaw study was conducted on two batches and a temperature excursion study was 
performed on one batch of lidocaine/prilocaine cutaneous spray. Forced degradation studies were also 
performed  on  one  batch  and  in-use  stability  studies  were  performed  on  two  batches  of 
lidocaine/prilocaine cutaneous spray. The temperature excursion study was performed to evaluate the 
effect  of  storage  in  extreme  temperature  conditions  (60°C)  for  7  days.  The  significant change  was  in 
the  leakage  rate,  however,  as  a  worst-case  scenario,  if  the  drug  product  was  stored  at  60°C  for  3 
weeks,  approximately  161  mg  will  be  lost,  which  is  less  than  3  actuations.  If  the  drug  product  is 
inadvertently  exposed  to  temperatures  up  to  60°C  for  two  days,  no  adverse  effects  are  anticipated. 
The forced degradation study demonstrated that oxidation is the only stressed condition that results in 
significant  degradation  of  the  drug  product  and  drug  substances.  The  results  of  the  in-use  study 
support an in-use shelf life of 12 weeks. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform  clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora, also called PSD502, TEMPE, is a cutaneous spray formulation developed 
by Plethora Solutions Ltd. to provide rapid onset topical anaesthesia to the glans penis mucosal surface 
for the treatment of primary premature ejaculation in adult men. The local anaesthetic effects reduce 
penile  sensitivity  and  so  increase  ejaculatory  latency  time.  PSD502  contains  the  drug  substances 
lidocaine  and  prilocaine  at  concentrations  of  150  mg/ml  and  50  mg/ml  respectively,  dissolved  in 
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane.  This,  also  referred  to  as  HFA-134a  and  norflurane,  is  a  commonly  used 
propellant in pharmaceutical products within the EU. 
The  pharmacological  mode  of  action  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  is  well  established.  Like  other  local 
anaesthetics,  they  act  directly  on  nerve  cells  to  block  their  ability  to  transmit  impulses  down  their 
axons. Lidocaine and prilocaine have similar anaesthetic potency. The molecular targets of both are the 
voltage-dependent sodium channels of neurons. The drugs bind selectively to the intracellular surface 
of sodium channels and block the entry of sodium into the cell. The blocking of sodium influx prevents 
the  depolarisation  necessary  for  action  potential  propagation  and  at  sufficient  concentrations  block 
impulse  conduction.  Since  binding  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  to  sodium  channels  is  completely 
reversible,  when  drug  administration  is  stopped  the  drug  diffuses  away.  Restoration  of  active  sodium 
pumping  and  continued  leakage  of  potassium  restores  the  membrane  potential  to  its  polarised  state. 
The  membrane  potential  remains  deactivated  and  refractory  to  further  stimulation  for  a  short  period. 
Eventually nerve function is completely restored (Lagan and McLure, 2004; Becker and Reed, 2006). 
Lidocaine  has  a  rapid  onset  of  action  and  anaesthesia  is  obtained  within  a  few  minutes,  with  an 
intermediate duration of action. Prilocaine has a slower onset of action with slightly longer duration of 
action  (Martindale  Lidocaine  2012,  Martindale  Prilocaine  2012).  The  combination  of  lidocaine  and 
prilocaine in PSD502 provides a rapid onset of action. So, application of lidocaine and prilocaine in their 
base  forms  at  a  pH  of  8.0,  optimises  penetration,  maximising  the  depth  of  neural  blockade  and 
minimising time to onset of numbness (Henry et al., 2008). 
Non-clinical  evaluation  of  the  pharmacology  of  PSD502  has  not  been  submitted;  however,  the 
Applicant  has  made  reference  to  the  clinical  data  which  demonstrate  that  use  of  Lidocaine/Prilocaine 
Plethora increases the latency time to ejaculation. 
Likewise,  the  Applicant  has  not  submitted  a  detailed  secondary  pharmacodynamics  assessment. 
However,  the  nonclinical  overview  indicates  that  lidocaine  is  a  class  1b  antiarrhythmic  agent  used  in 
the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias, while prilocaine is used for infiltration anaesthesia and nerve 
block in dental procedures and that carbonated solutions of prilocaine have been tried in epidural and 
brachial plexus nerve blocks (Hardman et al. 1996; Martindale Prilocaine 2012, respectively). 
Similarly,  the  pharmacodynamics  written  summary  states  that  Safety  pharmacology  is  not  applicable 
but the nonclinical overview summarized the effects of prilocaine and lidocaine on the central nervous 
and cardiovascular systems, as they are reported in the literature (Martindale Lidocaine, 2012; Gold et 
al.,  1998;  Kanai  et  al.,  1998;  Cousins  and  Mather,  1980;  Conklin,  1987;  Copeland  et  al.,  2008; 
Hardman et al., 1996; Martindale Prilocaine 2012; EMLA Product Monograph 2010.). 
Likewise, pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have not been submitted.  
In the absence of non-clinical data, the Applicant has provided clinical data in order to support efficacy 
(and demonstrate the pharmacological properties) of the proposed product. Application of PSD502 was 
shown to increase the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time and also improve a number of other indices 
for premature ejaculation such as Patient Reported Outcome.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
No  new  pharmacology  studies  have  been  conducted  because  the  drug  substances,  lidocaine  and 
prilocaine, are well established. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been submitted. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
No safety pharmacology studies have been submitted. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been submitted. This is agreed by the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted with PSD502 by the Applicant. However, 
the  analytical  methods  used  to  determine  plasma  levels  of  lidocaine,  prilocaine  and  their  respective 
metabolites,  2,6-xylidine  and  ó-toluidine  in  the  toxicokinetic  studies  have  been  established  and 
validated  by  five  analytical  methods,  using  HPLC/UV  and  LC-MS/MS  techniques.  These  analyses  were 
performed using plasma samples of mice and rats, and were validated in the range of 0.50-500 ng/mL 
for lidocaine and prilocaine and in the range of 1-1000 ng/mL for 2,6-xylidine and for ó-toluidine in rat 
plasma, and in the range 10-10000 ng/mL for ó-toluidine in mouse plasma.  
Distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  as  well  as  pharmacokinetic  drug  studies  have  not  been 
performed  with  PSD502.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  has  been  reported  in  the 
literature (Fransson et al., 2002; Weiland et al., 2006; Ko et al., 2007; Ko et al., 2008; Rolsted et al., 
2009;  Wei  et  al.,  2007;  Gazarian  et  al.,  1995;  Akerman  et  al.,  1966;  Integrated  Laboratory  Systems 
2000) and product package inserts (EMLA, 1999)). 
Absorption  parameters  for  PSD502,  after  topical  application  in  rats,  have  been  presented  by  the 
Applicant in the Study Report Nº 459135(29516) and 459140(30745). Also plasma levels of lidocaine 
and  prilocaine  and  their  metabolites  were  determined  in  a  vaginal  application  study  in  which  the 
maximum feasible dose of PSD502 was applied (Study Report Nº 519010(32378). The results of these 
pharmacokinetics studies of absorption indicate that all analytes were presented in all treated animals, 
with  a  concentration  of  lidocaine  about  3  times  higher  than  prilocaine,  and  similar  levels  of  both 
metabolites  across  the  treated  groups.  Systemic  exposure  to  lidocaine,  prilocaine  and  2,6-xylidine 
increased in a dose- proportional manner while the increases in systemic exposure to ó-toluidine were 
slightly supra-proportional.  
Sex-related  differences  in  systemic  exposure  to  2,6-xylidine  and  ó-toluidine  were  observed  when  the 
metabolites  were  assayed  alone  after  oral  treatment,  whereby  the  exposure  was  greater  in  males 
compared  with  females,  indicating  possible  physiological  and/or  metabolic  differences  between  the 
sexes. However, in the study where the systemic exposure of lidocaine, prilocaine, 2, 6-xylidine and ó-
toluidine was evaluated after topical administration, no clear sex differences were apparent. 
For  lidocaine,  the  primary  route  of  metabolism  in  the  rat  is  via  hydroxylation,  with  preferential 
hydroxylation  at  the  3-carbon.  The  metabolism  of  prilocaine  is  primarily  due  to  the  hydrolysis  of  the 
amide bond forming o toluidine instead of 2,6 xylidine and in man, the primary urinary metabolite is p-
hydroxytoluidine  (34%  of  dose),  followed  by  o-hydroxytoluidine  (2.7%)  and  ó-toluidine.  The 
metabolism  of  both  of  the  active  substances  does  not  appear  to  be  different  when  administered  in 
combination.  It  is  noted  that  the  lidocaine  metabolite  2,6  xylidine  and  the  prilocaine  metabolite,  ó-

toluidine  which  present  safety  concerns  such  as  the  formation  of  methaemoglobin,  have  not  been 
classified as major metabolites in man. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology of both lidocaine and prilocaine, as well as their metabolites, is well known and it is well 
documented in the scientific literature (de Jong and Bonin, 1980; Akerman et al., 1966; Rosenberg et 
al.,  1993;  Hofman  et  al.,  1977;  Feldman  et  al.,  1989;  Munson  et  al.,  1975;  Martindale  Lidocaine 
Martindale Prilocaine, 2012; Vasters et al., 2006; EMLA® Product Monograph 2010, EMLA SPC 2011). 
Also the toxicity of lidocaine has been tested in Hazardous Substances Data Bank, 2012, in which there 
are not acute toxicity values for prilocaine. 
It  is  known  that  the  topical  application  of  both  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  is  associated  with  irritation, 
conjunctival hyperaemia, swelling, fluid and exudate discharge and iris reaction. The lidocaine can have 
serious  effects  on  the  central  nervous  and  cardiovascular  systems.  An  overdosage  of  lidocaine  can 
result in severe hypotension, asystole, bradycardia, apnoea, seizures, coma, cardiac arrest, respiratory 
arrest, and death. Meanwhile prilocaine has a low systemic toxicity mainly because of high absorption 
in the lung and a large volume of distribution and thus is associated with a lower risk of neurological or 
cardiac side-effects, although its major disadvantage is the formation of methaemoglobin by two of its 
metabolites,  4-hydroxy-2-methylaniline  and  2-methylaniline  (ó-toluidine).  Methaemoglobinaemia  has 
been noted after i.v. administration of lidocaine. 
Single dose toxicity 
No studies on the single-dose toxicity of PSD502 have been conducted. The lack of single dose toxicity 
studies  is  not  a  concern  to  the  CHMP.  Moreover,  the  Applicant  has  provided  several  bibliographical 
references  to  explain  the  acute  toxicity  in  both  lidocaine  and  prilocaine,  and  their  respectively 
metabolites,  2,6-xylidine  and  σ-toluidine,  intraperitoneal  and  intravenously  administered  and  after

Vasters  et  al.,  2006;  EMLA  Product  Monograph  2010,  EMLA  SPC  2011).  As  well  the  acute  toxicity  of 
lidocaine  has  been  tested  in  Hazardous  Substances  Data  Bank,  2012,  in  which  there  are  not  acute

injection were determined in adult mice; the CD50 was 111.0 mg/kg and the LD50 1331.1 mg/kg (de 
Jong and Bonin 1980). 
In  studies  in  mice,  twice  the  dose  of  intraperitoneal  prilocaine  was  required  than  with  lidocaine  (200 
mg/kg prilocaine vs. 100 mg/kg lidocaine) to cause convulsions (Akerman et al. 1966). The prilocaine 
concentration  in  the  brain  was  about  three  times  higher  than  that  for  lidocaine  when  the  convulsions 
appeared  (prilocaine  115.6  ±  14.6  μg/g  and  lidocaine  43.1  ±  2.8  μg/g).  The  convulsions  following 
prilocaine injection lasted 5 minutes less than those for lidocaine, starting later and ending earlier than 
those following lidocaine injections. 
The  CNS  and  CVS  toxicity  of  intravenously  administered  0.5%  prilocaine  was  investigated  in  slightly 
anaesthetized rats. Arterial blood pressure, ECG and EEG were continuously monitored. The mean dose 
of prilocaine producing asystole was 166 mg/kg, arrhythmias did not appear until just before asystole. 
Seizure activity on the EEG occurred at a prilocaine dose of 53 mg/kg (Rosenberg et al. 1993). 
Threshold convulsive doses following intermittently infused lidocaine hydrochloride were established in 
mongrel dogs for each of three distinct and predictable seizure patterns. The first seizure activity was 
tonic extension which occurred at an infused lidocaine dose of 12.2 ± 0.6 mg/kg, followed by running 
activity after 22.7 ± 0.9 mg/kg lidocaine. The threshold for intermittent tonic-clonic seizures occurred 
at an infused dose of 33.3 ± 1.5 mg/kg (Hofman et al. 1977). 
In another study in dogs,  lidocaine was infused intravenously at a rate of 8 mg/kg/min until seizures 
occurred.  The  average  dose  at  seizure  onset  was  20.8  ±  4.0  mg/kg  and  with  an  arterial  plasma 
concentration of 47.2 ± 5.4 μg/mL (Feldman et al. 1989). 
The  CNS  toxicity  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  was  studied  during  constant  rate  intravenous  infusion  in 
rhesus  monkeys.  Drug  effects  were  compared  by  determination  of  drug  dosage  and  arterial  plasma 
concentration  that  induced  behavioural  and  electrical  seizure  activity.  Mean  (±  SD)  seizure  dosages 
were:  lidocaine  14.2  ±  3.2  mg/kg  and  prilocaine  18.1  ±  3.2  mg/kg  and  corresponding  plasma  levels 
were lidocaine 24.5 ± 4.4 μg/mL and prilocaine 20.5 ± 4.2 μg/mL (Munson et al. 1975). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The  Applicant  has  submitted  several  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  in  rats  with  the 
combination  as  required  by  the  Guideline  on  the  non-clinical  development  of  fixed  combination  of 
medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). Also 3 repeat-dose oral toxicity studies with the 
metabolites of lidocaine and prilocaine, 2,6-xylidine and  σ -toluidine hydrochloride, respectively, have 
been done. 
In most of these studies, the Applicant has provided the exposures to the metabolites 2,6-xylidine and 
σ  -toluidine  (which  are  considered  to  be  carcinogenic  in  rats  and  most  likely  carcinogenic  in  human), 
and has discussed how the exposure compare to that observed in humans.

In the study  459135, male and female rats were dosed with PSD502 by topical administration during 
7  days.  Clinical  signs  and  general  appearance  were checked twice  daily;  body  weights were  recorded 
pre-trial and daily and food consumption was recorded pre-trial and three times during the treatment 
period. Also, necropsy for each animal was performed on day 7 and selected tissues collected and fixed 
in 10% neutral buffered solution.  
On day 3, the group 4 dose level had to be reduced from 600 to 480 mg/day since the treatment had 
exceeded the maximum possible dose due the amount of solution on the dose site. Two females in high 
dose  group  died  on  Day  5  of  treatment;  necropsy  did  not  demonstrate  any  effects  due  to  treatment. 
However the remaining females in this group showed many brown scabs on the dorsal area of the skin. 
Males and females rats were also treated with PSD502 daily for 28 days in other pivotal study,  study 
459140. Clinical signs, bodyweight, food consumption and skin assessments were monitored. Also, all 
animals were subjected to a necropsy examination after completion of the 28 day treatment period and 
tissues were evaluated histologically. Although the uterus weight in females treated at 1 and 4 mg/day 
were noted to be statistically significant higher when compared with their control, due to the lack of a 
dose  related  response  and  no  histological  findings  this  was  considered  not  to be  related to treatment 
with  PSD502.  In  the  same  way  the  brain  weight  in  females  treated  at  1  mg/day  was  noted  to  be 
moderately  statistically  significant  but  as  this  was  not  seen  in  the  absolute  values  or  the  higher  dose 
levels, and no histological findings were noted, this was also considered to be incidental to treatment 
with PSD502.

In  addition,  samples  of  the  dermal  application  site  (skin),  liver,  urinary  bladder  and  nasal  mucosa  at 
termination were taken for DNA adducts analyses which were not conducted under GLP conditions, but 
these analyses at The New York Medical Center was approved by the UK MHRA. The results are shown

As is shown in table 3, only samples taken from the nasal mucosa had detectable DNA adducts, seen 
also at the 1 and 4 mg/day groups, and demonstrated that DNA adducts derived from lidocaine can be 
detected  following  topical  application  of  relatively  high  doses  of  PSD502  to  the  rat.  DNA  adducts 
derived from prilocaine could not be detected under identical conditions. 
Also,  haemoglobin  was  extracted  from  red  cell  fraction  samples  and  analysed  for  2,6-xylidine  and ο-
toluidine adduct formation.

As it is seen in the table 4, dose related increases in 2,6-xylidine and σ-toluidine haemoglobin adducts 
in all groups, and the increases in the lower doses, 1 and 4 mg/day, were approximately proportional 
to their doses. Low levels of σ-toluidine adducts were present in the pre-dosing haemoglobin samples. 
In  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  study  518457  also  performed  in  rats  during  14  days,  the  animals  were 
treated with 100 μL/dose of PSD502 into the vagina as 0.9, 3.5, 40 and 134 mg/day. No adverse signs 
were noted for animals that received 0.9 or 3.5 mg/day of PSD502 and these animals were re-assigned 
and  treated  as  80  and  60  mg/day,  respectively.  There  were  4  unscheduled  deaths:  1  animal  at  80 
mg/day group and all 3 animals at 134 mg/day group on the first day of treatment. Adverse signs in 
these  animals  included  cold  to  touch,  a  clear  discharge  from  the  nose  and  vagina,  crackling,  slow  or 
gasping  breathing,  a  swollen  head  and  staggering,  but  no  abnormal  necropsy  findings  were  noted  in

the 3 animals that received 134 mg. However, dark liver and reddened fat and blood vessels attached 
to the uterus were observed in the euthanized animal of 80 mg/day group, and 1 animal that received 
60  mg/day  for  14  days  had  reddened  vaginal  mucosa.  So,  for  a  28  day  dosing  period  to  the  vaginal 
tissue of rats, a dosage of no more than 60 mg/day of PSD502 would be considered suitable. 
In the other toxicity study in rats with vaginal administration for 28 consecutive days, study 519010, 
female rats were administered with 100 μL/dose of PSD502 as 0, 30 and 60 mg/day. All animals were 
examined  for  reaction  to  treatment,  and  food  consumption  and  body  weights  were  recorded  twice 
weekly.  Also,  following  dosing  on  Day  1  and  Day  28,  blood  samples  were  collected  for  toxicokinetic 
analysis  for  lidocaine,  prilocaine,  and  their  respective  metabolites.  At  the  end  of  the  treatment,  a 
necropsy was performed and the vagina, uterus and ovaries were examined histologically.  
Also in this study, tissues were collected to perform DNA adducts analysis. The analyses indicated that 
very  low  levels  of  2,6-xylidine  and  ο−toluidine  DNA  adducts,  in  the  order  of  <2  in  108  normal 
nucleotides, were noted in all groups. There was evidence of a dose-relationship with increasing levels 
of  adducts  with  increasing  dosages.  The  average  value  expressed  as  DNA  adducts  in  109  is  shown  in 
table 5.

In  the  tolerance  study  521983,  also  performed  during  28  day  in  rats  with  vaginal  administration  of 
PSD502,  the  animals  were  treated  at  doses  of  0,  0.2,  0.6  and  2  mg/day.  Clinical  observations,  body 
weights  and  food  consumption  were  recorded.  Gross  necropsy  findings,  organ  weights  and 
histopathological examinations were also evaluated. 
No  unscheduled  deaths  and  no  evidence  of  systemic  toxicity  were  found  in  this  study.  No  gross 
necropsy or histological findings were considered to be related to treatment with PSD502. 
The toxicity of 2,6-xylidine and of σ-toluidine hydrochloride were addressed in three studies performed 
in  rats  and  mice.  In  the  study  459114,  males  and  females  mice  were  fed  with  diets  containing  σ-
toluidine hydrochloride for a period of up to 14 days. The dietary route of administration was selected 
for  this  study  as  this  was  the  route  used  in  a  previously  published  study  conducted  by  the  National 
Cancer  Institute  (NCI-CG-TR-153)  and  the  doses  were  calculated  to  be  300  ppm  (56.9  mg/kg/day), 
1000  ppm  (239.6  mg/kg/day)  and  3000  ppm  (668.6  mg/kg/day).  In  this  study,  no  adverse  effects 
were reported. 
In the some way, the toxicology of σ-toluidine hydrochloride was also evaluated during 14 days in rats 
(study 459109),  where the  dietary route of administration was also selected taking into account the 
previously  published  study  (NCI-CG-TR-153).  The  treatment  of  σ  -toluidine  hydrochloride  at  1000, 
3000  and  6000  ppm  resulted  in  the  likely  intake  of  92.6,  264.7  and  501.3  mg  σ-toluidine 
hydrochloride/kg/day  for  males,  and  84.7,  231.1  and  438.9  mg  σ -toluidine  hydrochloride/kg/day  for 
females. No adverse clinical observations were reported in this study. 
On  the  other  hand,  in  the  study  459093,  male  and  female  rats  were  fed  with  diet  containing  2,6-
xylidine for a period of up to 14 days. The dose levels were chosen to be the same as those used in a 
previous carcinogenicity study conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NIH Publication No. 90-
2534)  and  they  were  calculated  to  be  300  ppm  (25  mg/kg/day),  1000  ppm  (75.5  mg/kg/day)  and 
3000  ppm  (228.5  mg/kg/day).  The  observed  effects  were  reduced  body  weight  gain  and  food 
consumption except in the 300 ppm group males. No adverse clinical observations were reported.

According  to  the  literature  studies  provided,  the  topical  application  of  both  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  is 
related with irritation, conjunctival hyperaemia, swelling, fluid and exudate discharge and iris reaction.  
The  most  serious  effects  of  lidocaine  intoxication  are  on  the  CNS  and  cardiovascular  system  and 
overdosage  can  result  in  severe  hypotension,  asystole,  bradycardia,  apnoea,  seizures,  coma,  cardiac 
arrest,  respiratory  arrest,  and  death.  Also  it  is  reported  that  prilocaine  has  a  low  systemic  toxicity 
mainly  because  of  a  high  absorption  in  the  lung  and  a  large  volume  of  distribution  and  thus  is 
associated with a lower risk of neurological or cardiac side-effects, although its major disadvantage is 
the  formation  of  methaemoglobin  by  2  of  its  metabolites,  4-hydroxy-2-methylaniline  and  2-
methylaniline (σ-toluidine). Methaemoglobinaemia has been noted after i.v. administration of lidocaine. 
Genotoxicity 
The  genotoxic  potential  of  PSD502  was  not  studied  but  no  special  concerns  were  identified  with  the 
individual  molecules  (lidocaine  and  prilocaine  separately).  However,  there  is evidence  to  suggest that 
the  metabolites  σ-toluidine  is  considered  as  a  mutagen  and  2,6-xylidine  has  genotoxic  effects  in 
mammalian cells, in mouse lymphoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells and BALB/c-3T3 cells.  
Carcinogenicity 
As the carcinogenic potential of 2,6-xylidine and σ-toluidine is well-known, the Applicant has performed 
additional studies, which aim to bridge the existing carcinogenic data. 
Long-term studies 
No  long-term  studies  on  the  carcinogenicity  of  PSD502  have  been  conducted.  The  lack  of  long-term 
studies on the carcinogenicity of PSD502 is acceptable, since any potential carcinogenicity is due to the 
formation of the metabolites of lidocaine and prilocaine respectively; 2,6-xylidine and σ-toluidine which 
are  classified  by  the  IARC  as  probably  carcinogenic  for  humans  and  are  addressed  in  bibliographic 
references  provided  (Studies  NTP  TR  278  and  NCI-CG-TR-153),  performed  during  104  weeks.  So,  at 
high  dose  (3000  ppm)  of  2,6-xylidine,  a  significant  increase  of  the  incidences  of  papillomas  and 
carcinomas  of  the  nasal  cavity  was  found  in  both  male  and  female  rats,  and  malignant  mesenchymal 
tumours,  rhabdomyosarcoma,  were  also  observed  in  the  nasal  cavity.  In  addition,  the  increased 
incidences  of  subcutaneous  fibromas  and  fibrosarcomas  in  male  and  female  rats  and  of  neoplastic 
nodules of the liver in female rats may have been related to the administration of 2,6-xylidine. In the 
other study, the rats dosed at 3000 and 6000 ppm with σ-toluidine showed several types of sarcomas 
of the spleen and other organs in both males and females, mesotheliomas of the abdominal cavity or 
scrotum  in  males,  transitional-cell  carcinomas  of  the  urinary  bladder  in  females  and  an  increased 
incidence of fibromas of the subcutaneous tissue in the males and fibroadenomas or adenomas of the 
mammary gland in the females. Also in this study, mice administered with 1000 and 3000 ppm with σ-
toluidine  presented  haemangiosarcomas  at  various  sites  in  males,  and  hepatocellular  carcinomas  or 
adenomas were induced in females. 
Short or medium-term studies 
The  potential  for  vaginal  and  cervical  carcinogenicity  of  PSD502  was  investigated  by  histological 
examination  and  DNA  adducts  formation  in  vaginal  and  cervical  tissue  in  the  28  days  repeat-dose 
toxicity study (Study No 519010) performed in female rats. The results of this study are shown in table 
5. 
Since  the  published  studies  on  carcinogenicity  of  2,6-xylidine  and  σ-toluidine  have  no  toxicokinetic 
data,  three  studies  have  been  performed:  14  day  dietary  toxicokinetic  study  with  2,6-xylidine  in  the 
rat.(Study  Number  459093),  14  day  dietary  toxicokinetic  study  with  o-toluidine  in  the  rat  (Study 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 24/126 
 
 
 
 
Number 459109) and 14 day dietary toxicokinetic study with o-toluidine in the mouse (Study Number 
459114). 
The three studies, studies number 459114, 459093 and 459109, performed by the Applicant complete 
the published carcinogenic data of 2,6-xylidine and σ-toluidine.  
The results from the repeat-dose study 519010 show that DNA adducts are formed in all three genital 
tract  tissues  (uterus,  cervix  and  vagina),  in  a  dose  proportional  manner,  when  PSD502  was  dosed  at 
30 and 60 mg/day for 28 days. Although the presence of DNA adducts are markers of DNA exposure to 
metabolites and the Applicant states that the generation of DNA adducts from the topical application of 
PSD502  in  clinical  use  will  be  limited,  it  can  be  not  discarded  an  increased  in  the  formation  of  DNA 
adducts since PSD502 will be used in an intermittent but chronic clinical use.  
Other studies 
No  other  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  submitted,  there  is  not  a  concern  of  the  lack  of  other 
carcinogenicity studies. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Since  both  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  are  well  established  products,  aspects  with  respect  to  potential 
effects on reproduction and embryofoetal development are based upon data from the literature. In line 
with  the  “Guideline  on  Non-clinical  development  of  fixed  combination  of  medicinal  products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/05)”  and  “Guideline  on  Non-clinical  documentation  for  mixed  marketing 
authorisation  applications  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/799/95)”  no  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity 
study has been conducted with PSD502. Besides, no major findings in reproductive organs have been 
observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. The reproductive and teratogenic effects of both lidocaine 
and  prilocaine  have  been  studied  in  mice,  rats  and  rabbits  dosed  subcutaneous,  intraperitoneal  and 
with  osmotic  mini-pumps  (EMEA,  1999;  Fujinaga,  1998;  Martin  and  Jurand,  1992;  Xylocaine,  2004; 
Wiedling,  1965;  Fujinaga  and  Mazze,  1986).  It  is  known  that  a  1:1  w/w  mixture  of  lidocaine 
HCl/prilocaine  HCl  in  doses  up  to  40  +  40  mg/kg  after  subcutaneous  administration  in  rats  does  not 
affect organogenesis or early foetal development (EMLA® Product Monograph, 2010). Also it is known 
that  both  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  cross  the  placenta  and  blood-brain  barrier  and  they  are  distributed 
into breast milk (Naguib et al., 1998; Martindale Lidocaine, 2012; Martindale Prilocaine, 2012). 
Ex  vivo  study  have  been  performed  in  order  to  determine  the  effects  of  the  proposed  product  on  rat 
sperm  motility  (study  number  495000).  In  this  study,  the  sperm  of  5  sexually  mature  rats  was 
collected  from  the  epididymis  and  suspended  in  0.2%  BSA  in  Medium  199.  PSD502  was  sprayed  into 
microcentrifuge tubes from preformulated spray canisters which delivered 7.5 mg lidocaine and 2.5 mg 
prilocaine per actuation and, after the evaporation of the HFA 134a propellant, 400 μL of 0.2% BSA in 
Medium 199 was added. This mixed was added to 100 ml of the suspension of the sperm and then was 
evaluated  for  motility  using  a  computerised  sperm  motility  analyser.  The  results  are  shown  below,  in 
table 6.

The  results  shown  PSD502  has  a  negative  effect  on  sperm  motility  but  at  concentrations  far  higher 
than in clinical use.  
With regards to the adverse effects on pregnancy rate, the Applicant elaborated that the sperm after 
the  ejaculation  could  be  exposed  to  a  maximum  of  approximately  10.5  mg  lidocaine  and  3.5  mg 
prilocaine (14 mg PSD502). Besides, after the ejaculation, the sperm is propelled towards the cervix, 
away  from  the  area  of  the  glans  penis  where  any  remaining  PSD502  is  likely  to  be  concentrated  in 
vaginal secretions. Therefore, it is suggested that sperm involved in fertilisation may not interact with 
lidocaine or prilocaine in the vaginal cavity following clinical use of PSD502. 
In  the  same  way,  the  applicant  has  submitted  bibliographic  references  which  have  reported  that  no 
adverse effects on human sperm motility were observed (Bennett et al. 1992,).  
Also,  in  the  clinical  trials  in  female  partners,  the  ejaculated  sperm  has  not  been  exposed  to  lidocaine 
and prilocaine metabolites in the vagina, and effects on the sperm that could subsequently affect the 
embryo or offspring should not occur. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The  toxicokinetic  studies  have  been  conducted  as  part  of  the  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and 
mice  to  assess  the  systemic  exposure  to  the  lidocaine,  prilocaine  and  their  metabolites,  2,6-xylidine 
and σ-toluidine.  
Two  female  rats  were  found  dead  in  the  group  dosed  at  600/480  mg/day  with  PSD502  topically 
administered  in  the  study  Nº  459135  and  one  female  rat  in  the  group  dosed  at  30  mg/day  with 
PSD502 administered by intravaginal route in the study Nº 519010. According to the results of study 
Nº 459135, the company considered that the dose of 40 mg/day was appropriate for the main dermal 
study, 28 Day local tolerance dermal study (Nº 30745), and that this dose was 427 times the proposed 
clinical dose to male patients on an mg/kg basis.  
On  other  hand,  in  the  two  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  following  the  topical  administration  (Nº 
518457 and Nº 519010), a maximum volume of PSD502 was introduced into the vaginas of the rats to 
investigate the formation of DNA adducts in the vagina and cervix. Thus the PSD502 doses were very 
large both on mg/kg basis and based on the local concentration of PSD502 and the observed mortality, 
these findings are not relevant to female partners of treated patients. 
Local tolerance 
The local tolerance of PSD502 (at 4 to 160 mg/kg/day) has been assessed in a 28 day repeated dose 
toxicity study after the dermal application of the drug to rats (study Nº 459140).  
The  topical  use  of  the  product  was  associated  with  mild/moderate  desquamation,  signs  of  erythema 
and eschar; however, the applied doses were higher than those proposed clinically and there were no 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 27/126 
 
 
 
 
signs  of  antigenicity  or  immunotoxicity.  No  further  studies  to  address  the  local  tolerance  of  PSD502 
were needed. 
Other toxicity studies 
No other toxicity studies have been realized with PSD502, and this is not regarded as of concern by the 
CHMP. 
Antigenicity 
No antigenicity studies with PSD502 have been conducted in experimental animals, this is regarded as 
acceptable and supported by the fact that no signs of antigenicity have been found in the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies. 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunotoxicity  studies  have  not  been  performed  with  PSD502  because  of  the  previous  clinical 
experience with the PSD502 drug substances individually; this is regarded as acceptable and supported 
by the fact that no signs of immunotoxicity have been found in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Dependence 
No  studies  on  dependence  have  been  carried  out  with  PSD502  because  of  the  previous  clinical 
experience with the PSD502 drug substances individually, this was accepted. 
Metabolites 
The  metabolites  of  toxicological  relevance,  2,6-xylidine  and ο-toluidine  have  been  addressed,  and  no 
further studies are needed to characterise the metabolites. 
Studies on impurities 
Only  one  impurity,  named  PGAK-1,  was  present  at  25  oC  in  the  PDS502  formulation  and  it  has  been 
further characterised. There are no further concerns to be raised from the nonclinical viewpoint. 
Other studies 
No other studies have been realized with PSD502, and this is not regarded as of concern by the CHMP. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In  accordance  with  the  EMEA  “Guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products 
for  human  use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00)”,  an  environmental  risk  assessment  has  been  performed 
for  PSD502.  The  octanol/water  partition  coefficient,  log  Kow,  is  2.26  for  lidocaine  and  2.11  for 
prilocaine, according to Hansch 1995. Since both values are below 4.5, an assessment for Persistence, 
Bioaccumulation  and  Toxicity,  in  accordance  with  the  Registration,  Evaluation,  Authorisation  and 
Restriction  of  Chemicals  (REACH)  ”Guidance  on  information  requirements  and  chemical  safety 
assessment”  (ECHA,  2008)  is  not  required.  In  line  with  the  Guideline  “Questions  and  answer  on 
Guideline  on 
the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products 
for  human  use 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010)”  a  calculated  value  of  Log  Kow  is  generally  not  acceptable  and  has  to 
be determined experimentally.  
Also,  the  predicted  environmental  concentration  in  the  surface  water  (PECsw)  has  been  calculated 
roughly according to the applicable guideline. So, the PECsw for lidocaine was 0.0052 microg/L and for 
prilocaine was 0.0017 microg/L. The Applicant has used a refine Fpen that is acceptable in accordance 
with the EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 and EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 guidelines. As the PECsw values 
are below of 0.01 microg/L, a phase II assessment has not to be performed.

Therefore Lidocaine/Prilocaine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
The applicant should provide the study reports of the experimental determination of the log Kow value 
for both lidocaine and prilocaine. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  lack  of  secondary  pharmacodynamics  and  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  studies  is  not  an 
issue,  however  a  justification  for  the  absence  of  such  data  should  have  been  provided.  Although  no 
new  safety  pharmacology  studies  have  been  performed  and  bibliographical  references  have  been 
submitted,  a  summary  of  the  effects  in  the  central  nervous,  cardiovascular  and  respiratory  system 
should have been provided in the pharmacodynamics written summary as it is written in the nonclinical 
overview.  
The  Applicant  has  not  performed  any  distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  or  pharmacokinetic  drug 
studies with PSD502 and the majority of the pharmacokinetic aspects of this application were therefore 
based upon data from the literature. On the other hand, the Applicant has discussed the potential for 
pharmacokinetic  drug  interactions  when  administered  with  other  locally  or  systemically  applied 
medicinal products. 
The Applicant has submitted repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted with PSD502 which is in line with 
the  Guideline  on  the  non-clinical  development  of  fixed  combination  of  medicinal  products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).  In  one  of  these  studies,  study  459135,  a  pilot  study,  2  females 
treated  with  600/480  mg/day  of  PSD502  by  dermal  route  were  found  dead  on  day  5  of  treatment. 
Another  2  deaths  have  also  occurred  in  two  intravaginal  studies  following  the  topical  application  of 
PSD502.  
The Applicant states that in this dermal study, the appropriate dose is 40 mg/kg which is estimated to 
be  427  times  the  proposed  clinical  dose.  In  the  same  way,  in  the  intravaginal  studies,  a  maximum 
volume  of  PSD502  was  introduced  into  the  vaginas  of  the  rats  to  investigate  the  formation  of  DNA 
adducts in the vagina and cervix. Thus the PSD502 doses were very large both on mg/kg basis and a 
local concentration basis and the deaths in the studies do not have clinical relevance to female partners 
of treated patients. 
Lidocaine  was  not  considered  to  be  mutagenic  in  a  wide  range  of  genotoxicity  studies  and  prilocaine 
was not considered to be mutagenic but induced homologous recombination in a very sensitive assay 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 29/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  this  was  considered  to  be  the  result  of  an  aberrant  genetic  repair  mechanism.  Overall,  the  data 
available suggest that the active substances could be genotoxic by way of their metabolites. Exposure 
to  2,6-xylidine  and  ó-toluidine  following  the  proposed  clinical  use  of  PSD502  in  men  and  female 
partners  will  be  very  low and  intermittent  allowing  normal  genetic  repair  mechanisms  to  operate  and 
preventing the formation of permanent genetic defects. 
The  data  generated  in  order  to  bridge  the  pre-existing  carcinogenicity  studies  from  the  literature 
suggest that the exposures of 2,6 xylidine causing nasal adenomas in a 2-year rat study were 200-fold 
higher  than  that  observed  clinically  following  exaggerated  clinical  use.  In  addition,  the  no–effect 
exposures  in  a  mouse  study  conducted  with  ó-toluidine  was  substantially  higher  than  that  proposed 
clinically.  A  no-effect  dose  was  not  established  in  the  2-year  rat  carcinogenicity  conducted  with  ó-
toluidine; however, the doses administered were extremely high and it is worthwhile to note that in the 
clinical situation, this metabolite was only detected in one subject following exaggerated use.  
As the experience of long-term use in the intended indication is limited to one year, concerns regarding 
the  potential  systemic  risks  (e.g.  methaemoglobinaemia,  systemic  malignancies)  and  carcinogenicity 
potential  were  raised.  These  concerns  were  adequately  addressed  by  the  Applicant.  Overall,  the 
potential occurrence of methaemoglobinaemia from prilocaine and carcinogenicity risk from o-toluidine 
is extremely unlikely based upon the clinical and non-clinical information provided by the Applicant. 
The  presence  of  DNA  adducts  and  haemoglobin  adducts  are  also  relevant  to  the  potential  for 
carcinogenicity.  It  is  noted  that  in  the  rat  dermal  study,  metabolite  haemoglobin  adduct  levels  at  1 
mg/day which is ~10 fold higher than the proposed clinical dose were approximately 15 times the level 
of 2,6-xylidine and approximately 29 times the level of o-toluidine adduct levels in a clinical trial over 
an  8  month  period.  At  1  mg/day,  2,6-xylidine  DNA  adduct  levels  were  very  low  and  only  detected  in 
the  nasal  mucosa  and  not  in  liver  and  bladder  and  o-toluidine  levels  were  not  detected.  These  data 
suggest that DNA adducts of 2,6-xylidine and ó-toluidine following the prescribed use of PSD502 would 
not be detectable in man. 
Data from the literature suggest that lidocaine or prilocaine do not have the  potential to cause foetal 
abnormalities.  In  accordance  with  the  “Guideline  on  Non-clinical  development  of  fixed  combination  of 
medicinal  products  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/05)”  and  “Guideline  on  Non-clinical  documentation  for 
mixed  marketing  authorisation  applications  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/799/95)”,  studies  to  evaluate  the 
effects  on  reproduction  or  embryofoetal  development  have  not  been  conducted  with  PSD502.    It  is 
noted that no major findings concerning the reproductive organs have been observed in the repeated-
dose toxicity studies. The results of an ex-vivo study conducted by the Applicant show that the product 
reduces  the  sperm  motility;  hence  PSD502  may  adversely  affect  the  pregnancy  rate  at  the  intended 
clinical  use.  However,  bibliographic  references  submitted  by  the  applicant  reported  that  no  adverse 
effects  on  human  sperm  motility  were  identified  during  incubation  with  lidocaine.    Nonetheless,  the 
effects on sperm motility have been included within the SmPC, Section 4.6.   
No signs of antigenicity or immunotoxicity have been observed during the repeat-dose toxicity studies, 
and no further evaluations are needed.  
Regarding  with  the  log  Kow,  both  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  have  a  log  Kow  which  are  below  4.5, 
according to a bibliographic reference (Hansch, 1995) that has been provided by the Applicant.  
Given  the  observed  systemic  exposure  to  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  following  the  administration  of 
PSD502  the  potential  for  pharmacokinetic  interactions  with  drugs  which  reduce  the  clearance  of 
lidocaine/prilocaine  (e.g.  beta-blockers  and  cimetidine)  is  considered  to  be  low;  however,  relevant 
warnings have been included within the SmPC section 4.5, which is acceptable. 
The effect of PSD502 on locally applied agents, such as spermicides would have been quite relevant to 
the proposed indication; however, given the fact that PSD502 affects sperm motility, the potential for 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 30/126 
 
 
 
pharmacodynamic  interaction  could  not  be  tested.    The  effects  on  sperm  motility  have  been  included 
within  the  SmPC  Section  4.6  as  follows:  “A  study  in  rats  showed  that  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora 
caused a reduction in sperm mobility”.  
The CHMP recommends the following point to be addressed: 
• 
 The Applicant should provide all the study reports of the experimental determination of the log 
Kow value for both lidocaine and prilocaine. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall the non-clinical program conducted by the Applicant meets the requirements and the data are 
acceptable  From  the  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  point  of  view;  both  lidocaine  and 
prilocaine, as well as their metabolites 2,6-xylidine and o-toluidine, are well characterized. 
Overall, the majority of the non-clinical issues have been satisfactorily addressed in the SmPC. Animal 
studies  do  not  indicate  reproductive  toxicity,  this  information  is  adequately  reflected  in  section 5.3  in 
the  SmPC).  As  a  precautionary  measure,  it  is  preferable  to  avoid  the  use  of  Lidocaine/Prilocaine 
Plethora during pregnancy unless effective male barrier contraceptive measures are taken in order to 
avoid potential foetal exposure. 
No  teratogenic  effects  of  lidocaine  were  observed  in  studies  of  embryonic/foetal  development  in  rats 
and  rabbits  receiving  doses  during  organogenesis.  Embryotoxicity  was  observed  in  rabbits  at  doses 
toxic to the mother. The postnatal survival time of the offspring of rats treated during pregnancy and 
lactation with a dose toxic to the mother was shown to be reduced. 
In  a  study  of  pregnant  rats  receiving  a  combination of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  during  organogenesis, 
no effects on embryonic/foetal development were observed. There are however no systemic exposure 
data available for comparison with clinical exposure. 
Lidocaine  was  not  genotoxic  and  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  lidocaine  has  not  been  studied.  The 
lidocaine  metabolite  2,6-xylidine  has  genotoxic  potential  in  vitro.    In  a  carcinogenicity  study  of  rats 
exposed to 2,6-xylidine in utero, postnatally and throughout their lifetime, tumours in the nasal cavity, 
subcutaneous tumours and liver tumours were observed.  The clinical relevance of tumour findings in 
relation  to  short-term/intermittent  use  of  lidocaine  in  humans  is  unknown.    Human  exposure  from 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora is 20-30 fold less than  the minimum dose that did not result in tumours 
and 200 fold less than the minimum dose that did result in tumours. 
Prilocaine  was  not  genotoxic  and  the  carcinogenic  potential  of  prilocaine  has  not  been  studied.  The 
prilocaine  metabolite  o-toluidine  has  genotoxic  potential  in  vitro.    In  carcinogenicity  studies  of 
o-toluidine  in  rats,  mice  and  hamsters,  tumours  were  observed  in  several  organs.    The  clinical 
relevance  of  tumour  findings  in  respect  of  short-term/intermittent  use  of  prilocaine  in  humans  is 
unknown.  Human exposure is 1000 fold less than than the minimum dose studied. This dose did result 
in tumours 
There  are  no  adequate  data  from  the  use  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  on  fertility  in  humans.  In  an  in 
vitro study of rats Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora has shown a reduction in sperm motility when 22.5 mg 
lidocaine  and  7.5 mg  prilocaine  (i.e.  the  amount  in  1  human  dose)  was  in  direct  contact  with  rat 
sperm. However this study did not reproduce the circumstances of clinical use, as the concentration of 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora in direct contact with the sperm would be many fold lower. The potential 
for reduction of sperm motility following the clinical use of the medicinal product cannot be excluded; 
therefore  it  is  not  possible  to  state  whether  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  would  prevent  pregnancy. 
This  medicinal  product  may  reduce  the  possibility  of  pregnancy,  but  should  not  be  used  as  a 
contraceptive.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
•  Male 
In  study  PSD502-PE-003,  one  dose  (30  mg)  of  PSD502  or  placebo  was  applied  once  daily  to  the 
glans penis of 16 healthy male volunteers for 21 days, except for dosing days 7 and 14, when 3 doses 
(3 sprays each dose, 9 sprays in total) of PSD502 or placebo were applied, each dose 4 ± 0.25 hours 
apart. On Dosing Days 1 and 21, plasma samples were taken before dosing (0 hours), and at 1, 2, 4, 
and 8 hours after dosing to determine levels of PSD502 (lidocaine and prilocaine) and metabolites 2,6-
xylidine and o-toluidine. On Dosing Days 7 and 14, a single plasma sample was taken 1.5 hours after 
the third dose of PSD502. 
Each 30 mg dose (3 sprays) of PSD502 provided 22.5 mg lidocaine base plus 7,5 mg prilocaine base in 
a eutectic-like combination. 
Single dose 
Lidocaine  and  prilocaine  were  quantifiable  in  plasma  1  hour  post  dose.  The  maximum  concentrations 
for  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  in  an  individual  male  subject  were  96  ng/mL  and  13  ng/mL,  respectively, 
occurring 2 hours post-dose. 
Table 9: Mean (SD) Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Lidocaine and Prilocaine Following a 
Single Dose (Day 1) and 21 Daily Doses of PSD502 (30 mg) Applied to the Glans Penis: 
PSD502-PE-003 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 34/126 
 
 
 
 
 
Multiple doses on a single day 
The  maximum  concentrations  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  measured  in  any  one  individual  on  either  of 
these days was 171.47 ng/mL for lidocaine on Day 14 and 19.39 ng/mL for prilocaine on Day 7. 
The maximum plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine following 3 applications of PSD502 at 
4-hourly  intervals  to  healthy  male  volunteers  were  therefore  well  below  the  plasma  concentrations 
associated  with  systemic  toxicity  (>5,000  ng/mL  for  lidocaine  and  prilocaine):  Approximately  29-fold 
lower for lidocaine and almost 258-fold lower for prilocaine.

Table 10: Mean (SD) Plasma Concentrations of Lidocaine and Prilocaine Following 3 Doses of 
PSD502  
(each 30 mg) Applied to the Glans Penis 4 Hours Apart (All Subjects): PSD502-PE-003 
Repeat dosing for 21 Days 
Lidocaine  and  prilocaine  plasma  concentrations  tended  to  be  higher  on  Day  21  than  on  Day  1  (see 
Table  10).  The  mean  (SD)  Cmax  of  lidocaine  in  the  population  overall  after  repeat  daily  dosing  (Day 
21) was 56.11 (33.519) ng/mL, reached at a mean (SD) tmax of 2.69 (1.026) hours. For prilocaine on 
Day  21  in  the  population  overall,  the  mean  (SD)  Cmax  was  7.18  (2.457)  ng/mL,  reached  at  a  mean 
(SD) tmax of 2.52 (0.964) hours.  
The  mean  Cmax  for  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  following  repeat  applications  of  PSD502  for  21  days  to 
healthy male volunteers were therefore well below the plasma concentrations associated with systemic 
toxicity  (>5,000  ng/mL  for  lidocaine  and  prilocaine):  Approximately  90-fold  lower  for  lidocaine  and 
almost 700-fold lower for prilocaine. 
•  Female 
Two  studies  of  PSD502  were  carried  out  in  healthy  female  volunteers.  In  PSD502-PE-006  3  different 
single doses of PSD502 (3 mg, 30 mg and 150 mg) or placebo were applied once daily for 7 days to 
the cervix and vaginal fornices of 21 healthy female volunteers.  
The  study  was  terminated  early,  and  thus  study  PSD502-PE-007  was  undertaken  to  provide 
supplementary  information  in  female  volunteers.  In  PSD502-PE-007  60  mg  PSD502  or  placebo  was 
applied  once  daily  for  7  days  to  the  cervix  and  vaginal  fornices  of  30  healthy  female  volunteers.  No 
firm  conclusions  can  be  drawn  for  exposure  to  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  regarding  dose  dependency 
because of the small number of observations and variability. 
Single dose 
For lidocaine, there appeared to be a dose-proportional trend in exposure to  lidocaine across the two 
studies (see Table 11), with the exception of the post-menopausal 30 mg dose group (n=2) for which 
the mean Cmax did not fit this pattern. The Cmax was attained up to 2.0 hours after single-dose drug 
application. For prilocaine there was an increased exposure with increasing dose, but the increase was 
less than proportional to dose.  
The  highest  mean  Cmax  for  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  (215.54  ng/mL  and  28.79  ng/mL,  respectively) 
followed a single 150 mg dose of PSD502 in the pre-menopausal subjects in PSD502-PE-006. This dose 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 36/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
represents a supra-maximal exposure to PSD502 as it is far higher than would be anticipated to occur 
by transference from a male partner during sexual intercourse. Even so, the maximum concentrations 
were well below the plasma concentrations associated with systemic toxicity.  
Table 11: 
Repeat dosing for 7 Days 
As with the PK parameters derived following a single dose, the mean PK parameters for lidocaine and 
prilocaine at all 3 dose levels in study PSD502-PE-006 for Day 7 for pre and post-menopausal women 
were comprised of 3 or fewer subjects and were characterised by high variability. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 37/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In PSD502-PE-007, there was no, or minimal, meaningful accumulation of lidocaine or prilocaine 
observed following topical application of multiple doses of 60 mg PSD502 spray to the cervix and 
vaginal fornices for all female subjects for 7 consecutive days. 
• 
Bioavailability 
PSD502 has been formulated for topical administration with low systemic absorption as demonstrated 
in  studies  PSD502-PE-003,  PSD502-PE-006,  PSD502-PE-007  and  PSD502-PM-001;  hence  a 
bioavailability study has not been conducted. 
• 
Bioequivalence  
There have been two formulations of PSD502 aerosol dosage form used during the clinical development 
program,  both  containing  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  in  a  3:1  ratio  with  tetrafluoroethane  serving  as  a 
solvent and propellant. An ethanol-containing formulation was used in an early clinical study PSD502-
PE-001, instigated by Medpharma Plc prior to the transfer of PSD502 intellectual property to Plethora 
Solutions Plc on 9th December 2003. Following completion of study PSD502-PE-001, Plethora removed 
ethanol  as  an  excipient  and  the  subsequent  formulation of  lidocaine,  prilocaine  and  tetrafluoroethane 
has been used in all other clinical studies presented in this Marketing Authorization Application (MAA), 
and is the one intended for use as the commercial product. 
Study  PSD502-PE-001  is  used  as  supportive  evidence  in  this  application  and  is  not  used  as  sole 
justification  for  any  efficacy  or  safety  statements  hence  a  bioequivalence  study  for  the  two 
formulations has not been conducted.  
Data from food-interaction studies 
This was regarded as not applicable as the product is for topical use. 
Distribution 
The distribution of lidocaine and/or prilocaine following the application of PSD502 to the genital mucosa 
of  male  or  female  healthy  volunteers  has  not  been  evaluated.  However,  the  distribution  of  lidocaine 
and prilocaine following i.v. administration is well documented. 
Following an i.v. dose, lidocaine is widely and rapidly distributed into highly perfused tissues followed 
by redistribution into skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The steady-state volume of distribution is 1.1 
to 2.1 L/kg (mean 1.5 ± 0.3 standard deviation [SD]).  Once in the body, lidocaine is bound by plasma 
proteins, including AAG.  The extent of binding is variable, dependent in part on the concentrations of 
both lidocaine and AAG, but is approximately 66% to 70%. Lidocaine can cross the blood brain barrier 
and the placenta, presumably by passive diffusion and is distributed in breast milk. The milk: plasma 
ratio of lidocaine is 0.4. 
Following  i.v.  administration,  the  steady  state  volume  of  distribution  of  prilocaine  is  0.7  to  4.4  L/kg 
(mean  2.6  ±  1.3  SD).  The  distribution  volume  is  larger  than  that  for  lidocaine,  and  results  in  lower 
plasma concentrations for prilocaine when equal amounts of lidocaine and prilocaine are administered. 
Once  in  the  body,  prilocaine  is  reported  to  be  55%  bound  to  plasma  proteins.  Prilocaine  crosses  the 
blood-brain  barrier  and  also  crosses  the  placenta,  presumably  by  passive  diffusion,  and  during 
prolonged  epidural  anaesthesia  may  produce  methaemoglobinaemia  in  the  foetus.  Prilocaine  is  also 
distributed in breast milk, although the milk:plasma ratio for prilocaine is not determined as data are 
not available.

Elimination 
• 
Excretion 
PSD502 healthy male volunteer studies 
In  PSD502-PE-003,  following  single  doses  of  PSD502  (30  mg)  to  the  glans  penis  of  healthy  male 
volunteers, lidocaine was eliminated with a mean terminal phase half-life (t½) of 2.85 (0.4303) hours 
(n=6; all subjects). Insufficient data were available to permit the estimation of t½ for prilocaine, 2,6-
xylidine and o-toluidine.  
PSD502 healthy female volunteer studies 
In PSD502-PE-006, the mean t½ values for lidocaine at all 3 dose levels for Days 1 and 7 for pre- and 
postmenopausal  women  were  in  a  range  between  2.5  -  10.6  hours  and  the  mean  t½  values  for 
prilocaine at the 3 mg dose level were 4.1 hours (Day 1, post-menopause) and 55.2 hours (Day 7, pre-
menopause). The mean t½ values for prilocaine at the two highest doses were in a range between 2.0 
– 3.3 hours. 
The  mean  t½  values  for  2,6-xylidine  at  the  2  highest  dose  levels  for  Days  1  and  7  for  pre  and  post-
menopausal women were in a range between 5.3 – 23.0 hours. The mean t½ values for o-toluidine at 
the  2  highest  dose  levels  for  Days  1  and  7  for  pre-  and  postmenopausal  women  were  in  a  range 
between 3.1 - 17.3 hours. The half-life for metabolites that form after the administration of the parent 
drug reflect the rate of formation of the metabolite. 
In  PSD502-PE-007,  following  a  60  mg  daily  dose of  PSD502,  the  mean  apparent  terminal  elimination 
rates  (Kel  Day  1)  for  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  were 0.132  and  0.188  (1/hour),  respectively;  mean  t½ 
values were 5.42 and 3.99 hours, respectively. 
• 
Metabolism 
The  metabolism  of  lidocaine  and/or  prilocaine  following  the  application  of  PSD502  to  the  genital 
mucosa  of  male  or  female  healthy  volunteers  has  been  evaluated  in  studies  PSD502-PE-003  (healthy 
male volunteers) and PSD502-PE-006 and PSD502-PE-007 (healthy female volunteers). 
PSD502 healthy male volunteer studies 
Single dose 
Following the administration of a single 30 mg dose of PSD502 to the glans penis of 12 healthy male 
volunteers,  2,6-xylidine  concentrations  were  not  detected  or  not  quantifiable until  4  hours  post-dose. 
The mean (SD) 2,6-xylidine plasma concentration 4-hours post-dose on Day 1 is depicted in Table 12 
below.  At  8  hours  post-dose,  2,6-xylidine  concentrations  were  not  detected  or  not  quantifiable.  o-
toluidine was not detected or not quantifiable in any subject on Day 1.

(Day 1) and 21 Daily Doses of PSD502 (30 mg) Applied to the Glans Penis: PSD502-PE-003 
Multiple doses on a single day 
Following the administration of 3 x 30 mg doses of PSD502 to the glans penis at 4 hourly intervals on 
Day  7  and  Day  14,  the  mean  (SD)  2,6-xylidine  concentration  detected  at  1.5  hours  post-third-dose 
was 2.24 (3.076) ng/mL on Day 7 (range 0 to 7.9 ng/mL) and 3.71 (3.823) ng/mL on Day 14 (range 0 
to 10.60 ng/mL). o-Toluidine was only detectable in a single subject on and Day 14, 1.5 hours after the 
third dose (2.03 ng/mL) and was just above the lower level of quantification. 
Repeat dosing for 21 Days 
On  Day  21,  following  21  daily  doses  of  PSD502  (30  mg)  2,6-xylidine  was  only  quantifiable  in  3 
subjects. The maximum concentration recorded for any subject was 8.51 ng/mL at 4-hours post-dose. 
o-toluidine  was  only  detected  in  a  single  subject,  just  above  the  lower  level  of  quantification  4  hours 
after  dosing  on  Day  21.  All  other  subjects  had  concentrations  of  o-toluidine  below  the  lower  limit  of 
quantification at all time-points. 
PSD502 healthy female volunteer studies 
Single dose 
Systemic exposure of the subjects to the metabolites 2,6-xylidine and o-toluidine was low and variable 
(see  Table  13).  o-Toluidine  was  detectable  in  plasma  on  Day  1  for  a  single  subject  in  the  3  mg  dose 
group and for small numbers of subjects in the higher dose groups.

Table 13:  
Repeat dosing for 7 Days 
Plasma levels of 2,6-xylidine and o-toluidine in these subjects were low or absent, even following 
repeat dosing with PSD502 150 mg (see Table 14). No 2,6-xylidine was detectable in plasma after 7 
daily administrations of the 3-mg dose.  
o-Toluidine was detected in the plasma of 2 or fewer pre- and post-menopausal women in any dose 
group on Day 7 (including one subject for whom o-toluidine was detectable in plasma on Days 1 and 7 
after administration of the 3 mg dose).  
Table 14: 
Vaginal metabolism of PSD502 
Lidocaine  and  prilocaine  were  detected  in  vaginal  fluids  of  subjects  following  all  3  dose  levels  in 
increasing amounts relative to dose. The appearance of lidocaine and prilocaine in the vaginal fluid was 
from  the  fluids  washing  away  the  administered  dose  that  was  sprayed  on  the  vaginal  and  cervical 
surfaces.  Relative  to  the  doses  applied  the  amount  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  detectable  in  vaginal

fluids  2  hours  post-dose  was  small.  The  maximum  amount  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  present  on  the 
tampon at 2 hours post dose was 7.6% of the administered dose. 
As  expected,  metabolites  were  not  detected  in  vaginal  fluid  at  any  of  the  dose  levels  in  any  subject. 
These  metabolites  are  principally  formed  in  the  liver  and  excreted  in  urine  as  conjugates  of  further 
metabolic  products.  There  are  no  known  drug  metabolising  capabilities  or  excretory  processes  in  the 
inner vagina that could result in the presence of 2,6-xylidine or o-toluidine. 
Reports in the literature 
There  is  some  preliminary  evidence  that  lidocaine  is  metabolised  to  a  minor  extent  in  the  skin,  but 
lidocaine  is  largely  metabolised  in  the  liver  by  cytochrome  P450  (CYP450)  isoenzymes  CYP1A2  and 
CYP3A4 to its two major pharmacologically active metabolites, first to MEGX and then to glycinexylidine 
(GX), and 2,6-xylidine both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of 
lidocaine. Lidocaine has a high hepatic extraction ratio and any impairment of liver function or hepatic 
blood flow can significantly affect the PK. 
First pass metabolism is extensive and bioavailability is about 35% after oral doses. Metabolism in the 
liver is rapid and approximately 90% of a given dose is dealkylated to form MEGX and GX. These two 
metabolites  have  longer  half-lives  than  lidocaine  and  accumulation,  particularly  of  GGX  may  occur 
during  prolonged  infusions  and  may  contribute  to  the  therapeutic  and  toxic  effects  of  the  drug.  The  
pharmacological activity of 2,6-xylidine is unknown, but it has been shown to be carcinogenic in rats. 
Following  intravenous  administration,  MEGX  and  GX  concentrations  in  serum  range  from  11  to  36%, 
and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively [1]. 
Prilocaine  is  rapidly  metabolised  in  both  the  liver,  also  via  CYP450  isoenzymes  and  in  the  kidneys  by 
amidases, to various metabolites including ortho- (o-)toluidine and N-npropylalanine [1, 23]. 
The  o-toluidine  metabolite  has  been  shown  to  be  carcinogenic  in  several  animal  models    and  can 
produce  methaemoglobinaemia  following  systemic  doses  of  prilocaine  approximating  8  mg/kg.  Very 
young  patients,  patients  with  glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  deficiencies  and  patients  taking 
oxidizing drugs such as antimalarials and sulfonamides are more susceptible to methemoglobinemia. 
Oral application of Oraqix periodontal gel 
Serum  concentrations  of  2,6-xylidine  and  o-toluidine  were  also  evaluated  in  patients  following 
application  of  Oraqix  periodontal  gel  (a  eutectic  mixture  of  2.5%  lidocaine  and  2.5%  prilocaine)  to 
periodontal  pockets  around  all  the  teeth  in  the  mouthThe  ratio  for  Cmax  2,6-xylidine/Cmax  lidocaine 
was in the range 0.01 to 0.15 and the ratio of Cmax o-toluidine/Cmax prilocaine was between 0.12 and 
0.48.  
Application of EMLA cream to leg ulcers 
The plasma concentrations of lidocaine and prilocaine and their main metabolites were evaluated in 36 
patients undergoing debridement of venous leg ulcers following the application of EMLA cream (1 to 2 
g/cm2;  maximum  10  g)  for  30  to  45  minutes  under  an  occlusive  dressing.  The  lidocaine  metabolite 
monoethylglycinexylidide was below the limit of quantification in all samples, whereas 2,6-xylidine was 
quantifiable in 6 of the samples, but did not exceed 12 ng/mL in any of the samples. Maximum plasma 
levels of prilocaine were 77 ng/mL and the prilocaine metabolite o-toluidine was quantifiable in 62/136 
samples  bud  did  not  exceed  11  ng/mL.  There  was  a  significant  correlation  (p<0.05)  between  the 
plasma levels of lidocaine, prilocaine, and otoluidine and the dose of EMLA cream applied and the leg 
ulcer  area.  No  apparent  sign  of  accumulation  of  lidocaine  or  prilocaine  or  their  main  metabolites  was 
observed.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
No data was presented on this sub-heading. 
Special populations  
No specific PK studies in special populations were conducted. 
Circumcision and menopause 
Absorption  of  lidocaine,  prilocaine  and  appearance  of  the  metabolites  2,6-xylidine  and  o-toluidine  is 
slightly higher in the uncircumcised group. The three possible reasons proposed for this are; firstly, the 
presence  of  the  foreskin  may  act  as  an  occlusive  barrier,  increasing  absorption  of  PSD502,  secondly 
PSD502,  may  also  be  absorbed  from  the  inside  of  the  foreskin  which  thus  provides  a  larger  surface 
area  for  absorption  compared  to  circumcised  subjects.  Finally,  the  mucosa  of  the  glans  penis  is  non-
keratinised  or  poorly  keratinised  in  uncircumcised  men,  but  tends  to  become  keratinised  following 
circumcision.   PSD502 is  not expected to readily penetrate keratinised skin and it would therefore be 
expected that the increase in keratinisation following circumcision would reduce the rate of absorption 
of PSD502.  
For  the  premenopausal  subjects,  there  was  a  trend  to  a  greater  amount  of  drug  collected  into  the 
tampon,  relative  to  that  for  the  post-menopausal  women,  A  plausible  explanation  was  that  vaginal 
fluids  are  greatly  reduced  after  menopause.  Metabolites  were  not  detected  in  vaginal  fluid  of  pre-  or 
post-menopausal subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Anti-infectives 
As PSD502 is to be applied to the genitalia, and could potentially also spread to the genital area of the 
sexual partner, a number of in  vitro studies were performed to study potential interactions with other 
topical drugs for genital use, and also contraceptive devices, which may be in contact with PSD502.  
PSD502 interaction with the following agents was tested: 
1.  Antifungal agents: Clotrimazole, Econazole, Imidazole, Nystatin, Miconazole and Ketoconazole 
2.  Antibiotics: Clindamycin and Metronidazole 
3.  Antiviral agent: Ayclovir (due to cytotoxicity at full strengths, 1/5 strength PSD502 and 1/125 
strength Acyclovir were tested). 
There was no interference by PSD502 with the antimicrobial activity of any of the antimicrobial agents 
tested,  and  this  information  is  included  in  the  SPC.  Despite  the  inability  to  test  interaction  with 
Acyclovir at clinical strengths, it would seem reasonable to assume that there would be no interaction 
in clinical practice.  
Other drugs 
According to The EMLA® Product Monograph and EMLA SPC, interaction with Class I anti-arrhythmics, 
drugs  that  reduce  the  clearance  of  lidocaine  (eg,  cimetidine  or  betablockers)  and  induction  of 
Methaemoglobinaemia due to  benzocaine is possible.  
Contraceptive devices 
Four  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  PSD502  on  condoms  (Study  48580  Smithers 
Rapra Technology Ltd, Shropshire, UK), the cervical cap (Study 50686 Smithers Rapra Technology Ltd), 
the  contraceptive  diaphragm  (Study  50687  Smithers  Rapra  Technology  Ltd),  and  the  female  condom 
(Study 50841 Smithers Rapra Technology Ltd).  The various contraceptive devices were exposed to the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 43/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
30  mg  clinical  dose  of  PSD502,  and  subjected  to  tensile  strength  and  elongation  break  tests.    In 
addition, the male and female condoms were also subjected to burst pressure and burst volume testing.  
It was found that the integrity of the male condom, the cervical cap, and diaphragm were not affected 
by  exposure  to  PSD502.    However,  the  female  condom  showed  an  effect  on  tensile  strength  and 
elongation  of  break  testing  following  exposure  to  PSD502,  and  an  increased  incidence  of  punctured 
devices.  The female condom tested was polyurethane based, rather than latex rubber.   
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
In vitro studies of microsomes isolated from human skin have identified that the enzymes involved in 
metabolism of lidocaine are also expressed in low levels in human skin. However literature searches did 
not reveal any relevant biomaterials studies carried out on genital mucosa. 
The effect of PSD502 on the motility of human sperm has not been evaluated. Effect of PSD502 on 
spermicidal agents could not be tested for technical reasons, due to the inherent effect of PSD502 on 
sperm mobility and viability.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Lidocaine 
Lidocaine  base  is  readily  soluble in propellant.  However,  once  the  propellant  evaporates  lidocaine  will 
quickly  crystallise  on  the  surface  of  the  skin,  rendering  it  inactive  as  it  is  inaccessible  to  the  mucous 
membrane.  Therefore,  the  presence  of  prilocaine  is  an  absolute  necessity  in  the  formulation  as  it  is 
required  for  solubilising  lidocaine  and  maintaining  it  in  its  liquid  state  once  the  propellant  has 
evaporated. 
Prilocaine 
By mixing a small amount of prilocaine with lidocaine (ratio 1:3), a mixture is formed which is slightly 
oily  in  texture,  requires  no  excipients  other  than  the  propellant,  and  importantly,  has  a  pKa  that  is 
favourable for absorption through mucous membranes. In contrast to lidocaine base, prilocaine alone is 
not particularly soluble in the propellant, but once mixed with lidocaine, it becomes readily soluble and 
the  melting  point  is  lowered  so  that  it  remains  in  a  stable  liquid  form  even  when  dispensed  from  a 
pressurized canister, using a metered dose valve. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The  primary  pharmacological  activity  of  the  combination  product  is  essentially  the  same  as  for  the 
individual active ingredients. Lidocaine has a rapid onset of action and anaesthesia is obtained rapidly 
while prilocaine has slower onset of action but a slightly longer duration of action. The combination of 
lidocaine and prilocaine provides rapid onset of action. PSD502 delivers lidocaine and prilocaine in their 
base forms increasing the speed of onset of anaesthesia. 
Both Lidocaine and Prilocaine act on the CNS and cardiac tissues at higher concentrations. As systemic 
absorption  with  PSD502  use  is  very  minimal,  adverse  effects  on  these  tissues  is  unlikely.  Literature 
references  are  provided  to  show  the  absorption  of  the  actives  through  a  number  of  different  tissues 
such as the respiratory tract, anorectal mucosa and skin. Most of these are based on the use of EMLA 
cream.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PD effects and interactions are unlikely to result in any adverse effects. 
The  acute  toxic  plasma  levels  of  both  prilocaine  and  lidocaine  are  well  established  at  approximately 
5000  ng/ml.  The  highest  maximum  plasma  concentrations  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  following 
application of PSD502 to the glans penis of healthy male volunteers on multiple dosing days (1.5 hours 
after  3  4-hourly  30  mg  doses),  were  171.47 ng/mL  and  19.39  ng/mL  for  lidocaine  and  prilocaine, 
respectively,  which  are  29-fold  and  258-fold  below  minimum  toxic  levels.    PSD502  will  be  dosed 
intermittently  over  potentially  long  periods  of  time  for  PE,  therefore,  the  safety  of  chronic  dosing  is 
particularly important for this indication. After 21 daily doses of PSD502 to the glans penis of healthy 
volunteers,  the  mean  Cmax  of  lidocaine  in  the  population  overall  was  56.11  ng/mL  and  for  prilocaine 
was  7.18  (2.457)  ng/mL;  approximately  90-fold  and  700-fold  below  the  plasma  concentrations 
associated with systemic toxicity for lidocaine and prilocaine, respectively.  
Although  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  are  not  carcinogenic,  there  is  evidence  that  the  major  metabolites 
(2,6-xylidine  and  o-toluidine  respectively)  or  potentially,  sub-metabolites  of  these,  may  be 
carcinogenic.  Plasma  levels  of  2,6-xylidine  were  only  detected  at  low  levels,  in  approximately  two 
thirds of healthy male volunteers in study PSD502-PE-003, where supranormal dosing was tested, and 
then only at some time-points. In the same study o-toluidine was only detected at one time point in 1 
of  the  12  patients  who  received  active  drug.  Haemoglobin  adducts  (along  with  DNA  adducts)  are 
considered biomarkers of exposure to metabolites. Although there were small rises in both o-toluidine 
and  2,6-xylidine  Hb  adduct  levels  in  the  sub-group  of  subjects  tested  in  the  pivotal  PSD502-PE-002 
study,  the  rises  do  not  appear  to  be  excessive  compared  to  background  levels  in  the  literature  and 
therefore, whilst it is not possible to confirm that these rises do not indicate potential harm, there is no 
obvious safety signal from these results.  
With regard to sexual partners of patients using PSD502, drug transfer to partners during intercourse 
is minimal (1/4 to 1/8 that of the patient), and no (or minimal) accumulation was seen following daily 
doses. The lack of spermicide interaction study is also noted in the SmPC/PIL. The systemic exposure 
following PSD502 dosing is so low this is extremely unlikely. However, as a precautionary measure, a 
warning  is  included  in  the  SmPC/PIL.  Therefore,  the  latex-based  male  condom,  the  cervical  cap,  and 
the  diaphragm  can  be  used  as  effective  contraceptives  in  the  presence  of  PSD502,  but  not 
polyurethane-based  barrier  contraceptives.  Deterioriation  was  observed  when  Lidocaine/Prilocaine 
Plethora was used with polyurethane-based female and male condoms. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  Applicant  has  presented  a  comprehensive  clinical  pharmacology  program.  There  are  no 
outstanding issues on clinical pharmacology. 
The clinical pharmacology development of PSD502 comprises four pK studies, three studies conducted 
in  healthy  volunteers  and  one  in  patients  undergoing  skin  grafts.  These  studies  provide  limited 
information  on  the  pK  and  pD  behaviour  of  the  product.  The  Applicant  has  completed  the  missing 
information  with  that  available  for  EMLA  cream,  a  eutectic  mixture  of  lidocaine  2.5%  and  prilocaine 
2.5%  to  be  administered  topically.  The  Applicant  has  justified  it  through  the  similar  composition  and 
topical administration of both products and the extensive use and the well-known pharmacology of the 
components.  Admittedly,  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  are  present  in  a  number  of  formulations.  However, 
EMLA and PSD502 cannot be considered identical formulations. It is uncertain to what extent the data 
can  be  extrapolated  although  given  the  low  expected  systemic  exposure  it  does  not  seem  to  be  an 
issue.  A  relative  bioavailability  study  with  EMLA  would  have  been  useful  in  order  to  confirm  the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 45/126 
 
 
 
 
acceptability  of  the  provided  data,  however  the  lack  of  this  study  was  not  considered  major  by  the 
CHMP.  
PSD502  acts  locally  in  the  glans  penis.  PK  studies  have  shown  that  after  the  administration  of  single 
and  multiple  doses  to  healthy  male  volunteers  systemic  absorption  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  is 
minimal.  Repeated  daily  dosing  increases  the  exposure  although  a  safety  margin  of  29  for  lidocaine 
and 258 for prilocaine has been estimated. Similarly, when potential transfer to females partners was 
investigated the application to cervix and vaginal fornices of doses up to 150 mg (5-fold the dose to be 
administered to the male) rendered plasma concentrations well below the toxicity limits. Lidocaine and 
prilocaine  plasma  concentrations  tended  to  be  higher  on  Day  21,  but  again,  plasma  concentrations 
were well below the limits of toxicity.  Slightly greater amount of the actives were recovered from the 
vaginal  fluid  of  premenopausal  women  compared  to  post-menopausal  women.  It  has  been  explained 
due to decreased vaginal fluid secretion in the latter group although it is more likely that this is due to 
increased systemic absorption in the postmenopausal women as seen by slightly higher plasma levels 
of the actives.  
Although  the  mechanism  is  not  clear,  there  is  no  safety  concern  due  to  the  low  levels  of  the  actives, 
both in plasma and in vaginal fluid. 
Concentrations of both lidocaine and prilocaine in uncircumcised subjects appeared to be higher than in 
the  circumcised  group,  remarkably  after  repeated  dosing.  Whereas  the  stability  studies  conducted  to 
evaluate  the  effect  of  PSD502  on  condoms  and  other  devices  do  not  raise  any  concern  about  the 
integrity  of  these  devices  except  for  polyurethane-based  condoms  the  differences  in  exposure  to 
lidocaine  and  prilocaine  when  they  (particularly  male  condoms)  are  used  are  not  determined.    The 
information has been included in the PI. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of PSD502 in the treatment of primary premature ejaculation in adult men was evaluated 
in five studies: 
•  1 proof of concept phase 2 study (ANAE-059-00) 
•  1 dose-range finding study (PSD502-PE-005)  
•  2 pivotal studies (PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004) 
•  1 supportive phase 2 study (PSD502-PE-001) 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
•  Study PSD502-PE-005 
Study  PE-005  was  primarily  aimed  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  3  doses  (3  mg,  30  mg,  and  53  mg)  of 
PSD502 on IELT. The study followed a multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-way crossover 
design.  
After  the  initial  screening  assessments  subjects  underwent  a  baseline  evaluation  period  of  2  weeks 
during which they were required to document at least one sexual encounter using a stopwatch with a 
recorded  IELT  ≤ 1  minute.  Subjects  who  were  eligible  to  continue  in  the  study  were  assigned  a 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 46/126 
 
 
 
 
 
randomization  number  corresponding  to  pre-determined  sequences  of  PSD502  doses  or  placebo.  The 
treatment period was 4 weeks (1 week for placebo and 1 week for each of the 3 doses). 
The three doses chosen to be tested were 30 mg (3 sprays, each containing 7.5 mg lidocaine and 2.5 
mg prilocaine); 3 mg, low dose (3 sprays, each containing 0.75 mg lidocaine and 0.25 mg prilocaine) 
and 53 mg, high dose (3 sprays, each containing 13.28 mg lidocaine and 4.45 mg prilocaine). 
Subject Study Flow 
PE-005 included subjects aged ≥18 years, satisfying ISSM criteria for PE with a baseline IELT ≤1 minute 
in  at  least  one  sexual  encounter  were  eligible  to  enrol  in  this  study.  Subjects  must  have  been  in  a 
stable  heterosexual  and  monogamous  relationship  of  at  least  3  months  duration.  Subjects  were 
excluded if: 
• 
• 
• 
they  had  erectile  dysfunction,  defined  as  an  IIEF-5  score  of  ≤21  (unless  the  low  score  was 
entirely related to PE symptoms in the opinion of the Investigator),  
they or their partner had any physical or psychological condition that would prevent them from 
undertaking  the  study  procedures,  or  had  a  current  history  of  alcohol  or  drug  abuse,  had  an 
increased susceptibility to methemoglobinemia or used class I or III anti-arrhythmic drugs. 
they had received treatment with anti-depressant therapy for PE, local anesthetic spray, intra-
cavernosal injection or psychotherapy for PE within 4 weeks of screening. Subjects were able 
to take tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs or SSRIs, for indications other than PE, as long as the 
dose  remained  unchanged  within  4  weeks  of  screening  and  continued  to  remain  unchanged 
throughout the treatment period 
The primary efficacy variable was the change in mean IELT from baseline. 
The  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  mean  IELT  >1  minute  and  >2 
minutes, and the proportion of subjects with at least a two-fold increase in mean IELT compared with 
baseline 
Based  on  data  from  PSD502-PE-001,  24  subjects  were  sufficient  to  ensure  at  least  90%  power  to 
demonstrate  a  significant  dose  response.  This  assumed  that  the  underlying  dose  response  was  such 
that there is at least a doubling of IELT in the higher doses of PSD502 compared with placebo. There 
was  also  at  least  80%  power  to  detect  at  least  a  2-fold  increase  in  IELT  versus  placebo  for  each 
individual PSD502 dose. 
The primary efficacy variable was to be analysed using a linear random effects model with dose, period 
and  centre  as  fixed  effects,  mean  baseline  IELT  as  a  covariate  and  subject  as  a  random  effect.  The 
mean  IELT  was  to  be  log-transformed  prior  to  the  analysis.  Evidence  of  dose-response  was  to  be 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 47/126 
 
 
 
 
assessed using linear contrast test. Differences between the different doses of PSD502 were also to be 
assessed but without adjustments for multiplicity. Modelling of the dose-response relationship was also 
to be undertaken. All randomised subjects receiving at least one dose of study medication were to be 
used  in  the  analysis.  The  secondary  efficacy  variables  were  to  be  analysed  using  a  generalised  linear 
mixed  model  with  dose,  treatment  period  and  centre  as  fixed  effects,  mean  baseline  IELT  as  a 
covariate and subject as a random effect.  
All randomised subjects that received the study drug were to be included in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) 
population.  The  ITT  population  was  to  be  used  for  the  analysis  of  all  baseline  characteristics  and 
primary analysis of efficacy data. The per protocol population was to be a subset of the ITT population 
and was to be formed by excluding subjects with major protocol deviations that could have affected the 
efficacy  assessments.  All  subjects  that  received  the  study  drug  were  to  be  included  in  the  safety 
population. The safety population was to be used for the analysis of all safety data. 
Efficacy results 
A total of 35 subjects were treated. The study population was 100% Caucasian with a mean age of 40 
years. Approximately a third of the male subjects in the ITT population were less than 35 years of age. 
The median age was 39 years (range 21 years to 66 years). The BMI ranged from 19.5 kg/m2 to 35.4 
kg/m2, with a mean BMI of 26.49 kg/m2. Approximately 15% of subjects in the ITT population had a 
BMI of 30 kg/m2 or over. 
Table 15: 
ITT, Safety and PP populations – Randomised Subjects 
All subjects had life-long PE. The median time since diagnosis of PE was 1 year (range 0 years to 26 
years). Ten (29%) subjects had previously received one or more treatments for PE. The most common 
type of treatment for PE was SSRIs or other antidepressants, followed by local anaesthetic. There were 
no circumcised subjects. 
Table 16: 
Sexual Encounter Data – ITT Population 
The number of sexual encounters with the spray was similar for each dose group including placebo. For 
the  53mg  dose,  in  five  (7%)  encounters  where  penetration  occurred,  the  subjects  did  not  achieve 
ejaculation, whereas all penetrations at the two lower doses resulted in successful ejaculation.  
Two subjects did not achieve penetration or ejaculation on any occasion following the 53mg dose, and 
both  these  subjects  reported  difficulty  maintaining  an  erection,  and  one  also  complained  of  local 
CHMP assessment report

numbness. Two other subjects were able to achieve penetration but did not ejaculate on each occasion 
following the 53mg dose. 
• 
Primary Efficacy Variable 
When  compared  with  placebo,  only  treatment  with  the  30  mg  dose  significantly  delayed  ejaculation 
(geometric mean ratio to placebo 1.7-fold, lower 95% CL 1.19; p = 0.008). The proportion of subjects 
with at least a 2-fold increase in mean IELT was 32.4%, 57.1%, 65.7% and 47.1% for placebo, 3 mg 
PSD502,  30  mg  PSD502,  and  53  mg  PSD502,  respectively.  In  part,  this  was  due  to  the  fact  that  a 
significant  percentage  (12%;  4  of  34  subjects)  of  subjects  experienced  hypoesthesia  with  the  53  mg 
dose, resulting in ejaculation failure (baseline IELT data were carried forward where all IELT data for an 
individual period were missing).  
Table 17: 
Summary of Mean IELT (secs) - ITT Population 
The primary efficacy analysis performed on the PP population was very similar to that for the ITT 
population. 
•  Secondary Efficacy Variables 
A greater proportion of subjects receiving the PSD502 30mg dose attained an IELT > 1 minute and > 2 
minutes in comparison to all other doses.

Subjects: In total 23 treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) were reported by six (17%) subjects: 2 (6%) 
with 3mg, 4 (11%) with 30mg and 6 (18%) with 53mg.  
The  most  common  TEAE  were  hypoaesthesia  of  male  genitalia  (n=5;  14%;  4  reported  with  53  mg 
dose), erectile dysfunction (n=2; 6%), genital burning sensation (n=1; 53mg dose). 
Two  TEAEs  (penile  numbness  and  penile  burn)  reported  by  subject  407  during  the  PSD502  53mg 
treatment period were reported to be severe. All other TEAEs were either reported as mild or moderate 
in severity.  
Partner: In total 11 TEAEs were reported by four (11%) partners. Overall, two (6%) partners for the 
subjects  treated  with  PSD502  53mg,  two  (6%)  partners  for  the  subjects  treated  with  PSD502  30mg, 
three (9%) partners for the subjects treated with PSD502 3mg and no partners for the subjects treated 
with  placebo  reported  TEAEs.  The  most  common  TEAE  was  hypoaesthesia  (vaginal  numbness),  this 
was  reported  five  times  in  total,  by  one  (3%)  partner  for  the  PSD502  3mg  dose  and  by  two  (6%) 
partners  for  the  PSD502  30mg  dose.  The  second  most  common  TEAE  was  vulvovaginal  burning 
sensation, this was reported four times in total, by one (3%) partner for the PSD502 30mg dose and 
by two (6%) partners for the PSD502 53mg dose. 
There were no severe TEAEs reported in partners. The severity profile for partners was very similar 
across the three PSD502 treatment periods.  
2.5.2.  Main studies (phase III = therapeutic confirmatory trials) 
Primary  evidence  for  the  efficacy  of  PSD502  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  premature  ejaculation 
comes from the individual primary Studies PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004. These pivotal studies 
were  phase  III,  multi-centre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study,  with  open-label 
follow-up in 240-300 subjects with lifelong PE and their sexual partners.

Table 19: 
Summary  of the Pivotal studies conducted with PSD502 in premature ejaculation 
The overall design for the studies is shown in Figure 3. 
Figure 3: Overall design of study (PSD502-PE-002) 
Methods 
Two  pivotal  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  12-week,  parallel-design,  multinational 
studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  PSD502  on  demand  dosing  (prior  to 
sexual intercourse) in men with premature ejaculation. Only the 30 mg dose was tested.  
The  demonstration  of  efficacy  in  the  proposed  indication  is  primarily  based  on  the  comparison  with 
placebo.  The  Applicant  states  that  no  products  were  approved  for  the  treatment  of  PE  at  the  time  of 
initiation  of  the  studies.  Dapoxetine  is  currently  the  only  approved  oral  medicinal  product  for  the 
treatment  of  PE  but  several  products  have  been  used  to  cover  this  need.    The  justification  of  the 
Applicant is acceptable.   
The  duration  of  the  studies  is  12  weeks  for  the  DB  phase  (dapoxetine  efficacy  trials  were  of  similar 
duration).  Open  label  extension  to  up  to  9  months  provide  a  total  exposure  of  12  month.  Long  term

efficacy is based on a primarily aimed safety extension of the pivotal studies. No controlled data further 
to 12 weeks to support efficacy are available. 
Study Participants 
Inclusion criteria 
Male subjects aged 18 years and over with lifelong PE were to be considered suitable for the study if 
they satisfied the DSM-IV and the ISSM criteria.  
Subjects were eligible to enrol in the study if they had documented an IELT ≤ 1 minute in at least 2 of 
the first 3 sexual encounters in the Baseline period and had a response to Screening PEP to perceived 
control over ejaculation and satisfaction with sexual intercourse of ‘Poor’ or ‘Very poor’, and to personal 
distress and interpersonal difficulty related to ejaculation of ‘Quite a bit’ or ‘Extremely’.   
Subjects  were  required  to  be  in  a  stable  heterosexual  and  monogamous  relationship  and  the  partner 
was willing to comply with the study procedures. 
Exclusion criteria 
Subjects were excluded if  they had erectile dysfunction (defined as an  IIEF5 score of ≤21) unless the 
low score was entirely related to PE symptoms in the opinion of the Investigator, or he, or his sexual 
partner, had a physical or psychological condition that would prevent them from undertaking the study 
procedures,  or  had  a  current  history  of  alcohol  or  drug  abuse  or  had  an  increased  susceptibility  to 
methaemoglobinaemia or known drug sensitivity to amide-type local anaesthetics or used class I or III 
anti-arrhythmic drugs.  
Subjects also were excluded if they had a pregnant partner or of child-bearing potential and not using 
appropriate  contraception  [hormonal  contraception  or  intra-uterine  device  (IUD)  during  double-blind 
part of study; hormonal contraception or IUD or condom during open-label part of study].  
Subjects were not to be permitted to have received any treatment for PE (e.g. anti-depressant therapy, 
local  anaesthetic  spray,  intra-cavernosal  injection  or  psychotherapy  for  PE)  within  4  weeks  of 
Screening  until  the  end  of  the  study.  Subjects  who  were  taking  tricyclic  antidepressants,  MAOIs  or 
SSRIs,  for  indications  other  than  PE,  were  to  be  permitted  to  participate  as  long  as  the  dose  had 
remained  unchanged  within  4  weeks  of  Screening  and  was  planned  to  remain  unchanged  throughout 
the double-blind treatment period. 
Treatments 
The active test product was PSD502, a metered dose aerosol spray delivering a eutectic-like mixture of 
lidocaine and prilocaine for topical anaesthesia. A single dose of IP was to consist of 3 sprays applied to 
the glans penis. Each actuation dispensed lidocaine 7.5 mg and prilocaine 2.5 mg in their base forms 
(a  total  dose  of  22.5mg  lidocaine  and  7.5mg  prilocaine).  The  propellant  used  in  this  spray  was 
tetrafluoroethane  (HFA-134a),  which  also  served  as  a  solvent.  Once  HFA-134a  evaporated,  the  liquid 
formulation  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  was  to  form  a  slightly  oily  thin  layer  of  drug  at  the  site  of 
application.  
The placebo was a metered dose aerosol spray that was identical in appearance to the PSD502 spray 
and contained the same propellant HFC gas. 
Both  pivotal  studies  were  controlled  with  placebo.  No  active  control  was  included.  The  inclusion  of 
dapoxetine as active control (the only approved treatment for this condition) has been discussed by the 
Applicant.  It  is  acknowledged  the  additional  difficulties  of  adding  a  third  arm  by  a  different  route  of 
administration  (and  the  derived  double  dummy  for  masking),  mainly  when  both  treatments  are 
CHMP assessment report

administered in the preambles of the sexual intercourse and at different stages (dapoxetine 1-3 hours 
before, PSD502 five minutes before). The controlled placebo design is acceptable. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the studies was to determine the effect of PSD502 on Index of Premature 
Ejaculation and Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency Time. 
- 
The secondary objective of the studies was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PSD502 in 
subjects with PE, and their sexual partners and to evaluate the effect of PSD502 on the subject 
and partner Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP) 
. 
Study PE-002 had also the following secondary objectives: 
- 
- 
to determine the minimally important difference in IPE domains; 
to evaluate the relationship between IELT and IPE; 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Outcomes 
Efficacy  was  primarily  assessed  by  quantitative  measures  based  on  time  to  ejaculation  (IELT)  and 
qualitative  evaluation  of  the  personal  impact  as  patient  reported  outcomes  (Index  of  Premature 
Ejaculation).  This  is  welcome  since  PE  is  considered  a  multidimensional  condition.  Besides,  it  reflects 
the relevant aspects included in the definition of the condition. Both IELT and IPE questionnaire can be 
considered standard methods of measurement and have been widely used in PE clinical research.  
IELT  was  measured  with  a  stopwatch.  As  the  stopwatch  could  be  operated  by  the  subject  or  the 
partner (always the same subject during the trial) some differences in the measures could result from 
it.  It  can  be  relevant  in  those  outcomes  (secondary  endpoints)  in  which  absolute  means  instead  of 
changes with respect to baseline are considered in the estimation (e.g. % subjects with mean IELT > 1 
or 2 minutes).  
Response  was  also  measured  in  terms  of  responder  rates:  IELT  >  1  minute  (according  the  ISSM 
definition) and IELT  > 2 minutes. Although important, “normalisation” of the time to ejaculation does 
not result as significant as the perceived improvement by the subject.  
With  respect  to  PRO  (Patient-reported  outcomes),  control  over  ejaculation  and  satisfaction  were 
considered  the  two  most  relevant  measures.  Control  has  been  described  as  the  key  outcome  of  the 
impact of the condition.  
The PEP has been validated in subjects with PE satisfying the DSM-IV criteria (without restrictions on 
IELT)  and  it  has  been  widely  used  as  PRO  in  published  studies  on  PE.  Relevantly,  this  outcome  also 
monitors the partner’s perception.

Efficacy endpoints 
Intravaginal  ejaculatory  latency  time:  Subjects  were  instructed  to  start  timing  at  the  time  of  vaginal 
penetration  and  to  stop  at  the  start  of  ejaculation.  Subjects  (or  their  sexual  partner)  were  to  be 
provided with a stopwatch, and were to record the stopwatch recorded IELT in the diary card for each 
sexual encounter when IP was used. When ejaculation happened before penetration, then the IELT was 
set to zero, and if the subject was unable to ejaculate, then the IELT was recorded as missing.  
During  the  double-blind  treatment  phase  of  the  study,  the  person  recording  the  IELT  (subject  or  his 
partner) was to remain the same.  
Index  of  premature  ejaculation:  The  IPE  is  a  10-item  questionnaire  with  three  domains:  ejaculatory 
control (4 questions), distress (2 questions) and sexual satisfaction (4 questions). The 10 items were 
individually scored as follows: 
• 
• 
Items 1-8 scored 5 to 1 in descending order with the ‘No sexual intercourse, not applicable 
category’ set to missing. 
Items 9-10 scored 1 to 5 in ascending order with the ‘No sexual intercourse, not applicable 
category’ set to missing. 
Control  scores  range  from  4  to  20  with  a  higher  score  indicating  greater  control.  Satisfaction  scores 
range from 4 to 20 with a higher score indicating greater satisfaction. Distress scores range from 2 to 
10 with a higher score indicating less distress.  
Premature Ejaculation Profile: The PEP is a 4 item questionnaire validated for use in PE. Questions were 
related  to  perceived  control  over  ejaculation,  satisfaction  with  sexual  intercourse,  personal  distress  
related  to  ejaculation,  and  interpersonal  difficulty  related  to  ejaculation,  each  answered  on  a  5-point 
scale,  with  a  maximum  score  of  5  points  for  each  question,  and  higher  scores  representing  better 
functioning. Subjects’ sexual partners were to complete a 4 point PEP questionnaire. The questions to 
be  answered  by  the  female  sexual  partners  were  identical  to  those  of  the  subjects’  questionnaire 
except that the females were asked to consider their partners’ ejaculation when giving responses. 
Global ratings: The study PSD502-PE-002 incorporated global ratings of the quality of orgasm (change 
from baseline), of distress, control and satisfaction and the opinion of the study medication answering 
the following questions:  
• 
• 
• 
“In general, how do you rate the orgasm you experience during sexual intercourse?” with a 5-
point scale ranging from “Very poor” to “Very Good”.  
“What  was  your  opinion  of  the  study  medication?”  with  a  4-point  scale  from  “Poor”  to 
“Excellent”.  
“Compared to when you started this study, how do you rate  
o 
the distress you experience during sexual intercourse?” 
o  your ability to control your time to ejaculation during sexual intercourse?” 
o  your satisfaction with sexual intercourse?” 
The  subjects  were  to  provide  their  answers  using  a  4-point  scale  of  “no  change/worse”,  “small 
improvement”,  “moderate  improvement”  and  “large  improvement”.  These  questions  were  to  serve  as 
‘anchor’  questions  in  the  estimation  of  the  minimum  clinically  important  difference  (MCID)  of  the  IPE 
domains. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 54/126 
 
 
 
 
The primary measures of efficacy were the: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
change in mean IELT from Baseline to during the 3 months of double-blind treatment 
change in the IPE domain of ejaculatory control from Baseline to month 3 
change in the IPE domain of sexual satisfaction from Baseline to month 3 
change in the IPE domain of distress from Baseline to month 3 (in study PE-004 it was 
measured as secondary variable) 
The secondary measures of efficacy were the: 
• 
proportion  of  subjects  with  mean  IELT  >  1  minute  and  >  2  minutes  during  the  3 
months of double-blind treatment 
• 
• 
change in mean IELT from Baseline to each month of double-blind treatment 
change in the IPE domains of ejaculatory control, distress and sexual satisfaction from 
Baseline to months 1 and 2 separately 
• 
scores  for  perceived  control  over  ejaculation,  personal  distress  related  to  ejaculation, 
satisfaction with sexual intercourse and interpersonal difficulty related to ejaculation based on 
the subject PEP and the partner at months 1, 2 and 3. 
Sample size 
Due to the co-primary variables in this study, a fixed sequence Bonferroni procedure was to be used to 
maintain the overall level of significance at no greater than 5%. Based on data from a previous Phase 
II  study  of  PSD502  in  PE  (PSD502-PE-001),  it  was  calculated  that  with  240  to  300  subjects  this 
procedure would provide in excess of 95% power to detect a statistically significant treatment effect on 
at  least  one  of  the  endpoints.  Unconditionally,  there  was  to  be  an  excess  of  95%  power  to  detect  a 
statistically  significant  2-fold  increase  in  mean  IELT  for  PSD502  versus  placebo  at  the  5%  level  of 
significance  and  at  least  95%  power  to  detect  a  statistically  significant  moderate  effect  size  (Cohen’s 
effect size of 0.55) difference for PSD502 versus placebo in the IPE domains of ejaculatory control and 
sexual satisfaction individually.  
Randomisation 
Patients  who  met  the  inclusion  criteria  and  did  not  meet  the  exclusion  criteria  at  the  end  of  the 
screening  period,  were  randomized  to  1  of  the  treatment  groups  in  a  2:1  ratio  using  a  computer-
generated randomization scheme. Randomization was stratified by study site. 
Blinding (masking) 
The  study  design  incorporated  both  a  double-blind  treatment  phase  and  an  optional  open  label 
treatment  phase.  The  first  three  months  of  the  treatment  phase  of  the  studies  was  a  double-blind 
phase  (PSD502  and  placebo).  The  cold  sensation  caused  by  the  latent  heat  of  evaporation  from  the 
placebo spray sufficiently  mimicked the numbing effect of the  PSD502 spray  and therefore supported 
blinding. 
The open-label design allowed all study subjects an opportunity for treatment with active treatment.

Statistical methods 
All randomised subjects that received the study drug were to be included in the Intent-to- Treat (ITT) 
population.  The  ITT  population  was  to  be  used  for  the  summary  of  all  Baseline  characteristics  and 
primary analysis of efficacy data. The PP population was a subset of the ITT population and was to be 
formed  by  excluding  subjects  with  major  protocol  deviations  that  could  have  affected  the  efficacy 
assessments. All subjects that received the study drug were to be included in the safety population.  
For  each  study  the  statistical  analysis  plan  (SAP)  (and  the  SAP  for  the  interim  analysis  of  Study 
PSD502-PE-002) were finalised before the respective database locks.   
Eligible  subjects  were  randomised  to  either  PSD502  or  placebo  in  a  2:1  ratio  with  stratification  by 
centre.  Centres that contained less than 12 subjects were pooled with similar centres within the same 
country such that pooled centres were similarly sized and contained no more than 24 subjects. 
Analysis  of  mean  IELT  over  the  3-month  treatment  period  was  conducted  on  log-transformed  data 
using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including factors for pooled centre and treatment and 
with  the  baseline  value  as  a  covariate.    The  treatment  effect  of  PSD502  compared  to  placebo  was 
estimated together with the associated 95% confidence interval which was transformed back to show 
the estimate ratio of treatment effects.  A similar ANCOVA model was used to analyse the domains of 
the IPE without first log-transforming the data.  A multiple testing procedure was pre-defined in order 
to control the Type I error.  All tests were two-sided. 
Missing  data  were  handled  as  follows.    For  subjects  who  withdrew,  the  IELT  was  based  on  available 
data  within  the  month  that  withdrawal  occurred.    For  subjects  with  no  IELT  data  during  a  particular 
period, the mean IELT was set to the mean IELT from the baseline period, baseline observation carried 
forward (BOCF).  For subjects withdrawing during the double-blind phase, the IPE questionnaire was to 
be  completed  at  the  time  of  withdrawal.    For  nominal  visits  after  withdrawal,  the  IPE  scores  were 
carried  forward  from  the  last  visit,  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF).    If  a  subject  attended  a 
visit but did not complete the  IPE questionnaire or  only provided partially completed information, the 
domains  scores  were  considered  to  be  missing.    Subjects  withdrawing  before  completing  any 
questionnaire would have the domain scores set to the baseline values. 
Various  sensitivity  analyses  were  to  be  performed  to  examine  the  robustness  of  the  results  of  the 
analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  variables  for  the  ITT  population.    These  were  to  include  an  analysis 
using the observed data and an analysis based on the PP population.   
Changes in the planned statistical analyses 
The  following  changes  to  the  protocol-planned  analyses  were  described  in  the  SAPs,  which  were 
approved prior to database lock and unblinding. 
The  ‘interim’  analysis  conducted  in  Study  PSD502-PE-002  to  estimate  the  MCID  and  investigate  the 
sensitivity  to  change  of  the  IPE,  undertaken  after  approximately  half  of  the  enrolled  subjects  had 
completed the double-blind phase of the study, was repeated at the end of the study to utilise the full 
study data to provide a more powerful analysis. 
The  protocol  stated  that  the  relationship  of  the  IPE  domains  with  IELT  was  to  be  investigated. 
However, emerging data showed that there was significant number of subjects with IPE domain scores 
at  the  minimum  or  maximum  values  potentially  masking  such  a  relationship.  Consequently,  this 
analysis was not undertaken. 
An additional summary of the incidence of treatment-related AEs starting on the same day or the day 
after use of the study spray was also performed to provide additional information on AEs commencing 
immediately following treatment.  
In  Studies  PSD502-PE-002  and  PSD502-PE-004  data  from  the  double-blind  part  of  the  study  were 
analysed  following  database  lock  after  all  subjects  had  completed  the  double-blind  treatment  phase.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 56/126 
 
 
 
 
 
Following  the  re-opening  of  the  database  to  enter  and  clean  accumulating  data  from  the  open-label 
phase,  a  small  amount  of  data  from  the  double-blind  phase  was  further  cleaned.    Consequently  all 
affected analyses were re-run following database lock after all subjects had completed each study as a 
whole  and  the  results  were  compared  against  the  original  analyses.    They  were  found  to  be  not 
significantly affected 
Results 
Study PE-002 
Of the 256 patients enrolled a total of 29 randomised subjects (21 to receive PSD502 and 8 subjects to 
receive  Placebo)  withdrew  during  the  double-blind  treatment  phase.  Seven  of  the  withdrawals  (4  in 
PSD502/3 in Placebo) were by subjects prior to them using the assigned treatment.  
For  the  remaining  17  subjects  who  withdrew  following  commencement  of  PSD502  treatment,  7 
subjects  withdrew  due  to  withdrawal  of  consent  by  the  subject,  5  subjects  were  lost  to  follow-up,  3 
subjects  (withdrew  due  to  intolerable  AEs  and  1  subject  (1303)  withdrew  as  a  result  of  Sponsor’s 
decision.  
In the Placebo group, 2 subjects withdrew due to withdrawal of consent by the subject and 3 subjects 
were lost to follow-up. 
Table 20: Study PE-002 - Subject disposition 
Study PE-004 
A  total  of  335  subjects  provided  written  informed  consent  and  were  screened.  Of  these,  35  subjects 
failed screening. The most common reason for failing screening was failure of the subject to meet the 
study entry criteria.  
A  total  of  31  study  sites  across  4  European  countries  randomised  300  study  subjects  (PSD502:  200 
subjects;  Placebo:  100  subjects).  Of  these,  22  subjects  withdrew  during  the  double-blind  treatment 
phase  (PSD502:  18  subjects;  Placebo:  4  subjects).  Half  of  the  withdrawals  in  the  PSD502  treatment 
group  were  by  subjects  prior  to  them  using  PSD502  (5  withdrawals  of  consent  by  the  subject,  3 
subjects lost to follow-up and 1 withdrawal of consent by subject’s sexual partner). For the remaining 9 
subjects  who  withdrew  following  commencement  of  PSD502  treatment,  4  subjects  withdrew  due  to 
withdrawal  of  consent  by  the  subject  or  the  subject’s  sexual  partner,  2  subjects  withdrew  due  to

intolerable  AEs,  2  subjects  were  lost  to  follow-up  and  1  subject  withdrew  as  a  result  of  Sponsor’s 
decision.  
In the Placebo group, a total of 4 subjects who  were randomised to receive placebo discontinued the 
study  during  the  double  blind  phase.  Of  these,  1  subject  withdrew  consent  prior  to  commencing 
treatment. Of the remaining 3 subjects who withdrew after receiving at least a single dose of Placebo, 
2 subjects withdrew due to withdrawal of consent by the subject and the remaining subject was lost to 
follow-up. 
Table 21: Study PE-004 - Subject disposition 
Recruitment 
A  total  of  22  subjects  treated  with  PSD502  in  the  double-blind  phase  had  acquired  PE  (6.1%  of  the 
population), 19 of whom were recruited in study PSD502-PE-002 in the USA and Canada as these were 
the  only  countries  where  recruitment  started  before  the  implementation  of  the  protocol  amendment 
requiring  subjects  to  have  lifelong  PE.  There  appears  to  be  no  evidence  that  men  with  acquired  PE 
respond differently to PSD502 than to men with lifelong PE. 
Conduct of the study 
A number of amendments were approved to exclude patients with HIV, HBV and HCV, update definition 
of PE according to the ISSM criteria, clarify the use of condoms in the open label phase clarification of 
data collection etc. 
Baseline data 
In Study PE-002 male subjects in the ITT population were 18 to 68 years of age and had a mean age 
of  38.7  years.  Over  80%  of  the  subjects  were  of  white  ethnic  origin,  with  Afro-Caribbean  being  the 
next represented ethnic group (8.4%). The BMI ranged from 17.9 kg/m2 to 52.1 kg/m2, with a mean 
BMI of 27.29 kg/m2.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013

Approximately  half  of  the  ITT  population  had  been  circumcised  (USA:  circumcised  87.5%, 
uncircumcised 12.5%; Canada: circumcised 61.9%, uncircumcised 38.1%; Poland: circumcised 5.0%, 
uncircumcised 95.5%). 
In Study PE-004 male subjects in the ITT population were 19 to 65 years of age and had a mean age 
of  34.8  years.  All  but  3  of  the  290  subjects  (99%)  were  white.  The  BMI  ranged  from  17.9  kg/m2  to 
43.3  kg/m2,  with  a  mean  BMI  of  26.22  kg/m2.  Less  than  7%  of  the  ITT  population  had  been 
circumcised.  
Numbers analysed 
Totals of 249 and 290 subjects comprised the ITT populations for the PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-
004  studies,  respectively,  which  was  97%  of  the  randomized  population  in  both  cases.  Totals  of  193 
and  237  subjects  comprised  the  Per  Protocol  populations,  representing  75%  and  79%  of  the 
randomized populations in PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004 studies, respectively. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Baseline PE measures for the ITT population for both studies are summarised in Table 22.

Table 22:   Baseline Premature Ejaculation Measures: ITT Population 
(PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004 Individually) 
In  Study  PE-002  a  median  of  13  doses  of  PSD502 and  12  doses of  placebo were  administered  in  the 
double-blind phase. 
In Study PE-004 a median of 15.0 doses of PSD502 and placebo were administered in the double-blind 
phase. 
Primary endpoint 
The  effectiveness  of  PSD502  in  treating  PE  was  assessed  by  measuring  IELT  and  the  co-primary 
endpoints of ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction and distress using the IPE. 
• 
IELT 
Over  the  3  month  double-blind  treatment  phase,  the  geometric  mean  IELT  for  subjects  in  the  ITT 
population of PSD502-PE-002 had increased to 2.59 minutes in the PSD502 group and to 0.80 minutes 
in the placebo group, and in PSD502-PE-004, had increased to 3.79 minutes in the PSD502 group and 
1.07 minutes in the placebo group. 
Subjects  who  received  PSD502  had  a  4.66-fold  increase  in  their  adjusted  geometric  mean  IELT  in 
PSD502-PE-002  and  a  6.30-fold  increase  in  their  adjusted  mean  IELT  in  PSD502-PE-004,  whereas 
those  who  received  placebo  demonstrated  a  1.53-fold  increase  in  PSD502-PE-002  and  a  1.74-fold 
increase in PSD502-PE-004. The analysis of the ratio to baseline over the 3 month treatment phase for 
PSD502/Placebo  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  3.05-fold  (95%CI:  2.29,  4.06)  treatment 
benefit  in  favour  of  PSD502  (p<0.0001;  significance  level=0.0125)  in  PSD502-PE-002  and  a

IPE: Change from baseline in IPE domain scores at month 3 
For  the  ITT  population,  substantial  improvement  was  observed  in  all  3  domains  at  month  3  in  the 
PSD502 groups of both studies compared with the placebo groups. The improvements in the scores for 
all  3  domains  were  slightly  higher  in  the  PE-004  study  than  in  the  PE-002  study,  even  though  the 
baseline scores for all 3 domains were also higher in PE-004 (Table 24).

At  the  end  of  each  month  of  study  treatment,  a  greater  proportion  of  subjects  who  received  PSD502 
than placebo attained a mean IELT >1 minute and >2 minutes in both of the pivotal studies. A higher 
proportion of subjects in the PSD502-PE-004 study  attained a mean IELT >1  minute and >2 minutes 
(PSD502 and placebo groups) than in the PSD502-PE-002 study.

Table 27: 
•  Change from baseline to each month of double blind treatment 
At  the  end  of  each  month  of  the  double-blind  treatment  phase,  the  geometric  mean  IELT  for  all 
subjects  in  the  ITT  population  had  increased  more  from  baseline  in  the  PSD502  treatment  groups  of 
both pivotal studies and smaller improvements were seen in the placebo groups.  
At  the  end  of  months  1  and  2,  subjects  treated  with  PSD502  had  larger  changes  (representing  an 
improvement)  in  their  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  scores  for  each  of  the  IPE  domains  than 
subjects  who  received  placebo.  The  changes  from  baseline  were  generally  slightly  larger  in  the 
PSD502-PE-004 than the PSD502-PE-002 study for all domains at both months 1 and 2. 
• 
PEP: subjects and partners (Change from baseline in PEP domain scores) 
In both studies, the PEP scores for subjects and partners followed a similar pattern of improvement to 
the IELT and IPE scores 
At the end of each of months 1, 2 and 3, more subjects treated with PSD502 than Placebo had at least 
a  1  point  category  improvement  in  each  of  the  PEP  domains  of  perceived  control  over  ejaculation, 
personal distress related to ejaculation, satisfaction with sexual intercourse and interpersonal difficulty 
related to ejaculation. 
In PSD502-PE-002 at month 3, the proportion of PSD502-treated subjects who indicated a response of 
‘very  good’  or  ‘good’  was  33.4%  for  control  and  41.0%  for  satisfaction  compared  with  2.5%  and 
10.1%,  respectively,  of  placebo-treated  subjects.  The  proportion  of  PSD502-treated  subjects  with  a 
response  of  ‘not  at  all’  or  ‘a  little  bit’  was  43.6%  for  distress  and  59.0%  for  interpersonal  difficulty 
compared with 13.9% and 31.6%, respectively, for placebo-treated subjects. 
In PSD502-PE-004 at month 3, the proportion of PSD502-treated subjects who indicated a response of 
‘very good’ or ‘good’ was 40.7% for control and 51.1% for satisfaction compared with 8.4% and 9.4%, 
respectively,  of  placebo-treated  subjects.  The  proportion  of  PSD502-treated  subjects  with  a  response 
of  ‘not  at  all’  or  ‘a  little  bit’  was  55.4%  for  distress  and  69.5%  for  interpersonal  difficulty  compared 
with 18.8% and 32.3%, respectively, for placebo-treated subjects.

At the end of month 3, more partners in the PSD502 group than in the Placebo group had at least a 1 
point category improvement in each of the PEP domains of perceived control over ejaculation, personal 
distress related to ejaculation, satisfaction with sexual intercourse and interpersonal difficulty related to 
ejaculation.

Table 29:  
Additional endpoints 
In Study PE-002 the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the change from baseline in the 
IPE domains was estimated to be 2.9 to 4.3 points for ejaculatory control, 2.9 to 4.6 points for sexual 
satisfaction,  and  1.4  to  1.5  points  for  distress.    The  MCID  for  the  ratio  to  baseline  mean  IELT  was 
estimated  to  be  2  to  3-fold.    As  the  treatment  effects  for  the  primary  endpoints  exceed  these 
estimates, the clinical significance of the results is further demonstrated. 
The  relationship  between  the  IPE  domains  and  IELT  was  not  undertaken  because  data  showed  that  a 
large  number  of  subjects  had  IPE  domain  scores  at  the  minimum  or  maximum  values,  potentially 
masking any relationship with IELT. 
Other measures of treatment effectiveness also demonstrated significant improvements: 
•    At  the  end  of  the  3  month  double-blind  treatment  phase,  the  proportion  of  subjects  rating  the 
quality of their orgasm ‘Poor’ or ‘Very poor’ reduced by approximately 3-fold from baseline in subjects 
receiving  PSD502  (baseline:  59.3%;  month  3:  20.1%)  in  PSD502-PE-002  and  over  3-fold  from 
baseline  in  subjects  receiving  PSD502  (baseline:  57.5%;  month  3:  16.2%)  in  PSD502-PE-004.  This 
contrasted  with  findings  in  the  placebo-treated  subjects  where  the  proportion  of  subjects  rating  the 
CHMP assessment report

quality  of  their  orgasm  ‘Poor’  or  ‘Very  poor’  at  the  end  of  month  3  was  lower  by  approximately  10% 
(baseline:  60.0%;  month  3:  48.7%)  in  PSD502-PE-002  and  unchanged  (baseline:  57.1%;  month  3: 
51.5%) in PSD502-PE-004. 
•   At the end of the 3 month double-blind treatment phase, more PSD502 subjects than Placebo 
subjects rated the study medication as ‘Excellent’. In contrast, the worst rating of ‘Poor’ was assigned 
by more Placebo subjects than PSD502 subjects. 
Table 30: 
Open-label extension 
At the end of the double-blind treatment phase in pivotal studies PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004 
subjects had the option to participate in the open-label treatment phase in which all subjects received 
treatment with PSD502. The duration of the open-label phase was 5 months in PSD502-PE-002 and 9 
months in PSD502-PE-004.  
A  total  of  497  subjects  (98.4%  of  those  completing  the  double-blind  phase)  entered  the  open-label 
phase of the studies. Most (90.3%) of the subjects completed the open label phase. The most common 
reasons  for  discontinuing  early  were  subject/partner  request  and  lost  to  follow-up  (each  4.4%), 
followed  by  investigator’s  decision  (0.6%),  and  adverse  event,  protocol  violation,  and  sponsor’s 
decision (each 0.2%).

Table 31:   Subject  Disposition:  Randomized  Population  (Combined  PSD502-PE-002  and 
PSD502-PE-004) 
•  Change in mean IELT and IPE domain scores over time 
For all subjects in the open-label treatment phase, the ratio to baseline geometric mean IELT ranged 
from 5.62 (Visit 6) to 6.73 (Visit 7) in PSD502-PE-002, and from 8.39 (Visit 6) to 10.39 (Visit 10) in 
the  PSD502-PE-  004  study.  This  trend  was  consistent  for  the  groups  who  had  received  PSD502  or 
placebo in the double-blind phase as well as for all subjects in each open label phase. 
For those subjects who received placebo during the double-blind phase and switched to PSD502 during 
the  open-label  phase,  marked  improvements  in  IELT  were  observed  at  the  first  assessment  after 
initiating treatment with PSD502. Subjects who received PSD502 in the double-blind treatment phases 
of the both studies had slightly higher ratio to baseline geometric mean IELTs at Visits 6-8 in the open-
label treatment phase than those subjects who had previously received placebo during the double-blind 
treatment phase of the study. However, at Visit 10 in PSD502-PE-004 (following a full 9 months open-
label treatment with PSD502), this difference was no longer apparent.

Figure 4: 
•  Change from baseline in IPE domain scores 
Improvement  was  also  observed  in  IPE  domain  scores  from  the  end  of  the  double-blind  treatment 
phase  to  the  end  of  the  open-label  phase.  The  mean  change  from  baseline  for  ejaculatory  control, 
sexual  satisfaction,  and  distress  score  was  12.3,  10.9,  and  5.3  points,  respectively  at  the  end  of  the 
open-label  phase.  These  results  demonstrate  that  PSD502  was  as  effective  in  delaying  ejaculation, 
improving  ejaculatory  control  and  sexual  satisfaction,  and  reducing  distress  at  the  end  of  the  open-
label treatment period (month 12) as at the end of double-blind treatment period (month 3). 
Ancillary analyses 
A  subgroup  analyses was  carried  out on  the  controlled  PE  Studies  population  which  included  subjects 
from PSD502-PE-001, PSD502-PE-002, PSD502-PE-004, and the 30 mg level of PSD502-PE-005.  
Hepatic and Renal Impairment 
The  effect  of  chronic  renal  failure  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  lidocaine  has  been  investigated  in  a 
literature-based  study.    Lidocaine  (1 mg/kg)  was  administered  as  an  intravenous  injection  to  healthy 
subjects,  subjects  with  moderate  renal  insufficiency,  subjects  with  severe  renal  insufficiency,  and 
functionally  anephric  patients  undergoing  long-term  haemodialysis.  Results  of  this  study  showed  that 
clearance  in  subjects  with  severe  renal  insufficiency  was  approximately  half  that  of  the  healthy 
volunteers (6.01 ± 2.54 mL/minute x kg vs. 11.87 ± 2.97 mL/minute x kg; p <0.001), and the half-
life was approximately doubled (4.55 ± 1.71 hours vs. 2.24 ± 0.55 hours, p <0.001). No such changes 
were observed in subjects undergoing regular haemodialysis, whose values were similar to those of the 
healthy volunteers. 
Incidence of Adverse Events by Age Group 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 70/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When TEAEs were analysed by age group for the Controlled PE Studies population, the most common 
TEAEs across all age groups were the genital complaints of erectile dysfunction and hypoaesthesia, as 
observed  in  the  full  PSD502  Glanspenis-treated  Subjects  population.  Taking  into  consideration  the 
variable number of subjects in each age group (i.e., 149 subjects in the 25 to <35 years group and 6 
subjects  in  the  ≥65  years  group),  the  frequencies  of  these  events  across  the  age  groups  were 
generally comparable. All the events of erectile dysfunction and  hypoaesthesia were considered to be 
related to treatment with PSD502. Severe TEAEs and TEAEs leading to early discontinuation were also 
analysed by subject age group. No obvious trends were identified in these analyses. 
More than 90% of patients included in the controlled trials were younger than 55 years, the number of 
patients older than 65 years old were limited. Although PE is more common in the younger age group 
this has been addressed in the PI and RMP as missing information from the safety perspective.  
ED is also more frequent in the older population and it is a known AE for this combination of lidocaine 
and  prilocaine.  So,  at  present,  it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that  this  limited  participation  of  patients  older 
than 65 years of age have an impact on the safety profile of PSD502. This has been addressed in the 
RMP. 
Table 32:  
Incidence of Adverse Events by Body Weight 
The  frequency  of  these  events  was  comparable  in  the  BMI  subgroups.  The  frequency  of  drug-related 
vulvovaginal burning sensation was comparable in the partners of subjects in both BMI subgroups. 
Severe  TEAEs  and  TEAEs  leading  to  early  discontinuation  were  also  analysed  by  baseline  BMI.  No 
obvious trends were identified in these analyses.  
Incidence of Adverse Events by Circumcision Status  
In the Controlled PE Studies population, the events of erectile dysfunction and hypoaesthesia occurred 
more  frequently  in  uncircumcised  subjects  than  in  circumcised  subjects.  The  proportion  of 
uncircumcised subjects who experienced erectile dysfunction and hypoaesthesia were 3.8% and 2.4%, 
respectively.  In  contrast, 
in  circumcised  subjects  the  proportions  were  2.0%  and  1.0%, 
respectively. The events of ejaculation failure (0.7%) and genital erythema (0.7%) were only observed 
in uncircumcised subjects. One possible explanation for this difference is that the mucosa of the glans 
penis  tends  to  become  keratinised  following  circumcision,  and  PSD502  is  less  readily  absorbed  by 
keratinised  skin  than  mucosa.  The  frequency  of  vulvovaginal  burning  sensation  was  greater  in  the 
partners  of  circumcised  subjects  than  in  partners  of  uncircumcised  subjects  (9.0%  vs.  3.4%, 
respectively.  This  may  be  due  to  the  fact  that  the  drug  is  absorbed  better  through  the  poorly-
CHMP assessment report

keratinised  mucosa  of  the  uncircumcised  subjects,  thus  leaving  less  available  on  the  surface  for 
transfer to a partner. Severe TEAEs and TEAEs leading to early discontinuation were also analysed by 
circumcision status. No obvious trends were identified in these analyses. 
Table 33:  
Incidence of Adverse Events by Race 
The Controlled PE Studies population was predominantly Caucasian (approximately 90%). No obvious 
trends were observed for the subject racial subgroups, but interpretations should be made with caution 
since the majority of subjects were Caucasian. 
Incidence of Adverse Events by Lifelong/Acquired PE 
In  the  Controlled  PE  Studies  population,  subjects  with  lifelong  PE  had  events  of  erectile  dysfunction 
(3.5%) and hypoaesthesia (2.2%). There were no reports of these events in subjects with acquired PE. 
However, since the majority of subjects (approximately 85%) in the Controlled PE  Studies population 
had a diagnosis of lifelong PE, interpretations of the lifelong/acquired PE analyses should be made with 
caution. 
Incidence of Adverse Events by Categorical Ratio to Baseline IELT 
The number of PSD502-treated subjects with ratio to baseline IELT <1, 1 to <2, and ≥2 was 12, 56, 
and  290,  respectively.  Given  that  the  number  of  subjects  was  not  comparable  in  each  subgroup, 
interpretations  of  this  analysis  should  be  made  with  caution.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  erectile 
dysfunction and hypoaesthesia was 5.4% and 1.8%, respectively, in the 1 to <2 subgroup, and 2.8% 
and 1.7%, respectively, in the ≥2 subgroup. These events were not observed in the <1 subgroup. 
Summary of main efficacy results 
A statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect has been shown by this medicinal product in 
the treatment of lifelong premature ejaculation. It has been observed in objective measures as 
intravaginal latency time and also perceived as a psychological benefit by the subjects and their 
partners.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Data  from  studies  that  characterise  the  efficacy  of  PSD502  are  summarised  by  combining  data  from 
the two pivotal studies PSD502-PE-002 and PSD502-PE-004 using similar statistical methods to those 
described for each study. The IPE domain of distress was treated as a secondary endpoint in PSD502-
PE-004 and as a co-primary endpoint (changed through a protocol amendment) in PSD502-PE-002. For 
the combined analysis, the IPE domain score of distress was treated as a co-primary efficacy endpoint.

Most subjects (85.2%) in the PSD502 group achieved a mean IELT of >1 minute over the course of 3 
months  of  treatment  with  PSD502.  Even  though  there  was  a  highly  significant  difference  between 
PSD502 and placebo treated subjects, 46.4% of the placebo subjects had a mean IELT of >1 minute.

Table 37: 
•  Ratio to baseline of mean IELT during double-blind treatment by month 
Marked  improvement  in  IELT  was  observed  at  the  first  assessment  (month  1).  The  geometric  mean 
IELT increased from 0.581 minutes to 2.463 minutes in the PSD502 group and from 0.555 minutes to 
0.852 minutes in the placebo group. Analysis of covariance of the log-transformed values revealed that 
ejaculation was delayed 4.4-fold and 1.5-fold compared with baseline in PSD502 and placebo groups, 
respectively.  Similar  results  (PSD502  vs.  placebo)  were  observed  at  month  2  (5.0-fold  vs.  1.6-fold) 
and month 3 (5.3-fold vs. 1.7-fold). More than half of the PSD502- treated subjects had a mean IELT 
of >2 minutes at the end of months 1, 2 and 3 (53.9%, 62.0%, and 65.1% respectively). 
When compared with placebo, treatment with PSD502 resulted in a highly statistically significant delay 
in ejaculation of 2.9-fold (95% CI: 2.36, 3.44) at month 1; 3.2-fold (95% CI: 2.66, 3.88) at month 2 
and 3.2-fold (95% CI: 2.55, 3.92) at month 3; p <0.0001 for each month’s assessment.  
Change  was observed in the IPE domains of ejaculatory control, distress and  sexual satisfaction from 
baseline to months 1 and 2 separately. 
At month 1, the adjusted mean change (PSD502 vs. placebo) was 6.4 vs. 1.6 for ejaculatory control, 
5.9 vs. 1.7 for satisfaction, and 2.9 vs. 0.9 for distress. A similar result was observed at month 2.

and distress: 2.1 points (95% CI: 1.6, 2.5; p < 0.0001). A significant improvement was also observed 
at month 2. An improvement of 5.9 points (95% CI: 5.0, 6.7) for ejaculatory control, 5.2 points (95% 
CI: 4.3, 6.1) for sexual satisfaction, and 2.4 points (95% CI: 2.0, 2.8) for distress at month 2; all were 
significant at the p <0.0001 level. 
•  Subject PEP: Change from baseline in scores based on the subject PEP at months 1, 2 and 3 
The  chi-squared  test  for  trend  revealed  a  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  subjects’  PEP 
responses in favour of PSD502 (p <0.0001 for each parameter) for all three monthly assessments. At 
month 3, the proportion of PSD502-treated subjects who indicated a response of ‘very good’ or ‘good’ 
was  37.3%  for  control  and  46.5%  for  satisfaction  compared  with  5.7%  and  9.7%,  respectively,  of 
placebo-treated subjects. The proportion of PSD502-treated subjects with a response of ‘not at all’ or ‘a 
little  bit’  was  50.0%  for  distress  and  64.7%  for  interpersonal  difficulty  compared  with  16.6%  and 
32.0%, respectively, for placebo-treated subjects. 
• 
Partner PEP: Change from baseline in scores based on the partner PEP at month 3 
A statistically significant difference in favour of PSD502 was also observed for partner PEP responses (p 
<0.0001  for  each  parameter).  The  proportion  of  PSD502-treated  subjects’  partners  who  indicated  a 
response  of  ‘very  good’  or  ‘good’  was  35.9%  for  control  and  43.0%  for  satisfaction  compared  with 
10.5% and 16.5%, respectively, for placebo-treated subjects’ partners. 
The proportion of PSD502-treated subjects’ partners with a response of ‘not at all’ or ‘a little bit’ was 
58.3%  for  distress  and  70.4%  for  interpersonal  difficulty  compared  with  31.7%  and  44.1%, 
respectively, for placebo-treated subjects’ partners.

Supportive studies 
• 
ANAE-059-00 
ANAE-059-00 was a single-centre, open-label, uncontrolled, proof-of-concept investigator-led study.  
The  primary  objective  of  ANAE-059-00  was  to  measure  IELT  in  men  with  PE  before  and  after  the 
application  of  PSD502  to  the  penis.  The  subjects  eligible  for  enrolment  into  ANAE-059-00  were  men 
aged  21  to  70  years  inclusive,  with  self-reported  sexual  dissatisfaction  due  to  PE,  and  referral  to  a 
urology clinic. Subjects were instructed to use the spray on five consecutive encounters and to record 
the number of sprays and duration of  use in each case. Subjects were instructed to apply between 3 
and 5 sprays of PSD502 to the glans penis (depending on the size of the glans), approximately 15 to 
30 minutes before intercourse.  
A  sample  size  of  15  subjects  was  chosen  as  it  would  provide  statistical  significance  if  the  IELT  times 
increased from two minutes to over 10 minutes. 
A total of 14 subjects were treated. Of these, 3 subjects withdrew. The population had a mean age of 
41 years and experienced PE for a mean of 10.2 years. Subjects reported a mean IELT of 55 seconds 
(range, 5 to 120 seconds). Eleven subjects used PSD502 on at least one occasion and recorded at least 
one  quantitative  efficacy  measurement.  The  mean  duration  for  which  TEMPE  was  applied  prior  to 
initiating intercourse was 17.8 minutes (range from 5 to 45 minutes per encounter).  
The mean (SD) IELT increased from 1.4 minutes (± 1.1 minute) to 11.35 minutes (± 10.7 minutes; p 
=  0.008)  after  treatment,  representing  a  9-fold  increase  of  the  mean.  No  subject  experienced  a 
decrease  in  IELT.  The  mean  sexual  satisfaction  scores  after  treatment  for  both  subjects  and  partners 
were +1, on a scale where -1 was worse, 0 the same, +1 better, and +2 much better. The duration of 
PSD502 application (5 to 45 minutes) did not appear to affect either the change in IELT or the sexual 
satisfaction scores. 
Four  subjects  and  three  partners  reported  genital  numbness  on  at  least  one  occasion,  one  subject 
reported  a  burning  sensation  on  the  first  application  one  subject  reported  itching  scrotum  with  red 
spots after the first application, four subjects reported difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection / 
ejaculating on at least once occasion.  
This study mainly contributed to safety data provision of PSD502. No sound conclusions on efficacy can 
be drawn.  
• 
PSD502-PE-001 
PSD502-PE-001  was  a  multicentre,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  study  which 
included subjects who fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria, in which a time limit for IELT is not included. This 
Phase II pilot study was the first controlled study evaluating the efficacy of PSD502 in the treatment of 
PE.    A  treatment  regimen  of  3  sprays  of  PSD502  (delivering  a total of  22.5  mg  lidocaine  and  7.5  mg 
prilocaine  in  a  eutectic  like  combination)  was  chosen.  Each  actuation  of  the  PSD502  spray  also 
contained  7.4  mg  ethanol  as  an  excipient.  Subjects  were  told  to  apply  3  sprays  to  the  glans  penis 
approximately  15  minutes  before  sexual  intercourse  and  to  wipe  off  excess  spray  before  penetration. 
Subjects  were  instructed  to  use  the  spray  for  a  total  of  4  occasions  during  the  1-month  treatment 
period but not more than once in any 24-hour period. 
The  primary  objective  of  PSD502-PE-001  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  PSD502  compared  with 
placebo  in  treating  subjects  with  PE.  The  study  had  a  one-month  baseline  period  in  which  subjects 
recorded baseline IELT on three separate occasions and completed baseline questionnaires.

The primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients who had at least two sexual encounters 
where the IELT was ≥4 minutes following treatment. Change from baseline of IELT was promoted from 
a secondary to a co-primary variable in a protocol amendment. The secondary efficacy variables were 
IELT response (a response was defined as ≥2 IELT recordings of ≥2 minutes or ≥3 minutes in Month 2), 
the change in IEC score and the change in SQoL score.  
The sample size was based on data from the pilot study ANAE-059-00. A sample size of 25 patients per 
treatment  group  provides  between  70%  and  80%  power  to  detect  a  difference  of  40%  between 
PSD502  and  placebo,  at  the  α=0.05  level  of  significance  (two-sided).  To  take  account  of  missing  or 
incomplete data the sample size was increased by approximately 30% and hence 35 patients per group 
were to be entered into the study. 
A  total  of  54  subjects  (26  PSD502  and  28  placebo  subjects)  were  treated  in  this  study.  The  study 
population  was  predominantly  Caucasian  80%  with  a  mean  age  of  40  years.  The  observed  mean 
change  from  baseline  to  the  end  of  the  treatment  period  was  3.8  minutes  in  the  PSD502  group 
compared with 0.7 minutes in the placebo group. The estimated geometric means for the IELT during 
month  2,  derived  from  the  analysis  of  the  log-transformed  data,  were  2.50  and  1.04  minutes  for 
PSD502  and  placebo  respectively  representing  a  2.4-fold  (95%  CI:  1.3  to  4.4;  p<0.01)  difference  in 
favour  of  PSD502.  Twenty-five  percent  of  PSD502-treated  subjects  were  considered  responders  (at 
least two sexual encounters where the IELT was ≥4 minutes) compared with 13% of placebo. 
The effectiveness of PSD502 in treating PE was supported by positive trends in the IEC completed by 
subjects  and  SQoL  questionnaires  completed  separately  by  subjects  and  their  partners  at  the  end  of 
month 2.  
Differences  in  the  selection  criteria  of  the  patients  and  the  formulation  used  (containing  ethanol  as 
excipient) with respect to the pivotal studies prevent from considering it for efficacy.  
The Applicant has provided a comparison with Dapoxetine to offer information on the relative efficacy 
of  PSD502.  This  comparison  can  only  be  made  from  the  Dapoxetine  literature  and  the  PAR  since  a 
head-to-head comparison has not been performed in a clinical trial. Pooled IELTs from the Dapoxetine 
pivotal studies are summarized in the report issued by the Swedish Medicines Product Agency. After 12 
weeks DB treatment, mean IELTs increased from an average Baseline of 0.9 minutes, to 1.9 minutes 
(Placebo);  3.1  minutes  (Dapoxetine  30  mg)  and  3.6  minutes  (Dapoxetine  60  mg).  In  comparison, 
mean  IELTs  increased  from  a  Baseline  of  0.659  minutes  (PSD502)  and  0.665  (Placebo)  to  5.651  and 
1.389 minutes respectively in the pooled pivotal studies for PSD502. 
Despite  the  limitations  of  comparing  results  across  studies,  these  data  suggest  that  the  PSD502-
treated patients had shorter IELTs at Baseline, and  yet showed a much greater rise, to a final higher 
IELT  value,  with  a  greater  differential  from  placebo  than  either  of  the  Dapoxetine  doses.  It  is 
interesting to note that only 58% of patients in the Dapoxetine Pivotal studies had an average Baseline 
IELT of ≤1 minute and would, therefore have fulfilled the ISSM definition of PE. 
The main PRO used in the Dapoxetine studies was the PEP and the report only presented a composite 
responder endpoint, which was not used in the PSD502 studies. However, McMahon et al. published an 
integrated analysis of the results from five Dapoxetine Phase III Studies [54]. The PEP data from this 
publication,  together  with  the  corresponding  data  from  the  PSD502  Pivotal  studies  is  summarized  in 
Table 39. 
Table  39:  Subject  PEP  Results  –  PSD502  Combined  Pivotal  Studies  and  Dapoxetine 
Integrated Analysis

It  can  be  seen  that  the  patients  who  received  PSD502  in  the  PSD502  pivotal  studies  generally  had 
more severe (lower) PEP scores at baseline and these improved to a greater degree than the patients 
in the Dapoxetine studies, regardless of Dapoxetine dose. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Currently, there is no consensus as to what level of IELT constitutes a meaningful improvement in PE. 
While IELT may be viewed as an indicator of pharmacologic activity, the clinical relevance of achieving 
a given level of IELT or a given level of change in IELT is likely to differ from individual to individual. 
Therefore,  to  understand  the  improvement  in  IELT,  it  is  also  necessary  to  examine  the  relationships 
between IELT and responses to participant and partner outcome measures.  
A  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  effect  has  been  shown  by  this  medicinal  product in 
the  treatment  of  lifelong  premature  ejaculation.  It  has  been  observed  in  objective  measures  as 
intravaginal  latency  time  and  also  perceived  as  a  psychological  benefit  by  the  subjects  and  their 
partners. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The primary efficacy evaluation for PSD502 in the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE) is based on 
2  pivotal  trials  (with  open-label  extensions),  1  dose-range  finding  study  and  2  supportive  phase  2 
studies.  
Two additional studies (one conducted in patients with burns undergoing skin graft and one conducted 
in female patients undergoing hysteroscopy) have been submitted. They only have been considered for 
safety. 
Two pivotal randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, 12-week studies support the 
use of PSD502 in the treatment of subjects with premature ejaculation (studies PE-002 and PE-004). 
Data from these two studies were integrated for pooled-analyses.  
The population of subjects participating in these trials is adequate and representative for patients with 
lifelong  PE.  The  studies  enrolled  adult  male  subjects  (18  to  67  years  of  age)  according  to  the  two 
hallmarks  of  the  condition:  a  reduced  latency  time  for  ejaculation  (<  1  minute)  and  the  negative 
impact  on  the  individual.    These  criteria  correspond  to  the  definition  of  PE  published  by  the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 80/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
International Society for Sexual Medicine in 2008, when the pivotal trials were on-going. At that time a 
small proportion of subjects with acquired PE had been enrolled (6% of the total population). Since the 
new definition of PE only refers to lifelong PE the recruitment of those patients was stopped.  However, 
the primary efficacy analysis (ITT population) considered both groups of subjects. Given the differences 
between both syndromes (mainly related to the gradual onset of the symptoms and a more prolonged 
time  to  ejaculation  in  acquired  PE)  it  is  uncertain  that  the  results  obtained  in  lifelong  PE  can  be 
extrapolated  to  acquired  PE.  The  inclusion  of  the  PRO  and  control  over  ejaculation  and  satisfaction 
variables in the primary endpoint is acceptable. 
Subjects reported an ejaculatory latency time of 0.6 minutes. In addition a minimum of severity in the 
subjective perception was required. According to the lack of control over ejaculation, the reported level 
of distress and dissatisfaction with the sexual relationships the patients recruited in the pivotal studies 
mostly suffered from a severe condition. 
These results demonstrate that PSD502 was as effective in delaying ejaculation, improving ejaculatory 
control  and  sexual  satisfaction,  and  reducing  distress  at  the  end  of  the  open-label  treatment  period 
(month 12) as at the end of double-blind treatment period (month 3). 
Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were  comparable  between  the  two  groups.  Most  of  the 
subjects randomised were adults (only 6 patients were older than 65 years and 49 older than 55 years) 
and Caucasian subjects (>90%). The median duration of symptoms since diagnosis was 1 to 1.5 years 
and most of subjects (70%) had not been previously treated for PE.        
Subjects  were  treated  for  12  weeks.  Only  the  comparison  with  placebo  is  available.  The  justification 
provided by the Applicant about the lack of availability of dapoxetine (the only approved treatment for 
this condition) at the start of the studies is acknowledged. The additional difficulties of adding a third 
arm  by  a  different  route  of  administration,  mainly  when  most  of  treatments  are  administered  before 
sexual intercourse as on-demand basis are recognised.  
Only the 30 mg dose was formally studied. A dose-range finding study was conducted (Study PE-005) 
in  which  3  mg  and  53  mg  were  also  tested.  Taking  into  account  that  it  was  started  when  the  pivotal 
studies  were  already  ongoing  the  study  does  not  appear  to  provide  relevant  information  apart  from 
confirming  the  selection  of  the  dose.  Important  information  related  to  the  minimal  and  maximal 
effective dose, the optimum dose range or the dose adjustment in case of reporting insufficient effect 
or adverse events has not been established. Efficacy was primarily based on the effect on IELT and the 
improvement  of  the  control  over  ejaculation,  sexual  satisfaction  and  the  reduction  of  the  distress 
related to ejaculation (IPE domains). This is welcome since it addresses the multidimensional profile of 
the condition. 
IELT  was  measured  with  a  stopwatch.  Although  it  is  not  required  for  the  clinical  management  of  the 
condition it is recommended for the monitoring of IELT response in clinical research. As the stopwatch 
could  be  operated  by  the  subject  or  the  partner  (always  the  same  subject  during  the  trial)  some 
differences  in  the  measures  could  result  from  it.  It  can  be  relevant  in  those  outcomes  (secondary 
endpoints) in which absolute means instead of changes with respect to baseline are considered in the 
estimation (e.g. % subjects with mean IELT > 1 or 2 minutes). The Applicant has clarified during the 
procedure the  lack  of  potential  differences  in  patient’s  response  according  to  the  person  dealing  with 
the stopwatch. In addition, only one secondary endpoint could have been affected by this fact and their 
results were consistent with all the other endpoint results.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Over  the  3 month  double-blind  treatment  phase,  the  geometric  mean  IELT  for  subjects  in  the  ITT 
population of PSD502-PE-002 had increased to 2.59 minutes in the PSD502 group and to 0.80 minutes 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 81/126 
 
 
 
in the placebo group, and in PSD502-PE-004, had increased to 3.79 minutes in the PSD502 group and 
1.07 minutes in the placebo group, demonstrating a 4.66-fold and a 6.30-fold increase respectively for 
PSD502.  The  analysis  of  the  ratio  to  baseline  over  the  3 month  treatment  phase  for  PSD502/Placebo 
demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  3.05-fold  (95%CI:  2.29,  4.06)  treatment  benefit  in  favour  of 
PSD502  (p<0.0001;  significance  level=0.0125)  in  PSD502-PE-002  and  a  statistically  significant  3.62 
fold (95%CI: 2.80, 4.67) treatment benefit in favour of PSD502 (p<0.0001; significance level=0.0167) 
in PSD502-PE-004. 
This  effect  was  also  perceived  as  a  meaningful  change  by  the  patient  when  the  Index  of  Premature 
Ejaculation (IPE) domains were measured.  
For the IPE domains in the ITT population, substantial improvement was observed in all 3 domains at 
month  3  in  the  PSD502  groups  of  both  studies  compared  with  the  placebo  groups.      Changes  in 
adjusted mean scores (PSD502 vs. placebo) at month 3 for the ejaculatory control score were 7.3 vs. 
2.3 in PSD502-PE-002, and 9.2 vs. 2.2 in PSD502-PE-004, representing 5.0 point (95% CI: 3.61, 6.34) 
and  7.0  point  (95%  CI:  5.87,  8.18)  statistically  significant  treatment  benefits  in  favour  of  PSD502. 
Changes  in  adjusted  mean  scores  (PSD502  vs.  placebo)  at  month  3  for  the  sexual  satisfaction  score 
were 6.7 vs. 2.2 in PSD502-PE-002, and 7.8 vs. 1.9 in PSD502-PE-004, representing a 4.6 point (95% 
CI:  3.30,  5.84)  and  5.9  (95%  CI:  4.78,  7.04)  statistically  significant  treatment  benefits  in  favour  of 
PSD502 between the two study treatments. Changes in adjusted mean scores (PSD502 vs. placebo) at 
month 3 for the distress score were 3.5 vs. 1.0 in PSD502-PE-002, and 4.0 vs. 1.2 in PSD502-PE-004, 
representing  a  2.5  point  (95%  CI:  1.86,  3.20)  and  2.8  (95%  CI:  2.21,  3.31)  statistically  significant 
treatment benefits in favour of PSD502. 
Outcomes related to secondary variables also showed a statistically significant difference with respect 
to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment: 
•  When the effect on IELT is expressed as responder rate 85% of subjects treated with PSD502 
vs 46% of those treated with Placebo did not formally qualify as PE (IELT lasting > 1 minute). 
These differences were remarkable when more stringent definitions of responses were analysed 
(44%  of  PSD502  subjects  reaching  IELT  longer  than  4  minutes  compared  with  4%  of  those 
receiving Placebo) 
•  Changes in scores based on Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP) were also significantly superior 
for PSD502. Subjects treated with PSD502 and their partners reported higher levels of control 
over ejaculation and sexual satisfaction and lower distress and interpersonal difficulties related 
to ejaculation than those treated with placebo.   
The Applicant has performed an indirect contrast with the available published results from dapoxetine 
studies.  Bearing  in  mind  relevant  differences  between  populations  (inclusion  criteria,  severity  of  the 
condition) PSD502 could be comparable to Dapoxetine high dose, performing better than 30 mg dose.  
These results are comparable to the clinical results obtained in clinical trials with Dapoxetine with the 
IELT  as  primary  endpoints,  the  only  product  approved  for  this  indication.  In  the  Dapoxetine  trials, 
treatment  resulted  in  significant  improvement  in  mean  (SD)  IELT  at  the  endpoint  of  12  weeks  [1.66 
(2.087),  2.86  (3.588),  and  3.36  (3.973)  min  for  placebo,  dapoxetine  30  and  60  mg,  respectively  for 
the first pivotal study and 1.84 (2.335), 2.70 (3.386) and 3.28 (3.404) min in the second study]. The 
control  over  ejaculation  and  satisfaction  with  sexual  intercourse  also  improved.  In  both  Dapoxetine 
studies,  improvement  in  IELT  was  noted  from  the  first  dose  and  sustained  over  12  weeks.  Subgroup 
analyses using baseline average IELT≤1min and >1min showed similar results.  
The screening of the subjects was determined by the self-reported reduced ejaculation latency and the 
qualification of the impact by mean of IPE and PEP questionnaire. IELT was not part of this selection in 
CHMP assessment report

order  to  avoid  the  training  effect  on  the  IELT  derived  from  the  frequent  use  of  the  stopwatch.  This 
“learning” effect has already been described in the clinical investigation of other conditions (e.g. use of 
diaries  in  urinary  incontinence  trials)  and  its  main  consequence  is  a  remarkable  placebo  effect.  This 
was  described  in  dapoxetine  clinical  trials,  where  placebo  subjects  doubled  their  IELT  with  respect  to 
baseline measurement at the end of the treatment period.  This finding has not been so remarkable in 
clinical  trials  with  PSD502.  At  the  end  of  the  double  blind  phase  Placebo  treated  patients  achieved  a 
mean IELT below 1 minute (1.6 ratio with respect to baseline).  
Also  noteworthy  is  the  similar  number  of  encounters  (and  the  doses  of  the  product)  reported  in 
subjects on PSD502 and on placebo. Unless the couples did not report the sexual relationships in which 
spray was not used some differences would be expected between subjects experiencing improvement 
of  the  condition  and  satisfaction  with  the  results  and  those  without  changes  in  the  level  of  bother 
reported at baseline. These two features (the modest placebo effect and the lack of discrepancy in the 
on-demand use between placebo and active group) pose doubts regarding the maintenance of blinding 
during the trial.  The Applicant has explained that the sexual encounter frequency was not collected at 
baseline  as  an  efficacy  measure.  Whereas  it  appears  difficult  to  adequately  assess  the  effect  of 
treatment on this outcome the differences in satisfaction with sexual intercourse between both PSD502 
and placebo reported by patients and partners can be considered sufficiently supportive.   
Circumcised  subjects  showed  lower  benefit  than  uncircumcised  males.  The  Applicant  has  explained  it 
due  to  the  keratinisation  of  the  mucosa  of  the  glans  penis  in  circumcised  men  and  the  consequent 
reduction  in  penetration  of  the  product.  Admittedly,  some  relevant  differences  in  the  response  were 
also  observed  between  countries,  showing  the  subjects  recruited  in  USA  the  lowest  IELT  and  IPE 
values.  The  Applicant  has  attributed  this  finding  to  the  differences  in  circumcision  status  between 
countries and it has been further supported by additional analyses in the Response document provided 
by the Applicant.   
Other  demographic  characteristics  do  not  appear  to  influence  in  the  response  except  for  the  age, 
younger  subjects  reporting  greater  benefit  than  older  patients.  However,  the  limited  number  of 
subjects older than 65 years and even 55 years included in clinical trials does not allow to determine if 
such differences in fact exist.   
Long-term  efficacy  data  of  PSD502  come  from  the  open-label  phases  of  the  two  pivotal  trials.  No 
controlled data further to 12 weeks to support efficacy are available. Although the results obtained at 
12  months  do  not  suggest  loss  of  efficacy  it  provides  limited  evidence  regarding  the  maintenance  of 
the effect of PSD502. In this phase the use of condoms was permitted and according to the Applicant’s 
responses no relevant differences were observed on efficacy or safety profile of the product. However, 
the  lack  of  a  placebo  arm  and  of  the  precise  number  of  condom  users  prevent  from  reaching  valid 
conclusions  on  this  issue.  Data  from  literature  (mainly  related  to  the  use  of  EMLA  on  the  genital 
mucosa of male patients) are reassuring although a higher rate of local numbness and loss of erection 
could be reasonably expected.  This advice is included in the Product Information. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  was  demonstrated  in  two  multi-centre,  multinational, 
randomised,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled  studies,  both  followed  by  an  open-label  phase.  Men 
satisfying the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) criteria for premature ejaculation (PE) 
who had a baseline IELT ≤ 1 minute in at least 2 of the first 3 sexual encounters during screening were 
eligible to enrol. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 83/126 
 
 
 
 
Clinical trials have shown Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora to increase the intra-vaginal ejaculatory latency 
time  (IELT),  increase  control  over  ejaculation  and  reduce  the  feelings  of  distress  in  patients  with 
premature  ejaculation  as  measured  by  the  Index  of  Premature  Ejaculation  (IPE).    The  medicinal 
product has a rapid onset of action and is effective within 5 minutes of application.  The effectiveness 
of the medicinal product has been demonstrated to persist on repeat use over time. 
The effectiveness of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora in treating PE  was assessed by measuring  IELT and 
the co primary endpoints of ejaculatory control, sexual satisfaction, and distress using the IPE.  During 
the  3 months  of  the  double-blind  treatment  phase,  the  geometric  mean  IELT  increased  from  0.58  to 
3.17 minutes in the Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora group and from 0.56 to 0.94 minutes in the placebo 
group.  85.2%  of  subjects  in  the  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  group  achieved  a  mean  IELT  of 
> 1 minute over the course of 3 months of treatment with it, whereas 46.4% of the placebo subjects 
had a mean IELT of > 1 minute.  66.2% of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora-treated subjects and 18.8% of 
placebo-treated subjects achieved a mean IELT > 2 minutes. 
The clinically significant increases in IELT were paralleled by significant differences in the IPE scores (p 
<0.0001).  Adjusted mean change scores (Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora vs. placebo) at Month 3 were 
8.2 vs. 2.2 for the ejaculatory control score, 7.2 vs. 1.9 for the sexual satisfaction score, and 3.7 vs. 
1.1 for the distress score.   
In Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora-treated subjects, IELT and  IPE scores increased at the first measured 
timepoint.  Both IELT and IPE scores continued to increase slightly more throughout the remainder of 
the double-blind phase.  The positive changes in IELT and IPE domain scores were maintained during 
the open-label treatment phase.  
At each of the three monthly assessments all subjects completed a Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP) 
questionnaire  relating  to  perceived  control  over  ejaculation,  personal  distress  related  to  ejaculation, 
satisfaction with sexual intercourse, and interpersonal difficulty relating to ejaculation. The PEP scores 
followed  a  similar  pattern  of  improvement  to  the  IELT  and  IPE  scores.    For  all  of  the  three  monthly 
assessments completed by the subjects, there was a significant difference between Lidocaine/Prilocaine 
Plethora and placebo (p < 0.0001).  Partners completed the PEP questionnaire at month three.  There 
was  also  a  significant  difference  over  placebo  in  all  domains  for  the  responses  from  the  partners 
(p < 0.0001).  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical safety analysis of the use of 30 mg PSD502 in subjects with premature ejaculation (PE) and 
their sexual partners is based on ten studies, including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
four controlled PE studies (PSD502-PE-001 – pilot study, PSD502-PE-002 - pivotal study + PK, 
PSD502-004 - pivotal study, and PSD502-PE-005 – Dose ranging study) 
one uncontrolled PE study (ANAE-059-00 - open-label pilot) 
three  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  (PSD502-PE-003  in  healthy  male  volunteers  and  PSD502-
PE-006 and PSD502-PE-007 in healthy female volunteers) 
two non-PE studies in pain management (PSD502-PM-001 in patients undergoing skin grafts as 
treatment for burns and PSD502-UP-001 in patients undergoing hysteroscopy). 
For the integrated safety analysis, the following analysis populations were used: PSD502 Glans-penis-
treated  Subjects,  Controlled  PE  Studies,  Uncontrolled  Long-term  PE  Studies,  other  studies  (dose-
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 84/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ranging  study,  healthy  male  and  female  volunteer  studies,  pilot  PE  study  ANAE-059-00  and  non-PE 
studies).  
The  PSD502  Glans-penis-treated  Subjects  population  (subjects  who  received  repeated  doses  of 
PSD502  to  the  glans  penis),  and  their  female  sexual  partners  were  the  primary  safety  analysis 
population.  Data from “other studies” are considered as supportive only. 
Safety  analysis  has  been  provided  both  for  the  primary  safety  analysis  population  and  for  those 
patients included in the controlled trials. In addition, safety analysis for the long-term studies and the 
dose-ranging study is provided. 
The safety profile of PSD502 was established by assessing: 
• 
• 
• 
the incidence of adverse events in subjects and their female sexual partners 
the  effects  of  PSD502  on  vital  sign  assessments,  clinical 
laboratory  results,  and 
electrocardiogram (ECG) results for subjects enrolled in the ten studies 
haemoglobin  (Hb)  adduct  levels  in  a  subset  of  subjects  in  study  PSD502-PE-002  to  evaluate 
potential toxicity of lidocaine/prilocaine metabolites. 
Patient exposure 
Overall patient exposure 
In the pivotal studies, nearly 332 men were exposed to 30mg PSD502 for 3 months in the double blind 
phase, with 182 being exposed for 12 months in the open-label phase. 
A  total  of  658  subjects  received  at  least  one  dose  of  PSD502  across  the  8  studies  providing  safety 
data in the integrated analysis. Of the 658 subjects who received PSD502: 
•  596 (90.6%) were in the PSD502 Glans-penis-treated Subjects population 
•  419 (63.7%) were in the Controlled PE Studies population 
•  497 (75.5%) were in the Uncontrolled Long Term PE Studies population 
•  35 (5.3%) were in the dose-ranging study 
•  12 (1.8%) were healthy male volunteers 
•  39 (5.9%) were healthy female volunteers 
•  17 (2.6%) were in the single dose non-PE studies. 
Most of the glans-penis treated subjects (91.7%) received at least 4 doses of the product and around 
50%  of  them  were  given  at  least  32  doses.  The  mean  duration  of  exposure  was  203  days 
(approximately 7 months). 
The total number of female sexual partners in the PSD502 Glans-penis-subjects population is 584. 
-  Extent of exposure 
In the PSD502 Glans-penis-treated Subjects population, 91.7% of subjects received at least 4 doses 
and 50.5% received at least 32 doses of PSD502 30 mg. The mean number of doses was 40 (median: 
33 doses) with a maximum of 197 doses administered. The proportion of subjects who participated in 
the  studies  for  at  least  2  months  was  81.4%  and  those  who  participated  for  at  least  5  months  was 
66.1%.  The  mean  length  of  time  PSD502  Glans-penis-treated  subjects  participated  in  the  studies 
was 203 days (approximately 7 months) with a median of 216 days.

In  the  Controlled  PE  Studies  population,  89.3%  of  subjects  received  more  than  4  doses  and  57.6% 
received  more  than  12  doses  of  PSD502  30  mg.  The  mean  number  of  doses  was  14.9  (median:  14 
doses) with a maximum of 31 doses administered. The proportion of subjects who participated in the 
studies  for  more  than  2  months  was  84.4%.  The  mean  length  of  time  subjects  participated  in  the 
studies was 70.7 days with a median of 78 days. 
Adverse events 
-  Overall analysis of Adverse Events/common adverse events 
•  PSD502 Glans-penis-treated Subjects population: 
A total of 138 (23.2%) subjects had at least one TEAE.  
The commonest TEAEs for the primary safety analysis population were hypoaesthesia (4.5%), erectile 
dysfunction (4.4%), nasopharyngitis (2.7%), headache (2.3%), influenza (1.3%), and genital burning 
sensation  (1.0%),  genital  erythema  (0.5%)  and  ejaculation  failure  (0.3%).  The  most  commonly 
reported  TEAEs  affected  55  subjects  (9.2%)  and  were  related  to  the  reproductive  system  and  breast 
disorders system organ class. 
Table 40:  
•  Controlled PE Studies population 
In  the  controlled  PE  studies  population  less  patients  (16.2%)  reported  at  least  one  TEAE.  The  TEAEs 
distribution was similar or slightly lower to the previously mentioned: erectile dysfunction (3.3% vs 0 
in placebo group), hypoaesthesia (2.6% vs 0), genital erythema (0.5% vs 0), ejaculation failure (0.5% 
vs 0) and genital burning  sensation (0.2% vs 0.4%). Slightly lower incidence  of TEAEs was observed 
for the long-term studies population.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 86/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Data for the dose ranging trial show a dose-related increase of adverse events, being all TEAEs more 
frequent with the dose of 53 mg. 
Given the mechanism of action of the components (lidocaine and prilocaine) of PSD502 and the topical 
route of administration, these local TEAEs reported are not unexpected. 
Additionally,  some  systemic  adverse  events  were  also  observed  in  the  PSD502  Glans-penis-treated 
Subjects population such as nasopharyngitis (2.7%), headache (2.3%) and influenza (1.3%). 
•  Female partners 
A total of 83 of the 584 (14.2%) female sexual partners in the PSD502 Glans-penis treated Subjects 
population had at least one TEAE during the studies. The most common (≥1.0%) partner TEAEs in the 
PSD502  Glans-penis-treated  Subjects  population  were  vulvovaginal  burning  sensation  (3.9%), 
headache (1.9%), influenza (1.2%), nasopharyngitis (1.2%), hypoaesthesia (1.0%), and vulvovaginal 
discomfort (1.0%). 
In the controlled studies, similar incidences were reported for patients treated with PSD502 included in 
the controlled trials. The most common sexual partner TEAE was vulvovaginal burning sensation (4.5% 
in the PSD502 group vs. 0.8% in placebo group). 
Table 41:  
- 
TEAEs by Relationship to Study Drug 
Fifty-seven subjects (9.6%) in the glans-penis-treated population had a TEAE that was considered to 
be  drug-related.  The  most  common  (≥1%)  were:  hypoaesthesia  (4.5%),  erectile  dysfunction  (4.4%) 
and genital burning sensation (1.0%).

Likely Drug-related TEAEs: PSD502 Glans-penis-treated Subjects, Controlled and Uncontrolled PE 
Studies 
In  general,  most  of  the  drug-related  events  occurred  immediately,  or  within  24  hours,  following 
treatment with PSD502. 
In the dose-ranging Study, higher incidences were again seen, mainly with the 53 mg dose for which 
17.6% of patients reported drug-related TEAEs in comparison to 11.4% with 30 mg PSD502 dose. 
Table 43:  Likely Drug-related TEAEs in Dose-Ranging Study PSD502-PE-005 
Most  of  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate.  Seven  subjects  (1.2%)  in  the  Glans-penis-treated  subject 
population had at least one severe TEAE.  Erectile dysfunction occurred in 3 patients (0.5%) and was 
considered  related  to  treatment.  Other  severe  TEAEs  related  to  study  drug  were  impaired  glucose 
tolerance,  hypercholesterolaemia,  hyperlipidaemia  and  hypertension.  One  case  of  hypoaesthesia  was 
reported in the dose-ranging trial with the 53 mg dose, a higher dose that the one recommended for 
this intended indication.  
The  following  AEs  were  considered  severe  but  unrelated  to  study  drug:  myocardial  infarction, 
toothache, tooth infection and back pain. 
•  Female partners 
Vulvovaginal  burning  sensation  was  the  commonest  likely  drug-related  TEAE  (8.6%)  this  is  not 
unexpected considering the topical administration of the drug.

Table 44:  
Overall,  the  safety  of  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  was  evaluated  based  on  596   male  patients  who 
applied  it  during  clinical  trials.    Safety  has  also  been  evaluated  in  584 female  partners  of  these 
subjects. 
Adverse  reactions  considered  related  to  study  drug  occurred  in  9.6%  of  male  subjects  and  6.0%  of 
female partners. Most cases were classed as mild or moderate.   
The most frequent adverse reactions reported with the use of this medicinal product in male patients 
were  local  effects  of  genital  hypoaesthesia  (4.5%)  and  erectile  dysfunction  (4.4%).    These  adverse 
reactions caused discontinuation of treatment in 0.2% and 0.5% of patients, respectively. 
The most frequent adverse reactions reported with the use of this medicinal product in female partners 
were  vulvovaginal  burning  sensation  (3.9%),  and  genital  hypoaesthesia  (1.0%).    Vulvovaginal 
discomfort or burning sensation caused discontinuation of treatment in 0.3% of subjects. 
The adverse events are incorporated in section 4.8 in the SmPC in a tabulated list of adverse reactions. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No subjects or sexual partners died while participating in the studies of the PSD502 clinical program. 
Other serious adverse events 
A  total  of  8  subjects  experienced  serious  adverse  events;  6  subjects  in  PSD502-PE-002,  1  subject  in 
PSD502-PE-004, and 1 subject in PSD502-PM-001. All of the serious adverse  events were considered 
by the investigators to be unrelated to treatment with study drug.

TEAEs  were  also  collected  for  female  sexual  partners.  The  most  common  were  vulvovaginal  burning 
sensation (3.9%), headache (1.9%), influenza (1.2%), nasopharyngitis (1.2%), hypoaesthesia (1.0%), 
and vulvovaginal discomfort (1.0%). Similar incidences were reported for patients treated with PSD502 
included in the controlled trials. 
Vulvovaginal  burning  sensation  was  the  commonest  likely  drug-related  TEAE  (8.6%)  what  is  not 
unexpected considering the topical administration of the drug. Six patients (1%) reported at least one 
severe TEAE.  
Only  3  female  sexual  partners  experienced  serious  adverse  events,  which  were  not  considered 
treatment-related (cardiac failure secondary to desmopressin, pneumotorax and ovarian cyst) what is 
reassuring. 
Laboratory findings 
No meaningful changes in any laboratory parameter were observed. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Haematology and chemistry laboratory tests were performed at baseline and at the end of each study. 
Only single cases of abnormal determinations of laboratory results (bicarbonate and hematocrit levels) 
were reported for all the studies (controlled, uncontrolled, healthy female/male volunteer studies). 
Vital Signs and ECG findings 
In the primary safety analysis population two subjects reported elevations of blood pressure during the 
study and one patient had a shift to abnormal ECG results and the end of study. In the controlled study 
population the shift from normal to abnormal ECG  was comparable in the group treated with PSD502 
(3.3%) and placebo (4.1%). 
Safety in special populations 
No specific in special populations were conducted. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No in vivo drug interaction studies have been carried out with PSD502. However, although PSD502 is a 
novel spray, the components lidocaine and prilocaine, have been used extensively in both topical and 
systemic formulations. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 90/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on reports in the literature from experience with lidocaine and prilocaine: 
- 
Lidocaine may interact with anti-arrhythmic compounds; generally, toxic effects of anti-arrhythmic 
drugs are additive and potentially synergistic so should be avoided. 
- 
Prilocaine given concomitantly with drugs such as sulfonamides or anti-malarial drugs may result in 
a predisposition to methaemoglobinaemia. 
Four  studies  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  PSD502  on  condoms,  the  cervical  cap,  the 
contraceptive diaphragm,  and the female condom.  Briefly, it was  found that  the integrity of the male 
condom,  the  cervical  cap,  and  diaphragm  (all  latex  rubber-based)  were  not  affected  by  exposure  to 
PSD502. However, the female condom (polyurethane based) showed an effect on tensile strength and 
elongation  of  break  testing  following  exposure  to  PSD502,  and  an  increased  incidence  of  punctured 
devices. Therefore, the latex-based male condom, the cervical cap, and the diaphragm can be used as 
effective contraceptives in the presence of PSD502, but not polyurethane-based barrier contraceptives. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
A total of 5 subjects discontinued from a study early due to TEAEs; 2 subjects from PSD502-PE-002, 2 
subjects from PSD502-PE-004, and 1 subject from PSD502-UP-001. Three of the subjects discontinued 
early because of erectile dysfunction. These 3 events were considered related to the study drug. One of 
these patients also had hypoaesthesia. 
Table 46: List of Subjects Who Had a TEAE Leading to Early Discontinuation 
•  Female sexual partners leading to early discontinuation 
Two  subjects  discontinued  early  because  of  TEAEs  experienced  by  their  sexual  partners;  one  partner 
from  PSD502-PE-002  and  one  from  PSD502-PE-004.  Partner  events  leading  to  early  discontinuation 
were  both  genital  complaints  (vulvovaginal  discomfort  and  vulvovaginal  burning  sensation)  and  were 
considered by the investigators to be related to treatment with study drug.

Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing experience exists to date as PSD502 spray is not on the market. However, lidocaine 
and  prilocaine  are  marketed  worldwide  in  various  topical  formulations,  including  creams,  gels  and 
solutions,  which  are  available  over-the-counter  or  by  prescription  only  depending  on  their 
concentration and use. A eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine is marketed as EMLA cream and 
EMLA anaesthetic disc (a patch formulation). 
As PSD502 is a mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine for topical use, one would expect a toxicity profile 
similar to that of EMLA cream (a mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine, although in different proportions 
to PSD502). EMLA cream contains 2.5% lidocaine w/w (25 mg/g) and 2.5% prilocaine (25 mg/g), and 
it is approved as a local anaesthetic for topical use to produce surface anaesthesia of the skin, and for 
topical use on the genital mucosa to facilitate the removal of warts in adults. 
The most commonly reported events (>1%) with the use of EMLA cream on genital mucosa have been 
transient  local  reactions  such  as  erythema,  oedema,  paleness,  and  an  initial,  usually  mild,  burning 
sensation, itch, or warmth at the application site. Local paraesthesia such as tingling at the application 
site  has  been  reported  as  an  uncommon  event  (>0.1%  and  <1%),  and  allergic  reactions  have  been 
reported as rare events (<0.1%). Allergic reactions to the amide group of local anaesthetics are rare. 
Occasional reports of contact sensitivity to lidocaine have been reported, and cross reactivity between 
lidocaine and prilocaine has also been described. 
Metabolites  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  include  anilines  such  as  2,6-xylidine  and  o-toluidine, 
respectively,  which  are 
toxic  at  high 
levels.  Symptoms  of  aniline  poisoning 
include 
methaemoglobinaemia,  headache,  paraesthesia,  hyperalgesia,  poly  neuritis,  cardiac  arrhythmias, 
dizziness, hypotension, convulsion, muscle weakness, and/or digestive derangement. 
A  contraindication  of  the  use  of  Lidocaine  has  been  introduced  in  the  PI  in  individuals  with 
hypovolaemia,  heart  block  or  other  conduction  disturbances,  and  hepatic  impairment  (may  lead  to 
increased  plasma 
levels  and  known  hypersensitivity  to  amide-type 
local  anaesthetics).  A 
contraindication  of  the  use  of  Prilocaine  is  also  added  in  PI  in  individuals  with  anaemia  or 
methaemoglobinaemia  (congenital  or  idiopathic)  and  known  hypersensitivity  to  amide-type  local 
anaesthetics.  A  warning  has  been  added  in  the  SmpC  for  individuals  with  glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase deficiency who are more susceptible to drug-induced methaemoglobinaemia. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary safety analysis population was the glans-penis treated subjects (n=658) that included all 
patients  enrolled  in  PE  studies  plus  the  studies  in  healthy  volunteers.  All  those  patients  received  at 
least one dose of PSD502. Most of them (91.7%) received at least 4 doses of the product and around 
50%  of  them  were  given  32  doses.  The  mean  duration  of  exposure  was  203  days  (approximately  7 
months).  The  size  of  the  safety  database  and  the  duration  of  exposure  are  considered  sufficient, 
although  not  very  extensive  enough  for  the  evaluation  of  the  safety  profile  of  the  medicinal  product. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 92/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety  analysis  has  been  also  provided  for  the  controlled  trial  populations,  the  long-term  studies  and 
the dose-ranging study.  
About a quarter of patients (n=138, 23.2%) of the primary safety analysis population reported at least 
one  TEAE.  The  commonest  TEAEs  were  hypoaesthesia  (4.5%),  erectile  dysfunction  (4.4%), 
nasopharyngitis  (2.7%),  headache  (2.3%),  influenza  (1.3%),  and  genital  burning  sensation  (1.0%). 
Incidences were a bit lower in the controlled trials and the long-term studies. The adverse events are 
incorporated in section 4.8 in the SmPC. 
In 55 subjects (9.2%) of the primary safety analysis population TEAEs were related to the reproductive 
system and breast disorders system organ class, what is expected given the mechanism of action and 
the  topical  administration  of  PSD502.  The  most  frequent  TEAEs  were  hypoaesthesia  (4.5%),  erectile 
dysfunction (4.4%), genital burning sensation (1.0%), genital erythema (0.5%) and ejaculation failure 
(0.3%). In the controlled PE studies population less patients (16.2%) reported at least one TEAE but a 
similar  incidence  was  observed.  Slightly  lower  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  observed  for  in  the  long-term 
studies. Data for the dose ranging trial show a dose-related increase of adverse events, being all TEAEs 
more frequent with the dose of 53 mg. 
Fifty-seven subjects (9.6%) in the primary safety analysis population had a TEAE that was considered 
to  be  drug-related  and  they  were  in  relation  to  the  local  administration  of  the  product  and  its 
mechanism of action: hypoaesthesia (4.5%), erectile dysfunction (4.4%) and genital burning sensation 
(1.0%). Most of the drug-related events occurred immediately, or within 24 hours, following treatment 
with  PSD502.  A  clear  dose-related  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  observed  in  the  dose-ranging  study  with 
higher incidences seen mainly with the 53 mg dose for which 17.6% of patients reported drug-related 
TEAEs in comparison to 11.4% with 30 mg PSD502 dose.  
Most of TEAEs were mild or moderate. Seven subjects (1.2%) had at least one severe TEAE.  Erectile 
dysfunction  occurred  in  3  patients  (0.5%)  and  was  considered  related  to  treatment.  Other  severe 
TEAEs related to study drug were impaired glucose tolerance, hypercholesterolaemia, hyperlipidaemia 
and  hypertension.  One  case  of  hypoaesthesia  was  reported  in  the  dose-ranging  trial  with  the  53  mg 
dose,  a  higher  dose  that  the  one  recommended  for  this  intended  indication.  The  following  AEs  were 
considered  severe  but  unrelated  to  study  drug:  myocardial  infarction,  toothache,  tooth  infection  and 
back pain. 
There were no relevant differences regarding the nature of the TEAEs observed in healthy volunteers.  
TEAEs  were  also  collected  for  female  sexual  partners.  The  commonest  were  vulvovaginal  burning 
sensation (3.9%), headache (1.9%), influenza (1.2%), nasopharyngitis (1.2%), hypoaesthesia (1.0%), 
and vulvovaginal discomfort (1.0%). Similar incidences were reported for patients treated with PSD502 
included in the controlled trials. Vulvovaginal burning sensation was the commonest likely drug-related 
TEAE  (8.6%)  what  is  not  unexpected  considering  the  topical  administration  of  the  drug.  Six  patients 
(1%)  reported  at  least  one  severe  TEAE.  Only  3  sexual  partners  experienced  serious  adverse  events 
and  these  were  not  considered  treatment-related  (cardiac  failure  secondary  to  desmopressin, 
pneumothorax  and  ovarian  cyst)  what  is  reassuring.  There  is  no  data  if  inadvertent  dosing  to  other 
sites  (or  used  in  other  mucoses)  occur  although  no  differences  regarding  adverse  events  in  genital 
mucosa are to be expected. This is adequately addressed in the RMP. 
Only single cases of abnormal determinations of laboratory results (bicarbonate and hematocrit levels) 
were reported for all the studies what is considered reassuring.

EMA/685541/2013

In the primary safety analysis population two subjects reported elevations of blood pressure during the 
study and one patient had a shift to abnormal ECG results at the end of study. In the controlled study 
population the shift from normal to abnormal ECG  was comparable in the group treated with PSD502 
(3.3%) and placebo (4.1%) what is reassuring.  
Overall,  90%  of  patients  included  in  the  controlled  trials  were  younger  than  55  years,  and  a  limited 
number of patients were older than 65 years. The younger age group representation is relevant as PE 
is more common. However, it cannot be ruled out that the limited participation of patients older than 
65  years  of  age  have  an  impact  on  the  safety  profile  of  PSD502  as  ED  is  also  more  frequent  in  the 
older  population  and  it  is  a  known  AE  for  this  combination  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine.  This  issue  is 
properly addressed in the RMP as missing information. 
ED  and  hypoaesthesia  occurred  more  frequently in  uncircumcised  subjects.  Ejaculation  failure  (0.7%) 
and  genital  erythema  (0.7%)  were  only  observed  in  uncircumcised  subjects  too.  The  Applicant's 
justification of these differences with respect to circumcised patients is supported. 
Five subjects discontinued early due to TEAEs; 3 male subjects due to ED and 2 female sexual partners 
due to genital complaints. 
Although the lidocaine/prilocine spray is not available on the market anywhere, there is an authorised 
product for topical use containing a mixture of lidocaine and proilocaine (EMLA®) in different indication 
and  concentrations.  Similar  local  reactions  (erytema,  burning  sensation,  paresthesia)  have  been 
reported post-marketing, all of them linked to the mechanism of action of both active substances and 
the  topical  use.  However,  whereas  EMLA  is  going  to  be  used  in  specific  occasions,  i.e.  minor 
interventions or surgical interventions, Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora is expected to be used for chronic 
and  intermittent  use  and  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  PE.  As  it  is  known  that  the  use  of  prilocaine 
may result in a predisposition to methaemoglobinaemia and there is carcinogenicity potential from o-
toluidine  metabolite 
in  humans,  a  prolonged  exposure  and  the  possible  accumulation  of 
lidocaine/prilocaine  following  repeated  doses  could  lead  to  a  higher  incidence  of  these  potentially 
negative events. This concern has been adequately justified by the Applicant. Data provided revealed 
that  the  potential  occurrence  of  methaemoglobinaemia  from  prilocaine  and  the  carcinogenicity  risk 
from o-toluidine following PSD502 administration seem to be negligible. No cases were reported during 
clinical  studies  and  no  considerable  accumulation  of  prilocaine  or  o  -toluidine  seems  to  be  expected 
following  repeated  administrations  of  PSD502.  However,  since  these  risks  cannot  be  ruled  out  in  the 
intended  population,  it  has  been  reflected  in  the  RMP  and  a  warning  and  additional  information  is 
included in the PI.  
Of  note,  a  concern  related  to  the  potential  risks  for  the  foetus  in  pregnant  women  was  also  raised. 
After the assessment of further information provided by the Applicant, this risk seems to be negligible. 
However, there are limited data in pregnant women and therefore this concern is considered at present 
unknown. This has been reflected the RMP as well as the PI.  
Known  interactions  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  have  already  been  included  in  the  proposed  SmPC  as 
well as warnings related to these interactions.  
The Applicant was requested to include some additional amendments in the proposed SmPC: 
- 
Information  related  to  the  compatibility  of  PSD502  and  latex  rubber-based  contraceptives  or 
polyurethane  based  contraceptives  under  section  4.4.  It  is  considered  that  this  information  is 
relevant for a safe use of PSD502 cutaneous spray.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/685541/2013  
Page 94/126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Information  on  pregnancy  taking  into  account  that  there  is  limited  information  that  offers  a 
reassuring safety profile during pregnancy and lactation in humans. 
The above requirements have been adequately addressed in the corresponding sections of the SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No  relevant  concerns  seem  to  have  been  identified  in  the  clinical  development  of  PSD502  for 
premature ejaculation. Most of adverse events reported were mild or moderate in intensity and mainly 
localized  reactions  related  to  the  local  administration  and  mechanism  of  action  of  the  product 
(hypoaesthesia, erectile dysfunction (ED), genital burning sensation, genital erythema and ejaculation 
failure).  Given  the  mechanism  of  action  of  lidocaine  and  prilocaine  and  the  topical  route  of 
administration, these local TEAEs reported are not unexpected. 
Few cases were considered severe (3 cases of ED, impaired glucose tolerance, hypercholesterolaemia, 
hyperlipidaemia  and  hypertension)  all  of  them  considered  related  to  the  studied  medicinal  product. 
Some systemic adverse events were also observed such as nasopharyngitis, headache and influenza. 
Overall,  the  female  sexual  partners  also  had  TEAEs,  some  localised  and  related  to  the  local 
administration  of  the  product  (vulvovaginal  burning  sensation,  vulvovaginal  discomfort  and 
hypoaesthesia)  and  other  systemic  (headache,  influenza,  nasopharyngitis).  There  is  no  data  in  male 
sexual partners although no differences regarding adverse events in genital mucosa are to be expected.  
This is properly addressed in the RMP as important potential risk. 
Overall,  PSD502  has  an  apparently  benign  and  manageable  safety  profile.  Furthermore,  it  is  known 
that  the  use  of  prilocaine  may  result  in  a  predisposition  to  methaemoglobinaemia  and  there  is 
carcinogenicity potential from o-toluidine metabolite in humans, a prolonged exposure could lead to a 
higher incidence of these potentially negative events. The potential occurrence of these risks seem to 
be  negligible  although  cannot  be  ruled  out.  A  specific  wording  is  included  to  reflect  these  risks  in 
product  information  and  RMP.  Similarly,  a  concern  related  to  the  potential  risks  for  the  foetus  in 
pregnant  women  was  also  raised.  Given  the  limited  data  available,  some  recommendations  are 
provided in the product information.  
In addition, the fact that  very few patients older than 65 years (less than 10%) were included in the 
controlled  trials  raises  a  concern  regarding  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  this  product  in  this  specific 
population. This is reflected in the RMP as missing information. 
Finally,  there are some additional risks that have been reflected in the updated PI such as the possible 
effect on male fertility (sperm mobility), the inadvertent dosing to other sites and the potential for off-
label use that are adequately reflected in the RMP.

2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 1.0 the PRAC considers by consensus 
that  the  risk  management  system  for  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  (Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora)  in  the  of 
primary premature ejaculation in adult men could be acceptable provided an updated risk management 
plan and satisfactory responses to the List of Questions are submitted.    
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The  PRAC,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  proposed  post-
authorisation  PhV  development  plan  is  not  sufficient  to  identify  and  characterise  the  risks  of  the 
product and the MAA should perform as an additional PV measure detailed in the RMP an updated Drug 
utilisation  study  aimed  to  characterise  real  clinical  practice  and  the  patients  who  are  prescribed  the 
product. This study should take into account the following: 
- The sample should be representative of the prescription patterns of the product in real life conditions. 
The proposed sample size should be stated. 
-  The  potential  bias  introduced  by  a  selection  of  investigators  should  be  specifically  addressed  and 
prevented in the study design. 
- A design including a full retrospective collection of data using existing data sources would be a valid 
approach.  
- The detailed description of the information that will be collected will depend on the data source and 
amended as appropriate. 
Further minor amendments to the PhV plan are detailed in section 4.  
The  PRAC  also  considered  that  routine  PhV  is  sufficient  to  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  the  risk 
minimisation measures.

•     Precautions for use included in section 
4.4: 
Care should be taken not to allow 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora to come in contact 
with the eye, as it may cause eye irritation.  Also 
the loss of protective reflexes can permit corneal 
irritation and potential abrasion.  Absorption of 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora in conjunctival 
tissues has not been determined. If contact with 
the eye occurs, immediately rinse the eye with 
water or sodium chloride solution and protect it 
until sensation returns. 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora sprayed onto 
mucous membranes of the patient or their 
partner, such as the mouth, nose and throat, or 
transferred onto female genitalia or anal lining, 
could be absorbed and temporary local 
numbness/anaesthesia is likely to result.  This 
hypoaesthesia may mask normal pain sensations 
and, therefore, increase the dangers of localised 
injury. 
A higher rate of erectile dysfunction and male 
genital hypoaesthesia may be experienced when 
using Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora with male 
condoms.

(Proposed) text in Package Leaflet: 
•     Warnings and precautions included in 
section 2: 
When you use this medicine, particularly during 
priming of the container, aim the container away 
from the face to avoid accidental contact with 
ears, eyes, nose and mouth. 
If some medicine accidentally gets into your eyes 
or your partner’s eyes, rinse them immediately 
with cold water or saline solution and cover them 
gently until any effects, such as numbness, wear 
off. Be aware that normal protective mechanisms, 
such as blinking, or sensation of a foreign body in 
the eye, may not occur until the numbness has 
worn off. 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora may also come into 
contact with other mucous membranes such as 
your, or your partner’s, mouth, nose and throat, 
causing them to feel slightly numb for a short 
while.  As this will reduce the ability to feel pain in 
these areas, extra care should be taken not to 
injure them until the numbness has worn off. 
During sexual intercourse, a small amount of this 
medicine may be transferred e.g. to the vagina or 
the anus.  Therefore, both partners may feel 
slight numbness for a short while and should take 
care not to injure themselves, particularly during 
sexual activity.

•     The following information is included in 
section 4.6: 
Women of childbearing potential / 
contraception in male and females 
Patients hoping to achieve conception should 
either avoid using Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora, 
or, if it is essential to achieve penetration, should 
wash the glans penis as thoroughly as possible 
prior to intercourse. 
Fertility 
There are no adequate data from the use of 
lidocaine and prilocaine on fertility in humans. A 
study in rats showed that Lidocaine/Prilocaine 
Plethora caused a reduction in sperm motility. 
This medicinal product may reduce the possibility 
of pregnancy, but should not be used as a 
contraceptive. 
•     The following information is included in 
section 5.3: 
Effect on fertility 
In an in vitro study of rats Lidocaine/Prilocaine 
Plethora has shown a reduction in sperm motility 
when 22.5 mg lidocaine and 7.5 mg prilocaine 
(i.e. the amount of 1 human dose) was in direct 
contact with rat sperm. However this study did 
not reproduce the circumstances of clinical use, as 
the concentration of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora 
in direct contact with the sperm would be many 
fold lower.  The potential for reduction of sperm 
motility following the clinical use of 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine the medicinal product cannot 
be excluded; therefore it is not possible to state 
whether Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora would 
prevent pregnancy.

interactions), is provided for prescriber 
and user to minimise use in patients and 
their sexual partners who may be at risk. 
Symptoms of potential systemic toxicities

(Proposed) text in SmPC: 
Warnings included in following sections: 
•     section 
4.4: Anaemia related 
conditions 
Patients or their partner with glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase deficiency or congenital or 
idiopathic methaemoglobinaemia are more 
susceptible to medicinal product-induced 
methaemoglobinaemia (see section 4.5). 
Although the systemic availability of prilocaine by 
cutaneous absorption of Lidocaine/Prilocaine 
Plethora is low, caution should be exercised in 
patients with anaemia, congenital or acquired 
methaemoglobinaemia or patients on concomitant 
therapy known to produce such conditions. 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment 
Patients with severe hepatic disease, because of 
their inability to metabolise local anaesthetics 
normally, are at greater risk of developing toxic 
plasma concent ations of lidocaine and p ilocaine

•     section 4.5: 
Methaemoglobinaemia may be accentuated in 
patients already taking medicinal products known 
to induce the condition, e.g. sulphonamides, 
acetanilid, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, 
dapsone, metoclopramide, naphthalene, nitrates 
and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, 
nitroprusside, pamaquine, para-aminosalicylic 
acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine and 
quinine (see section 4.4). 
The risk of additional systemic toxicity should be 
considered when large doses of 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora are applied to 
patients already using other local anaesthetics or 
structurally related medicinal products e.g. class I 
anti-arrhythmics such as mexiletine. 
Specific interaction studies with 
lidocaine/prilocaine and anti-arrhythmic medicinal 
products class III (e.g. amiodarone) have not 
been performed, but caution is advised (see also 
section 4.4). 
Medicinal products that reduce the clearance of 
lidocaine (e.g. cimetidine or betablockers) may 
cause potentially toxic plasma concentrations 
when lidocaine is given intravenously in repeated 
high doses over a long time period (30 hours). 
•     Symptoms of systemic toxicities and 
treatments are included in section 4.9: 
Prilocaine in high doses may cause an increase in 
the methaemoglobin level particularly in 
conjunction with methaemoglobin-inducing agents 
(e.g. sulphonamides).  Clinically significant 
methaemoglobinaemia should be treated with a 
slow intravenous injection of methylthioninium 
chloride. 
Should other symptoms of systemic toxicity occur, 
the signs are anticipated to be similar in nature to 
those following the administration of local 
anaesthetics by other routes.  Local anaesthetic 
toxicity is manifested by symptoms of nervous 
system excitation and, in severe cases, central 
nervous and cardiovascular depression. 
Severe neurological symptoms (convulsions, CNS 
depression) must be treated symptomatically by 
respiratory support and the administration of 
anticonvulsive medicinal products.

Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora 
-        if you, or your sexual partner, have been 
diagnosed with a genetic disease or other 
condition affecting your red blood cells 
(glucose-6-phosphate deficiency, anaemia 
or methaemoglobinaemia) 
-           if you have a history of medicine

under heading Other medicines and 
Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora 
•     Symptoms of systemic toxicity are provided in 
section 3: 
If you use more Lidocaine/Prilocaine than 
you should 
Symptoms of using too much Lidocaine/Prilocaine 
Plethora are listed below.  Contact your doctor or 
pharmacist if you experience any of these. They 
are very unlikely to happen if it is used as 
instructed: 
•     Feeling light-headed or dizzy 
•     Tingling of the skin around the mouth and 
numbness of the tongue 
•     Abnormal taste 
•     Blurred vision 
•     Ringing in the ears 
•  There is also a risk of a disorder reducing 
the amount of oxygen in the blood 
(methaemoglobinaemia). This is more likely 
when certain medicines have been taken at 
the same time. If this happens, the skin 
becomes bluish-grey due to a lack of 
oxygen. 
In serious cases of overdose, symptoms may 
include fits, low blood pressure, slowed 
breathing, stopped breathing and altered heart 
beat. These effects may be life-threatening.

Routine risk minimisation measures 
(Proposed) text in SmPC 
The following information is provided to the 
prescriber: 
•     section 
4.6: Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the 
use of lidocaine and prilocaine in pregnant 
women.  Animal studies do not indicate 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to 
avoid the use of Lidocaine/Prilocaine Plethora 
during pregnancy unless effective male barrier 
contraceptive measures are taken in order to 
avoid potential foetal exposure.. 
•     Section 
5.3: Reproductive 
toxicity 
Lidocaine 
No teratogenic effects were observed in studies of 
embryonic/foetal development in rats and rabbits 
receiving doses during organogenesis. 
Embryotoxicity was observed in rabbits at doses 
toxic to the mother. The postnatal survival time of 
the offspring of rats treated during pregnancy and 
lactation with a dose toxic to the mother was 
shown to be reduced. 
Prilocaine 
In a study of pregnant rats receiving a 
combination of lidocaine and prilocaine during 
organogenesis, no effects on embryonic/foetal 
development were observed. There are however 
no systemic exposure data available for 
comparison with clinical exposure.

The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
In addition, the CHMP considered that the applicant should take the following minor points into 
consideration when an update of the Risk management Plan is submitted: 
1. The DUS study should not be classified as category 2 and should be categorised as category 3 
study. In the milestones a planned date for the submission of the final report should be also provided 
2. Table III.5.1 should be a complete overview of all on-going and planed studies in categories 1-3. 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities should not be included. Therefore, in this case, the only additional 
PhV activity planned by the MAH that should be included in this table is the Drug Utilization Study. 
2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Premature Ejaculation is a sexual dysfunction in men  with a significant negative psychological impact 
leading  to  distress  and  reduced  sexual  satisfaction  in  both  the  patient  and  their  partners.  Limited 
therapeutic alternatives are currently available in the EU for this condition. PSD502 is a mixture of two 
local anaesthetics – lidocaine and prilocaine for the topical treatment of PE. 
Two pivotal trials have been provided to support the efficacy and safety of the product. In both trials 
efficacy  was  primarily  based  on  the  effect  on  as  intravaginal  ejaculatory  latency  time  (IELT)  and  the 
improvement  of  the  control  over  ejaculation  during  sexual  intercourse,  sexual  satisfaction  and  the 
reduction of the distress related to ejaculation (IPE domains) addressing the multidimensional profile of 
the  condition.  Results  showed  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  effect  of  PSD502  in 
objective  measures  as  intravaginal  latency  time  and  also  perceived  as  a  benefit  by  the  subjects  and 
their partners.  
Long-term efficacy data of PSD502 are available coming from the open-label phases of the two pivotal 
trials and results do not suggest loss of efficacy. 
The ease and convenience of application just 5 minutes prior to intercourse would result in increased 
spontaneity and therefore greater sexual satisfaction. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The pivotal studies have been carried out in heterosexual men who were in a monogamous relationship 
for  at  least  3  months  prior  to  study  entry.  The  effect  of  PSD502  in  homosexual  men  (with  single/ 
multiple partners), and heterosexual men with multiple partners has not been studied. As in the latter 
case, a psychological element may also be involved, the effect of PSD502 alone may not be sufficient. 
However based on the results of the studies presented here, there is no reason to believe that PSD502 
may not show similar effects in these groups too. 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/685541/2013 
Page 123/126 
 
 
 
 
 
The  risk  derived  from  an  increased  absorption  through  damaged  mucosa  or  when  a  condom  is  used 
could be of concern. Condoms are widely used as contraceptive measure and/or with casual partners 
and the lack of information on the effect of condoms on the absorption of PSD502 is of concern. In this 
respect, the clarifications submitted by the Applicant do not suggest a negative effect on the efficacy or 
safety profile of the product. However, the limitations of the data provided prevent from reaching valid 
conclusions  on  this  issue.  Given  that  a  higher  rate  of  local  numbness  and  loss  of  erection  could  be 
reasonably  expected  when  condoms  are  concomitantly  used,  patients  are  warned  in  the  Product 
Information. 
Although there are some data on the use of PSD502 at 12 months that do not suggest loss of efficacy 
the  evidence  regarding  the  maintenance  of  the  effect  of  PSD502  is  considered  limited.  Additionally, 
only 30 mg dose has been sufficiently studied. No posology recommendation based on clinical data can 
be  offered  to  subjects  requiring  dose  adjustment  in  case  of  reporting  insufficient  effect  or  if  adverse 
(tolerability) events occur.  
Demographic  characteristics  do  not  appear  to  influence  on  the  response  except  for  the  age,  younger 
subjects  reporting  greater  benefit  than  older patients.  However,  the  limited  number  of  subjects  older 
than  65  years  and  even  55  years  included  in  clinical  trials  does  not  allow  to  determine  if  such 
differences in fact exist. This limitation is reflected in the SmPC. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  of  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  for  both  male  glans-penis-treated  subjects  and 
female  partners  appears  to  be  benign  and  manageable  since  adverse  events  observed  during  the 
clinical trials seem to be expected considering the mechanism of action of both anaesthetics (lidocaine 
and prilocaine) and the topical administration of this cutaneous solution. 
Regarding the safety data presented, the majority of adverse events were local adverse events in the 
glans  penis:  hypoaesthesia  (4.5%),  erectile  dysfunction  (4.4%),  genital  burning  sensation  (1.0%), 
genital  erythema  (0.5%)  and  ejaculation  failure  (0.3%).  Hypoaesthesia,  erectile  dysfunction  and 
genital  burning  sensation  were  considered  to  be  drug-related.  In  addition,  some  systemic  adverse 
events such as nasopharyngitis (2.7%), headache (2.3%) and influenza (1.3%) were also observed. 
With regards to TEAEs reported for female sexual partners, the commonest were vulvovaginal burning 
sensation  (3.9%),  headache  (1.9%),  influenza  (1.2%),  nasopharyngitis  (1.2%),  hypoaesthesia 
(1.0%), and vulvovaginal discomfort (1.0%). Vulvovaginal burning sensation was the commonest likely 
drug-related TEAE.  
With  respect  to  the  SmPC,  there  are  potential  risks  caused  by  both  anaesthetics  that  are  adequately 
addressed  in  the  SmPC  (sections  4.4  and  4.5).  In  addition,  an  appropriate  warning  related  to  the 
compatibility  of  PSD502  and  latex  rubber-based  contraceptives  or  polyurethane  based  contraceptives 
has  been  also  included  in  section  4.4  and  section  2  of  the  package  leaflet.  Moreover,  appropriate 
information  regarding  fertility,  pregnancy  and  breast-feeding  has  been  implemented  by  the  Applicant 
in section 4.6 of the SmPC and section 2 of the package leaflet.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Some  uncertainties  were  detected  following  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  safety  assessment.  Despite 
the  reported  adverse  events  that  were  considered  expected  taking  into  account  the  mechanism  of 
action  of  both  anaesthetics  and  the  topical  administration  of  this  cutaneous  solution,  some  issues 
CHMP assessment report 
EMA/685541/2013 
Page 124/126 
 
 
 
 
 
related  to  the  prolonged  use  of  PSD502  were  requested  to  be  further  clarified.  Overall,  the  potential 
occurrence  of  methaemoglobinaemia  from  prilocaine  and  carcinogenicity  risk  from  o-toluidine  is 
extremely  unlikely  based  upon  the  clinical  and  non-clinical  information  provided  by  the  Applicant. 
Although no cases were reported during clinical trials, these risks cannot be ruled out and is reflected 
in the RMP. A specific wording is included in product information. 
Similarly,  a  concern  related  to  the  potential  risks  for  the  foetus  in  pregnant  women  was  also  raised. 
Given the limited data available, some recommendations are provided in the product information. 
Finally,  concerns  related  to  the  possible  effect  on  male  fertility,  the  inadvertent  dosing  to  other  sites 
(or  used  in  other  mucosas)  and  the  potential  for  off-label  use  are  already  included  in  the  RMP. 
Information  concerning  the  limited  number  of  patients  older  than  65  years  is  included  in  the  RMP  as 
missing information. This limitation is adequately reflected in the Product Information. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Lidocaine-prilocaine well-established drug combination, with moderate side effects, with a therapeutic 
innovative  local  action  through  spray  application  that  produces  “on  demand”  patient  and  partner 
clinical benefits as defined by objective measures (IELT) and domains from patient reported outcomes 
in the treatment of PE, which is the commonest sexual complaint in men. The innovative local route of 
administration  compared  to  currently  authorised  medicinal  product  for  the  treatment  of  PE  mean 
minimises the systemic drug exposure and possibility of systemic side effects. 
Benefit-risk balance 
A statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect has been shown by PSD502 in the treatment of 
lifelong PE. It has been observed in objective measures as intravaginal latency time and also perceived 
as  a  benefit  by  the  subjects  and  their  partners.  Also,  indirect  comparison  to  dapoxetine  provides 
supportive results. The lack of sufficient information regarding the efficacy on elderly subjects and the 
potential risk associated to the concomitant use of condoms is reflected in the Product Information.  
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  for  both  male  glans-penis-treated  subjects 
and  female  partners  appears  to  be  benign  and  manageable.  The  local identified  risks  reported  in  this 
dossier  were  not  unexpected.  Concerns  initially  raised  regarding  metahaemoglobinemia  and 
carcinogenicity  potential  have  been solved  and  are adequately  addressed in  the  RMP.  Concerning  the 
potential risks for the foetus in pregnant women, more detailed recommendations have been provided 
in  the  product  information.  The  possible  effect  on  male  fertility,  the  inadvertent  dosing  to  other  sites 
(or used in other mucoses) and the potential for off-label use are included in the RMP. Moreover, the 
limited number of patients older than 65 years is reflected in the RMP as missing information. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The advantages of this topical formulation in the treatment of PE, including the positive psychological 
outcomes in the patient and their partners are considered to be much higher than the disadvantages of 
PSD502 in terms of local adverse effects which are generally manageable. The two active substances in 
PSD502,  Lidocaine/Prilocaine,  are  well  known.  The  availability  of  a  discrete  spray  formulation  is 
considered as of added value.

The  overall  B/R  of  Lidocaine/Prilocaine  Plethora  150  mg/ml  +  50  mg/ml  cutaneous  spray,  solution  is 
positive and the application is approvable as the Applicant submitted satisfactory responses to the list 
of outstanding issues. 
4.  Recommendations

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Diabetes  mellitus  is  an  increasingly  prevalent  disease.  Recent  estimates  suggest  that  382  million  people 
worldwide currently have diabetes. This number is expected to increase to 592 million in the next 25 years. 
The most common form of diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus, is characterised by insulin resistance, impaired 
insulin  secretion,  and  increased  hepatic  glucose  production.  In  addition,  it  is  associated  with  microvascular 
complications and increased cardiovascular risk.  
Treatment  of  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  usually  involves  lifestyle  interventions  such  as  diet  and  exercise,  as 
well  as  the  administration  of  antidiabetic  drugs.  Although  initially  effective,  currently  available  oral 
antidiabetic agents often fail to maintain long-term glycaemic control or are associated with side effects (e.g. 
weight  gain  and  hypoglycaemia)  that  may  limit  their  use.  Hence,  there  is  an  ongoing  need  for  new 
therapeutic options to provide sustained improvements in glycaemic control and to reduce cardiovascular risk 
factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, i.e. overweight and hypertension.  
About the product 
Based on results of clinical Phase III studies, 2 doses of empagliflozin (25 mg and 10 mg; empa 25 and empa 
10) and one dose of linagliptin (5 mg; lina 5) are approved treatments for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
The combinationof empagliflozin and linagliptin may result in improved glycaemic control, since the individual 
drugs have distinct mode of actions.  
Empagliflozin is a potent and selective SGLT-2 inhibitor, which is expressed in the renal proximal tubules and 
accounts  for  approximately  90%  of  renal  glucose  reabsorption.  Inhibition  of  SGLT-2  decreases  the  renal 
reabsorption  of  glucose,  thereby  promoting  glucose  excretion  in  the  urine  with  a  consequent  reduction  in 
blood  glucose  levels.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  empagliflozin  is  independent  of  β-cell  function  and  insulin 
pathways,  which provides a therapeutic advantage compared with other drugs and has  not been associated 
with an increased risk for hypoglycaemia when administered as monotherapy or other antidiabetic therapies 
(other  than  sulphonylurea±insulin).  Furthermore,  SGLT-2  inhibition  is  associated  with  weight  loss  and  a 
reduction in blood pressure.  
Linagliptin  is  a  selective,  orally  administered,  xanthine-based  DPP-4  inhibitor.  Like  other  DPP-4  inhibitors, 
linagliptin lowers blood glucose by extending the half-life of active glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is 
secreted  in  response  to  a  meal.  Glucagon-like  peptide  -1  lowers  blood  glucose  by  augmenting  the  glucose-
stimulated  insulin  release  and  limiting  glucagon  secretion  as  well  as  slowing  gastric  emptying  and  inducing 
satiety.  DPP-4  inhibitors  have  a  relatively  low  risk  of  hypoglycaemia.  The  activity  of  GLP-1  ceases  when 
plasma glucose concentration falls below 55 mg/dL. 
Type of application and aspects on development 
Boehringer  Ingelheim  International  GmbH  submitted  a  Marketing  Authorisation  Application  for  Glyxambi 
(empagliflozin/linagliptin  film-coated  tablets  with  the  strengths  10  mg/5  mg  and  25  mg/5  mg).  Glyxambi  is

The product is available in PVC/PVDC/aluminium perforated unit dose blisters packs. 
2.2.2.  Active Substances 
Empagliflozin 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance empagliflozin is (1S)-1,5-anhydro-1-(4-chloro-3-{4-[(3S)-
tetrahydrofuran-3-yloxy]benzyl}phenyl)-D-glucitol, corresponding to the molecular formula C 23H27ClO7 and 
has a relative molecular mass 450.9 g/mol. It has the following structure: 
Figure 1. Structure of empagliflozin. 
The structure of empagliflozin was unambiguously confirmed by 1H- and 13C-NMR, UV spectroscopy, FT-IR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Empagliflozin appears as a white to yellowish 
non-hygroscopic crystalline solid, very slightly soluble in water (pH 1-7.4), slightly soluble in acetonitrile and 
ethanol, sparingly soluble in methanol, and practically insoluble in toluene. The molecule has no ionisable 
centres. Its partition coefficient has been determined to be 1.7 at pH 7.4.  
Empagliflozin is chiral and possesses 6 stereogenic centres. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by 
chiral HPLC/specific optical rotation. A single polymorphic form has been observed for empagliflozin and is 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 10/107 
  
  
 
 
 
consistently produced by the proposed manufacturing process. The isolated form is non-solvated and non-
hydrated. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Empagliflozin is synthesized by a single manufacturer in 4 steps from well-defined starting materials with 
acceptable specifications. The active substance is then recrystallized and milled. The process has been 
described in sufficient detail; amounts, yields and batch size have been stated. Reprocessing has been 
described and consists of repeating relevant steps. No new solvents are introduced for reprocessing.  
Five of the stereocentres originate from the chiral pool whereas the sixth benzylic centre is controlled by a 
diastereoselective reduction during the process. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and fate and characterised. None were deemed to have genotoxic potential.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are considered adequate. 
The active substance is packaged in a double LDPE bags closed with cable binders, then stored away from 
light in a fibre drum. The primary packaging material complies with the relevant EC regulations and Ph. Eur. 
requirements. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
diastereomer (chiral HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), residue on ignition, 
and particle size (laser diffraction).  
Optical purity is controlled by a test for specific optical rotation in the two chiral starting materials.  
None of the specified or routinely observed impurities is considered a degradation product of empagliflozin.  
The limits of 3 specified impurities are above the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A and they have 
been toxicologically qualified (these data were assessed in the MAA procedure for Jardiance 
(EMEA/H/C/002677)). 
Two potential residual solvents are specified in the specification with their respective ICH Q3C limits. Solvents 
not classified in ICH Q3C are treated as organic impurities according to ICH Q3A (R2).  
The omission of testing for benzene and heavy metals has been justified based on batch data. The omission 
of a microbial limit test from the specification has also been justified based on the fact that water or aqueous 
solvents are not used in the final step and on batch data.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Sufficient information regarding the reference standards used has been provided. 
Batch analysis data on 5 commercial scale batches of the active substance is provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Batch analysis data on a further 40 batches (varying 
from pilot to commercial scale) carried out using previous incarnations of the synthetic process and used for 
toxicology and clinical studies are also provided, with all batches conforming to specifications in place at the 
time.

Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of empagliflozin manufactured using the proposed 
commercial process stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 60 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Stability was also tested under stressed conditions in the solid 
state (one commercial scale batch) and in solution (one development batch). Solid state photostability testing 
following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one commercial scale batch. Solid state material was also 
exposed to high temperature (80 ºC) and to open storage conditions (40 ºC / 75 % RH). Empagliflozin was 
tested in solution at low (2.5), intrinsic, and high (13) pH, each under heat stress conditions (80 ºC); in the 
presence of strong (H2O2), or mild (2,2’-Azobis(2-methylpropionitrile)) oxidants; and under UV irradiation 
(20 W/m2). The following parameters were tested: appearance, impurities (HPLC), diastereomer (chiral 
HPLC), assay (HPLC), water content (KF) and particle size (laser diffraction). The analytical methods used 
were the same as for release and were shown to be stability indicating. 
No changes to any test parameters were observed under long term or accelerated conditions. Empagliflozin is 
neither photosensitive, nor affected by high temperature or humidity in the solid state. In solution, it is prone 
to degradation at low and high pH and in the presence of a strong oxidant. It is also unstable to a mild 
oxidant at high pH and slightly sensitive to light. None of the chiral centres showed any propensity to 
epimerisation during the stability studies. The results demonstrate that the analytical methods are stability 
indicating. The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. Primary 
stability studies on the three commercial batches will continue up until the proposed re-test period. 
Based on the presented stability data the proposed retest period of 60 months without specific storage 
conditions is accepted. 
Linagliptin 
General information 
Linagliptin is chemically designated as 8-[(3R)-3-aminopiperidin-1-yl]-7-(but-2-yn-1-yl)-3-methyl-1- [(4-
methylquinazolin-2-yl)methyl]-3,7-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione corresponding to the molecular formula 
C 25H28N8O2 and has a relative molecular mass 472.5 g/mol and has the following structure:  
Figure 2. Structure of linagliptin.  
The chemical structure of linagliptin has been confirmed by UV, IR, 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy and mass 
spectrometry (MS). The content of carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen has been determined by elemental 
analysis. The absolute configuration of the active substance at the chiral carbon has been determined by X-
ray crystallography. The solid state properties of linagliptin were characterised using light microscopy, 
thermal analysis (TG and DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction. 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 12/107 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Linagliptin appears as a white to yellowish slightly hygroscopic crystals with a rod-like habit. It is very soluble 
in aqueous media (> 1 mg/ml) over the entire physiological pH range. It is soluble in methanol, sparingly 
soluble in ethanol and very slightly soluble in isopropanol and acetone. Linagliptin is classified as class III 
compound according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS).  
Linagliptin has one chiral centre at the 3-aminopiperidine moiety. The substance used for the manufacture of 
Glyxambi tablets is the (R) enantiomer. 
Linagliptin manufactured according to the proposed manufacturing process exists in two polymorphic 
modifications ("Form A" and "Form B"), which are enantiotropically related and which reversibly convert into 
each other approximately at room temperature. Uptake of water does not change the crystal modification. 
The two polymorphic forms do not differ with regard to biopharmaceutically relevant physicochemical 
properties and therefore the solid-state differences are unlikely to have any impact on bioavailability.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The synthetic process for linagliptin consists of three steps from three well defined commercially available 
starting materials. The synthesis is followed by milling process. Reprocessing includes repetition of the 
crystallisation step, which is acceptable.  
The amounts of raw materials, yields, and equipment have been specified, and the in-process controls have 
been well described. Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and 
control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are 
considered adequate.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
fate.  
The active substance is packaged in a double LDPE bags closed with cable binders, then stored in a fibre 
drum. The primary packaging material complies with the relevant EC regulations and Ph. Eur. requirements. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, chiral HPLC, DSC), impurities 
(LC), organic volatile impurities (GC), residual solvents (GC), enantiomeric purity (LC), water content (KF), 
assay (LC), sulphated ash, particle size (laser diffraction).  
The proposed regulatory specification was established based on the available developmental, manufacturing, 
and stability data. Impurities exceeding the qualification threshold of 0.15% were toxicologically qualified. 
The limit for each individual unspecified impurity as well as the organic volatile impurities is consistent with 
the identification threshold of ICH guidance Q3A (R2).  
The residual solvents are specified in accordance with the ICH Q3C (R4) guidance whereas other class 2 
solvents used in earlier synthetic steps remain consistently well below 10% of the respective ICH levels and, 
are,  therefore, not controlled in the active substance specification. 
Assay limits were justified taking into account the maximum permitted level of impurities, numerous batch 
analysis data as well as the analytical error of the assay methods.   
The active substance particle size was set based on developmental data on the manufacturability and 
performance of the finished product (dissolution, content uniformity, stability).

The omission of routine tests for polymorphic form, metal residues, genotoxic substances, and microbiological 
purity in the active substance specification was sufficiently justified based on relevant ICH guidance and 
appropriate experimental data. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Sufficient information regarding the reference standards used has been provided. 
Batch analysis data on 13 commercial scale batches of the active substance was provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. Batch analysis date on further 23 batches 
(varying from pilot to commercial scale) carried out in different manufacturing sites and using different 
suppliers of the starting materials were also provided, with all batches conforming to specifications in place at 
the time. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of linagliptin manufactured using the proposed commercial 
process stored in the intended commercial packaging for up to 60 months under long term conditions 
(25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided in accordance with the ICH Q1A(R2) guideline.  
Tested parameters were appearance, melting temperature, organic impurities, organic volatile impurities, 
enantiomeric purity, water content, assay, and particle size. The analytical procedures were shown to be 
stability indicating.  
No significant changes were observed. The only trends were a slight change in appearance from white to 
slightly yellow at both storage conditions and, a slight increase in the level of an impurity both at long-term 
and accelerated conditions. This impurity is not a degradation product of the active substance but results 
from a hydrolytic degradation of another impurity which is the process-related, the level of which slowly 
decreased during the course of the stability study. 
In addition, one of the three stability batches was subjected to stress studies at elevated temperature, 
humidity, pH, oxidative conditions and light in the solid state and in solution. Photostability testing of the 
solid drug substance was performed according to ICH guideline Q1B. Tested parameters were appearance, 
melting temperature, organic impurities, enantiomeric purity, water (only in solid state), and assay.  
In solid form, the drug substance is very stable at elevated temperatures, high humidity and the combined 
effect of both conditions. During photostability testing, only a slight change in colour was observed, but no 
change in impurity profile. 
In solution, no degradation was observed at neutral and intrinsic pH. Degradation is only observed at 
strongly acidic conditions or at strongly basic conditions at elevated temperature. None of the observed 
degradation products were found at long term and accelerated conditions.  
The drug substance showed a slightly higher sensitivity towards photolysis in solution as compared to the 
solid state. Strongly oxidative conditions caused no decomposition of the drug substance in solution. 
Based on the presented stability data the proposed retest period of 60 months without specific storage 
conditions is accepted.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Glyxambi is provided as immediate release film-coated tablets intended for oral administration.  
10 mg / 5 mg strength tablets are pale yellow, arc triangular, flat-faced, bevel-edged, film-coated tablets, 
debossed on one side with the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol and on the other side with "10/5". 
25 mg / 5 mg strength tablets are pale pink, arc triangular, flat-faced, bevel-edged, film-coated tablets, 
debossed on one side with the Boehringer Ingelheim company symbol and on the other side with "25/5". The 
two strengths can be distinguished by colour and debossing. They have the same form and size and have no 
score line.  
The composition of the two strengths is identical except for the amounts of empagliflozin and mannitol. The 
amount of mannitol is varied to compensate for the difference in the amount of empagliflozin in the two 
strengths, in order to yield the same tablet weight for both strengths. 
The objective of pharmaceutical development was to develop a fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and 
linagliptin in an oral tablet formulation, for the once daily long-term treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Formulation development was based on the experience with empagliflozin / linagliptin mono products 
Jardiance and Trajenta, respectively.  Glyxambi was developed using a Quality by Design (QbD) approach. 
The presented Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) is considered appropriate for the intended use (table 1). 
Using the QTPP as a starting point, the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the product were identified and 
used to guide formulation and process development.

The identified CQAs are appearance, identification of API, drug content, content uniformity, drug release, 
degradation products, microbiological purity and mechanical strength. 
In addition to the quality targets defined in the QTPP, the following development goals for the design of 
empagliflozin / linagliptin film-coated tablets were defined: 
• 
Possibly similar formulation to one of the two mono products 
•  Similar manufacturing process to one of the two mono products 
•  Unique shape in order to differentiate tablets from other Boehringer Ingelheim diabetes products 
• 
Film-coating and debossing for differentiation of dosage strengths 
Both empagliflozin and linagliptin are classified as a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) class III 
compounds (high solubility, low permeability). 
The particle size of each substance is controlled in the respective active substance specification. The limits 
have been established during development of the mono-component products and they were shown to be 
suitable for Glyxambi film-coated tablets with regard to manufacturability as well as quality attributes such as 
content uniformity and drug release. 
Linagliptin’s two polymorphic forms A and B reversibly convert into each other at room temperature. Active 
substance batches are either form A, form B or a mix of forms A and B. Studies have demonstrated that both 
polymorphic forms have the same solubility and intrinsic dissolution properties, are stable and highly soluble 
so that polymorphism does not affect bioavailability. 
The compatibility of the two active substances was investigated using powder triturations at the extremes of 
a range of possible dose ratios of empagliflozin and linagliptin. There was no indication for chemical 
degradation of empagliflozin. Some degradation of linagliptin was observed in open containers at 40°C/75% 
RH. However, no tendency towards degradation of linagliptin was seen at any of the tested conditions in any 
formulation investigated in the course of the development. 
All the excipients used in Glyxambi are of compendial grade, including those used for the film-coat, which are 
used as proprietary ready-to-use mixtures. They are commonly used in oral commercial pharmaceutical 
products and have been selected in order to achieve the desired quality attributes of the product, to support 
a robust manufacturing process and to meet regulatory and pharmacopoeial standards. Excipient selection 
was further based on the previous experience and knowledge from the development of the single entity 
tablets (Trajenta and Jardiance).   
The compatibility of the two active substances with all excipients was investigated in binary mixtures (1:1). 
No degradation was observed with the excipients of the tablet core but some degradation was observed in 
the respective binary mixture with macrogol 6000 and the iron oxides. However these findings are considered 
non-critical because these excipients are part of the film-coat and are in minimal contact with the active 
substances. Furthermore potential interactions were not confirmed by the stability data of the finished 
product and are therefore not considered relevant. 
The stages of formulation development were summarised. The linagliptin 5 mg tablet core formulation was 
used as the starting point. Based on satisfactory stress stability studies of a prototype single layer tablet, it 
was decided that physical separation of the two active substances was not necessary. Due to the unusual 
tablet shape, tablet manufacturability was investigated in a set of experiments in order to screen for 
influencing factors regarding tabletting behaviour and tablet properties. The investigated parameters were 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 16/107 
  
  
moisture content of the dried granulate, magnesium stearate concentration and mixing time. The major 
influencing factors were identified. Briefly, ejection force is predominantly influenced by the amount of 
magnesium stearate; tablet hardness is mainly influenced by the loss on drying (LOD) and also partially 
influenced by the magnesium stearate mixing time; and disintegration is mainly influenced by the LOD and 
also influenced by the magnesium stearate amount and mixing time. No interactions of factors were 
observed. The influence of the moisture content of the granulate was further investigated. In addition, 
lubricant concentration and lubricant combinations were evaluated in more detail to further improve 
compression behaviour. The lubricant composition with the best results was selected and then the amount of 
disintegrant in the formulation was optimised.  
To improve differentiation of the two strengths, a pale yellow and a pale pink hypromellose-based non-
functional film-coat was added, in the so called lab-scale formulation, for the 10/5 mg and 25/5 mg tablets 
respectively.  
At the next stage ready-to-use mixtures of the same composition were introduced instead of individual 
dispensing of the components, and debossing was introduced. The general manufacturing process remained 
unchanged. Dissolution profiles remained unchanged. Comparative dissolution profiles between tablet cores 
and film-coated tablets show a slightly slower dissolution within first 15 minutes for the film-coated tablets 
but more than 85% of both active substances was dissolved after 15 minutes. All the tablet formulations with 
10/5 & 25/5 mg strengths used during different phases of clinical development have been manufactured by 
wet granulation process. A bioequivalence study (1275.3) was performed with the film coated formulation 
(lab scale formulation) comparing Empagliflozin / Linagliptin 25/5 mg film-coated tablets with the respective 
empagliflozin and linagliptin mono products. The results showed bioequivalence of the formulations. In 
addition, a side batch formulation of Empagliflozin / Linagliptin 25/5 mg film-coated tablets with an intended 
slower dissolution rate also showed bioequivalence to the lab-scale formulation and therefore dissolution was 
considered not critical for bioavailability. Development studies have shown that tablet hardness across a 
range of compression forces does not affect dissolution. Holding times for granulation liquid, ready-to-use 
mix for coating and maximum wet granulation processing time were evaluated. It was demonstrated that the 
proposed holding time does not impact the microbiological quality of the granulation liquid and coating 
suspension. 
The production scale formulation was further optimised to assure punch/die lubrication during long-term 
compression at production scale. Comparative dissolution profiles between production and pilot scale batches 
showed no differences. This so called “production scale formulation” was eventually used in phase III clinical 
studies. 
A dissolution test has been developed to control the CQA ‘drug release’ during development. The dissolution 
method was based on the solubility of the active substances (ASs), the in-vitro dissolution of film-coated 
tablets within the physiological pH range 1-6.8 (e.g. production batch), and the stability of ASs in dissolution 
medium. The discriminative power of the dissolution test is limited to particle size of empagliflozin and 
storage conditions. However, as the pharmacokinetic behaviour is expected to be primarily affected by the 
low permeability and not by dissolution the disintegration test will be used for routine control (see below in 
“Product specification”). In addition, it was demonstrated that disintegration was more discriminative than 
dissolution testing.  
As described above, the formulation was designed to be similar to the linagliptin single entity product. 
Accordingly, the same manufacturing process technology is used. The manufacturing process is a robust 
standard manufacturing process consisting of high shear wet granulation, compression of tablets and film-
coating of the tablet cores. 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016

The different steps of the manufacturing process were evaluated through the use of risk assessment (QbD 
approach). The initial risk assessment to identify potential critical material attributes (CMA) and critical 
process parameters (CPP) was an informal process based on prior knowledge and the results of formulation 
development and early process development at lab-scale. The potential CPPs and CMAs identified were then 
investigated experimentally in detail at pilot scale. The investigated ranges were set to establish appropriate 
proven acceptable ranges (PARs) and to detect the impact of each potential CPP and CMA on the respective 
CQA. The ranges were not chosen to establish a design space, but to gain process knowledge for further 
scale-up. Set points were defined for the process parameters in full production scale to further limit variability 
within a range. Based on the experiments, a final risk assessment was performed. None of the process 
parameters was identified as critical. Particle size of both actives, microbiological quality of excipients from 
natural origin, loss on drying of the granulate, appearance, weight and hardness of tablet cores, appearance 
and weight/weight gain of film-coated tablets are CMA and controlled by IPCs at relevant points in the 
manufacturing process or raw material specifications. All CMAs are included in the control strategy. The 
proposed control strategy is found acceptable. 
Glyxambi container closure system consists of push-through blister cards, composed of PVC/PVDC forming 
foil and aluminum lidding foil. The forming foil is a two-layer laminate with and outer polyvinyl chloride and 
an inner polyvinylidene chloride film. It was confirmed that the PVC/PVDC/Alu film complies with EU-
Regulations No.10/2011 and No.1935/2004/EC. The PVC base film of the blister complies with European 
Pharmacopoeia chapter 3.1.11. It was further confirmed that the components of the heat seal lacquer for the 
aluminium lidding foil are listed in EU-Regulation 10/2011. The lidding foil conforms to the requirements of 
EU-Regulation 1935/2004. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is a standard manufacturing process comprising wet granulation of the drug 
substances with excipients, drying, screening of the dried granulate, pre- and final blending, subsequent 
compression of the final blend into tablets and finally film-coating of the tablet cores. 
The in-process controls (IPCs) have been presented and are justified in relation to how the quality attributes 
are affected. The control strategy ensures that the manufacturing process consistently delivers a product that 
meets the defined criteria for all CQAs.  
The maximum holding time for each of the intermediates (granulate, final blend and tablet cores) has been 
specified. Bulk film-coated tablets stability (see ”Stability of the product”) has been studied. It is confirmed 
that the shelf life of the drug product starts from the date of production and is set according to the relevant 
CHMP guideline (CPMP/QWP/072/96). 
The manufacturing process has been validated on three consecutive production-scale batches of each 
strength manufactured at the intended manufacturing site. In conclusion it is considered that the 
manufacturing process is sufficiently robust to provide assurance that it produces finished product film-coated 
tablets of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for: appearance 
(visual), identification of empagliflozin (HPLC, UV), identification of linagliptin (HPLC, UV), assay of 
empagliflozin and linagliptin (HPLC), degradation products of empagliflozin and linagliptin (HPLC), uniformity 
of dosage units of empagliflozin (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units of linagliptin (Ph. Eur.) and 
disintegration (Ph. Eur.).

As mentioned above, disintegration is proposed as a routine test for substitution of dissolution testing to 
ensure the control of the CQA ‘drug release’ in line with ICH Q6A, decision tree # 7. The acceptance criterion 
for disintegration is based on statistical evaluation of release results of clinical and the currently available 
stability results. 
The absence of the test parameter microbial limits in the specification was justified in accordance with 
ICH Q6A, decision tree # 8. Based on the water activity characteristics and the release and stability data, 
growth inhibitory properties of the drug product were demonstrated. The omission of this parameter is 
further justified with upstream microbiological controls such as excipient (prone to microbial growth) controls, 
environmental monitoring and validated equipment holding times and with data showing that the 
manufacturing process does not contribute to microbial growth. The duration of wet granulation is limited to 
the set point and subsequently drying is directly started. 
The parameter water content is not included in the specification as appropriate in-process controls are in 
place for loss on drying of the granulate. Batch release results demonstrate robust results for loss on drying. 
In addition during stability studies no relevant influence of the increase up to the equilibrium water content 
on the test parameters degradation and disintegration was observed at long term and open storage 
conditions at 25°/60% RH. 
In accordance with decision tree #5 of ICH Q6A, enantiomeric purity testing is regarded irrelevant as chiral 
inversion of empagliflozin and linagliptin was not observed during stability testing of the active substances, 
and no chiral inversion of the active substance was observed in stress stability studies of the finished 
product. 
Residual solvents are not tested because no organic solvents are used during finished product manufacture 
and each excipient and the active substances meet the limits per option 1 of ICH Q3C (R5). 
A correlation between compression force and tablet hardness was seen during development. The IPC 
specification of tablet core hardness ensures the drug release from the final film-coated tablet. 
The limits for the degradations products are in line with ICH Q3B(R2) and are considered justified. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non compendial methods have been 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the used 
reference standards has been presented. 
Batch analysis data five commercial scale batches of both strengths and for ten lab or pilot scale 
development batches were presented. All batches are representative of the commercial formula and process. 
All batches meet the commercial specification limits. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches of each strength stored under long term conditions for up to 
36 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for six months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and 
were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
One batch of the 10/5 mg strength showed atypical stability behaviour. This was investigated and was found 
to be due to a contamination with lactose during weighing, which resulted in the formation of the lactose 
adduct of linagliptin. It was acknowledged that this single event has no consequences for the control 
Assessment report

Page 19/107 
  
  
 
strategy. It has been confirmed that measures were taken to avoid a repetition of this deviation. The stability 
batch was replaced by another of the same batch size. 
Samples were tested according to the specifications, except for the tests of identity and uniformity of dosage 
units.  Dissolution  and  microbiological  quality  were  monitored  with  validated  methods.  The  methods  are 
deemed appropriate for their intended purpose and are stability indicating. 
For all batches no relevant change was observed under long-term storage conditions at any time point 
investigated. At accelerated storage conditions minor changes were only observed for the test parameters 
disintegration, assay of linagliptin as well as degradation of linagliptin and empagliflozin. All results were in 
compliance with the specification. No significant trends were observed. 
Stress stability studies under elevated temperature (50°C), humidity (samples were stored in open HDPE 
bottles for 6 months at 25°C/60 % RH, 30°C/75 % RH and 40°C/75 % RH) and a photostability study under 
ICH Q1B conditions were carried out on one production scale primary stability batch of each strength. All 
samples were subjected to test parameters proposed for routine testing. Additionally, the following test 
parameters were performed to support omission of these tests for routine testing: loss on drying, dissolution 
of empagliflozin and linagliptin, resistance to crushing and enantiomeric purity. At humidity stress conditions, 
water activity was tested in addition as this study is also used to demonstrate in-use stability for multi-use 
packaging configurations.  
Under light stress conditions no change was observed in any of the parameters tested. Under elevated 
temperature stress a change was only observed for test parameter degradation of linagliptin. The tablets 
showed good stability properties under humidity stress conditions. Changes were only observed at 
30 °C /75 % RH and at 40 °C /75 % RH for test parameters degradation of linagliptin and empagliflozin, 
assay of linagliptin, dissolution and disintegration. The changes for test parameter disintegration were more 
pronounced at 40 °C/ 75 % RH for both dosage strengths, albeit minimal for the 25 mg /5 mg dosage 
strength. The changes for test parameter dissolution were more pronounced at 40 °C/75 % RH and only for 
the 10 mg /5 mg dosage strength (at 3 and 6 months).  
It was concluded that that the finished product is not sensitive to light and has some sensitivity to elevated 
temperatures and humidity. It is therefore expected that the product will be stable under in-use conditions. 
One production scale batch of each strength was put on bulk stability in stainless steel containers and in 
polyethylene bags in hobbock. Batches were stored under warehouse conditions (15-25 °C /45-65% RH) up 
to 12 months. Tested parameters were description, disintegration, dissolution, degradation, assay, and 
microbiological quality. No relevant changes occurred. It was concluded that storage up to 12 months under 
warehouse conditions has not impact on the quality of the bulk drug product. 
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 3 years is acceptable without any special 
storage conditions, as stated in SmPC (section 6.3).

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Glyxambi is a fixed dose combination product containing two known active substances which are used in 
other approved products. The pharmaceutical development was based on prior knowledge with those 
products and the results of formulation and process development for the combination product.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  non-clinical  package  of  Glyxambi  refers  to  the  non-clinical  studies  conducted  with  the  individual 
components  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  that  have  each  undergone  complete  nonclinical  development 
programs.  
In support of the application of Glyxambi, bridging studies were performed to support the registration of the 
empagliflozin/linagliptin fixed-dose combination (FDC): 
• Pharmacodynamic  effects  of  the  empagliflozin/linagliptin  combination  were  studied  in  a  rat  disease  model 
for diabetes. 
• The effect of empagliflozin on the in vitro metabolism of linagliptin and vice versa was evaluated in human 
hepatocytes. 
• Combination  toxicity  studies  of  up  to  13  weeks  and  combination  embryo-fetal  development  studies  were 
performed in the Wistar rat. In all combination toxicity studies, empagliflozin and linagliptin were tested in 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016

clinically  relevant  dose  ratios  of  2:1  and  5:1.  These  rat  studies  were  also  used  for  pharmacokinetic 
investigations of the drug combination. 
Furthermore, a juvenile toxicity study in rats with empagliflozin has been submitted with this application for 
the empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Empagliflozin 
Empagliflozin  is  a  selective  and  potent  inhibitor  of  the  human,  rat  and  mouse  glucose  transporter  SGLT2. 
Three  glucuronide  metabolites  of  empagliflozin  have  low  affinity  for  SGLT2,  and  these  therefore  do  not 
contribute  to  the  pharmacological  effect  of  empagliflozin.  The  primary  pharmacodynamics  effect  of 
empagliflozin on inhibition of glucose re-uptake in the kidneys was demonstrated in mice, rats and dogs. All 
species  showed  increased  urine  glucose  concentrations  after  treatment.  Increased  urine  glucose  excretion 
leads to lowered blood glucose concentration, as shown in diabetic db/dbmice and ZDF rats. The diabetic ZDF 
rat has increased glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which was reduced by treatment with empagliflozin. 
Linagliptin 
Linagliptin is a potent, selective, orally active, competitive, reversible and long-acting inhibitor of DPP-4. The 
main  metabolite  of  linagliptin,  CD1790,  is  pharmacologically  inactive.  DPP-4  is  expressed  in  many  tissues 
including  kidneys,  liver,  intestine,  lymphocytes  and  vascular  endothelial  cells.  A  significant  level  of  DPP-4 
activity  is  also  observed  in  plasma.  By  inhibiting  DPP-4,  linagliptin  prolongs  and  enhances  activity  of  the 
incretins  glucagon-like  peptide-1  (GLP-1)  and  glucose-dependent  insulinotropic  peptide  (GIP),  resulting  in 
increased  glucose-dependent  insulin  secretion,  suppression  of  glucagon  secretion  and  delay  of  gastric 
emptying and thereby to the maintenance of post-meal glycemic control.  
The primary pharmacodynamic effect of linagliptin on inhibition of DPP-4 activity was demonstrated in rhesus 
monkeys, beagle dogs and in normal and diabetic db/dbmice and ZDF rats. The results of these studies suggest 
that  a  once  daily  dosing  frequency  is  adequate  to  maintain  an  appropriate  degree  of  DPP-4  inhibition  that 
exerts therapeutic effects on glucose. Long-term treatment of diabetic mice reduced fed plasma glucose and 
HbA1c  after  14  and  28  days.  This  improved  hyperglycaemia  could  not  be  explained  by  improved  insulin 
sensitivity by linagliptin.  
Empagliflozin plus linagliptin 
Empagliflozin (3 mg/kg) in combination with linagliptin (1 mg/kg) has been tested acutely with an oral 
glucose tolerance test in Zucker fatty diabetes rats. Although glucose excursion, as assessed by AUC, was 
significantly reduced by each mono-therapy as compared to control, the combination treatment achieved a 
significant further reduction of glucose AUC versus control. Furthermore, the reduction in glucose AUC 
mediated by the combination was superior to the effect achieved by each monotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 22/107 
  
  
 
Overall, the combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin showed a superior effect on glycemic control as 
compared to the respective monotherapies and the two different mechanisms of action were additive in their 
efficacy in a rat disease model for diabetes, thus supporting the proposed fixed-dose combination application. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Studies on secondary pharmacology showed that empagliflozin had an effect on body weight loss in obese 
rats, most likely due to a small decrease in food consumption, together with the pharmacological effect of 
inhibition of glucose re-uptake in the kidneys. Safety pharmacology studies showed no relevant effect on 
central nervous system, respiratory system, gastro-intestinal system, and cardiovascular system. 
Combination treatment with metformin, a sulphonylurea (glipizide), a DPP-4 inhibitor (linagliptin), a GLP-1 
analog (exendin-4), an α-glucosidase inhibitor (voglibose), a PPARγ agonist (pioglitazone) and with insulin 
resulted in greater improvement in glucose tolerance in ZDF rats compared to each individual monotherapy. 
Studies on secondary pharmacology showed that linagliptin has no off-target activity at therapeutic 
concentrations. Although inhibition of DPP-4 may result in decreased gastric emptying, this effect was not 
observed in the secondary pharmacodynamic study evaluating the effect of linagliptin on gastrointestinal 
function in rats. Although in-vitro cardiovascular safety studies indicated a low pro-arrhythmic potential for 
linagliptin, this potential was not confirmed by the results of the in vivo cardiovascular safety studies. Overall, 
administration of therapeutic dosages linagliptin appears to be safe for patients suffering from diabetes 
mellitus. 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with the empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC. This was 
considered acceptable, as empagliflozin and linagliptin have different mechanisms of action and no interaction 
is anticipated with empagliflozin/linagliptin combination as there is sufficient knowledge about potential off-
target effects of the individual compounds.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
There  were  no  adverse  effects  in  empagliflozin  or  linagliptin  safety  pharmacology  studies  indicative  of 
potential  human  safety  concerns.  Therefore,  evaluation  of  the  combination  in  a  battery  of  safety 
pharmacology 
studies  was  not 
conducted.  The 
lack  of 
safety  pharmacology 
studies 
for 
empagliflozin/linagliptin combination is acceptable from nonclinical point of view.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  studies  were  conducted  with  the  combination  empagliflozin  and 
linagliptin.  The  lack  of  non-clinical  studies  on  the  potential  of  the  empagliflozin/linagliptin  combination  to 
interact  pharmacodynamically  with  other  drugs  is  acceptable;  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  affect  glucose 
homeostasis by different mechanisms.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Empagliflozin 
Oral bioavailability of empagliflozin was high in mouse (90-97%) and dog (89%) and medium in rat (31%). 
The steady state volume of distribution was medium (0.6-1.2 L/kg) and binding to plasma proteins was high 
in all species examined (87-92%). The pharmacokinetics were linear. The elimination half-live was medium in

mouse (0.7-1.3 h), but longer in rat (3.6 h) in rat and dog (6.3 h). Tissue distribution was limited. Highest 
tissue  concentrations  were  observed  at  1  hour  and  were  measured  in  gastrointestinal  tract  contents,  urine 
and  bile.  Some  empagliflozin-related  material  was  found  after  24  hours  in  the  kidney,  suggesting  some 
accumulation  may  occur  when  using  empagliflozin  daily.  Toxicokinetics  showed  no  consistent  effect  of 
repeated dosing on plasma exposure, indicating that there was little or no accumulation. Faecal and/or biliary 
excretion are the most important elimination routes.  
Empagliflozin crosses the placenta in rats, although at low levels. Empagliflozin may be excreted via milk with 
milk:plasma ratios up to 5.0 as is observed in rats.  
Linagliptin 
Oral  bioavailability  of  linagliptin  was  moderate  in  mice  (18-44%),  rats  (50%)  and  monkeys  (69%).  The 
steady  state  volume  of  distribution  was  high  in  all  species  (>5  L/kg),  which  suggests  extensive  tissue 
distribution.  The  pharmacokinetics  were  non-linear  be  due  to  saturation  of  binding  to  DPP-4  in  plasma  and 
tissues.  During  chronic  use  of  linagliptin,  steady  state  in  tissues  will  be  achieved  quickly  once  DPP-4  is 
saturated.  Maximum  concentrations  were  seen  30  minutes  post-dose  for  all  tissues,  with  highest 
concentrations  in  liver  and  kidneys.  Measurable  concentrations  were  found  168  hours  post-dose  in  liver, 
spleen,  thymus,  Harder´s  gland,  lung,  salivary  gland,  epididymis,  adrenal,  skin  and  bone  marrow.  In  the 
kidney,  a  significant  retention  was  observed  for  the  cortex  region  and  especially  for  the  zona  intermedia. 
Toxicokinetic  studies  showed  some  plasma  accumulation  in  rat  and  dog  after  repeated  dosing.  Therefore, 
only limited accumulation in tissue is expected to occur. 
The  binding  of  linagliptin  to  plasma  proteins  is  high  at  concentrations  about  1  nM  (>99%).  The  plasma 
protein  binding  is  concentration  dependent,  since  the  binding  is  lower  (70-85%)  when  concentrations  are 
about 30 nM or higher. This observed concentration-dependency was due to saturation of binding to DPP-4, 
which is within the plasma protein fraction. The predominant route of elimination of linagliptin is via faeces, 
with  a  minor  contribution  eliminated  in  urine  (<30%).  A  considerable  fraction  of  the  faecally  excreted 
linagliptin can be assigned to biliary excretion.  
Linagliptin  crosses  the  placenta  barrier  in  rats  and  rabbits.  Linagliptin  may  be  excreted  via  milk  with 
milk:plasma ratios up to 4.0 as is observed in rats.  
Empagliflozin plus linagliptin 
Single-dose  dose  pharmacokinetics  of  empagliflozin/linagliptin  combination  in  rats  showed  that  exposure  to 
empagliflozin increased dose-proportionally and linagliptin more than dose-proportionally at exposures up to 
10-times of the therapeutic exposure to the individual compounds when using 25 mg empagliflozin and 5 mg 
linagliptin as fixed combination.  
Repeated-dose toxicokinetic investigations performed as part of the toxicology studies during 2-week and 13-
week  oral  (gavage)  combination  toxicology  studies  in  rats  confirmed  these  findings.  These  studies  also 
showed  that,  at  high  dose  levels,  linagliptin  increased  the  exposure  to  empagliflozin  and,  vice  versa,  that 
empagliflozin decreased the exposure to linagliptin. These exposure changes were noted at high doses in rats 
(300 mg/60 mg empagliflozin/linagliptin), corresponding with 35- to 40-times of the therapeutic exposure to 
the  individual  compounds  when  using  25  mg  empagliflozin  and  5  mg  linagliptin  as  fixed  combination. 
Although  a  mechanistic  explanation  for  this  effect  has  not  been  provided,  it  is  unlikely  that  these  exposure 
changes are of relevance at therapeutic exposures.

EMA/749639/2016

Pharmacokinetic  interactions  of  empagliflozin/linagliptin  combination  via  plasma  protein  binding  are  not 
expected. 
Binding  to  plasma  proteins  is  high  in  all  species  examined  for  empagliflozin  (87-92%).  In  human  plasma, 
protein binding was 82-84%, and this binding was predominantly to albumin. Protein binding of empagliflozin 
was  independent  on  the  concentration  in  the  range  investigated,  which  indicates  no  saturation  of  binding 
sites. The concentration range (0.01-40 µg/mL) covers the plasma levels of empagliflozin at the therapeutic 
dose  of  25  mg/5  mg  of  the  empagliflozin/linagliptin  FDC  (Cmax  583  -  862  nM  ≈  0.25  -  0.4  µg/mL,  report 
U11-1690). 
The  binding  of  linagliptin  to  plasma  proteins  is  high  at  concentrations  about  1  nM  (>99%).  The  plasma 
protein  binding  is  concentration  dependent,  since  the  binding  is  lower  (70-85%)  when  concentrations  are 
about  30  nM  or  higher.  This  observed  concentration-dependency  was  shown  to  be  due  to  saturation  of 
binding to DPP-4, which is within the plasma protein fraction. These data indicate that plasma concentrations 
of  DPP-4  may  influence  the  kinetics  of  linagliptin.  Variation  in  the  fraction  unbound  of  linagliptin  in  human 
plasma  is  expected  within  the  clinically  anticipated  plasma  levels  (6.14  -  8.19  nM,  report  U11-1690). 
Interactions  with  other  drugs  via  plasma-protein  binding  might  occur,  but  are  not  considered  clinically 
relevant.  
Partitioning  of  empagliflozin  into  red  blood  cells  was  limited  and  independent of  the  concentration  in  any  of 
the species investigated. 
The  blood-plasma  ratio  at  a  plasma  concentration  of  300  nM  [14C]linagliptin  was  ~1  in  rats  and  ~0.6  in 
dogs, monkeys and humans. At 1 nM [14C]linagliptin, the blood-plasma ratio was much lower (~0.09 in rats 
and  ~0.05  in  monkeys).  This  concentration  dependency  is  probably  due  to  the  binding  to  plasma  DPP-4. 
Linagliptin  is  mainly  located  in  plasma,  especially  at  therapeutic  plasma  levels,  giving  no  cause  to  expect 
extensive binding to erythrocytes.  
Metabolic interactions between empagliflozin and linagliptin are not expected.  
The  potential  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  the  in-vitro  metabolism  of  linagliptin  and  vice  versa  was  evaluated 
using  human  hepatocytes.  Weak  inhibition  of  total  empagliflozin  metabolism  by  human  hepatocytes  was 
observed when co-incubated with linagliptin. Calculated Ki values of an inhibition of empagliflozin metabolism 
by  human  hepatocytes  by  linagliptin  were  in  the  range  of  8.8  to  69  μM.  Based  on  therapeutic  plasma 
concentrations of empagliflozin below 1 μM and of linagliptin in the low nanomolar range, mutual metabolic 
drug-drug interactions of empagliflozin and linagliptin due to inhibition of hepatic metabolism are unlikely to 
occur. 
CYP  enzymes  do  not  contribute  significantly  to  metabolism  of  empagliflozin.  Biotransformation  of 
empagliflozin primarily involved glucuronidation by UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7, and to a lesser 
extent  oxidation.  The  enzymes  involved  in  the  oxidative  metabolism  have  not  been  identified.  In  addition, 
empagliflozin  and  the  metabolites  of  empagliflozin  did  not  induce  or  inhibit  the  major  human  hepatic  CYP 
isoforms.  
Linagliptin  is  slowly  metabolised  by  CYP3A4  and  there  was  no  indication  for  a  contribution  of  other  CYP 
enzymes  or  monoamine  oxidases  in  the  metabolism  of  linagliptin.  Linagliptin  is  not  an  inducer  of  CYP 
enzymes. The metabolism of linagliptin by human liver microsomes and human hepatocytes was very low. 
Interactions via efflux transporters are unlikely. Empagliflozin is a substrate for P-gp and BCRP. Empagliflozin 
is  not  an  inhibitor  of  P-gp  and  it  weakly  inhibits  BCRP  and  MRP2.  Linagliptin  is  a  P-gp  substrate  with  low 
affinity  and  it  inhibited  P-gp  with  low  potency  with  IC50  values  >  50  μM.  Therefore,  the  likelihood  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 25/107 
  
  
linagliptin  to  inhibit  P-gp  at  therapeutic  plasma  levels  was  considered  to  be  low.  Linagliptin  is  neither  a 
substrate nor an inhibitor for BCRP and MRP2. 
Empagliflozin is a substrate of human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, but not OAT1 and 
OCT2. Empagliflozin also inhibits OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP1B1B1, and OAT3; however, IC50 values ranged 
from  45.2  to  >1000  μM,  making  interactions  via  these  uptake  transporters  at  therapeutic  concentrations 
unlikely.  Linagliptin  is  a  substrate  for  SLC  transporters,  suggesting  that  OATP1B3-mediated  hepatic  uptake, 
OCT2-mediated  renal  uptake  and  OAT4-,  OCTN1-  and  OCTN2-mediated  secretion  and  reabsorption  of 
linagliptin may occur in vivo. Linagliptin is an inhibitor of OCT1 and OATP1B1 with low affinity. No pronounced 
inhibition  or  only  minor  inhibition  by  linagliptin  was  observed  for  OATP1B3,  OATP2B1,  OAT1,  OAT3,  OAT4, 
OCT2, OCTN1 and OCTN2. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Empagliflozin 
The single-dose toxicity of empagliflozin is low in rodents.  
In repeated-dose studies in rodents and dogs, signs of toxicity were observed at exposures greater than or 
equal  to  10-times  the  therapeutic  dose  of  empagliflozin  of  10  mg  once  daily.  Most  toxicity  findings  were 
considered to be secondary to the pharmacologically mediated urinary glucose loss and electrolyte imbalance. 
The  kidneys  and  liver  were  the  principal  target  organs  of  toxicity.  The  effects  on  the  kidney  included 
increased organ weight in mice, rats and dogs, histopathology changes of the tubular system in rats (tubular 
dilation)  and  dogs  (cortical  tubular  nephropathy)  and  tubular  and  pelvic  mineralization  in  rats  at 
approximately  4-times  the  clinical  AUC  exposure.  of  empagliflozin  associated  with  the  25  mg  dose.  The 
effects  on  the  liver  included  increased  organ  weight  (due  to  hydropic  changes  possibly  due  to  electrolyte 
imbalance),  accompanied by  microvesicular  hepatocellular  vacuolation  (as  a  result  of lipid  mobilization)  and 
foci of hepatocellular necrosis at a low incidence. These effects were observed in mice and rats. In dogs, the 
effects  on  the  liver  consisted  of  centrilobular  degeneration  characterized  by  microvesicular  vacuolation  of 
centrilobular hepatocytes that may have been associated with loss of hepatocytes. Increases in liver enzymes 
were small in mice, rats and dogs. 
Other  target  organs  of  empagliflozin  included  the  pancreas  in  rats  (zymogen  depletion),  thyroid  in  rats 
(minimal  follicular  cell  hypertrophy),  and  adrenals  in  rats  (increased  weight,  vacuolation  of  the  zona 
glomerulosa) and dogs (vacuolation of the zona glomerulosa). The effects are not considered to be adverse. 
Depletion  of  zymogen  granules  in  the  pancreas  is  considered  secondary  to  the  increased  food  consumption 
and  decreased  body  weight.  Follicular  cell  hypertrophy  of  the  thyroid  seems  not  to  be  relevant  for  human, 
since  it  was  minimal  in  severity  and  not  observed  in  mice  or  dogs.  Vacuolation  of  the  zona  glomerulosa  in 
adrenals. Considering that empagliflozin will reduce sodium reabsorption by SGLT2 (and SGLT1 (in the rat)) 
inhibition, the observed effects in the zona glomerulosa may reflect an adaptive response to reduced sodium 
levels triggering increased aldosterone synthesis. 
Empagliflozin was not genotoxic. 
Empagliflozin  did  not  increase  the  incidence  of  tumours  in  female  rats  up  to  the  highest  dose  of  700 
mg/kg/day,  which  corresponds  to  approximately  72  times  the  maximal  clinical  AUC  exposure  to 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 26/107 
  
  
 
empagliflozin.  In  male  rats,  treatment-related  benign  vascular  proliferative  lesions  (haemangiomas)  of  the 
mesenteric lymph node were observed at the highest dose, but not at 300 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to 
approximately  26  times  the  clinical  exposure  to  empagliflozin.  Interstitial  cell  tumours  in  the  testes  were 
observed  with  a  higher  incidence  in  rats  at  300  mg/kg/day  and  above,  but  not  at  100  mg/kg/day  which 
corresponds  to  18  times  the  maximal  clinical  exposure  to  empagliflozin.  Both  tumours  are  common  in  rats 
and are unlikely to be relevant to humans. 
Empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumours in female mice at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day, which 
corresponds to 62 times the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. Empagliflozin induced renal tumours 
in male mice at 1000 mg/kg/day, but  not at 300 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 11 times 
the  maximal  clinical  exposure  to  empagliflozin.  The  mode  of  action  for  these  tumours  is  dependent  on  the 
natural  predisposition  of  the  male  mouse  to  renal  pathology  and  a  metabolic  pathway  not  reflective  of 
humans. The male mouse renal tumours are considered not relevant to humans. 
Empagliflozin  crosses  the  placenta  in  rats  at  low  levels.  At  exposures  sufficiently  in  excess  of  exposure  in 
humans  after  therapeutic  doses,  empagliflozin  had  no  adverse  effects  on  fertility  or  early  embryonic 
development.  Empagliflozin  administered  during  the  period  of  organogenesis  was  not  teratogenic.  Only  at 
maternally toxic doses, empagliflozin also caused bent limb bones in the rat and increased embryofetal loss 
in the rabbit. 
Empagliflozin may be excreted via milk with milk:plasma ratios up to 5.0 as is observed in rats.  
In  pre-  and  postnatal  toxicity  studies  in  rats,  reduced  weight  gain  of  offspring  was  observed  at  maternal 
exposures approximately 4-times the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. No such effect was seen at 
systemic  exposure  equal  to  the  maximal  clinical  exposure  to  empagliflozin.  The  relevance  of  this  finding  to 
humans is unclear. 
Empagliflozin  was  assessed  in  a  dermal  sensitization  test  in  mice  and  dermal  and  ocular  irritation  tests  in 
rabbits and was found to be negative in all tests.  
Linagliptin 
The toxicity profile of linagliptin has been established as part of the MAA for Trajenta.  
These data showed that the single-dose toxicity of linagliptin is low in rodents.  
In repeated-dose studies in mice and rats, the liver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract are the principal target 
organs of toxicity at 300 times the human exposure at therapeutic dose of 5 mg once daily. 
In rats effects on reproductive organs, thyroid and the lymphoid organs were seen at more than 1500 times 
human  exposure.  Strong  pseudo-allergic  reactions  were  observed  in  dogs  at  medium  doses,  secondarily 
causing  cardiovascular  changes,  which  were  considered  dog-specific.  Liver,  kidneys,  stomach,  reproductive 
organs,  thymus,  spleen,  and  lymph  nodes  were  target  organs  of  toxicity  in  Cynomolgus  monkeys  at  more 
than 450 times human exposure. At more than 100 times human exposure, irritation of the stomach was the 
major finding in these monkeys. 
Linagliptin and its main metabolite were not genotoxic.  
Oral  2  year  carcinogenicity  studies  in  rats  and  mice  revealed  no  evidence  of  carcinogenicity  in  rats  or  male 
mice.  A  significantly  higher  incidence  of  malignant  lymphomas  only  in  female  mice  at  the  highest  dose  (> 
200 times human exposure) is not considered relevant for humans (explanation: non-treatment related but 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 27/107 
  
  
due to highly variable background incidence). Based on these studies there is no concern for carcinogenicity 
in humans. 
Linagliptin  crosses  the  placenta  in  rats  and  rabbits.  In  addition,  linagliptin  may  be  excreted  via  milk  with 
milk:plasma ratios up to 4.0 as is observed in rats. 
The  NOAEL  for  fertility,  early  embryonic  development  and  teratogenicity  in  rats  was  set  at  >900  times  the 
human exposure. The NOAEL for maternal-, embryo-fetal-, and offspring toxicity in rats was 49 times human 
exposure. No teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits at >1000 times human exposure. A NOAEL of 78 
times human exposure was derived for embryo-fetal toxicity in rabbits, and for maternal toxicity the NOAEL 
was  2.1  times  human  exposure.  Therefore,  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  linagliptin  affects  reproduction  at 
therapeutic exposures in humans. 
In-vitro and in-vivo studies showed that linagliptin is well tolerated locally.  
Empagliflozin plus linagliptin 
Single dose toxicity 
No  single-dose toxicity  studies  have  been  performed  the  empagliflozin/linagliptin  FDC.  Such  studies  are  not 
needed since available information in rodents showed that the acute toxicity of empagliflozin and linagliptin is 
low.  
Repeated dose toxicity 
The adverse effects of the empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC was studied in a 2-week and 13-week repeated-dose 
toxicity study in rats were tested in clinical relevant dose ratios of 2:1 and 5:1, respectively.  
The  target  organs  of  toxicity  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  are  known.  New  target  organs  of  toxicity  were 
not  identified  for  the  empagliflozin/linagliptin  FDC.  The  NOAEL  was  100/50  mg/kg/day  in  the  2-week  study 
and 100/20 mg/kg/day in the 13-week study. These NOAEL values, respectively, correspond with exposures 
equal  to or  greater  than  10-  times of  the  therapeutic  exposure  to the  individual  compounds  when  using  25 
mg empagliflozin and 5 mg linagliptin as FDC.  
Most  toxicity  at  higher  doses  was  consistent  with  secondary  pharmacology  of  empagliflozin,  but  was 
enhanced by co-administration of linagliptin. The effects were related to urinary glucose loss and electrolyte 
imbalances  and  included  decreased  body  weight  and  body  fat,  increased  food  consumption,  diarrhoea, 
dehydration,  decreased  serum  glucose  and  increases  in  other  serum  parameters  reflective  of  increased 
protein  metabolism  and  gluconeogenesis,  urinary  changes  such  as  polyuria  and  glucosuria,  and  microscopic 
changes  including  mineralisation  in  kidney  and  some  soft  and  vascular  tissues.  Microscopic  evidence  of  the 
effects of exaggerated pharmacology on the kidney observed in some species included tubular dilatation, and 
tubular  and  pelvic  mineralisation  at  approximately  4-times  the  therapeutic  exposure  associated  with  the  25 
mg dose empagliflozin. 
In the 13 week repeat dose toxicity study conducted in rats with the empagliflozin/linagliptin combination, 
there was an increase of urine ketone bodies in the combination group as well as in the group given 
empagliflozin alone as compared to the vehicle control group or the group given linagliptin alone. This 
Assessment report

increase of urine ketone bodies after administration of high dosages (≥300 mg/kg/day) of empagliflozin to 
rats is considered to reflect the metabolic changes due to strong glucose loss and decreased body weight 
gain. A 13 fold safety margin based on exposure ratio was set at the NOEL of 100 mg/kg. 
Test item-related histopathological changes were noted for kidneys, thymus, adrenal glands and pancreas. 
The changes were considered either secondary (kidneys and pancreas) or related to impaired metabolic 
homeostasis (thymus and adrenal glands). Based on increases of hepatic enzyme activities noted after 
repeated administration of 300 mg/kg empagliflozin either alone or in combination with linagliptin, the 
principal target organ identified was the liver.   
Focal areas of hepatocellular necrosis were found in the combination groups at ≥15:30 mg/kg linagliptin: 
empagliflozin (3.8 times the clinical exposure for linagliptin and 7.8 times the clinical exposure for 
empagliflozin) as well as in the group treated with empagliflozin alone at high dose.The incidental nature of 
the focal hepatocellular necrosis observed in the rats given the fixed dose combination could not be 
ascertained and this non-clinical finding has been described under section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Hyperplasia of ovarian stromal interstitial cells observed in the 13-week fixed-dose combination study in rats 
given  ≥100  mg/kg  empagliflozin  with  or  without  linagliptin  was  of  low  severity.  Considering  that  studies 
performed with empagliflozin alone at doses up to 700 mg/kg did not reveal ovarian neoplastic change and 
showed  no  adverse  effect  on  fertility  and  reproductive  organs,  this  finding  is  considered  incidental  of  no 
clinical relevance. 
Genotoxicity 
No  genotoxicity  studies  have  been  conducted  with  the  empagliflozin/linagliptin  FDC.  Individually,  neither 
linagliptin  nor  empagliflozin  was  shown  to  be  genotoxic.  Therefore,  additional  genotoxicity  studies  are 
considered unwarranted. 
Carcinogenicity 
No  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  conducted  with  the  empagliflozin/linagliptin  FDC.  As  the  carcinogenic 
potential  of  each  individual  compound  has  been  fully  characterised  and  because  toxicology  combination 
studies up to 13 weeks did not show evidence for additive toxicity or additional target organs of toxicity, this 
is considered acceptable.  
Reproduction toxicity 
Embryofoetal developmental toxicity studies were previously conducted in the rat and in the rabbit with 
empagliflozin and linagliptin as individual compounds. In the combination embryo-fetal development studies 
in rats, empagliflozin and linagliptin were tested in clinical relevant dose ratios of 2:1 and 5:1. Embryo-fetal 
toxicity was only seen in high dose combination Group 4 (700 mg/kg empagliflozin combined with 140 mg/kg 
linagliptin) as a slightly delayed development secondary to maternal toxicity. Combination effects were 
restricted to reduced terminal body weight. The safety margins calculated from the derived NOAEL (Group 3: 
300 mg/kg empagliflozin combined with 60 mg/kg linagliptin) are 99 times the clinical plasma AUC exposure 
for empagliflozin and 227 times the clinical plasma AUC exposure for linagliptin.

Juvenile toxicity 
The toxicity of the empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC has  not been studied in juvenile animals. This is acceptable 
since the empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC is only indicated for adolescents older than 18 years and adults.  
Toxicokinetic data 
See section 2.3.3. Pharmacokinetics. 
Local tolerance 
The empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC has not been tested for local tolerance. This is acceptable, because the FDC 
is only intended for oral use. 
Other toxicity studies 
The empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC has not been tested for phototoxicity, since there are no indications that the 
individual components have phototoxic potential. 
The  empagliflozin/linagliptin  combination  is  not  considered  to  show  an  immunotoxic  potential  based  on  the 
information  for  each  compound  separately  and  the  absence  of  an  effect  on  the  lymphoid  tissues  in  the  13-
week combination study with empagliflozin/linagliptin in the rat. 
The  combination  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  into  a  single  tablet  has  not  been  associated  with  new 
impurities or degradation products. For this reason, no additional studies on impurities are needed. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Empagliflozin 
In their environmental risk assessment, the applicant indicates that the environmental risk assessment of the 
active ingredient empagliflozin is equal for the product Glyxambi to the ERA for Jardiance 25 mg filmomhulde 
tabletten (registration number: EU/1/14/930).  
Since in both procedures the dosage is equal, and the default Fpen is used for PEC calculations, the result of 
the  ERA  for  Jardiance  is  equal  to  that  of  the  current  fixed-dose  combination  product.  Thus,  the  same 
conclusions apply to the ERA for Glyxambi. 
The evaluation of the ERA for empagliflozin was concluded as follows: 
•  Empagliflozin is considered not to be PBT, nor vPvB. 
•  No risk is identified for the STP, surface water, groundwater and sediment compartment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  package  of  Glyxambi  refers  to  the  non-clinical  studies  conducted  with  the  individual 
components  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  that  each  has  undergone  complete  nonclinical  development 
programs.  These  nonclinical  studies  were  performed  as  part  of  the  marketing  authorization  application  for 
Jardiance  and  Trajenta  to  address  the  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicology  of  these 
substances. 
In support of the application of Glyxambi, bridging studies were performed to support the registration of the 
empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC: 
-  Pharmacodynamic effects of the empagliflozin/linagliptin combination were studied in a rat disease model 
for diabetes. 
-  The effect of empagliflozin on the in vitro metabolism of linagliptin and vice versa was evaluated in human 
hepatocytes. 
-  Combination  toxicity  studies  of  up  to  13  weeks  and  combination  embryo-fetal  development  studies  were 
performed in the Wistar rat. In all combination toxicity studies, empagliflozin and linagliptin were tested in 
clinical  relevant  dose  ratios  of  2:1  and  5:1.  These  rat  studies  were  also  used  for  pharmacokinetic 
investigations of the drug combination. 
New target organs of toxicity were not identified. The NOAEL was 100/50 mg/kg/day in the 2-week study and 
100/20  mg/kg/day  in  the  13-week  study.  These  NOAEL  values,  respectively,  correspond  with  exposures 
equal  to or  greater  than  10-  times of  the  therapeutic  exposure  to the  individual  compounds  when  using  25 
mg  empagliflozin  and  5  mg  linagliptin  as  FDC.  Most  toxicity  at  higher  doses  was  consistent  with  secondary 
pharmacology of empagliflozin, but was enhanced by co-administration of linagliptin. The effects were related 
to  urinary  glucose  loss  and  electrolyte  imbalances  and  included  decreased  body  weight  and  body  fat, 
increased food consumption, diarrhoea, dehydration, decreased serum glucose and increases in other serum 
parameters reflective of increased protein metabolism and gluconeogenesis, urinary changes such as polyuria 
and  glucosuria,  and  microscopic  changes  including  mineralisation  in  kidney  and  some  soft  and  vascular 
tissues.  Microscopic  evidence  of  the  effects  of  exaggerated  pharmacology  on  the  kidney  observed  in  some 
species  included  tubular  dilatation,  and  tubular  and  pelvic  mineralisation  at  approximately  4-times  the 
therapeutic exposure associated with the 25 mg dose empagliflozin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 33/107 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional  pharmacodynamic,  safety  pharmacology  or  pharmacokinetic  studies  were  not  conducted  with  the 
FDC  combination.  This  is  acceptable  and  in  line  with  the  Guideline  on  the  non-clinical  development  of  fixed 
combinations of medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
A  juvenile  toxicity  study  in  rats  with  empagliflozin  has  been  submitted  with  this  application  for  the 
empagliflozin/linagliptin  FDC.  The  results  showed  a  minimal  to  mild  renal  tubular  and  pelvic  dilation  at  100 
mg/kg/day, which approximates 11 times the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg. These findings were  absent 
after a 13 weeks drug-free recovery period. This information has been added to the section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  are  already  used  in  existing  marketed  products  Jardiance  and  Trajenta.  The 
environmental risk assessment of these products does not anticipate a significant increase in environmental 
exposure.  
Since the dosages have not been changed, and the default Fpen is used for  PEC calculations, the results of 
the  environmental  risk  assessments  for  Jardiance  and  Trajenta  can  be  used  for  the  current  fixed-dose 
combination product. Thus, the same conclusions apply to the environmental risk assessment for Glyxambi. 
The  evaluations  of  the  environmental  risk  assessments  for  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  were  concluded  as 
follows: 
• 
• 
Empagliflozin and linagliptin is considered not to be PBT, nor vPvB. 
No risk is identified for the STP, surface water, groundwater and sediment compartment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From non-clinical data, no safety concerns for the empagliflozin/ linagliptin FDC were identified. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
The  Glyxambi  film  coated  tablet  is  a  fixed  dose  combination  tablet  with  two  orally  active  glucose  lowering 
agents for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. Two dose strengths have been developed for the 
empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC: 10 mg/5 mg and 25 mg/5 mg once-daily. 
The  individual  components  of  the  fixed  dose  combination  are  already  licensed  in  the  EU  via  a  centralised 
procedure.  Empagliflozin  is  licensed  as  Jardiance  10  mg  and  25  mg  tablet  (EMEA/H/C/002677/0000)  and 
Linagliptin is licensed as Trajenta 5mg tablet (EMEA/H/C/002110/0000).

The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin and linagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects 
and  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  in  procedures  EMEA/H/C/002677/0000  and  EMEA/H/C/002110/0000.  In 
this  report  the  results  and  conclusions  of  the  pharmacokinetic  studies  submitted  in  these  procedures  are 
shortly summarised. The applicant has submitted two additional pharmacokinetic studies (Study 1245.30 and 
1275.3) for the application of the FDC empagliflozin/ linagliptin these are discussed in detail.

Methodology Study 1245.30 and 1275.3 
The  bioanalytical  methods  for  the  analysis  of  empagliflozin  in  plasma  (method  1217)  and  (method  1216) 
linagliptin  in  plasma  (method  U07-1535)  and  urine  (method  HB-06-038)    are  suitable  and  have  been 
validated  according  to  the  current  standards  and  according  to  the  EMA  guideline  on  bioanalytical  method 
validation. The main characteristics essential to ensure the acceptability of the performance and the reliability 
of the analytical methods have been established. The finally accepted methods and the validation procedures 
were  appropriately  described  with  respect  to  sample  collection,  storage  conditions,  preparation  of  samples, 
standards, QC samples, ISR data and calculations. 
PK  parameters  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  were  calculated  using  non    compartmental  techniques  using 
WinNonlin software. In the BE study1275.3 Cmax and AUC0-72 were analysed as primary parameters and in the 
DDI  study  1245.30  the  steady  state  pharmacokinetic  parameters  Cmax  ss  and  AUCτ,ss  were  determined  as 
primary parameter. In both pharmacokinetic studies the statistical model was an analysis of variance model 
(ANOVA)  on  log-transformed  parameters  including  effects  for  ‘sequence’,  ‘subjects  within  sequences’, 
‘period’, and ‘treatment’. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all other parameters using SASTM (version 
9.2, by SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). 
Absorption and bioavailability 
After  oral  administration  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  are  both  rapidly  absorbed  with  peak  plasma 
concentrations reached at a median tmax of 1.5 hours after dosing. Based on the result of an ADME study with 
empagliflozin it is assumed that about 60% of the dose is absorbed. Linagliptin had an absolute bioavailability 
of approximately 30%. Empagliflozin and linagliptin can both be classified as BCS class 3 drugs.  
The steady state mean plasma AUCtau and Cmax were 1870 nmol*h/L and 259 nmol/L with empagliflozin 10 
once daily treatment and 4740 nmol*h/L and 687 nmol/L with empagloflozin 25 once daily treatment. 
The steady state plasma AUCtau and Cmax concentrations were 153nmol*hr/L and 12.9 nmol/L for linagliptin 
5mg once daily for 7 days.  
Although both active substances can be safely administered with food, a small food effect has been reported 
for empagliflozin and linagliptin. Administration of empagliflozin 25 mg tablet after intake of a high-fat, high-
caloric meal resulted in slightly lower exposure than after its administration without food; AUC decreased by 
about 16% and Cmax by about 37% compared to the fasted condition. A high fat meal had had no influence 
on Linagliptin AUC0-72h but prolonged the t max by 2 hours and lowered Cmax by 15%.  
Bioequivalence study 1275.3 
In study 1275.3 the relative bioavailability of two different FDC tablets containing empagliflozin 25mg and 
linagliptin 5 mg (formulation A1 and A3) in comparison with its mono-components was investigated in 42 
healthy male and female volunteers. In this study the effect of food on the FDC tablets was characterized as 
well.  
The subjects received the following treatments:

The company has analysed the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the FDC A1 tablet (Table 4). Food 
resulted  in  no  change  in  the  overall  exposure  of  empagliflozin  or  linagliptin  and  a  decrease  of  the  peak 
exposure  by  39.0%  and  32.0%  for  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin,  respectively.  These  results  are  in  line  with 
the food effect observed for the mono component tablets and therefore the food effect is not considered to be 
clinically relevant.

bioavailability  of  both  active  substances,  the  results  for  the  primary  pharmacokinetic  parameters  and  the 
median tmax are provided in Table 5. Based on these results it can be concluded that the dissolution rate of 
the  tablet  is  not  relevant  for  the  absorption  and  bioavailability  of  both  active  substances.  Therefore 
dissolution is not considered a rate limiting step for the absorption of the tablet.

Distribution 
Empagliflozin  has  an  apparent  steady-state  volume of  distribution  of  about 73.8  L.  Following  administration 
of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution, the red blood cell partitioning was about 37.0% and plasma protein 
binding was 86.0%. 
After  single  oral  administration  of  5  mg  linagliptin  the  apparent  volume  of  distribution,  Vz/F  was 
approximately  12700  L.  Plasma  protein  binding  of  linagliptin  in  human  plasma  is  concentration-dependent, 
decreasing from 98.8% at 2 nM to 75.0-89.0% at concentrations ≥ 30 nmol/L M. This is probably reflecting 
the saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentrations of linagliptin. As a result, linagliptin shows 
non-linear distribution kinetics. 
Empagliflozin Linagliptin10/5mg FDC 
No Pharmacokinetic studies with the lower empagliflozin/linagliptin dose of 10mg/5mg were performed. 
The  applicant  justified  that  a  bioavailability  study  1275.3  with  the  highest  dose  strength  FDC 
empagliflozin/linagliptin  25/5  tablet  can  be  regarded  as  sufficient  and  can  be  extrapolated  to  FDC 
empagliflozin/linagliptin 10/5 for the following reasons: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
both analytes have been characterised as BCS class 3 drugs. As permeability for those is regarded as the 
rate limiting step for absorption, differences in formulation are not expected to have a major impact on 
bioavailability.  This  was  confirmed  by  the  results  for  the  slow  dissolution  side  batch  included  in  study 
1275.3, which was bioequivalent to the final formulation FDC; 
empagliflozin shows linear pharmacokinetics, which supports waiving the lower FDC strength and the use 
of the highest FDC strength in the relative bioavailability study;  
the dissolution profiles of the 2 FDC strengths are similar for both empagliflozin and linagliptin;  
neither of the 2 drugs can be classified as narrow therapeutic index drugs;  
both FDC strengths were used in the Phase III studies and were found to be both efficacious and safe. 
The  applicant’s  justification  for  not  performing  pharmacokinetic  studies  with  the  lower  empagliflozin/ 
linagliptin  dose  of  10mg/5mg  can  be  accepted,  although  it  should  be  noted  that  the  conditions  for  the 
extrapolation of the conclusions obtained with Study 1275.3 to the 10/5 mg were not strictly fulfilled because 
the  composition  of  the  strengths  is  not  quantitatively  proportional  and  no  comparative  dissolution  profiles 
between the biobatch and the 10/5mg strength at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 have been provided. However, as no 
bridging  study  was  deemed  necessary  for  this  application  and  in  view  of  the  reasons  listed  above,  the 
extrapolation to the 10/5 mg strength is not considered to be an issue.

Elimination 
In humans, unchanged empagliflozin is the most abundant drug-related component in plasma (75.5 - 77.4% 
of  total  radioactivity).  Metabolism  thus  represents  a  minor  elimination  pathway  for  empagliflozin. 
Empagliflozin  biotransformation  primarily  involved  glucuronidation  via  UGT2B7,  UGT1A3,  UGT1A8,  and 
UGT1A9.  Following  administration  of  an  oral  [14C]-empagliflozin  solution  to  healthy  volunteers,  the  drug-
related  radioactivity  was  eliminated  in  faeces  (41.0%)  or  urine  (54.0%).  The  majority  of  drug-related 
radioactivity  recovered  in  faeces  was  unchanged  parent  drug.  Empagliflozin  has  an  apparent  terminal 
elimination half-life of 12.4 hours and apparent oral clearance was 10.6 L/hour. 
After  an  oral  dose  of  5  mg  linagliptin,  plasma  concentrations  decline  in  at  least  a  bi-phasic  manner  with  a 
long  terminal  half-life  (up  to  200  hours).  This  is  assumed  to  be  related to  the  tight  binding  of  linagliptin  to 
DPP-4 and the slow dissociation of the linagliptin-DPP-4 complex. The accumulation half-life of linagliptin, as 
determined  from  accumulation  after  oral  administration of  multiple  doses  of 5  mg  linagliptin,  is  11.4  hours. 
Linagliptin  shows  a  dose–dependent  apparent  total  clearance  at  steady-state.  After  repeated  oral 
administration of a 5 mg dose CL/F,ss is 1120 mL/min and renal clearance was  
70  mL/min.  Metabolism  represents  a  minor  elimination  pathway  for  linagliptin.  In  the  ADME  trial  with  oral 
[14C]-linagliptin  all  metabolites  contributed  to  less  than  10%  of  the  excreted  radioactivity.  In  plasma,  CD 
1790  was  identified  as  major  metabolite  with  16.9%  of  sample  radioactivity  in  pooled  samples  after  oral 
administration.  Other  metabolites  found  in  humans  showed  exposure  levels  well  below  10%  of  linagliptin 
plasma  exposure.  Linagliptin  is  metabolised  mainly  by  CYP3A4.  The  parent  compound  was  mainly  excreted 
unchanged in urine and faeces.  
No additional studies with the FDC were conducted. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Empagliflozin  demonstrates  approximately  linear  pharmacokinetics  and  no  unexpected  accumulation  occurs 
after multiple dosing of empagliflozin. Linagliptin AUCss and Cmax,ss increased less than proportionally with 
dose after multiple dose administration of single tablets with dose strengths of 1 mg, 2.5 mg, and 5 mg. This 
is of minor importance as only the 5 mg tablet is marketed. 
Special populations 
Empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  both  display  similar  pharmacokinetics  between  T2DM  patients  and  healthy 
subjects. This is probably also applicable for the FDC tablet. 
No  dose  adjustment  for  empagliflozin  or  linagliptin  is  required  on  the  basis  of  renal  or  hepatic  impairment, 
BMI, gender, race, or age. 
In  patients  with  mild,  moderate,  severe  renal  impairment,  and  with  kidney  failure/end-stage  renal  disease 
(ESRD), the AUC of empagliflozin was higher by 18.0%, 20.0%, 66.0%, and 48.0% than the corresponding 
AUC value in subjects with normal renal function. Also, population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the 
apparent  oral  clearance  of  empagliflozin  decreased with  a  decrease  in  eGFR,  leading  to  an  increase  in  drug 
exposure. 
In  subjects  with  mild,  moderate,  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  according  to  the  Child-Pugh  classification, 
the  AUC  of  empagliflozin  increased  by  23.0%,  47.0%,  and  75.0%,  while  Cmax  increased  by  4.0%,  23.0%, 
and 48.0%, compared with the corresponding AUC and Cmax values in subjects with normal hepatic function.

Body  mass  index,  gender,  age  had  no  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  empagliflozin 
based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. In this population pharmacokinetic analysis, the AUC value 
for  empagliflozin  was  estimated to  be  13.5%  higher  in  Asian  patients  with  a BMI  of  25  kg/m2  compared  to 
the corresponding AUC value in non-Asian patients with the same BMI. 
The  influence  of  renal  impairment  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  linagliptin  is  only  moderate  for  the  parent 
compound  as  well  as  for  the  main  metabolite.  The  increase  in  exposure  in  severe  renal  impairment  is  less 
than  2-fold  and  the  exposure  in  T2DM  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment  is  comparable  with  “healthy” 
impaired patients.  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  linagliptin  was  only  slightly  influenced  by  reduction  of  the  hepatic  functions.  Only 
exposure  to  the  main  metabolite  was  significantly  reduced,  however,  as  the  elimination  of  linagliptin  by 
metabolism is small (less than 13%), this reduction in exposure is of no clinical relevance. 
In  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  for  linagliptin,  the  influence  of  gender,  weight,  age  (up  to  80 
years) and race was considered of no clinical relevance.  
Studies  characterising  the  pharmacokinetics  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  in  paediatric  patients  have  not 
been performed. 
No  additional  information  on  the  special  populations  is  required  for  the  FDC  tablet,  as  empagliflozin  and 
linagliptin  are  both  well  known  and  approved  medications,  and  the  drug-drug  interaction  study  between 
empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  showed  no  clinically  meaningful  effect  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  PK 
parameters and vice versa. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Drug-drug interaction study 1245.30  
This study investigated the relative bioavailability of multiple doses empagliflozin 50 mg and linagliptin 5 mg 
after  concomitant  administration  compared  to  multiple  doses  of  empagliflozin  50  mg  and  linagliptin  5  mg 
administered alone to 16 healthy male volunteers. This study was an open-label, randomised, multiple dose, 
crossover study. The cross-over design of the DDI study is the recommended design in the guideline on the 
Investigation  of drug Interactions and the more usual for an in vivo interaction study. The open-labelling of 
the study is satisfactory. The choice of a partly fixed sequence design is not fully understood by the assessor 
(probably linked to the very long half-life of linagliptin and the objective of reducing inter-subject variability) 
but does not question the conclusions on the absence of interactions.

The  concentration  of  empagliflozin  50  mg  and  linagliptin  were  determined  in  plasma  an  urine  samples. 
Further DPP-4 inhibition was assessed as a surrogate marker of the effect of linagliptin and glucose excretion 
was analysed the glucose excretion was assessed as a surrogate marker of the effect of empagliflozin. 
The AUCτ,ss of empagliflozin was similar when the drug was given alone and in combination with linagliptin 
but  the  Cmax,ss  of  empafgliflozin  was  reduced  by  approximately  12%  when  the  drug  was  given  with 
linagliptin. Median tmax,ss of empagliflozin was slightly longer when the drug was given with linagliptin (1.5 
h) than when given alone (1.0 h). The urinary secretion of empagliflozin and linagliptin was similar between 
the treatments.

Even if small, the number of subjects enrolled in the study (n=16) is higher than 12 and it is the applicant’s 
responsibility to correctly determine the sample size with the aim to have a sufficient power, reducing its own 
producer’s risk and allowing for drop-outs. The chosen sample size seems finally sufficient to conclude.  
A  35-day  washout  period  between  doses  is  judged sufficient  for  both  drugs  as  this  represents  more  than  5 
times  the  respective  half-lives:  the  effective  half-life  for  accumulation  of  linagliptin  is  12  hours  with  a  long 
terminal  half-life  of  more  than  100  hours.  The  terminal  half-life  of  empagliflozin  was  estimated  to  be  12.4 
hours. Eight subjects had quantifiable linagliptin pre-dose concentrations after multiple oral administration of 
empagliflozin and linagliptin but these concentrations were <5% of the Cmax and were therefore all included 
in the analysis.   
Trough DPP-4 inhibition (E24,ss) was similar when linagliptin was administered with BI 10773 compared with 
linagliptin alone. Empagliflozin alone had no effect on DPP-4 activity (Table 7).

Urinary glucose excretion over 24 h was assessed as a surrogate marker of the effect of Empagliflozin. The 
mean  (±  SD)  cumulative  amount  of  glucose  excreted  in  urine  over  24  h  (Ae0-24)  was  approximately  18% 
lower when BI 10773 was administered with linagliptin (54.8 ± 11.2 g) than when the drug was given alone 
(67.2  ±  14.6  g).  When  linagliptin  was  given  alone,  urinary  glucose  excretion  was  negligible.  The  rate  of 
glucose excretion was also slightly decreased. However the decrease of the urinary glucose does not appear 
to  be  related  to  the  slightly  decreased  Empagliflozin  Cmax,  as  around  tmax,ss  of  Empagliflozin  (1.5  hours) 
the decrease of the urinary glucose excretion rate was similar to other time-intervals.  
The combination of 50 mg Empagliflozin and 5 mg linagliptin q.d. was safe and well tolerated in all patients. 
Therefore  it  can  be  concluded  that  no  significant  interaction  between  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  was 
observed  and  that  the  drugs  can  be  coadministered  without  dose  adjustment  and  there  are  no  additional 
safety concerns expected due to the combination of both drugs. 
Interactions with other drugs 
The potential for interactions with other drugs has been extensively evaluated in the original applications for 
Jardiance  and  Trajenta.  The  overall  potential  for  either  empagliflozin  or  linagliptin  to  be  involved  in 
meaningful  DDIs  is  assessed  to  be  low,  and  is  not  expected  to  be  increased  due  to  combined  use  of  both 
drugs. No additional information is required. 
The  interaction  studies  in  healthy  volunteers  suggest  that  the  pharmacokinetics  of  empagliflozin  were  not 
influenced  by  its  coadministration  with  metformin,  glimepiride,  pioglitazone,  sitagliptin,  linagliptin,  warfarin, 
verapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, torasemide, hydrochlorothiazide, or oral contraceptives. 
Overall exposure (AUC) of empagliflozin increased 1.6-fold following co-administration with gemfibrozil, 1.35-
fold  with  rifampicin,  and  1.5-fold  with  probenecid.  The  observed  increases  in  the  overall  exposure  of 
empagliflozin  were  not  considered  to  be  clinically  significant.  No  dosage  adjustment  of  empagliflozin  is 
recommended  when  it  is  administered  concomitantly  with  gemfibrozil,  rifampicin,  or  probenecid.  Therefore 
interaction  on  the  level  of  the  transporters  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  OATP2B1  and  OAT3  are  considered  not 
clinical relevant. 
Coadministration of  empagliflozin  with  diuretics  may  add  to  the  diuretic  effect  of  thiazide  and loop  diuretics 
and  may  increase  the  risk  of  dehydration  and  hypotension.  Coadministration  of  empagliflozin  with  insulin 
secretagogues (SU) may increase the risk for hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a lower dose of SU may be required 
to  reduce  the  risk  of  hypoglycaemia  when  used  in  combination  with  empagliflozin.  Further  details  can  be 
found in the SmPC of empagliflozin for further details. 
Empagliflozin  had  no  clinically  meaningful  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  metformin,  glimepiride, 
pioglitazone,  sitagliptin,  linagliptin,  warfarin,  digoxin,  ramipril,  simvastatin,  hydrochlorothiazide, torasemide, 
and oral contraceptives when co-administered with any of these drugs.

Interaction studies in healthy volunteers suggest that the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin were not influenced 
by  the  coadministration  of  metformin,  glibenclamide,  simvastatin,  warfarin,  digoxin,  or  oral  contraceptives. 
Coadministration  of  a  single  dose  of  linagliptin  with  multiple  doses  of  ritonavir  resulted  in  a  2-  to  3-fold 
increase in linagliptin AUC and Cmax. Simulations of steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin with and 
without  ritonavir  indicated  that  the  increase  in  exposure  is  not  associated  with  an  increased  accumulation. 
These changes were not considered clinically meaningful.  
Rifampicin was shown to decrease linagliptin exposure. Multiple coadministration of linagliptin with rifampicin 
resulted  in  39.6%  and  43.8%  decreased  linagliptin  steady-state  AUC  and  Cmax  values  and  about  30% 
decreased  DPP-4  inhibition  at  trough.  Thus,  full  efficacy  of  linagliptin  in  combination  with  strong  P-gp 
(permeability glycoprotein) inducers might not be achieved, particularly if these are administered long-term. 
See the SmPC for linagliptin for further details. 
Linagliptin  had  no  clinically  relevant  effect  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  metformin,  glyburide,  pioglitazone, 
warfarin, simvastatin, digoxin or oral contraceptives.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No  new  data  were  submitted  on  pharmacodynamics.  The  clinical  pharmacology  programme  that  supported 
the  original  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  clinical  development  programmes  provides  sufficient  information  to 
support  the  empagliflozin/linagliptin  FDC  programme.  Key  clinical  pharmacology  information  about 
empagliflozin  and  linagliptin,  with  and  without  combination  with  metformin,  are  available  in  the  respective 
product labels. 
Mechanism of action 
Empagliflozin  is  a  potent  and  selective  SGLT-2  inhibitor,  which  is  expressed  in  the  renal  proximal  tubules 
and accounts for approximately 90% of renal glucose reabsorption. Inhibition of SGLT-2 decreases the renal 
reabsorption  of  glucose,  thereby  promoting  glucose  excretion  in  the  urine  with  a  consequent  reduction  in 
blood  glucose  levels.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  empagliflozin  is  independent  of  β-cell  function  and  insulin 
pathways,  which provides a therapeutic advantage compared with other drugs and has  not been associated 
with an increased risk for hypoglycaemia when administered as monotherapy or other antidiabetic therapies 
(other than sulphonylurea±insulin). Further benefits of SGLT-2 inhibition include weight loss and a reduction 
in blood pressure. 
Linagliptin  is  a  selective,  orally  administered,  xanthine-based  DPP-4  inhibitor.  Like  other  DPP-4  inhibitors, 
linagliptin lowers blood glucose by extending the half-life of active glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is 
secreted  in  response  to  a  meal.  Glucagon-like  peptide-1  lowers  blood  glucose  by  augmenting  the  glucose-
stimulated  insulin  release  and  limiting  glucagon  secretion  as  well  as  slowing  gastric  emptying  and  inducing 
satiety.  The  advantages  of  DPP-4  inhibitors  over  other  established  antidiabetic  medications  include  the  low 
risk  of  hypoglycaemia.  The  activity  of  GLP-1  ceases  when  plasma  glucose  concentration  falls  below  3.1 
mmol/l (55 mg/d).

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In  patients  with  type  2  diabetes,  urinary  glucose  excretion  increased  immediately  and  in  a  dose-dependent 
manner  following  administration  of  multiple  empagliflozin  doses  over  the  24-h  dosing  interval.  It  was 
maintained at the end of a 4-week treatment period; it was about 64.0 grams/day with empa 10 treatment 
and 78.0 grams/day with empa 25 treatment. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate 
reduction in plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Linagliptin binds to DPP-4 in a reversible manner and thus leads to a sustained increase and prolongation of 
active  incretin  hormone  levels.  Linagliptin  increases  insulin  secretion  and  lowers  glucagon  secretion  in  a 
glucose-dependent  manner,  thus  resulting  in  a  better  regulation  of  the  glucose  homeostasis.  It  binds 
selectively to DPP-4 and selectively inhibits DPP-4 and exhibits a >10000-fold selectivity vs. DPP-8 or DPP-9 
activity in vitro at concentrations close to therapeutic exposures. 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  empagliflozin  is  independent  of  the  insulin  pathway  and  β-cell  function. 
Therefore,  it  is  different  from  and  complementary  to  the  mechanisms  of  other  currently  available  type  2 
diabetes  medications.  In  the  Phase  I  study  1245.30,  an  increased  urinary  glucose  excretion  was  observed 
both  after  the  administration  of  empagliflozin  alone  and  in  combination  with  linagliptin,  consistent  with  the 
mode of action of empagliflozin. Trough DPP-4 inhibition was similar when linagliptin was administered alone 
or  with  empagliflozin.  Administration  of  empagliflozin  alone  had  no  effect  on  DPP-4  activity.  Following  the 
administration  of  multiple  oral  doses  of  empa  50,  the  urinary  glucose  excretion  of  empagliflozin  at  steady-
state  (reached  by  Day  5)  was  not  affected  by  the  coadministration  of  linagliptin.  The  mean  fraction  of  the 
excreted empagliflozin dose was similar when given alone and when coadministered (~21.0%). Following the 
administration of multiple oral doses of linagliptin, the urinary glucose excretion of linagliptin at steady-state 
(reached  by  Day  7)  was  not  affected  by  the  coadministration  of  empagliflozin.  The  mean  fraction  of  the 
excreted dose was similar when linagliptin was given alone and when it was coadministered (~5.0%). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  applicant  conducted  two  pharmacokinetic  studies  to  bridge  the  pharmacokinetic  data  of  the 
monocomponents to the FDC tablets. These studies were properly designed and appropriate bioanalytical and 
statistical methods have been used.  
Study  1275.3  shows  bioequivalence  between  the  fixed  dose  combination  Empagliflozin/linagliptin  tablet 
(25mg/5mg  FDC  tablets)  and  the  individual  components.  The  effect  of  food  on  the  FDC  tablets  was 
characterized as well; the food effect on Empagliflozin /linagliptin 25mg/5mg FDC tablets was similar to that 
for the monotherapy products. The applicant adequately justified that the results of the bioavailability study 
1275.3  with  the  highest  dose  strength  FDC  empagliflozin/linagliptin  25/5  tablet  can be  extrapolated  to FDC 
empagliflozin/linagliptin 10/5. 
In study 1245.30 no significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between empagliflozin and 
linagliptin  was  observed  and  the  combination  of  the  medicinal  products  was  well  tolerated.  Furthermore, 
based  on  the  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  and  the  results  of  previously 
conducted drug interaction studies the overall interaction potential of the fixed dose combination is assessed 
to  be  low.  Based  on  this  interaction  study  can  be  concluded  that  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  can  be 
coadministered  without  dose  adjustment  and  there  are  no  additional  safety  concerns  expected  due  to  the 
combination of both drugs.

No  new  studies  were  performed  on  pharmacodynamics.  Key  clinical  pharmacology  information  about 
empagliflozin  and  linagliptin,  with  and  without  combination  with  metformin,  are  available  in  the  respective 
product labels. 
For  the  empagliflozin/linagliptin  FDC,  effects  on  HbA1c  and  weight  were  shown  in  the  clinical  phase  3  trials 
(see Clinical Efficacy). 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  empagliflozin/linagliptin  FDC  is  sufficiently  characterised.  No  additional  studies  of 
pharmacokinetic studies are considered necessary for this application. 
No  new  studies  were  performed  on  pharmacodynamics.  Key  clinical  pharmacology  information  about 
empagliflozin  and  linagliptin,  with  and  without  combination  with  metformin,  are  available  in  the  respective 
product labels.

Not applicable 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
The  clinical  development  programme  for  the  FDC  empa/lina  comprised  2  Phase  I  studies  in  healthy 
volunteers (1275.3 and 1245.30) and 3 Phase III pivotal studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 1 
factorial design study (1275.1) and 2 add-on studies (1275.9 and 1275.10).  
Phase I studies 
Two phase I studies were conducted analysing the combined administration of empagliflozin and linagliptin: 
the  drug-drug  interaction  study  1245.30  and  the  relative  bioavailability  study  1275.3.  Study  1245.30 
investigated  the  effect  of  combined  administration  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin;  it  showed  no  clinically 
relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug and concluded that empagliflozin and linagliptn can be 
coadministered  without  any  dose  adjustment.  Study  1275.3  established  the  bioequivalence  of  the  FDC  and 
the  individual  components.  Studies  1245.30  and  1275.3  were  previously  included  in  the  dossier  of  the 
empagliflozin development programme.  
Phase III studies  
Study 1275.9 was an add-on study that investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of empagliflozin as 
add-on therapy to the DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin and metformin. Patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate 
glycaemic  control  despite  metformin  background  therapy  underwent  an  initial  16-week  period  of  open-label 
treatment  with  linagliptin  5  mg.  Patients  who  met  the  inclusion  criterion  of  HbA1c  values  between  7.0  and 
10.5%  after  16  weeks  of  open-label  linagliptin  therapy  on  a  metformin  background  were  eligible  for 
randomisation into the 24-week double-blind period into 3 groups, following an additional 1-week open-label

placebo run-in period: empa 25 (given as FDC empa 25/lina 5), empa 10 (given as FDC empa 10/lina 5), and 
placebo (given in addition to lina 5). All patients continued treatment with metformin throughout the double-
blind treatment period. 
Study 1275.10 was  an  add-on  study  that  investigated the  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  of linagliptin  as 
add-on  therapy  to  the  SGLT-2  inhibitor  empagliflozin  and  metformin.  Patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus 
and  inadequate  glycaemic  control  despite  metformin  background  therapy  were  randomised  to  an  initial  16-
week  open-label  treatment  period  with  empagliflozin  25  mg  or  empagliflozin  10  mg.  Patients  who  met  the 
inclusion  criterion  of  HbA1c  values  between  7.0  and  10.5%  after  16  weeks  of  open-label  empagliflozin 
therapy on a metformin background were eligible for randomisation into 1 of 2 possible treatment groups in 
the 24-week double-blind period of each open-label patient population, following an additional 1-week open-
label placebo run-in period: lina 5 (given as FDC empa 25/lina 5 or FDC empa 10/lina 5) or placebo (given in 
addition  to  empa  25  or  empa  10).  All  patients  continued  treatment  with  metformin  throughout  the  double-
blind period.  
Study  1275.1  was  a  factorial  design  study  conducted  according  to  the  FDA  guideline  on  FDCs    in  patients 
with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  insufficient  glycaemic  control  despite  diet  and  exercise.  The  study 
population  1275.1(met)  included  patients  with  a  metformin  background  therapy  and  the  study  population 
1275.1(naïve)  included  patients  with  no  prior  antidiabetic  medication.  In  each  population,  after  a  2-week 
placebo  run-in  period,  patients  were  randomised  into  5  treatment  groups:  FDC  empa  25/lina  5,  FDC  empa 
10/lina 5, empa 25, empa 10, and lina 5. The superiority of each FDC in terms of reducing HbA1c levels was 
tested against its respective individual components after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment independently in 
each study population (primary endpoint). Efficacy and safety were evaluated over the entire 52-week study 
period. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
All  Phase  III  studies  included  male  and  female patients  with type  2  diabetes mellitus,  insufficient  glycaemic 
control despite diet and exercise counselling, a BMI of 45 kg/m2 or below, who were at least 18 years old. All 
patients  in  studies  1275.9,  1275.10,  and  1275.1(met)  were  taking  metformin  as  background  medication. 
Patients were to take an unchanged dose of ≥ 1500 mg/day (or maximum tolerated dose, or maximum dose 
as  per  local  label) of  immediate  release  metformin  for  at  least  12  weeks  prior  to  screening  (studies 1275.9 
and 1275.10) or randomisation (study 1275.1(met)) and to continue at this dose throughout the duration of 
the  study.  No  other  prior antidiabetic  medications  were  allowed  within  12  weeks  prior  to  screening  (studies 
1275.9  and  1275.10)  or  randomisation  (1275.1(met)).  Study  1275.1(naïve)  included  patients  without  prior 
antidiabetic treatment for 12 weeks prior to randomisation.

Objectives 
Study 1275.9 
The  objective  of  this  trial  was  to  investigate  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  empagliflozin  25  mg 
(empa 25) and empagliflozin 10 mg (empa 10) compared with placebo, each administered as add-on therapy 
to linagliptin 5 mg (lina 5) and metformin, over 24 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 47/107 
  
  
Study 1275.10  
The  objective  of  this  trial was  to  investigate  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  linagliptin  5  mg  (lina  5) 
compared with placebo, each administered as add-on therapy to empagliflozin (25 mg [empa 25] or 10 mg 
[empa 10]) and metformin, over 24 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). 
Study 1275.1 
The  objective  of  the  study  was  to  investigate  the  efficacy,  safety,  and  tolerability  of  the  fixed-dose 
combination (FDC) empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg and of the FDC empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg 
compared  with  the  individual  components  (empagliflozin  25  mg or  10  mg,  and  linagliptin  5  mg)  given once 
daily  (q.d.)  for  52  weeks  in  treatment  naïve  and  metformin-treated  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus 
with insufficient glycaemic control.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in all studies was the change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 
after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment.  
Secondary  end  points  after  24  weeks  of  double-blind  treatment  were  the  change  from  baseline  in  fasting 
plasma glucose (FPG), body weight and blood pressure, and the proportion of patients with HbA1c<7.0%. 
Sample size, Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The sample size estimations, randomisation procedures and blinding procedures are considered adequate.  
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis in studies 1275.9 and 1275.10 was performed on the full analysis set (FAS), consisting 
of all patients treated with at least one dose of study drug during the double-blind part of the trials who had 
a baseline HbA1c assessment and at least one on-treatment HbA1c assessment during the double-blind part 
of the trial. An observed case (OC) approach was used for the main analyses of the primary, key secondary, 
and most of the further efficacy endpoints. Missing data were not directly imputed prior to analysis and were 
handled  implicitly  by  the  statistical  model  used.  The  primary  analysis  used  a  restricted  maximum  likelihood 
(REML)-based  MMRM  approach  on  the  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  (in  units  of  %)  after  24  weeks  of 
double-blind  treatment.  The  statistical  approach  modelled  the  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  at  each  on-
treatment  visit,  and  included  fixed  classification  effects  for  treatment,  region,  baseline  renal  function,  visit, 
and  treatment-by-visit  interaction,  and  a  linear  covariate  for  baseline  HbA1c.  An  unstructured  covariance 
approach  was  used  to  model  the  within-patient  errors.  The  differences  between  treatment  groups  were 
presented  with  a  two-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  and  the  p-value  of  the  hypothesis  tests.  The 
superiority of empagliflozin as add-on to linagliptin and metformin (study 1275.9) or linagliptin as add-on to 
empagliflozin  and  metformin  (study  1275.10)  was  tested  against  placebo  using  a  hierarchical  testing 
procedure  which  allowed  each  individual  hypothesis  test  to  be  performed  at  a  two-sided  α  =  0.05  level  of 
significance, whilst controlling the overall probability of a type I error at 0.05 (two-sided). 
In study 1275.1, the primary analysis was an ANCOVA on the FAS, including treatment, region, and baseline 
renal  function  as  fixed  effects  and  baseline  HbA1c  as  a  linear  covariate.  For  handling  missing  data,  a  last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used in the main analyses of the primary and most of the 
key  secondary  and  further  endpoints.  Missing  values  within  a  course  of  measurements  on  treatment  were 
interpolated based on the last observed value before the missing visit and the first observed value after the 
missing  visit.  Baseline  values  were  carried  forward  if  there  was  no  post-baseline  value  available.  Values

measured after a patient had taken rescue medication were excluded and imputed using the LOCF method. 
The  superiority  of  the  FDCs  to  their  individual  components  was  tested  separately  in  the  metformin-treated 
and  in  the  treatment-naïve  populations.  Within  each  FDC  dose  level,  there  were  2  hypotheses  which 
evaluated whether the FDC was superior to the 2 individual components on the primary endpoint and these 
were tested simultaneously at a two-sided α = 0.05 level of significance. Only if both null hypotheses at the 
higher  FDC  dose  level  were  rejected,  were  the  hypotheses  at  the  lower  FDC  dose  level  tested,  thereby 
controlling the overall probability of a type I error at 0.05 (two-sided). 
Sensitivity analyses with alternative methods of accounting for missing data and rescue medication use were 
performed in order to assess the robustness of the primary and key secondary analysis results. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In  the  Phase  III  studies,  733  patients  received  combined  therapy  on  a  metformin  background  and  most  of 
them  (>90.0%  in  each  study)  completed  24  weeks  of  double-blind  treatment.  In  the  factorial  design  study 
1275.1,  at  the  time  of  the  primary  endpoint  analysis  of  24 weeks,  over  90.0%  of  the  patients  continued  in 
the study and over 84.0% of the patients completed the 52-week treatment period. In general there were no 
relevant  differences  in  the  proportions  of  patients  with  premature  discontinuation  across  treatment  groups. 
The  most  common  reasons  for  premature  discontinuations  were  patients  being  lost  to  follow-up  and  the 
occurrence of adverse events (each ≤3.5% in each study).  
Recruitment 
Dates of recruitment and follow-up for the respective trials were as follows :  
Study 1275.1: 31 August 2011 - 10 September 2013 
Study 1275.9:   01 Mar 2013 - 23 Mar 2015 
Study 1275.10: 13 Feb 2013 - 30 Mar 2015 
Conduct of the study 
A routine GCP inspection was performed for the clinical study: 1275.1.  Three sites [2 investigator sites – one 
in Spain and one in the US) and the sponsor site in the US] between 25 January 2016 – 08 April 2016.  The 
summary report of the inspection carried out was issued on 09 May 2016.  The conclusion of the inspection 
was  that  data  quality  is  acceptable  and  the  trial  has  been  conducted  following  GCP  and  ethical  standards. 
Data  quality  was  found  to  be  acceptable  and  the  trial  has  been  conducted  following  GCP  and  ethical 
standards. 
Baseline data 
Except  for  race  and  region,  the  overall  demographic  characteristics  were  generally  similar  across  trials  and 
treatment  groups.  Study  1275.9  included  patients  from  all  races  across  most  regions  (except  Africa),  with 
almost  two  thirds  of  patients  being  White  and  a  quarter  Asian.  In  study  1275.10,  more  than  95.0%  of  the 
patients  were  White  and  from  Europe;  there  were  no  patients  from  Asia  or  Africa.  In  study1275.1,  almost 
three  quarters  of  patients  were  White  and  mainly  from  North  America,  but  there  were  also  some  patients 
from all other races and regions.

About half of the patients in each study were male. The mean age in each study was about 55 years. About 
80.0% of the patients were younger than 65 years at baseline, and only about 2.0% were 75 years of age or 
older.  Most  patients  were  obese  based  on  their  BMI  (body  mass  index)  value.  Based  on  eGFR  (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate) values at baseline, calculated using the MDRD formula, most of the patients (about 
97.0%) had either normal renal function (more than 40.0% of patients) or mild renal impairment (about half 
of  patients)  at  baseline.  Moderate or  severe  renal impairment  (eGFR<60  mL/min/1.73m2)  was  an  exclusion 
criterion in all Phase III studies because of the metformin add-on therapy. About one third (in each of the 2 
given  categories)  of  the  patients  in  each  study  had  been  diagnosed  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  for  either 
>1 to 5 years or >5 to 10 years, one quarter of patients had had type 2 diabetes mellitus for >10 years, and 
less than 10.0% of patients had been diagnosed for 1 year or less.  
Mean baseline HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values were generally similar across treatments and 
trials. The overall mean baseline value for HbA1c was 8.0%, with three quarters of patients having an HbA1c 
of below 8.5% at baseline. A summary of the main baseline characteristics is presented in Table 8.

Analysis population 
and time point 
description 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients randomised and treated with 
at least one dose of study drug during the double-blind part of the trial who 
had a baseline HbA1c assessment and at least one on-treatment HbA1c 
assessment during the double-blind period. An observed cases (OC) 
approach was used. All available data were analysed as observed, missing 
data were not directly imputed prior to analysis and were handled implicitly 
by the statistical model used (mixed model repeated measures [MMRM]). 
Further, all values observed after a patient started rescue medication were 
excluded. 
Confirmatory tests for the superiority of empagliflozin add-on to linagliptin 
and metformin vs. placebo for the primary and key secondary endpoints 
followed a hierarchical testing procedure that allowed each test to be done 
at a two-sided alpha = 0.05 level of significance, whilst controlling the 
overall probability of a type I error at 0.05 (two-sided). The procedure 
started with the primary endpoint and first tested for significance of the 
higher empagliflozin dose; it was to proceed to the lower empagliflozin dose 
only if statistical significance had been proven for the higher dose. The 
2 key secondary endpoints were to be subsequently tested in a pre-defined 
order (see results below).

Treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg or empagliflozin 10 mg resulted in 
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in HbA1c, 
FPG, and body weight compared with placebo as add-on treatment to 
linagliptin 5 mg and metformin after 24 weeks of treatment in patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus having met the HbA1c criterion (HbA1c ≥7.0% and 
≤10.5%) after 16 weeks of open-label treatment with linagliptin 5 mg and 
metformin. The robustness of the primary analysis was confirmed over a 
number of sensitivity analyses investigating the influence of use of rescue 
medication, protocol violations, and premature discontinuations. Subgroup 
analyses supported the consistency of the primary and key secondary 
efficacy results across a wide range of subpopulations.  
<0.0001 
The proportion of patients reaching target levels of HbA1c<7% after 24 
weeks of treatment, which was a further endpoint in this study, was higher 
after empagliflozin (25 mg and 10 mg) treatment than after placebo 
treatment. For the further endpoints systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
clinically relevant reductions were seen in both empagliflozin dose groups 
from baseline to Week 24. 
Title: A phase III, randomised, double-blind, parallel group study to evaluate efficacy and safety of 
linagliptin 5 mg compared to placebo, administered as oral fixed dose combinations with 
empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg for 24 weeks, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and insufficient 
glycaemic control after 16 weeks treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg once daily on 
metformin background therapy.

Design 
This was a randomised, double-blind, parallel group comparison study. 
Patients were recruited and randomised at a 1:1 ratio to treatment with 
linagliptin 5 mg (lina 5) or placebo, each as add-on therapy to 
empagliflozin 25 mg (empa 25) and metformin (study population 
1275.10(met+empa25)) or empagliflozin 10 mg (empa 10) and metformin (study 
population 1275.10 (met+empa10)). Randomisation was stratified by baseline 
HbA1c, renal function, and geographical region. The main objective of the trial 
was to investigate the efficacy and safety of lina 5 compared with placebo, as 
add-on to empa (25 or 10) and metformin, administered once daily for 
24 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and insufficient glycaemic 
control after the preceding 16 weeks of open-label treatment with 
empagliflozin and metformin. 
Duration of main phase: 
Duration of Run-in phase: 
16 weeks open-label active treatment,  
24 weeks double-blind randomised treatment, 
1 week follow-up period

Primary Analysis 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients randomised and treated with 
at least one dose of study drug during the double-blind part of the trial who 
had a baseline HbA1c assessment and at least one on-treatment HbA1c 
assessment during the double-blind period. An observed cases (OC) 
approach was used. All available data were analysed as observed, missing 
data were not directly imputed prior to analysis and were handled implicitly 
by the statistical model used (mixed model repeated measures [MMRM]). 
Further, all values observed after a patient started rescue medication were 
excluded. 
Confirmatory tests for the superiority of lina 5 add-on to empa 25 and 
metformin vs. placebo for the primary and key secondary endpoints 
followed a hierarchical testing procedure that allowed each test to be done 
at a two-sided alpha = 0.05 level of significance, whilst controlling the 
overall probability of a type I error at 0.05 (two-sided). The procedure 
started with the primary endpoint and continued with the key secondary 
endpoint.

Treatment with linagliptin 5 mg resulted in clinically meaningful reductions 
in HbA1c and FPG when administered as add-on treatment to empagliflozin 
25 mg or empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin after 24 weeks of treatment in 
patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus having met the HbA1c inclusion 
criterion (HbA1c: ≥7.0% and ≤10.5%) after 16 weeks of open-label 
treatment with either empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin or empagliflozin 
10 mg and metformin. The placebo-adjusted treatment differences in HbA1c 
and FPG after 24 weeks of treatment with linagliptin 5 mg administered as 
add-on therapy to empagliflozin and metformin were statistically significant. 
The robustness of the primary analysis was confirmed over a number of 
sensitivity analyses investigating the influence of use of rescue medication, 
protocol violations, and premature discontinuations. Subgroup analyses 
supported the consistency of the primary and key secondary efficacy results 
across a wide range of subpopulations. 
The proportion of patients reaching target levels of HbA1c<7% after 24 
weeks of treatment, which was a further endpoint in this study, was higher 
after treatment with linagliptin 5 mg than with placebo. Reductions vs. 
placebo in body weight and blood pressure (further endpoints) were not 
noticed with linagliptin 5 mg treatment in the double-blind treatment period, 
but occured during the initial open-label treatment period with 
empagliflozin, consistent with the mode of action of the two compounds.

This was a 52-week randomised, double-blind, parallel group comparison study. 
Patients were recruited and randomised at a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to FDC empa 25/lina 5, 
FDC empa 10/ lina 5, empa 25, empa 10, or lina 5. Randomisation was stratified by 
screening HbA1c, renal function at screening, and geographical region. The main 
objective of the trial was to investigate the efficacy (superiority testing), safety, and 
tolerability of the 2 FDCs vs. their individual components given as tablets once daily 
for 52 weeks in metformin-treated (study population 1275.1(met)) or drug-naïve 
patients (study population 1275.1(naïve)) with type 2 diabetes mellitus and insufficient 
glycaemic control. The primary efficacy analysis was done after 24 weeks of 
treatment.

The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients treated with at least one 
dose of study drug during the double-blind part of the trial who had a 
baseline HbA1c assessment and at least one on-treatment HbA1c 
assessment during the double-blind period.  
Descriptive statistics 
and estimate 
variability 
An ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) with a last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) approach was used for the main analyses, excluding 
values after rescue medication. Confirmatory testing of the superiority of 
the FDCs vs. their individual components was done separately in each 
patient population. Within each FDC dose level in study population 
1275.1(met), 2 hypotheses evaluating whether the FDC was superior to the 
2 individual components on the primary endpoint were tested 
simultaneously at a two-sided alfa = 0.05 level of significance. Only if both 
null hypotheses at the higher FDC dose level were rejected, were the 
hypotheses at the lower FDC dose level to be tested, thereby controlling 
the overall probability of a type I error at 0.05 (two-sided). The 3 key 
secondary endpoints were to be subsequently tested in a pre-defined order 
(see results below). For the third key secondary endpoint, logistic 
regression was used, on the FAS (NCF, non-completers considered failure). 
Upon a health authority request, an observed cases (OC) approach was 
also used. All available data were analysed as observed, missing data were 
not directly imputed prior to analysis and were handled implicitly by the 
statistical model used (mixed model repeated measures [MMRM]). Further, 
all values observed after a patient started rescue medication were 
excluded.

Notes 
Treatment with the FDCs empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg and 
empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg in patients with metformin 
background medication led to clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c 
with statistically significant differences vs. empagliflozin 25 mg or 10 mg 
and linagliptin 5 mg after 24 weeks of treatment. Statistically significant 
and clinically meaningful differences were observed with both FDCs for the 
change from baseline in FPG, body weight (comparison vs. linagliptin 5 mg 
only), and for the treat-to-target efficacyresponse (patients with 
HbA1c<7.0% among those with HbA1c≥7.0%) after 24 weeks of 
treatment. A number of sensitivity and subgroup analyses provided 
consistent results with the primary analyses.  
Further exploratory endpoints also indicated clinically relevant 
improvements with the FDCs vs. the individual components. A higher 
proportion of patients treated with the FDcs than with the individual 
components reached target HbA1c levels of <6.5% or had an HbA1c 
reduction of at least 0.5% after 24 weeks of treatment.  
Clinically meaningful reductions in blood pressure were noted for both 
FDCs; relevant differences to the linagliptin 5 mg group were shown. 
Reductions in waist circumference in the FDC and empagliflozin treatment 
groups were consistent with the observed reduction in body weight after 
24 weeks of treatment. The proportions of patients who required rescue 
medication on-treatment was low in all groups. 
The clinically revelant improvements in parameters of glycaemic control 
with FDC treatment were maintained over the entire 52-week treatment 
period.  
Effects on HbA1c 
In the Phase III trials, the primary endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of double-
blind treatment.  
Empagliflozin add-on to linagliptin (study 1275.9) 
The  confirmatory  analyses  conducted  on  trial  level  showed  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful 
reductions  in  HbA1c  compared  with  placebo  after  24 weeks  of  double-blind  treatment  for  each  dose  of 
empagliflozin add-on to linagliptin and metformin (Table 9).

Fixed dose combination of empagliflozin/linagliptin compared with empagliflozin or linagliptin (study 1275.1) 
Treatment  with  the  2  dose  combinations  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  on  a  metformin  background  in  the 
factorial  design  study  1275.1 (met)  led  to  reductions  in  HbA1c  after  24  weeks  of  double-blind  treatment.  The 
primary  analysis  using  an  ANCOVA  model  on  the  FAS  (LOCF)  confirmed  that  each  FDC  was  superior  to 
empagliflozin (corresponding dose) and linagliptin in terms of change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks. 
Treatment with the 2 dose combinations of empagliflozin and linagliptin in drug-naïve patients in the factorial 
design  study  1275.1(naïve)  also  resulted  in  clinically  relevant  reductions  in  HbA1c  after  24  weeks  of  double-
blind treatment, of about -1.1%. The FDC empa 25/lina 5 was statistically superior to lina 5 treatment, but 
not to empa 25 treatment (Table 11).

Categorical efficacy responses: proportions of patients achieving HbA1c values below 7.0% 
In  study  1275.9,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved  HbA1c  <7%  was  about  2-fold  higher  with 
empagliflozin treatment (25 mg: 32.7% and 10 mg: 37.0%) than with placebo (17.0%) add-on to linagliptin 
and metformin.

In  study  1275.10,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved  HbA1c  <7%  was  more  than  2-fold  higher  with 
linagliptin treatment than with placebo: 36.0% for lina 5 add-on to empa 25 and metformin and 15.0% for 
placebo; 25.9% for lina 5 add-on to empa 10 and metformin and 10.9% for placebo.  
The  proportion  of  patients  achieving  HbA1c  values  of  less  than  7%  after  24  weeks  was  a  key  secondary 
endpoint in study 1275.1 (met). It was tested in the last step of the hierarchical confirmatory testing sequence. 
The proportion of patients who achieved the HbA1c goal was higher with FDC treatment (high dose: 61.8%, 
low  dose:  57.8%)  than  with  the  corresponding  individual  components  (empa 25:  32.6%,  empa  10:  28.0%, 
lina 5: 36.1%). Treat-to target response analyses after 52 weeks of treatment were consistent with those of 
Week 24. 
Effects on fasting plasma glucose 
The change from baseline in FPG was a key secondary endpoint in all Phase III trials. In general, the results 
for changes in FPG were consistent with the results for the changes in HbA1c.  
In  study  1275.9,  treatment  with  empagliflozin  (25  mg  and  10  mg)  add-on  to  linagliptin  and  metformin 
resulted in statistically significant reductions in FPG after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo, with 
placebo-adjusted  mean  treatment  differences  of  -2.09 (SE  0.26)  mmol/L  for  empa  25  and  -1.80  (SE  0.26) 
mmol/L for empa 10. 
In  study  1275.10,  treatment  with  linagliptin  add-on  to  empagliflozin  (25  mg  or  10  mg)  and  metformin 
resulted in statistically significant reductions in FPG after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo, with 
placebo-adjusted mean treatment differences of -0.44 (SE 0.22) mmol/L for lina 5 add-on to empa 25 and -
0.65 (SE 0.25) mmol/L for lina 5 add-on to empa 10. 
In  study  1275.1 (met),  both  FDCs  provided  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  reductions  in  FPG 
compared with their individual components. For the FDC empa 25/lina 5, the FPG adjusted mean difference 
was -0.91 (SE 0.20) mmol/L vs. empa 25 and -1.23 (SE 0.20) mmol/L vs. lina 5. For the FDC empa 10/lina 
5, the FPG adjusted mean difference was -0.63 (SE 0.20) mmol/L vs. empa 10 and -1.06 (SE 0.20) mmol/L 
vs. lina 5. 
Effects on body weight 
In  study  1275.9,  treatment  with  empagliflozin  add-on  to  linagliptin  and  metformin  resulted  in  statistically 
significant body weight reductions vs. placebo, with placebo-adjusted mean treatment differences of -2.2 (SE 
0.4) kg for empa 25 and -2.8 (SE 0.4) kg for empa 10. 
In study 1275.10, treatment with linagliptin add-on to empagliflozin and metformin did not result in clinically 
relevant changes in body weight after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. Based on the mode of 
action of linagliptin, a body weight change was not expected. 
In  study  1275.1 (met),  the  change  from  baseline  in  body  weight  after  24  weeks  of  treatment  was  a  key 
secondary endpoint. Overall, there was a mean body weight change from baseline of -3.0 (SE 0.3) kg for FDC 
empa 25/lina 5 and of -2.6 (SE 0.3) kg for FDC empa 10/lina 5. The analyses showed statistically significant 
differences for each FDC empa/lina compared with lina 5 treatment, of -2.3 (SE 0.4) kg for the higher dose 
and  -1.9  (SE  0.4)  kg  for  the  lower  dose.  There  was  no  treatment  difference  between  the  FDCs  and 
empagliflozin treatment.

Effects on blood pressure 
In study 1275.9, empagliflozin add-on to linagliptin and metformin provided clinically meaningful reductions 
in  systolic  blood  pressure  after  24 weeks  of  treatment  compared  with  placebo,  with  placebo-adjusted  mean 
changes of -2.6 (SE 1.5) mmHg for empa 25 treatment and -1.3 (SE 1.5) mmHg for empa 10 treatment. A 
clinically relevant reduction in diastolic blood pressure was also observed for patients treated with empa 25, 
with a placebo-adjusted mean change of -1.1 (SE 1.1) mmHg; however, there was no reduction in diastolic 
blood  pressure  for  patients  treated  with  empa  10;  the  placebo-adjusted  mean  change  for  this  group  of 
patients was -0.1 (SE 1.1) mmHg.  
In  study  1275.10,  linagliptin  add-on  to  empagliflozin  (25  mg  and  10  mg)  and  metformin  provided  no 
reductions in systolic or diastolic blood pressure after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. Based 
on  the  mechanism  of  action  of  linagliptin,  a  reduction  in  blood  pressure  during  the  double-blind  treatment 
period was not expected with linagliptin treatment. 
In  study  1275.1 (met),  there  were  similar,  clinically meaningful  reductions  in  both  systolic  and  diastolic  blood 
pressure in the FDC and empagliflozin groups, ranging from -5.9 (SE 1.0) mmHg to -4.2  (SE 1.0) mmHg for 
systolic  blood  pressure  and  from  -3.4  (0.6)  mmHg  to  -2.5  (0.7)  mmHg  for  diastolic  blood  pressure.  Blood 
pressure reduction was minimal with linagliptin treatment. 
Use of rescue therapy 
In  study  1275.9,  the  proportions  of  patients  needing  rescue  therapy  during  the  24 weeks  of  double-blind 
treatment with empagliflozin (25 mg or 10 mg) add-on to linagliptin and metformin was 3 times lower in the 
empagliflozin  treatment  groups  (around  5.0%  of  patients  requiring  rescue  medication)  than  in  the  placebo 
group  (around  15.0% of  patients).  In  study  1275.10,  a  lower  proportion  of  patients  needed  rescue  therapy 
when treated with linagliptin add-on to empagliflozin (25 mg or 10 mg) and metformin (0% and 1.6%) than 
when  treated  with  placebo  (2.7%  and  4.0%).  In  study  1275.1(met),  1  (0.7%)  to  6  (4.3%)  patients  per 
treatment  group  required  rescue  therapy  after  24  weeks  of  treatment,  without  a  clear  trend  in  differences 
between groups.  In study 1275.1(naive), 1 (0.7%) to 11 (8.3%) patients per treatment group required the 
use  of  rescue  therapy.  The  linagliptin  monotherapy  group  had  the  highest  number  of  patients  requiring 
rescue therapy (8.3%). 
Efficacy in subpopulations 
Subgroup  analyses  were  done  to  investigate  the  consistency  of  the  treatment  effect  on  HbA1c  across 
subpopulations.  Subgroup  analyses  for  efficacy  were  conducted  at  study  level  on  data  from  the  24-week 
double-blind  period  of  the  Phase  III  trials.  An  interaction  p-value  of  <0.1  was  considered  to  indicate  a 
potential treatment-by-subgroup interaction.  
Reductions from baseline in HbA1c were observed throughout Phase III studies for all subgroup analyses, with 
a trend towards larger treatment effects in patients with higher baseline HbA1c values. For most investigated 
subgroups  (gender,  ethnicity,  race,  age,  geographical  region,  time  since  diagnosis  of  type  2  diabetes,  body 
weight,  and  renal  function),  the  treatment  effect  with  regard  to  the  HbA1c  change  from  baseline  was 
generally  consistent,  with  no  meaningful  trends  observed  across  subcategories  and  no  apparent  treatment-
by-subgroup interaction.  
A  potential  interaction  for  the  treatment-by-time  since  diagnosis  of  type  2  diabetes  was  observed  in  study 
1275.9  (p-value  0.0213).  The  strongest  treatment  effects  were  seen  for  the  group  of  recently  diagnosed 
patients;  the  strength  of  the  treatment  effect  generally  decreased  for  longer  time  periods  since  diagnosis.

The group of patients diagnosed for a year or less before study start was small (22 patients), thus its results 
should be interpreted with caution. 
Subgroup  analyses  results  are  discussed  in  detail  below  for  the  following  subgroups  of  particular interest  in 
the treatment of type 2 diabetes: baseline HbA1c, age, and renal function.  
Efficacy in subpopulations in the add-on study 1275.9  
Although  the  treatment  effects  were  clinically  meaningful  in  all  tested  HbA1c  subcategories  (<8.5,  ≥8.5%; 
<8%, 8% to <9%, ≥9%), higher baseline HbA1c levels were associated with greater HbA1c reductions. There 
was  a  clear  effect  (treatment-by-baseline  HbA1c  interaction  p-value:  0.0156)  of  baseline  HbA1c  on  the 
treatment effect of empagliflozin add-on therapy to linagliptin and metformin, for both empagliflozin doses.  
With regard to age, there were clinically meaningful reductions of HbA1c for empagliflozin (both doses) add-
on  therapy  to  linagliptin  and  metformin  for  all  the  analysed  categories  of  patients  younger  than  75  years 
(treatment-by-baseline  age   interaction  p-value  was  0.1617).  The  group  of  patients  aged  75 years  or  older 
was not analysed due to the low number of patients (5 patients) in this category. 
Due  to their  mechanism  of  action,  the  efficacy  of  SGLT-2  inhibitors is  generally  lower in  patients  with  renal 
impairment than in patients with normal renal function (eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2). However, in this study, 
the efficacy was maintained in patients with mild renal impairment (baseline eGFR of 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 
m2)  for  both  empagliflozin  doses.  Patients  with  a  baseline  eGFR  ≤60  mL/min/1.73  m2  were  not  analysed 
separately  due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  with  eGFR 45  to  <60  mL/min/1.73  m2  (5 patients)  and  with 
eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (no patient). There was no evidence of an interaction-by-baseline renal function 
(p-value 0.6992). 
Efficacy in subpopulations in the add-on study 1275.10  
Efficacy in subpopulations in study 1275.10 (met+empa25)  
Reductions in HbA1c levels were observed with lina 5 add-on to empa 25 and metformin in all tested HbA1c 
subcategories.  There  were  similar  treatment  effects  in  patients  with  a  baseline  HbA1c  value  ≥8.5%  and  in 
patients with a baseline HbA1c value <8.5%. The p-value for the treatment-by-subgroup interaction for HbA1c 
categories was 0.4115 and thus it did not suggest an interaction. 
With regard to age, larger reductions in HbA1c for linagliptin add-on therapy to empagliflozin and metformin 
were  observed  in  older  patients  (65  to<75  years)  than  in  younger  patients  (<65 years),  with  a  p-value  for 
the treatment-by-age interaction of 0.0699. The group of patients aged 75 years or more was not analysed 
due to the low number of patients (4 patients) in this category. 
The reductions in HbA1c for linagliptin add-on therapy to empagliflozin and metformin were numerically larger 
in  patients  with  normal  renal  function  than  in  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment.  The  p-value  for  the 
treatment-by-baseline renal function interaction was 0.1416. Patients with a baseline eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 
m2 were not analysed separately given the low number of patients with eGFR 45 to <65 mL/min/1.73 m2 (5 
patients) and with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (1 patient). 
Efficacy in subpopulations in study 1275.10 (met+empa10)  
Reductions in  HbA1c levels  were observed  with lina 5  add-on  to  empa 10  and  metformin  in  all  tested  HbA1c 
subcategories. The subgroup analysis showed comparable treatment effects in the baseline HbA1c categories 
≥8.5% and <8.5%; there was no indication of a treatment-by-baseline HbA1c interaction (p-value 0.9869).

With regard to age, clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment with lina 5 add-on 
to empa 10 and metformin were in the same range for patients aged <65 years and patients aged 65 to <75 
years.  There  was  no  indication  of  a  treatment-by-age  interaction  (p-value  0.8851).  The  group  of  patients 
aged 75 years or older was not analysed due to the low number of patients (4 patients) in this category. 
The  reduction  in  HbA1c  for  lina  5  add-on  therapy  to  empa  10  and  metformin  was  numerically  larger  in 
patients with normal renal function at baseline than in patients with mild renal impairment. The p-value for 
treatment-by-baseline 
the 
interaction  was  0.1962.  Patients  with  a  baseline 
eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were not analysed as separate categories due to the low number of patients with 
eGFR 45 to <65 mL/min/1.73 m2 (5 patients) and with eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (1 patient).

Efficacy in subpopulations in the factorial design study 1275.1 (met) 
In  all  subgroup  analyses  by  baseline  HbA1c,  there  was  a  clear  trend  towards  larger  mean  changes  from 
baseline  to  Week  24  in  patients  with  higher  baseline  HbA1c.  For  the  subgroup  analyses  in  patients  with 
baseline  HbA1c  <8.5%  and  in  those  with  baseline  HbA1c  ≥8.5%,  the  p-value  for  the  treatment-by-baseline 
HbA1c interaction was 0.1142.  
There were changes in HbA1c across all age categories and treatment groups. The p-value for the treatment-
by-age group interaction (4 pre-defined age categories: <50 years, 50 to <65 years, 65 to <75 years, ≥75 
years) was 0.0058, suggesting that the treatment effect differed across the analysed subgroups. Generally, 
the magnitude of the treatment difference between the FDCs and the individual components decreased with 
increasing age. The subcategory of patients aged 75 years or older was not analysed due to the low number 
of patients (fewer than 35 patients) in this category.  
The  adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  were  generally  similar  between  patients  with  normal 
renal  function  and  patients  with  mild  renal  impairment.  There  was  no  indication  of  a  treatment-by-baseline 
renal function interaction (p-value 0.4942). 
Long term effects and persistance of efficacy 
The  Phase  III  trial  1275.1(met)  compared  the  FDC  empa  25/lina  5  and  FDC  empa  10/lina  5  with  the 
corresponding  doses  of  the  individual  components  on  a  background  of  metformin  and  provides  the  main 
evidence of the efficacy of the FDCs over 52 weeks of treatment. 
Reductions  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  were  observed  over  the  entire  52-week  treatment  period  for  patients 
treated  with  the  empa/lina  FDCs.  The  HbA1c  reductions  after  52  weeks  of  treatment  were  higher  with  the 
FDCs  than  with  the  monotherapies.  All  Week  52  sensitivity  analyses  in  study  1275.1(met)  provided  further 
evidence for the sustained reductions in HbA1c with FDC therapy over time for both doses.  
The  adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  over  time  in  study  1275.1(met),  based  on  the  ANCOVA 
analysis  on  the  FAS  (LOCF),  is  shown  in  Figure  8  below.  The  maximal  treatment  effect  in  all  groups  was 
reached  at  Week  12  and  sustained  through  Week  52.  The  MMRM  analysis  of  changes  over  time  in  HbA1c 
provided similar, consistent results.

Figure 8 Change from baseline in HbA1c (%) over 52 weeks in study 1275.1(met) – ANCOVA FAS 
(LOCF) 
In  study  1275.1(met),  results  for  the  percentage  of  patients  who  reached  HbA1c  <7.0%  after  52  weeks  of 
double-blind  treatment  were  similar  to  the  results  of  the  24-week  analysis  (Section  4.1.3).  In  both  FDC 
groups,  about  half  of  the  patients  had  a  sustained  response  to  treatment  at  Week  52,  of  48.0  for  the  high 
dose  and  51.6%  for the  low  dose,  compared with 32.6%  for  empa  25, 32.0%  for  empa 10,  and  28.6%  for 
lina 5. 
Other  efficacy  endpoints  (FPG,  body  weight,  and  blood  pressure)  were  also  evaluated in  study  1275.1(met) 
as part of the long-term analyses described above. In general, the reductions in FPG in the FDC groups were 
consistent  with  the  reductions  in  HbA1c  and  were  sustained  over  time;  they  indicated  a  larger  treatment 
effect than in the individual treatment groups. The reductions in body weight and in blood pressure observed 
on combined therapy vs. treatment with lina 5 were sustained up to 52 weeks of treatment.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Complete  development  programs  including  several  Phase  III  studies  were  conducted  for  empagliflozin  and 
linagliptin  and  supported  the  approval  of  both  drugs  for  the  treatment  of  type  2  diabetes.  The  clinical 
development  programme  for  the  FDC  empa/lina  consists  of  three  pivotal  studies  in  patients  with  type  2 
diabetes mellitus: two add-on studies (1275.9 and 1275.10) and one factorial design study (1275.1).  
The two Phase III add-on studies investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of empagliflozin as add-on 
therapy  to the  DPP-4 inhibitor  linagliptin  (study  1275.9)  and  of linagliptin  as  add-on  therapy to the  SGLT-2 
Assessment report

inhibitor  empagliflozin  (study  1275.10)  in  patients with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  metformin  background 
medication. In the factorial design study, patients were randomised into 5 treatment groups:  empa 25/lina 
5, empa 10/lina 5, empa 25, empa 10, and lina 5 (1275.1). The superiority of each FDC was tested against 
its respective individual components. 
According to the Applicant, the FDC is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic 
control: 
• 
when diet and exercise, plus metformin and a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor do 
not provide adequate glycaemic control, 
• 
when diet and exercise, plus metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP
4) inhibitor do not provide 
adequate glycaemic control, 
‐
• 
when already being treated with the free combination of empagliflozin (or another SGLT-2 inhibitor) 
and linagliptin (or another DPP-4 inhibitor). 
In  general,  the  development  program  for  the  fixed  dose  combination,  including  two  add-on  studies  and  a 
study  with  a  factorial  design,  is  acceptable.  The  three  studies  will  be  able  to  investigate  the  efficacy  of  the 
FDC  and  the  monocomponents,  and  whether  both  components  contribute  to  the  effect  of  the  FDC.  More 
specifically,  in  patients  with  inadequate  glycaemic  control  during  treatment  with  metformin  and  one  of  the 
monocomponents  (i.e.  either  linagliptin  or  empagliflozin),  the  two  add-on  studies  will be  able to  investigate 
the  effects  of  replacing  monocomponent  treatment  with  the  fixed  dose  combination  (linagliptin  and 
empagliflozin). The factorial design study will investigate the effects of starting the fixed dose combination at 
once in comparison to starting treatment with one of the monocomponents.  
The concomitant use of empagliflozin and linagliptin with sulphonylurea derivatives and insulin has not been 
studied. Both empagliflozin and linagliptin as monotherapy have shown to have a higher rate of hypoglycemia 
when  combined  with  these  agents.  For  the  combination  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin,  hypoglycaemia  can 
therefore also be expected to occur when combined with these agents. For this reason, hypoglycaemia (with 
insulin  and/or  SU)  is  considered  an  important  identified  risk  in  the  RMP.  However,  the  combination  with 
insulin  is  not  sought  and  is  not  in  the  indication.  Concomitant  use  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  with 
glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP 1) analogues and thiazidediones has not been studied, but is also not sought. 
The  benefits  of  concomitant  add-on  treatment  vs  sequential  add-on  treatment  in  terms  of  glucose  lowering 
effect  have  not  been  investigated.  Sequential  treatment  allows  the  physician  to  evaluate  the  value  of  each 
added  drug  individually  and  thus  avoids  over-treating  patients.  In  addition,  efficacy  is  modest  and  may  be 
variable  between  patients.  As  it  is  not  known  which  patient  will  benefit  most,  treatment  effects  should  be 
monitored in individual patients. This also argues in favour of sequential add-on treatment. 
The  initially  proposed  wording  of  the  indication  by  the  Applicant  was  not  acceptable.  Switching  from  other 
DPP4-inhibitors  and  SGLT2-inhibitors  to  empagliflozin/linagliptin  combination  therapy  has  not  been  studied. 
The Applicant therefore proposed a new wording for the indication taking into account the CHMP comments in 
the responses to the D 120 LOQ.  
In  addition,  there  was  a  contradiction  between  part  of  the  indication  (the  substitution  therapy)  and  section 
4.2  where  a  starting  dose  of  empa  10/lina  5  was  recommended  for  all  patients.  The  Applicant  added  more 
guidance to address all the patients cases as targeted in the agreed indication.   
Study  population  and  in/exclusion  criteria  are  reasonable.  Treatments  and  objectives  are  acceptable. 
Although HbA1c is a surrogate endpoint, it is acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016

The study populations can be considered relatively representative of the target population. However, due to 
the fact that empagliflozin may not be initiated in patients with a GFR<60 ml/min, only a few patients with 
eGFR below 60 ml/min were included. In addition, very few subjects ≥ 75 years old were included. This limits 
the  external  validity  of  the  trial  to  the  total  population.The  sample  size  estimations,  randomisation 
procedures and blinding procedures are considered adequate. 
The randomisation and blinding procedures were adequate. The analysis populations, analysis of the primary 
and secondary endpoints and the hierarchical testing procedure to ensure control of the overall type I error 
rate are acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 1468 patients contributed to the analyses of efficacy (number of patients in the full analysis set). Of 
these, 1005 patients were treated with the actual fixed dose combination of empagliflozin (25 mg or 10 mg) 
and linagliptin (5 mg). The baseline characteristics were well balanced across the treatment groups. 
Primary endpoint: HbA1c 
Combined  empagliflozin  and 
linagliptin  therapy  with  metformin  background  was  associated  with 
improvements in HbA1c in all Phase III studies. The contribution of empagliflozin to the effect of the FDC is 
relevant. However, the contribution of linagliptin to the effect of the FDC is borderline clinical relevance. 
Empagliflozin as add-on therapy to linagliptin (study 1275.9):  
The  treatment  effect  of  empagliflozin  in  patients  that  are  treated  with  linagliptin  was  modest,  but  clinically 
relevant.  The  treatment  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  top  of  linagliptin  was  -0.70%  (95%  CI:  -0.93,  -0.46)  for 
empa 25 and -0.79% (95% CI: -1.02, -0.55) for empa 10.  
Linagliptin as add-on therapy to empagliflozin (study 1275.10):  
The  treatment  effects of  linagliptin  in  patients  that are  treated  with  empagliflozin  were of  borderline  clinical 
relevance.  The  treatment  effect  of  linagliptin  on  top  of  empagliflozin  25  mg  was  -0.47%  (95%  CI:  -0.66,  -
0.28)  and  the  effect  of  linagliptin  on  top  of  empagliflozin  10  mg  was  -0.32%  (95%  CI:  -0.52,  -0.13).  The 
pooled treatment difference of linagliptin was -0.40% (95% CI: -0.53, -0.27; p<0.0001). Study 1275.10 also 
included an analysis of the proportions of patients who achieved an HbA1c value of 7% or lower at 24 weeks. 
The  analysis  showed  that  more  than  twice  as  many  patients  treated  with  linagliptin  than  with  placebo 
achieved  HbA1c<7.0%  after  24  weeks.  For  linagliptin  as  add  on  to  empagliflozin  25  mg,  responder 
percentages  were  36%  vs.  15%.  For  linagliptin  as  add  on  to  empagliflozin  10  mg,  responder  percentages 
were 26% vs. 11%.  
Factorial design study with FDC and individual components (study 1275.1):  
The difference between the FDC and monotherapy with linagliptin was of modest clinical relevance. In naïve 
patients, the treatment difference for the FDC empa 10/lina 5 was -0.57% (95% CI: -0.76, -0.37) versus lina 
5.  The  treatment  difference  for  the  FDC  empa  25  /lina  5  was  -0.41%  (95%  CI:  -0.61,  -0.22;  p<0.0001) 
versus  lina  5.  In  metformin  treated  patients,  the  treatment  difference  for  the  FDC  empa  10/lina  5  was  -
0.39%  (95%  CI:  -0.56,  -0.21)  versus  lina  5.  The  treatment  difference  for  the  FDC  empa  25  /lina  5  was  -
0.50% (95% CI: -0.67, -0.32) versus lina 5. 
The difference between the FDC and monotherapy with empagliflozin is of borderline clinical relevance. This is 
especially true for the naïve patients. In naïve patients, the treatment difference for the FDC empa 25/lina 5 
group  was  only  -0.14%  (95%  CI:  -0.33,  0.06;  p  =  0.1785)  vs.  empagliflozin  25  mg  monotherapy.  The 
Assessment report

treatment  difference  for  the  FDC  empa10/lina  5  was  only  -0.41%  (95%  CI:  -0.61,  -0.21)  versus  empa  10 
monotherapy.  However,  Glyxambi  is  only  indicated  in  combination  with  metformin.  In  metformin  treated 
patients,  the  treatment  difference  for  the  FDC  empa  25/lina  5  group  was  -0.58%  (95%  CI:  -0.75,  -0.41) 
versus empa 25 and the treatment difference for the FDC empa 10/lina 5 group was -0.42% (95% CI: -0.59, 
-0.25)  versus  empa  10.  In  metformin  treated  patients,  the  proportions  of  patients  who  achieved  an  HbA1c 
value  of  7%  were  64.9%  and  60.0%  for  linagliptin  in  combination  with  empagliflozin  25  mg  and  10  mg 
respectively and 35.7% and 34.3% for empagliflozin 25 mg and 10 mg respectively. 
Other endpoints: fasting glucose 
In  general,  the  results  for  changes  in  FPG  were  consistent  with  the  results  for  the  changes  in  HbA1c.  The 
effects  of  empagliflozin  on  top  of  linagliptin  on  fasting  plasma  glucose  in  study  1275.09  were  modest.  The 
placebo-adjusted  mean  change  in  FPG  was  -2.09  mmol/L  (95%  CI:  -2.61,  -1.57)  for  empa  25  and  -1.80 
mmol/L (95% CI: -2.31, -1.28) for empa 10.  
The effects of linagliptin on top off empagliflozin on fasting plasma glucose in study 1275.10 were small. The 
adjusted mean difference of lina 5 versus placebo for the mean change in FPG was -0.65 mmol/L (95% CI: -
1.15, -0.16; p = 0.0103) in combination with empagliflozin 10 mg and -0.44 mmol/L (95% CI: -0.87, -0.01; 
p = 0.045) in combination with empagliflozin 25 mg. 
The  difference  in  fasting  glucose  between  the  FDC  and  monotherapy  with  linagliptin  in  study  1275.1  was 
modest,  but  the  differences  between  the  FDC  and  empagliflozin  were  very  small.  In  metformin  treated 
patients,  for  the  FDC  empa  25/lina  5,  the  FPG  adjusted  mean  difference  was  -0.91  (SE  0.20)  mmol/L  vs. 
empa  25  and  -1.23  (SE  0.20)  mmol/L  vs.  lina  5.  For  the  FDC  empa  10/lina  5,  the  FPG  adjusted  mean 
difference was -0.63 (SE 0.20) mmol/L vs. empa 10 and -1.06 (SE 0.20) mmol/L vs. lina 5. In naïve patients, 
for the FDC empagliflozin 10/lina 5 group, the FPG adjusted mean difference was -23.63 mg/dL (95.0% CI: -
31.06,-16.21) vs empa 25 mg and for the FDC empa 10/lina 5 was -22.29 mg/dL (95.0% CI: -29.71,-14.88) 
vs empa 10 mg. In naïve patients, there was no relevant difference in the adjusted mean changes in FPG at 
Week 24 between the FDCs and the respective empagliflozin groups. 
Other endpoints: body weight 
Empagliflozin was associated with modest reductions in body weight. In study 1275.9, the placebo-adjusted 
mean change from baseline to Week 24 in body weight was -2.22 kg (95% CI: -2.92, -1.52) for empa 25 and 
-2.77 kg (95% CI: -3.47, -2.07) for empa 10. 
As could be expected based on linagliptin's mechanism of action, linagliptin in combination with empagliflozin 
in  study  1275.10  was  not  associated  with  statistically  significant  changes  in  body  weight  in  comparison  to 
placebo.  
In  study  1275.01  (met),  empagliflozin  and  not  linagliptin  was  associated  with  weight  loss.  The  difference 
versus lina 5 was -2.30 kg (95% CI: -3.15, -1.44) for the FDC empa 25/lina 5 group and -1.91 kg (95% CI: -
2.77,  -1.05)  for  the  FDC  empa  10/lina  5  group.  In  study  1275.01  (naive):  the  difference  was  -1.22  kg 
(95.0% CI: -2.23,-0.21) for the FDC empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg group and -1.96 kg (95.0% CI: -
2.97,-0.95) for the FDC empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg group.

Other endpoints: blood pressure 
In  study  1275.9,  empagliflozin  add-on  to  linagliptin  and  metformin  provided  reductions  in  systolic  blood 
pressure  after  24  weeks  of  treatment  compared  with  placebo,  with  placebo-adjusted  mean  changes  of -2.6 
(SE 1.5) mmHg for empa 25 treatment and -1.3 (SE 1.5) mmHg for empa 10 treatment. A clinically relevant 
reduction  in  diastolic  blood  pressure  was  also  observed  for  patients  treated  with  empa  25,  with  a  placebo-
adjusted mean change of -1.1 (SE 1.1) mmHg; however, there was no reduction in diastolic blood pressure 
for patients treated with empa 10 ( -0.1 (SE 1.1 mmHg). 
In  study  1275.10,  linagliptin  add-on  to  empagliflozin  (25  mg  and  10  mg)  and  metformin  provided  no 
reductions in systolic or diastolic blood pressure after 24 weeks of treatment compared with placebo. 
In  study  1275.1,  there  were  similar  reductions  in  both  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  in  the  FDC  and 
empagliflozin groups. There were no changes in blood pressure with linagliptin treatment.  
Efficacy after 52 weeks 
In general, in study 1275.1, the effects after 52 weeks were in line with the findings after 24 weeks. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  contribution  of  empagliflozin  to  the  FDC  empa/lina  is  relevant.  When  added  to linagliptin,  empagliflozin 
was  associated  with  clinically  relevant  reductions  in  HbA1c.  Moreover,  addition  of  empagliflozin  was 
associated with reductions in fasting glucose, body weight and blood pressure. Effects of linagliptin on HbA1c, 
when  added  to  empagliflozin,  were  of  modest  clinical  relevance.  Addition  of  linagliptin  was  not  associated 
with relevant reductions in fasting glucose nor with effects on body weight and blood pressure. In the fixed 
combination guideline (EMA/CHMP/689925/2014), it is stated that each component should contribute to the 
efficacy. Data from the factorial design study 1275.1(met) suggest that the treatment difference between the 
combination  of  empagliflozin/linagliptin  and  empagliflozin  monotherapy  was  acceptable.  Proportions  of 
patients  who  achieved  an  HbA1c  value  of  7%  due  to  linagliptin  were  also  acceptable  in  study  1275.1  and 
1275.10. 
Due to the fact that empagliflozin may not be initiated in patients with a GFR<60 ml/min, only a few patients 
with eGFR below 60 ml/min were included. In addition, very few subjects ≥75 years old were included. This 
limits the external validity of the trial to the total population. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Overall,  2173  patients  were  treated  in  the  Phase  III  studies  1275.9,  1275.10,  and  1275.1.  Of  these,  1496 
patients  (68.8%)  received  metformin  background  medication  and  1005  patients  received  combined 
empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  treatment:  733  patients  (72.9%)  with  pre-existing  metformin  background 
therapy (in studies 1275.9, 1275.10, and 1275.1(met)) and 272 (27.1%) without (in study 1275.1(naïve)). 
There were no safety issues in the 2 Phase I trials, which included a total of 58 healthy subjects.

Adverse events 
Overview of adverse events in study 1275.9 
In  study 1275.9, the numbers of patients reported with at least 1 adverse event on-treatment were similar 
between  both  empagliflozin  (add-on  to  linagliptin  5  mg  and  metformin)  groups;  a  higher  proportion  of 
patients was reported for the placebo group (Table 12).  
The proportion of patients reported with adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation was overall low 
(<2%). No patient died during the study. The numbers of patients reported with serious adverse events were 
similar between both empagliflozin (add-on to linagliptin 5 mg and metformin) groups; a higher proportion of 
patients  was  reported  for  the  placebo  group.  For  a  detailed  description  of  the  different  types  of  adverse 
events, see the sections below.

Overview of adverse events in study 1275.10 
In study 1275.10, the numbers of patients reported with at least 1 adverse event on treatment were similar 
between  the  linagliptin  5  mg  (add-on  to  empagliflozin  and  metformin)  and  corresponding  placebo  groups 
(Table 13). The proportion of patients reported with adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation and 
serious adverse events was overall low and similar between all treatment groups. No patient died during the 
on-treatment phase of the study. For a detailed description of the different types of adverse events, see the

Overview of adverse events in study 1275.1(met) 
In study 1275.1(met), the proportions of patients reported with at least 1 adverse event on treatment were 
similar  between  treatment  groups  (Table  14).  Adverse  events  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  were 
reported  more  frequently  in  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  group  than  in  the  other  treatment  groups.  The 
proportion of patients reported with serious adverse events was overall low and similar between all treatment 
groups.  Two  cases  of  deaths  were  reported  on-treatment:  1  patient  died  in  the  empagliflozin  10 
mg/linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to metformin) treatment group and 1 patient in the empagliflozin 10 mg (add-on 
to  metformin)  treatment  group.  For  a  detailed  description  of  the  different  types  of  adverse  events,  see  the

Overview of adverse events in study 1275.1(naïve) 
In  study  1275.1(naïve),  the  numbers  of  patients  reported  with  at  least  1  adverse  event  on  treatment were 
overall  similar  between  treatment  groups,  with  more  patients  reported  with  adverse  events  in  the 
empagliflozin 10 mg group (Table 15). Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were reported for 
more  patients  in  the  empagliflozin/linagliptin  and  empagliflozin  groups  than  in  the  linagliptin  group.  The 
proportion  of  patients  reported  with  serious  adverse  events  was  overall  low,  but  higher  in  the 
empagliflozin/linagliptin  and  empagliflozin  groups  than  in  the  linagliptin  group.  Four  cases  of  deaths  were 
reported  on-treatment:  2  patients  died  in  the  empagliflozin  25  mg  treatment  group,  1  patient  in  the 
empagliflozin  10  mg/linagliptin  5  mg  treatment  group,  and  1  patient  in  the  empagliflozin  10  mg  treatment 
group. For a detailed description of the different types of adverse events, see the sections below.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
Most frequently reported serious adverse events 
The  frequency  of  patients  with  serious  adverse  events  in  each  add-on  study  was  generally  low  (less  than 
9.5%) and overall lower in the add-on therapy groups than in the respective placebo groups in patients who 
had already received treatment with either linagliptin or empagliflozin and metformin. Each serious adverse 
event PT was reported for only 1 patient (0.9%) per treatment group. In the factorial design study 1275.1, 
the frequencies of patients with serious adverse events were generally similar across treatment groups (less 
than 8.0%).  
Overall,  treatment  with  empagliflozin  added  to  linagliptin  and  metformin,  with  linagliptin  added  to 
empagliflozin and metformin, or combined FDC therapy in patients with or without metformin background did 
not  indicate  an  increased  risk  of  serious  adverse  events  compared  with  treatment  with  either  individual 
component in the presence or absence of metformin.  
Deaths 
No  patients  were  reported  with  fatal  adverse  events  in  the  open-label  or  double-blind  treatment  periods  of 
studies  1275.9  and  1275.10.  Six  patients  in  study  1275.1  had  fatal  adverse  events  with  an  on-treatment 
onset,  2  of  whom  had  received  combined  therapy  with  empa  10/lina  5  and  metformin  (fatal  PTs: 
haemorrhagic stroke and hypertensive heart disease). Each fatal PT was reported in 1 patient only.

Adverse events of special interest 
Based on the modes of action, known safety profiles, or safety topics of interest for currently available SGLT-
2 and DPP-4 inhibitors, safety data were searched for AESIs. 
Decreased renal function 
As  the  mode  of  action  of  SGLT-2  inhibitors  depends  on  renal  function,  decreased  renal  function  was  a 
prespecified  event  in  the  Phase  III  clinical  trial  protocols.  Investigators  were  to  report  increased  serum 
creatinine values (≥ 2x baseline and above the upper limit of normal [ULN]) as in an expedited manner to the 
sponsor. In all studies, the frequency of patients with decreased renal function adverse events or significant 
laboratory  values  was  low  (0  to  0.9%).  Patients  were  reported  with  adverse  events  belonging  to  the  SMQ 
‘acute renal failure’ at low frequencies in Phase III studies (1 patient per treatment group, 0.4 to 0.9%). In 
an analysis based on the criterion for serum creatinine values defined above, only 2 patients were identified, 
both in study 1275.1(met): 1 patient in the low dose FDC group and 1 patient in the high dose FDC group. 
Small  comparable  fluctuations  in  mean  eGFR  and  eCCr  values  over  time  were  observed  in  all  treatment 
groups in each study. There were no differences across groups with regard to the proportions of patients who 
shifted into worse or better renal function categories based on eGFR values. In line with the study inclusion 
criteria,  the  majority  of  the  patients  had  baseline  values  in  the  normal  or  microalbuminuria  ranges.  The 
proportions  of  patients  with  shifts  from  one  urine-albumine-to-creatinine  ratio  (UACR)  category  to  another 
were overall low and comparable across studies and treatment groups. 
Hepatic injury 
Expedited  reporting  by  the  investigators  was  required  for  patients  with  laboratory  values  consistent  with  a 
biochemical Hy's law constellation, defined as ALT and/or AST ≥ 3x ULN with concomitant or subsequent total 
bilirubin  ≥ 2x  ULN  within  30  days  after  ALT/AST  elevation;  information  on  whether  alkaline  phosphatase 
levels  (the  maximum  value  in  the  30-day  period  mentioned  above)  reached  2x  ULN  or  more  was  to  be 
provided.  In  addition,  increased  ALT/AST  levels  were  to  also  be  reported  (ALT  or  AST  ≥ 3x,  ≥ 5x,  ≥ 10x, 
≥ 20x  ULN).  Patients  with  ALT  and/or  AST  ≥ 5xULN  met  the  criteria  for  adjudication  by  an  independent 
committee. 
Overall, there was no evidence of an increased risk of patients developing increased liver enzyme values or 
drug-induced liver injury when empagliflozin was added to linagliptin treatment on a metformin background, 
when linagliptin was added to empagliflozin on a metformin background, or when the FDC was compared to 
the individual components in the presence or absence of metformin. 
The  frequency  of  patients  reported  with  hepatic  adverse  events  was  low  (<3.0%)  and  comparable  across 
treatment groups in each study. Liver enzyme (ALT/AST) elevations in the range ≥ 3x ULN and <5x ULN were 
rare  in  each  study  (reported  for  ≤ 2  patients  per  treatment  group).  The  most  common  PTs  were  hepatic 
steatosis  and  several  PTs  indicating  increased  liver  enzymes.  Hepatic  events  with  an  onset  within  30  days 
after the last dose of double-blind treatment medication were rare (≤ 1 patients per study). 
All treatment-emergent cases suspected of drug-induced liver injury were adjudicated in a blinded fashion by 
an independent committee of external hepatic experts. A total of 5 patients in combined therapy groups, all 
on  metformin  background  therapy,  had  hepatic  cases  sent  for  adjudication  that  were  confirmed:  2  with  a 
possible causal relationship to study drug and 3 with a probable relationship to study drug.

Pancreatitis 
Overall  in  the  Phase  III  studies,  only  3  patients  were  reported  with  pancreatitis:  1  patient  (0.8%)  with  a 
serious acute pancreatitis in the lina 5 group (add-on to empa 10 and metformin) in study 1275.10; 1 patient 
(0.8%) with a serious chronic pancreatitis in the lina 5 group in study 1275.1(met); 1 patient (0.7%) with a 
non-serious acute pancreatitis in the FDC empa 25/lina 5 group in study 1275.1(naïve).  
Urinary tract infection 
Despite  urinary  tract  infection  being  a  labelled  side-effect  for  empagliflozin,  there  was  no  evidence  of  an 
increased  risk of  urinary  tract  infection  for  combined  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin treatment  with or  without 
metformin  background,  compared  with  either  empagliflozin  or  linagliptin  treatment,  in  the  presence  or 
absence of metformin.  
Overall,  less  than  16.5%  of  patients  across  studies  and  treatment  groups  were  reported  with  (BIcMQ: 
Boehringer Ingelheim customized MEdDRA Query) urinary tract infection events. Most patients were assigned 
therapy  as  consequence  of  their  infection,  and  most  patients  only  had  1  episode  of  urinary  tract  infection. 
The frequency of patients with urinary tract infection (BIcMQ) was higher in  women than in men, but there 
was  no  treatment  difference  in  either  women  or  men.  There  was  no  clear  effect  of  age,  baseline  HbA1c,  or 
history  of  urinary  tract  infections  on  the  occurrence  of  urinary  tract  infections.  Discontinuation  of  trial 
medication due to a urinary tract infection was rare (≤ 3 patients per study.) 
In  study  1275.9  (empagliflozin  add-on  to  linagliptin  and  metformin),  3.6%  of  the  patients  in  the  empa  25 
group  and  7.1%  of  the  patients  in  the  empa  10  of patients  had  urinary  tract  infections  (BIcMQ),  compared 
with 7.3% of the patients treated with placebo. In study 1275.10(met+empa 25) (lina 5 add-on to empa 25 
and metformin), a higher proportion of patients had urinary tract infections when treated with lina 5 (13.4% 
of  patients)  than  when  treated  with  placebo  (8.0%).  In  study  1275.10(met+empa  10)  (lina  5  add-on  to 
empa  25  and  metformin),  similar  proportions  of  patients  had  urinary  tract  infections  (BIcMQ)  when  treated 
with lina 5 (9.5%) and with placebo (7.8%). In the add-on studies, only 1 severe event was reported, for 1 
patient in study 1275.10(met+empa10), which led to hospitalisation of the patient.  
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  frequencies  of  patients  reported  with  urinary  tract 
infections across treatment groups in the factorial design study 1275.1. In study 1275.1(met), the frequency 
of patients with urinary tract infections ranged from 9.6 to 15.2%. In study 1275.1(naïve), the proportion of 
patients with urinary tract infections ranged from 10.4 to 16.3% across treatment groups.  
Genital infections 
In the empagliflozin/linagliptin clinical development programme, combined treatment with empagliflozin and 
linagliptin  did  not  increase  the  risk  of  genital  infection  compared  with  empagliflozin  treatment,  in  the 
presence or absence of metformin.  
Overall,  less  than  9.0%  of  patients  at  treatment  group  level  in  each  study  had  (BIcMQ)  genital  infections. 
Overall,  the  numerical  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  Phase  III  studies  were  not  considered 
clinically relevant, given the low number of patients reported with such events. Most events were of mild or 
moderate  intensity.  Most  patients  were  assigned  therapy  as  a  consequence  of  their  infection,  and  most 
patients  had  only  1  episode  of  genital  infection  (BIcMQ).  Overall,  the  frequency  of  patients  with  genital 
infection (BIcMQ) was higher in women than in men; an exception to this was the group FDC empa 25/lina 5, 
where  frequencies  of  genital  infection  (BIcMQ)  were  comparable  between  genders.  There  was  no  clear 
treatment  difference  in  either  women  or  men;  no  clear  effect  of  age,  baseline  HbA1c,  or  history  of  genital

infections  was  observed.  Severe  or  serious  genital  infections  and  premature  discontinuations  of  study 
medication due to genital infection were very infrequent (2 patients, both in study 1275.1(met)). 
In  study  1275.9  (empagliflozin  add-on  to  linagliptin  and  metformin),  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  had 
genital  infection  (BIcMQ)  in  the  empa  25  group  (4.5%)  than  in  the  empa  10  and  placebo  groups  (1.8% 
each).  In  study  1275.10(met+empa25)  (linagliptin  add-on  to  empa  25  and  metformin),  the  frequency  of 
patients  with  genital  infections  was  lower  with  linagliptin  treatment  (2.7%)  than  with  placebo  treatment 
(8.0%).  In  study  1275.10(met+empa10)  (linagliptin  add-on  to  empa  10  and  metformin),  the  frequency  of 
patients with genital infections was similar across groups: 2.4% in the lina 5 group and 3.1% in the placebo 
group. Premature discontinuation due to a genital infection was not reported in studies 1275.9 and 1275.10. 
One patient in study 1275.10 required hospitalisation. In the factorial design study 1275.1, the frequencies of 
patients with genital infections ranged from 2.2 to 8.5% for metformin-treated patients and 2.9 to 5.9% for 
drug-naïve patients.  
Hypoglycaemic adverse events 
Hypoglycaemia is a labelled side effect of both empagliflozin and linagliptin (when taken together with insulin 
or sulphonylurea). In the Phase III studies, investigators were asked to provide additional information on the 
case report forms (CRFs) for hypoglycaemic events, such as whether they were symptomatic or not, as well 
as the corresponding plasma glucose value. In the safety analyses, confirmed hypoglycaemic adverse events 
comprised  all  investigator-reported  symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  adverse  events  that  had  a  plasma 
glucose  value  of  ≤ 70  mg/dL  or  that  required  the  assistance  of  another  person.  Events  that  required  the 
assistance of another person were categorised as major hypoglycaemia.  
The  frequency  of  patients  with  confirmed  hypoglycaemic  adverse  events  was  low  (0  to  2.7%  per  treatment 
group in each Phase III study). Overall, 2 events required external assistance: 1 event in the empa 25 group 
(add-on  to  lina  5+metformin  in  study  1275.9)  and  1  event  in  the  lina  5  group  (add-on  to  empa 
25+metformin in study 1275.10). No clear effect of sex or time to onset of confirmed hypoglycaemic events 
was observed.  
In  conclusion,  combined  treatment  with  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  on  a  metformin  background  did  not 
increase the risk of (major) hypoglycaemia compared with empagliflozin or linagliptin, regardless of which of 
the sequence of adding the individual components.  
Bone fracture 
Bone fracture (BIcMQ) was not identified as a potential risk in the Phase III clinical study protocols. The BI-
customised MedDRA search included about 60 PTs of fractures. The overall frequencies of patients with bone 
fracture (BIcMQ) were low and similar across treatment groups (≤ 4 patients [<3.0%] per treatment group in 
each study). At PT level, there were no notable imbalances across treatment groups [Module 2.7.4, Section 
2.1.6.7].  Combined  treatment  with  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  with  or  without  metformin  background  was 
not  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  bone  fracture  compared  with  treatment  with  empagliflozin,  with  or 
without metformin. 
Volume depletion 
Volume depletion is a labelled side effect of empagliflozin and was summarised based on a MedDRA search of 
reported adverse events (BIcMQ). Based on the mode of action of empagliflozin, treatment with empagliflozin 
lowers blood pressure, possibly because of osmotic diuresis and fluid loss. Volume depletion could also be a 
result  of  increased  urination  (such  as  pollakiuria  and  polyuria).  There  was  no  specific  exclusion  criterion  for 
patients  at  risk  for  volume  depletion  in  the  trial  protocols.  The  overall  frequencies  of  patients  with  volume

depletion  (BIcMQ)  were  low  for  all  studies  and  treatment  groups  (<3.0%).  The  most  frequently  reported 
adverse  event  was  hypotension.  Combined  treatment  with  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  with  or  without 
metformin  background  therapy  did  not  increase  the  risk  of  volume  depletion  compared  with  empagliflozin 
treatment, with or without metformin. 
Malignancy 
Malignancy  was  not  identified  as  a  possible  risk  in  the  study  protocols.  Fifteen  patients  were  reported  with 
malignancies during the double-blind treatment period of the Phase III studies (not more than 3 patients per 
treatment  group,  0  to  2.2%).  Two  patients  were  reported  with  malignancies  in  the  post-treatment  period. 
The  reported  malignancies  were  of  several  different tumour  types  and  locations  at  PT  level,  without  a  clear 
trend for a certain tumour type or location. About half of the malignancies had an onset date after 6 months 
of treatment. No cases of thyroid neoplasms were reported in any Phase III study. 
Most  of  the  reported  malignancies  were  in  the  52-week  study  1275.1  (13  patients,  0.4%  to  1.8%  per 
treatment  group,  of  which  7  patients  [1.3%]  were  on  FDC  treatment).  Two  patients  were  reported  with 
malignancies in the empagliflozin add-on to linagliptin study 1275.9: 1 patient in the empa 10 (add-on to lina 
5  and  metformin)  group  had  breast  cancer  and  1  patient  in  the  placebo  (add-on  to  lina  5  and  metformin) 
group had a bladder neoplasm. One malignancy was reported in the post-treatment period of the linagliptin 
add-on to empagliflozin study 1275.10 (in the lina 5 add-on to empa10 and metformin group, PT: pancreatic 
carcinoma). 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
The frequency of patients with hypersensitivity reactions (SMQ) was less than 7.0% per treatment group at 
study level and generally similar across treatment groups in each trial.  
At PT level, patients were most frequently reported with dermatitis in study 1275.9 (empagliflozin add-on to 
linagliptin  and  metformin):  1  patient  in  the  empa  25  group  and  2  patients  in  the  empa  10  group.  In  study 
1275.10  (linagliptin  add-on  to  empagliflozin  and  metformin),  each  hypersensitivity  event  was  reported  in  1 
patient only at PT level.  
In study 1275.1(met), patients were most frequently reported with eczema: 2 patients in each of the empa 
25  and  lina  5  groups  and  1  patient  in  each  of  the  FDC  empa  25/lina5  and  empa  10  groups.  In  study 
1275.1(naïve), patients were most frequently reported with rash and allergic rhinitis (4 patients for each PT, 
1  in  each  treatment  group  except  for  empa  25).  Urticaria  was  the  only  PT  reported  in  2  patients  per 
treatment  group,  both  in  the  empa  25  group.  All  other  reported  hypersensitivity  reactions  PTs  were  in  1 
patient each at treatment group level.  
Thus,  combined  treatment  with  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  did  not  increase  the  risk  of  hypersensitivity 
reactions compared with the individual components when administered in patients, with or without metformin 
background therapy. 
Laboratory findings 
This  section  summarises  parameters  with  results  of  particular  interest  (haematocrit,  uric  acid,  lipase,  and 
serum lipids).  
Haematocrit 
Treatment  with  empagliflozin  (25  or  10  mg)  add-on  therapy  to  linagliptin  and  metformin  in  study  1275.9 
resulted  in  small  increases  in  haematocrit  levels  (of  about  4.0%)  from  baseline  to  the  last  value  on-
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 80/107 
  
  
treatment;  there  was  no  change  in  haematocrit  in  the  placebo  group.  There  were  no  notable  changes  in 
haematocrit  levels  in  the  linagliptin  add-on  to  empagliflozin  and  metformin  study  1275.10.  In  the  factorial 
study  1275.1,  treatment  with  either  dose  of  the  FDC  empa/lina  or  empagliflozin  monotherapy  resulted  in 
increased  haematocrit  levels  from  baseline  to  last  value  on-treatment  (of  up  to  4.5%),  compared  with  a 
smaller increase from baseline with lina 5 treatment (1.3%).  
In  line  with  these  results,  higher  proportions  of  patients  had  shifts  from  the  normal  range  at  baseline  to 
higher  than  ULN  values  at  the  end-of-treatment  when  treated  with  empagliflozin  add-on  to  linagliptin  and 
metformin  than  with  placebo  in  study  1275.9.  In  contrast,  treatment  with  linagliptin  as  add-on  therapy  to 
empagliflozin  and  background  metformin  in  study  1275.10  was  not  associated  with  shifts  from  normal 
baseline  values  to  higher  than  ULN  values  at  the  end-of-treatment.  In  the  factorial  design  study  1275.1, 
higher  proportions  of  patients  had  shifts  from  normal  values  to  higher  than  ULN  values  with  FDC  or 
empagliflozin treatment (4.3 to 8.9% in study 1275.1(met) and 9.7 to 15.1% in study 1275.1(naïve)) than 
with  linagliptin  treatment (1.7%  in  study  1275.1(met)  and  0.8%  in  study  1275.1(naïve)).  Possibly  clinically 
significant abnormal haematocrit values in the high range were reported for <3.5% of patients per treatment 
group at study level in all Phase III studies.  
In  conclusion,  treatment  with  empagliflozin  as  add-on  to  linagliptin  on  a  metformin  background  or  with  the 
FDC  empagliflozin/linagliptin  in  patients  with  or  without  metformin  background  were  associated  with  small 
increases in haematocrit; however, these changes were not associated with thromboembolic complications.  
Uric acid 
Treatment  with  empagliflozin  25  or  10  mg  as  add-on  therapy  to  linagliptin  and  metformin  background  in 
study 1275.9 resulted in decreased uric acid values from baseline to last value on-treatment, whereas there 
was  a  small  increase  in  the  placebo  group.  In  contrast,  treatment  with  linagliptin  as  add-on  therapy  to 
empagliflozin and metformin background in study 1275.10 was not associated with decreased uric acid levels. 
Treatment  with  either  FDC  dose  or  (with  or  without  metformin)  in  study  1275.1  resulted  in  decreased  uric 
acid  levels  from  baseline  to  last  value  on-treatment.  There  was  a  slight  increase  from  baseline  with 
linagliptin. 
In  the  empagliflozin  add-on  to  linagliptin  and  metformin  study  1275.9,  higher  proportions  of  patients  had 
shifts from higher than ULN values at baseline to normal values at end-of-treatment, or from normal values 
at  baseline  to  lower  than  LLN  at  the  end-of-treatment  when  treated  with  empagliflozin  than  when  treated 
with placebo. In the linagliptin add-on to empagliflozin and metformin study 1275.10, shifts in uric acid from 
one range at baseline to another range after 24 weeks of treatment were rare and similar across treatment 
groups. In the factorial design study 1275.1, higher proportions of patients had shifts from the normal range 
to  less  than  LLN  values  or  from  higher  than  ULN  values  at  baseline  to  the  normal  range  at  the  end-of 
treatment  when  treated  with  FDC  or  empagliflozin  than  with  linagliptin.  The  proportion  of  patients  with 
possibly clinically significant abnormal uric acid values was low in all studies.  
Uric acid increased with empagliflozin add-on therapy to linagliptin, but decreased during treatment with the 
FDC.  The  clinical  relevance  of  changes  in  uric  acid  values  is  unclear.  In  some  epidemiological  studies,  uric 
acid  has  been  reported  as  a  marker  of  cardiovascular  risk,  with  lower  uric  acid  levels  associated  with  lower 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 
Lipase 
Normalised  mean  baseline  lipase  values  were  generally  similar  in  all  treatment  groups  in  the  Phase  III 
studies.  In  the  empagliflozin  add-on  to  linagliptin  and  metformin  study  1275.9,  a  mean  decrease  in  lipase 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 81/107 
  
  
values was observed in the empagliflozin groups; there was no change in the placebo group. In the linagliptin 
add-on to empagliflozin and metformin study 1275.10, a mean increase in lipase values was observed in all 
groups. In the factorial design study 1275.1(met), there was a mean increase in lipase from baseline to Week 
52  in  the  lina  5  and  FDC  groups  and  no  change  in  the  empagliflozin  groups.  In  the  factorial  design  study 
1275.1(naïve), a similar pattern for lipase changes was observed.  
The proportions of patients with shifts from normal values at baseline to >ULN at last value on-treatment or 
with  possibly  clinically  significant  abnormal  high  values  were  generally  higher  in  the  treatment  groups 
including linagliptin than in treatment groups including empagliflozin alone. Frequencies of shifts were similar 
across  treatment  groups  in  study  1275.9.  In  study  1275.1(naïve),  the  proportions  of  patients  with  possibly 
clinically significant abnormal high values ranged from 2.3 to 10.6% across treatment groups.  
As expected, linagliptin was associated with higher lipase levels.  
Serum lipids 
Changes from baseline to the last value on-treatment 
In  studies  1275.9  and  1275.1,  small  mean  increases  from  baseline  to  end-of-treatment  were  observed  for 
total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol in the empagliflozin and combined therapy groups, but 
not for lina 5 treatment. There was no notable trend in the change from baseline in cholesterol levels in study 
1275.10.  In  study  1275.9,  mean  decreases  in  triglyceride  levels  were  noticed  across;  there  were  generally 
mean  increases  in  triglycerides  in  study  1275.10.  In  study  1275.1,  mean  increases  were  observed  for 
triglyceride  levels  in  the  linagliptin  or  combined  therapy  groups,  compared  with  decreases  in  the 
empagliflozin groups. The HDL-cholesterol/LDL-cholesterol ratio did not change. The causes for the increases 
in serum lipids are unknown but haemoconcentration might have contributed to this effect, given the mode of 
action of empagliflozin. 
Shifts from baseline to end-of-treatment 
In the add-on study 1275.9, the proportions of patients with shifts from normal values at baseline to higher 
than  ULN  levels  at  last  value  on-treatment  were  slightly  higher  in  the  empagliflozin  groups  than  in  the 
placebo  group  for  total  cholesterol,  HDL-cholesterol,  LDL-cholesterol,  and  triglycerides.  Additionally,  for 
triglycerides,  the  proportions  of  patients  with  shifts  from  higher  than  ULN  values  at  baseline  to  the  normal 
range at last value on-treatment were also higher in the empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group.  
In  the  add-on  study  1275.10,  the  proportions  of  patients  with  shifts  from  normal  cholesterol  values  at 
baseline  to  higher  than  ULN  at  last  value  on-treatment  ranged  from  20%  to  22.6%  and  were  comparable 
between  treatment  groups.  The  proportions  of  patients  with  shifts  from  normal  triglycerides  values  at 
baseline to higher than ULN levels at last value on-treatment, or from higher than ULN values at baseline to 
the  normal  range  at  last  value  on-treatment  were  higher  in  the  empagliflozin  groups  than  in  the  placebo 
group.  
In the  factorial design study 1275.1(met), higher proportions of patients had shifts from normal cholesterol 
values  to  higher  than  ULN  values  at  Week  52  with  FDC  or  empagliflozin  treatment  than  with  linagliptin 
treatment.  There  were  no  notable  differences  across  treatment  groups  in  the  proportions  of  patients  with 
shifts from normal values at baseline to higher than ULN or to lower than LLN values at end of treatment for 
triglycerides.  
In  the  factorial  design  study  1275.1(naïve),  there  were  frequent  transitions  from  baseline  values  to  higher 
than ULN for total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. Higher proportions of patients had shifts in 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 82/107 
  
  
LDL-cholesterol  from  normal  values  at  baseline  to  higher  than  ULN  values  at  Week  52  in  the  FDC  empa 
10/lina  5  and  empa  10  groups  than  in  the  other  groups.  Lower  proportions  of  patients  had  shifts  in  total 
cholesterol  values  from  the  normal  range  at  baseline  to  higher  than  ULN  values  at  Week  52  in  the  lina  5 
group than in other groups. Apart from that, there were no notable differences between groups with regard 
to shifts from the normal range at baseline to higher than ULN or lower than LLN values at Week 52. 
Possibly clinically significant abnormalities 
Overall  in  Phase  III  studies,  the  proportions  of  patients  with  possibly  clinically  significant  abnormalities  for 
lipid parameters ranged from 1.9 to 12.9% per treatment group across studies. In the add-on study 1275.9, 
the  proportions  of  patients  with  possibly  clinically  abnormal  values  in  the  high  range  were  higher  in  the 
empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group for total cholesterol; comparable proportions of patients had 
possibly clinically abnormal triglyceride values across treatment groups. In the add-on study 1275.10, similar 
proportions  of  patients  had  possibly  clinically  abnormal  total  cholesterol  and  triglyceride  values  across 
treatment  groups.  In  the  factorial  design  study  1275.1,  in  both  patient  populations,  the  proportions  of 
patients  with  possibly  clinically  significant  abnormal values  of  cholesterol  and triglycerides  were  comparable 
across treatment groups. 
Vital signs 
The  frequency  of  patients  with  hypotension  or  orthostatic  hypotension  was  low  and  comparable  between 
treatment  groups  in  all  studies,  despite  the  reduction  in  blood  pressure  with  empagliflozin  add-on  to 
linagliptin  and  metformin  compared  with  placebo  in  study  1275.9,  and  after  treatment  with  the  FDCs 
compared  with  linagliptin  in  study  1275.1(met).  Therefore,  in  the  empagliflozin/linagliptin  clinical 
development  programme,  combined  treatment  with  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  with  or  without  metformin 
did not lead to a higher frequency of risk for hypotensive adverse events compared with treatment with the 
individual components, in the presence or absence of metformin. For all treatment groups in all studies, there 
were almost no changes in pulse rate from baseline to end-of-treatment. 
Safety in special populations 
For the integrated analyses, subgroup analyses were generally only performed for individual Phase III studies 
and  not  for  study  groupings.  This  summary  focuses  on  subgroups  analyses  in  the  pivotal  Phase  III  studies 
1275.9 and 1275.10. 
Age 
Only subjects at least 18 years of age were included in the studies described in this document. In the add-on 
studies 1275.9 and 1275.10, about 90% of the patients were younger than 65 years at baseline. Only around 
15%  were  between  65  and  75 years,  2%  were  older  than  75 years,  and  1 patient  was older than  85 years. 
Therefore results of subgroup analyses of patients older than 65 years are mostly inconclusive.  
The number of patients by age category is shown in Table 16,17 and 18.

5 Patients ≥65 years of age were reported more frequently with this preferred term than patients <65 years of age  
In studies 1275.9 and 1275.10, the frequency of patients with adverse events was not obviously affected by 
the age category. Within each age category, the trends in the frequency of all types of adverse events were 
consistent with those for the overall population.  
In  the  factorial  design  study  1275.1(pooled),  81.6%  of  the  patients  were  younger  than  65 years  at  baseline. 
Only 16.1% were between 65 and 75 years, 2.2% were between 75 and 85 years and only 1 patient (0.1%) 
was  older than  85 years.  Therefore  results of  subgroup  analyses  of  patients  older than  75 years  are  mostly 
inconclusive.  
The frequency of patients with adverse events was  not obviously affected by the age category. Within each 
age  category,  the  trends  in  the  frequency  of  all  types  of  adverse  events  were  consistent  with  those  for the 
overall population.  
Gender 
In  study  1275.9,  two-thirds  of  patients  were  men,  and  in  study  1275.10,  about  half  of  the  patients  were 
men.  Demographic  data  were  largely  similar  for  men  and  women  and  among  the  treatment  groups  in  both 
studies. 
In the Phase III studies 1275.9 and 1275.10, the frequency of patients with any adverse event, with urinary 
tract  infection  (BIcMQ),  or  with  genital  infection  (BIcMQ)  was  higher  for  women  than  for  men  for  all 
treatment groups. For either gender, the trends in the frequency of the other types of adverse events were 
consistent with those for the overall population of the trials. 
In study 1275.1 (pooled), about half of the patients were men. Demographic data were largely similar for men 
and women and among the treatment groups.

The  frequency  of  patients  with  any  adverse  event  or  with  genital  infection  (BIcMQ)  was  higher  for  women 
than  for  men  for  all  treatment  groups  except  the  empagliflozin 25/linagliptin 5 mg  group.  The  frequency  of 
patients with urinary tract infection (BIcMQ) was higher for women than for men for all treatment groups. For 
either gender, the trends in the frequency of the other types of adverse events were consistent with those for 
the overall population. 
Race 
Study  1275.9  included  patients  from  all  races,  with 58%  White  patients,  27%  Asian  patients  and  9%  Black 
patients.  Urinary  tract  infection  (BIcMQ)  was  more  frequently  reported  for  White  than  for  Black  or  Asian 
patients. For all other types of events, there was no clear trend for differences between races. 
Study 1275.10 included 97% White patients, therefore results of subgroups analyses of race are inconclusive 
and are not presented. 
Study  1275.1  included  patients  from  all  races,  with 74%  White  patients,  13%  Asian  patients  and  7%  Black 
patients. For all types of adverse events, there was no clear trend for differences between races.  
Renal function 
Based  on  MDRD,  renal  function  was  categorised  as  normal  (eGFR  ≥90 mL/min/1.73m2),  mild  renal 
impairment  (60 to  <90 mL/min/1.73m2),  and  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  (<60 mL/min/1.73m2). 
Moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment  was  an  exclusion  criterion  in  all  Phase III  studies  because  of  the 
metformin  background  therapy.  Very  few  patients  are  included  in  these  subgroups,  mostly  because  study 
inclusion was based on local calculation of renal function with the Cockcroft-Gault formula. 
In the add-on studies 1275.9 and 1275.10, about half of the patients had normal renal function and the other 
half had mild renal impairment at baseline. Demographic data were overall similar between subgroups. The 
frequency  of  patients  with  all  types  of  adverse  events  was  not  obviously  affected  by  the  renal  function 
category.  
In the factorial design study 1275.1(pooled), about half of the patients had normal renal function and the other 
half had mild renal impairment at baseline. Demographic data were overall similar between subgroups. The 
frequency  of  patients  with  all  types  of  adverse  events  was  not  obviously  affected  by  the  renal  function 
category. 
Geographical region 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the following regions: Africa/Middle East, Asia, Europe, Latin America, 
and North America.  
Study  1275.9  included  patients  from  all  regions  except  Africa.  Study  1275.10  included  only  patients  from 
Europe and North and Latin America. Patients from Europe and Latin America had overall a higher frequency 
of  adverse  events  than  patients  from  Asia  and  North  America  in  Study  1275.9,  whereas  there  was  no 
difference in the frequency of adverse events in study 1275.10. For the other types of adverse events, there 
was no clear trend towards a difference between regions in either study. 
Study  1275.1(pooled)  included  patients  from  all  regions  (North  America:  43.3%,  Europe:  26.6%,  Latin 
America:  17.9%,  Asia:  8.7%,  and  Africa/Middle  East:  3.5%).  For  all  types of  adverse  events,  there  was  no 
clear trend towards a difference between regions.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  drug-drug  interaction  (study  1245.30)  and  FDC  empa/lina  food  interaction 
(study 1275.3) are described in detail in the clinical pharmacology section. 
There was no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between empagliflozin and linagliptin, and there 
was  no  clinically  relevant  effect  of  a  high-fat,  high-caloric  meal  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  the  FDC 
empa/lina. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study medication 
The frequency of patients with adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study medication was 
<7% and similar across treatment groups in all studies.  
Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study medication in the Phase III studies 
The  frequency  of  patients  with  adverse  events  leading  to  premature  discontinuation  of  study  medication  in 
the  Phase  III  studies  was  <7%  and  similar  across  all  treatment  groups.  At  PT  level,  each  adverse  event 
leading  to  premature  discontinuation  of  study  medication  was  reported  for  not  more  than  1  patient  (0  to 
0.9%) per treatment group in the add-on studies 1275.9 and 1275.10. 
In study 1275.9, none of the patients in the empagliflozin 25 mg (add-on to linagliptin 5 mg and metformin) 
group, 2 patients (1.8%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg (add-on to linagliptin 5 mg and metformin) group and 2 
patients (1.8%) in the placebo (add-on to linagliptin 5 mg and metformin) group were reported with adverse 
events leading to premature discontinuation of study medication. 
In study 1275.10, 3 patients (2.7%) in the linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin 25 mg and metformin), 
3  patients  (2.7%)  in  the placebo  (add-on  to empagliflozin  25  mg  and  metformin),  4  patients  (3.2%) in  the 
linagliptin 5 mg (add-on to empagliflozin 10 mg and metformin), and 3 patients (2.3%) in the placebo (add-
on  to  empagliflozin  10  mg  and  metformin)  group  were  reported  with  adverse  events  leading  to  premature 
discontinuation of study medication. 
In  study  1275.1(met),  3  patients  (2.2%)  in  the  empagliflozin  25  mg/linagliptin  5  mg,  4  patients  (2.8%)  in 
the empagliflozin 25 mg, 2 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg/ linagliptin 5 mg, 9 patients (6.4%) in 
the  empagliflozin  10  mg,  and  4  patients  (3.0%)  in  the  linagliptin  5  mg  group  (all  treatments  as  add-on  to 
metformin) were reported with adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study medication. At 
PT level, each adverse event leading to premature discontinuation of study medication was reported for not 
more  than  1  patient  (0  to  0.8%)  per  treatment  group,  except  for  increased  blood  creatinine  (2  patients 
[1.5%] in the empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg [add-on to metformin] group). 
In study 1275.1(naïve), 9 patients (6.6%) in the empagliflozin 25 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, 5 patients (3.7%) in 
the empagliflozin 25 mg, 8 patients (5.9%) in the empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg, 7 patients (5.2%) in 
the  empagliflozin  10  mg,  and  2  patients  (1.5%)  in  the  linagliptin  5  mg  group  were  reported  with  adverse 
events leading to premature discontinuation of study medication. At PT level, each adverse event leading to 
premature  discontinuation  of  study  medication  was  reported  for  not  more  than  1  patient  (0  to  0.7%)  per 
treatment group, except for pollakiuria (2 patients [1.5%] in the empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg group), 
lipase increased (2 patients [1.5%] in the empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg group), weight decreased (2 
patients [1.5%] in the empagliflozin 25 mg group), and depression (2 patients [1.5%] in the empagliflozin 10 
mg group).

Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study medication in the Phase I studies 
In  study  1275.3,  1  subject  discontinued  the  study  after  the  second  treatment  period  due  to  severe  nausea 
and  moderate  vomiting  in  2  treatment  periods  (treatment  with  the  normal  dissolution  and  slow  dissolution 
tablets). The adverse events were not considered as leading to treatment discontinuation by the investigator, 
as the treatment in a single-dose administration study could not be discontinued or reduced in dose. 
No subject discontinued the study medication in study 1245.30. 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available for the empagliflozin/linagliptin FDC.

The  safety  assessment  of  empagliflozin  combined  with  linagliptin  was  based  on  data  from  the  3  Phase  III 
clinical  studies,  of  whom  1496  patients  had  ongoing  metformin  therapy  and  677  were  treatment-naïve. 
Overall, 810 patients were treated for up to 24 weeks in the add-on studies and 1363 patients were treated 
for up to 52 weeks in the factorial design study. The number of treated patients is acceptable. The number of 
patients  >65  years  was  relatively  low.  Almost  no  patients  >75  years  and  no  patients  >  85  years  were 
included in the FDC empa/lina groups. This is now reflected in the SmPC. 
On average, 11% of the empa/lina treated patients prematurely discontinued from study medication in the 3 
Phase III studies which is considered acceptable for 24-week and 52-week studies in a chronic indication. No 
clear  differences  in  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  observed  between  the  different  treatments;  the  most 
common reasons were adverse events and patients being lost to follow-up.  
For  most  PTs,  overall,  the  frequencies  of  AEs  were  quite  balanced  between  treatment  groups,  and  the 
common AEs were generally consistent with the known safety profiles of empa and lina. When the 3 Phase III 
studies  are  pooled,  the  3  most  frequently  reported  AEs  for  empa/lina  were  UTIs  (8.8%),  nasopharyngitis 
(5.3%) and URTIs (4.4%). 
In  patients  with  normal  renal  function  or  mild  renal  impairment,  both  empagliflozin  as  add-on  to  linagliptin 
and  metformin  background  therapy  and  linagliptin  as  add-on  to  empagliflozin  and  metformin  background 
therapy  were  well  tolerated.  The  frequencies  of  patients  with  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  were 
generally similar across treatment groups in all studies. In the add-on studies 1275.9 and 1275.10, an overall 
lower proportion of patients was reported with adverse events in the empagliflozin (add-on to linagliptin and 
metformin) and linagliptin (add-on to empagliflozin and metformin) groups than in the corresponding placebo 
groups. In the study 1275.1 patient population, the frequencies of patients reported with at least 1 adverse 
event on-treatment were similar in the 5 treatment groups. 
The  frequencies  of  patients  with  serious  adverse  events  were  lower  in  the  empagliflozin  or  linagliptin 
treatment groups than in the corresponding placebo groups in the add-on studies 1275.9 and 1275.10, and 
similar across treatment groups in the factorial design study 1275.1  
In  the  present  Phase  III  studies,  the  frequency  of  patients  with  confirmed  hypoglycaemic  events  was  low. 
However,  when  taken  together  with  sulphonylurea,  both  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  are  associated  with 
hypoglycaemia.  In  the  present  studies,  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  were  not  investigated  in  combination 
with  sulphonylurea.  It  is  not  likely  that  combination  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  with  sulfonylurea  or 
Assessment report

Page 93/107 
  
  
 
insulin  will  lead  to  an  additionally  increased  risk of  hypoglycaemia  because  both  components  do  not  further 
reduce glucose in a hypoglycaemic state.. 
In the SmPC for both linagliptin and empagliflozin, a reduction of the SU dose is recommended when adding 
these treatments. Based on the MOA and the data provided, no added safety concerns of hypoglycaemia are 
to be expected when linagliptin and empagliflozin are used together. 
Despite  the  overall  higher  frequency  of  patients  with  genital  infections  for  empagliflozin  treatment,  severe, 
serious  genital  infection  events,  or  discontinuations  of  study  medication  were  rare.  Only  3  patients  were 
reported  with  pancreatitis,  but  these  three  patients  were  all  treated  with  linagliptin  (or  a  combination  of 
linagliptin with empagliflozin). Treatment with linagliptin was associated with small increases in lipase, which 
is now reflected in the SmPC. Pancreatitis is identified as a possible risk with DPP-4 inhibitors. 
Treatment  with  empagliflozin  as  add-on  to  linagliptin  on  a  metformin  background  or  with  the  FDC 
empagliflozin/linagliptin  in  patients  with  or  without  metformin  background  were  associated  with  small 
increases in haematocrit. This also is now reflected in the SmPC. 
There  were  small  increases  in  serum  lipids  with  empagliflozin,  which  is  now  reflected  in  the  SmPC. 
Importantly,  in  the  empa-reg  cardiovascular  outcome  trial,  there  was  a  decreased  cardiovascular  risk  with 
empagliflozin, but the cardiovascular effects of linagliptin are unknown.  
The  frequencies  of  patients  with  decreased  renal  function  adverse  events  were  small  and  similar  for  all 
groups.  The  frequency  of  patients  reported  with  hepatic  adverse  events  or  relevant  laboratory  findings  was 
generally low and comparable across all treatment groups in each study, except for lipase, haematocrit and 
serum lipids. Although the overall number of patients with hepatic injury in the empa/lina treatment groups 
was  low  (5  empa/lina  patients,  all  on  metformin  background  treatment),  it  is  retained  as  an  important 
potential  risk  for  the  FDC  empa/lina  in  the  RMP  as  it  was  for  the  monocomponent  empa.  There  was  no 
clinically  relevant  difference  in  the  frequencies  of  patients  reported  with  urinary  tract  infection  across 
treatment groups in each study. 
There were no new signals with respect to hypersensitivity reactions, malignancy, volume depletion or bone 
fracture.  The  incidences  of  venous  embolic  and  thrombotic  events,  cardiac  failure,  increased  urination  and 
skin reaction were low, with no relevant differences between groups.  
There  were  no  cases  of  diabetic  ketoacidosis in  the  phase  3  program.  However,  following  the  review  of the 
risk  of  diabetic  ketoacidosis  with  SGLT-2  inhibitors  in  a  referral  under  Article  20  of  regulation  EU  nr 
726/2006, the final outcome of this referral (i.e. inclusion of DKA as an adverse event in SmPC section 4.8 
with cross-reference to a warning in section 4.4 to inform physicians and patients of the possible occurrence 
of  atypical  DKA  together  with  the  symptoms  and  risk  factors  to  consider  and  corresponding  recommended 
actions) was implemented in the product information of Glyxambi. 
There were no relevant effects of gender, race and renal function on adverse events. 
Safety issues in the context of post-marketing surveillance should be taken into account.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  metformin  background  therapy,  treatment  with  the  add-on 
therapy  of  empagliflozin  to  the  DPP-4  inhibitor  linagliptin  or  linagliptin  to  the  SGLT-2  inhibitor  empagliflozin 
was  well  tolerated  and  the  safety  profiles  were  generally  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profiles  of  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 94/107 
  
  
individual components. In patients uncontrolled on metformin monotherapy the addition of the FDC was well 
tolerated, with similar safety profiles to the individual components.  
In  general,  the  FDC  empa/lina  is  tolerated  reasonably  well  and  the  3  most  frequently  reported  AEs  for 
empa/lina were UTIs, nasopharyngitis and URTIs. 
The safety profile of the FDC empa/lina is overall similar to the ones of the monocomponents.  
Some adverse effects emerged from assessment of the analysis of the 3 Phase III studies: the common AE 
and  laboratory  value  increased  lipase,  as  well  as  the  increases  in  haematocrit  and  serum  lipids.  These 
adverse effects are now adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Furthermore, the product information of GLYXAMBI reflects the final conclusions of the Article 20 referral for 
the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis with the SGLT2-inhibitors.

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Glyxambi (empagliflozin / linagliptin) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The Applicant is applying for a marketing authorisation for the fixed dose combination (FDC) of empagliflozin 
(a sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter-2 [SGLT-2] inhibitor) and linagliptin (a dipeptidylpeptidase [DPP-
4] inhibitor) for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
The wording of the indication initially proposed by the Applicant was that the FDC is indicated in adults with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control: 
•  when diet and exercise, plus metformin and a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor do 
not provide adequate glycaemic control, 
•  when diet and exercise, plus metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP
4) inhibitor do not provide 
adequate glycaemic control, 
‐
•  when already being treated with the free combination of empagliflozin (or another SGLT-2 inhibitor) 
and linagliptin (or another DPP-4 inhibitor). 
Two  dose  strengths  have  been  developed  for  the  FDC  empagliflozin/linagliptin:  FDC  empagliflozin  25 
mg/linagliptin 5 mg (FDC empa 25/lina 5) and FDC empagliflozin 10 mg/linagliptin 5 mg (FDC empa 10/lina 
5).  Pharmacokinetic  studies  demonstrated  that  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  can  be  coadministered  without 
any dose adjustment. In addition, bioequivalence of the FDC and the individual components was established. 
The clinical development programme for the FDC empa/lina consists of three pivotal studies in patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus: two add-on studies (1275.9 and 1275.10) and one factorial design study (1275.1). 
Previously,  complete  development  programs  including  several  Phase  III  studies  were  conducted  for 
empagliflozin and linagliptin as monocomponents and supported the approval of both drugs for the treatment 
of type 2 diabetes. 
The two Phase III add-on studies investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of empagliflozin as add-on 
therapy  to the  DPP-4 inhibitor  linagliptin  (study  1275.9)  and  of linagliptin  as  add-on  therapy to the  SGLT-2 
inhibitor  empagliflozin  (study  1275.10)  in  patients with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  and  metformin  background 
medication. In the factorial design study, patients were randomised into 5 treatment groups:  empa 25/lina 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 101/107 
  
  
5, empa 10/lina 5, empa 25, empa 10, and lina 5 (1275.1). The superiority of each FDC was tested against 
its respective individual components. 
A total of 1468 patients contributed to the analyses of efficacy (number of patients in the full analysis set). Of 
these, 1005 patients were treated with the actual fixed dose combination of empagliflozin (25 mg or 10 mg) 
and linagliptin (5 mg).  
Combined  empagliflozin  and 
linagliptin  therapy  with  metformin  background  was  associated  with 
improvements  in  HbA1c  that  were  statistically  larger  than  therapy  with  one  of  the  monocomponents.  The 
treatment  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  top  of  linagliptin  was  -0.70%  for  empa  25  and  -0.79%  for  empa  10 
(study 1275.9). The treatment effects of linagliptin on top of empagliflozin were -0.47% on top of empa 25 
mg  and  -0.32%  on  top  of  empa  10  mg  (1275.10).  In  the  factorial  design  study  with  FDC  and  individual 
components (study 1275.1), the difference between the FDC and monotherapy with linagliptin ranged from -
0.39% to -0.57%. The difference between the FDC and monotherapy with empagliflozin ranged from -0.14% 
to -0.58%.  
In general, the results for changes in FPG were consistent with the results for the changes in HbA1c.  
Empagliflozin  was  associated  with  reductions  in  body  weight.  In  study  1275.9,  the  placebo-adjusted  mean 
change in body weight was -2.22 kg for empa 25 and -2.77 kg for empa 10. As could be expected based on 
linagliptin's  mechanism  of  action,  linagliptin  in  combination  with  empagliflozin  in  study  1275.10  was  not 
associated  with  statistically  significant  changes  in  body  weight  in  comparison  to  placebo.  In  factorial  design 
study 1275.01, empagliflozin was associated with weight loss (ranging from -1.22 to -2.30 kg), but linagliptin 
was not associated with weight loss.  
In  study  1275.9,  empagliflozin  25  mg  and  10  mg  add-on  to  linagliptin  and  metformin  provided  small 
reductions  in  blood  pressure  after  24  weeks  of  treatment  compared  with  placebo,  (SBP:  -2.6  and  -1.3 
mmHg; DBP -1.1 and -0.1 respectively). In study 1275.10, linagliptin add-on to empagliflozin (25 mg and 10 
mg) and metformin provided no reductions in systolic or diastolic blood pressure after 24 weeks of treatment 
compared  with  placebo.  In  the  factorial  design  study  1275.1,  there  were  similar  reductions  in  both  systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure in the FDC and empagliflozin groups. There were no changes in blood pressure 
with linagliptin treatment.  
In general, in study 1275.1, the effects after 52 weeks were in line with the findings after 24 weeks. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
As  described  above,  the  treatment  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  top  of  linagliptin  was  clinically  relevant. 
However,  treatment  effects  of  linagliptin  on  top  of  empagliflozin  were  smaller  (1275.10;  (-0.47%  on  top  of 
empa 25 mg and -0.32% on top of empa 10 mg).  
In patients that are treated with metformin, the benefits of concomitant add-on treatment with linagliptin and 
empagliflozin vs sequential add-on treatment in terms of glucose lowering effect have not been investigated.  
Switching  from  other  DPP4-inhibitors  and  SGLT2-inhibitors  to  empagliflozin/linagliptin  combination  therapy 
has not been studied. The MAH agreed with the CHMP that it is premature to conclude that it is appropriate 
to  extrapolate  between  members  of  the  classes.  The  Applicant  therefore  changed  the  wording  for  the 
indication.  During  the  further  assessment  the  CHMP  proposed  to  shorten  the  wording  of  the  indication  for 
more clarity; the Applicant adapted the indication as requested. 
Assessment report  
EMA/749639/2016 
Page 102/107 
  
  
The  treatment  effect  of  empagliflozin  on  top  of  linagliptin  was  -0.70%  (95% CI:  -0.93,  -0.46)  for  empa  25 
and -0.79% (95% CI: -1.02, -0.55) for empa 10. 
The study populations can be considered relatively representative of the target population. However, due to 
the fact that empagliflozin may not be initiated in patients with a GFR<60 ml/min, only a few patients with 
eGFR below 60 ml/min were included. In addition, very few subjects ≥ 75 years old were included.  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  assessment  of  empagliflozin  combined  with  linagliptin  was  based  on  data  from  the  3  Phase  III 
clinical  studies,  of  whom  1496  patients  had  ongoing  metformin  therapy  and  677  were  treatment-naïve. 
Overall, 810 patients were treated for up to 24 weeks in the add-on studies and 1363 patients were treated 
for up to 52 weeks in the factorial design study.  
In  patients  with  normal  renal  function  or  mild  renal  impairment,  both  empagliflozin  as  add-on  to  linagliptin 
and  metformin  background  therapy  and  linagliptin  as  add-on  to  empagliflozin  and  metformin  background 
therapy  were  well  tolerated.  The  frequencies  of  patients  with  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  were 
generally similar across treatment groups in all studies. In the add-on studies 1275.9 and 1275.10, an overall 
lower proportion of patients was reported with adverse events in the empagliflozin (add-on to linagliptin and 
metformin) and linagliptin (add-on to empagliflozin and metformin) groups than in the corresponding placebo 
groups. In the study 1275.1 patient population, the frequencies of patients reported with at least 1 adverse 
event on-treatment were similar in the 5 treatment groups. 
The  frequencies  of  patients  with  serious  adverse  events  were  lower  in  the  empagliflozin  or  linagliptin 
treatment groups than in the corresponding placebo groups in the add-on studies 1275.9 and 1275.10, and 
similar across treatment groups in the factorial design study 1275.1.  
The  frequencies  of  patients  with  decreased  renal  function  adverse  events  were  small  and  similar  for  all 
groups.  The  frequency  of  patients  reported  with  hepatic  adverse  events  or  relevant  laboratory  findings  was 
low and generally comparable across all treatment groups in each study, except for lipase, haematocrit and 
serum  lipids,  which  is  now  reflected  in  the  SmPC.  There  was  no  clinically  relevant  difference  in  the 
frequencies  of  patients  reported  with  urinary  tract  infection  across  treatment  groups  in  each  study.  Despite 
the  overall  higher  frequency  of  patients  with  genital  infections  for  empagliflozin  treatment,  severe,  serious 
genital infection  events,  or  discontinuations  of  study  medication  were  rare.  There  were  no  new  signals  with 
respect  to  hypersensitivity  reactions,  malignancy,  volume  depletion  or  bone  fracture.  The  incidences  of 
venous embolic and thrombotic events, cardiac failure, increased urination and skin reaction were low, with 
no relevant differences between groups.  
Three  patients  were  reported  with  pancreatitis  during  treatment  with  linagliptin  (or  a  combination  of 
linagliptin  with  empagliflozin).  No  patients  were  reported  with  pancreatitis  in  the  other  groups.  Treatment 
with linagliptin was associated with small increases in lipase.  
There were no relevant effects of gender, race and renal function on adverse events.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In  the  present  Phase  III  studies,  the  frequency  of  patients  with  confirmed  hypoglycaemic  events  was  low. 
However, when taken together with insulin or sulphonylurea, both empagliflozin and linagliptin are associated 
with  hypoglycaemia.  In  the  present  studies,  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  were  not  investigated  in 
combination  with  insulin  or  sulphonylurea.  It  is  not  likely  that  combination  of  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin 
with  sulfonylurea  will  lead  to  an  additionally  increased  risk  of  hypoglycaemia  because  both  components  do 
not  further  reduce  glucose  in  a  hypoglycaemic  state.  In  the  SmPC  for  both  linagliptin  and  empagliflozin,  a 
reduction  of  the  SU  dose  is  recommended  when  adding  these  treatments.  Based  on  the  MOA  and  the  data 
provided, no added safety concerns of hypoglycaemia are to be expected when linagliptin and empagliflozin 
are used together. 
Treatment  with  empagliflozin  as  add-on  to  linagliptin  on  a  metformin  background  or  with  the  FDC 
empagliflozin/linagliptin  in  patients  with  or  without  metformin  background  were  associated  with  small 
increases in haematocrit. 
There were small increases in serum lipids with empagliflozin. In the empa-reg cardiovascular outcome trial, 
a decreased cardiovascular risk with empagliflozin was observed, but the cardiovascular effects of linagliptin 
are unknown.  
There were no cases of diabetic ketoacidosis in the phase 3 program. However, a causal association between 
empagliflozin treatment and the development of DKA in T2DM patients cannot be ruled out. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Bioequivalence  of  the  FDC  with  the  monocomponents  and  the  individual  components  was  established.  No 
drug-drug-interactions  between  the  monocomponents  were  observed.  In  the  current  application,  the 
proposed  FDCs  have been  used  in the  clinical  studies,  and  thus  efficacy  and  safety  can  be  assessed  for the 
FDCs  themselves.  In  addition,  bioequivalence  allows  for  bridging  data  from  the  phase  3  studies  of  the 
individual components. 
Combined  empagliflozin  and  linagliptin  therapy  with  metformin  background  was  associated  with  relevant 
improvements  in  HbA1c  in  all  Phase  III  studies.  HbA1c  is  considered  an  important  endpoint.  Combination 
therapy was also associated with reductions in several important secondary endpoints (fasting glucose, body 
weight, blood pressure).  
With  FDC’s,  it  is  required  that  all  active  ingredients  contribute  to  the  product's  therapeutic  effect.  In 
combination  with  linagliptin,  empagliflozin  was  associated  with  modest,  but  clinically  relevant  reductions  in 
HbA1c.  In  addition,  empagliflozin  was  associated  with  reductions  in  fasting  glucose,  body  weight  and  blood 
pressure. The contribution of linagliptin to the FDC empa/lina was smaller. In combination with empagliflozin, 
effects of linagliptin on HbA1c varying between - 0.32% and -0.47% in the clinical add-on study when added 
to  10  and  25  of  empagliflozin,  respectively.  In  addition,  linagliptin  was  associated  with  small  or  absent 
reductions  in  fasting  glucose,  and  not  associated  with  reductions  in  body  weight  and  blood  pressure. 
However, the proportions of patients who achieved an HbA1c value of 7% or lower were clearly higher due to 
linagliptin.  In  addition,  in  the  factorial  design  study  1275.1(met),  the  treatment  differences  between  the 
combination of empagliflozin/linagliptin and empagliflozin monotherapy were acceptable.

In general, it is important that treatment with the add-on therapy of empagliflozin to linagliptin or linagliptin 
to  empagliflozin  was  well  tolerated  and  the  safety  profiles  were  generally  consistent  with  the  known  safety 
profiles of the individual components. In patients uncontrolled on metformin monotherapy, the addition of the 
FDC was well tolerated, with similar safety profiles to the individual components. 
Cardiovascular risk is important in the evaluation of glucose lowering medication. The long term effects of the 
FDC on cardiovascular risk are unknown.  
There were no cases of diabetic ketoacidosis in the phase 3 program.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Combined empagliflozin and linagliptin therapy with metformin background was associated with reductions in 
HbA1c in all Phase III studies. Treatment was well tolerated and the safety profiles were generally consistent 
with  the  known  safety  profiles  of  the  individual  components.  The  contribution  of  linagliptin  to  the  FDC 
empa/lina  was  less  than  that  of  empagliflozin  but  acceptable.  The  B/R  of  of  the  fixed  dose  combination  of 
linagliptin  and  empagliflozin  is  positive  as  sequential  add-on  treatment,  or  substitution  in  patients  already 
being treated with the free combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin. Combination with SU is acceptable. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
Only few patients ≥ 75 years old were included in the trial.  The limited experience in elderly is mentioned in 
the SmPC. Empagliflozin should not be initiated in subjects ≥75 years. 
Due to the fact that empagliflozin may not be initiated in patients with a GFR<60 ml/min, only a few patients 
with eGFR below 60 ml/min were included. In patients tolerating empagliflozin whose eGFR falls persistently 
below  60  ml/min,  the  dose  of  empagliflozin  should  be  adjusted  to  or  maintained  at  10  mg  once  daily. 
Although  formally  the  FDC  empagliflozin/linagliptin  has  not  been  investigated  in  patients  with  a  GFR<60 
ml/min it is obvious to keep the restriction of use of Glyxambi in patients with renal impairment in line with 
the  most  restrictive  SmPC  of  the  mono  components  –  empagliflozin.  The  long  term  effects  of  the  FDC  on 
cardiovascular risk are unknown. In the EMPA-REG cardiovascular outcome trial with empagliflozin, there was 
a decreased cardiovascular risk with empagliflozin, but this is under assessment by the CHMP in a separate 
variation.  The  cardiovascular  effects  of  linagliptin  are  unknown,  but  a  cardiovascular  outcome  trial  with 
linagliptin is ongoing. 
There were no cases of diabetic ketoacidosis in the phase 3 program. However, a causal association between 
empagliflozin treatment and the development of DKA in T2DM patients cannot be ruled out. The conclusions 
of  a  recent  referral  procedure  under  Article  20  of  Regulation  EU  no  726/2004  related  to  the  risk  of  keto-
acidosis for SGLT-2 inhibitors have been adequately reflected in the SmPC.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Glyxambi in the indication: 
Glyxambi, fixed dose combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin, is indicated in adults aged 18 years and 
older with type 2 diabetes mellitus:  
• 
to improve glycaemic control when metformin and/or sulphonylurea (SU) and one of the 
monocomponents of Glyxambi do not provide adequate glycaemic control 
•  when already being treated with the free combination of empagliflozin and linagliptin

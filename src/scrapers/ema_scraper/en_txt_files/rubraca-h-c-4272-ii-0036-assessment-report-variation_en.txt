2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 9/138 
 
 
 
Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer and the eighth leading cause of cancer death among 
women. In Europe, the estimated age standardised rate of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer cases in 
2020 is 15.5/100,000 and the mortality is 10.3/100,000 (ECIS 2020). 
Ovarian cancer is classified primarily as stages I to IV using the International Federation of 
Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system (NCCN 2022). More than two-thirds of patients are 
diagnosed at an advanced stage (FIGO stage III and IV) and these women have particularly poor 
outcomes. 
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) represents the majority of malignant ovarian neoplasms (about 90%). 
EOC has four main subtypes, including serous, endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell. The most 
common is serous carcinoma (about 70%). Grade is an additional prognostic determinant. Low grade 
(grade 1, well differentiated) serous ovarian carcinoma is considered a distinct type of disease 
compared with high grade (grade 2 and 3 – moderately and poorly differentiated) serous carcinoma 
based on a number of clinical and molecular features, thus serous ovarian cancer is now often referred 
to as either low grade (most grade 1 serous tumours) or high grade (most grade 2 or 3 serous 
tumours). 
Management 
First-line treatment of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer includes a combination of surgery and 
chemotherapy: either primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by adjuvant platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy (platinum plus a taxane) or neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy with 
subsequent interval debulking surgery followed by additional platinum-containing chemotherapy 
(NCCN 2022).  The goal of this approach is to minimise residual tumour to no visible residual disease, 
a major prognostic indicator for improved survival.  
Despite optimal upfront surgery and the administration of front-line platinum-taxane chemotherapy, 
approximately 70% of patients will relapse in the first 3 years and become largely incurable 
(Ledermann 2013). 
Maintenance therapy following a response to standard treatment provides an opportunity to extend the 
disease-free period. Three agents are currently approved for maintenance treatment in the first-line 
setting; the anti-angiogenesis inhibitor antibody bevacizumab and two poly (adenosine diphosphate 
[ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, olaparib (± bevacizumab) and niraparib.  
The anti-angiogenesis antibody, bevacizumab, given with chemotherapy in the first-line setting and 
then as maintenance showed significant improvements in PFS in two studies (GOG-0218 and ICON7), 
and as a result bevacizumab was incorporated into the standard of care for first-line ovarian cancer. 
However, this observed PFS benefit did not translate into an OS benefit. 
PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy was initially evaluated as a strategy for improving outcomes in 
recurrent, second-line and beyond, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In this setting, at least three 
randomised, double-blind studies have demonstrated statistically significant improvements in median 
progression free survival (mPFS) for PARP inhibitors when compared to placebo in their ITT populations 
regardless of BRCA1/2 mutation or HRD status. These are studies 19, NOVA and ARIEL3 for olaparib, 
niraparib and rucaparib, respectively. 
Following results observed in the second-line setting, PARP inhibitor switch maintenance therapy in 
ovarian cancer was evaluated in the first-line setting following cytoreductive surgery and platinum-
based chemotherapy. Both olaparib and niraparib are approved to be used as monotherapy in that 
setting based on observed statistically significant improvements in PFS compared to placebo. Of note, 
the use of olaparib as maintenance treatment in 1L is limited to BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer

patients, based on the results from the SOLO-1 study, while niraparib is approved for patients 
irrespective of HRD status, based on results from the PRIMA study. Main results from these two pivotal 
studies are outlined below. 
In the SOLO-1 study an improvement in PFS as assessed by the investigator (invPFS) was shown in 
patients with advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation who, after achieving a response 
following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, were treated with olaparib compared 
to those who received placebo (mPFS 56.0 versus 13.8 months; HR 0.33 [95% CI, 0.25-0.43]). 
In the PRIMA study a statistically significant improvement in PFS by BICR was observed with niraparib 
versus placebo in the HRD population (mPFS 21.9 versus 10.4 months; HR 0.43 [95% CI, 0.31-0.59; p 
< 0.001]), and in the overall unselected patient population (mPFS 13.8 versus 8.2 months; HR 0.62 
[95% CI, 0.50-0.76; p < 0.001]).  
In addition, olaparib in combination with bevacizumab is also indicated for maintenance treatment in 
1L of HRD positive ovarian cancer patients (defined by either a BRCA1/2 mutation and/or genomic 
instability). This approval was based on the results from the PAOLA-1 study where the combination of 
olaparib and bevacizumab demonstrated an improvement in invPFS over bevacizumab alone in the 
HRD population (mPFS 37.2 versus 17.7 months; HR 0.33 [95% CI, 0.25-0.45]) and in the overall 
unselected patient population (mPFS 22.1 versus 16.6 months; HR 0.59 [95% CI, 0.49-0.72; p < 
0.001]). However, in the 277 patients with HRD-negative tumours, the mPFS was 16.6 months in the 
olaparib and bevacizumab group and 16.2 months in the bevacizumab group (HR 1.00 [95% CI, 0.75-
1.35]) so the combination was only approved in HRD positive patients. 
Despite recent advances, there remains a significant need for improved treatment options in the first-
line setting for patients with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer. In this context, rucaparib can 
be an additional option to the treatment armamentarium. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Rucaparib (CO-338) is a small molecule inhibitor of poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose) 
polymerase (PARP)enzymes, including PARP-1, PARP-2, and PARP-3, which play a role in DNA repair. 
In the EU Rubraca is currently approved for the following indication: 
“As monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed 
high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response 
(complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy.” 
 The CHMP adopted the following indication: “As monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with advanced (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy.” 
The recommended dose is 600 mg Rubraca taken twice daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 
1,200 mg. This is the same as the currently approved dose in the second line maintenance setting (see 
Rubraca SmPC). 
For this new indication patients can continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity 
or completion of 2 years treatment.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP concerning the current procedure. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH provided an updated environmental risk assessment of rucaparib 200 mg, 250 mg and 300 
mg film-coated tablets addressing the following indication: “The maintenance treatment of adult 
patients with advanced (FIGO Stages III and IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to first-line platinum-based 
chemotherapy.” 
The recommended dose is 600 mg Rubraca taken twice daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 
1,200 mg. Patients should start the maintenance treatment with Rubraca no later than 8 weeks after 
completion of their final dose of the platinum containing regimen.  
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application.

2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  MAH  has  calculated  a  PECSURFACEWATER  in  compliance  with  the  guideline  on  the  environmental  risk 
assessment for rucaparib, due to the proposed extension of indication to include maintenance treatment 
of adult patients with advanced (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, 
or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy for Rubraca, based on interim results from study CO-338-087 (ATHENA). 
For this, the MAH has used an Fpen refined by the prevalence data for the disease in Latvia, which is the 
country that has the highest prevalence of ovarian cancer in the European Union according to GLOBOCAN 
of  the  IARC.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Questions  and  answers  on  ‘Guideline  on  the  environmental  risk 
assessment of medicinal products for human use’.  
The PECSURFACEWATER value for rucaparib was 0.0104 μg/L.  
. A Phase I (screening) and Phase II environmental risk assessment for rucaparib was evaluated 
previously (Environmental Risk Assessment version 3 (April 2019)), which was acceptable, and 
rucaparib is unlikely to pose a risk to the aquatic environment and does not present a risk to sediment-
dwelling organisms. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application which is acceptable. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of rucaparib.  
Considering the above data, rucaparib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The primary objective of the current analysis was to update the existing population pharmacokinetics 
(PopPK) model and characterize the exposure-response (ER) relationships for efficacy and safety for 
rucaparib 600 mg twice a day (BID) in the first-line maintenance setting in ATHENA-MONO.

This pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) report describes 2 of the 4 arms of the study ATHENA: 
Arm B (oral rucaparib + intravenous (IV) placebo) versus Arm D (oral placebo + IV placebo), that 
were part of the ATHENA-MONO comparison, i.e. rucaparib vs. placebo. The schema of the ATHENA-
MONO portion of the study is included in section 2.4.2 below.  
The objectives of this analyses were to: 
• Determine if the existing PopPK model adequately describes rucaparib pharmacokinetics (PK) from 
ATHENA-MONO and update the model as appropriate, if needed; 
• Characterize the rucaparib exposure-efficacy relationship; 
• Characterize the rucaparib exposure-safety relationship. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The data included in this analysis comprised of 500 randomised patients, with 400 randomised to receive 
rucaparib (Arm B) and 100 randomised to receive placebo (Arm D) for the ATHENA-MONO comparison. 
The remaining arms (Arms A and C) will be evaluated at a later date. 
The treatment phase consisted of 28-day treatment cycles. In Cycle 1, patients received treatment with 
oral rucaparib or placebo only, beginning on Day 1. Oral rucaparib or placebo was taken BID continuously 
thereafter. 
Oral study drug was taken with or without food. Study drug treatment continued in 28-day cycles until 
24 months after initiating oral rucaparib/ IV placebo combination study treatment, disease progression, 
or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurred first. 
PK samples for rucaparib were collected approximately 12 hours after the last dose, but prior to the next 
dose (ie, within 1 hour). If dosing was held for toxicity or any other reason, PK sample was still collected 
at the end of treatment in Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 5. 
Population PK Model Development 
The population PK analysis was conducted with the following steps: 
1.  External validation of the final PK model (existing model) with the Study ATHENA-MONO dataset 
via prediction-corrected visual predictive check (VPC). 
2.  Estimation of individual post hoc PK parameters for Study ATHENA-MONO patients based on the 
existing PopPK model parameters (with MAXEVAL=0). 
3.  Evaluation of a study effect for Study ATHENA-MONO in the PopPK model. A study effect was 
tested on CL, central volume of distribution (Vc), and F1 in a univariate fashion with all other 
model parameters (THETAs, OMEGAs, and SIGMAs) 
Previous modelling experience 
A PopPK model was previously established using rucaparib PK data based on IV and oral data from Study 
1014, and oral data from Studies 10 and ARIEL2. The overall rucaparib PK was well described by a two-
compartment  model  with  sequential  zero-order  release,  first-order  absorption,  and  first-order 
elimination. The model structure and parameters are provided in Figure 1 and Table 2.

Table 2 Parameters of existing PopPK Model 
External  validation  of  the  model  with  sparsely  sampled  data  from  two  additional  studies  (ARIEL3  in 
second line maintenance patients, and TRITON2 and TRITON3 in mCRPC patients) showed no clinically 
meaningful differences in PK across indication or sex. 
Model development 
Model development was mostly based on a preliminary PopPK dataset. The final model was re-estimated 
using the final dataset. Changes in PK data between the two were minimal. The final dataset for PopPK 
model  development  included  1 482  observation  records  from  403  patients  treated  with  rucaparib  in 
ATHENA-MONO. The preliminary dataset included 1481 observation records from 403 patients. Of the 
1482 observations in the final dataset, 60 (4.05%) were BQL. In addition to the BQL observations, 103 
non-BQL samples collected more than 150 hours after dose were excluded from the analysis as potential

data errors, given the expected 36 hour half-life for rucaparib. An additional 1 record where the sample 
was missing and 19 outliers were also excluded. All data records excluded from the analysis were kept 
in the dataset and flagged for exclusion. 
After  the  exclusions  listed,  396  patients  with  at  least  one  adequately  documented  rucaparib  dose 
administration  and  at  least  one  non-BQL,  non-excluded  PopPK  concentration  after  the  dose  were 
evaluable  for  PopPK,  with  1299  observations.  A  summary  of  patients  and  observations  is  provided  in 
Table 3. 
Table 3 Number (%) of Subjects and Observations in the PopPK Population 
The median rucaparib concentration in ATHENA-MONO was similar to the medians observed in the OC 
maintenance and mCRPC study, and lower than the median observed in ARIEL2. Estimates of variability 
(coeficient of variation(CV)) were comparable across the four studies, and observed PK concentrations 
were largely overlapping. 
External Validation of the Existing PopPK Model 
The  ability  of  the  existing  model  to  describe  the  ATHENA-MONO  data  was  evaluated  by  prediction 
corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC). 
The VPC was plotted versus nominal time since first dose (Figure 2). The VPC was also plotted versus 
time after dose and stratified by PK sampling visit to allow more detailed evaluation of the time course 
of the post-dose samples (Figure 3 and Figure 4). 
The VPC as a function of Time from First Dose (Figure 2) shows that while the median ATHENA-MONO 
PK data were well described (i.e., the solid black line falls within the green shaded region), the variability 
was  overestimated  (i.e.,  the  dashed  lines  fall  outside  the  grey  shaded  regions).  When  plotted  as  a 
function of time after dose (Figure 3), the trends are similar; however, the variability at the 5th percentile 
(lower dashed line) is mostly contained within the appropriate grey shaded region. Trends are similar 
when stratified by study visit (Figure 4).

Additional Model Evaluation 
To address the potential misfit in the variance model observed in the external validation of run003, the 
residual error model parameters were re-estimated. Table 4provides a summary of the key steps in the 
model development process. 
Table 4 Summary of Key Models Evaluated 
When  the  additive  and  proportional  error  parameters  were  re-estimated,  the  OFV  of  the  model  was 
reduced by 414 points (run005). Model diagnostic plots also showed improvement in predictions at the 
highest exposures (Table 5). The additive residual error was reduced from 379 ng/mL to 200 ng/mL. 
The proportional residual error was reduced from 38.2% to 22.6%. 
Next,  study  effects  were  tested  separately  on  estimates  of  CL,  Vc,  and  F1  in  the  resulting  model.  All 
models  were  tested  with  existing  covariate  effects  fixed  and  random  effects  constrained  to  their 
estimates  for  the  existing  model  (run613).  A  comparison  of  relevant  model  parameter  estimates  is 
provided in Appendix A.5. Each study effect was estimated as a multiplicative effect on the parameter 
of interest. In each model, the study effect was statistically significant with p<0.001. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 21/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study effect on Vc (run013) was well estimated (multiplicative factor of 16.2, 95% CI 4.04 to 28.4); 
however,  the  resulting  estimate  of  Vc  was  very  large,  suggesting  a  substantial  increase  in  Vc  for  the 
ATHENA-MONO  population  (274  L  vs  16.9  L).  Given  that  post-dose  PK  samples  were  not  collected  in 
ATHENA-MONO,  thus  containing  little  information  of  central  volume,  the  study  effect  on  Vc  was  not 
accepted. 
The study effects on F1 (run014) and  CL (run012)  were also well estimated,  with estimates of 0.830 
(2.8% relative standard error (RSE)) for F1 and 1.11 (2.4% RSE) for CL. The 95% CI of the multipliers 
for  F1  and  CL  were  0.784  to  0.876  and  1.06  to  1.17,  respectively.  The  estimates  of  F1  and  CL  for 
ATHENA-MONO  were  30.9%  and  11.4  L/hr,  respectively,  compared  to  37.2%  and  10.3  L/hr  for  the 
existing PopPK model. Both of these effects were statistically significant and well estimated; however, 
neither  met  the  criteria  for  clinical  significance  (20%  change  in  the  typical  value).  Hence,  both  study 
effects were rejected. 
Run005  was  selected  as  the  preliminary  final  PopPK  model  for  ATHENA-MONO.  When  the  final  PopPK 
dataset  became  available,  the  analysis  dataset  was  used  to  re-estimate  the  preliminary  final  model 
(run005). Final residual error estimates for run102 were consistent with those from run005. The model 
parameters for run102 are provided in Table 5.

Figure 5 GOF Plots - Final Model 
The  ability  of  run102  to  describe  the  ATHENA-MONO  data  was  again  evaluated  by  pcVPC  (Figure  6). 
Similar to run005, the median of the observed data fell within the 95% simulated CI for the median. The 
position of the observed median on the lower edge of the CI suggests that although the model generally 
describes the central tendency, there may be a slight trend toward overprediction of the median trough 
concentration. The overprediction is consistent with the study effect on CL (run012) or F1 (run014), each 
of which was statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful. The 95th percentile of the observed

data also falls just below the corresponding 95% CI. However, the 5th percentile of the observed data 
falls  within  the  corresponding  95%  CI.  When  plotted  as  a  function  of  time  after  dose  (Figure  7),  the 
observed  median  and  5th  percentile  fall  within  the  corresponding  95%  CI  at  each  nominal  visit.  The 
overprediction of the 95th percentile of the observed data near 12 hours after dose persists across each 
nominal visit. Overall, the model describes the central tendency of the data reasonably well, but may 
overestimate the upper  end of variability. The re-estimated model (run102) was selected as the final 
model for this analysis.

Individual PK parameter estimates from the final re-estimated model (run102) were used to simulate 
exposures for the ER analyses of efficacy and safety.

2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-response 
All placebo and PK-evaluable rucaparib treated patients were included in the ER datasets for efficacy and 
safety.  Placebo  subjects  were  included  to  allow  assessment  of  the  magnitude  of  treatment  effects  in 
addition  to  rucaparib  exposure  effects.  Hence,  both  the  exposure-efficacy  and  the  exposure-safety 
analysis datasets included 506 patients, including 396 PK evaluable rucaparib patients and 110 placebo 
patients. 
Exposure  variables  were  calculated  from  individual  PK  parameter  estimates  from  the  population  PK 
analysis, the nominal dose and frequency, and actual dosing information. The steady-state daily area 
under the concentration vs. time curve at steady state (AUCss), minimum concentration at steady state 
(Cmin;ss), and maximum concentration at steady state (Cmax;ss) were calculated for each patient using 
standard  equations.  Placebo  patients  had  no  rucaparib  exposure,  i.e.,  AUCss  and  Cmax;ss  exposures 
were 0. 
To  account  for  dose  adjustments  and/or  dose  holds,  the  steady-state  average  PK  parameters  were 
calculated by multiplying the steady-state PK parameters by an average dose ratio. 
Efficacy analysis 
The exposure-efficacy analysis tested one endpoint: progression free survival (PFS) by RECIST v1.1 as 
assessed by the investigator. 
The invPFS endpoint was modeled using cox-regression. Efficacy covariates included the following 
variables: 
• HRD analysis group (tBRCA, non-tBRCA LOH high (+), non-tBRCA LOH low (-), and non-tBRCA LOH 
unknown) 
• Disease status post chemotherapy (no residual disease vs residual disease) 
• Time of surgery (primary vs interval debulking) 
Exposure-efficacy relationship 
Figure 8 shows the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curve for invPFS stratied by exposure quartiles. 
Although the difference between the placebo and rucaparib treated groups was found to be statistically 
significant, no significant ER relationships were detected within the range of rucaparib exposures.

Exposure-efficacy covariate effects 
Table 6 provides a summary of the linear exposure-response relationships for invPFS with or without 
adjustment for statistically significant covariates. The fits with no covariate adjustment are displayed 
graphically in Figure 8. 
As shown in Table 5, two of the tested covariates were found to be significant for both the treatment 
and ER model: HRD analysis group and time of surgery. Disease status post frontline treatment was 
not found to be significant. 
The covariate model parameter estimates for invPFS are provided in Table 7. For the HRD analysis group, 
all three non-tBRCA populations (LOH+, LOH-, and LOH Unknown) had increased relative risk compared 
to the tBRCA population. For time of surgery analysis group, the relative risk of progression was lower 
in the primary surgery group compared to the interval debulking group.

Impact of exposure on invPFS in current smokers and non-current smokers 
Exposure variables were calculated from individual pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter estimates from the 
final population PK (PopPK) model (run106). Parameter estimates were calculated based on the nominal 
dose and frequency and actual dosing information.  
Exploratory and exposure-response (ER) analyses evaluating the impact of exposure on invPFS in current 
smokers and non-current smokers (i.e., former smokers, patients who never smoked, and patients with

unknown smoking status) and exposure-efficacy relationships in each population were completed. Figure

smokers and non-current smokers.  
Figure 11 Kaplan-Meyer Curve for invPFS by Smoking Status in Rucaparib-Treated Subjects 
Figure 12 shows the KM curve stratified by both exposure and smoking status. Given the limited number 
of rucaparib-treated current smokers (N=25), exposures were categorized as above or below the median 
of the average steady-state area under the concentration-time curve (AUCavg,ss) in the subpopulation 
(i.e.,  smokers  vs  non-smokers),  rather  than  as  exposure  quartiles.  Subjects  in  the  placebo  arm  are 
included for comparison.

Table 8 Exposure-Efficacy Relationships by Population 
The impact of smoking status on the ER relationship in the full population was also evaluated by testing 
smoking status as a covariate on the intercept and on the slope of the relationship. As in the original 
analysis,  rucaparib  exposure  was  forced  into  the  model  regardless  of  statistical  significance.  No 
statistically  significant  relationships  were  identified  for  smoking  status  on  either  the  intercept  or  the 
slope of the relationship and no statistically significant ER relationships were observed (data not shown). 
Safety analysis 
The primary exposure-safety analysis tested treatment-emergent laboratory variables: 
• Grade 3+ alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase 
• Grade 3+ neutrophil decrease 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 30/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Grade 3+ platelet decrease 
• Grade 3+ leukocyte decrease 
• Grade 3+ hemoglobin decrease 
• hemoglobin maximum reduction from baseline 
• Grade 2+ creatinine increase 
Continuous endpoints (i.e., hemoglobin, maximum change from baseline) were modeled using linear or 
nonlinear regression. All other endpoints were binary and were modeled using linear logistic 
regression. 
Safety covariates included only HRD analysis group (tBRCA, non-tBRCA LOH high (+), non-tBRCA LOH 
low (-), and non-tBRCA LOH unknown). 
Models were compared to assess whether the exposure-response model provided a better fit to the 
data than the treatment effect model.  
Exposure-safety relationship 
Figure 13 and Figure 14 show ER relationships between ALT or creatinine and exposure and boxplots of 
exposure in patients with or without events, respectively. The incidences of Grade 3+ ALT and Grade 
2+ creatinine were greater in the rucaparib treated patients than in the placebo patients.

For Grade 3+ lymphocytes, Grade 3+ neutrophils, and Grade 3+ platelets, the relationship with average 
Cmax  is  not  statistically  significant  with  or  without  placebo  patients.  Consistent  with  the  logistic 
regression results, exposure estimates were not statistically different for patients with or without Grade 
3+ lymphocytes or Grade 3+ platelets. The average Cmax was statistically lower in patients with Grade 
3+ neutrophil events than in patients without Grade 3+ neutrophil events. 
Relationships between Grade 3+ white blood cell (WBC) events and average Cmax were not statistically 
significant  with  or  without  placebo  patients  and  the  average  Cmax  was  not  statistically  different  in 
patients with and without Grade 3+ WBC events. For Grade 3+ anemia, the relationship with exposure 
was  statistically  significant  with  placebo  patients,  but  was  not  significant  when  limited  to  rucaparib 
patients. The rucaparib treatment effect was predictive of Grade 3+ anemia, but the ER relationship was 
not.  Exposures  in  patients  with  Grade  3+  anemia  were  not  statistically  higher  than  patients  without 
Grade 3+ anemia. 
The nonlinear relationship between exposure and the maximum Hb change from baseline (CFB) was also 
statistically  significant,  as  shown  in  Figure  15.  Linear  and  maximal  response  (Emax)  models  were 
compared with and without placebo patients. The Emax model shown was selected over a linear model 
based  on  the  model  fit,  and  the  saturable  relationship  with  average  Cmax  was  confirmed  excluding 
placebo patients (Appendix A.11.8). The model fit shown estimated the concentration producing the half-
maximal response (EC50) to be 400 ng/mL (95% CI 106 to 1510 ng/mL), with an Emax of -2.94 g/dL 
(95% CI -3.84 to -2.04 g/dL) Hb CFB. Following 600 mg rucaparib BID, the median average Cmax was 
1370 ng/mL. At the median exposure, the mean maximum Hb CFB was -2.28 g/dL with the 5th to 95th 
percentile CI of -2.39 to -1.88 g/dL.

Exposure-safety covariate effects 
The impact of HRD on the intercept of the ER relationships with safety endpoints was also assessed. The 
effect of HRD was not statistically significant for any of the endpoints. Additionally, the inclusion of the 
covariate effect in the model did not increase the statistical significance of the ER relationship. 
Exposure-safety predicted effects

endpoint  with  a  statistically  significant  ER  relationship  was  estimated  at  the  median  average  Cmax 
following 600 mg rucaparib BID. 
The predicted incidence and 90% CI of Grade 2+ creatinine was 35.5% (31.7 to 39.7%). The predicted 
maximum Hb CFB at the median rucaparib Cmax was -2.28 g/dL (-2.39 to -1.88 g/dL).

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  update  include  data  from  the  ATHENA-MONO,  Arm  B  (oral  rucaparib  +  IV 
placebo) and Arm D (oral placebo + IV placebo). 
The final dataset for the current Population PK model development included 1482 observation records 
from 403 patients treated with rucaparib in ATHENA-MONO.  
PK  samples  of  rucaparib  below  the  lower  limit  of  quantification  (LLQ)  were  low  (3.89  %)  and  were 
excluded from the analysis. M1 method for handling BLQ-data is considered acceptable. 
The  population  PK  model  development  of  rucaparib  includes  the  re-use  of  the  PPK  model  previously 
established in the initial marketing authorisation application (EMEA/H/C/004272) based on a pool dataset 
from Study A4991014, Study 10, and ARIEL2 to support the treatment as monotherapy of patients with 
BRCA-mutated,  recurrent  ovarian  cancer.  The 
initial  PPK  model  was  retested  (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/0004272/II/0001)  to  support  the  second-line  maintenance  treatment  of  recurrent  ovarian 
cancer  with  data  form  Study  ARIEL3  (model  613).  However,  several  concerns  were  raised  regarding 
model  structure  and  variability  by  the  regulatory  authorities,  which  have  been  also  identified  in  the 
current  analysis  (model  misspecification  of  inter-individual  random  effects,  large  variability,  empirical 
and  confusing  covariate  effects).  The  model  was  updated  following  the  recommendations  (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/0004272/II/0002). The new model (2031a) provides a more rational description of rucaparib 
absorption, considering a saturable absorption through Michaelis-Menten kinetics and transit absorption 
compartments  following  first-order  kinetics,  which  represents  a  more  mechanistic  pharmacokinetic 
framework enabling the identification of complex absorption mechanisms that are affecting rucaparib. 
The Applicant states that the initial model was selected in this analysis because in the ATHENA-MONO 
there were not post-dose pharmacokinetic samples that could inform the semi-mechanistic absorption 
model and also because the benefit of a third compartment in this new model is minimal when no IV 
data  is  included.  Therefore,  the  use  of  this  model  could  lead  to  an  unstable  and  over-parameterized 
model, which is accepted.

Both  models  initial  and  new  were  re-estimated  using  the  ATHENA-MONO  dataset  with  all  parameters 
fixed other than the residual error to model 613 (run 102) and model 2031a (run 201), respectively. 
The minimal difference between the OFV revealed no statistical difference in model fit to the observed 
data. VPC showed that run102 (model 613) provides a better description of the data as the media 50% 
percentile  is  within  the  50%  simulated  percentile,  but  very  little  differences  in  longitudinal  PK  profile 
prediction were observed across both models. Furthermore, comparison of steady-state exposures from 
both  models  appear  to  be  similar.  Therefore,  the  overall  performance  of  the  updated  model  provides 
very similar performance compared to the initial model for the ATHENA-MONO dataset. 
The covariate analysis demonstrates the statistical significance of smoking status on CL and study effect 
on  F1.  A  drop  of  82  units  in  the  OFV  from  the  base  model  was  observed  when  both  covariates  were 
included in the population PK model. The Applicant justified the exclusion of the significant covariates 
(study effect on bioavailability and smoking status on clearance) due to several reasons. The study effect 
on bioavailability was removed based on the analysis plan established for the development of the original 
popPK  model  in  ovarian  cancer  (QS-CLV-006),  where  categorical  covariates  with  less  than  20% 
difference with the reference population value were removed. The rationale could be accepted.  
The impact of covariates was evaluated on simulated steady-state exposure metrics from the final model 
(AUC,ss,  Cmax,ss  and  Cmin,ss)  and  observed  Cmin  for  396  patients  from  the  ATHENA-MONO.  The 
covariates evaluated included patients demographics, smoking status, ECOG group, baseline albumin, 
disease  status  and  organ  function.  Based  on  the  graphical  evaluation,  relevant  PK  differences  due  to 
smoking status, age, albumin, creatinine clearance and renal impairment were observed. However, this 
simulation analysis does not represent a formal clinical relevance assessment because it does not allow 
to  understand  quantitatively  the  predicted  magnitude  of  change  associate  to  each  covariate  effect 
(without  including  inter-individual  random  effects)  over  exposure  endpoints.    Subsequently,  the 
Applicant provided a formal forest plot analysis including the covariates evaluated in order to understand 
whether differences in PK are expected. No clinically relevant changes in exposure were predicted due 
to  changes  in  albumin,  creatinine  clearance  and  study  effect.  However,  approximately  half  of  the 
exposure is expected in smoking vs non-smoking patients. 
The  exposure-response  analysis  included  506  patients,  including  396  PK  evaluable  rucaparib  patients 
and 110 placebo patients.  
In the efficacy analysis, the area under the concentration at steady state (AUCss) vs. time was calculated 
for each patient derived from the PPK analysis and the average exposure parameters were calculated 
based on actual doses. 
PFS  by  RECIST  v1.1  as  assessed  by  the  investigator  was  used  as  efficacy  outcome  in  the  exposure 
efficacy  analysis  which  is  endorsed.  No  statistically  significant  exposure-efficacy  relationship  was 
established. Kaplan-Meier curves stratified by exposure quartiles (Figure 8) showed that fourth quartile 
and  placebo  have  similar  invPFS,  however,  first,  second  and  third  quartiles  have  similar  and  longer 
invPFS. Same results were observed when patients were stratified by time of surgery, larger invPFS with 
lower  exposure  was  found  in  patients  in  primary  surgery.  Although,  it  seems  that  there  was  a  trend 
towards  rucaparib  exposure,  the  addition  of  an  exposure-response  relationship  in  the  Cox  regression 
analysis for invPFS was not statistically significant. Therefore, this trend could be  due to  confounding 
factor, patients who progressed quickly have less chances to have dose reductions and it could lead to 
misleading results. 
In order to investigate the impact of smoking status, the Rucaparib Pop PK model was updated and the 
statistically  significant  effect  of  smoking  status  on  CL  was  incorporated.  Subsequently,  exposure 
parameters (AUCavg,ss) were calculated from individual PK parameter estimates using the final model. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 35/138 
 
 
 
The  exploratory  exposure-efficacy  evaluating  the  effect  of  the  efficacy  variable  invPFS  over  time  and 
stratified by smoking status showed that the 95% confidence intervals of both curves overlap. Kaplan-
Meier  curves  stratified  as  above  or  below  the  median  of  AUVavg,ss  and  smoking  status  showed  no 
significant differences over the range of rucaparib exposures for the full population, current smokers or 
non-current smokers, similar to previous reported results with the full population. 
The exposure-efficacy relationships by population showed a statistically significant treatment effect for 
all  subjects  and  in  non-current  smokers  populations.  Although,  the  effect  on  the  smokers  population 
should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of subjects in the study. 
The MAH also evaluated the impact of smoking status as a covariate on the intercept and on the slope 
of the exposure-response relationship and no statistically significant relationship was identified. In spite 
of the fact that the data from this analysis has not been included in this submission. 
Taking  into  account  the  results  from  the  exploratory  and  exposure-response  analysis,  the  differences 
observed  in  exposure  in  smoking  patients  does  not  seem  to  impact  the  efficacy  profile  of  the  drug. 
Therefore, no dose adjustments seems to be necessary in this subgroup of patients. 
In the safety analysis, the maximum concentration at steady state (Cmax;ss) vs. time were calculated 
for each patient derived from the PPK analysis as the measure of exposure and the average exposure 
parameters were calculated. 
The  exposure-safety  analysis  demonstrated  statistically  significant  relationships  (p  <  0.05)  between 
Cmax,ss* and Grade 2+ creatinine increase and maximum Hb change from baseline even when rucaparib 
patients are evaluated alone.  The model-predicted incidences of 35.5% of grade 2 + creatinine and a 
change in Hb of -2.28 g/dL for the typical patient (50th percentile). Patients with higher exposure (95th 
percentile) would show a change in Hb >2.5 g/dL and incidences of >55% of grade 2+ creatinine. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical  pharmacology  properties  of  rucaparib  have  been  characterized  in  403  patients  treated  with 
rucaparib in ATHENA-MONO and are supportive of the extension of indication as monotherapy for the 
maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial 
ovarian,  fallopian  tube,  or  primary  peritoneal  cancer  who  are  in  response  (complete  or  partial)  to 
following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
In the ATHENA study rucaparib was administered at an initial dosage of 600 mg BID. This starting 
dosage of 600 mg BID rucaparib was selected as the recommended dose for Phase 2 and Phase 3 
studies based on safety, tolerability, overall PK, and the efficacy profile observed in Study CO-338-010 
(Study 10), which evaluated rucaparib as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumours. No 
new dose-finding studies have been conducted in conjunction with this application. 
This is the currently approved dosage for rucaparib in the maintenance setting.

2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
Title of Study 
Study CO-338-087 (ATHENA): A multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 
study in ovarian cancer patients evaluating Rucaparib and Nivolumab as maintenance treatment 
following response to front-line platinum-based chemotherapy 
Methods 
This is a randomised, multinational, double-blind, dual placebo-controlled, 4-arm, study evaluating 
rucaparib and nivolumab in combination and alone as maintenance therapy in newly diagnosed ovarian 
cancer patients who have completed first-line chemotherapy and who had a response. Only data for 
patients who were randomised to rucaparib monotherapy or placebo (ATHENA-MONO treatment 
comparison) were analysed and have been provided. This comparison was pre-planned. 
The study consisted of a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Post-treatment Phase. A schema 
of the ATHENA–MONO treatment comparison portion of the study is presented below in Figure 17. 
In the Screening Phase, patients underwent screening assessments, including submission of tumour 
tissue for determining BRCA mutation status and percent LOH, within 120 days prior to randomisation. 
Eligible patients were enrolled/randomised within 8 weeks of the first day of the last cycle of 
chemotherapy.

Treatments 
Patients in the ATHENA–MONO treatment comparison were randomised 4:1 to the following treatment 
arms: 
•  Arm B: oral rucaparib + IV placebo; or 
•  Arm D: oral placebo + IV placebo. 
Rucaparib was administered at an initial dosage of 600 mg. Rucaparib 600 mg, or matching placebo, 
was administered orally BID. IV placebo was administered via a 30 minute IV infusion (100 mL total 
volume per infusion) on Day 1 of every 28 day cycle, starting on Cycle 2. This regimen was selected to 
match the dosing regimen for nivolumab. 
In the Treatment Phase, patients received oral study treatment BID starting on C1D1 and IV placebo 
Q4W starting on C2D1 in continuous 28-day treatment cycles. Patients continued treatment until 24 
months after initiating IV placebo treatment in Arm B (oral rucaparib + IV placebo) or Arm D (oral 
placebo + IV placebo), disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurred first.  
If a patient receiving study drug met criteria for confirmed radiologic disease progression by RECIST 
v.1 criteria, but the patient continued to derive clinical benefit per the investigator, then continuation 
of treatment was permitted. 
Doses of oral study drug and/or IV study drug were interrupted or delayed for toxicity and other 
protocol-specified criteria. Dose reductions were permitted for oral study drug but not for IV study 
drug. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 40/138 
 
 
 
Patients were assessed for disease status per RECIST v1.1 by the investigator every 12 calendar 
weeks relative to C2D1 for the first 3 years and then every 24 weeks thereafter until objective 
radiological disease progression, as assessed by the investigator. All CT scans (and other imaging, as 
appropriate) performed during the treatment period and at treatment discontinuation were collected 
for and read by blinded independent central review (BICR). 
Patients who discontinued treatment for a reason other than disease progression or death continued to 
have tumour scans performed at 12 week intervals relative to C2D1 for the first 3 years and then 
every 24 weeks thereafter until objective radiological disease progression by RECIST v1.1, as assessed 
by the investigator, was documented. An optional tumour biopsy was collected from patients who 
experienced disease progression/randomised treatment discontinuation and provided appropriate 
consent. 
Patients were followed long-term for survival, subsequent treatments, and monitoring for secondary 
malignancy every 12 weeks (± 14 days) after SFU1 until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of 
consent, or study closure. If a patient began subsequent anticancer therapy, the sponsor terminated 
collection of SAEs, with the exception of the AESIs of MDS and AML.

Sample size 
Three separate comparisons of the treatment arms were planned to be evaluated independently in the 
original protocol: 
1.  Arm A (oral rucaparib + IV nivolumab) versus Arm B (oral rucaparib + IV placebo); 
2.  Arm A (oral rucaparib + IV nivolumab) versus Arm D (placebo [oral and IV]); and 
3.  Arm B (oral rucaparib + IV placebo) versus Arm D (placebo [oral and IV]). 
The level of statistical significance was to be split into 3 so that each of the above comparisons were 
made independently at a one-sided 0.0083 significance level. 
The table below provides the sample size and power for comparison 3 of Arm B (rucaparib 
monotherapy) to Arm D (placebo) for the tBRCA, HRD, and ITT Populations.

Table 9 Monotherapy Treatment Comparison: Arm B (oral rucaparib + IV placebo) vs Arm D 
(placebo [oral and IV]), randomisation allocation 4:1 
Based on the recently established standard of care of PARP inhibitor monotherapy in the first-line 
maintenance setting, the treatment comparison of Arm A (oral rucaparib + IV nivolumab) vs Arm D 
(placebo [oral and IV]) from the original protocol was no longer necessary. 
Therefore, the comparison of Arm A vs Arm D was moved from the primary endpoint to an exploratory 
endpoint leaving 2 separate comparisons ATHENA–MONO and ATHENA–COMBO, which were designed 
to be evaluated independently and at different time points based on the maturity of the respective 
study arms: 
•  ATHENA–MONO: Arm B (oral rucaparib + IV placebo) vs Arm D (placebo [oral and IV]); and 
•  ATHENA–COMBO: Arm A (oral rucaparib + IV nivolumab) vs Arm B (oral rucaparib + IV 
placebo). 
As such, in this amended protocol, the level of statistical significance was split into two so that each of 
the above comparisons were made at a one-sided 0.0125 (two-sided 0.025) significance level.  
The proposed timing of sufficient maturity for the monotherapy treatment comparison was assumed to 
be at as early as 15 months from the last patient randomised, and once approximately 60% of the 
events have occurred. 
The enrolment of tBRCA was lower than originally anticipated in the sample size assumptions in the 
original protocol. Thus, the monotherapy treatment comparison, comparing Arm B (oral rucaparib + IV 
placebo) versus Arm D (placebo [oral and IV]), started with the HRD analysis subpopulation, then ITT 
Population for the step-down hierarchical testing and the tBRCA population was explored as an 
exploratory endpoint.

Randomisation 
For the Double-Treatment Phase, eligible patients were randomised 4:1 to Arm B (oral rucaparib + IV 
placebo) or Arm D (placebo oral and IV). 
Randomisation occurred by a central randomisation procedure using an interactive response 
technology (IRT). The following were included as randomisation stratification factors at study entry to 
ensure treatment groups were balanced: 
•  HRD status (tBRCA, non-tBRCA LOH-high, non-tBRCA LOH-low, or non-tBRCA LOH-unknown) 
by central laboratory analysis. 
•  Disease status post-chemotherapy (residual disease vs no residual disease) 
• 
Timing of surgery (primary surgery vs interval debulking) 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind.  
Investigators and patients were blinded to study treatments, which for the full, 4-arm study included 
monotherapy and combination therapy with oral rucaparib and IV nivolumab, as well as matching 
placebos. To maintain the blind, patients received both an oral and an IV administration of study drug 
and/or placebo. 
Statistical methods 
 Populations analysed 
The following analysis populations were defined in the SAP for the ATHENA–MONO treatment 
comparison: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 44/138 
 
 
 
 
• 
ITT Population: The ITT Population consisted of all randomised patients. The ITT Population 
consisted of all mutually exclusive HRD status groups: tBRCA, non-tBRCA LOH-high, non-
tBRCA LOH-low, and non-tBRCA LOH-unknown. 
•  HRD Population: The HRD Population consisted of all randomised patients that were either 
tBRCA or non-tBRCA LOH-high. 
•  Safety Population: The Safety Population consisted of all patients who received at least 1 
dose of protocol-specified treatment of oral study drug. 
Efficacy analyses were analysed in the HRD and ITT Populations. All safety analyses were based on the 
Safety Population. Only patients who were randomised to Arm B (rucaparib monotherapy) and Arm D 
(placebo) are included in the analyses. 
In addition to the population definitions above, exploratory efficacy analyses were performed in 
subgroups including the mutually exclusive (non-nested) molecular subgroups within the ITT 
Population as outlined below. 
• 
tBRCA: Patient with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutation in tumour tissue;  
•  Non-tBRCA LOH-high: Patients without a tBRCA mutation and with percent of tumour 
genome LOH ≥ 16%; 
•  Non-tBRCA LOH-low: Patients without a tBRCA mutation and with percent of tumour genome 
LOH < 16%; and  
•  Non-tBRCA LOH-unknown: Patients without a tBRCA mutation and with percent of tumour 
genome LOH unknown. 
Efficacy analyses 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS as assessed by the investigator (invPFS). The time to invPFS 
was calculated in months as the time from randomisation to disease progression +1 day, as 
determined by RECIST v1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.  
Only scans or deaths prior to and on the start of any subsequent anticancer treatment were used in 
PFS analysis. Any deaths or progression events occurring within 2 missing expected scan assessments 
were included in the analysis. Two missed scans or visits was defined as a duration of 26 weeks (12 × 
2 + 2) for the first 3 years and 50 weeks (2 × 24 + 2), thereafter. Events occurring immediately after 
2 consecutive missed scans were censored as described below.  
The stratified log-rank test was the official test used for the hierarchical testing. In addition, the 
primary endpoint was also analysed using the stratified Cox proportional hazards methodology, 
presenting the hazard ratio with 95% CI between the randomised treatment groups. The 
randomisation stratification factors were included in the primary analysis of invPFS. 
Censoring rule: Any patients who did not experience an event of either disease progression or death 
were censored on the last on-study tumour assessment prior to start of any subsequent anticancer 
treatment. Any patient with an event of either disease progression or death following 2 or more missed 
expected consecutive scans was censored on the date of the last on-study tumour assessment prior to 
the gap in scan collection. If a patient did not have any on-study tumour assessments, then the 
patient was censored on the date of randomisation (ie, Day 1). 
Sensitivity analyses 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 45/138 
 
 
 
A sensitivity analysis of invPFS was performed using the actual supportive data from FMI’s NGS-based 
test and EDC to derive the randomisation strata groups: HRD status based on FMI’s NGS-based test; 
disease status (no residual disease vs residual disease post-chemotherapy) based on EDC data; and 
timing of surgery (primary surgery vs interval debulking) based on EDC data. 
Sensitivity analyses for invPFS were performed to evaluate the impact of censored patients. The 
following sensitivity analyses were performed: 
•  All scans and data: A sensitivity analysis was performed in which all tumour scans or death 
events were included for assessment of PFS even if the patient discontinued study treatment 
or initiated a subsequent anticancer therapy. This was in accordance to the EMA guidelines. 
•  Clinical progression or withdrawal: A sensitivity analysis was performed in which patients who 
discontinued oral study drug due to clinical progression or who withdrew consent from 
treatment were also considered events of invPFS on the date of the last dose of study drug. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints  
Following the primary endpoint, secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed in the HRD and ITT 
Populations in the following order in accordance with the hierarchical step-down procedure:  
1. OS  
2. ORR by RECIST v1.1 in patients with measurable disease at baseline. 
Overall survival was defined as the time from randomisation to death by any cause, and was calculated 
in months as the time from randomisation to death +1 day. Patients who had not died were censored 
on the date the patient was last known to be alive or last visit. Interim OS was analysed using the 
stratified Cox proportional hazards methodology and a stratified log-rank test. The stratified HR from 
the Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the HR between the randomised treatment 
groups. The stratified log-rank test was the official test used for the hierarchical testing.  
It was anticipated that the data for OS would be immature and thus heavily censored at the time of 
the primary endpoint analysis. In order to adjust for multiple analyses of OS at a later stage, a 
stopping rule was applied. The Haybittle-Peto stopping rule was applied where any interim (early) OS 
with a p-value < 0.001 could be used to claim superiority. This meant that a p-value < 0.025 two-
sided could still be utilized at the final analysis, which was projected to be once 70% of the death 
events had been collected. Any additional interim analyses of OS conducted was to be adjusted for at 
the time of final OS. 
The ORR as assessed by the investigator was analysed in the subgroup of patients who were response 
evaluable (ie, measurable target lesions) at baseline. The ORR of confirmed response by RECIST v1.1 
was summarized, and was defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed CR or PR on 
subsequent tumor assessment at least 28 days after first response documentation. The ORR was 
compared between treatments by using a chi-square test of proportions. 
The bicrPFS was evaluated as a stand-alone secondary endpoint and was not part of the hierarchical 
step-down procedure described. The bicrPFS was used as a supportive analysis to the primary 
endpoint. The secondary endpoint of DOR was also evaluated as a stand-alone secondary endpoint and 
was not part of the hierarchical step-down procedure. 
Multiple comparison/Multiplicity 
In order to preserve the overall type 1 error rate, the primary and key secondary endpoints for 
ATHENA-MONO were tested using a pre-specified hierarchical step-down procedure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 46/138 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint of invPFS and key secondary endpoints of OS and ORR were tested among the 
HRD Population first and then the ITT Population using a one-sided alpha of 0.0125 (two-sided alpha = 
0.025). That is, the invPFS in the HRD Population was tested first at a one-sided 0.0125 (two-sided p 
= 0.025) significance level. If invPFS in the HRD Population was statistically significant, then invPFS 
was tested in the ITT Population. If both the HRD and ITT Populations reached statistical significance 
for the primary endpoint, then the first secondary endpoint of OS was tested at the one-sided 0.0125 
(two-sided p = 0.025) significance level in the HRD and ITT Populations for that treatment comparison 
and testing continued to the last key secondary endpoint of ORR. Once statistical significance was not 
achieved for one test, the statistical significance was not declared for all subsequent analyses in the 
ordered step-down procedure for the comparison of the rucaparib arm to placebo.

Results 
Data are available from a total of 538 patients randomised to receive either rucaparib monotherapy 
(n = 427; Arm B: oral rucaparib + IV placebo [rucaparib]) or placebo (n = 111; Arm D: oral placebo + 
IV placebo [placebo]) for the ATHENA–MONO treatment comparison. 
Participant flow 
There were 538 patients randomised into the ATHENA–MONO treatment comparison (i.e. the ITT 
Population); 427 patients in the rucaparib group and 111 patients in the placebo group. Three patients 
who were randomised (rucaparib, n = 2; placebo, n = 1) discontinued prior to receiving any oral study 
drug. Therefore, the Safety Population consisted of 535 patients (99.4% of the ITT Population) who 
initiated treatment with either 600 mg BID rucaparib (n = 425) or placebo (n = 110). 
As of the visit cut-off, 111 patients (rucaparib, n = 101; placebo, n = 10) had completed treatment 
with oral study drug (24 months from the time of initiating IV placebo), 360 patients (rucaparib, n = 
271, placebo, n = 89) had discontinued treatment early, and 64 patients (rucaparib, n = 53; placebo, 
n = 11) were ongoing. The primary reason for early discontinuation of study drug, regardless of

treatment group, was disease progression (rucaparib, 175/427 [41.0%]; placebo, 72/111 [64.9%]).

HRD status 
Evidence of a deleterious BRCA (includes BRCA1 and BRCA2) mutation was determined from local or 
central genomic testing prior to randomisation. For central confirmation of deleterious BRCA mutations, 
tumour tissues were sent from the study sites directly to Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI; Cambridge, 
MA, US) for testing using the NGS-based Foundation One DX1 assay. Laboratory kits were made 
available via ICON Clinical Research, Ltd. (ICON; Farmingdale, NY, US). 
Patients were screened for BRCA mutation and percent LOH to determine HRD status, based on an 
archival tumour tissue sample or a screening biopsy prior to enrolment, by FMI’s NGS-based test. LOH 
of ≥ 16% was the pre-specified cut-off for inclusion in the non-tBRCA LOH-high subgroup. In addition, 
a central laboratory (Ambry Genetics) test result of a blood samples and/or a local test result of blood 
or buccal samples were used to determine germline and somatic BRCA mutation status using the 
CancerNext Expanded assay. 
A flow diagram illustrating patient disposition of the ITT Population based on HRD status (non-nested 
molecular subgroup) and BRCA mutation status is provided in Figure 20.

Results for ATHENA–MONO 
The tumour-based NGS-based test cannot distinguish whether a detected BRCA mutation is of 
germline or somatic origin; therefore, the NGS-based test results were compared to the central blood 
germline BRCA results in order to derive the BRCA mutation type used for analysis. A majority of the 
tBRCA patients (68/115 [59.1%]) were identified as having a germline BRCA mutation: 56 patients in 
the rucaparib group (56/91 [61.5%]) and 12 patients in the placebo group (12/24 [50.0%]). 
Approximately 30% of tBRCA patients in either treatment group were identified as having a somatic 
BRCA mutation. A smaller percentage of patients with a BRCA mutation as detected by the tumour 
NGS-based test were identified as having a BRCA mutation of unknown origin (14/115 [12.2%]) due to 
the lack of a central blood germline BRCA test result. 
Of the patients with a tBRCA mutation as detected by the NGS-based test (n = 115 overall), 75/115 
(65.2%) were designated as having a mutation in BRCA1 and 40/115 (34.8%) were designated as 
having a mutation in BRCA2, with similar incidences in either treatment group.

Recruitment 
Patients were randomised into the study from 01 October 2018 through 30 September 2020. The visit 
cut-off date of 23 March 2022 is approximately 1.5 years after the last patient was randomised. 
The 538 patients were recruited from 200 study sites in 24 countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, the 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, 
Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, the UK, and the 
US. This study is currently ongoing in 238 active sites across these 24 countries. 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol was dated 02 March 2018. As of 23 March 2022 cut-off date there have been 4 
global protocol amendments and 2 country-specific protocol addenda. There were also clarification 
memos regarding aspects of the study during the COVID-19 pandemic and classification of 
pneumonitis as an AESI.

Protocol deviations 
One patient (0.2%) in the rucaparib group had taken more than the prescribed dose leading to a major 
protocol deviation, with no observed safety issues due to the overdose. Six patients (1.4%) in the 
rucaparib group were given incorrect study drug during 1 treatment cycle. None of these incorrect drug 
administrations were associated with any observed safety issues. These six cases occurred at six 
unique sites across five countries.

Table 14 Important Protocol Deviations for ATHENA–MONO (ITT Population) 
In addition, one patient received treatment beyond the pre specified 2 years cap, following the treating 
investigator judgement that the patient was still deriving clinical benefit, and local requirement to 
provide treatment beyond the end of the study. This case is not reflected in Table 14 since the 
deviation reporting was pending at the time of the CSR.  
No pregnancies were reported. No patients were excluded from safety or efficacy analyses because of 
a protocol deviation.

Subsequent therapies 
At the time of the visit cut-off, the majority of patients were still being followed. There were 287/538 
patients (53.3%) in the ITT Population who initiated at least 1 regimen of subsequent anticancer 
therapy. Of these, 24/208 (11.5%) patients in the rucaparib group and 26/79 (32.9%) patients in the 
placebo group received subsequent PARP inhibitor therapy including olaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and 
rucaparib. Other subsequent anticancer therapy included liposomal doxorubicin/doxorubicin, 
bevacizumab, cisplatin, carboplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel.

Sensitivity analyses 
• 
invPFS Adjusted by Actual Stratification 
A sensitivity analysis of invPFS was performed using the actual supportive data in the eCRF for the 
corresponding stratification groups: HRD population: HR 0.49 [95% CI: 0.32, 0.75]; ITT population: 
HR 0.54 [95% CI: 0.41, 0.70]. 
• 
invPFS Adjusted to Evaluate the Impact of Censored Patients 
Sensitivity analyses for invPFS were performed to evaluate the impact of censored patients. 
A sensitivity analysis for invPFS was performed in which all scans and data were used for assessment 
of PFS even if the patient discontinued study treatment or initiated a subsequent anticancer therapy: 
HRD population: HR 0.48 [95% CI: 0.48 0.31, 0.73]; ITT population: HR 0.52 [95% CI: 0.40, 0.68]. 
A second sensitivity analysis of invPFS with respect to censoring was performed in which patients who 
discontinued oral study drug due to clinical progression or who withdrew consent from treatment were 
also considered events of invPFS on the date of the last dose of study drug: HRD population: HR 0.54 
[95% CI: 0.36, 0.81]; ITT population: HR 0.56 [95% CI: 0.44, 0.72].  
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
o  Overall survival (OS) 
The first secondary endpoint in the step-down multiple comparisons procedure was OS; however, due 
to the immaturity of these data at the time of the primary endpoint analysis (death events: HRD

Population, 37/234 [15.8%]; ITT Population, 133/538 [24.7%]), an interim analysis of OS was 
performed.  
For the HRD Population, the estimated KM probability of survival at 24 months was 85% for each 
treatment group.  
For all patients in the HRD Population, the median duration of follow-up was 26.0 months (95% CI, 
25.2-27.0) for rucaparib and 24.5 months (95% CI, 21.3-28.4) for placebo.

For the ITT Population, the estimated KM probability of survival at 24 months was 77% for each 
treatment group. For all patients in the ITT Population, the median duration of follow-up was 26.1 
months (95% CI, 25.8-26.9) for rucaparib and 26.2 months (95% CI, 24.0-27.7) for placebo.

o  Chemotherapy-free Interval (CFI) 
Data for CFI were heavily censored at the time of the visit cut-off for the primary endpoint analysis 
(HRD Population, 126/234 [53.8%]; ITT Population, 235/538 [43.7%]). For the HRD Population, the 
median CFI was 32.3 months (95% CI, 27.7-NR]) for rucaparib compared to 16.2 months (95% CI, 
11.8-28.3) for placebo (log-rank; p = 0.0005). The stratified Cox proportional hazards model was 
consistent with the log-rank results (HR 0.47 [95% CI, 0.30-0.72]; p < 0.0006). For the ITT 
Population, results of CFI were similar to those observed for the HRD Population (HR 0.52 [95% CI: 
0.40, 0.67]; Median was 25.4 months for rucaparib and 13.7 months for placebo). 
o  Time to First Subsequent Anticancer Treatment (TFST) 
The results for TFST are similar to those for CFI, including high censoring rates analysis (HRD 
Population, 126/234 [53.8%]; ITT Population, 235/538 [43.7%]). 
For the HRD Population, the stratified Cox proportional hazards model was consistent with the log-rank 
results (HR 0.47 [95% CI, 0.30-0.72]; p = 0.0006).

0.65 (95% CI, 0.37-1.14; p = 0.1341) by stratified Cox proportional hazards model. 
For the ITT Population, the median TSST was 37.5 months (95% CI, 30.6-NR) for rucaparib compared 
to 26.5 months (95% CI, 20.5-30.9) for placebo (log-rank, p = 0.0077), and the HR was 0.65 (95% 
CI, 0.48-0.89; p = 0.0073) by stratified Cox proportional hazards model. 
o  Time to Treatment Discontinuation of Oral Dose (TDT) 
For the HRD Population, the median TDT was 23.6 months (95% CI, 18.4-24.8) for rucaparib 
compared to 12.5 months (95% CI, 8.6-18.5) for placebo (log-rank, p = 0.0146). The stratified Cox 
proportional hazards model was consistent with the log-rank results (HR 0.64 [95% CI, 0.44-0.91]; p 
= 0.0140). For the ITT Population, the median TDT was 14.7 months (95% CI, 12.1-17.5) for 
rucaparib compared to 9.9 months (95% CI, 7.6-12.1) for placebo (log-rank, p = 0.0027). The 
stratified Cox proportional hazards model was consistent with the log-rank results (HR 0.71 [95% CI, 
0.56-0.89]; p = 0.0028). 
Updated PFS2, CFI, FST, TSST and TDT data (data cut-off of 09 March 2023) 
Updated interim PFS2, CFI, TFST, TSST, and TDT analyses were provided for the primary analysis 
populations, non-nested molecular subgroups, and the pooled subgroup of patients without a BRCA 
mutation (ITT minus tBRCA patients, n=423) using a data cut-off of 09 March 2023 with a side by side 
comparison of values.

•  Health-related QoL – FACT-O 
Health-related QoL as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Ovarian (FACT-O) 
was assessed at Screening, on Day 1 (Cycle 1 through Cycle 3, and Cycle 5), then every 12 weeks 
(aligning with CT scans) until treatment discontinuation or until the data cut-off for the primary 
analysis, whichever comes first. In addition, PRO assessments were performed at End of Treatment, 
and at the SFU1 (28-day Safety Follow-up) and the SFU2 (5-month Safety Follow-up) for all patients. 
The FACT-O subscales values and total score together with the TOI were calculated. A change of at 
least 10 points in the FACT-O TOI was considered as clinically relevant.  
The completion rates for FACT-O using either electronic or paper questionnaires were approximately 
90% in both treatment groups for the first 12 months of treatment. 
The mean change from baseline over time of FACT-O TOI is presented by treatment group for the ITT 
Population in Figure 37. Baseline scores were similar for all patients (mean [± StD] scores were 76.4 ± 
12.54 and 74.9 ± 13.79 for rucaparib and placebo, respectively). The mean (± StD) TOI scores ranged 
from 72.7 (± 13.50) to 78.9 (± 11.69) for rucaparib, and 72.4 (± 15.36) to 79.1 (± 7.19) for placebo,

while on-treatment, with higher scores indicating better HRQoL and clinically meaningful difference 
defined as ± 10 points. The mean (± StD) change from baseline ranged from -3.6 (± 10.48) to 3.1 (± 
11.52) for rucaparib and -1.3(± 9.22) to 5.5 (± 8.57) for placebo, and thus neither treatment group 
met criteria for a clinically meaningful change in FACT-O TOI scores. Mean change from baseline 
assessed by FACT-O was statistically significantly higher in placebo at Cycle 2 compared to rucaparib, 
and similar during all other time points on-treatment for the ITT Population.

o  Patient-reported Outcome of EQ-5D-5L 
The completion rates for EQ-5D-5L using either electronic or paper questionnaires were approximately 
90% in both treatment groups for the first 12 months of treatment. 
Baseline scores for EQ-5D-5L index (US) were similar for all patients (the mean [± StD] scores were 
0.86 [± 0.151] and 0.83 (± 0.207) for rucaparib and placebo, respectively). Mean (± StD) EQ-5D-5L 
index scores (US) ranged from 0.83 (± 0.183) to 0.87 (± 0.153) for rucaparib, and 0.79 (± 0.210) to 
0.90 (± 0.112) for placebo, while on-treatment. The mean (± StD) change from baseline for EQ-5D-5L 
index scores (US) ranged from -0.04 (± 0.186) to 0.02 (± 0.137) for rucaparib and -0.03 (± 0.175) to 
0.05 (± 0.185) for placebo. The EQ-5D-5L index analyses were done with both the US and UK 
population norms, and the results of both analyses were similar for the ITT Population. 
For the ITT Population, baseline scores for EQ-5D-5L VAS were also similar for all patients (mean [± 
StD] scores were 79.6 [± 14.38] and 78.7 (± 16.39) for rucaparib and placebo, respectively). The 
mean (± StD) EQ-5D-5L VAS scores ranged from 76.0 (± 17.77) to 83.6 (± 11.05) for rucaparib, and 
74.4 (± 17.69) to 80.5 (± 10.92) for placebo, while on treatment. The mean (± StD) change from 
baseline for EQ-5D-5L VAS scores ranged from -3.8 (± 17.12) to 3.7 (± 12.85) for rucaparib and -4.4 
(± 18.80) to 3.7 (± 15.72) for placebo. 
Patients treated with rucaparib did not show statistically significantly mean change from baseline for 
EQ-5D-5L index score and VAS score as compared to placebo for the ITT Population.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
The exploratory subgroup analyses of invPFS were analysed using the Cox proportional hazards 
methodology and a log-rank test. The HR from the Cox proportional hazards model was used to 
estimate the HR between the randomised treatment groups. In addition, an interaction test of the 
subgroup-by-treatment interaction term in the Cox proportional hazards model was done. 
For these exploratory subgroup analyses, no adjustments for multiple comparisons have been made 
and statistical significance refers to a nominal p-value < 0.025 for ATHENA–MONO. 
Figure 38 Forest Plot of invPFS by Demographics (ITT Population) 
The Cox proportional hazards model showed a statistically significant improvement in invPFS with 
rucaparib treatment compared to placebo in many of the demographic subgroups. The placebo arms in 
some of the demographic subgroups (Asian race, Asia region, and ≥ 75 years old) performed better 
than expected leading to higher HRs.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Currently approved treatment options in the (first-line) maintenance setting include bevacizumab, 
olaparib either as monotherapy (for BRCA mutated patients) or in combination with bevacizumab (for 
HRD positive patients), and niraparib (for all comers). The choice of placebo as comparator was 
justified by the lack of products approved in both EU and US at the time of protocol development and 
study start (March 2018). Bevacizumab was approved for maintenance treatment in the EU in January 
2011 and in the US in June 2018. Even if the use of bevacizumab may not have been widespread in all 
regions at the time when the study began, it could have been considered as a treatment option under 
discretion of investigator and according to local practice. Having said that, the choice of placebo as 
comparator is acknowledged. 
The study included newly diagnosed patients with advanced (FIGO III-IV), high-grade epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who had completed cytoreductive surgery, either 
prior to chemotherapy (primary surgery) or following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (interval debulking), 
and 4 to 8 cycles of first-line platinum-doublet chemotherapy with a response. Only patients with an 
ECOG 0 or 1 were included in the study. Any prior treatment for ovarian cancer, other than first-line 
chemotherapy was not allowed. The use of bevacizumab was allowed during the chemotherapy phase 
but not as maintenance treatment (i.e. between completion of the platinum regimen and initiation of 
study drug or during study treatment). Of note, palliative radiotherapy on lesions not considered target 
lesions for tumour evaluation was permitted during the study. There are several exclusion criteria that 
are the common ones of clinical trials with immunotherapy. 
Patients must have been randomised within 8 weeks of the first day of the last cycle of chemotherapy. 
All patients were tested for HRD status (i.e. BRCA mutation and LOH) prior to randomisation by a 
central laboratory using the NGS-based Foundation One DX1 assay. Patients with non-BRCA tumours 
were categorized in three HRD groups: non-tBRCA LOH-high (LOH ≥16%), non-tBRCA LOH-low (LOH 
< 16%), or non-tBRCA LOH-unknown. The choice of a cut-off of 16% was based on results of prior 
clinical trials with rucaparib and it was also used in the ARIEL3 study and considered acceptable at the 
time of assessment (EMEA/H/C/004272/II/0001). Moreover, since the FMI´s test does not allow the 
discrimination between somatic and germline mutations, a central germline blood test was carried out 
to identify germline and somatic BRCA mutations. 
In the ATHENA-MONO, patients were randomised to receive rucaparib 600 mg BID (plus IV placebo) or 
placebo (oral placebo + IV placebo). Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity or up to 24 months. The rucaparib duration of treatment was chosen to align with the duration 
of treatment for nivolumab (or IV placebo). Continuation of treatment after radiographic progression 
was permitted. Twenty-five (5.9%) patients in the rucaparib arm and 7 (6.3%) patients in the placebo 
arm received treatment beyond progression. Median duration of treatment was of 134 (range: 34, 
496) weeks in the rucaparib arm and 168 (range: 88, 552) weeks in the placebo arm. Considering the 
low number of patients, it is not expected that this could have had an impact on the efficacy results.  
Cross-over of patients from the placebo to the rucaparib arm was not allowed and patients in the 
placebo arm with disease progression were to be treated with appropriate therapy per standard clinical 
practice, including second-line chemotherapy.  
Randomisation was stratified by HRD status by central laboratory analysis (tBRCA, non-tBRCA LOH-
high, non-tBRCA LOH-low, or non-tBRCA LOH-unknown), disease status post-chemotherapy (residual 
disease vs no residual disease) and timing of surgery (primary surgery vs interval debulking).

The primary endpoint of the study was PFS by RECIST v1.1. as assessed by the investigator. PFS has 
been considered an acceptable primary endpoint in clinical trials in this setting provided that the 
treatment effect is large and clearly outweighs the toxicity of maintenance therapy (compared to no 
treatment). Considering the double-blind design of the study, PFS as assessed by the investigator is 
acceptable. Moreover, PFS by an independent central review (BICR) was a secondary endpoint of the 
study. Tumour responses were assessed using RECIST v1.1. Patients who met GCIG CA-125 criteria 
for disease progression had a radiologic assessment and were assessed by RECIST v1.1. 
OS and ORR by RECIST v1.1 in patients with measurable disease at baseline were key secondary 
endpoints. In the maintenance treatment setting being able to disregard a detrimental effect on 
survival is of particular relevance, even more considering that the comparator is placebo. DOR was 
another secondary endpoint. PFS2 was an exploratory endpoint. 
The primary PFS analysis was in accordance with FDA rules. In addition, two sensitivity analyses were 
conducted to evaluate the impact of censoring. 
The primary and key secondary endpoints were tested using a pre-specified hierarchical step-down 
procedure in order to preserve the overall type 1 error rate, among the HRD population (patients 
tBRCA and non-tBRCA LOH-high) first and then in the ITT population, using a one-sided alpha of 
0.0125. OS was the first key secondary endpoint to be tested. OS data provided so far are based on an 
interim analysis at the time of the final PFS analysis (planned at 60% maturity,). According to the SAP, 
the final analysis for OS is projected to be done once 70% of events have occurred. The MAH will 
submit the results of the final OS analysis as a PAES by Q4 2026 (see Annex II).  
The sample size estimations were based on PFS in the HRD and ITT populations and adjusted with 
protocol amendment 2. The sample size after amendment 2 (26 October 2020) was of 500 subjects for 
the ITT population and 205 for the HRD population with a power of 90% per population which is 
coherent with the simple size and power assumptions presented in the original protocol and 
amendment 1 (5 July 2018).  
There were 4 global amendments to the protocol. Amendment 2 (26 October 2020) introduced 
important changes including the removal of the tBRCA population from the step-down analysis, due to 
a lower than expected proportion of tBRCA patients enrolled in the study, resulting from the approval 
of other PARPi in this setting. Further, one of the original comparisons initially planned (i.e. rucaparib 
+ nivolumab vs placebo) was removed from the primary analysis to an exploratory endpoint analysis 
and therefore the alpha was split between the remaining 2 independent comparisons. Of note, at the 
time of amendment 2 almost all patients were already enrolled. In amendment 4 (29 November 2021) 
the MAH removed bicrPFS from the hierarchical step-down analysis and added it as a stand-alone 
secondary endpoint. This change was made following the request from the US FDA (since bicrPFS is 
supportive of the primary endpoint of invPFS). Overall, the amendments performed regarding the 
ATHENA-MONO comparison are justified and would not entail important methodological issues in the 
context of a double-blind study. 
The number of important protocol deviations was low and comparable between treatment arms (16 
[3.7%] rucaparib and 6 [5.4%] placebo). Of note, there was one patient that received treatment with 
rucaparib beyond the 24 months defined in the protocol. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 1611 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 544 were randomised to Arm A or C 
(ATHENA-COMBO) and 538 patients were randomised to receive either rucaparib (Arm B; n=427) or 
placebo (Arm D; n=111). The HRD population (i.e. tBRCA and non-BRCA LOH-high) was comprised of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 92/138 
 
 
 
234 patients (43.5%), of whom 115 (21.4%) were tBRCA and 119 (22.1%) were non-tBRCAhigh. 
Among patients with tBRCA mutation, the majority were BRCA1 (65%) and germline (59.1%).  
As per inclusion criteria all patients had high grade advanced disease (58% FIGO Stage IIIC and 
25.5% FIGO Stage IV). Since all patients included in the study had “high grade” disease, this has been 
reflected in the indication. Further, the fact that patients should have completed their first line 
platinum-based chemotherapy before starting their treatment with Rubraca has been explicitly 
reflected in the wording of the indication, in line with other PARP inhibitors approved in this treatment 
setting. 
As per protocol, all patients had received prior chemotherapy (platinum/taxane) treatment, with a 
median of 6 cycles (range: 4, 8), which is in line with current clinical practice. The vast majority 
received between 6 and 8 cycles (94%).  
Regarding the use of concomitant medications, ondansetron and omeprazole were administered at a 
higher percentage to patients in the rucaparib group as compared to placebo. 
In general, there was a higher use of concomitant medications in the rucaparib group, which is 
consistent with the AE profile. 
There were discrepancies for stratification factors between the randomisation stratification factors and 
the data collected (electronic data captured) but they were overall balanced between treatment arms. 
There were discrepancies in the HRD status in one patient, disease status post-chemotherapy in 51 
(9.5%) patients and timing of surgery in 12 (2.2%) patients. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis of invPFS 
using the actual supportive data in the eCRF showed consistent results to the primary efficacy analysis. 
Efficacy outcomes 
The data provided are based on a DCO of 23 March 2022, in addition, an updated analysis for OS, 
PFS2 and other exploratory endpoints (i.e. CFI, FST, TSST and TDT) with DCO 09 March 2023 was 
provided during the procedure. Of note, enrolment of patients was completed as of 30 September 
2020. 
The primary endpoint of the study (invPFS) was met, both in the HRD population (HR 0.47; 95% CI: 
0.31, 0.72) and the ITT population (HR 0.52; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.68), with early separation of the KM 
curves. The number of invPFS events in the ITT population was 53.9% in the rucaparib arm and 70.3% 
in the placebo arm (43.2% and 63.2%, respectively, in the HRD population), with a median follow-up 
of 26.1 months (95% CI, 25.8-26.9) for rucaparib and 26.2 months (95% CI, 24.0-27.7) for placebo. 
At the time of the DCO, 46.1% patients in the rucaparib arm and 29.7% in the placebo arm were 
censored, being the main reason for censoring treatment discontinuation but ongoing with no 
progression in LTFU (57.4% rucaparib vs 39.4% placebo). 
Exploratory analyses of non-nested molecular subgroups showed consistent results in patients with 
tBRCA (HR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.75), non-BRCA LOH-high (HR 0.58; 95% CI: 0.33, 1.01), non-
tBRCA low (HR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.95) and in those whose LOH status was unknown (HR 0.39; 
95% CI: 0.20, 0.78). In addition, results in the pooled subgroup of patients without a BRCA mutation 
(ITT minus tBRCA; n=423) also favoured the rucaparib arm (HR 0.59; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.78). As 
expected, the effect appears higher in the subgroup of tBRCA.  
Two sensitivity analysis of invPFS to evaluate the impact of censoring were provided. One in which all 
scans and data were considered for assessment and another one in which discontinuation due to 
clinical progression or withdrawal of consent were considered events. Both sensitivity analyses were 
consistent with the primary analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 93/138 
 
 
 
 
There were three patients with tumour assessments conducted outside of the protocol defined 
schedule. Results of a sensitivity analysis of invPFS with progression determined at the next scheduled 
scan have been provided and were consistent with the primary analysis. 
PFS by BICR (bicrPFS), which was a secondary endpoint in the study, showed consistent results in 
terms of benefit of rucaparib over placebo. There was concordance in PFS between the investigator 
and the BICR of 85%. However, there were differences in the reported PFS medians, with better 
results according to the BICR compared with the investigator, particularly in the rucaparib arm for the 
HRD and ITT populations. Of note, a similar pattern has been observed in previous trials with rucaparib 
(i.e. ARIEL3) and with other PARP inhibitors. 
Overall, subgroup analyses were consistent with the primary analysis. In the subgroup of very elderly 
patients (≥75 years) and Asian patients the benefit is less clear. However, these results may be 
attributed to low patient numbers within these subgroups, as well as imbalances in baseline prognostic 
factors. 
Moreover, a particularly higher efficacy is observed in the subgroup of Asian patients with placebo 
(20.2 months rucaparib vs 25.8 placebo). 
The first secondary endpoint to be analysed in the hierarchical step-down procedure was OS. 
However, at the time of interim analysis, with a median follow-up of around 26 months, the number of 
OS events was low, (i.e. 37 [15.8%] in the HRD population and 133 [24.7%] in the ITT population) 
and no differences in survival were observed between treatment arms in the HRD population (HR 0.97; 
95% CI: 0.43, 2.19) and ITT population (HR 0.96; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.47). No separation is observed in 
the KM curves. Of note, in the subgroup of tBRCA patients, expected to be those benefiting most from 
the treatment with PARP inhibitors, an unexpected HR for OS of 2.24 (95% CI: 0.39, 12.99) has been 
reported, evidencing the immaturity of OS data available, with wide CI. There were imbalances in 
baseline prognosis factors between treatment arms in favour of the placebo arm. The number of 
patients with R0 was 52.7% in the rucaparib arm vs. 70.8% in the placebo arm and the number of 
patients with Stage IIIC/IV was higher in the rucaparib arm (92.3% vs 83.3%). However, the 
proportion of patients with FIGO Stage IV was higher in the placebo arm (28.6% vs 50%), as well as 
the number of patients with ECOG 1 (23.1% rucaparib vs. 33.3% placebo) which somehow may favour 
the rucaparib arm. In addition, differences were observed in the proportion of patients that received 
bevacizumab (16.5% vs 8.3%). Whether these differences may explain the results in the tBRCA 
subgroup is difficult to ascertain with the available data. As noted above, interpretation of OS results is 
hampered by the immaturity of the data. As a consequence, a potential detrimental effect on OS in the 
overall population or specific subgroups could not be ruled out based on initially available data. 
Updated OS data were therefore requested during the assessment. The MAH provided updated OS data 
from an IA based on a data cut-off date of 9 March 2023, with 35% (186/538) of events reported. OS 
data have been provided for the ITT population, non-nested molecular subgroups and the subgroup of 
patients with non-BRCA mutation. At the time of this IA statistical significance was not reached, 
neither in the ITT population (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.58-1.17), nor in the HRD population (HR 0.84; 95% 
CI: 0.44, 1.58) although overall the HRs look better than in the previous IA. Similar trends are 
observed for the different populations analysed, with improved results compared with the previous 
DCO, although not statistically significant. As stated above, the final OS is expected to be performed 
when 70% of events are available. The MAH has committed to submit the final OS analysis by Q2 2027 
as a PAES (Annex II condition, PAES), in line with criterion stated in Article 1 paragraph 2.(a) of 
commission delegated regulation (EU) No 357/2014. 
Since OS did not reach statistical significance, ORR could not be formally tested. Of note, ORR was 
analysed in the subgroup of patients with measurable disease, which represents 10% of the patient

population. The ORR was higher in patients treated with rucaparib compared with placebo in both the 
HRD population (10/17 [58.8%] vs. 1/5 [20%]) and ITT population (20/41 [48.8%] vs. 1/11 [9.1%]). 
A similar pattern was observed in the tBRCA stratified subgroup. 
No statistically significant differences were observed in PFS2 (investigator), neither in the HRD 
population (HR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.46, 1.93), nor in the ITT population (HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.21). 
Data were immature at the time of analysis (20.5% events in the HRD population and 30.1% in the 
ITT population). 
Positive results in favour of the rucaparib arm were observed regarding other exploratory endpoints 
such as CFI, FST and TSST. 
Updated data for all the above-mentioned exploratory endpoints, i.e. PFS2, CFI, FST and TSST were 
submitted based on a data cut-off date of 9 March 2023. Regarding PFS2, although statistical 
significance was not reached, a trend in favour of the rucaparib arm was observed in the ITT (HR 0.84; 
95% CI: 0.63, 1.13) and HRD (HR 0.75; 95% CI: 0.46, 1.24) populations. Similar results were 
observed in the subgroup of tBRCA and non-BRCA, as well as non-nested molecular subgroups (Non-
tBRCA LOH-high and Non-tBRCA LOH-low). Positive results in favour of the rucaparib arm were also 
observed for CFI, TFST, TSST and TDT in all the populations analysed.   
Patients treated with rucaparib did not show statistically significantly mean change from baseline for 
EQ-5D-5L index score and VAS score as compared to placebo for the ITT Population.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Rucaparib has demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in invPFS when given as 
maintenance treatment in patients with newly diagnosed high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, 
or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
This said, interpretation of OS results is hampered by the immaturity of the data and it is therefore not 
possible to ascertain, based on currently available results, whether this prolongation of invPFS 
translates into an overall survival benefit, although a trend in favour of the rucaparib arm is observed. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy:  
Annex II.D Condition: PAES: In order to further investigate the efficacy of rucaparib monotherapy in  
the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or 
partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, the MAH should submit the 
final analysis of OS of the phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study CO-338-087. 
With a due date on 30 June 2027. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
The data provided aims to support the safety of rucaparib monotherapy in the maintenance treatment 
of adult patients with advanced EOC, FTC, or PPC who are in complete or partial response to first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The primary safety evaluation is based on the results from Study CO-338-087 (ATHENA), an ongoing, 
Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, dual placebo-controlled study of rucaparib as monotherapy and in 
Assessment report

combination with nivolumab in patients with newly diagnosed EOC, FTC, or PPC who have responded to 
their first-line treatment (surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy). Only data for patients in 
ATHENA who were randomized to rucaparib monotherapy or placebo (ATHENA-MONO treatment 
comparison) are presented. 
Adverse events (AE) data from ATHENA-MONO have also been integrated with the data from Studies 
CO-338-010 (Study 10), CO-338-17 (ARIEL2), CO-338-014 (ARIEL3), and CO-338-043 (ARIEL4), 
including patients with ovarian cancer who received treatment with at least one dose of oral study drug 
(rucaparib 600 mg BID or placebo as appropriate). 
Safety data from these five studies (referred to as the “Pooled Ovarian Cancer Safety Population” or 
only “the Pool”) are being used to support the comprehensive safety evaluation of rucaparib 
monotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer (N=1,594). 
Patient exposure 
Patients in ATHENA-MONO and the Pooled Ovarian Cancer Safety Population received study drug until 
confirmed radiologic disease progression as assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 criteria, 
unacceptable toxicity or inability to tolerate further treatment, loss to follow-up, death, or withdrawal 
of consent. In ATHENA-MONO, treatment of rucaparib was capped at 24 months after beginning IV 
placebo if none of these conditions was met.

Deaths 
In  ATHENA-MONO,  3  (0.7%)  patients  treated  with  rucaparib  experiencing  fatal  TEAEs.  The  cause  of 
death in one patient was reported as possible myocardial infarction or possible pulmonary embolism due 
to  pre-existing  comorbidities.  The  cause  of  death  in  another  patient  was  reported  as  multiple  organ 
failure associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. The death of the third patient was attributed to malignant 
neoplasm  progression.  No  TEAE  that  led  to  death  was  assessed  as  related  to  rucaparib  by  the 
investigator. No patients in the placebo group experienced a TEAE that led to death.

Table 40. Summary of primary cause of death (ITT Population) 
Other significant events (Adverse Events of Special Interest) 
Myelodysplastic syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia 
Myelodysplastic syndrome and AML are considered AESIs as these events have been observed in patients 
exposed to PARP inhibitors, including olaparib and niraparib, as well as to cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., 
platinum and anthracyclines) used for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Data are presented for MDS/AML 
reported in the Clovis-sponsored clinical development program, including 19 Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical 
studies of rucaparib alone or in combination with other cancer treatments in multiple solid tumour types 
as of 10 April 2022. 
In  approximately  3,025  patients  treated  with  rucaparib  (includes  patients  who  received  rucaparib  in 
ongoing  and  completed  studies,  but  excluding  investigator-initiated  trials),  there  were  33  patients 
(1.1%) who developed MDS or AML (including MDS transforming into AML), including during the long-
term follow-up. These included: 
•  Study 10 (n = 2): two patients with MDS; 
•  ARIEL3  (n  =  14):  five  patients  with  MDS,  including  one  case  of  refractory  anaemia  with  excess 
blasts; five patients with AML, and four patients with MDS transforming into AML; 
•  ARIEL2 (n = 7): five patients with MDS and two patients with AML; 
•  ARIEL4 (n = 7): six patients with MDS and one patient with AML; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 104/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  ATHENA (n = 3): one patient with MDS and one patient with AML in ATHENA-MONO, and one patient 
with MDS in ATHENA-COMBO (treatment blinded). 
For these 33 patients, the time to onset of the diagnosis of MDS/AML following the first dose of rucaparib 
ranged from 1.9 months to approximately 71.9 months. Fifteen patients (two patients from Study 10, 
two patients from ARIEL2, six patients from ARIEL3, three patients from ARIEL4, and two patients from 
ATHENA-MONO) had an event that occurred during treatment or during the 28-day safety follow up. 
Six patients in the placebo group in ARIEL3 developed MDS (n = 5) or AML (n = 1) more than 28 days 
after discontinuing placebo. 
In ATHENA, up to the DCO three events of MDS/AML have been reported, all of them in an arm including 
rucaparib. Of these three events, one of them occurred in the ATHENA-COMBO and two of them in the 
ATHENA-MONO. Two events were considered as related by the investigator and one as unrelated. 
Pneumonitis 
There was one event of pneumonitis (or similar event) reported in the rucaparib group in ATHENA-MONO 
which was considered as unrelated by the investigator.

No notable mean changes from baseline in vital signs (diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, 
pulse  rate,  temperature  and  weight)  were  observed  in  ATHENA-MONO,  and  mean  values  were 
comparable between the rucaparib and placebo groups. 
Safety in special populations 
Analyses have been performed for ATHENA-MONO and the Pooled Ovarian Cancer Safety Population for 
the  following  subgroups:  age,  race,  HRD  status  and  renal  impairment.  Since  all  patients  included  in 
ATHENA-MONO had ovarian cancer, thus were female, no comparison by sex was performed.  
Age 
In ATHENA-MONO, for the Safety Population, the majority (~63%) of patients were < 65 years old, 
with ~30% of patients 65 to 74 years old, and ~7% of patients ≥75 years old, with these age groups 
well-balanced between the rucaparib and placebo groups.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The  MAH  has  not  provided  any  data  on  the  safety  related  to  drug-drug  interactions  and  other 
interactions.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In ATHENA-MONO, the incidences of TEAEs and treatment-related TEAEs that led to discontinuation of 
oral  study  drug  were  low.  The  most  common  TEAEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  rucaparib  included 
anaemia/haemoglobin  decreased,  asthenia/fatigue,  and  nausea.  The  most  common  TEAEs  leading  to 
discontinuation of placebo were asthenia/fatigue and neuropathy peripheral. The TEAEs were considered 
related to rucaparib or placebo in most patients experiencing TEAEs that led to discontinuation of oral 
study drug. 
The first TEAE that led to discontinuation occurred earlier for rucaparib compared to placebo in ATHENA-
MONO: median time, 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.2-2.8) for rucaparib and 14.1 months (95% CI, 0.9-23.0) 
for placebo.

Post marketing experience 
Rucaparib (Rubraca) is currently marketed in the US, UK, Israel, Switzerland and in selected countries 
in  the  EU  (Germany,  Italy,  Spain,  France,  and  the  Netherlands).  As  detailed  in  the  PSUR  dated  17 
February 2022, with the exception of the EU, UK, Israel and Switzerland exposure data, patient exposure 
from marketing experience is presented by the number of individual patients exposed to Rubraca since 
the  marketing  authorization  was  granted  in  the  US  on  19  December  2016.  Commercial  exposure  to 
Rubraca in the EU, UK, Israel and Switzerland has been calculated as treatment days. Cumulatively, up 
to 19 December 2021, 9,043 patients have been exposed worldwide to Rubraca (excluding commercial 
exposure in the EU, Switzerland, Israel, and the UK). Cumulatively, the total commercial exposure to 
Rubraca in the EU (Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and the Netherlands), Switzerland, Israel, and the 
UK was 383,117.5 treatment days. 
From US approval on 19 December 2016 to 19 December 2021, there were no safety signals detected 
from the post-marketing reports. The post-marketing safety data collected from 19 December 2016 to 
19  December  2021  are  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  rucaparib.  Post-marketing  safety 
surveillance is ongoing. Overall, the post-marketing safety data remain consistent with the known safety 
profile of rucaparib in clinical trials.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Introduction 
Due to the four-arm study design of ATHENA (see Figure 1 in Monk et al. Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2021), 
all  patients  in  the  rucaparib  and  placebo  groups  in  addition  to  oral  study  treatment  also  received  IV 
placebo  therapy.  This  could  have  influenced  the  safety  assessment  (of  patients  and  investigators), 
however,  as  the  same  IV  placebo  therapy  was  administered  in  both  study  arms,  the  resulting 
uncertainties remain limited.  
The Safety population of ATHENA-MONO included 425 patients in the rucaparib arm and 110 patients in 
the placebo arm. The Pool includes data from 1,594 patients in the rucaparib arm and 299 patients in 
the placebo arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 122/138 
 
 
 
Patient exposure 
At  the  DCO,  111  patients  (101  on  rucaparib)  had  completed  treatment  with  oral  study  drug,  and  64 
patients (53 on rucaparib) were still on treatment. Of note, in ATHENA-MONO the maximum duration of 
patients on rucaparib was capped to 24 months (counting since the start of IV placebo, i.e. cycle 2). At 
the DCO, safety data from 114 patients (26.8%) on treatment during 12 to < 24 months and from 118 
(27.8%) on treatment during ≥ 24 months are available. At this point of the assessment, the number of 
patients on treatment during a period of time close to 24 months (the maximum duration proposed in 
the SmPC) is considered sufficient. 
Regarding  patient  demographics,  the  population  of  Asian  patients  in  ATHENA-MONO  is  considerably 
higher than in the Pool with 18.8% and 14.5% of Asian patients in the rucaparib arm and the placebo 
arm  in  ATHENA-MONO,  vs.  8.0  and  7.7%  respectively  in  the  Pool.  BRCA  status  also  differed  from 
ATHENA-MONO to the Pool: 22.4% patients in the rucaparib arm and 21.8% in the placebo arm were 
BRCA mutated, vs. 42.5% in the rucaparib arm and 32.8% in the placebo arm in the Pool. As mentioned 
in section 4.4.3 (Discussion on clinical efficacy), a lower than expected proportion of tBRCA patients was 
enrolled in the study, apparently due to the approval of other PARPi in this setting. This marked difference 
between ATHENA-MONO and the Pool on BRCA status is not expected to impact the safety results of this 
study as both arms remained balanced. All the other characteristics were well balanced between arms. 
Regarding disease history and prior anticancer therapies, no relevant differences were observed between 
arms or between ATHENA-MONO and the Pool. All patients had received 4 to 8 cycles of first-line platinum 
doublet chemotherapy. 
Adverse events 
In ATHENA-MONO, almost all patients had at least one TEAE: 96.7% in the rucaparib arm and 92.7% in 
the placebo arm. These percentages are in line with the ones reported for the Pool. 
The most frequently reported combined PTs were “asthenia/fatigue/lethargy” (56.0% in the rucaparib 
arm  vs.  37.3%  in  the  placebo  arm),  “asthenia/fatigue”  (55.8%  vs.  37.3%),  “anaemia/haemoglobin 
decreased” (46.6% vs. 9.1%) and “ALT/AST increased” (42.6% vs. 8.2%). 
By  individual  PTs  the  most  frequently  reported  ones  in  the  rucaparib  arm  were  “nausea”  (56.2%  vs. 
30.0%),  “anaemia”  (45.4%  vs.  9.1%),  “fatigue”  (43.1%  vs.  28.2%)  and  “ALT  increased”  (40.7%  vs. 
6.4%). 
Overall, the incidence and nature of AE remained broadly similar in comparison with the data from the 
Pool, although it should be noted that several deviations were observed. Some PTs were reported with 
a higher frequency in ATHENA-MONO than in the Pool: “neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased” (27.8% 
in ATHENA-MONO vs. 20.8% in the Pool) and “ALT increased” (40.7% in ATHENA-MONO vs. 36.5% in 
the Pool). On the other hand, some PTs were reported with a lower frequency in ATHENA-MONO than in 
the 
Pool: 
“asthenia/fatigue” 
(55.8% 
in  ATHENA-MONO 
vs. 
65.9% 
in 
the 
Pool), 
“asthenia/fatigue/lethargy” (56.0% in ATHENA-MONO vs. 67.1% in the Pool), “constipation” (19.3% in 
ATHENA-MONO vs. 30.1% in the Pool), “diarrhoea” (24.0% in ATHENA-MONO vs. 29.3% in the Pool), 
“nausea”  (56.2%  in  ATHENA-MONO  vs.  68.3%  in  the  Pool),  “vomiting”  (23.5%  in  ATHENA-MONO  vs. 
36.5% in the Pool) and “decreased appetite” (17.9% in ATHENA-MONO vs. 27.5% in the Pool). 
It  seems  that  there  is  a  tendency  towards  a  lower  reporting  rate  of  TEAEs  belonging  to  the  SOC 
“Gastrointestinal disorders”, also including the PT “decreased appetite” in ATHENA-MONO compared with 
the  Pool,  with  differences  higher  than  10%  in  some  PTs,  such  as  “nausea”  and  “vomiting”.  A  similar 
pattern is observed in the placebo arm although differences appear lower in this case. The lower reporting 
rates in ATHENA-MONO compared with the Pool could be related to the status of the patient population 
(i.e. a less heavily pre-treated population). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023

Overall,  the same  trends  observed  in  the  reporting  rates  of  TEAEs  are  also  observed  in  the  reporting 
rates of treatment-related TEAEs, with no significant differences in terms of incidences. 
Regarding  Grade  3  (G3)  or  higher  TEAEs,  in  ATHENA-MONO  60.5%  of  patients  in  the  rucaparib  arm 
reported an event, vs. 22.7% in the placebo arm. These percentages were similar to the observed in the 
Pool. There are some PTs that were slightly increased in the rucaparib arm in ATHENA-MONO vs. the 
Pool: “ALT and AST increased” (4.5% in ATHENA-MONO vs. 2.7% in the Pool), “anaemia/haemoglobin 
decreased” (28.7% in ATHENA-MONO vs. 25.2% in the Pool), “neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased” 
(14.6% in ATHENA-MONO vs. 10.4% in the Pool), “anaemia” (28.5% in ATHENA-MONO vs. 24.2% in 
the Pool) and “neutrophil count decreased” (7.1% in ATHENA-MONO vs. 4% in the Pool). In line with the 
TEAEs’ reporting rates, PTs belonging to the “Gastrointestinal disorders” SOC were reported with a lower 
frequency in the rucaparib arm in ATHENA-MONO than in the rucaparib arm in the Pool. The same trend 
is observed in the G3 or higher treatment-related TEAEs. 
Overall, it seems that “neutropenia” and “neutrophil count decreased” were more frequently reported in 
ATHENA-MONO than in the Pool. Those PTs were also increased in terms of G3 or higher TEAEs, dose 
reductions and dose interruptions. In terms of SAEs the difference between ATHENA-MONO and the Pool 
is subtle, and in terms of discontinuations there were only 2 patients (0.5%) who discontinued rucaparib 
due  to  “neutropenia”  or  “neutrophil  count  decreased”  in  ATHENA-MONO  vs.  8  patients  (0.5%)  in  the 
Pool. Although the rates are slightly increased in ATHENA-MONO compared with the Pool and the reason 
for this is not fully understood, this finding does not seem to be clinically relevant considering that this 
AE is already included in section 4.4 and section 4.8 (as “very common”). Additionally, it does not seem 
that  this  increase  in  “neutropenia”/”neutrophil  count  decreased”  translates  into  a  higher  rate  of 
infections. 
The Pool’s safety data were updated with the latest available DCO, and are reflected in the clinical safety 
tables above.  
Serious Adverse Events 
In  ATHENA-MONO  90  patients  (21.2%)  in  the  rucaparib  arm  reported  at  least  a  SAE,  vs.  7  patients 
(6.4%) in the placebo arm. Those percentages are similar to the percentages reported in the Pool: 26.4% 
in  the  rucaparib  arm  vs.  9.0%  in  the  placebo  arm.  Apart  from  “anaemia”,  the  only  other  PT  in  the 
rucaparib  arm  which  was  reported  with  a  higher  frequency  than  1%  was  “neutropenia”,  which  was 
reported  in  1.4%  patients,  vs.  in  no  patients  in  the  placebo  arm.  In  addition,  there  were  7  (1.6%) 
patients  that  reported  an  event  of  intestinal  obstruction  (including  intestinal  obstruction  and  small 
intestinal obstruction). The absolute absence of patients reporting those events in the placebo arm is a 
clear indicator of the causal role of rucaparib in its occurrence. 
In terms of treatment-related SAEs, there were 34 patients (8.0%) with at least one serious TEAE related 
to rucaparib. From those patients, 17 patients (4.0%) reported an event of “anaemia”. No other PT was 
reported with an incidence higher than 1%. 
Deaths 
The  percentage  of  TEAEs  that  led  to  death  was  very  low  in  both  arms  of  ATHENA-MONO:  3  patients 
(0.7%) in the rucaparib arm vs. 0 patients in the placebo arm. These rates are slightly lower than the 
rates for the Pool: 3.5% in the rucaparib arm vs. 0.7% in the placebo arm.  
It should be noted that after Protocol Amendment 2, events of malignant neoplasm progression were no 
longer collected as TEAEs in the ATHENA-MONO study. As such, all those deaths have been excluded 
from the percentages.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 124/138 
 
 
 
In the ATHENA-MONO ITT population the percentage of patients who died in both arms is similar (24.9% 
and 24.5% in the rucaparib and placebo arm, respectively). Among these patients, the proportion who 
died due to the disease under study was smaller in the rucaparib arm compared with the placebo arm 
(84.9% vs. 92.6%), but 4.7% of death in the rucaparib arm were related to SAEs, while there was none 
in the placebo arm. As such, the potential decrease in the number of deaths due to the disease in the 
rucaparib arm is counterbalanced by the additional deaths due to SAEs.  
It should be noted that 9 patients (8.5%) died due to “unknown causes” in the rucaparib arm compared 
with 2 patients (7.4%) in the placebo arm. It should be noted that no SAEs were reported in long-term 
follow-up for these 9 patients. 
In ATHENA-MONO there were no deaths considered as TEAEs reported under the PT “MDS/AML”, whereas 
in the Pool there were 5 deaths belonging to this PT. This is not surprising, taking into account that MDS 
and  AML  usually  occur  after  a  long  period  of  time  and  the  follow-up  in  ATHENA-MONO  up  to  now  is 
shorter than in the Pool. 
None  of  the  deaths  in  the  rucaparib  arm  of  ATHENA-MONO  were  considered  as  causally-related  to 
rucaparib. The 3 TEAEs that led to death were as follows: 
• 
• 
There was a TEAE that led to death coded as “multiple organ dysfunction syndrome” associated with 
“COVID-19 pneumonia”. There are no signs suggesting a potential implication of rucaparib in this 
death. 
There was a TEAE that led to death coded as “myocardial infarction” or “pulmonary embolism”. Of 
note,  this  patient  died  5  days  after  starting  treatment  with  rucaparib,  and  had  comorbidities.  No 
autopsy was performed, and therefore no official cause of death was known. In absence of further 
information the potential role of rucaparib in this death remains uncertain, and the treatment can 
neither be linked with the death, nor potential implication be ruled out. Three deaths (0.2%) due to 
“pulmonary  embolism”  and  1  death  (0.1%)  due  to  “myocardial  infarction”  were  reported  in  the 
rucaparib arm of the Pool. “Pulmonary embolism” is not listed in the SmPC of rucaparib. 
• 
There was a TEAE that led to death coded as “malignant neoplasm progression”. There are no signs 
suggesting a potential implication of rucaparib in this death. 
In addition, SAE was recorded by investigator as the primary cause of death for two additional patients, 
these were not considered as a TEAE due to the time of onset:  
•  One  patient  in  ATHENA-MONO,  experienced  an  evolution  from  MDS  to  AML  and  died.  The  patient 
received treatment for 579 days. The patient was diagnosed with MDS/AML 686 days after the start 
of  the  treatment  (and  107  days  after  discontinuation)  and  died  3  days  later.  The  Investigator 
reported the G5 AML as related to rucaparib, despite some reserves expressed in the narrative. The 
MAH considered  AML to be more likely related to the platinum-based treatment than to rucaparib, 
based on genetic features of the disease. However, it is considered that there is not enough evidence 
to  rule  out  rucaparib  potential  contribution.  MDS/AML  is  already  listed  as  ADR  in  the  product 
information.  
•  One  SAE  recorded  with  outcome  of  death  was  “Ovarian  cancer  progression”.  There  are  no  signs 
suggesting a potential implication of rucaparib in this death. 
Other significant events 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and pneumonitis have been identified 
as AESIs for rucaparib. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 125/138 
 
 
 
 
Up to the DCO, three events of MDS/AML have been reported in ATHENA, all of them in an arm including 
rucaparib. Of these three events, one of them occurred in the ATHENA-COMBO and two of them in the 
ATHENA-MONO. In ATHENA-MONO, there was a single event (0.2%) of each of these AEs reported for 
patients who received rucaparib. Both the case of MDS (observed during treatment) and the case of AML 
(observed during long-term follow-up and that lead to death -see description above) were assessed by 
the Investigator as related to rucaparib. This low rate of MDS/AML is consistent with the rate of MDS/AML 
in the Pool and the rate reported in section 4.8 of the Rubraca SmPC. 
Although  it  is  acknowledged  that  no  clear  conclusion  can  be  drawn  regarding  the  potential  role  of 
rucaparib in the occurrence of MDS/AML, its contribution cannot be discarded either. It is important to 
note that the implication of the prior platinum-based chemotherapy in the occurrence of these events is 
well-established  and  cannot  be  disregarded,  but  an  imbalance  between  the  rucaparib  arm  and  the 
placebo arm is also evident. 
There was a single event (0.2%) of pneumonitis reported in the rucaparib arm of ATHENA-MONO, which 
was assessed by the Investigator as not related to rucaparib. 
ADRs 
Stomatitis is added to the tabulated list of ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC. In ATHENA MONO, there 
were 32 (7.5%) vs. 3 (2.7%) cases of stomatitis in the rucaparib vs. placebo groups, respectively. The 
median time from the first dose of rucaparib to the start of stomatitis was 75 days (95% CI: 36-169). 
Thirty one of the 32 rucaparib cases of stomatitis were Grade 1-2 and only a single case (0.2%) was 
Grade 3. All placebo cases of stomatitis were Grade 1. There were 21 (4.9%) cases of stomatitis that 
were considered related to rucaparib. 
In the Pool, the total number of rucaparib stomatitis cases is 126 (7.9%) vs. 8 (2.7%) placebo cases. 
Four (0.3%) of these rucaparib stomatitis cases are Grade ≥3. 
Of  note,  stomatitis  is  (already)  included  as  ‘Common’  ADR  in  the  SmPC  of  the  other  PARP  inhibitors 
olaparib and niraparib, see Lynparza SmPC and Zejula SmPC, respectively. 
The updated safety data in patients treated with rucaparib from ATHENA-MONO, and from the Pool, are 
consistent with the previously submitted ovarian cancer data. The ADR frequency table in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC is updated based on the latest DCO from the Pool. These proposed changes are acceptable. 
Stomatitis is added to the product information following a safety signal assessment based on the review 
of ATHENA-MONO clinical data study and post-marketing cases. 
Laboratory findings 
Regarding haematology, a significant increase in the incidence of these alterations in the rucaparib arm 
is  observed.  However,  all  these  hematologic  alterations  are  well-known  ADRs  for  rucaparib,  and  are 
already listed in the SmPC. Of note, the differences between arms are of approximately a 20%, going 
up to 30% for anaemia and platelet count decreased, the parameter with the least marked difference 
was “lymphocyte count decreased”. 
In  terms  of  clinical  chemistry  parameters,  most  of  them  were  significantly  increased  in  the  rucaparib 
arm  compared  with  the  placebo  arm.  The  two  parameters  which  were  most  markedly  altered  in 
comparison  with  the  placebo  arm  were  “alanine  aminotransferase  increased”  and  “aspartate 
aminotransferase increased”. Although these parameters are significantly increased in the rucaparib arm, 
most  of  them  are  of  low  grade.  AST  and  ALT  increases  are  well-known  ADRs  for  rucaparib,  and  are 
already listed in its SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 126/138 
 
 
 
 
“Creatinine increased” was also reported with a significantly higher frequency in the rucaparib arm vs. 
the placebo arm. Most events were low in grade, with a very low percentage of patients reporting a G3 
event, and no patients reporting a G4 event. 
No  other  parameters  seem  to  be  worrisomely  or  unexpectedly  increased  in  the  rucaparib  arm  in 
comparison with the placebo arm, with a very low percentage of patients having reported any G4 event 
in the rucaparib arm. 
Safety in special populations 
The MAH has provided safety data in special populations, both in the Pool and in ATHENA-MONO, by age, 
race, HRD status and HRD BRCA status.   
Safety by subgroups in the Pool 
By  age,  it  seems  that  the  frequency  of  patients  in  the  rucaparib  arm  with  one  or  more  G3  or  higher 
TEAEs increases with patients’ age (58.9% for < 65 years, 67.8% for 65-74 years, and 73% for ≥ 75 
years). However, this trend is not observed in the frequency of patients with one or more TEAEs leading 
to death or patients with one or more serious TEAEs. For some PT’s, an increase of more than 10% was 
observed  between  the  <  75  years’  and  ≥  75  years’  patients’  subgroups  who  received  rucaparib: 
“anaemia/haemoglobin  decreased”,  “asthenia/fatigue/lethargy”,  “blood  creatinine  increased”  and 
“decreased appetite”. Additionally, “hypertension” and “hyponatraemia” were reported with the double 
frequency in the ≥ 75 years’ subgroup. However, the size of the ≥ 75 years’ subgroups is, considerably 
smaller with 126 patients ≥75 years’ old who received rucaparib, vs. 1468 patients < 65 years’ old. 
No relevant differences are observed by race in the Pool. The only difference worth mentioning is the 
percentage of patients with one or more treatment-related TEAEs of G3 or higher in the rucaparib arm 
of the “White’s subgroup” vs. “Other races” (which includes Asian) vs. “Unknown race”: 45.7% vs. 56.8% 
vs. 50.3%.  
By HRD status, no relevant differences were observed among subgroups.  
Safety by subgroups in ATHENA-MONO 
Regarding safety by age, no particular differences are observed between the results in the Pool and the 
results  in  ATHENA-MONO.  Overall,  it  seems  that  the  frequency  of  TEAEs  of  grade  3  or  higher, 
discontinuations,  dose  reductions  and  interruptions  increase  as  patients  are  older.  The  percentage  of 
patients who needed a dose reduction due to TEAEs was notably higher in the subgroup of ≥ 75 years’ 
old  patients  (43.9%  in  the  <  65  subgroup,  54.3%  in  the  65-74  subgroup,  and  81.5%  in  the  ≥  75 
subgroup). Considering the lower number of patients in the rucaparib ≥ 75 subgroup compared with the 
other  subgroups  (27  patients  in  the  ≥  75  subgroup;  129  patients  in  the  65-74  subgroup;  and  269 
patients in the < 65 subgroup); and that the percentage of patients with SAEs and TEAEs that led to 
death remained similar among subgroups; the differences observed do not seem to be relevant. Some 
PTs  are  increased  by  10%-15%  in  the  ≥  65  subgroup  vs.  the  <  65  subgroup,  such  as 
“anaemia/haemoglobin  decreased”  (56.4%  vs.  40.9%),  “ALT/AST  increased”  (47.4%  vs.  39.8%)  and 
“blood creatinine increased” (17.9% vs. 7.1%). Similar pattern was observed when using the 75 y.o. 
threshold. 
Regarding safety data by race in ATHENA-MONO, the data presented shows a worse toxicity profile in 
the Asian population compared with White patients, reflected by a higher rate of patients who had SAEs 
(31.3% Asian vs. 18.4% White), TEAEs of grade 3 or higher (77.5% vs. 56.7%), and who needed dose 
reductions  (72.5%  vs.  44.8%)  and  interruptions  (73.8%  vs.  58.6%).  However,  the  rate  in  the 
discontinuations  (8.8%  vs.  11.3%)  and  deaths  (0%  vs  0.6%)  remained  similar  among  subgroups, 
suggesting that this increased toxicity in Asian patients is clinically manageable with dose reductions or 
interruptions, with no relevant impact on the rate of discontinuations or deaths. In terms of PTs, this 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 127/138 
 
 
 
toxicity  appears  to  be  mainly  driven  by  haematological  AEs,  together  with  transaminases  alterations. 
This  apparent  increased  toxicity  in  the  Asian  population  was  not  observed  in  prior  clinical  trials  with 
rucaparib, and as such no mention to it is included in either the EPARs or the SmPC. The MAH provided 
a thorough review and discussion on the potential worse toxicity of rucaparib in Asian patients, including 
a  review  of  the  safety  profile,  background  characteristics  and  haematological  and  ALT/AST/bilirubin 
parameters.  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  provided  review  refers  only  to  the  ATHENA-MONO 
results, instead of to the safety Pool, which would have been more relevant in this context. Importantly, 
it  is  noted  that  this  increased  haematological  toxicity  has  also  been  observed  with  other  PARPi  (i.e., 
olaparib),  as  reflected  in  several  of  the  Lynparza’s  EPARs  (procedures  II-20,  II-23,  II-33,  II-35).  The 
reasons for this observed difference remain unclear, although it should be noted that more Asian patients 
had a history of anaemia and lower blood counts at baseline than Non-Asian patients (28% vs. 15%). 
Some other background differences between both subgroups were noted, such as Asian patients received 
study treatment sooner after completion of chemotherapy than non-Asian patients. 
Regarding safety by tBRCA and Non-tBRCA, in line with the conclusions drawn for the Pool, the safety 
profile of rucaparib in the tBRCA patients seems to be worse than in the Non-tBRCA patients. Although 
the percentage of discontinuations, interruptions and dose reductions remained overall similar between 
both subgroups, SAEs and TEAEs of grade 3 or higher were more frequent in the tBRCA subgroup than 
in the Non-tBRCA subgroup. The sample size of the rucaparib tBRCA subgroup is notably smaller than 
the  sample  size  of  the  rucaparib  Non-tBRCA  subgroup  (91  patients  in  the  tBRCA  subgroup  vs.  334 
patients in the Non-tBRCA subgroup). As such, drawing conclusions on the impact of the BRCA status in 
the safety profile of rucaparib is difficult.   
No significant differences have been observed in the toxicity profile across the HRD-BRCA subgroups. 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Patients  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  AEs  in  the  rucaparib  arm  were  almost  twice  as  high  as 
patients in the placebo arm: 11.8% vs. 5.5%. However, this percentage was similar to the percentage 
observed in the rucaparib arm of the Pool: 16.9%. Overall, it does not seem that there is any PT which 
led to a worryingly higher rate of discontinuations in the ATHENA-MONO’s rucaparib arm compared to 
the Pool’s rucaparib arm. Most of these events were considered treatment-related (9.4% rucaparib vs. 
3.5% placebo). 
Regarding dose reductions, the rates in both the rucaparib arm and the placebo arm remained consistent 
compared with the rates in the Pool. The most commonly reported PT was “anaemia”, with a frequency 
of 23.1% in the rucaparib arm vs. 0% in the placebo arm. The percentage of patients who had a dose 
reduction for this reason was slightly higher in ATHENA-MONO than the percentage reported for the Pool 
(17%). As previously mentioned, “anaemia” is a well-known AE of rucaparib. Apart from “anaemia” (and 
the combined PT “anaemia/haemoglobin decreased”), there were no relevant differences between the 
incidences of dose reductions by PTs reported in ATHENA-MONO in comparison with the rates reported 
for the Pool. 
Regarding dose interruptions, the percentages of patients who had a dose interruption in ATHENA-MONO 
remained similar to the percentages in the Pool. Overall, the incidences by PT in ATHENA-MONO were 
similar  to  the  incidences  in  the  Pool;  although  it  should  be  noted  that  the  combined  PTs 
“anaemia/haemoglobin decreased” and “neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased” were reported with a 
higher frequency in the rucaparib arm in ATHENA-MONO than in the Pool (with a difference higher than 
5%).

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  safety  data  does  not  suggest  any  relevant  change  in  the  safety  profile  of  rucaparib.  As  already 
known,  rucaparib  is  associated  with  a  high  incidence  of  some  ADR  such  as  “anaemia/haemoglobin 
decreased”,  “neutropenia/neutrophil  count  decreased”,  “thrombocytopenia/platelet  count  decreased”, 
“asthenia/fatigue/lethargy”,  “ALT/AST  increased”  and  “nausea”.  No  relevant  differences  have  been 
observed in comparison to the safety data already known for rucaparib, apart from some slight deviations 
in  the  incidence  of  some  ADRs  such  as  “neutropenia/neutrophil  count  decreased”  which  seems  to  be 
slightly higher in the ATHENA-MONO study. Stomatitis is added to the product information following a 
safety signal assessment based on the review of ATHENA-MONO clinical data study and post-marketing 
cases. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence, section 4.1 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the new indication for 
rucaparib as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO 
Stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in 
response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Section 
4.2 has been updated to reflect the specific duration of treatment cap of 2 years for the new indication. 
Section 4.4 has been updated with revised frequency of intestinal obstruction. Section 4.8 has been 
updated with revised frequencies for adverse drug reactions, based on data from 1 594 patients 
included in clinical trials in ovarian cancer and treated with rucaparib monotherapy. Section 5.1 has 
been updated with results from study CO-338-087 (ATHENA); this is a Phase III, randomised, double-
blind, dual placebo-controlled study of rucaparib as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in 
patients with newly diagnosed EOC, FTC, or PPC who have responded to their first-line treatment 
(surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy). The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
It is considered that the submitted type II variation to extend the indication of Rubraca for its use as 
monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO Stages III and IV) 
high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response 
(complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, does not have a 
relevant impact on the PIL text. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Rubraca (rucaparib) is included in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 131/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
additional monitoring list as New active substance.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for Rubraca (rucaparib) is “as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of 
adult patients with advanced (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or 
primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line 
platinum-based chemotherapy.” 
Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer and the eighth more common cause of cancer death 
in women. Most patients are diagnosed in an advanced stage, defined by the spread of the disease 
outside the pelvis (FIGO stage III and IV)1. More than 90% of malignant ovarian tumours are of 
epithelial origin, designated epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The most common and most lethal EOC is 
high-grade serous carcinoma. The 5-year survival rate in advanced ovarian cancer patients decreases 
from 42% (stage III) to 26% (stage IV)2. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients includes a combination of surgery and 
chemotherapy, either primary debulking surgery followed by adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy 
(i.e. cisplatin or carboplatin plus a taxane) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy with subsequent interval 
debulking surgery followed by additional chemotherapy. Primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers 
are treated in the same manner as epithelial ovarian cancer. 
However, despite optimal response to the initial treatment, the majority of patients relapse. Thus, 
maintenance therapy following response to standard treatment provides an opportunity to extend the 
disease-free interval and avoid recurrence. 
Currently approved treatment options in the (first-line) maintenance setting include olaparib either as 
monotherapy (for BRCA mutated patients) or in combination with bevacizumab (for HRD positive 
patients) and niraparib (for all comers).3

Regarding the unmet medical need, despite the availability of maintenance therapies following 
standard-of-care treatments for newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, the need for additional therapies is 
acknowledged in this condition. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is mainly based on the results of the Study CO-338-087 (ATHENA), a Phase 3, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in newly diagnosed adult patients with 
advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who were in response after 
having completed first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The study included 4 treatment arms. As 
part of this submission, only data for patients who were randomised to rucaparib monotherapy (Arm B) 
or placebo (Arm D) have been assessed (i.e. ATHENA-MONO comparison). 
The primary endpoint of the study was PFS by RECIST v1.1. as assessed by the investigator (invPFS). 
OS and ORR by RECIST v1.1 in patients with measurable disease at baseline were key secondary 
endpoints. Other secondary endpoints were PFS assessed by BICR and DOR.  
The primary and key secondary endpoints were tested using a pre-specified hierarchical step-down 
procedure in order to preserve the overall type 1 error rate, among the HRD population (patients 
tBRCA or non-tBRCA LOH-high) first and then the ITT population, using a one-sided alpha of 0.0125.  
A total of 538 patients were randomised 4:1 to receive either rucaparib (n=427) or placebo (n=111). 
Of these, 234 were HRD positive (185 in the rucaparib arm and 49 in the placebo arm). Randomisation 
was stratified by HRD status (tBRCA, non-tBRCA LOH-high, non-tBRCA LOH-low, non-tBRCA LOH-
unknown), response to first-line platinum (no residual disease, residual disease) and timing of surgery 
(primary surgery, interval debulking). 
The data initially provided were based on a data cut-off (DCO) of 23 March 2022. During the 
procedure, updated OS data were submitted (DCO 09 March 2023). 
3.2.  Favourable effects  
HRD population (n=234) 
At the time of the DCO (23 March 2022), with 43.2% events in the rucaparib arm and 63.3% in the 
placebo arm, there was a statistically significant improvement in invPFS with rucaparib compared to 
placebo (log-rank, p = 0.0004). The median invPFS was 28.7 months (95% CI, 23.0-NR) for rucaparib 
and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.1-22.1) for placebo. The stratified Cox proportional hazards model 
showed a statistically significant improvement on invPFS with rucaparib compared to placebo (HR 
0.47; 95% CI, 0.31-0.72; p = 0.0005).  
ITT population (n=538) 
There was a statistically significant improvement in invPFS with rucaparib compared to placebo (log-
rank, p < 0.0001). The median invPFS in the ITT Population was 20.2 months (95% CI, 15.2-24.7) for 
rucaparib and 9.2 months (95% CI, 8.3-12.2) for placebo. The stratified Cox proportional hazards 
model showed a statistically significant improvement in invPFS with rucaparib compared to placebo 
(HR 0.52; 95% CI, 0.40-0.68; p < 0.0001). The number of invPFS events at the time of the DCO was 
53.9% in the rucaparib arm and 70.3% in the placebo arm.  
Sensitivity analyses of invPFS were consistent with the primary analysis for both the HRD and the ITT 
population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/503870/2023  
Page 133/138 
 
 
 
At the time of analysis OS data were immature in both HRD and ITT population with 15.8% and 24.7% 
of events respectively. No difference in survival was observed between treatment arms (HRD: HR 
0.97; 95% CI: 0.43, 2.19, ITT: HR 0.96; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.47). Results of a second IA based on a data 
cut-off date of 9 March 2023 were provided during the procedure. At the time of this IA statistical 
significance was not reached (HRD: HR 0.84; 95% CI: 0.44, 1.58, ITT: HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.58-1.17). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
At the time of the final analysis for the primary endpoint, OS data were heavily censored, with only 
around 16% of events in the HRD population and 25% in the ITT population having occurred. Updated 
OS data were provided during the procedure, with 35% of events reported (DCO 09 March 2023). 
Although a detrimental effect on OS seems unlikely, the lack of maturity of OS hampers proper 
conclusion. Thus, in order to further investigate the efficacy of rucaparib, results from the final OS 
analysis will be provided by Q2 2027 (see Annex II condition, PAES).  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the incidence of adverse events was higher in the rucaparib arm as compared to placebo: 
TEAE (96.7% in the rucaparib arm vs. 92.7% in the placebo arm), patients with one or more TEAEs of 
G3 or higher (60.5% vs. 22.7%), patients with one or more TEAEs leading to death (0.7% vs. 0%), 
patients with one or more serious TEAEs (21.2% vs. 6.4%) or patients with one or more TEAEs leading 
to study drug discontinuation (11.8% vs. 5.5%).  
By PTs, the most frequently reported ADRs (≥30%) were “asthenia/fatigue/lethargy” (56.0% in the 
rucaparib arm vs. 37.3% in the placebo arm), nausea (56.2% vs. 30.0%), “anaemia/haemoglobin 
decreased” (46.6% vs. 9.1%) and “ALT/AST increased” (42.6% vs. 8.2%). 
The most commonly reported Grade ≥3 ADRs (≥10%) were anaemia/haemoglobin decreased (28.7% 
rucaparib vs. 0 placebo), neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased (14.6% vs. 0.9%) and ALT/AST 
increased (10.6% vs. 0.9%).  
Serious ADRs occurring in ≥1% of patients were anaemia (4%) and neutropenia (1.4%). 
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML are considered AESIs of rucaparib and have been observed 
in patients exposed to other PARP inhibitors. In ATHENA-MONO two events of MDS/AML were reported 
in the rucaparib arm.  This rate of is consistent with the Pool and the section 4.8 of the Rubraca SmPC. 
Stomatitis is added as a new Adverse Drug Reaction to the product information following a safety 
signal assessment based on the review of ATHENA-MONO clinical data study and post-marketing cases. 
The most common TEAE leading to discontinuation was anaemia (3.5% rucaparib vs. 0 placebo).

a. Based on the second interim analysis (data cut-off: 9 March 2023). 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Maintenance treatment with rucaparib in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients who have completed 
first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and are in response has shown a delay in the progression of 
the disease with a median PFS (as per investigator assessment) of 20.2 months in the rucaparib arm 
compared with 9.2 months in the placebo arm; HR 0.52 (95% CI, 0.40-0.68). These results, observed 
in the overall population, were consistent with that observed in the different populations analysed (i.e. 
HRD, tBRCA, non-tBRCA-LOH-high, non-tBRCA low and the pooled subgroup of non-tBRCA) and most 
of the subgroups investigated.  
The main limitation is the lack of mature OS data, which hampers interpretation of the results. Based 
on currently available survival data a potential detrimental effect on OS seems unlikely. However, 
results of the final OS analysis will have to be provided by the MAH as a post-authorisation obligation 
(PAES - Annex II condition).  
In the context of a maintenance treatment, the safety profile is of particular importance. Rucaparib 
was associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions (mainly nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea), 
asthenia/fatigue and myelosuppression (neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia), although overall 
these adverse reactions were manageable with supportive treatment, and dose interruptions or 
modifications. Stomatitis is added to the product information as a new ADR. 
The safety of rucaparib as observed in ATHENA-MONO is in line with the known toxicity profile of 
rucaparib as described in section 4.8 of the Rubraca SmPC, and the risks associated with rucaparib 
treatment are adequately covered by the information in the (updated) SmPC and RMP. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefits of rucaparib in the  indication are considered meaningful with a manageable safety profile. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rubraca is positive. 
The following measure is considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
PAES: In order to further investigate the efficacy of rucaparib monotherapy in  the maintenance 
treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) following 
completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, the MAH should submit the final analysis of OS 
of the phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study CO-338-087. With a due date of 30 
June 2027.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

Extension of indication to include maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced (FIGO Stages 
III and IV) high grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in 
response (complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for 
RUBRACA, based on interim results from study CO-338-087 (ATHENA); this is a Phase III, randomised, 
double-blind, dual placebo controlled study of rucaparib as monotherapy and in combination with 
nivolumab in patients with newly diagnosed EOC, FTC, or PPC who have responded to their first-line 
treatment (surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance, in addition, the list of 
local representatives has been updated. Version 8.1 of the RMP has also been approved.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Rubraca is not similar to Zejula within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 1. 
Additional market protection 
The request for one year of market protection for a new indication was withdrawn by the MAH during 
the current procedure. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures  
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

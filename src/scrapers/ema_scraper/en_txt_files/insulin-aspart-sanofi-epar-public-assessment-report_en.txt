2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Insulin aspart Sanofi (also referred to in this report as SAR341402) has been developed as an insulin 
aspart biosimilar. The EU reference medicinal product is NovoRapid solution for injection 100 U/mL, 
which was authorised through the centralised procedure on 07 September 1999. NovoRapid is 
indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus. The Applicant is 
seeking approval for the same indication as NovoRapid. 
About the product 
SAR341402 (insulin aspart) is a rapid-acting insulin produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing 
a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli as the production organism. Insulin aspart is 
homologous to human insulin with the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by 
aspartic acid in position B28. This modification renders the insulin molecule less prone to self-associate 
into hexamers and accounts for faster absorption and activity as compared to human insulin given 
subcutaneously.  
Insulin aspart, like human insulin, acts via the human insulin receptor system. The primary activity of 
insulin, including insulin aspart, is the regulation of glucose metabolism by binding to a specific cell 
receptor. Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, 
especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits 
lipolysis in the adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis, and enhances protein synthesis. 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection containing 100 units/ml of insulin aspart as 
the active substance. Other ingredients are metacresol, phenol, sodium chloride, zinc chloride, 
polysorbate 20, water for injections, hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment) and sodium hydroxide (for 
pH adjustment). 
SAR341402 solution for injection is a sterile, aqueous, clear, and colourless solution. Each milliliter of 
SAR341402 solution for injection contains 100 units (equivalent to 3.50 mg) insulin aspart. Two drug 
product presentations, 3 mL cartridge for use in a re-usable pen and 3 mL disposable pre-filled pen 
(SoloStar®), have been applied for. SAR341402 solution is to be administered subcutaneously by 
injection, at individualized doses.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This Marketing Authorisation Application is an abridged application for a similar biological medicinal 
product under Article 10 (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC. 
The clinical development programme of Insulin aspart Sanofi has specifically considered the following 
EU guidelines:  
• 
• 
“Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as 
active substance: quality issues (revision 1)” (EMA/CHMP/BWP/247713/2012)

Rev.1). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Insulin aspart, the active substance (AS), is a rapid-acting insulin with faster absorption and activity as 
compared to human insulin given subcutaneously. Insulin aspart is homologous to human insulin with 
the exception of a single substitution of the amino acid proline by aspartic acid in position B28. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi has been developed in the EU as a similar biological medicinal product to the 
reference product, NovoRapid (insulin aspart 100 U/ml). 
The finished product (FP), also referred to as SAR341402, is presented as a solution for injection 
containing 100 units/ml of insulin aspart as the active substance. Other ingredients are metacresol, 
phenol, sodium chloride, zinc chloride, polysorbate 20, water for injections, hydrochloric acid (for pH 
adjustment) and sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment). 
The product will be available in a 3 ml cartridge for use in re-usable pens (JuniorSTAR, Tactipen, 
AllStar or AllStar PRO) and a 3 ml disposable pre-filled pen injector (3 ml cartridge irreversibly 
integrated in a disposable pen injector SoloStar). Insulin aspart solution pen injector is a fully 
mechanical device, containing no electronic components. The pen injector is designed to deliver 
multiple doses of variable volume. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance is a two-chain peptide consisting of 51 amino acids. The international non-
proprietary name (INN) is insulin aspart. It is identical in primary structure to human insulin, only 
differing in amino acid sequence at position 28 of the B-chain. Human insulin is 28B-L-Proline-, 
whereas insulin aspart is 28B-L-aspartic acid-. As human insulin, insulin aspart contains 2 interchain 
disulfide bonds and 1 intrachain disulfide bond. The structure, including the change in comparison to 
human insulin, is outlined in Figure 1 below.

Manufacture, process controls and characterisation 
- Manufacture 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing, quality control testing and release of insulin aspart active substance are carried out 
in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices. 
Insulin aspart is produced by recombinant DNA technology using an Escherichia coli strain as host cell 
for the expression plasmid. One vial of the working cell bank of the production strain is amplified in a 
seed culture and a pre-fermentation step prior to the main fermentation in a fermenter. Product 
formation is initiated in the main fermentation stage. During the expression phase, the insulin aspart 
fusion protein is produced as insoluble intracellular inclusion bodies. The culture is ended after 
induction when a specified optical density is reached.  
The culture is inactivated. E. coli cells are separated by centrifugation and subsequently subjected to 
disruption by high-pressure homogenisation to liberate the inclusion bodies. The fusion protein is 
dissolved and the insulin aspart precursor pre-pro insulin aspart is formed by a folding reaction. The 
refolded molecule is digested by enzymatic cleavage.  
After purification by chromatography, insulin aspart is isolated by precipitation, washed and dried. The 
active substance is filled into containers for storage.  
The process for insulin aspart production was established for direct processing of intermediate 
solutions and suspensions. Only in-process holding of suspensions and solutions as required by the 
processing occurs. No long-term storage of isolated intermediates is intended. 
The active substance manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail. Appropriate description of 
each step is provided, covering fermentation, recovery, chromatographic purification and including 
ranges of process parameters and in process-controls. Composition, preparation, sterilization, and 
storage of culture media are detailed.  The active substance manufacturing process is considered 
acceptable. 
- Control of materials 
No materials of human or animal origin are used in the manufacturing process of insulin aspart. The 
raw materials used in the manufacturing have been adequately described in the dossier.  
The cell bank system is characterized in line with ICH Q5B and ICH Q5D guidance. The characterisation 
and testing of the cell banks confirm the identity, purity and suitability of the cell banks for 
manufacturing use. Stability of the production cell line has been demonstrated. The tests confirmed the 
expected genetic characteristics of the cell line and demonstrate genetic stability.  
Adequate protocols for stability monitoring of the MCB and the current WCB have been provided. 
Results were satisfactory. Specifications for release and stability monitoring of new WCBs are 
considered adequate.  During the procedure a protocol for replacement of new WCB was requested and 
provided. 
- Control of critical steps and intermediates 
During the insulin aspart manufacturing process, the quality of the product is ensured by maintaining 
certain conditions within predetermined ranges and by in-process controls. The criticality of parameters 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020  
Page 11/90 
 
 
 
is based on the Company´s risk assessment of the process in order to ensure adequate process 
performance and product quality attributes falling within the established ranges. The classification is 
transparent and comprehensive.  The set of in-process controls are logical and adequately justified.  
- Process validation 
The process verification studies of the commercial manufacturing process were performed by 
successfully manufacturing three active substance batches using normal processing parameter set 
points and conditions.  Results of critical process parameters, in-process controls and final active 
substance are reported with pre-defined ranges/limits. In addition, a large range of additional tests 
(such as yield, product-related impurities, process-related impurities) were performed to monitor 
process performance. The data provided are satisfactory and consistent and indicates that each step 
has been appropriately designed.  
Hold time studies are provided for all intermediates intended to be held for a certain processing time. 
The Company proposes a concurrent column lifetime validation approach. The provided criteria and 
frequency of evaluation are satisfactory. Column lifetime validation is considered addressed in an 
acceptable manner. 
- Manufacturing process development 
The active substance manufacturing process was developed and validated using a combination of 
traditional and enhanced approaches as described in ICH Q11. The Quality Target Product Profile 
(QTPP) is based on the reference medicinal product and other insulins and analogues. Based on the 
QTTP, critical quality attributes (CQA) were identified. Most of the identified CQAs coincide with the 
quality attributes indicated in Ph. Eur. monograph for insulin aspart (2084), which is at least, to a 
great extent, based on the reference product. The choice of the CQAs seems logical for manufacturing 
process development and can be endorsed.  
The critical process parameters to be monitored during routine production and proven acceptable 
ranges were defined. Overall the manufacturing process development is considered comprehensive and 
satisfactory, supporting the proposed control strategy. 
The first process stage at pilot scale was used to manufacture a batch that was used in early tox 
studies. Production scale batches were used in clinical studies. All batches included in the analytical 
similarity exercise and the non-clinical in vitro similarity studies with the reference product were also 
manufactured using active substance from production scale. Comparability of the active substance was 
demonstrated from laboratory scale to production scale. 
Characterisation 
The structural elucidation and confirmation of insulin aspart has been carried out on insulin aspart 
manufactured by Sanofi. The batch investigated has been manufactured at production scale and, as 
shown in comparability studies, can be considered representative for the commercial active substance. 
Characterisation was performed using the following orthogonal techniques with the following analytical 
techniques: Mass spectrometry (MS), Amino acid sequencing, Peptide mapping, Isoelectric point 
determination by capillary isoelectric focusing, Ultraviolet (UV) / visible absorption spectrophotometry, 
Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption 
spectrophotometry, Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry and Reversed phase 
chromatography. The studies cover primary, secondary, tertiary and higher order structural aspects. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020  
Page 12/90 
 
 
 
the studies, comparisons were made with compendial (PhEur, USP and JP) reference preparations. All 
studies supported the proposed structure.  Biological methods do not form part of the characterisation 
section. In vivo and in vitro biological testing is reported in the biosimilarity studies (3.2.R) and Sanofi 
batches showed similar activities as EU NovoRapid and USA NovoLog batches.  Biological activity is 
also investigated in Module 4. 
Characterisation of active substance purity has been applied on many batches representing active 
substance process development. Process and product-related impurities including degradation products 
have been described and presented. The level of related substances/impurities in the active substance 
is low and complies with the Ph. Eur. monograph. The grouping of substances in a quantitative RP-
HPLC assay used throughout module 3 sections has been appropriately justified.  
Process impurities as HCP, DNA, residual enzymes, residual solvents and elemental impurities have 
been addressed and the low levels found do not raise any concern. 
Viral contamination of the host cells is not likely because no mammalian host cells are used. 
In addition, no material of animal or human origin is used in the manufacture of insulin aspart active 
substance. 
Specification 
The specification of insulin aspart active substance has been established based on its respective Ph. 
Eur. monograph and relevant ICH guidelines, quality of the active substance used in clinical testing, 
active substance stability, and analytical method variability. 
The specification for the active substance includes appearance, identity, potency (HPLC assay), purity. 
The proposed tests and acceptance criteria for routine active substance release are acceptable. 
- Analytical procedures 
The limits for assay, related proteins, HMWP, endotoxins and sulphated ash are mainly based on the 
Ph. Eur. monograph for insulin aspart.  
The applicant has provided acceptable justification for tests on residual impurities which are not 
included in the specification.  
The analytical procedures applied to control the insulin aspart active substance are essentially those 
described in the published European Pharmacopoeia Monograph for insulin aspart. Where applicable, 
full method descriptions are provided.  
Analytical results for batches manufactured for toxicological, clinical and supportive- and primary 
stability studies as well as analytical results for process evaluation batches are presented. 
- Batch analysis 
All batch results comply with specifications for the commercial active substance. Overall consistent 
quality characteristics can be seen from the data provided. 
- Reference standards 
No in house primary reference standard had been established since official standards have been issued 
by Pharmacopoeias. Working standards are developed. The establishment procedure of the working 
standard has been reported in sufficient detail. 
- Container closure system 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020  
Page 13/90 
 
 
 
Insulin aspart active substance is packaged in stainless steel lidded drums which are sealed by silicone 
elastomers. Sufficiently detailed information on the container closure system of the AS is provided.  
Stability 
The stability studies of the active substance are designed in line with ICH guidelines and do not raise 
any concerns. All test results are presented.  A photosensitivity study demonstrated that the active 
substances is sensitive to light degradation.  
The primary stability study and the supportive study provide support for the claimed 5 years shelf life 
at the proposed storage condition of -20°C±5°C, protected from light. Each year, if manufactured, at 
least one commercial production batch will be placed on stability. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product

mg/mL insulin aspart [equivalent to 100 U (units) of insulin per millilitre].  
The product is packaged in colourless type I glass cartridges of 3 ml closed on one end with plunger 
stoppers and on the opposite end with flanged caps (with sealing disks). The cartridge is either 
packaged in a cardboard box to be used with pen-injectors referenced in the SmPC or included in a 
disposable pen injector (SoloStar). The user is able to select the dose by dialling numbers (units) of 
insulin aspart using the dose selector (dosage range 1-80 U, dose increments 1 U). 
The excipients (metacresol, phenol, sodium chloride, zinc chloride, polysorbate 20 (stabilizing), sodium 
hydroxide and hydrochloric acid and water for injections) comply with the requirements of the Ph. Eur.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
- Pharmaceutical Development 
The composition of the FP formulation was selected based on qualitative and quantitative information 
available on the reference product. After defining the QTPP, the CQAs of the FP were identified. In 
order to confirm the quantities of the formulation components in combination with the used active 
substance and to gain formulation understanding, the Applicant performed an appropriate formulation 
study with varying quantities of the formulation excipients. The outcome of the study finally confirmed 
the target composition and stability details on studied formulations have been provided. Differences 
between the FP formulation and that of the reference product NovoRapid/NovoLog have been discussed 
by the applicant.  
The FP manufacturing process was adequately developed. Adequate comparability studies were 
conducted to study a potential impact of the modifications on FP quality. The development studies 
resulted in several Critical Process Parameters (CPP) and Critical Material Attributes (CMA), which have 
been implemented in the description of the manufacturing process and specifications of the excipients. 
An overview of the proven acceptable ranges of the CPPs have been presented. 
In order to demonstrate the suitability of the selected container closure systems, different tests and 
studies were conducted. Extractables and leachables studies were adequately designed. A toxicological

assessment on the quantities of the leachables found in the FP came to the conclusion that these 
leachables do not present a toxicological concern.  
Functional performance of the insulin aspart disposable pen (SoloStar) but also of the re-usable pen 
injectors (AllStar pen injector, JuniorSTAR pen injector and TactiPen pen injector) after assembly with 
insulin aspart cartridges was investigated according to the relevant ISO standards. All parameters 
tested were within the acceptance criteria required by the ISO standards. Dose accuracy for the 
reusable pens has been shown. Suitability of the selected disposable pen for insulin aspart 3 mL glass 
cartridges was confirmed in terms of dose accuracy and functionality.  
The integrity of the container closure systems was confirmed by using an adequate container closure 
integrity evaluation study.  
Finally, the optimum concentration of the preservative metacresol and phenol in insulin aspart FP 
solution was adequately evaluated.Sufficient antimicrobial efficacy up to the end of shelf life has been 
ensured. 
- Process controls 
The FP manufacturing process is adequately described and depicted in a flow chart. Process controls 
are indicated and are based on those identified in the development studies.  
The operating parameters for sterilising the packaging components (rubber stopper, sealing disks and 
cartridges) are specified in the dossier and they are stated to comply with Ph. Eur. requirements.  
A description of the disposable pen injector assembly process has been provided.  
- Process validation 
In order to demonstrate that the manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing the 
intended quality of insulin aspart solution in cartridges, process verification studies were conducted on 
a sufficient number of batches at commercial scale. All critical in-process controls were monitored. The 
impact of different manufacturing activities on the degradation of insulin aspart have been adequately 
evaluated during pharmaceutical development. Overall, the results of all process tests and the release 
data of the validation batches met their acceptance criteria.  
The disposable pen injector assembly process has been validated. 
Filter validation was adequately summarised and results of these studies have been provided.  
Product specification 
The specifications are considered appropriate for the finished product control at release. Justifications 
for all specification limits have been provided. The limits for most of the specification parameters are in 
compliance with Ph. Eur.and USP monographs for insulin preparations. In addition, an appropriate 
specification for the pre-filled Insulin aspart Sanofi pen injector has been established. 
- Analytical procedures 
The test parameters can be considered appropriate for the FP control at release. In general, analytical 
methods have been laid down in sufficient detail. The compendial methods have been verified or 
validated. All non-compendial analytical procedures were validated in line with ICH guidelines. The 
suitability of the methods for FP control was sufficiently shown.

- Batch analysis 
Sufficient results of pilot-scale and production scale batches have been provided.  
- Container Closure 
The insulin aspart solution for injection 100 U/mL is packaged in a multidose container (3 mL 
colourless type I glass cartridge) closed with a flanged cap with sealing disk and a plunger stopper. The 
cartridge can be packaged in an outer carton (for use with re-usable pen injectors e.g. Allstar, not 
included in the pack but referred to in the SmPC) or integrated in a disposable pen injector (SoloStar). 
The disposable pen injector has been demonstrated to comply with relevant ISO norms and compliance 
to Directive 93/42/EEC.  
Stability of the product 
The current shelf life of 24 months for the finished product is proposed based on available stability 
data. Insulin aspart Sanofi finished product should be stored in a refrigerator between +2 °C and +8 
°C, protected from light. After first use, it can be stored at room temperature protected from light for 
up to 28 days.  
Stability testing in accordance with the ICH guideline has been initiated with commercial scale batches.  
Disposable pen injection device assembled with the cartridge was demonstrated to accurately deliver 
multiple doses after storage. 
The in-use stability of the finished product was shown to comply with the proposed shelf-life 
specification after 28 days.  
Finally, light protection of the secondary packaging was confirmed. Based on the results of the stability 
studies, all storage instructions given in the SmPC are supported.  
Biosimilarity 
Insulin aspart is a relatively small and less complex protein molecule enabling thorough and reliable 
comparison of quality attributes covering the structure and impurity pattern. The finished product and 
the reference product NovoRapid are highly similar.  
FP is presented in cartridges and prefilled pens, which are also the common presentations of the 
reference product.  
A comprehensive analytical comparability study was performed to evaluate the similarity between 
solution for injection and the reference product Novorapid. 
The applicant’s strategy to establish similarity of solution for injection with the reference product is 
endorsed.   
For several attributes, compliance to the reference product label claim is shown as well as similarity in 
analytical studies. In analytical studies, SAR341402 solution for injection batches have been tested 
side by side to EU sourced NovoRapid batches. The number of FP batches chosen for each test is 
appropriate to accommodate the expected variability of the analytical method  
Similarity in primary, secondary, tertiary structure as well as higher-order structure between 
SAR341402 solution for injection, NovoRapid and NovoLog as well as between NovoRapid and NovoLog 
has been clearly established. The study design is considered sufficient to detect any possible difference 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020

in the structure of a relatively less complex protein molecule as insulin aspart. Results of comparative 
in-vitro and in vivo biological activity assays further confirm the similarity in structure. 
The primary/secondary/tertiary structure studies have been applied to two SAR341402 solution for 
injection batches derived from P02 and P03 AS process, three batches Novorapid and three batches of 
Novolog.  
The SAR341402 solution for injection batches included in the analytical studies are considered 
sufficiently representative for the commercial product. - The comparative stability and degradation 
studies indicate that only minor effects on quality attributes could have occurred upon storage of 
SAR341402 solution for injection and reference products.  
Quantitative results have been presented in clear graphs. This graphical presentation enables a 
satisfactory comparison of results. The latter is feasible due to the fact that values of different batches 
are in relatively good agreement with each other. In addition to presentation of the actual results, the 
applicant applies a statistical evaluation of the data. 
No major qualitative and quantitative differences in purity are reported between SAR341402 solution 
for injection and the reference product.  
The comparative in-use stability study is considered sufficiently well designed to demonstrate the 
similarity of the biosimilar with the reference product under the in-use conditions. No major qualitative 
or quantitative differences in impurity profiles are observed. Similar degradation profiles are also 
revealed in comparative side-by-side stability studies and thermal, hydrolytic and light stress studies.  
The analytical studies in 3.2R, detailed in the table below, present strong support on the similarity of 
SAR341402 solution for injection and Novorapid.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is presented as 100 IU/m solution for injection in 3 ml cartridges for use with 
reusable or disposable injector devices.  The development, characterisation, manufacture and control 
of insulin aspart active substance and finished product were well described and minor issues resolved 
during the assessment.  In addition, biosimilarity versus the reference product, NovoRapid has been 
adequately described. 
No major objections were identified during the assessment. There is a good control strategy in place to 
guarantee consistent quality of the finished product. The overall quality is considered acceptable when 
used in accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
From a quality perspective, the marketing authorisation application of Insulin aspart Sanofi can be 
recommended for approval. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The limit for Total ‘21A-Asp insulin aspart, 3B-Asp insulin aspart/28B-succinimide insulin aspart and 
3B-isoAsp insulin aspart’ in the finished product should be reconsidered when sufficient experience with 
commercial manufacturing has been gained. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical development of SAR341402 was done in accordance with the ‘Guideline on non-clinical 
and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin 
and insulin analogues’ (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005 Rev. 1) and the ‘Guideline on similar biological 
medicinal products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and 
clinical issues’ (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1).  
Comparative in vitro nonclinical pharmacology studies were focused on insulin receptor (IR-A and IR-B) 
binding and binding kinetics and their activation, metabolic responses, insulin-like growth factor-1 
receptor (IGF-1R) binding and activation, and mitogenic activities.  
The toxicological development program consisted of two 1-month repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats 
and a local tolerability study in rabbits. 
Specific studies on safety pharmacology, pharmacodynamic drug interactions, pharmacokinetic, 
genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity were not submitted in 
accordance with the relevant guidelines. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A series of in vitro studies were conducted to demonstrate similarity between Sanofi-produced and 
competitor-produced insulin aspart batches in accordance with EU and US guidelines. Four batches of 
SAR341402 and three batches each of NovoLog and NovoRapid were assessed in a side-by-side 
biological similarity characterization using an extensive set of in vitro activity assays: determination of 
the binding affinity to insulin receptor A (IR-A) and insulin receptor B (IR-B), analysis of the binding 
kinetics to IR-A, IR-B and IGF-1R, measurement of the auto phosphorylation of IR-A, IR-B and IGF-1R, 
determination of the metabolic activity by i) inhibition of lipolysis in human primary adipocytes, ii) 
stimulation of glucose uptake in rat L6 myocytes and iii) gene regulation of glucose 6-phosphatase 
(G6PC) in human primary liver cells, and determination of the mitogenic potency by stimulation of 
radiolabelled thymidine incorporation into DNA in the mammary carcinoma cell line MCF7.

For each in vitro activity assay, weighted geometric means of the respective assay parameters (EC50, 
IC50, ka1, kd1, ka2, kd2) and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated first per batch and 
second per compound. An equivalence approach was used to quantify the differences for each in vitro 
assay between SAR341402, NovoLog and NovoRapid. The ratios of the weighted geometric means of 
each assay parameter with their 90% confidence intervals were calculated for SAR341402 batches / 
NovoLog batches, SAR341402 batches / NovoRapid batches and NovoLog batches / NovoRapid 
batches. The acceptance criteria on the ratio for each assay were defined based on the coefficient of 
variation (CV) % of the individual assay parameters as well as the number of determinations per 
batch. SAR341402 is considered similar to NovoLog and NovoRapid, if the 90% confidence interval of 
the ratio is totally within the acceptance region. 
Determination of binding affinity to insulin receptor A (study DIVT0110): 
IR-A binding affinity was measured with a competitive radio ligand binding assay using plasma 
membranes of CHO cells overexpressing human IR-A and scintillation proximity assay (SPA) 
technology. Four batches of SAR341402 and three batches each of NovoLog and NovoRapid were 
analysed for their potency to inhibit the binding of A14[125I]-labelled human insulin to the human IR-A. 
IC50 values were generated and the weighted geometric mean per compound was calculated as a 
measure of the binding affinity. The IC50 of the affinity of SAR341402 to IR-A was 0.763 nmol/l 
[0.723; 0.806] (n=6 per batch). NovoLog and NovoRapid exhibited an IC50 value of 0.801 nmol/l 
[0.747; 0.858] (n=6 per batch) and 0.790 nmol/l [0.738; 0.846] (n=6 per batch), respectively. 
Table 1 Ratios of mean normalized IC50 values with 90% confidence intervals for IR-A 
The ratio of mean normalized IC50 values between the products are shown in the table above. For 
binding affinity to IR-A, the confidence interval of the ratios of mean normalized IC50 values is well 
within the acceptance interval of 0.80 - 1.25 for the comparison of SAR341402 to NovoLog and 
NovoRapid, respectively, as well as for the comparison between NovoRapid and NovoLog. SAR341402, 
NovoLog and NovoRapid can therefore be considered as similar in the binding affinity to human IR-A. 
Determination of binding affinity to insulin receptor B (study DIVT0111): 
Insulin receptor B binding affinity was measured in the same way with the same number of batches as 
for IR-A (study DIVT0110), using plasma membranes of CHO cells overexpressing IR-B. IC50 values 
were generated and the weighted geometric mean per compound was calculated as a measure of the 
binding affinity to the human IR-B. The affinity of SAR341402 to the human IR-B was 0.657 nmol/l 
[0.621; 0.694] (n=6). NovoLog and NovoRapid exhibited an IC50 value on the human IR-B of 0.667 
nmol/l [0.625; 0.711] (n=6) and 0.686 nmol/l [0.638; 0.738] (n=6), respectively. The ratio of mean 
normalized IC50 values between the products are shown in the below table.

For binding affinity to the human IR-B, the confidence interval of the ratios of mean normalized IC50 
values is well within the 0.80 - 1.25 acceptance interval for the comparison of SAR341402 to NovoLog 
and NovoRapid, respectively, as well as for the comparison between NovoRapid and NovoLog. They can 
therefore be considered as similar. 
Analysis of binding kinetics to insulin receptor A and B (studies DIVT0112 and DIVT0113): 
The binding kinetics to IR-A and to IR-B were assessed using a rapid, real-time, direct interaction 
assay measuring the binding of insulin to an immobilized IR-A via surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 
assessment. The SPR-sensor chip with immobilized IR-A or IR-B was perfused with SAR341402 (four 
batches) or reference compounds (three batches each of NovoLog and NovoRapid) in specified 
concentrations till reaching a stable association maximum (6 experiments per batch). Dissociation was 
measured by switching back to compound-free buffer. Four kinetic constants (ka1, kd1, ka2, and kd2) 
were determined and the weighted geometric means per compound were calculated (see below table). 
Table 3 Weighted geometric means of binding constants, CV and 95% confidence intervals 
by compound for IR-A (left) and IR-B (right)  
For the association and dissociation constants ka1, ka2, kd1, and kd2 the confidence intervals of the 
ratios of the mean association and dissociation constants are well within the 0.70 - 1.43 acceptance 
interval for the comparison of SAR341402 to NovoLog and NovoRapid, respectively, as well as for the 
comparison between NovoRapid and NovoLog. SAR341402, NovoLog and NovoRapid can therefore be 
considered as similar in the IR-A and IR-B binding kinetics (see table below).

Analysis of binding kinetics to IGF-1 receptor (study DIVT0114): 
The binding kinetics to IGF-1R was also assessed by using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. 
Four kinetic constants (ka1, kd1, ka2, and kd2) were determined and the weighted geometric means 
per compound were calculated (Table 11). The overlay of concentration response curves averaged over 
all experiments for the binding kinetics to the human IGF-1R of SAR341402, NovoLog and NovoRapid 
batches and shows that independent of the origin all batches display a similar dynamic range. The 
ratios of mean normalized binding constants are shown in Table 12. 
For the association and dissociation constants ka1, ka2, kd1, and kd2 the confidence intervals of the 
ratios of the mean association and dissociation constants are well within the 0.70 - 1.43 acceptance 
interval for the comparison of SAR341402 to NovoLog and NovoRapid, respectively, as well as for the 
comparison between NovoRapid and NovoLog. SAR341402, NovoLog and NovoRapid can therefore be 
considered as similar in the IGF-1R binding kinetics.

Insulin receptor A autophosphorylation was studied using CHO cells overexpressing IR-A. For detection 
an immunocytochemical microplate assay (In-Cell Western) based on two-colour fluorescence was 
applied. The EC50 value was obtained from a dose response curve of ten concentrations for the insulin 
analogue from each batch. Assays were performed in six experiments in quadruplicates for each 
dilution. Four batches of SAR341402 and three batches each of NovoLog and NovoRapid were 
measured and the weighted geometric mean EC50 per compound was calculated (see below table).

respectively. SAR341402, NovoLog and NovoRapid can therefore be considered as similar in 
stimulating human IR-A autophosphorylation.

Measurement of autophosphorylation of insulin receptor B (study DIVT0116): 
Insulin receptor B autophosphorylation was studied using CHO cells overexpressing IR-B. The ratio of 
mean normalized EC50 values are shown in the below table. The confidence interval of the ratios of 
mean normalized EC50 values is well within the 0.80 - 1.25 acceptance interval for the comparison of 
SAR341402 to NovoLog and NovoRapid, respectively, as well as for the comparison between 
NovoRapid and NovoLog. They can therefore be considered as similar in this assay.

Measurement of autophosphorylation of IGF-1 receptor (study DIVT0117): 
IGF-1 receptor autophosphorylation was studied using mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells 
overexpressing IGF-1R. For detection an immunocytochemical microplate assay (In-Cell Western) 
based on two-colour fluorescence was applied. Four batches of SAR341402 and three batches each of 
NovoLog and NovoRapid were measured and the weighted geometric mean EC50 per compound was 
calculated and normalised (see table below). The confidence intervals of the ratios of mean normalized 
EC50 values are well within the 0.80 - 1.25 acceptance interval, and SAR341402, NovoLog and 
NovoRapid can therefore be considered as similar.

Determination of metabolic activity: inhibition of lipolysis (DIVT0118): 
The inhibition of lipolysis as a metabolic activity of insulin and insulin analogues was measured by 
estimation of glycerol release from in vitro differentiated human adipocytes. Four batches of 
SAR341402 and three batches each of NovoLog and NovoRapid were analyzed (n = 7) and the 
weighted geometric mean IC50 per compound was calculated as a measure of metabolic activity and

normalised (Table 17). For metabolic activity as assessed by inhibition of lipolysis, the confidence 
interval of the ratios of mean normalized IC50 values is well within the 0.75 - 1.33 acceptance interval 
for the comparison of SAR341402 to NovoLog and NovoRapid, respectively, as well as for the 
comparison between NovoRapid and NovoLog. SAR341402, NovoLog and NovoRapid can therefore be 
considered to have similar lipolysis inhibition activities.

Determination of metabolic activity: stimulation of glucose uptake (DIVT0119): 
The stimulation of glucose uptake as a metabolic activity of insulin and insulin analogues was 
measured by uptake of [14C]-labelled glucose in rat L6 myocytes. Four batches of SAR331402 and 
three batches each of NovoLog and NovoRapid were studied (n = 7) and the weighted geometric mean 
EC50 per compound was calculated as a measure of metabolic activity and normalised (see table 
below). The confidence interval of the ratios of mean normalized IC50 values is well within the 0.80 – 
1.25 acceptance interval for the comparison of SAR341402 to NovoLog and NovoRapid, respectively, as 
well as for the comparison between NovoRapid and NovoLog. They can therefore be considered to have 
similar stimulatory activities for glucose uptake.

Determination of metabolic activity: gene regulation of glucose 6-phosphatase (DIVT0120): 
The attenuation of gluconeogenesis gene expression in liver as metabolic activity of insulin and insulin 
analogues was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay. Four 
batches of SAR341402 and three batches each of NovoLog and NovoRapid were analyzed for their 
potency to inhibit the G6PC expression in in vitro primary human hepatocytes. IC50 values for each 
batch were generated and the weighted geometric mean per compound was calculated as a measure of 
G6PC expression, and were normalised (see below table). The confidence interval of the ratios of mean 
normalized IC50 values is well within the 0.80 - 1.25 interval for the comparison of SAR341402 to 
NovoLog and NovoRapid, respectively, as well as for the comparison between NovoRapid and NovoLog. 
SAR341402, NovoLog and NovoRapid can therefore be considered as similar in inhibiting G6PC gene 
expression.

(study DIVT0121): 
The stimulation of [14C]-thymidine incorporation into DNA as a mitogenic potency of insulin and insulin 
analogues was measured using human MCF-7 cells. Four batches of SAR341402 and three batches 
each of NovoLog and NovoRapid were analyzed and the weighted geometric mean EC50 per compound 
was calculated as a measure of mitogenic potency and normalised (see table below). For mitogenic 
potency as assessed by [14C]-thymidine incorporation into DNA, the confidence interval of the ratios of 
mean normalized EC50 values is well within the acceptance interval for the comparison of SAR341402 
to NovoLog and NovoRapid, respectively, as well as for the comparison between NovoRapid and 
NovoLog. SAR341402, NovoLog and NovoRapid can therefore be considered as similar in stimulating 
[14C]-thymidine incorporation into DNA.

Measurement of autophosphorylation of insulin receptor B by the isolated product related substance 
28B-succinimide insulin aspart (study DIVT0109): 
SAR341402 contains the distinct impurity 28B-succinimide insulin aspart that is considered to 
contribute to the test item “assay”, as determined by an RP-HPLC method used for drug product 
release testing. 28B-succinimide insulin aspart is formed upon drug product storage. The aim of this 
study was to compare the in vitro activity of the isolated impurity on the human insulin receptor 
expressed in a CHO cell line. As a reference compound served SAR341402 (batch 7F004). The insulin 
receptor B autophosphorylation was studied using CHO cells overexpressing human IR-B. For detection 
an immunocytochemical microplate assay (In-Cell Western) based on two-colour fluorescence was 
applied. The weighted geometric mean EC50 value obtained for SAR341402 was 7.72 nmol/l (6.90 - 
8.63 nmol/l, n=12); that for 28B-succinimide insulin aspart (batch FFKRO-000096.01) was 20.7 nmol/l 
(18.8 - 22.7 nmol/l, n=12).

The ratio of mean EC50 values between 28B-succinimide insulin aspart and SAR341402 is 2.68 and the 
90% confidence interval of this ratio, (2.43 - 2.95), is completely above 2.4. Thus, 28B-succinimide 
insulin aspart is considered 2.7-fold less potent than SAR341402. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies regarding Secondary Pharmacodynamics were performed. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No studies regarding Secondary Pharmacodynamics were performed. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No comparative studies assessing pharmacodynamic drug interactions were submitted in line with 
relevant guidelines including the CHMP guidance on similar biological medicinal products containing 
recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005 Rev. 1). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
For SAR341402, no studies on non-clinical pharmacokinetics were performed.  
Bioanalytical methods for the quantitation of SAR341402 and assessment of antidrug antibodies in rat 
plasma were developed in support of toxicokinetic evaluations in the 1-month repeat dose toxicity 
studies in rats. A validated specific LC-MS/MS method using immunoaffinity purification was applied for 
the analysis of SAR341402 in rat plasma with a dynamic range of 1 – 500 ng/ml. The accuracy for the 
quantitation of SAR341402 ranged from 97.6 to 107% of nominal values and the total precision ranged 
from 7.40 to 15.9%. At all concentration levels of SAR341402, the ranges of accuracy and precision 
were within established acceptance criteria. For the detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against 
SAR341402 in rat plasma in the 1-month repeat dose toxicokinetic studies, a validated 
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) was applied. The sensitivity was estimated as 26.0 ng/ml. At all 
tested concentration levels of the positive control, the assay is at least tolerant to 5 ng/ml SAR341402 
or NovoRapid/NovoLog. The responses of positive control samples at 250 ng/ml level stayed positive at 
drug concentrations up to 100 ng/ml. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies were performed with SAR341402. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicological development program (see table below) consists of two 1-month repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and a local tolerability study in rabbits. One 1-month repeat-dose toxicity study was 
performed to compare the proposed product SAR341402 to the reference product NovoRapid marketed 
in the EU, the other study to compare to NovoLog marketed in the US, and a local tolerance study to 
compare the proposed product SAR341402 to the reference product NovoRapid marketed in the EU. 
Assessment report

The route of administration followed the clinical, subcutaneous route; the local tolerance study covered 
also possible incidental injections via the intravenous, paravenous and intramuscular routes. 
Table 15 Toxicology program / Batches of SAR341402, NovoRapid EU and NovoLog US 
tested 
The SAR341402 formulation used in the toxicology studies described below was either equal to the 
marketed product NovoLog or equal to the new formulation developed by Sanofi for the intended to be 
marketed biosimilar product and used in clinical trials (Table 22). All toxicology studies required to be 
conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice regulations were conducted in compliance with GLPs. 
An overview of the two repeat dose-toxicity studies in rats is presented in Table 23.

Table 17 Subcutaneous Repeat-Dose Toxicity Studies 
To show similarity of SAR341402 to insulin aspart (NovoRapid EU (study TSA1504) or NovoLog US-
marketed (study TSA1518)) regarding toxicity profile and exposure, Sprague-Dawley rats (7 to 9 
weeks of age) received either solutions of insulin aspart (NovoRapid, NovoLog) or SAR341402 
(formulation equal to NovoLog (study TSA1504) or new Sanofi formulation (study TSA1518)) at 0, 5, 
25 or 100 U/kg/administration by subcutaneous injection twice daily for 1 month, using dose volumes 
of 1.0, 0.05, 0.25 and 1.0 mL/kg, respectively. Control groups received placebo solutions. Rats were 
designated as toxicity or toxicokinetic (TK) phase animals. For the toxicity phase, there were 10 
rats/sex/group. For the TK phase, 6 rats per sex in the control groups and 18 rats per sex in the 
treated groups received the same dosages as the toxicity phase animals. 
Parameters evaluated were mortality, clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, 
blood glucose, haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry and urinalysis. Plasma samples were 
obtained for anti-insulin aspart antibody (AIA) assessment and toxicokinetic determinations. Weights 
of selected organs were recorded, tissues were examined macroscopically and representative tissue 
samples were examined microscopically from rats in both control groups and in the 200 U/kg/day 
groups for both test compounds. Tissues with potential treatment-related findings were also evaluated 
microscopically for rats in the low- and mid-dose groups. Ki-67 staining of the mammary glands was 
done as a parameter for a mitogenic potential of the test compounds. 
One month subcutaneous toxicity study in rats with comparator NovoRapid EU (study TSA1504): 
After subcutaneous administration of either SAR341402 (equal to NovoLog formulation, batch 
SAR341402_11_0046) or NovoRapid EU, rats were systemically exposed to insulin aspart 
concentrations above 1 ng/mL (LLOQ) for up to 4 hours after each administration (see table below).

Table 18 Summary of toxicokinetic parameters for SAR341402 and NovoRapid EU in rats, SC 
No plasma samples of the control group animals tested AIA-positive on Day 29. In the dosed groups, 
however, between 0.0% and 22.2% (mean 13.0%) of all animals were confirmed AIA -negative, and 
between 0.0% and 50.0% (mean 25.0%) were confirmed AIA – positive (see table below). Between 
27.8% and 88.9% (mean 62.0%) of all results were inconclusive due to high insulin aspart plasma 
concentration compared to the drug tolerance level of 5 ng/mL of the AIA assay. Therefore, no distinct 
evaluation about dose- or gender-dependency of the AIA-status could be made. 
Table 19 Summary of percentage of AIA-positive animals for SAR341402 and NovoRapid EU 
in rats, SC 
The twice daily subcutaneous administration of NovoRapid and SAR341402 formulation for 1 month to 
rats at doses of 10, 50 and 200 U/kg/day resulted in hunched posture and mild lethargy. The observed 
increases in body weight, body weight gain, food consumption, glucose and phosphorous are all linked 
to either the direct or indirect pharmacological reactions to the administration of insulin. There were no 
systemic toxic effects related to either NovoRapid or SAR341402 formulation administration. However, 
red skin discoloration was observed in the injection sites and was increased at 200 U/kg/day in both 
sexes with NovoRapid and males only with SAR341402 formulation. Microscopically, both compounds 
induced an increase in the incidence and/or severity of subcutaneous changes associated with the 
route of administration (haemorrhage and/or inflammation) at 200 U/kg/day. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020

Therefore, under these study conditions, the NOAEL was considered to be 200 U/kg/day for both sexes 
and for both compounds. Based on the results of this study, SAR341402 and NovoRapid showed similar 
pharmacological activity. The toxicokinetic profile also demonstrated similarity between SAR341402 
and NovoRapid. 
One month subcutaneous toxicity study in rats with comparator NovoLog US (study TSA1518): 
After administration of either SAR341402 or NovoLog US, rats were systemically exposed to insulin 
aspart concentrations above 1 ng/mL (LLOQ) for up to 4 hours after each administration, except at 
Day 1 for males given 50 U SAR341402 /kg/day (until 7 hours), and males and females given 10 U 
NovoLog /kg/day (until 6 hours), and for females given 50 U NovoLog /kg/day (until 7 hours). 
Additionally, on Day 1, plasma levels of NovoLog were only quantifiable until 2 or 3 hours post dose for 
some animals given 10 and 50 U/kg/day. Following repeated administration of SAR341402 for 4-weeks 
(Day 29), exposure patterns were similar, though firm conclusions could not be made for males and 
females given 10 U/kg/day and males given 200 U/kg/day, as much of the analytical data was not 
reportable due to technical constrains. Overall, there did not appear to be any significant differences in 
the toxicokinetic parameters between the two compounds dosed (see table below). 
Table 20 Summary of toxicokinetic parameters for SAR341402 and NovoLog US in rats, SC 
No plasma samples of the control group animals were reported as AIA-positive on Day 29. In the 
SAR341402 dosed groups, between 27.8% and 66.7% (mean 45.4%) of all animals were confirmed as 
AIA positive (see table below). Specifically, six, twelve and five of eighteen (33.3%, 66.7% and 
27.8%) male rats, and twelve, nine and five of eighteen (66.7%, 50.0% and 27.8%) female rats, in 
the 10, 50 and 200 U/kg/day dose groups respectively, were AIA-positive on Day 29. In the NovoLog 
dosed groups, between 11.1% and 55.6% (mean 27.8%) of all animals were confirmed as AIA 
positive. Specifically, seven, four and two of eighteen (38.9%, 22.2% and 11.1%) male rats, and ten, 
four and three of eighteen (55.6%, 22.2% and 16.7%) female rats, in the 10, 50 and 200 U/kg/day 
dose groups respectively, were AIA-positive on Day 29. Between 16.7% and 88.9% (mean 56.9%) of 
all results were inconclusive due to high SAR341402/Insulin Aspart plasma concentration compared to 
the drug tolerance level of 5 ng/mL of the AIA assay. Therefore, no distinct evaluation about dose- or 
gender-dependency of the AIA-status can be made.

Table 21 Summary of percentage of AIA-positive animals for SAR341402 and NovoLog US in 
rats 
There were two premature deaths out of 336 treated animals during the study; one TK phase female 
at 50 U/kg/day NovoLog was found dead on Day 20 and one toxicity phase female at 200 U/k/day 
SAR341402 was found dead on Day 30. It was suspected that these deaths resulted from test 
compound-induced hypoglycaemia. All remaining animals survived to scheduled termination. 
The exposed rats showed mild hunched posture, raised fur and lethargy, and also increases in body 
weight, body weight gain, food consumption, glucose and phosphorous, which are linked to either the 
direct or indirect pharmacological reactions to the administration of insulin. Mean liver weight was 
significantly lower in males at 10, 50, 200 U/kg/day NovoLog and in females at 50 U/kg/day 
SAR341402 and significantly higher mean kidney weight in males at 50 and 200 U/kg/day NovoLog 
and 50 U/kg/day SAR341402. Microscopic examination at 200 U/kg/day showed reduced glycogenic 
vacuolation in the liver (correlating with decreased liver weight) in both sexes with both compounds 
compared to controls. This effect, and the higher kidney weight, were judged to have a physiological 
and not a toxicological basis. Neither compound was found to exacerbate the effects of mechanical 
damage at the injection site. Therefore, under these study conditions, the NOAEL was considered to be 
200 U/kg/day for both sexes and for both compounds. Based on the results of this study, SAR341402 
and NovoLog showed similar pharmacological activity. The toxicokinetic profile also demonstrated 
similarity between SAR341402 and NovoLog. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were performed with SAR341402. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed with SAR341402. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were performed with SAR341402.

Local Tolerance  
Local subcutaneous, intravenous, paravenous and intramuscular tolerance study in male rabbits (study 
TOL1161): 
SAR341402 Sanofi formulation (100 U/mL, batch SAR341402_12_0150) was injected as single 
subcutaneous (SC, 0.1 mL), intravenous (IV, 0.5 mL), paravenous (PV, 0.1 mL) or intramuscular (IM, 
0.5 mL) dose, respectively to 4 groups of 3 New Zealand White male rabbits. Each rabbit was dosed 
either by the combination of the IM and the PV routes or the IV and the SC routes. In the same 
conditions, four other groups of 3 animals received a marketed NovoRapid formulation (100 U/mL) and 
served as reference groups. As a control, 0.9% NaCl was injected contra-laterally for the SC and IM 
routes in all these groups, and two distinct groups of 3 animals received 0.9% NaCl on both ears, by IV 
or PV routes. 
Local tolerance (at the injection site), mortality and clinical signs were assessed before administration 
and several times after administration. Body weight was evaluated on Day-1 and on the scheduled day 
of euthanasia. At necropsy (performed 24 h or 120 h after administration), the injection sites of all 
rabbits were dissected, examined and fixed for histological assessment.  
No general toxicity, as assessed through absence of clinical signs, mortality and body weight changes, 
was reported during the study.  
Local tolerance evaluation (erythema, edema, hematoma and eschar/ulcer) showed that NovoRapid 
and control were very well tolerated when administered by the SC, IM, IV and PV routes. SAR341402 
was also very well tolerated when administered by the SC and IM routes, however, it was less 
tolerated than 0.9% NaCl or NovoRapid when administered by the IV and PV routes. When 
administered IV or PV, SAR341402 mildly increased severity, incidence and/or distribution of acute to 
subacute changes (oedema, fibrin deposits, haemorrhages and inflammation) 24 hours after 
administration. After 120 hours, SAR341402 slightly increased severity of chronic inflammation 
compared to NaCl 0.9%, but similar to that observed with NovoRapid. Consequently, SAR341402 was 
considered as well tolerated following intravenous and paravenous administration, with a possible 
slight local irritation. 
Overall SAR341402 and NovoRapid were considered to be similar regarding local tolerability because 
no significant difference was observed. 
Other toxicity studies 
No additional immunotoxicology testing is required based on a weight of evidence review for compound 
NovoRapid. The weight of evidence review is based on the absence of immunotoxic findings in standard 
toxicity studies, lack of demonstrated pharmacologic activity affecting the immune system, no 
demonstrated structural similarities to known immunomodulatory compounds, the absence of elevated 
distribution of compound and/or its metabolites to organs/cells of the immune system. 
No photosafety testing is considered necessary since insulins/insulin analogues are not described in the 
literature to have phototoxic potential and photosafety testing is not required in the current ICHS6 
guideline for biopharmaceuticals. 
No studies have been performed on SAR341402 metabolites and impurities.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of 5 medicinal products for 
human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 Rev.1), the applicant did not submit any ERA studies as the 
active substance of SAR341402 (insulin aspart) is a natural substance (insulin analogue), the use of 
which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, 
SAR341402 is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
According to the Guideline on the non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal 
products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues, sufficient different biological 
assays have been performed for demonstrating the biosimilarity of Insulin aspart Sanofi for in vitro 
receptor binding, receptor autophosphorylation and metabolic activity assays with the reference 
product NovoRapid. 
However, after a request of statistical reports on biosimilarity studies, which were not submitted with 
the initial MAA, it appeared that the in vitro biosimilar studies DIVT0112 and DIVT0113 were originally 
negative in biosimilarity outcome, and have been re-examined, without notification and discussion in 
the studies and in the Non-clinical Summary. The Applicant was requested to provide a thorough 
explanation of the handling of data, why studies DIVT0112 and DIVT0113 have been re-examined, 
why different batches have been used and why this has not been discussed in the originally submitted 
dossier. The Applicant provided during the evaluation additional information on the in vitro binding 
studies for the insulin receptor A and B, and IGF-1R. These binding kinetic studies (reports DIVT0112, 
DIVT0113 and DIVT0114) were outsourced to a CRO. After measurement on IRA and IRB, it was noted 
by the CRO that “not enough volume was left of three of the samples to finish all replicates”, and the 
“volume remaining in the tubes varied although they had used essentially the same amount of each 
sample”. Unfortunately, the cause of these deviations is not known. The CRO requested new samples, 
apparently only for measurement of IGF-1R. The statistical results of all measurements were reported 
in Report 1, with the conclusion that the binding kinetics to IRA and IRB showed insufficient evidence 
to conclude similarity between SAR341402 and NovoLog and between SAR341402 and NovoRapid. 
Kinetics of IGF-1R showed similarity. Apparently thereafter, the results on IRA and IRB were not 
trusted, and new samples were sent to the CRO. Samples of the same batches were sent except for 
reference batches NovoLog (FZF0501) and NovoRapid (FP51731), which meanwhile had expired and 
thus were replaced by new batches NovoLog (HS65D84) and NovoRapid (GS62P40). This time, all 
results showed acceptable similarity. The statistical results of these new measurements were reported 
first in Report 2, a draft, and finally in Report 3. However, the Applicant did not submit one of these 
statistical reports with the initial MAA, and the separate similarity studies (DIVT0110 to DIVT0121), 
also of other in vitro endpoints, referred in a random way to Report 1, 2 and 3 for the statistical data, 
which caused confusion on important issues and thus the major objection. To conclude the Applicant 
provided sufficient information to explain the reasons for re-analyzing samples for studies DIVT0112 
and DIVT0113, and provided new updated documents with corrected references satisfactorily 
addressing the issue. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Validated assays for the quantitation of SAR341402 and for the assessment of anti-drug antibodies in 
rat plasma were developed in support of toxicokinetic evaluations performed for the studies on 
toxicology of SAR341402.

Toxicology 
Toxicology studies usually are not required for insulin biosimilar applications. Nevertheless, the 
Applicant performed two 1-month repeated-dose toxicokinetic studies in rats to determine biosimilarity 
of SAR341402 with NovoRapid (EU) and NovoLog (US). No difference in toxicity, kinetics and ADA-
forming were detected.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The submitted non-clinical comparability exercise was considered appropriate. Relevant regulatory 
guidelines were taken into consideration. 
Based on the results submitted, Insulin aspart Sanofi can be considered similar to the reference 
product NovoRapid in terms of in vitro functionality and toxicological, toxicokinetic and local tolerance 
profiles. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as claimed by the 
applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study PDY12695 
The comparative pharmacokinetics of SAR341402 and the insulin aspart EU and US reference products 
NovoRapid and NovoLog, respectively, were investigated in a single-dose euglycemic clamp study 
PDY12695 in male patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It was a randomized, double-blind cross-over 
study. 
Insulin aspart in plasma was analysed using a validated LC-MS/MS method.  
Primary pharmacokinetic parameters were Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf. Secondary pharmacokinetic 
parameters were tmax, AUC0-2, AUC4-tlast, tx%-AUC, tlast and t1/2z.  
To demonstrate bioequivalence, the 90% confidence intervals were calculated for Cmax, AUClast and 
AUCinf, using the (0.80-1.25) acceptance range. Prior to analysis, the parameters were log-transformed 
(natural log). A linear mixed-effects model was used with fixed terms for sequence, period and 
treatment and random term for subject-within-sequence, with treatment-specific between-subject and 
within-subject variances. For AUC0-2, AUC4-tlast and t1/2z, 90% confidence intervals were calculated for 
the ratios using the linear mixed effect model as described for the primary PK parameters. Tx%-AUC 
and tmax were analyzed non-parametrically based on the Hodges-Lehmann method for paired treatment 
comparisons. 90% confidence intervals for pair-wise medians of treatment differences were derived. 
A total of 30 subjects were included in the study, one of whom discontinued after dosing in the second 
treatment period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020  
Page 39/90 
 
 
 
 
The 90% confidence interval (CI) was between the acceptance limits of 0.80-1.25 for Cmax, AUClast and 
AUCinf for SAR341402 vs EU reference NovoRapid. Unity was included in the CI for Cmax, but this was 
not the case for AUClast and AUCinf. Partial AUCs were provided by the Applicant and show that AUC0-2 
was within the limits, but AUC4-tlast appeared lower for SAR341402 than for NovoRapid with the lower 
confidence limit for the ratio below 0.8. There was no significant difference in terminal half-life.

Study PDY15287 
The comparative pharmacokinetics of SAR341402 and the insulin aspart reference product NovoRapid 
(Japan) were investigated in a single-dose euglycemic clamp study PDY15287 in male healthy 
Japanese subjects. It was a randomized, double-blind cross-over study. Insulin aspart in plasma was 
analysed using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Primary pharmacokinetic parameters were Cmax, 
AUClast and AUCinf. Secondary pharmacokinetic parameters were tmax and t1/2z. To demonstrate 
bioequivalence, the 90% confidence intervals were calculated for Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf, using the 
(0.80-1.25) acceptance range. Prior to analysis, the parameters were log-transformed. A linear mixed-
effects model was used to analyse Cmax, AUClast, AUCinf and T1/2z. Tmax was analysed non-parametrically 
based on the Hodges-Lehmann method.  
A total of 40 subjects was included in the study, one of whom withdrew his consent before the second 
treatment period. 
The 90% confidence interval (CI) was between the acceptance limits of 80.00-125.00 for Cmax, AUClast 
and AUCinf for SAR341402 vs reference NovoRapid. Unity was included (see table below).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Study PDY12695, was conducted to demonstrate that the proposed commercial formulation of Insulin 
aspart Sanofi (SAR341402) solution has PK and PD profiles similar to that of NovoLog/NovoRapid. This 
study was a cross-over, double-blind, euglycemic clamp study, conducted in patients with T1DM, to 
investigate the relative bioavailability and activity compared to NovoLog and NovoRapid. A Williams 
design for comparing 3 formulations comprising 6 sequences and 3 periods was chosen for this study. 
Patients included in the study had fasting serum C-peptide concentrations below 0.3 nmol/L (as 
assessed by local laboratory) to ensure absence of relevant remaining endogenous insulin secretion. In 
order to minimize the interference of anti-insulin antibodies on the PK and PD of SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid, anti-insulin antibody positive patients (based on local laboratory assessment) 
were excluded from the study. 
Insulin aspart Sanofi, NovoLog and NovoRapid were given as single SC injections of 0.3 U/kg; this dose 
was well characterized to provide strong effects in the euglycemic clamp (i.e. glucose demand reflected 
in a sizeable glucose infusion rate (GIR) up to 12 hours) in patients with T1DM. Patients were under 
fasted conditions and remained fasting throughout the test to avoid a confounding effect on study 
results. Measures were undertaken to minimize carry-over effects from the patients’ last insulin 
injection. In addition, the clamp blood glucose target, without any glucose infusion, was to be achieved 
for the last hour prior to investigational medicinal product (IMP) dosing. 
Due to the short duration of action of insulin aspart after SC administration, a 12-hour clamp was 
deemed sufficient to adequately monitor the patients and account for individual variations in insulin 
elimination and PD profile. Accordingly, a minimum washout of 5 days was considered acceptable 
between each dose administration. 
The primary PK endpoints included the area under the concentration versus time curve extrapolated to 
infinity (AUC), the area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to the time 
corresponding to the last concentration above the limit of quantification (AUClast) and the maximum 
observed concentration of insulin aspart (Cmax). The primary PD endpoint was the area under the 
body weight standardized GIR versus time curve from 0 to 12 hours post-insulin aspart administration 
(GIR AUC0-12h). 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin aspart, similar to endogenous insulin, binds to the transmembrane insulin receptor that is 
expressed almost ubiquitously in the cells of the human body. The insulin receptor plays a key role in 
the regulation of glucose homeostasis, inducing glucose uptake in peripheral tissues and inhibition of 
hepatic glucose production by decreasing gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. 
The isoglycaemic clamp technique was originally developed to measure tissue sensitivity to insulin. By 
keeping the glucose concentration constant, the physiological glucose insulin feedback loop, whereby 
the glucose concentration directly influences the insulin concentration and vice versa is disrupted. The 
amount of IV glucose required to maintain (or ‘clamp’) the glucose concentration at the euglycaemic 
target level is equal to the glucose uptake of all tissues and is expressed as glucose infusion rate (GIR) 
over time. When aiming to determine the glucose lowering effect of an insulin preparation the recorded 
GIR after SC injection provides a quantitative measure of its metabolic activity (i.e. the sum of the 
decrease in hepatic glucose production and the increase in glucose uptake) over time.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Study PDY12695 
The PD effect of insulin aspart was evaluated using the euglycemic clamp technique. Insulin aspart 
formulations were administered as single subcutaneous (SC) injections of 0.3 U/kg under fasted 
conditions. 
During the euglycemic clamp, the blood glucose concentration and the glucose infusion rate (GIR), 
needed to keep a subject's blood glucose concentration at its target level (5.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL)), 
were continuously measured and recorded using a continuous glucose monitoring system (Biostator). 
The clamp was prematurely terminated in case blood glucose (BG) consistently exceeded 11.1 mmol/L 
(200 mg/dL) with no glucose infusion for the last 30 minutes. 
The primary PD endpoint evaluated in study PDY12695 was the area under the body weight 
standardized glucose infusion rate (GIR) versus time curve from 0 to 12 hours post-insulin aspart 
administration (GIR-AUC 0-12h). GIRmax was defined as a secondary PD parameter in the study 
protocol (finalized 7 August 2012).  Other secondary PD parameters were GIR-AUC0-2, GIR-AUC4-12, 
GIR-tmax, tx%-GIR-AUC0-12, duration of euglycemia at ≤ 5.8 mmol/L/105 mg/dL and durations of 
blood glucose at ≤ 6.1, 7.2, and 8.3 mmol/L (110, 130, and 150 mg/dL).  
The 90% and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for GIR-AUC0-12h, GIRmax, GIR-AUC0-2, and 
GIR-AUC4-12. An acceptance range of 0.80-1.25 was used to conclude on biosimilarity. Prior to 
analysis, the parameters were log-transformed (natural log). A linear mixed-effects model was used 
with fixed terms for sequence, period and treatment and random term for subject-within-sequence, 
with treatment-specific between-subject and within-subject variances. Tx%-GIR-AUC0-12 and GIR-
tmax were analysed non-parametrically based on Hodges-Lehmann method for paired treatment 
comparisons. 90% CIs for pairwise medians of treatment differences were derived. 
A total of 30 subjects were included in the study, one of whom discontinued after dosing in the second 
treatment period. 
Mean smoothed standardized GIR profiles for SAR341402, NovoLog and NovoRapid at 0.3 U/kg were 
similar (Figure 9).  
The primary PD variable GIR-AUC0-12h was similar for all 3 insulin formulations as the 90% CI of 
ratios were within the predefined acceptance range of 0.80 to 1.25 (Table 32). The corresponding 95% 
CI also met the acceptance range of 0.80 to 1.25. Furthermore, also the secondary endpoint of GIRmax 
was similar for the 3 insulin aspart products, with 90% and 95% CIs of the treatment ratios entirely 
within the predefined acceptance range of 0.80 to 1.25 (Table 33).

Table 28. Statistical analyses of secondary pharmacodynamic variable GIR-AUCs- Point 
estimates of treatment ratio with 90% and 95% confidence intervals 
Study PDY15287 
The PD effect of insulin aspart was evaluated using the euglycemic clamp technique. Insulin aspart 
formulations were administered as single subcutaneous (SC) injections of 0.3 U/kg under fasted 
conditions. The target blood glucose level was defined as 5 mg/dL (0.28 mmol/L) below the subject’s 
fasting baseline blood glucose concentration. The primary pharmacodynamic endpoints were GIRmax 
and GIR-AUC0-10h. Secondary pharmacodynamics endpoint was GIR-tmax. To demonstrate 
bioequivalence, the 90% confidence intervals were calculated for GIRmax and GIR-AUC0-10h, using the 
(0.80-1.25) acceptance range. Prior to analysis, the parameters were log-transformed. A linear mixed-
effects model was used to analyse GIRmax and GIR-AUC0-10h. GIR-tmax was analysed non-parametrically 
based on the Hodges-Lehmann method. 
A total of 40 subjects was included in the study, one of whom withdrew his consent before the second 
treatment period. Five other subjects were not included in the statistical analyses due to operational 
errors during the clamp procedure. 
The 90% confidence interval (CI) was between the acceptance limits of 0.80-1.25 for GIR-AUC0-10h and 
for GIRmax for SAR341402 versus reference NovoRapid. Unity was included (see table below).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The study design of the euglycemic clamp study PDY12695 was in accordance with the guideline on the 
non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant 
human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev 1).  
The methods for the analyses of insulin aspart and anti-SAR341402 antibodies in plasma were 
adequately validated. The content of test and reference product was similar.   
Regarding the comparison of SAR341402 and the EU reference product NovoRapid, the 90% 
confidence intervals for the primary PK parameters Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf were within the limits of 
0.80-1.25. No apparent difference was observed for t1/2. Unity was included in the confidence interval 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020

for Cmax, but not for AUClast and AUCinf. Further, partial AUC in the first two hours after 
administration was within the 0.80-1.25 limits but partial AUC4-12 hours appears lower for SAR341402 
than for NovoRapid with the lower confidence limit for the ratio below 0.8. A discussion on these topics 
was provided by the Applicant. Considering that AUC4h-last actually only covers a minor part of total 
AUC (less than 15%), and considering the high variability in AUC after 4 h, the relevance of this 
difference is considered limited. With respect to unity not being included in the 90% CI for AUC, no 
further indications for differences in elimination of the products were apparent. Furthermore, in the 
additional euglycemic clamp study PDY15287 conducted in Japanese healthy subjects which was 
provided by the Applicant during the evaluation, the 90% confidence interval was between the 
acceptance limits of 0.80-1.25 for Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf for SAR341402 versus reference 
NovoRapid, with unity included. This study provides therefore additional support for the biosimilarity of 
SAR341402 and NovoRapid. 
The large variation in half-life appeared to be caused by an unusual long half-life in one subject. The 
exclusion of this value from the statistical analysis reduced the standard deviation for SAR341402 from 
1.46 h to 0.378 h and the coefficient of variation from 126.3% to 42.5%. Furthermore, the arithmetic 
and geometric means decreased from 1.15 h to 0.890 h and from 0.897 h to 0.827 h, respectively. 
These values obtained after exclusion of the unusual long half-life value are similar to the respective 
values measured for the reference products. 
The unbalanced time profile suggests that the absorption is initially faster in SAR341402 compared 
with the reference NovoRapid. To better understand the absorption rate difference between the two 
products, the Applicant was asked to consider population PK/PD modelling of study PDY12695 data.  
The POP-PK analysis showed slight differences in typical values of AUC4h-12 of insulin aspart 
concentrations and corresponding PD parameter GIR AUC4h-12. However, given the overlap between 
the confidence intervals formed by the uncertainty of the typical values, it is apparent that neither the 
profiles nor the derived AUCs allows to conclude that they are different. Considering the limited 
contribution of AUC4h-last to the total AUC and the result of the additional study in Japanese subjects, 
as mentioned above, the difference in concentrations of insulin aspart in the 4-12 h period is not 
considered clinically relevant. 
The Insulin aspart Sanofi formulation is different from the originator in several aspects. The Applicant 
was asked to justify the composition of Insulin aspart Sanofi from a biopharmaceutical viewpoint by 
showing that composition difference is not expected to affect the in vivo oligomer association rates. 
The Applicant performed additional in vitro studies to investigate the formulation effect which were 
submitted during the evaluation. A difference was observed regarding the maximum dimension, which 
was however difficult to interpret. It is agreed that further in vitro modelling studies would not help to 
understand the formulation effect on the absorption process. 
According to the guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal 
producs containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev 1), GIR-AUC(0-t) and GIRmax should be the primary endpoints 
for rapid insulins and for primary PD parameters and the 95% confidence intervals of the ratio 
test/reference should be contained within the pre-defined equivalence margins. In contrast to the 
relevant CHMP guideline, GIRmax was defined as secondary endpoint in the study protocol. However, as 
the study protocol was finalised before the first draft revision of the guideline on the clinical 
development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant insulin analogues was 
published, this is considered acceptable by the CHMP. Nevertheless, GIR-AUC(0-t) and GIRmax were 
assessed as primary endpoints according to the guideline. 
The 95% CI for the ratio of treatments of both GIR-AUC0-12h (primary endpoint) and GIRmax 
(secondary endpoint) were narrow and well within the equivalence margin of 80%-125%, indicating 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020  
Page 48/90 
 
 
 
similar PD profiles of SAR341402, NovoRapid and Novolog. Partial GIR-AUC after 4 hours appears 
lower for SAR341402 than for NovoRapid with the lower confidence limit for the ratio below 0.8, 
apparently in line with the lower insulin aspart partial AUC after 4 hours. However, considering the low 
contribution of GIR-AUC after 4 h to total GIR-AUC (less than 20%), the relevance of this difference 
can be considered limited. Moreover, in the additional euglycemic clamp study PDY15287 in Japanese 
healthy subjects which was provided in the second round, the 90% confidence interval was between 
the acceptance limits of 0.80-1.25 for GIR-AUC0-10h and for GIRmax for SAR341402 versus reference 
NovoRapid, with unity included. This study provides therefore additional support for the biosimilarity of 
SAR341402 and NovoRapid. The derivation of GIRmax and GIR-tmax was based upon the smoothed 
individual profiles using a locally weighted regression in smoothing scatter plots (LOESS smoothing 
technique). In this technique, a smoothing factor of 6% was used. The smoothing factor was selected 
to balance the noise in the GIR to a reasonable extent, as stronger smoothing could reduce the 
sensitivity of the study whereas weaker smoothing could leave much of the noise with potentially 
higher variability. The factor of 6% was chosen based on previous experience with GIR profiles for 
other fast acting insulins. The quality of the glucose clamp is considered acceptable.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK and PD results from study PDY12695 demonstrated similarity between SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid. This is supported by the results from the comparative PK/PD study in healthy 
Japanese subjects (study PDY15287). 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
As this application relates to a biosimilar product, there is no requirement for dose-response studies. 
The proposed dosing regimens for Insulin aspart Sanofi are identical to those approved for NovoRapid. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
In support of similar efficacy of SAR341402, one phase 3 study, EFC15081, was conducted in patients 
with diabetes mellitus (T1DM or T2DM) to compare the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of 
SAR341402 to NovoLog/NovoRapid in the target populations. No additional clinical study was planned 
to support the registration of SAR341402 solution in the EU.

SAR341402 to NovoLog/NovoRapid in Adult Patients With Diabetes Mellitus Also Using 
Insulin Glargine, with a 6-month Safety Extension Period 
Methods 
Study Participants 
Important inclusion criteria included adult patients who had been diagnosed with T1DM or T2DM for at 
least 1 year at the time of the screening visit, who had been on a multiple daily injection regimen of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020  
Page 49/90 
 
 
 
 
 
NovoLog/NovoRapid or insulin lispro (100 U/mL) for at least 6 months before screening in combination 
with insulin glargine for at least 6 months or in combination with insulin detemir for at least 12 months 
before the screening visit and who had a screening HbA1c between 7.0% and 10.0%. 
Exclusion criteria were mainly related to the patients’ underlying health status and especially unstable 
conditions that might interfere with the evaluation of efficacy and safety of SAR341402.  
With respect to background therapy, any glucose-lowering agents other than the IMP (i.e. SAR341402 
or NovoLog/NovoRapid) and the mandatory basal insulin (Lantus) were prohibited during the study. 
However, patients with T2DM using oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) at a stable dose in the last 3 
months before screening could continue using them on stable dose except sulfonylureas, which were to 
be discontinued at baseline and were prohibited during the study. Furthermore, systemic 
glucocorticoids at doses greater than a replacement for more than 10 days and initiation of body 
weight loss drugs were also not permitted during the screening period and the randomized open-label 
treatment periods. 
Treatment 
The study included 4 periods (see figure below): 
•  An up to 2-week screening period, during which the patients’ eligibility criteria were checked 
and patients were trained on study procedures such as regular SMPG measurements, diary 
entries (e-diary) and how to correctly inject the IMP (SAR341402 or NovoLog/NovoRapid) and 
non-investigational medicinal product (NIMP) (Lantus); 
•  A main 26 weeks open-label comparative efficacy and safety period; 
•  A 26 weeks open-label comparative safety extension period; 
•  A 1-day post-treatment safety follow-up period.

Investigational medicinal products (IMP) 
All subjects received diet and lifestyle counselling consistent with the recommendations of international 
or local guidelines and practices by a Healthcare professional at randomization. 
In the 26-week study period and 26-week comparative safety extension period, SAR341402 was 
compared with Novolog (investigational sites in the US) and NovoRapid (investigational sites in Europe 
and Japan). 
SAR341402 was self-administered by SC injection using disposable SoloStar prefilled pens containing a 
3 ml cartridge, allowing a maximum dose of SAR341402 per injection of 80 units and a minimum dose 
of 1 unit.  
NovoLog/NovoRapid was self-administered by SC injection using the disposable FlexPen prefilled pen, 
allowing a maximum dose of the insulin aspart, per injection, of 60 units and a minimum dose of 1 
unit.  
SAR341402 or NovoLog/NovoRapid were to be injected before the start of a meal, as part of a multiple 
daily injection (MDI) regimen, according to NovoLog and NovoRapid labelling. Occasional postprandial 
injections soon after a meal were to be done if deemed necessary and if allowed by the national 
product label for NovoLog/NovoRapid. 
Patients randomized to SAR341402 or NovoLog/NovoRapid, started treatment with a unit to unit 
conversion from the insulin lispro or NovoLog/NovoRapid dose used prior to the trial or with a dose at 
the discretion of the investigator, taking into account the glucose control at the time of randomization. 
During the study, doses of either SAR341402 or NovoLog/NovoRapid were to be adjusted to achieve a 
2-hour postprandial plasma glucose <10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL), while avoiding hypoglycemia. For the 
purpose of the protocol, 2 hours postprandial is defined as 2 hours after the start of the meal. If pre-
prandial glucose tests were used, the recommended target range for fasting, pre-prandial plasma 
glucose was 4.4 to 7.2 mmol/L (80 to 130 mg/dL), while avoiding hypoglycaemia. 
Non-investigational medicinal products (NIMP) 
All the patients used Lantus (SC injection once daily) as the mandatory basal insulin therapy during the 
study. The time of injection (hh:mm) was to be determined at randomization according to patient and 
site preference and was not to be changed throughout the study. 
Objectives/endpoints 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of SAR341402 solution compared to 
NovoLog/NovoRapid in terms of HbA1c change from baseline to Week 26. A non-inferiority margin of 
0.3% HbA1c was defined, in line with recommendations by regulatory agencies and based on historical 
precedent for comparative insulin studies in which a 0.3% non-inferiority margin is often used. 
Secondary efficacy objectives included:   
•  Relationship of anti-insulin aspart antibodies (AIAs) with efficacy parameters (HbA1c) and 
insulin dose 
• 
Efficacy of SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid in terms of: 
- 
Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7% at Week 26 
-  Change from baseline to Week 26 in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020  
Page 51/90 
 
 
 
 
-  Change from baseline to Week 26 in mean 24-hour plasma glucose concentration based on 
7-point self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) profiles taken before and 2 hours after each 
main meal, and at bedtime 
-  Change from baseline to Week 26 in postprandial plasma glucose excursions (the 
difference between 2-hour postprandial and pre-prandial plasma glucose values at 
breakfast, lunch and dinner) based on 7-point SMPG profiles. 
In addition, the potential effect of anti-insulin aspart antibody on glycemic control and insulin dose was 
assessed. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified by geographical region (Europe, US, Japan), type of diabetes mellitus 
(T1DM, T2DM [T2DM only for US]), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value at screening (<8.0%, ≥8.0%), 
and prior use of NovoLog/NovoRapid (Yes, No). The patients were randomized to either SAR341402 or 
NovoLog/NovoRapid in a 1:1 ratio. Depending on the geographical location of the investigational sites, 
patients randomized to the comparator received the regionally approved product: patients with T1DM 
or T2DM in the US received NovoLog; patients with T1DM in Europe and Japan received NovoRapid. 
Blinding (masking)  
Study EFC15081 used an open-label design as the pre-filled, disposable pen injection devices for 
SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid were distinguishable and could not be made identical. Use of a 
double-dummy design was not deemed adequate for practical and ethical reasons as such design 
would require doubling of the number of prandial injections, which may increase the risk of medication 
errors (including lack of compliance to double dosing of prandial injections) and a comparator placebo 
product is not available. 
HbA1c (for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis), FPG and AIA were measured at central certified 
laboratories blinded to the treatment received. 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis of non-inferiority for change in HbA1c from baseline was performed on the ITT 
population using an ANCOVA model including treatment group, randomisation strata and baseline 
HbA1c, with a non-inferiority margin of 0.3%. If the primary endpoint was statistically significant, the 
secondary endpoint inverse non-inferiority was tested in a sequential inferential approach. 
Missing data were handled with a multiple imputation approach, which took into account the treatment 
status of the patients (adhering or not), using observed data from patients with the same status to 
impute missing data. As sensitivity analyses, a return to baseline imputation and a tipping-point 
analysis were planned, and the primary analysis was repeated in the PP population. 
Secondary endpoints were analysed with the same ANCOVA model as for the primary endpoint. 
Responder endpoints were analysed using a logistic regression model with the same terms as in the 
ANCOVA model.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 597 adult patients (SAR341402: 301; NovoLog/NovoRapid: 296 [165/131, respectively]) 
were randomized in the Phase 3 study EFC15081 (see figure below). A similar percentage of patients in 
each treatment group completed the main 6-month treatment period (SAR341402: 92.7%, 
NovoLog/NovoRapid: 92.6%). The most common reason for treatment discontinuation occurred in the 
category “Other” (SAR341402: 4.3% [13 patients]; NovoLog/NovoRapid: 5.4% [16 patients]) and was 
primarily related to a patient decision or consent withdrawal. 
Figure 8 Study EFC15081- Patient disposition 
Protocol deviations 
The percentage of critical or major deviations were generally comparable between both groups (43.2% 
and 38.5% in the SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid groups, respectively), and also well balanced 
across the treatment groups within the different categories of protocol deviations. 
During the conduct of the phase 3 study, the majority of the patients (70.9%; 197/197 (100%) of the 
patients in Europe, 226/335 (67%) in the US and 0% in Japan) have been exposed to defective 
glucose test strips to be used for collecting SMPG measurements. The average blood glucose reading 
with the defective strips was between 0.1% and 14.8% higher than the average values obtained with 
non-defective test strips.

Baseline data 
Baseline characteristics of study EFC15081 are presented in Table 36 and Table 37. The demographic 
and disease characteristics are well distributed across the two treatment groups. The majority of the 
patients had T1DM (83.2%), 82.6% of the patients were white and the median age was 49.0 years 
with approximately 17% of the patients who were 65 years or older. This study was a multicentre 
study and patients were recruited across the globe. 33% of the patients were from Europe, 56% from 
US and 11% from Japan.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary objective of study EFC15081 in T1DM and T2DM was to show non-inferiority of 
SAR341402 versus NovoLog/NovoRapid based on the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 with 
a non-inferiority margin of 0.3%.  
Non-inferiority of SAR341402 over NovoLog/NovoRapid was demonstrated as the upper bound of the 
2-sided 95% CI of the difference between SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid was below the 
predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3%, indicating that the primary objective was met (see table 
and figure below). 
There were few missing data for HbA1c. At Week 26, 36 patients (SAR341402: 18 patients [6.0%]; 
NovoLog/NovoRapid: 18 patients [6.1%]) had missing HbA1c, half of them due to premature 
treatment discontinuation and subsequent study discontinuation. Sensitivity analyses assessing the 
effect of missing data (return-to-baseline multiple imputation and tipping point analyses) were 
consistent with those of the primary efficacy analysis. The sensitivity analysis using return-to-baseline 
supported the primary analysis results with a LS mean difference in HbA1c change from baseline to 
Week 26 between SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid of -0.07% (95% CI: -0.178 to 0.036). In the 
tipping point analysis, non-inferiority of SAR341402 versus NovoLog/NovoRapid was not demonstrated 
only in extreme scenarios. 
Per-protocol analyses further support the results of the primary efficacy analysis on the ITT population.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Secondary endpoints included the percentage of HbA1c responders (HbA1c <7.0%) as well as change 
from baseline to Week 26 in FPG, mean 24-hour plasma glucose concentration, glucose excursions and 
7-point SMPG profiles (Table 40 and Figure 14). The results of these secondary endpoint analyses do 
not suggest any clinically relevant differences between SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid.

Insulin doses 
Daily basal and mealtime insulin doses (U/kg) at baseline and week 26 in the SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid groups are presented in Table 41. Basal insulin doses remained almost unchanged 
during the main 6-month treatment period in the 2 treatment groups. Changes in mealtime insulin 
doses from baseline to Week 26 was -0.011 U/kg in the SAR341402 group and 0.011 U/kg in the 
NovoLog/NovoRapid group.

Treatment effect by anti-insulin aspart antibody 
The analyses of immunogenicity data were descriptive (no formal statistical testing) and based on the 
AIA population. Separate analyses were performed for patients with T1DM and T2DM.  
The change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 was similar between treatment groups in both 
subgroups of patients, those with treatment-emergent AIA and those without treatment-emergent 
AIAs (Table 42). Additionally, changes in mean mealtime and total insulin doses were independent of 
AIA incidence, in patients with T1DM or T2DM.

Potential impact of the usage of defective test strips on the insulin doses 
During the conduct of the phase 3 study, the majority of the patients (70.9%; 197/197 (100%) of the 
patients in Europe, 226/335 (67%) in the US and 0% in Japan) have been exposed to defective 
glucose test strips. The average blood glucose reading with the defective strips was between 0.1% and 
14.8% higher than the average values obtained with non-defective test strips. Considering that none 
of the patients in Japan has been exposed to defective test strips (although the number of patients 
recruited in Japan is relatively low), while this was 100% in Europe and 67% in the US, the impact of 
defective test strips on the parameters of interest could be evaluated by region. 
Exploratory analyses by geographical regions (US, Europe, Japan) with respect to change in HbA1c 
(primary endpoint) (Table 43) and other secondary endpoints showed no clinically relevant differences 
in treatment effect across regions.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main focus of this application is the demonstration of biosimilarity of SAR341402 to the reference 
products. In this respect the euglycemic PK/PD clamp study PDY12695 is considered pivotal to 
demonstrate comparable efficacy. According to the guideline on non-clinical and clinical development of 
similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev.1), there is no anticipated need for specific efficacy studies since 
endpoints used in such studies, usually HbA1c, are not considered sensitive enough to detect 
potentially clinically relevant differences between insulins. Therefore, the phase 3 study EFC15081 can 
be considered as supportive for efficacy. Nevertheless, this clinical efficacy and safety study provides 
the pivotal immunogenicity and safety data, which is required to complete the biosimilar clinical 
comparability of SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid.

Study EFC15081 was a 26-week, multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel-group 
open-label study with a 26-week comparative safety extension period. 
General inclusion and exclusion criteria are appropriate to identify an eligible target population for 
evaluation of comparability of SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid. The study included adult patients 
who had been diagnosed with T1DM or T2DM for at least 1 year at the time of the screening visit, who 
had been on a multiple daily injection regimen of NovoLog/NovoRapid or insulin lispro (100 U/mL) for 
at least 6 months before screening in combination with insulin glargine for at least 6 months or in 
combination with insulin detemir for at least 12 months before the screening visit and who had a 
screening HbA1c between 7.0% and 10.0%. Inclusion of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients is 
acceptable since the type of diabetes was a randomization stratum. 
The design of the study appears appropriate to answer the objective of the study. A 26-weeks 
treatment duration is considered sufficient for achieving steady-state conditions with SAR341402 or 
NovoLog/NovoRapid in combination with basal insulin (Lantus). The 26-weeks open-label comparative 
efficacy and safety treatment duration period followed by a 26 weeks comparative safety extension 
period is appropriate for evaluation of differences in immunogenicity. The results of this safety 
extension period have been submitted by the Applicant with their responses to the D120 List of 
Questions. Randomization was stratified by geographical region (Europe, US, Japan), type of diabetes 
mellitus (T1DM, T2DM [T2DM only for US]), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value at screening (<8.0%, 
≥8.0%), and prior use of NovoLog/NovoRapid (Yes, No). The open-label study design is acceptable 
since the pre-filled, disposable pen injection devices for SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid cannot be 
made indistinguishable. Moreover, HbA1c (primary endpoint), FDG and anti-insulin aspart antibody 
(AIA) data were measured at central certified laboratories blinded to the treatment received. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of SAR341402 solution compared to 
NovoLog/NovoRapid in terms of HbA1c change from baseline to Week 26, which is accepted since it is 
in line with the draft guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or 
prevention of diabetes mellitus (29 January 2018 CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev.1). A non-inferiority margin 
of 0.3% HbA1c was defined, which is appropriate since it is in accordance with the recommendations 
by regulatory agencies and based on historical precedent for comparative insulin studies. 
Secondary endpoints included the percentage of HbA1c responders (HbA1c <7.0%) as well as change 
from baseline to Week 26 in FPG, mean 24-hour plasma glucose concentration, glucose excursions and 
7-point SMPG profiles are appropriate and provide further insight on similarity of SAR341402 to 
NovoLog/NovoRapid.  
The statistical analysis of primary and secondary endpoints use ANCOVA or logistic regression with 
treatment groups, randomisation strata and baseline values included in the model. Missing data were 
handled taking into account the treatment status of patients (adhering or not). Sensitivity analyses 
were defined to support the primary analysis. The methods are considered standard and acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Discontinuation rates of the 26-week efficacy and safety treatment period were low and similar in both 
treatment arms (7.3% (22 patients) and 7.4% (22 patients) in the SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid groups, respectively). The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was 
“other reason” ( 4.3% (13 patients) and 5.4% (16 patients) in the SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid groups, respectively), which was primarily related to a patient decision or consent 
withdrawal, followed by site closure and patients lost to follow-up. The discontinuation rate due to 
adverse event (AE) was low and approximately similar in both treatment arms (1.7% (5 patients) and 
1.0% (3 patients) in the SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid groups, respectively).

The percentage of critical or major deviations were generally comparable between both groups (43.2% 
and 38.5% in the SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid groups, respectively), and also well balanced 
across the treatment groups within the different categories of protocol deviations. Moreover, the 
deviations are expected not to have had an effect on the primary outcome of the study. 
The demographic and diseases characteristics are sufficiently well distributed across the two treatment 
groups. The majority of the patients had T1DM (83.2%), 82.6% of the patients were white and the 
median age was 49.0 years with approximately 17% of the patients who were 65 years or older. 
Patients were enrolled primarily from the US (56%) followed by Europe (33%) and Japan (11%). 
In the primary analysis, non-inferiority in change in HbA1c of SAR341402 over NovoLog/NovoRapid 
was demonstrated as the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference between SAR341402 
and NovoLog/NovoRapid was below the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3% (LS mean difference 
of -0.08% [95%CI: -0.192 to 0.039]). This was additionally substantiated by the demonstration of the 
inverse non-inferiority of NovoLog/NovoRapid over SAR341402. The sensitivity analyses and the per-
protocol analyses further support the results of the primary efficacy analysis on the ITT population.  
Regarding daily insulin dose, basal insulin doses were similar between SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid at baseline and remained approximately unchanged during the 6-month treatment 
period (change from baseline to week 26 [mean]: 0.005 and 0.003 U/kg in the SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid group, respectively). However, there was a small difference in change from 
baseline to week 26 in mealtime insulin doses with a mean decrease of -0.011 U/kg in the SAR341402 
and a mean increase of 0.011 U/kg in the NovoLog/NovoRapid. When T1DM and T2DM were analysed 
separately, at week 12 a slight difference can be seen favouring the test product to the reference 
products regarding the mealtime insulin doses in both for T1DM and T2DM. However it was mostly 
levelling off at week 26. For the basal insulin doses this difference is even less observable with the 
same trend at week 26 as for mealtime insulin doses. The observed changes are likely related to the 
regular insulin dose adjustment process.  
Subgroup analyses regarding the type of diabetes, type of comparator and prior use of 
NovoLog/NovoRapid showed consistent comparable effects in the change in HbA1c between the two 
treatment groups. Furthermore, also no heterogeneity of treatment effect between the two treatment 
groups was observed with respect to other screening and baseline factors (race, ethnicity, age group, 
sex, baseline BMI, baseline eGFR, randomization stratum of screening HbA1c, duration of diabetes, 
region) and baseline and post-baseline AIA status. 
Furthermore, there were no clinically relevant differences observed between SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid for any of the secondary endpoints, including the percentage of HbA1c responders 
(HbA1c <7.0%) as well as change from baseline to Week 26 in FPG, mean 24-hour plasma glucose 
concentration, glucose excursions and 7-point SMPG profiles. 
During the conduct of the phase 3 study, the majority of the patients (70.9%; 197/197 (100%) of the 
patients in Europe, 226/335 (67%) in the US and 0% in Japan) have been exposed for various 
durations between September 2017 and April 2018 to defective glucose test strips to be used for 
collecting SMPG measurements. The average blood glucose reading with the defective strips were 
between 0.1% and 14.8% higher than the average values obtained with non-defective test strips.  
Although the lot reference numbers of the test strips could not be tracked at the patient level, it is 
agreed with the Applicant that it could be  expected that the extent of usage of defective test strips 
was not substantially different between the treatment groups and that the potential impact would be 
similar between groups and would not affect the between-group comparison. Moreover, considering 
that none of the patients in Japan has been exposed to defective test strips (although the number of 
patients recruited in Japan is relatively low), while this was 100% in Europe and 67% in the US, the 
Assessment report

impact of defective test strips on the parameters of interest could be evaluated by region. Exploratory 
analyses by geographical regions (US, Europe, Japan) with respect to change in HbA1c (primary 
endpoint) and other secondary endpoints showed no clinically relevant differences in treatment effect 
across regions. 
Results of the 26-week safety extension period of study EFC15081 
As requested, the Applicant submitted the results of the 26-week safety extension period of study 
EFC15081 during the evaluation procedure. The efficacy of SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid was 
similar after 12 months of treatment in study EFC15081 in adult patients with T1DM or T2DM. The 
decrease in HbA1c from baseline to Week 52 was similar in the SAR341402 group (LS mean change 
from baseline -0.25%; standard error [SE] 0.057) and NovoLog/NovoRapid group (LS mean change 
from baseline -0.26%; SE 0.059; LS mean difference SAR341402 versus NovoLog/NovoRapid 0.01% 
[SE 0.082], 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.146 to 0.173]). Basal, mealtime and total insulin doses 
remained almost unchanged during this treatment period in both treatment groups. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
For the purpose of the clinical biosimilarity exercise for biosimilar insulin products, the evaluation of 
HbA1c is not a sensitive endpoint and therefore efficacy studies evaluating HbA1c are not requested 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev. 1). Nevertheless, the applicant has conducted one efficacy and 
safety (phase III) non-inferiority studies comparing the test and reference products in order to 
investigate how PK/PD features of the biosimilar candidate product translate into clinical parameters 
relevant for the management of patients with T1DM and T2DM. This data is considered supportive in 
establishing biosimilarity. This study demonstrated that SAR341402 is non-inferior to 
NovoLog/NovoRapid in improvement of glycaemic control by Week 26 and therefore provided strong 
supportive evidence about the comparability/ biosimilarity of the two products.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The main focus of this application is to show biosimilarity between SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid in terms of quality, pharmacology, clinical efficacy and clinical safety. In support 
of demonstration of similarity in safety between SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid, the Applicant 
provided safety information from three different sources: 
• 
• 
• 
The phase 1 PK/PD single-dose euglycemic clamp study PDY12695 in 30 patients with T1DM 
The 6-month open-label comparative efficacy and safety phase 3 study EFC15081 in 597 
patients with T1DM or T2DM, with a 6-month safety extension period 
The phase 3 study PDY15083 for the safety assessment of SAR341402 and NovoLog used in 
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in 45 patients with T1DM. 
The primary safety data are derived from study EFC15081. Therefore, this study will be extensively 
discussed below. 
Patient exposure 
In study EFC15081, the median duration of exposure was the same in the 2 treatment groups (183.0 
days for both SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid). The vast majority of patients in the 2 treatment 
groups were exposed to IMP for more than 25 weeks (SAR341402: 277 patients [92.0%]; 
NovoLog/NovoRapid: 272 patients [91.9%]). The cumulative duration of treatment exposure during 
the main 6-month treatment period was similar between the two treatment groups (145.86 patient-

years and 143.03 patient-years in the SAR341402 and in the NovoLog/NovoRapid groups, 
respectively). 
Adverse events 
Overall summary of adverse events 
The percentage of patients with any TEAEs was approximately similar between the two treatment 
groups (51.8% and 49.3% for SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid, respectively) (Table 45). The 
percentage of serious TEAES and patients with TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation 
was slightly higher in the SAR341402 group compared with NovoLog/NovoRapid (8.3% versus 6.1% 
and 1.7% versus 1.0, respectively).

Common adverse events 
Adverse events were mainly mild to moderate in intensity in the 2 treatment groups. The most 
frequently reported adverse events (preferred term (PT)) were nasopharyngitis (8.3 versus 8.4% for 
SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid, respectively), upper respiratory tract infection (5.3% versus 
8.8%) and influenza (5.0% versus 3.0%) and reported by a general similar percentage of patients 
between the two treatment groups (Table 46). All other TEAEs were reported in less than 3% of 
patients regardless of the treatment group. 
The percentage of patients with TEAEs considered related to study drug was slightly higher for 
SAR341402 compared with NovoLog/NovoRapid (4.0% [12 patients] versus 2.4% [7 patients] ) and 
included , hypoglycemic unconsciousness (5 patients in the SAR341402 group and 1 patient in the 
NovoLog/NovoRapid group), accidental overdose (4 patients in the SAR341402 group and 2 patients in 
the NovoLog/NovoRapid group), device use error (3 patients in the SAR341402 group and 1 patient in 
the NovoLog/NovoRapid group), hypoglycemia (2 patients in the SAR341402 group), and injection site 
bruising (3 patients in the NovoLog/NovoRapid group).

Adverse events of specific interest 
Hypoglycemia 
The percentage of patients with any hypoglycemia reported at any time of the day was similar between 
SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid (96.7% versus 96.3%, respectively). However, the hypoglycemia 
event rate per patient-years was slightly higher in the SAR341402 group compared with the 
NovoLog/Rapid group (72.96 versus 69.31).  Both the percentage and event rate per patient-years of 
severe hypoglycemia also seems to be higher in the SAR 341402 group compared with the 
NovoLog/Rapid group (4.0% versus 3.4% and 0.14 and 0.10 rate per patient-year, respectively) 
(Table 47 andTable 48). 
Subgroup analysis by randomization stratum of type of diabetes indicated potential heterogeneity of 
treatment effect in patients with T1DM versus patients with T2DM for the categories ‘any’ 
hypoglycemia (p-value=0.0514) and documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (<3.0 mmol/L [54 
mg/dL]) (p-value=0.0924). No differences in hypoglycemia risk between SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid was identified in the other subgroup with regard to type of comparator, race, 
ethnicity, age group, sex, baseline BMI, baseline eGFR, randomization stratum of screening HbA1c, 
randomization stratum of prior use of NovoLog/NovoRapid, regions, and duration of diabetes.

Potential impact of the usage of defective strips on the hypoglycaemia evaluations 
The cumulative duration of the period when defective test strips were used was approximately 55 
patient-years (SAR341402: 55.18; NovoLog/NovoRapid: 55.71) as compared to close to 90 patient-
years for the period when non-defective test strips were used (SAR341402: 90.74; 
NovoLog/NovoRapid: 87.37) (Table 49). 
Regardless of the treatment group, the event rate per patient-year of exposure of any hypoglycemia 
was numerically higher with the use of defective test strips (79.12 and 74.58 for the SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid group, respectively) compared with the non-defective test strips (68.30 and 65.33  
for the SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid group, respectively). The event rate of severe 
hypoglycemia per patient-year of exposure remained low with the use of defective test strips compared 
with non-defective strips in the SAR341042 group (0.13 versus 0.14).

The percentage of injection site reactions (0.7% and 1.4 % for SAR341042 and NovoLog/NovoRapid, 
respectively) and hypersensitivity reactions (3.7% each) was relatively low. Furthermore, no relevant 
difference between the two treatment groups could be observed.

Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
The incidence of SAE was slightly higher in the SAR341402 group compared with the 
NovoLog/NovoRapid group (8.3% versus 6.1%) (Table 50). The most frequently reported serious TEAE 
at the PT level was hypoglycemia unconsciousness in the 2 treatment groups (SAR341402: 2.0% [6 
patients with a total of 9 events]; NovoLog/NovoRapid: 1.0% [3 patients with a total of 4 events]). 
The incidence in serious TEAEs considered as related to study drug was low, however, also slightly 
higher in the SAR341402 group compared with the NovoLog/NovoRapid group (7 patients [2.3%] 
versus 1 patient [0.3%], respectively). These treatment related SAE included hypoglycemic 
unconsciousness (5 patients [1.7%] versus 1 patient [0.3%] for SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid, 
respectively), hypoglycemia (2 patients [0.7%] versus 0 patients), accidental overdose (3 patients 
[1.0%] versus 1 patient [0.3%]), and device error (2 patients [0.7%] versus 0 patients).

Laboratory findings 
No clinically relevant differences between SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid were identified for any 
of the laboratory parameters (chemistry, haematology) and vital sign parameters during the main 6-
month on-treatment period of study EFC15081. 
Safety in special populations 
Not applicable. 
Immunological events 
Among patients with available anti-insulin aspart antibody (AIA) sample at baseline, similar 
percentages of patients in the 2 treatment groups had detectable AIAs at baseline (SAR341402: 35.3% 
[96/272 patients]; NovoLog/NovoRapid: 36.7% [98/267 patients]) (Table 51). The percentage of 
patients with a treatment-emergent AIA response (i.e. treatment-boosted or treatment-induced AIAs) 
during the main 6-month on-treatment period was slightly lower in the SAR341402 group compared 
with the NovoLog/NovoRapid groups (16.9% versus 20.5%; risk difference -3.5% [95%CI: -8.75%-
1.73]). Similarly, the AIA incidence in patients with treatment-boosted AIA and patients with 
treatment-induced AIA was slightly lower in the SAR341402 group compared with the 
NovoLog/NovoRapid group (4.2% versus 5.1% and 23.0% versus 28.4%, respectively).  
Furthermore, there were no relevant differences in maximal AIA titer between the two treatment 
groups, regardless of the AIA status.  
Among patients positive for AIA, cross-reactivity to human insulin was found in more than 90% of the 
patients at baseline. The percentage of patients with antibodies cross-reacting with human insulin was 
generally similar between both groups and ranged between 87.5% and 96.8% during the main 6-
month on-treatment period.

Effects of AIA on safety parameters 
Hypoglycemia 
The incidence of severe hypoglycemia during the on-treatment period was  approximately similar 
between the treatment groups in patients with treatment-emergent AIA (SAR341402: 2/50 [4.0%] 
patients; and NovoLog/NovoRapid: 4/60 [6.7%] patients) and in patients without treatment-emergent 
AIA (SAR341402: 10/242 [4.1%] patients; and NovoLog/NovoRapid: 6/232 [2.6%] patients). 
Injection site and hypersensitivity reactions 
The incidences in injection site reactions (1 patient in the SAR341402 group) and hypersensitivity 
reactions (3 versus 2 patients in the SAR341402 group and NovoLog/NovoRapid group, respectively) in 
patients with AIA were rare, as such, conclusions can not be made. 
Common TEAEs and SAEs 
The incidence of TEAEs in patients with treatment-emergent AIAs was higher in the SAR341402 group 
than in the NovoLog/NovoRapid group (SAR341402: 56.0% [28/50] patients; NovoLog/NovoRapid: 
45.0% [27/60] patients). However, no single event contributed to this difference and the pattern of 
common TEAEs was comparable between treatment groups. 
Subgroup analyses 
Patients with T1DM showed a higher treatment-emergent AIA response compared with T2DM (17.4% 
versus 23.0% in patients with T1DM and 14.3% vs 8.2% in patients with T2DM for SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid, respectively). Prior use of NovoLog/NovoRapid did not affect the incidence of AIA. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Not applicable. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was low and slightly higher in 
the SAR341402 group compared with the NovoLog/NovoRapid group (1.7% [5 patients] versus 1.0% 
[3 patients]) (see table below).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In support of demonstration of similarity in safety between SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid, the 
Applicant provided safety information from three different sources, i.e. the phase 1 PK/PD singe-dose 
euglycemic clamp study PDY12695, the 6-month open-label comparative efficacy and safety phase 3 
study EFC15081, and the phase 3 safety study PDY15083. The primary safety data are derived from 
study EFC15081, consequently, only this study will be extensively discussed below.  
Patient exposure 
Based on study EFC15081, safety data is available for 277 patients with SAR341402 and 272 patients 
with NovoLog/NovoRapid for > 25 weeks. The duration of exposure and the number of patients is 
considered sufficient for safety evaluation according to the guideline on non-clinical and clinical 
development of similar biological medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin 
analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/2005_Rev.1). During the evaluation, the Applicant provided additional 
safety data, particularly immunogenicity data from the 6-month safety extension period of study 
EFC15081.

Adverse events 
The percentage of patients with any treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was approximately 
similar between the SAR341402 and the NovoLog/NovoRapid groups (51.8% and 49.33%, 
respectively). The most frequently reported adverse events (PT) were nasopharyngitis (8.3 versus 
8.4% for SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid, respectively), upper respiratory tract infection (5.3% 
versus 8.8%) and influenza (5.0% versus 3.0%) and reported by a general similar percentage of 
patients between the two treatment groups. All other TEAEs were reported in less than 3% of patients 
regardless of the treatment group. The percentage of patients with TEAEs considered related to study 
drug was relatively low, however, slightly higher in the SAR341402 compared with the 
NovoLog/NovoRapid group (4.0% [12 patients] versus 2.4% [7 patients]). 
Serious AEs 
The incidence of SAE was slightly higher in the SAR341402 group compared with the 
NovoLog/NovoRapid group (8.3% versus 6.1%). The incidence in serious TEAEs considered as related 
to study drug was low, however, also slightly higher in the SAR341402 group compared with the 
NovoLog/NovoRapid group (7 patients [2.3%] versus 1 patient [0.3%], respectively). This slightly 
higher incidence was due to an imbalance in treatment-related SAEs of hypoglycemic unconsciousness 
(5 patients [1.7%] versus 1 patient [0.3%] for SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid, respectively), 
hypoglycemia (2 patients [0.7%] versus 0 patients), accidental overdose (3 patients [1.0%] versus 1 
patient [0.3%]), and device error (2 patients [0.7%] versus 0 patients). SAEs of accidental overdose 
led to serious hypoglycemic events in 3 patients in the SAR341402 group and 1 patient in the 
NovoLog/NovoRapid group. It was caused by device use error in 2 patients in the SAR341402 group. 
The differences are small and do not suggest any particular risk associated with the IMP or the devices.  
Deaths 
Four deaths have been reported in study EFC15081 (1 and 3 patients in the SAR341402 and the 
NovoLog/NovoRapid group, respectively), of which none were considered as related to study drug. 
AE of special interest 
The percentage of patients with any hypoglycemia reported at any time of the day was similar between 
SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid (96.7% versus 96.3%, respectively). However, the hypoglycemia 
event rate per patient-years was slightly higher in the SAR341402 group compared with the 
NovoLog/Rapid group (72.96 versus 69.31). Additionally, both the percentage and event rate per 
patient-years of severe hypoglycemia seems to be higher in the SAR341402 group compared with the 
NovoLog/Rapid group (4.0% versus 3.4% and 0.14 and 0.10 rate per patient-year, respectively). This 
imbalance could also be observed in other categories of hypoglycemia. However, given the large 
confidence intervals of the relative difference between groups, the CHMP agrees with the applicant that 
the differences are too small to be considered clinically meaningful. No relevant differences were 
observed between treatment groups with regards to treatment-emergent SAEs involving 
hypoglycemia. 
Subgroup analysis by randomization stratum of type of diabetes indicated potential heterogeneity of 
treatment effect in patients with T1DM versus patients with T2DM for the categories ‘any’ 
hypoglycemia (p-value=0.0514) and documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (<3.0 mmol/L [54 
mg/dL]) (p-value=0.0924), which can be explained by the fact that T1DM patients are more sensitive 
in respect to hypoglycaemia. No differences in hypoglycemia risk between SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid was identified in the other subgroup analyses.  
During the conduct of the phase 3 study, the majority of the patients (70.9%) have been exposed to 
defective glucose test strips to be used for collecting SMPG measurements. The average blood glucose 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020  
Page 80/90 
 
 
 
readings with the defective test strips were between 0.1% and 14.8% higher than the average values 
obtained with non-defective test strips. The Applicant has performed exploratory analyses in order to 
evaluate the potential impact of the use of defective strips on hypoglycaemia events. The cumulative 
duration of the period when defective test strips were used was approximately 55 patient-years and 
similar between the two treatment groups (SAR341402: 55.18; NovoLog/NovoRapid: 55.71). Of note, 
the cumulative duration of the use of non-defective test strips was 90.74 and 87.37 for SAR341402 
and NovoLog/NovoRapid, respectively. Regardless of the treatment group, the event rate per patient-
year of exposure of any hypoglycemia was numerically higher with the use of defective test strips 
(79.12 and 74.58 for the SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid group, respectively) compared with the 
non-defective test strips (68.30 and 65.33 for the SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid group, 
respectively), which can be explained by the high average blood glucose readings and consequently 
administration of higher doses of insulin. However, similar as observed in the overall population, the 
event rated was numerically higher in the SAR341402 group compared with the NovoLog/NovoRapid 
group regardless of the use of defective or non-defective strips.  
The event rate of severe hypoglycemia per patient-year of exposure remained low with the use of 
defective test strips (0.13 and 0.18 for SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid) and approximately 
similar compared with the use of non-defective test strips (0.14 and 0.05 for SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid), which is reassuring.  
One could say that the use of defective test strips has made this study more sensitive for 
hypoglycemia events. Therefore, it is reassuring that the event rate of severe hypoglycemia in patients 
who has used defective strips remained relatively low. Based on this it can be concluded that the use 
of defective strips does not seems to have had a large impact on the severe hypoglycemia events.   
Injection site reactions were rare and no relevant differences between SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid were observed. The percentage of hypersensitivity reactions was relatively low 
and similar between the two treatment groups (3.7%).  
Immunogenicity 
In study EFC15081, the percentage of patients with detectable anti-insulin aspart antibodies (AIAs) at 
baseline was similar between the two treatment groups (35.3% and 36.7% in the SAR341402 and the 
NovoLog/NovoRapid groups, respectively). The percentage of patients with a treatment-emergent AIA 
response (i.e. treatment-boosted or treatment-induced AIAs) during the main 6-month on-treatment 
period was slightly lower in the SAR341402 group compared with the NovoLog/NovoRapid groups 
(16.9% versus 20.5%; risk difference -3.5% [95%CI: -8.75%-1.73]). The same pattern of a slightly 
lower AIA incidence in the SAR341402 group compared with the reference product could be observed 
with respect to AIA status at baseline (patients with treatment-boosted AIA: 4.2 % and 5.1% and 
patients with treatment-induced AIA: 23.0% and 28.4% for the SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid 
groups, respectively). Furthermore, no relevant differences in terms of duration of the AIA response 
(transient or persistent) could be observed between the two treatment groups.  
Prior use of NovoLog/NovoRapid did not affect the incidence of AIA since a slightly lower AIA incidence 
in the SAR341402 group could be observed compared with NovoLog/NovoRapid regardless of the AIA 
status at baseline. With respect to immunogenicity by type of diabetes, patients with T1DM showed a 
higher treatment-emergent AIA response compared with T2DM (17.4% versus 23.0% in patients with 
T1DM and 14.3% versus 8.2% in patients with T2DM) which is expected as patients with T1DM are 
more sensitive in respect to immune responses as compared with the T2DM population.  
Overall, the immunogenicity data are reassuring and do not indicate an increased risk for development 
of AIAs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020  
Page 81/90 
 
 
 
Treatment-emergent AIA did not have an effect on the incidence of TEAEs of SAR341402. More 
specifically, treatment-emergent AIA did not seem to affect the incidence of severe hypoglycemia, 
although the number of hypoglycemic events is too low to draw firm conclusions. Similarly, the 
incidence in injection site reactions and hypersensitivity reactions in patients with AIA were rare, as 
such, conclusions cannot be made. 
Laboratory findings and vital signs 
No clinically relevant differences between SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid were identified for any 
of the laboratory parameters (chemistry, haematology) and vital sign parameters during the main 6-
month on-treatment period of study EFC15081. 
Discontinuations due to AEs 
The incidence of TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation in study EFC15081 was low but 
slightly higher in the SAR341402 group compared with the NovoLog/ NovoRapid group. Nevertheless, 
no pattern indicative for a safety signal could be identified, which is reassuring.  
The Applicant stated that one permanent treatment discontinuation in the SAR341402 group was 
caused by hypoglycemia, however, this event has not been included in the overall incidence of TEAEs 
leading to permanent treatment discontinuation (Table “Number (%) of patients with TEAE(s) leading 
to permanent IMP discontinuation by Primary SOC and PT during the on-treatment period of study 
EFC15081- Safety population”). The applicant clarified why one permanent treatment discontinuation 
in the SAR341402 group related to hypoglycemia, was not included in the overall incidence of TEAEs 
leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. This issue is now resolved because it does not result 
in change to the overall safety assessment. 
Results of the 26-week safety extension period of study EFC15081 
As requested, the applicant submitted the results of the 26-week safety extension period of study 
EFC15081 during the evaluation.  
The safety profile of SAR341402 was similar to that of NovoLog/NovoRapid, in terms of incidence and 
rate of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia, and TEAEs including hypersensitivity and 
injection site reactions. No major safety findings or signals were identified during the 12-month study 
period. 
Immunogenicity evaluation as assessed by AIAs and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in patients with 
T1DM and T2DM showed no clinically meaningful difference between SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid. Treatment-emergent AIA had no impact on the efficacy (i.e. HbA1c levels), 
insulin doses, or safety (as assessed by the incidence and rate of hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity and 
injection site reactions and common TEAEs) in either treatment group in patients with T1DM or 
patients with T2DM. Treatment-emergent NAbs had no impact on the efficacy (i.e. HbA1c levels) and 
insulin doses in patients with T1DM or patients with T2DM.  
From the safety database. all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of SAR341402 was similar to that of NovoLog/NovoRapid, in terms of incidence and 
rate of hypoglycemia, including severe hypoglycemia, and TEAEs including hypersensitivity and 
injection site reactions. No major safety findings or signals were identified.  
Assessment report

In a biosimilar application, specifically similarity with respect to immunogenicity is of importance. In 
study EFC15081, no increased immunogenicity of SAR341402 compared with NovoLog/NovoRapid or 
has been identified, supporting biosimilarity.

Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
This application is a centralised procedure made according to Article 10(4), Directive 2001/83/EC, 
biosimilar application. SAR341402, insulin aspart, solution for injection was developed as a biosimilar 
of NovoRapid/Novolog (insulin aspart 100 U/ml), which is marketed by Novo Nordisk A/S and 
authorized in the EU since 1999. The Applicant is seeking approval for the same indication as 
NovoRapid: 
Insulin aspart Sanofi is indicated for the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 1 year and above. 
Demonstration of similarity of SAR341402 to the reference product NovoLog/NovoRapid was based on 
comprehensive physicochemical and functional characterizations, PK/PD profiles, efficacy and safety 
(including immunogenicity) data, as described below.  
Quality 
Insulin aspart is a relatively small and less complex protein molecule enabling thorough and reliable 
comparison of quality attributes covering structure and impurity pattern. The drug product 
formulations of SAR341402 and the reference product NovoRapid are similar but also different in some 
respects. 
The solution for SC injection SAR341402 is presented in cartridges and prefilled pens, which are also 
the common presentations of the reference product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020  
Page 84/90 
 
 
 
A comprehensive analytical comparability study was performed to evaluate the similarity between 
SAR341402 and the reference product NovoRapid.  
The applicant’s strategy to establish similarity of SAR341402 with the reference product is generally 
endorsed. The attributes tested in the biosimilarity study focus in particular on structure and impurity 
pattern and they cover all attributes relevant for the analytical comparison. Justification is provided for 
attributes not included such as process-related impurities and general pharmaceutical aspects which 
are covered by the control of drug product section. 
For several attributes (pH, insulin aspart, m-cresol, phenol and zinc content) compliance to the 
reference product label claim is shown as well as similarity in analytical studies. In analytical studies, 
SAR341402 batches have been tested side by side to EU sourced NovoRapid batches as well as to USA 
sourced Novolog batches. The number of drug product batches chosen for each test is appropriate to 
accommodate the expected variability of the analytical method and where relevant isolation of the API 
was performed and suitability of the isolation process had been investigated. The SAR341402 drug 
product batches are obtained from two variants of the drug substance manufacturing process. These 
processes are on the commercial scale and differ only in minor process changes. Comparability 
between the drug substances batches is sufficiently supported by a comparability exercise comprising 
release and extended characterization.  
The primary/secondary/tertiary structure studies have been applied to two SAR341402 drug product 
batches derived from the two drug substances process, three batches NovoRapid and three batches of 
Novolog.  
The SAR341402 drug product batches included in the analytical studies are considered sufficiently 
representative for the commercial product. Their age at the time of testing is generally lower compared 
to the age of the reference batches of EU sampled and the USA sampled products. The comparative 
stability and degradation studies indicate that only minor effects on quality attributes could have 
occurred upon storage of SAR341402 and reference products.  
Quantitative results for contents of insulin aspart, excipients and related substances/related impurities 
have been presented in clear graphs plotted in age of the sample tested. This graphical presentation 
enables a satisfactory comparison of results. The latter is feasible due to the fact that values of 
different batches are in relatively good agreement with each other and biosimilar and reference 
product appear to be rather stable in time. In addition to presentation of the actual results, the 
applicant applies a statistical evaluation of the data in order to predict sample values at the same age 
(12 months) and subsequently assess similarity of the ‘prediction at 12 months’ in an interval 
approach. This statistical procedure has been applied to each quantitative result. It presents a model 
which may involve some inevitable flaws but, for the present evaluation, these will not challenge the 
conclusions on similarity of individual attributes which can reliably be drawn from the actual results 
and the stability information. 
Non-clinical 
According to the Guideline on the non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal 
products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues, sufficient different biological 
assays have been performed to demonstrate the biosimilarity of Insulin aspart Sanofi for in vitro 
receptor binding, receptor autophosphorylation and metabolic activity assays with the reference 
product NovoRapid. 
Clinical 
Study PDY12695, a cross-over, double-blind, single-dose euglycemic study in patients with type 1 
diabetes mellitus, was conducted to demonstrate that the proposed commercial formulation of 
Assessment report

SAR341402 solution has PK and PD profiles similar to that of NovoLog/NovoRapid. The performance of 
an euglycemic clamp study in T1DM patients to demonstrate similarity is in accordance with the 
Guideline on the non-clinical and clinical development of similar biological medicinal products 
containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogues (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev 1).  
Study EFC15081, a 6-month, multinational, multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, open-
label non-inferiority study with a 6-month comparative safety extension period has been conducted to 
compare the efficacy and safety of SAR341402 with NovoLog/NovoRapid. According to the guideline on 
human insulin and insulin analogues similar biological medicinal products 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/32775/2005_Rev 1), there is no anticipated need for specific efficacy studies since 
endpoints used in such studies; usually HbA1c, are not considered sensitive enough to detect 
potentially clinically relevant differences between insulins. Therefore, efficacy studies are only 
considered as supportive for efficacy. The euglycemic PK/PD clamp study PDY12695 is considered 
pivotal to demonstrate comparable efficacy. With respect to safety, in a biosimilar application the main 
focus lies on the immunogenicity of the new product compared to the reference product. The PK/PD 
euglycemic study does not contribute much to the safety assessment due to the short duration and 
limited number of participants, as such study EFC15081 is considered sufficient to demonstrate 
comparability in terms of safety, particularly immunogenicity.  
An additional study was submitted in the second round, study PDY15287. This cross-over, double-
blind, single-dose euglycemic clamp study was performed in healthy Japanese subjects to compare the 
PK and PD profiles of SAR341402 with NovoRapid. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity  
Quality 
Insulin aspart is a relatively small and less complex protein molecule enabling thorough and reliable 
comparison of structure and impurity pattern. The similarity in primary, secondary, tertiary structure 
as well as higher-order structure between SAR341402, NovoRapid and NovoLog as well as between 
NovoRapid and NovoLog has been clearly established in a panel of orthogonal analytical techniques. 
The study design is considered sufficient to detect any possible difference in the structure of insulin 
aspart. Results of comparative in vitro and in vivo biological activity assays further confirm the 
similarity in structure.  
The comparative RP-HPLC side by side analysis results are very close. The comparative in-use stability 
study demonstrates similarity of biosimilar with the reference product under the in-use conditions. No 
major qualitative or quantitative differences in impurity profiles are observed. As confirmed in sensitive 
LC-MS studies similar impurities are present in SAR341402 and LC-MS. Similar degradation profiles are 
also reported in comparative side-by-side stability studies and thermal, hydrolytic and light stress 
studies.  
Non-clinical 
The Applicant performed comparative receptor binding assays on both human insulin receptors (IR-A 
and IR-B), including on-off kinetics, with the product SAR341402 (four batches) and reference 
compounds (three batches each of NovoLog and NovoRapid). All 90% confidence intervals of the ratios 
of mean normalized binding affinities (IC50) and binding constants (Ka1, Ka2, Kd1 and Kd2) were well 
within the 0.80 – 1.25 acceptance interval. Also for the IGF-1 receptor, these binding constants were 
well within the 0.80 – 0.125 acceptance interval. Therefore, SAR341402, NovoLog and NovoRapid 
could be considered as similar in these in vitro assays.

Four batches of SAR341402 and three batches each of NovoLog and NovoRapid were studied in a side-
by-side biological similarity assessment in a number of in vitro assays. Biological activity was 
measured by autophosphorylation of IR-A, IR-B and IGF-1R, by inhibition of lipolysis in human 
adipocytes, stimulation of glucose uptake in L6 myocytes, gene regulation of G6PC in primary human 
hepatocytes and mitogenic potency by stimulation of radiolabelled thymidine incorporation into DNA of 
MCF-7 cells. All ratios of the mean normalized EC50 and IC50 values with 90% confidence intervals of 
SAR341402 and the reference NovoRapid were well within the 0.80 – 1.25 acceptance interval. 
Therefore it can be concluded that SAR341402 shows a similar metabolic and mitogenic activity as the 
reference product. 
Clinical 
Efficacy 
In the pivotal phase 1 PK/PD study PDY12695 in patients with T1DM, the primary PK parameters 
Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf support biosimilarity between SAR341402 and NovoRapid because the 90% 
CI for the ratio of treatments of these parameters were within the acceptance range of 80-125%. This 
is supported by the results of study PDY15287 in Japanese healthy subjects. 
In study PDY12695, the primary PD parameter GIR-AUC0-12h and key secondary PD parameter GIRmax 
support biosimilarity between SAR341402 and NovoRapid, since the 95% CI for the ratio of treatments 
of these PD parameters were narrow and well within the equivalence margin of 80%-125%. This is 
supported by the results of study PDY15287 in Japanese healthy subjects. 
In the phase 3 study EFC15081, non-inferiority in change in HbA1c of SAR341402 over 
NovoLog/NovoRapid was demonstrated as the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of the difference 
between SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid was below the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.3% 
(LS mean difference of -0.08% [95%CI: -0.192 to 0.039]), thereby providing supportive evidence with 
respect to the biosimilarity of SAR341402 to NovoLog/NovoRapid.  
Additionally, the secondary endpoints of the percentage of HbA1c responders (HbA1c <7.0%), as well 
as change from baseline to Week 26 in FPG, mean 24-hour plasma glucose concentration, glucose 
excursions, and 7-point SMPG profiles support the primary outcome, since there were no clinically 
relevant differences observed between SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid for these endpoints. 
After 12 months of treatment in study EFC15081, the efficacy of SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid 
was similar in adult patients with T1DM or T2DM. Basal, mealtime and total insulin doses remained 
almost unchanged during this treatment period in both treatment groups. 
Safety 
No increased immunogenicity of SAR341402 compared with NovoLog/NovoRapid have been identified. 
The percentage of patients with a treatment-emergent AIA response (i.e. treatment-boosted or 
treatment-induced AIAs) during the main 6-month on-treatment period was slightly lower in the 
SAR341402 group compared with the NovoLog/NovoRapid groups (16.9% versus 20.5%; risk 
difference -3.5% [95%CI: -8.75%-1.73]). The same pattern of a slightly lower AIA incidence in the 
SAR341402 group compared with the reference product could be observed with respect to AIA status 
at baseline (patients with treatment-boosted AIA: 4.2 % and 5.1% and patients with treatment-
induced AIA: 23.0% and 28.4% for the SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid groups, respectively). 
Furthermore, no differences in tolerability have been identified.  
Immunogenicity evaluation as assessed by AIAs and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in patients with 
T1DM and T2DM showed no clinically meaningful difference between SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid during the 26-week safety extension period of study EFC15081. Immunogenicity 
evaluation as assessed by AIAs and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in patients with T1DM and T2DM 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020

showed no clinically meaningful difference between SAR341402 and NovoLog/NovoRapid. Treatment-
emergent AIA had no impact on the efficacy (i.e. HbA1c levels), insulin doses, or safety (as assessed 
by the incidence and rate of hypoglycemia, hypersensitivity and injection site reactions and common 
TEAEs) in either treatment group in patients with T1DM or patients with T2DM. Treatment-emergent 
NAbs had no impact on the efficacy (i.e. HbA1c levels) and insulin doses in patients with T1DM or 
patients with T2DM. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality 
The analytical studies in 3.2R present strong support on the similarity of SAR341402 and Novorapid. 
Concerns were raised whether the differences in formulation between SAR34140 and the reference 
product impact the oligomeric structure of the active substance. These issues were resolved by 
additional data submitted during the evaluation. 
Non-clinical 
There are no uncertainties or limitations about the similarity of SAR341402 with NovoLog and 
Novorapid from a non-clinical point of view. 
Clinical 
Efficacy 
In the pivotal phase 1 PK/PD study PDY12695, unity was not included in the CI for AUClast and AUCinf. 
Further, the secondary parameter GIR-AUC4-12h appears lower for SAR341402 than for NovoRapid with 
the lower confidence limit for the ratio below 0.8, as was also insulin aspart AUC after 4 hours. 
However, considering the minor contribution of AUC4h-last and GIR-AUC4-12h to total AUC and GIR-
AUC respectively, and considering the large variability in AUC after 4 h, the relevance of these 
differences concerning the last part of the study is considered limited. In study PDY15287 in healthy 
Japanese subjects, which was submitted during the evaluation, no significant differences were found 
between SAR341402 and NovoRapid.  
Safety 
According to the safety data obtained from study EFC15081 there seem to be a slightly increased risk 
of hypoglycemia with SAR341402 compared with NovoLog/NovoRapid. In this study, both the 
percentage and event rate per patient-years of hypoglycemia seemed to be higher in the SAR341402 
group compared with the NovoLog/Rapid group. The differences are however too small to be clinically 
meaningful. 
Immunogenicity evaluation as assessed by AIAs and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in patients with 
T1DM and T2DM also showed no clinically meaningful difference between SAR341402 and 
NovoLog/NovoRapid during the 26-week safety extension period of study EFC15081. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Based on the PK/PD euglycemic clamp study, the Applicant has demonstrated PK/PD comparability in 
the relevant PK and PD parameters (Cmax, AUClast AUCinf, GIR-AUC0-12h, Gmax). Demonstration of 
PK/PD similarity by this euglycemic clamp study is considered key for the assessment for similar 
efficacy. For secondary endpoints, a lower partial GIR-AUC4-12 and AUC4-last were observed for 
SAR341402 with the lower confidence limit for the ratio below 0.8. However, considering the minor 
contribution of AUC4h-last and GIR-AUC4-12h to total AUC and GIR-AUC respectively, and considering 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/269410/2020

the large variability in AUC after 4 h, the relevance of these differences concerning the last part of the 
study is considered limited. In study PDY15287 in healthy Japanese subjects, which was submitted in 
the second round, no significant differences were found between SAR341402 and NovoRapid. 
Demonstration of non-inferiority in a change in HbA1c of SAR341402 over NovoLog/NovoRapid in the 
phase 3 study EFC15081 further supports the outcome of the clamp study. With respect to safety, in a 
biosimilar application the main focus lies on the immunogenicity of the new product compared to the 
reference product. No increased risk for development of anti-insulin aspart antibodies of SAR341402 
compared with NovoLog/NovoRapid have been identified, indicating similarity in term of risk 
immunogenicity. No relevant differences were observed between treatment groups with regards to 
treatment-emergent AEs involving hypoglycemia.

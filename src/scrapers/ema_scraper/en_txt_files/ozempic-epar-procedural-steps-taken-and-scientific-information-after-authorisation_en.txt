1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

In a 52-week open-label trial, 1748 subjects with 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 5.1 of the Ozempic SmPC in order 
to include information on the use of semaglutide s.c. 
once weekly vs insulin aspart three times daily, both 
as add-on to metformin and optimised insulin 
inadequately controlled T2D after a 12-week run-in 
period on insulin glargine and metformin were 
randomised to 1:1 to receive either semaglutide 
once-weekly (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) or insulin aspart 
three times daily. The included population had a 
mean diabetes duration of 13.4 years and a mean 
HbA1c of 8.6%, with a target HbA1c of 6.5-7.5%.

glargine U100 treatment in subjects with 
inadequately controlled T2DM; based on the final 
report from study NN9535-4386 (SUSTAIN-11), listed 
as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a 52-week, 
multi-centre, multinational, open-label, active 
controlled, two armed, parallel, randomised trial 
undertaken to investigate the effect on glycaemic 
control, body weight, safety and health-related 
quality of life. The SmPC of Rybelsus (semaglutide 
p.o.) is not impacted. The RMP common for both 
products has also been updated to version 7.1. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
Treatment with semaglutide resulted in reduction in 
HbA1c at week 52 (-1.5% for semaglutide vs. -1.2% 
for insulin aspart). The number of severe 
hypoglycaemic episodes in both treatment arms was 
low (4 episodes with semaglutide vs. 7 episodes with 
insulin aspart). Mean baseline body weight 
decreased with semaglutide (-4.1 kg) and increased 
with insulin aspart (+2.8 kg) and the estimated 
treatment difference was -6.99 kg (95%CI -7.41 to -
6.57) at week 52.

The MAH submitted the final results from the 
to reflect the final results from the SUSTAIN 7 trial 
(NN9535-4216), a 40-week open-label trial 
comparing the safety and efficacy of 0.5 mg of 
Ozempic to 0.75 mg of dulaglutide and 1 mg of 
Ozempic to 1.5 mg of dulaglutide in patients on 
metformin with type-2 diabetes. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
SUSTAIN 7 trial (NN9535-4216), a 40-week open-
label trial conducted in 1,201 patients and 
comparing the safety and efficacy of 0.5 mg of 
Ozempic to 0.75 mg of dulaglutide and of 1 mg of 
Ozempic to 1.5 mg of dulaglutide in patients on 
metformin with type-2 diabetes.  Superiority of 
semaglutide treatment in reducing HbA1c levels 
from baseline to week 40 was demonstrated for 
semaglutide 0.5 mg versus dulaglutide 0.75 mg as 
well as for semaglutide 1.0 mg versus dulaglutide 
1.5 mg. A weight loss of ≥5% and ≥10% was 
achieved for more subjects with Ozempic 0.5 mg 
compared with dulaglutide 0.75 mg and with 
Ozempic 1 mg compared with dulaglutide 1.5 mg. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been updated 
accordingly. 
Sections 4.8 and 5.1 have also been updated to 
reflect an observed increase in heart rate in 
Ozempic 
Page 8/9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ozempic-treated subjects with cardiovascular risk 
factors in the long-term trial, compared to data from 
the phase 3a trials. 
Section 5.1 was also updated to reflect data on the 
comparison against dulaglutide, Gastrointestinal 
disorders were the most frequently observed 
adverse events, occurring in similar proportions of 
patients receiving Ozempic 0.5 mg, Ozempic 1 mg 
or dulaglutide 1.5 mg; although fewer patients had 
gastrointestinal disorders with dulaglutide 0.75 mg.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Reagila (cariprazine) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Reagila. The RMP details important 
risks of Reagila, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Reagila's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Reagila's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Reagila should be used.  
This  summary of the RMP for Reagila should  be read in  the  context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Reagila's 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Reagila is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adult patients. 
It contains cariprazine as the active substance and it is given orally once a day.  
Further information about the evaluation of Reagila's benefits can be found in Reagila’s EPAR, 
including  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/reagila). 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
Important  risks of  Reagila, together with  measures to  minimise  such  risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Reagila's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In  addition  to  these measures, information  about adverse reactions  is  collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Reagila is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.  
 
 
 
 
 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Reagila  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Reagila.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information  refers  to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Safety Concern #1  -  Important identified  risk - Extrapyramidal  symptoms including 
tardive dyskinesia 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Medical literature/Database 
Akathisia:  Patient  risk  factors  for  akathisia  have  not  been 
well  established,  but  increasing  age,  female  sex,  negative 
symptoms,  cognitive  dysfunction,  iron  deficiency,  prior 
akathisia,  concomitant  parkinsonism,  and  mood  disorders 
may entail greater risk. 
The risk of drug-induced parkinsonism has been associated 
with increasing age, female gender, dementia, HIV infection, 
and pre-existing extrapyramidal disease or family history of 
Parkinson’s disease. 
Patient risk factors for dystonia include age, male sex, race, 
previous  dystonic  reactions,  family  history  of  dystonia, 
cocaine 
hypocalcaemia, 
hypoparathyroidism,  hyperthyroidism  and  dehydration. 
Children  and  young  adults  are  highly  vulnerable,  whereas 
drug-induced dystonia is rare over 45 years of age.22

disorders, 
 
 
 
Previous  studies  of  TD  risk  have  suggested  an  association 
with  increasing  age,  female  gender,  psychiatric  diagnosis, 
longer duration of antipsychotic treatment, higher cumulative 
drug  doses,  concomitant  drug  treatments,  higher  ratings  of 
negative  symptoms  and  thought  disorder,  greater  cognitive 
impairments, presence of acute EPS, and diabetes.22

Safety Concern #2 - Important identified risk - Weight gain 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Medical literature/Database 
General risk for weight gain include a calorific diet and low 
physical activity. Risk of antipsychotic induced weight gain 
is associated with lower body weight (low/normal body mass 
index)  at  the  beginning  of  antipsychotic  treatment  and  the 
diagnosis  of  undifferentiated  schizophrenia.24  A  systematic 
appraisal  of  the  literature  concluded  that  young  non-
overweight  women  with  an  acute  psychotic  episode  were 
particularly high risk of antipsychotic-induced weight gain.

Age is the most common cause. Lens proteins denature and 
degrade over time, and this process is accelerated by 
diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. 
Environmental factors, including toxins, radiation, and 
ultraviolet light, have cumulative effects, which are 
worsened by the loss of protective and restorative 
mechanisms due to alterations in gene expression and 
chemical processes within the eye. Risk factors for the 
development of cataract include poor general health, 
smoking, alcoholism, a high-fat diet and comorbidities such 
as diabetes and hypertension which are common in patients 
with schizophrenia

Safety Concern #5 - Important potential risk - Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Medical literature/Database 
Risk  factors  with  a  strong  association  with  later  suicide 
included  being  young,  male,  and  with  a  high  level  of 
education.  Illness-related  risk  factors  were 
important 
predictors, with number of prior suicide attempts, depressive 
symptoms,  active  hallucinations  and  delusions,  and  the 
presence  of  insight  all  having  a  strong  evidential  basis.  A 
family  history  of  suicide,  and  comorbid  substance  misuse 
were also positively associated with later suicide. The only 
consistent protective factor for suicide was delivery of and 
adherence to effective treatment.

1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev 51.8 GBq/mL radiopharmaceutical precursor, solution 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
1 mL solution contains 51.8 GBq lutetium (177Lu) chloride on activity reference time (ART) 
corresponding to maximum 12.6 micrograms of lutetium (177Lu) (as chloride). 
The ART is defined as the end of production. The minimal specific activity is 3000 GBq/mg lutetium 
(177Lu) at the ART. 
Each 5 mL vial contains a volume varying from 0.1 mL to 4 mL corresponding to an activity ranging 
from 5.2 to 207.2 GBq at ART.  
Each 10 mL vial contains a volume varying from 0.1 mL to 8 mL corresponding to an activity ranging 
from 5.2 to 414.4 GBq at ART.  
The activity at the date and time ordered by the customer, indicated as CAL (calibration), is 
determined by the time elapsed from the ART and the half-life of lutetium (177Lu). 
Lutetium (177Lu) has a half-life of 6.7 days. Lutetium (177Lu) non carrier added is produced by neutron 
irradiation of enriched ytterbium (176Yb). Lutetium (177Lu) decays by β-minus emission to stable 
Hafnium (177Hf), with the most abundant β-minus (79.3%) having a maximum energy of 497 keV. 
Also, low gamma energy is emitted, for instance at 113 keV (6.2%) and 208 keV (11%). 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

Established or suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded (see section 4.6).  
For information on contraindications to particular lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products 
prepared by radiolabelling with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev, refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Individual benefit/risk justification  
For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity 
administered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required 
therapeutic effect. 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is not to be administered directly to the patient but must be used for 
the radiolabelling of carrier molecules, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, vitamins or other 
substrates.  
Renal impairment and haematological disorders  
Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation 
exposure is possible. It is recommended to perform individual radiation dosimetry assessments of 
specific organs, which may not be the target organ of therapy.  
Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia  
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have been observed after 
treatment with lutetium (177Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours (see 
section 4.8). This should be taken into account when considering the benefit/risk, especially in patients 
with possible risk factors like prior exposure to chemotherapeutic agents (such as alkylating agents).  
Myelosuppression  
Anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, lymphopenia, and less commonly neutropenia may occur 
during radioligand therapy with lutetium (177Lu). Most events are mild and transient, but in some cases 
patients have required blood and platelet transfusions. In some patients more than one cell line may be 
affected and pancytopenia requiring treatment discontinuation has been described. A blood count 
should be taken at baseline and monitored regularly during treatment, in accordance with clinical 
guidance.

Renal irradiation  
Radiolabelled somatostatin analogues are excreted by the kidney. Radiation nephropathy has been 
reported following peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours using other 
radioisotopes. Renal function should be assessed at baseline and during treatment and renal protection 
should be considered, in accordance with clinical guidance.  
Hepatotoxicity  
Cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported in the post-marketing setting and in the literature in 
patients with liver metastases undergoing treatment with lutetium (177Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide 
therapy for neuroendocrine tumours. Liver function should be monitored regularly during treatment. 
Dose reduction may be necessary in affected patients.  
Hormone release syndromes  
There have been reports of carcinoid crisis and other syndromes associated with release of hormones 
from functional neuroendocrine tumours following lutetium (177Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide 
therapy, which may be related to irradiation of tumour cells. Reported symptoms include flushing and 
diarrhoea associated with hypotension. Observation of patients by overnight hospitalisation should be 
considered in some cases (e.g. patients with poor pharmacologic control of symptoms). In case of 
hormonal crises, treatments may include: intravenous high dose somatostatin analogues, intravenous 
fluids, corticosteroids, and correction of electrolyte disturbances in patients with diarrhoea and/or 
vomiting.  
Tumour lysis syndrome  
Tumour lysis syndrome has been reported following lutetium (177Lu) radioligand therapy. Patients 
with a history of renal insufficiency and high tumour burden may be at greater risk and should be 
treated with increased caution. Renal function as well as electrolyte balance should be assessed at 
baseline and during treatment. 
Extravasation  
There have been reports of extravasation of lutetium (177Lu) labelled ligands in the post-marketing 
setting. In case of extravasation, infusion of the medicinal product should be immediately ceased, and 
the nuclear medicine physician and the radiopharmacist should be promptly informed. Management 
should be in accordance with local protocols.  
Radiation protection  
Point-source approximation shows that the average dose rate experienced 20 hours after administration 
of a dose of 7.3 GBq Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev labelled radiopharmaceutical (residual 
radioactivity 1.5 GBq) by a person at 1 meter distance from the patient’s body centre with an 
abdominal radius of 15 cm is 3.5 μSv/h. Doubling the distance to the patient to 2 meters reduces the 
dose rate by a factor of 4, to 0.9 μSv/h. The same dose in a patient with an abdominal radius of 25 cm 
yields a dose rate at 1 meter of 2.6 μSv/h. The generally accepted threshold for discharge of the treated 
patient from the hospital is 20 μSv/h. In most countries, the exposure limit for hospital staff is set the 
same as for the general public at 1 mSv/year. When taking the 3.5 μSv/h dose rate as an average, this 
would allow hospital staff to work approx. 300 hours/year in close vicinity of patients treated with 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev labeled radiopharmaceuticals without wearing radiation protection. 
Of course, the nuclear medicine staff is expected to wear standard radiation protection.  
Any other person in close vicinity of the treated patient should be informed about possibilities to 
reduce his/her exposure due to radiation emitted from the patient.

Specific warnings  
For information concerning special warnings and special precautions for use of lutetium (177Lu)-
labelled medicinal products refer also to the Summary of Product Characteristics/package leaflet of the 
medicinal product to be radiolabelled.  
Further precautions with respect to relatives, carers and hospital staff are provided in section 6.6. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies of lutetium (177Lu) chloride with other medicinal products have been performed.  
For information concerning interactions associated with the use of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal 
products refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the medicinal product to 
be radiolabelled. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
When an administration of radiopharmaceuticals to a woman of childbearing potential is intended, it is 
important to determine whether or not she is pregnant. Any woman who has missed a period should be 
assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise. If in doubt about her potential pregnancy (if the 
woman has missed a period, if the period is very irregular, etc.), alternative techniques not using 
ionising radiation (if there are any) should be offered to the patient. Before the use of 177Lu -labelled 
medicinal products, pregnancy should be excluded using an adequate/validated test.  
Pregnancy  
The use of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products is contraindicated during established or 
suspected pregnancy or when pregnancy has not been excluded due to the risk of ionizing radiation to 
the foetus (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding  
Before administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother who is breastfeeding, consideration should be 
given to the possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until the mother has ceased 
breastfeeding, and to what is the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind the 
secretion of activity in breast milk. If the administration is considered necessary, breastfeeding should 
be interrupted, and the expressed feeds discarded.  
Fertility  
Effects of lutetium (177Lu) chloride on male and female fertility have not been studied in animals. Low 
exposures could be demonstrated for male and female sexual organs. It cannot be excluded that 177Lu-
labelled medicinal products lead to reproductive toxicity including spermatogenetic damage in male 
testes or genetic damage in male testes or female ovaries.  
Further information concerning the use of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products concerning 
fertility is specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics of the medicinal product to be 
radiolabelled. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Effects on ability to drive and to use machines following treatment by lutetium (177Lu)-labelled 
medicinal products will be specified in the Summary of Product Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the 
medicinal product to be radiolabelled.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Adverse reactions following the administration of a lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal product 
prepared by radiolabelling with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev will be dependent on the specific 
medicinal product being used. Such information will be supplied in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.  
Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of 
hereditary defects. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher 
incidence of cancer and mutations. In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation 
are less than from the disease itself. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Adverse reactions are divided into groups according to the MedDRA convention frequencies: Very 
common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to 
< 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Dry mouth 
Dry mouth has been reported among patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer 
receiving PSMA-targeted lutetium (177Lu)-labelled radioligands and has been transient. 
Alopecia 
Alopecia,  described  as  mild  and  temporary,  has  been  observed  among  patients  receiving 
lutetium (177Lu) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumours. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The presence of free lutetium (177Lu) chloride in the body after an inadvertent administration of 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev will lead to increased bone marrow toxicity and haematopoietic stem 
cell damage. Therefore, in case of an inadvertent administration of Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev, 
the radiotoxicity for the patient must be reduced by immediate (i.e. within 1 hour) administration of 
preparations containing chelators like Ca-DTPA or Ca-EDTA in order to increase the elimination of 
the radionuclide from the body.  
The following preparations must be available in medical institutions, which use 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev for labelling of carrier molecules for therapeutic purposes:  
- 
- 
Ca-DTPA (trisodium calcium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate) or  
Ca-EDTA (calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate)  
These chelating agents help with the elimination of lutetium (177Lu) radiotoxicity by an exchange 
between the calcium ion in the complex and the lutetium (177Lu) ion. Due to the capacity of the 
chelating ligands (DTPA, EDTA) of forming water soluble complexes, the complexes and bound 
lutetium (177Lu) are rapidly eliminated by the kidneys.  
One gram of the chelating agents should be administered by slow intravenous injection over 3 – 
4 minutes or by infusion (1 g in 100 – 250 mL of glucose, or sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) 
solution for injection).  
The chelating efficacy is greatest immediately or within one hour of exposure when the radionuclide is 
circulating in or available to tissue fluids and plasma. However, a post-exposure interval > 1 hour does 
not preclude the administration and effective action of chelator with reduced efficiency. Intravenous 
administration should not be protracted over more than 2 hours.  
In any case, the blood parameters of the patient have to be monitored and the appropriate actions 
immediately taken if there is evidence of radiotoxicity.  
The toxicity of free lutetium (177Lu) due to in-vivo release from the labelled biomolecule in the body 
during therapy could be reduced by post-administration of chelating agents.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V10X  
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The pharmacodynamic properties of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by 
radiolabelling with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev, prior to administration, will be dependent on the 
nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled. Refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics/Package Leaflet of the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled.  
Lutetium (177Lu) emits β-minus particles of moderate maximum energy (0.498 MeV) with a maximum 
tissue penetration of approximately 2 mm. Lutetium (177Lu) also emits low-energy γ-rays which allow 
scintigraphic, biodistribution and dosimetry studies with the same lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal 
products.  
Paediatric population  
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of the studies with 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev in all subsets of the paediatric population on grounds that the specific 
medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for 
paediatric patients. This waiver does however not extend to any therapeutic uses of the medicinal 
product when linked to a carrier molecule (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetic properties of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by 
radiolabelling with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev, prior to administration, will be dependent on the 
nature of the medicinal product to be radiolabelled.  
Distribution after inadvertent intravenous administration of lutetium (177Lu) chloride  
Data from experiments on mice, rats and rabbits indicate that more than half the lutetium (177Lu) 
entering the systemic circulation is deposited in the skeleton with only small amounts going to the 
liver and kidneys. Lutetium (177Lu) has a biological half-life of between 10 and 40 days in the soft 
tissue in mice and rats but has a very long biological half-life in the skeleton. However, these long 
half-life values in skeleton are not of relevance for lutetium (177Lu) chloride n.c.a., since it completely 
decays with a half-life of 6.7 days following administration, preventing any accumulation over time. 
After intravenous injection of lutetium (177Lu) chloride, lutetium (177Lu) is predominantly but slowly 
excreted in the urine. Some faecal elimination is also observed. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The toxicological properties of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products prepared by radiolabelling 
with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev prior to administration, will be dependent on the nature of the 
medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
The toxicity of non-radioactive lutetium chloride has been studied in different mammalian species and 
using different administration routes. The intraperitoneal LD50 in mice was found to be approximately 
315 mg/kg. In cats, no pharmacological effects on respiration and cardiovascular function were 
observed up to a cumulative intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg. A high dose of 10 GBq of lutetium (177Lu) 
chloride contains 2.4 μg lutetium, corresponding to a human dose of 0.034 μg/kg. This dose is 
approximately 7 orders of magnitude lower than the intraperitoneal LD50 in mice and more than 
5 orders of magnitude lower than the NOEL observed in cats. Therefore, lutetium metal-ion toxicity of 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev (177Lu)-labelled medicinal products can be excluded.

6.2 
Incompatibilities 
Radiolabelling of medicinal products, such as monoclonal antibodies, peptides, vitamins or other 
substrates, with lutetium (177Lu) chloride is very sensitive to the presence of trace metal impurities.  
It is important that all glassware, syringe needles etc., used for the preparation of the radiolabelled 
medicinal product are thoroughly cleaned to ensure freedom from such trace metal impurities. Only 
syringe needles (for example, non-metallic) with proven resistance to dilute acid should be used to 
minimise trace metal impurity levels.  
In the absence of compatibility studies, this medicinal product must not be mixed with medicinal 
products other than the medicinal products to be radiolabelled. 
6.3  Shelf life 
Up to 11 days from the date of manufacture. 
From a microbiological point of view, unless the method of withdrawal from the vial or any insertion 
into the vial preclude the risk of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately.  
If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the 
user. 
6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Store in the original package in order to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure.  
Storage of radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulation on radioactive 
materials.  
This medicinal product does not require any special temperature storage conditions. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container  
Clear type I glass 5 mL or 10 mL vial either conical or flat bottom, respectively, with a Teflon coated 
chlorobutyl rubber stopper, closed with an aluminum cap.  
The vials are placed into a lead container for protective shielding and packed into a polystyrene box 
and an outer carton.  
Pack sizes:  
5 mL vial: 1, 2 or 3 vials  
10 mL vial: 1, 2 or 3 vials 
Not all pack sizes may be marketed. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is not intended for direct use in patients. 
General warning  
Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in 
designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the 
regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official organisation.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and 
pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.  
For instructions on extemporary preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 12.  
If at any time in the preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of this container is 
compromised it should not be used.  
Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the 
medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory.  
The surface dose rates and the accumulated dose depend on many factors. Measurements on the 
location and during work are critical and should be practiced for more precise and instructive 
determination of overall radiation dose to the staff. Healthcare personnel are advised to limit the time 
of close contact with patients injected with lutetium (177Lu)-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. The use of 
television monitor systems to monitor the patients is recommended. Given the long half-life of 
lutetium (177Lu), it is specially recommended to avoid internal contamination. For this reason it is 
mandatory to use protective high quality (latex/nitrile) gloves in any direct contact with the 
radiopharmaceutical (vial/syringe) and with the patient. For minimising radiation exposure resulting 
from repeated exposition there is no recommendation except the strict observance of the above ones.  
The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or 
contamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with 
national regulations must therefore be taken.  
Any unused medicinal product or waste material must be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

11.  DOSIMETRY 
The radiation dose received by various organs following intravenous administration of a lutetium 
(177Lu)-labelled medicinal product will be dependent on the specific molecule being radiolabelled.  
Information on radiation dosimetry of each different medicinal product following administration of the 
radiolabelled preparation is available in the Summary of Product Characteristics/Package Leaflet of 
the particular medicinal product to be radiolabelled. 
The dosimetry tables below are presented in order to evaluate the contribution of non-conjugated 
lutetium(177Lu) to the radiation dose following the administration of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled 
medicinal product or resulting from an accidental intravenous injection of 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev. 
Dose calculations (absorbed normalised doses for target organs [mGy/MBq] and effective normalised 
doses [mSv/MBq]) were performed in Olinda/EXM 2 dose calculator using the mean Â value (mean 
between the Â values obtained from each considered animal study) for each source organ after 
administration of 1000 MBq. Organ doses are listed below for an adult male and female model as well 
as for 15-year, 10-year, 5-year, 1-year and newborn male and female models, according to ICRP 89 
(International Commission on Radiological Protection). 
The results show osteogenic cells, liver, kidneys, red marrow and spleen as the significant target 
organs for the biodistribution of lutetium (177Lu) chloride.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS 
Before use, packaging and radioactivity should be checked. Activity may be measured using an 
ionisation chamber.  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lutetium (177Lu) is a beta(-)/gamma emitter. Activity measurements using an ionization chamber are 
very sensitive to geometric factors and therefore should be performed only under geometric conditions 
which have been appropriately validated.  
Usual precautions regarding sterility and radioactivity should be respected.  
Withdrawals should be performed under aseptic conditions. The vials must not be opened before 
disinfecting the stopper, the solution should be withdrawn via the stopper using a single dose syringe 
fitted with suitable protective shielding and a disposable sterile needle or using an authorised 
automated application system.  
If the integrity of this vial is compromised, the medicinal product should not be used.  
The complexing agent and other reagents should be added to the vial with lutetium (177Lu) chloride. 
Free lutetium (177Lu) is taken up and accumulates in the bones. This could potentially result in 
osteosarcomas. It is recommended to add a binding agent such as DTPA prior to intravenous 
administration of lutetium (177Lu)-labelled conjugates in order to form a complex with free lutetium 
(177Lu), if present, leading to a rapid renal clearance of lutetium (177Lu).  
Adequate quality control of the radiochemical purity of ready to use radiopharmaceuticals gained after 
radiolabelling with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev should be assured. Limits for radiochemical 
impurities should be set recognising the radiotoxicological potential of lutetium (177Lu). Free non-
bound lutetium (177Lu) should be consequently minimised.  
Detailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines 
Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.

  Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is and what it is used for 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is a type of product called a radiopharmaceutical precursor. It 
contains the active substance lutetium (177Lu) chloride which gives off beta-minus radiation. 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is not intended to be used on its own. Before use it has to be 
combined with other medicines (so called carrier medicines) that have been specially developed for 
use with lutetium (177Lu) chloride. This process is called radiolabelling. 
These carrier medicines may be substances that have been designed to recognise a particular type of 
cell in the body. The carrier medicine is given to the patient according to the instructions in that 
medicine’s product information. It then carries the radiation to where it is needed in the body, to treat 
disease or to obtain images on a screen that are used to diagnose illness. 
The use of a medicine radiolabelled with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev does involve exposure to 
radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit of 
using Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev outweighs the risk due to radiation. 
For more information, refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev. 
2.  What you need to know before Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is used 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev must not be used 
- 
if you are allergic to lutetium (177Lu) chloride or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6); 
if you are pregnant or believe you may be pregnant. 
- 
For more information, refer to the Package Leaflet of the medicine that is to be radiolabelled with 
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev. 
Warnings and precautions  
Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev is not to be administered directly to patients. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Take special care with the medicine that is radiolabelled with Lutetium (177Lu) chloride Billev: 
- 
if you have renal impairment or bone marrow disease. 
Treatment with lutetium (177Lu) may lead to the following side effects: 
- 
- 
-  
a reduced number of red blood cells (anaemia); 
a reduced number of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), which are important to stop bleeding; 
a reduced number of white blood cells (leukopenia, lymphopenia or neutropenia) which are 
important for protecting the body against infection. 
Most of these events are mild and temporary. A reduced number of all 3 types of blood cells (red 
blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells - pancytopenia) has been described in some patients. 
Treatment has to be stopped in patients with pancytopenia. 
Because lutetium (177Lu) can sometimes affect your blood cells, your doctor will do blood tests before 
you start and at regular intervals during treatment. Talk to your doctor if you experience shortness of 
breath, bruising, nose bleeds, bleeding from your gums, or if you develop a fever. 
When this medicine is used to radiolabel carrier medicines called somatostatin analogues used to treat 
cancers called neuroendocrine tumours, the radiolabelled carrier medicine is excreted by the kidneys. 
Your doctor will therefore take a blood test to measure your kidney function before you start and 
during treatment. 
Treatment with lutetium (177Lu) may affect the way your liver works. Your doctor will take a blood 
test to check your liver function during treatment. 
Lutetium (177Lu)-labelled medicines may be given directly into a vein through a tube known as a 
cannula. There have been reports of leakage of the fluid into the surrounding tissue (extravasation). 
Tell your doctor if you get any swelling or pain in your arm. 
After neuroendocrine tumours are treated with lutetium (177Lu), you may get symptoms associated 
with release of hormones from the tumour cells, known as a carcinoid crisis. Tell your doctor if you 
feel faint or dizzy or have flushing or diarrhoea following your treatment.  
Treatment with lutetium (177Lu) may cause tumour lysis syndrome, a condition resulting from the 
rapid breakdown of tumour cells. This may lead to abnormal blood test results, irregular heartbeat, 
kidney failure or seizures within a week of treatment. Your doctor will carry out blood tests to monitor 
you for this syndrome. Tell your doctor if you have muscle cramping, muscle weakness, confusion, or 
shortness of breath.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Haemophilia B is an X-linked recessive congenital bleeding disorder, caused by mutations in the genes 
encoding coagulation factor IX (FIX), with an incidence of approximately one in every 25,000 male 
births. 
Signs and symptoms of haemophilia B are variable; depending on severity of the factor deficiency and 
the location of the bleeding. Thereby, bleeding is characterised by spontaneous or trauma-induced 
haemorrhage into joints, muscles and soft tissues. Severe haemophilia B is characterised by 
spontaneous or traumatic bleeding episodes into soft tissues and joints, but also life-threatening 
gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding may occur. Recurrent joint bleeding may lead to chronic 
arthropathy and disability.

State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The MAH is submitting an extension of indication to include paediatric patients below 12 years of age 
as follows: 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency). 
Refixia can be used for all age groups. 
Management 
The primary aim of care for patients with haemophilia B is to prevent bleeding which can successfully 
be managed with FIX replacement therapy. Replacement therapy with exogenous FIX provides a 
temporary correction of the coagulation factor deficiency by increasing FIX levels and thereby reducing 
bleeding. 
Haemophilia B can successfully be managed with FIX replacement therapy. Besides of acute treatment 
of bleeding episodes, prophylactic treatment with the deficient clotting factor should be the goal of 
haemophilia therapy to preserve normal musculoskeletal function (World Federation of Haemophilia 
2013). Therapeutic formulations of FIX are available as both plasma-derived FIX (pdFIX) and 
recombinant FIX (rFIX) products for treatment. Half-life of both pdFIX and rFIX is ~18 hours and 
prophylactic treatment is usually required 2 to 3 times a week in order to achieve a significant 
reduction of bleeding episodes. Several years ago, products with prolonged half-life such as Idelvion 
and Alprolix were approved. Hemgenix which is a gene therapy product has been authorised in 2023 
for the treatment of severe and moderately severe Haemophilia B (congenital Factor IX deficiency) in 
adult patients without a history of Factor IX inhibitors. 
Development of neutralising anti-FIX antibodies (inhibitors) is a serious complication of FIX 
replacement therapy. Approximately 1-3% of all patients with haemophilia B develop inhibitors 
following exposure to FIX. Among patients with severe haemophilia B, the percentage is however as 
high as 9%. Most inhibitors develop in early childhood and after relatively few FIX exposure days. In 
patients who develop inhibitors to FIX, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical 
response to FIX replacement therapy. The occurrence of FIX inhibitors shows some correlation to 
allergic reactions, and patients with FIX inhibitors are at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with 
subsequent exposure to FIX. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Nonacog beta pegol is a recombinant human coagulation FIX product expressed in a genetically 
engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line. A 40 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety is attached to 
the FIX activation peptide by site-directed glycoPEGylation. PEGylation increases the half-life of the 
protein, and the prolonged circulation time is believed to arise from a reduction in the efficiency of 
various elimination processes such as renal excretion, receptor mediated uptake, and proteolytic 
degradation. 
In the European Union (EU), the initial marketing authorisation for nonacog beta pegol (Refixia) was 
received on 02 June 2017 and indicated for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients aged 12 
years and above with haemophilia B (congenital FIX deficiency).

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
A positive PIP compliance check was issued by the PDCO on 15 November 2019. The development 
programme was conducted in accordance with scientific advice received from CHMP 
(EMEA/H/SA/1297/4/2018/PED/III) and exceeding recommendations made at the time. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP 
The MAH has assured the Rapporteur that all trials are carried out in compliance with GCP 
requirements. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical safety evaluation programme of nonacog beta pegol was originally designed in 
accordance with the guideline for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals provided by the International 
Conference of Harmonisation (ICH), ICH S6 R1, ICH M3 R2 and the European Medicine Agencies (EMA) 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Safety Working Party’s (SWP) 
recommendation to the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) for use of PEGylated drugs in children. The 
original non-clinical program for nonacog beta pegol included primary pharmacodynamics, safety 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicology and other supportive 
studies. Pivotal in vivo safety studies were conducted in the rat for up to 26 weeks duration and in 
Cynomolgus monkeys for up to 4 weeks duration. Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were not 
considered relevant given the nature of the molecule and were not performed. As haemophilia B occur 
almost exclusively in men and very rarely in women, developmental and reproductive toxicity studies 
were not performed. Local tolerance was assessed as part of the repeat dose toxicity studies in the rat 
and Cynomolgus monkey and in a dedicated local tolerance study in rabbits. The route of 
administration in the non-clinical studies was intravenous as this is the intended clinical route of 
administration. All pivotal safety studies were conducted according to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). 
Since the marketing authorisation application (MAA) additional nonclinical studies have been completed 
in relation to questions around PEG and included in response documents or reported in the Product 
Safety Update Report (PSUR). To support the current extension of the indication in patients below 12 
years of age, two juvenile toxicity studies have been conducted, a preliminary feasibility and 
tolerability study, and a main juvenile neurotoxicity study, both in male Sprague Dawley rats. Below is 
a list of the activities completed after the MAA (Table 1).

2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
No new primary, secondary or safety pharmacology studies have been conducted since the MAA. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.2.3.1.  Methods 
An exploratory Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) method was developed during review of the MAA to 
measure PEG in plasma from rats, monkeys and humans. The NMR method measures both free and 
conjugated PEG. PEG was measured retrospectively in plasma samples from two anti-drug-antibody 
(ADA) negative monkeys from the 13-week immunogenicity study, whereas no plasma was available 
from the 26-week toxicity study in rats. Since the MAA, PEG in plasma from children, adolescent and 
Assessment report

adults have been measured and the data reported in PSUR and has been published (Sternebring O, et 
al., 2019). The NMR assay has also been qualified for use in rat plasma for the neurotoxicity study in 
juvenile rats. 
A significant effort was made to establish a method for detection of PEG in the choroid plexus in the 
neurotoxicity study in juvenile rats. A HPLC-MS/MS method was pursued and qualified for analysis of 
low PEG amounts in the small choroid plexus tissue samples.

concentrations 
2.2.3.2.  Absorption 
No new absorption studies have been conducted since MAA. PEG pharmacokinetics (PK) was assessed 
in the juvenile toxicity studies. 
2.2.3.3.  Distribution 
No new distribution studies were performed since MAA. 
In study 216366, the concentrations of radioactivity in liver, kidney and choroid plexus were re-
assessed from four rat distribution studies with four PEGylated products [3H]-N9-GP, [3H]-N8-GP, 
[3H]-N7-GP or [3H]-PEG using an extended number to tissues sections compared to the original 
assessment (up to four versus one). For the kidney and liver, measurements from the reassessed 
dataset were very similar to the original dataset giving confidence in the reproducibility of the 
assessments. For the choroid plexus, the re-assessed data was generally like the original data (<2-fold 
different), however for some time points the data differed more substantially. Overall, the 
reassessment gave a more robust data set for choroid plexus regarding variability in concentrations 
between sampling times compared to the originally produced data set. The data was used to estimate 
elimination half-lives, which was included in plasma-tissue modelling.

2.2.3.4.   Metabolism  
At the time of MAA, HPLC fractionation and analysis by accelerated mass spectrometry of urine and 
faeces from the rat excretion study was still pending. The results supported the conclusion in the MAA 
from mice and rat, that the protein part of nonacog beta pegol is degraded over time leaving 40 kDa 
PEG in circulation. The 40 kDa PEG and smaller size PEGs were found to be excreted in urine and 
faeces. 
2.2.3.5.  Excretion 
No new excretion studies have been performed since MAA. 
2.2.3.6.  Drug-drug interactions 
No new drug-drug interaction studies have been performed since MAA. 
2.2.3.7.  Other pharmacokinetics 
This extension of the MAA includes two new nonclinical juvenile studies: a preliminary feasibility and 
tolerability study and a main neurotoxicity study, both in juvenile male Sprague Dawley rats. The 
studies were conducted as an addition to the nonclinical programme to support treatment in patients < 
12 years of age. 
In the preliminary tolerance and feasibility study, pharmacokinetics of PEG was characterised in 
plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) following twice weekly i.v. administration of 120-1200 IU/kg 
nonacog beta pegol to male juvenile rats for approximately 8 weeks (from Day 24 to Day 67 of age). 
All groups receiving nonacog beta pegol were systemically exposed to PEG on the days of blood 
sampling, and the plasma PEG concentration increased over time and with increasing dose. The 
concentration in CSF was evaluated at termination and was below lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 
in all samples. 
In the main neurotoxicity study in juvenile rats, pharmacokinetics of PEG was characterised in plasma, 
choroid plexus and CSF following twice weekly i.v. administration of 120- 1200 IU/kg nonacog beta 
pegol to male juvenile rats for 10 weeks (from Day 21 to Day 91 of age) followed by a 13-week 
recovery period. All animals administered nonacog beta pegol were systemically exposed to PEG, with 
plasma AUC increasing in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1). The exposure was in accordance with 
the preliminary tolerance and feasibility study and increased with consecutive doses, and exposure 
declined during the recovery period for all dose levels. Estimated plasma half-life was 42 days. 
Choroid plexus tissue dissection was performed at the termination of animals. The tissue samples were 
analysed for total PEG concentration. Mean choroid plexus PEG exposure increased with increasing 
doses and with consecutive doses. Exposure declined during the recovery period for all dose levels but 
remained detectable (Figure 1). Data did not allow for determination of the half-life as the recovery 
period was too short. 
CSF was sampled at the end of the dosing period and during recovery. As for the preliminary study, 
PEG concentrations were found to be below LLOQ in all samples. 
Evaluation of anti-drug antibodies revealed that the antibody frequency in nonacog beta pegol (N9-GP) 
dosed animals was 1.9% for anti-N9-GP antibodies and 23.6% for anti-PEG antibodies, including the 
control.

2.2.3.7.1.  PEG PK in plasma and tissue, and prediction PEG concentrations 
To support prediction of PEG exposure in plasma and tissues in animals and humans after repeated 
dosing of nonacog beta pegol, a plasma-tissue model was built initially based on the single dose rat 
distribution data and updated with repeat dose data from actual plasma and choroid plexus PEG 
exposure from the rat juvenile toxicity study. A schematic overview of the model is depicted in Figure 
2. 
Plasma is the central compartment from where PEG is distributed to and from tissues. In tissues, the 
rate of input is determined by the plasma concentration (dose and dose frequency), and the rate of 
output is determined by the tissue elimination rate (as determined e.g. in the distribution studies). 
Steady state in tissues is reached when there is equilibrium between the input and the output rates. 
Figure 2. Tissue steady state is reached when there is equilibrium between rate of input 
from plasma and rate of output, i.e., elimination from the tissue

The plasma-tissue model was used to predict PEG exposure ranges following repeated dosing and to 
simulate human steady state plasma and tissue PEG concentrations with a once-weekly 40 IU/kg 
nonacog beta pegol dose and to assess the animal to human exposure ratios (Table 3) and estimated 
time to reach steady state choroid plexus PEG exposures in human. Acknowledging the limitations of 
using modelling data, plasma, and choroid plexus exposures as measured at early time points in the 
juvenile toxicity study where no neurotoxicity has been identified, are covering the observed plasma 
exposures in human and is in the same range as the predicted human choroid plexus exposures 
following once-weekly 40 IU/kg nonacog beta pegol treatment to a 40 kg subject. The actual measured 
plasma PEG concentrations in children, adolescent and adults provide reassurance that PEG steady 
state concentrations will be reached at levels well below the PEG concentration where no toxicities 
were observed in the juvenile neurotoxicity study and in 26-week chronic toxicity study in rat. The 
model predicted PEG to have reached steady state in choroid plexus in humans within approximately 
4.5 years.

2.2.4.  Toxicology 
2.2.4.1.  Introduction  
Generally, nonacog beta pegol was well tolerated after single doses up to 2000 IU/kg in Wistar rats 
and after repeat doses up to 1200 IU/kg every fifth day for 26 weeks in Rowett nude rats and 1300 
IU/kg/week for 4 weeks in Cynomolgus monkey. These dose levels were identified as No-Observed-
Adverse effect levels (NOAEL). 
In Cynomolgus monkeys, mild and transient body tremors were observed at the high dose (3750 
IU/kg/week). An explanation for the tremors was not found, but as tremors were transient and only 
seen at single or two dosing occasions and at a dose level 90-fold the recommended prophylactic 
clinical dose of 40 IU/kg, they were not considered a safety concern for the clinical dose regimen. 
Consistent with the species-foreign nature of human FIX in Cynomolgus monkeys, a dose dependent 
increase in neutralising anti-drug antibodies that cross reacted with endogenous FIX was observed in 
the mid- (1300 IU/kg/week) and high (3750 IU/kg/week) dose group in the pivotal 4 week repeat dose 
toxicity study resulting in acquired haemophilia in a number of animals. In a subsequent 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 13/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
immunogenicity study of 13 weeks duration conducted with a lower dose level (200 IU/kg/week), 
neutralizing anti-drug antibodies cross reacting to endogenous FIX were also found in the majority of 
the animals. This resulted in acquired haemophilia and reduced exposure after 5-6 doses which 
precluded meaningful long term toxicity evaluation in this species. Therefore, the Rowett nude rat was 
introduced to circumvent the immune system in order to be able to assess chronic toxicity of nonacog 
beta pegol. The Rowett nude rat lacks the thymus and does not develop anti-drug-antibodies. 
In both the Rowett nude rat and Cynomolgus monkey, a dose related prolongation of PT was seen. 
Complete reversal to baseline values was evident in samples collected during the treatment free 
period. In vitro experiments confirmed that high concentrations of FIX affect PT times, and the PT time 
increase, seen in the Rowett nude rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, was considered an assay artefact 
caused by the extremely high FIX plasma concentrations reached. The PT time is not likely to be 
affected at physiological concentrations of FIX. 
In addition to the standard histopathological examination, brain tissue was examined by 
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for presence of the PEG part of nonacog beta pegol (Rowett nude 
rats and monkey) and by transmission electron microscopy (Rowett nude rat). PEG was shown by IHC 
to be bio-distributed to blood in the blood vessels of the brain, in connective tissue and cytoplasm of 
epithelial cells of the choroid plexus of the brain in both rat and Cynomolgus monkey. No other brain 
structures showed presence of PEG. PEG presence after nonacog beta pegol treatment was not 
associated with microscopic signs of cellular vacuolation or dysfunction. However, in nonclinical studies 
with PEG alone cellular vacuolation due to accumulation of 40 kDa PEG in certain tissues (choroid 
plexus of brain, macrophages in the interstitium of the choroid plexus, red pulp of the spleen and 
mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes) in monkeys and rats observed at doses 200-500 fold higher 
(rats) or 200 fold higher (Cynomolgus monkey) than the PEG load resulting from the recommended 
clinical dose. Lysosomes with PEG micro-vesicles were observed, in the epithelial cells of the choroid 
plexus in high dose animals from the 26-week Rowett nude rat study when assessed by transmission 
electron microscopy. There were no signs of adverse cytological effects in choroid plexus epithelial cells 
(i.e., the structures of microvilli, tight junctions, mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the 
Golgi complex were normal). Therefore, the distribution of PEG in lysosomes in the choroid plexus was 
not considered adverse. 
Local tolerance was assessed as part of the repeat dose toxicity study in Rowett nude rats and 
monkeys and in a dedicated rabbit local tolerance study. Local reactions were primarily related to the 
injection procedure. Slightly more pronounced local reactions with nonacog beta pegol compared to 
vehicle control were seen in rabbits after intra-arterial administration but not after intravenous 
administration in Rowett nude rats or monkey.  
A study comparing immunogenicity of nonacog beta pegol and the commercially available rFIX 
(BeneFIX) at similar repeated exposure levels was performed in rats, with doses of 25 or 200 IU/kg of 
nonacog beta pegol (weekly) or BeneFIX (daily), respectively. No difference in immunogenicity was 
seen in rats administered either weekly doses of nonacog beta pegol or daily doses BeneFIX for up to 8 
weeks. 
2.2.4.2.  Selection of species 
For the juvenile toxicity studies, the feasibility of using Sprague Dawley rats oppose to the Rowett 
nude rats was assessed and it was concluded that the Sprague Dawley rat was feasible to use for the 
juvenile toxicity studies without major impact of anti-PEG antibodies.

2.2.4.3.  General toxicity studies 
No new general toxicity studies have been performed. 
After the MAA, CSF samples collected in the 26-weeks repeat dose toxicity in Rowett nude rats from 
control and high dose rats after 26 weeks recovery, were analysed retrospectively. PEG was not 
detectable in CSF from treated animals. 
2.2.4.4.  Reproductive toxicity  
No new reproductive toxicity studies have been performed. 
Because of the apparent delay in pubertal onset in the high dose males in the Preliminary Neonatal 
Toxicity study, the male reproductive organs were weighed in nonacog beta pegol dosed animals. 
Reproductive organs of control animals were not weighed, as these had already been terminated due 
to the staggered start of dosing. In the absence of control data, the statistical comparisons 
incorporating reproductive organ weights were made between nonacog beta pegol treated dose-groups 
and no changes of toxicological significance were identified. No treatment-related macroscopic 
abnormalities were observed at scheduled termination (Day 68 of age). 
2.2.4.5.  Juvenile toxicity 
Since the MAA, two juvenile toxicity studies in male Sprague Dawley rats have been conducted, a 
preliminary feasibility and tolerability study (319293) and a main juvenile neurotoxicity study 
(319286). 
The preliminary feasibility and tolerability study in juvenile male Sprague Dawley rats, concluded that 
s.c. administration of nonacog beta pegol in juvenile rats pre-weaning was not tolerated, but i.v. 
administration of nonacog beta pegol post-weaning from Day 24 of age was feasible and tolerable up 
to 1200 IU/kg/BIW. Plasma PEG exposure increased with dose and was not affected by anti-PEG 
antibodies. The low dose of 120 IU/kg/BIW was chosen to be similar to clinical steady state plasma 
exposure of the 40 IU/kg/week prophylaxis dose, the high dose to be 10-fold the clinical plasma 
exposure at prophylaxis and the mid-dose is the geometric mean between low and high dose, to 
improve dose-response relationship assessments. 
The main juvenile neurotoxicity study in male Sprague Dawley rats concluded that i.v. doses nonacog 
beta pegol of 120, 380 and 1200 IU/kg/BIW (80 animals/dose group) did not cause any treatment 
related effects in clinical signs, mortality, growth (body weight and ulna length), food consumption, 
sexual maturation, fertility, neurobehavior, neurocognitive assessment, morphometric measurements, 
or neuropathology. 
Plasma and choroid plexus PEG exposure increased with dose and dose duration (10 weeks), 
decreased but remained detectable in plasma in the high dose group and in all dose groups in choroid 
plexus after a 13-week recovery period. In the choroid plexus exposure had declined 32%, 20% and 
8% at end of recovery in the low, mid and high dose group, respectively. PEG was not detectable 
above LLOQ (50 ng/mL) in CSF. 
PEG was detected by IHC staining present in the extravascular space and in epithelial cells within the 
choroid plexus, in five circumventricular organs (CVOs: the pineal gland, median eminence, subfornical 
organ, vascular organ of lamina terminalis and area postrema), and motor neurons located in the 
brainstem (hypoglossal, ambiguous, oculomotorius, accessory abducens, trigeminus and facial motor 
nuclei). A diffuse stain for PEG was also observed in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). The 
immunohistochemical stains in the CVOs and cranial motor neurons increased dose dependently in the 
Assessment report

treatment period and there was a numerical reduction of PEG stain in all the six organs or brain 
structures that were analysed (choroid plexus, area postrema, pineal gland, hypoglossal and facial 
motor nuclei, and the pituitary-pars distalis) in the recovery period. No functional effects related to the 
PEG staining in the described areas have been observed. 
No histopathological changes of the brain were seen. PEG was detected by IHC staining present in the 
extravascular space and in epithelial cells within the choroid plexus, in three CVOs, and motor neurons 
in a dose-dependent manner. 
Central nervous system (CNS) assessment was evaluated by detailed clinical observations, a functional 
observational battery (FOB), automated motor activity monitoring, auditory startle response with pre-
pulse inhibition and Morris water maze during the dosing and the recovery period and in an extended 
neuropathology investigation conducted at the end of the dosing and recovery period. Organ weights 
and gross pathology was assessed at all timepoints and histopathology on reproductive organs, 
adrenals, and the thyroid gland at end of dosing and recovery. 
Non-adverse test item-related histopathological changes commonly observed in relation to the 
administration of pegylated compounds were observed in the pituitary gland (vacuolated macrophages 
in Rathke’s cleft). There were no associated degenerative or inflammatory changes in the parenchyma 
of the pituitary gland, and the evaluation of additional special stains did not show any evidence of an 
effect of treatment in this organ. 
CSF samples from the study were analysed non-GLP for Transthyretin (TTR) and albumin as indicators 
of protein synthesis and transport in the choroid plexus. There was no effect of treatment on CSF 
albumin or the CSF/plasma albumin ratio. The differences in TTR from controls observed were minor 
and, in the absence of other findings, considered to be without functional consequences on CNS 
development and function. 
Evaluation of anti-drug antibodies revealed that the antibody frequency in nonacog beta pegol dosed 
animals was 1.9% for anti-nonacog beta pegol antibodies and 23.6% for anti-PEG antibodies, including 
the control group. 
The highest dose level investigated in this study, 1200 IU/kg/twice weekly nonacog beta pegol was 
considered the NOAEL. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Nonacog beta pegol is a biological product consisting of a protein (rFIX), coupled to 40 kDa PEG via a 
chemical linker (cytidin-5'-sialic acid-glycyl). The active pharmaceutical ingredient and the chemical 
linker are due to their composition expected to be readily biodegradable. 40 kDa PEG is not expected 
to be readily biodegradable, but it is labelled as non-hazardous according to EU legislation and it has 
no known adverse effects on humans or the environment. The use of nonacog beta pegol for 
haemophilia treatment is unlikely to result in any risk to the environment. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The SmPC section 5.3 was updated in accordance with the new data in juvenile animals in support of 
the extension of indication to all age groups. 
In the initial MAA, data were submitted for repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys where 40 
kDa PEG deposition was observed by IHC staining in the choroid plexus. Due to the lack of data in 
juvenile animals and the fact that the potential clinical implications of these animal findings, especially 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 16/138 
 
 
 
 
on neurological and neurobehavioural development were unknown, approval was only granted for 
patients above 12 years of age. 
At the time of the initial MAA, no treatment related vacuolation has been seen in the non-clinical 
studies with nonacog beta pegol. However, in nonclinical studies with PEG alone, cellular vacuolation 
due to accumulation of 40 kDa PEG in certain tissues (choroid plexus of brain, macrophages in the 
interstitium of the choroid plexus, red pulp of the spleen and mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes) 
in monkeys and rats observed at doses 200-500 fold higher (rats) or 200 fold higher (Cynomolgus 
monkey) than the PEG load resulting from the recommended clinical dose. Although no neurological 
symptoms (e.g., tremor) occurred in the clinical studies, accumulation of PEG with possible long-term 
consequences was regarded to pose a conceivable risk. 
The “guideline on the need for non-clinical testing in juvenile animals of pharmaceuticals for paediatric 
indications” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/169215/2005) outlines potential safety concerns that cannot be 
adequately assessed in the adult population, in standard non-clinical studies, or in clinical trials. 
Assessment of neurotoxicity studies are required if the chemical/pharmacological class of compounds 
or previous studies in humans or animals gives cause for concern for the developing nervous system or 
influences for neuroendocrine system balance.  
Possible neurotoxicity of PEG or pegylated compounds was analysed in literature (Briani et al., 2006; 
Hussain et al., 2019). 
To further elucidate on this issue and to fill the data gap in juvenile animals and children, the MAH 
within this application for extension of indication provided new data with nonacog beta pegol in 
juvenile rats together with clinical data for the targeted population. No new data on PEG alone was 
submitted. 
A preliminary tolerability and feasibility study and a neurotoxicity study, both in juvenile male rats, 
were conducted to investigate PEG kinetics and the potential impact of PEG on CNS development, 
function, and neuropathology, to support the extension of indication to patients below 12 years of age. 
Male rats were used as haemophilia almost exclusively occurs in the male human population. All 
studies used the intravenous (IV) route of administration, which is also the proposed clinical route of 
administration. 
With regards to the choice of the animal model, the MAH reported the following: 
“Consistent with the species-foreign nature of human FIX in Cynomolgus monkeys, a dose dependent 
increase in neutralising anti-drug antibodies that cross reacted with endogenous FIX was observed in 
the pivotal 4 week repeat dose toxicity study resulting in acquired haemophilia in a number of animals. 
Therefore, the Rowett nude rat was introduced to circumvent the immune system in order to be able 
to assess chronic toxicity of nonacog beta pegol. The Rowett nude rat lacks the thymus and does not 
develop anti-drug-antibodies. In both the Rowett nude rat and Cynomolgus monkey, a dose related 
prolongation of PT was seen. 
For the juvenile toxicity studies, the feasibility of using Sprague Dawley rats oppose to the Rowett 
nude rats (The Rowett nude rat lacks the thymus and does not develop anti-drug-antibodies) was 
assessed and it was concluded that the Sprague Dawley rat was feasible to use for the juvenile toxicity 
studies without major impact of anti-PEG antibodies”. 
This is in accordance with the effective guideline stating that “juvenile animal species should be 
appropriate for evaluating toxicity in endpoints relevant for the intended paediatric population. With 
respect to repeat dose toxicity studies, rats and dogs are traditionally the species of first choice.” 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 17/138 
 
 
 
 
The need to have a reference system with historical control data, in order to correctly judge the 
possible toxic effects of the treatment was taken into account in the choice of the SD rats. 
Overall, the MAH’s justification for the selection of species is acceptable. 
The selected doses of 120-1200 IU/kg correspond to the 1-10-fold clinical PEG plasma exposure and 
according to the provided plasma-tissue model are comparable to the predicted clinical choroid plexus 
PEG exposure. 
A juvenile animal neurotoxicity study was conducted to evaluate the potential neurotoxicity of nonacog 
beta pegol after i.v. administration of 120-1200 IU/kg/twice weekly to juvenile male rats from D21 to 
D91, followed by a 13- week recovery period. As expected from previous data, also with other 
pegylated compounds, PEG was determined in the choroid plexus, in five circumventricular organs, 
specifically the area postrema, pineal gland, median eminence, subfornical organ, and the vascular 
organ of lamina terminalis, as well as in the nucleus tractus solitarius. PEG was also detected in the 
cytoplasm of cranial motor neurons located in the brainstem, specifically the hypoglossal, ambiguous, 
oculomotorius, accessory abducens, trigeminus and facial motor nuclei. 
However, alterations on neurobehavioral and neurocognitive development or other neuropathological 
changes were not observed in this conducted repeat-dose juvenile rat toxicity study in any of the 
treated animals. CNS assessment was evaluated by detailed clinical observations, a functional 
observational battery (FOB), automated motor activity monitoring, auditory startle response with pre-
pulse inhibition and Morris water maze during the dosing and the recovery period and in an extended 
neuropathology investigation conducted at the end of the dosing and recovery period. 
In addition to neurological endpoints, the juvenile rats were also examined for their general condition, 
sexual maturation, and growth without any adverse findings reported. Although dedicated studies on 
reproductive toxicity were not performed in animals for nonacog beta pegol, within the juvenile rat 
study, fertility and reproductive organs of male rats was regarded unaffected following 9 weeks of 
treatment. 
I.v. administration of 120, 600 or 1200 IU/kg/twice weekly from Day 24 of age was well tolerated, 
with effects limited to minor, transient bruising at the injection site in all groups (including controls), 
an increase in testes weights and an apparent 4-day delay in attainment of sexual maturation in males 
given 1200 IU/kg/twice weekly, which may be related to treatment. Such as recommended, the 
highest dose achieved some identifiable effects, however these effects were considered as non-
adverse. The highest dose level investigated in this study, 1200 IU/kg/twice weekly nonacog beta 
pegol was considered the NOAEL. 
PEG exposure in treated animals was shown to increase in a dose- and treatment time-dependent 
manner. PEG was below LLOQ in the CSF and IHC stainings confirmed that PEG was not passing the 
blood-brain barrier in nonacog beta pegol treated animals. 
PEG was still detectable in all animals after the 13-week recovery period, however image analyses 
revealed a slight reduction of PEG staining during recovery in all tissues analysed, including choroid 
plexus. In previously conducted distribution and excretion studies in mice and rats, the 40 kDa PEG 
moiety was confirmed to be distributed to various tissues and organs tested and elimination from 
organs was shown to occur mainly via plasma in urine and faeces. 
The data submitted in juvenile animals treated with nonacog beta pegol revealed only slight 
accumulation in macrophages in the pituitary gland, which was considered to represent a normal 
physiological processing of foreign material in that cell type. However, at PEG exposure levels showing 
acceptable safety margins compared to clinical dosing, no other adverse findings were observed that 
would indicate an increased risk of PEG accumulation in juvenile rats. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 18/138 
 
 
 
 
According to the updated tissue-plasma model, the actual measured plasma PEG concentrations in 
children, adolescent and adults provide reassurance that PEG steady state concentrations will be 
reached at levels well below the PEG concentration where no toxicities were observed in the juvenile 
neurotoxicity study and in 26-week chronic toxicity study in rat. Steady state in plasma could also be 
reached by accumulation of PEG in various tissues instead of elimination of the PEG moiety, however 
based on the original and newly provided data altogether this scenario appears rather theoretical and 
nonclinical data did not reveal any adverse toxicities that could be related to such accumulation. 
CSF samples from the study were analysed for transthyretin and albumin as indicators of protein 
synthesis and transport in the choroid plexus. No treatment effect on CSF albumin or the CSF/plasma 
albumin ratio was observed. Reduction in transthyretin levels was observed in control animals at the 
end of dosing and thus deviations to control were attributed to the high variation observed in control 
animals over time, which did not show dose-response in any of the dose groups and were thus not 
regarded treatment-related. In the absence of any other findings in the juvenile toxicity studies, those 
transthyretin alterations can thus be considered to be without functional consequences on neurological 
development and function. 
Vacuole formation in the choroid plexus of animals after PEG exposure was generally considered an 
uncertainty with regards to its unknown clinical impact and, among others, was one of the factors to 
limit the original indication of nonacog beta pegol to patients 12 years of age and above. 
The MAH herewith provided new data on vacuolisation in juvenile rats. In the conducted toxicity study 
accumulation of PEG in the choroid plexus and vacuole formation in various organs was reported. 
Vacuole formation was observed in the choroid plexus epithelial cells across all treatment groups at 
doses 6-60-fold the weekly clinical dose of 40 IU/kg (corresponding to 1-10 times the clinical PEG 
plasma levels and according to the modelling provided are comparable or well above the predicted 
clinical choroid plexus PEG exposure). However, vacuole formation was also observed in the control 
animals at the same incidence and severity. Moreover, these vacuoles did not stain positive for PEG in 
the treatment groups (nor in the control). Vacuole formation in the choroid plexus was only reported in 
a limited number of (treated) animals and in most of these animals, the vacuole formation was 
reported as ‘minimal or slight’ and did not follow dose- or time-dependent manner, thus indicating no 
pattern. Thus, the MAH considered the vacuolation in choroid plexus epithelial cells in rats to be non-
adverse and not related to nonacog beta pegol treatment. 
PEG-positively stained vacuolated macrophages were found in Rathke’s cleft in the pituitary gland in 
animals terminated during the treatment period and in animals after 13 weeks of recovery. The 
accumulation of PEG in vacuoles in macrophages in Rathke’s cleft were considered to represent a 
normal physiological processing of foreign material. 
According to data provided by the MAH based on a plasma-tissue model to predict PEG exposure ratios 
rat/human after once-weekly 40 IU/kg nonacog beta pegol administration to 40 kg subjects, 
(predicted) PEG exposure ratios ranged from at least 5-fold in the choroid plexus up to 9-fold in 
plasma compared to the NOAEL of 1200 IU/kg/BIW of the juvenile toxicity study, thus resulting in 
acceptable exposure safety margins for PEG. The same model predicted PEG to have reached steady 
state in choroid plexus in humans after approximately 4.5 years. 
Although such predictions show limitations and should be used with caution, these non-clinical data 
altogether suggest the risk for adverse effects in children caused by PEG exposure to be minimal. No 
non-clinical neurological or neurocognitive adverse findings were observed in the juvenile rat study up 
to the highest tested dose. However, potential clinical implications were further elucidated (please 
refer to the clinical safety discussion of this assessment report).

EMA/319611/2023

2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Nonacog beta pegol administration to juvenile male rats revealed no adverse effects up to the highest 
tested dose of 1200 IU/kg/BIW (60-fold the weekly clinical dose of 40 IU/kg). 1200 IU/kg/BIW was 
thus considered the NOAEL in this study. 
Juvenile male rats (3 to 13 weeks of age corresponding to 2 to 16 years of age in humans) exposed to 
PEG (from nonacog beta pegol) at acceptable safety margins (up to 10 times the clinical PEG plasma 
levels and according to plasma-tissue modelling comparable or well above the predicted clinical choroid 
plexus PEG exposure) did not show any signs of neurotoxic or adverse neurobehavioral development. 
In the initial MAA, accumulation of PEG after nonacog beta pegol treatment was only observed at low 
levels, however increased in studies using 40 kDA PEG alone. With a half-life of 15-18 days of the PEG 
moiety after nonacog beta pegol treatment, some accumulation by weekly administration of nonacog 
beta pegol in clinical prophylactic dose regimen was thus regarded possible, with the long-term 
consequences of these findings, especially in children, unknown at the time of the original MA. 
The data submitted in juvenile animals treated with nonacog beta pegol revealed only slight 
accumulation in macrophages in the pituitary gland, which was considered to represent a normal 
physiological processing of foreign material in that cell type. However, at PEG exposure levels showing 
acceptable safety margins compared to clinical dosing, no other adverse findings were observed that 
would indicate an increased risk of PEG accumulation in juvenile rats. A dedicated animal model to 
investigate long-term consequences of potential PEG accumulation in (juvenile) animals is still not 
available, however the provided nonclinical data in juvenile rats focussing on neurologic development 
appears reassuring and supports the newly provided clinical data in the target population, which 
obviously constitutes the most important increase in knowledge, compared to the initial MAA. 
As already shown in adult rats and monkey in the initial MAA, no PEG related vacuolation was observed 
in the juvenile rats’ choroid plexus. 
No new data on PEG alone treatment, which was shown to induce cellular vacuolation due to 
accumulation of 40 kDa PEG in certain tissues (including choroid plexus of brain, macrophages in the 
interstitium of the choroid plexus, red pulp of the spleen and mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes) 
in adult monkeys and rats in the initial MAA, were submitted. However, these findings were observed 
at doses 200-500 fold higher than the PEG levels resulting from the recommended clinical dose, 
without any adverse (neurological) effects observed in these animals. Although the human relevance of 
PEG alone treatment at such high supraclinical exposure levels is questionable, it was concluded that 
due to the uncertainties around this issue and missing data in juvenile animals and children, use of 
nonacog beta pegol in the paediatric population at all ages, was not conceivable at that time. 
However, in the course of this application for extension of indication to all ages the MAH submitted 
repeat dose toxicity data in juvenile animals (without any adverse findings) together with promising 
clinical data in the targeted population of children below 12 years of age, with data from both 
disciplines pointing against this theoretical risk of detrimental effects on neuronal development due to 
potential PEG accumulation and/or vacuolisation. The newly provided nonclinical data in juvenile 
animals together with the nonclinical data on nonacog beta pegol submitted in the initial MAA thus 
generally support treatment with nonacog beta pegol in children below 12 years of age from a 
nonclinical perspective. However, the nonclinical studies provided do not allow a definite conclusion to 
be drawn on the risk for children aged less than 2 years since the juvenile studies provided do not 
cover this period (rats treated from 3 to 13 weeks of age corresponding to 2 to 16 years of age in 
humans). Please refer to further discussion on this issue in the clinical section and the Benefit-Risk 
Balance.

The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of nonacog beta pegol.  
Considering the above data, nonacog beta pegol is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Figure 3: Overview of clinical studies and flow of patients in the clinical development 
programme for nonacog beta pegol 
The flow of patients through the trials is illustrated in Figure 3. In the completed trials (marked in 
grey), a total of 130 unique PTPs have been exposed to nonacog beta pegol. The number of patients 
exposed to nonacog beta pegol for the first time in each trial is indicated as number of new patients in 
italics. Several patients in Trials 3639, 3747, 3773 and 3775 participated in more than one trial which 
explains that the sum of patients (N) in the individual trials is higher than the total number of unique 
patients. In trial 3774, 1 patient withdrew during the main phase and 2 patients did not continue to 
the extension phase. In Trial 3895, 50 unique PUPs have been exposed to nonacog beta pegol; 5 
patients withdrew during the main phase, 1 patient did not enter the extension phase and 6 patients 
are yet to complete the main phase. 
In total, 75 children (0-12 years; previously treated patients [PTPs] and untreated paediatric patients 
[PUPs]), 18 adolescents (13-17 years old; PTPs) and 87 adults (18-65 years old; PTPs) have been 
exposed to nonacog beta pegol within the development programme. Since the original filing in 2016, 
two phase 3 trials are ongoing: Trial 3774 in PTPs and Trial 3895 in PUPs; and one phase 1 trial has 
been completed (Trial 4260).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Trial ID: NN7999-3774 
The open-label, single-arm, multinational, non-controlled trial investigated safety, efficacy and 
pharmacokinetics of NNC-0156-0000-0009 (nonacog beta pegol) in prophylaxis and treatment of 
breakthrough bleeds in previously treated children with haemophilia B (12 years of age and younger at 
inclusion). 
Given the long duration of trial 3774 (planned for up to 10 years of patient exposure), the children 
participating in the trial are expected to have passed several age groups. As a result, at the current 
data cut-off (25-Nov-2020) there were 3 patients present in the adult age group and 12 patients 
present in the adolescent age group. It is noted that the FIX trough levels are known to increase with 
patients’ age.

FIX activity 
Single-dose PK profiles and PK parameters were assessed at visit 2 and were presented at the initial 
MAA. For detailed presentation of the results please refer to the EPAR of Refixia. 
Figure 5: Mean single-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of nonacog beta pegol, derived from 
Trials 3747 and 3774 (main phase) 
For the analysis of steady-state FIX trough only pre-dose samples taken at least 5 days and no 
more than 10 days after last dose, as well as measurements taken at least 14 days after last bleeds, 
were included. This was to ensure that the FIX activity levels in the samples were representative of the 
trough FIX activity levels observed between regular prophylaxis treatments. The FIX trough levels at 
steady state remained constant throughout the trial.

The total estimated mean FIX trough level at steady state based on the mixed model analysis was 
0.181 IU/mL [0.160; 0.204]95%CI for all patients and was 0.146 [0.127; 0.167]95%CI in the 0-
6◦year age group, 0.195 [0.172; 0.220]95%CI in the 7-12 year age group and 0.213 [0.185; 
0.247]95%CI in the 13-17 year age group. For the 18-70 year age group, there were only 3 trough 
values included in the analysis therefore model estimates should be interpreted with caution. As 
expected, FIX trough levels at steady state increased with age.

FIX activity 
Mean steady state FIX trough levels assessed in 47 PUPs aged ≤6 years were within the range for mild 
haemophilia (between 0.05 and 0.4 IU/mL) and remained constant throughout the trial with an 
estimated mean of 0.156 IU/mL [0.144; 0.170]95% CI in the prophylaxis treatment period. In the 
main phase of the trial, the trough value in the PUPs was comparable to that of the trough values 
observed in the younger PTP children at the same age group. The mean incremental recovery was 
between 0.012-0.014 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) for all visits, including both the pre-prophylaxis and prophylaxis 
treatment periods. In the prophylaxis treatment period, mean (SD) FIX activity 30 minutes post-dose 
increased slightly from visit 1 (0.563 [0.113] IU/mL) until visit 28 (0.842 [0.180] IU/mL), after which 
it was not measured. This was not necessarily a trend, due to very small change in FIX activity.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The FIX activity used for the pharmacokinetic assessment is known to correlate with clinical efficacy of 
FIX products. Thus, the FIX activity is to be considered pharmacodynamic in nature, as it reflects the 
biologic action of nonacog beta pegol. Hence, no other pharmacodynamics endpoints have been 
assessed.

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic data on Factor IX activity after single exposure in paediatric patients were reported 
during initial MAA of Refixia and can be found in the respective EPAR. In short, plasma FIX activity 
levels and incremental recovery appeared to be lower in children compared to adults and adolescents, 
whereas body weight-adjusted clearance appeared to be higher in children. This observation is 
principally in line with other authorised Factor IX products. It is to be noted that data from study 3774 
in the age group of patients below 2 years are based on data from 3 patients only and conclusions 
should be made cautiously. However, it is noted that included numbers for PUPs in trial 3895 appear 
adequate for this age subgroup (n=41 patients <2 years). The actual dose was determined by the 
volume administered and all pharmacokinetic endpoints for nonacog beta pegol were derived from 
pharmacokinetic profiles using non-compartmental methods, which is supported. 
With the extension data from study 3774 the MAH now provides steady-state Factor IX trough levels 
measured from pre-dose samples up to 450 weeks after treatment initiation. Throughout the reported 
period patients of both age groups show mean Factor IX trough levels within the range of mild 
haemophilia between 0.05 and 0.4 IU/mL (total estimated mean level was 0.146 IU/mL and 0.195 
IU/mL for patients 0-6 years and 7-12 years old, respectively). 
Total estimated mean steady state Factor IX trough levels in PUPs (measured at visits pre-dose with 
the one-stage clotting assay) are comparable to mean levels for PTPs of the same age group (0.156 
IU/mL and 0.146 IU/mL for PUPs and PTPs 0-6 years, respectively). Further in line with results for 
PTPs ≤6 years old, trough levels also remained stable for PUPs throughout the observation period. It is 
acknowledged that mean incremental recovery (IR; at 30 minutes measured with the one-stage 
clotting assay) was principally comparable in PUPs (i.e. 0.012-0.014 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) throughout all 
visits) to mean levels reported for PTPs during the main phase of study 3774 (i.e. 0.015 
(IU/mL)/(IU/kg) for younger children 0-6 years old and 0.016 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) for older children 7-12 
years old). The slightly lower mean IR in PUPs is in line with expected results for younger subjects, as 
the mean age of PUPs was below the mean age of PTPs in the 0-6 years age group of study 3774 (i.e. 
0.3 years in trial 3895 and 3.1 years in trial 3774). Upon request, the MAH provided information on all 
paediatric subjects (PUPs and PTPs) with IR values <0.012 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg). A total of 25 patients 
(Trial 3895, PUPs) and 10 patients (Trial 3774, PTPs) had an IR below 0.012 (IU/mL)/(IU/Kg) at one or 
more visits. Only one paediatric subject (PUP) from 35 subjects (PUPs and PTPs) with IR values <0.012 
(IU/mL)/(IU/kg) had a positive test for anti-drug antibodies. No major differences in terms of efficacy 
were observed in patients with an IR <0.012 (IU/mL)/(IU/Kg) in the data analysed for PUPs and PTPs. 
A single subject (PUP) had an IR value below 0.006 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) at a single visit during prophylaxis 
treatment (2 years old subject with IR 0.0052 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) at exposure day 10). However, 
reported FIX activity 30 minutes post dosing does not give reason of concern (trough value of 0.1280 
(IU/mL), C30min: 0.355 (IU/mL)) and the same subject had only one further IR value below 0.012 
(IU/mL)/(IU/kg) at exposure day 1 (i.e. 0.01 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg)). Importantly, no bleeding episodes 
were reported for this subject up to 1 month before the visit with IR value below 0.006 
(IU/mL)/(IU/kg) and the subject did not have N9-GP binding antibodies or FIX inhibitors. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Prophylactic dosing of 40 IU/kg once a week appears to provide stable steady state trough levels for a 
long-term in paediatric previously treated (≤12 years) and previously untreated patients (≤6 years). 
Thus, the recommended dosing in paediatric patients is supported by PK data on Factor IX activity 
during prophylactic dosing with nonacog beta pegol.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The current application seeks extension of indication for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding 
episodes in children (<12 years of age) with haemophilia B. The cut-off date for data presented in this 
application is 25-Nov-2020. New clinical efficacy data from two phase 3 trials (trial 3774 in PTPs and 
trial 3895 in PUPs) in paediatric patients with haemophilia B in support of a prophylaxis indication in 
children and adults is provided. Both trials assessed once-weekly prophylaxis with 40 IU/kg nonacog 
beta pegol in the treatment of paediatric patients with haemophilia B. Trial 3895 also included an 
optional pre-prophylaxis treatment period (where patients received on-demand treatment of bleeding 
episodes and/or had a slow start-up of prophylaxis with a dose of 40 IU/kg at intervals longer than a 
week) prior to initiating prophylaxis treatment at 24 months of age or 20 Exposure Days (EDs), 
whichever came first. Given the long duration of trial 3774, paediatric patients became adolescents or 
adults at some point during the trial.

Objectives 
Trial 3774 (PTPs) consisted of a main phase (≥52 weeks) and an extension phase of up to 10 years. 
The results from the main phase were submitted with the original file in 2016, while the interim report 
covering the main phase and extension data up to the interim cut-off date (25-Nov-2020) are provided 
in this type II variation application for extension of indication to include paediatric population. 
Trial 3774 was initiated on 16-May-2012. It comprises a ≥52-week main phase and an up to 10-year 
extension phase (consisting of patients who completed the main phase) in younger (0-6 years) and 
older (7-12 years) PTPs. Patients in both phases received a single 40 IU/kg once weekly dose of 
nonacog beta pegol for prophylaxis. Given the long duration of the trial, paediatric patients became 
adolescents or adults at some point during the trial.

(HEMO-SAT), and TNO-AZL preschool quality of life (TAPQOL) 
•  Health economic impact of N9-GP treatment through characterisation of hospitalisations, 
emergency room visits, missed work and/or school days, and mobility aid requirements 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculations have been performed. The sample size is based on the 
requirements in the EMA guideline. Around 40 patients will be screened in order to start approximately 
24 patients on trial product out of which 10 patients in each of the two age groups are expected to 
complete the main phase of the trial. The patients will be stratified into two age groups; 0-6 years and 
7-12 years, both inclusive. A minimum of 10 patients in each age group must complete the main phase 
of the trial. The trial has one treatment arm where all patients receive N9-GP once weekly for 
prophylaxis. In the extension phase, the investigator is allowed to individualise both dose levels and/or 
dosing frequency. Treatment with N9-GP will in addition be administered in case of breakthrough 
bleeding episodes. 
Randomisation 
No randomisation was performed due to the single-arm nature of both submitted paediatric trials 
(NN7999-3774 and NN7999-3895). 
Blinding (masking) 
Blinding does not apply as both submitted paediatric trials (NN7999-3774 and NN7999-3895) were 
open-label trials 
Statistical methods 
Except for the confidence interval for inhibitor rate and for annualised bleeding rate, the evaluation of 
data will be based on descriptive statistics, i.e. summary tables, listings and figures. Multiple bleeding 
locations occurring from the same event (e.g., due to a bicycle accident) or at the same time point will 
be counted as one bleeding episode. In general all summaries and analyses will also be made by age 
subgroup (0-6 and 7-12 years of age). The following analysis sets were defined in the protocol: 
Full analysis set (FAS) included all patients with efficacy data after exposure to nonacog beta pegol. 
The analysis of efficacy and PK data was based on FAS. 
Safety analysis set (SAS) included all patients exposed to nonacog beta pegol. The safety analysis was 
based on the safety analysis set. 
FAS and SAS were identical in the main phase and extension phase of the trial.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 28 patients were screened for this trial and 25 patients were enrolled and exposed to the 
trial product in the main phase (Figure 9), of which 12 patients were in the 0-6 year age group and 13 
patients were in the 7–12 year age group at trial entry. Three (3) of the 28 patients failed screening. 
One (1) patient withdrew consent during the main phase. Of the 24 patients who completed the main 
phase, 22 patients (88%) entered the extension phase (11 patients in each age groups) while 2 
patients did not continue into the extension phase. The two patients fulfilled withdrawal criteria #5 
(i.e. Incapacity or unwillingness to follow trial procedures). Of the 22 patients, 12 patients remained in 
the trial and 10 patients withdrew during the extension phase as of interim cut-off. The reasons for 
withdrawal are presented in Table 5. None of the patients withdrew due to AEs. All withdrawn patients 
contributed with data until the date of withdrawal. The FAS and SAS consisted of 25 patients.

Table 5: Withdrawn patients in the extension phase and reasons for withdrawal 
A total of 10 patients underwent 17 minor surgeries and 1 patient underwent 1 major surgery. 
Given the long duration of the combined main and extension phases with an average treatment period 
of 6.03 years, 10 of the 12 patients enrolled in the 0-6 year age group grew into 7-12 years including 
2 patients who further grew into adolescents (13-17 year age group). Likewise, of the 13 patients 
enrolled in the 7-12 year age group, 10 patients grew into adolescents including 3 patients who further 
grew into adults. Thus, the trial included 12 adolescent patients and 3 adult patients.

Conduct of the study 
Changes in planned analyses 
Additional analysis of the estimated mean steady state FIX trough levels were analysed using a mixed 
model on the log-transformed plasma concentrations with patient as a random effect. The mean 
trough level was presented back-transformed to the natural scale. Plasma concentrations below LLOQ 
were set to half the value of the LLOQ. There was a change in the definition of IR from the protocol as 
the baseline subtracted FIX activity was used for calculation.

Given the rarity of major surgery in this trial, the time period when the patients stopped weekly 
prophylaxis to go to major surgery and to the date and time when patient resumed weekly prophylaxis 
treatment and the bleeding episodes happened during this time period (if any) were included in the 
estimation of the annualised bleeding rate during prophylaxis treatment. 
Given the long duration of the combined main and extension phase, some patients became adolescents 
or even adults at some point during the trial. Further analyses were performed to evaluate the 
exposure, efficacy and safety of once weekly prophylaxis based on patients' actual age groups at the 
time of exposure or event, by age groups of 0-6 years, 7-12 years, 13-17 years and 18-70 years. It 
should be noted that adolescent and adult patients have been exposed to nonacog beta pegol for a 
longer time compared to younger age groups, hence any comparison between the actual age groups 
should be interpreted with caution. 
In addition to the above analysis, the majority of the analyses were performed based on patients' age 
at trial entry to ensure consistency in trial reporting. To analyse the trajectories of neurological 
examinations over time, shift plots were added by examining the proportion of neurological 
examination items which shifted between every two consecutive examinations. For each item, the 
shifts were categorised into one the three following groups: 
•  Shift up (improved): from abnormal to normal findings 
•  Shift down (worsening): from normal to abnormal findings 
•  No change: from abnormal to abnormal; or from normal to normal findings 
To analyse the trajectories of NCA over time, the following outputs of z-scores (against eTHINK) were 
added/adjusted in addition to the pre-specified individual plots: 
•  Summary tables of z-scores/change from prior assessment/change from initial assessment by 
assessment as well in total, which replaced the pre-specified summary table by visit as the 
NCA were performed at very different visits leading to sparse data by visit; 
•  Heat maps of mean value of change in z-scores at each subsequent assessment from initial 
assessment; 
•  Random regression model of z-scores, with exposure day as fixed effect and subject as random 
effect, allowing random intercept and random slope for exposure day for each individual 
subject. Due to limited amount of neurocognitive data at this interim, the random regression 
model was only performed for executive function domain and attention/processing speed 
domain which were collected for all countries. 
The initial and subsequent categorical evaluation (clinical concern) from the External Expert Review 
Panel (EERP) meetings were listed, together with corresponding exposure days (EDs). 
For the preparation of EERP summary report, additional statistical outputs (summary tables and listing 
of Clinical Concern/Contributing Factor; statistical analyses of Clinical Concern by patient 
demographics/z-scores; statistical analyses of Clinical Concern/Contributing factor by SDH/HH 
parameters; heat maps of z-scores; summary table and shift plots of neurological examinations) were 
provided per request by members of EERP. 
No other changes to the planned statistical analyses were performed.

Protocol amendments 
A total of 10 substantial amendments were made to the protocol at the time of cut-off (25 November 
2020) for this interim analysis. All protocol amendments were approved according to local 
requirements prior to implementation. None of the substantial amendments issued after the first visit 
were considered to have any influence on the interpretation of the results of the trial. 
Three (3) patients entered the extension phase before Amendment 4 was implemented. These patients 
were however not individually dosed due to the near execution of the amendment and continued on 
the 40 IU/kg regimen as in the main phase of the trial. Amendment 7 was not submitted to the health 
authorities (please see Table below for details).

Protocol deviations 
Protocol deviations (PDs) were categorised as important or non-important. Important PDs were 
deviations that could significantly impact the completeness, accuracy and/or reliability of the trial data 
or that could significantly affect the subject’s rights, safety or well-being. A total of 306 important PDs 
were reported in this trial of which 1 was country-level, 6 were trial level, 38 were at trial site level and 
261 were patient level PDs. None of the PDs were considered to have an overall impact on the trial 
conduct, subject safety or data interpretation.  
In 2018, Novo Nordisk started following Drug Information Association (DIA) categorisation for 
reporting PDs. In this trial, PDs reported before 01 January 2019 were categorised according to Novo 
Nordisk PD categorisation and PDs reported after 01 January 2019 were categorised according to DIA 
PD categorisation. Hence, the current CTR includes all PDs categorised per these two different 
categorisation methods.

Haemophilia and treatment history 
Of the 25 patients, 20 patients had a FIX level <1.0%, 2 patients had FIX level <0.6%, 2 patients had 
1.0% FIX level and 1 patient had FIX level of 1.2%. The majority of the patients (16 patients; 64.0%) 
did not have a family history of haemophilia B. All patients were previously treated patients with a 
history of at least 50 EDs (mean=346.3 EDs) to other FIX products and no history of inhibitors. Prior to 
the enrolment in the trial, the majority of the patients (22 out of 25 patients; 88.0%) were on 
prophylaxis regimen either with recombinant FIX product (20 patients) or on plasma-derived products 
(2 patients) and were treated for an average of 56.4 months. The median number of treatment-
requiring bleeds within the last 12 months for previous prophylaxis patients was 2.0. Few patients (3 
out of 25 patients; 12.0%) were on on-demand treatment prior to enrolment in the trial with either 
recombinant FIX product (1 patient) or plasma derived products (2 patients). The patients were on on-
demand treatment for an average of 96.7 months. The median number of treatment-requiring bleeds 
within the last 12 months for patients previously on on-demand treatment was 9.0.

Surgeries 
A total of 12 doses were taken in relation to the 17 minor surgeries in 10 patients, and the mean 
dose level was 44.4 IU/kg. One patient underwent a major surgery for arteriovenous fistula and 
received two doses of 41.8 IU/kg, where one dose was taken within 1 hour prior to the surgery and the 
other dose was taken 2 days after the surgery to consolidate the haemostatic effect, in compliance 
with the protocol-defined dose for major surgery (80 IU/kg).

Patient-reported outcomes and health economic impact 
No clear trends in PROs (HAEMO-QOL, TAPQOL, HEMO-SAT) were observed, as the number of 
questionnaires received was insufficient to draw conclusions (0-3 years: 6 questionnaires; 4-7 years: 3 
children and 4 parent questionnaires; 8-12 years: 8 questionnaires each, children and parents). 
Results from the health economic endpoints indicated that none of the patients reported any intensive 
care hospitalisation days, most (83.3%) patients did not miss any days of school during the study due 
to bleeds, and parents of patients missed an average of 0.4 days of work due to bleeds.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
• 
Incidence of inhibitory antibodies against FIX 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Number and frequency of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs) and Medical Events of 
Special Interest (MESI) 
•  Number of breakthrough bleeding episodes during prophylaxis (annualised bleeding rate) 
•  Haemostatic effect by 4-point haemostatic response scale (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate” and 
“poor”) 
• 
Incremental recovery at 30 minutes (IR30min), FIX activity at 30 minutes (C30min) and 
trough level 
•  Amount of drug administered and number of doses needed to treat a bleeding episode 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculations have been performed. The sample size of 40 completers is based on 
EMA guideline. A total of 60 patients were planned to be screened, 50 patients to be enrolled and 40 
patients were expected to complete the trial. 
Randomisation 
No randomisation was performed due to the single-arm nature of both submitted paediatric trials 
(NN7999-3895). 
Assessment report

Blinding (masking) 
Blinding does not apply as both submitted paediatric trials (NN7999-3774 and NN7999-3895) were 
open-label trials 
Statistical methods 
Descriptions and analysis of efficacy will be based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), as defined in ICH E9 
guidelines. The FAS includes all patients exposed to N9-GP. The safety analysis and descriptions will be 
based on the Safety Analysis Set (SAS). The SAS will consist of all patients exposed to N9-GP. 
Safety: The primary endpoint was a safety endpoint defined as incidence of inhibitory antibodies 
against FIX. The rate of inhibitory antibodies was reported and a 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit 
was provided based on an exact calculation for a binomial distribution. For the calculation of the rate 
the numerator included the patients with inhibitors, while the denominator included all patients with a 
minimum of 10 exposure days plus any patient with less than 10 exposure days but with inhibitors. 
Efficacy: The first supportive secondary endpoint was number of bleeding episodes during prophylaxis. 
Annualised bleeding rate was summarised and a 95% two-sided confidence interval was provided 
based on the negative binomial regression model with breakthrough bleeding episodes as the outcome 
variable, and adjusting for exposure time. The haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol was 
summarised and listed according to the four-point scale for haemostatic response (poor, moderate, 
good and excellent). A success rate was calculated based on counting good or excellent as successes 
and poor and moderate as failures, and was based only on reported outcomes. FIX trough level was 
defined as the activity recorded immediately before nonacog beta pegol injection was given and 
reported as IU/mL. IR30min was defined as the rise in FIX activity per IU/kg administered and was 
recorded 30 minutes after the end of nonacog beta pegol injection, and reported as [IU/mL]/[IU/kg]. 
It was calculated as the baseline adjusted FIX activity recorded 30 minutes after ended nonacog beta 
pegol injection and dividing the administered dose (IU/kg body weight (bw)). Amount of nonacog beta 
pegol used for prophylaxis (IU/Kg/month/year) and amount consumed per bleeding episode (number 
of doses and IU/kg bw/bleeding episode) was summarised and listed. 
Results 
Participant flow 
At interim cut-off, 55 patients were screened and 50 of these were dosed with nonacog beta pegol. Of 
the 50 exposed patients, 39 patients (78%) completed the main phase, and 33 patients (66%) 
completed the extension phase. Six (6) patients completed the trial.

Table 20:  Patient disposition 
The FAS and SAS included all 50 patients exposed to nonacog beta pegol. Five (5) patients did not 
initiate dosing before the interim cut-off date (25 November 2020) and, thus, were excluded from the 
FAS and SAS. A total of 32 patients in the age range of 0−1 years started on pre-prophylaxis 
treatment, and 18 patients started directly on prophylaxis treatment. A total of 29 patients switched 
from pre-prophylaxis to prophylaxis treatment. For the 47 patients on prophylaxis regimen period, the 
age range at entry was 0−5 years. A total of 21 patients underwent minor surgeries, and 1 patient

underwent major surgery during the trial. Overall, 7 patients were withdrawn from the trial, of which 5 
withdrawals were due to AEs. Of the patient withdrawn due to AEs, 2 patients were on pre-prophylaxis 
treatment, 2 patients were in the main phase on prophylaxis treatment and 1 patient was withdrawn 
after completing the main phase and before entering the extension phase. Two (2) patients were 
withdrawn by their parents/LAR(s), of whom 1 was withdrawn during main phase after 32 EDs and 1 
was during the extension phase after 60 EDs.

Conduct of the study 
Changes in planned analyses 
According to the trial protocol, the prophylactic effect was to be evaluated and presented for data from 
the main phase, extension phase and combined. However, as the patients stayed on the same 
treatment throughout both the main phase and the extension phase, there was no reason to evaluate 
the main and extension phase separately. Therefore, the evaluation of the prophylactic effect was 
based on data available up until the cut-off date. However, for comparison, estimated ABRs and 
haemostatic effects were presented as combined as well as separate for prophylaxis main phase and 
extension phase.  
Additional analysis of the estimated mean steady state FIX trough levels was made based on a mixed 
model on the log-transformed plasma concentrations with patient as a random effect. The mean 
trough level is presented back-transformed to the natural scale. Plasma concentrations below LLOQ 
were set to half the value of the LLOQ. 
To analyse the trajectories of neurological examinations over time, shift plots were added by 
examining the proportion of neurological examination items which shifted between every two 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 54/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consecutive examinations. For each item, the shifts were categorised into one of the three following 
groups: 
•  Shift up (improved): from abnormal to normal findings 
•  Shift down (worsening): from normal to abnormal findings 
•  No change: from abnormal to abnormal; or from normal to normal findings 
To analyse the trajectories of neurocognitive assessments over time, the following outputs of z-scores 
(against eTHINK) were added/adjusted in addition to the pre-specified individual plots: 
•  Summary tables of z-scores/change from prior assessment/change from initial assessment by 
assessment as well in total, which replaced the pre-specified summary table by visit as the 
neurocognitive assessments were performed at very different visits leading to sparse data by 
visit; 
•  Heat maps of mean value of change in z-scores at each subsequent assessment from initial 
assessment; 
•  Random regression model of z-scores, with exposure day as fixed effect and subject as random 
effect, allowing random intercept and random slope for exposure day for each individual 
subject. Due to limited amount of neurocognitive data at this interim, the random regression 
model was only performed for executive function domain and attention/processing speed 
domain which were collected for all countries. 
The initial and subsequent categorical evaluations (clinical concern and contributing factor) from the 
EERP meetings were listed, together with corresponding exposure days (EDs).  
For the preparation of EERP summary report, additional statistical outputs (summary tables and listing 
of Clinical Concern/Contributing Factor; statistical analyses of Clinical Concern by patient 
demographics/z-scores; statistical analyses of Clinical Concern/Contributing factor by SDH/HH 
parameters; heat maps of z-scores; summary table and shift plots of neurological examinations) were 
provided per request from members of EERP. 
No other changes to the planned statistical analyses were performed. 
Protocol amendments 
There were 6 amendments to the protocol in the main study. In the extension study, there were 2 
further amendments (no. 7 and 8) to the protocol at the time of the cut-off date (25 November 2020). 
All protocol amendments were approved according to local requirements prior to implementation and 
are shown in the table below. None of the amendments issued after the first visit were considered to 
have any influence on the interpretation of the results from the trial.

Table 22: Amendments of the protocol 
Protocol deviations 
PDs were categorised as important or non-important. Important PDs were deviations that could 
significantly impact the completeness, accuracy and/or reliability of the trial data or that could 
significantly affect the subject’s rights, safety or well-being. In total, 267 important PDs were reported 
in this trial, of which 6 were at trial level, 2 were at country level, 32 were at trial site level, and 227 
were patient level PDs. In addition, 10 patient level PDs that occurred before the interim data cut-off 
date (25 November 2020) were closed. None of the PDs were considered to have an overall impact on 
the trial conduct, subject safety or data interpretation. 
In 2018, Novo Nordisk started following Drug Information Association (DIA) categorisation for 
reporting of PDs. In this trial, PDs reported before 01 January 2019 were categorised according to 
Novo Nordisk PD categorisation and PDs reported after 01 January 2019 were categorised according to 
DIA PD categorisation. This iCTR includes all PDs categorised per these two categorisation methods.

Haemophilia history at baseline 
The haemophilia bleed and treatment history of patients are summarised in the table 25 and included 
PUPs, or patients with a history of less than 3 EDs on other FIX products, with no history of inhibitors. 
All 50 patients were males with severe or moderate haemophilia B with numeric FIX levels available 
from the medical history of 22 patients.  
There were 2 patients with high (≥ 2%) FIX levels prior to N9-GP exposure. One (1) patient had 
another commercial FIX product before screening (on the day before the baseline FIX levels were 
measured) and for the other patient mixing of blood samples during screening was suspected. New 
samples were taken to confirm FIX activity and both these patients reported ≤2% FIX levels. These 
patients met the inclusion criteria later and were included in the trial. Overall, 56.0% (N=28) of 
patients had no relatives with recorded haemophilia B. One patient had a relative with history of 
inhibitors (shown in the table below).

Numbers analysed 
Trial patients: Trial 3895 enrolled 55 male PUPs with haemophilia B and FIX activity ≤2%. As of the 
interim cut-off date (25-Nov-2020), 50 patients were exposed to nonacog beta pegol for a total of 
6709 EDs, and the corresponding mean (SD) ED per patient was 134.2 (92.8) EDs. The cumulative 
exposure time in the trial was 142.3 years, and the corresponding mean (range) exposure period per 
patient was 2.85 (0.17−6.11) years. Patients’ median age was 1 year (range: 0-5 years). Of the 50 
patients, 39 completed the main phase (pre-prophylaxis and prophylaxis) and 33 completed the 
extension phase (prophylaxis only). Of the 33 patients who completed the extension phase, 6 patients 
have completed the trial while 27 patients currently remain in the prophylaxis period until end of trial 
(30-Oct-2022). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Annualised bleeding rate (ABR) 
The median ABR for patients on prophylaxis treatment was 0.25 bleeds/patient/year and the total 
mean estimated ABR based on the negative binomial regression model was 0.94 [0.55; 1.61] 
bleeds/patient/year. When focusing on the estimated ABR over time, including patients on prophylaxis 
treatment in the main phase and extension phase, these were 1.02 [0.47; 2.19]95% CI and 0.67 [0.40; 
1.14]95% CI bleeds/patient/year, respectively. A summary of the estimated ABR is presented in the 
Table below.

Supportive study 
NN7999-4260 
A multicentre, multinational, open-label, randomised, 2-sequence, 2-period cross-over trial comparing 
the single-dose PK of nonacog beta pegol and ALPROLIX, given as i.v. bolus injections to patients with 
haemophilia B with a FIX activity ≤2% and without inhibitors, at a dose of 50 IU/kg for both products. 
Treatment 
•  All patients received a single i.v. bolus injection of 50 IU/kg of nonacog beta pegol or 
ALPROLIX in a non-bleeding state 
Number of dosed patients for PK assessment and sampling time points 
•  15 patients (21-65 years) were exposed to a single dose of nonacog beta pegol and ALPROLIX 
during the trial  
• 
PK was assessed at 2 sessions (Visits 2-9 and 10-17) 
•  Sampling time points (over 10 days): Pre-dose, 10min, 30min, 1h, 3h, 6h, 8h, 24h, 48h, 96h, 
144h, 168h, 192h and 240h 
Objectives and endpoints 
• 
The primary objective was to compare the single-dose PK of nonacog beta pegol with 
ALPROLIX in patients with haemophilia B; this was assessed by the primary endpoint, which 
was based on the one-stage clotting assay:  
-  Area under the FIX activity-time curve from 0 to infinity dose-normalised to 50 
IU/kg (AUC0−inf,norm) 
• 
The secondary objective was to compare the safety of nonacog beta pegol and ALPROLIX® in 
patients with haemophilia B. The secondary PK endpoints addressing this objective included: 
-  Maximum FIX activity dose-normalised to 50 IU/kg (Cmax,norm) 
- 
- 
- 
FIX activity 168 hours post dosing (C168h) 
Incremental recovery 30 minutes post dosing (IR30min) 
Terminal half-life (t½) 
-  Clearance (CL) 
Pharmacokinetic assessments 
The bioanalysis of FIX activity was performed by the central laboratory. The FIX activity was measured 
with 2 different bioassays that were developed for nonacog beta pegol and ALPROLIX in human 
plasma: 
• 
• 
FIX one-stage clotting assay 
FIX chromogenic assay 
Normal human plasma (NHP) standard calibrated against the World Health Organisation (WHO) 
international FIX standard was used as an assay calibrator for all the assays. In addition, for the one-
stage clotting assay for nonacog beta pegol, a product-specific standard (PSS) was also used. The FIX 
chromogenic assay for nonacog beta pegol and ALPROLIX and the one-stage clotting assay for 
ALPROLIX were qualified as fit for purpose. The FIX one-stage clotting assays for nonacog beta pegol 
Assessment report

that used NHP and PSS calibration were validated according to bioanalytical guidelines. The activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) reagents and the FIX chromogenic assay kit used for the one-stage 
clotting assay and the chromogenic assay are specified in Table 33. Quality controlled FIX activity 
results were available and reviewed by Novo Nordisk A/S before database lock. A bioanalytical report 
(BAR) report was written for the assays. 
Table 33: FIX activity assays for nonacog beta pegol and ALPROLIX 
FIX one-stage clotting assay 
The FIX one-stage clotting assay measured the FIX activity of nonacog beta pegol and ALPROLIX by 
time to clot formation. This assay is based on the ability of the test sample to correct the aPTT-
dependent clotting time of a plasma sample deficient in FIX but containing all other factors required for 
normal clotting. As FIX was a limiting factor, the clotting time was dependent on the FIX activity in the 
sample. The assay measured the time from initiation of the coagulation process until formation of the 
fibrin clot. The observed time to fibrin clot formation (turbidity measured as optical density) was 
inversely proportional to FIX activity. 
FIX chromogenic assay 
The FIX chromogenic assay is a two-stage activity assay and is based on the colour development by 
FXa cleavage of a chromogenic substrate. The plasma samples were incubated with coagulation factor 
XIa (FXIa), coagulation factor X (FX), coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), thrombin, phospholipids and 
calcium. This resulted in the activation of FIX (present in the plasma samples) to FIXa. The FIXa 
formed an enzymatic complex with thrombin-activated FVIII, phospholipids and calcium, thereby 
activating FX to FXa. The generated FXa then hydrolysed a chromogenic substrate and released p-
nitroaniline, which was quantified by colorimetric detection. Thus, there was a direct relationship 
between the amount of FIXa in the plasma sample and the generated FXa.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted long-term treatment data for two non-controlled, open-label paediatric studies; 
study 3774 followed 25 previously treated patients (PTPs) 0-12 years old (n=12 patients 0-6 years and 
n=13 patients 7-12 years old) and study 3985 followed 50 previously untreated patients (PUPs) 0-6 
years old. The mean treatment period was >6 years for study 3774 and >2.5 years for study 3985. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
NN7999-3774 
Data generated during the main phase of study 3774 (i.e. ≥52 weeks) were assessed during initial 
MAA in 2016. Long-term data generated during the extension phase (i.e. up to around 450 weeks) of 
this study are submitted for this variation. In total 22 subjects entered the extension study (n=11 
patients 0-6 years and n=11 patients 7-12 years old) and 12 of these subjects remained in the study 
until the currently reported data cut. Importantly, all of the withdrawn patients reported data for 
efficacy assessment and thus are part of the FAS (n=25 as per enrolled subjects for the study during 
main phase) and none of the 10 subjects that withdrew from the extension study due to an adverse 
event. Evaluated numbers of subjects are in line with requirements as outlined in the guideline on 
recombinant FIX products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009 rev. 2 Corr. 1; i.e. at least 10 PTPs for 
each age category with >150 ED for subjects 6-12 and >50 ED for subjects 0-6 years). It is also in line 
with the respective guideline that all previously treated patients had a history of at least 50 EDs 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 70/138 
 
 
 
 
 
(mean=346.3 EDs) to other FIX products and were without history of inhibitors. It is noted that several 
of the subjects crossed age groups during the trial as they became older in the course of study 
conduct. Thus, these subjects can be accounted for in different age categories, some became 
adolescent (n=12 became 13-17 years old) and adult (n=3 became ≥18 years old) during the trial. 
During study course n=10 subjects contributed to both paediatric age categories (i.e. 0-6 years and 7-
12 years old). Results are discussed by actual paediatric age groups that subjects belonged to while 
they were exposed and assessed for efficacy (i.e. n=12 younger children of 0-6 years and n=23 older 
children of 7-12 years with a total of n=25 subjects contributing to the dataset of both categories). It 
is noted that all subjects included in trial 3774 had severe (factor IX level <1%) or moderately severe 
(factor IX level ≤2%) haemophilia B. 
A dose of 40 IU/kg was used for on demand treatment (mild and moderate bleeds) as well as for 
prophylactic treatment once weekly. Only major surgeries and severe bleeds were planned to be 
treated with 80 IU/kg. A major protocol amendment was implemented, in order to change the initially 
planned patient tailored dosing to a fixed dose (i.e. 40 IU/kg once weekly) during the extension phase. 
Thus, no dose adjustment was applied between the main phase and extension phase of the study, 
which appears supported by efficacy results previously reported for the main phase (see EPAR). In line 
with study plan, the mean (SD) prophylaxis dose during the study was 43.2 (1.7) IU/kg and 128 
bleeds were treated with a median dose of 43.1 IU/kg/bleed (more details below). In total 8 protocol 
amendments and 306 important protocol deviations are reported until this latest data cut-off. Reported 
protocol amendments appear acceptable with respect to study conduct. The number of important 
protocol deviations appears very high, but deviations during the main study phase (see EPAR) are 
comparable to reported deviations in other Factor IX products in a comparable study duration. It is 
further understood that the very long study duration of the reported extension study does lead to an 
accumulation of deviations over time. Importantly, no patient was excluded from the FAS as it was 
concluded that none of the PDs (1 on country-level, 6 on trial level, 38 on trial site level and 261 on 
patient level) had an overall impact on the trial conduct, subject safety or data interpretation. It is 
further noted that PDs reported before 01 January 2019 were categorised according to Novo Nordisk 
PD categorisation and PDs reported after 01 January 2019 were categorised according to DIA PD 
categorisation. Importantly, the interim study report includes all PDs categorised per these two 
categorisation methods. 
NN7999-3895 
The MAH presents an open-label study to provide clinical evidence for PUPs with haemophilia B that 
were treated with Refixia following a pre-prophylactic (treatment of bleeds and/or reduced 
prophylaxis) and/or prophylactic (prevention of bleeds and treatment of bleeding episodes) regimen. A 
total of 55 previously untreated patients from 0-6 years were screened and 50 of these were dosed 
with nonacog beta pegol. Of the 50 exposed patients, 39 patients completed the main phase, 33 of 
these also completed the extension phase and 31 patients had been exposed to >100 EDs. A total of 
32 patients started on pre-prophylaxis treatment and a total of 47 patients were followed on 
prophylaxis treatment (29 of those switched from pre-prophylaxis to prophylaxis treatment during the 
trial). Overall, 7 patients were withdrawn from the trial of which 5 withdrawals were due to AEs and 2 
withdrawals were due to parent withdrawal of consent. All withdrawn patients contributed with data 
until the date of withdrawal. The FAS and SAS consisted of 50 patients. Several of the subjects crossed 
age groups during the trial as they became older in the course of study conduct. However, all subjects 
remained in the paediatric category of ≤12 years. As per inclusion criteria ≤3 EDs to FIX containing 
products or 5 previous EDs to blood components were allowed for PUPs included in study 3985. In total 
29 PUPs had previous exposure to FIX containing products and/or to blood components before 
enrolment. As per inclusion criteria all exposures to FIX products were limited to ≤3 EDs and all 
exposures to blood components were limited to ≤5 previous EDs. Around half of the subjects (n=15) 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 71/138 
 
 
 
 
had previous exposure within one month prior screening. According to the GL on recombinant Factor 
IX products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009 rev. 2 Corr. 1) the formal clinical investigation in PUPs is 
formally not required for the licensure of paediatric patients. However, the study is endorsed. It is 
noted that all subjects included in trial 3895 had severe (factor IX level <1%) or moderately severe 
(factor IX level ≤2%) haemophilia B. 
A dose of 40 IU/kg was used for on demand treatment (mild and moderate bleeds) as well as for 
prophylactic treatment once weekly. Only severe bleeds and port implants (as part of the minor 
surgery) were planned to be treated with 80 IU/kg. In total 8 protocol amendments and 276 important 
protocol deviation are reported until this latest data cut-off. Reported protocol amendments appear 
acceptable with respect to study conduct. One of the protocol amendments was implemented, in order 
to allow major surgery during the trial, which appears acceptable. The number of important protocol 
deviations appears very high, but deviations are comparable to reported deviations in paediatric PTPs 
and in other Factor IX products. It is further understood that the very long study duration of the 
reported extension study does lead to an accumulation of deviations over time. Importantly, all 50 
patients exposed to nonacog beta pegol were included in the FAS as it was concluded that none of the 
PDs were considered to have an overall impact on the trial conduct, subject safety or data 
interpretation. It is further noted that PDs reported before 01 January 2019 were categorised 
according to Novo Nordisk PD categorisation and PDs reported after 01 January 2019 were categorised 
according to DIA PD categorisation. Importantly, the interim study report includes all PDs categorised 
per these two categorisation methods. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
NN7999-3774 
Efficacy data in paediatric PTPs 
The evaluation of immunogenicity was the primary aim of study 3774. Efficacy, pharmacokinetics and 
further safety measures were evaluated as secondary objectives. The focus on immunogenicity in 
paediatric trials as well as the reported efficacy endpoints (e.g. bleeding rate, haemostatic response 
and Factor IX consumption) are acknowledged and well in line with data provided for other Factor IX 
products. Results presented for study 3774 do not indicate any reduction in efficacy for the long-term 
treatment (main + extension phase) compared to data reported for the main phase, as also assessed 
during initial MAA and presented in the EPAR for Refixia. Also, key efficacy results (details of bleeds, 
annualised bleeding rate, haemostatic response and consumption) presented separately for the main 
and extension phase do not indicate any loss of efficacy during the extension phase compared to 
results from the main phase. 
Presented data from extension phase comprise all data until data cut-off (including those from main 
phase). Efficacy results appear principally in line with other Factor IX products with prolonged half-life 
that are licensed for paediatric subjects. The ABR after long term treatment was slightly reduced 
compared to the main phase for 0-6 years old (Poisson estimated ABR was 0.87 [95%CI: 0.38; 2.01] 
during the main study and 1.02 [95%CI: 0.68; 1.54] after study extension) and 7-12 years old 
(Poisson estimated ABR was 1.88 [95%CI: 1.14; 3.09] during the main study and 0.84 [95%CI: 0.41; 
1.75] after study extension) PTPs. Comparable to the main phase most of the bleeds were traumatic 
bleeds after the extension phase (80% for 0-6 year old and 66.7% for 7-12 year old PTPs). The 
haemostatic success rate was around 90% in paediatric subjects (88.6% for 0-6 year old and 93.7% 
for 7-12 year old PTPs) and treatment failure was reported for 8 bleeds (4 per age group, from a total 
of 98 bleeds). All treatment failures occurred across muscular, mucosal, joint or subcutaneous 
locations, 6 were traumatic and 2 were spontaneous bleeds and all were mild/moderate bleeding 
Assessment report

Page 72/138 
 
 
 
 
events. Poor treatment outcome is noted for two bleeds (both in one patient <6 years), all other 
failures were rated with moderate response. Only 2 bleeds in 2 subjects required >2 injections (3 and 
5 injections, both traumatic bleeds). 
It is highlighted that none of the breakthrough bleeding events in paediatric PTPs was rated as a 
severe bleeding event (all mild or moderate) and none of the patients was treated with other FIX 
products or bypassing agents. Furthermore, no new target joint developed throughout the whole 
observation period and the two pre-existing target joints had resolved during the main phase of the 
trial. One CNS bleed (extracranial) occurred throughout the study in a patient aged 0-6 years with an 
excellent haemostatic response.  
The median prophylactic dose used (41.9 IU/kg for 0-6 year old subjects and 44 IU/kg for 7-12 year 
old subjects) as well as the median dose required to treat and stop bleeding events (42.2 IU/kg for 0-6 
year old subjects and 43.2 IU/kg for 7-12 year old subjects) was in line with the recommended dose 
during the study (i.e. 40 IU/kg). This indicates the need for a single dose to treat the majority of 
bleeds (82.9% and 84.1% of bleeds in 0-6 and 7-12 year old PTPs, respectively) and is in line with 
reported median doses during the main phase (see EPAR). In fact, only 3 of 98 bleeds required more 
than 2 injections (i.e. once 5 injections for one bleed in a subject ≤6 years were required and for two 
bleeds in a subjects ≤12 years 3 injections were required). The mean annual consumption of 2208.6 
IU/kg for 0-6 year old and 2324.8 IU/kg for 7-12 year old patients is comparable to other Factor IX 
products with prolonged half-life. During main and extension phase the median duration of bleeds in 
the 0–6 years age group was 22.5 h (ranging from 0.2 to 666.3 h) and the median duration of bleeds 
in the 7-12 years age group was 24.5 h (ranging from 0.5 to 348.2 h). Median time from first dose to 
stop of bleed was 17.8 h (ranging from from 0 to 665.5 h) and 13.5 h (ranging from 0 to 288.7 h). It 
is recognised that two of the reported bleeds were exceptionally long. One in the 0-6 year age group 
had a traumatic subcutaneous bleed (bruising around eye) over 666.3 hours that was treated with a 
total of 5 injections (40 IU/kg of nonacog beta pegol each) over a 7-day period. Another event of 119 
hours in the 7-12 years age group was a mild, traumatic left elbow joint bleeding episode, the subject 
was treated twice for the bleeding episode (once for the initial bleed and once with prophylaxis).  
The evaluation of PROs of treatment with N9-GP appear compromised by low patient numbers that 
contributed to these measures (0-3 years: 6 questionnaires; 4-7 years: 3 children and 4 parent 
questionnaires; 8-12 years: 8 questionnaires each, children and parents). Thus, no reliable statement 
can be provided regarding these aspects. Health economic aspects support other conclusions regarding 
efficacy, as most patients (83.3%) did not miss any days at school due to bleeds, no intensive care 
hospitalisation was reported and parents missed on average 0.4 days due to bleeding of a child. 
After study protocol amendment 5 also major surgeries were allowed during the trial. A single major 
surgery in a 3 year old subjects was performed (arteriovenous fistula closure) with a reported excellent 
haemostatic response after following the recommended dosing of 80 IU/kg (2 identical doses of 41.8 
IU/kg were given). Furthermore, 17 minor surgeries were performed in 12 subjects ≤12 years with a 
mean dose level of 44.4 IU/kg. Upon request the MAH clarified that the additional prophylactic dose 
before surgery was administered in 10 of the 17 minor surgeries and in 7 cases no additional dose was 
administered besides the standard weekly prophylactic dose. The applied dose level was in line with 
the recommendation for preventive doses before minor surgeries. The haemostatic response to 
prophylactic treatment for minor surgeries was not recorded during study 3774.  
No Factor IX inhibitors (≥0.6 BU) were detected in any of the patients of trial 3774. One patient 
developed transient anti-nonacog beta pegol antibodies during the trial (detected at visit 23 and 24, 
first after 324 EDs). Lack of cross-reactivity to rFIX indicated presence of anti-PEG antibodies at the 
first visit. Another patient developed anti-CHO HCP antibodies during trial 3774 (detected at visit 11 
after 52 EDs). Importantly, no influence of antibodies on Factor IX activity was identified for that 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 73/138 
 
 
 
 
patient and there were no clinical signs or symptoms reported. It is concluded that the immunogenic 
potential of nonacog beta pegol did not affect efficacy of the medication during the trial period in 
paediatric PTPs. 
In summary, efficacy appears to be maintained over time in paediatric patients and dosing 
recommendations (i.e. once weekly dosing with 40 IU/kg) appear to suit the demand for the 
prophylactic treatment. None of the reported breakthrough bleeds was rated as a severe bleeding 
event. Still, the treatment of bleeds failed in 8 cases from a total of 98 bleeds, which requires further 
clarification, but does not indicate a major lack in efficacy for the treatment response to nonacog beta 
pegol in paediatric PTPs. Thus, also the treatment recommendation of 40 IU/kg for on demand 
mild/moderate bleeds can be followed in principle. It is concluded that reported efficacy results 
together with measured Factor IX activity at steady state (i.e. trough levels pre-dose) in the mild 
haemophilia range support the treatment of previously treated paediatric patients. 
NN7999-3895 
Efficacy data in paediatric PUPs 
The evaluation of immunogenicity was the primary aim of study 3895. Efficacy in long-term 
prophylaxis treatment as well as the treatment of bleeding episodes and further safety measures were 
evaluated as secondary objectives. The focus on immunogenicity in paediatric trials as well as the 
reported efficacy endpoints (e.g. bleeding rate, haemostatic response and Factor IX consumption) are 
acknowledged and well in line with data provided for other FIX products. The majority of the 148 
bleeds during trial 3895 was reported as traumatic bleeds (73.6%) and mostly located in the skin 
(39.9% were traumatic skin bleeds). A re-bleed occurred in only one case and bleeds during 
prophylaxis occurred in a rather balanced manner ≤4 days (52.8%) and >4 days (47.3%) after the 
last dose. The reported median duration of bleed is 20.6 hours, which is very comparable to the 
bleeding duration reported for PTPs ≤6 years (i.e. 20.3 hours). It is noted that 4.7% of all reported 
bleeds were considered severe bleeds (7.1% during pre-prophylaxis and 2.6% during prophylaxis 
treatment). In contrast, no severe bleeding events were reported for PTPs ≤6 years during trial 37774. 
Haemostatic outcomes are reported for 4 of the severe bleeding events (two excellent, one good and 
one moderate). The remaining 3 treated severe breakthrough bleeds (two traumatic and one 
spontaneous) were also treated with other FIX products or bypassing agents, which hampers 
interpretation of the response to nonacog beta pegol. From in total 8 bleeding episodes in 5 patients 
the use of other FIX products or bypassing agents is reported. Provided reasons (unavailability of trial 
product or lack of information regarding the clinical trial at the treating site, low titre inhibitors and one 
fatal CNS bleeding event treated with multiple agents in a subject considerably likely with positive FIX 
inhibitors) can be followed. In general, for the evaluation of haemostatic response only those events 
treated with nonacog beta pegol and no other FIX containing products or bypassing agents were 
considered. This is supported, as no clear treatment effect can be associated with nonacog beta pegol 
in these cases. Treatment failures were rare and all rated with moderate response (no reported poor 
treatment response), with one severe bleeding event (during pre-prophylaxis) and 4 mild/moderate 
events (one during pre-prophylaxis and three during prophylaxis). The reported success rate was 
96.4% (96.8% for PUPs on pre-prophylaxis and 96.1% for PUPs on prophylaxis) and was comparable 
during the study main phase (97.8%) and extension period (93.9%). Furthermore, >90% of bleeds 
were successfully treated with a single injection and >2 injections were required for only 2 bleeding 
episodes. The ABR during prophylactic treatment in PUPs was lower compared to PTPs of the same age 
group (considering actual age; Poisson estimated ABR for main and extension phase of both studies 
was 0.65 [95%CI: 0.34; 1.25] and 1.02 [95%CI: 0.68; 1.54], respectively) and was lower during 
extension than during the main phase (Poisson estimated ABR was 0.82 [95%CI: 0.34; 1.98] during 
the main phase and 0.58 [95%CI: 0.35; 1.14] during study extension). It is further highlighted that 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 74/138 
 
 
 
 
throughout the whole study period no target joint developed in PUPs (no target joint was present at 
study start). 
After study protocol amendment 1 also major surgeries were allowed during the trial. A single major 
surgery in a <1 year old PUP was performed during trial 3895 (bilateral medial rectus recession) with a 
reported excellent haemostatic response after two additional doses of nonacog beta pegol. 
Furthermore, 41 minor surgeries were performed in 21 patients with a total use of 34 additional doses 
of nonacog beta pegol and a median dose of 79.1 IU/kg during pre-prophylaxis (n=5 additional doses) 
and 46.5 IU/kg during prophylaxis (n=29 additional doses). It is noted that the median dose during 
pre-prophylaxis exceeds the planned dose of 40 IU/kg for minor surgeries by a factor of 2. Additional 
doses were given for port implantations as per protocol and on investigator’s discretion. The choice can 
be followed and does not imply any (expected) lack of efficacy. Especially during pre-prophylaxis this 
decision appears reasonable considering that subjects were not yet following the standard prophylactic 
dosing schedule. As for study 3774, the haemostatic response to prophylactic treatment for minor 
surgeries was not recorded during study 3895 as per study protocol.  
The median pre-prophylactic and prophylactic dose used (40.7 IU/kg and 44.1 IU/kg, respectively) as 
well as the median dose required to treat and stop bleeding events (41.2 IU/kg during pre-prophylaxis 
and 44.2 IU/kg during prophylaxis) was in line with the recommended dose during the study (i.e. 40 
IU/kg). This observation supports the need for a single dose to treat the majority of bleeds (>90% 
were successfully treated with a single injection). The median annual consumption of 2312.2 IU/kg for 
PUPs is comparable to the median annual consumption in PTPs of the same age group (i.e. 2208.6 
IU/kg) and is comparable to other FIX products with prolonged half-life. 
The FIX inhibitor rate was 8% for PUPs during trial 3895 (n=4 of 50 patients). Inhibitor development is 
one of the main critical aspects regarding treatment initiation with FIX products in PUPs and the 
reported rate for trial 3895 is in line with reports of other FIX products used for PUPs. In total 7 
patients were positive for anti-nonacog beta pegol antibodies (4 of those were high-titre antibodies 
concomitant with FIX inhibitor development and reduced FIX activity), 5 patients developed anti-CHO 
HCP antibodies and one patient was positive for anti-PEG antibodies at Visit 1 (i.e. prior to exposure to 
nonacog beta pegol). The immunogenic potential of nonacog beta pegol regarding anti-nonacog beta 
pegol antibodies, anti-CHO HCP antibodies and anti-PEG antibodies did not affect efficacy of the 
medication during the trial period in PUPs.  
NN7999-4260 
Supportive study 
Data provided from trial 4260 indicate an increased Factor IX activity upon exposure to a single-dose 
of 50 IU/kg nonacog beta pegol compared to the same dose of ALPROLIX. Both medications were 
given as i.v. bolus injections to patients with haemophilia B with a FIX activity ≤2% and without 
inhibitors. It is noted that all patients included in trial 4260 were ≥21 years of age. Thus, data from this 
trial are considered supportive information, but are not relevant for the concluded benefit risk of this 
variation, which addresses the extension of the indication for Refixia to treat paediatric patients ≤12 
years of age. Furthermore, the direct comparison of PK parameters across studies is limited since 
patients in trial 4260 were dosed with 50 IU/kg versus 40 IU/kg for trials 3747 and 3774. 
It is to be noted that possible assay interference, leading to over- or underestimation, was concluded 
for both FIX therapies during licensure, which was dependent on reagents and/or reference standards 
used (e.g. silica-based aPTT reagents appear better suitable for ALPROLIX, which on the other hand 
leads to overestimation of nonacog beta pegol activity; see EPARs and SmPCs of Alprolix and Refixia

for more detailed information). The MAH apparently considered this aspect by using a variety of assay 
setups. From available background information, the one-stage clotting assay seems more prone to 
possible interference. Thus, the chromogenic assay is considered more suitable for the direct 
comparison provided here. PK endpoints were derived using non-compartmental methods. Presented 
data indicate higher FIX activity levels after single dose nonacog beta pegol compared to ALPROLIX 
throughout the assay setups used. Still, the difference was considerably less pronounced with the 
chromogenic assay. Variations in assay setups used limits the possible comparison across trials and 
developmental programs. Published results for APROLIX in the EPAR regarding the time course of FIX 
activity levels after single exposure appear approximately in line with results presented for study 4260. 
Thus, despite limitation of the study it can be concluded that nonacog beta pegol appears to show a 
considerably higher FIX activity compared to ALPROLIX, at least after single infusion. 
No safety signal arose from this single dose trial in adult subjects. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The presented long-term data support the conclusion that nonacog beta pegol elevates FIX activity in 
paediatric patients to a level that allows the control over bleeding events in paediatric patients with 
haemophilia B (PTPs and PUPs). Thus, dosing recommendations appear to suit the demand for the 
prophylactic treatment (i.e. once weekly dosing with 40 IU/kg). Presented results for paediatric 
patients are also considered favourable when compared to results for other prolonged half-life FIX 
products that are licensed in the EEA for this age group. The recommended dose for treatment of 
bleeding episodes (40 IU/kg for mild/moderate bleeding and 80 IU/kg for severe bleeding) appears 
suitable and can be followed. It is concluded that the reported efficacy results together with the 
measured FIX activity at steady state (i.e. trough levels pre-dose) in the mild haemophilia range 
support the treatment of previously treated as well as previously untreated paediatric patients. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In the EU, the initial MA for nonacog beta pegol (Refixia) was received on 02 June 2017 and indicated 
for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients aged 12 years and above with haemophilia B 
(congenital factor IX deficiency). The safety profile during the initial evaluation of the product revealed 
the following: 
• 
The most common side effects observed in clinical trials were nausea, pruritus, fatigue and 
injection site reactions. Most of the adverse events were of mild severity and considered unrelated 
to nonacog beta pegol. Available safety data derived in clinical trials with nonacog beta pegol, 
although limited with regards to the number of patients, treatment duration and absence of 
specific monitoring for PEG-associated adverse events, did not reveal any signals hinting to 
negative effects of PEG accumulation. 
•  Repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys and rats revealed PEG present in choroid plexus of the 
brain (but not in other brain structures) whereas PEG alone studies demonstrated in addition 
vacuolation within macrophages in certain tissues in the same animal species. This was explained 
by accumulation of 40K PEG which is not easily broken down appearing histologically as vacuoles.  
Based on evidence presented in the initial dossier, a possible impact of accumulation of PEG on 
function of affected tissues/organs after long-term treatment could not be excluded with reasonable

certainty. In consequence, the label was granted for adults and children ≥12 years of age, in whom 
most neurodevelopmental milestones are already reached. 
The MAH has gathered additional data to support the extension of the indication to children below 12 
years of age. The following data are new in the current submission: 
 Trial 4260 – phase 1 pharmacokinetics (PK) of nonacog beta pegol vs. Alprolix (eftrenonacog alfa) in 
adults 
 Trial 3774 ongoing extension phase – phase 3 trial in previously treated patients (PTPs) ≤12 years 
 Trial 3895 ongoing main and extension phases – phase 3 trial in previously untreated patients 
(PUPs) <6 years 
 Study 4031 ongoing - global post-authorisation safety study (PASS) in previously treated children, 
adolescents and adult patients 
 Study 4404 ongoing - post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study in previously treated children, 
adolescents and adult patients in Japan. 
Apart from the new trials/studies/exposure included in this submission as described above, additional 
safety assessments have been performed. These safety assessments comprise the following: 
 PEG plasma concentration (in Trials 3747, 3775, 3774 and 3895). 
 Neurological examination (NE) (in Trials 3774 and 3895). 
 Neurocognitive assessments (NCAs) (in Trials 3774 and 3895). 
 Collection of all CNS-related AEs and renal AEs as MESIs (in Trials 3774 and 3895) 
 Determination of eGFR as a renal biomarker (in Trials 3774 and 3895). 
Patient exposure 
Safety data from the phase 3 Trials 3747, 3773, 3775 and 3774 in PTPs as well as from the first 
human dose Trial 3639 in PTPs, where 6 patients continued to Trial 3747, are pooled, including safety 
during surgery.   
The cut-off date for inclusion of data for ongoing trials 3774 and 3895 was 25 November 2020 and 
updated according to the latest interim clinical trial reports for trial 3774 (CTR finalised on 03 
September 2021) and 3895 (CTR finalised on 09 September 2021). 
The following information relates to the pool of PTPs based on Trials 3639, 3747, 3773, 3775 and 
3774: 
 For patients who transferred from one trial to another, the last visit in the first trial was identical to 
the first visit in the following trial. In these cases, the exposure time for the overlapping day is 
calculated only once. 
 In Trial 3775, patients could change their treatment regimen during the trial and thus contribute 
data in different treatment regimens. 
 In the surgery trial (Trial 3773), all exposure is included as surgery-related exposure including 
exposure during the preoperative period and also exposure related to treatment of bleeds. In the 
extension trial (Trial 3775), surgery-related exposure is calculated as the time from the preoperative 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023

loading dose until the time where the patient returned to the treatment regimen that he followed prior 
to a major surgery. 
 Exposure during minor surgery is included in the pool of either prophylactic or on-demand exposure 
depending on which treatment regimen the patient followed. 
 For exposure, baseline demographics and AEs (overall, SAEs, by relation to trial product and by 
severity), results in the pool of PTPs are presented by age (younger children 0-6 years, older children 
7-12 years, adolescents 13-17 years and adults ≥18 years). For the summary of exposure, results are 
presented by age at inclusion (i.e. age of the patient at first visit in the first nonacog beta pegol trial) 
or using duration of exposure within each age span, as applicable. For the summary of baseline 
characteristics, results are presented by age at inclusion. For the summary of AEs, results are 
presented by actual age of the patient at onset of the AE. This approach is due to the long duration of 
Trial 3774, implying that paediatric patients became adolescents or adults during the trial (in the 0-6 
year age group, 10 patients turned 7-12 years including 2 patients who further turned 13-17 years; in 
the 7-12 year age group, 10 patients turned 13-17 years including 3 patients who further turned ≥18 
years old). 
 Only one of the patients was elderly (defined as 65 years of age and older) at the time of inclusion. 
This patient is included in the age group of adults ≥18 years. 
 Clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs and physical examinations are described on a trial-by-trial 
basis. 
The safety results of the phase 3 Trial 3895 in PUPs are presented separately (except for NE and NCA 
data) since patients in this trial were previously untreated compared with all the other trials.

One (1) patient withdrew consent during the main phase. Of the 24 patients who completed the main 
phase, 22 patients (88%) entered the extension phase (11 patients in each age groups) while 2 
patients did not continue into the extension phase. The two patients fulfilled withdrawal criteria # 5 (5. 
Incapacity or unwillingness to follow trial procedures).  
Of the 22 patients, 12 patients remained in the trial and 10 patients withdrew during the extension 
phase as of interim cut-off. None of the patients withdrew due to AEs. All withdrawn patients 
contributed with data until the date of withdrawal. The FAS and SAS consisted of 25 patients. 
Table 36 Nonacog beta pegol exposure – full analysis set 
Given the long duration of the combined main and extension phases with an average treatment period 
of 6.03 years, 10 of the 12 patients enrolled in the 0-6 year age group grew into 7-12 years including 
2 patients who further grew into adolescents (13-17 year age group). Likewise, of the 13 patients 
enrolled in the 7-12 year age group, 10 patients grew into adolescents including 3 patients who further 
grew into adults. Thus, the trial included 12 adolescent patients and 3 adult patients.

As of the interim cut-off date, 50 patients were exposed to nonacog beta pegol for a total of 6709 EDs, 
and the corresponding mean (SD) ED per patient was 134.2 (92.8) Eds. The cumulative exposure time 
in the trial was 142.3 years, and the corresponding mean (range) exposure period per patient was 
2.85 (0.17−6.11) years. The majority of EDs and exposure time in trial were for prophylaxis treatment 
(mean Eds: 135.4, mean/range exposure time: 2.56 years, 0.06−6.06) relative to pre-prophylaxis 
treatment (mean Eds: 10.8, mean/exposure time: 0.69 years, 0.02−1.95). Out of the 38 patients who 
continued in the extension phase, 31 patients had been exposed to >100 Eds.

Figure 18 Patient flow – all patients 
A total of 32 patients in the age range of 0−1 years started on pre-prophylaxis treatment, and 18 
patients started directly on prophylaxis treatment. A total of 29 patients switched from pre-prophylaxis 
to prophylaxis treatment. For the 47 patients on prophylaxis regimen period, the age range at entry 
was 0−5 years. 
The MAH provided the exact number of patients who started directly with prophylaxis as well as the 
number of subjects who received pre-prophylaxis in PUP trial 3895. In addition, a plot was provided 
that depicts the time on pre-prophylaxis and prophylaxis for each subject. A substantial number of 
children <2 years of age (i.e. n=17) was exposed to weekly prophylaxis, and in addition 34 subjects 
<1 year of age started with pre-prophylaxis, of whom 20 received prophylaxis with longer dosing 
intervals and not only on-demand treatment of bleeds.

Adverse events  
Trials in PTPs 
An overview of AEs in PTPs is presented by age in Table 41. 
A total of 1019 AEs were reported in 98 (85.2%) patients [3.5 AEs per PYE]. The rate of AEs was 
slightly higher in children aged 0-12 years than in adolescents and adults aged ≥13 years (Table 41). 
This difference was mainly driven by AEs concerning common childhood diseases. 
Overall, the adverse event pattern was considered typical for the patient population. The most 
commonly reported AEs (reported in >10% of patients) were nasopharyngitis, cough, pyrexia, pain in 
extremity, contusion, arthralgia, headache, upper respiratory tract infection and influenza (Table 42). 
The vast majority of the adverse events (98%) were non-serious. The majority of AEs were of mild or 
moderate severity across all age groups. A total of 17 AEs in 12 patients were severe. One of the 
severe events (hypersensitivity) was judged by the investigator as probably related to nonacog beta 
pegol, while the remaining severe AEs were judged as unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol. 
A total of 37 AEs in 23 (20%) patients [0.1 AEs per PYE] were judged by the investigator as probably 
or possibly related to nonacog beta pegol. The majority of the events were non-serious, of mild or 
moderate severity and the majority of the patients recovered from their events. There were no obvious 
differences across age groups in the rate of these events. The most common AEs with possible or 
probable relation to nonacog beta pegol were fatigue and overdose. There were no obvious differences 
in AE frequency between races.

AE incidence 
A total of 741 AEs were reported in 50 (100%) PUPs [5.21 AEs per PYE] (Table 43). The majority of 
AEs (721 AEs in 49 (98%) patients) were judged by the investigator as unlikely related to nonacog

Table 44 Summary of most frequent (PT > 10%) adverse events – Trial 3895 – safety 
analysis set 
The vast majority of the adverse events (95%) were non-serious. The majority of the AEs were mild or 
moderate (Table 43). A total of 21 AEs in 15 patients were severe, of which 4 events were judged by 
the investigator as probably or possibly related to nonacog beta pegol.  
A total of 20 AEs reported in 10 (20%) patients [0.14 AEs per PYE] were judged by the investigator as 
probably or possibly related to nonacog beta pegol (Table 43). Most of the events were non-serious, of 
mild or moderate severity and the majority of the patients recovered from their events. The most 
common AEs with possible or probable relation to nonacog beta pegol were FIX inhibition, 
hypersensitivity and rash. 
Four (4) AEs of FIX inhibitor were reported in 4 patients. These AEs were all possibly or probably 
related to nonacog beta pegol as judged by the investigator, and they were all serious, moderate or 
severe and not recovered.

Three (3) AEs of hypersensitivity were reported in 2 patients. These AEs were all possibly or probably 
related to nonacog beta pegol as judged by the investigator. Two (2) of these AEs were reported for a 
patient who also reported FIX inhibition. These hypersensitivity AEs were all moderate or severe and 
were all recovered. 
Four (4) AEs of rash were reported in 1 patient. These AEs were all probably related to nonacogbeta 
pegol as judged by the investigator, all were non-serious, of mild severity and recovered. 
The remaining 9 AEs reported in 6 patients that were judged by the investigator to be possibly or 
probably related to nonacog beta pegol were reported as single PTs only (infusion site extravasation, 
pyrexia, hypoacusis, conjunctivitis, accidental underdose, language disorder, autism spectrum 
disorder, drug hypersensitiviy, anaphylactic reaction). 
There were no obvious differences in AE frequency between races. 
Adverse events related to major surgery 
Trials in PTPs 
AEs related to major surgery are included in the total pool of AEs described above. None of the AEs 
related to major surgery gave rise to safety concerns. 
Trial in PUPs 
There was one major surgery with no AEs. 
No safety signal arises from AEs reported after major or minor surgery. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAE 
Trials in PTPs 
A total of 18 SAEs in 16 (13.9%) patients [<0.1 AEs per PYE] were reported. The SAEs were mostly 
recorded as single events and across different SOCs. The SAEs occurred after 1–379 EDs of nonacog 
beta pegol, and no association between frequency of the events and exposure time was observed. 
One (1) severe SAE of hypersensitivity was judged by the investigator as probably related to nonacog 
beta pegol), while the remaining SAEs were judged by the investigator as unlikely related to nonacog 
beta pegol. This hypersensitivity event occurred in a patient in the first human dose trial 3639 and was 
already assessed during the initial dossier submission. 
The majority of the patients recovered from their SAEs, while 1 event had a fatal outcome 
(hepatocellular carcinoma) and 2 events (skin ulcer and Tourette’s syndrome) had the outcome ‘not 
recovered’. 
Trial in PUPs 
A total of 40 SAEs were reported in 23 (46.0%) patients [0.28 SAEs per PYE]. Half of the SAEs were 
recorded in the SOC Infections and infestations, which is generally expected in a paediatric population. 
The remaining SAEs were recorded across different SOCs and all SAEs were mostly reported as single 
events. The SAEs occurred after 1–241 EDs of nonacog beta pegol, and no association between 
frequency of the events and exposure time was observed. The majority of SAEs (32 out of 40) were

judged by the investigator as unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol while 8 SAEs in 6 patients were 
judged by the investigator as probably or possibly related to nonacog beta pegol. 
These related AEs included 4 AEs of FIX inhibitor (not recovered), 1 AE of anaphylactic reaction 
(recovered), 1 AE of hypersensitivity (recovered), 1 AE of language disorder (not recovered) and 1 AE 
of autism spectrum disorder (ASD; not recovered). 
The majority of patients had recovered from their SAEs (32), while 1 SAE (spontaneous ICH with 
associated seizures) had a fatal outcome and 7 SAEs had an outcome stated as ‘not recovered’. 
Deaths 
Trials in PTPs 
One (1) fatal AE was reported in Trial 3775. A 42-year-old patient was diagnosed with metastatic stage 
IV hepatocellular carcinoma after 499 days in the trial programme and died after 570 days. During the 
trial programme he had been exposed to nonacog beta pegol for 72 EDs. The patient had a history of 
hepatitis B and C and hepatic cirrhosis and as such at risk for development of hepatocellular 
carcinoma. The event was evaluated as unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol by the investigator and 
Novo Nordisk. 
No other fatal events occurred during the clinical trials with nonacog beta pegol in PTPs. 
Trial in PUPs 
One (1) fatal AE was reported in Trial 3895. The very young child was enrolled on pre-prophylaxis. The 
investigator judged this fatal AE of ICH to be unlikely related to exposure to nonacog beta pegol, while 
development of (non-confirmed) FIX inhibitors was judged by the investigator as possibly related to 
nonacog beta pegol. 
Other Significant Events 
Adverse events related to the theoretical safety concern of PEG 
AEs that might theoretically be related to PEG following exposure to nonacog beta pegol were identified 
through a broad search. The SMQ searches ‘acute renal failure’ and ‘drug-related hepatic disorders’ 
were chosen because the kidneys and the liver are known sites of PEG elimination. The NNMQ search 
‘CNS events’ consisting of the SOCs Nervous system disorders and Psychiatric disorders was chosen 
based on nonclinical data showing presence of PEG in the choroid plexus of the brain. CNS-related AEs 
were to be reported as MESIs in Trials 3774 and 3895 from December 2017 upon implementation of 
protocol amendments for both trials. Renal AEs were to be reported as MESIs in Trials 3774 and 3895 
from June 2018 upon implementation of protocol amendments for both trials. 
Renal adverse events 
Trials in PTPs 
A total of 2 renal disorder AEs (proteinuria and renal impairment) were reported in 2 (1.7%) patients. 
Both events were non-serious and judged by the investigator as unlikely related to nonacog beta 
pegol.  
Trial in PUPs 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 91/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The SMQ search did not identify any renal disorder AEs. 
Hepatic adverse events 
Trials in PTPs 
A total of 11 hepatic AEs were reported in 7 (6.1%) patients. Three (3) of the 7 patients were hepatitis 
C positive at entry into the trial, of which 1 patient reported 3 events of abnormal liver parameters 
which is expected for this population, since a significant number of adult patients with haemophilia B 
were infected with hepatitis C via administration of pooled factor concentrates, cryoprecipitate or fresh 
frozen plasma in the 1970s and early 1980s. 
In addition, 1 event of abnormal prothrombin level, 1 event of prolonged prothrombin time, 1 event of 
hepatic pain and 1 event of increased INR were reported in 3 hepatitis C negative patients, all of which 
were judged unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol and had an outcome of recovered. One hepatic AE 
(hepatocellular carcinoma) was fatal. 
Trial in PUPs 
One event of non-serious moderate hepatic function abnormal was reported. The event was judged by 
the investigator as unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol and had an outcome of recovered. 
The reported hepatic AEs were evaluated by Novo Nordisk as unlikely to be a clinical consequence of 
long-term exposure to PEG. 
CNS-related adverse events 
Trials in PTPs 
A total of 52 CNS-related AEs in 30 (26.1%) patients [0.2 AEs per PYE] were reported. The most 
commonly reported event was headache (32 events in 15 patients), gait disturbance (3 events in 3 
patients) and speech disorder (2 events in 1 patient). All other AEs were events of single occurrence. 
All 52 AEs identified in the search were non-serious and of mild or moderate severity, except 1 AE of 
Tourette’s disorder which was reported as serious. The majority of the AEs were judged by the 
investigator as unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol, except 5 AEs that were judged by the 
investigator as probably or possibly related: 3 events of headache in 3 patients and 2 events of speech 
disorder in 1 patient. All 5 events were mild and had an outcome of recovered. 
Headache 
All 32 events of headache were non-serious and most were mild and judged by the investigator as 
unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol. None of the events led to withdrawal from treatment and the 
outcome of all events was recovered or recovering. The majority of the events (22 out of 32) were 
reported within the patient’s first 100 EDs and all events occurred within 1–9 days after the last dose 
of nonacog beta pegol. The duration of headache ranged from 1 to 6 days for most events, while 4 
events had a duration of 18, 23, 27 and 61 days. 
For 16 of the 32 events of headache, other AEs which could give rise to headache, were reported 
within +/- 7 days of the headache. These events were: body aches (4 events), nasopharyngitis (3), 
fever (3), nausea (3), vomiting (3), upset stomach (2), fatigue (2), sore throat (1), earache (1), 
rhinorrhoea (1) and tiredness (1).

The reported AEs of headache were evaluated by Novo Nordisk as unlikely to be a clinical consequence 
of long-term exposure to PEG, as most events were of short duration and the patients recovered while 
continuously being treated with nonacog beta pegol. For 50% of the AEs of headache, other AEs 
occurred within +/- 1 week, pointing to alternative aetiologies of the headache. 
Trial in PUPs 
A total of 35 CNS-related AEs in 15 (30.0%) patients [0.2 AEs per PYE] were reported. The most 
common AEs (on PT level) were speech disorders developmental (5 AEs in 5 patients), sleep disorder 
(8 AEs in 1 patient) and headache (5 AEs in 1 patient). All events, except 4 cases of speech disorder 
developmental, had the outcome recovered. Febrile convulsion and intracranial haemorrhage were 
each reported in 2 patients, while all other AEs were events of single occurrence. 
The majority of the 35 CNS-related AEs identified in the search were non-serious, of mild or moderate 
severity and judged by the investigator as unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol. 
Four CNS-related events in 4 patients were SAEs (2 events of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), 1 event 
of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 1 event of language disorder). Three of these SAEs were 
severe (2 ICH and 1 ASD) of which 1 event of ICH had a fatal outcome. Two of the SAEs (in 2 patients) 
were judged by the investigator as probably or possibly related to nonacog beta pegol (ASD and 
language disorder).  
Most patients recovered from the CNS-related AEs; however, due to the natural course of language 
development, a few patients with speech delays had not recovered at the interim cut-off date.  
Two CNS-related SAEs (ASD and language disorder) in 2 patients in Trial 3895 were judged by the 
investigator to be probably or possibly related to nonacog beta pegol. PEG plasma levels for the 2 
patients were within the observed mean steady state range for all patients in Trial 3895 (i.e., 4.7 to 
6.4 μg/mL) and both patients had a low number of EDs at the time of AE onset (87 and 46 EDs). For 
comparison, the assumed time to steady state in the human choroid plexus, as identified in nonclinical 
modelling studies, corresponds to approximately 250 EDs in a clinical trial setting of once-weekly 
dosing. The NCA outcomes collected from these 2 patients were considered invalid due to use of 
interpreter. 
A very young child was enrolled on pre-prophylaxis. An AE of suspected autism was reported after 
having received 87 EDs of nonacog beta pegol. No abnormalities were noted at the time of enrolment. 
According to the patient's mother, the patient´s aunt (sister of his father) was diagnosed with 
oligophrenia (diagnosis not confirmed). The patient was born in gestational week 39. The patient did 
not react normally to verbal or visual orders, showed increasingly aberrant behaviour and no social 
interaction and hypoacusis was reported as a non-serious AE. The hypacusis was revealed as not 
present after myringotomy. The patient visited the Neuropediatric service, confirming the diagnostic 
impression of autism spectrum disorder and was requested for genetic studies, array and study of 
fragile X chromosome. The genetic report revealed that fragile X chromosome syndrome was not 
present. Genetic analyses were planned. The event was upgraded to serious by the investigator 
(seriousness criteria ‘persistent or significant disability/incapacity’ and ‘important medical event’) 
based on a request from Novo Nordisk to re-evaluate the seriousness of the condition. The event was 
categorised as ‘possibly related’ to treatment with nonacog beta pegol by the investigator and the 
patient was withdrawn. In agreement with the patient’s family, it was decided to keep him in the trial 
for follow-up. The patient was treated with another recombinant FIX product and was to be followed by 
scheduled visits of 6-months intervals at the trial site. Additionally, the patient was to be followed by 
regular assessments in a neuro-paediatric department and the diagnosis stayed unchanged.

A very young child diagnosed with haemophilia B, was enrolled on pre-prophylaxis. The patient was 
delivered by caesarean section with no complications or defects at birth. Two minor head traumas and 
respiratory tract infections had been reported for the patient since birth. According to the patient’s 
mother, the patient’s aunt (sister of his father) was diagnosed with oligophrenia (diagnosis not 
confirmed). The patient had a brother diagnosed with ASD. The patient visited the Neuro-paediatrician. 
After the neurologic and clinical exploration, he was diagnosed with a chronic language disorder and 
suspicion of ADHD after 1.5 years in the trial and 46 EDs in trial. The event was categorised as 
moderate in severity and treatment was discontinued. The patient was referred to follow-up with a 
neuro-paediatrician for confirmation of chronic language delay and, due to the young age of the 
patient, referred for further follow-up on age-appropriate diagnosis of ADHD. The patient switched to a 
commercial FIX product. The patient had a normal growth development according to his age. 
Following request, the MAH clarified that the 2 patients are siblings. 
Autism has a rather complex pathogenetic background which is not yet completely understood and no 
clear relationship between ASD and nonacog beta pegol or PEG exposure can be reasonably 
established. A recent study from the United Kingdom found a significantly higher prevalence of ASD in 
boys with haemophilia compared with the general population and unaffected boys aged 8 years 
(Bladen M et al. Haemophilia. 2020; 26(S4):13). Speech disorder represents a commonly occurring 
developmental phenomenon in childhood and genetic or environmental factors may play a role in the 
aetiology. Based on the currently available information, Novo Nordisk evaluates the above 2 events of 
ASD and language disorder to be unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol. 
Sleep disorders 
A total of 8 AEs of sleep disorder were reported in 1 patient. All 8 events were mild and judged by the 
investigator as unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol. These events were reported in a child over a 
period from February 2019 to January 2020. All events were of 1 or 2 days’ duration, and the outcome 
was recovered for all events. For 5 of the 8 events, the event of sleep disorder was reported together 
with other AEs that negatively influences sleep: cough, catarrh, pyrexia, sore head, sore throat, sore 
mouth, suspected worms and blocked nose. 
Speech disorders 
A total of 8 AEs related to speech delay or language disorders were reported in 8 patients. The 
majority (7 out of 8 events) were non-serious, mild or moderate and judged by the investigator as 
unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol. Three of the patients had recovered or were recovering from 
the event at the time of data cut-off. Of the remaining 5 patients, 1 had a medical history of hearing 
difficulties, unclear speech, frequent ear infections, developmental delays in talking and understanding, 
and a family history of neurological disease, emotional problems, learning disability, and behaviour 
problems. One patient had an ICH prior to the event. The remaining 3 patients had 46, 53 and 84 EDs 
at the time of onset of the event. Modelling based on nonclinical studies indicate that it takes 4.5 years 
to achieve steady state concentrations of PEG in choroid plexus. This corresponds to approximately 
250 EDs in a clinical trial setting of once-weekly dosing, i.e. a considerably higher number of EDs than 
received at onset of these 3 events of speech disorders.  
Novo Nordisk evaluates that there is no indication that any of the AEs captured by the NNMQ search 
‘CNS events’ are clinical consequences of long-term PEG exposure. In some cases, information is 
available that points to an alternative aetiology (including medical or family history). In other cases, 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 94/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
few EDs at the time of onset of the event, the short duration of the event and the full recovery during 
continuous treatment with nonacog beta pegol all point to an alternative explanation. 
Evaluation of risks associated with long-term exposure to PEG 
This section presents an evaluation of the CNS-related AEs and neurological and neurocognitive 
findings in relation to exposure and PEG plasma concentrations for patients in Trials 3774 and 3895. 
CNS-related AEs were reported in all age groups, regardless of number of exposure days. PEG plasma 
levels for patients with CNS-related AEs in PTPs and PUPs ranged from 0.1 to 8.1 μg/mL (mean steady 
state concentration ranged from 4.7 to 6.9 μg/mL in these trials). Occurrence of CNS-related AEs did 
not seem to be related to peaks in PEG plasma levels. 
Most CNS-related AEs occurred before 4.5 years of exposure which is the time to steady state in the 
human choroid plexus, as identified in nonclinical modelling studies. Thus, data from Trials 3774 and 
3895 did not indicate any correlation between PEG plasma levels and occurrence of CNS-related AEs. 
Most patients recovered from the CNS-related AEs; however, due to the natural course of language 
development, a few patients with speech delays had not recovered at the interim cut-off date. Two 
CNS-related SAEs (ASD and language disorder) in 2 patients in Trial 3895 were judged by the 
investigator to be probably or possibly related to nonacog beta pegol. PEG plasma levels for the 2 
patients were within the observed mean steady state range for all patients in Trial 3895 (i.e., 4.7 to 
6.4 μg/mL, Trial 3895-EXT) and both patients had a low number of EDs at the time of AE onset (87 
and 46 EDs). For comparison, the assumed time to steady state in the human choroid plexus, as 
identified in nonclinical modeling studies, corresponds to approximately 250 EDs in a clinical trial 
setting of once-weekly dosing. The NCA outcomes collected from these 2 patients were considered 
invalid due to use of interpreter. 
Autism has a rather complex pathogenetic background which is not yet completely understood and no 
clear relationship between ASD and nonacog beta pegol or PEG exposure can be reasonably 
established. A recent study from the United Kingdom found a significantly higher prevalence of ASD in 
boys with haemophilia compared with the general population and unaffected boys aged 8 years 
(Bladen M, et al., 2020). Speech disorder represents a commonly occurring developmental 
phenomenon in childhood and genetic or environmental factors may play a role in the aetiology. Based 
on the currently available information, Novo Nordisk evaluates the above 2 events of ASD and 
language disorder to be unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol. 
Most NEs were evaluated as normal. The abnormal neurological findings pertained almost exclusively 
to abnormal language and were often consistent with pre-existing language delay. A total of 5 (13%) 
patients reported shifts down in language skills (Trial 3895), and this rate is comparable to that of 
speech/language delays in children under the age of 5 years in the general population (Law J, et al., 
2000).In eTHINK, abnormal or delayed ‘language skills’ and developmental ‘milestones’ were found in 
more than 5% of the population, and this was mainly seen in the younger age groups.  
The NCAs comprised the qualitative evaluations of neurodevelopment, cognitive performance, 
behavioural function, adaptive skills, executive function and attention and processing speed. Overall, 
no consistent pattern was observed in these standardised, regularly repeated cognitive assessments, 
and performance was generally comparable to that of the eTHINK population. 
Cognitive outcomes seemed to be independent of PEG exposure; hence, for patients assumed to be at 
steady state (i.e. patients with > 250 EDs), no noticeable deviations from the general pattern was 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 95/138 
 
 
 
 
 
observed. No clear relation between change in categorisation of ‘clinical concern’ and drug exposure or 
PEG plasma concentration was seen. 
Results from Trial 3895 confirmed that most paediatric patients with severe haemophilia start therapy 
early in life, at an age where few neurological and NCAs are applicable. In these patients, it is difficult 
to obtain neurological and neurocognitive responses that, to a sufficient extent, can be used to assess 
long-term safety outcome measures within the same patient. Instead, Novo Nordisk followed a 
generally accepted practice and compared neurological and neurocognitive performance with age-
matched controls, i.e the eTHINK population. This was done using an extensive neurological and 
neurocognitive programme designed to capture neurodevelopmental changes and deficits known to 
exist in patients with haemophilia. Using this method, it was possible to investigate whether patients 
treated with nonacog beta pegol reached the same milestones as the general haemophilia population. 
Testing was done with brief intervals to accommodate age-related neurodevelopmental fluctuations in 
the maturing brain. Results from Trial 3895 showed no consistent pattern in terms of neurocognitive 
performance and overall, the pattern was similar to that of the eTHINK population. 
In conclusion, the NEs and NCAs did not give rise to safety concerns, and no indications of any 
neurodevelopmental deficits or CNS-related AEs caused by long-term exposure to nonacog beta pegol 
was found. 
Laboratory findings 
Trial 3774-EXT 
The mean (SD) values of eGFR for 12 patients in the 0-6 year age group was 139.4 (32.8) mL/min and 
the mean (SD) values of eGFR for 13 patients in the 7-12 year age group was 105.2 (10.0) mL/min.

EMA/319611/2023

Figure 22 Biochemistry – individual profiles of eGFR (mL/min) - safety analysis set 
One patient had eGFR values >90 ml throughout trial 3774 and 3774-EXT, but at the End of trial visit 
reported a value of 44.92. No additional information regarding these eGFR values in this patient is 
available. However, no other clinical data imply an influence of nonacog beta pegol on renal function. 
Trial 3895-EXT 
The mean eGFR profile was within the level of normal kidney function (> 90 mL/min) throughout the 
trial and did not decrease over time. 
Less variability for eGFR is observable for PUPs in trial 9895 than for PTPs in trial 3774. 
No safety signal arises from the eGFR values observed in the two studies.

FIX inhibitors 
Trials in PTPs 
None of the 115 patients in the pool of PTPs had any positive FIX inhibitor samples (≥0.6 BU). 
Furthermore, none of the 15 PTPs in Trial 4260 had any positive FIX inhibitor samples (≥0.6 BU). Thus, 
no PTPs developed FIX inhibitors. 
Trial in PUPs 
In Trial 3895, 4 out of the 50 PUPs developed FIX inhibitors. The estimated inhibitor rate was 8.0% (1-
sided 97.5% upper CI: 21%). Three (3) out of these 4 patients developed high-titre inhibitors within 5 
EDs and 1 patient developed low-titre inhibitors after 27 EDs. Two (2) of the 3 patients who developed 
high-titre inhibitors were exposed to other rFIX product(s) than nonacog beta pegol prior to their 
Assessment report

positive inhibitor test. The patient who developed low-titre inhibitors was also treated with another 
rFIX product prior to participation in the trial. 
An additional (fifth) patient developed low-titre non-confirmed inhibitors. 
Other antibodies 
Assessments of non-neutralising anti-nonacog beta pegol antibodies were done in all trials and 
assessments of anti-CHO HCP antibodies were done in Trials 3747, 3773, 3774, 3775 and 3895. In 
Trial 3639, testing for anti-CHO HCP antibodies was only performed in cases of allergic/anaphylactic 
reactions or inhibitor development. 
Trials in PTPs 
In Trials 3747, 3773, 3774 and 3775, 4 PTPs were positive for anti-nonacog beta pegol antibodies, of 
which 2 were already positive prior to exposure to nonacog beta pegol. None of the anti-nonacog beta 
pegol binding antibodies had any inhibitory effect, and patients were only transiently positive. Overall, 
detection of antibodies did not correlate with any AEs or reduced FIX activity levels. 
PK profiles for the 4 patients with antibodies against nonacog beta pegol are shown in Figure 25 on 
linear scale. The PK profiles did not show any signs of reduced FIX activity when compared to mean 
plasma FIX activity profiles at steady state. 
One Patient (40 IU/kg) had an incomplete PK profile assessment at an unscheduled visit but was re-
assessed one week later at another unscheduled visit. Anti-nonacog beta pegol antibody assessments 
were performed at scheduled visits, and showed negative results. Accordingly, no increased risk of 
unfavourable effects associated with immunogenicity was identified in PTPs. 
Figure 25 PK profile for patients having at least one positive nonacog beta pegol binding 
antibody measurement – Trials 3747, 3775 and 3774 – safety analysis set 
A total of 5 PTPs had positive tests with low titres for anti-CHO HCP antibodies. One of these patients 
was positive prior to dosing with nonacog beta pegol. All positive anti-CHO HCP antibodies were low-
titre, and none of these were reported as AEs.

Positive anti-PEG antibodies were indirectly concluded in those samples with positive anti-nonacog beta 
pegol binding antibodies and no cross-reactivity to rFIX. A total of 4 PTPs were indirectly tested 
positive for anti-PEG antibodies. One of these patients was positive prior to dosing with nonacog beta 
pegol. All post-dose positive anti-PEG antibodies were low-titre and transient, with no clinical signs or 
symptoms or reduced FIX activity levels associated. 
Overall, detection of antibodies in PTPs did not correlate with any AEs or reduced trough FIX activity 
levels. Accordingly, no increased risk of unfavourable effects associated with immunogenicity was 
identified in PTPs. 
Trial in PUPs 
A total of 7 PUPs were positive for anti-nonacog beta pegol binding antibodies. Four (4) patients 
developed persistent high titre anti-nonacog beta pegol binding antibodies concomitant with FIX 
inhibitor development and reduced FIX activity, while 2 other patients developed transient low titre 
anti-nonacog beta pegol binding antibodies. One patient was only positive prior to exposure to 
nonacog beta pegol. 
A total of 5 PUPs were positive for anti-CHO HCP antibodies, of which 1 patient was only positive prior 
to dosing with nonacog beta pegol. All positive anti-CHO HCP antibodies were low-titre. In 1 PUP, the 
positive test for anti-CHO HCP antibodies occurred at the same time as AEs of anaphylactic reaction 
and factor IX inhibition. Two weeks later at the EOT visit, the patient was negative for anti-CHO HCP 
antibodies. In the other patients, there were no clinical signs or symptoms associated with the positive 
anti-CHO HCP tests. 
Positive anti-PEG antibodies were indirectly concluded in those samples with positive anti-nonacog beta 
pegol binding antibodies and no cross-reactivity to rFIX. The only sample positive for anti-PEG 
antibodies was prior to exposure to nonacog beta pegol (low-titre). 
Overall, there was no increased risk of unfavourable effects associated with immunogenicity identified 
in PUPs. 
Haematology, biochemistry, coagulation-related parameters and urinalysis 
Overall, no clinically relevant changes associated with exposure to trial product have been observed for 
parameters of haematology, biochemistry, coagulation-related parameters and urinalysis in any of the 
clinical trials with nonacog beta pegol. 
PEG plasma concentration 
The nonclinical finding that PEG is present in choroid plexus epithelial cells has raised concerns about 
long-term exposure to nonacog beta pegol and potential neurodevelopmental sequelae in children. It is 
therefore important to provide reassurance that PEG steady state concentrations in patients treated 
with nonacog beta pegol will be well below the PEG concentration where no toxicities, no PEG-related 
vacuolation, and no cellular changes have been observed in the nonclinical chronic toxicity studies in 
rats. Consequently, measurements of PEG plasma levels were implemented in Trials 3774 and 3895 
prospectively from December 2017 as well as measured in additional historic visit samples in Trials 
3747 and 3775 if consented and available, i.e. full profiles are not available for all patients. 
In both Trials 3774 and 3895, PEG plasma concentrations reached steady state after approximately 6 
months in patients on prophylactic treatment (Figure 26 and Figure 27). Following this timepoint, the 
PEG plasma concentrations remained at the steady state level until last measurement during 
treatment. The mean steady state PEG plasma concentration ranged from 4.7-6.9 μg/mL.  
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 100/138 
 
 
 
 
 
In Trial 3774, the mean and individual PEG plasma concentration-time profiles indicated that the PEG 
plasma concentration was slightly higher in the 7-12 years age group than in the 0-6 years age group 
(Figure 26), corresponding to a physiologically expected decrease in renal clearance of nonacog beta 
pegol occurring with increasing age.

analysis set 
Figure 27 PEG – mean profiles of PEG plasma concentration (ug/mL) – Trial 3895 - safety 
analysis set 
The mean PEG plasma concentration-time profile from Trials 3747 and 3775 was based on historic visit 
samples and was therefore shorter than the one seen in Trial 3774. Still, the PEG plasma 
concentration-time profile in Trials 3747 and 3775 (Figure 28) was comparable with the profile seen in 
Trial 3774. However, for some time points PEG plasma concentration was slightly higher in Trials 3747 
and 3775, which is in alignment with the minor increase in PEG plasma concentration with increasing 
age described above.

Safety in special populations 
Neurological and neurodevelopmental evaluations in paediatric subjects 
The presence of PEG in choroid plexus epithelial cells is a nonclinical finding which has raised concerns 
about long-term exposure to nonacog beta pegol and potential neurodevelopmental sequelae in 
children. To address this issue in a structured manner, protocol amendments were implemented to 
monitor PEG plasma concentrations, to capture all CNS related AEs as MESIs, and to perform twice-
yearly age-appropriate NEs and NCAs. Further, to collect more neurological and neurocognitive data, 
the recruitment period was extended to include un-exposed patients aged 0-6 years (Trial 3895). 
In developmental neuroscience, studies with cross-sectional designs have frequently been used to 
generate knowledge about the degree to which specific neural characteristics and processes are 
presented within certain age groups (Guyer AE, et al., 2018), and striking differences do exist between 
age groups in specific functional domains (e.g., reward signals and emotions increase brain activity in 
adolescence relative to childhood) (Chein J, et al., 2011; Guyer AE, et al., 2008). Thus, brain 
development is a dynamic process of growing, creating new connections and further developing its 
capacity to process information. These processes are dependent on age and individual experiences as 
well as elimination of extra synapses during early childhood and adulthood (‘synaptic pruning’) (Guyer 
AE, et al., 2018). Both linear and nonlinear performance patterns have been found during early brain 
maturation at repeated testing during infancy (MacNeill LA, et al., 2018). 
Due to the different timing of neuronal maturation in different regions it becomes difficult to compare 
an initial cognitive assessment with a subsequent assessment within the same individual. As an 
example, working memory cannot be accurately measured in a 1-year-old, and as working memory 
develops over time, comparing working memory in a 3-year-old with that of the same child as 5-year-
old will not give any indications of whether or not the child is following a normal developmental path. 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 102/138 
 
 
 
 
 
A neurological baseline seems also difficult to establish as many of the NEs are age-specific (e.g. gait 
cannot be measured in the very young patients who are not yet walking). In addition, neurological 
sequelae have been reported in 39% of patients with ICH, impacting outcome of later NEs, such as 
language, in these patients (Chalmers EA, et al., 2018). 
To overcome the difficulty in establishing a baseline for NEs and neurocognitive function, Novo Nordisk 
has developed a normative dataset of neurological, neurocognitive and neurobehavioral performance in 
a cross-sectional study, i.e. the eTHINK study (HAEM-4436). This normative dataset provides an age-
matched control population comprising children and young adults with haemophilia to which patients in 
Trials 3774 and 3895 can be compared. Haemophilia patients were chosen for the normative dataset 
as a longitudinal study has shown that impaired neurological and neurocognitive performance occur 
more frequently in haemophilia patients (Loveland KA, et al.,1994; Sirois PA, et al., 1998). The eThink 
study enrolled 551 male subjects with haemophilia A or B up to 21 years of age. 
Based on the current knowledge of brain maturation and disease pattern in haemophilia patients, a 
carefully selected battery of NCAs, designed by an external vendor with expertise in 
neuropsychological testing, was implemented in Trials 3774 and 3895. The selected battery was 
designed to capture subtle changes in e.g. attention, processing speed and executive functioning. 
Testing was done with brief intervals to mitigate the impact of age-related fluctuations, change in age-
related instruments (i.e, progression from Cogstate Paediatric to Cogstate Adult battery), impact of 
joint bleeds on gait and to capture safety signals. An overview of the instruments applied to evaluate 
neurological, neurocognitive and neuro-behavioural function is provided in Table 45.

 General appearance including language, social and developmental aspects, handedness, head 
circumference and level of consciousness 
 Cranial nerves in relation to sight including pupillary reaction to light, visual fields and acuity, and 
eye movements, facial sensation and movement, hearing, palate sound and tongue movement and 
trapezius muscle function 
 Tone of truncal, upper and lower extremity right and left 
 Strength of upper and lower extremity right and left 
 Reflexes of biceps, triceps, knee and ankle jerk, all right and left as well as Babinski 
 Sensory aspect of cold, pin prick, light touch and proprioception (tor up/down)

Any pre-existing physical or neurological finding that was present at the time of enrolment in the trial 
were reported as medical history, new abnormal findings or any changes in the findings which fulfilled 
the criteria of an AE were recorded as such. 
Neurocognitive assessments 
Neurocognitive assessments were included as a result of protocol amendment 10 (27-June-2018) in 
trial 3774 and as a result of protocol amendment 6 (29 June 2018) in trial 3895. 
A set of comprehensive instruments for the neurocognitive assessments were employed. An overview 
of these instruments, and the age groups in which they were to be used, is provided in Table 46. A 
short description of the instruments, and how they were used in this study, is provided in Table 47.

The following neurocognitive domains in this trial were assessed in all countries at every NCA: 
 Executive function: The Global Executive Composite score is an overarching summary score that 
incorporates all of the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function ((BRIEF 2) clinical scales 
(Table 47) and report three indices: 
 The Behaviour Regulation Index, which relates to systematic problem solving and, more generally, 
supports appropriate self-regulation 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 106/138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Cognitive Regulation Index relates directly to the ability to actively problem solve in a variety of 
contexts and to complete tasks such as schoolwork. 
 The Emotion Regulation Index which represents the child’s ability to regulate emotional responses 
and to shift set or adjust to changes in environment, people, plans, or demands. 
Three (3) rating scales were used and these are described in Table 47. 
 Cognitive assessments (Attention/processing speed /working memory): The Cogstate computerised 
cognitive test battery completed by the patient and assessed the processing speed and attention by 
visual and verbal stimuli. Two (2) rating scales were used. Please refer to Table 47 for details. 
Further, the following neurocognitive domains were assessed in English speaking countries at every 
second NCA: 
 General cognitive ability/intelligence was assessed by Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, 
Second Edition (WASI-II) for patients aged 7 to 21 years which provides a full scale IQ composite 
score estimating intellectual functioning (Table 47). 
 Behavioural/emotional neurocognition: The behavioural assessment system for children-third edition 
(BASC-3) measures both emotional and behavioural problems by parents (PRS), and self-report (SRP). 
Five (5) rating scales were used. Please refer to Table 47 for more details. The composite scores for 
the BASC-3 are presented in Table 47. 
 Adaptive behaviour was assessed by the adaptive behaviour assessment system- third edition 
(ABAS-3). An Adaptive Behaviour Domain Score assessed level of everyday performance of tasks that 
is required for a person to fulfil typical roles in society. Two (2) rating scales were used. Please refer to 
Table 47 for further details. 
Neurological and neurocognitive assessments were performed every 6 months and at least 6 days after 
the last dose at the end of trial visit in trial 3774 and according to the trial flowchart table 48 in trial 
3895: 
Table 48 Trial flowchart 
An independent EERP (External Expert Review Panel) evaluated key neurodevelopmental, 
neurocognitive, neurological and neurobehavioral milestones in Trials 3895 and 3774 on individual 
level and on trial level. The EERP consisted of neuropsychologists, a paediatric neurologist and a 
haematologist.  
The neuropsychologists and paediatric neurologist of the EERP evaluated the results of the initial and 
subsequent neurocognitive and neurological assessments and provided individual narratives, including 
a categorisation of whether or not clinical concerns and contributing factors were identified for the 
patients. A clinical concern was defined as a cognitive performance or rating scale outcome below a 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023

cut-off of -1.5 SD versus the eTHINK study (HAEM-4436, eTHINK study). A deterioration in all domains 
for a patient could also give rise to as a clinical concern, even though the cut-off of -1.5 SD was not 
reached. Contributing factors were identified from the patient’s SDH and HH, and from other sources 
presenting factors which could impact cognitive or behavioural development. Most patients with a 
clinical concern had contributing factors. However, a patient could have a contributing factor (e.g. 
premature birth) but no clinical concern at first assessment. The EERP were not provided with 
information about dosing and did not evaluate the neurocognitive results in the light of treatment with 
nonacog beta pegol. 
The EERP met every 6 to 12 months to evaluate information on all exposed patients with at least 1 
NCA. A summary report from each EERP meeting was prepared by Cogstate Ltd. assisted by 2 EERP 
members acting as consultants. Based on the EERP evaluation, Novo Nordisk performed an overall 
evaluation of the theoretical risk associated with PEG exposure. 
Neurological and neurocognitive data up until 25 November 2020 from Trials 3774 and 3895 are 
included in this summary. 
Compiled summary of the EERP evaluation reports (Trials 3774 and 3895) 
 Most patients were within normal limits for age-based neurocognitive performance measures and 
rating scales at initial assessment. 
 No consistent pattern was observed for cognitive or behavioural performance for patients with or 
without clinical concern over time (change from initial to last assessment). 
 The identified concerns were somewhat dependent on consistency of measures available for various 
age groups and at various timepoints. Thus, in the younger patients the primary identified concerns 
were in language and motor domains of which abnormal language was most frequent reported and 
often consistent with pre-existing neurological conditions such as language delay or ASD. In the older 
patients, the primary identified concerns were in attention, processing speed and executive functioning 
often consistent with pre-existing contributing factors. 
 Most patients rated with ‘normal’ neurologic examinations at initial assessment remained stable at 
subsequent assessments. 
 Four (4) out of 16 patients in Trial 3774 had clinical concerns at initial assessment, and 1 patient 
had a ‘might be’ clinical concern. Thirteen (13) out of 38 patients in Trial 3895 had clinical concerns at 
initial assessment. Most of these patients had significant contributing factors consistent with the 
neurocognitive findings. In the younger patients (Trial 3895), 5 out of the 13 patients with an initial 
clinical concern changed to having no clinical concern, and 2 (out of 13) changed to having a ‘might be’ 
clinical concern at subsequent assessment. In the older patients (Trial 3774), 2 out of the 4 patients 
with an initial clinical concern changed to having a ‘might be’ clinical concern, and the 1 patient with a 
‘might be’ clinical concern at initial assessment changed to having no clinical concern at subsequent 
assessment. 
 Out of the 11 patients with no clinical concern at initial assessment in Trial 3774, 1 patient changed 
to having a clinical concern at subsequent assessment. Out of 25 patients with no clinical concern at 
initial assessment in Trial 3895, 1 patient changed to having a clinical concern at subsequent 
assessment. These 2 patients had pre-existing contributing factors. 
 Out of the 11 patients with no clinical concern at initial assessment in Trial 3774, 1 patient changed 
to having a ‘might be’ clinical concern at subsequent assessment. Out of the 25 patients with no 
clinical concern at initial assessment in Trial 3895, 3 patients changed to having a ‘might be’ clinical

concern at subsequent assessment. Two (2) of these 4 patients did not have contributing factors; 
however, questionable attention at repeated measures and inconsistent battery findings were observed 
for these patients. 
Overall evaluation by Novo Nordisk of patients with clinical concern. 
In both trials, most patients with clinical concerns had significant contributing factors consistent with, 
and considered to explain, the neurocognitive findings. The main contributing factors were 
developmental delay, family history of neurological or neurocognitive disorders, head injury and 
premature birth. 
Approximately 40% of the younger patients with a clinical concern at initial assessment changed to 
having no clinical concern at subsequent assessment. These patients will not be discussed further. 
A small fraction of patients did not have a clinical concern at initial assessment but changed to having 
a ‘yes’ or ‘might be’ clinical concern during the trial: 
 In Trial 3774, 1 patient developed a clinical concern during the trial. The patient had multiple 
contributing factors including macrosomia at birth, participation in contact sports, head injury, pre-
existing attention problems and AE related to COVID-19 symptoms. 
 In Trial 3895, 1 patient developed a clinical concern during the trial. The patient had multiple 
contributing factors including pre-existing ICH, cerebral cyst and seizures and received antiseizure 
medication. 
 A total of 4 patient changed from having no clinical concern at initial assessment to a 'might be' 
clinical concern at subsequent assessment. The contributing factors reported for 2 of these patients 
were Tourette's syndrome or family history hereof, head injury/injuries, premature birth, and contact 
sports. For the remaining 2 patients, no contributing factors were reported, although one patient had 
initial parent-reported adaptive and language difficulties and the other patient had a head injury. Both 
patients had attention performance below clinical cut-off at latest assessments; one patient with 
questionable attention on repeated measures and the other patient with inconsistent batteries and 
mixed findings. Both patients had normal NEs, including normal language. 
In conclusion, patients with clinical concern were represented in all instruments, in all age groups and 
across the entire exposure scale, and no consistent trend was observed for patients with high exposure 
versus patients with low exposure. The categorisation of a 'clinical concern' in Trials 3774 and 3895 
was evaluated not to be related to nonacog beta pegol exposure. 
Key conclusions from the latest EERP report (EERP meeting 3): 
The latest EERP meeting (Meeting 3) was held on 13 January 2022 and 14 January 2022 during which 
data from trials 3774 and 3895 were reviewed with the data cut-off date of 15 October 2021. At this 
date, a total of 25 patients were screened and exposed to nonacog beta pegol for trial 3774 and 54 
patients were screened and exposed to nonacog beta pegol for trial 3895. The latest EERP report 
included available neurocognitive data for 16 patients for trial 3774 and 41 patients for trial 3895. 
Overall, the majority of patients evaluated were functioning within normal limits for age based on 
performance measures and rating scales at initial assessment. About half of the 15 patients identified 
at the initial visit to have clinical concerns were no longer identified as having clinical concerns by the 
most recent subsequent visit. The remaining patients continued to be identified as having a clinical 
concern, and more than half had contributing factors. While 3 patients did not have additional 
cognitive data at Meeting 3, the rest did and overall, the patterns were consistent, not worsening 
cognitive functioning in the areas the patients had initial deficits.

In summary, extensive evaluation of all safety data in the paediatric Trials 3774 and 3895 has not 
identified any safety issues related to PEG exposure: 
 No pattern of cognitive or behavioural performance was detected by an independent EERP of 
neuropsychologists and a neurologist who evaluated key neurodevelopmental, neurocognitive, 
neurological and neurobehavioral milestones in the two trials on an ongoing basis, both at trial level 
and at individual patient level. 
 No indications of any neurodevelopmental deficits caused by long-term exposure were found and 
patients in the paediatric Trials 7999-3774 and 7999-3895 had a performance comparable to a 
normative control group (eTHINK study). 
Taking the rareness of haemophilia B and the limited available paediatric patient population into 
account, a total 72 paediatric patients have been exposed to nonacog beta pegol for up to more than 8 
years which Novo Nordisk considers to be long-term exposure. Since December 2017 extensive safety 
measures and evaluations have been implemented to thoroughly evaluate and document potential 
effects of long-term exposure to nonacog beta pegol without identification of any safety issues related 
to PEG exposure in these paediatric patients. Further, the conclusion from the EERP meeting 3 is in line 
with the first 2 meetings or earlier reported data. 
The MAH provided the requested EERP meeting outcomes dating from March 2023, as well as the 
evaluation of the previous meeting from March 2022. The most recent evaluations are consistent with 
the previous EERP reports and no new safety concern has emerged. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies have been performed and no interactions of nonacog beta pegol with other 
medicinal products have been reported. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Adverse events leading to withdrawal 
Trials in PTPs 
Two (2) patients were withdrawn from the trials due to AEs (Table 49). One of the events was an 
allergic-type hypersensitivity reaction. The other case was a fatal event of hepatocellular carcinoma.

The child with medical history of haemophilia B has reported "Language delay (chronic condition)" after 
receiving the trial product for one and a half years. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of two-year-old 
children have language delay, and 4 to 5 percent remain delayed after three years. 
A large number of medical, and environmental conditions can cause or contribute to early language 
delays, particularly in the context of a more global developmental condition. 
This patient has also been diagnosed with a suspicion of ADHD that needs to be followed up. Language 
disorders are often present in children with ADHD. The patient has a brother diagnosed with autism. 
Based on the currently available information and prevalence in the background population, the sponsor 
evaluates the event to be unlikely related to the trial products and more likely to be related to ADHD 
and/or environmental factors.

Post marketing experience 
Estimated market exposure 
As of 31 May 2022, nonacog beta pegol with the trade name Refixia/Rebinyn has been approved 
worldwide for the treatment of haemophilia B in 44 countries (Table 51). 
Table 51 Countries with marketing approval for nonacog beta pegol and approved 
indications 
In the US, nonacog beta pegol (Rebinyn) was approved in 2017 by the FDA for use in adults and 
children with haemophilia B for on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes and for 
perioperative management of bleeding. More recently, nonacog beta pegol was authorised for 
prophylaxis treatment in patients of all age groups in the US on 29 July 2022. 
Novo Nordisk has released a total sales volume of 175,402,000 IU of nonacog beta pegol. This is the 
total volume of product distributed from Novo Nordisk to external customers (including samples) and 
does not necessarily reflect the actual use in patients. 
Considering that nonacog beta pegol is used for both treatment of bleeding and as prophylaxis, an 
estimated defined daily dose (DDD) for nonacog beta pegol could be calculated based on a once-
weekly prophylactic dose of 40 IU/kg in a 60 kg patient (a suggested average patient weight, reflective 
of treatment in children and adults), equal to a DDD of 343 IU/day. 
Based on these assumptions, the patient exposure for nonacog beta pegol is estimated as PYE using 
the formula: 
The estimated global market exposure based on this formula is shown in Table 52.

As part of post-approval pharmacovigilance activities, Novo Nordisk has monitored AEs from all 
available sources (spontaneous and solicited) including 
 spontaneously reported ARs 
 events from market research programmes and patient support programmes 
 AEs reported during the ongoing PASS 4031 (EU) and PMS Study 4404 (Japan). 
As of 31 May 2022, 251 AEs were reported from post-marketing sources and 51 of these were serious. 
AEs were most frequently reported within the SOCs Injury, poisoning and procedural complications 
(including 9 AEs of off-label use), General disorders and administration site conditions, Investigations 
and Nervous system disorders. In most of the cases, limited information was available, and it is not 
known whether a patient experiencing the event was a PTP or PUP. 
Analysis of adverse events by area of interest 
FIX inhibitors 
The NNMQ search of ‘antibody FIX’ identified 3 SAEs (Anti-FIX antibody increased and FIX inhibition) 
among the 251 AEs reported from post-marketing sources (Table 53). 
This does not change the understanding of the already known risk of FIX inhibition with nonacog beta 
pegol. 
Table 53 Adverse events from post-marketing sources related to antibodies based on NNMQ 
search of ‘antibody FIX’ 
Allergic/hypersensitivity reactions 
The narrow and broad NNMQ search ‘allergic reactions’ identified 3 SAEs (1 fatal respiratory failure, 1 
dyspnoea and 1 anaphylactic reaction) and 17 non-serious AEs among the 251 AEs reported from 
post-marketing sources (Table 54). A male patient in his eighties with haemophilia B and haematoma 
died from respiratory failure 1 week after receiving his last dose of nonacog beta pegol. No information 
was available on medical history, concomitant medication, clinical course of events leading to death, 
autopsy report and any other investigational findings, precluding complete medical assessment of the 
case.

Thromboembolic events 
The SMQ ‘thromboembolic events’ did not identify any events. 
Medication errors 
The SMQ ‘medication error’ (broad and narrow) identified 15 adverse events, all non-serious (Table 
55).

Injection site reactions 
The NNMQ ‘injection site reaction’ identified 10 AEs, all non-serious (Table 56). 
Table 56 Injection site reactions from post-marketing sources based on NNMQ search 
Rare events 
There were 7 non-serious AEs and 5 SAEs reported using NNMQ ‘rare events’ (broad and narrow) 
(Table 57). 
Table 57 Rare events from post-marketing sources based on NNMQ search 
Adverse events related to the theoretical safety concern of PEG 
Altogether, the SMQ searches ‘acute renal failure’ and ‘drug-related hepatic disorders’ and the NNMQ 
search ‘CNS events’ captured 3 SAEs (syncope, cerebral haemorrhage and dizziness) and 26 non-
serious AEs among the 251 AEs reported from post-marketing sources (Table 58). 
Headache (8 events), tremor (5 events), and dizziness (4 events) were the most frequently reported 
events, and all except one dizziness were non-serious. The remaining events were reported only once 
or twice, hence with no clustering of events. 
Novo Nordisk evaluates that these 29 AEs reported from post-marketing sources, with nonacog beta 
pegol as suspected product, are unlikely to be clinical consequences of long-term exposure to PEG 
based on the available evidence. For some of the events, patients had a medical or family history that 
point to alternative aetiologies, while other events are considered unlikely to be caused by long-term 
exposure to PEG due to insufficient exposure time. In some cases, the limited information precludes a 
full medical assessment.

EU PASS (Study 4031) 
Study 4031 is an ongoing non-interventional PASS conducted at the request of the EMA. The primary 
objective of the study is to investigate the safety of nonacog beta pegol in prophylaxis and during 
long-term routine use in patients with haemophilia B, see Study 4031 Protocol. This study was initiated 
in April 2019 and as of the interim 2 data cut-off date of 31 March 2022, 41 patients have completed 
Visit 1, 27 patients have completed Visit 2, 19 patients have completed Visit 3, 8 patients have 
completed Visit 4, 2 patients have completed Visit 5 and 1 patient had completed Visit 6 or Visit 7. No 
adverse drug reactions were reported during the study period and FIX inhibition, allergic reactions and 
thromboembolic events were not reported in any patients. 
No adverse drug reactions were reported during the study period and FIX inhibition, allergic reactions 
and thromboembolic events were not reported in any patients. 
A total of 13 AEs were reported in 7 patients; of which 3 AEs in 1 patient were non-treatment 
emergent. Two (2) AEs were serious (Gastric ulcer and Cholecystitis) and 1 AE was reported as an 
AESI (Headache). All events were mild or moderate except 1 treatment emergent AE which was 
reported as severe (Cholecystitis). Most events were reported as resolved, except 4 events of which 1 
event (treatment emergent) was reported as recovered with sequelae and the 1 event (1 treatment 
emergent) was reported as resolving. None of the events were considered related to nonacog beta 
pegol by the physician. 
The study includes a yearly NE comprising the following parameters: level of consciousness, cranial 
nerves, coordination and fine motor functioning, reflexes, sensory, gait, strength and tone. Twenty-
four (24) patients have had baseline NEs performed at Visit 1, and 3 patients have had a second NE at 
Visit 2. Three (3) additional patients had only had the NE at Visit. Four (4) patients had abnormal 
neurological findings at Visit 1. Of these 4 patients, 1 patient had abnormal neurological findings which 
continued to Visits 2, 3 and 4 and another patient had abnormal neurological findings which continued 
to Visits 2 and 3.

Overall, the use of nonacog beta pegol during routine clinical practice for treatment of bleeding 
episodes, routine prophylaxis and prevention of bleeding during surgery appears safe and effective and 
is consistent with the data provided with the application for the market authorisation. This conclusion 
is based on data from 41 patients enrolled in the study. The mean treatment period per patient was 1 
year (study 4031). 
Japan post-marketing surveillance study (Study 4404) 
Study 4404 is an ongoing non-interventional PMS study in Japan. The primary objective of the study is 
to assess the safety of nonacog beta pegol during long-term routine use in patients with haemophilia 
B. This study was initiated in August 2019, 26 patients had been enrolled in the study by 31 May 2022, 
and recruitment is ongoing. 
As of 31 May 2022, 12 AEs have been reported in this study, of which 5 were SAEs (osteomyelitis, fall, 
subcapsular renal haematoma, spinal compression fracture and appendicitis) (Table 59). No safety 
concerns were identified.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Nonacog beta pegol is licensed in the EU since 2017 for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in 
patients with haemophilia B aged 12 years and above.  
Due to non-clinical findings of PEG accumulation in certain tissues and ensuing concerns about the 
long-term safety of the PEG moiety, Refixia was not authorised in the whole paediatric population. In 
the submitted non-clinical studies with nonacog beta pegol, no treatment related vacuolation was 
observed. However, in non-clinical studies with PEG alone, cellular vacuolation due to accumulation of 
40 kDa PEG in certain tissues (choroid plexus of brain, macrophages in the interstitium of the choroid 
plexus, red pulp of the spleen and mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes) in monkeys and rats was 
observed at doses 200-500 fold higher (rats) or 200 fold higher (Cynomolgus monkey) than the PEG 
load resulting from the recommended clinical dose. Although no neurological symptoms (e.g., tremor) 
occurred in the clinical studies, the clinical trial programme was not prospectively designed to 
investigate possible clinical effects of PEG accumulation on the function of presumed main target 
organs and an accumulation of PEG with possible long-term consequences was expected to pose a 
conceivable risk. Potential unfavourable effects associated with the accumulation of PEG in the choroid 
plexus or other tissues or impairment of neural development likely would only become symptomatic 
after long-term exposure over several years, and clinical data was only available for a limited duration 
at the initial MA, with 48 patients having accrued ≥100 exposure days and 57 <100 EDs. 
To support the extension of the indication to children <12 years of age, the MAH has provided the 
following additional data: 
Trial 3774 ongoing extension phase – phase 3 trial in PTPs ≤12 years 
• 
• 
•  Study 4031 ongoing - global PASS in previously treated children, adolescents and adult 
Trial 3895 ongoing main and extension phases – phase 3 trial in PUP) <6 years 
patients 
•  Study 4404 ongoing - post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study in previously treated children, 
adolescents and adult patients in Japan. 
Apart from the new trials/studies/exposure included in this submission as described above, additional 
safety assessments have been performed. These safety assessments comprise the following: 
PEG plasma concentration (in Trials 3747, 3775, 3774 and 3895). 
• 
•  Neurological examination (NE) (in Trials 3774 and 3895). 
•  Neurocognitive assessments (NCAs) (in Trials 3774 and 3895). 
•  Collection of all CNS-related AEs and renal AEs as MESIs (in Trials 3774 and 3895) 
•  Determination of eGFR as a renal biomarker (in Trials 3774 and 3895). 
Exposure 
The MAH presented a comprehensive safety evaluation in PTPs for nonacog beta pegol which are 
considered supportive data.  
In PTP trial 3774, 13 subjects 7-12 years of age and 12 subjects 0-6 years of age were enrolled and 
subjects have now accrued up to 436 EDs representing up to 8 years of treatment.  
In PUP trial 3894, 50 subjects <6 years pf age were enrolled and subjects have now accrued up to 324 
EDs representing up to 6 years of treatment. The majority of subjects (62%) achieved > 100 EDs.  
Following request, the MAH clarified the number and demography of PUP subjects in study 3895 
starting “pre-prophylaxis” and prophylaxis, respectively. A substantial number of children <2 years of

age (i.e. n=17) was exposed to weekly prophylaxis, and in addition 34 subjects <1 year of age started 
with pre-prophylaxis, of whom 20 received prophylaxis with longer dosing intervals and not only on-
demand treatment of bleeds. Therefore, a meaningful amount of clinical data in PUPs < 2 years of age, 
who have in the meantime accrued years of exposure is available to support the safety and efficacy of 
nonacog beta pegol in the youngest age groups. 
Adverse Events 
AE incidence 
PTPs: The rate of AEs per patient year was 7.4 in children <6, 4.1 in children >6-12, 2.2 in 
adolescents and 2.7 in adults >18. The AE rate for children below 13 years of age was higher than in 
older PTPs in the PTs ‘Infections and infestations’ and ‘Injury, poisoning and procedural complications’. 
In children below 6 yoa, the AE rate for the PT ‘Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders’, driven 
by cough, was higher as the comparable rate in the older age cohorts. These differences reflect the 
higher incidence of infections and respiratory disease as well as accidents in younger children. 
PUPs: The AE rate in PUPs (5.21 AEs/ PYE) was comparable to that observed in PTPs <7 (7.4 AEs/ PYE) 
and PTPS <13 (4.1 AEs/ PYE). 
Severe AEs 
PTPs: The two severe AEs reported in one subject in the 0-<6 age group were viral upper respiratory 
tract infection and catheter site infection and were unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol as judged by 
the investigator, which is supported.  
The hypersensitivity reaction described as a severe AE and considered related to nonacog beta pegol 
happened in trial 3639 (the FIH trial) and is already reflected in the EPAR. 
PUPs: The 4 severe AEs assessed as possibly or probably related by the investigator were autism 
spectrum disorder in on patient, hypersensitivity in one patient and anaphylactic reaction and FIX 
inhibitor in one patient. 
Related AEs 
PTPs: In the age group 0-6 years, 2 AEs in one patient were assessed as related (abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea), and in the age group 6-12 years, 6 AES in 3 patients were considered related to nonacog 
beta pegol (infusion /injection site pain, headache, nausea, eosinophilia). 
The MAH was asked why the AEs of headache and eosinophilia, which were assessed as related, are 
not reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. The MAH has provided additional data and clarifications 
justifying that the abovementioned TEAEs are unlikely ADRs and therefore do not need to be reflected 
in the SmPC. This was agreed. 
PUPs: 10 subjects reported 20 AEs that were assessed as related by the investigator, the majority of 
these AEs were immune reactions and development of inhibitors. 
Most Frequently Reported AEs 
PTPs: Upon request, the MAH summarised the most frequent AEs (reported in >10% of patients and 
>5% of patients) for the age cohorts 0-<6, 6-<12, total <12. In line with the safety profile observed 
in all treated patients irrespective of age, the most frequently reported AEs were in the SOC of injury, 
poisoning and precedural complications as well as infections and infestations. 
PUPs: The most frequently reported AEs are in line with events expected in a young paediatric 
population, namely infections, pyrexia and accidents.

Serious adverse events 
Following request, the MAH provided data and narratives for all SAEs that occurred since the last 
database lock in Feb 2021 to the latest database lock in Oct 2022. 
PTPs: All SAEs in children < 12 were assessed as unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol by the 
investigator which can be supported concluding from the nature of the SAE and/or the narratives, 
respectively. The SAEs in children <12 yoa encompassed infections (viral gastroenteritis, viral upper 
respiratory infection, catheter site infection), food poisoning, radius fracture and Tourettes syndrome. 
The patient with Tourette syndrome was a 6y old boy enrolled in trial 3774. He started treatment with 
Refixia, displayed provisional and transient tics and was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome. The 
patient did not have any signs of ADHD, OCD or autism. The patient had tics and no other symptoms 
of Tourette. No family history of Tourette syndrome was described, however per his mother's 
statement, his mother's cousin also had tourette syndrome. The investigator and the sponsor both 
assessed the relationship to nonacog beta pegol as ‘unlikely’. This evaluation is accepted. 
PUPs: The related SAEs pertain to events of hypersensitivity and emergence of an inhibitor. Language 
disorder and ASD are also MESIs. 
Deaths 
One death was reported in a patient enrolled in the PUP trial 3895, which was caused by intracranial 
haemorrhages, which were likely aggravated due to the development of an inhibitor. The investigators 
assessment of relatedness of these 2 AEs (ICH- not related, inhibitor – possibly related) is accepted. In 
addition, since the latest cut-off, one death due to an ICH was reported In PUP trial 3895. The patient 
was a 19 month old male who received preprophylaxis. The last nonacog beta pegol infusions was 
given 8 months before the intracranial bleed. No relationship to Refixia is likely. 
MESI 
Following request, the MAH provided data and narratives for all MESIs that occurred since the last 
database lock in Feb 2021 to the latest database lock in Oct 2022. 
Very few renal AEs were reported in the clinical investigation programme and no safety issue arises 
from the renal AE profile.  
The eGFR values in studies 3774 and 3895 do not give rise to concern. Similarly, no safety issues arise 
from the evaluation of the observed hepatic adverse events. 
The MAH could observe no correlation between number of exposure days, PEG plasma levels and 
incidence of CNS-related adverse events. Taking into account the influence of genetic predispositions 
as well as consequences of intracerebral bleeds and head trauma on neurocognitive and neurological 
findings, a facilitating effect of PEG exposure was not evident. The incidence of some NCA and NE 
findings after a small number of exposure days and the improvement of such AEs during ongoing 
treatment do not point to PEG as a factor of relevant influence on CNS-related adverse events.  
For reference, of the subjects enrolled into the e-THINK study who have never been exposed to a 
pegylated coagulation factor, a total of 71 (13.9%) were diagnosed with ADHD and 15 (2.9%) patients 
were diagnosed with ASD. Neurodevelopmental disorders were reported in 2.7%, tics were reported in 
4.1% and headaches were reported in 14.7% of the total population. 
Immunogenicity 
The observed incidence of inhibitors in PUPs is in line with recent literature reports of the inhibitor 
incidence in patients with severe haemophilia B (Male et al; Haematologica 2021, 106(1):123-129). 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 120/138 
 
 
 
 
 
For three patients, information on the kind of F9 mutation was available, and all three displayed a 
nonsense mutation which confers a high inhibitor risk. 
One subject in study 3774 developed anti-nonacog beta pegol antibodies without inhibitory effect. The 
patient tested negative for these antibodies at later visits and is continuing in the trial. One paediatric 
subjects from trial 3774 tested positive for anti-CHO antibodies at the end of the main phase and 
negative at subsequent visits.  
In PUPs, anti-nonacog beta pegol antibodies arose simultaneously with FIX inhibitors in 4 patients, 
while the three other subject with such antibodies were only transiently positive or already positive 
before exposure to Refixia. Several patients were positive for anti-CHO antibodies, but without clinical 
consequences.  
No specific concern arises with regard to immunogenicity in paediatric PUPs and PTPs. 
PEG plasma levels 
The measurable PEG plasma concentration reached a ceiling value after approximately 20 -30 weeks 
treatment with nonacog beta pegol. Mean values are comparable between PUPs and PTPs, with the 
older age cohort displaying slightly higher levels. 
The clinical significance of these values is unknown at present, however, PEG levels were not 
correlated with CNS-related AEs. 
Neurological, neurocognitive and neurobehavioural evaluation 
Both clinical trial protocols were amended in order to investigate potentially PEG-related AEs of special 
interest (i.e. renal, hepatic and CNS-related adverse events), to evaluate PEG plasma levels and to 
examine a potential influence of the PEG moiety on neurological, neurocognitive and neurobehavioural 
development. In order to provide a relevant reference dataset, the eThink study enrolled 551 males 
below 22 years of age with any severity of haemophilia A and B and investigated neurologic, 
neurocognitive and neurobehavioural function using age appropriate, validated testing systems. This 
dataset is considered to provide a more appropriate comparison option than data derived from healthy 
children without haemophilia, as disease specific comorbidities like sequelae of bleeding events (e.g. 
intracranial bleedings, target joints, ...) are reflected in both datasets and hence a confounding effect 
of these occurrences on neurological or neurocognitive function is more likely to be avoided. 
The neurologic examinations were performed by physicians, while the neurocognitive and 
neurobehavioural assessment was conducted by licensed psychologists or neuropsychologists with 
expertise in neuropsychology and/or child assessment. A comprehensive battery of assessments were 
used, e.g. the Bayley Scales Of Infant and Toddler Development or the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of 
Intelligence. Identical assessments were then employed to investigate neurologic, neurocognitive and 
neurobehavioural parameters in the subjects of PTP study 3774 and PUP study 3895. An EERP 
evaluated key neurodevelopmental, neurocognitive, neurological and neurobehavioral milestones in 
Trials 3895 and 3774 on individual level and on trial level. The EERP consisted of neuropsychologists, a 
paediatric neurologist and a haematologist. 
Neurological and neurocognitive assessment of paediatric subjects exposed for several years to 
nonacog beta pegol did not reveal a trend towards specific neurological or neurocognitive effects. 
Subjects in study 3774 accrued up tp 400 ED, and subjects in trial 3895 accrued up to 300 ED, , which 
is 6-8 times more than the 50 EDs required by the FIX guidance (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009 rev. 
2 Corr. 1). 
Clinical concerns observed at baseline resolved during treatment with nonacog beta pegol, and while 
several concerns were newly observed throughout the treatment phase, there was no clustering of

Page 121/138 
 
 
 
 
symptoms and some of those concerns were mitigated or resolved at a later point in time without 
change to the prophylactic treatment regimen, thus rendering the influence of PEG on the observed 
events as unlikely. 
Post-marketing data 
Most patients using Refixia in the post-marketing setting were PTPs > 12 years. Post-marketing 
reports of the use of nonacog beta pegol in clinical practice do not raise additional safety concerns. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The MAH has submitted a comprehensive dossier investigating the safety of long-term treatment with 
nonacog beta pegol on paediatric PTPs and PUPs. Exposures up to 8 years for PTPs and up to 6 years 
for PUPs were achieved during the extension phases of the two relevant trials, 3774 in 25 PTPs and 
3895 in 50 PUPs. 
The observed adverse event profile was consistent with that observed in the already authorised 
population of adolescents and adults 12 years of age and older, with a higher incidence of infections 
and injuries as usually observed in a young paediatric population. 
A comprehensive investigation of neurological, neurocognitive and neurobehavioural parameters of 
both PTP and PUP subjects 0-12 years old did not reveal a relevant influence of PEG on neurological 
development and function during long-term treatment with nonacog beta pegol. 
In conclusion, the safety profile in paediatric subjects < 12 years of age did not differ in a relevant 
manner from that observed in older subjects treated with nonacog beta pegol. The number of exposed 
paediatric subjects surpasses guideline requirements and can be considered ample taking into account 
the rarity of the disease. The duration of exposure is exceptional and allows the assessment of the 
long-term safety profile, which appears benign. A substantial number of children <2 years of age (i.e. 
n=17) was exposed to weekly prophylaxis, and in addition 34 subjects <1 year of age started with 
pre-prophylaxis, of whom 20 received prophylaxis with longer dosing intervals and not only on-
demand treatment of bleeds. Therefore, a meaningful amount of clinical data in PUPs < 2 years of age, 
who have in the meantime accrued years of exposure, is available to support the safety and efficacy of 
nonacog beta pegol in the youngest age groups. 
The extension of indication to children below 12 years of age is approvable from a safety perspective. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indication(s). 
The proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the 
risks of the product. 
The studies in the post-authorisation development plan are sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of 
the risk minimisation measures.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia B is an X-linked recessive congenital bleeding disorder, caused by mutations in the genes 
encoding coagulation factor IX (FIX), with an incidence of approximately one in every 25,000 male 
births. 
Haemophilia B is often categorised according to residual FIX activity level. Patients with severe 
haemophilia B (FIX activity <1%) experience bleeds, particularly into joints and muscles, often without 
any apparent reason (spontaneous bleeds). In contrast, patients with mild haemophilia B (FIX activity 
of 5% to 40%) rarely experience spontaneous bleeds and bleeding in these patients is often caused by 
trauma or surgery. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) recommend prophylaxis as the optimal therapy for patients 
with severe haemophilia and that patients begin prophylaxis prior to the onset of joint disease and 
ideally before 3 years of age. The most conservative Nordic Haemophilia Guidelines recommend 
starting prophylactic treatment at the age of 1 year before joint bleedings occur. 
Current replacement therapy includes plasma-derived (pdFIX) as well as recombinant FIX (rFIX) 
products. These products are indicated for both the prophylactic and acute treatment of bleeding 
episodes, including bleeding in the perioperative setting. Half-life of both pdFIX and rFIX is ~18 hours. 
Prophylactic treatment with those products is usually required 2 to 3 times a week in order to achieve 
a significant reduction of bleeding episodes. Several years ago, FIX products with a prolonged half-life 
have been licensed, which can be given once per week or even less often. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence supporting the extension of indication in children (˂12 years of age) with 
haemophilia B is based on the data from PTP trial 3774 and PUP trial 3895. 25 paediatric PTPs (1-
12 years old) were enrolled in trial 3774 and 50 paediatric PUPs (0-5 years old) were enrolled in trial 
3895. PTPs received routine prophylaxis treatment of nonacog beta pegol 40 IU/kg once weekly, and 
PUPs could either enrol directly into prophylaxis at the same dose as PTPs or they could enter a pre-
prophylaxis phase where they received nonacog beta pegol on demand or at intervals longer than once 
weekly. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Mean steady state Factor IX trough levels, as estimated from pre-dose samples during prophylaxis 
with 40 IU/kg, were stable for up to 450 weeks after treatment initiation and within the range of mild 
haemophilia between 0.05 and 0.4 IU/mL (0.146 IU/mL and 0.195 IU/mL for patients 0-6 years and 7-
12 years old, respectively). Similarly stable long-term steady state levels were also demonstrated for 
PUPs ≤6 years with an estimated mean of 0.156 IU/mL. Levels commonly achieved with unmodified FIX 
products are in the range of 0.01-0.03 IU/mL

The poisson-estimated ABRs were 1.02 (95%CI: 0.68; 1.54) and 0.84 (95%CI: 0.41; 1.75) in children 
≤6 years and 7-12 years (median ABR 0.55 and 0.52), respectively, (data include up to 8 years of 
prophylaxis treatment). In PUPs ≤6 years the median ABR was 0.25 and the poisson-estimated ABR 
was 0.65 (95%CI: 0.34; 1.25). In support of the reported bleeding rate, a high proportion of subjects 
did not experience bleeding episodes during prophylaxis treatment (41.7% in PTPs ≤6 years, 30.4% in 
PTPs 7-12 years and 46.8% in PUPs ≤6 years throughout main and extension phases of trials 3774 and 
3895).   
Bleeding episodes were largely controlled by a single injection (82.9% for PTPs ≤6 years and 84.1% for 
PTPs 7-12 years) and the treatment response was mostly rated as good or excellent (88% and 93% 
for children ≤6 years and 7-12 years, respectively). Similarly, in PUPs 91.9% of breakthrough bleeds 
during prophylaxis treatment were treated with a single injection and 96.1% were rated as treatment 
success (i.e. good or excellent response). The median amount needed to treat a bleeding episode was 
around 43 IU/kg (42.2 IU/kg in PTPs ≤6 years, 43.2 IU/kg in PTPs 7-12 years and 44.2 IU/kg in PUPs ≤
6 years).No target joint developed throughout the rather long observation period of both trials in PUPs 
and PTPs, whereas two pre-existing target joints in PTPs resolved. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The haemostatic response evaluation for minor surgeries was not reported in trials 3774 (in PTPs ≤12 
years) and 3895 (in PUPs ≤6 years). However major surgeries were conducted in two paediatric 
patients (one PTP and one PUP). The number of patient is small but excellent haemostatic response 
was reported for the treatment with 80 IU/kg. 
No severe bleedings occurred in paediatric PTPs, which is a favourable outcome regarding prophylactic 
dosing, but leaves uncertainty regarding the recommended dosing (i.e. 80 IU/kg). Of the 7 severe 
bleeds that occurred in PUPs, 3 were successfully treated, 1 was rated as treatment failure and 3 were 
also treated with other Factor IX products or bypassing agents, which hampers interpretation of the 
response to nonacog beta pegol. 
It is noted that all subjects included in trials 3774 and 3895 had severe (factor IX level <1%) or 
moderately severe (factor IX level ≤2%) haemophilia B. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Adverse Events 
The observed adverse event profile in children below 12 years was comparable to that already shown 
in adolescents and adults, a higher AE rate was driven by infections and injuries, as can be expected 
for a young paediatric population. The AE profiles in PTPS and PUPs were similar. 
Related Adverse Events 
PTPs: In the age group 0-6 years, 2 AEs in one patient were assessed as related (abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea), and in the age group 6-12 years, 6 AES in 3 patients were considered related to nonacog 
beta pegol (infusion /injection site pain, headache, nausea, eosinophilia). 
PUPs: 10 subjects reported 20 AEs that were assessed as related by the investigator, the majority of 
these AEs were immune reactions and development of inhibitors.

Deaths 
One death was reported in a patient enrolled in the PUP trial 3895, which was caused by intracranial 
haemorrhages, which were likely aggravated due to the development of an inhibitor. In addition, since 
the latest cut-off, one death due to an ICH was reported in PUP trial 3895. The patient was a young 
child who received preprophylaxis. The last nonacog beta pegol infusions was given 8 months before 
the intracranial bleed. No relationship to Refixia is likely.   
The evaluation of immunogenicity and Medical Events of Special Interest (renal, hepatic, CNS-related 
AEs) did not reveal a safety signal.  
Neurological, neurocognitive and neurobehavioural evaluation 
Both clinical trial protocols were amended in order to investigate potentially PEG-related AEs of special 
interest (i.e. renal, hepatic and CNS-related adverse events), to evaluate PEG plasma levels and to 
examine a potential influence of the PEG moiety on neurological, neurocognitive and neurobehavioural 
development. In order to provide a relevant reference dataset, the eThink study enrolled 551 males 
below 22 years of age with haemophilia A and B and investigated neurologic, neurocognitive and 
neurobehavioural function using age appropriate, validated testing systems. The neurologic 
examinations were performed by physicians, while the neurocognitive and neurobehavioural 
assessment was conducted by licensed psychologists or neuropsychologists with expertise in 
neuropsychology and/or child assessment. A comprehensive battery of assessments were used, e.g. 
the Bayley Scales Of Infant and Toddler Development or the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of 
Intelligence. Identical assessments were then employed to investigate neurologic, neurocognitive and 
neurobehavioural parameters in the subjects of PTP study 3774 and PUP study 3895. An External 
Expert Review Panel evaluated key neurodevelopmental, neurocognitive, neurological and 
neurobehavioral milestones in Trials 3895 and 3774 on individual level and on trial level. The EERP 
consisted of neuropsychologists, a paediatric neurologist and a haematologist. 
Neurological and neurocognitive assessment of paediatric subjects exposed for several years to 
nonacog beta pegol did not reveal a trend towards specific neurological or neurocognitive effects. 
Subjects in study 3774 accrued up to 400 ED, and subjects in trial 3895 accrued up to 300 ED, which 
translates into 8 and 6 years of treatment with nonacog beta pegol, respectively. 
Clinical concerns observed at baseline resolved during treatment with nonacog beta pegol, and while 
several concerns were newly observed throughout the treatment phase, there was no clustering of 
symptoms and some of those concerns were mitigated or resolved at a later point in time without 
change to the prophylactic treatment regimen. This renders an influence of PEG on the observed 
events as unlikely. 
Post-marketing data 
Post-marketing reports of the use of nonacog beta pegol in clinical practice do not raise additional 
safety concerns. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The number of exposed paediatric subjects is numerically small but surpasses FIX guideline 
requirements and can be considered ample taking into account the rarity of the disease. The duration 
of exposure is very long for a FIX clinical investigation programme and allows the assessment of the 
long-term safety profile. 
The MAH has extensively investigated pathways by which PEG metabolism could influence clinical 
outcomes, i.e. renal, hepatic and CNS-related adverse events. Furthermore, comprehensive 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 132/138 
 
 
 
 
neurological, neurocognitive and neurobehavioural assessment consecutively over several years in all 
exposed PTPs and PUPs <12 years of age did not reveal appreciable differences to the paediatric 
haemophilia population of the eTHINK study, who was never exposed to a pegylated coagulation 
factor. 
To supplement the clinical outcomes with results of tissue and CSF analyses, a juvenile animal 
neurotoxicity study was conducted to evaluate the potential neurotoxicity of nonacog beta pegol and 
especially the PEG moiety after i.v. administration of 120-1200 IU/kg/twice weekly (corresponding to a 
1-10-fold clinical PEG plasma exposure) to juvenile male rats from D21 to D91, followed by a 13-week 
recovery period. As expected, PEG was found widely distributed to various tissues in a dose- and time-
dependent manner, including choroid plexus and neuronal structures. However, alterations on 
neurobehavioral and neurocognitive development or other neuropathological changes were not 
observed in juvenile animals. PEG was below LLOQ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at all time points 
tested and IHC stainings confirmed that PEG was not passing the blood-brain barrier in nonacog beta 
pegol treated animals. Vacuole formation in the choroid plexus, a common uncertainty previously 
associated with PEG exposure, was observed in both, the treatment as well as control animals at 
similar levels, thus neither considered adverse nor treatment-related. Thus, as already shown in adult 
rats and monkey in the original MA, no PEG related vacuolation was observed in the juvenile rats’ 
choroid plexus. 
No new data on PEG alone treatment, which was shown to induce cellular vacuolation due to 
accumulation of 40 kDa PEG in certain tissues (including choroid plexus of brain, macrophages in the 
interstitium of the choroid plexus, red pulp of the spleen and mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes) 
in adult monkeys and rats in the original MA, were submitted. However, these findings were observed 
at doses 200-500 fold higher than the PEG levels resulting from the recommended clinical dose, 
without any adverse (neurological) effects observed in these animals. Although the human relevance of 
PEG alone treatment at such high supraclinical exposure levels is questionable, it was concluded that 
due to the uncertainties around this issue and missing data in juvenile animals and children, use of 
nonacog beta pegol in the paediatric population at all ages, was not conceivable at that time. 
The data submitted in juvenile animals treated with nonacog beta pegol revealed only slight 
accumulation in macrophages in the pituitary gland, which was considered to represent a normal 
physiological processing of foreign material in that cell type. However, at PEG exposure levels showing 
acceptable safety margins compared to clinical dosing, no other adverse findings were observed that 
would indicate an increased risk of PEG accumulation in juvenile rats. To note, the nonclinical studies 
provided do not allow a definite conclusion to be drawn on the risk for children aged less than 2 years 
since the juvenile studies provided do not cover this period (rats treated from 3 to 13 weeks of age 
corresponding to 2 to 16 years of age in humans). However, 41 PUPs <2 and 3 PTPs <2 years were 
exposed to (pre-) prophylaxis with nonacoga beta pegol, the precise duration and dose of exposure are 
requested to be clarified by the MAH. 
A dedicated animal model to investigate long-term consequences of potential PEG accumulation in 
(juvenile) animals is still not available, however the provided nonclinical data in juvenile rats focussing 
on neurologic development appears reassuring and supports the newly provided clinical data in the 
target population, which obviously constitutes the most important increase in knowledge, compared to 
the original MA.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Favourable and stable Factor IX levels for a long treatment duration (i.e. within the range of mild 
haemophilia for up to 450 weeks) were further substantiated by low bleeding rates in paediatric 
patients. Thus, it is concluded that the proposed treatment with 40 IU/kg provides an efficacious 
prophylaxis option for paediatric haemophilia B patients (PTPs and PUPs). Furthermore, breakthrough 
bleeding events required mostly only a single injection in order to achieve good or excellent treatment 
response. 
The observed safety profile in children below 12 years of age was comparable to the safety profile 
already established in adolescents and adults. The long-term safety profile in children (up to 8 years 
exposure in PTPs and up to 6 years in PUPs) did not reveal any unusual safety signals. A 
comprehensive neurological, neurocognitive and neurobehavioural assessment in PTP trial 3774 and 
PUP trial 3895 demonstrated neurological function and development parameters comparable to the 
dataset provided by the 551 haemophiliac subjects of the eThink study, who had never been exposed 
to a pegylated coagulation factor. Furthermore, renal and hepatic parameters did not suggest a 
detrimental effect caused by long-term PEG exposure. Overall, comprehensive investigations of 
potential risks associated with PEG exposure were done, even exceeding recommendations given in 
previous SA. Postmarketing data, although mainly derived in PTPs ≥12 years of age, do not give rise 
to concern with regards to potential PEG-related adverse events.  
Clinical data are supported by outcomes from a juvenile animal neurotoxicity study in male rats, where 
exposure to nonacog beta pegol with a safety margin of corresponding to 1-10 times the clinical PEG 
plasma exposure did not lead to adverse events, including signs of neurotoxic or adverse 
neurobehavioral development. The newly provided nonclinical data on PEG exposure in juvenile 
animals together with the nonclinical data of the original MA thus support treatment with nonacog beta 
pegol in all age groups from a nonclinical perspective. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The beneficial effects of prophylaxis and treatment with nonacog beta pegol in children < 12 years of 
age pertain to a low annualised bleeding rate preserved over several years of prophylaxis achieved 
with a once weekly infusion interval. The trough levels both in PTPs as well as in PUPs show values 
consistent with the category of mild haemophilia, which is likely to translate into a protective effect 
against spontaneous bleeding events and the development of target joints. This assumption is 
supported by the development of zero target joints in PUPs and the resolution of two pre-existing 
target joints in PTPs with no new target joints observed throughout the whole study period (up to 8 
and 6 years in PTPs and PUPs, respectively). The haemostatic efficacy was demonstrated in the 
treatment of bleeds and was satisfactory after one infusion in the vast majority of BEs. 
The long-term safety profile was benign with no new safety signals compared to the safety profile in 
adolescents and adults. The rate of inhibitor development in PUPs was consistent with such rates 
reported in the literature. Comprehensive neurological, neurocognitive and neurobehavioural 
assessments throughout both studies did not reveal a noticeable influence of nonacog beta pegol on 
neurological function and development. 
In conclusion, the demonstrated beneficial effects of treatment with nonacog beta pegol with regard to 
sustained low ABRs and trough levels in the range of mild haemophilia at a once weekly infusion 
interval as well as a satisfactory haemostatic efficacy combined with a benign long-term safety profile, 
Assessment report  
EMA/319611/2023 
Page 136/138 
 
 
 
 
new long-term data that were collected prospectively and specifically investigating potential PEG-
related effects together with additional nonclinical data support the use in both paediatric PTPs below 
12 years as well as in PUPs. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Refixia for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B 
(congenital factor IX deficiency) is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change:

Extension of indication to include treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in children below 12 years of 
age with haemophilia B including previously untreated patients for Refixia based on results from 
studies NN7999-3774 and NN7999-3895. NN7999-3774 is a multicentre, open-label, non-controlled 
study evaluating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of nonacog beta pegol in previously treated 
children with haemophilia B, while NN7999-3895 is a multicentre, open-label, single-arm, non-
controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of nonacog beta pegol in previously untreated 
patients with haemophilia B. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Version 5.2 of the RMP has also been 
submitted. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0139/2019 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1. 
Introduction 
Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most frequent cancers in the world, affects one person in 20 in the 
developed countries, being the second most common malignant disease with 700,000 new cases and 
500,000 deaths  world  wide  each  year.  Primary  therapy  is  surgery  with  75%  of  the  patients  being 
operable  at  the  time  of  diagnosis.  However,  even  when  resection  is  considered  curative,  the  overall 
five-year survival is only 50%. Approximately, 30% of all patients with CRC have metastatic disease 
at diagnosis. Five-year survival is 78% in stage II, 54% in stage III and only 5% in stage IV. Survival 
in  stage  III  patients  has  been  shown  to  be  increased  by  application  of  adjuvant  chemotherapy  with 
5-fluorouracil, folic acid. Current state-of-the-art therapies for metastatic disease approved in Europe 
include  irinotecan  and/or  oxaliplatin,  each  in  combination  with  bolus  or  infusional  5-fluorouracil, 
leucovorin. 
More recently, 2 monoclonal antibodies have been approved in EU for colorectal cancer treatment. On 
one hand, bevacizumab which acts as a signal transduction inhibitor of Vascular Endothelial Growth 
Factor (VEGF) is approved as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with 
5- fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. On the other hand, cetuximab which act as a signal transduction 
inhibitor  of  EGFR  is  approved  for  use  in  combination  with  irinotecan  in  patients  with  EGFR 
expressing metastatic colorectal cancer who has failed prior irinotecan therapy. 
Patients treated with chemotherapy and monoclonal antibodies tend to progress after a certain time and 
their only treatment option is best supportive care. 
Panitumumab is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that is directed against the human EGFR. 
The  EGFR  is  a  transmembrane  glycoprotein  that  promotes  cell  growth  in  a  variety  of  normal  and 
transformed tissues. The receptor has several natural ligands including EGF and transforming growth 
factor-alpha.  Binding  of  the  ligand  to  the  receptor  stimulates  cell  proliferation.  Blocking  this 
interaction by means of a monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor inhibits tumour growth in 
vivo.  Panitumumab  is  produced  in  a  proprietary  strain  of  mouse  (XenoMouse)  in  which  the  murine 
heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes were inactivated and most of the human heavy and light 
chain (both kappa and lambda) immunoglobulin genes were inserted. 
Amgen Europe B.V. has applied for a marketing authorisation through the centralised procedure for 
Vectibix 20 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion in the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the 
colon or rectum after failure of oxaliplatin- and/or irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens. The 
recommended  dose  of  panitumumab  is  6 mg/kg  of  body  weight  given  once  every  14  days  as  an 
intravenous infusion.

Description of the active substance 
Panitumumab is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody of IgG2 subclass. Panitumumab has two 
gamma  heavy  chains  and  two  kappa  light  chains.  Glycosylated  panitumumab  has  a  total  molecular 
weight  of  approximately  147  kDa.  Panitumumab  is  expressed  as  a  glycoprotein  with  a  single 
consensus  N-linked  glycosylation  site  located  on  the  heavy  chain.  Panitumumab  is  produced  in 
genetically engineered mammalian (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells. 
•  Manufacture 
The  active  substance  is  manufactured  at  Amgen,  Fremont,  California,  USA.  This  facility  was 
inspected by the Dutch inspectorate (IGZ) and it is considered that this site is operated in accordance 
to current EU Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), with standard operating procedures in place to 
describe all procedures and controls. 
Development genetics 
The expression plasmid containing the genes for the heavy and light chains was transfected into CHO 
cells. Following cloning and subcloning steps, one clone producing panitumumab at high levels was 
selected as lead cell line. 
Cell bank system 
A  two-tiered  cell  banking  system  of  Master  Cell  bank  (MCB)  and  Working  Cell  Bank  (WCB)  has 
been developed and maintained in accordance to cGMP and ICH guidelines. 
Procedures  followed  in  the  preparation  of  MCB  and  WCB  have  been  appropriately  described.  An 
extensive  range  of  tests  has  been  performed  for  their  characterisation,  in  accordance  with  ICH 
guidelines,  including  identity,  viability,  stability,  presence  of  adventitious  agents  (bacteria,  fungi, 
mycoplasma, viral contaminants including endogenous retrovirus-like particles known to be present in 
CHO cell lines). 
Fermentation process 
One  vial  of  WCB  is  thawed  and  cells  are  expanded  in  a  selective  serum-free  growth  medium  to 
generate the cell inoculum. A series of bioreactors with increasing volumes is then used to expand the 
cell  mass  to  generate  sufficient  cells  for  the  inoculation  of  the  production  bioreactor.  Following  the 
production  phase,  the  bioreactor  contents  are  harvested  and  clarified  to  generate  a  cell-free 
intermediate designated as harvested cell culture fluid. 
Panitumumab  cell  culture  conditions  and  in-process  controls  (IPC)  have  been  sufficiently  described 
and are considered appropriate. 
Purification process 
Panitumumab  is  purified  using  a  series  of  chromatography,  concentration  and  diafiltration  and  viral 
inactivation and filtration steps. 
Each step of the purification process has been adequately described, and suitable IPC controls are in 
place, with acceptable limits.

Manufacturing process development and process validation 
Several  manufacturing  changes  were  introduced  during  development,  including  change  of  cell  line, 
scale-up  of  the  fermentation  process,  various  changes  to  the  purification  process  and  change  of 
manufacturing site. 
The  comparability  exercise  and  the  overall  data  provided  to  support  the  different  changes  were 
considered acceptable. 
The  commercial  manufacturing  process  was  validated  in  order  to  demonstrate  that  the  process 
consistently  maintained  process  parameters  within  specified  ranges  and  met  pre-established 
acceptance criteria for performance indicators. Overall, process validation was considered satisfactory. 
Characterisation 
A) Elucidation of structure and other characteristics: 
A1) Physicochemical characterisation: 
The primary, secondary and tertiary structures of panitumumab were analysed by various techniques. 
Several  structural  complexes  resulting  from  different  organisations  of  the  disulfide  bridges  in  the 
hinge region on the antibody were identified. These complexes were adequately analysed. 
Several  charge  variants  were  identified,  which  all  exhibit  comparable  potency  to  the  reference 
standard. 
Characterisation  of  glycosylation  indicated  that  panitumumab  has  a  single  consensus  N-linked 
glycosylation site located on the heavy chain. The predominant glycan structures observed correspond 
to complex bi-antennary structures terminating with or without galactose residues. Fucosylated forms 
have also been observed. No O-linked glycosylation was detected. 
The size distribution of panitumumab was appropriately evaluated by different techniques. 
Free sulfhydryl content was consistently detected, indicating low levels of unpaired cysteine residues 
that are not assigned. 
The  active  substance  has  been  comprehensively  characterised,  using  state-of-the-art  methods  for 
physicochemical  characteristics.  Sources  of  heterogeneity  have  been  analysed  in  detail  using  a  wide 
variety of state-of-the-art techniques. 
A2) Biological characterisation: 
The  methods  used  for  the  evaluation  of  the  biological  activity  were  based  on  the  ability  of 
panitumumab  to  bind  directly  to  the  extracellular  domain  of  EGFR  and  inhibit  ligand  binding  and 
subsequent cellular responses. 
The biological properties of panitumumab have been properly characterised and the assays that were 
chosen and the data provided are considered adequate. 
B) Impurities: 
The  potential  product-related  impurities  identified  are  aggregates,  fragments  and  other  product 
variants.  Potential  process-related  impurities  include  cell  substrate  derived  impurities  (host  cell 
proteins, DNA), cell culture derived and downstream derived impurities. 
Overall, impurities have been properly identified and characterised. 
Specifications 
The active substance release specifications have been suitably justified and are supported by consistent 
data from multiple lots.

Stability 
The  design  of  the  stability  programme,  including  the  testing  intervals  and  temperature  storage 
conditions, are in accordance with current ICH guidelines. The tests chosen are a subset of tests from 
the release specifications selected for stability-indicating properties. 
The  stability  data  provided  were  within  the  specifications  and  support  a  shelf  life  of  24  months 
at 2-8°C. 
Finished Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Sodium chloride is used in the formulation to provide an isotonic solution for intravenous infusion and 
is used as a stabiliser against thermally induced aggregation. Acetic acid is used to adjust pH to target 
of  5.8.  Water  for  injection  is  also  used  as  solvent  in  the  formulation.  There  are  no  overages  in  the 
formulation. 
Panitumumab  finished  product  is  diluted  in  0.9%  sodium  chloride  and  administered  via  an  infusion 
pump,  using  an  0.2 µm  in-line  filter  to  reduce  sub-visible  particles,  through  a  peripheral  line  or 
indwelling  catheter.  Data  provided  demonstrated  that  this  in-line  filter  is  effective  at  removing 
panitumumab particulates to levels below Ph. Eur. limits without any impact on protein concentration. 
The proposed container for panitumumab finished product is a single-use vial (type I glass) with an 
elastomeric  stopper,  aluminium  seal  and  a  plastic  flip-off  cap.  One  vial  contains  100 mg  of 
panitumumab  in  5 ml,  200 mg  panitumumab  in  10 ml,  or  400 mg  panitumumab  in  20 ml  of 
concentrate for solution for infusion. 
Adventitious agents 
An  assessment  performed  on  all  materials  used  for  the  panitumumab  commercial  manufacturing 
process  concluded  that  the  risk  for  TSE  associated  with  any  material  of  animal  origin  is  negligible. 
The active substance is produced in a serum-free culture medium. 
The  applicant  has  demonstrated  that  the  cell  banks  are  free  of  detectable  viruses  except  for  the 
presence  of  retroviral  particles  known  to  be  present  in  CHO  cell  lines.  Routine  testing  of  the 
unprocessed bulk is performed as part of the viral safety programme. 
The viral clearance studies presented by the applicant demonstrate that the panitumumab purification 
process provides sufficient clearance of the model viruses. 
Manufacture of the product 
The finished product is manufactured by a facility that was inspected by the Dutch inspectorate (IGZ) 
and  it  is  considered  that  this  site  is  operated  in  accordance  to  current  EU  Good  Manufacturing 
Practices (GMP). 
The  finished  product  manufacturing  process  consists  of  a  formulation  step  followed  by  aseptic 
filtration, using two 0.2 µm filters, aseptic filling into vials, stoppering and capping steps. 
Criteria for re-filtration of formulated bulk have been established and justified. 
The media fill and process validation results, lot-to-lot consistency data and critical process controls 
have shown that the sterile filtration and aseptic filling process are robust and well controlled and that 
the finished product can be consistently manufactured. 
Specifications 
The control of finished product relies to a large extent on the same analytical methods as those used 
for  the  control  of  the  active  substance.  The  tests  and  rationale  for  the  acceptance  criteria  for  the 
finished product were considered acceptable.

protocol to monitor the time-temperature stability of cGMP lots of finished product. Based on the data 
provided, the approvable shelf life for the finished product is 24 months at 2-8°C. 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In general, the different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with existing guidelines. 
Information on the source and generation of the cell substrate and analysis of the expression construct 
are considered satisfactory. 
Master and working cell banks have been established and adequately described and characterised. 
The  active  substance  manufacturing  process  is  well  defined  and  adequately  controlled,  with 
appropriate in-process controls and acceptance criteria in place. 
The  comparability  exercise  to  support  the  different  manufacturing  changes  during  development  was 
considered acceptable. 
The  active  substance  has  been  well  characterised.  Sources  of  heterogeneity  have  been  assessed  in 
detail using a wide variety of state-of-the-art techniques. 
The active substance release specifications have been suitably justified and are supported by consistent 
data from multiple lots.  
The  stability  data  provided  support  the  proposed  active  substance  and  finished  product  shelf  life  of 
24 months at 2-8°C. 
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product and the manufacturing process of the finished 
product have been adequately described. Suitable IPC are in place. Process validation for the finished 
product is satisfactory. 
The control of finished product relies to a large extent on the same analytical methods as those used 
for  the  control  of  the  active  substance.  The  tests  and  rationale  for  the  acceptance  criteria  for  the 
finished product were considered acceptable. 
Viral safety and safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE are sufficiently assured. 
The  last  inspection  of  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  manufacturing  facilities  showed 
compliance to the current EU-GMP.

Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
Safety studies complied with GLP. However, the dose formulation analyses and some of the analytical 
tests to quantify panitumumab and antibodies to panitumumab were not in compliance with GLP but 
were in compliance with Standard Operating Procedures at the laboratories. 
Pharmacology 
The  ability  of  panitumumab  to  inhibit  growth  of  EGFR-expressing  tumour  cells  was  tested  using  in 
vitro methods and in vivo in tumour-xenotransplanted mice. Effects of panitumumab in combination 
with other therapeutic agents were assessed. Cross reactivity supported the choice of the cynomolgus 
monkey for safety testing.

•  Primary pharmacodynamics 
Panitumumab  acts  as  a  competitive  antagonist  at  the  ligand binding  site  of  EGFR  to  inhibit  binding 
and  signalling  mediated  by  EGF  and  transforming  growth  factor  α,  the  natural  ligands  for  this 
receptor. The affinity of binding of hybridoma-derived and CHO-derived panitumumab to the EGFR 
was determined in recombinant EGFR using BIAcore methods. Binding affinity of hybridoma-derived 
panitumumab  was  determined  to  be  5 x  10-11M; binding  affinity of  CHO-derived  panitumumab  was 
determined, in two experiments, to be 3.5 and 5.7 x 10-12M; in comparison the binding affinity of EGF 
reported in the literature is 3 x 10-9M. 
Inhibition  of binding  of  EGF  was  shown  in  A431 cells,  a  human  epidermal  carcinoma  cell  line  that 
expresses  EGFR.  Intracellular  acidification,  phosphorylation  and  internalisation  of  the  EGFR,  that 
occur upon binding of EGF to EGFR, were blocked in a dose-dependent manner by panitumumab in 
A431 cells. Panitumumab was also shown to inhibit cell growth in vitro and in vivo (xenotransplants 
in mice) in the same cell line. Additionally, panitumumab could be detected in tumour tissue. 
The ability of panitumumab to inhibit growth of a range of tumour types when these were transplanted 
into athymic mice was shown. Comparisons of cell surface levels of EGFR versus Her2 and response 
to  panitumumab  treatment  indicate  a  correlation  between  a  higher  EGFR:Her2  ratio  and 
responsiveness  to  panitumumab.  Tumour  types  that  express  17,000  EGFR  per  cell  or  more  may 
respond to panitumumab. 
In  combination  with  5-fluorouracil  or  with  oxaliplatin,  no  additional  efficacy  of  panitumumab  was 
shown in comparison to monotherapy. However, with irinotecan, additional tumour inhibitory effect 
was shown when the effect of the combination was compared to each agent alone. 
•  Secondary pharmacodynamics 
The  characterisation  of  secondary  pharmacodynamics  included  assessment  of  the  effects  of 
panitumumab,  either  as  a  single  agent,  or  in  combination,  in  a  large  number  of  studies  in  mice 
xenotransplanted  with  different  tumour  types.  These  studies  are  supportive  of  the  potential  use  of 
panitumumab in other tumours whose growth is EGFR-dependent. 
•  Safety pharmacology programme 
One  study  was  conducted  to  assess  potential  toxicity  to  the  cardiovascular,  respiratory  and  central 
nervous systems in conscious cynomolgus monkeys, by telemetry methods. Groups of 4 males were 
given a single intravenous dose of panitumumab at 0, 7.5, 30 or 60 mg/kg. These dosages resulted in 
exposure  that  is  similar  to,  or  4  or  8  times  the  exposure  in  patients  given  a  therapeutic  dose.  The 
animals were observed for at least 6 days post-dose to assess the reversibility, persistence, or delayed 
occurrence of effects related to panitumumab administration. 
tidal  volume  nor  on  body 
In this study, no clinical signs related to panitumumab were observed. Neuro-behavioural tests did not 
reveal any effect on the central nervous system. Neither effects of panitumumab on respiratory rate, 
identified.  There  was  also  no 
minute  and 
electrocardiographic evidence of test article action. There were neither test-article –related effects on 
PR  interval,  QRS  interval,  RR  interval  or  QTc  interval  nor  on  systolic,  diastolic  or  mean  blood 
pressure.  However,  QT  was  significantly  prolonged  across  all  doses  at  sporadic  time  points. 
Examination of individual data for QT over this time period indicates that the maximal individual QT 
interval is 317 ms and is in the low dose (7.5 mg/kg) group, at 12 hours post dose. Heart rate shows a 
significant decrease over this time period. QTc shows no such effect and QTc values are 346, 347, 345 
and 346 over the period 0–2 hours in the control, low, mid- and high dose groups respectively.

•  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic interaction studies were performed with a range of chemotherapeutic and targeted 
agents as described above.

Pharmacokinetics 
Quantification  of  panitumumab  and  of  antibodies  to  panitumumab  used  either  an  ELISA  or  an 
electrochemiluminescence  (ECL)  method  validated  for  use  in  monkey  serum.  Validation  of  the 
quantification in mouse serum  was not  provided and  therefore these data are not considered further. 
Tissue  distribution  studies  were  performed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  after  administration  of 
125I-iodinated panitumumab.  
Pharmacokinetics  of  panitumumab  is  presented  from  a  one-month  repeated  dose  study  using  once 
weekly intravenous injection in cynomolgus monkeys. Panitumumab showed dose-dependent kinetics 
and a ten-fold increase in dose was associated with an approximately proportionate increase in Cmax, 
Cavg and AUC (Table 4).

Panitumumab  pharmacokinetic  is  dose-dependent  and  consistent  with  saturation  of  clearance  of  the 
antibody. No accumulation on repeated, weekly, administration was noted. Nine of ten monkeys in the 
low  dose  group  were  MAHA  positive  (Monkey  anti-human  antibody  defined  as  anti-panitumumab 
antibody);  frequency  for  MAHA  positive  was  2/10  and  1/10  in  the  mid  and  high  dose  groups. 
Monkeys that developed MAHA were noted to have more rapid elimination of panitumumab. 
•  Absorption 
The drug is administered IV. 
•  Distribution 
Three  reports  on  the  distribution  of  panitumumab  are  provided.  The  most  representative  study 
consisted in a single intravenous dose of 7.5 mg/kg 125I-panitumumab administered to male and female 
monkeys. One animal of each sex per time point was killed at 2, 48, 120 and 216 hours after dosing to 
examine tissue distribution with whole body auto-radiography. Blood was also drawn from available 
monkeys  for  quantification  of  125I-panitumumab.  Urine  and  faeces  were  collected  to  quantify 
elimination. Pharmacokinetic data from the study are presented in the Table 5.

Tissue:serum concentration ratios of panitumumab in male monkeys were the following: thyroid (> 1), 
blood  (0.709),  lung  (0.562),  gall  bladder  (0.512),  liver  (0.502),  renal  medulla  (0.489),  adrenal  gland 
(0.434),  spleen  (0.416)  [both  red  and  white  pulp],  oesophagus  (0.339),  uveal  tract  (0.327),  kidney 
(0.317), renal cortex (0.297), stomach (0.260), seminal vesicles (0.253), nasal turbinates (0.235), small 
intestine (0.223), thymus (0.211) myocardium (0.209), salivary gland (0.176), urinary bladder (0.165), 
prostate (0.161), pancreas (0.155), pituitary gland (0.159), large intestine (0.148), skin (0.132), bone 
marrow (0.131), parotid gland (0.127), diaphragm (0.123), trachea (0.110). 
In females, tissue:serum concentration ratios were found for abdominal (0.155) and brown fat (0.192), 
and the ovary (0.541) and uterus (0.441). 
Radioactivity was also noted in brain and spinal cord tissue. 
•  Metabolism 
Metabolism studies were not conducted with panitumumab. 
•  Excretion 
Excretion of radioactivity after administration of 125I-panitumumab was predominantly in urine. After 
216 hours, 65.6% (in males) and 76.5% (in females) of the administered dose was excreted in urine 
with only 1.6% excreted in faeces. Overall recovery of radioactivity was over 80% at 216 hours. In 
urine, radioactivity was present in the form of free iodide or as small peptides. 
•  Pharmacokinetic Drug Interaction Studies 
No studies were performed with panitumumab. 
Toxicology 
•  Single dose toxicity 
No single dose general toxicology studies were conducted. 
•  Repeat dose toxicity (with toxicokinetics) 
Repeated  dose  general  toxicity  studies  were  conducted  using  intravenous  administration  of 
panitumumab  to  male  and  female  cynomolgus  monkeys.  These  studies  had  a  dosing  duration  from 
4 weeks  to  6  months,  and  all  used  once-a-week  dosing.  Table  6  summarises  the  general  toxicity

study designed to explore myocardial degeneration seen in the first study. 
Toxicity  to  skin  and  diarrhoea  was  the  primary  toxicity  of  panitumumab  in  monkeys.  These  effects 
were  severe  enough  to  cause  a  significant  number  of  unscheduled  deaths.  There  were  4  unexpected 
deaths that were caused by either electrolyte imbalance or allergic-type reactions. 
The  onset  of  skin  toxicity  was  typically  within  7–14  days  (i.e.  after  two  or  three  doses).  Severity 
correlated with dose and there is evidence that severity also correlated with duration of dosing. There 
was  improvement  in  condition  of  monkeys  after  stopping  dosing.  The  severity  of  toxicity  to  skin  at 
times  resulted  in  some  monkeys  skipping  doses  and  various  veterinary  treatments  were  applied  to 
alleviate  discomfort  (e.g.  ketoprofen  anti-inflammatory,  cephazolin  antibiotic  etc).  Skin  toxicity  is 
described as: erythema, irritation, crusting (with secondary infection), flaky skin (dandruff-like), loss 
of fur, abrasions, pustular dermatitis, hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, scabs, chronic dermal inflammation, 
chronic folliculitis, dermal oedema, papules and ulceration/necrosis, which could affect most areas of 
the body. 
Diarrhoea, or soft or liquid faeces, was also a common finding and also occurred in the lowest dose 
groups.  Intestinal  mucosal  hyperplasia  of  the  large  intestines  was  observed  in  the  initial  toxicology 
studies.  The  GI  tract  was  histologically  unremarkable  in  subsequent  studies,  including  the  6-month

study.  Severe  electrolyte  disturbances  occurred 
toxicity 
(hyponatraemia,  hyperkalaemia, 
hypochloraemia)  with  greater  severity  in  higher  dose  groups.  This  effect  was  observed  only  in  the 
early studies (secondary to the severe diarrhoea) where supportive fluids were not administered. It was 
not observed in subsequent studies, including the 6-month toxicity study, when supportive fluids were 
administered. Diarrhoea was a contributory factor to dehydration, and, it was suggested, to reductions 
in albumin in serum. Changes in food intake and body weight (described as cachexia in some cases) 
were considered to be related to general malaise arising from both these primary toxic effects. 
infiltrates  were  present.  Immunohistochemical  examination  showed 
Myocardial  degeneration  was  evident  in  the  first  1-month  study.  Changes  were  focal  to  focally 
extensive with affected myocytes adjacent to normal myocytes and involved the myocardium of both 
the  septum  and  ventricular  free  walls.  Degenerative  changes  were  described  as  sarcoplasmic 
vacuolisation/fatty change, hypereosinophilia, ring fibre formation and fibre shrinkage. No significant 
inflammatory  cell 
that 
panitumumab bound to endomysial cells of the myocardium plus nerve supporting cells and epicardial 
mesothelium.  Human  heart  binding  was  examined  for  comparison  and,  in  contrast,  there  was  only 
binding  to  human  endomysial  cells,  not  to  nerve  or  epicardial  cells.  Specific  testing  of  cardiac 
enzymes did not indicate presence of myocardial toxicity. Examination of hearts from monkeys in the 
3-month general toxicity study by electron microscopy could not identify any abnormality in relation 
to  treatment.  No  abnormal  effects  on  the  ECG  were  evident  and  of  unexpected  deaths,  none  were 
suspected to be due to an arrhythmia. Follow-up studies in which supportive fluids were administered 
determined that the cardiotoxicity observed in the initial 1-month study was related to prolonged and 
untreated dehydration and electrolyte imbalance secondary to severe diarrhoea. As a result, supportive 
fluids  were  administered  to  prevent  dehydration  in  all  subsequent  studies.  No  evidence  of 
treatment-related  cardiac  toxicity  was  observed  in  animals  administered  supportive  fluids,  including 
the  6-month  toxicity  study.  Additionally,  no  effects  on  cardiovascular  function  were  observed  in  a 
formal safety pharmacology study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Other effects included anaemia, diffuse hyperplasia in the adrenal glands and enlargement of inguinal, 
axillary and lumbar lymph nodes. This later one correlated with lymphoid cell hyperplasia and plasma 
cell  hyperplasia  after  histopathological  examination.  Toxicity  to  male  fertility  was  not  identified  on 
histopathological  examination  of  relevant  tissues.  No  consistent  changes  were  observed  in  serum 
magnesium concentrations. 
•  Genotoxicity 
Panitumumab has not been evaluated in genotoxicity studies. 
•  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. 
•  Reproduction Toxicity 
One  study  was  conducted  to  assess  reproductive  performance  and  early  embryonic  development.  A 
total of 44 female cynomolgus monkeys were given doses of 0, 7.5, 15 or 30 mg/kg IV once weekly 
for two menstrual cycles throughout the mating period to Day 20 of gestation. Males were not dosed. 
Overall rates of pregnancy in control, low-, mid- and high-dose groups were 6/12 (50%), 2/5 (40.0%), 
1/6  (16.7%)  and  2/6  (33.3%).  In  total,  5  out  of  17  (29.4%)  monkeys  that  were  mated,  having  been 
treated  with  panitumumab,  became  pregnant.  There  were  notable  findings  of  amenorrhea  and  of 
prolonged  menstrual  cycles.  Because  of  the  different  length  of  cycle  in  each  animal,  the  number  of 
administered  doses  was  variable  across  the  study  and  ranged  from  7  to  23  doses.  The  day  at  which 
maximal  concentrations  of  serum  17β-oestradiol  and  progesterone  were  reached  was  significantly 
delayed  by  panitumumab  treatment,  and  the  maximal  concentration  of  progesterone  (but  not  serum 
17β-oestradiol) was also reduced. 
Panitumumab  was  administered  intravenously  to  pregnant  female  cynomolgus  monkeys  to  assess 
potential embryotoxic and teratogenic effects. Dosage groups were 0, 7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg and group 
sizes were 12, 15, 18 and 5 respectively -at 30 mg/kg, three of the first five monkeys aborted. Each 
monkey was dosed once weekly from Day 20 of gestation for a total of 5 doses. The last dosing day 
was Day 48. Pregnancies were terminated at Day 100 to 103 and foetuses were examined. The high

dose  group  showed  a  statistically  significantly  higher  frequency  of  abortion/foetal  death  than  the 
control group. Data for total abortion/foetal death are:

However, there was no effect on foetal weight, organ weights, placental weights, foetal and placental 
external measurements, and foetal and placental histopathology. There was no NOAEL in this study, 
as  even  the  lowest  dose  was  associated  with  foetal  abortions  or  death  and  with  significant  maternal 
toxicity. No teratogenic effect was observed in surviving foetuses. 
•  Local tolerance 
Local tolerance was studied as part of the general toxicology studies using the intravenous route. 
•  Other toxicity studies 
Comparability of hybridoma-derived and CHO-derived panitumumab 
A repeated-dose general toxicity study was conducted in cynomolgus monkeys to compare the kinetics 
and toxicity of hybridoma-derived and CHO-derived panitumumab, using once-a-week injections for 
4 weeks followed by a 4-week recovery period. Dosage groups were 0, 7.5 and 30 mg/kg IV. There 
was no evidence of difference between hybridoma-derived and CHO-derived panitumumab. 
Comparability of 2-kl and 12-kl litre scale CHO-derived panitumumab 
A  study  of  similar  design  was  performed  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  to  compare  toxicity  and 
toxicokinetics  of  panitumumab  manufactured  at  two  different  scales:  2,000  litres  or  12,000  litres 
(commercial scale). Monkeys were dosed with 0, 7.5 or 30 mg/kg IV, once-a-week, for 3 months, with 
a recovery period of 6 weeks. During dosing, a 0.22 µm filter was in place. There was an additional 
group of monkeys who were dose with 7.5 mg/kg every two weeks and an additional further group of 
monkeys who were dosed with 30 mg/kg every week, but without a filter. It was concluded that there 
was no apparent difference in the toxicology or kinetics of panitumumab, dependent on the scale of its 
manufacture.

Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The rationale for EGFR inhibition in metastatic colorectal cancer is well established. The applicant has 
shown  that  panitumumab  specifically  binds  to  epidermal  growth  factor  receptors  and  inhibits 
signalling  through  this  receptor.  As  an  IgG2,  panitumumab  is  not  expected  to  act  via  Fc-dependent 
mechanisms

(e.g., 
The induction of hypomagnesaemia by panitumumab occurs in clinical use (6%) but was not detected 
in monkeys. It could be that there is a genuine species difference between monkeys and humans or that 
the studies in monkeys simply failed to detect this effect, due to the low frequency of its occurrence. 
Hypomagnesaemia has been adequately addressed in clinical studies. 
It was concluded that the statistically significant prolongation of QT seen is not biologically relevant. 
Nevertheless, apparent greater frequency of QT prolongation at the highest dose group over the period 
closest  to  drug  administration  could  represent  a  potential  signal.  The  lack  of  change  in  QTc  is 
reassuring. There was no evidence of treatment-related effect on cardiovascular parameters (heart rate,

mean arterial pressure) in the formal safety pharmacology study. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Two  methods  to  quantify  panitumumab  in  monkey  serum  were  used.  However,  data  suggested  that 
these  are  not  equivalent  and  that  the  validated  ECL  method  may  have  quantified  panitumumab 
concentrations at significantly higher than the ELISA method. The presence of anti-idiotypic MAHA 
directed against the antigen-binding site of panitumumab was raised as a possible interference factor. 
In view that significant immunogenicity response has not been reported in humans and that levels of 
panitumumab in serum will not be determined in the clinical setting the issue has not been considered 
of clinical relevance. 
Quantification of panitumumab in mouse serum has not been validated. Therefore, the data on mice 
are judged merely indicative. The studies in cynomolgus monkeys provide sufficient information on 
the  distribution  and  elimination  of  panitumumab.  Although  no  study  was  specifically  conducted  to 
assess  foetal  exposure,  this  is  considered  likely,  as  IgG2  immunoglobulins  are  known  to  cross  the 
placenta and to be secreted in milk. 
Toxicology 
In  the  initial  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  where  no  supportive  fluids  were  administered  myocardial 
degeneration  was  seen  in  all  treatment  groups,  both  at  Day  29  and  following  14  days  recovery.  No 
evidence of myocardial degeneration was observed in any other studies where supportive fluids were 
administered  to  prevent  dehydration  secondary  to  diarrhoea,  including  the  6-month  toxicity  study. 
Immunohistochemical staining of cardiac tissues revealed variable tissue binding of panitumumab to 
cells  of  the  myocardium  and  of  the  epicardial  mesothelium  in  the  monkey  heart  tissue  samples. 
However,  specificity  of  the  staining  could  not  be  determined  and  it  is  possible  that  the  positive 
staining observed in study was an artefact. In support for this argument, there were no clear correlation 
between myocardial degeneration and cardiac staining. Further, no binding of panitumumab was noted 
in human or monkey cardiac tissue in a formal tissue cross-reactivity studies which utilised optimised 
immunohistochemical techniques to assess specific panitumumab binding. 
Toxicity to skin and diarrhoea was the primary toxicity of panitumumab in monkeys. These effects are 
also seen with cetuximab, a chimeric anti-EGFR antibody and with small molecule inhibitors of EGFR 
such as gefitinib. It is considered directly related to the pharmacological action of drugs that inhibit 
EGFR signalling. 
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to embryo-foetal development since foetal panitumumab 
exposure levels were not examined. EGF and EGF receptors are involved in embryo-foetal growth and 
development,  and  effects  on  growth  and  development  would  therefore  be  expected.  Indeed, 
panitumumab  has  been  shown  to  be  an  abortifacient  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  when  administered 
during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 5-fold the exposure of recommended human dose of 
6 mg/kg every 2 weeks. 
No pre- and post-natal development animal studies have been conducted with panitumumab. 
4. 
Clinical aspect 
Introduction 
Panitumumab  is  a  fully  human  IgG2  monoclonal  antibody  that  is  directed  against  the  EGFR.  The 
EGFR  is  a  transmembrane  glycoprotein  that  promotes  cell  growth  in  a  variety  of  normal  and 
transformed tissues. The receptor has several natural ligands including EGF and transforming growth 
factor-alpha.  Binding  of  the  ligand  to  the  receptor  stimulates  cell  proliferation.  Blocking  this 
interaction by means of a monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor inhibits tumour growth in 
vivo.

The  clinical  development  of  panitumumab  was  designed  to  assess  its  efficacy  and  safety  in  patients 
the  colon  or  rectum  after  failure  of  oxaliplatin-  and/or 
with  metastatic  carcinoma  of 
irinotecan-containing  chemotherapy  regimens.  The  clinical  studies  submitted  included  15 clinical 
studies in patients with a variety of solid tumours (n = 1304). Among those studies, one Phase III, four 
Phase II  and  three  pharmacokinetics  studies  were  submitted  in  the  target  patient  population.  With 
regard to clinical efficacy, progression-free survival, overall survival, objective tumour response and 
disease-related  symptoms  as  well  as  quality  of  life  were  assessed.  During  the  development  of 
panitumumab, clinical trials have been conducted under the sponsorship of 3 companies, Abgenix Inc., 
Immunex Corporation and Amgen Inc. 
At the initiation of the clinical programme, panitumumab was produced by a human hybridoma cell 
line. Later, a decision was made to shift to CHO cells. The change took place in two steps. The first 
was from hybridoma to small scale CHO fermentation (2 kl), and subsequently to a commercial scale 
production (12 kl). Therefore, the clinical programme has involved patients receiving panitumumab of 
all three origins, with steps in between seeking to show equivalence between them. 
GCP 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic  data  were  obtained  as  part  of  the  clinical  safety  and  efficacy  studies.  Healthy 
volunteers  were  not  used.  The  pharmacokinetic  programme  (Table  7)  involved  use  of  panitumumab 
from different sources, in various cancer forms, at various dose regimens and in some cases also with 
concomitant administration of chemotherapy.

For human samples, an immunoassay with electrochemiluminescence detection was used to measure 
panitumumab. A biotinylated, anti-idiotypic antibody was immobilised on magnetic beads to bind to 
panitumumab in serum. A ruthenium-labelled panitumumab anti-idiotypic antibody was used to detect 
panitumumab by electrochemiluminescence. The lower limit of quantification was 78 ng/ml in serum. 
•  Absorption 
The drug is administered IV. 
•  Distribution 
In  Study  20030138  where  modelling  has  been  applied,  the  results  indicate  a  central  volume  of 
distribution of 42 ml/kg which corresponds to the typical plasma volume in humans. 
•  Elimination 
The applicant quotes ICHS6, that biotransformation studies are not required for monoclonal antibodies 
as  it  is  expected  that  the  antibody  is  degraded  to  small  peptides  and  individual  aminoacids.  The 
modelled half-life was approximately 8 days at steady state for doses ranging from 2.5 mg/kg once a 
week to 9 mg/kg every 3 weeks. 
•  Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose-finding  used  skin  toxicity  as  a  marker  of  primary  pharmacodynamic  effect.  A  plateau  in  the 
incidence of integument (skin, nails and hair) and eye toxicity occurred at 2.5 mg/kg once weekly. At 
this dose the trough concentrations exceeded the panitumumab concentration at which the non-linear 
pathway is saturated by 90% in animal xenograft models.

Pharmacokinetic simulations suggested that mean ±SD Cmax concentrations for 2.5 mg/kg once a week, 
6 mg/kg  every  two  weeks  or  9  mg/kg  every  three  weeks  were  119±35,  219±54  and  257±41 µg/ml, 
respectively and trough concentrations were 56 ± 22, 47 ± 19 and 49 ± 29 µg/ml, respectively. 
In  Study  20030138,  steady  state  was  reached  after  six  weeks  of  treatment  and  the  half-life  after  the 
2.5 mg/kg  once/week,  6  mg/kg  every  two  weeks  or  9  mg/kg  every  three  weeks  were  8.5,  7.5  and 
8.4 days, respectively. 
The modelling suggests that plasma concentrations vs. time can be described by a two-compartmental 
model  with  two  elimination  pathways:  elimination  occurs  in  a  first-order  fashion  via  the 
reticuloendothelial system like other IgG and by internationalisation of the EGF receptor. Non-linear 
pharmacokinetics was observed in the dose-range 0.75-9.0 mg/kg. The time-averaged clearance value 
decreases with increasing dose. The panitumumab concentration that produces 90% saturation of the 
nonlinear  clearance  pathway  was  to  be  9.77 ± 1.94 µg/ml  (95% CI: 5.93-13.6).  The  relationship 
between doses and clearance is visualised in Figure 5. 
Figure 5. 
Individual panitumumab average clearance after the first dose 
•  Special populations 
The population pharmacokinetic analyses used data from five studies with intensive sampling; for the 
other  eight  studies  only  peak  and  trough  samples  were  taken.  There  were  463  men  and  243  women 
included in the analysis, of these 600 were classified as white and 106 as other race. The tumour type 
was  classified  as  colon/rectum  in  247,  lung  in  162,  renal  in  210  and  other  in  87.  The  product  was 
manufactured by hybridoma in 613 patients and CHO cells in 93. Concurrent chemotherapy was given 
in 167 and not in 539. Weight mean and range were 81 kg (32-166); for age 60 years (21-88); for body 
surface area 2 m2 (1-3); for height 1.72 m (1.31-1.98) and for EGFR maximum staining intensity 2, 
(0-3). 
Panitumumab serum concentrations and body weight showed a correlation with higher concentrations 
in  heavier  patients  when  dosed  by  weight.  Despite  this,  dosing  according  to  body  weight,  as 
recommended  in  the  proposed  labelling,  reduced  inter-subject  variability.  Larger  body  weight  was 
associated with larger volumes of distribution and higher clearance. 
Population  pharmacokinetic  analyses  were  carried  out  using  modelling.  It  is  suggested  that  EGFR 
expression in tumour cells, primary tumour type, gender, race, age, impaired renal and impaired liver 
function  did  not  affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  panitumumab.  Modelling  showed  inter-individual 
coefficients of variation for the volume of the central compartment and of clearance of 53% and 25% 
respectively.

The  effect  of  gender  was  assessed  in  kinetic  data  from  three  studies  where  83  patients,  37%,  were 
women.  These  data  indicate  that  peak  concentrations  were  similar  although  the  mean  trough 
panitumumab concentration was 15% higher for women. In the same studies, 87 patients, 39%, were 
65 or older and showed no differences in kinetics compared to those < 65 years. For those over 75, the 
mean panitumumab concentration was approximately 10% higher. 
•  Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
No study is available. 
In vivo 
Interactions  between  panitumumab  and  chemotherapy  agents  were  tested  in  two  Phase II  trials. 
Panitumumab had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel, paclitaxel + carboplatin, irinotecan 
or  the  active  metabolite  of  irinotecan  (SN-38).  Irinotecan  and  its  metabolite  did  not  affect  the 
pharmacokinetics of panitumumab. Interaction with carboplatin alone was not evaluated. 
•  Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
No  in  vitro  permeability,  metabolism  or  metabolic  drug-drug  interaction  studies  that  used  human 
biomaterials were performed for this programme. 
•  Bioequivalence 
Bioequivalence between panitumumab of different origins and manufacturing process was explored in 
two studies: Studies 20030138 and 20030251. 
Study  20030138  was  an  open-label,  Phase  I  study  enrolling  97 patients  in  4 investigational  centres. 
Diagnostic  inclusion  criteria  were  solid  tumours  that  had  proven  refractory  to  chemotherapy.  The 
primary objective was safety of multidose panitumumab (at various doses) and pharmacokinetics, as 
secondary objective. Patients received 4 doses of panitumumab ranging from 0.1 to 9.0 mg/kg where 
the panitumumab was sourced from hybridoma and 6.0 and 9.0 mg/kg from CHO 2 kl origin. 
The  drug  was  administered  once  a  week  (qw)  for  doses  up  to  5 mg/kg,  every  two  weeks  (q2w)  for 
6 mg/kg  and  every  three  weeks  (q3w)  for  9  mg/kg.  Serum  sampling  times  were,  for  qw-dosing  at 
Dose 1: pre-infusion, 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 24, and 96 hours. At Doses 2, 3 and 4 only pre- and post-infusion 
samples  were  collected.  Serum  sampling  times  were,  for  q2w-doing  at  Doses  1  and  3:  pre-infusion, 
0.5, 8, 24, 96, 168, 240 and 288 hours. At Doses 2 and 4 only pre- and post-infusion samples were 
collected. Serum sampling times were, for q3w-doing at Doses 1 and 3: pre-infusion, 0.5, 8, 24, 96, 
168, 336 and 408 hours. At Doses 2, and 4 only pre- and post-infusion samples were collected. 
The population studied was 75% male, mean age 64 years (SD 11 years). Table 8 provides AUC and 
Cmax for hybridoma-derived and CHO-derived panitumumab after the first dose of 6 and 9 mg/kg.

Study 20030251 was an open-label, Phase I study, enrolling 57 patients in 7 investigational centres. 
Diagnostic inclusion criteria were solid tumours that had proven refractory to standard chemotherapy. 
The  primary  objective  was  safety  and  pharmacokinetics  of  panitumumab  derived  from  12  kl  CHO 
fermentation. The drug was administered at a concentration of 6 mg/kg every two weeks (as either a 
30-  or  60-minute  infusion)  and  at  9  mg/kg  every  three  weeks  (60-min  infusion).  The  treatment  was 
administered until disease progression. 
At Weeks 1 and 5, 20 patients who had received 6 mg/kg had samples drawn at pre-, post-dose and 
at 24, 96, 168 and 240 hours. Generally, pre- and post-dose samples were also drawn at Weeks 1, 3, 5, 
7 and 8. 
Table 9 displays comparative AUC and Cmax for 2 and 12 kl fermentation process after the first and 
third dose of 6 mg/kg of panitumumab generated from Studies 20030138 and 20030251, respectively.

Pharmacodynamics 
•  Mechanism of action 
The anti-tumour effects of panitumumab are thought to be primarily mediated by directly targeting the 
EGFR,  as  shown  in  the  preclinical.  Panitumumab  binds  to  the  EGFR  ligand-binding  domain  and 
17/68 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR by endogenous ligands, since it has no agonistic activity. 
In addition, panitumumab induces internalisation of the receptor in EGFR-expressing cells. 
•  Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No  study  was  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers  because  of  concerns  of  toxicity.  The  primary 
pharmacology  of  an  anti-cancer  agent  will  come  from  the  clinical  efficacy  data.  Several  other 
functions  of  EGFR  can  be  used  to  detect  pharmacodynamic  effect  such  as  the  role  of  EGFR  on 
epidermal  cells,  dose-finding  studies  were  based  on  the  incidence  of  rash  used  as  a  marker  of 
pharmacodynamic activity. 
Unwanted effects related to the primary mode of action occurred through the blockade of the EGFR. 
These  included  the  skin  and  eye  toxicity  which  occurred  in  91%  of  the  monotherapy  patients. 
Hypomagnesaemia occurred in 39%. EGFR is expressed in the kidney, particularly in the ascending 
loop  of  Henle,  where  70%  of  filtered  magnesium  is  reabsorbed.  It  is  thought  that  EGFR  inhibitors 
block  renal  tubular  reabsorption  of  filtered  magnesium,  or  possibly  by  interfering  with  magnesium 
absorption in the gut. 
Clinical efficacy 
The  clinical  study  programme  for  the  assessment  of  efficacy  comprises  a  total  of  five  studies,  one 
pivotal  (Study  20020408)  with  an  extension  (Study 20030194)  and  three  supportive  studies 
(Studies 20025405, 20030167, 20030250) (Table 10) conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer  (mCRC)  after  failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  including  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan, 
and/or oxaliplatin. 
Panitumumab is also being investigated in the following indications: 
-  Advanced non–small cell lung cancer in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
-  Renal carcinoma as monotherapy 
-  Hormone refractory prostate cancer with or without metastases as monotherapy

•  Dose response study(ies) 
Results  from  a  Phase  I  study  (20030138)  and  a  Phase  II  study  (20020374)  were  the  basis  for  the 
selection  of  the  dose  regimen  of  panitumumab.  Skin  rash  incidence  and  severity  was  used  as  an 
on-target pharmacodynamic marker for EGFR blockade. 
Figure 6. 
Study 20030138: Incidence of skin toxicities during the treatment period in study 
The  incidence  (Figure 6)  and  severity  of  skin  rash  increased  as  dose  increased  from  1  to  2.5 mg/kg 
once a week, reaching an apparent plateau at 2.5 mg/kg once a week. 
Also,  at  2.5 mg/kg  once  a  week  the  time-averaged  panitumumab  clearance  value  approached  the 
clearance value for endogenous IgG2, indicating that EGF-mediated clearance was saturated. 
The dose schedule of 6 mg/kg every two weeks (and 9 mg/kg every three weeks) were selected from 
modelling  of  pharmacokinetic  data  from  Study  20030138,  in  order  to  achieve  steady-state  through 
panitumumab  concentrations  (Cmin)  comparable  to  those  obtained  with  2.5 mg/kg  once  a  week  in 
Study 20025405. 
•  Main study 
Study 20020408 was conducted as a pivotal clinical study in metastatic CRC with the following title: 
“An  open–label,  randomised,  phase  3  clinical  trials  of  ABX–EGF  plus  best  supportive  care  vs.  best 
supportive  care  in  patients  with  metastatic  colorectal  cancer”.  Patients  with  progression  in  the  best 
supportive care (BSC) alone–arm were allowed to cross over to receive panitumumab in an open-label 
extension study (Study 2003194). 
METHODS 
Study Participants 
This was a multicentre study conducted at 81 centres in Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. 
Main inclusion criteria were: 
−  metastatic colorectal carcinoma 
−  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 
−  documented  evidence  of  disease  progression  during  or  after  treatment  with  a  fluoropyrimidine, 
− 
irinotecan, and oxaliplatin for metastatic colorectal cancer 
tumour  expressing  EGFR  by  immunohistochemistry  (membrane  staining  was  to  be  positive  in 
≥ 1% of evaluated tumour cells) 
EMEA/CHMP/597531/2007 0.2, CURRENT 
Page 20/68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Main exclusion criteria were: 
−  use of systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 30 days before randomisation 
−  prior EGFR targeting agents 
−  prior  anti–tumour  therapies  including  prior  experimental  agents  or  approved  anti–tumour  small 
molecules  and  biologics  with  short  serum  half–life  (< 1 week)  within  30 days  before 
randomisation, or prior experimental or approved proteins/antibodies with longer serum half–life 
(e.g., bevacizumab) within 3 months before randomisation 
−  chemotherapy other than fluoropyrimidine (or raltitrexed), irinotecan, or oxaliplatin for colorectal 
carcinoma  in  accordance  with  the  regimens  specified  (leucovorin  and  levamisole  were  not 
considered as chemotherapy in this exclusion criterion) 
Treatments 
The eligible patients were allocated to one of the two treatment arms: 
−  Arm 1: 6 mg/kg panitumumab intravenous once every two weeks in a minimum of 100 ml normal 
saline, over 60 to 90 minutes (depending upon volume) and BSC 
−  Arm 2:  BSC  comprised  any  concomitant  medications  or  treatments:  antibiotics,  analgesics, 
radiation  therapy  for  pain  control  (limited  to  bone  metastases),  corticosteroids,  transfusions, 
psychotherapy, growth factors, palliative surgery, or any other symptomatic therapy necessary to 
provide BSC, except other investigational agents or anti-neoplastic chemotherapy 
The cycles continued until disease progression, inability to tolerate panitumumab or other reason for 
discontinuation.  Patients  in  BSC  alone  arm  had  the  option  to  receive  panitumumab  6 mg/kg  once 
every  two  weeks  in  an  open–label  extension  study  (Study  20030194)  after  disease  progression, 
determined by the investigator. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  whether  panitumumab  plus  BSC  improves 
progression–free survival compared with BSC alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who 
failed standard chemotherapy. 
Secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  overall  survival,  objective  response,  duration  of  response, 
time-to-response,  time-to-disease  progression,  time-to-treatment  failure,  duration  of  stable  disease, 
patient-reported outcomes and the safety profile of panitumumab plus BSC compared with BSC alone. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary outcome measure 
The  primary  outcome  measure  was  progression–free  survival  which  was  defined  as  the  time  from 
randomisation to the date of the first observed progression or death. 
Secondary outcome measures 
−  Overall survival: time from randomisation to death 
−  Best objective response over time: the best disease status from randomisation through the end of 
the study 
−  Duration  of  response:  for  responders  as  the  time  from  the  first  response  to  either  disease 
progression or death due to disease progression 
−  Time-to-response:  time  from  randomisation  to  first  partial  or  complete  response,  subsequently 
confirmed ≥ 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met 
−  Time-to-disease  progression:  time  from  randomisation  to  disease  progression  or  death  due  to 
disease progression 
−  Time-to-treatment failure: time from randomisation to the time a decision was made to withdraw 
from the treatment phase for any reason 
−  Duration  of  stable  disease:  patients  whose  best  response  was  stable  disease  as  the  time  from 
randomisation to disease progression or death due to disease progression 
−  Quality of life measured by time–adjusted area under the curve for EUROQOL EQ–5D index and 
time–adjusted AUC for NCCN/FACT CRC subscale.

Patients were evaluated for tumour response according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria 
In Solid Tumours (RECIST) at Weeks 8, 12, 24, 32, 40, and 48 and thereafter every 3 months until 
disease  progression.  Patients  with  symptoms  suggestive  of  disease  progression  were  evaluated  for 
tumour status at the time the symptoms occurred. Tumour responses were to be confirmed no less than 
4  weeks  after  the  criteria  for  response  were  first  met.  In  addition  to  the  investigator’s  assessments, 
scans of all patients evaluated for tumour response were evaluated by a masked Independent Review 
Committee (IRC). The primary efficacy analysis was based on the masked IRC data.

Per Protocol 
All consented and randomised patients who were determined

prior fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin 
chemotherapy at an adequate overall exposure per the 
protocol

Sensitivity analyses of 
progression–free survival and 
overall survival 
Sample size 
The sample size was estimated to achieve > 90% power for a 2–sided 1% significance level, given a 
hazard  ratio  (panitumumab  plus  BSC:BSC)  of  0.67,  which  can  be  translated  into  a  50%  relative 
median increase in progression–free survival (2.50 vs. 3.75 months) or a 14% absolute increase in the 
6–month progression–free rate (19% vs. 33%). To achieve the sample–size goal, at least 362 patients 
in  total  were  required  to  have  either  documented  evidence  of  objective  progression  by  the 
modified-RECIST criteria assessed by IRC or to have died. It was estimated that a total of 430 patients 
would be required. 
Randomisation 
Patients  were  randomly  assigned  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  receive  panitumumab  plus  BSC  or  BSC  alone. 
Randomisation  was  stratified  by  ECOG  performance  status  (0  or  1  vs.  2)  and  geographic  region 
(Western Europe vs. Central and Eastern Europe vs. rest of the world). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open–label study. Masking was considered by the applicant not possible because of the 
expected  skin–related  toxicities  related  to  panitumumab.  Access  to  the  data  was  restricted  to  a 
minimum  number  of  individuals  and  masked  data  were  reviewed  by  the  IRC  for  the  event–based 
progression–free survival analysis. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint was progression–free survival which was compared by a stratified log rank test. 
The stratification factors were ECOG performance status and geographic region. 
If  the  log–rank  test  for  progression–free  survival  was  significant,  the  co–secondary  endpoints  of 
survival  and  best  objective  response  rate  over  time  were  analysed  simultaneously.  Survival  was 
analysed at the 4% significance level, while response rate was analysed at the 1% significance level. 
Hazard  ratios  and  corresponding  95%  confidence  intervals  were  estimated  by  Cox’  proportional 
hazards model. 
After completion of the 2–year long-term follow–up, descriptive statistics will be provided for all data 
collected. For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard error (SE; for efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and 
quality  of  life  endpoints),  standard  deviation  (SD;  for  other  measures),  median,  25th,  75th percentile, 
minimum, and maximum are provided. For discrete data, the frequency and percent distributions are 
provided.

Recruitment 
The enrolment period was from 16 January 2004 to 16 March 2005 and the cut–off date for clinical 
data was 30 June 2005. 
Most  patients  were  enrolled  at  study  centres  in  Western  Europe  (77% panitumumab  plus  BSC, 
78% BSC alone). One investigational centre was the highest–enrolling centre, with 63 patients (14%) 
overall:  35 patients  (15%)  in  the  panitumumab  plus  BSC  group  and  28 patients  (12%)  in  the  BSC

The  protocol  for  this  study,  originally  dated  12  September  2003,  was  amended  4  times.  All  the 
amendments were in effect prior to the data cut–off date (Table 12).

Major changes 
−  RECIST criteria were modified, in consultation with the central imaging laboratory conducting the 
blinded review (RadPharm, Princeton, NJ), to be consistent with current medical practice 
−  The Week–4 tumour assessment was removed, and it was clarified that patients with symptoms 
suggestive of disease progression should be evaluated for tumour response at the time the symptoms 
occurred 
−  The grading system for skin–related toxicities was changed from NCI CTC version 2.0 to CTCAE 
version 3.0 (with sponsor’s modifications), based on previous experience with version 2.0 and a lack 
of descriptive terms to grade these events effectively) 
−  Modifications to inclusion/exclusion criteria, study procedures, and other sections were made to 
improve clarity 
−  The definition of BSC was modified to include antibiotics, analgesics, radiation therapy for pain 
control (limited to bone metastases), corticosteroids, transfusions, psychotherapy, growth factors, 
palliative surgery or any symptomatic therapy as clinically indicated 
Patients were allowed to remain on study treatment beyond 48 weeks until disease progression or 
inability to tolerate panitumumab 
− 
−  Tumour assessments occurring every 3 months until disease progression were added after Week 48 
−  Membrane staining criteria used for the determination of EGFR expression in tumour cells was 
changed from ≥10% to ≥1% of evaluated tumour cells, based on label information from the recently 
FDA–approved anti–EGFR antibody, cetuximab 
−  An inclusion criterion was added that patients must have received at least 2 but no more than 3 prior 
lines of chemotherapy 
−  Modifications to inclusion/exclusion criteria, study procedures, and statistical methods were made to 
improve clarity 
−  The primary analysis set for the efficacy analyses was changed from the Adjudicated Prior Failures 
analysis set to the ITT analysis set, as the ITT set was more representative of the target population 
and maintained the balance achieved through randomisation. This change reduced the estimated 
sample size from 600 to 430 randomised patients 
−  The timing of the primary analysis was based on the number of disease progression events rather than 
a predefined number of patients followed for a specific period of time, which ensures statistical power 
is achieved 
−  The efficacy analysis set was replaced with a Per Protocol analysis set, which provided a more 
appropriate analysis set for the planned sensitivity analyses 
−  The timing of the analyses for tumour tissue biomarkers was changed to occur after the primary 
analysis of this study and, as such, may be analysed separately 
26 April 2005 
(n = 463)1 
−  The analysis of tumour tissue biomarkers (see above) was expanded to include investigation of EGFR 
gene amplification using fluorescence in–situ hybridisation analyses, using existing tumour biopsies

Baseline data 
In  the  ITT  population,  except  for  ECOG  status,  the  two  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  with 
regard to demographic data and disease characteristics (Tables 14, 15 and 16). Baseline demographic 
and  disease  characteristics  for  the  other  populations  (the  Adjudicated  Prior  Failures,  Per  Protocol 
populations) were similar to the ITT population.

Most patients in the panitumumab plus BSC and BSC alone groups had a partial response (29% and 
33%,  respectively)  or  stable  disease  (45%  and  41%,  respectively)  as  their  best  response  to  any 
previous  line  of  chemotherapy.  The  percentages  of  patients  with  an  objective  response  or  stable 
disease decreased with increasing lines of chemotherapy and most patients in the panitumumab plus 
BSC  and  BSC  alone  groups  had  progressive  disease  as  their  best  response  to  the  last  line  of 
chemotherapy (58% and 57%, respectively). Medical history was generally similar between treatment 
groups.  In  both  treatment  groups,  the  median  percentage  of  tumour  cells  with  positive  EGFR 
membrane  staining  was  20%.  The  percentage  of  patients  with  positive  EGFR  membrane  staining  in 
< 10% of tumour cells was similar in the panitumumab plus BSC group (26%) and BSC alone group 
(25%). A higher percentage of patients had positive membrane staining in > 35% of tumour cells in 
the panitumumab plus BSC group (40%) than in the BSC alone group (31%).

The  IRC  identified  and  measured  target  lesions  at  baseline  for  95%  of  patients  in  the  panitumumab 
plus  BSC  group  and  91%  of  patients  in  the  BSC  alone  group;  the  remaining  patients  had  only 
non-target  lesions  or  no  lesions  evaluated  by  the  IRC  at  baseline.  The  median  sum  of  target  lesion 
diameters  was  lower  in  the  panitumumab  plus  BSC  group  (179.5 mm)  than  in  the  BSC  alone  group 
(193.0 mm), although the means were similar (198.2 and 198.4 mm, respectively). 
Numbers analysed 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  of  all  efficacy  endpoints  was  conducted  using  the  ITT  population. 
Secondary  analyses  of  all  efficacy  endpoints  were  conducted  using  the  Adjudicated  prior  failures 
population. The Per Protocol population was used in sensitivity analyses of progression–free survival 
and overall survival for protocol deviations.

Progression–free survival (ITT population) 
With  a  median  follow–up  of  approximately  20  weeks,  193  patients  (84%)  in  the  panitumumab  plus 
BSC  group  and  208  patients  (90%)  in  the  BSC  alone  group  had  disease  progression  per  modified 
RECIST  criteria  by  IRC  or  died  due  to  any  reasons.  A  statistically  significant  improvement  in 
progression–free  survival  was  observed  for  patients  in  the  panitumumab  plus  BSC  group  compared 
with the BSC alone group (p < 0.0001, stratified log–rank test).

Quality of life 
At Week 5, EUROQOL EQ–5D data were available for 91% of patients in the panitumumab plus BSC 
group and 70% of patients in the BSC alone group; by Week 17, data were available for 30% and 4% 
of patients, respectively. The amount of available data at Weeks 5 and 17 for the NCCN/FACT CRC 
subscale was very similar to that of the EUROQOL EQ–5D. 
The panitumumab plus BSC group had a lower time–adjusted AUC for the DLQI92 (which assesses 
the  frequency  and  impact  of  skin  conditions  on  the  patient,  including  bother  and  embarrassment), 
indicating that these patients had more frequent skin symptoms (i.e., itchy, sore, painful skin) and were 
more embarrassed and bothered by their skin condition than patients in the BSC alone group. These 
results  are  consistent  with  the  higher  incidence  of  skin–  and  eye–related  adverse  events  in  the 
panitumumab  plus  BSC  group.  Although  patients  in  the  panitumumab  plus  BSC  group  were

negatively  affected  by  skin  toxicity  relative  to  the  BSC  alone  group,  no  statistically  significant  or 
clinically meaningful differences in overall quality of life were observed between treatment groups.

Time-to-disease progression 
In the ITT population, 189 patients (82%) in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 208 patients (90%) 
in the BSC alone group had disease progression per modified RECIST criteria assessed by the IRC or 
died of disease progression. The median time-to-disease progression was 8.0 weeks (95% CI: 7.9–8.7) 
in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 7.3 weeks (95% CI: 7.1–7.7) in the BSC alone group. 
Time-to-treatment failure 
In the ITT population, 202 patients (87%) in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 229 patients (99%) 
in the BSC group had ended the treatment period. The median time to treatment failure was 9.0 weeks 
(95% CI: 8.3–12.0) in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 7.1 weeks (95% CI: 6.4–7.6) in the BSC 
alone group. 
Duration of stable disease 
For the 64 patients (28%) in the panitumumab plus BSC group and 24 patients (10%) in the BSC alone 
group who had a best response of stable disease in the ITT population, the median duration of stable 
disease was 23.7 weeks (95% CI: 16.0–24.3) and 17.3 weeks (95% CI: 15.4–24.1), respectively. 
Duration of response and time-to-response 
Of the 19 patients (8%) in the panitumumab plus BSC group who had a partial response assessed by 
the IRC, 10 patients (53%) later had disease progression and one patient died. The median duration of 
response was 17.0 weeks (95% CI: 16.4–25.3). The maximum duration of response was 40.4 weeks. 
The median follow–up time for censored patients (progressive disease not confirmed by the IRC, on 
treatment at cut–off) was 17.9 weeks. For those patients who had an objective response, the median 
time to response was 7.9 weeks (95% CI: 7.3–8.1). 
Ancillary analyses 
Prospective sensitivity analyses 
Progression–free survival 
Several  prospectively  defined  sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  to  evaluate  the  robustness  of  the 
results  for  progression–free  survival,  overall  survival  (OS)  and  objective  response  rate  (ORR). 
Consistent results were observed in prospectively–defined sensitivity analyses.

Before Week 8, the percentage of patients with unscheduled assessments was 59% in the BSC alone 
group and 36% in the panitumumab plus BSC group. To evaluate potential bias based on the timing of 
unscheduled  tumour  assessments,  a  post–hoc  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  in  which  events  of 
disease progression confirmed by the IRC were moved to the day of the closest scheduled assessment 
time  in  both  treatment  groups  (deaths  were  not  moved).  The  treatment  effect  size  in  this  analysis 
(hazard ratio = 0.605, 95% CI: 0.491–0.745) was smaller than that observed in the primary analysis.

Subgroup–analyses 
Progression–free survival 
Exploratory  analyses  of  prospectively  defined  potential  prognostic  factors  for  progression–free 
survival in the ITT population (i.e., ECOG performance status, geographic region, EGFR membrane 
staining in tumour cells, age, gender, race, primary tumour diagnosis and progression during or after 
the  last  prior  chemotherapy  regimen),  independent  of  treatment  group,  indicated  that  ECOG 
performance  status  and  age  had  a  significant  effect  on  progression–free  survival.  Patients  with  an 
ECOG status of 0 or 1 were less likely to have disease progression or death relative to patients with an 
ECOG  status  of  2  or  3  (p < 0.001,  log  rank  test),  regardless  of  treatment.  In  addition,  patients 
≥ 65 years of age were less likely to have disease progression or death relative to patients < 65 years of 
age (p = 0.055, log-rank test), regardless of treatment. Similar results were observed in a multivariate 
Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for randomised treatment. 
Overall survival 
Exploratory  subgroup  analyses  of  the  ITT  population  indicated  that,  as  was  observed  for 
progression-free survival, an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 was associated with a significantly 
lower  death  event  rate  than  an  ECOG  status  of  2  or  3  (p < 0.001,  log–rank  test),  independent  of 
treatment  group.  In  addition,  EGFR  membrane  staining  of  3+  at  baseline  was  associated  with  a 
significantly  higher  death  event  rate  than  no  3+  staining  (p = 0.012,  log–rank  test),  independent  of 
treatment  group.  This  effect  of  EGFR  membrane  staining  was  statistically  significant  only  in  the 
panitumumab  plus  BSC  group.  Maximum  integument  and  eye  toxicity  was  possibly  associated  with 
survival, with a lower death rate for patients with more severe toxicity. This effect was only observed 
in the panitumumab plus BSC group; in the BSC alone group, the effect was reversed.

Study 20020194 
Study 20020194 was an open–label, single arm extension study to assess the safety of panitumumab 
monotherapy  in  patients  with  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  who  had  progressed  in  the  BSC  arm  of 
Study 20020408  (Figure 10).  Panitumumab  was  administered  without  pre-medication.  However, 
throughout the study, investigators could prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments deemed 
necessary,  except  investigational  agents,  anti–EGFR  targeting  agents  other  than  panitumumab, 
experimental or approved anti–tumour therapies (e.g., bevacizumab), chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

Participants 
One  hundred  eighty-one  (181)  patients  were  screened,  of  which  175  patients  were  enrolled.  ECOG 
performance  status  and  CEA  levels  had  increased  since  the  time  of  enrolment  into  Study 20020408. 
For  other  demographics  and  disease  baseline  characteristics,  the  data  are  in  consistent  with  the  data

Patients were evaluated for tumour response using modified-RECIST criteria every 8 weeks from the 
first  dose  of  panitumumab  and  at  the  time  of  suspected  disease  progression.  Local  assessment  was 
used  for  the  primary  analysis  of  response  rate.  Tumour  responses  were  to  be  confirmed  by  repeat 
assessments  no  less  than  4  weeks  after  the  criteria  for  response  were  first  met.  Time-to-disease 
progression was neither a pre-specified efficacy endpoint in the protocol nor in the statistical analysis 
plan.  The  efficacy  endpoints  were  analysed  using  the  investigators’  assessment  for  the  efficacy 
analysis. 
Results 
Fifty–nine  of  the  175  patients  (34%)  withdrew  during  the  treatment  period  for  reasons  other  than 
disease  progression.  This  incidence  was  higher  than  that  observed  in  the  panitumumab  plus  BSC 
group of Study 20020408 (22%). Similar to Study 20020408, the most common of these reasons were 
adverse  events  (11  [8%]),  death  (19  [14%])  and  “other”  (including  clinical/symptomatic  disease 
progression, 23 [17%]).

•  Study 20025405 
Participants 
Three  hundred  eighty  (380)  patients  were  screened,  from  which  a  total  of  150  patients  (106  into 
Cohort A and 44 into Cohort B) were enrolled from 17 study sites. 
Treatments 
Panitumumab was administered once weekly (2.5 mg/kg intravenous) for 8 consecutive weeks with a 
1–week  rest  between  each  course.  The  maximum  duration  of  panitumumab  administration  was 
54 weeks,  with  provisions  for  extended  treatment  beyond  6 courses  in  the  absence  of  disease 
progression or intolerability to panitumumab. Disease evaluation was performed every 9 weeks. 
Sample size 
As outlined in the protocol, with a sample size of 100 patients in Cohort A (high EGFR expression), 
this  study  had  80%  power  at  the  5%  significance  level  (2–sided)  to  test  the  null  hypothesis  that  the 
response  rate  was  10%  vs.  the  alternate  hypothesis  that  the  response  rate  was  truly  20%.  If  the 
observed  response  rate  was  20%,  this  sample  size  allowed  estimation  of  response  rate  to  within 
8 percentage points with 95% confidence. With a sample size of 50 patients in Cohort B (low EGFR 
expression),  if  the  observed  response  rate  were  20%,  this  sample  size  would  allow  estimation  of 
response rate to within 11 percentage points with 95% confidence. 
Outcomes/endpoint 
The primary endpoint 
−  Objective  tumour  response  after  the  initial  8–week  treatment  period  using  RECIST  criteria 
(confirmed by a scan no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met). 
The secondary endpoints 
−  Best overall objective tumour response throughout study 
−  Time to disease progression

The primary analyses of efficacy were performed in all patients who had received at least one dose of 
study drug and were based on a centralised review of tumour scans performed by a third party. 
Results 
Overall,  the  distribution  of  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  are  similar  to  the  pivotal 
Study 20020408. 
All  but  two  patients  received  at  least  one  dose  of  panitumumab.  Eighty  six  percent  (86%)  ended 
treatment due to disease progression, 5% due to adverse events, 3% due to death and 4% due to patient 
refusal and other reasons. 
Median  follow–up  time  (from  the  first  dose  of  panitumumab  to  last  physician  consult)  in  the  whole 
dataset was 7 months (range: 0–25) for all patients. Median follow–up in Cohort A was approximately 
1.5 months shorter than for Cohort B. 
tumour  response  rate  after 
The  objective 
treatment  period  was  6.8% 
(95% CI: 3.3-12.1). Across all 148 patients, there were no complete response and 10 partial responses. 
Cohort B had a higher percent of responders than Cohort A (11.6% vs. 4.8%, respectively). The 4.8% 
response  rate  in  Cohort  A  was  not  significantly  different  from  10%  (p = 0.085)  or  from  Cohort  B 
(p = 0.155). 
the  first  8–week 
The response rate across the entire treatment period was 8.8% (95% CI: 4.8-14.6), time-to-progression 
was 2.6 months (95% CI: 1.9-3.7) and median survival was 8.6 months (95% CI: 5.9-9.8). 
•  Studies 20030167 and 20030250 
Participants 
In Study 20030167, 300 patients were screened for this study of which 93 patients were enrolled into 
the study from 54 study centres. 
In Study 20030250, 99 patients were screened for this study of which 88 patients were enrolled from 
59 study centres (24 of these centres also enrolled patients into the Study 20030167). 
Treatments 
Panitumumab  was  administered  by  intravenous  infusion  at  a  dose  of  6 mg/kg  given  once  every  two 
weeks  until  patients  developed  progressive  disease,  were  unable  to  tolerate  panitumumab  or 
discontinued treatment for other reasons (e.g., administrative decision). 
Outcomes/endpoint 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoints  (centrally  assessed)  were  objective  response  rate  through  Week 16 
(responses needed to be confirmed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first  met) 
and duration of response. 
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  (centrally  assessed  except  as  otherwise  noted)  were  objective 
response  rate  throughout  study,  time-to-response,  progression–free  survival  time,  time-to-disease 
progression, time-to-treatment failure (not centrally assessed), duration of stable disease (not centrally 
assessed), survival time. 
Patients were evaluated for tumour response (both locally and centrally) at pre-specified timepoints, 
Weeks 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 and every 3 months thereafter during the treatment until disease 
progression.  The  primary  efficacy  analyses  were  based  on  a  masked  IRC  of  scans  at  the  central 
imaging laboratory using modified-WHO criteria. 
Results 
Overall,  the  distribution  of  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  are  similar  to  the  pivotal 
Study 20020408.

The primary efficacy subset for the interim report is evaluable adjudicated patients defined as patients 
who had ≥ 20 weeks potential follow–up, were determined to be eligible by the IRC (i.e., had received 
prior chemotherapy at the protocol–specified dose intensity and exposure, had developed progressive 
disease during or after their prior chemotherapy regimen and whose time between documented tumour 
progression  and  study  entry  was  ≥ 6 months).  These  datasets  were  composed  39  and  23 patients  for 
Study 20030167  and  20030250,  respectively.  A  supportive  analysis  was  conducted  on  evaluable 
patients  defined  as  patients  who  consented  and  enrolled  patients  who  had  ≥ 20  weeks  of  potential 
follow–up. These evaluable patients were 59 patients in Study 20030167 and 32 in Study 20030250. 
In Study 20030167, 91 of the 93 enrolled patients (98%) received at least one dose of panitumumab. 
The two patients who did not receive treatment were both determined to be ineligible after enrolment. 
As  of  the  data  cut–off  date  for  the  report,  18 patients  (19%)  were  still  in  the  treatment  period. 
Fifty-three patients (57%) ended treatment because of disease progression, 3% due to adverse events, 
8% due to death and 5% due to protocol specified criteria. 
In Study 20030250, all 88 enrolled patients received at least one dose of panitumumab. As of the data 
cut–off  for  the  report,  28  (32%)  patients  were  still  in  the  treatment  period.  Forty-five  (51%)  of  all 
enrolled patients ended treatment because of disease progression, 3% due to adverse events, 2% due to 
death and 2% due to protocol specified criteria. 
In  Study  20030167,  protocol  deviations  included  six  patients  who  received  bevacizumab  within 
6 weeks  before  enrolment  and  one  who  received  cetuximab  before  enrolment.  In  Study  20030250, 
protocol deviations included 10 patients who received bevacizumab within 6 weeks before enrolment. 
In both studies, the median follow–up time (from enrolment to the last on–study safety follow–up or 
long–term follow–up visit) was 15 weeks (range: 1–64 weeks). The median potential follow–up time 
was 24 weeks (range: 4-64 weeks). 
The results of the primary and the main secondary efficacy endpoints are shown in Table 24.

•  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
None  of  the  studies  focused  on  thorough  pharmacokinetic  characterisation  of  panitumumab  in  the 
target patient population using a commercial batch (12 kl CHO) at the proposed dose with reasonable 
number of patients and none had pharmacokinetics as primary purpose. The applicant has chosen to 
rely  on  argumentation 
for  equivalence  between  hybridoma-derived  panitumumab  and 
2 kl-CHO derived panitumumab and subsequent equivalence between 2 kl-CHO derived panitumumab 
and 12 kl-CHO derived panitumumab. The study of the bioequivalence of the two products from the 
manufacturing change from a hybridoma to a CHO expression system suggests that they are similar. 
The  90% CI  did  not  fall  within  the  CHMP  Bioequivalence  Note  of  Guidance  recommended  range

of 80-125%, certainly because of small numbers of patients. The equivalence between panitumumab 
from  2 kl  fermentation  and  12 kl  fermentation  seems  to  be  the  most  critical  regarding  the 
pharmacokinetics  and for that reason the demonstration of the equivalence should be very solid and 
reliable. Due to absence of a proper pharmacokinetic study and provided data from a limited number 
of patients, it is difficult to conclude with certainty on bioequivalence. 
Panitumumab  is  administered  intravenously.  The  results  indicate  a  central  volume  of  distribution  of 
42 ml/kg, which corresponds to the typical plasma volume in humans. Panitumumab is expected to be 
degraded into peptides and amino acids by reticulo-endothelial system (RES), like other IgG and also 
by  receptor  internalisation.  The  pharmacokinetics  of  panitumumab  can  be  described  by  a 
2-compartment  pharmacokinetic  model  with  dual  linear  (probably  RES)  and  non-linear  (probably 
EGFR)  clearance  pathways.  Non-linear  pharmacokinetics  was  observed 
the  dose-range 
0.75-9.0 mg/kg. The time-averaged clearance value decreases with increasing dose. 
in 
Pharmacokinetic  steady-state  is  claimed  to  be  obtained  after  3  doses  at  6 mg/kg  every  two  weeks, 
however not obvious from the serum concentrations-time curves of the different studies. The half-life 
is approximately 8 days. 
No studies were designed that specifically enable estimation of intra- or inter-individual variability. It 
would  have  been  appropriate  to  consider  both  intra-  and  between-subject  variation  in  much  more 
depth. 
There  is  reasonable  evidence  that  gender,  age,  hepatic  function  or  tumour  type  does  not  affect  the 
pharmacokinetics for panitumumab to a large extent. Renally impaired patients seem to have higher 
peak  serum  concentrations  than  normal  patients.  Some  racial  variation  was  observed,  non-white 
patients having lower panitumumab serum concentrations at peak and trough. Body weight was found 
to be an influential covariate on panitumumab disposition, with increasing exposure of panitumumab 
with increasing body weight. There is no experience with children. 
From  the  interactions  studies,  residuals  from  irinotecan  treatment  are  unlikely  to  interfere  with 
panitumumab after a switch from irinotecan to panitumumab. 
The  principal  mechanism  is  known  with  acceptable  certainty  already.  There  is  no  overwhelming 
reason  to  believe  that  active  protein  binds  other  targets  in  a  clinically  relevant  fashion  but  the 
possibility can of course not be excluded. The link between pharmacodynamic effect and skin toxicity 
seems straightforward. However, recently (ASCO 2006 Annual Meeting) it has been reported that the 
EGFR antagonist, nimotuzumab, YM BioSciences, was not associated with any cases of severe rash. 
This application is based on one pivotal, open–label, randomised, two arms, Phase III study and four 
uncontrolled,  single-arm,  Phase  II  studies  which  were  conducted  with  patients  with  metastatic 
colorectal  cancer  after  failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  including  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan 
and/or oxaliplatin. 
The  pivotal  study  was  conducted  at  81  centres  across  Europe,  Canada,  Australia,  and  New  Zealand 
and compared panitumumab at 6 mg/kg every two weeks and best supportive care vs. best supportive 
care  only.  The  treatment  was  given  until  disease  progression,  inability  to  tolerate  investigational 
product or other reason for discontinuation. The study design is acceptable as no generally recognised 
treatment  options  are  available  for  patients  who  have  failed  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  including 
5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin at the start of the study. 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  assess  whether  panitumumab  plus  BSC  improves 
progression–free survival compared with BSC alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who 
had  failed  standard  chemotherapy.  Secondary  objectives  were  to  evaluate  overall  survival,  objective 
response,  duration  of  response,  time-to-response,  time-to-disease  progression,  time-to-treatment 
failure,  duration  of  stable  disease,  patient–reported  outcomes  and  the  safety  profile  of  panitumumab 
plus BSC compared with BSC alone.

At progression, patients in the BSC alone–arm had the option to receive panitumumab in an open-label 
extension  study  after  disease  progression.  At  the  cut–off  date  for  clinical  data,  a  large  proportion 
(75%)  of  the  patients  who  had  disease  progression  in  the  BSC  alone  group  had  crossed  over  to  the 
extension  study.  The  crossover  occurred  early  in  the  study  (median  time-to-disease  progression  of 
7.0 weeks). Therefore this crossover design makes interpretation of the overall survival data difficult. 
In the two treatment arms, the baseline data of the recruited patients were not balanced with respect to 
metastatic site (liver: 77 vs. 84%), ECOG status (0: 46 vs. 34%; 1: 41 vs. 50%) and median tumour 
size  (179.5  vs.  193.0 mm)  for  panitumumab  plus  BSC  and  BSC  alone,  respectively.  Other 
demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. Overall, the 
demographics  and  disease  baseline  characteristics  are  considered  as  representative  of  patients  with 
advanced mCRC. 
There  was  a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  two  treatments  arms  (p < 0.0001)  with 
regard  to  the  primary  endpoint,  progression–free  survival.  However,  the  difference  between  median 
progression–free survival in the two arms was only 5 days (8.0 vs. 7.3 weeks for panitumumab plus 
BSC arm and BSC alone arm, respectively). The hazard ratio, adjusted for ECOG (0 - 1 vs. 2+) and 
region, was in favour of the panitumumab plus BSC arm, 0.542 (95% CI: 0.443 – 0.663). There was a 
higher rate of unscheduled tumour assessments (between Weeks 0 and 8) for patients in the BSC alone 
group than in the panitumumab plus BSC group (59 vs. 36%, respectively). When corrected for this 
bias,  the  treatment  effect  size  (hazard  ratio  =  0.605,  95%  CI:  0.491-0.745,  p < 0.0001)  was  smaller 
than  that  observed  in  the  primary  analysis.  At  Week  8  (first  tumour  assessment),  52  and  70%  had 
progressed in panitumumab plus BSC and BSC alone groups, respectively. 
No  significant  difference  in  overall  survival  between  the  two  treatment  arms  (p = 0.6065)  was 
detected. The median overall survival time was 6.3 and 6.0 months for panitumumab plus BSC arm 
and  BSC  alone  arm,  respectively.  Partial  response  was  detected  in  19 patients  (8%)  in  the 
panitumumab  plus  BSC  and  none  in  the  BSC  alone  groups  and  none  of  the  patients  had  complete 
response. No significant difference was observed in the Quality of Life assessment. 
The efficacy results from the four uncontrolled, monotherapy Phase II studies which included similar 
patient  populations  supported  the  efficacy  results  from  the  pivotal  study.  However,  it  is  difficult  to 
compare across these supportive studies and the pivotal study as there are different eligibility criteria, 
different methods of evaluation of tumour response (modified-RECIST and WHO criteria), timepoints 
for  tumour  assessments,  primary  endpoints  and  panitumumab  production  procedure  (hybridoma  vs. 
CHO).  The  general  picture  is  that  there  is  anti-tumour  efficacy  but  the  response  rate  is  low.  Only 
partial response was seen. 
Overall,  the  data  from  the  pivotal  study  showed  statistically  significant  difference  between  the 
panitumumab  plus  BSC  and  BSC  alone  arms  with  respect  to  progression–free  survival.  However, 
together with the small difference in median progression–free survival (0.7 week) and no significant 
difference  in  overall  survival,  concerns  remain  regarding  the  clinical  relevance  of  panitumumab 
treatment effect. 
The high mortality rate in advanced mCRC, with one-year survival of 43% (supported by results of the 
pivotal where approximately 50% of patients had died by Week 28), would have been ideal condition 
for  using  overall  survival  as  the  primary  endpoint..  Overall  mortality  would  have  been  a  more 
convincing primary endpoint, particularly as this was an open-label design. 
There is also a problem with quantifying the size of the benefit in terms of median progression-free 
survival, because more than 50% of patients on both groups experienced progression before the first 
scheduled  assessment  visit.  The  scheduling  of  the  first  visit  was  probably  related  to  a  general 
underestimation  of  the  severity  of  the  patient  population.  When  powering  the  study  the  median 
progression-free survival on best supportive care was estimated to be about 2.5 months but in fact it 
was much shorter. This makes the study less sensitive to detect differences than it would have been if 
an earlier visit had been included, increasing the confidence that the highly significant benefit seen is

real. But it does mean that summarising the results using median progression-free survival would not 
be appropriate. 
Panitumumab affected cell growth of some EGFR positive tumour cell lines in vitro but not the growth 
of  those  with  no  or  negligible  EGFR.  The  expression  level  of  EGFR  in  a  subset  of  human  tumour 
xenografts did not predict a response to panitumumab. However the applicant assumed the mechanism 
of  action  would  justify  the  adopted  EGFR  binary  classification  of  positive  or  negative  tumours  and 
that efficacy would be reflected in the EGFR receptor data. This assumption was proven to be false, as 
EGFR status did not correlate with efficacy. It would have been more informative to recruit patients 
with a range of EGFR expression, including negative. 
Clinical safety 
Safety evaluations of panitumumab have included analyses of 15 clinical studies in patients (n = 1304) 
with a variety of solid tumours (Table 25). Among those studies, 10 clinical studies of panitumumab 
monotherapy  have  enrolled  patients  (n = 789)  in  the  target  patient  population  (i.e.,  with  metastatic 
carcinoma of the colon or rectum after failure of prior standard chemotherapy). 
The  applicant  provided  an  update  of  safety  data  from  clinical  studies  in  which  panitumumab  was 
administered as monotherapy in the target patient population which includes 131 new patients (a total 
of 920 patients and a longer follow-up time from 137 patients who remained on study at the time of 
the  application  submission).  Thus,  the  median  length  of  follow-up  for  this  updated  mCRC 
monotherapy set was 21 weeks compared with 17 weeks of those described in the original submission. 
Overall, these updated safety results confirmed the conclusions previously presented in this section.

Long–term exposure to panitumumab (i.e., ≥ 6 months) was limited as most studies were ongoing at 
the time of data cut–off and patients in these studies had an advanced stage of disease and progressed 
relatively  quickly,  resulting  in  discontinuation  of  treatment.  Most  patients  (91%)  in  the  mCRC 
monotherapy patient population received < 6 months of panitumumab exposure. Data from long–term 
exposure (≥ 6 months) is available for 74 patients (9%) in the mCRC monotherapy patient population 
and 18 among these 74 patients had received ≥ 9 months of exposure. The median follow–up time for 
the mCRC monotherapy patient population was 17.0 weeks, with a range of 1 to 111 weeks.

reactions  occurred  with  a  similar  incidence  and  severity  in  the  mCRC  monotherapy  and  All 
monotherapy patient population, are detailed below. 
integument  and  eye 
Eight percent (8%) of patients required a temporary interruption and/or reduction of the panitumumab 
dose as a result of an integument– or eye–related toxicity. However, panitumumab administration was 
resumed  after  improvement  of  skin  toxicity  in  72%  of  these  patients.  Two  percent  (2%) of  patients 
permanently  discontinued  panitumumab  administration  for  integument-  and  eye-related  toxicities. 
Forty patients (5%) had Grade 3 acneiform rash and one patient was reported to have “acne” that was 
life  threatening  in  severity.  The  median  time  to  first  symptom  of  acneiform  rash  was  27  days 
(95% CI: 21 28) and the median duration of toxicity was 102 days (95% CI: 85–126). 
Stomatitis/oral  mucositis  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  98%  of  patients  yielding  an  overall 
incidence  of  Grade 3  or  4  stomatitis–type  adverse  events  of  0.3%.  However,  one  case  of 
life-threatening  fungal  stomatitis  occurred  approximately  one  month  after  panitumumab  was 
discontinued.  The  patient  later  died  due  to  fatal  systemic  mycosis.  The  event  was  not  considered 
related to panitumumab by the investigator. 
Diarrhoea  as  adverse  events  were  reported  in  29%  of  patients  and  were  considered  related  to 
panitumumab in 13% of patients. Most patients (93%) with diarrhoea had events mild or moderate in 
intensity. Fifteen patients (2%) had diarrhoea classified as severe. No patient had life–threatening or 
fatal diarrhoea. Six patients (1%) had events of diarrhoea by this definition that was serious; only one 
patient was considered related to panitumumab. Diarrhoea rarely led to modification of panitumumab 
administration: dose alteration and study discontinuation due to diarrhoea each occurred in one patient 
(< 1%) and none interrupted panitumumab treatment because of diarrhoea. 
Overall, 39% of patients with normal magnesium levels at baseline had decreases in serum magnesium 
levels  of  any  grade.  Grade  3  or  4  levels  were  observed  in  5%  of  patients.  Most  of  the  decreases  in 
serum  magnesium  were  asymptomatic  and  the  hypomagnesaemia  generally  responded  promptly  to

hypomagnesaemia and cardiac toxicity. Five patients (0.8%) had concurrent severe hypomagnesaemia 
and hypocalcaemia. In 3 of these cases, the hypomagnesaemia preceded the hypocalcaemia by at least 
one day. The median duration of the concurrent Grade 3 events was 8 days (range: 4-49). 
Most  treatment–related  pulmonary  adverse  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  most 
patients  with  treatment–related  pulmonary  adverse  events  had  pulmonary  metastases  at  study  entry, 
and  approximately  half  of  the  pulmonary  adverse  events  were  ongoing  after  discontinuation  of 
panitumumab.  One  severe  treatment-related  adverse  event  was  reported  (dyspnoea);  this  patient 
experienced  dyspnoea  30 minutes  after  the  first  panitumumab  infusion.  No  Grade  4  or 5 pulmonary 
adverse events were considered by the investigator to be treatment related. Interstitial lung disease was 
not identified as a complication in any patient. 
The  majority  of  the  cardiac  adverse  events  were  either  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity.  Five  patients 
(< 1%) experienced adverse events associated with cardiac function that led to either discontinuation 
or  interruption  of  treatment,  while  no  event  led  to  an  alteration  of  the  dose.  Most  of  the  12 patients 
with  serious  adverse  events  associated  with  cardiac  function  had  either  a  prior  history  of  the  same 
event  occurring  at  some  time  prior  to  study  enrolment  or  a  history  of  predisposing  cardiovascular 
co-morbidity and/or risk factors; nearly half of these patients had both prior event history as well as 
additional risk factors. Fatal events were reported for two patients and an additional two patients had 
Grade 4  (i.e., life-threatening)  events  associated  with  cardiac  function.  There  did  not  appear  to  be  a 
relationship  between  the  incidence  of  cardiac  adverse  events  and  duration  of  exposure,  length  of 
follow-up,  dosing  regimen,  panitumumab  cell  line  or  manufacturing  scale  nor  did  severity  of  the 
cardiac toxicities appear to be influenced by these factors. 
The  overall  patient  incidence  of  oedema,  venous  and  arterial  vascular  adverse  events  was  19%. 
About 4%  of  these  were  Grade  3  or  higher  and  2%  were  considered  to  be  related  to  study  drug.  In 
Study 20020408,  this  incidence  was  similar  as  in  the  mCRC  monotherapy  patient  population  in 
panitumumab group (21%) but higher than the BSC alone group (10%). Three percent (3%) of patients 
experienced serious vascular adverse events, all of which could be explained by predisposing medical 
problems  such  as  hypercoagulable  state  associated  with  adenocarcinoma,  advanced  age  or  the 
pre-existing history or medical complications. Seven patients (1%) were discontinued prematurely due 
to  vascular  adverse  events,  one  vascular  adverse  event  led  to  dose  interruption  and  one  led  to  dose 
alteration. 
Adverse  events  defined  as  vascular  toxicity  was  experienced  by  16 patients  and  were  considered 
related to study drug: oedema peripheral (8 patients), pulmonary embolism (3 patients), hypertension 
(2 patients)  and  cerebrovascular  accident,  deep  vein  thrombosis,  oedema  and  thrombophlebitis 
superficial  (1 patient  each).  The  adverse  events  were  mild  (5  patients),  moderate  (6 patients),  severe 
(1 patient),  life–threatening  (2 patients,  both  pulmonary  embolism)  and  fatal  (1 patient  with 
cerebrovascular accident and 1 with pulmonary embolism). 
No  potential  infusion  reaction  was  life–threatening  or  fatal.  Most  of  the  symptoms  of  potential 
infusion reactions were mild in intensity, occurred during the panitumumab infusion, resolved without 
treatment  and  were  isolated  occurrences  without  alteration  or  interruption  of  panitumumab 
administration. 
Immunological  events:  As  a  human  antibody,  an  immunological  response  is  possible  to  the 
panitumumab molecule. In addition, during the CHO manufacturing process an extra sequence of light 
chain  can  be  translated.  This  extra  sequence  may  emerge  as  a  pre-monomer  peak  before  the 
panitumumab peak that is approximately 1% of the main peak. Immunogenicity to both panitumumab 
and the pre-monomer were evaluated. 
An  acid  dissociation  ELISA  was  used  as  a  screening  immunogenicity  assay,  an  immunodepletion 
assay  as  confirmation,  a  bioassay  to  test  for  neutralising  activity  and  a  Biocore  based  assay  for 
isotyping and affinity testing. Table 32 presents these results.

mCRC monotherapy patient population 
Most  other  non–disease  progression  causes  of  death  also  appeared  to  be  related  to  the  underlying 
primary  malignancy  (such  as  hepatic  failure,  intestinal  perforation,  pleural  effusion,  small  intestinal 
obstruction).  Of  the  14  non-disease  progression  deaths  in  the  mCRC  monotherapy  population  two 
were  considered  to  be  possibly  related  to  panitumumab  by  the  investigator:  pulmonary  embolism  in 
one patient and myocardial infarction in another. 
An additional 69 deaths in the mCRC monotherapy population occurred between 31 and 60 days after 
the  last  dose  of  panitumumab.  Fifty–six  (81%)  of  these  deaths  were  due  to  disease  progression. 
Non-disease  progression  deaths  included  respiratory  failure,  systemic  mycosis  resulting  from 
mucositis and “unknown” (one patient each) and for 10 deaths the cause was not reported at the report 
cut-off date. 
All monotherapy patient population 
In  the  1,130  patients  in  the  monotherapy  patient  population,  134  (12%)  died  during  panitumumab 
treatment or within 30 days of the last dose. Disease progression was reported as the cause of death in 
118 patients. There were an additional 85 deaths that occurred between 31 and 60 days after the last 
dose of panitumumab and all of these deaths were considered to be caused by disease progression.

•  Combination treatment 
There were 174 patients who received panitumumab (for 93% at dose of 2.5 mg/kg once a week) in 
combination  with  chemotherapy.  Nineteen  patients  received  panitumumab  with  IFL  regimen 
(irinotecan,  leucovorin  and  5-fluorouracil),  24  with  FOLFIRI  regimen  (irinotecan,  leucovorin  and 
5-fluorouracil) and 131 with paclitaxel and carboplatin. 
Overall, the safety profile of the combination regimens was dominated by adverse events related to the 
chemotherapy,  with  the  addition  of  the  skin  toxicities  attributable  to  panitumumab.  While  no  clear 
additive  effect  was  observed  in  the  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  setting  where  panitumumab  was 
combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel, in the mCRC setting panitumumab in combination with IFL, the 
incidence of severe diarrhoea was notably higher than that historically expected for this already highly 
GI-toxic  chemotherapy  regimen  and  one  patient  had  an  episode  of  Grade  4  diarrhoea  that  was  also 
considered serious. Of note, panitumumab in combination with the FOLFIRI regimen using the same 
agents  but  different  doses/infusion  times  was  well  tolerated  with  an  incidence  of  severe  diarrhoea 
similar to that expected from the literature for this chemotherapy regimen alone. 
There were three fatal events in the all combination patient population which were considered possibly 
related  to  panitumumab  therapy.  The  causes  of  the  deaths  were  pulmonary  fibrosis,  gastrointestinal 
perforation and cerebrovascular accident. Of the 174 patients, 17 died during panitumumab treatment 
or within 30 days of drug discontinuation. Disease progression was the primary cause of death in eight 
of  these.  Many  of  the  others  reflected  the  toxicity  of  the  chemotherapy,  including  pneumonia  and 
pancytopenia  or  were  related  to  malignancy,  such  as  gastrointestinal  perforation  and  paralytic  ileus. 
There were a further two deaths between 31-60 days of stopping treatment caused by cardiopulmonary 
arrest and complications from elective surgery.

•  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety was assessed by review of death, discontinuation of treatment, analyses of laboratory data, vital 
signs,  serious  and  non-serious  adverse  events.  Data  from  1304  patients  (789  with  mCRC  and 
monotherapy,  341  with  other  solid  tumours  and  monotherapy;  174  with  mCRC  and  combination 
therapy)  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of  panitumumab  was  included  in  the  safety  analyses. 
Safety  assessment  focused  on  key  safety  findings  observed  with  administration  of  panitumumab  as 
monotherapy  (mCRC  monotherapy;  All  monotherapy),  as  monotherapy  is  the  applied  regimen.  The 
majority  of  the  patients  (77  and  58%  in  mCRC  monotherapy  and  All  monotherapy,  respectively) 
received  as  per  proposed  posology  (6  mg/kg  every  two  weeks).  There  is  limited  data  on  long-term 
exposure to panitumumab (74 patients with ≥ 6 months of exposure); however, this is acceptable as 
the  indication  sought  assumes  a  patient  population  with  limited  life  expectation.  Overall,  the  two 
datasets of interest are comparable with respect to demographics and disease baseline characteristics. 
The population included in the primary analysis for safety (mCRC monotherapy patient population) is 
considered representative of patients with advanced mCRC. 
All  patients  in  the  mCRC  monotherapy  patient  population  had  at least  one  adverse  event  during  the 
study  period.  The  most  common  (≥ 15%)  adverse  events  were  associated  with  the  skin,  including 
acneiform dermatitis (52%), pruritus, erythema (49% each), and rash (38%), skin exfoliation (23%), 
paronychia (19%) and skin fissures and dry skin (16% each) which reflect the pharmacological effect 
of  inhibition  of  EGFR  signalling  pathway.  Other  common  adverse  events  were  fatigue  (33%), 
nausea (29%),  diarrhoea  (26%),  constipation,  abdominal  pain  (20%  each)  and  anorexia  (19%). 
Approximately one-half of patients (54%) reported at least one Grade 3 or higher adverse event and 
the  most  common  ones  were  pruritus,  rash,  and  abdominal  pain  (5%  each).  The  adverse  events 
frequency and distribution are similar between the mCRC monotherapy and All monotherapy patient 
populations,  except  for  skin  exfoliation  which  occurred  with  a  difference  in  incidence  of  ≥ 5% 
(23% vs. 17%, respectively). 
The most common adverse events reported as severe, life threatening or fatal were directly attributed 
to the underlying cancer. Two patients had fatal adverse events (one patient with pulmonary embolism 
and one with cardiovascular accident and myocardial infarction) reported as related to panitumumab 
treatment. Additionally, eight patients (1%) had life-threatening adverse events that were considered 
related  to  panitumumab  (one  patient  had  acute  myocardial  infarction,  three  had  hypomagnesaemia, 
one had acute renal failure, two had pulmonary embolism, and one had acne and erythema). 
Due  to  high  percentage  of  patients  still  on  study,  suboptimal  compliance  with  protocol–required 
sample  collection  at  follow–up,  complete  immunogenicity  data  are  available  for  only  approximately 
one–third of the patients enrolled. From these limited data available, there is no apparent impact the 
presence of anti–panitumumab antibodies on pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety parameters. 
Like  other  EGFR-inhibitors,  the  most  common  adverse  events  were  related  to  panitumumab 
pharmacological  effect,  inhibition  of  the  EGFR  signalling  pathway.  However,  the  one  fatal  and  two 
life-threatening cases of pulmonary embolism in this relatively small safety population raise concerns. 
No  data  are  available  to  evaluate  safety  profile  of  panitumumab  in  patients  with  renal  impairment, 
paediatric patients and pregnant women. No notable differences were observed in panitumumab safety 
profile when assessed by gender, age or race.

Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Quality 
The  different  aspects  of  the  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and  biological  documentation  comply  with 
existing  guidelines.  The  fermentation  and  purification  of  the  drug  substance,  have  been  adequately 
described, controlled and validated. The drug substance has been well characterised with regard to its 
physicochemical  and  biological  characteristics,  using  state-of  the-art  methods,  and  appropriate 
specifications  have  been  set.  The  manufacturing  process  of  the  drug  product  has  been  satisfactorily 
described and validated. The quality of the drug product is controlled by adequate test  methods and 
specifications. The viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have 
been sufficiently assured.

Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
The  preclinical  testing  programme  for  panitumumab  included  primary  and  secondary  pharmacology 
studies,  assessment  of  cross  reactivity,  one  safety  pharmacology  study,  a  number  of  repeated  dose 
general toxicology studies and two studies assessing toxicity to reproductive function. 
Panitumumab  binds  to  the  ligand-binding  domain  of  EGFR  to  competitively  inhibit  the  action  of 
EGFR ligands to promote phosphorylation of EGFR. Where EGFR stimulation drives tumour growth, 
this competitive binding disrupts the EGFR ligand signal and consequently has an anti-tumour action. 
EGFR  expression  is  abnormal  in  malignant  transformations  in  a  variety  of  cell  types.  The  ability  of 
panitumumab  to  inhibit  growth  of  a  range  of  tumour  types  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  when  these  were 
transplanted into athymic mice has been adequately shown. 
Toxicity to skin and diarrhoea was the primary toxicity of panitumumab in monkeys. These effects are 
also seen with other chimeric anti-EGFR antibody and with small molecule inhibitors of EGFR. It is 
considered directly related to the pharmacological action of drugs that inhibit EGFR signalling. 
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to embryo-foetal development since foetal panitumumab 
exposure  levels  were  not  examined.  EGF  and  EGFR  are  involved  in  embryo-foetal  growth  and 
development  and  effects  on  growth  and  development  would  therefore  be  expected.  Indeed, 
panitumumab  has  been  shown  to  be  an  abortifacient  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  when  administered 
during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 6-fold the exposure of recommended human dose on 
a  mg/kg  basis.  No  pre-  and  post-natal  development  animal  studies  have  been  conducted  with 
panitumumab. 
Efficacy 
The  pivotal  study  compared  panitumumab  plus  BSC  to  BSC  alone  in  patients  with  metastatic 
colorectal  cancer  after  failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  containing  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan 
and  oxaliplatin.  The  primary  endpoint  was  progression-free  survival,  allowance  of  crossing  over  for 
patients in the controlled arm if they are declared progressing. The first assessment of progression was 
done at 8 weeks, at which time a large proportion of patients had already progressed. As this was an 
open-label  study,  more  patients  in  the  BSC  arm  had  unscheduled  visits  to  their  physician  before 
Week 8,  allowing  disease  progression  to  be  detected  earlier  in  these  patients.  A  very  small 
improvement  in  progression-free  survival,  no  significant  difference  in  overall  survival  and  a  low 
objective response rate were observed. 
Safety 
Like  other  EGFR-inhibitors,  the  most  common  adverse  events  were  related  to  the  pharmacological 
effect  (inhibition  of  the  EGFR  signalling  pathway)  and  resulted  mainly  skin  toxicity.  The  high 
incidence  of  adverse  events  affecting  the  patients'  quality of  life  is  a  safety  concern.  Although  most 
deaths were secondary to disease progression, there were several deaths that may have been related to 
the pharmacodynamic mode of action of panitumumab. 
Anti-idiotypic  antibodies  may  inhibit  the  mechanism  of  action.  From  these  limited  data  available, 
there  is  no  apparent  impact  of  the  presence  of  anti–panitumumab  antibodies  on  pharmacokinetics, 
efficacy and safety parameters but this could not be totally ruled out. 
User consultation 
The  Patient  Information  Leaflet  (PIL)  for  Vectibix  20 mg/ml  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion 
(panitumumab)  has  been  tested  in  English  in  accordance  with  Articles  59(3)  and  61(1)  of 
Directive 2001/83/EC,  as  amended  by  Directive  2004/27/EC.  The  PIL  for  Vectibix  20 mg/ml 
concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  (panitumumab)  was  found  to  contain  all  the  necessary 
information in a way that is accessible and understandable to those who participated in this test.

Risk/benefit assessment 
In  the  pivotal  study,  panitumumab  plus  best  supportive  care  (BSC)  was  compared  to  BSC  alone  in 
patients  with  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  after  failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  regimens  containing 
5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). 
The pivotal study was not adequately designed to demonstrate difference in overall survival as patients 
in  the  BSC  arm  were  allowed  to  cross-over  to  the  panitumumab  arm  when  progressing,  thereby 
confounding the comparison of overall survival between treatment groups. In late stage cancer patients 
with short expected lifetime, it would have been possible to run a trial without cross-over which would 
have allowed estimating the effect of treatment with panitumumab on overall survival. 
The first assessment of progression was done at 8 weeks, at which time a large proportion of patients 
had  already  progressed.  As  this  was  an  open-label  study,  more  patients  in  the  BSC  arm  had 
unscheduled  visits  to  their  physician  before  Week 8,  allowing  disease  progression  to  be  detected 
earlier in these patients. The lack of a scheduled early visit in both treatment arms leads to bias, and 
the  overall  difference  in  PFS  is  probably  overestimated.  Notwithstanding  these  methodological 
weaknesses, only a very small improvement in progression-free survival, no significant difference in 
overall  survival  were  observed,  and  a  low  objective  response  rate.  A  clinically  relevant  benefit  has 
thus not been sufficiently proven. 
The  most  common  adverse  events  reported  as  severe,  life  threatening  or  fatal  were  related  to  the 
underlying disease, however some deaths may have been related to panitumumab pharmacodynamic 
mode  of  action.  As  expected  for  an  EGFR  inhibitor,  the  most  common  adverse  reactions  by  patient 
incidence  were  skin  reactions,  including  acneiform  dermatitis,  pruritus,  erythema  and  rash  which 
reflect  the  pharmacological  effect  of  inhibition  of  EGFR  signalling  pathway.  The  quality  of  life 
assessment  indicated  that  the  patients  experiencing  these  adverse  reactions  were  more  embarrassed 
and disturbed by their skin condition than patients in the BSC alone group. 
Of note, a study with panitumumab combined with bevacizumab and chemotherapy vs. bevacizumab 
and  chemotherapy  alone  (PACCE),  as  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  CRC  has  been 
stopped  due  to  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  PFS  in  patients  receiving  panitumumab.  The 
addition  of  panitumumab  in  the  PACCE  trial  also  led  to  a  considerably  higher  frequency  of  severe 
adverse events, including deaths. Although the study is not of direct relevance to the indication sought 
the safety information is of major concern, also, for the claimed indication. 
In conclusion, the risk/benefit of panitumumab in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy containing 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin is not 
considered favourable due to the following grounds: 
•  The pivotal, open-label study is difficult to interpret because the majority of patients in the BSC 
were switched to panitumumab early on. More patients in the BSC arm had unscheduled visits to 
their  physician  before  Week 8  (first  scheduled  study  visit),  allowing  disease  progression  to  be 
detected earlier in these patients. 
•  Only a very small effect on progression-free survival has been observed, and no favourable effect 
has been shown in terms of overall survival or other clinical benefit endpoint. 
•  Treatment with panitumumab was associated with skin reactions, including acneiform dermatitis, 
pruritus, erythema, and poorer quality of life was reported in patients experiencing these adverse 
reactions.  In  addition,  safety  information  from  the  PACCE  study  raised  additional  concerns, 
including increased mortality in panitumumab-treated patients. 
•  The clinical efficacy observed is too small to constitute a clinical benefit and does not outweigh 
the risks associated to treatment with panitumumab.

Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal after 
failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  containing  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan  and  oxaliplatin  was  unfavourable 
and therefore did not recommend the granting of the marketing authorisation. 
7. 
Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 24 May 2007 
Following  the  CHMP  conclusion  that  the  risk/benefit  balance  of  panitumumab  in  the  treatment  of 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer after failure of prior chemotherapy containing 5-fluorouracil, 
irinotecan  and  oxaliplatin  was  unfavourable,  the  applicant  submitted  detailed  grounds  for  the 
re-examination of the grounds for refusal. The applicant presented a number of arguments regarding 
the grounds for refusal. 
Ground #1 (design of the pivotal study). The Applicant acknowledged that: 
(cid:131)  Study  20020408  was  the  first  randomised  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
panitumumab against BSC in an advanced, refractory mCRC 
(cid:131)  the  study  design  allowed  patients  in  the  BSC  group  who  progressed  to  be  enrolled  in 
Study 20030194 to receive panitumumab (“active crossover”) which confounds a direct evaluation 
of the effect of panitumumab on overall survival 
(cid:131)  More patients in the BSC arm had unscheduled visit before Week 8, allowing disease progression 
to be detected earlier in these patients. 
However,  sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  to  facilitate  the  interpretation  of  the  results  in  which 
progression  (assessed  by  IRC)  were  imputed  either  a)  at  the  closest  scheduled  assessment  time  or 
b) the next scheduled assessment time. For each method of imputation, PFS was modelled either as a 
continuous or discrete time variable. The results of these analyses are show in Table 38.

Note: Cox models adjusted for randomisation factors (ECOG score and geographic region) 
The  hazard  ratio  ranges  for  the  continuous  and  discrete  time  models  are  very  consistent  with  the 
primary analysis. Thus, even the most conservative estimate indicates the rate PFS was decreased by 
approximately 40% in the panitumumab group compared with BSC. 
Ground #2 (treatment effect). The Applicant argued that: 
•  PFS  was  statistically  significant  in  favour  of  patients  receiving  panitumumab  (Table 18),  as 
above-mentioned sensitivity analyses showed hazard ratios ranging from 0.53 to 0.61 (Table 38). 
•  There was a greater probability of being alive and progression free at Week 8 of treatment with 
panitumumab  compared  to  BSC  alone.  A  similar  estimate  was  observed  up  to  Week 24 
post-randomisation (Figure 12).

•  Due  the  possibility  of  initiating  panitumumab  treatment  in  BSC  patients  after  progression,  the 
Study 20020408  design  did  compromise  any  conclusion  on  OS  improvement.  However,  a  study 
using monoclonal antibody (cetuximab) in mCRC demonstrated an association between PFS and 
OS (Jonker et al, 2007). 
Overall,  the  observed  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect  on  PFS  as  measured  by  the  hazard  ratio  is 
clinically meaningful in the targeted patient population after failure of 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and 
oxaliplatin  therapy  and  compares  favourably  with  that  observed  with  other  agents  licensed  for  the 
treatment of metastatic CRC. Additional trials of panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy are 
ongoing to further characterise the effect of panitumumab on OS. 
Ground #3 (safety profile). The Applicant stated that: 
•  Treatment-related  adverse  events  were  predominantly  mild-to-moderate  skin  toxicities,  a 
recognised  class  effect  of  EGFR  inhibitors.  Approximately 75%  of  patients  who  reduced  or 
interrupted panitumumab dosing because of a skin-related adverse event were able to subsequently 
reinstate their initial dose. Patients most bothered by their skin toxicity appeared to experience the

best  overall  outcomes  (Figure 14),  i.e.,  better  PFS  and  better  OS.  Similar  results  have  been 
observed with other EGFR inhibitors for worst severity of skin toxicity (Perez-Soler et al, 2005). 
In clinical studies, there were a low incidence of infusion reactions (none were life-threatening or 
fatal), even in the absence of premedication.

•  Severe,  life-threatening  or  fatal  adverse  events  were  generally  attributable  to  comorbid  illnesses 
rather than to panitumumab. 
• 
In the Study 20020408, the QoL was assessed using: 
• 
• 
• 
the  NCCN/FACT  CRC  symptom  index  (FCSI)  for  colorectal  cancer  symptoms.  The  FCSI 
results were numerically in favour of panitumumab 
the  modified  Dermatology  Life  Quality  Index  (mDLQI)  subscale  for  the  impact  of  skin 
toxicity. Patient treated with panitumumab had lower scores, indicating that they were more 
symptomatic and more embarrassed and/or bothered by their skin symptoms than were patient 
with BSC alone 
the EuroQol-5D Health Index (EQ-5D Index) and the EORTC Global Health/Quality of Life 
Scale  (EORTC  Global)  for  the  overall  QoL.  The  results  indicate  that  panitumumab  did  not 
have a negative impact on overall QoL. 
•  The  PACCE  study  was  designed  to  compare  the  efficacy  (primary  endpoint  PFS,  secondary 
endpoints  OR  rate,  time  to  treatment  failure,  OS)  and  safety  of  bevacizumab  and  chemotherapy 
(oxaliplatin or irinotecan) combined or not with panitumumab for first-line treatment of mCRC. 
• 
Initial interim safety results were based on all 926 enrolled patients who received at least one 
dose of study treatment. Of these, 793 patients received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and 
133  patients  received  irinotecan-based  chemotherapy,  the  reported  results  are  based  on 
patients  who  received  oxaliplatin  as  chemotherapy.  A  summary  of  main  safety  results  is

The overall safety profile and pattern of adverse events remained consistent with mCRC monotherapy 
compared with the ongoing post-marketing safety surveillance and clinically manageable. Moreover, 
PACCE study are consistent with the observed toxicity of dual pathway inhibition in combination with 
chemotherapy, therefore PACCE study results should not be generalised to the use of panitumumab as 
monotherapy.

•  The  results  on  PFS  are  supported  by  the  OR  and  SD  rates  (assessed  by  the  IRC)  where  17  and 
34%  was  observed  in  the  wild-type  vs.  0  and  12%  in  mutant-type,  respectively.  Beneficial 
treatment  effect  is  present  when  maximum  decrease  in  tumour  size  is  considered  however  no 
effect on OS was observed in this subgroup of patients either. 
•  This subgroup analysis indicates that patients with wild-type KRAS receives more infusions and 
had a slightly increased incidence of adverse events, however the rates observed were comparable 
to those seen in the mCRC monotherapy dataset.

•  The applicant is conducting two large pivotal, Phase III studies (Studies 20050181 and 20050203) 
in patients with mCRC using panitumumab in combination as first or second-line treatment. The 
applicant commits: 
(cid:131)  using  that  further  data  for  confirming  treatment  effects  in  the  wild-type  and  mutant  KRAS 
populations 
(cid:131)  exploring  the  utility  of  other  biomarkers  that  may  further  identify  those  more  likely  to 
respond. 
Ground #5. From clinical efficacy and safety data presented above, the Applicant is of viewpoint that 
the  treatment  effect  observed  in  the  subpopulation  of  patients  who  had  progressed  on  all  available 
anticancer  therapies  patient  and  presenting  with  wild  type  KRAS  phenotype  is  of  clinical  relevance 
with an acceptable safety profile. 
The CHMP requested the SAG to answer to following 3 questions: 
1.  Does  the  observed  treatment  effect  in  terms  of  PFS  represent  a  clinical  benefit,  taking  into 
account: 
• 
concerns with the reliability of the PFS measure, in particular due to the design and conduct of 
the pivotal study (open-label and asymmetry of the unscheduled visit before Week 8) and 
lack  of  evidence  of  any  clinically  meaningful  effect  on  overall  survival  or  other  important 
clinical benefit endpoints 
• 
Divergent views were expressed but the SAG-oncology globally considers that: 
•  Overall Survival remains the most appropriate endpoint for end stage of the disease. There is 
no suggestion that treatment with panitumumab had any effect on important clinical endpoints 
such as overall survival. 
•  Progression-free survival is considered to be an endpoint that is of relevance in earlier lines of 
the treatment. Regardless of line of treatment, PFS would require large effects in order to be 
considered of any benefit to the patient (PFS). Despite the statistically significant difference 
observed in terms of the primary endpoint PFS, the observed difference is very small and is 
not considered to be of clinical relevance. Small differences of this kind are, may be, partly 
due to chance and partly caused by imbalances of known and unknown prognostic factors. In 
this  respect,  concerns  were  raised  on  unbalanced  baseline  characteristics  of  recognised 
prognostic factors favouring the experimental treatment arm. 
2.  Does the toxicity profile of panitumumab in the claimed indication raise safety concerns? To what 
extent  does  the  toxicity  observed  in  the  PACCE  study,  including  increased  mortality  in 
panitumumab-treated  patients,  contribute  to  safety  concerns  for  the  claimed  target  population  in 
this submission? 
The SAG-oncology does not consider that the safety profile of panitumumab is a major concern 
since  it  appears  being  not  really  different  from  those  described  for  other  EGFR  inhibitors.  The 
panitumumab toxicity is recognised to be clinically manageable  by the experts. However, in the 
absence of a meaningful benefit, the benefit risk was considered negative. 
3.  Would KRAS mutation status be an appropriate bio-marker for selecting patients for initiating a 
treatment  with  panitumumab?  Would  further  data  be  necessary  to  support  this  observation  or  to 
fully demonstrate that KRAS mutation status is a relevant bio-marker for patient selection? 
The results of the post-hoc analyses on KRAS being a possible biomarker for selection of patients 
to be treated with panitumumab are interesting but remain exploratory findings which need to be 
confirmed  by  results  of  prospective,  well-designed,  well-conducted  study(ies).  From  a 
pharmacological point of view this remains a possible theory but there are no data to confirm it.

Overall conclusion on grounds for re-examination 
The pivotal trial showed an effect on PFS that is considered small, but of a comparable magnitude to 
those observed in other studies which have supported recent regulatory approvals for other anticancer 
drugs as irinotecan, oxaliplatin, bevacizumab, or cetuximab. 
For Study 20020408, additional analysis results showed a statistically significant larger panitumumab 
treatment  effect  on  PFS  in  patients  with  the  wild-type  KRAS  compared  with  patients  with  the 
mutant-type. 
Most  common  adverse  events  observed  in  clinical  trials  of  panitumumab  monotherapy  or  in 
combination  with  chemotherapy  were  skin  rash,  it  is  a  well-known  side  effect  of  EGFR  inhibitors. 
These effects were manageable since 75% of patients who reduced or interrupted panitumumab dosing 
because  of  a  skin-related  adverse  event  were  able  to  subsequently  reinstate  their  initial  dose. 
Moreover, measures of overall Quality of Life do not indicate that panitumumab has a clear positive 
impact on Quality of Life. 
Finally,  results  taken  from  the  PACCE  study  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  in  the  context  of 
panitumumab  being  used  together  with  bevacizumab-containing  chemotherapy.  These  results  should 
not  be  generalised  to  include  the  use  of  panitumumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  regimens 
alone or the monotherapy settings. 
Adverse reactions reported in clinical trials are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Overall,  the  additional  arguments  and  analyses  presented  indicate  that  the  benefit-risk  profile  of 
panitumumab is marginally positive in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer after 
failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  containing  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan  and  oxaliplatin.  However,  the 
inability  to  select  patients  that  respond  to  treatment  is  a  pitfall  of  available  options  in  this  setting. 
Additional efficacy analyses provided indicated an interaction of panitumumab with KRAS mutation 
status.  Although  this  interaction  is  being  investigated  further  in  prospective  trials,  this  interaction 
allows selecting patients for treatment with panitumumab and the indication should be restricted based 
on this criterion. The ability to select patients that might benefit from treatment with this type of agent 
is considered a major therapeutic advantage to those affected. 
In  addition,  the  applicant  has  agreed  to  provide  a  prospective  statistical  analysis  plan  describing  the 
analysis  of  a  wild-type  KRAS  subpopulation  in  ongoing  Phase 3  trials.  The  applicant  has  also 
committed to explore and report the utility of other biomarkers that may further identify those more 
likely to respond and to provide additional data on Quality of Life using a validated scale. Finally, the 
applicant has committed to ensure the availability of KRAS test kit. 
Thus,  concerning  the  grounds  for  negative  opinion,  having  considered  the  additional  arguments  and 
analyses presented by the applicant and the answers from the SAG, the CHMP concluded that: 
•  Based on sensitivity analyses presented, unscheduled visits are unlikely to alter the conclusions in 
terms  of  the  statistically  significant  effect  observed  in  terms  of  PFS  and  major  bias  can  be 
excluded. 
•  A small but statistically significant effect in terms of progression-free survival has been observed 
and  efficacy  can  be  considered  demonstrated  even  in  the  absence  of  a  statistically  significant 
difference in terms of overall survival. 
•  The  safety  profile  of  panitumumab  is  not  a  major  concern  and  appears  to  be  similar  from  that 
described for other EGFR inhibitors. The toxicity of panitumumab is recognised to be clinically 
manageable. 
•  The clinical  efficacy observed is small but a positive benefit-risk profile can  be established in a 
restricted indication. 
The  CHMP  considered  the  need  to  provide  additional  information  to  refine  the  understanding  about

consulted with the applicant considered the granting of a  marketing authorisation subject to specific 
obligations to be reviewed annually by the Agency. 
The  CHMP  considers  that  Vectibix  falls  within  the  scope  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  507/2006,  with 
particular  reference  to  Article  2,  based  on  the  following  grounds.  Vectibix  aims  at  the  treatment  of 
metastatic colorectal cancer which a seriously debilitating and life-threatening disease. 
The  CHMP  considers  that  Vectibix  fulfils  the  requirements  of  Article  4  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 
507/2006 based on the following grounds: 
(a)  The main clinical efficacy data for Vectibix are based on a randomized trial of Vectibix plus best 
supportive care vs. best supportive care in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Vectibix 
was  administered  as  monotherapy  at  the  recommended  dose  of  6 mg/kg  of  bodyweight  given 
once  every  two  weeks.  Patients  to  be  included  had  to  have  documented  evidence  of  disease 
progression  during  or  after  treatment  with  a  fluoropyrimidine,  irinotecan  and  oxaliplatin  for 
metastatic  colorectal  carcinoma.  In  this  randomised,  controlled,  clinical  trial,  a  statistically 
significant improvement in progression-free survival has been observed among Vectibix treated 
patients  compared  with  those  who  received  best  supportive  care  alone.  In  an  analysis  adjusting 
for  potential  bias  from  unscheduled  assessments,  based  on  all  patients,  the  rate  of  disease 
progression or death in patients who received Vectibix was reduced by 40% relative to patients 
who  received  best  supportive  care  alone.  Additional  retrospective  efficacy  analyses  studied  the 
association  between  KRAS  mutation  status  determined  in  archived  paraffin  embedded  tumour 
tissue and clinical outcome. In the KRAS wild-type subgroup, the rate of disease progression or 
death  in  patients  who  received  Vectibix  was  reduced  by  51%  relative  to  patients  that  received 
best  supportive  care  alone.  No  significant  treatment  effect  was  observed  in  the  KRAS  mutant 
group. The safety profile in the KRAS wild-type subgroup was considered acceptable. Thus, the 
benefit-risk  profile  of  Vectibix  monotherapy,  as  defined  in  Article 1(28a)  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC, is positive in the treatment of patients with EGFR expressing metastatic colorectal 
carcinoma  with  non-mutated  (wild-type)  KRAS  after  failure  of  fluoropyrimidine-,  oxaliplatin-, 
and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens. 
(b)  Studies (20050181 and 20050203) to provide a better understanding of the role of the interaction 
between panitumumab and KRAS mutation status are ongoing and it is expected that results will 
be  submitted  in  the  agreed  timeframe  as  specific  obligations  to  be  reviewed  on  a  yearly  basis. 
Ongoing trials, although conducted in different clinical settings from the proposed indication, will 
provide  valuable  information  about  the  impact  on  the  benefit-risk  profile  of  the  interaction 
between treatment effect of panitumumab and KRAS mutation status. Therefore, it is likely that 
the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data. 
(c)  There are few treatment options available for patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma after 
failure  of  prior  chemotherapy  containing  5-fluorouracil,  irinotecan  and  oxaliplatin.  Cetuximab, 
which  acts  as  a  signal  transduction  inhibitor  of  EGFR  is  approved  for  use  in  combination  with 
irinotecan  in  patients  with  EGFR  expressing  metastatic  colorectal  cancer  who  have  failed  prior 
irinotecan  therapy.  Patients  treated  with  chemotherapy  and  monoclonal  antibodies  tend  to 
progress after a certain time and their only treatment option is best supportive care. The inability 
to select patients that respond to treatment is a pitfall of available treatment options in this setting. 
The retrospective analyses presented for Vectibix monotherapy indicated an interaction between 
treatment effect of panitumumab and KRAS mutation status. In the KRAS wild-type subgroup, the 
rate  of  disease  progression  or  death  in  patients  who  received  Vectibix  was  reduced  by  51% 
relative  to  patients  that  received  best  supportive  care.  No  significant  treatment  effect  was 
observed in the KRAS mutant group. This interaction allows to select patients for treatment with 
panitumumab and to exclude patients that are unlikely to benefit from this type of treatment and 
for  whom  other  options  might  be  available.  The  ability  to  select  patients  with  metastatic 
colorectal  carcinoma  who  are  likely  to  benefit  from  Vectibix  monotherapy  treatment,  allowing 
physicians  to  make  an  informed  decision  about  the  best  treatment  options  for  patients  having 
failed a number of previous combination regimens, is considered a major therapeutic advantage. 
Therefore, Vectibix will address an unmet medical need. 
(d)  In  view  of  the  favourable  benefit-risk  profile  in  the  restricted  indication,  and  the  fact  that  the 
additional data required only concern the interaction between panitumumab and KRAS mutation, 
67/68

the  immediate  availability  on  the  market  outweighs  the  risk  inherent  in  the  fact  that  additional 
data are still required. 
Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by majority 
decision  that  the  risk/benefit  balance  of  Vectibix  as  monotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
EGFR expressing metastatic colorectal carcinoma with non-mutated (wild-type) KRAS after failure of 
fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing chemotherapy regimens was favourable and 
therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  conditional  marketing  authorisation,  subject  to  the 
following specific obligations: to provide results of ongoing studies 20050181 and 20050203.

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2018 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
The sponsor GW Research Ltd submitted on 31 August 2017 an application for designation as an 
orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 
cannabidiol for treatment of tuberous sclerosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The 
application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing cannabidiol was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical data showing a reduction in seizure frequency in 
patients with the condition;  
the condition is chronically debilitating due to facial disfigurement and severe neurological 
symptoms and life threatening due to the formation of multiple tumours; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing cannabidiol will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The 
sponsor has provided preliminary clinical data demonstrating a relevant reduction in seizure frequency 
in patients refractory to anticonvulsant therapy. The Committee considered that this constitutes a 
clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing cannabidiol, as an orphan medicinal product for the 
orphan indication: for treatment of tuberous sclerosis.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
type II variation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Tuberous sclerosis or tuberous sclerosis complex TSC is an autosomal dominant inherited 
neurocutaneous disorder that is characterised by the development of multiorgan benign tumour-like 
growths, most usually observed in the skin, brain, kidney, heart and lungs that could potentially lead 
to organ dysfunction. 
TSC is caused by mutations in two genes: TSC1 gene is located on chromosome 9 and produces a 
protein called hamartin. The TSC2 gene is located on chromosome 16 and produces the protein 
tuberin. These two proteins create a complex that regulates the mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR). 
Due to the pathophysiology of TSC, the progression and appearance of its signs and symptoms are 
slow and subtle thus, patients are usually misdiagnosed or diagnosed at later stages in life. Focal 
cortical malformations (FCMs) are the most common cause of medically intractable epilepsy (resistant 
to antiepileptic drug polytherapy) in the paediatric patient population. 
The definition and description of the condition has not changed since the initial orphan designation. 
The approved therapeutic indication “For use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with 
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) for patients 2 year of age and older” falls within the scope of the 
designated orphan condition “treatment of tuberous sclerosis”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by a positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP (see 
EPAR). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
No additional medicines have been approved specifically for the treatment of tuberous sclerosis since 
the initial orphan drug designation application was approved in January 2018. 
Tumours in TSC patients can occur in any major organ, and they develop primarily in the brain, eyes, 
heart, kidney, skin, and lungs (Crino 2006). Whereas SENs and SEGAs are usually asymptomatic, the 
presence of cortical tubers is widely believed to contribute to the neurologic manifestations of TSC, 
which include epilepsy, cognitive disability, and autism (Crino 2006; Curatolo 2008; Northrup 2013). 
Morbidity and mortality are increased in TSC patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy (Chu Shore 
2010). Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) was the second most common cause of death 
after TSC kidney disease in a study of all patients with TSC (Amin 2017). Analysis of epilepsy studies 
have identified frequent generalized seizures as a major risk factor for SUDEP (Hesdorffer 2011; Ryvlin 
2013). Therefore, a critical therapeutic goal in treatment of TSC is decreasing seizures.

The condition remains chronically debilitating and life threatening. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
Based on the references found in updated literature search, the estimated prevalence of TSC in the EU 
ranges from 0.1 to 0.9 per 10,000 persons, as summarised in Table 1.

Using a mean of the above figures, an estimated prevalence of TSC in the EU is 0.4 per 10,000 
persons. The range of values provided above, and the estimate given at the time of initial designation 
would support adoption of ‘less than 1 in 10,000’ value in this case. The estimate and the range of 
values submitted by the sponsor are acceptable. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
TSC associated seizures can be treated with several anti-seizure medicines, including vigabatrin, 
corticotropin (ACTH) or steroids, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, carbamazepine, felbamate, clobazam etc, 
their use depending on the type of seizures and epileptic syndrome. A significant proportion of patients 
(37–63%) become resistant to treatment with these medicines (Chu-Shore 2010; Vignoli 2013; 
French 2016). 
Everolimus is the only therapy specifically authorised for adjunctive treatment of patients aged 2 years 
and older whose refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, are 
associated with TSC. 
Everolimus (the 40-O-[2-hydroxyethyl] derivative of sirolimus/rapamycin) is a kinase inhibitor that 
selectively inhibits mTOR activity (Votubia 2020). 
Significant benefit 
Despite the availability of everolimus, a large number of patients with TSC experience refractory 
seizures. Only 3.8% to 5.1% of patients with TSC associated seizures were seizure free during 
everolimus treatment compared with 0.8% in the placebo group in the everolimus phase 3 study

EXIST 3; 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency from baseline was achieved by 28% to 40% of 
patients who were treated with everolimus compared with 15% of patients treated with placebo. 
(French 2016). 
At the time of initiation of the GWEP1521 trial in April 2016, no drugs were specifically approved for 
the treatment of TSC-associated seizures. Therefore, Protocol Assistance has not been sought in the 
EU regarding the demonstration of significant benefit specifically to treat TSC. 
The sponsor proposed that CBD-OS offers improved efficacy when used as adjunctive treatment with 
currently used AEDs and a major contribution to patient care over everolimus. 
Trial GWEP1521 enrolled patients aged 1 to < 57 years of age, with a clinical diagnosis of TSC and a 
documented history of epilepsy not completely controlled by 1 or more current AEDs. The majority of 
the patient population was male (58%), White/Caucasian (90%), and < 18 years of age (74%). The 
median number of current AEDs was 3 (range: 0–5), with the most common being valproic acid 
(45%), vigabatrin (33%), levetiracetam (29%), and clobazam (27%).  
The patient population had failed a median 4 AEDs prior to treatment, most commonly levetiracetam 
(53%) and vigabatrin (49%). Eligibility based on seizure count was confirmed at the end of the 4-week 
baseline period. The most common current seizure types reported during baseline period were Type 2 
focal (focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or awareness) (67.0% of all patients); Type 3 
focal (focal seizures evolving to bilateral generalized convulsive seizures) and tonic seizures (both 29% 
of all patients), tonic-clonic (23% of all patients) and atonic (12.5% of all patients). The median TSC-
associated seizure frequency (average per 28 days) during this time was 57 (range: 8 to 558), or a 
median of 2 seizures per day.

The benefit of Epidyolex as an adjunctive treatment to the standard anti-epileptic treatments was demonstrated by 
the positive benefit risk assessment in this setting. The benefit of Epidyolex has been shown for those patients who 
were failing on prior treatments with vigabatrin, valproic acid or levetiracetam. This comparison to standard anti-
seizure medicines was accepted.

In the initial sponsor’s position Epidyolex treatment in TSC patients constitutes a major contribution to 
patient care compared with everolimus. The analysis of significant benefit over everolimus is of most 
relevance for the discussion of significant benefit because of closely overlapping indications. 
The arguments to support the significant benefit versus everolimus were proposed as follows: 
1.  Different mechanism of action. This argument is not sufficient on its own because it also has to 
translate to relevant changes in efficacy or safety of the product. However, the fact that Epidyolex 
acts through a different mechanism of action may be used as an explanation of the claimed 
clinically relevant advantage. 
2.  Fulfilment of an unmet need: despite the availability of everolimus, a large number of patients with 
TSC experience refractory seizures. Only 3.8% to 5.1% of patients with TSC associated seizures 
were seizure free during everolimus treatment compared with 0.8% in the placebo group in the 
everolimus phase 3 study EXIST3; 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency from baseline 
was achieved by 28% to 40% of patients who were treated with everolimus compared with 15% of 
patients treated with placebo (French 2016). This argument can only be used if Epidyolex is shown 
to fulfil this unmet need. In the absence of a comparative trial or date in everolimus refractory 
population, this is not possible to assess. 
3.  Improved efficacy was claimed based on the fact that Epidyolex is indicated for a broader patient 
population. While efficacy regarding focal-onset seizure reduction is on par with everolimus 
(historic control) in comparable refractory study populations, Epidyolex is indicated for a broader 
target population including also generalised-onset seizures, and a high response was confirmed in 
this special patients’ group. In contrast, in the SmPC of Votubia it is mentioned that the use of this 
drug has not been established in patients with generalised-onset seizures. The COMP questioned 
the true existence of the generalised-onset seizures in the TSC population, because it is believed 
that all seizures in these patients are of focal origin. However, in discussion with the sponsor it was 
acknowledged that in approximately 10% of patients it is not possible to differentiate between 
focal and generalised seizures. Patients affected by such seizures were actively excluded in the 
EXIST-3 study, whereas in GWEP1521 they were included and significant efficacy in this patient 
population was observed. 
4.  Safety profile is claimed to be favourable for Epidyolex, with a considerably lower number of 
Important Identified Risks than established for Votubia in the Risk Management Plans. Main safety 
issues with cannabidiol are somnolence and weight loss, and usually reversible liver function 
disorders (ALT/AST increments). In contrast, Votubia is a narrow-therapeutic window drug which 
requires regular monitoring of the drug plasma level as it can be nephrotoxic at higher dose levels, 
and cause myelosuppression (neutropenia, lymphopenia, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia) - and 
consequently, serious infections. This argument was questioned by the COMP, especially in context 
of a potential combination therapy of Epidyolex and Votubia. However, the sponsor explained that 
many patients will never receive Votubia due to associated safety concerns and patients unable to 
tolerate long-term treatment with Votubia would benefit from treatment with Epidyolex. This 
argument was accepted. Furthermore, Votubia is prone to pharmacokinetic interactions with 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, whereas this is not the case for Epidyolex. This argument was acknowledged 
and not discussed further.  
5.  Major contribution to patient care is claimed based on the fact that regular monitoring is required 
during the use of Votubia regarding drug plasma level and safety parameters (haematology, lipids 
and renal function). This is in contrast to CBD where less monitoring is required (liver enzymes

only). However, no quantification of treatment burden was presented, and it was not supported by 
adequate patient reported outcomes. Thus, the COMP considered this argument as invalid.   
Taken together, the Committee agreed that the claim of significant benefit of Epidyolex over Votubia 
holds based on clinically relevant advantage. Both, efficacy and safety arguments were considered 
valid.

4.  COMP position adopted on 18 March 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of tuberous sclerosis (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to disfiguring tumours and severe neurological 
symptoms including treatment-resistant seizures that can lead to cognitive disability and life 
threatening due to the formation of multiple tumours; 
although satisfactory methods for the treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the assumption that Epidyolex may be of potential significant benefit to those 
affected by the orphan condition as defined in the granted therapeutic indication still holds. 
Epidyolex is authorised for a broader range of seizures, whereas Votubia is authorised only in 
partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in tuberous sclerosis. Furthermore, 
the safety profile of Epidyolex is considered significantly different to that of Votubia. In contrast to 
Votubia, Epidyolex is not associated with immunosuppression, which offers an alternative for 
patients who cannot tolerate the chronic use of Votubia. These arguments constitute a clinically 
relevant advantage.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
•

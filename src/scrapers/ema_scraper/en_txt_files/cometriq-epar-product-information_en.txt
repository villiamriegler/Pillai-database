CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
COMETRIQ is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally advanced 
or metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma. 
For patients in whom rearranged during transfection (RET) mutation status is not known or is negative, a 
possible lower benefit should be taken into account before individual treatment decision (see important 
information in section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy with COMETRIQ should be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of anticancer 
medicinal products.  
Posology 
COMETRIQ (cabozantinib) capsules and CABOMETYX (cabozantinib) tablets are not bioequivalent and 
should not be used interchangeably (see section 5.2).  
The recommended dose of COMETRIQ is 140 mg once daily, taken as one 80 mg orange capsule and three 
20 mg grey capsules. Treatment should continue until the patient is no longer clinically benefiting from 
therapy or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
It should be expected that a majority of patients treated with COMETRIQ will require one or more dose 
adjustments (reduction and/or interruption) due to toxicity. Patients should therefore be closely monitored 
during the first eight weeks of therapy (see section 4.4). 
Management of suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption and/or dose reduction 
of COMETRIQ therapy. When dose reduction is necessary, it is recommended to reduce to 100 mg daily, 
taken as one 80 mg orange capsule and one 20 mg grey capsule, and then to 60 mg daily, taken as three 
20 mg grey capsules.  
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dose interruptions are recommended for management of CTCAE grade 3 or greater toxicities or intolerable 
grade 2 toxicities.  
Dose reductions are recommended for events that, if persistent, could become serious or intolerable. 
As most events can occur early in the course of treatment, the physician should evaluate the patient closely 
during the first eight weeks of treatment to determine if dose modifications are warranted. Events that 
generally have early onset include hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, palmar-
plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES), and gastrointestinal (GI) events (abdominal or mouth pain, 
mucosal inflammation, constipation, diarrhoea, vomiting).  
The occurrence of some serious adverse reactions (like GI fistula) might be dependent on the cumulative 
dose and might present in a later stage of treatment. 
If a patient misses a dose, the missed dose should not be taken if it is less than 12 hours before the next dose. 
Concomitant medicinal products 
Concomitant medicinal products that are strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be used with caution, and 
chronic use of concomitant medicinal products that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided (see 
sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Selection of an alternative concomitant medicinal product with no or minimal potential to induce or inhibit 
CYP3A4 should be considered. 
Elderly patients 
No specific dose adjustment for the use of cabozantinib in older people (≥ 65 years) is recommended. 
However, a trend in increased rate of SAEs has been observed in subjects aged 75 years and older. 
Race 
There is little experience with cabozantinib in non-White patients.  
Renal impairment  
Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  
Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment as safety and efficacy 
have not been established in this population. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment the recommended dose of cabozantinib is 60 mg once 
daily. Close monitoring of overall safety is recommended in these patients (see section 5.2) as dose 
adjustment or interruption may be required. Cabozantinib is not recommended for use in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment as safety and efficacy have not been established in this population. 
Patients with cardiac impairment 
There is limited data in patients with cardiac impairment. No specific dosing recommendations can be made. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of cabozantinib in children aged <18 years have not yet been established. No data are 
available. 
Method of administration 
COMETRIQ is for oral use. The capsules should be swallowed whole and not opened. Patients should be 
instructed to not eat anything for at least 2 hours before through 1 hour after taking COMETRIQ. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Dose reductions and dose interruptions occurred in 79% and 72%, respectively, of cabozantinib-treated 
patients in the pivotal clinical study. Two dose reductions were required in 41% of patients. The median time 
to first dose reduction was 43 days, and to first dose interruption was 33 days. Close monitoring of patients is 
therefore recommended during the first eight weeks of therapy (see section 4.2). 
Hepatotoxicity 
Abnormalities of liver function tests (increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin) have been frequently observed in patients treated with cabozantinib. It 
is recommended to perform liver function tests (ALT, AST and bilirubin) before initiation of cabozantinib 
treatment and to monitor closely during treatment. For patients with worsening of liver function tests 
considered related to cabozantinb treatment (i.e where no alternative cause is evident), the dose should be 
reduced or treatment interrupted following recommendations provided in section 4.2. 
Perforations, fistulas, and intra-abdominal abscesses  
Serious gastrointestinal (GI) perforations and fistulas, sometimes fatal, and intra-abdominal abscesses have 
been observed with cabozantinib. Patients who have had recent radiotherapy, have inflammatory bowel 
disease (e.g., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, peritonitis, or diverticulitis), have tumour infiltration of 
trachea, bronchi, or oesophagus, have complications from prior GI surgery (particularly when associated 
with delayed or incomplete healing), or have complications from prior radiation therapy to the thoracic 
cavity (including mediastinum) should be carefully evaluated before initiating cabozantinib therapy and 
subsequently they should be monitored closely for symptoms of perforations and fistulas. Non-GI fistula 
should be ruled out as appropriate in cases of onset of mucositis after start of therapy. Cabozantinib should 
be discontinued in patients who experience a GI perforation or a GI or non-GI fistula. 
Thromboembolic events 
Events of venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism and events of arterial 
thromboembolism, sometimes fatal, have been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib should be used 
with caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of, these events. Cabozantinib should be 
discontinued in patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction or any other clinically significant 
arterial thromboembolic complication. 
Haemorrhage 
Severe haemorrhage, sometimes fatal, has been observed with cabozantinib. Patients who have evidence of 
involvement of the trachea or bronchi by tumour or a history of haemoptysis prior to treatment initiation 
should be carefully evaluated before initiating cabozantinib therapy. Cabozantinib should not be 
administered to patients with serious haemorrhage or recent haemoptysis. 
Aneurysms and artery dissections 
The use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the formation of 
aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating cabozantinib, this risk should be carefully considered 
in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders  
Diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, decreased appetite, and stomatitis/oral pain were some of the most commonly 
reported GI adverse reactions (see section 4.8). Prompt medical management, including supportive care with 
antiemetics, antidiarrhoeals, or antacids, should be instituted to prevent dehydration, electrolyte imbalances 
and weight loss. Dose interruption or reduction, or permanent discontinuation of cabozantinib should be 
considered in case of persistent or recurrent significant GI adverse reactions (see section 4.2).

Wound complications 
Wound complications have been observed with cabozantinib. Cabozantinib treatment should be stopped at 
least 28 days prior to scheduled surgery, including dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. 
The decision to resume cabozantinib therapy after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate 
wound healing. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients with wound healing complications requiring 
medical intervention. 
Hypertension 
Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been observed with cabozantinib. Blood pressure should be 
well-controlled prior to initiating cabozantinib. After cabozantinib initiation blood pressure should be 
monitored early and regularly and treated as needed with appropriate anti-hypertensive therapy. In the case 
of persistent hypertension despite use of anti-hypertensives, the cabozantinib treatment should be interrupted 
until blood pressure is controlled, after which cabozantinib can be resumed at a reduced dose. Cabozantinib 
should be discontinued if hypertension is severe and persistent despite anti-hypertensive therapy and dose 
reduction of cabozantinib. In case of hypertensive crisis, cabozantinib should be discontinued. 
Osteonecrosis 
Events of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) have been observed with cabozantinib. An oral examination should 
be performed prior to initiation of cabozantinib and periodically during cabozantinib therapy. Patients should 
be advised regarding oral hygiene practice. Cabozantinib treatment should be held at least 28 days prior to 
scheduled dental surgery or invasive dental procedures, if possible. Caution should be used in patients 
receiving agents associated with ONJ, such as bisphosphonates. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in 
patients who experience ONJ. 
Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome  
Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (PPES) has been observed with cabozantinib. When PPES is 
severe, interruption of treatment with cabozantinib should be considered. Cabozantinib should be restarted 
with a lower dose when PPES has been resolved to grade 1. 
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria has been observed with cabozantinib. Urine protein should be monitored regularly during 
cabozantinib treatment. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been observed with cabozantinib. PRES should be 
considered in any patient presenting with symptoms suggestive of the diagnosis, including seizures, 
headache, visual disturbances, confusion or altered mental function. Cabozantinib treatment should be 
discontinued in patients with PRES. 
Prolongation of QT interval 
Cabozantinib should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, patients who 
are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte 
disturbances. When using cabozantinib, periodic monitoring with on-treatment ECGs and electrolytes (serum 
calcium, potassium, and magnesium) should be considered. Concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors, which may increase cabozantinib plasma concentrations, should be used with caution. 
CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors 
Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor ketoconazole resulted in an increase in cabozantinib plasma exposure. Caution is required when 
administering cabozantinib with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Concurrent administration of 
cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin resulted in a decrease in cabozantinib plasma 
exposure. Therefore chronic administration of agents that are strong CYP3A4 inducers with cabozantinib 
should be avoided (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
P-glycoprotein substrates  
Cabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transport 
activities in a bi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. Subjects should be 
cautioned regarding taking a P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, dabigatran etexilate, 
digoxin, colchicine, maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan) while 
receiving cabozantinib. 
MRP2 inhibitors 
Administration of MRP2 inhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations. Therefore, 
concomitant use of MRP2 inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine, efavirenz, emtricitabine) should be approached with 
caution. 
Excipient 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Effect of other medicinal products on cabozantinib 
CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers 
Administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole (400 mg daily for 27 days) to healthy 
volunteers decreased cabozantinib clearance (by 29%) and increased single-dose plasma cabozantinib 
exposure (AUC) by 38%. Therefore co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, 
itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice) with cabozantinib should be approached with 
caution.  
Administration of the strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (600 mg daily for 31 days) to healthy volunteers 
increased cabozantinib clearance (4.3-fold) and decreased single-dose plasma cabozantinib exposure (AUC) 
by 77%. Chronic co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, 
phenobarbital or herbal preparations containing St. John’s Wort [Hypericum perforatum]) with cabozantinib 
should therefore be avoided.  
Gastric pH modifying agents 
Co-administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole (40 mg daily for 6 days) with a single dose 
of 100 mg cabozantinib to healthy volunteers resulted in no clinically-significant effect on plasma 
cabozantinib exposure (AUC). No dose adjustment is indicated when gastric pH modifying agents (i.e., PPIs, 
H2 receptor antagonists, and antacids) are co-administered with cabozantinib. 
MRP2 inhibitors 
In vitro data demonstrate that cabozantinib is a substrate of MRP2. Therefore, administration of MRP2 
inhibitors may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations.  
Bile salt-sequestering agents 
Bile salt-sequestering agents such as cholestyramine and cholestagel may interact with cabozantinib and may 
impact absorption (or reabsorption) resulting in potentially decreased exposure (see section 5.2). The clinical 
significance of these potential interactions is unknown. 
Effect of cabozantinib on other medicinal products 
The effect of cabozantinib on the pharmacokinetics of contraceptive steroids has not been investigated. As 
unchanged contraceptive effect may not be guaranteed, an additional contraceptive method, such as a barrier 
method, is recommended. 
Because of high plasma protein binding levels of cabozantinib (section 5.2) a plasma protein displacement 
interaction with warfarin may be possible. In case of such combination, INR values should be monitored. 
P-glycoprotein substrates  
Cabozantinib was an inhibitor (IC50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P-gp transport activities in a 
bi-directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the potential to 
increase plasma concentrations of co-administered substrates of P-gp. Subjects should be cautioned 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
regarding taking a P-gp substrate (e.g., fexofenadine, aliskiren, ambrisentan, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, 
colchicine, maraviroc, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan) while receiving 
cabozantinib. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential must be advised to avoid pregnancy while on cabozantinib. Female 
partners of male patients taking cabozantinib must also avoid pregnancy. Effective methods of contraception 
should be used by male and female patients and their partners during therapy, and for at least 4 months after 
completing therapy. Because oral contraceptives might possibly not be considered as “effective methods of 
contraception,” they should be used together with another method, such as a barrier method (see section 4.5). 
Pregnancy 
There are no studies in pregnant women using cabozantinib. Studies in animals have shown embryo-foetal 
and teratogenic effects (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Cabozantinib should not 
be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with cabozantinib. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether cabozantinib and/or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because of the 
potential harm to the infant, mothers should discontinue breast-feeding during treatment with cabozantinib, 
and for at least 4 months after completing therapy. 
Fertility 
There are no data on human fertility. Based on non-clinical safety findings, male and female fertility may be 
compromised by treatment with cabozantinib (see section 5.3). Both men and women should be advised to 
seek advice and consider fertility preservation before treatment. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Cabozantinib has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Adverse reactions such as fatigue 
and weakness have been associated with cabozantinib.  Therefore, caution should be recommended when 
driving or operating machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
The most common serious adverse reactions associated with cabozantinib are pneumonia, mucosal 
inflammation, hypocalcaemia, dysphagia, dehydration, pulmonary embolism, and hypertension. The most 
frequent adverse reactions of any grade (experienced by at least 20% of patients) included diarrhoea, PPES, 
weight decreased, decreased appetite, nausea, fatigue, dysgeusia, hair colour changes, hypertension, 
stomatitis, constipation, vomiting, mucosal inflammation, asthenia, and dysphonia. 
The most common laboratory abnormalities were increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lymphopenia, hypocalcaemia, 
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hypophosphatemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypomagnesaemia, and 
hypokalaemia.

g Hypotension and blood pressure decreased. 
h No hypertensive crisis was reported in Cometriq clinical trials; the frequency is based on pooled cabozantinib data 
(including Cabometyx 60 mg tablet data). 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
A thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value above normal after first dose was observed in 57% of patients 
on cabozantinib versus 19% of patients on placebo (regardless of baseline values). Ninety-two percent of 
patients on the cabozantinib arm had a prior thyroidectomy, and 89% were taking thyroid hormones prior to 
first dose. 
An increase from baseline in corrected QT interval by Fridericia (QTcF) of 10 - 15 ms on Day 29 (but not on 
Day 1) following initiation of cabozantinib treatment (at a dose of 140 mg qd) was observed in a controlled 
clinical study in cancer patients (see section 4.4). This effect was not associated with a change in cardiac 
wave form morphology or new rhythms. No cabozantinib-treated subjects had a QTcF >500 ms. 
Please refer to section 4.4 for recommendations about the monitoring and management of the following 
adverse events: perforations, fistulas, and intra-abdominal abscesses; thromboembolic events; haemorrhage; 
aneurysms and artery dissections; gastrointestinal disorders; wound complications; hypertension; 
osteonecrosis; palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome; proteinuria; and posterior reversible 
encephalopathy syndrome.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no specific treatment for cabozantinib overdose and possible symptoms of overdose have not been 
established. 
In the event of suspected overdose, cabozantinib should be withheld and supportive care instituted. 
Metabolic clinical laboratory parameters should be monitored at least weekly or as deemed clinically 
appropriate to assess any possible changing trends. Adverse reactions associated with overdose are to be 
treated symptomatically.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agent, protein kinase inhibitor, ATC code: L01EX07. 
Mechanism of action 
Cabozantinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in 
tumour growth and angiogenesis, pathologic bone remodelling, and metastatic progression of cancer. 
Cabozantinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases and was identified as an 
inhibitor of MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor protein) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
receptors. In addition, cabozantinib inhibits other tyrosine kinases including RET, the GAS6 receptor (AXL), 
the stem cell factor receptor (KIT), and Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3).    
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Cabozantinib exhibited dose-related tumour growth inhibition, tumour regression, and/or inhibited metastasis 
in a broad range of preclinical tumour models. 
Efficacy with cabozantinib was observed in medullary thyroid cancer patients with wild-type or mutant RET. 
Clinical data in medullary thyroid cancer 
A multi-center, randomised double-blind study comparing cabozantinib (N = 219) with placebo (N = 111) 
was conducted in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC and documented 
radiographic disease progression within 14 months prior to study entry. The primary objective was to 
compare progression-free survival (PFS) in patients receiving cabozantinib versus patients receiving placebo. 
The secondary objectives were to compare overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). 
Centralized, independent, blinded review of the imaging data was used in the assessment of PFS and ORR. 
Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
The result of the PFS analysis, based on the central review RECIST assessment, demonstrated a statistically 
significant difference in the duration of PFS with cabozantinib versus placebo: the median duration was 
11.2 months for subjects in the cabozantinib arm versus 4.0 months for subjects in the placebo arm (stratified 
Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.40; p<0.0001; Figure 1). The PFS results were consistent across 
all baseline and demographic subgroups evaluated, including prior therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(which may have consisted of agents targeting pathways associated with anti-angiogenesis), RET mutational 
status (including subjects documented not to have RET mutations), prior anticancer or radiotherapy status, or 
the existence of bone metastases. 
The ORR was 27.9% and 0% for subjects in the cabozantinib arm and placebo arm, respectively (p<0.0001; 
Table 2). The median duration of objective responses was 14.6 months (95% CI: 11.1, 17.5) for subjects in 
the cabozantinib arm.

The final analysis of OS was conducted after 218 events (deaths) occurred and shows a trend for an increase 
in median survival of 5.5 months in the cabozantinib arm: median (months) 26.6 cabozantinib vs. 
21.1 placebo (HR = 0.85 [95% CI: 0.64, 1.12], p = 0.2409).

RET mutation status 
Of the 215 subjects with sufficient data to determine mutational status, 78.6% (n=169) were classified as 
RET mutation positive (126 of which were positive for the M918T mutation), and 21.4% (n=46) were 
classified as RET mutation negative. For an additional 115 subjects the RET mutational status could not be 
determined or was unclear. All three subgroups showed increased PFS in the cabozantinib arm compared to 
the placebo arm (HRs of 0.23, 0.53, and 0.30 for RET mutation positive, negative, and unknown subgroups, 
respectively). The objective response rates measured in these subgroups were generally consistent with the 
PFS results, with the RET mutation positive, negative, and unknown subgroups showing tumour response 
rates of 32%, 22%, and 25%, respectively. 
Further genetic analysis showed that a small proportion of patients harboured somatic tumour mutations in 
HRAS, KRAS, or NRAS. These patients (n=16) showed significant prolongation of PFS (HR of 0.15) and an 
objective response rate of 31%. RET mutation negative patients with no evidence of RAS mutation (n=33) 
showed a decreased PFS benefit on cabozantinib (HR of 0.87) and a lower response rate of 18% compared to 
other mutational subgroups. 
A significant improvement in OS was observed in the subgroup of RET M918T mutation positive patients 
(n=81/219 cabozantinib arm): 44.3 months in the cabozantinib arm vs. 18.9 months in the placebo arm 
(HR = 0.60, p = 0.0255). There was no improvement in OS for the RET M918T negative and unknown 
subgroups.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
cabozantinib in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of malignant solid tumours 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of cabozantinib, peak cabozantinib plasma concentrations are reached at 2 to 
5 hours post-dose. Plasma-concentration time profiles show a second absorption peak approximately 
24 hours after administration, which suggests that cabozantinib may undergo enterohepatic recirculation. 
Repeat daily dosing of cabozantinib at 140 mg for 19 days resulted in an approximately a 4- to 5-fold mean 
cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared to a single dose administration; steady state is 
achieved by approximately Day 15.   
A high-fat meal moderately increased Cmax and AUC values (41% and 57%, respectively) relative to fasted 
conditions in healthy volunteers administered a single 140 mg oral cabozantinib dose. There is no 
information on the precise food-effect when taken 1 hour after administration of cabozantinib. 
Bioequivalence could not be demonstrated between the cabozantinib capsule and tablet formulations 
following a single 140 mg dose in healthy subjects. A 19% increase in the Cmax of the tablet formulation 
(CABOMETYX) compared to the capsule formulation (COMETRIQ) was observed. AUC were similar 
between cabozantinib tablet (CABOMETYX) and capsule (COMETRIQ) formulations (<10% difference). 
Distribution 
Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in vitro in human plasma (≥ 99.7%). Based on the population-
pharmacokinetic (PK) model, the volume of distribution (V/F) is approximately 349 L (SE: ± 2.73%). 
Protein binding was not altered in subjects with mild or moderately impaired renal or hepatic function. 
Biotransformation 
Cabozantinib was metabolized in vivo. Four metabolites were present in plasma at exposures (AUC) greater 
than 10% of parent: XL184-N-oxide, XL184 amide cleavage product, XL184 monohydroxy sulfate, and 
6-desmethyl amide cleavage product sulfate. Two non-conjugated metabolites (XL184-N-oxide and XL184 
amide cleavage product), which possess <1% of the on-target kinase inhibition potency of parent 
cabozantinib, each represent <10% of total drug-related plasma exposure. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cabozantinib is a substrate for CYP3A4 metabolism in vitro, as a neutralizing antibody to CYP3A4 inhibited 
formation of metabolite XL184 N-oxide by >80% in a NADPH-catalyzed human liver microsomal (HLM) 
incubation; in contrast, neutralizing antibodies to CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. A neutralizing antibody to 
CYP2C9 showed a minimal effect on cabozantinib metabolite formation (ie, a <20% reduction). 
Elimination 
The plasma terminal half-life of cabozantinib in single dose studies in healthy volunteers is approximately 
120 hours. Mean clearance (CL/F) at steady-state in cancer patients was estimated to be 4.4 L/hr in a 
population PK analysis. Within a 48-day collection period after a single dose of 14C-cabozantinib in healthy 
volunteers, approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered with 54% in faeces and 
27% in urine.  
Pharmacokinetics in special patient populations 
Renal impairment 
Results from a study in patients with renal impairment indicate that the ratios of geometric LS mean for 
plasma cabozantinib, Cmax and AUC0-inf were 19% and 30% higher, for subjects with mild renal impairment 
(90% CI for Cmax 91.60% to 155.51%; AUC0-inf 98.79% to 171.26%) and 2% and 6-7% higher (90% CI for 
Cmax 78.64% to 133.52%; AUC0-inf 79.61% to 140.11%), for subjects with moderate renal impairment, 
compared to subjects with normal renal function. Patients with severe renal impairment have not been 
studied. 
Hepatic impairment 
Results from a study in patients with hepatic impairment indicate that exposure (AUC0-inf) increased by 81% 
and 63% in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively (90% CI for AUC0-inf: 
121.44% to 270.34% for mild and 107.37% to 246.67% for moderate). Patients with severe hepatic 
impairment have not been studied. 
Race 
No data are available to determine a difference in PK based on race. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical 
exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows: 
In rat and dog repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 6 months duration, target organs for toxicity were GI tract, 
bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, kidney, adrenal and reproductive tract tissues. The no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) for these findings were below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic 
dose. 
Cabozantinib has shown no mutagenic or clastogenic potential in a standard battery of genotoxicity assays. 
The carcinogenic potential of cabozantinib has been evaluated in two species: rasH2 transgenic mice and 
Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study, cabozantinib-related neoplastic findings 
consisted of an increased incidence of benign pheochromocytoma, alone or in combination with malignant 
pheochromocytoma/complex malignant pheochromocytoma of the adrenal medulla in both sexes at 
exposures well below the intended exposure in humans. The clinical relevance of the observed neoplastic 
lesions in rats is uncertain, but likely to be low. Cabozantinib was not carcinogenic in the rasH2 mouse 
model at a slightly higher exposure than the intended human therapeutic exposure.  
Fertility studies in rats have shown reduced male and female fertility. Further, hypospermatogenesis was 
observe in male dogs at exposure levels below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic dose.  
Embryo-foetal development studies were performed in rats and rabbits. In rats, cabozantinib caused 
postimplantation loss, foetal oedema, cleft palate/lip, dermal aplasia and kinked or rudimentary tail. In 
rabbits, cabozantinib produced foetal soft tissue changes (reduced spleen size, small or missing intermediate 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lung lobe) and increased foetal incidence of total malformations. NOAEL for embryo-foetal toxicity and 
teratogenic findings were below human clinical exposure levels at intended therapeutic dose.   
Juvenile rats (comparable to a >2 year old pediatric population) administered cabozantinib showed increased 
WBC parameters, decreased haematopoiesis, pubescent/immature female reproductive system (without 
delayed vaginal opening), tooth abnormalities, reduced bone mineral content and density, liver pigmentation 
and bile duct hyperplasia. Findings in uterus/ovaries and decreased haematopoiesis appeared to be transient, 
while effects on bone parameters and liver pigmentation were sustained. Evaluations in juvenile rats 
(comparable to a <2 year old pediatric population) have not been performed.

Read all of this leaflet carefully before you start taking this medicine because it contains important 
information for you. 
-  Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again.  
- 
-  This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
- 
if their signs of illness are the same as yours.

1.  What COMETRIQ is and what it is used for 
What COMETRIQ is 
COMETRIQ is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance cabozantinib (S)-malate.  
It is a medicine used to treat medullary thyroid cancer, a rare type of thyroid cancer, that cannot be removed 
by surgery or that has spread to other parts of the body.  
How COMETRIQ works 
COMETRIQ blocks the action of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are involved in the 
growth of cells and the development of new blood vessels that supply them. These proteins can be present in 
high amounts in cancer cells, and by blocking their action COMETRIQ can slow down the rate at which the 
tumour grows and help to cut off the blood supply that the cancer needs. 
COMETRIQ may slow or stop the growth of medullary thyroid cancer. It may help shrink tumours 
associated with this type of cancer. 
2.  What you need to know before you take COMETRIQ 
Do not take COMETRIQ 
- 
if you are allergic to cabozantinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking COMETRIQ if you: 
-   have high blood pressure 
- 
have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a tear in a 
blood vessel wall.

You should also tell your dentist that you are taking COMETRIQ. It is important for you to practice good 
mouth care during treatment with COMETRIQ. 
Children and adolescents 
COMETRIQ is not recommended for children or adolescents. The effects of COMETRIQ in people younger 
than 18 years old are not known. 
Other medicines and COMETRIQ 
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. This is because COMETRIQ can affect the way some other 
medicines work. Also, some medicines can affect the way COMETRIQ works. This could mean that your 
doctor needs to change the dose(s) that you take.  
-  Medicines that treat fungal infections, such as itraconazole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole 
-  Medicines used to treat bacterial infections (antibiotics) such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, and

Oral contraceptives 
If you take COMETRIQ whilst using oral contraceptives, the oral contraceptives may be ineffective. You 
should also use a barrier contraceptive (e.g. condom or diaphragm) whilst taking COMETRIQ and for at 
least 4 months after treatment has finished. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Taking COMETRIQ with food 
Avoid consuming grapefruit-containing products for as long as you are using this medicine, as it may 
increase the levels of COMETRIQ in your blood. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding, and fertility  
Avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with COMETRIQ. If you or your partner could become 
pregnant, use adequate contraception during treatment and for at least 4 months after treatment has finished. 
Talk to your doctor about which methods of contraception are appropriate while you are taking COMETRIQ. 
See section 2. 
Tell your doctor if you or your partner become pregnant or plan to become pregnant while you are being 
treated with COMETRIQ.  
Talk to your doctor BEFORE taking COMETRIQ if you or your partner are considering or planning to 
have a baby after your treatment has finished.  There is a possibility your fertility could be affected by 
treatment with COMETRIQ.  
Women taking COMETRIQ should not breast feed during treatment and for at least 4 months after treatment 
has finished, as cabozantinib and/or its metabolites may be excreted in breast milk and be harmful to your 
child. 
Driving and using machines 
Use caution when driving or using machines. Keep in mind that treatment with COMETRIQ may make you 
feel tired or weak. 
COMETRIQ contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. 
3. 
How to take COMETRIQ 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
You should continue to take this medicine until your doctor decides to stop your treatment.  If you 
experience serious side effects, your doctor may decide to change your dose or stop treatment earlier than 
originally planned. Your doctor will determine if you need your dose adjusted, particularly during the first 
eight weeks of therapy with COMETRIQ. 
COMETRIQ should be taken once a day. Depending on the dose you were prescribed, the number of 
capsules to take are as follows: 
•  140 mg (1 orange 80 mg capsule and 3 grey 20 mg capsules)  
•  100 mg (1 orange 80 mg capsule and 1 grey 20 mg capsule) 
•  60 mg (3 grey 20 mg capsules)  
Your doctor will decide on the right dose for you. 
Your capsules will come in a blister card organised by prescribed dose. Each blister card has enough 
capsules to last for seven days (one week).  Your capsules are also available as a 28 day pack, which contains 
enough capsules to last for 28 days, in 4 blister cards with seven days of capsules on each card. 
Each day, take all the capsules across the row. More information on the blister cards including how many 
capsules you will take and how many capsules there are in total in each blister card are described below in

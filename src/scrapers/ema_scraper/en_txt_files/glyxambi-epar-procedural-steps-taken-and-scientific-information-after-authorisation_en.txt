Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC in 
Synjardi’s SmPC and Package Leaflet with that of 
Jardiance’s, following the approval of Jardiance in the 
treatment of heart failure.  
This indication was based on the submission of data from 
trials EMPEROR-Preserved and EMPEROR-Reduced trial, in 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

mg to 4 mg: 3010) and followed for a median of 6.25 
years. The mean age was 64 years, the mean HbA1c was

population had an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The study 
was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority for the 
primary cardiovascular endpoint which was a composite of 
the first occurrence of cardiovascular death or a non-fatal 
myocardial infarction (MI) or a non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE). 
Linagliptin did not increase the risk of the combined 
endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or 
non-fatal stroke (MACE-3) [Hazard Ratio (HR)=0.98; (95 %

from the trial 1245.25, which analysed the effect of the 
empagliflozin component of Glyxambi on cardiovascular 
outcomes in patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular 
risk. The adverse drug reaction ‘thirst’ was added with a 
frequency of common based on post-marketing data from 
empagliflozin. Several minor changes to the SmPC were 
added to align with changes introduced for the SmPCs of 
Jardiance/Synjardy (empagliflozin) and 
Trajenta/Jentadueto (linagliptin). Section 4.4 was also 
updated to add a warning on the risk of lower limb 
amputations of SGLT2 inhibitors as follows: an increase in 
cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has 
been observed in ongoing long-term clinical studies with 
another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this 
constitutes a class effect. Like for all diabetic patients it is

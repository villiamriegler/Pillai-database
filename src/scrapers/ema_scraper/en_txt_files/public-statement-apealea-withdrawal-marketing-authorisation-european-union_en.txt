Apealea (paclitaxel) 
Withdrawal of the marketing authorisation in the European Union 
On 9 February 2024, the European Commission withdrew the marketing authorisation for Apealea 
(paclitaxel) in the European Union (EU). The withdrawal was at the request of the marketing 
authorisation holder, Inceptua AB, which notified the European Commission of its decision to 
permanently discontinue the marketing of the product for commercial reasons.  
Apealea was granted marketing authorisation in the EU on 20 November 2018 for the treatment of 
ovarian cancer. The marketing authorisation was initially valid for a 5-year period. It was then granted 
unlimited validity in 2023.  
The European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) for Apealea will be updated to indicate that the 
marketing authorisation is no longer valid.  
Therapeutic alternatives are available throughout the European Union. Patients taking Apealea or 
participating in a clinical trial are advised to consult their doctor. 
The European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) for Apealea will be updated to indicate that the 
marketing authorisation is no longer valid.

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated and therefore recommends the 
renewal of the conditional MA for Dovprela, subject to the 
Specific Obligations and Conditions as laid down in Annex II 
to the opinion.

Update of sections 4.5 and 5.3 of the SmPC based on 
data from three non-clinical studies: 
- Assessment of pretomanid as an inhibitor of human 
OCT2-, OATP1B3-, BCRP-, and P-gp mediated 
transport; 
- In vitro evaluation of induction/inhibition of CYP 
2C8, 2C9, and 2C19 in human hepatocytes;

Rats.

“4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other 
forms of interaction 
Effects of pretomanid on other medicinal products 
[…] 
Effect on CYP2C8, 2C9 and 2C19 substrates 
In vitro studies show that pretomanid is an inducer of 
CYP2C8 while the studies are inconclusive regarding the 
potential of pretomanid to induce CYP2C9 and 2C19. In 
vivo induction cannot be excluded as no clinical studies 
have been performed. If pretomanid is co-administered 
with substrates of CYP2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, e.g., paclitaxel, 
warfarin, mephenytoin, prescribers and their patients 
should be observant for potentially reduced efficacy of 
these substrates. 
Effect on OAT3, OATP1B3, P-gp and BCRP substrates 
Pretomanid is an inhibitor of the OAT3 transporter in vitro, 
which could result in increased concentrations of OAT3 
substrate medicinal products clinically and may increase 
the risk of adverse reactions of these medicines. If 
pretomanid is co-administered with OAT3 substrate 
medicinal products (e.g., methotrexate, benzylpenicillin, 
indomethacin, ciprofloxacin), monitoring for OAT3 substrate 
drug-related adverse reactions should be performed and 
dosage reductions for OAT3 substrate medicinal product 
should be considered, if needed (see section 4.4).  
In vitro studies indicate that pretomanid is an inhibitor of 
BCRP, OATP1B3 and P-gp. No clinical studies have been 
performed to investigate these interactions. Therefore, it 
cannot be excluded that co administration of pretomanid 
Page 4/6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with sensitive OATP1B3 substrates (e.g., valsartan, 
statins), BCRP substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin, prazosin, 
glyburide, sulfasalazine) and P-gp substrates (e.g. digoxin, 
dabigatran etexilate, verapamil) may increase their 
exposure. If pretomanid is co-administered with substrates 
of OATP1B3, BCRP or P-gp, monitoring for drug-related 
adverse reactions to the co-administered medicinal product 
should be performed 
5.3 
Preclinical safety data 
[…] 
 In addition, in a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, 
pretomanid resulted in an increased incidence of cataracts 
at 10 mg/kg/day, resulting in an exposure in the same 
range as at the MRHD. The clinical relevance of this finding 
is unknown. 
[…] 
In a 2-year study in rats, an increased incidence of Leydig 
cell adenomas was observed at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. 
The observation is likely of limited relevance to humans.”

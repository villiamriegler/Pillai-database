2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Epilepsy is a heterogeneous and serious brain disorder characterised by the occurrence of recurrent or a high 
risk of recurrent unprovoked, spontaneous seizures. Amongst the estimated 50 million people worldwide 
affected by epilepsy, more than 50% have partial-onset seizures (POS). POS are initially confined to a 
discrete area of the cerebral cortex, but may spread to involve both cerebral hemispheres resulting in a 
secondary generalisation. POS can manifest as motor, sensory, automatic or psychic symptoms and, in case 
of secondary generalisation, as absences, tonic, clonic, tonic-clonic, myoclonic or tonic seizures.  
Based on the 1981 Classification by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), which is still widely 
used, POS can be divided in 3 different seizure subtypes, including Type IA (simple partial seizures) and IB 
(complex partial seizures), depending on whether consciousness is affected, as well as IC (with secondary 
generalised tonic-clonic convulsions). In a more recent revised operational classification by ILAE (2017), the 
term focal seizures is preferred over POS and focal seizures, which may or may not evolve to generalised 
tonic-clonic seizures, are further characterised by awareness versus impaired awareness and motor versus 
non-motor onset. 
According to relevant treatment guidelines (e.g. ILAE, United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence, etc) first line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed POS consists of monotherapy with an 
anti-epileptic drug (AED). Approximately 60% of epilepsy patients manage to attain long-term seizure 
freedom on a single AED (Stephen, 2012) and this is the primary treatment objective. The remaining 
patients require adjunctive treatment, which is usually applied after two failed monotherapies.  
Traditionally, AEDs are first studied in add-on trials in refractory epilepsy patients. As a result, clinical testing 
and approval for monotherapies in newly diagnosed patients often occurs years after development in the 
adjuvant setting. Monotherapy of epilepsy can give certain advantages for patients when compared with 
adjunctive therapy including improved patient compliance as well as a decreased risk for drug interactions 
and better tolerability. There remains a therapeutic need for additional monotherapy options. 
Eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093, ESL) acts as a voltage-gated sodium channel blocker which 
competitively interacts with site 2 of the inactivated state of the channel. It is a third-generation, 
single-enantiomer member of the long-established family of first-line dibenz/b,f/azepine AEDs represented 
by carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine. 
ESL is the active substance of Zebinix which was approved in the European Union/European Economic Area 
through the Centralised Procedure by Commission Decision in 2009 as adjunctive therapy in adults with POS 
with or without secondary generalisation. The indication was later extended for adjunctive therapy of POS in 
children aged more than 6 years. Zebinix is available as immediate release tablets containing 200 mg, 
400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg of ESL and as an oral suspension (50 mg/ml). The recommended starting dose 
in adults for add-on therapy is 400 mg once daily which should be increased to 800 mg once daily after one 
or two weeks. Based on individual response, the dose may be further increased to 1,200 mg once daily. 
Children weighing less than 60 kg are dosed based on their weight. 
In the present application, the MAH proposed to extend the indication to monotherapy of adult with POS with 
or without secondary generalisation at doses up to 1600 mg/day. To support the application, the MAH 
submitted the results of a Phase 3 clinical trial (BIA-2093-311, henceforth referred to as study 311). 
Furthermore, supportive safety data were provided from 2 identically designed conversion-to-monotherapy 
studies (studies 093-045 and 093-046, henceforth referred to as studies 045 and 046).

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. An updated environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been provided. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated ERA was provided taking into account the proposed new extended target population. The same 
EPAR has previously been reviewed and was accepted in procedure EMEA/H/C/000988/X/0050/G. A refined 
market penetration factor (Fpen) of 0.001 was calculated for the purpose of the Phase II Tier A assessment 
based on the prevalence of POS in both adults and paediatric patients using epidemiological data by 
Forsgren et al. (2005) and Giussani et al. (2014) as well as sales forecast data in the five largest EU countries 
resulting in a market share of 27.27%. Based on the new proposed maximum maintenance dose of ESL 
1600 mg/day in POS monotherapy, the predicted environmental concentration in surface water (PECsw) was 
refined at 0.688 μg/L. Using an assessment factor of 100, and a Predicted No-Effect Concentration for the 
sediment compartment (PNECsediment) of 1µg/L (Goodband and Mullee, 2011), the resulting risk quotient was 
0.688, which is below the trigger value of 1. 
Based on the updated ERA, ESL is not expected to pose a risk to the environment, when used according to 
the approved indication and posology.  
2.2.2.  Discussion on the non-clinical aspects 
As previously shown during the initial marketing authorisation application of Zebinix as adjunctive therapy of 
POS in adult patients, ESL is rapidly hydrolysed in humans thus not yielding measurable plasma 
concentrations while there is a measurable exposure in animal studies. Exposure to eslicarbazepine, the 
main active metabolite of ESL, at the identified No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) in all animal 
species tested, were below those achieved in man. In man, the area under the plasma concentration-time 
curve (AUC) value for eslicarbazepine at a dose of 800 mg per day was 268.38 μg.h/mL (males) as 
compared to 136.13/104.74, 0.98/3.36 and 29.99/33.12 μg.h/mL (male/female animals) at the NOAELs of 
150, 20 and 40 mg/kg/day in mice, rats and dogs, respectively. Hence, no safety margins towards human 
exposure could be calculated.  
This finding was considered to be equally applicable for the present application including the new proposed 
maximum dose for monotherapy (ESL 1600 mg/day). Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no new non-clinical 
data were needed in support of this application. 
With regards to ERA, based on the updated data, Zebinix is not expected to pose a risk to the environment 
when used according to the SmPC. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP concluded that no new non-clinical data were needed in order to support the present application. 
With regards to the updated ERA, ESL is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. Altogether, the 
application was considered acceptable from a non-clinical perspective. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
The MAH confirmed that the clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP. 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 8/71 
 
  
  
  
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.     
Table 1 - Tabular overview of clinical studies 
AED = anti-epileptic Drug; BID = twice daily; CBZ-CR = carbamazepine controlled-release; DB = double-blind; ESL = 
eslicarbazepine acetate; OL = open-label; QD = once daily 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling has been performed in pivotal monotherapy study 311. Blood 
samples (10 mL) for measurement of eslicarbazepine (BIA 2-194), the main active metabolite of ESL, and 
the CBZ levels were drawn at Visit 2 (A2/B2/C2), Visit 4 (A4/B4/C4) and Last Extension Phase Visit (day of 
stop of treatment). See section 2.4.2. for an overview of the study design. 
The levels of CBZ in human plasma study samples from study 311 were determined by validated high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with mass MS/MS detection. The method was found 
suitable for the determination of CBZ in human plasma in the range from 20.0 to 20000 ng/mL. The levels 
of BIA 2-194 (eslicarbazepine) in human plasma study samples were determined by validated chiral HPLC 
method with triple-stage quadrupole MS/MS detection. The method was found suitable for the determination 
of BIA 2-194 in human plasma in the range from 50.0 to 25000 ng/mL. 
The results of the analysis of exposure to eslicarbazepine and CBZ by visit and dose level are presented in

Figure 2 – CBZ plasma levels by visit and correspondent dose levels in Study 311 
Plasma exposure to eslicarbazepine increased in dose-dependent manner [median plasma levels were 
12400 ng/mL, 16300 ng/mL, and 21900 ng/mL for ESL QD doses of 800 mg, 1200 mg, and 1600 mg QD, 
respectively]. Likewise, plasma exposure to carbamazepine increased in a dose-dependent manner [median 
plasma levels were 4970 ng/mL, 6380 ng/mL, and 8810 ng/mL for CBZ BID doses of 200 mg, 400 mg, and 
800 mg, respectively]. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the bioanalytical methods of CBZ and eslicarbazepine determination in human plasma were 
considered to have been successfully validated. Validation was generally performed in accordance with the 
requirements of the EMA Guideline on bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 
1 Corr. 2).  
Sparse plasma sampling was performed in study 311. The data, although sparse, confirmed dose 
proportionality of eslicarbazepine exposure, and also show mild increase in plasma concentrations over the 
time period between visits. While a direct comparison between mono- and add-on therapy is biased due to 
the presence of other concomitant AEDs in the add-on therapy setting and since for data from sparse 
sampling, some variability can be anticipated, the exposure in study 311 was similar to that previously 
reported in the add-on setting by means of simulated data from a population PK model (median 
eslicarbazepine plasma concentrations at steady state were ~10500 ng/mL for 800 mg, and ~15700 ng/mL 
for 1200 mg ESL). Exposure data for CBZ have also been presented, and seem to be in accordance with 
known PK properties of this active substance.

2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP concluded that the application was acceptable with regards to clinical pharmacology. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
To support this application, one pivotal phase 3 trial (study 311) was conducted to investigate the effect of 
ESL as monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed POS. In addition, supportive data from two identically 
designed conversion-to-monotherapy studies (study 045 and 046) were provided. 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose-response studies have been conducted within the POS monotherapy clinical development program. 
The dose range (ESL 800, 1200 and 1600 mg/day) investigated in the pivotal study 311 was selected on the 
basis of results from previous clinical studies, including Phase 3 studies in adults with partial-onset epilepsy 
in which ESL was used as add-on therapy. The results of these studies supported the use of ESL 800 and 
1200 mg once daily (QD). A dose of 400 mg was also investigated in 2 of the 3 Phase 3 studies but was not 
found to be effective. Consequently, ESL 800 mg QD was chosen as the lowest dose for study 311. ESL 
1600 mg was chosen by the MAH as the highest dose level in study 311 taking into account the tolerability 
profile in studies for other indications, namely bipolar disorder and neuropathic pain (studies BIA-2093-206, 
-207, 307 and 308). According to the MAH no particular safety concerns were found for this dose. Reference 
is furthermore made to safety data for ESL doses up to 2400 mg in healthy subjects and for ESL 
monotherapy in subjects with bipolar disorder, as well as published results of clinical studies with 
oxcarbazepine, a drug similar to ESL, in which better tolerability of higher doses in monotherapy as 
compared to adjunctive therapy was found.  
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study BIA-2093-311: Efficacy and safety of eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093) as 
monotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed partial-onset seizures: a double-blind, 
randomised, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre clinical study 
2.4.2.1.  Methods 
This was a phase 3, multinational, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled 
non-inferiority study conducted in adults (≥ 18 years) with newly diagnosed epilepsy experiencing POS. 
The study consisted of the following study phases:  
-  Screening period (1 week) 
- 
Titration period (1 week) 
-  Stabilisation period (1 week) 
- 
Evaluation period (26 weeks)  
-  Maintenance period (26 weeks) 
- 
Extension phase (blinded; including down-titration and follow-up, unless the subject continued with 
open-label treatment in the open-label extension study).

A1, B1, C1 = start of the 1-week Titration Period; A2-A4, B2-B4, C2-C4 = visits of the 26-week Evaluation Period; 
CBZ-CR = carbamazepine controlled-release; ESL = eslicarbazepine acetate; I = 1-week Titration Period; II = 1-week 
Stabilisation Period; MPV2 = last visit of the 26-week Maintenance Period; OL = open-label; V1 = Screening Visit. 
The study was designed with stepwise fixed dose increments based on individual response with 3 dose 
levels: 
• 
• 
• 
level A: ESL 800 mg QD, CBZ-CR 200 mg BID (400 mg/day),  
level B: ESL 1200 mg QD or CBZ-CR 400 mg BID (800 mg/day), and  
level C: ESL 1600 mg QD or CBZ-CR 600 mg BID (1200 mg/day).  
During the titration period, subjects received either ESL 400 mg QD or CBZ-CR 200 mg QD before increasing 
to the first target dose (dose level A: ESL 800 mg QD, CBZ-CR 200 mg BID). This was followed by a 1-week 
Stabilisation Period and a 26-week Evaluation Period.  
If a seizure occurred (after the respective titration and stabilisation period) during the Evaluation period at 
dose level A or B, respectively, subjects had their dose increased over a further titration period to the next 
higher dose level as soon as possible (within 7 days after the seizure), followed by a further stabilisation 
period. A seizure during titration or stabilisation period did not lead to changes in the scheduled doses. 
If a seizure occurred during the Evaluation period at the highest dose level (C), at any dose during the 
Maintenance Period or during the Extension Phase subjects were withdrawn from the study.  
Subjects who remained seizure-free for 26 weeks at any dose in the Evaluation Period continued to receive 
the allocated treatment under double-blind conditions during the 26-week Maintenance Period and 
subsequent Extension Phase until the database was locked. As soon as the end of the double-blind study was 
EMA/304195/2017

announced (when all recruited subjects who had not discontinued early, had attended either Visit A4, B4 or 
C4 and had been treated with double-blind investigational medicinal product for at least 54 weeks), subjects 
could be moved forward directly into the Extension phase, i.e. for these subjects the maintenance period 
was to be terminated early or skipped altogether.  
Subjects who benefit from treatment at the end of double-blind study were given the option to enrol in an 
extension study. This study was ongoing at the time of this application and no results had been provided.  
Study duration up to the end of the Main Treatment Phase: Minimum of 55 weeks (i.e. 54 weeks of 
treatment; for subjects who did not experience a seizure during evaluation/main period) to a maximum of 
111 weeks due to the escalation in dose if a seizure occurred.

Former or current use of any AED, except for the use of a single AED for a maximum duration of 2 
weeks before Visit 1.  
Previous regular use of ESL or CBZ (previous use as acute treatment for seizures in an emergency 
situation was not an exclusion criterion).  
•  Use of mono-amine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, nefazodone, isoniazid, or protease 
inhibitors or any other anti-retroviral agents (e.g. efavirez) that may have raised the levels of 
CBZ-CR.

Treatments 
Patients in study 311 received one of the following treatments 
•  Research therapy: 
- 
- 
ESL tablets, containing 400 or 800 mg ESL, commercial formulation. 
Placebo tablets as appropriate. 
•  Reference therapy:  
- 
Tegretol-CR tablets, containing 200 or 400 mg CBZ. 
-  Carbatrol-XR (extended release) tablets, containing 100 mg CBZ during titration period(s), as 
Tegretol-CR has no 100 mg formulation. 
- 
Placebo tablets as appropriate. 
Treatment was taken orally in the morning and in the evening, irrespective of meals, separated by 
approximately 12 hours. 
The 3 dose levels of ESL in study 311 were 800 mg/day, 1200 mg/day and 1600 mg/day.  
The 3 respective dose levels of the active comparator CBZ-CR were 400mg, 800 mg and 1200 mg/day.  
Dose reductions in case of tolerability issues were not allowed, except in the context of down-titration in 
order to stop treatment.  
Concomitant AED:  
Any AED was prohibited during the study, however, AEDs as rescue treatment for a seizure as well as 
up-dosing of a new AED within 7 days before the start of down-titration in the framework of early 
discontinuation or study completion (except ESL subjects continuing in the open-label extension part) were 
allowed and not considered a deviation. 
Rescue medication:  
Benzodiazepines could be used as rescue medication during the initial drug-free period of at least 5 days as 
needed, during the rest of the study no more than twice a week.  
Objectives 
The primary study objective was to demonstrate that monotherapy with ESL (800 to 1600 mg QD) was not 
inferior to monotherapy with controlled-release carbamazepine (CBZ-CR; 200-600 mg BID) in adults 
(≥ 18 years) with newly diagnosed epilepsy experiencing partial-onset seizures. 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 14/71 
 
  
  
  
Secondary objectives were to demonstrate the efficacy, safety and PK of ESL in this population at the doses 
used 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of subjects in the Per Protocol (PP) set who were classified 
as seizure-free for the entire 26-week Evaluation Period at the last evaluated dose level. Subjects who 
dropped out during this 26-week period were considered as non-seizure-free. Subjects who dropped out 
during the Titration/Stabilisation Period were considered as non-seizure-free at the last received dose level. 
Each subject was instructed to keep a seizure diary in their eDiary and record all seizures by date, time of 
occurrence and duration throughout the study. The subject was required to indicate whether or not a seizure 
had occurred on each day. 
Seizures recorded by subjects in the eDiaries as well as seizures identified by the investigator were used. 
Both sources were consolidated, however, in case of discrepancies the final decision was with the 
investigator.  
The secondary efficacy variables were: 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of seizure-free subjects during 1 year of treatment at the last evaluated dose. 
Time to first seizure at the last evaluated dose (treatment failure time). 
Time to treatment failure at the first evaluated dose, defined as the time of the first occurrence of 
1 of the following during the Evaluation or Maintenance Periods of dose level A:  
o  Seizure. 
o  Withdrawal of investigational medicinal product due to adverse events (AEs). 
o  Withdrawal of investigational medicinal product due to lack of efficacy.  
• 
Treatment retention time, defined as the time of the first occurrence of 1 of the following:  
o  Withdrawal of investigational medicinal product due to AEs.  
o  Withdrawal of investigational medicinal product due to lack of efficacy. 
•  Seizure type and duration of the first seizure during the Evaluation Period and all seizures that led to 
up-titration (i.e. the last seizure in the respective dose) and for the last seizure before 
discontinuation in any study period up to the end of the Evaluation Period. 
• 
• 
Time to withdrawal for any reason at the last evaluated dose.  
dose level at which subjects reached 26-week seizure freedom (dose-response relationship)  
•  Seizure rate during the Titration/Stabilisation Periods of dose level A, of any dose level and of last 
evaluated dose and during the Evaluation Period of the last evaluated dose. 
•  Changes in quality of life (QOL) assessed using the validated QOLIE-31 survey (final scores and 
T-scores for overall score, global assessment and subscores covering emotional well-being, social 
functioning, energy/fatigue, cognitive functioning, seizure worry, medication effects and overall 
QOL). Paper-based questionnaires were completed by the subjects. 
Sample size 
The sample size of 360 subjects per treatment group was estimated to have a power of at least 90% to 
establish non-inferiority of ESL compared to CBZ-CR using a non-inferiority margin of -12%, with the 
assumption that the proportion of subjects who were seizure free for 26 weeks was 60% for both 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 15/71 
 
  
  
  
treatments. In order to achieve 360 evaluable subjects per treatment group in the PP set (the primary 
analysis population) and assuming a rate of 20% of subjects would not qualify for the PP set, 450 subjects 
were initially planned to be randomised per treatment group. However, during the continuous monitoring of 
protocol violations, it appeared that the actual rates of subjects not qualifying for the PP set tended to be 
lower than estimated. The revised rate was estimated to be below 12%, and thus the minimal number of 
randomised subjects per treatment group was decreased to 407 subjects. 
Randomisation 
At Visit A1, subjects who met the selection criteria were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either ESL or 
CBZ-CR using Interactive Web Response System. The randomisation schedule linked sequential numbers to 
treatment codes allocated at random. Complete blocks were assigned dynamically to each study site to 
achieve balanced assignment of treatment groups within a site. A site stratified block randomisation was 
used with a block size of 4. Within each block, the same number of subjects was allocated to each of the 2 
treatment groups. The block size was not revealed to the site. 
Blinding (masking) 
Due to the different appearance of the ESL and CBZ-CR tablets, all tablets were identically 
over-encapsulated to ensure double-blind conditions. Treatment was taken orally in a double-blind setting 
with placebo tablets as appropriate.  
Investigational medicinal products were blinded and the randomisation schedule and the allocation to 
treatment groups were not known to the investigator, the sponsor or any other person involved in the 
conduct of the study, except in case of an emergency.  
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses were primarily presented for the PP set and the full analysis set (FAS) and the last 
evaluated pooled dose. Selected analyses were repeated for the PP Subset (SPP). 
• 
• 
FAS: Included all subjects randomised and treated with at least 1 dose of investigational medicinal 
product after randomisation. Following the intention-to-treat principle, all subjects were analysed 
according to the treatment group to which they were randomised. 
PP set: Included all subjects from the FAS excluding subjects with major protocol deviations. All 
subjects were analysed according to the treatment group to which they were randomised. 
•  SPP: Included all subjects of the PP set excluding all subjects withdrawn from the study before 
reaching the end of the 26-week Evaluation Period for any reasons not linked to efficacy. 
In general, continuous variables were summarised using descriptive statistics, i.e. number of subjects in the 
respective analysis sets, number of subjects with data, number of subjects with missing values, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile and maximum. 
Categorical variables were summarised using frequency counts and percentages. In addition, the number of 
subjects with missing values was presented. 
Events or therapies with an end date after the cut-off date were reported as ongoing as this was the status 
at the time of cut-off. 
The baseline value was defined as the last available measurement at or before the Baseline Day (defined as 
the day of first intake of dose level A). 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 16/71 
 
  
  
  
One primary analysis was planned for the study, to be performed after the primary endpoint was available 
for all subjects and the database was locked on 17-Nov-2015. The cut-off date for this analysis was 
24-Sep-2015. 
Non-inferiority (NI) of ESL to CBZ-CR for the proportion of subjects with 26-week seizure freedom was 
considered shown if the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval (CI) for absolute difference in proportions did 
not exceed the pre-specified NI margin of -12% in the PP set. This corresponded to the requirement that the 
lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI was greater than or equal to -12%. If NI was shown in the PP set, a 
subsequent test for NI was to be performed in the FAS. If NI could not be shown in the PP set, the sequential 
testing procedure was to be stopped. If NI was shown on the FAS, a subsequent test for superiority was to 
be performed one-sided with a 2.5% significance level in the FAS. 
The primary analyses were based on a logistic regression with factors ‘last evaluated pooled dose’ and 
‘region’. The difference in proportions stratified by geographical region was estimated by the average risk 
difference (ARD) over the different regions and was estimated from the coefficients of the specified logistic 
regression model with treatment and region as main factors. The results of the logistic regression model 
including the estimates for the regression coefficients, the predicted probability to be seizure-free, the 
average risk difference and the corresponding CI were tabulated by last evaluated dose. Odds ratios and 
corresponding CIs were presented in addition, as appropriate. 
For the primary efficacy analysis and the majority of secondary analysis, dropouts which did not complete 
the respective analysis period were considered as non-seizure free. The assumption was that missing data 
which were primarily caused by a dropout may have been related to treatment failure and thus these 
subjects were considered treatment failures. Depending on the dropout rate of the individual treatment 
groups, this approach may have been conservative or not for the comparison of the 2 treatment groups. 
In order to evaluate the robustness of the methodology, the Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the common risk 
difference was presented together with corresponding 95% CI (using Sato’s variance estimator) as well as 
the summary score estimate (Agresti) of the common risk difference together with the stratified Newcombe 
95% CI. Unadjusted effect sizes and their corresponding 95% CIs were presented based on the Farington 
Manning test in addition to evaluate the influence of the regional adjustment on the treatment effect. In 
addition, potential interaction effects were evaluated by repeating the logistic regression model including the 
interaction term of treatment and region. The influence of age was evaluated by repeating the logistic 
regression model including age (years) as a covariate and including the interaction term of treatment and 
age.  
The 1-year treatment effect was analysed using the same methodology as for the primary analysis. It was 
assumed that only dropouts due to an AE or lack of efficacy were related to a potential treatment failure. 
Other subjects and especially those subjects who did not complete the 1-year period because of insufficient 
observation time were assumed to be seizure-free. 
The relative risk difference (RRD) to be seizure-free and its corresponding 95% CI was presented for the 
Evaluation Period as well as for the 1-year proportion of seizure-free subjects and compared against the NI 
margin of -20% as exploratory analyses. 
The treatment failure time, defined as the time to first seizure at the last evaluated dose, was analysed and 
presented descriptively by means of the Kaplan-Meier estimate for the failure time, log-rank test, and a Cox 
proportional hazards model with treatment and region as factors. Hazard ratios and corresponding 95% CIs 
were presented. Subjects were to be censored by their day of last treatment. 
Time to treatment failure under dose level A, defined as the time of the first occurrence of a seizure or 
withdrawal of treatment due to an AE or due to lack of efficacy during the Evaluation/Maintenance Periods at 
dose level A, was presented by means of incidence curves by randomised treatment group. 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 17/71 
 
  
  
  
The treatment retention time, defined as the time of the first occurrence of treatment withdrawal due to an 
AE or due to lack of efficacy, was analysed by randomised treatment group, and the Kaplan-Meier estimate 
for the failure time and log-rank test (with and without stratification by region) were presented. 
The duration and seizure type of the last seizure that led to up-titration or discontinuation until the end of the 
Evaluation Period were presented descriptively for the last evaluated pooled and individual dose. 
The time to withdrawal for any reason at the last evaluated dose was presented. 
Due to the study design, a dose-response relationship could not be established by comparing the treatment 
effect with individual dose levels. Instead, the number and percentage of subjects were presented by the 
individual dose level of the last evaluated dose together with the seizure freedom rate by period. Due to the 
fact that the length of the Maintenance Period and Extension Phase could differ by subject, the exposure time 
of a subject could differ by several weeks or months. For this reason, an additional analysis focused on the 
seizure frequency adjusted for the exposure time until end of the Evaluation and Maintenance Periods and 
Extension Phase. The seizure frequency was expressed as frequency per subject-year. 
The seizure occurrence rates of dose level A, of any dose level and of the last evaluated dose during the 
Titration/Stabilisation Periods and of the last evaluated dose during the Evaluation Period were summarised 
descriptively. 
The derived QOLIE-31 scores were presented using descriptive statistics for each of the 7 multi-item scales 
(final scores and T-scores), for the overall score and for the global assessment for the QOLIE-31 at each visit 
by the last evaluated pooled dose.  
Subgroup analyses 
The primary efficacy analysis was repeated for subgroups described below and the logistic regression was 
repeated, including a treatment by subgroup interaction term. These analyses were repeated for the 1-year 
treatment effect. 
Seizure frequency during the 3 months before baseline was considered strongly predictive of prognosis, and 
therefore subjects were classified as follows: 
•  ≤4 seizures during the last 3 months 
•  >4 seizures during the last 3 months 
and as: 
•  ≤4 seizures during the last 12 months 
•  >4 seizures during the last 12 months 
In addition, subjects were classified by: 
•  Baseline seizure type. In case that different seizure types had been reported for a subject, the worst 
type before baseline as selected:

At the time of the data cut-off for this application, the Maintenance Period was still ongoing, and was 
completed by 59.9% of ESL subjects and 64.1% of CBZ-CR subjects. 
The majority of subjects (ESL: 271/401 [67.6%], CBZ-CR: 317/412 [76.9%]) remained on treatment at 
dose level A and thus the number of subjects that needed up-titration to higher dose levels was relatively 
small: at dose level B, 70/401 subjects (17.5%) were treated with ESL and 61/412 (14.8%) with CBZ-CR 
and at dose level C, 60/401 subjects (15.0%) were treated with ESL and 34/412 (8.3%) with CBZ-CR. Only 
2 subjects (1 in each group) up titrated to a higher dose despite being seizure free. 
Of the 401 ESL subjects and 412 CBZ-CR subjects who received treatment, the majority of subjects in both 
groups (70.8% in the ESL group and 74.5% in the CBZ-CR group) completed the 26-week Evaluation Period. 
By the last evaluated dose, the majority of subjects completed the Evaluation Period at dose level A (ESL: 
79.7%, CBZ-CR: 76.7%) and dose level B (ESL: 61.4%, CBZ-CR: 78.7%), and slightly fewer subjects 
completed at dose level C (ESL: 41.7%, CBZ-CR: 47.1%).  
The most commonly reported primary reasons for premature discontinuation before the end of the 
Evaluation Period, as classified by the investigator, were AEs, lack of efficacy (i.e. seizure at dose level C), 
and withdrawal of consent. While fewer CBZ-CR subjects (2.9%) prematurely discontinued due to lack of 
efficacy (i.e. seizure at dose level C) compared to ESL subjects (7.0%), more CBZ-CR subjects (10.7%) 
discontinued due to AEs than ESL subjects (8.2%).

Recruitment 
A total of 135 study centres in 31 countries (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, 
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, 
Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Kingdom, India, Israel, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and 
Peru) participated in the study.  
The first subject was enrolled on 27-Jan-2011, date of data-cut-off: 24-Sep-2015. 
Conduct of the study 
At the time of the reporting there were 2 protocol amendments to study 311: 
Protocol amendment 1 (29 Jun 2012) 
• 
The mandatory 8-hour fasting period prior to blood sampling procedure was removed (analytes to 
be measured were not relevant for any selection criteria or any study endpoint). 
•  Need to administer the morning doses at study sites (at study visits) was removed.  
•  Due to recruitment issues, the limitation of benzodiazepines use for a maximum of 2 days during the 
5-day drug-free period between the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and the Randomisation Visit (Visit A1) 
was removed. The possible carry-over effect of benzodiazepines would not be different compared 
with administration on only 2 days. In addition, seizures during the first 2 weeks of treatment will 
not be considered for the study endpoints, and any possible carry-over effect would therefore not 
impact the study endpoints. 
• 
Further, clarification and specification on study procedures.  
Protocol amendment 2 (27 Mar 2015)  
The objective of this amendment was to clarify the end of the double-blind study, permitting some subjects 
to terminate early or even skip their Maintenance Phase, so that the open-label extension study, which was 
performed under a separate protocol, could commence in due time. Under this amendments, subjects were 
allowed to end the double-blind study after at least 54 weeks of double-blind treatment with the latter being 
potentially at different doses but still after end of the evaluation period. This amendment had thus no impact 
on the on the primary evaluation period.  
According to the updated European Medicines Agency CHMP guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products in the treatment of epileptic disorders, monotherapy studies should have a minimum duration of 
1 year. The protocol specified a 1-year treatment duration on the same dose, which was not required by the 
guideline and was considered to unduly delay the termination of the study. 
As soon as the stop conditions were met, a Final endpoint visit was scheduled within 42 days for all subjects. 
After this, the subjects continued attending Extension phase visits every 3 months. As soon as the regular 
unblinding took place, the last visit was to be held for all subjects within 42 days.  
Due to protocol amendment 2, the Down-titration and Follow-up Phases were only part of the statistical 
analyses if subjects discontinued early, the down-titration and follow-up phases of all other subjects were 
after the cut-off date. 
Changes from the protocol in the planned analyses: 
Among others, the following criteria for exclusion of subjects from the PP set were changed: 
The time period for “History of newly diagnosed epilepsy with at least 2 well documented, unprovoked, 
clinically evaluated and classified partial seizures (with or without secondary generalisation) with clear focal 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 20/71 
 
  
  
  
origin” was extended from 12 months to 13 months in order to ease the classification of subjects with partial 
dates. 
The time period for “No seizure during the previous 3 months” was extended to previous 4 months for the 
same reason as above.  
The criterion “Treated with investigational medicinal product not according to titration regimen” was deleted 
because it was considered a minor deviation. Some subjects were titrated to a higher dose even though they 
were seizure free until end of evaluation period. The reason was that the visit was delayed and the 
investigator evaluated all seizures until the visit. The subjects were analysed using the data of the last 
evaluated dose. 
The criterion “Poor compliance for completion of the eDiary” was deleted because the primary analysis was 
based on the seizures as reported by the investigator. 
Major Protocol violations: 
Major protocol violations were reported for 13 ESL subjects (3.2%) and 15 CBZ-CR subjects (3.6%). These 
subjects were excluded from the PP set. The most common major protocol violations were incorrect 
enrolment of subjects who did not meet the inclusion criterion providing that epilepsy was diagnosed more 
than 13 months prior to Visit 1 or enrolment of subjects who met exclusion criteria (e.g. former or current 
use of >1 AED for >2 weeks before Visit 1; previous regular use of ESL or CBZ), intake of prohibited 
therapies and poor compliance for taking investigational medicinal product. 
Baseline data 
Baseline subject demographics are summarised in Table 2.  
The treatment groups were overall balanced with respect to demographic parameters. The majority of 
subjects was < 65 years, only 6.7% (N=27) of ESL subjects and 8.5% (N=35) of CBZ-CR subjects were 
65 years or older. Most subjects (~80%) were Caucasian. There were slightly more male subjects included 
than female.

Disease characteristics 
The mean age of onset of epilepsy was 37.3 years in the ESL group and 38.4 years in the CBZ-CR group.  
The most frequently reported aetiologies of the disease were cranial trauma/injuries (8.7% in ESL and 
10.9% in CBZ-CR) and cerebrovascular disease (8.5% in ESL and 8.3% in CBZ-CR). The aetiology was 
reported as unknown for 66.8% of ESL subjects and 61.9% of CBZ-CR subjects. At least 91% of subjects in 
either treatment group had no family history of epilepsy. 
During the last year prior to enrolment in the study, the mean number of seizures experienced by subjects 
(FAS) was similar between the treatment groups with 20.1 in the ESL group (range: 2 to 836) and 19.0 in 
the CBZ-CR group (range: 1 to 999). The seizures were mainly simple partial (mean of 8.5 seizures in the 
ESL group and 9.1 in the CBZ-CR group) and complex seizures (mean of 9.8 seizures in the ESL group and 
8.3 in the CBZ-CR group).

The treatment groups were generally balanced with respect to epilepsy disease characteristics. 
In the PP set, in both treatment groups a median of 4 seizures was experienced within 1 year prior to 
enrolment and a median of 2 seizures was experienced within 3 months prior to enrolment. However, 
whereas the total baseline seizure frequency was relatively similar in both treatment groups, baseline 
seizure frequency by dose level was similar at dose level A, it was higher in the ESL group at dose level B and 
higher in the CBZ-CR group at dose level C. 
Most subjects had concomitant medical conditions with a similar incidence in each of the treatment groups 
(73.1% of ESL and 71.6% of CBZ-CR subjects), including nervous system disorders, metabolism and 
nutrition disorders and vascular disorders. The most commonly reported concomitant medical conditions 
(>5% of subjects in either treatment group) were hypertension, obesity and headache.

Previous and concomitant medication 
Previous non-AED therapies were used by 33.7% of ESL subjects and 35.0% of CBZ-CR subjects and the 
majority of subjects in either group used a concomitant therapy (ESL: 70.6% of subjects, CBZ-CR: 69.4% of 
subjects). The most frequently used concomitant therapies (>15% of subjects in either treatment group) 
were anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic products (22.9% of ESL subjects and 22.6% of CBZ-CR 
subjects), analgesics (20.9% of ESL subjects and 25.2% of CBZ-CR subjects), AEDs (20.4% of ESL subjects 
and 13.3% of CBZ-CR subjects), agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (14.5% of ESL subjects and 
18.7% of CBZ-CR subjects) and anti-bacterials for systemic use (14.7% of ESL subjects and 18.2% of 
CBZ-CR subjects). 
The use of different previous or concomitant non-AED therapies was generally comparable between 
treatment groups.  
Previous and concomitant AED therapy 
Previous AEDs (allowed for a maximum of 2 weeks for a single AED) had been used by similar proportions of 
subjects in both treatment groups, i.e. 17.7% of ESL and 16.7% CBZ-CR subjects. The most frequently used 
previous AEDs (≥2% of subjects in either the ESL or CBZ-CR group) included carbamazepine, clobazam, 
clonazepam, levetiracetam, phenytoin and valproic acid with similar percentages of subjects in each 
treatment group. 
Concomitant AEDs were used by 25.7% of ESL subjects and 18.0% CBZ-CR subjects. The difference mainly 
derives from a higher percentage of subjects using AEDs in the ESL group compared to CBZ-CR at dose level 
B (38.6% versus 19.7%) and dose level C (46.7% versus 35.3%). Most of these were not considered 
protocol deviations including use of Zolpidem and Zopiclone, if an AED was started at or after Early 
Discontinuation Visit, if an AED was started at or after the last investigational medicinal product intake, if a 
new AED was started during a window of 7 days before the start of down-titration, and benzodiazepines 
≤twice a week, all of which were allowed according to protocol. 
The incidences of concomitant AEDs including carboxamide derivatives, respectively in the FAS are given in 
the following table. Respective results for the PP set were comparable.

Treatment compliance 
Overall compliance to treatment administration was good with 99.3% compliance in both treatment groups 
until the end of the Evaluation Period and approximately 99.6% compliance until the end of the Maintenance 
Period. The majority of subjects in both groups were within the 80% to 120% compliance category during 
both the Evaluation (89.8 % of both treatment groups) and Maintenance Periods (68.8% of ESL and 72.1% 
of CBZ-CR patients).  
Numbers analysed 
The Safety Set and FAS included all 401 subjects (all randomised subjects) in the ESL group and 
412 subjects (99.5% of randomised subjects) in the CBZ-CR group who received treatment. Major protocol 
violations were reported for 13 ESL subjects (3.2%) and 15 CBZ-CR subjects (3.6%). These subjects were 
excluded from the PP set, which comprised 388 subjects (96.8%) from the ESL group and 397 subjects 
(95.9%) from the CBZ-CR group. The SPP set comprised 316 ESL subjects (78.8%) and 326 CBZ-CR 
subjects (78.7%).

Outcomes and estimation 
• 
Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy variable was the proportion of subjects in the PP set classified as seizure-free for the 
entire 26-week Evaluation Period at the last received dose level. Subjects who dropped out during this 
26-week period were considered non-seizure-free. 
As shown in Table 6, in the PP set, a similar proportion of subjects were classified as seizure-free for the 
entire 26-week Evaluation Period at the last evaluated dose in the ESL group (276/388, 71.1%) and the 
CBZ-CR group (300/397, 75.6%). The lower limit of the 95% CI (-10.30%) was within the predefined 
non-inferiority margin of -12%.

ARD = average risk difference of ESL – CBZ-CR to be seizure-free stratified by region (estimated from the 
logistic regression coefficients); CBZ-CR = carbamazepine controlled-release; CI = confidence interval; ESL 
= eslicarbazepine acetate; N = number of subjects in analysis set; PP = Per Protocol; SE = standard error of 
the estimate (Multivariate Delta Method). 
Note: Confidence interval non-inferiority margin = -12%, i.e. ESL is assumed to be non-inferior to CBZ-CR if 
the lower limit of the CI ≥-12%. 
The results in the FAS were similar to those of the PP set with 70.8% (284/401) ESL subjects and 74.0% 
(305/412) CBZ-CR subjects classified as seizure-free during the entire 26-week Evaluation Period. The lower 
limit of the 95% CI (-9.04) was larger than -12%. 
ESL was not found to be superior to CBZ-CR for the proportion of seizure-free subjects in the FAS during the 
Evaluation Period, because the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI was below 0. 
Results for seizure freedom during the Evaluation Period based on the logistic regression with region as 
factor, supported the ARD analysis in the PP set (odds ratio: 0.793, 95% CI: 0.572; 1.100) and the FAS 
(odds ratio: 0.849, 95% CI: 0.618; 1.167). 
Sensitivity analyses: 
In the SPP set, 87.3% (276/316) ESL subjects and 92.0% (300/326) CBZ-CR subjects classified as 
seizure-free during the entire 26-week Evaluation Period. The lower limit of the 95% CI of the ARD was 
-9.13% and thus within the predefined NI margin. This was further supported by the results based on the 
logistic regression with region as factor (odd ratio: 0.598, 95% CI: 0.351; 1.016). 
Comparable results were derived from the analyses of seizure-free subjects during the Evaluation period 
based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimate and the summary score estimate of the Common Risk Difference 
with Newcombe 95% CI in the PP set (lower limit of Mantel-Haenszel 95% CI: -10.32, lower limit of 
Newcombe 95% CI: -10.23) and in the FAS (lower limit of Mantel-Haenszel 95% CI: -9.06, lower limit of 
Newcombe 95% CI: -9.14). Likewise, the un-stratified Farrington Manning Test supported the primary 
analysis in both the PP set (95% CI: -10.61; 1.74, p=0.0082) and the FAS (95% CI: -9.34; 2.93, 
p=0.0025). 
No interaction was indicated between treatment and region when included in the logistic regression model 
for seizure freedom during the Evaluation Period in the PP set (p=0.4930) or the FAS (p=0.5124). Between 
regions, the predicted probability to be seizure-free during the Evaluation Period ranged from approximately 
60% to approximately 85% in both the PP set and the FAS. In the SPP set, the predicted probability to be 
seizure-free showed less variation between regions and was higher than in the PP set and FAS, ranging from 
approximately 80% to approximately 95%. 
There was no interaction between age and treatment (PP set: p=0.2811, FAS: p=0.2785).

•  Secondary efficacy analyses 
Proportion of seizure-free subjects during 1 year (52 weeks) of treatment at the last evaluated dose 
The primary analyses were repeated for the proportion of seizure-free subjects during 1 year of treatment. 
In the PP set, the lower limit of the ARD remained just within the non-inferiority margin of -12%. The results 
were similar in the FAS (lower limit of 95% CI: -11.07%).

ARD = average risk difference of ESL – CBZ-to be seizure-free stratified by region (estimated from the logistic 
regression  coefficients);  CBZ-CR  =  carbamazepine  controlled-release;  CI  =  confidence  interval 
(non-inferiority margin = -12%); ESL = eslicarbazepine acetate; N = number of subjects in analysis set; PP 
= Per Protocol; SE = standard error of the estimate (Multivariate Delta Method). 
Sensitivity analyses: 
Results for seizure freedom during 1 year of treatment based on the logistic regression with region as factor, 
supported the ARD analysis in the PP set (odds ratio: 0.772, 95% CI: 0.568; 1.048) and the FAS (odds ratio: 
0.801, 95% CI: 0.595; 1.080). 
Similar results were also obtained in the PP set based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimate (lower limit of 
Mantel-Haenszel 95% CI: -11.91) and the summary score estimate for the Common Risk Difference (lower 
limit of Newcombe 95% CI: -11.80). The results for the FAS were similar. 
Between regions, the predicted probability to be seizure-free during 1 year of treatment ranged from 
approximately 50% to approximately 80% in both the PP set and the FAS.  
As for the primary analysis, the risk difference to be seizure-free during 1 year of treatment, varied across 
regions. For the treatment groups overall disregarding stratification, based on the Farrington-Manning test, 
the 95% CI was within the -12% margin in the FAS (-11.32; 1.62, p=0.0151) and close to -12% in the PP 
set (95% CI: -12.11; 0.94, p=0.0270). 
Based on the pre-specified threshold of 0.1, no interaction between region and treatment was found in the 
PP set (p=0.1771) or the FAS (p=0.2795), based on the logistic regression model. There was also no 
interaction between age and treatment (PP set: p=0.1465, FAS: p=0.1264). 
The additional analyses in which subjects who did not complete the 1-year period were classified as 
non-seizure free, did not influence the outcome of the results; the lower level of the 95% CI remained within 
the pre-defined margin in the PP set and FAS based on the ARD and supporting logistic regression analyses, 
the Mantel-Haenszel estimate and summary score estimate for CRD and the Farrington Manning Test 
results. 
Relative risk difference (RRD): 
The explorative analyses of the RRD to be seizure-free (non-inferiority margin: -20%) were consistent with 
the primary analyses during the 26-week Evaluation Period (RDD: -5.87, 95% CI: -13.50, 2.44) as well as 
during the 1-year treatment period (RDD: -7.95, 95% CI: -16.50, 1.47) in the PP set. Similar results were 
obtained in the FAS.

Treatment failure time (i.e. time to 1st seizure at last evaluated dose) 
At the end of the Evaluation Period (Day 182), the probability of treatment failure (i.e. risk of seizure) at the 
last evaluated dose was higher in the ESL group (0.12) than in the CBZ-CR group (0.06). The between 
treatment difference was -0.06 (95% CI: -0.0105; -0.021). 
The time to first seizure was earlier in the ESL group, with an increased probability for treatment failure in 
the first 60 days of treatment compared to CBZ-CR (see following Figure). The Kaplan-Meier analyses were 
supported by the Cox proportional hazards model results (hazard ratio: 1.874, 95% CI: 1.348; 2.605). 
Consistent results were observed for the FAS.

Figure 4 - Treatment failure time – Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Estimates (PP set) 
CBZ-CR = carbamazepine controlled-release; ESL = eslicarbazepine acetate; PP = Per Protocol 
Note: The Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Estimate and equal precision 95% confidence bounds (Nair) are presented. 
Treatment failure is defined as the first occurrence of a seizure during the Evaluation or Maintenance Period. Days are 
relative to the start of the Evaluation Period of dose level A. 
When only considering those subjects on dose level A (i.e. the dose on which most subjects remained during 
the study), the probability to have treatment failure (i.e. a seizure) was also higher in the first 60 days in the 
ESL group compared to the CBZ-CR group, but remained otherwise similar between treatment groups 
throughout the rest of the study. 
Treatment retention time (i.e. time to withdrawal due to AEs or due to lack of efficacy) 
The Kaplan-Meier curves for treatment retention time indicated that the ESL and CBZ-CR group had similar 
probability to withdraw up to Day 240 and that the ESL group had higher probability to withdraw from 
treatment from Day 240 (see following Figure). 
After 1 year of treatment (Day 365), the probability estimate was 0.23 in the ESL group compared to 0.19 
in the CBZ-CR group. After 2 years of treatment (Day 730), it was 0.34 in the ESL group and 0.29 in the 
CBZ-CR group. After 3 years of treatment (Day 1095), it was 0.42 in the ESL group and 0.34 in the CBZ-CR 
group. Similar results were observed for the FAS.

treatment group (PP Set) 
CBZ-CR = carbamazepine controlled-release; ESL = eslicarbazepine acetate; PP = Per Protocol 
Note: The Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Estimate and simultaneous equal precision 95% confidence bounds are presented. 
Time to withdrawal (for any reason) 
Overall, the percentage of subjects who discontinued from the study for any reason was similar between the 
treatment groups for the first 90 days and thereafter slightly higher in the ESL group compared to CBZ-CR 
over the remainder of the study in the PP set, FAS and Safety Set. 
By last evaluated dose, the percentage of discontinuations was slightly higher in CBZ-CR subjects at dose 
level A, and higher for ESL subjects at dose level B and C. However, the results for dose level B and C should 
be interpreted with caution due to lower subject numbers. 
Seizure duration and type 
Seizure duration and type (of the last seizure before up-titration or discontinuation) during the evaluation 
period is presented in the following table.

CBZ-CR = carbamazepine controlled-release; ESL = eslicarbazepine acetate; n = number of subjects with last seizure of 
the  respective  duration/type;  N  =  number  of  subjects  in  analysis  set;  M  =  number  of  subjects  with  a  seizure  before 
up-titration or discontinuation. 
Note: Since subjects titrated to higher dose levels contribute to more than one dose level, subjects are counted more than 
once. 
Information on duration of the respective seizures was unknown or missing in a noticeable percentage of 
subjects (i.e. approx. 23-33 % of ESL and 13-50 % of CBZ-CR subjects, respectively within the different 
dose levels). 
Simple partial seizures were reported less in the ESL group (23%) than in the CBZ-CR group subjects (40%) 
while partial evolving to secondarily generalised seizures were reported by more ESL subjects (32%) than 
CBZ-CR subjects (19%); 43% (ESL) and 26% (CBZ-CR) were complex partial seizures. 
Dose-response relationship: Dose level at which subjects reached 26-week seizure freedom  
Due to the up-titration study design, it was not possible to compare the treatment effect by the individual 
dose levels or establish a dose relationship. Results are presented by the last evaluated individual dose level 
and subjects who were up-titrated were only analysed in the dose level that was their last evaluated dose.

BID  =  twice  daily;  CBZ-CR  =  carbamazepine  controlled-release;  ESL  =  eslicarbazepine  acetate;  M  =  number  of 
subjects entering the respective period/phase at the last evaluated dose analysis; N = number of subjects in analysis 
set; n = number of subjects classified as seizure-free during the respective period/phase of the last evaluated dose; 
PP = Per Protocol; QD = once daily.  
Note: Data for the Maintenance Period and Extension Phase are presented only up to the cut-off date and are interim 
in nature. 
If the proportion of seizure free subjects at each dose level (i.e. those completing the Evaluation Period at 
the last evaluated dose) is determined based on the total number of subjects in the PP set for the entire 
treatment group (i.e. 388 subjects for ESL and 397 subjects for CBZ-CR), the overall proportion was similar 
in the ESL QD groups (54.1% for 800 mg, 11.1% for 1200 mg and 5.9% for 1600 mg) and in the CBZ-CR BID 
groups (59.7% for 200 mg, 11.9% for 400 mg, and 4.0% for 600 mg). 
Seizure frequencies adjusted for exposure time until the end of the Evaluation, Maintenance and Extension 
periods were slightly higher in the ESL group than the CBZ-CR group at all dose levels. In the PP set, seizure 
frequencies until the end of the different periods ranged from 5.21 to 7.18 per 100 patient-years in the ESL 
group and from 3.18 to 3.94 per 100 patient-years in the CBZ-CR group at dose level A. Results were similar 
in the FAS. 
Seizure occurrence 
Overall, the seizure rate during treatment at the last evaluated dose was higher in the ESL group (79/388, 
20.4% of subjects) than the CBZ-CR group (57/397, 14.4%), mainly due to more ESL subjects experiencing 
seizures during the evaluation period (41/357, 11.5% ESL vs. 19/370, 5.1% CBZ-CR subjects). There was 
no clear trend in the seizure rates of CBZ-CR vs. ESL treated subjects at different dose levels during the 
titration and stabilization period. 
The data were largely in line with the results for treatment failure time at last evaluated dose level.

Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 
Quality of life in Study 311 was assessed using the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory-31 (QOLIE-31). In 
the PP set, the mean overall QOLIE-31 scores at baseline were similar in the ESL group (mean of 65.7 points) 
and the CBZ-CR group (mean of 65.9 points), and comparable improvements were seen in both treatment 
groups for the overall scores throughout the study. Improvements from baseline in the QOLIE-31 sub-scores 
for global assessment and T-scores were also similar between the treatment groups. The QOLIE-31 results 
in the FAS supported the results in the PP set. 
•  Subgroup analyses 
Seizure frequency 
The majority of subjects had ≤ 4 seizures in the 3 months prior to baseline: 277/388 (71.4%) of ESL and 
293/397 (73.8%) of CBZ-CR subjects. During the last 12 months prior to baseline, the proportions of 
patients with ≤ 4 seizures were 219/388 (56.4%) in the ESL arm and 297/397 (55.2%) in the CBZ-CR arm. 
In the PP set, the proportion of seizure-free subjects during the Evaluation Period was similar between 
treatment arms for the subgroup with ≤4 seizures in the last 3 months before baseline (ESL: 209/277 
[75.5%], CBZ-CR: 226/293 [77.1%]) and the last 12 months (ESL: 167/219 [76.3%], CBZ-CR: 166/219 
[75.8%]). 
The proportion of seizure-free subjects was higher (>10% difference) in CBZ-CR compared to ESL subjects 
with > 4 seizures in the last 3 months (ESL: 67/111 [60.4%], CBZ-CR: 74/104 [71.2%]; ARD -10.3%, 
95%-CI: -22.54; 1.94) and with > 4 seizures during the last 12 months (ESL: 109/169 [64.5%], CBZ-CR: 
134/178 [75.3%]; ARD -8.97%, 95%-CI: -18.39; 0.45) during the Evaluation period; PP set. Similar results 
were observed in the FAS. Following 1 year of treatment, the CBZ-CR group continued to have a higher 
proportion of seizure-free subjects in the subgroup with >4 seizures in the last 3 months (>5% difference) 
and last 12 months (>10% difference) before baseline. 
No interaction between treatment and seizure frequency at baseline was observed during the Evaluation 
Period based on the logistic regression with region and baseline seizure frequency as factors; there was also 
no interaction between treatment and seizure frequency at baseline during 1 year of treatment. 
Baseline seizure type (worst seizure type) 
The majority of subjects had partial seizures evolving to secondarily generalised seizures at baseline and the 
proportions were comparable between treatment groups (ESL: 249/388 [64.2%], CBZ-CR: 239/397 
[60.2%]). The subgroups of subjects with simple partial seizures (ESL: 95/388 [24.5%], CBZ-CR: 105/397 
[26.5%]) and complex partial seizures (ESL: 44/388 [11.3%], CBZ-CR: 53/397 [13.4%]) at baseline were 
relatively small. 
A similar proportion of subjects with partial seizures evolving to secondarily generalised seizures at baseline 
were seizure-free during the Evaluation Period (ESL: 185/249 [74.3%], CBZ-CR: 184/239 [77.0%]; ARD 
-2.66%, 95%-CI: -9.98; 4.66). Fewer subjects with complex partial seizures at baseline were seizure-free 
during the Evaluation Period in the ESL group (61/95 [64.2%]) than in the CBZ-CR group (78/105 [74.3%]; 
ARD -11.53%, 95%-CI: -23.39; 0.33), while for the subgroup with simple partial seizures at baseline, the 
proportion of seizure-free subjects during the Evaluation Period was similar between groups (ESL: 30/44 
[68.2%], CBZ-CR: 38/53 [71.7%]). 
During 1 year of treatment, the ARD to be seizure-free was generally consistent with the results observed 
during the Evaluation Period. 
No interaction between treatment and seizure type at baseline was observed during the Evaluation Period 
based on the logistic regression with region and baseline seizure type as factors (for the PP set, or the FAS). 
There was also no interaction between treatment and seizure type during 1 year of treatment. 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 34/71 
 
  
  
  
Age 
More than 90% of subjects in both treatment groups were <65 years old. The proportion of seizure-free 
subjects <65 years during the Evaluation Period were 260/362 [71.8%] ESL subjects and 280/366 [76.5%] 
CBZ-CR subjects (ARD -4.35%, 95%-CI: -10.53; 1.82). The proportion of seizure-free subjects aged 
≥65 years were 16/26 [61.5%] ESL subjects and 20/31 [64.5%] CBZ-CR subjects (ARD -9.27%, 95%-CI: 
-34.62; 16.08).  
During 1 year of treatment, the proportion of seizure-free subjects <65 years was 65.5% (237/362 
subjects) in the ESL group and 71.9% (263/366 subjects) in the CBZ-CR group, and for subjects ≥65 years 
the proportion was 53.8% (14/26 subjects) in the ESL group and 51.6% (16/31 subjects) in the CBZ-CR 
group. 
Results in the FAS were similar with respect to Evaluation Period and during 1 year of treatment, 
respectively. 
No interaction during the Evaluation Period between treatment and age group was observed based on the 
logistic regression with region and age group as factors (PP and FAS set). There continued to be no 
interaction between treatment and age group during 1 year of treatment (PP and FAS set).  
Previous AED use (a single AED for a maximum of 2 weeks) 
In the PP set, a subgroup of approx. 15% subjects in both treatment groups was previously treated with an 
AED. Overall, in the PP set during the Evaluation Period, the percentage of seizure-free subjects not 
previously treated with AEDs was similar in the ESL group (239/328 subjects [72.9%]) and the CBZ-CR 
group (251/340 subjects [73.8%]). A smaller proportion of subjects previously treated with AEDs were 
seizure-free in the ESL group (37/60 subjects [61.7%]) compared to the CBZ-CR group (49/57 subjects 
[86.0%]; ARD -22.2%, 95%-CI: -37.12; -7.28).  
During 1 year of treatment, the results were consistent with those seen during the Evaluation Period.  
The logistic regression with region and previous treatment with AEDs as factors confirmed an interaction 
between previous AED use and treatment during the Evaluation Period in the PP set (p=0.0125). The results 
in the FAS were similar. An interaction was also seen between previous AED use and treatment during 1 year 
of treatment (PP set: p=0.0047, FAS: p=0.0080).

Supportive study(ies) 
Studies 039-045 and 039-046 
Two identically designed conversion-to-monotherapy studies (studies 039-045 and 039-46) have been 
performed between Apr 2009 and May 2013 (study 045) and Jun 2010 and Nov 2012 (study 046), 
respectively. Both studies were primarily intended to support the approval of ESL monotherapy in the US. 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 37/71 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
The studies were double-blind, randomised, historical control, multicentre studies in male and female 
subjects (aged 16 to 70 years, inclusive) with POS. The results were provided as supportive data in this 
application. 
The studies had an 8-week baseline period followed by 18 week treatment period consisting of a 2 weeks 
titration period, 6 week tapering period of concomitant AED(s) and a 10 week ESL monotherapy period. 
Figure 6 – Overview of the Design of Studies 045 and 046 
Subjects were randomised in a 2:1 ratio into the treatment arms: ESL 1600 mg QD or ESL 1200 mg QD.  
The main inclusion criteria were: 
•  Male and female patients between the ages of 16 to 70 years (inclusive) with a medical diagnosis of 
partial epilepsy defined by the Classification of Seizures of the ILAE as partial onset seizures. 
•  At least 4 seizures during the 8-week baseline period with no 28-day seizure-free period.  
•  Stable treatment with 1-2 AEDs during the last 4 week prior to screening 
The primary efficacy endpoint for each subject was study exit by meeting at least one of the prospective 
five exit criteria: 
1. One episode of status epilepticus.  
2. One secondarily generalized partial seizure (in subjects who did not have generalized seizures during six 
months prior to screening).  
3. A two-fold increase in any consecutive 28-day seizure rate compared to the highest consecutive 28-day 
seizure rate during the 8-week baseline period. 
4: A two-fold increase in any consecutive 2-day seizure rate compared to the highest consecutive 2-day 
seizure rate during the 8-week baseline period.  
5: Worsening of seizures or increase in seizure frequency considered serious or requiring intervention. 
The cumulative exit rate for a treatment arm was defined as the proportion of subjects meeting at least one 
of these exit criteria over a 16-week study period. 
The key secondary endpoint was the proportion (%) of seizure-free subjects during the 10-week 
double-blind monotherapy period. 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 38/71 
 
  
  
  
 
 
Other secondary endpoints included change in seizure frequency from baseline and 50% responder rate. 
The efficacy analyses were based on the efficacy (EFF) population, i.e. all subjects in the Intent-To-Treat 
(ITT) population who had entered the AED taper/ESL conversion period. 
The primary comparison was against a historical control, based upon combined exit rates from 8 different 
monotherapy studies that used pseudo-placebos (French et al., 2010). 
The cumulative exit rate was estimated based on Kaplan-Meier methodology. Subjects were censored at the 
time they prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason other than the exit criteria or at 112 days for 
subjects who have not met any of the exit criteria. The primary comparison was the 1600 mg treatment arm 
against the historical control, whereby the lower bound of a prediction interval (computed assuming an 80% 
exit rate for the pseudo-placebo treatment and a sample size of 50 subjects) was set as a hypothesis testing 
criterion (“threshold”) for the determination of efficacy. The lower bound of the 80% prediction interval (PI) 
for two independent studies was 72.2%, and the lower bound of the 95% prediction interval for a single 
study was 65.3%. If the upper end of the 95% CI of 1600 mg QD arm fell below the 72.2% threshold in two 
independent studies or below the 65.3% threshold in a single study, the null hypothesis that the exit rate in 
the 1600 mg QD arm equals the combined exit rate observed in the historical control studies was rejected. 
If the primary null hypothesis of the 1600 mg group versus historical control was rejected, efficacy of the 
1200 mg treatment arm versus historical control was evaluated in the same manner. 
Number of subjects analysed: 
•  Study 045: 193 randomised (128 ESL 1600 mg, 65 ESL 1200 mg), EFF set: 178 subjects, PP set: 
139 subjects. 
•  Study 046: 172 randomised (114 ESL 1600 mg, 58 ESL 1200 mg), EFF set: 154 subjects, PP set: 
129 subjects. 
Demographics were generally similar in the different dose groups. In regard to age, only few subjects >65y 
of age were included: 1 subject received 1200 mg and 4 subjects received 1600 mg in study 093-045 and no 
subject >65y of age was included in study 093-046. Baseline medical conditions were similar between dose 
groups. No concomitant medical conditions have been recorded in these studies.  
Main results for study 045: 
The Kaplan Meier (KM) estimate of the cumulative 112-day exit rate was 28.7% (95% CI: 21.2%, 38.1%) 
for the 1600 mg ESL dose group and 44.4% (95% CI: 32.5%, 58.3%) for the 1200 mg ESL dose group.  
The upper 95% CI limit of the KM estimate of cumulative 112-day exit rate for the 1600 mg ESL dose group 
(38.1%) was below the lower limit of the 95% prediction interval for the historical control (65.3%). Subjects 
treated with 1600 mg QD ESL as monotherapy exited the study at significantly lower rate due to 
seizure-related events compared to the historical control.  
Similar results for the 1200 mg ESL dose group (KM-estimated upper limit of the 95% CI was 58.3% and was 
lower than the lower limit of the 95% prediction interval for the historical control [65.3%]). Subjects treated 
with 1200 mg QD ESL as monotherapy exited the study at a significantly lower rate due to seizure-related 
events compared to the historical control.  
There was no statistically significant difference in KM-estimates of the cumulative 112-day exit rate between 
ESL dose groups (adjusted P-value = 0.0739).  
Seizure-free rates during the entire 10-week monotherapy period were 7.6% (1600 mg ESL) and 8.3 % 
(1200 mg ESL). The median % relative decrease in standardised seizure frequency over the double-blind 
period compared to baseline was 41.5% in the 1600 mg ESL group and 30.9% in the 1200 mg ESL group. 
The 50% responder rates over the 18-week double-blind period were 39.8% (95% CI: 30.9%, 49.3%) for 
the 1600 mg ESL dose group and 36.7% (95% CI: 24.6%, 50.1%) for the 1200 mg ESL dose group.

Main results for study 046: 
The KM-estimate of the cumulative 112-day exit rate was 12.8% (95% CI: 7.5%, 21.5%) for the 1600 mg 
ESL dose group and 15.6% (95% CI: 8.1%, 28.7%) for the 1200 mg ESL dose group. The upper 95% CI 
limit of the KM-estimate of the cumulative 112-day exit rate for the 1600 mg ESL dose group (21.5%) was 
below the lower limit of the 95% prediction interval for the historical control (65.3%). Subjects treated with 
1600 mg QD ESL as monotherapy exited the study at significantly lower rate due to seizure-related events 
compared to the historical control.  
Similar results were obtained for the 1200 mg ESL dose group (KM-estimated upper limit of the 95% CI was 
28.7% and was lower than the lower limit of the 95% prediction interval for the historical control [65.3%]). 
There was no statistically significant difference in KM-estimates of the cumulative 112-day exit rate between 
ESL dose groups (P = 0.6330).  
Seizure-free rates during the entire 10-week monotherapy period were 10.0% (1600 mg ESL) and 7.4 % 
(1200 mg ESL) and during the last four weeks of monotherapy 17.0% (1600 mg ESL) and 16.7% (1200 mg 
ESL). The median % relative decrease in standardised seizure frequency over the double-blind period 
compared to baseline was 47.5% in the 1600 mg ESL group and 36.1% in the 1200 mg ESL group. Neither 
treatment nor baseline seizure frequency were significant predictors of relative change in seizure frequency. 
The 50% responder rates over the 18-week double-blind period were 46.0% (95% CI: 36.0%, 56.3%) for 
the 1600 mg ESL dose group and 35.2% (95% CI: 22.7%, 49.4%) for the 1200 mg ESL dose group.  
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
To support the broadening of the indication of Zebinix to include POS monotherapy in adult epilepsy 
patients, the MAH submitted the results of one Phase 3 study conducted in adults (≥ 18 years) with newly 
diagnosed epilepsy experiencing POS (study 311). Supportive data were presented from 2 
conversion-to-monotherapy trials. No dose-response studies were conducted.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The primary objective of study 311 was to demonstrate that monotherapy with ESL was non-inferior to 
monotherapy with controlled-release CBZ in adults (≥ 18 years) with newly diagnosed epilepsy experiencing 
POS. In- and exclusion criteria for this study were generally adequate in order to identify a study population 
in line with the proposed target population of the claimed monotherapy indication. At the time of the cut-off 
for the study report (24 Sep 2015), the Maintenance Period was still ongoing and had been completed by 
240 (59.9%) ESL subjects and 264 (61.1%) CBZ-CR subjects. 
The study was designed with stepwise fixed dose increments based on individual response at 3 different dose 
levels, i.e. dose level A (ESL 800 mg QD, CBZ-CR 200 mg BID), level B (ESL 1200 mg QD or CBZ-CR 400 mg 
BID) and level C (ESL 1600 mg QD or CBZ-CR 600 mg BID). Whereas ESL dose levels A and B in study 311 
were within the dose range currently approved for ESL adjunctive treatment of adults with POS, the highest 
dose level, 1600 mg ESL QD, exceeded the maximum approved dose for add-on therapy (1200 mg QD). See 
further discussion on dose recommendations below. 
The choice of CBZ-CR as the active comparator was agreed. CBZ is widely used as first choice treatment for 
POS and the controlled-release formulation allows more stable plasma levels of the drug, avoiding peaks in 
plasma concentration and resulting in an overall better tolerability. Thus, it can be regarded as the active 
comparator of choice. Furthermore, the chosen dose levels of CBZ-CR were within the approved dose range 
of CBZ, in accordance with the most commonly used doses in clinical practice and in line with published 
literature, which suggests that the majority of subjects with newly diagnosed epilepsy respond to their first 
AED at a low dose (e.g. Brodie et al. 2007). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects who were seizure free for the entire 26-week 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 40/71 
 
  
  
  
evaluation period at the last evaluated dose level. Subjects who dropped out during this 26-week period 
were considered as non-seizure-free in the primary efficacy analysis. Seizure freedom rates were also 
evaluated after 1 year of treatment at the last evaluated dose level (secondary endpoint). Non-inferiority 
(NI) of ESL to CBZ-CR was considered demonstrated if the one-sided 97.5% CI for the absolute difference 
in proportions did not exceed the pre-specified NI margin of -12%. The NI margin had been tightened from 
a previously proposed -15%. This was further to a CHMP scientific advice in 2009, which perceived an 
absolute NI margin of -15% as rather large, especially in case of a 26-week seizure freedom rate of 60% 
used for the sample size calculations. The -12% NI margin was determined assuming a relative difference to 
CBZ-CR of 20% or less as acceptable. This was based on ILAE guidance considering a relative treatment 
difference of more than 20% in active controlled monotherapy studies as clinically important (ILAE, 1998; 
Glauser et al., 2006; Glauser et al., 2013).  
Other secondary efficacy variables included time to first seizure at the last evaluated dose, time to 
withdrawal due to AE or lack of efficacy, time to withdrawal for any reason as well as seizure type and 
duration of first seizure during the evaluation period. 
While the primary analyses were conducted on the PP set, the CHMP considered analyses based on PP and 
FAS to be of equal importance for analysis of NI, which means that co-primary testing would have been more 
adequate than sequential testing. However, since both analyses yielded consistent results (see below), the 
issue was not pursued. Furthermore, the CHMP noted that patients who discontinued treatment were 
analysed as non-seizure free. Although drop-out and treatment failure may not be independent, considering 
any drop-out as being non-seizure free probably led to a substantial overestimation of the proportion of 
patients experiencing a seizure during the evaluation period. In fact, the majority of treatment failures were 
not due to seizures but due to study discontinuation for other reasons. Thus, the primary endpoint as 
analysed can be considered as a combined endpoint ‘being seizure free + completing the evaluation period 
at the last dose level’, which could indeed be a valid definition of treatment success, in particular as it does 
not assume continued benefit after treatment discontinuation. However, this endpoint tends to be less 
sensitive to show differences between active treatments and may lead to an anti-conservative NI 
comparison. Nevertheless, the secondary Kaplan-Meier analysis of treatment failures provides the 
proportion of seizure-free patients over time and makes the alternative assumption that the seizure risk of 
dropouts would have been the same as the seizure risk of patients continuing treatment, which may be more 
sensitive to show differences between study arms. Furthermore, in response to a request by the CHMP, the 
MAH providing additional sensitivity analyses employing different assumptions for seizure probability in 
drop-outs (see discussion on the results below). 
Finally, the CHMP questioned a change to the protocol, i.e. deleting ‘poor compliance for completion of the 
eDiary’ from the criteria for the PP population, given that the seizure counting in the study depended on the 
information reported by the study subjects in the diary. The MAH clarified that the total number of subjects 
considered for ‘poor compliance’ (< 80%), was a small proportion of the whole population, with 50 (12.9%) 
subjects in the ESL group and 64 (16.1%) in the CBZ-CR group, and that the poor compliance was partly due 
to technical problems together with the fact that the eDiaries did not allow for retrospective completion. 
Furthermore, in a sensitivity analysis, in which subjects with poor diary compliance were removed from the 
PP subset, the actual responder rates were very similar compared to the original analysis. Based on this 
information, the CHMP was reassured that the cases of poor diary compliance did not affect the overall study 
outcome. 
Overall, the study design including the choice of endpoints and statistical analyses were considered 
acceptable by the CHMP and in line with the recommendations of the CHMP Guideline on clinical investigation 
of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic disorders (CHMP/EWP/566/98Rev.2/Corr). Furthermore, 
study conduct and baseline data were considered acceptable.  
Of the 815 subjects randomised in the study (401 subjects to ESL and 414 to CBZ-CR) more than 70% 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 41/71 
 
  
  
  
completed the evaluation period. Notably, the percentage of discontinuations due to lack of efficacy was 
slightly higher in the ESL group compared to the CBZ-CR group (7% vs. 2.9%), however, the opposite was 
seen regarding AEs, although with an even smaller difference (8.2% vs. 10.7%).  
The distribution of subjects across dose levels was generally similar. However, there were somewhat higher 
percentages of ESL subjects that needed up-titration to dose level B or C, respectively, compared to 
CBZ-CR. The majority of subjects remained at dose level A (ESL: 271/401 [67.6%], CBZ-CR: 317/412 
[76.9%]). As a consequence, the number of subjects at dose level B (ESL: 70/401 [17.5%], CBZ-CR: 
61/412 [14.8%]) and C (ESL: 60/401 subjects [15.0%], CBZ-CR: 34/412 [8.3%]) as last evaluated dose 
was limited. There was also higher percentage of ESL subjects using concomitant AEDs (25.7%) compared 
to CBZ-CR subjects (18.0%) during the evaluation and down-titration periods. To understand a possible 
impact of this imbalance on the study outcome, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in which patients with 
concomitant AEDs were regarded non-responders. The sensitivity analysis yielded similar results as the 
original analysis, which was reassuring.  
Demographic data and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. In 
the PP set, in both treatment groups a median of 4 seizures was experienced within 1 year prior to enrolment 
and a median of 2 seizures was experienced within 3 months prior to enrolment.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of seizure free subjects during the 26 week evaluation 
period at the last evaluated dose level was slightly lower in the ESL arm compared to the CBZ-CR group 
(276/388 [71.1%] versus 300/397 [75.6%], PP set). The average risk difference (ARD) was -4.28 (95% CI: 
-10.3; 1.74) and non-inferiority of ESL with CBZ-CR was concluded based on the pre-specified 
non-inferiority margin of an absolute difference of -12%, as the one-sided 97.5% CI was greater than -12%. 
The results from the analysis on the FAS as well as from the planned sensitivity analyses were largely 
consistent with the primary analysis, thus showing that the conclusion of non-inferiority did not depend on 
the method chosen for the primary analysis. This included tipping point analyses with alternative 
assumptions on seizure probability in drop-outs to alleviate concerns that the primary analysis considering 
drop-outs as non-seizure free could have diluted the difference between treatment arms. Particularly, when 
assuming up to 3 times larger seizure rates in CBZ-CR drop-outs compared to CBZ-CR completers, NI still 
holds at assumed seizure rates for the ESL group 2.5 time higher than for CBZ-CR, thus showing that NI did 
not critically depend on the drop-out seizure frequency. 
Consistent results were also shown for the analyses of seizure-free subjects after 1 year of treatment 
(251/388 [64.7%] versus 279/397 [70.3%] seizure-free patients in the ESL and in the CBZ-CR group, 
respectively; ARD: -5.46%, 95% CI: -11.88; 0.97) as well as for the relative risk difference during the 
evaluation period and during 1 year of treatment.  
Notably, across the different analyses for seizure freedom, the lower bound of the 95% CI was consistently 
close to the -12% margin, in particular when considering 1 year of treatment. For the latter, the lower bound 
of the 95% CI was slightly below -12% when analysed using the Farrington-Manning method in the PP 
population and slightly above for all the other analyses. However, the NI margin of -12% was based on the 
assumption of a 60% seizure freedom rate in the CBZ-CR arm.  
Despite the fact that non-inferiority was robustly demonstrated from a statistical point of view, the majority 
of efficacy analyses show a numerically smaller effect size for ESL compared to CBZ-CR. The probability for 
treatment failure at the end of the evaluation period, i.e. the risk of a seizure at the last evaluated dose 
based on time to event analysis (Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression), was twice as high for patients 
receiving ESL compared to CBZ-CR subjects (12% versus 6%). This finding was seen both overall and when 
limiting the analyses to subjects on dose level A as last evaluated dose. In fact, statistically significant 
superiority of CBZ-CR versus ESL was observed (p=0.0002 for the global KM analysis). At the same time, 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 42/71 
 
  
  
  
the actual probability to be seizure free after 26-weeks of treatment resulting from the Kaplan Meier analysis 
was high with 88% of ESL and in 94% of CBZ-CR subjects with an upper bound of 95% CI of 10.5%. 
Whereas these findings relate to a relatively low risk level of seizures, the CHMP noted that the intended 
patient population of newly diagnosed adults with POS has a comparably high probability to become seizure 
free with effective anti-convulsant therapy, the latter constituting the general treatment aim in these 
patients. Against this background, doubling of the risk of seizure and an absolute difference of 6% cannot be 
ignored. Altogether, the CHMP concluded that the available evidence point towards a slightly lower efficacy 
of ESL compared to CBZ-CR. 
The CHMP furthermore noted the very low incidence of seizures during the 26-week observation period, 
which could be consistent not only with highly effective treatments in the two study arms, but also with a 
patient population at an inherently low risk of seizures. The proportions of patients for whom no seizures 
were actually observed were substantially larger than the point estimate of the primary efficacy analysis 
(Kaplan-Meier estimates of 94% and 88% for CBZ-CR and ESL, respectively). Nevertheless, actual 
6-months seizure freedom rates around 90% in monotherapy studies are not completely unusual. 
Furthermore, at the end of maintenance period (after 1 year of treatment) the proportions of seizure free 
patients resulting from the Kaplan-Meier analysis (89% and 81%, respectively) were lower than at Month 6, 
indicating a general risk of seizures for subjects after a longer observation period. The MAH also argued that 
a newly diagnosed, newly treated population includes, as a principle, a subset of patients with an inherently 
low risk of seizures and that a frequent finding in monotherapy studies is that newly diagnosed epilepsy 
patients respond to their first AED already at a low dose. Based on relevant scientific literature (Hauser et 
al., 1998; Kim et al., 2006; Marson et al., 2008), subjects in study 311, who had a median baseline seizure 
frequency of 4 seizures during the past 1 year prior to enrolment, were considered at risk for recurrence 
within 12 months. According to Hauser et al., subjects with two single unprovoked seizures have a risk of 
recurrence of a third seizure of 76%, with a median time to recurrence of 4.5 months. The CHMP agreed that 
the high proportion of seizure-freedom in both treatment arms of study 311 was likely not attributable to a 
patient population of particularly low risk of seizures. Assay sensitivity was consequently regarded sufficient. 
Similar to the primary analysis, seizure frequencies adjusted for exposure time until the end of the 
Evaluation, Maintenance and Extension periods were higher in the ESL group than the CBZ-CR group at all 
dose levels. In the PP set, seizure frequencies until the end of the different periods ranged from 5.21 to 7.18 
per 100 patient-years in the ESL group and from 3.18 to 3.94 per 100 patient-years in the CBZ-CR group at 
dose level A.  
Furthermore, during the evaluation period there was a trend towards more severe seizure types across the 
3 dose levels in the ESL group compared to CBZ-CR subjects: 32% (ESL) and 19% (CBZ-CR) of seizures 
were secondary generalised, 43% (ESL) and 26% (CBZ-CR) were complex partial and 23% (ESL) and 40% 
(CBZ-CR) were simple partial seizures. At the same time, subgroup analyses by seizure type at baseline 
revealed similar rates of seizure-freedom in subjects with secondary generalised seizures as worst seizure 
type at baseline (ESL: 74.3% and CBZ-CR: 77%, respectively). In response to a CHMP request, the MAH 
presented a subgroup analysis by most frequent seizure type at baseline. In subjects with secondary 
generalised seizures as the most frequent baseline seizure type, which represented the largest of the 
respective 3 subgroups of POS, seizure freedom rate was very similar among both treatment arms (ESL: 
145/192 [75.5%] versus CBZ: 143/191 [74.9%], ARD 0.16% and 95%CI: -8.14; 8.46). The CHMP 
considered this analysis to be indicative that ESL monotherapy is also effective in prevention of secondary 
generalised seizures. No substantial differences between ESL and CBZ-CR treated subjects could be 
concluded with respect to seizure duration.  
The presented subgroup analyses on the primary efficacy variable also seemed to be suggestive of a slightly 
lower efficacy of ESL in subjects with more severe epilepsy in terms of seizure burden, i.e. subjects with a 
seizure frequency of > 4 seizures in the last 3 months prior to baseline (ESL: 67/111 [60.4%], CBZ-CR: 
74/104 [71.2%]; ARD -10.3%, 95%-CI: -22.54; 1.94) as well as in those with > 4 seizures for the past 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 43/71 
 
  
  
  
12 months (ESL: 109/169 [64.5%], CBZ-CR: 134/178 [75.3%]; ARD -8.97%, 95%-CI: -18.39; 0.45). 
Similar results were obtained in subjects previously treated with an AED up to 2 weeks (ESL: 37/60 
[61.7%]), CBZ-CR: 49/57 [86.0%]; ARD -22.2%, 95%-CI: -37.12; -7.28). While for all these subgroups, 
lower proportions of seizure-free subjects in the ELS group compared to the CBZ-CR group were seen, at the 
same time, no interaction between treatment and seizure frequency during 1 year of treatment was found. 
However, interaction tests have a low power and non-significant interaction does not provide reliable 
evidence for absence of such interaction. The CHMP acknowledged, that the subgroup of patients with 
> 4 seizures within 3 months prior to baseline (consisting of < 30% of study subjects) as well as the 
subgroup with previous AED use (approximately 15% of study subjects) were small and therefore results 
should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore previous short term AED use can only be regarded as rather 
vaguely indicative of disease severity.  
There were no apparent differences with regards to efficacy in older subjects (≥65 years) compared to 
younger subjects (< 65 years). The proportion of seizure-free patients aged ≥65 years was very similar in 
patients receiving ESL compared to CBZ-CR during the evaluation period (16/26 [61.5%] ESL subjects and 
20/31 [64.5%] CBZ-CR subjects) and the combined evaluation and maintenance period (14/26 [53.8%] ESL 
subjects and 16/31 [51.6%] CBZ-CR subjects).  
The results after 1 year of treatment could be regarded as indicative of maintenance of the effect of ESL. 
However, by the cut-off date of the study report, the maintenance phase had only been completed by 59.9% 
of subjects in the ESL group and 64.1% in the CBZ-CR group. Further, the probability to withdraw from the 
study at any dose level due to AEs or lack of effect (treatment retention time) was similar between ESL and 
CBZ-CR groups up to Day 240 (8 months), but increased thereafter in the ESL group to a larger extent than 
for CBZ-CR. Likewise, the percentage of discontinuations from the study due to any reason was similar for 
both treatment groups during the initial phase of the study (first 3 months of treatment) and increased 
afterwards in the ESL more than in the CBZ-CR group. In an effort to justify maintenance of efficacy, the 
MAH clarified that in fact at the cut-off date of the study report only 6 patients (3 in each arm) had been 
ongoing in the maintenance phase. Also, the most frequent reason for drop outs during the maintenance 
period in both treatment groups was lack of efficacy (5.2% of ESL and 3.9% of CBZ-CR subjects), whereas 
AEs accounted for 0.7% and 1.5% of discontinuations of ESL and CBZ-CR subjects, respectively. The MAH 
also provided an analysis of seizure-freedom during the maintenance period for subjects on a stable dose for 
at least 1 year in which subjects with insufficient treatment time were considered non-seizure free, resulting 
in a similar ARD of ESL compared to CBZ-CR of -5.09 compared to the primary analysis with a lower limit of 
the 95%% CI of -11.76. Overall, the findings for the maintenance phase were essentially in line with the 
observations during the evaluation phase. Therefore, maintenance of effect of ESL in POS monotherapy 
could be regarded as sufficiently justified. 
Finally, the CHMP critically reviewed the added value of the new maximum daily dose of 1600 mg ESL given 
that the design of study 311 did not allow for assessment of dose-response relationship. Furthermore, most 
patients in the ESL group remained at the lowest possible dose level A (800 mg QD, 271/401) and only 15% 
(60/401) required up-titration to the maximum allowed dose of 1600 mg ESL QD (level C). However, the 
finding of a retention rate at dose level C of 43.4% ESL subjects during the evaluation period and 69.6% ESL 
subjects during the maintenance period, indicates that a relevant subset of the subjects who were not 
seizure free at 1200 mg ESL did profit from a further increase of the ESL dose up to 1600 mg/day. Therefore, 
the CHMP was of the view that a maximum dose of 1600 mg/day could be recommended provided that 
safety and tolerability are also acceptable (see section 2.5. ). However, as only few elderly patients were 
recruited into the study (less than 8% of the study population) and since amongst these, only one single 
patient received ESL at the maximum dose of 1600 mg/day, the CHMP was of the view that the new 
proposed maximum dose could not be recommended for this population.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Whereas the pivotal clinical study concluded on non-inferiority of ESL compared to CBZ-CR based on the 
pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -12%, the risk of seizure at the last evaluated dose doubled from 6% 
in the CBZ-CR group to 12% in the ESL group and throughout the efficacy analyses a consistent trend 
towards a slightly lower efficacy of ESL compared to CBZ-CR was observed, in particular with regard to more 
severe epilepsy. However, in the context of a population at risk of recurring seizures, the resulting Kaplan 
Meier seizures freedom estimates of more than 80% during 1 year of treatment clearly indicate efficacy of 
ESL. Overall, the CHMP considered that the available clinical efficacy data were adequate to support the 
present application for an extension of indication of Zebinix to monotherapy of adult epilepsy patients with 
POS with or without secondary generalisation at doses up to 1600 mg/day.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
At the time of this application, ESL was approved in the EU for use as adjunctive therapy in adults with POS 
with or without secondary generalisation. The known safety profile of ESL was largely based on the data from 
placebo-controlled Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials with ESL as adjunctive therapy in adult epileptic 
subjects supporting the initial marketing authorisation application (Studies BIA-2093-201, -301, -302, and 
-303 [hereafter referred to as studies 201, 301, 302, and 303]). A subsequent Phase 3 study BIA-2093-304 
(study 304) supplemented the original safety database.  
In these studies, a dose-dependent increase in treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was observed 
for several Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ classes (SOCs), including 
possibly related TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study medication. As per the original 
marketing authorisation application for Zebinix, TEAEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 8.7%, 
11.6%, and 19.3% of the patients receiving 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg ESL, respectively, based on an 
integrated safety data analysis. In the subsequent study 304 (Part 1) discontinuations due to TEAEs were 
reported for 12% and 25.7% of subjects with doses of 800 mg and 1200 mg ESL.  
The most common TEAEs in the placebo-controlled trials in adult epileptic subjects were dizziness, 
somnolence (very common, i.e. in ≥1/10 patients), headache and nausea (common, i.e. in ≥1/100 to <1/10 
patients). There were no changes in laboratory parameters that indicated a safety concern and there were 
also no clinically relevant changes in vital signs, body weight or body mass index (BMI) during the studies.  
Limited data in paediatrics were available from studies BIA-2093-305 and -208. The safety profile observed 
in children was generally consistent with the profile in adults. In children, the most common side effects 
were diplopia (double vision, seen in around 5 patients in 100), somnolence (seen in around 8 patients in 
100) and vomiting (seen in around 5 patients in 100). 
Furthermore, ESL is a third-generation dibenz/b,f/azepine AED and is closely related to oxcarbazepine. 
Following oral administration of both active substances, the same active moieties, i.e. eslicarbazepine, 
R-licarbazepine and oxcarbazepine, are found in plasma, though in somewhat different proportions. 
Therefore, class related adverse reactions which have been reported with oxcarbazepine including rare 
adverse reactions such as bone marrow depression, anaphylactic reactions, severe cutaneous reactions 
(e.g. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome), systemic lupus erythematosus or serious cardiac arrhythmias, while not 
observed during the ESL epilepsy clinical development program, cannot be excluded with ESL use.  
The safety assessment of the present application for use of ESL as POS monotherapy in adults was mainly 
based on the results of the (ongoing) pivotal double-blind active-controlled Phase 3 study 311. Pooled safety 
findings from the 2 conversion-to-monotherapy Phase 3 studies 045 and -046 were provided as supportive 
data. For an overview of the study design see section 2.4.  
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 45/71 
 
  
  
  
Safety was assessed in all three studies by collecting data for AEs, safety laboratory variables, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) readings, vital signs, physical examinations, and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C-SSRS). In addition, study 311 collected data on neurological examinations and Bond-Lader visual 
analogue scales (BL-VAS). TEAEs were summarised by treatment group and dose. TEAEs were defined as all 
AEs with onset or worsening after first intake of randomised investigational medicinal product until 4 weeks 
after last intake of randomised investigational medicinal product. The number and percentage of subjects 
with a TEAE were tabulated by MedDRA SOC and preferred term (PT).  
TEAEs were also summarised by relationship to study drug, and by maximum intensity. The assessment of 
the relationship/causality of a TEAE to treatment in study 311 was a clinical decision by the investigator 
based on all available information at the time of the completion of the electronic case report form.  
During the course of the procedure, the MAH provided additional data from a long term open label extension 
study (study 093 050), which enrolled subjects who had completed, discontinued, or exited from studies 
093-045 or 046 and completed at least the first 3 weeks of the 18-week double-blind treatment period. The 
purpose of Study 093 050 was to confirm the long term safety and tolerability of ESL administered in a 
flexible dose range of 800 mg to 2400 mg once-daily in subjects with POS, with or without secondary 
generalization. The initial study duration was 1-year with the option of continuing study drug treatment 
post-1-year until a subject discontinued the study. The cut-off date for this study was 21 March 2014. 
Patient exposure 
As of the date of data-cut-off for this application (24-Sep-2015), a total of 1178 epileptic adult subjects with 
POS had been enrolled and treated in the 3 clinical studies supporting this application (311, 045 and 046). 
Of these, 766 subjects were exposed to at least 1 dose or repeated doses of up to a maximum of 
1600 mg/day of oral ESL monotherapy. 
• 
Pivotal study 311 
The safety set of study 311 included all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational medicinal 
product. These were a total of 401 and 412 patients in the ESL and CBZ-CR group, respectively. All subjects 
were analysed according to the treatment received. Subjects receiving more than 1 type of investigational 
medicinal product in error were analysed according to the treatment they received the longest. 
The total mean treatment duration was shorter in the ESL group (577.1 days) compared to the CBZ-CR 
group (614.7 days) since patients in ESL dose level B and C had a shorter total mean treatment duration 
than the respective CBZ-CR dose levels (dose level B: ESL 494.8 days vs. CBZ-CR 641.3 days; dose level C: 
ESL 411.9 days vs. CBZ-CR 523.4 days). Treatment duration was similar in the 2 treatment groups at dose 
level A (ESL 635.0 days, CBZ-CR 619.3 days).

distribution was observed in the CBZ-CR group. Only 15% of subjects (60 of 401) in study 311 were in the 
highest dose group C. 
•  Supportive study pool (conversion-to-monotherapy studies 045 and 046) 
A total of 365 subjects were exposed to at least 1 dose of ESL (123 patients in the ESL 1200 mg QD and 
242 patients in the ESL 1600 mg QD group). The overall median number of days of overall ESL 
administration (1200 and 1600 mg/d) during the 18-week double-blind period was 126.0 days (range: 1 to 
147 days). The overall median of the average daily ESL dose was 1571.4 mg (range: 70 to 1686 mg) over 
the AED taper/conversion and monotherapy periods. A total of 66 of 242 subjects, who received 1600 mg 
ESL (27.3%) have been exposed for at least 18 weeks (4.5 months).  
• 
Long-term open label extension of conversion-to-monotherapy studies 045 and 046 (study 050) 
In study 050 as of the cut-off date, 274 subjects received at least 1 dose of study medication. A total of 
65.7% of subjects completed the 1-year period, 8.8% were ongoing in the 1-year period, and 25.5% of 
subjects discontinued during the 1-year period. Subjects were allowed to increase the ESL dose to a 
maximum dose of 2400 mg QD and there were 90 subjects who used doses ≥2000 mg (modal dose), and 
73 of these were on treatment for at least a year.  
The overall median number of days of ESL administration combined across studies was 490.0 days (range: 
1 to 1671 days). There was 542.4 subject-years of exposure for ESL-treated subjects overall, of which 195.1 
subject-years of exposure was in the highest dose category (ESL ≥ 2000 mg). A total of 257 subjects had a 
duration of ESL exposure of more than 6 months, 225 subjects had a duration of ESL exposure of more than 
1 year, and 134 subjects had a duration of ESL exposure of more than 2 years. For modal daily doses ≥ 
1400 mg ESL (representing the 1600 mg, 2000 mg, and 2400 mg doses), there were 212 subjects with ESL 
exposure of more than 6 months, 190 subjects with ESL exposure of more than 12 months, and 113 subjects 
had a duration of ESL exposure more than 2 years. 
Adverse events  
• 
Pivotal Study 311 
Similar percentages of subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE in the ESL and CBZ-CR group (75.3% and 
77.7%). At dose level A (i.e. the dose level at which the majority of subjects in both groups completed the 
Evaluation Period), the incidence of TEAEs was comparable between treatment groups (ESL: 76.0%, 
CBZ-CR: 79.5%) (see Table 12). Overall, TEAEs possibly related to treatment were reported by fewer 
subjects in the ESL group (41.1%) than in the CBZ-CR group (49.5%), which was also true when comparing 
ESL and CBZ-CR at dose levels A and C, but the opposite was observed at dose level B (ESL: 52.9%, 
CBZ-CR: 42.6%). 
Both treatment groups had a similar overall incidence of serious TEAEs (ESL: 10.0%, CBZ-CR: 10.9%), 
whereas more subjects in the ESL dose groups B and C had serious TEAEs compared to the respective 
CBZ-CR dose groups (12.9% for ESL vs. 6.6% for CBZ-CR in dose group B and 15% for ESL vs. 2.9% for 
CBZ-CR in dose group C). A similar distribution could be detected for possibly related serious TEAEs. Fewer 
subjects discontinued treatment due to TEAEs in the ESL group (13.5%) than the CBZ-CR group (18.0%) 
(see Table 11). Four subjects (2 in each treatment group) experienced TEAEs that were fatal (glioblastoma 
multiforme and cardiac arrest in the ESL group, suicide and lung adenocarcinoma in the CBZ-CR group).

TEAEs by SOC and PT 
Overall, TEAE incidence rates were lower for ESL compared to CBZ-CR. The pattern of TEAEs was found to 
be in accordance with the known safety profile of the two drugs (see Table 13).  
Most commonly reported TEAEs irrespective of dose levels/groups (>15% of subjects in any treatment 
group) were reported for the following SOCs: nervous system disorders, infections and infestations, 
investigations, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders and administrative site conditions and 
psychiatric disorders.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs (>10% of subjects in any treatment group) were headache (ESL: 
22.9%, CBZ-CR: 21.8%) and dizziness (ESL: 13.7%, CBZ-CR: 12.4%; Table 7). At dose levels A and B, 
headache and dizziness were reported by similar proportions of subjects in either treatment group, while at 
dose level C, the incidence for both these events was lower in the ESL group (headache: 15.0% ESL versus 
23.5% CBZ-CR; dizziness: 16.7% ESL versus 26.5% CBZ-CR).  
Relevant differences between groups (defined as a difference of ≥10%) were only found for the TEAE 
gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) increased (4.0% of subjects in the ESL group and 14.6% in the CBZ-CR 
group). Increased GGT was reported by lower proportions of subjects in the ESL group at all dose levels 
(ranging from 1.7% at dose level C to 7.1% at dose level B) than the CBZ-CR group (ranging from 11.5% at 
dose level B to 20.6% at dose level C). 
Nasopharyngitis was found at slightly higher incidences in dose groups B and C for ESL compared to CBZ-CR 
(ESL dose group B and C: 7.1% and 10% versus CBZ-CR dose group B and C: 1.6% and 5.9%).  
Hyponatraemia was reported at a slightly higher incidence in subjects on ESL compared to CBZ-CR for each 
dose group (ESL Dose Group A, B and C: 1.5%, 7.1% and 5% versus CBZ-CR Dose Group A, B and C: 0.9%, 
0% and 2.9%). 
When comparing TEAEs by last evaluated individual dose (dose groups A, B, and C), a trend was observed 
towards dose-related increases in the incidences of some of the AEs including abdominal pain, abdominal 
pain upper, asthenia, fatigue, malaise, fall, aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased, memory impairment, tremor, depressed mood, and mood altered. However, in 
other instances, no trend or even an inverse dose-relationship could be seen.

Possibly related TEAEs 
Overall incidences of TEAEs (PTs) considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment 
were similar between ESL and CBZ-CR (41.1% and 49.5%, see table 8).  
Table 14 – TEAEs considered at least possibly related to treatment reported in >2% of subjects

Incidences of nausea and increased GGT were notably lower in the ESL group (>2% difference between 
groups), whereas hyponatraemia occurred more often in the ESL group compared to CBZ-CR (2.5% vs. 
1%). 
TEAEs by intensity 
The majority of subjects reported TEAEs that were mild in both treatment groups (69.6% and 71.4% of ESL 
and CBZ-CR subjects, respectively). The rates of moderate and severe events were similar for both groups. 
•  Supportive study pool (conversion-to-monotherapy studies 045 and 046) 
Overview of TEAEs 
A total of 287 of the 365 subjects (78.6%) in the conversion-to-monotherapy trials reported TEAEs. TEAEs 
were reported at a higher incidence in the 1600 mg dose group compared to the 1200 mg dose group 
(81.4% [197/242] and 73.2% [90/123], respectively). Severe and serious TEAEs revealed a similar pattern 
(6.6% [16/242] each in the 1600 mg dose group vs 4.1% [5/123] each in the 1200 mg dose group). 
Discontinuation due to TEAEs was almost twice as high in the 1600 mg dose group compared to the 1200 mg 
dose group (15.3% [37/242] vs. 8.1% [10/123]). 
In study 045 more subjects on 1600 mg ESL had a TEAE leading to dose reduction compared to the 1200 mg 
dose group (9.4% vs. 4.6%). In study 046, more subjects on 1200 mg ESL had a TEAE leading to dose 
reduction compared to 1600 mg (5.2% vs. 3.5%). 
TEAEs by SOC and PT 
The most commonly reported TEAEs (≥10% of subjects in either treatment group) were in line with those 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 50/71 
 
  
  
  
 
 
seen in study 311 for the following SOCs: nervous system disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, infections 
and infestations, general disorders and psychiatric disorders. They were headache, dizziness, fatigue, 
somnolence, nausea, and back pain. 
Somnolence was reported in 6.7% of ESL treated subjects and in 8.3% of CBZ-CR treated subjects. The 
incidence was ≥5% higher in the 1600 mg dose group (13.6%) compared to the 1200 mg dose group 
(7.3%). A higher incidence in the 1600 mg dose group compared to the 1200 mg dose group was also found 
for the following TEAEs: asthenia (2.9% vs. 0.8%), blood sodium decreased (2.5% vs. 0%), hypertension 
(3.3% vs. 0.8%). 
• 
Long-term open label extension study 050 
In study 050, the overall incidence of TEAEs (82.8%) was similar to the overall incidence for the 
monotherapy historical controlled study pool. The most-commonly reported TEAEs were headache (25.9%), 
dizziness (18.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.7%), fatigue (9.9%), back pain (8.0%), depression (8.0%), and fall 
(8.0%). The type and frequency of common TEAEs and medically-significant events (< 1% of subjects) were 
generally similar to those observed for the monotherapy historical controlled study pool. 
Use of higher doses was associated with a similar overall pattern of AEs compared with the lower dose 
groups (representing 800, 1200, and 1600 mg average doses). In the 3 highest dose groups, the rates for 
“any TEAE” were not dose-related: 91.2% (1000 to < 1400 mg), 78.1% (1400 to < 2000 mg), and 84.4% 
(≥ 2000 mg). Only headache (20.6%, 24.1%, and 27.8% of subjects, respectively) and blurred vision 
(2.9%, 4.4%, and 5.6% of subjects, respectively) showed a small dose response (i.e., an increase in 
incidence across increasing ESL modal daily dose categories). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Overall, 5 subjects died during the three Phase 3 studies. None of the deaths was considered related to ESL. 
In study 311, 4 subjects (2 in the ESL group [0.5%] and 2 in the CBZ-CR group [0.5%]) died due to TEAEs: 
•  A 61 year old male on ESL 400 mg QD with glioblastoma multiforme, diagnosed 12 days after 
treatment initiation with ESL, discontinued ESL and died on Day 74. This condition may have been 
present as underlying disease triggering seizures.  
•  A 63 year old male on ESL 800 mg QD died due to cardiac arrest on Day 97. The subject was 
reported to have had multiple underlying cardiac risk factors. The event was considered unrelated to 
ESL. 
•  A 56 year old male on CBZ-CR 200 mg BID committed suicide on Day 35. No history of suicidal 
history. Hence, the event was considered possibly related to treatment (suicidal risk is a class effect 
of AEDs) 
•  A 71 year old male on CBZ-CR 200 mg BID was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma on Day 43 and 
died 2.5 years later. The event was considered unrelated to CBZ-CR and present as an underlying 
condition. 
In the supportive studies 045 and 046, there was one death in the ESL 1200 mg dose group due to multiple 
injuries following a road traffic accident considered not related to treatment. 
In study 050, there were two on-treatment deaths (metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with pneumonia, 
and sudden unexplained death in epilepsy [SUDEP]). In addition, there was 1 post-treatment SUDEP. The 
death cases were considered not related to study drug or treatment.

Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
In the pivotal study 311, the incidence of serious TEAEs was similar in the ESL group (10.0%) and the 
CBZ-CR group (10.9%). Serious TEAEs reported by >1 subject in the ESL group were status epilepticus 
(0.7%), craniocerebral injury (0.5%) and epilepsy (0.5%). In the CBZ-CR group, syncope (1.0%), 
convulsion (0.7%), appendicitis (0.5%), atrial fibrillation (0.5%), head injury (0.5%), inguinal hernia 
(0.5%), partial seizures (0.5%) and pulmonary embolism (0. 5%) were reported by >1 subject.  
In the supportive studies 045 and 046, the most commonly reported serious TEAE (≥1 subject in any 
treatment group) was hyponatraemia (1600 mg: 1.2%, 1200 mg: 0%). In the open-label extension study 
050 the type of SAEs was generally similar, but as expected the frequency of SAEs was higher (16.8%) 
compared to the monotherapy historical controlled study pool (5.8%) due to the difference in duration of the 
studies. 
TEAEs of special interest 
TEAEs of special interest included events known to be particularly relevant to treatment with AEDs, and were 
defined as follows: 
•  Study 311: TEAEs of special interest were defined using the following standardised MedDRA queries 
(SMQs): behavioural/psychiatric events, central nervous system events, severe cutaneous adverse 
reactions, cerebrovascular disorders, agranulocytosis, dyslipidaemia, haemopoietic cytopenias, 
depression and suicide/self-injury, haemorrhages, cardiac arrhythmias, torsade de pointes/QT 
prolongation, neurological AEs, and hyponatraemia. In addition, hepatic disorder TEAEs (as defined 
by the SMQ “drug-related hepatic disorders”) were presented. 
• 
Pooled studies 045 and 046: medically significant events included allergic reactions (including rash 
and hypersensitivity), suicide attempt, elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) to 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN), hypothyroidism. 
In study 311, frequencies for neurological adverse events, neurological disorders, behavioural/psychiatric 
events, depression and suicide/self-injury, mental impairment disorders, haematopoietic cytopenias, 
seizures, agranulocytosis, cerebrovascular disorders were similar for both treatment groups.  
There was a higher incidence (≥2% more) in the ESL group compared to the CBZ-CR group for the SMQs 
headaches (ESL: 27.9%, CBZ-CR: 24.0%), haemorrhages (ESL: 9.0%, CBZ-CR: 7.0%), hyponatraemia 
(ESL: 4.5%, CBZ-CR: 1.5%) and movement disorders (ESL: 3.7%, CBZ-CR: 1.7%). 
There was a higher incidence (≥2% more) in the CBZ-CR group compared to ESL for the SMQs 
behavioural/psychiatric events (ESL: 15.2%, CBZ-CR: 18.2%), cardiac arrhythmias (ESL: 6.7%, CBZ-CR: 
10.2%), dyslipidaemia (ESL: 4.5%, CBZCR: 7.0%) and QT prolongation (ESL: 2.5%, CBZ-CR: 4.6%). 
Hepatic disorder TEAEs were analysed separately and found to have higher incidences in the CBZ-CR group 
compared to ESL (19.7% vs. 10.2%). The difference was most pronounced for GGT increased (CBZ-CR: 
14.8% vs. ESL: 4%).  
TEAEs in the SOC skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders were reported for 11.2% of ESL subjects and 
15.0% of CBZ-CR subjects including rash (3.2% of ESL subjects and 2.9% CBZ-CR subjects) and allergic 
dermatitis (0.5% of ESL subjects and 2.4% of CBZ-CR subjects). Severe cutaneous adverse reactions were 
observed in 4 (1.0%) and 8 (1.9%) patients in the ESL and CBZ-CR group, respectively. Cutaneous TEAEs 
(including all PTs of the SOC “skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders”, and the PTs “drug hypersensitivity” 
and “hypersensitivity” from the SOC “immune system disorders”) assessed as at least possibly related by 
the investigator occurred in 6.2% and 8.7% of the ESL and CBZ-CR patients, respectively. 
In studies 045 and 046, the incidence of allergic reactions, including rash and hypersensitivity (overall 
5.8%) was comparable between dose groups. In study 046, 7 subjects have been reported with at least one 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 52/71 
 
  
  
  
rash-related TEAE with a majority (all but one) of subjects receiving 1600 mg ESL. There were no cases of 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. There was 1 case with Drug Reaction with 
Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) identified by the investigator. Two serious TEAEs resulted in 
discontinuation (rash pruritic and DRESS). One subject in the 1200 mg dose group reported a TEAE of 
suicidal ideation.  
Based on the C-SSRS, 1 subject (also in the 1200 mg dose group,) had an aborted suicide attempt; no 
suicide-related TEAE was reported for this subject.  
Two subjects (0.8%) reported elevations of AST and/or ALT to >3 × ULN. Both subjects received ESL doses 
of 1600 mg (rated as clinically significant in one of these subjects).  
Hypothyroidism was reported in 3 ESL-treated subjects (0.8%) in the 1600 mg group. Subjects had a 
medical history of thyroid disease or baseline abnormalities. 
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations included measurement of biochemistry, haematology, coagulation, thyroid 
function, bone turnover markers and urinalysis parameters. Parameters were classified as normal or 
abnormal according to the laboratories normal ranges and as clinically significant according to pre-specified 
significance criteria. 
In study 311, main changes and differences between treatment groups in biochemistry parameters have 
been reported for GGT and bilirubin. Individual clinically significant abnormalities (as defined by the 
investigator) were generally low and comparable between treatment groups. 
Total bilirubin decreased over time with larger mean decreases in the CBZ-CR group compared to the ESL 
group at most post-baseline visits. However, values were still within the normal range at all visits for the 
majority of subjects in both treatment groups (>94%). Differences in total bilirubin >ULN [Grade 1] were 
reported for 4.3% of subjects in the ESL group compared to 1.7% of subjects in the CBZ-CR group. Values 
>1.5x ULN (Grade 2) were also found more frequently in subjects on ESL compared to CBZ-CR (1.3% vs. 
0.2%). Clinically significant total bilirubin values (as defined by the investigator) at any post-baseline visit 
were reported for 1.0% of ESL treated subjects compared to none in the CBZ-CR group. This finding 
somewhat contradicts reports of values over time indicative of a decrease in total bilirubin, which was more 
pronounced in the CBZ-CR group.  
Regarding hepatic dysfunction, there was no additional concern related to transaminases increases of ALT, 
AST or alkaline phosphatase with frequency of significant values similar in ESL and CBZ-CR groups (≤3% in 
either group). Combined elevations of hepatic parameters were low without relevant differences. There were 
also no relevant differences between treatment groups for ALT or AST >3 × ULN together with TEAE data. 
GGT was within the normal range for 86.8% of ESL subjects and 85.2% CBZ-CR subjects at baseline and 
above the normal range for 13.4% of ESL subjects and 14.2% of CBZ-CR subjects. At the final 
evaluation/early discontinuation visit, 21% of ESL subjects had a value above the normal range whereas 
50% of CBZ-CR subjects had a value above the normal range. A total of 40 subjects (10.0%) in the ESL 
group compared to 116 (28.2%) in the CBZ-CR group had a change to an abnormally high value for GGT at 
endpoint. Individual clinically significant changes (as defined by the investigator) were reported for 7.1% of 
subjects from the ESL group and 18.2% of subjects in the CBZ-CR group). 
Mean sodium levels were within the normal range. However, changes from baseline to lower values were 
more pronounced in patients receiving ESL compared to CBZ-CR. At final evaluation/early discontinuation 
visit, 8.2% of ESL subjects had a value below the normal range whereas only 2% of CBZ-CR subjects had a 
value below the normal range. The majority of subjects in both the ESL group (91.9%) and the CBZ-CR 
group (97.7%) had sodium values >130 mEq/L. Sodium decrease from baseline of >10 mEq/L was seen in 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 53/71 
 
  
  
  
11.1% of ESL-treated subjects compared to 3.4% of CBZ-CR-treated subjects. Sodium levels ≤125 mEq/L 
were found in 1.5% of subjects in the ESL group and 0.2% in the CBZ-CR group. A shift in sodium levels from 
normal at baseline to low at endpoint was reported for 12 (3%) subjects on ESL and 5 (1.2%) of subjects on 
CBZ-CR. Clinically significant values for sodium at any post baseline evaluation were found for 4.3% of 
subjects on ESL and 1.5% of subjects on CBZ-CR. An overview of different sodium levels by dose groups is 
provided in Table 14. 
Table 15 – Hyponatremia/Sodium Levels by Treatment Group and Individual Dose – Study 311 
(Safety Set) 
CBZ-CR = carbamazepine controlled-release; ESL = eslicarbazepine acetate; N = number of subjects with any 
post-baseline sodium assessment; n = number of subjects with minimum post-baseline value within the category; Rand 
= Randomised Treatment Group. 
No clinically relevant changes over time or differences between the treatment groups were observed for the 
parameters of haematology, coagulation, thyroid function, urinalysis or bone turnover markers.  
As for changes at an individual level, any change from a normal laboratory value at baseline to an 
abnormally low or high value post-baseline was found with similar frequency between treatment groups. 
Abnormalities (difference of ≥5% between treatment groups) have been reported for GGT (see above) as 
well as for chloride, whereby 75 subjects (18.7%) in the ESL group compared to 45 (10.9%) in the CBZ-CR 
group had a change to an abnormally low value for chloride at endpoint. 
Furthermore, statistically significant differences between treatment groups when considering any 
post-baseline visit under the last evaluated dose were observed for chloride (2.0% of ESL subjects versus 
0% of CBZ-CR subjects), HDL-cholesterol (0.5% of ESL subjects versus 2.7% of CBZ-CR subjects), sodium 
(4.3% of ESL subjects versus 1.5% of CBZ-CR subjects) and platelets (0.3% of ESL subjects versus 2.0% of 
CBZ-CR subjects). 
In studies 045 and 046, there were no apparent changes of clinical significance from baseline to the lowest 
or highest on-treatment values for the haematology, serum chemistry (including lipid parameters or 
bone-turnover markers), urinalysis or coagulation parameters for either ESL dose group. This is also valid 
for sodium.  
Since no comparator was included in these studies, results were most of all valuable for judging the 
frequency of abnormalities at the different doses. Abnormally low sodium levels of clinical significance 
post-baseline have been found in 4.1% of subjects on 1200 mg ESL and in 7% of subjects on 1600 mg ESL. 
Overall, the incidences were low for the minimum post-baseline sodium level categories of ≤125 mEq/L 
(3.3%), >125 to ≤130 mEq/L (7.0%) and for decreases from baseline >10 mEq/L (7.8%). Incidences were 
similar across both ESL dose groups for each minimum sodium category.  
Vital signs and physical findings  
In study 311, no clinically relevant vital signs changes over time or differences between treatment groups in 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 54/71 
 
  
  
  
 
 
terms of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body weight or BMI have been reported. The 
incidence of clinically relevant vital sign findings at post-baseline visits was similar to the baseline incidence 
in each treatment group and no differences were found between treatment groups (ESL: 7.8%, CBZ-CR: 
10.6%). Results were similar when considering clinically relevant findings at any dose given during the 
study. The assessment of physical examination findings revealed fewer subjects on ESL compared to 
CBZ-CR with worsening from baseline to post-baseline mainly due to assessment of skin (3.6% vs. 7.5%). 
The supportive study pool (studies 045 and 046) did not reveal additional issues. The only potentially 
clinically significant values, which have been noted, were high weight with a change from baseline ≥7% 
(1600 mg: 9.2%, 1200 mg: 2.5%) and low weight with a change from baseline ≤-7% (1600 mg: 2.9%, 
1200 mg: 4.9%).  
ECGs showed similar incidences of clinically relevant abnormalities for both treatment groups in study 311 
(ESL: 3.0%, CBZ-CR: 3.2%). First degree atrioventricular block developed post-baseline in 2 subjects in the 
ESL group and 3 subjects in the CBZ-CR group. No additional concern derived from the supportive studies. 
Changes in parameters were similar for both dosing groups.  
The incidence of worsening of neurological examinations findings post baseline was low with no relevant 
differences between treatment groups in either the pivotal study 311 or the supportive study pool.  
Other observations related to safety  
Suicidality was assessed as per C-SSRS and found to be low in terms of ideation and behaviour in both 
treatment groups in study 311. The incidences of suicide-related events were also low and similar between 
treatment groups. A total of 3.5% of ESL subjects and 3.4% of CBZ-CR subjects reported improvement in 
suicidal ideation at the end of the study. One subject committed suicide in study 311 while receiving CBZ-CR 
(considered possibly related to treatment).  
In the supportive study pool, there were no completed suicides. The overall incidence of any suicidality (i.e. 
at least 1 occurrence of suicidal behaviour or ideation) was 3.6%; incidence of baseline suicidality was 1.6%. 
Safety in special populations 
Extrinsic or intrinsic factors have not been formally evaluated in study 311 but have been analysed in the 
supportive conversion-to-monotherapy study pool: 
Intrinsic factors comprised age, gender, race, ethnicity, and weight. Most subjects were in the age group 18 
to 65 years, and hence, no comparison between different age groups was conducted. In regard to gender 
(balanced), more TEAEs have been reported for females than for males (83.7% vs. 73.1%). None of the 
common TEAEs/laboratory parameters/vital signs/ ECG parameters differed by more than 10% across 
gender categories. 
Race was predominantly Caucasians. Blacks and other race groups had similar overall frequencies of TEAEs 
and only few TEAEs differed in frequency by more than 10% across races (dizziness, fatigue). 
There was no indication for a particular safety risk associated with ESL treatment in different weight 
categories.  
Extrinsic factors comprised effect of the number of baseline AEDs and of the use of baseline AEDs on the 
safety profile of ESL. Differences in the incidences of overall and common TEAEs across a number of baseline 
AEDs and baseline AED use/non-use (except oxcarbazepine) were generally small, exhibited no meaningful 
patterns and were not considered clinically meaningful. Co-administration of ESL and oxcarbazepine was 
associated with a greater incidence of individual TEAEs than ESL alone and the difference was more than 
10% for dizziness (50.0% vs. 19.8% for oxcarbazepine users/non-users) and vomiting (22.7% versus 5.2% 
for oxcarbazepine users/non-users). 
EMA/304195/2017

No new information derived for use of ESL in pregnancy and lactation. Overdose (accidental) was reported 
in the US study pool (n=2 subjects) and confirmed available data on ESL overdose in subjects with 
adjunctive ESL treatment. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study 311, overall, fewer subjects discontinued ESL treatment (13.5%) compared to CBZ-CR (18.0%). 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported for 11.8%, 24.3%, and 8.3% of subjects 
treated with 800 mg, 1200 mg, and 1600 mg ESL. In contrast, 18%, 19.7%, and 14.7% of subjects treated 
with 200 mg BID, 400 mg BID, and 600 mg BID CBZ-CR were reported to have discontinued study. Adverse 
events leading to discontinuation in more than 2 subjects in either treatment group were fatigue (7 and 3 
patients on ESL and CBZ-CR, respectively), nausea (5 and 5 patients on ESL and CBZ-CR, respectively), 
dizziness and rash (each 4 and 4 patients on ESL and CBZ-CR, respectively), disturbances in attention (3 
patients on ESL), somnolence (3 and 3 patients on ESL and CBZ-CR, respectively), dermatitis allergic (2 and 
7 patients on ESL and CBZ-CR, respectively), headache (2 and 6 patients on ESL and CBZ-CR, respectively), 
convulsion (1 and 4 patients on ESL and CBZ-CR, respectively), GGT increased (1 and 3 patients on ESL and 
CBZ-CR, respectively), and hypersensitivity (4 patients on CBZ-CR). No subjects in the ESL group 
discontinued due to hyponatraemia. 
In studies 045 and 046, the overall incidence of TEAEs resulting in discontinuation was higher in the 
1600 mg ESL group than the 1200 mg group (1600 mg: 15.3%, 1200 mg: 8.1%). The most commonly 
reported TEAEs resulting in discontinuation (>2 subjects overall) were complex partial seizures (1600 mg: 
2.1%, 1200 mg: 0.8%), hyponatraemia (1600 mg: 1.2%, 1200 mg: 1.6%), depression (1600 mg: 1.2%, 
1200 mg: 0%) and nausea (1600 mg: 0.8%, 1200 mg: 0.8%). 
In study 050, the type of TEAEs resulting in discontinuation was similar compared to the monotherapy 
historical controlled study pool, but frequencies were lower for the extension study (8.0%) than for the 
monotherapy historical controlled study pool (12.9%). The only TEAEs resulting in discontinuation reported 
by more than 1 subject were partial seizures with secondary generalization (2 [0.7%] subjects) and 
depression (2 [0.7%] subjects). 
Post marketing experience 
Patient exposure to marketed Zebinix, Exalief and Aptiom was estimated on the basis of worldwide 
ex-factory sales for the period from the time of marketing authorisation until 31-Aug-2015. During this 
period, ex-factory cumulative amounts reached a total of 33,289,762 units (1 unit = 1 tablet) sold and 
delivered in 22 countries. As of 21-Oct-2015, the estimated patient exposure was 
1,109,658 patient-months. 
ESL safety data from post-marketing sources (including 9 periodic safety update reports [PSURs] since first 
approval of ESL) remains in accordance with cumulative experience during clinical development. 
Cumulatively, 702 serious and 1273 non-serious adverse drug reactions (implied causality) from health 
authorities, literature and spontaneous reports and 47 serious adverse reactions from post-marketing 
non-interventional studies were received. The most common adverse drug reactions were reported in the 
SOCs nervous system disorders (22.3%), general disorders and administration site conditions (13.5%), 
injury, poisoning and procedural complications (11.5%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (10.6%), skin 
and subcutaneous tissue disorders (8.5%), psychiatric disorders (7.4%), and gastrointestinal disorders 
(6.5%). The most commonly reported adverse reaction terms were hyponatraemia (9.5%), seizure (5.3%), 
dizziness (4.1%), rash (2.6%), fatigue (2.1%), and nausea (1.8%).

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
ESL is already indicated as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of POS in adult epilepsy patients at doses of 
up to 1200 mg/day for which safety has been previously evaluated. The safety profile of ESL as POS 
monotherapy was largely derived from the results of the pivotal trial 311 supporting the present application. 
Patients had completed a 1-week titration period and a 26-week evaluation period. An additional 26-week 
maintenance period was still ongoing, and was completed by 59.9% of ESL subjects and 64.1% of CBZ-CR 
subjects. In addition, supportive data from two pooled conversion-to-monotherapy studies (045 and 046) 
were provided. In all three studies, patients could receive ESL up to a maximum daily dose of 1600 mg. 
However, no integrated analysis of the safety data was performed due to differences in study design of the 
pivotal and the supportive studies as well as differences in the indication. Finally, during the course of this 
procedure, the MAH provided additional data from a long term open label extension study (study 093 050), 
which enrolled subjects from studies 045 or 046, to further support the (long-term) safety of the new 
proposed maximum dose of ESL 1600 mg/day.  
In the pivotal study 311, the overall incidence of TEAEs was similar in both treatment groups (75.3% vs 
77.7% in the ESL and CBZ-CR group, respectively). ESL was found slightly favourable over CBZ-CR for at 
least possibly related TEAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation (41.1% vs. 49.5% and 13.5% vs. 18%). 
The frequency of SAEs was similar in both groups (10% for ESL vs 10.9% for CBZ-CR). Two deaths occurred 
in each treatment group. 
Under certain circumstances, concomitant AED treatment was allowed in study 311 (during down-titration 
after discontinuation; benzodiazepines ≤ twice a week). More subjects on higher ESL dose levels (B and C) 
in study 311 used concomitant AEDs compared to those on CBZ-CR. The MAH clarified that the overall 
incidence in TEAEs did not significantly change when TEAEs that occurred during the intake of any new AED 
were excluded (other than an expected slight decrease). 
The data from study 311 (laboratory analyses including values over time, shift analyses, clinically significant 
laboratory values) point towards a more pronounced decrease in sodium with ESL compared to CBZ-CR 
albeit most of the subjects presented with sodium levels >130 mEq/L (>90%). The same trend was 
observed for cases of hyponatraemia albeit the total number of TEAEs was low (ESL: 3% vs. CBZ-CR: 1%) 
and comparable with the incidences seen in the adjunctive treatment program of ESL. The combined 
incidence of ADRs (TEAEs assessed as at least possibly related by the investigator) of hyponatraemia and 
blood sodium increased amounted to 3.7% (ESL) and 1.5% (CBZ-CR). A clear ESL dose relationship was 
seen for cases of hyponatraemia. A similar observation as made in the supportive 
conversion-to-monotherapy study pool.  
At the same time, ESL appears more favourable than CBZ-CR regarding liver enzyme increases, most of all 
depicted as ‘GGT increased’. The incidence of increases of GGT was more than 10 times higher with CBZ-CR 
than with ESL (14.6% versus 4%). At the same time, there was a slightly higher number of subjects with 
clinically significant abnormally total bilirubin values in the ESL group compared to CBZ-CR (1% versus 0%), 
although overall, a decrease in total bilirubin was observed in both groups over time. Generally, mean 
laboratory values over time did not raise any new concerns with ESL but supported TEAEs reported in the 
monotherapy study program. Likewise, findings for vital signs and from physical examinations remained 
unremarkable. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors have not been evaluated for the pivotal study 311 and hence it 
is not known if for example higher age relates to a higher incidence of certain types of TEAEs. 
An analysis of adverse events of special interest for ESL and antiepileptic drugs in general yielded results in 
accordance with the overall picture of TEAEs i.e. an advantage of ESL over CBZ-CR in hepatic disorder TEAEs 
(as per SMQ) and a slight disadvantage of ESL over CBZ-CR in hyponatraemia (as per SMQ). In the 
supportive conversion-to-monotherapy study pool, analyses of TEAEs of special interest revealed ESL to be 
favourable over CBZ-CR for psychiatric events, cardiac-related events and dyslipidaemia, whereas 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 57/71 
 
  
  
  
headache, haemorrhages, hyponatraemia, and movement disorders were slightly more pronounced with 
ESL compared to CBZ-CR. Furthermore, while the incidence of allergic reactions seemed to be balanced 
between ESL dose groups, in study 046, 7 subjects experienced at least one rash-related TEAE with a 
majority (all but one) in subjects receiving 1600 mg ESL. Two of these events were serious in nature 
(including one event of DRESS) and considered probably related to ESL.  
Based on the review of the monotherapy study data, the safety of ESL was largely consistent with the known 
safety profile in the adjuvant treatment setting. The most common adverse reactions with ESL as add-on 
treatment for POS are dose-related and belong to the SOCs nervous system disorders and gastrointestinal 
disorders including dizziness, somnolence, headache and nausea. The most common TEAEs reported for ESL 
in POS monotherapy were in line with those already identified for the adjunctive setting.  
As data from the double-blind part of study 311 could not be fully integrated with the data from the add-on 
epilepsy studies given that the comparator was not placebo, but active substance, the MAH performed a 
direct comparison of both safety data sets. For the purpose of providing up-to-date information in section 
4.8 of the SmPC, ADRs that occurred at a similar incidence in monotherapy and adjunctive treatment studies 
(vision blurred, hypotension, diarrhoea, dyspepsia, skin disorder, fatigue, asthenia and blood chloride 
decreased) were kept unchanged. In addition, the MAH proposed to keep frequency categories as already 
delineated based on adjunctive treatment for ADRs, which occurred with lower frequency in the 
monotherapy studies (including dizziness, decreased appetite, gait disturbance). No ADRs from the SOCs 
immune system disorder, cardiac disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, hepatobiliary 
disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, renal and urinary disorders had been reported 
more than once in monotherapy studies and hence, ADRs listed in these categories remained unchanged 
based on adjunctive treatment experience. For the ADRs anaemia, hypothyroidism, memory impairment, 
and blood sodium decreased, which occurred at a higher incidence in the monotherapy studies compared to 
adjunctive treatment studies, the frequency category remained the same (‘uncommon’) when being 
calculated in the overall safety database.  
Unexpected adverse events in the monotherapy study program included 2 cases of overweight in subjects on 
ESL compared to no subject on CBZ-CR. Both cases were non-serious and mild and causality was considered 
either unlikely or possibly related. In both subjects the event first started after at least 6 months of 
continuous treatment with ESL and the event resolved or did not worsen even with continuation of ESL 
treatment. Similarly, contusion was found to occur in 2 ESL treated subjects in monotherapy studies and in 
no subject on CBZ-CR. Both events resolved without dose adjustment and were non-serious. Furthermore, 
there were 2 reports of suicidal ideation in patients receiving ESL and 1 report in a patient on CBZ-CR. The 
subjects on ESL experienced the event in the context of depression or depressive episodes. No further event 
has been reported in the integrated safety database that comprise all completed clinical trials in epilepsy 
(adjunctive therapy and monotherapy ESL clinical trials), in a total 2434 exposed patients. In addition, the 
MAH provided a C-SSRS assessment showing that the incidences of suicide-related events were low and 
similar between treatment groups. Overall, the CHMP considered that the safety information in the SmPC 
including a warning in section 4.4 in relation to suicidality were still adequate and no update was needed in 
relation to the aforementioned adverse events.  
The CHMP furthermore noted 3 cases of anxiety reported with ESL in study 311 (0.7%) with a total of 
10 cases in the overall safety database of ESL. Although the 3 new cases were non-serious and self-limited, 
given that ESL is known to cause adverse reaction within the SOC Psychiatric disorders that refer to the 
MedDRA high level term anxiety disorders, such as nervousness and agitation, which are already captured in 
the ESL SmPC, the CHMP was of the view that anxiety should be added to SmPC section 4.8 as uncommon 
adverse reaction. 
During the safety assessment, emphasis was placed on the new proposed maximum daily dose of 1600 mg 
ESL. The MAH’s rationale for evaluating 1600 mg ESL QD in the monotherapy setting was mainly based on 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 58/71 
 
  
  
  
safety results of this ESL dose in other indications and assumptions that tolerability of ESL may be better 
when given as monotherapy compared to adjunctive treatment.  
Notably, since the study design of the pivotal study 311 allowed up-titration according to seizure severity, 
subjects were not evenly distributed between dose groups. Only 15% of subjects (60 out of 401 patients in 
the ESL group) received 1600 mg/day in dose group C, whereas all other subjects only received ESL doses 
up to 1200 mg/day (dose group A or B), for which safety had already been established in the add-on setting. 
Overall, 25 of 60 subjects (41.7%) have been treated with ESL 1600 mg/day for 6 months and 16 of 
60 subjects (26.7%) received ESL for at least 12 months. This low number of patients hampers the safety 
assessment of the new proposed maximum dose and of a possible dose relationship of TEAEs. In addition, 
treatment duration in the higher dose groups B and C was shorter for ESL compared to CBZ-CR, mainly due 
to a higher rate of discontinuations due to lack of efficacy and withdrawal of consent.  
When comparing TEAEs reported for the different dose groups A, B, and C in study 311, there was a trend 
towards dose-related increases in the incidences of some of the AEs including abdominal pain, abdominal 
pain upper, asthenia, fatigue, malaise, fall, aspartate aminotransferase increased, blood creatine 
phosphokinase increased, memory impairment, tremor, depressed mood, and mood altered. Differences 
between treatment groups at dose level C were also observed with regards to serious TEAEs which have 
been reported in 15% of subjects from the 1600 mg ESL dose and for 2.9% of subjects on the equivalent 
CBZ-CR dose level. However, the MAH explained that only 2 of the serious TEAEs were considered to be 
possibly related to study drug. These two events were both observed in a single subject and clearly 
correlated with ESL. Amongst the remaining 7 SAEs, 3 could probably have been related to ESL, i.e. SAE of 
Adams-strokes syndrome and additionally SAE Atrioventricular block complete in a single subject, and a 
suicide attempt in another subject. Taken together, there was insufficient evidence from these cases to 
support a different safety profile for the highest dose group. 
Interestingly, a discrepancy in terms of dose-relationship was found in study 311 whereby TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation were lowest in the highest dose group C for both treatments, which is surprising especially 
against the background of a dose-related increase in discontinuations previously observed for Zebinix as 
adjunctive treatment. This finding could not be explained and it could not be excluded that it was a chance 
finding given the low number of patients in the highest dose groups 
TEAEs in the supportive conversion-to-monotherapy study pool were reported with a higher incidence in the 
1600 mg dose group compared to the 1200 mg dose group (81.4% vs. 73.2%). Furthermore, 
discontinuation due to TEAEs was almost twice as high in the 1600 mg dose group compared to the 1200 mg 
dose group (15.3% vs. 8.1%) and hyponatraemia was reported to be serious in 1.2% of subjects on 
1600 mg in the supportive conversion-to-monotherapy study pool compared to no such event in the 
1200 mg dose group. However, both studies were considered supportive only due to the open-label design 
while lacking an active comparator or placebo. Furthermore, due to the short study duration (18 week 
treatment period) data from the supportive conversion-to-monotherapy study pool did not contribute to the 
long-term experience with ESL 1600 mg/day. Data from the long-term open label extension of studies 045 
and 046 (study 050) were thus provided by the MAH to address the concerns of the CHMP. In this extension, 
patients received ESL doses up to 2400 mg/day. The flexible dosing in this study allowed for stating modal 
daily doses only. The most common modal daily dose including the 1600 mg dose was administered for more 
than one year in 190 subjects and for more than 2 years in 113 subjects. No consistent increase was 
observed in the overall incidence of TEAEs across modal daily dose groups (91.2%, 78.1%, and 84.4% of the 
1000 to < 1400 mg, 1400 to < 2000 mg, and ≥ 2000 mg dose categories, respectively). Furthermore, 
comparison of the highest modal daily dose groups 1400 mg to <2000 mg and ≥2000 mg ESL showed that 
few TEAEs increased across these two doses (e.g. vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, fall, contusion, 
hyponatraemia), whereas no or an inverse relationship with dose was seen for other events. Overall, the 
CHMP was of the view that no firm conclusion could be drawn from these data.  
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 59/71 
 
  
  
  
Taken together, the available data point towards a safety profile of ESL 1600 mg/day, which is not 
significantly worse than the one of lower daily doses. From a safety point of view, there was hence no 
objection against the 1600 mg/day ESL dose to be administered in monotherapy of POS. However, the 
monotherapy study program encompassed only a limited number of elderly patients (aged ≥65 years). A 
total of 26 (6.5%) elderly patients have been exposed to ESL and 35 (8.5%) received CBZ-CR in study 311. 
A single subject was treated with the highest ESL dose of 1600 mg. Four additional subjects have been 
included in supportive study 045 to receive ESL 1600 mg/day. These limited data were considered by the 
CHMP to be insufficient in order to characterise the safety of ESL in the elderly population, and given that 
older patient may be more susceptible to AED induced (CNS) side effects, the CHMP was of the view that the 
1600 mg dose could not be recommended for this population. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the available data indicate a similar safety profile of ESL in POS monotherapy compared to the 
already approved add-on indication in adult epilepsy patients with POS. Some uncertainties remained with 
regards to the new proposed maximum daily dose of 1600 mg ESL. The number of patients exposed to ESL 
doses of 1600 mg/day in the pivotal trial was limited which hampered the assessment of possible 
dose-related effects. However, taking into account the totality of the available data, there was no clear 
evidence of a worse safety profile of this dose compared to lower ESL doses (800 and 1200 mg). Therefore, 
the CHMP concluded that use of ESL doses up to 1600 mg per day in POS monotherapy was acceptable, 
except for elderly patients due to lack of experience in this patient group. When comparing ESL to CBZ-CR, 
a favourable profile was observed for ESL with regards to TEAEs possibly related to study medication, TEAEs 
leading to study discontinuation and liver enzyme (GGT) increases, whereas the risk of hyponatraemia was 
more pronounced with ESL than with CBZ-CR.  
In conclusion, the CHMP was of the view that the available data were suitable to support the extension of 
indication of Zebinix to monotherapy of adult epilepsy patients with POS with or without secondary 
generalisation at ESL doses up to 1600 mg/day.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Changes to SmPC sections 4.1 and 4.2 (additions are 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 63/71 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
shown in bold, deletions as strike-through) are summarised below: 
SmPC section 4.1 
Zebinix is indicated as: 
•  monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary 
generalisation, in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy; 
• 
adjunctive therapy in adults, adolescents and children aged above 6 years, with partial-onset 
seizures with or without secondary generalisation.  
SmPC section 4.2 
Posology 
Adults 
Zebinix may be taken as monotherapy or added to existing anticonvulsant therapy. The 
recommended starting dose is 400 mg once daily which should be increased to 800 mg once daily after one 
or two weeks. Based on individual response, the dose may be increased to 1,200 mg once daily (see section 
5.1). Some patients on monotherapy regimen may benefit from a dose of 1,600 mg once daily 
(see section 5.1). 
Special populations 
Elderly (over 65 years of age) 
No dose adjustment is needed in the elderly population provided that the renal function is not disturbed. 
Due to very limited data on the 1,600 mg monotherapy regimen in the elderly, this dose is not 
recommended for this population. 
Changes were also made to the product information to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, 
which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable as this variation did not lead to significant 
changes affecting the readability of the product information. Thus, the CHMP agreed that there was no need 
to perform a new readability test. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
ESL has been authorised in the EU/EEA via the Centralised Procedure by Commission Decision in April 2009 
for adjunctive therapy in adults with POS with or without secondary generalisation. In 2016, the indication 
was extended to children older than 6 years and a paediatric formulation (50mg/ml oral suspension) was 
introduced. With the present application, the MAH sought the extension of the indication to POS 
monotherapy in adult epilepsy patients. 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 64/71 
 
  
  
  
 
Epileptic focal seizures/POS are characterised by abnormal, excessive or hypersynchronous neuronal 
activity originating in a discrete area of the cerebral cortex, which may later spread to involve both cerebral 
hemispheres causing secondary generalisation. First line treatment of patients with newly diagnosed POS 
consists of monotherapy with an AED and approximately 60% of epilepsy patients manage to attain 
long-term seizure freedom on a single AED (Stephen, 2012), which is the ultimate treatment objective. The 
remaining patients require adjunctive therapy with 2 or more AEDs, which is usually applied after two failed 
monotherapies.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Several AED treatment options exist for POS monotherapy: CBZ, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, zonisamide, 
phenytoin, levetiracetam, topiramate, valproate, gabapentin and lacosamide. Monotherapy of epilepsy has 
certain advantages for patients when compared with adjunctive therapy including improved patient 
compliance as well as a decreased risk for drug interactions and better tolerability. Despite the availability of 
a number of treatment options for POS monotherapy, as some patients experience tolerability issues or 
insufficient efficacy on the first AED attempt, extending the range of treatment options would be valuable as 
it could help optimise individual therapy. Thus, there remains a therapeutic need for additional monotherapy 
options. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
To support the present application, the MAH has conducted one pivotal efficacy and safety study 311. The 
study was a non-inferiority trial against the active comparator CBZ-CR in adult patients with newly 
diagnosed epilepsy experiencing POS, using stepwise fixed dose increments based on individual treatment 
response at 3 different dose levels, i.e. dose level A (ESL 800 mg QD, CBZ-CR 200 mg BID), level B (ESL 
1200 mg QD or CBZ-CR 400 mg BID) and level C (ESL 1600 mg QD or CBZ-CR 600 mg BID). The primary 
efficacy variable was the proportion of subjects in the PP set who were classified as seizure free for the entire 
26-week evaluation period at the last evaluated dose level. Subjects who dropped out during this 26-week 
period were considered as non-seizure-free in the primary analysis. The chosen design and endpoints of the 
pivotal trial were generally in line with the recommendations of the CHMP guideline on clinical investigation 
of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic disorders (CHMP/EWP/566/98Rev.2/Corr), and with 
CHMP scientific advice. 
Supportive data were presented from two conversion-to-monotherapy studies (045 and 046) as well as their 
long-term open label extension (study 050). 
3.2.  Favourable Effects 
The proportions of seizure free subjects at the last evaluated dose level during the 26 week evaluation period 
of study 311 were 71.1% (276/388) in the ESL and 75.6% (300/397) in the CBZ-CR group (PP set; 
ARD: -4.28, 95% CI: -10.3; 1.74). The lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than the pre-specified NI 
margin of -12%. Additional analyses of the primary efficacy variable with alternative assumptions on seizure 
risk in drop-outs suggest that the conclusion of NI would not critically depend on the seizure rate in the 
drop-outs. 
Consistent results were shown after 1 year of treatment, with seizure free rates of 64.7% (251/388) in the 
ESL group and 70.3% (279/397) in CBZ-CR subjects (PP set; ARD: -5.46, 95% CI: -11.88; 0.97). An 
additional analysis of seizure-freedom during the maintenance period for subjects on a stable dose for at 
least 1 year in which subjects with insufficient treatment time were considered non-seizure free revealed a 
similar ARD of ESL compared to CBZ-CR of -5.09 with a lower limit of the 95% CI of -11.76.  
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 65/71 
 
  
  
  
Notably, throughout the efficacy analyses of seizure freedom, the lower bound of the 95% CI was 
consistently close to the -12% NI margin. The NI margin had been tightened following CHMP scientific advice 
and was set at -12% in line with ILAE guidance and assuming a 60% seizure freedom rate in the CBZ-CR arm 
as well as that a relative difference to CBZ-CR of 20% or less was acceptable (ILAE, 1998; Glauser et al., 
2006; Glauser et al., 2013). In fact, as the actual seizure freedom rate in the CBZ-CR group was 75.6%, the 
-12% absolute difference for the NI margin corresponds to a relative difference of less than 20%.  
The new proposed maximum dose of ESL 1600 mg QD exceeds the hitherto evaluated and approved 
maximum dose of ESL as adjunctive therapy. Unfortunately, the design of study 311 (up-titration to higher 
dose-levels depending on treatment response) did not allow conclusive assessment of dose response 
relationship and the fact that only 15% of ESL subjects were treated with 1600 mg ESL during study 311 
made the interpretation of the data in this dose group difficult. However, the finding of a retention rate of 
43.4% ESL subjects at the maximum dose level C (compared to 50% CBZ-subjects) during the evaluation 
period and 69.6% ESL patients (compared to 81.3% CBZ-subjects) when including the maintenance period, 
suggested that several of the subjects who were not seizure free at 1200 mg ESL per day did in fact profit 
from a further increase in ESL dose to 1600 mg/day. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Whereas non-inferiority of ESL compared to CBZ-CR with the pre-specified margin of -12% has been 
robustly demonstrated in study 311, the efficacy analyses consistently showed a numerically smaller effect 
of ESL compared to CBZ. In the analysis of treatment failure (seizure risk) based on time to event analysis 
(Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression), even statistically significant superiority of CBZ-CR versus ESL 
was observed (p=0.0002), with Kaplan-Meier estimates of seizure risk of 6% (CBZ) and 12% (ESL) at the 
end of the 6-month Evaluation Period and 11% (CBZ) and 19% (ESL) after 1 year. However, in the context 
of a population at risk of seizures (median baseline seizure frequency of 4 and 2 during 1 year and 3 months, 
respectively, before study enrolment), the resulting Kaplan Meier seizures freedom estimates of more than 
80% during 1 year of treatment clearly indicate efficacy of ESL. 
Seizures during the evaluation period tended to be more severe in the ESL compared to the CBZ-CR group: 
32% (ESL) and 19 % (CBZ-CR) seizures were secondary generalised, 43% (ESL) and 26% (CBZ-CR) were 
complex partial and 23% (ESL) and 40% (CBZ-CR) were simple partial seizures. However, subgroup 
analyses by seizure type at baseline revealed similar rates of seizure-freedom in subjects with secondary 
generalised seizures as worst seizure type at baseline (ESL: 74.3% and CBZ-CR: 77%, respectively) as well 
as in subjects with secondary generalised seizures as most frequent seizure type at baseline (ESL: 75.5%; 
CBZ: 74.9%), which was reassuring.  
In the subgroup of patients with > 4 seizures (during 3 months as well as 1 year) prior to enrolment a > 10% 
difference in seizure-free subjects was found in favour of CBZ-CR compared to ESL. Similarly, in the 
subgroup previously treated with an AED (for a maximum of 2 weeks), the difference in seizure-free subjects 
was >20% again favouring CBZ-CR. However, less than 30% study subjects had > 4 seizures within 
3 months prior to enrolment only approximately 15% subjects had an AED prior to the study, the latter 
being considered only vaguely indicative of epilepsy severity. The respective results should thus be 
interpreted with caution and no clear indication of lower efficacy of ESL in subjects with more severe epilepsy 
could be concluded. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety data from study 311 and the supportive conversion-to-monotherapy studies, including an 
interim analysis of extension study 050, indicate a safety profile of ESL in POS monotherapy consistent with 
the approved use as add-on therapy. Safety issues identified with ESL when used as adjunctive treatment of 
POS mainly comprises adverse reactions from the MedDRA SOCs nervous system disorders and 
EMA/304195/2017 
Page 66/71 
 
  
  
  
gastrointestinal disorders. The most common TEAEs are dizziness, somnolence, headache and nausea and a 
dose related increase in TEAEs has been observed. Important identified risks of ESL pertain to cutaneous 
adverse reactions and hyponatraemia.  
In the pivotal monotherapy study 311, the most commonly reported TEAEs for ESL were headache (22.9%) 
and dizziness (13.7%). Somnolence occurred in 6.7% of ESL patients and with regards to gastrointestinal 
disorders, 7.7% of patients receiving ESL reported nausea. Cutaneous ADRs occurred in 6.2% of patients in 
the ESL group. Less TEAEs at least possibly related to study medication and TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
(41.1% versus 49.5% and 13.5% versus 18%) were reported for ESL compared to CBZ-CR. Furthermore, 
the incidence of liver enzyme increases, namely GGT increased, was more than 10 times higher with CBZ-CR 
than with ESL (14.6% versus 4%). At the same time, slightly more cases of hyponatraemia were observed 
with ESL compared to CBZ-CR (ADRs of hyponatraemia and blood sodium decreased were reported by 3.7% 
versus 1.5% of ESL and CBZ-CR patients).  
While generally, the safety information in the SmPC was considered to be still adequate, anxiety was added 
as an uncommon adverse reaction to SmPC section 4.8 in light of 3 case reports with ESL in study 311 
(0.7%), raising the total number of reported cases to 10 in the overall safety database of Zebinix. This 
finding was not unexpected given that ESL is known to cause adverse reaction within the SOC Psychiatric 
disorders that refer to the MedDRA high level term anxiety disorders, such as nervousness and agitation, 
which are already listed in the SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In study 311, only 15% (60/401) of subjects in the ESL group reached the highest dose group C 
(1600 mg/day) proposed as the maximum dose for POS monotherapy treatment. The low number of 
exposed patients and the lack of a placebo comparator in regard to the highest dose group made it difficult 
to assess the safety at this dose level and in fact of any possible dose relationship of AEs. Treatment duration 
in dose groups B and C was found to be shorter for ESL compared to CBZ-CR patients due to a higher rate 
of discontinuations. Differences between treatment arms have been detected at dose level C for the 
reporting of serious TEAEs (15% of subjects on 1600 mg ESL dose and 2.9% of subjects on the equivalent 
CBZ-CR dose). The majority of these SAEs were however not considered related to ESL. Surprisingly, TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation were found to be lowest in the highest dose group C for both treatments, which 
was unexpected especially given that a dose-related increase in discontinuations has previously been 
observed in the clinical development program of Zebinix as adjunctive POS treatment. A chance finding 
could not be excluded.  
Data from studies 045 and 046 were only considered supportive in light of the limitations inherent to the 
study design and short duration of treatment. The safety data were broadly in line with pivotal study 311. A 
discontinuation rate twice as high in the 1600 mg/day dose group compared to 1200 mg/day and slightly 
higher incidences of TEAEs at the highest dose were observed, but there was no clear dose relationship for 
most of the TEAEs. An interim analysis of the long-term open-label extension study 050 did not show a 
consistent increase in AEs across modal daily dose groups, either.  
Overall, there was no clear indication that ESL daily doses of 1600 mg in POS monotherapy would be 
associated with a worse safety profile compared to lower doses.  
Evaluation of intrinsic and extrinsic factors has not been conducted in study 311. For this reason, it was 
difficult to judge if age leads to a higher incidence of certain TEAEs. Only 6.5% patients on ESL and 8.5% on 
CBZ-CR were >65 years of age while being evaluated in study 311. Furthermore, only one single subject 
aged >65 years has been exposed to 1600 mg/day ESL in study 311 and 4 additional subjects received 
1600 mg ESL in the supportive US studies. In light of this limited experience, use of ESL 1600 mg/day was 
not recommended in the elderly, which has been reflected in the SmPC.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy and safety of ESL has previously been demonstrated for treatment of adults with refractory POS as 
adjunctive treatment in 4 pivotal, placebo controlled studies at doses of 800 mg and 1200 mg, the respective 
add-on indication is approved since 2009 in the EU. In the pivotal trial supporting the extension of indication 
to POS monotherapy, 71.1% of the adult patients receiving ESL and 75.6% of the patients taking CBZ-CR 
completed the 6-months evaluation period and were seizure free for the entire time (PP set). The lower limit 
of the 95% CI (-10.3) was greater than the pre-specified absolute non-inferiority margin of -12%. Largely 
consistent results were shown in the sensitivity analyses, the relative risk difference as well as the analyses 
of seizure-free subjects after 1 year of treatment indicating maintenance of the effect. The proportions of 
seizure free subjects reported in study 311 were high, amounting to 88% in ESL and 94% in CBZ-CR 
subjects after 26 weeks of treatment and to 81% in ESL and 89% in CBZ-CR subjects after 1 year of 
treatment at stable dose in the Kaplan-Meier analyses. Given that this high rate of seizure freedom was 
achieved in a population at risk of recurrent seizures, whereby seizure freedom is the ultimate treatment 
goal, the results were considered clinically relevant and clearly indicative of a beneficial effect of ESL in POS 
monotherapy.  
However, the vast majority of efficacy endpoints including risk of seizure at the last evaluated dose, 
completion rates as well as distribution of subjects across dose levels, indicate a consistent trend towards 
lower efficacy of ESL compared to CBZ-CR. In particular, the analysis of treatment failure (seizure risk) 
based on time to event analysis (Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression) showed statistically significant 
superiority of CBZ-CR compared to ESL, whereby the risk of seizures was twice as high with ESL compared 
to CBZ-CR (12% versus 6%). This analysis was considered relevant by the CHMP as it is sensitive to show 
differences between treatments, and handling of missing values in this analysis was more appropriate than 
in the primary analysis. Thus, while non-inferiority at the pre-specified margin of -12% has been robustly 
demonstrated, the available evidence suggests slightly lower efficacy of ESL compared to CBZ-CR in the 
population studied.  
Nevertheless, the CHMP acknowledged that ESL provides some advantages compared to CBZ-CR, including 
a more than 10% difference in AEs of GGT increase in direct comparison to CBZ-CR, suggesting a lower risk 
of liver disorders. Furthermore ESL has a low interaction potential and faster titration compared to most 
other AEDs is possible as well as once-daily administration.

Overall, the totality of clinical safety data of ESL in the studies evaluating its use as POS monotherapy 
supported a safety profile consistent with the profile established in the approved add-on setting. The most 
common adverse reactions remain nervous system disorders and gastrointestinal disorders including 
dizziness, somnolence, headache and nausea and the important identified risks of ESL are cutaneous 
adverse reactions and hyponatraemia. Uncertainties remained in the evaluation of safety of the new 
maximum dose for monotherapy, ESL 1600 mg/day, due to the limited exposure in the pivotal trial (only 
15% of patients titrated to this dose and subjects on higher ESL doses had shorter treatment duration) and 
as the study designs of the monotherapy trials were not suitable to assess a possible dose-response 
relationship. However, the retention rates after 24 and 52 weeks in study 311 suggest that some patients 
gain additional benefit at this dose and tolerate it well. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The available study data demonstrate a benefit of ESL as monotherapy for the treatment of POS in newly 
diagnosed epilepsy adult patients with more than 80% of patients achieving seizure freedom for a duration 
of 1 year. The benefits of ESL outweighed the risk of mainly nervous system disorders and gastrointestinal 
disorder. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the benefit/risk balance of Zebinix as monotherapy in the 
treatment of POS, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults with newly diagnosed epilepsy was 
positive.

Extension of indication for the tablet formulation to include the use of Zebinix as monotherapy in the 
treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults with newly diagnosed 
epilepsy, in addition to the previously authorised indication as adjunctive therapy. As a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet was updated in 
accordance. The MAH also took the opportunity to make editorial amendments throughout the product 
information. 
Furthermore, the product information is being brought in line with the latest QRD template version. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

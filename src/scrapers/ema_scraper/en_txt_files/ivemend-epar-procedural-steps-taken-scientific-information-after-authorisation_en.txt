ondansetron, with or without dexamethasone, were 
evaluated in a Phase I clinical study (N=34) in paediatric 
cancer patients receiving moderately or highly emetogenic 
chemotherapy. However, the efficacy and safety data from 
this small study do not support a conclusion on the optimal 
dosing regimen. Further studies evaluating the use of

have been administered to a total of 2,687 individuals 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the 
QRD template version 9.1 and to make minor 
editorial changes. Furthermore, the MAH took the 
opportunity to align section 4.4 of the SmPC (and 
Package leaflet respectively) for fosaprepitant 
(Ivemend) with the changes approved through 
and PL 
including 371 healthy subjects and 2,084 patients with 
chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). The 
safety profile of aprepitant was evaluated in approximately 
6,500 individuals. 
In a randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study, IVEMEND 150 mg (N=502) in combination with 
ondansetron and dexamethasone was compared with

consisted of fosaprepitant 150 mg on Day 1 in combination 
with oral ondansetron 8 mg for 2 doses and oral 
dexamethasone 12 mg. On Days 2 and 3, patients in the 
fosaprepitant group received placebo for ondansetron every 
12 hours.  The control regimen consisted of fosaprepitant 
placebo 150 mg IV on Day 1 in combination with oral 
ondansetron 8 mg for 2 doses and oral dexamethasone 20 
mg. On Days 2 and 3, patients in the control group 
received 8 mg oral ondansetron every 12 hours. 
Fosaprepitant placebo and dexamethasone placebo (on Day 
1) were used to maintain blinding. 
The efficacy of fosaprepitant was evaluated based on the 
primary and secondary endpoints and was shown to be 
superior to the control regimen with regard to complete 
response in the delayed and overall phases.

Post-marketing safety reports received by the MAH indicate 
information from study P017L1 and to add 
information related to post-marketing experience on

fosaprepitant. Section 4 of the Package Leaflet is

a possible relationship between hypersensitivity reactions in 
patients administered fosaprepitant 115 mg. Since market 
introduction of fosaprepitant (cumulative data from market 
introduction on 26-Mar-2003 through 30-Jun-2009), 26 
reports of hypersensitivity reactions were identified in 
which onset occurred on Day 1, thereof 12 reports in which 
the event or events occurred within a few minutes of 
initiation of administration suggesting an immediate 
hypersensitivity reaction. The most commonly reported 
adverse events were flushing, erythema and dyspnoea. 
Section 4.4 of the SPC has therefore been amended to

include a specific warning of hypersensitivity reactions that 
may occur during intravenous administration of 
fosaprepitant. 
In addition, this type II variation updated sections 4.8 of 
the SPC of fosaprepitant 115 mg based on safety data from 
study P017L1. Although this study evaluated fosaprepitant 
150 mg single intravenous dose for the prevention of highly 
emetogenic chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, 
the safety findings in P017L1 were considered relevant for 
the approved 115 mg dosage strength as it represents a 
robust safety data set for fosaprepitant and adds to the 
understanding of the safety profile of this substance. 
Overall, the benefit-risk assessment for Ivemend 115 mg 
remains favourable and the proposed changes to the SPC, 
reflecting study data and post marketing experience, are 
considered approvable.

Update of SPC sections 4.8 and 5.1 based on the safety 
Package Leaflet 
and efficacy data for aprepitant from clinical study P130 
(prevention of MEC-induced nausea and vomiting in a 
patient population with a variety of tumour types who were 
treated with a range of MEC agents).  
In SPC section 4.8 the number of patients in clinical trials 
and the combined data from studies P071 and P130 was 
updated. The table presenting the adverse reactions 
observed in either highly emetogenic chemotherapy or 
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy studies in patients 
treated with the aprepitant regimen and at a greater 
incidence than with standard therapy was amended with 
the following adverse reactions with a frequency of 
"uncommon" under the respective System Organ Class: 
palpitation, somnolence and malaise, abdominal distension,

faeces hard, neutropenic colitis, rash pruritic, muscular 
weakness, chills, gait disturbance, neutrophil count 
decreased and cardiovascular disorder.  
Furthermore, SPC section 5.1 was updated with efficacy 
data from clinical study P130. 
The package leaflet has been updated accordingly. In 
addition, section 4 of the package leaflet has been revised 
in order to improve the readability following a CHMP 
comment raised with a recently finalised variation 
procedure.

Annex II 
The MAH updated its DDPS and submitted therefore this 
Pharmacovigilance System (DDPS). Annex II has 
been updated to reflect the version number and date 
of the DDPS. In addition, in Annex II the version 
number of the RMP (version 2.1) has been updated 
following finalisation of the follow-up measure 
RMP012. 
Update of DDPS (Pharmacovigilance) 
Type II variation. The CHMP considers that the 
Pharmacovigilance System as described by the MAH fulfils 
the requirements and is considered acceptable.

Update of SPC section 4.8 regarding hypersensitivity 
25/06/2009

SmPC and PL 
SPC section 4.8 has been updated based on spontaneous 
reactions as reported for aprepitant (EMEND) 
postmarketing.  
In addition, revision of SPC section 4.5 and PL 
section 2 has been proposed by the MAH as 
requested by CHMP with FUM026 of the EMEND 
renewal procedure in order to simplify the text and 
increase readability. In this context, also in SPC 
section 4.4 an existing warning regarding 
concomitant orally administered active substances 
that are metabolised through CYP3A4 has been 
reports that indicate a possible relationship between 
aprepitant and hypersensitivity reactions, including 
anaphylactic reaction, urticaria, pruritus and rash. In many 
cases there is a close temporal relationship between 
administration of aprepitant and development of adverse 
events. Although postmarketing reports for these adverse 
events have not been received for fosaprepitant since 
marketing of Ivemend, the MAH proposed to add a 
postmarketing section also to Ivemend since fosaprepitant 
is rapidly converted to aprepitant after intravenous

amended with a list of active substances with a 
narrow therapeutic range as well as the list of active 
substances that inhibit CYP3A4 activity. The Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to 
preform changes throughout the Product Information 
to align it with the QRD revisions agreed for EMEND 
during the Renewal procedure and to update the list 
of local representatives in the package leaflet.

administration. 
Furthermore, in SPC section 4.4 the existing warning 
regarding active substances concomitant orally 
administered active substances that are metabolised 
primarily through CYP3A4 has been amended. A list of 
CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic margin and 
where caution may be needed in case of a 2-3 fold increase 
in exposure over 3 days as could be expected during co-
administration of the 3 day CINV regimen, such as 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, alfentanil, 
diergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, and quinidine has been 
added. 
In addition, the statement regarding concomitant 
administration with active substances that inhibit CYP3A4 
activity has been amended in SPC sections 4.4 and 4.5 with 
"itraconazol, voriconazol, posaconazol, nefazodone"; 
"ritonavir" was replaced by "protease inhibitors". 
Moreover, in SPC section 4.5 a statement has been added 
informing that during the 3 day CINV regimen, a transient 
moderate increase followed by a mild decrease in exposure 
of immunosuppressants metabolised by CYP3A4 (e.g. 
cyclosporine, tacrolimus, everolimus and sirolimus) is 
expected. Given the short duration of the 3-day regimen 
and the time-dependent limited changes in exposure, dose 
reduction of the immunosuppressants is not recommended 
during the 3 days of co-administration with 
Ivemend/EMEND. The package leaflet has been updated 
accordingly.

Summary of risk management plan for Refixia 
(nonacog beta pegol)  
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Refixia. The RMP details important 
risks of Refixia, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Refixia’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Refixia’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Refixia should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Refixia should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the EPAR.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Refixia’s 
RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for  
Refixia is authorised for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients  with haemophilia B 
(congenital factor IX deficiency); see SmPC for the full indication. It contains nonacog beta 
pegol as the active substance and is given by intravenous injection.  
Further information about the evaluation of Refixia’s benefits can be found in Refixia’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: EPAR link.  
II.  Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Refixia together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Refixia’s risks are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals 
  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging 
  The authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly 
  The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g., with 
or without prescription) can help to minimises its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Refixia is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of Refixia are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Refixia. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B  Summary of important risks  
The following tables provide an overview of important identified risks, important potential risks 
and missing information for Refixia.  
Important identified risks  
Allergic/hypersensitivity reactions 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
This is an important class risk for all FIX products and a risk associated 
with all protein-based medicinal products. Allergic reactions have been 
observed in the clinical trials with nonacog beta pegol as the IMP and are 
described in the literature in patients treated with FIX products. The 
percentage of patients that have experienced serious 
hypersensitivity/allergic reactions in the clinical trials is in line with the 
results in observational studies of patients with haemophilia B treated 
with recombinant and plasma-derived FIX products. Taken together, the 
strength of evidence for the risk of hypersensitivity/allergic reactions in 
patients treated with nonacog beta pegol is moderate. 
There is an established correlation between the occurrence of a FIX 
inhibitor and allergic reactions, and patients with FIX inhibitors are at an 
increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent exposure to FIX. 
Furthermore, anaphylactic type reactions have been reported following 
immune tolerance induction with FIX. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Patients with a history of allergic reactions or with known hypersensitivity 
to the active substance (rFIX or PEG), to Chinese hamster proteins or to 
excipients are at higher risk.  
The risk of allergic/hypersensitivity reactions is expected to be higher with 
the initial administrations compared to subsequent administrations.

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
See Section II.C of this summary for an overview of the post-
authorisation development plan. 
This is an important class risk for all FIX products. Development of 
neutralising anti-FIX antibodies (FIX inhibitors) has been observed in the 
ongoing clinical trial with nonacog beta pegol in PUPs with haemophilia B, 
a population at high risk of inhibitor development. Inhibitor development 
associated with the treatment with recombinant and plasma-derived FIX 
products is well-known and described in the literature. The frequency of 
inhibitor development in clinical trials with nonacog beta pegol is in line 
with the results of observational studies of patients with haemophilia B 
treated with recombinant and plasma derived FIX products. Taken 
together, the strength of evidence for the risk is high. 
The risk of inhibitor development is highest in PUPs with severe 
haemophilia B. 
Several patient-related factors have been associated with the risk of 
developing inhibitors, such as FIX gene mutation, family history of 
inhibitors and ethnicity.  
Non-genetic risk factors include surgery and intensive treatment.

Important potential risks 
Thromboembolic events 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
This is a class risk for FIX products. No thromboembolic events have been 
reported in patients treated with nonacog beta pegol in clinical trials or in 
the post-marketing setting. Thrombotic events in relation to coagulation 
factor concentrates have been reported in patients with haemophilia B in 
the literature. The strength of evidence for the risk of thromboembolic 
events in patients treated with nonacog beta pegol is considered low. 
Possible general risk factors (not specific for patients with haemophilia B 
only) include thromboembolic diseases, disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, liver disease, advanced atherosclerotic disease, arrhythmias, 
hypertension, crush injury, cancer, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, 
post-surgical status, septicaemia, immobilisation, smoking, old age, new-
born infants and use of central venous access devices.

Routine risk communication: 
The potential risk of thromboembolic events is addressed in the labelling:

Routine risk minimisation activities recommending specific clinical 
measures to address the risk: 
A recommendation is included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC to monitor for 
early signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy by appropriate 
clinical observations and appropriate biological testing in patients with 
liver disease, in patients post-operatively, in new-born infants or in 
patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC.

Nephrotic syndrome following ITI 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Evidence from the literature supports the high risk of developing nephrotic 
syndrome following ITI in patients with haemophilia B. Nephrotic syndrome 
following ITI has not been reported in clinical trials with nonacog beta pegol 
because ITI is not being used. No cases concerning patients treated with 
nonacog beta pegol have been reported from post-marketing sources. The 
strength of evidence for this potential risk is low. 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Patients with haemophilia B with inhibitors receiving ITI, particularly in 
those patients who have experienced anaphylactic reactions to FIX 
concentrate. 
Nonacog beta pegol is not indicated for ITI but might be used for ITI 
although this is not an indication in the labelling, as common clinical 
practice is to use the factor product that was used at the time of inhibitor 
development for the ITI regimen. No marketed FIX products have an 
indication for ITI. 
Routine risk minimisation measures

The potential risk of nephrotic syndrome following ITI is addressed in the

Inadequate treatment due to assay overestimation of FIX activity 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
This risk is based on theoretical concerns related to nonacog beta pegol 
assay validation. The strength of evidence for the risk is low since no cases 
have been reported in the post-marketing setting.  
Patients treated at centres where only one-stage clotting assay is available 
for monitoring of factor IX activity. 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Patients in whom monitoring of factor IX activity is important for decision 
to treat or not and for selection of dose. This is particularly relevant in 
situations where the physician decides to monitor the patients’ factor IX 
levels (e.g., if experiencing a severe bleed, if treated in connection with 
major surgery or multi-trauma or in situations of inhibitor 
development/suspicion of inhibitor development). 
Routine risk minimisation measures

Section 4.2 of the SmPC includes information about the risk of FIX 
activity overestimation by use of a specific assay.

development plan. 
Effects on organ function due to PEG residues in tissues/organs (e.g., brain, kidney) after long-term 
treatment  
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
The risk is based on nonclinical safety studies showing the presence of PEG 
in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus of the brain. The strength of 
evidence for the risk in humans is very low as neither accumulation of PEG 
in any organ or tissue in humans nor clinical consequences have been 
established. 
Children are theoretically considered more vulnerable to a potential impact 
of PEG due to neurodevelopment milestones being reached before the age 
of 12 years.  
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation

Currently, there is no evidence for any deleterious consequences of the 
potential presence of PEG in the choroid plexus or any other tissues in 
patients after long-term treatment with nonacog beta pegol.

II.C  Post-authorisation development plan  
II.C.1  Studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation  
The following study is a condition of the marketing authorisation: 
NN7999-4031 PASS  
Purpose of the study: Novo Nordisk has received an obligation from the CHMP to conduct a 
PASS to investigate the potential effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain 
and other tissues/organs.  
The primary objective of the study NN7999-4031 is to investigate safety of nonacog beta pegol 
in prophylaxis and during long-term routine use in patients with haemophilia B in the manner 
it is prescribed by physicians. This will include assessment of specific pharmacological risks for 
FIX replacement products (FIX inhibitors, allergic reactions and thromboembolic events). 
Secondary objectives are to further evaluate the general safety and clinical effectiveness of 
nonacog beta pegol in prophylaxis and during long-term routine use in patients with 
haemophilia B in the manner it is prescribed by the physicians. 
II.C.2  Other studies in post-authorisation development plan  
NN7999-4413 PASS  
Purpose of the study: In alignment with the EMA initiative for patient registries, Novo Nordisk 
has established collaboration with two registries to obtain adverse event data for nonacog beta 
pegol to complement routine post-marketing pharmacovigilance activities and the data 
collection in PASS NN7999-4031. 
The primary objective of this study is to investigate potential clinical effects of longer-term 
exposure to nonacog beta pegol in patients with haemophilia B and to assess specific 
pharmacological risks for FIX replacement products, including nonacog beta pegol (FIX 
inhibitors, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions and thrombotic events). 
Clinical trial NN7999-3774  
Purpose of the study: The main purpose for performing this trial is to investigate safety, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties of N9-GP in the treatment of haemophilia B patients 
≤12 years. Based on clinical and nonclinical studies conducted, nonacog beta pegol is a 
promising drug candidate for prevention/prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding 
episodes in haemophilia B patients. 
The primary objective is to evaluate immunogenicity of nonacog beta pegol in PTP ≤12 years 
of age. The secondary objectives are to investigate safety of nonacog beta pegol other than 
immunogenicity, efficacy in long-term prophylaxis treatment including pharmacokinetic 
properties of nonacog beta pegol, to monitor the FIX consumption for prophylaxis and 
breakthrough bleeding episodes and to evaluate patient reported outcomes and assess health 
economic impact of treatment with nonacog beta pegol. 
 
Clinical trial NN7999-3895  
Purpose of the study: The main purpose is to investigate safety and efficacy of nonacog beta 
pegol in the treatment of PUPs with haemophilia B, hereby supporting the marketing 
authorisation of nonacog beta pegol and line extension in the PUP population. 
The EMA requires separate investigation of PUPs as part of the development programme 
initiated before market authorisation (MA) can be obtained. A final guideline on the clinical 
investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived factor IX products from the CHMP 
describes the mandatory components for trials in PUP. In some countries outside the EU, PUP 
paediatric investigation is necessary to achieve labelled indication for all children. 
Primary objective: To evaluate immunogenicity of nonacog beta pegol. 
Secondary objectives: To investigate the following in patients <6 years of age previously 
untreated with a FIX product and with moderate to severe haemophilia B during the trial 
period: 
  Safety of nonacog beta pegol  
  Efficacy of nonacog beta pegol in long-term prophylaxis treatment  
  Efficacy of nonacog beta pegol in the treatment of bleeding episodes through the 
surrogate marker, FIX activity  
  Efficacy of nonacog beta pegol through monitoring of number of doses and 
consumption of nonacog beta pegol.

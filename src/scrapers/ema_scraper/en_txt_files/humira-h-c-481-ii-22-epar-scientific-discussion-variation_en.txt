Introduction 
Adalimumab  is  a  recombinant  human  immunoglobulin  (IgG1)  monoclonal  antibody  containing  human 
peptide  sequences  that  binds  to  human  Tumor  Necrosis  Factor  (TNF)  and  neutralises  the  biological 
function of TNF by blocking its interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. 
When  this  application  was  submitted,  Humira  (adalimumab)  was    approved  for  the  treatment  of  adult 
patients  with  moderately  to  severely  active  RA  who  have  had  an  inadequate  response  to  other  disease 
modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the joints and skin, and is characterised by 
the association of arthritis and psoriasis. The goal of PsA treatment is to improve the joint manifestations 
of the disease, inhibit the structural damage to joints, improve the disability associated with the disease, 
improve the skin lesions, and improve the quality of life. Therapy for PsA is directed at controlling the 
inflammatory process. Studies with other medicinal products have demonstrated the potential benefit of 
treatment with anti-TNF inhibitors for psoriatic arthritis subjects. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) submitted a clinical development program to demonstrate 
the  safety  and  efficacy  of  adalimumab  alone  or  in  combination  with  disease  modifying  anti-rheumatic 
medicinal products in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. It consisted of two placebo-controlled Phase 3 
clinical  studies  (M02-518  and  M02-570)  and  an  interim  report  of  the  open-label  long-term  extension 
study (M02-537).  
The  MAH  proposed  to  amend  the  text  of  the  SPC,  sections  4.2,  4.8  and  5.1  with  the  results  from  the 
M02-518, M02-570 and M02-537 studies, and to update the Package Leaflet accordingly.

Clinical aspects 
To support the introduction of the new indication “psoriatic arthritis”, the MAH submitted 3 studies, 2 
pivotal studies (M02-518, M02-570) and the interim report of one open label long-term extension study 
(M02-537). 
2.1 Clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  (pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics)  and  immunogenicity  of  adalimumab 
have been characterised in healthy subjects as well as in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The data has 
been  provided  in  previous  submissions  for  RA,  therefore,  separate  clinical  pharmacology  studies  in 
patients with PsA were not conducted.  
An adalimumab dose of 40 mg every other week (eow) was selected for use in all PsA studies based on 
studies  in  RA  where  1380  subjects  received  adalimumab  in  four  placebo-controlled  RA  studies. 
Consequently, 40 mg eow was the proposed dose for the treatment of PsA subjects. 
The  CHMP  requested  further  information  on  the  dose  and  posology  schedule  chosen  by  the  MAH, 
considering that it had been extrapolated from studies on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and not specifically 
determined  in  PsA.  The  MAH  provided  a  justification  based  on  the  same  pattern  of  treatments,  same 
mechanism  of  action  and  similar  efficacy  evaluations  between  RA  and  PsA.  The  CHMP  noted  that 
ideally, dose finding studies would have been desirable. However, the current experience from trials with 
Humira,  mainly  in  RA,  including  the  early  RA  data  having  been  under  assessment  at  the  same  time, 
gives sufficient support that the doses tested in PsA are adequate.

2.2 Clinical efficacy 
Study M02-518 
Study  M02-518  was  a  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study,  stratified  by 
methotrexate  (MTX)  use  and  extent  of  psoriasis,  designed  to  compare  the  effects  of  adalimumab  at  a 
dose of 40 mg administered subcutaneously (sc) eow vs. placebo for a 24- week treatment period. This 
study  evaluated  the  effectiveness  and  safety  of  adalimumab  either  alone  or  in  combination  with 
concomitant  MTX  in  subjects  with  moderately  to  severely  active  PsA  who  have  had  an  inadequate 
response or intolerance to NSAID therapy.  
Study M02-570 
Study M02-570 was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified by DMARD 
use, designed to compare the effects of adalimumab at a dose of 40 mg administered subcutaneously (sc) 
eow  vs.  placebo  for  a  12-  week  treatment  period.  This  study  evaluated  the  effectiveness  and  safety  of 
adalimumab  either  alone  or  in  combination  with  any  concomitant  DMARD  (except  cyclosporine  or 
tacrolimus)  in  subjects  with  moderately  to  severely  active  PsA  who  had  an  inadequate  response  to 
DMARD therapy. 
Study M02-537 
Study  M02-537  was  a  multicentre,  uncontrolled,  open-label,  continuation  study  in  subjects  completing 
Study M02-518 or Study M02-570, with or without concomitant DMARDs. This study was submitted in 
order  to  provide  evidence  of  the  long-term  effectiveness  of  adalimumab  in  the  treatment  of  PsA  in 
subjects  who  completed  either  pivotal  study.  This  study  was  ongoing  at  the  time  of  the  present 
submission and the results of an interim analysis with a data cut-off of the week 24 visit in the open label 
extension study or a date of 17 May 2004 were presented. 
Methods 
Study Population 
Adults  of  18  years  of  age  or  older  with  a  diagnosis  of  PsA  that  was  moderate  to  severely  active  (as 
defined by ≥3 swollen joints and ≥3 tender or painful joints), that had active cutaneous lesions of chronic 
plaque psoriasis or a documented history of chronic plaque psoriasis. The primary difference between the 
inclusion criteria for the two studies was that in M02-518 subjects were required to have an inadequate 
response to NSAID therapy, and in M02-570 subjects were required to have an inadequate response to 
DMARD  therapy.  With  respect  to  concomitant  therapy  during  the  studies,  M02-518  subjects  were 
allowed  to  be  on  stable  doses  of  MTX  (but  other  DMARDs  were  excluded)  while  M02-570  subjects 
were allowed to be on stable doses of any DMARD.  
The CHMP requested supplementary information on the treated subpopulation that was on concomitant 
MTX, which the MAH provided. The CHMP considered that the heterogeneity of the population would 
not bias in favour of demonstrating response to adalimumab vs. placebo, which was shown in all subsets. 
Additionally, PsA is a  very heterogeneous disease, and it is not considered feasible to conduct clinical 
trials  in  a  sufficient  number  of  patients  in  all  subpopulations  and  with  possible  concomitant  treatment 
strategies.  The  CHMP  noted  that  the  indication  is  restricted  to  patients  failing  on  previous  DMARD, 
which should give sufficient recommendation as to when to start adalimumab.

Treatments 
In the controlled studies, adalimumab was evaluated by assessing five aspects of PsA using the endpoints 
arthritic manifestations, structural damage, disability, skin manifestations and quality of life.  
Duration of treatment with adalimumab in all PsA studies up to the chosen cut-off date was as presented 
in the table 1.

Outcomes/Endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  ACR20  response  at  Week 12  in  M02-518  and  M02-570.  Study 
M02-518  also  included  the  inhibition  of  disease  progression  as  assessed  by  change  from  baseline  in 
modified  total  Sharp  score  on  X-rays  of  the  hands  and  feet  at  Week  24  as  an  additional  co-primary 
efficacy variable.  
A  number  of  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  included,  relating  to  Psoriatic  Arthritis  Response 
Criteria (PsARC), ACR, PASI, and quality of life assessments. The overall design and efficacy variables 
of the two pivotal studies were similar.

Efficacy results 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  following  analyses  were  relevant  for  the  efficacy  assessment  of  this 
application.  
(1) Arthritic manifestations 
The ACR20 response at week 12 was 58% for adalimumab vs. 14% for placebo (p<0.001) in Study M02-
518  and  39%  for  adalimumab  vs.  16%  for  placebo  in  Study  M02-570.  In  study  M02-518  the  PsARC 
response was 62% for adalimumab vs. 26% for placebo at Week 12 (p<0.001) and 60% for adalimumab 
vs. 23% for placebo at Week 24 (p<0.001).  
(2) Disability 
The reduction in the secondary endpoint of the Disability Index of the HAQ in Study M02-518 was -0.4 
units for adalimumab vs. -0.1 units for placebo at Week 12 and Week 24 (p<0.001). The reduction in the 
Disability Index of the HAQ in Study M02-570 was –0.3 units for adalimumab vs. –0.1 units for placebo 
(p=0.024) at Week 12. 
(3) Quality of life 
At  Week  12,  adalimumab  was  statistically  superior  to  placebo  in  six  of  the  eight  individual  SF-36TM 
domains  in  Study  M02-518,  and  in  four  of  the  eight  domains  in  Study  M02-570.  Improvement  was 
demonstrated  also  by  the  Functional  Assessment  of  Chronic  Illness  Therapy  (FACIT)  Fatigue  Scale 
Score, and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI).

(4) Other endpoints 
Skin manifestations:  The CHMP considered that the number of patients (n= 16), with a PASI score ≥10 
(a score relevant for moderate to severe psoriasis), was insufficient to draw definite conclusions. Thus, 
efficacy on skin symptoms of psoriasis should be shown separately, and these data were not considered 
further for the efficacy assessment. 
Disease Progression:  The CHMP noted the data on disease progression. However, a period of 24 weeks 
was  considered  too  short  to  allow  an  assessment  of  this  parameter,  and  thus,  these  data  were  not 
considered further in the efficacy assessment. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy in patients with mainly moderately active psoriatic arthritis has been shown with  adalimumab 
up  to  24  weeks,  and  seems  clinically  relevant  with  respect  to  the  percentage  of  ACR  responders 
compared  with  placebo.  The  duration  of  the  studies  is  limited  and  an  open  label  continuation  study  is 
ongoing. Approximately 50% of the patients had concomitant MTX. The number of patients treated with 
other DMARDs is very low. The percentage of responders within the monotherapy/combination therapy 
groups  is  similar  at  weeks  12  and  24  and  there  is  a  tendency  towards  better  efficacy  in  patients  with 
higher  inflammatory  activity,  based  on  the  CRP  levels.  However,  a  relatively  low  level  of  CRP  was 
accepted  for  inclusion  (>1.5  mg/dl)  in  the  studies  and  the  difference  between  the  chosen  levels  of 
comparison, i.e. 2 mg/dl might be questioned. 
The CHMP noted that data on the maintenance of the effect or increase of disease activity after stopping 
treatment should have been submitted. The MAH provided supplementary documentation, however, the 
data are too limited for further conclusions.   
In  relation  to  the  ongoing  study,  a  tendency  towards  tapering  of  effect  was  observed  in  the  48-week 
evaluation,  among  the  limited  number  of  patients  (40)  available  at  this  time  point.    This  indicates  the 
need for long-term efficacy data. Moreover, the CHMP noted that antibody data was lacking. Available 
data  on  longer-term  treatment  are  currently  too  limited  to  draw  any  conclusions  on  persistence  of 
efficacy. A dose escalation to adalimumab 40  mg every week was performed only in a small group of 
patients, which does not allow any conclusions to be drawn.

Serious adverse events, malignancies and deaths  
(a) Serious adverse events 
Serious  adverse  events  were  reported  in  the  controlled  studies  in  6  adalimumab  treated  patients 
(meningitis,  diverticulitis,  convulsions  aggravated,  renal  calculus,  toe  arthrodesis  and  nasal  septum 
disorder).  In  the  placebo  group  there  were  nine  patients  with  13  serious  events  (e.g.  pericarditis, 
pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, coronary artery disease aggravated). 
An additional 12 serious events have occurred so far in the open label extension. Events judged to be at 
least  possibly  related  were  rhabdomyolysis  and  renal  failure  in  a  30-year-old  male.  Other  events  of 
interest were myocardial infarction (female 55 years old), pulmonary embolism (female 65 y), and acute 
pancreatitis (female 59 y).  
No  event  of  tuberculosis  (tb)/granulomatous  infections,  demyelinating  disease,  immunologic  reaction, 
lupus-like reaction, congestive heart failure was found. 
The overall incidence of infections was 38.1% on adalimumab and 37.9% on placebo.  
(b) Malignancies 
Prostate  cancer  was  diagnosed  in  a  male  64  years  old  on  day  83  of  treatment,  and  a  Non-Hodgkin´s 
lymphoma  in  a  79  y  old  male  on  day  4.    This  malignancy  was  diagnosed  after  a  single  dose  of 
adalimumab  and  in  retrospect  was  apparent  on  a  radiographic  study  that  predates  adalimumab 
administrations.  These treatment-emergent malignancies were judged to be probably not-related to study 
treatment.  A non-melanoma skin cancer occurred in a 38-year-old female.  
(c) Deaths 
There were no deaths reported in the three PsA studies.

Laboratory findings 
For  the  two  studies  combined,  liver  abnormal  function  tests  occurred  in  4.0%  of  adalimumab-treated 
subjects and in 0.5% of placebo-treated subjects (p = 0.018). 
Alanine aminotransferase increased  occurred in  3.0%  of  adalimumab-treated subjects  and  0%  placebo-
treated subjects (p = 0.013). This trend was also observed in Study M02-518, but not in Study M02-570.  
In the 12 adalimumab-treated subjects with ALT increases of (cid:31)3 x ULN in Study M02-518, 11 were on 
concomitant  potential  hepatotoxic  products  or  had  other  potential  causes  of  the  elevation.  Two 
adalimumab-treated subjects prematurely discontinued from the study (one due to isoniazid pancreatitis 
and  one  due  to  abnormal  laboratory  values).  Five  adalimumab-treated  subjects  had  transient  increases 
that  resolved  on  continued  therapy,  and  one  had  resolution  during  follow-up  after  discontinuation  of 
study  drug  and  isoniazid.  Of  the  six  adalimumab-treated  subjects  who  had  elevated  ALT  values  at 
completion of M02-518, four entered open-label extension Study M02-537.

Safety in special populations 
Analyses  of  overview  Adverse  events  parameters  by  various  intrinsic  factors  did  not  indicate  any 
clinically relevant differences for males vs. females, subjects <65 years vs. those ≥65 years, Caucasians 
vs. non-Caucasian, or subjects with <10 years of PsA vs. those with ≥10 years of PsA.  
Analyses  of  overview  Adverse  events  parameters  by  extrinsic  factors  did  not  indicate  any  clinically 
relevant  differences  for  subjects  with  DMARD  use  at  baseline  vs.  those  without,  subjects  with  oral 
corticosteroid use at baseline vs. those without, subjects with alcohol use at baseline vs. those without, or 
subjects with tobacco use at baseline vs. those without. 
No subject in the PsA clinical program became pregnant as of the data cut-off. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of adalimumab is similar to that previously known from anti-TNF therapy. However, 
further close monitoring of e.g. serious infections including tb and malignancies are of importance when 
new  groups  of  patients  are  introduced  to  anti-TNF  therapy.  The  MAH  described  the  programs  for 
educational efforts to prevent tb and for monitoring of malignancies. 
The  CHMP  noted  the  increased  incidence  of  liver  enzyme  elevations.  The  MAH  was  asked  to  discuss 
these data and to discuss whether monitoring of hepatic enzymes should be performed during treatment, 
in  particular  in  patients  with  PsA.  The  MAH  submitted  supplementary  information  which  does  not 
indicate any new alarming findings. Monitoring of hepatic enzymes is mandatory during treatment with 
MTX.  However,  specific  monitoring  of  hepatic  events  due  to  treatment  with  adalimumab  is  not 
considered necessary.

Overall Discussion and benefit/risk assessment 
Efficacy  of  Adalimumab  has  been  shown  in  patients  with  an  inadequate  response  to  previous 
DMARDS/NSAIDs  and  mainly  moderately  active  psoriatic  arthritis.  With  respect  to  the  percentage  of 
ACR responders compared with placebo, efficacy seems clinically relevant. There is a tendency towards 
better efficacy in patients with higher inflammatory activity, based on the CRP levels, which is in line 
with active disease. 
Approximately 50% of the patients were on concomitant MTX at randomisation. The number of patients 
treated  with  other  DMARDs  is  very  low  and  is  not  sufficient  to  ensure  safe  use  concomitantly  with 
adalimumab and should therefore not be included in the indication.  
The percentage of responders within the monotherapy/combination therapy groups, are similar at weeks 
12 and 24. A tendency towards a decrease in efficacy was found among the limited number of patients 
(n=40) followed up to one year in the open-label continuation study. Thus, a possible tapering of effect in 
the open label study strengthens the need for more long-term proof of continuing effect.  
Safety  in  patients  with  PsA  is  similar  to  the  previously  approved  indication,  with  the  exception  of 
elevated hepatic enzyme levels. However, no alarming hepatic events or safety signals were reported in 
the PsA studies.  
As  already  known,  there  is  a  risk  for  serious  infections,  including  opportunistic  infections  and  tb  and 
educational efforts are important. The MAH has proposed educational programs. Malignancies continue 
to be followed as well as other events of concern, as per normal PSUR procedures.  
In conclusion, the CHMP recommended that the indication proposed by the MAH "reducing signs and 
symptoms  of  psoriatic  arthritis"  should  be  changed  to  "Treatment  of  active  and  progressive  psoriatic 
arthritis  in  adults  when  the  response  to  previous  disease-modifying  anti-rheumatic  drug  therapy  has 
been inadequate". 
CONCLUSION 
The CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the proposed wordings to be 
introduced into the Summary of Product Characteristics and the Package Leaflet. 
The CHMP adopted on 23 June 2005 an Opinion on a Type II variation to be made to the terms of the 
Community Marketing Authorisation.

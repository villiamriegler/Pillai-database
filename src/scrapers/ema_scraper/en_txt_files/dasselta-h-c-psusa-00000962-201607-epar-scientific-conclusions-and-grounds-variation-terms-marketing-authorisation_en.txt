Scientific conclusions and grounds for the variation to 
the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
Active substance(s): desloratadine 
Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00000962/201607 
Period covered by the PSUR: 16 July 2011 to 15 July 2016 
 
 
 
Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for desloratadine, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Two literature reports identified a possible relationship between aggressive reaction/abnormal 
behaviour and desloratadine use with supportive temporal relationships, positive dechallenges and 
some with positive rechallenges. Similar cases were reported in Eudravigilance for the reference 
period. Considering the potential seriousness of these events in children, and the number of reported 
cases with positive dechallenge and rechallenge, the ‘abnormal behaviour’ and ‘aggression’ should be 
added to the list of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of desloratadine. 
A literature article published during the reference period describes 4 cases of epilepsy in children with 
a family history of epilepsy or relevant medical history. The causality was assessed as possible for 
each case, based on temporal association and positive dechallenge. Based on these new data, it 
could be concluded that desloratadine may aggravate pre-existing seizures in patients (and mainly in 
children) with medical history of seizures, and that caution should be recommended in treating 
epileptic patients or those susceptible to convulsions with desloratadine.  
Based on 4 new publications regarding a possible association between desloratadine and QT 
prolongation were reported in the literature and the fact that ‘QT prolongation’ is already listed as an 
ADR of desloratadine-containing products, this adverse reaction should be listed as an ADR of any 
desloratadine-containing product. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for desloratadine the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing desloratadine is unchanged subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

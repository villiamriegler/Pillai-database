The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for a modification of the indication for the treatment of 
paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) to extend to all PNH patients regardless of their history of 
transfusion. Consequently, the MAH proposed the update of sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC. The 
Package Leaflet was proposed to be updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH also took the 
opportunity to correct some typographical errors in the product information.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet. 
Soliris was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/03/166 on 17 October 2003. Soliris was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication: treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria.  
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan 
designation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare blood disorder with high morbidity and mortality, 
clinically defined by the deficiency of the endogenous glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored 
complement inhibitory protein CD59 on the surface of blood cells. CD59 normally blocks the formation of 
the terminal complement complex (also called the membrane attack complex) on the erythrocyte 
surface, thereby preventing haemolysis. The pathophysiology of PNH is directly linked to the 
complement-mediated destruction of the susceptible PNH red blood cells, which results in intravascular 
haemolysis, the primary clinical manifestation in all PNH patients. PNH is a clonal acquired genetic disease 
arising from a somatic mutation in the gene pig-A, located in the X-chromosome. Inactivating mutations 
appear only in a proportion of cells (PNH cells) and this proportion can vary among patients and over time 
in a single patient.  
The estimated prevalence of PNH is 13 cases per million. Patients have an approximately 15 year median 
survival from its initial diagnosis. PNH is associated with multiple serious morbidities, several of which are 
potentially life threatening. The common clinical manifestations of PNH are haemolytic anemia, venous 
thrombosis and deficient haematopoiesis. Excessive levels of cell-free plasma haemoglobin during 
intravascular haemolysis contribute to platelet activation, procoagulant activity and thromboembolism 
(TE), the leading cause of mortality in these patients (45%). Anemia is highly variable with hematocrit 
values ranging from ≤20% to normal. Red blood counts (RBC) are normochromic and normocytic unless 
iron deficiency has occurred from chronic iron loss in the urine. Granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia 
are common and reflect deficient haematopoiesis. Clinical haemoglobinuria is intermittent in most 
patients and never occurs in some, but hemosidenuria is usually present.  
Treatment for PNH depends on the severity of symptoms; patients with few or no symptoms do not 
require treatment other than folic acid and sometimes iron supplementation to increase red blood cell 
production; in the anaemic patient with signs of haemolysis, prednisone is often given in an attempt to 
slow the rate of red blood cell destruction; Patients with acute thrombosis are often treated with 
thrombolytic therapy (streptokinase, urokinase, or tissue plasminogen activator) and placed on 
long-term anticoagulation drugs and antiplatelet agents; antithymocite globulin is often used for treating 
the marrow hypoplasia.. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) which allows the replacement of 
the defective cells, has been the mainstay of curative therapy for PNH for patients with severe disease 
(i.e., patients with life threatening thrombosis or dangerously low blood counts) because of the risks of 
this procedure (15-20% chance of death), however, the majority of PNH patients are not eligible for BMT 
because they lack a suitable donor. Transfusion therapy is useful for raising the haemoglobin level and 
also for suppressing the marrow production of RBC during episodes of sustained haemoglobinuria.  
Eculizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds to the human C5 complement 
protein and inhibits C5 cleavage to C5a and C5b, preventing the generation of the terminal complement 
complex C5b-9 and thus blocking complement-mediated cell lysis and activation. The antibody is an 
IgG2/4 kappa immunoglobulin comprised of human constant regions and murine 
complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) grafted onto human framework light- and heavy-chain 
variable regions. Eculizumab is composed of two 448 amino acid heavy chains and two 214 amino acid 
light chains and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa.  
The clinical development program which investigated the use of eculizumab as a treatment for patients 
with PNH is based in one pivotal randomized, blinded, placebo controlled study (Study C04-001, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204109/2015  
Page 6/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TRIUMPH) and a non-comparative supportive study (Study C04-002, SHEPHERD) demonstrating that the 
reduction of haemolysis by a complement inhibitor would lead to substantial clinical benefit, as measured 
by the transfusion history, the stabilization of haemoglobin and improvement in fatigue. Subsequently, 
Soliris was approved in the EU on 20 June 2007 for the treatment of patients with Paroxysmal nocturnal 
haemoglobinuria (PNH). However, based on the design of the pivotal study, the indication included the 
following statement “Evidence of clinical benefit of Soliris in the treatment of patients with PNH is limited 
to patients with history of transfusions”.  
This type II variation aims to extend the indication by removing the above statement. The claim is based 
on the analysis of patients accrued in the PNH registry that was not treated with eculizumab prior to 
enrolment. 
The possible use of the data from the PNH Registry (M07-001) in patients without a history of transfusion 
was discussed with the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) via the Scientific Advice 
/protocol assistance process. The SAWP in their Advice letter dated October 2012 agreed with the MAH 
proposal to use the data from the PNH registry to form the basis of a type II variation to update the 
indication for Soliris.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH has provided a justification of absence of ERA. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody, so it is a 
protein. According to the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for 
human use dated June 2006, proteins are exempted of ERA because they are unlikely to result in 
significant risk to the environment. Therefore, there is no need to provide an environmental risk 
assessment for eculizumab in this type II variation. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
This type II variation is based on the analysis of patients accrued in the PNH registry that were not treated 
with eculizumab prior to enrolment. Additional supportive evidence from studies submitted as part of the 
initial application for marketing authorisation is presented and discussed in the light of the registry data. 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Main study 
PNH Registry 
Methods 
The PNH Registry is a prospective, observational, non-interventional study.  
Study participants 
Patients with PNH were eligible to enrol if they had been diagnosed with PNH or have a detectable 
granulocyte PNH clone. Enrolment was open to patients regardless of disease severity, past or planned 
treatments, or medical history. An enrolment assessment is completed after obtaining informed consent, 
with follow-up data collected every 6 months. 
The analysis would include all patients enrolled in the PNH Registry who meet the following criteria: 
-Entered in the PNH Registry on or before April 30, 2012 based on the May 1, 2012 database download. 
The April 30, 2012 enrolment cut-point will allow included patients, to have one or more follow-up 
assessments in the final database download of May 1, 2013. Follow-up assessments are requested every 
six months.  
- Initiated treatment with eculizumab after Registry enrolment or never treated with eculizumab. 
- Patients must have reported values for enrolment dates, date of birth, and sex. In addition, for 
eculizumab-treated patients, date of first eculizumab treatment must also be available. 
- At minimum, patients must have a follow-up assessment recorded in the study database. 
- Patients must have a granulocyte clone size of >=1% 
- In addition, patients must have a baseline LDH of >=1.5 multiples over the upper limit of normal (ULN). 
In addition to the clinical data entered from patients’ medical records at enrolment, patients are asked to 
complete patient-reported outcomes questionnaires, which include the FACIT-Fatigue and EORTC 
QLQ-C30, at enrolment and during routine office visits. These quality of life instruments have been 
validated and were previously used in the original PNH submission 
Treatments 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of the PNH Registry are to collect data: 1) to evaluate safety data specific to the 
use of eculizumab, and 2) to characterize the progression of PNH as well as clinical outcomes, and 
morbidities and mortality in eculizumab and non-eculizumab treated patients.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
Change in LDH from baseline to 6 months between eculizumab treated with no history of transfusion and 
never treated patients with no history of transfusion reported as absolute changes in LDH values from 
baseline to 6-month and LDH values at 6-month (as well as 12, 18 and 24 months). 
Key secondary endpoints: 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204109/2015  
Page 9/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary endpoints  
Change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-fatigue score from baseline; 
Changes in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) including the fatigue component.  
Fatigue was assessed using the FACIT fatigue instrument and the fatigue component of the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 questionnaire.  
Quality of life was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire as well as physician reported 
symptoms.  
Data on fatigue and quality of life were assessed as changes from baseline to last available assessment. 
FACIT-fatigue and EORTC QLQ-C30 were assessed as absolute changes (reported as mean and standard 
deviation) as well as the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement (increase of at 
least 4 points or more on the FACIT scale or an improvement (decrease for symptoms or increase for 
functioning scales) of at 10 points or more on the EORTC QLQ-C30).  
Major adverse vascular events (MAVE) were reported by patients and were also assessed as events per 
100 patient years of follow-up.  
Other efficacy parameters included changes in haemoglobin and changes in serum creatinine /eGFR over 
time. 
Sample size 
Preliminary feasibility analysis based on the February 1, 2013 PNH Registry monthly download has 
identified 42 eculizumab-treated patients and 123 never treated patients who fulfilled the inclusion 
criteria. On average, these patients have over one year’s worth of follow-up data in the Registry. The 
patient counts may increase as focused data cleaning is completed prior to the final database download in 
May 2013. 
Based on this feasibility assessment, power analyses were conducted to detect a statistically significant 
mean difference between the eculizumab-treated and never treated groups with respect to LDH along 
with FACIT-Fatigue scale. These projections assume a ratio of eculizumab-treated to never treated 
patients of 1:3 and a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
If there are 40 treated patients with LDH data included in the analysis, there would be greater than 90% 
power to detect a mean difference between the eculizumab-treated and never treated groups of 600 with 
a standard deviation of 400. There would also be greater than 90% power to detect a mean difference of 
400 with a standard deviation of 300. 
If there are 25 eculizumab-treated patients with FACIT-Fatigue data included in the analysis, there would 
be greater than 80% power to detect a mean difference between the eculizumab treated and never 
treated groups of 12.0 with a standard deviation of 8.0. There would also be greater than 80% power to 
detect a mean difference of 9.0 with a standard deviation of 6.0.

Statistical methods 
The primary analysis in this submission was based on a pre-specified subgroup of patients from the PNH 
Registry. The primary population consisted of patients who entered the PNH Registry without a history of 
transfusion and were treated with eculizumab prior to any recorded transfusion (referred as “PNH 
Registry – No Transfusion – Eculizumab”, a total of 45 patients) or were not treated with eculizumab 
(referred as “PNH Registry – No Transfusion - No Eculizumab” a total of 144 patients) throughout the 
follow-up period in the PNH Registry. Sensitivity analyses for changes in LDH, fatigue score and quality of 
life were also performed without censoring for RBC transfusion. 
The outcomes for the PNH Registry analysis were chosen to be consistent with efficacy endpoints used in 
the two pivotal trials from the original submission. Primary endpoint was change in LDH from baseline to 
6 month. Secondary outcomes were: changes in LDH at 12, 18 and 24 months, change in FACIT-fatigue 
score, change in EORTC fatigue score, patients reported outcomes, physician reported outcomes, 
changes in laboratory parameters including haemoglobin serum, creatinine, eGFR and CKD stage. All 
outcomes are reported as changes relative to baseline in accordance with the Epidemiological and 
Statistical Analysis Plan (ESAP). Given that collection of PNH Registry data was limited to every 6 months, 
assessments from the PNH Registry are limited to 6 month intervals. When multiple data points were 
available, the closest to the target date was selected. For the last available assessment, data points 
collected after the last clinical assessment date were excluded. 
The primary outcome was the mean absolute change from baseline in LDH (U/L) to 6 months of follow-up 
between eculizumab-treated patients with no recent history of a RBC transfusion and never treated 
patients with no recent history of a RBC transfusion. The mean percentage change from baseline in LDH 
will also be calculated and summarized. Mean difference and percentage change in LDH from baseline will 
also be assessed at 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months of follow-up. In addition, mean difference and 
percentage change in LDH from baseline to each patient’s last available LDH value during follow-up will be 
assessed. Longitudinal analysis of LDH will also be assessed for eculizumab-treated patients with a recent 
history of one or more transfusions. Secondary outcomes will be the mean absolute change from baseline 
to 12 months of follow-up between eculizumab-treated patients with no recent history of a RBC 
transfusion and never treated patients with no recent history of a RBC transfusion in two patient reported 
outcomes: 1) FACIT-Fatigue scale and 2) EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale. The mean percentage change 
from baseline in these two scales will also be calculated. Mean difference and percentage change in 
FACIT-Fatigue scale and EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale from baseline will also be assessed at 6, 18, and 
24 months of follow-up. In addition, mean difference and percentage change from baseline to each 
patient’s last available FACIT-Fatigue and EORTC QLQ-C30 assessment during follow-up will be assessed. 
The FACIT-Fatigue scale consists of values ranging from 0 to 52. Higher scores indicate less fatigue 
reported by patients. The EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale ranges from 0-100 with higher scores indicating 
more fatigue reported by patients. Longitudinal analysis of the FACIT-Fatigue and EORTC QLQ-C30 
fatigue scales will also be assessed for eculizumab-treated patients with a recent history of one or more 
transfusions. 
Results 
Participant flow 
As of 30 April 2012, a total of 1547 patients were enrolled in the PNH Registry of whom 882 never 
received eculizumab prior to enrolment. Of these patients, 189 had no history of transfusion and met the 
eligibility criteria of clone size and LDH. These 189 patients form the primary population included in this 
submission: 45 patients who were treated with eculizumab after enrolment in the PNH Registry and 144

Recruitment 
The analysis would include all patients enrolled in the PNH Registry who entered in the PNH Registry on or 
before 30 April 2012. The enrolment cut-point allowed included patients, to have one or more follow-up 
assessments in the final database download of 1st May 2013. Follow-up assessments are requested every 
six months.  
Conduct of the study 
The study concerns a subset of PNH registry and was conducted according to the registry protocol , no 
major amendments were noted.  
Baseline data 
Baseline Demographics and disease Characteristics 
Demographics were generally similar between the two groups of patients without a history of transfusion. 
The vast majority were middle age adults. There were 9 paediatric patients with ages ranging from 12 
years to 17 years. Nineteen patients were elderly (>65 years old): two (age 70 and 75 years) in the 
Eculizumab group, and 17 in the No Eculizumab group.  
Patients in the subset of eculizumab had lower median Hb levels (10g/dl vs 12g/dl), higher proportion of 
patients had history of thrombotic events (29% eculizumab vs 11% no-eculizumab), higher fatigue and 
dyspnoea scores, among others symptoms.  
The vast majority of patients in the eculizumab group had haemolysis and at least one symptom.  The 
majority (92%) of these patients had symptomatic chronic haemolytic anaemia at baseline defined as the 
physician having reported the presence of abdominal pain, shortness of breath, dysphagia, erectile 
dysfunction, fatigue or anaemia. Specifically, 43/45 (96%) patients in the Eculizumab group and 130/144 
(90%) patients in the No Eculizumab group had at least one of the above listed symptoms at baseline. 
Laboratory parameters and fatigue scores also indicated that the eculizumab group represented a more

Numbers analysed 
Patients without a History of Transfusion in the PNH Registry 
A total of 189 patients from the PNH Registry formed the basis of this analysis. All of them met the entry 
criteria with LDH ≥1.5 x ULN and a granulocyte clone > 1%. Forty five patients had no recent history of 
transfusion and went on to receive eculizumab after enrolment in the PNH Registry and 144 had no 
history of transfusion and never received eculizumab through the entire follow-up period.  
A substantial number of patients were excluded from this analysis (8 patients (18%) vs 45 patients 
(35%), in eculizumab group vs non-eculizumab group, respectively) given that no LDH values at 6-month 
were available. This was mainly due to the lack of LDH values at 6months. Other reasons were death or 
transfusions, but these affected a minority of patients (1 patient and 6 patients in eculizumab vs 
non-eculizumab treatment arms, respectively) and did not impact on study results substantially. The final 
analysis is based on 37 eculizumab vs 99 non-eculizumab. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Changes in LDH 
Treatment with eculizumab was followed by a clinically relevant change in LDH values from baseline to 
6-month, with most patients showing normal or near normal values. LDH values remained almost 
unchanged in the no-eculizumab treatment arm.

-78 (-92, 66) 
-3.5(-71, 200) 
In most patients treated with eculizumab, the LDH levels returned to or were close to the normal range at 
the 6-month time point. In patients with longer follow-up, the LDH levels continued normal or near 
normal. In the No Eculizumab group patients, LDH levels remain elevated with minimal changes 
compared to what was reported at baseline. 
Changes in Fatigue score 
Changes in Fatigue scores were available for 19 out of the 25 patients for whom fatigue was assessed at 
baseline in the eculizumab treated arm vs 66 in the non-eculizumab arm. Based on data available, 
treatment with eculizumab showed improvements in mean fatigue scores as assessed by two commonly 
used scales, with 14 (74%) of the eculizumab-treated patients reporting a clinically meaningful 
improvement of 4 points or more compared to 22 (33%) patients in the No Eculizumab group. Overall, 
117 patients (30 in the Eculizumab treated group and 87 in the No Eculizumab group) had at least one 
assessment after baseline. In those patients the median time from baseline to last available follow-up was 
0.9 and 1.4 years, respectively. At last available assessment the median FACIT score in eculizumab 
treated patients increased to 44, consistent with minimal evidence of fatigue and it was 41 in the No 
Eculizumab group.  
Changes in haemoglobin 
At the 6-month analysis, there was a clinically important increase in the haemoglobin level for 
eculizumab-treated patients (median increase of 9.0 g/L). In contrast, in patients who did not receive 
eculizumab, the haemoglobin levels were stable (median increase of 1.0 g/L). This correlates with the 
effect seen in LDH. As for other endpoints, the number of patients for whom data are available decreases 
dramatically over time, which is an important weakness.  
Changes in renal function 
There were limited changes in renal function from baseline to month 6 in adult patients with or without 
eculizumab treatment as illustrated by the median changes in serum creatinine and eGFR. This was as 
expected since renal function was essentially normal at baseline. Changes in CKD stages could not be 
assessed due to the small number of patients with assessment of proteinuria. 
Quality of life assessment 
Improvement in quality of life measures was documented for Global Health, all five functioning scales and 
all but three of the other components (financial difficulty, diarrhoea and constipation) of the EORTC 
QLQ-C30  
Overall, more eculizumab-treated patients had a clinically meaningful improvement (improvement of 10 
or more point) compared to those who did not receive eculizumab. For Global health, functioning scales, 
Insomnia, Dyspnea, nausea/vomiting, pain and loss of appetite, the mean change from baseline ranged

EMA/CHMP/204109/2015  
Page 14/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
from 12.3 to 27.2 in the Eculizumab group and was < 5 in the No Eculizumab group. The largest 
differences were observed for the functioning components (emotional, social, cognitive, role and 
physical). Almost half of the eculizumab treated patients reported a clinically meaningful improvement for 
dyspnea resulting in a mean change of 22.8.  It is noted that data were not available for all patients and 
that this was based on a non-blinded assessment and should be taken cautiously. On the other hand, it is 
recognised that it reflects clinical practice use and are consistent with other variables.  
Overall, resolution of symptoms generally occurred more frequently in patients treated with eculizumab 
than in those in the control group (No Eculizumab). Haemoglobinuria resolved in most patients on 
eculizumab while it was still present in the majority of those who did not receive eculizumab. Fatigue was 
reported by the majority of patients at baseline and at last assessment. Resolution of fatigue was 
somewhat more common in eculizumab treated patients than in the No Eculizumab group. Resolution of 
symptoms, specifically abdominal pain, dysphagia, backache and shortness of breath occurred more 
frequently in the Eculizumab group than in the No Eculizumab group.

MAVE assessments 
History of MAVE was different between eculizumab (29%) and non-eculizumab group (11%). No MAVE 
events were reported in the eculizumab treated group while 5 events in 4 patients were reported in the 
non-eculizumab treated arm.

The magnitude of the reduction in the incidence of thrombotic events for a given period of time, the same 
pre and post-treatment, was provided. Due to the fact that the majority of eculizumab-treated patients 
initiated treatment soon after enrolling in the Registry, the duration of time for which pre-eculizumab data 
have been collected is limited (24.85 and 72.65 person-years for the No Transfusions and Transfusion 
groups, respectively). Prior to initiating eculizumab, 2 patients with no history of transfusion and 6 with 
a history of transfusion reported MAVE, at rates of 8.05 per 100-person-years and 9.64 per 100- 
person-years, respectively. One patient in the Transfusion group reported 2 events. Both patients in the 
No Transfusion group experienced TE MAVE. Four patients with a recent history of transfusion each 
experienced 1 TE MAVE. There were 106.28 and 285.71 person-years of follow-up after eculizumab 
initiation in the No Transfusions and Transfusion groups, respectively. Over a total span of 392 
person-years on eculizumab treatment, only 1 MAVE was reported, at a rate of 0.25 per person-years for 
all patients on eculizumab with overall pre-treatment rate of 9.23/100 person-years (for 97.5 
person-years) and is statistically significant (p=0.001).  
Ancillary analyses 
Results from a “responder analysis", regarding change in fatigue i.e. proportion of patients switching from 
severe to moderate-mild scores for the two scales, for the no-eculizumab and the eculizumab treated 
groups separately, were submitted (see tables 7, 8).

Additionally, a substantial improvement in fatigue was observed in the Eculizumab subset (median 
change of +10.0 for FACIT-Fatigue and -22.2 for EORTC fatigue), in contrast to the No Eculizumab subset 
which demonstrated a median change of 0.0 in both scales.  
Furthermore, an updated analysis was performed based on a 01 July 2014 data extract, using the same 
population of patients and the same analyses as were performed for the original data based on a 01 July 
2013 data extract. The inclusion of 1 additional year of data collection yielded results (e.g. changes in 
LDH, fatigue, targeted adverse events, etc.) consistent with what was previously reported. 
Furthermore, consistent with the total population of patients analyzed in the PNH Registry analysis, 
patients with LDH ratio between 1.5x ULN to 3.5x ULN are at considerable risk for TE (rate of 7.70 TE per 
100-patient years from study enrolment to initiation of eculizumab). Following initiation of eculizumab, 
the rate of thrombotic event (TE) for this same subset of patients decreased to 0 per 100-patient years. 
In addition, the safety profile of this subset of patients is consistent with the profile of eculizumab in the 
entire Eculizumab group in the full analysis. These results support the relevance of inclusion of all patients 
with LDH ≥1.5x ULN in the PNH Registry analysis and importantly, the role of eculizumab treatment in 
providing clinically meaningful benefit and a favourable benefit/risk profile for patients with PNH across 
the spectrum of haemolysis as measured by LDH. 
To further support the clinically meaningful benefit and safety of eculizumab treatment in patients with 
PNH with haemolysis at the lowest levels of clinically meaningful haemolysis, a post-hoc analysis has been 
completed for the subset of patients with LDH between 1.5x ULN to 3.5x ULN without a history of 
transfusion. The results of this sub-population analysis are comparable to those of the full analysis 
population. Median LDH values in this subset of the Eculizumab group decreased from 740 U/L at baseline 
to 332.5 U/L at 6 months (n=14), compared to the No Eculizumab subset (758.5 U/L vs 719.5 U/L, 
respectively, n=58). 
Overall, no new safety signals were observed in an updated safety analysis in patients in the Eculizumab 
group. The updated safety profile is comparable to what has been previously described in the safety 
section of the SmPC and consistent with our clinical trials and post marketing data. In fact, based on 
results from the 01 July 2014 data extract, the No Eculizumab group had higher rates of infections, 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

impaired renal function, pulmonary hypertension, haemolysis and death relative to the Eculizumab group 
(Table 20). These results confirm a favourable eculizumab benefit/risk profile in the post-marketing 
setting for patients with PNH without a history of transfusion and LDH ≥1.5x ULN.

PNH Populations Treated with Eculizumab across studies: comparisons based on history of transfusion 
In this section, the data are further discussed in the context of the broad range of presentation for 
patients with PNH, and with particular reference to the history for transfusion, which was used as 
selection criteria in the design of the original eculizumab studies. Four populations of patients with PNH 
treated with eculizumab are considered: 
• Patients with no history of transfusion (PNH Registry) 
• Patients with a history of 0-1 transfusion (SHEPHERD Study) 
• Patients with heavy transfusion requirement: SHEPHERD with ≥2 transfusions and (TRIUMPH 
CSR)

Results 
Table 11: LDH change across cohorts treated with eculizumab 
Table 11:  
At the end of the 6-month follow-up in SHEPHERD and TRIUMPH or at last assessment in the never 
transfused group (the observation period extended to last available data with a median of 1.2 years), the 
median FACIT score was similar in all groups and ranged from 43 to 48 indicating minimal residual fatigue 
in the majority of patients. The median improvement was -11 in the TRIUMPH study and -33 in patients 
without a history of transfusion from the PNH Registry and the SHEPHERD study.  However, while fatigue 
was assessed blinded in the triumph Study, this was not the case for any of the other studies, what might 
have biased results. Further, within the no transfusion group of the Registry, data were missing for more 
than half of patients included in this subgroup and the assessment was done at different time points for 
each individual patient, so that data should be taken cautiously. Fatigue is a common symptom in PNH 
which may be present if haemolytic activity occurs, independently of its severity and the degree of 
anaemia. In this context, changes should be interpreted.

Supportive studies 
In addition, data from study C04-002 (SHEPHERD) were presented (see above). Relevant data are 
discussed in the initial MA for a subgroup of 22 patients who had a history of 0-1 transfusion prior to 
receiving eculizumab. This subgroup provided the first evidence of eculizumab activity in the minimally 
transfused PNH patient population. 
The secondary analysis consisted of a descriptive presentation of the subgroup of 75 patients enrolled in 
the SHEPHERD trial who had a history of 2 or more transfusions, a group which is largely similar to the 
TRIUMPH Study patients, which was comprised of patients with a history of frequent transfusion (at least

4 transfusions in 12 months prior to eculizumab). Data from TRIUMPH were used in this submission as a 
reference supporting the efficacy in heavily transfused patients with at least 4 transfusions in 12 months.  
Analyses from Shepherd and Triumph included changes in LDH at 6 months, changes in FACIT-fatigue 
score at 6 months or last available assessment, and changes in EORTC QLQ-C30 at 6 months or last 
available assessment.  
SHEPHERD Study – Analysis by History of Transfusion 
A total of 97 patients were enrolled in the SHEPHERD study. Of these 97 patients, twenty two received 
either 0 or 1 transfusion in the 12 months prior to enrolment. These 22 patients were considered 
minimally transfused as opposed to the remaining 75 patients with ≥2 transfusions in the 24 months prior 
to eculizumab. These 75 patients are similar to those accrued in the TRIUMPH study and represent the 
group of patients with a history of transfusion who formed the basis for the original approval of 
eculizumab in PNH. This section of the summary will primarily focus on the 22 patients from the 
SHEPHERD study with 0-1 transfusion. 
Baseline Characteristics 
The majority of patients in both groups were young adults with a median age of 45 years. There were 3 
patients greater than 65 years old in the group of 0-1 Transfusion and 4 in the group of ≥2 Transfusions. 
Numbers of males and females were similar.  
Patients presented with evidence of haemolysis as illustrated by elevated LDH levels in both groups with 
a median of 1991 U/L in patients with 0-1 transfusions and 2153 U/L in those with ≥2 transfusions. The 
majority of patients also presented with GPI deficient granulocytes (95% and 96% in each group) and all 
patients had various degree of anaemia: median Hb 9.1 g/dl (5.9, 11.6) vs 9.3 g/dl (4.8, 13.1), in the low 
and high transfusions groups, respectively. Five of the 22 patients in the 0-1 Transfusion group reported 
9 MAVE for an event rate of 4.9 events per 100 patient years of follow-up. These events consisted of 
cerebrovascular accident (4 events in 3 patients), deep vein thrombosis (2 patients), microvascular 
thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis and transient ischemic attack (one patient each). Among the 75 
patients with ≥2 transfusion, 37 patients (49%) reported 82 MAVEs for an event-rate of 15.3 per 100 
patient years of follow-up. Prior to eculizumab treatment, the majority of patients presented with 
clinically important symptoms of fatigue measured by either the FACIT-fatigue scale (median 27 vs 34 in 
low and high transfusion groups, respectively) or the EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue subscale ( median 56 vs 44 
in low and high transfusion groups, respectively). Prior to eculizumab treatment, patients reported 
clinically important impact on most measures of this instrument. Patients presented with important 
symptoms such as dyspnoea, insomnia, nausea/vomiting and pain. 
In general, based on Hb values, fatigue scores and accumulated rate of thrombotic events, the studied 
population appears more severe compared to that of the registry with no history of transfusions. 
Results 
At 6-month, all patients had a significant decrease in LDH level with a median change of -1793U/L 
(p<0.0001) in patients with 0-1 transfusions and -1813U/L (p<0.001) in those with ≥2 transfusion. At 
that time point, the LDH levels were normal or close to normal in the vast majority of patients with a 
median of 258 U/L and 277U/L in the two groups, respectively. Improvement in LDH levels were 
maintained throughout the entire study and its extension protocol (Study E05-001).  At 1 year, the 
majority of patients maintained normal or near normal LDH levels with a median LDH of 269 U/L and a 
range from 183 U/L to 2117 U/Lin patients with 0-1 transfusion. The corresponding median LDH in 
patients with ≥2 transfusion was also 269U/L.

Fifty one (74%) patients with ≥2 transfusions achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in the 
FACI-fatigue score and 52 (75%) patients achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in the EORTC 
fatigue score. The improved fatigue scores was maintained during the entire study and the extension 
phase (Study E05-001) with a median follow-up of 1.2 years. At last follow-up, the median FACIT score 
was 41 and the median EORTC fatigue score was 22 in the 0-1 Transfusion group.  
Significant improvements were documented in most domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30. The largest 
improvements were seen in Global Health and dyspnoea. Clinically meaningful improvement was also 
observed in all functioning scales (physical, emotional, role, social and cognitive). No changes in terms of 
constipation, diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, pain, and perception of financial difficulty were seen. 
PNH Populations Treated with Eculizumab across studies and comparisons based on history of transfusion 
are presented in the above section. 
Data were further discussed in the context of the broad range of presentation for patients with PNH, and 
with particular reference to the history for transfusion, which was used as selection criteria in the design 
of the original eculizumab studies. Four populations of patients with PNH treated with eculizumab are 
considered: Patients with no history of transfusion (PNH Registry); Patients with a history of 0-1 
transfusion (SHEPHERD Study); Patients with heavy transfusion requirement: SHEPHERD with ≥2 
transfusions and (TRIUMPH CSR) – see section above. A descriptive comparison of the baseline disease 
characteristics and results following eculizumab treatment in the 4 cohorts of patients defined on the 
basis of the history of previous transfusions is presented.  
Extension Trial (E05-001) 
This  was  an  extension  study  that  enrolled  patients  from  TRIUMPH  and  SHEPHERD  and  allowed  for 
longitudinal analysis of the benefits of eculizumab treatment in these patients with PNH. Patients from the 
placebo  arm  of  the  TRIUMPH  study  initiated  eculizumab  treatment  upon  enrolment  in  the  trial. 
Eculizumab treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in TE rate from 7.37 events per 100 
patient-years (124 total events) prior to receiving eculizumab treatment, compared to 1.07 events per 
100 patient-years in the same patients (3 total events) during eculizumab treatment (p<.001). Patients 
in the placebo group had an event rate of 4.38 events per 100 patient-years during the 26-week placebo 
treatment  period.  The  importance  of  these  findings  reinforce  that  TE  are  unpredictable  and  are  the 
leading cause of death in patients with PNH. Improvement in renal function was also observed during 
eculizumab therapy. These study results supported a favourable long term treatment benefit/risk profile 
among a population of patients with LDH ≥1.5x ULN at baseline and a mixed history of transfusions. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The randomized pivotal trial (TRIUMPH) supporting the original MA for eculizumab was designed to enrich 
the population for patients more likely to require a transfusion in the six month treatment period and  
showed that eculizumab significantly decreased the need for transfusion and provided higher frequency of 
haemoglobin stabilization compared to placebo; a significant and sustained reduction in intravascular 
haemolysis demonstrated by the reduction in LDH as well as improvement in the Functional Assessment 
of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) fatigue score; a statistically significant improvement in almost all 
components of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) quality of life questionnaire including global health, all five 
functioning scales and major symptoms such as fatigue, pain and dyspnoea relative to the placebo group. 
Consistent to what was described in the TRIUMPH study, most patients in SHEPHERD reported significant 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 23/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
improvement in the components of the EORTC QLQ-C30 quality of life instrument including fatigue, global 
health, functioning scales and various symptoms. 
The first evidence that both the complications of PNH as well as the benefit of eculizumab extend beyond 
the population of heavily transfused patients comes from the SHEPHERD study which included a small 
cohort of patients who had 0 or 1 transfusions in the year prior to enrolment. Data from these patients 
were reported at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology in 2007. This minimally 
transfused subgroup of patients presented with clinically important haemolysis and other manifestations 
of PNH including history of thrombotic events fatigue and decrease quality of life. After eculizumab, these 
patients exhibited a significant reduction of haemolysis (decrease in LDH), improvement in fatigue (FACIT 
fatigue scale) and reduction in thrombotic events. Independently, a group of Italian investigators 
reported on nine patients with PNH who were never transfused and were treated with eculizumab (14). 
Consistent with data from the clinical trials, these patients had a reduction in haemolysis (median LDH 
decreased from 1500 U/L at baseline to 356 U/L on eculizumab), increase in haemoglobin and 
improvement in quality of life. None of these 9 patients experienced a thrombotic event during follow up, 
although all of them had life-threatening thrombosis prior to eculizumab treatment. In addition the 
analysis of the two studies (TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD) as well as their extension study (Study E05-001) 
demonstrated a significant reduction in thrombotic events compared to historical data in the same 
patients prior to eculizumab as well as an improvement in renal function during eculizumab therapy. 
The possible use of the data from the PNH Registry (M07-001) in patients without a history of transfusion 
was discussed with the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) via the Scientific Advice process 
for protocol assistance. The MAH proposed to identify patients without a recent history of transfusion and 
to demonstrate that those patients had a burden of disease similar to those requiring transfusion. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
This type II variation is based on the analysis of patients accrued in the PNH registry that was not treated 
with eculizumab prior to enrolment. All patients accrued prior to 30 April 2012 and met the eligibility 
criteria were considered. A data cut-off of 01 July 2013 was selected, allowing for a minimum follow-up of 
six months. An update of these data should be provided. 
The PNH Registry (M07- 001) has accrued over 1500 patients who have a broad range of symptoms at 
presentation. The PNH Registry also serves as an important data source for documenting the burden of 
disease including morbidities and mortality, clinical outcomes and progression of PNH in eculizumab- and 
non–eculizumab-treated patients, irrespective of transfusion history. Such a large database also provides 
an opportunity to investigate specific populations. Clinical and laboratory data also provide the basis for 
the assessment of key efficacy parameters such as degree of haemolysis and quality of life. Based on the 
known risk of significant morbidities and premature mortality in PNH and the benefit of treatment with 
eculizumab in patients with PNH, such a database cannot be replicated in a prospective randomized study 
which would require a no-treatment control group. All patients accrued prior to 30 April 2012 and met the 
eligibility criteria; no history of transfusions, no prior treatment with eculizumab, LDH elevation, >1% 
granulocyte clone size, and at least 6-month FU were considered. A data cut-off of 01 July 2013 was 
selected, allowing for a minimum follow-up of six months; an update was provided up to the cut –off date 
of 1st July 2014. Additional supportive evidence from studies submitted as part of the initial application for 
marketing authorisation is presented and discussed in the light of the registry data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A subset of 189 out of the 1547 patients included in the registry fulfilled eligibility criteria: no history of 
transfusions, no prior treatment with eculizumab, LDH elevation, >1% granulocyte clone size, and at 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

least 6-month FU. Of them, 45 started eculizumab treatment after inclusion while 144 did not received 
eculizumab. Main efficacy results from the Registry show that in the group treated by eculizumab a 
clinically meaningful decrease of LDH is observed (-1042 [-4215, 597]); along with an improvement of 
scores reflecting fatigue is observed (FACIT-fatigue score: +8 [-8; 32]; EORTC-fatigue score: -22[-67; 
11]); an increase of hemoglobin level from 100 to 113 g/L is observed.  
No major sign of deterioration of the condition is observed in the group that did not receive eculizumab as 
levels of LDH, hemoglobin, fatigue scores are maintained, suggesting that these patients did not need the 
treatment with eculizumab.  
The  comparison  of  patients  treated  with  eculizumab  to  those  maintained  on  supportive  care  in  the 
Registry  (no  Eculizumab  group)  demonstrated  a  statistically  significant  reduction  of  haemolysis 
documented by the reduction in LDH, a clinically important improvement in fatigue and an improvement 
of all relevant domains on the EORTC QLQ-C30 quality of life assessment in favour of the Eculizumab 
treated group.  
However, this analysis has some limitations, otherwise not unexpected from a Registry, which makes 
interpretation of results not so straightforward. The groups of comparison within the registry (patients 
with no history of transfusions on eculizumab vs not on eculizumab) were not randomly selected and thus 
there are some differences between the groups of comparison in baseline disease characteristics which 
overall indicate that patients in the eculizumab treated group had a more severe disease.  Despite the 
pre-specified statistical analysis plan and the planned assessments every 6-month, there were a number 
of missing evaluations,; For LDH, 37 of 45 eculizumab treated nontransfused patients had values 
reported at 6 months follow-up.  However there were a number of patients who did not complete the 
patient reported outcome assessments of FACIT-Fatigue and EORTC Fatigue; considering the limited 
numbers of patients, this is of concern. In addition, assessment was not blinded, which might have biased 
evaluation of subjective endpoints such that fatigue, dyspnoea, QoL, other related symptoms.  
Further, the Triumph study that included patients with severe haemolysis (defined by the presence of 
symptomatic anaemia that required frequent transfusions) showed that by mitigating haemolysis a clear 
clinical benefit for the patients as measured by stabilization of anaemia (and thus reducing transfusions),  
related symptoms, and preventing associated morbidity in PNH was demonstrated. Also a reduction in the 
accumulated rate of thrombotic events, which are usually linked to haemolytic anaemia, the main cause 
of morbi-mortality in PNH, was shown.  
A comparison of the effects in different cohorts of patients from different studies but defined on the basis 
of prior transfusions is presented. Data were further discussed in the context of the broad range of 
presentation for patients with PNH, and with particular reference to the history for transfusion, which was 
used as selection criteria in the design of the original eculizumab studies. Four populations of patients 
with PNH treated with eculizumab are considered: Patients with no history of transfusion (PNH Registry); 
Patients with a history of 0-1 transfusion (SHEPHERD Study); Patients with heavy transfusion 
requirement: SHEPHERD with ≥2 transfusions and (TRIUMPH CSR). A descriptive comparison of the 
baseline disease characteristics and results following eculizumab treatment in the 4 cohorts of patients 
defined on the basis of the history of previous transfusions was presented. These data indicate that 
treatment with eculizumab mitigates intravascular haemolysis, as measured by median LDH change. 
Patients with PNH in all four groups displayed an important improvement in fatigue. 
It is therefore argued that the baseline disease characteristics of the cohort of patients without history of 
transfusions and who started eculizumab treatment after entering the Registry are indicative of a more 
serious condition compared to those not on eculizumab, as defined by the presence of a more intense 
haemolysis, lower haemoglobin levels, more patients with history of MAVE, more patients with clinically 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/204109/2015  
Page 25/38 
 
 
 
 
 
relevant fatigue or presence of other relevant symptoms like dyspnoea or abdominal pain.  Results, with 
the caution needed given the limitations noted above, are indicative of clinically relevant changes in 
associated morbidity in patients treated with eculizumab. While the focus on patients with haemolysis is 
reasonable, the proposal to define the severity of the haemolysis based on a single laboratory parameter 
is not considered appropriate as it is far away from the general clinical practice. LDH>1.5 ULN appears too 
low and unspecific to be acceptable as the only criteria to guide treatment and define the target 
population for eculizumab. LDH by itself is not considered an optimal tool when it comes to judge the 
severity of the disease. An acceptable indication should clearly reflect the PNH population where a 
positive benefit/risk balance can be concluded based on the data provided and also considering the 
current knowledge of the disease. An intense haemolysis should be present, but should not be the only 
criteria, as this might well be rather benign. Therefore, and in line with the evidence available, additional 
considerations like the presence of relevant symptomatology (e.g. anaemia, dyspnoea, fatigue, 
abdominal pain, etc) and/ or thrombotic complications should be required. In this sense, the indication 
should be defined on the basis of the presence of symptoms in SmPC section 4.1. The relevant 
information on clinical symptomatology of the included population is clearly reflected in Section 5.1 to 
provide useful information for prescribers.  
Soliris is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of patients with 
- Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). 
Evidence of clinical benefit of Soliris in the treatment of patients with PNH is limited demonstrated to 
in patients with history of transfusions haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high 
disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1). 
- Atypical haemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) (see section 5.1). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Soliris is shown in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) 
independently of prior transfusions who present with haemolysis and display relevant clinical symptoms. 
The data presented can support amendment of the indication of PNH is therefore amended as follows:  
Soliris is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of patients with 
- Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH). 
Evidence of clinical benefit of Soliris in the treatment of patients with PNH is limited demonstrated to 
in patients with history of transfusions haemolysis with clinical symptom(s) indicative of high 
disease activity, regardless of transfusion history (see section 5.1). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of Eculizumab in the treatment of PNH is well characterised. The most commonly 
reported adverse reactions in eculizumab treated patients are headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, 
pyrexia, myalgia, fatigue, and herpes simplex. Eculizumab treatment did not seem to be associated with 
an increase in severity of AEs in treated patients. No cumulative, irreversible toxicities have been 
reported.

EMA/CHMP/204109/2015

Patient exposure 
The evaluation of safety in the treatment of patients with PNH is based on two analyses: analysis based 
on data from PNH Registry patients with no history of transfusion and data from Alexion sponsored clinical 
studies – minimally transfused patients from SHEPHERD study and heavily transfused patients from 
TRIUMPH study. This report summarizes the safety events which were reported and analyzed from the 
following populations (targeted adverse events, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)), 
thrombotic events (TEs), death, malignancies etc.). 
•  Data collected from patients in the PNH Registry (up to data download 1 July 2013), who met the 
eligibility criteria for the analysis and were categorized based on their history of transfusion 
requirement and their exposure to eculizumab. The primary analysis to support safety and 
efficacy of eculizumab in patients without a history of transfusion was conducted on the 45 
patients without transfusion who received eculizumab and the 144 patients who remained 
untreated in the PNH Registry. As the PNH Registry is an observational study, no dosing regimen 
is specified. Patients are dosed as per physician discretion as part of their normal care. However, 
there is no reason to expect this dosing to be different than as specified in the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC). Duration of eculizumab treatment, and hence cumulative 
exposure, was a median of 1.3 (0.1 to 3.4) years in patients with no history of transfusion. 3 
patients discontinued eculizumab due to BMT (2 patients) and pregnancy (1 patient). Eculizumab 
median last dose 900mg (600mg – 900mg) 
•  Data from the minimally transfused sub group of patients (defined as 0 to 1 transfusion in the 12 
months prior to eculizumab initiation) from the Alexion sponsored SHEPHERD study (C04-002) 
are also described. The minimally transfused subgroup analysis of eculizumab-treated patients 
includes 22 patients out of the total 97 patients enrolled in the SHEPHERD study.  
•  Data from the heavily transfused (defined as ≥ 2 transfusion in the 12 months prior to eculizumab 
initiation) patients with PNH from Alexion sponsored TRIUMPH study (C04-001). This study was a 
randomized placebo controlled study and the data presented here includes the 43 
eculizumab-treated patients. 
Eculizumab-treated patients with no history of transfusion had a lower mean and median age. A total of 
9 paediatric patients (age < 18 at baseline) were in the analysis population; 6 in the no-eculizumab group 
and 3 in the treated group 
Adverse events 
Targeted adverse events analyzed for the PNH Registry patients with no history of transfusion included 
impaired renal function, impaired hepatic function, infections including meningococcal infection, 
malignancy, thrombotic events, haemolysis, infusion reaction, death, PHT, pregnancy and 
immunogenicity testing.  
From Triumph and Shepherd: Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for the minimally transfused 
SHEPHERD patients and eculizumab-treated TRIUMPH patients were summarized by relationship. In 
addition SAEs for these 2 groups were also summarized by severity. 
PNH Registry 
Patients in the no-eculizumab group reported a higher rate of infection, MAVE, death and haemolysis. All 
other events were reported at comparable frequencies between the two groups. Impaired renal function 
was the most commonly reported targeted adverse event; 9.0% of the no-eculizumab patients reported 
this event compared to 6.7% of eculizumab-treated patients. These targeted adverse events are as 
expected for this patient population and are consistent with the current eculizumab SmPC.

Among patients in the sensitivity analysis (i.e. not censored for transfusion), 7 patients in the 
no-eculizumab group reported infections that include pneumonia, and influenza. Four patients in the 
no-eculizumab group and 1 patient in the eculizumab-treated group reported malignancy. Lung 
metastasis from breast carcinoma reported in one case (no-eculizumab group) was fatal. All the other 
malignancies were not fatal and were ongoing at the time of data download. 
Pulmonary hypertension reported by 3 patients in the no-eculizumab group and 1 eculizumab treated 
patient. None of the patients reported meningococcal infection.

SHEPHERD and TRIUMPH Studies 
Table 16: Overview of adverse events in SHEPHED and TRIUMPH 
In the 22 minimally transfused patients from the SHEPHERD Study, 57 TEAEs reported by 13 patients, 
were considered related to eculizumab. Fifty-five TEAEs, reported by 12 patients, were considered 
possibly or probably related to eculizumab. One patient reported 2 TEAEs considered definitely related to 
eculizumab. The most common system organ class TEAE deemed related to eculizumab treatment was 
nervous system disorders (40.9%). Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (22.7%), 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (18.2%), General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (13.6%) and 
Infections and Infestations (13.6%) were other common TEAE deemed related to eculizumab treatment 
that each accounted for ≥10% of all TEAE. 
In the heavily transfused 43 patients from TRIUMPH study, 24 patients reported TEAE deemed related to 
eculizumab. Only 1 patient reported an event as definitely related TEAE (severe headache after receiving 
eculizumab infusion; event resolved the day after onset). The most commonly related TEAE was 
headache.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
PNH Registry 
Five deaths were recorded in the no-eculizumab group, one was of unknown cause, four were due to 
underlying conditions; heart failure, uro-sepsis, breast cancer, ischemic heart disease/chronic 
obstructive airway disease/ injury.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) reported to the pharmacovigilance database include one death in the 
eculizumab-treated group with no history of transfusion.  
SHEPHERD and TRIUMPH Studies 
•  Deaths 
No deaths were reported in the 22 minimally transfused patients during the SHEPHERD study. There were 
also no deaths reported in the 43 eculizumab-treated patients in the TRIUMPH study. 
•  Serious Adverse Events 
In the minimally transfused 22 patients from the SHEPHERD study, 3 patients (14%) experienced a total 
of 4 SAEs. Two moderate and two severe SAEs were reported, one each for Gastrointestinal Disorders, 
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, Hepatobiliary Disorders and Nervous System 
Disorders. The two severe SAEs were headache/increasing headache (SOC Nervous System Disorders) 
and pyrexia/fever of unknown origin (SOC General Disorders and Administration Site Condition

classified). Both were considered possibly related to drug. The moderate SAEs were both unrelated to 
drug and classified as cholelithiasis and abdominal pain. 
Four patients reported one SAE each in the eculizumab-treated patients from the TRIUMPH study. SAEs 
in both the SHEPHERD and TRIUMPH patients largely consisted of single-incident events, with limited 
differences between the 2 groups. 
In 3 out of the 5 death cases in the group of patients not receiving eculizumab, death appears not related 
to the PNH underlying condition. In one case the cause of death in unknown and the remaining appears 
closely related to the PNH condition. Data on treatment discontinuations are not of concern. Only one 
death was reported in the eculizumab treatment arm that occurred after eculizumab discontinuation 
(6-month apart). Differences in the absolute number of deaths are not conclusive given the low number 
of cases and the different in patients-exposure 
Concerning AEs, only top line results from targeted AEs and SAE has been presented. Safety profile 
appears in line with that known for this population and for eculizumab treatment. There were some 
differences between treatments of comparison in the absolute incidence of some relevant AEs but given 
the different observational periods and number of patients at risk, no conclusions can be drawn. 
Cumulative data should be provided. Further, changes in the incidence of MAVE pre and post inclusion in 
the registry for the two groups and for a similar period of time should be provided. These data have been 
provided and, with caution given the limited number of events and different follow up duration, appear to 
show a benefit in the reduction of thrombotic events.  
Laboratory findings 
The only information provided has been presented and discussed previously in the AR in relation to 
efficacy.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No such data have been submitted in the context of this variation 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No discontinuations due to AEs were reported in the group of patients with no transfusions from the 
Registry that form the basis of the current variation.  
Post marketing experience 
Data supporting the current variation comes from a Registry, which is reflective of postmarketing 
experience.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Eculizumab in the treatment of PNH is well characterised. The most commonly 
reported adverse reactions in eculizumab treated patients are headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, 
pyrexia, myalgia, fatigue, and herpes simplex. Eculizumab treatment did not seem to be associated with 
an increase in severity of AEs in treated patients. No cumulative, irreversible toxicities have been 
reported. 
Identified risks are general infections, especially meningococcal infections, which can be lifethreatening. 
Meningococcal sepsis, aspergillus infection, arthritis bacterial, upper respiratory tract infection, 
nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, oral Herpes, urinary tract infection and viral infection have been reported 
commonly in relation to eculizumab treatment. Prior to initiating Soliris therapy, it is recommended that 
PNH patients should receive immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Additionally, all 
patients must be vaccinated against meningococcus at least 2 weeks prior to receiving Soliris. If 
available, tetravalent, conjugated vaccines are recommended. Due to its mechanism of action, Soliris 
therapy should be administered with caution to patients with active systemic infections. Soliris therapy 
shall not be initiated in patients with unresolved Neisseria meningitides infection, who are not currently 
vaccinated against Neisseria meningitides, or who have known or suspected hereditary complement 
deficiencies 
Other commonly reported AEs include: dizziness, disgeusia, rash, alopecia, pruritus, arthralgia, myalgia, 
GI and respiratory symptoms and hypotension. 
Other identified risks include haemolysis after drug discontinuation and haematologic abnormalities. 
Administration of Soliris may result in infusion reactions or immunogenicity that could cause allergic or 
hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis). 
The risk of ADA is low. Infrequent, low titre antibody responses have been detected in Soliris treated 
patients across all PNH and non-PNH studies with a frequency (3.4%) similar to that of placebo (4.8%). 
No patients have been reported to develop neutralizing antibodies following therapy with Soliris, and 
there has been no observed correlation of antibody development to clinical response or adverse events.  
No secondary tumours, other than transformation in CMML in a patient with MDS, were detected. Due to 
eculizumab’s proposed mechanism of action, tumoural immunity is not expected to be affected in a major 
manner. There were no preclinical findings regarding this issue either. However, since limited long-term 
safety data are available and long term treatment is expected to be the rule, carcinogenic potential was 
keep in focus, particularly regarding haematological abnormalities.

Safety data from the SHEPHERD and TRIUMPH studies were included in the original MAA, approved in 
2007. A subgroup analysis which included the 22 minimally transfused patients from the SHEPHERD 
study demonstrates consistency in the rates and severity of TEAEs and SAEs among patients who receive 
eculizumab, with and without a prior history of transfusion. 
Safety data from the 144 patients in the no-eculizumab group and 45 patients in the eculizumab treated 
group with no history of transfusion from the PNH Registry were also presented. The analysis showed no 
substantive differences between the two groups. Five patients in the no-eculizumab patient group died 
and 1 death in the eculizumab-treated group was reported to the Pharmacovigilance database. No 
patients reported meningococcal infection. Overall these data are consistent with that known for this 
treatment and the PNH, and do not indicate any new safety findings. 
Further, the safety profile of eculizumab in patients without a history of transfusion was consistent with 
previously reported safety updates and the current SmPC, however it should be noted that this was a 
small group of patients, i.e. 45 PNH patients. A low number of reports of targeted adverse events in the 
PNH Registry or TEAEs in the Alexion sponsored study (SHEPHERD) indicates no new safety concerns. 
Overall analysis suggests that safety of eculizumab does not differ between PNH patients with or without 
a history of transfusion. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety findings have been identified in the subset of patients with no history of transfusions 
exposed to eculizumab. No major differences would be expected in the safety profile when targeting a 
broader PNH population.   
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
No revision to the RMP are deemed necessary as there is no new significant information regarding the 
safety specification, no additional pharmacovigilance activities nor further risk minimization activities 
required. The current version of eculizumab RMP (V10.1 submitted on March 12th, 2014) is acceptable. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. The 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
A clinically relevant benefit can be seen following treatment with eculizumab independently of the prior 
history and burden of transfusions. The new main evidence comes from the PNH registry, concretely from 
a subset of 189 out of the 1547 patients included in the registry who fulfilled eligibility criteria: no history 
of transfusions, no prior treatment with eculizumab, LDH elevation, >1% granulocyte clone size, and at 
least 6-month FU. Of them, 45 started eculizumab treatment after inclusion while 144 did not received 
eculizumab. In the group treated with eculizumab a clinically meaningful decrease of LDH is observed 
(-1042 [-4215, 597]); An improvement of scores reflecting fatigue is observed (FACIT-fatigue score: +8 
[-8; 32]; EORTC-fatigue score: -22[-67; 11]); An increase of hemoglobin level from 100 to 113 g/L is 
observed. 
These data suggest that a treatment with eculizumab could improve the condition of the patients without 
recent  history  of  transfusion  and  who  present  major  signs  of  severity  of  PNH.  Improvement  in  other 
related symptoms and a lower incidence of thrombotic events have been reported.   
Supportive evidence from PNH with low and high transfusion requirements, from the studies submitted as 
part of the initial MA (Shepherd and Triumph), is presented for comparison.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Despite the pre-specified statistical analysis plan and the planned assessments every 6-month, there 
were a number of missing evaluations,; For LDH, 37 of 45 eculizumab treated nontransfused patients had 
values reported at 6 months follow-up.  However there were a number of patients who did not complete 
the patient reported outcome assessments of FACIT-Fatigue and EORTC Fatigue. In addition, assessment 
was not blinded, which might have biased evaluation of subjective endpoints such that fatigue, dyspnoea, 
QoL, other related symptoms. The data have some limitations not unexpected from a Registry. 
Given the differences in baseline disease characteristics between the two cohorts of patients within the 
Registry and those included in the Triumph and Shepherd Studies, a similar analysis of the benefits based 
on the endpoints used to support a positive benefit/risk balance cannot be made.  Despite so, data 
presented are indicative of some symptomatic benefit as defined by the improvement in symptoms, QoL 
parameters and thrombotic events. The population included in the eculizumab cohort, based on the 
baseline disease characteristics, had more severe haemolysis with associated symptom and some 
experienced complications such as thrombotic events compared to those of the “no eculizumab” cohort. 
These findings indicate that a population of patients with PNH with haemolysis and clinical symptom(s) 
indicative of high disease activity might well benefit from treatment given the known associated 
morbidities.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of Eculizumab in the treatment of PNH is well characterised. The most commonly 
reported adverse reactions in eculizumab treated patients are headache, nasopharyngitis, nausea, 
pyrexia, myalgia, fatigue, and herpes simplex. Eculizumab treatment did not seem to be associated with 
an increase in severity of AEs in treated patients. No cumulative, irreversible toxicities have been

group with no history of transfusion from the PNH Registry were also presented. The analysis showed no 
substantive differences between the two groups. No patients reported meningococcal infection. Overall 
these data are consistent with what has been previously submitted and do not indicate any new safety 
findings. Limited top-line data suggest that safety of eculizumab does not differ between PNH patients 
with or without a history of transfusion. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As the unfavourable effects are well known already, no new uncertainties on the risks have been identified 
based on the new data provided.  
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Patients included in the Registry had not history of transfusions and based on the baseline disease 
characteristics it is considered this population represents a less severe population as compared to those 
of the Triumph Study but still a population with haemolysis and clinical symptoms indicative of high 
disease activity, which might well benefit from treatment given the known associated morbidities. 
Treatment with eculizumab provided a clinically relevant reduction in haemolysis and associated 
symptoms in those patients for whom data are available.  
The safety profile of eculizumab is well characterised and in view of a clear clinical benefit it can be 
accepted with appropriate monitoring and clinical management.

Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The benefit risk balance in the finally proposed indication, limited to patients with haemolysis and related 
clinical symptoms of high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history, reflects the studied 
population where data available support a positive benefit/risk balance.

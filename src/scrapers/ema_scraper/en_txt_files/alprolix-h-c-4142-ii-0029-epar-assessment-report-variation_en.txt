1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB 
(publ) submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 8 April 2020 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested

Annexes 
affected 
C.I.4  
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Submission of a variation to update sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to add information on 
Previously Untreated Patients (PUPs) following the completion of the clinical study 998HB303 from the 
agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) P/0071/2020 which was already assessed in 
EMEA/H/C/004142/P46 006. The PL and RMP have been updated accordingly. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
The application included (an) EMA Decision(s) P/0071/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric 
investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0071/2020 was completed.  
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0071/2020. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The MAH requests changes in the SmPC & PL due to new clinical data obtained in previously untreated 
patients (PUPs) with severe haemophilia B treated with Alprolix (study 998HB303: a completed Phase III 
study in 33 PUPs receiving Alprolix). Proposed changes affect SmPC sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 as well as 
PL section 4 to incorporate paediatric PUP data. 
The MAH had initially provided a tabulated list of adverse reactions showing separate frequencies for PTPs 
and PUPs in SmPC section 4.8. As the differentiation between PTPs and PUPs is only based on their different 
risk for inhibitor formation, deriving frequencies of adverse reactions from pooled safety data is considered 
more informative. Therefore, the MAH had been asked to amend the table and corresponding text passages 
by calculated frequencies for all adverse reactions (except FIX inhibition and hypersensitivity) based on all 
treated  subjects  (PTPs  +  PUPs).  The  MAH  did  not  provide  the  requested  pooled  analysis.  From  the  data 
provided by the MAH, a pooled analysis is not expected to result in changes in frequency categories apart 
from  injection  site  erythema  (which  would  be  changed  from  “common”  to  “uncommon”).  The  MAH  was 
advised  that  omission  of  a  pooled  analysis  can  eventually  be  accepted  since  the  presented  frequency 
category  rather  overestimates  the  frequency  which  can  be  considered  a  more  conservative  approach. 
Nevertheless,  data  presentation  in  section  4.8  needed  some  further  revision,  namely  the  deletion  of 
footnotes indicating differences between PTPs and PUPs apart from FIX inhibition and hypersensitivity. This 
was revised accordingly after the second round of assessment. 
While reporting frequencies of FIX inhibition and hypersensitivity only in PUPs is considered adequate, the 
MAH  specified  upon  request  that  both  events  occurred  in  a  single  previously  untreated  patient  and  that 
frequency calculations are not based on the entire population of treated subjects. This is endorsed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/562322/2020 
Page 4/22 
 
 
  
  
 
Importantly, the MAH recently submitted study 998HB303 in accordance with article 46 of regulation (EC) 
No 1901/2006. This procedure (EMEA/H/C/004142/P46 006) is completed with a positive outcome with 
this type II variation. 
As part of the article 46 procedure clarifications on several aspects had been requested with relevance 
also to the current variation request. Issues mainly pertaining to a considerable high number of subjects 
who did not complete the visits for inhibitor testing, a discussion of the impact on inhibitor detection 
(which might have impacted on the reported frequencies), clarifications on several efficacy related issues, 
(e.g. high numbers of injections needed to resolve bleeds in 2 patients, lack of haemostatic efficacy data 
for a high number of injections) have by now all been adequately addressed.  
Therefore, no outstanding issues on safety or efficacy remain.

5.  Introduction 
Recombinant factor IX Fc fusion protein (rFIXFc, Alprolix) is a long-acting, fully recombinant coagulation 
factor IX Fc fusion protein consisting of human coagulation factor IX (FIX) covalently linked to the Fc 
domain of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1).  
rFIXFc acts by temporarily replacing the missing endogenous FIX needed for effective hemostasis in 
people with hemophilia B. While the FIX moiety of rFIXFc retains FIX coagulation activity, the Fc 
component of rFIXFc binds to the neonatal Fc receptor, thereby increasing plasma-half life (protection 
from lysosomal degradation). 
Alprolix is approved for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital 
factor IX deficiency) in all age groups. 
The SmPC and leaflet changes proposed in this variation are based on results from the clinical study 
998HB303: An Open-Label, Multicenter Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of Recombinant Coagulation 
Factor IX Fc Fusion Protein (rFIXFc; BIIB029) in the Prevention and Treatment of Bleeding in Previously 
Untreated Patients With Severe Hemophilia B. The clinical study report was already submitted on 18 
February 2020 (EMEA/H/C/004142/P46 006) to meet the requirement to provide paediatric data within 6 
months of End of Study. At the time of the first assessment of this type II variation, the P46 procedure 
was in the clockstop phase awaiting additional clarification by the MAH. 
During the P46 assessment, it was concluded that safety and tolerability of Alprolix in PUPs appear largely 
comparable with the data generated in previously treated patients. Several uncertainties including FIX 
inhibitor development and efficacy outcomes needed to be clarified by the MAH as outlined in the 
assessment report of the P46 procedure. Therefore, no final conclusions on the requested SmPC changes 
could be made at that point. With this variation, all requests for additional clarification raised during the 
P46 procedure were addressed satisfactorily. 
6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. The (main) proposed RMP changes 
were the following: 
Summary of significant changes in this RMP: 
•  Part II: Revision of the safety specification to reflect cumulative post-marketing experience and 
completion of Study 998HB303 in previously untreated patients, and to the GVP Module V Rev. 
2, as applicable. 
•  Part III: Removal of study 998HB303 provisions, as study is completed. 
•  Part V and VI: Updated to reflect changes in Part II and III. 
1. Updated version Part II: Module SIII-Clinical trial exposure 
From 27 April 2010 (the Developmental International Birth Date) through 04 October 2019, 186 subjects 
have been enrolled and dosed with rFIXFc in the Biogen/ Bioverativ/ Sanofi-sponsored clinical studies. 
The cumulative subject exposure from completed clinical studies, is shown by age range and racial group

Notes: Percentages are based on the number of subjects with non-missing data in each study or overall. Subjects participating in more 
than one study are counted in both study columns. Each subject is counted only once in the total column. Fourteen subjects from the 
Phase 1/2a study (SYN-FIXFc-07-001) are excluded from this table as they received a single dose of rFIXFc.  
a For Study 9HB01EXT, the age used in classifying the subjects into different age categories was the age at entry to the parent study. 
Thirty-three (33) subjects (PUPs) with severe hemophilia B (≤2% endogenous FIX activity) received at 
least one dose of rFIXFc in study 998HB303. For subjects on the episodic treatment regimen, the median 
number of EDs was 2.5 days (range 0 to 26 days) and the median number of weeks was 22.86 (range 
0.3 to164.2 weeks). For subjects on the prophylactic treatment regimen, the median number of EDs was 
81.5 days (range 10 to 136 days) and the median number of weeks was 77.5 (range 10.1 to 134.0 
weeks). The overall median number of EDs was 76 days (range 1 to137 days) and the overall median 
number of weeks on treatment was 83.01 (range 6.7 to 226 weeks). Total EDs was 2,233 days. The 
number of subjects with at least 10 EDs was 28 (84.8%), at least 20 EDs was 26 (78.8%), at least 50 
EDs was 21 (63.6%), at least 75 EDs was 18 (54.5%), and at least 100 EDs was 11 (33.3%). The median 
age was 0.6 years (range 0.08 to 2 years) and the median weight was 9 kg (range 4.6 to 17 kg). 
Adverse events were monitored for a total of 57.51 subject-years.

The MAH states that there are no new safety concerns compared to the previous version of the RMP. 
In this updated EU RMP (Version 2.1), the previous list of safety concerns has been re-evaluated 
according to the cumulative post-marketing experience and/or the completed PUP study (Study 
998HB303) when applicable and to the European Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP)-
Module V-Risk management systems (Rev. 2). 
The safety concern “Serious hypersensitivity, serious allergic reaction, and/or anaphylaxis” previously 
classified as important identified risk in the EU RMP (version 2.0) is removed from the list of safety 
concerns in this updated EU RMP (version 2.1) to be aligned with this updated GVP guidance which 
recommends including only those important identified risks that warrant further evaluation and risk 
minimization activities. This risk is communicated in the current product information including relevant 
instructions as applicable. In addition, in the specialized clinical practice where rFIXFc is used, this risk 
and its management are known. This risk requires no further characterization or additional risk 
minimization activities and will only be followed by routine pharmacovigilance. 
PRAC Rapp comment: 
MAH’s arguments are acknowledged and wording as well as intention of GVP module V rev.2 is well 
known. Hypersensitivity and in particular severe anaphylactic reactions frequently occur in the context of 
inhibitor development, so that the argument to remove it from identified risks is comprehensible, 
however, not supported. From the assessor’s point of view, it may be advisable to keep hypersensitivity 
and anaphylactic reactions in identified risks for the moment since besides the association to inhibitor 
development, the risk also is separately existing and under this aspect a separate class risk for 
coagulation factor concentrates. Further, RMP section SVII “safety concerns” is directly linked to PSUR 
section 16.3 “Evaluation of Risks and New information” where MAHs elaborate on the most recent data 
received for identified and potential risks risks, which is considered especially valuable for periodic re-
assessment of the benefit-risk-balance of a product. Taking both into account the MAH is asked to re-
include the risk in identified risks of safety concerns moreover since in the currently completed PUP study 
also a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurred. 
In view of Removal of medication errors from potential risks is accepted. 
Amendment to missing information is widely accepted, however, missing information on pregnancy and 
lactation should be kept, since all study participants were males and safety profile in this special female 
population is not known though being very unlikely to be different from that of males. 
Please re-include hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions in identified risks and Safety profile in 
women including pregnant and breast-feeding women in missing information.

4. Updated version Part III: Pharmacovigilance Plan 
Updated version Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection for rFIXFc 
includes: 
Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires for the following important risks: 
• Inhibitor development to FIX 
•  Serious hypersensitivity, serious allergic reaction, and/or anaphylaxis removed 
• Serious vascular thromboembolic events 
PRAC Rapp comment: 
Please re-include questionnaire for serious hypersensitivity and allergic/anaphylactic reactions due to the 
above arguments.

5. Updated version RMP Part III. V.1. Routine Risk Minimisation Measures 
PRAC Rapp comment: 
Please amend tables 7 (Description of routine risk minimization measures by safety concern) and 8 
(Summary table of pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimization activities by safety concern) 
accordingly to assessor’s request to Part II: Module SVII Identified and potential risks, referring to re-
inclusion of hypersensitivity and allergic/anaphylactic reactions in important identified risks. 
6. Updated version RMP Part VI Summary of activities in the risk management plan by product 
PRAC Rapp comment: 
Please amend summary of the RMP also appropriately 
6.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP are acceptable following 2nd responses submitted on 24 August by MAH 
7.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to incorporate data 
obtained from the paediatric study of Alprolix in PUPs. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
The paragraph on PUPs in section 4.2 (“The safety and efficacy of ALPROLIX in previously untreated patients 
have not yet been established. No data are available.”) was removed. This change is in line with the relevant 
guideline and therefore acceptable. 
Changes in section 4.8 comprise an updated tabulated list of adverse reactions and information on factor 
IX inhibitor development in PUPs.  
Inclusion of the adverse reactions “Factor IX inhibition”, “Hypersensitivity”, and “Injection site erythema” 
are considered acceptable in principle. However, revisions were considered necessary to adequately reflect 
these additional adverse reactions in section 4.8. 
The  tabulated  list  of  adverse  reactions  proposed  at  the  initial  type  II  variation  request  showed  separate 
frequencies for PTPs and PUPs, respectively, as can be seen below:

Except  for  FIX  inhibition  and  hypersensitivity,  this was  not  considered  meaningful.  As  the  differentiation 
between PTPs and PUPs is only based on their different risk for inhibitor formation, deriving frequencies of 
adverse reactions from pooled safety data was considered more informative. The MAH had therefore been 
advised in the first round of assessment to calculate frequencies for injection site erythema and all other 
adverse  reactions  (except  FIX  inhibition  and  hypersensitivity)  based  on  a  pooled  analysis  of  all  treated 
subjects (PTPs + PUPs) as these adverse reactions are not specific to a particular patient group (PTPs or 
PUPs), and to present them in one single column labelled “Frequency category”. This is also in line with the 
SmPC Guideline that states: “Safety data from several studies should be pooled to increase the precision 
of  adverse  reaction  rates  as  appropriate  without  introducing  bias  (e.g.  major  difference  in  population 
characteristics  or  exposure  to  the  product)”.  The  MAH  agreed  to  using  a  single  column  (“Frequency 
category”) which is endorsed. However, the MAH did not provide the requested pooled analysis. From the 
data provided by the MAH, a pooled analysis was not expected to result in changes in frequency categories 
apart from injection site erythema (which would be changed from “common” to “uncommon”). The MAH 
was advised that omission of a pooled analysis, can eventually be accepted since the presented frequency 
category  rather  overestimates  the  frequency  which  can  be  considered  a  more  conservative  approach.  
Nevertheless,  data  presentation  in  section  4.8  needed  some  further  revision,  namely  the  deletion  of 
footnotes indicating differences between PTPs and PUPs apart from FIX inhibition and hypersensitivity. This 
was revised accordingly after the second round of assessment.  
In contrast, for FIX inhibition and hypersensitivity occurring during the PUP study, the frequency derived 
from PUPs only is considered adequate. The MAH was asked to clearly state in a footnote that both events 
of  Factor  IX  inhibition  and  hypersensitivity  occurred  in  a  single  previously  untreated  patient,  and  that 
calculation of frequency is not based on all treated subjects but in this case only on PUPs. This issue has 
been resolved.  
It is acknowledged that the precision of the inhibitor incidence in study 998HB303 is low (3.03% [95% CI: 
0.08%,  15.76%]).  It  is  therefore  not  considered  adequate  to  use  this  for  comparison  against  any  other 
products. However, as the frequency deriving from the study results is also in line with that generally stated 
in the FIX guideline (“Inhibitors to factor IX have been demonstrated in approximately 4% of patients with 
severe haemophilia B”) it is considered justified to state the frequency of “common” in the SmPC despite 
the possibility of a true inhibitor incidence of 15.76% (upper limit of the 95% CI). Anyway, according to 
the  SmPC  GL  frequency  should  represent  crude  incidence  rates  and  therefore  the  frequency  category 
“common” is applicable. 
Changes in section 5.1. pertain to efficacy and safety information derived from the PUP study. Results were 
proposed to be added in accordance with results from studies in PTPs. The MAH was asked to make it more 
clear to the reader that ABR is not comparable between different factor concentrates and between different 
clinical studies. The corresponding sentence derived from the Factor IX core SmPC guideline was shifted 
within section “Clinical efficacy and safety” as indicated.   
Initially, it was unclear, why a considerable high number of PUPs had not completed the visits for inhibitor

testing  which  might  have  impacted  on  reported  inhibitor  frequencies.  Additionally,  uncertainties  in  this 
patient group regarding annualized Alprolix consumption, high numbers of injections to treat a single bleed 
in 2 subjects and follow up-data on the subject who developed a factor IX inhibitor (and hypersensitivity) 
existed. These concerns were expressed during the assessment of the P46 procedure (ongoing at that time) 
and were subject of request for additional clarification.  To date, these concerns on efficacy and safety have 
been  adequately  addressed  by  the  MAH  in  the  response  to  the  P46  assessment  report.  Therefore,  no 
outstanding issues on safety or efficacy remain.

None. 
8.2.  Other concerns 
1. 
In section 4.8 the following changes are necessary: 
The MAH should calculate frequencies for injection site erythema and all other adverse reactions 
(except FIX inhibition and hypersensitivity) based on a pooled analysis of all treated subjects (PTPs 
+ PUPs) and present them in one single column labelled “Frequency category”. For FIX inhibition 
and hypersensitivity occurring during the PUP study, the frequency derived from PUPs only is 
considered adequate. It should be clearly stated in a footnote that both events of Factor IX 
inhibition and hypersensitivity occurred in a single previously untreated patient, and that 
calculation of frequency is not based on all treated subjects but in this case only on PUPs. Other 
minor revisions in this section are requested (comments provided in Product Information). 
2. 
The basis for the proposed changes of the Product Information is study 998HB303 which was 
submitted and assessed during EMEA/H/C/004142/P46 006. Additional clarification as requested 
during the P46 procedure is also necessary for assessment of the PI changes. The MAH is therefore 
asked to address the following questions (identical to the questions raised in the above mentioned 
P46 procedure): 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The MAH is asked to provide any follow-up data on patient who discontinued the study due to 
inhibitor development, if available.  
The MAH is asked for clarification why a considerable high number of subjects did not complete 
the visits for inhibitor testing. Furthermore, a discussion is awaited whether detection of any 
inhibitors potentially occurring during the study was possible in light of the poor adherence to 
study visits. 
The MAH is asked to discuss the following two bleeding episodes in two subjects in more detail 
and to explain the high number of injections needed for resolution: 
The median annualized rFIXFc consumption was 203.2 IU/kg (range 0 to 5719 IU/kg) in the 
episodic treatment arm and 3175.0 IU/kg (range 2544 to 13164 IU/kg) in the prophylaxis 
treatment arm. The overall median annualized rFIXFc consumption was reported as 2673.3 
IU/kg (range 0 to 10507 IU/kg). Clarification is needed regarding discrepancies in ranges 
(shown as min and max values) of the overall median annualized consumption.

•  No patient response was provided for a high number of injections: 58 (72.5%) in the episodic 
treatment arm and 17 (23.0%) in the prophylactic treatment arm, respectively. The MAH is 
asked to clarify why no reports were received for such a high number of bleeding episodes and 
to discuss the interpretability of results.

Question 1: 
In section 4.8 the following changes are necessary: 
The MAH should calculate frequencies for injection site erythema and all other adverse reactions (except 
FIX inhibition and hypersensitivity) based on a pooled analysis of all treated subjects (PTPs + PUPs) and 
present them in one single column labelled “Frequency category”. For FIX inhibition and hypersensitivity 
occurring during the PUP study, the frequency derived from PUPs only is considered adequate. It should 
be clearly stated in a footnote that both events of Factor IX inhibition and hypersensitivity occurred in a 
single previously untreated patient, and that calculation of frequency is not based on all treated subjects 
but in this case only on PUPs. Other minor revisions in this section are requested (see comments in 
Product Information). 
Summary of MAH’s responses: 
Data from a total of 153 PTPs and 33 PUPs is available from the clinical development program. In total, 
there were 3 ADRs identified in PUPs, none of which overlapped with ADRs observed in PTPs. Taking the 
different treatment backgrounds of PTP and PUP populations into account, the MAH considers that there 
would be a very limited additional benefit of performing a pooled analysis of all treated subjects. 
We acknowledge the benefits of presenting frequencies in a single column and propose a change where 
footnotes are used to clarify the data sources. We also propose additional information on the factor IX 
inhibition and hypersensitivity under the subheading Description of selected adverse reactions. 
Assessment of MAH’s responses: 
The MAH states that data from 153 PTPs and 33 PUPs are available from the clinical development 
program. A total of 3 ADRs were identified in PUPs, none of which overlapped with ADRs in PTPs. The 
MAH argues that pooled ADR analysis would only add very limited additional benefit considering the 
different treatment backgrounds of the two populations and did not provide the requested pooled 
analysis. However, differentiation between PUPs and PTPs in Section 4.8 could be misleading, and a 
tabulated list of adverse events reflecting the entire haemophilia B population studied without further 
sub-division is considered more appropriate. The only exceptions are the two ADRs factor IX inhibition 
and hypersensitivity, with respective frequencies being specific for PUPs (as both events are known to 
occur with higher frequency in PUPs than in PTPs in haemophilia B). All other ADRs shall be presented for 
the entire haemophilia B population. From the data provided by the MAH, a pooled analysis is not 
expected to result in changes in frequency categories apart from injection site erythema (which would be 
changed from “common” to “uncommon”).  Yet, if the MAH prefers to omit a pooled analysis, this can 
eventually be accepted since the presented frequency category rather overestimates the frequency which 
can be considered a more conservative approach. Nevertheless, data presentation in section 4.8 needs 
some further revision, namely the deletion of footnotes indicating differences between PTPs and PUPs 
apart from FIX inhibition and hypersensitivity.

The MAH submitted an updated SmPC adequately incorporating the abovementioned requests. 
Conclusion: 
Issue resolved. 
Question 2: 
The basis for the proposed changes of the Product Information is study 998HB303 which was submitted 
and assessed during EMEA/H/C/004142/P46 006. Additional clarification as requested during the P46 
procedure is also necessary for assessment of the PI changes. The MAH is therefore asked to address the 
following questions (identical to the questions raised in the above mentioned P46 procedure): 
•  The MAH is asked to provide any follow-up data on patient who discontinued the study due to 
inhibitor development, if available.  
•  The MAH is asked for clarification why a considerable high number of subjects did not complete the 
visits for inhibitor testing. Furthermore, a discussion is awaited whether detection of any inhibitors 
potentially occurring during the study was possible in light of the poor adherence to study visits. 
•  The MAH is asked to discuss the following two bleeding episodes in two subjects in more detail and 
to explain the high number of injections needed for resolution: 
•  The median annualised rFIXFc consumption was 203.2 IU/kg (range 0 to 5719 IU/kg) in the 
episodic treatment arm and 3175.0 IU/kg (range 2544 to 13164 IU/kg) in the prophylaxis 
treatment arm. The overall median annualized rFIXFc consumption was reported as 2673.3 IU/kg 
(range 0 to 10507 IU/kg). Clarification is needed regarding discrepancies in ranges (shown as min 
and max values) of the overall median annualized consumption. 
•  No patient response was provided for a high number of injections: 58 (72.5%) in the episodic 
treatment arm and 17 (23.0%) in the prophylactic treatment arm, respectively. The MAH is asked 
to clarify why no reports were received for such a high number of bleeding episodes and to discuss 
the interpretability of results. 
Summary of MAH’s responses: 
The response to these questions has been submitted on 4 June 2020 as part of the ongoing procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004142/P46/006. 
Assessment of MAH’s responses: 
The MAH has provided responses to all points of question 2 as part of the procedure 
EMEA/H/C/004142/P46/006, adequately addressing these issues.

women including pregnant and breast-feeding women in missing information. 
Assessment report  
EMA/562322/2020 
Page 19/22 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Summary of MAH’s responses: 
The MAH agree to reintroduce “Serious hypersensitivity” as an important identified risk, the MAH 
suggest revising title of the safety concern to “Serious hypersensitivity” as this would also include 
serious allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. 
The RMP Part II: Module SVII Identified and potential risks and other relevant sections, has been updated 
accordingly. 
The MAH disagree to re-include “Use in women including pregnant and breast-feeding women” as the 
revised GVP guidance states that the absence of data itself (e.g. exclusion of a population from clinical 
studies) does not automatically constitute a safety concern. Also: 
•  The target population for Alprolix is predominantly male, and although female patients were not 
included in the clinical studies the MAH agrees with Assessors comment that the safety profile in 
this special female population is not known though being very unlikely to be different from that of 
males. 
•  Information regarding use in pregnancy and breast-feeding is described in SmPC 
•  There are no additional Pharmacovigilance activities to further characterize use in female patients 
•  Routine pharmacovigilance activities would ensure all reports of special situations, i.e. use during 
pregnancy and lactation, are followed-up thoroughly. 
•  Information on use in pregnant or lactating women will be presented in PSURs, as post-
authorization use in special populations, as applicable. 
Assessment of MAH’s responses: 
The MAH’s arguments are acknowledged regarding the main target population as well as the presumably 
rather similar safety profile in women. In view of pregnancy and lactation there might be significant 
differences, however, in terms of the rarity of such treatment current routine pharmacovigilance 
(including special follow-up for pregnancy cases) measures may be sufficient. 
Conclusion: 
Issues resolved. 
Question 4: 
Please re-include questionnaire for serious hypersensitivity and allergic/anaphylactic reactions. 
Summary of MAH’s responses: 
The questionnaire for serious hypersensitivity and allergic/anaphylactic reactions has been re-included in 
the RMP (Annex 4). 
Assessment of MAH’s responses: 
The MAH has re-introduced the questionnaires as requested. 
Conclusion: 
Issues resolved.

Question 5: 
Please amend tables accordingly to request in Part II: Module SVII Identified and potential risks, referring 
to re-inclusion of hypersensitivity and allergic/anaphylactic reactions in important identified risks. 
Summary of MAH’s responses: 
The RMP Table 5 was incorrect and was amended accordingly. 
Assessment of MAH’s responses: 
There was a mistake in one of the tables in the RMP (i.e. Serious hypersensitivity was re-introduced in 
wrong row; under important potential risks, it should remain as an important identified risk).  
Updated conclusion following second round of responses: 
Updated correct tables were provided. 
Conclusion: 
Issue resolved. 
Question 6: 
Please amend summary of the RMP also appropriately. 
Summary of MAH’s responses: 
The RMP summary has been amended accordingly. 
Assessment of MAH’s responses: 
The RMP Summary was amended accordingly.  
Updated conclusion following submission of an updated RMP: 
Updated correct tables were provided.

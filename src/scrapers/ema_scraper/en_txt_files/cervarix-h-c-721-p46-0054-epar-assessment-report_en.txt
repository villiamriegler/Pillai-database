1.  RECOMMENDATION 
Based on the review of the paediatric data on safety and immunogenicity collected in study HPV-021 
the Rapporteur considers that the benefit-risk balance for the above mentioned product remains 
unchanged and therefore does not require further regulatory action on the marketing authorisation for 
Cervarix. The SmPC and PIL remain unchanged.  
With the submission of the final study results of study HPV-021 FUM054 can be considered as being 
fulfilled.  
2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
The current study was designed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals’ HPV-
16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine in female subjects enrolled from multiple countries in Africa.  
Ideally, HPV vaccination should be performed before onset of sexual activity, since studies have shown 
that acquisition of high-risk HPV occurs soon after sexual debut. Study HPV-021 was therefore 
designed to evaluate the HPV vaccine in subjects aged 10 to 25 years of age. This study report 
presents the analysis of final immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety data collected up to Visit 8 
(Month 12) for all subjects enrolled from Senegal and Tanzania. The study was conducted from 1 
October 2007 till 26 July 2010. Data lock point: 10 November 2010. 
2.1.  STUDY METHODOLOGY 
2.1.1.  Objectives 
Co-primary objectives 
To  evaluate  antibody  responses  (ELISA)  against  HPV-16  and  HPV-18  at  Month  7  in  subjects  15-25 
years of age and subjects 10 - 14 years of age. 
Secondary objectives 
To  evaluate  antibody  responses  (ELISA)  against  HPV-16  and  HPV-18  in  all  subjects  at  Month  2  and 
Month 12. 
To  evaluate  the  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  the  study  vaccine  in  all  subjects  throughout  the  entire 
study period. 
2.1.2.  Design 
The study design is shown in the figure below.

BS: Blood sample 
Two  interim  analyses  (1  and  2)  were  planned:  the  first  when  all  subjects  in  Senegal  had 
completed Visit 6 (presented in the Interim Report 1 dated 22 January 2010) and the second when 
all  subjects  in  Tanzania  had  completed  Visit  6  (presented  in  the  Interim  Report  2  dated  29 
November 2010).  
The  final  analyses  were  performed  when  all  subjects  completed  Visit  8  (Month  12)  and  are 
presented in the current report.  
†Pregnancies were to be followed until delivery (even if the delivery occurred after the end of the 
study).  
N = Number of subjects planned to be enrolled.

− 
Phase IIIb, controlled, randomized (2:1), double blind, multicentre trial with two parallel groups: 
Cervarix and Aluminium Hydroxide Al(OH)3 as control. Two study centres in Dakar (Senegal) and 
Mwanza (Tanzania). 
Treatment groups: Enrolment into each treatment group was age-stratified, with two age strata 
(15 - 25 years of age and 10 - 14 years of age) with approximately one third of the total number 
of subjects enrolled in the second age stratum as follows: 
− 
Vaccination schedule: three doses of vaccine/control according to a 0, 1, 6 month schedule.

−  Within thirty days before administration of the first vaccine/control dose, subjects were invited to 
a screening visit. The following study procedures were performed during this visit: 
• 
Informed consent was obtained from the subject.  
•  Review of medical history 
•  General physical examination 
• 
• 
Pregnancy test 
If the pregnancy test was negative, a blood sample was to be collected to perform Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing and hematological and biochemical parameters 
measurements. 
After the screening visit, only eligible subjects, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were 
enrolled in the study. 
− 
− 
− 
− 
Blood samples were collected at Visits 1, 3, 6 and 8, i.e., at Day 0, Months 2, 7 and 12), to test 
hematological and biochemical parameters and to perform HIV testing (at Day -30, Visits 6 and 8, 
i.e., at Months 7 and 12). 
Urine pregnancy tests were performed before administration of each vaccine dose. 
A behavioral questionnaire was completed by interview at screening and Month 7 to collect 
information on marital status, smoking history, sexual and reproductive history and contraception 
status. 
Safety and reactogenicity information were monitored as follows: 
•  Solicited signs and symptoms were recorded on Day 0 and on the 6 subsequent days (Days 1 - 
6).  
•  Unsolicited signs and symptoms were reported within 30 days (Days 0 - 29) after each 
vaccination.  
•  Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded in all subjects throughout the study (up to Month 
12). 
•  New onset of chronic diseases (NOCDs) and other medically significant conditions (i.e., AEs 
prompting emergency room or physician visits that were not (1) related to common diseases 
or (2) routine visits for physical examination or vaccination, or SAEs that were not related to 
common diseases) were reported throughout the entire study (up to Month 12) regardless of 
causal relationship to vaccination and intensity. 
• 
Pregnancies and pregnancy outcome were to be recorded throughout the study period (up to 
Month 12) and subjects were to be followed until delivery (even if the delivery occurs after the 
end of the study). 
Assessor’s note: with respect to the assessment of safety variables, please refer to the clinical 
study report. The methodology for classifying the severity of adverse events was similar to the 
methodology of other GSK sponsored studies.

The data of the first interim analysis was presented in the Interim Report 1 dated 22 January 2010. 
The data of the second interim analysis was presented in the Interim Report 2 dated 29 November 
2010. Assessor’s note: it remains unclear whether the interim reports were submitted to CHMP. 
2.1.3.  Laboratory assays and time-points 
Assessor’s note: 
Serological assays were performed at GSK Biologicals laboratories, Rixensart, Belgium. The assays 
have extensively been described in the initial registration dossier and not repeated here. Biochemical 
and hematological assays were performed by BIO-24 Laboratory, Dakar, Senegal and by the National 
Institute for Medical Research, Mwanza and Duke University KCMC Collaboration laboratories, Moshi, 
Tanzania. Further details are available in the final clinical study report. 
2.1.4.  Determination of sample size 
The first primary objective of this study was to evaluate antibody responses against HPV-16 and HPV-
18 (by ELISA) at Month 7 in HPV vaccine recipients aged 15-25 years. The second co-primary objective 
was to evaluate antibody responses against HPV- 16 and HPV-18 (by ELISA) at Month 7 in 10-14 year 
old HPV recipients. 
Approximately 666 subjects were to be enrolled in the trial. Using a 2:1 randomization ratio, 444 
subjects were to receive the HPV vaccine and 222 were to receive the control. The enrolment was also 
age-stratified, with approximately one third of the total number of subjects enrolled in the second age 
stratum (10-14 year olds). Assuming that 30% of subjects enrolled in this study would be non-
evaluable at the time of the analysis (e.g., drop-outs, initially seropositive for HPV-16 and/or HPV-18, 
etc.) it was expected that there would be 309 evaluable subjects in the HPV vaccine group (206 
evaluable subjects aged 15-25 years and 103 evaluable subjects aged 10-14 years). 
Table 10 shows the power to demonstrate a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
seroconversion rate above 90% when the true seroconversion rate was 98%. The power was 99% in 
15-25 year olds and 94% in 10-14 year olds. Calculations were performed using Power and sample 
size (PASS) 2005, using a two-sided exact test for one binomial proportion (Proportion - 1 group), type 
I error of 5%.

2.1.5.  Study cohorts/data sets analyzed 
According To Protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity 
The ATP cohort for immunogenicity included all evaluable subjects (i.e. those meeting all eligibility 
criteria, complying with the procedures and intervals defined in the protocol, with no elimination 
criteria during the study) for whom data concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were 
available. These included subjects for whom assay results were available for antibodies against at least 
one study vaccine antigen component after vaccination. The ATP cohort for immunogenicity was based 
on data up to Month 7 while the ATP cohort for immunogenicity Month 12 was based on data up to 
Month 12. 
Total Vaccinated cohort 
The Total Vaccinated cohort included all vaccinated subjects. Thus, the Total Vaccinated cohort for 
analysis of safety included all subjects with at least one vaccine administration documented and the 
Total Vaccinated cohort for analysis of immunogenicity included vaccinated subjects for whom data 
concerning immunogenicity endpoint measures were available. The Total Vaccinated cohort Month 12 
was limited to subjects for whom Month 12 data were available. The Total Vaccinated cohort analysis 
was performed per treatment actually administered. 
According-To-Protocol (ATP) cohort for safety: all subjects: 
•  who had received three doses of study vaccine/control according to their random assignment 
• 
for whom administration site of study vaccine was known 
•  who had not received a vaccine not specified or forbidden in the protocol 
• 
for whom the randomization code had not been broken.

2.1.6.  Protocol amendments 
There were two amendments to the study protocol dated 30 June 2006. A summary of the major 
changes introduced by each amendment is given below. The major changes were as follows: 
Amendment 1 (dated 5 July 2007) 
• 
• 
The global sample size was decreased from 999 to 666 subjects, as only two countries 
participated in the study. 
The temperature monitoring devices used during storage of the vaccine were changed. 
•  Medical history was updated to include information concerning contraception and smoking. The 
medical history collection was also added at Visit 1, in addition to the screening visit, and it 
was clarified that medical history information was to be recorded in the eCRF. 
Amendment 2 (dated 12 December 2008) 
• 
• 
Two interim analyses (1 and 2) were added to be performed when: (1) all subjects enrolled in 
Senegal had completed Visit 6 (Month 7) and (2) all subjects in Tanzania had completed Visit 6 
(Month 7). 
The list of study procedures, study design overview and statistical considerations were updated 
to include the two interim analyses. 
Other changes 
• 
• 
• 
• 
This study was conducted according to protocol amendment 2, dated 12 December 2008, and 
the RAP dated 10 November 2009 with the following exceptions: 
The secondary endpoints of the protocol state that the analysis of SAEs, NOCDs, other 
medically significant conditions and pregnancies (and their outcome) from Month 7 through the 
Month 12 follow-up visit will be presented in a separate annex report. As part of the changes in 
protocol amendment 2, the analysis of safety endpoints from Month 7 to Month 12 are 
presented in this final clinical report. 
In the definition of the ATP cohort for safety, the criteria in the protocol “who have received at 
least one dose of study vaccine/control according to their random assignment” and “with 
sufficient data to perform an analysis of safety (at least one dose with safety follow-up)” were 
replaced by “subjects who have received three doses of study vaccine/control according to 
their random assignment”, to be in line with other HPV study protocols. 
In the eCRF, missing confirmed values for solicited symptoms on Day 0 to 6 following 
vaccination had to be recorded by default as “yes” in reply to the question “Has the subject 
experienced any of the following signs/symptoms at the administration site during the solicited 
period?” This resulted in an overestimation of the number of subjects with solicited symptoms 
reported. As a result, two separate analyses of solicited symptoms were performed, i.e. one on 
data including missing confirmed values and one on data excluding missing confirmed values. 
•  An additional analysis of solicited and unsolicited symptoms by age stratum (10-14 years and 
15-25 years) was performed for the Month 7 analysis.

2.2.  STUDY RESULTS 
A total of 676 subjects were enrolled and vaccinated in the study. Subjects were enrolled at two study 
centers in Senegal and Tanzania. Of the 676 subjects enrolled in the study, 450 subjects were enrolled 
in the HPV group and 226 subjects in the Control group. The number of subjects enrolled by center, 
per group and age strata is presented in Table 11. 
Of the 676 subjects enrolled and vaccinated in the study, 623 subjects completed the study. Fifty-three 
subjects were withdrawn from the study due to the following reasons (Table 12): 
Demographic characteristics 
The demographic characteristics of the ATP cohort for immunogenicity are summarized in Table 16.

Immunogenicity results 
Seropositivity to anti-HPV-16/18 at baseline, per group and age strata is presented in Table 20.  
Table 20 Seropositivity status at baseline per group and age strata (ATP cohort for immunogenicity) 
Anti-HPV-16/18 seropositivity rates and GMTs at Months 2 and 7 
An overview of the seropositivity rates and GMTs for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody titers by 
baseline serostatus per group and age strata is presented in Table 21 and Table 22, respectively. 
At Month 2, i.e. one month after the second dose of the study vaccine all initially seronegative subjects 
in the HPV group had seroconverted for anti-HPV-16 and anti- HPV-18 antibodies. Anti-HPV-16 and 
anti-HPV-18 antibody titers at Month 2 in initially seronegative subjects were approximately 1.5 fold 
higher in the 10-14 years age group than in the 15-25 years age group. 
An increase in GMTs was observed from the Month 2 to the Month 7 time points. Anti-HPV-16 and anti-
HPV-18 antibody titers at Month 7 in initially seronegative subjects were approximately 1.7 fold higher 
in the 10-14 years age group than in the 15-25 years age group. This is also demonstrated by the 
reverse cumulative distribution curves for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies, which are more to 
the right for subjects in the 10-14 years age group when compared to the 15-25 years age group 
(Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively).

Comparison of anti-HPV-16/18 titers at Month 7 by age stratum to those obtained in study HPV-012 
GMTs were compared to those observed in Study HPV-012 at Month 7 (Figure 3 and Figure 4). Study-
012 was a phase III, double-blind, randomized study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of 
Cervarix in females aged 10-25 years from various countries in Europe (Pedersen et al. J Adoles Health 
2007; 40: 564-571). GMTs observed in the current study are in the same range for subjects aged 10-
14 years as those observed in subjects of similar age in Study HPV-012. GMTs observed for anti-HPV-
16 antibodies for subjects aged 15-25 years were higher than those observed in Study HPV-012.

According-to-protocol analysis for Month 12 
Seropositivity status to anti-HPV-16/18 at baseline, per group and age strata is presented in Table 23. 
The anti-HPV-16/18 seropositivity status at baseline in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity Month 12 
was comparable to that observed in the ATP cohort for immunogenicity for Month 7.  
Anti-HPV-16/18 seropositivity rates and GMTs (Month 12) 
An overview of the seropositivity rates and GMTs for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody titers, by 
baseline serostatus per group and age strata is presented in Table 24 and Table 25, respectively. 
At Month 12, i.e. six months after completion of the three-dose vaccination course, all initially 
seronegative subjects in both the age strata remained seropositive for anti-HPV-16 antibodies and all 
except one subject remained seropositive for anti-HPV-18 antibodies. A decline in the anti-HPV-16 and 
anti-HPV-18 antibody titers was observed in initially seronegative subjects at Month 12 following a 
peak antibody response at Month 7. GMTs remained higher in the 10-14 years age group than in the 
15-25 years age group. This is also demonstrated by the reverse cumulative distribution curves for 
anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies (Assessor’s note: the RCC are not shown here).  
Anti-HPV-16 antibody titers at Month 12 in initially seronegative subjects were approximately 1.7 fold 
higher in the 10-14 years age group than in the 15-25 years age group. Anti-HPV-18 antibody titers at 
Month 12 in initially seronegative subjects were approximately 1.6 fold higher in the 10-14 years age 
group than in the 15-25 years age group.

Safety results 
Data sets analyzed 
The primary analysis of data up to Month 7 was based on the Total Vaccinated cohort. A second 
analysis based on the ATP cohort was performed to supplement the primary analysis. The analysis of 
data up to Month 12 was based on the Total Vaccinated cohort. A safety analysis was also performed 
on the Total Vaccinated cohort Month 12.  
Total Vaccinated cohort analysis 
Month 0 to Month 7 safety analysis on the Total Vaccinated cohort. 
The number and percentage of subjects who received the study vaccine doses per group is presented 
in Table 26. 
All subjects in the Total Vaccinated cohort had received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine or control. 
Majority (90.4%) of the subjects in both groups received 3 doses of the HPV vaccine or control. 
Overall incidence of adverse events 
Incidence and nature of symptoms (solicited only) reported during the 7-day (Days 0 - 6) post-
vaccination period following each dose and overall is presented in Table 27 (analysis included missing 
confirmed values).

Incidence and nature of symptoms (solicited and unsolicited) reported during the 30-day (Days 0 - 29) 
post-vaccination period following each dose and overall is presented in Table 28 (analysis included 
missing confirmed values). 
During the 30-day post-vaccination period, the incidence of any symptom (solicited and unsolicited) 
considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination was higher in the HPV group (following 
65.9% of doses) than in the Control group (following 51.6% of doses). 
The incidence of grade 3 symptoms (solicited and unsolicited) reported was low in both groups 
(following 0.6% of doses in the HPV group and following 0.2% of doses in the Control group). Two of 
the grade 3 symptoms (i.e. pain at the injection site) reported were considered by the investigator to 
be related to vaccination.

Solicited local adverse events 
The incidence of solicited local symptoms reported during the 7-day (Days 0 - 6) postvaccination 
period following each dose and overall is presented in Table 29. 
Only two doses (i.e. 0.2%) of the HPV vaccine were followed by grade 3 pain. Both these events were 
reported in the HPV group after the first vaccine dose. Swelling at the injection site (≤ 50.0 mm) was 
reported following 0.5% of the doses in the HPV group. None of these events were assessed as grade 3 
in intensity. There were no reports of swelling at the injection site in the Control group. None of the 
subjects reported urticaria/rash within 30 minutes of vaccination in either group.

Solicited general adverse events 
The incidence of solicited general symptoms reported during the 7-day (Days 0 - 6) postvaccination 
period following each dose and overall is shown in Table 30 and discussed below. 
The most frequently reported solicited general symptoms in both groups were headache and fever 
followed by gastrointestinal symptoms: 
•  Headache was reported by 33.3% and 38.9% of the subjects in the HPV and Control groups, 
respectively, following 14.7% and 17.0% of doses. Vaccine-related headache was reported by 
22.4% and 20.4% of the subjects following 8.7% and 8.6% of doses in the HPV and Control 
groups, respectively. 
• 
Fever was reported by 24.7% and 25.2% of the subjects in the HPV and Control groups, 
respectively, following 13.4% of doses in both groups. Vaccine-related fever was reported by 
12.7% and 11.9% of subjects following 5.6% and 5.3% of doses in the HPV and Control 
groups, respectively. 
•  Gastrointestinal symptoms were reported by 13.3% and 13.7% of the subjects in the HPV and 
Control groups, respectively, following 5.3% and 5.4% of doses. Vaccinerelated 
gastrointestinal symptoms were reported by 6.9% and 7.5% of subjects following 2.6% and 
3.0% of doses in the HPV and Control groups, respectively.  
Fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, rash and urticaria were reported less frequently in both groups (≤ 4.0% 
of the doses in the HPV group and ≤ 3.0 of the doses in the Control group). None of the solicited 
general symptoms were assessed as grade 3 in intensity.

Unsolicited adverse events 
Assessor’s  note:  a  global  summary  of  unsolicited  signs  and  symptoms  reported  within  the  30-day 
(Days 0-29) post-vaccination period is presented in Tables 31, 32 and 33 of the Clinical Study report, 
which  are  not  shown  here.  During  the  30-day  post-vaccination  period,  52.2%  and  62.8%  of  subjects 
reported at least one unsolicited symptom following 25.3% and 30.2% of doses in the HPV and Control 
groups, respectively (see Table 31).

Fatal events 
No fatal SAEs were reported during the active phase of the study (up to Month 7). 
Non-fatal events 
During the active phase of the study (i.e. up to Month 7) a total of 33 SAEs were reported by 22 
subjects (20 SAEs were reported by 12 subjects in the HPV group and 13 SAEs were reported by ten 
subjects in the Control group). None of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to 
vaccination. 
Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study vaccine and/or study 
None. 
Other significant adverse events 
Medically significant adverse events 
The percentage of subjects reporting at least one medically significant AE during the active phase of 
the study (up to Month 7) was similar in the two groups (64.2% of subjects in the HPV group and 
71.2% of subjects in the Control group). The most commonly reported medically significant AEs were 
malaria, headache and abdominal pain and were reported by a similar percentage of subjects in both 
groups.  
New Onset Chronic Diseases 
The percentage of subjects reporting at least one NOCD during the active phase of the study (up to 
month 7) was similar in the two groups (2.2% of subjects in the HPV group and 3.5% of subjects in 
the Control group). The most commonly reported NOCDs were eye pain in the HPV group and allergic 
conjunctivitis in the Control group, and were reported by 0.7% and 1.3% of the subjects, respectively. 
No NOCDs were reported based on the investigator’s assessment during the active phase of the study 
(up to Month 7). 
Concomitant medications /vaccinations 
The use of concomitant medication was similar in the two groups (following 43.0% of doses in the HPV 
group and following 42.5% of doses in the Control group). Antipyretic medication was administered 
following 29.1% of doses in the HPV group and 27.2% of doses in the Control group. Prophylactic 
antipyretic was administered to one subject (0.2%) in the Control group.

Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Mean values for hematology parameters (hematocrit, red and white blood cell counts, white blood cell 
differential counts), were similar in HPV and Control groups and no notable differences between pre-
vaccination and post-vaccination (Month 7) time-points were observed. 
Safety analysis stratified by age 
The incidence of solicited general symptoms reported during the 7-day post-vaccination period was 
lower in subjects aged 10-14 years (following 24.9% of doses in the HPV group) than in subjects aged 
15-25 years (following 40.7% of doses in the HPV group). The incidence of solicited local symptoms 
within 7 days post-vaccination was similar in both age groups. The incidence of solicited and 
unsolicited symptoms within the 30-day post-vaccination period were reported following 73.1% of 
doses in the HPV group in subjects aged 10-14 years and following 81.1% of doses in the HPV group in 
subjects aged 15-25 years. 
According-to-protocol cohort analysis 
Safety and reactogenicity data obtained from the analysis of the ATP cohort for safety were consistent 
with those obtained from the analysis of safety and reactogenicity on the Total Vaccinated cohort. 
Total Vaccinated cohort Month 12 analysis 
Month 7 to Month 12 safety analysis on the Total Vaccinated cohort Month 12: the results are 
comparable with those observed at Month 7. 
3.  DISCUSSION AND MAH’S OVERALL CONCLUSIONS 
(summary) 
The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate the antibody responses (by ELISA) against HPV-
16 and HPV-18 at Month 7, i.e., one month after completion of the three dose vaccination course, in 
two age strata consisting of subjects aged 15 - 25 years of age and subjects aged 10 -14 years of age. 
All initially seronegative subjects had seronconverted at Month 2 for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 
antibodies and remained seropositive for anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies up to Month 7. GMTs 
observed at Month 7 were 441-fold and 200-fold above those associated with natural infections for 
anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies respectively. As previously observed in another study, anti-
HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody titers at Month 7 were higher for subjects aged 10-14 years when 
compared to subjects aged 15-25 years of age. 
The GMT values observed for the two age strata at Month 7 in this study were compared with values 
reported in subjects of similar age and who received similar vaccine lots (Hi-5 Rix4446 vaccine 
formulation produced at industrial scale) in study HPV-012, a study evaluating the immunogenicity and 
safety of Cervarix in female subjects aged 10-25 years in a European setting. GMTs observed in study 
HPV-21 were similar to those observed in study HPV-012 for subjects aged 10-14 years. For subjects 
aged 15-25 years GMTs were similar (for anti-HPV-16 antibodies) or higher (for anti-HPV-18 
antibodies) than those observed in study HPV-012.

A secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the antibody responses (by ELISA) against HPV-16 
and HPV-18 at Month 12, six month after completion of the three-dose vaccination course, in both age 
strata. The persistence of antibodies against both HPV-16 and HPV-18 in this study followed the 
expected pattern, i.e. after a peak response at Month 7, a decline in antibody titers was observed at 
Month 12. At Month 12, all initially seronegative subjects in the HPV group remained seropositive for 
anti-HPV-16 antibodies and all except one subject remained seropositive for anti-HPV-18 antibodies. As 
was observed at the Month 7 time-point, anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody titers at Month 12 
were higher for subjects aged 10-14 years when compared to subjects aged 15-25 years of age. 
Overall, the reactogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine was similar in the HPV and Control groups, 
except for pain at the injection site for which a higher incidence was observed in the HPV group. Only 
two (first) doses of HPV vaccine were followed by grade 3 injection site pain. No impact on compliance 
for completion of the three-dose vaccination schedule was observed. No withdrawals due to AEs or 
SAEs were reported. A total of 50 non-fatal SAEs (mainly malaria) were reported by 31 subjects; none 
of these SAEs were considered by the investigator to be related to vaccination. No clinically significant 
abnormalities in biochemical and hematological parameters were observed at the Month 7 and Month 
12 time points in either group when compared to baseline values observed at Month 0. 
During the quarterly review of the safety data, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
supervising this study expressed that there were no serious safety concerns based on the safety data 
available. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that vaccination of adolescents and 
young women aged 10-25 years in Senegal and Tanzania with the HPV-16/18 L1 AS04 vaccine is 
highly immunogenic and generally well tolerated up to 12 months post the first vaccination dose.

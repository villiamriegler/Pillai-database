INTRODUCTION 
This  variation  concerns  an  extension  of  the  approved  indication  for  memantine  to  include  the 
treatment  of  moderate  to  moderately  severe  Alzheimer’s  disease  (AD).  Originally,  memantine  was 
approved in Europe for the treatment of moderately severe to severe AD. 
AD characteristics 
AD  is  a  chronic  illness  with  progressive  neurodegeneration  and  dementia.  The  cause  of  the  disease 
remains  unknown.  Its  diagnosis  is  an  exclusion  diagnosis  in  the  face  of  a  dementia  with  insidious 
onset, a gradual progression, and no sign of another cause of dementia. The neuropathology of AD is 
characterised  by  extensive  neuronal  cell  loss,  deposition  of  numerous  senile  plaques  and 
neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex.  
There  is  a  trend  for  the  prevalence  of  AD  to  increase  exponentially  with  age;  above  the  age  of  60 
years,  the  prevalence  approximately  doubles  with  every  4.5  years.  AD  has  been  estimated  to  affect 
approximately 1% of the population aged between 65 and 69 years, and up to more than 20% of those 
aged above 85 years. According to a recent study, the prevalence of AD in Europe in the year 2000 
was 4.7 million. 
AD is the most common form of dementia and is estimated to account for some 60 to 70% of cases. 
For some patients, AD progresses rapidly over the 2 to 3 years following diagnosis, but for most the 
decline  in  cognitive  and  functional  abilities  is  more  gradual  and  occurs  over  approximately  7 years. 
The  majority  of  patients  with  AD  are  in  the  mild  to  moderate  range  of  the  disease,  as  it  has  been 
estimated  that  approximately  one-third  of  patients  have  mild  AD,  one-third  have  moderate  AD,  and 
one-third have severe AD.  
AD current treatment 
The treatment of AD should ideally improve the global condition of the patient by seeking to: 
• 
• 
• 
improve or at least slow the loss of memory and cognition 
help maintain independent function 
control the behavioural symptoms associated with the disease 
At  present,  the  only  treatments  approved  in  Europe  for  mild  to  moderate  AD  are  three 
acetylcholinesterase  inhibitors  (AChEIs).  These  drugs  augment  cholinergic  neurotransmission,  since 
loss of acetylcholine occurs early and correlates with impairment of memory. 
Memantine acts on the glutamatergic system via antagonism of the NMDA receptor. It was approved 
in Europe in May 2002 and remains the only drug licensed in Europe for moderately severe to severe 
AD. 
Memantine properties 
Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter in cortical and hippocampal neurons. There is increasing 
evidence that disturbed glutamatergic neurotransmission could be involved in AD pathology, and this 
may occur already in the early stages of the disease. 
Anatomical and biochemical evidence suggests that there is both pre- and postsynaptic disruption of 
Excitatory  Amino  Acids  (EAA)  pathways  in  Alzheimer's  disease.  Dysfunction  of  EAA  pathways 
could play a role in the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease, such as memory loss and signs 
of  cortical  disconnection.  Furthermore,  EAA  might  be  involved  in  the  pathogenesis  of  Alzheimer's 
disease,  by  virtue  of  their  neurotoxic  (excitotoxic)  properties.  Circumstantial  evidence  raises  the 
possibility that the EAA system may partially determine the distribution of pathology in Alzheimer's 
disease and may be important in producing the neurofibrillary tangles, RNA reductions and dendritic 
changes which characterize this devastating disorder.

Memantine  can  interact  with  a  variety  of  ligand-gated  ion  channels.  However,  NMDA  receptors 
appear to be a key target of memantine at therapeutic concentrations. Blockade of NMDA receptors by 
memantine  could  theoretically  confer  disease-modifying  activity  in  AD  by  inhibiting  the  "weak" 
NMDA receptor-dependent excitotoxicity that has been hypothesized to play a role in the progressive 
neuronal  loss  that  underlies  the  evolving  dementia.  Moreover,  recent  in  vitro  studies  suggest  that 
inhibits  beta-amyloid  production. 
toxicity  and  possibly 
memantine  abrogates  beta-amyloid 
Considerable attention has focused on the investigation of theories to explain the better tolerability of 
memantine  over  other  NMDA  receptor  antagonists,  particularly  those  that  act  by  a  similar  channel 
blocking  mechanism  such  as  dissociative  anaesthetic-like  agents.  A  variety  of  channel-level  factors 
could  be  relevant,  including  fast  channel-blocking  kinetics  and  strong  voltage-dependence  (allowing 
rapid  relief  of  block  during  synaptic  activity),  as  well  as  reduced  trapping  (permitting  egress  from 
closed channels). These factors may allow memantine to block channel activity induced by low, tonic 
levels  of  glutamate,  an  action  that  might  contribute  to  symptomatic  improvement  and  could 
theoretically protect against weak excitotoxicity while sparing synaptic responses required for normal 
behavioural functioning, cognition and memory.

CLINICAL ASPECTS 
2.1  CLINICAL EFFICACY DATA 
The MAH applied for an extension of the indication to include the monotherapy treatment of patients 
with  mild  to  moderate  Alzheimer’s  disease.  The  basis  for  this  application  consisted  of  two  placebo 
controlled studies with comparable designs and similar populations.  
Both  studies  were  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  version  of  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  the 
principles of Good Clinical Practice applicable at the time. 
Main studies - Studies MD-10 and 99679 
Studies  MD-10  and  99679  were  multi-centre,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel-group,  placebo-
controlled, fixed-dose studies of essentially identical design (Table 1).

Both  studies  are  being  followed  by  long-term  open-label  extension  studies  that  are  investigating 
memantine treatment  over 2½ to  3 years (Studies  MD-11 and  99819, respectively). These  extension 
studies are currently ongoing. 
Design and Methods 
In  Study  MD-10,  there  was  a  1-  to  2-week  single-blind  placebo  run-in  period,  after  which  patients 
were  randomised  in  a  1:1  ratio  of  memantine  to  placebo  to  4  weeks  of  up-titration  followed  by  20 
weeks  of  double-blind  maintenance  treatment  with  memantine  20mg/day  (10mg  twice  daily)  or 
placebo.  In  Study  99679,  there  was  a  1-  to  2-week  screening  period,  after  which  patients  were 
randomised in a 2:1 ratio of memantine to placebo to 4 weeks of up-titration followed by 20 weeks of 
double-blind maintenance treatment with memantine 20mg/day (10 mg twice daily) or placebo.

Study population  
Both  studies  included  outpatients  of  either  sex,  aged  above  50  years,  with  a  primary  diagnosis  of 
probable  AD  using  National  Institute  of  Neurological  and  Communicative  Disorders  and  Stroke-
Alzheimer’s  Disease  and  Related  Disorders  Association  (NINCDS-ADRDA)  criteria.  Study  99679 
used DSM-IV-TR criteria for Dementia of the Alzheimer’s type as an additional diagnostic tool.  
Further  selection  criteria  included  a  Mini  Mental  State  Examination  (MMSE)  score  ≥10  and  ≤22 
(Study MD-10) or ≥11 and ≤23 (Study 99679), a Modified HIS ≤4, and the diagnosis of probable AD 
consistent  with  the  result  of  a  CT  or  MRI  performed  within  the  past  12  months.  Study  MD-10  also 
required  a  Montgomery-Åsberg  Depression  Rating  Scale  (MADRS)  score  <22  at  Screening.  Any 
patients who had previously been treated with AChEIs were to have stopped such treatment at least 30 
days prior to inclusion in the study. 
Outcome Measures 
The  primary  efficacy  variables  were  the  change  from  Baseline  to  Week  24  in  the  ADAS-cog  total 
score and the CIBIC-plus rating score.  
Secondary efficacy measures included:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
ADAS-cog total score by visit  
CIBIC-plus score by visit  
Mean change from baseline in ADCS-ADL score by visit 
Mean change from baseline in NPI score by visit  
Additional  analyses  were  performed  on  the  proportions  of  responders  (marked  improvement  in  the 
cognitive  domain  [ADAS-cog  improvement  ≥4]  and  improvement  or  stabilisation  in  the  global 
domain [CIBIC-plus ≤4]). 
Safety  evaluations  were  based  on  adverse  events,  clinical  safety  laboratory  tests,  ECGs,  vital  signs, 
and physical examinations. 
Clinical assessments were performed at Baseline and at Weeks 4, 12, 18, and 24. Study MD-10 had an 
additional clinical assessment at Week 8. 
Statistical analysis 
In Study MD-10, the primary efficacy analyses were performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, 
defined as all randomised patients who took at least one dose of double-blind study product and who 
had at least one valid post-baseline measurement of one of the primary efficacy parameters. The last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) approach for imputation of missing data was used in the primary 
analysis  of  the  efficacy  variables.  All  the  secondary  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  on  the  ITT 
population using both the LOCF and the observed case (OC) approach. 
In  Study  99679,  the  primary  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  on  the  completers  set  at  Week  24 
(CS24), defined as all patients in the full-analysis set (FAS) who took study product up to Week 24 
and  who  were  assessed  on  both  primary  efficacy  parameters  at  the  Week  24  visit.  The  FAS  was 
defined as all randomised patients who took at least one dose of double-blind study product and who 
had at least one valid post-baseline assessment of both primary efficacy parameters. All the secondary 
analyses were performed on the CS24, and on the FAS (LOCF and OC). 
In both studies, the analysis of ADAS-cog was based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with 
factors for treatment group and centre, and with the baseline score as a covariate. In Study MD-10, the 
primary analysis of CIBIC-plus was based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratifying by 
centre.  In  Study  99679,  the  primary  analysis  of  CIBIC-plus  was  based  on  an  ANCOVA.  The  same 
ANCOVA  model  was  used  for  all  analyses  of  change  from  baseline  to  Week  24  in  the  secondary 
efficacy parameters.

All  estimated  differences  between  memantine  and  placebo  were  based  on  least  square  mean  (LS 
mean) for changes from baseline. The proportions of responders were analysed by visit using Fisher’s 
exact test. 
Results 
Study MD-10 
The study was conducted in 42 sites in US from October 01 to July 03. A total of 403 patients were 
randomised to the two treatment groups: 201 to the memantine group and 202 to the placebo group. Of 
these, 332 (82%) patients completed the study: 165 (82%) in the memantine group and 167 (83%) in 
the placebo group. The most frequent reason for discontinuation was adverse event, reported by 5.0% 
of  placebo-treated  patients  and  9.5%  of  memantine-treated  patients.  The  ITT  population  comprised 
394 patients: 196 in the memantine group and 198 in the placebo group 
Approximately 40% of the patients were men and the mean age was 77.5 years [range: 51 to 95 years]. 
The  majority (91%) of the patients were Caucasian. The  mean baseline MMSE total score was 17.3 
[range:  10  to  24].  There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups  with 
respect to any of the demographic and baseline characteristics. 
Prior  use  of  anti-dementia  medications  was  similar  in  the  placebo-treated  and  memantine-treated 
groups (approximately 69% and 62%, respectively). Prior use of the AChEI medications used to treat 
dementia was similar in both the memantine-treated and  placebo-treated groups: donepezil (55%  vs. 
56%), rivastigmine (18% vs. 25%) and galantamine (14% vs.18%), respectively.  
The  mean  exposure  to  study  product  was  150  days  in  the  memantine  group  and  151  days  in  the 
placebo group. The overall mean daily dose for the memantine-treated group was 17.9 mg. 
ADAS-cog Total Score 
In the primary efficacy analysis, at Week 24, the mean change from baseline in the ADAS-cog total 
score was –0.8 for the memantine group, compared to 1.1 for the placebo group. The mean difference 
of  –1.9  between  the  two  groups  was  statistically  significant  in  favour  of  memantine  (p=0.003). 
Statistically significant differences in favour of memantine were also observed at Weeks 8, 12, and 18. 
Throughout the study, the memantine-treated patients showed improvement on the ADAS-cog, while 
after Week 4, the placebo-treated patients showed deterioration. 
The results of the secondary OC analysis resembled those of the LOCF analysis, although statistical 
significance  was  not  achieved  at  Week  24  (p=0.13).  There  were  71  patients  included  in  the  LOCF 
analysis of the ADAS-cog who were not included in the corresponding OC analysis. For this group, 
the  LS  mean  change  from  Baseline  in  the  ADAS-cog  was  -2.2  for  the  memantine-treated  group, 
compared  to  1.5  for  the  placebo-treated  group.  The  LS  mean  difference  of  -3.7  between  the  two 
groups  was  statistically  significant  in  favour  of  memantine  (p=0.044).  Thus,  a  greater  number  of 
memantine-treated  patients  were  improving  at  the  time  of  their  discontinuation  than  the  placebo-
treated patients (p=0.001).  
A  post  hoc  sensitivity  analysis,  using  the  mixed-model  repeated-measured  supported  the  LOCF 
analysis (p=0.013). 
CIBIC-plus Total Score 
The mean CIBIC-plus total score at Week 24 was 4.2 for memantine-treated patients compared to 4.5 
for  placebo-treated  patients.  This  difference  was  statistically  significant  (p=0.004)  in  favour  of 
memantine. 
The results of the secondary OC analysis at Week 24 were consistent with those of the LOCF analysis. 
The mean CIBIC-plus scores at Week 24 was 4.2 for memantine-treated patients compared to 4.5 for 
placebo-treated patients (p=0.030).  
5/16

Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
The  ADCS-ADL  (activities  of  daily  living)  showed  no  significant  difference  between  memantine 
treatment and placebo treatment. 
On  the  NPI  there  was  statistically  significant  benefit  of  memantine  treatment  compared  to  placebo 
treatment (p=0.035 at Week 12 and p=0.011 at Week 24, LOCF). 
Study 99679 
This clinical trial was conducted on 65 study sites in Europe from May 02 to September 03. A total of 
470 patients were randomised to the two treatment groups: 318 to the memantine group and 152 to the 
placebo group. Of these, 409 (87%) patients completed the study: 271 (85%) in the memantine group 
and 138 (91%) in the placebo group. The most common primary reasons for withdrawal was adverse 
events (9% in the memantine group versus 4% in the placebo group). 
Approximately 40% of the patients were men and the mean age was 73.4 years [range: 54 to 89 years]. 
All  the  patients  were  Caucasian.  There  was  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  the 
memantine and the placebo groups in any of the measured baseline values. The baseline MMSE scores 
indicate a population with mild to moderate AD with a somewhat skewed distribution towards those 
more mild patients. The mean baseline MMSE total score was 18.7 [range: 11 to 23] 
Regarding recent dementia medication taken by  memantine-treated  patients, 38% of the  memantine-
treated patients and 36% of the placebo-treated patients had been treated with an AChEI prior to being 
enrolled in the study. 
The  mean  exposure  to  study  product  was  156  days  in  the  memantine  group  and  162  days  in  the 
placebo group. 
ADAS-cog Total Score 
In the pre-defined primary analysis at Week 24, the difference favouring memantine over placebo was 
not statistically significant, although the memantine-treated patients had a mean improvement of 1.93 
points at Week 24 compared to their baseline ADAS-cog total score (CS24).  
Cognitive functioning, measured by the ADAS-cog total score, improved from baseline to Week 4 in 
both  treatment  groups.  From  Week  4,  the  treatment  groups  separated  and  the  patients  receiving 
memantine  were  statistically  significantly  better  than  those  receiving  placebo  at  Weeks  12  and  18 
(p<0.001 and p=0.016, respectively). 
Overall,  cognitive  functioning  in  the  placebo-treated  patients  did  not  deteriorate  as  expected  from 
previous trial data in this population; instead, the placebo-treated patients had an improved ADAS-cog 
total score at Week 24 compared to baseline. Similar results were found using the LOCF approach. 
CIBIC-plus Total Scores 
At the pre-defined primary analysis at Week 24, the difference favouring memantine over placebo was 
not  statistically  significant.  Memantine  separated  early  from  placebo  and  the  difference  was 
statistically significant in favour of memantine at Weeks 12 and 18 (p=0.033 at Week 12 and p=0.012 
at  Week 18).  In  the  memantine  group,  the  CIBIC-plus  scores  at  Week  24  were  slightly  improved 
relative to those at baseline. In the placebo group, the CIBIC-plus scores deteriorated from Weeks 4 to 
18  and  improved  unexpectedly  from  Weeks  18  to  24.  Similar  results  were  found  using  the  LOCF 
approach. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
On the secondary efficacy scales the ADCS-ADL and the NPI, no statistically significant differences 
between  memantine  and  placebo  were  seen.  The  baseline  level  of  behavioural  neuropsychiatric 
symptoms was low.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses) 
The similarity of the designs and conduct of Studies MD-10 and 99679 allowed the two studies to be 
pooled to increase the power of the analyses.  
In the pooled data set, the efficacy analyses were performed on the FAS. The pooled FAS comprised 
the ITT population from Study MD-10 and the FAS from Study 99679. All analyses were performed 
on both LOCF and OC. 
The pooled analysis of ADAS-cog was based on an ANCOVA and the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis 
test. The pooled analysis of CIBIC-plus was  based on an ANCOVA and CMH. The ANCOVA was 
performed  with  treatment  and  centre  as  factors,  and  the  relevant  baseline  score  as  a  covariate. 
Responder analyses were based on Fisher’s exact test. 
The  pooled  data  set  comprised  873  patients:  519  in  the  memantine  group  and  354  in  the  placebo 
group.  Of  these,  741  (85%)  patients  completed  the  studies:  436  (84%)  in  the  memantine  group  and 
305 (86%) in the placebo group. The FAS comprised 855 patients: 506 in the memantine group and 
349 in the placebo group. 
Approximately 40% of the patients were men and the mean age was 75.5 years [range: 51 to 95 years]. 
The majority (96%) of the patients were Caucasian. The mean baseline MMSE total score was 18.1. 
There was no statistically significant difference between the memantine and the placebo group in any 
of the measured baseline values. The mean exposure to study product was 154 days in the memantine 
group and 156 days in the placebo group. 
ADAS-cog Total Score 
Using parametric methods (ANCOVA), memantine was statistically significantly better than placebo 
from Week 12 onwards. At Week 24, the treatment difference to placebo was statistically significant 
in the LOCF (p=0.004) and OC analyses (p=0.049).  
CIBIC-plus Total Score 
The  treatment  difference  to  placebo  for  CIBIC-plus  was  also  statistically  significant  in  the  LOCF 
(p=0.022) and OC analyses (p=0.047) (ANCOVA). 
The  pooled  data  were  also  re-analysed  using  non-parametric  methods  (Kruskal-Wallis  and  CMH  on 
the ADAS-cog and CIBIC-plus, respectively) to verify the robustness and consistency of the results. 
Regardless  of  whether  parametric  or  non-parametric  methods  were  used,  statistically  significant 
separation of memantine from placebo at Weeks 12, 18 and 24 on both primary efficacy scales in the 
LOCF and OC analyses was demonstrated. 
Other Efficacy Analyses 
There was no statistically significant difference between memantine and placebo on the ADSC-ADL. 
In the pooled analysis, the  memantine group showed numerical improvement relative to the placebo 
group on the NPI at both Weeks 12 and 24 (LOCF), and the difference was statistically significant at 
Week  12  (p=0.03).  The  baseline  level  of  behavioural  neuropsychiatric  symptoms  was  low  in  both 
studies. 
Responder Analyses 
The proportion of memantine-treated patients who responded was statistically significantly superior to 
that of placebo-treated patients from  Week  12 onwards, based on the dual criterion with ADAS-cog 
and CIBIC-plus (ADAS-cog improvement ≥4 and CIBIC-plus ≤4) and on the single criterion (ADAS-
cog improvement ≥4 or CIBIC-plus ≤4). The results were similar for FAS, OC.

2.2 
EFFICACY ASSESSMENT 
Two  studies  (MD-10  and  99679)  in  which  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  Alzheimer’s  disease  had 
been enrolled formed the basis for efficacy of the initial variation application.  
The CHMP considered that the design of the studies, the qualification of the patients and the selected 
outcome  measures  fulfil  the  standard  requirements  of  the  disease  and  the  AD  guidelines.  However, 
when  the  clinical  trials  were  conducted  (from  2001  to  2003),  there  were  available  antidementia 
products  approved  for  the  same  population  that  memantine  is  focused  on.  The  MAH  stated  in  their 
application that there is no reference drug that consistently and to a large extent improves patients with 
AD.  However,  the  CHMP  considered  that  a  three-arm  design  including  an  active  comparator  and  a 
placebo arm could have been of value. 
Different  primary  efficacy  populations  were  considered  in  each  study.  In  Study  MD-10  the  primary 
efficacy  analyses  were  performed  on  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population,  defined  as  all  randomised 
patients who took at least one dose of double-blind study product and who had at least one valid post-
baseline measurement of one of the primary efficacy parameters. The last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) approach was used for imputation of missing data.  
In  Study  99679,  the  primary  efficacy  analyses  were  performed  on  the  completers  set  at  Week  24 
(CS24), defined as all patients in the full-analysis set (FAS) who took study product up to Week 24 
and  who  were  assessed  on  both  primary  efficacy  parameters  at  the  Week  24  visit.  The  FAS  was 
defined as all randomised patients who took at least one dose of double-blind study product and who 
had at least one valid post-baseline assessment of both primary efficacy parameters.  
The MAH provided an analysis in which the populations of both studies are pooled together in order 
“to  increase  the  power  of  the  analyses”.  For  Study  99679,  the  pooled  data  set  population  is  not  the 
same  as  the  primary  efficacy  population  considered  in  the  main  study  (CS24  for  primary  analysis, 
FAS for being pooled). In any case, neither of them represents a “true ITT population”. The MAH was 
requested to provide a new analysis based on more strict criteria including all randomised patients. 
In Study MD-10, for the ADAS-cog analysis, the difference in number of all randomised patients and 
the IIT population was 4 placebo and 5 memantine treated patients. The results of the corresponding 
efficacy  analyses  were  essentially  the  same,  and  both  results  were  statistically  significant.  For  the 
CIBIC-plus,  the  difference  between  all  randomised  patients  and  the  ITT  was  5  patients  in  each 
treatment  arms,  and  the  corresponding  efficacy  analyses  were  similar  and  statistically  significant  in 
favour of memantine. Also, in Study 99679 there were small differences in the number of patients in 
each treatment arm between the FAS (LOCF) and the all randomised patients, but these had negligible 
impact on the treatment differences and no impact on the statistical significances.  
The  CHMP  was  also  of  the  opinion  that  the  use  of  the  OC  without  imputation  of  missing  data  is 
usually  considered  as  a  conservative  approach  for  the  evaluation  of  the  efficacy  of  treatments  for 
degenerative diseases.  
The MAH clarified that in Study MD-10, the primary efficacy analysis was LOCF analysis of the ITT 
population. The MAH showed that there were no large differences in the withdrawal rates in the two 
arms of Study MD-10 (18% in the memantine group, 17% in the placebo group), nor in the pattern of 
withdrawals  over  time,  therefore  differential  withdrawal  would  not  be  an  influencing  factor  in  the 
LOCF analysis in Study MD-10. 
The  CHMP  acknowledge  that  since  the  dropouts  were  fairly  distributed  there  was  a  smaller  risk  of 
having a biased LOCF. 
Pre-treated AChEI patients were allowed to be enrolled in the studies. A carry over effect cannot be 
excluded  in  spite  of  the  pre-defined  30-day  washout  period.  Taking  into  account  the  post-treatment 
effect for some of the marketed AChEIs, the MAH was requested to provide some clarifications.  
The MAH provided information on the possible influence of the pre-treatment of the patients on the 
results.  The  time  interval  between  previous  treatment  and  study  treatment  was  equally  balanced 
between the placebo and memantine groups within both studies.

Thus, the influence of any potential carry-over effect should have been the same in the placebo and 
memantine groups. Moreover, the majority of the previously treated patients stopped AChEI treatment 
more than 2 months before enrolment in the memantine studies. 
In  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  of  Study  MD-10,  at  Week  24,  the  mean  difference  change  from 
baseline  between  the  two  groups  in  the  ADAS-cog  total  score  was  –1.9  (–0.8  for  the  memantine 
group, compared to 1.1 for the placebo group; p=0.003). Throughout the study, the memantine-treated 
patients  showed  improvement  on  the  ADAS-cog,  while  after  Week  4,  the  placebo-treated  patients 
showed deterioration. The results of the secondary OC analysis resembled those of the LOCF analysis, 
although statistical significance was not achieved at Week 24 (p=0.13). 
The mean CIBIC-plus total score at Week 24 was 4.2 for memantine-treated patients compared to 4.5 
for  placebo-treated  patients.  This  difference  was  statistically  significant  (p=0.004)  in  favour  of 
memantine.  The  results  of  the  secondary  OC  analysis  at  Week  24  were  consistent  with  those  of  the 
LOCF analysis. In summary, the study MD-10 was positive. There was a clinical response in the two 
primary  variables.  The  size  of  the  effect,  as  compared  to  the  placebo  effect  is,  however,  small  but 
apparently similar to that obtained with AChEIs.  
In Study 99679 the two  co-primary variables did  not reach  statistical significance at the  pre-defined 
primary analysis (CS24) at Week 24. At that point for cognitive functioning (ADAS-cog), the  mean 
change difference between groups was 0.85 in favour of memantine (p=0.156). For global functioning 
(CIBIC-plus), the difference in favour of memantine was 0.07 (p=0.523).  
The MAH proposed that the difference of memantine over placebo was smaller than expected because 
the response to placebo was higher than anticipated. From the data provided, the placebo behaves in a 
very atypical way. At Week 12, placebo patients stopped deteriorating and improved ADAS-cog in a 
way  that  would  be  even  compatible  with  concomitant  active  treatment.  The  MAH  was  asked  to 
provide evidence that concomitant active anti-dementia treatment has not occurred in the trial.  
The MAH investigated a number of different issues in order to try to understand the placebo response 
in Study 99679 (blinding, quality control of study product, vascular co-morbidity, previous treatment 
with AChEIs, concomitant treatment with potential anti-dementia drugs, predictive factors, treatment-
by-centre  interaction)  but  none  of  the  analyses  or  considerations  could  satisfactorily  explain  the 
unusual placebo response towards the end of the study. 
The main interest of this clinical development is focused on the efficacy of memantine in patients with 
mild  to  moderate  dementia.  Mean  baseline  MMSE  total  score  of  the  studies  reflects  a  moderate 
population. Study 99679 included a greater proportion of mild dementia patients than Study MD-10. 
Some post hoc analyses of the primary and pooled analyses suggested a better effect in patients with 
more severe AD and in patients who had previously used AChEIs. The MAH was asked to provide the 
baseline  characteristics  of  the  population  contained  in  the  pooled  data  set  and  its  distributions  and 
particularly an analysis of the effect of memantine on this mild population.  
The  MAH  provided  the  distribution  of  the  patients  enrolled  in  the  two  studies  according  to  the 
baseline severity. A total of  30% (n=58)  of patients in Study MD-10 and 50% (n=75) of patients  in 
Study  99679  receiving  placebo  were  mild  (identified  by  MMSE≥20).  Regarding  the  active  groups, 
36% (n=70) and 46.5% (n=144), respectively, of patients treated with memantine were mild.  
The MAH also provided a subgroup analysis on mild patients versus all patients and versus moderate 
patients in study MEM-MD-10. The treatment difference throughout the study was nearly similar in 
the  mild  patients  when  compared  to  all  patients,  both  for  ADAS-cog  and  CIBIC-plus.  These 
differences did  not reach statistical significance at endpoint due to the decreased  number  of patients 
included in this sub-analysis. 
The CHMP considered that this relevant subgroup was properly represented in the whole population 
involved  in  the  clinical  trials,  however,  patients  with  milder  forms  contribute  less  to  the  differences 
versus placebo than the patients with moderate disease.

EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To  further  illustrate  the  clinical  relevance  of  memantine’s  effects,  the  MAH  provided  responder 
analyses.  Considering  Studies MD-10  and  99679  individually,  neither  were  deliberately  designed 
(powered) to show a statistically significant difference with regards to responder analyses.  However, 
in both studies statistically significant differences were observed at various time points using a dual-
responder criterion (an improvement of 4 points or more in ADAS-cog total score and improvement or 
stabilisation  in  CIBIC-plus  (CIBIC-plus  ≤4  points).    In  Study  MD-10,  statistically  significant 
differences were observed at Weeks 8, 12, and 18. In Study 99679, statistically significant differences 
were observed at Weeks 12 and 18.  
In the pooled analysis, the memantine group had statistically significant more responders at endpoint 
(Week 24). Furthermore, statistical significance was achieved at Weeks 12 and 18.  This demonstrates 
the overall benefit of the effect seen on the primary endpoints. 
In  addition,  the  CHMP  requested  a  responder  analysis  taking  the  ADAS-cog,  CIBIC-plus  and  ADL 
into account. The MAH  performed  a responder analysis defined  as at least  4 points improvement in 
ADAS-cog  and  improvement  or  stabilisation  in  CIBIC-plus  or  ADCS-ADL  score.  In  the  pooled 
analysis,  the  memantine  group  had  statistically  significantly  more  responders  at  both  Weeks 12  and 
24. 
Meta analysis on all phase III, placebo controlled, 6-month studies 
The  CHMP  requested  additional  studies  within  the  target  population  to  be  submitted.  Therefore  the 
MAH included meta-analyses and responder analyses conducted on all phase III, placebo-controlled, 
6-months studies with memantine in mild to severe AD (see Table 2).

b  All Patients Treated Set 
The  MAH  acknowledged  the  CHMP’s  concern  that  the  treatment  effect  was  smaller  in  the  milder 
patients  and  proposed  to  restrict  the  applied-for  indication  to  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  AD 
(baseline MMSE score of ≤19). This extends the current indication less than originally intended by the 
MAH.  The  MAH  provided  additional  data  (a  meta-analyses  and  a  responders  analysis)  that 
documented the beneficial effect of memantine in this population: 
10/16 
EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The  meta-analyses  on  the  efficacy  endpoints  showed  statistically  significant  and  clinically 
relevant  effects  of  memantine  compared  to  placebo  on  the  cognitive  (p<0.001),  global 
(p<0.001), and functional domains (p<0.01)(LOCF and OC), with effect sizes in the same range 
as AChEIs 
The  triple  responder  analyses  were  performed  based  on  definitions  that  identified  patients 
whose condition concurrently worsened in all three domains during the 6-month treatment: 
- 
- 
Marked Clinical  Worsening – a decline of ≥4  points on the ADAS-cog or ≥5 points on 
the SIB and a decline on the CIBIC-plus and a decline on the ADL 
Any Clinical Worsening – any decline on the ADAS-cog or on the SIB and any decline 
on the CIBIC-plus and any decline on the ADL 
In patients identified with concurrent worsening in all three domains, memantine had a statistically 
significant effect in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated patients as memantine-
treated patients showed marked clinical worsening in all three domains (21% vs. 11%, p<0.0001). 
The analyses of Any Clinical Worsening showed similar results and the analyses were statistically 
significant using both OC and LOCF. 
The CHMP considered that the additional data supported the new proposed modified indication. The 
wording is also consistent with that of the approved indication in other regions (US).  
2.3  CLINICAL SAFETY 
The safety evaluation of memantine in the treatment of mild to severe AD was based on data from six 
6-month,  placebo-controlled  clinical 
in 
institutionalised patients with severe AD or VaD and two 6-month, placebo-controlled studies in mild 
to moderate Vascular Dementia. These data were supported by 28-week interim safety results from the 
ongoing,  open-label,  long-term  Study  99819  (extension  of  Study  99679),  with  a  cut-off  date  of  31 
December  2003,  which  includes  1-year  exposure  data  in  mild  to  moderate  AD.  A  total  of  1784 
patients were exposed to memantine in the placebo-controlled studies, and 159 mild to moderate AD 
patients were included, who had been exposed to memantine for 1 year.  
studies,  one  3-month,  placebo-controlled 
study 
Study MD-11 is an ongoing long-term (132-week) extension of Study MD-10. An interim analysis of 
this study has not been performed and, therefore, only essential information (recruitment, deaths, and 
other serious adverse events (SAEs) are provided in this summary. 
Safety Analysis Data Sets 
• 
• 
• 
The populations that were used for the safety analyses are defined below.  
• 
Current  SPC  Population,  comprises  the  patients  with  moderately  severe  to  severe  dementia 
(MMSE score <15), from placebo-controlled Studies 9202, 9403, 9408, and 9605.  
Overall  Safety  Population.  To  allow  an  overall  evaluation  of  Treatment-Emergent  Adverse 
Events  (TEAEs),  the  data  from  the  all  placebo-controlled  AD  and  VaD  studies  have  been 
merged to form the overall safety population. All patients who took at least one dose of double-
blind study product (the all patients treated set, APTS) were included in this population. 
Study  99819  Interim  Safety  Population,  includes  interim  safety  data  from  Study  99819  for 
patients  who,  as  of  31  December  2003,  had  either  completed  the  Week  28  visit  or  had 
withdrawn from study. For patients who as of the cut-off date had completed the Week 28 visit, 
data for the first 28 weeks of open-label treatment are included.  
One-year Exposure Safety Population. The one-year exposure safety population includes safety 
data from Studies 99679 and 99819 for all  patients who  had been treated  with  memantine for 
1 year as of the cut-off date of 31 December 2003. In the analysis based on this population, the 
start of Study 99679 has been used as the baseline. 
11/16 
EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  3379  patients  with  mild  to  severe  dementia,  were  included  in  this  analysis.  In  the  overall 
safety population, 1784 patients received memantine and the total exposure was 749 years and mean 
exposure  was  154 days.  In  the  Study  99819  interim  safety  population  (with  a  cut-off  date  of  31 
December 2003), 273 of the 353 enrolled patients were included, 92 of whom had been treated with 
placebo  in  Study  99679.  As  of  31  December  2003,  a  total  of  159  patients  had  been  treated  with 
memantine for 1 year (from Studies 99679 and 99819). 
In Study MD-11, as of 31 March 2004, 314 patients had been randomised and treated with memantine 
for an additional 28 weeks, 236 of whom had continued treatment with memantine for another year, 
34 of whom had continued treatment with memantine for a third year. 
Adverse events 
Treatment-emergent Adverse Events  
Overall Safety Population 
Approximately 70% of the patients had TEAEs and the proportion of memantine-treated patients with 
TEAEs  was  similar  to  that  of  placebo-treated  patients.  The  proportion  of  patients  in  the  memantine 
group who had at least one SAE was slightly lower in the memantine group than that in the placebo 
group  (12.7%  versus  13.8%).  The  incidence  of  withdrawal  due  to  adverse  events  was  low  and  the 
same in both treatment groups (10%). 
TEAEs with an incidence ≥4% in any treatment group are presented in Table 4. Only small differences 
between treatment groups were observed.

Overall Safety Population 
During  double-blind  treatment  or  within  30  days  after  the  last  dose,  48  of  the  1784  patients  treated 
with memantine and 45 of the 1595 patients treated with placebo died.  
The causes of death were not different from what can be expected in an elderly population and were of 
a cardiovascular or respiratory nature. In both treatment groups, all SAEs that resulted in death were 
considered not related to study product by the investigator. 
Study 99819 
As  of  15  May  2004  (the  cut-off  date  for  the  most  recent  PSUR),  7  of  the  353  patients  in  ongoing 
extension Study 99819 had died during open-label treatment or within 30 days after the last dose. Two 
patients  died more than 30 days after their last  dose of study product. The causes of death were not 
12/16 
EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different from what can be expected in an elderly population and were typically of a cardiovascular, 
respiratory,  or  cancer-related  nature.  All  SAEs  that  resulted  in  death  were  considered  not  related  to 
study product by the investigator. 
Study MD-11 
As of 31 March 2004, 17 of the 314 patients in ongoing long-term extension Study MD-11 had died. 
All  SAEs  that  resulted  in  death  were  considered  not  related  to  study  product  by  the  investigator. 
Except for deaths caused by AD, the pattern of SAEs that resulted in death in this ongoing extension 
study was not different from that in the completed, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in mild to 
moderate AD. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Overall Safety Population 
A  total  of  226  (12.7%)  memantine-treated  patients  and  220  (13.8%)  placebo-treated  patients  in  the 
overall  safety  population  had  at  least  one  SAE  (including  deaths)  during  double-blind  treatment  or 
within 30 days after the last dose.  
Overall,  the  pattern  and  incidences  of  SAEs  in  the  two  treatment  groups  were  similar.  No  signal  of 
concern could be detected in the nature or incidence of the SAEs; they were in line with the expected 
morbidity for an elderly population with AD. The majority of the SAEs in both treatment groups were 
considered not related to study product by the investigator. 
Study 99819 Interim Safety Population 
As of 31 December 2003, 21 (8%) patients in the Study 99819 interim safety population had at least 
one SAE (including deaths). The most common SAE was accidental injury (4 patients (1.5%)). In the 
one-year exposure safety population from Studies 99679 and 99819, 9 (5.7%) of the 159 patients had 
at least one SAE. Except for agitation (2 patients), no SAEs in this population were reported by more 
than one patient. In both interim populations, the majority of the SAEs were considered not related to 
study product by the investigator. As of 15 May 2004 (the cut-off date for the most recent PSUR), a 
further 21 SAEs had been reported in Study 99819. Overall, the nature and incidence of these SAEs 
were similar to those reported in the interim analysis of the study and in the completed, double blind, 
placebo-controlled studies in mild to moderate AD. 
Study MD-11 
As of 31 March 2004, 78 of the 314 patients in ongoing Study MD-11 had SAEs. Overall, the nature 
and incidence of these SAEs were similar to those reported in the completed, double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies in mild to moderate AD. 
Withdrawals due to adverse events 
Overall Safety Population 
The incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 10% in both treatment groups, 175 patients in 
the memantine group and 159 patients in the placebo group. Not unexpectedly, given the population 
and the overall adverse event profile, psychiatric disorders and central and peripheral nervous system 
disorders were the system organ classes that had the highest overall incidences of adverse events that 
led to withdrawal in the memantine group.  
Study 99819 Interim Safety Population 
As of 31 December 2003, only few patients (20 patients (7%)) had withdrawn due to adverse events 
and the overall rate of withdrawal as well as the rate of withdrawal due to adverse events for patients 
who  had  been  treated  with  placebo  in  the  lead-in  study  (PBO-MEM  group)  was  similar  to  that  for 
patients who had been treated with memantine in the lead-in study (MEM-MEM group). Also in this 
population, central and peripheral nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders were the system 
organ classes that had the highest overall incidences of adverse events that led to withdrawal. No clear 
difference in the time to withdrawal due to adverse events between the two treatment sequence groups 
was seen. No single adverse event led to the withdrawal of  more than 2 patients. In the PBO-MEM 
group, dizziness, headache, and nausea each led to the withdrawal of 2 patients; none of the patients in 
13/16 
EMEA 2006 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  MEM-MEM  group  withdrew  due  to  these  adverse  events.  Vertigo,  agitation,  and  rash  each 
resulted in the withdrawal of one patient in each treatment sequence group. 
Withdrawal Reactions and Abuse Potential 
There  are  no  data  that  indicate  that  discontinuation  of  memantine  treatment  is  associated  with 
withdrawal  symptoms;  however,  this  issue  has  not  been  systematically  evaluated.  No  cases  of 
memantine abuse have been reported. 
Over dosage 
In  the  studies  of  memantine  in  the  treatment  of  mild  to  moderate  AD,  there  was  one  overdose.  A 
73 year  old  woman  in  Study  99819  was  hospitalised  with  confusion  and  drowsiness  following  an 
overdose  of  carbamazepine  (blood  level  17.4mg/L  (normal  therapeutic  range  5-10mg/L))  and 
memantine (100mg). The patient recovered. Overall, the experience with over dosage is limited.  
Psychiatric symptoms 
NMDA  receptor  hypofunction  has  been  associated  with  psychiatric  symptoms,  and  these  adverse 
events (such as hallucinations) deserve special attention. Hallucinations may be caused by memantine 
in the moderately severe and severe AD population, but not in the less severely affected population. 
The  MAH  was  requested  to  specify  the  severity  of  AD  patients  who  reported  hallucinations  and 
provide a summary of reports from post marketing surveillance. 
Clinical Trial Data 
In  the  pooled  population  of  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  AD  from  Studies  MD-10,  MD-12  and 
99679  the  incidence  of  adverse  event  reporting  for  hallucination  was  lower  in  the  memantine  group 
(6 patients;  0.8%)  than  in  the  placebo  group  (15  patients;  2.6%).  In  the  Current  SPC  population  of 
patients  with  moderately  severe  to  severe  dementia  the  incidence  of  hallucination  was  higher  in  the 
memantine group (12 patients; 4.1%) than in the placebo group (5 patients; 1.7%). In the overall safety 
population,  which  comprises  all  the  adverse  event  data  from  both  these  populations,  the  overall 
incidence of hallucination was 1.9% (34 patients) in the memantine group and 2.2% (35 patients) in 
the placebo group. The incidence of other psychotic-like TEAEs, including delusions, delirium, manic 
reaction,  psychosis,  paranoid  reaction  and  paroniria  was  higher  in  the  placebo  group  than  in  the 
memantine group. Only personality disorder (12 patients, 0.7% on memantine versus 5 patients, 0.3% 
on  placebo)  and  depersonalisation  (2  patients,  0.1%  on  memantine  versus  0  on  placebo)  were  more 
frequently  reported  in  the  memantine  group  than  in  the  placebo  group.  However,  the  overall 
frequencies are very low. 
Post-marketing Data  
From 5-Dec-2001 to 31-Dec-2004 a total of 40 spontaneous reports of hallucinations were received. 
Of  these  reports,  17  were  serious  and  23  were  non-serious.  The  daily  dose  of  memantine  for  the 
reported  cases  ranged  from  5  to  20  mg  and  the  treatment  duration  until  onset  of  symptoms  varied 
greatly. 
Of the 17 patients who had hallucination reported as a serious adverse drug reaction, 7 had a history of 
hallucinations and/or delusions; 1 patient had developed these symptoms during previous memantine 
treatment, 5 received other drugs or were suffering from other diseases that may have contributed to 
the  occurrence  of  the  event,  1  had  a  thrombotic  stroke  and  the  thrombus  was  surgically  removed 
coinciding with discontinuation of memantine and 4 had no confounding factors identified  
The  outcome  of  the  17  cases  of  hallucinations  reported  as  a  serious  ADR  was:  2  died,  1  recovered 
although  memantine  was  continued,  6  recovered  after  memantine  had  been  stopped  or  reduced;  
1 showed the same symptoms again after re-challenge; in 1, hallucinations worsened when ibuprofen 
was added to therapy, and improved again after ibuprofen was stopped, but before discontinuation of 
memantine  treatment;  in  the  1  patient  with  thrombotic  stroke,  all  symptoms  resolved  after  surgery 
(memantine  was  stopped  because  of  the  surgery);  1  was  recovering  after  discontinuation  of 
memantine; 1 recovered after discontinuation of memantine and 4 were of unknown outcome.

Summary 
In the mild to moderate AD studies, the incidence of hallucinations is lower in patients on memantine 
(0.8%) than in patients on placebo (2.6%). The incidence of hallucinations as an adverse event in the 
overall  safety  population  was  also  lower  with  memantine  (1.9%)  than  with  placebo  (2.2%). 
Furthermore,  the  spontaneous  reporting  of  hallucinations  in  post-marketing  monitoring  is  low. 
However, it cannot be excluded that memantine may cause or aggravate hallucinations in patients with 
severe  Alzheimer’s  disease.  Patients  in  these  stages  of  the  disease  may  also  be  more  susceptible  to 
pharmacodynamic effects of drugs. Therefore, hallucination was retained in the SPC as an uncommon 
ADR for patients with severe AD, under 4.8 Undesirable Effects.  
2.4  SAFETY EVALUATION 
The safety profile observed in the moderate to severe AD population did not differ substantially from 
that seen in the current SPC population. TEAEs with incidence on memantine of 1% or more above 
the placebo incidence were considered to be Adverse Drug Reactions and are included in the product 
information  of  memantine.  The  pooled  placebo-controlled  data  suggest  that  headache,  somnolence, 
constipation  and  dizziness  are  common  adverse  drug  reactions  to  memantine.  Fatigue,  confusion, 
hallucinations in severe AD patients, vomiting and gait abnormal are listed as uncommon ADRs and 
seizures  as  a  very  rare  ADR.  Somnolence  and  constipation  are  new  common  adverse  reactions  as 
compared to the current SPC. 
The CHMP agreed with the proposed amendments to the current SPC including data from the mild to 
moderate AD population as well as those data from the post-marketing experience.

Section 4.8 
Undesirable effects 
In clinical trials in mild to severe dementia, involving 1784 patients treated with memantine and 1595 
patients  treated  with  placebo, the  overall  incidence  rate  of  adverse  events  with  memantine  did  not 
differ from those with placebo; the adverse events were usually mild to moderate in severity. The most 
frequently  occurring  adverse  events  with  a  higher  incidence  in  the  memantine  group  than  in  the 
placebo  group  were  dizziness  (6.3%  vs  5.6%,  respectively),  headache  (5.2%  vs  3.9%),  constipation 
(4.6% vs 2.6%) and somnolence (3.4% vs 2.2%). 
The following Adverse Drug Reactions listed in the Table below have been accumulated in clinical 
studies with memantine and since its introduction in the market.

*Hallucination has mainly been observed in patients with severe Alzheimer´s disease.  
Section 4.9 
Overdose 
There have been very few cases of overdose. 
In the case of overdosage (a suicide attempt) for which the highest memantine dose has been reported, 
the  patient  survived  the  oral  intake  of  up  to  400 mg  memantine  with  effects  on  the  central  nervous 
system  (that  is,  restlessness,  psychosis,  visual  hallucinations,  proconvulsiveness,  somnolence,  stupor, 
and unconsciousness) that resolved without permanent sequelae.

Pharmacodynamic properties 
Clinical studies 
A  pivotal  monotherapy  study  in  a  population  of  patients  suffering  from  moderate  to  severe 
Alzheimer’s disease (MMSE total scores at baseline of 3 - 14) included a total of 252 outpatients. The 
study  showed  beneficial  effects  of  memantine  treatment  in  comparison  to  placebo  at  6  months 
(observed cases analysis for CIBIC-plus: p=0.025; ADCS-ADLsev: p=0.003; SIB: p=0.002). 
A pivotal monotherapy study of memantine in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease 
(MMSE  total  scores  at  baseline  of  10  to  22)  included  403  patients.    Memantine-treated  patients 
showed a statistically significantly better effect than placebo-treated patients on the primary endpoints: 
ADAS-cog (p=0.003) and CIBIC-plus (p=0.004) at Week 24 (LOCF). In another monotherapy study 
in mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease a total of 470 patients (MMSE total scores at baseline of 11-
23)  were  randomised.  In  the  prospectively  defined  primary  analysis  statistical  significance  was  not 
reached at the primary efficacy endpoint at week 24. 
A  meta-analysis  of  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  Alzheimer’s  disease  (MMSE  total  scores  < 20) 
from the six phase III, placebo-controlled, 6-month studies (including monotherapy studies and studies 
with patients on a stable dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) showed that there was a statistically 
significant effect in favour of memantine treatment for the cognitive, global, and functional domains. 
When  patients  were  identified  with  concurrent  worsening  in  all  three  domains,  results  showed  a 
statistically significant effect of memantine in preventing worsening, as twice as many placebo-treated 
patients  as  memantine-treated  patients  showed  worsening  in  all  three  domains  (21%  vs.  11%, 
p<0.0001). 
The  package  leaflet  has  been  amended  accordingly.  In  addition,  minor  linguistic  changes  were 
introduced in Annex I and IIIB. The CHMP agreed with all the changes proposed by the MAH.

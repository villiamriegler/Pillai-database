Summary of Risk Management Plan for Vumerity™ (diroximel 
fumarate) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Vumerity. The RMP details important 
risks of Vumerity, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about the risks and uncertainties (missing information) of Vumerity. 
Controlled pharmacokinetic studies have identified treatment regimens for Vumerity and 
Tecfidera that result in comparable exposure levels of the same active metabolite, monomethyl 
fumarate (MMF). Therefore, the established Tecfidera safety data relevant to Vumerity are used 
to further understand the risks associated with Vumerity. 
The Vumerity Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and Patient Leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Vumerity should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Vumerity should be read in the context of all available relevant 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, 
all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new safety concerns or changes to the current described safety concerns will be 
included in updates of the RMP for Vumerity.  
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Vumerity is indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis 
(RRMS) [see SmPC for the full indication]. It contains diroximel fumarate (DRF) as the active 
substance, and it is given orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of the benefits of Vumerity can be found in the EPAR 
for Vumerity, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of Vumerity, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Vumerity’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be as follows: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
PL and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals, respectively; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; and 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
 
 
 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including the Periodic Safety Update Report assessment (after approval) so 
that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Vumerity is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Vumerity are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be categorised as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Vumerity. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that needs to be collected (e.g., on the 
long-term use of the medicine):

Summary of important risks 
This section presents a summary of important identified risks, important potential risks and 
missing information. See Section II.C of this summary for an overview of the postauthorisation 
development plan. 
 
 
 
Important identified risks 
PML 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Similar to Tecfidera, Vumerity has the potential to lower lymphocyte 
counts, and lymphopenia is a known risk factor for infections, including 
opportunistic infections. PML has occurred in the setting of 
lymphopenia (< 0.91 × 109/L) after Tecfidera administration. 
PML case definitions (which categorise cases into Level 1 to Level 5) 
allow classification of cases based on varying levels of diagnostic 
certainty, ranging from the highest to lowest. It outlines specific criteria 
for ruled-out cases (Level 5) as well as high- and low-suspect cases 
(Levels 2 and 3, respectively) and includes a category for cases with 
insufficient data despite exhaustive due diligence (Level 4). 
This adjudication process has been used to identify confirmed PML 
cases (Level 1) in association with Tecfidera use (and other products 
containing fumaric acid esters) in the setting of lymphopenia 
(< 0.91 × 109/L). Consequently, PML is an important identified risk for 
Vumerity and wording relating to the detection and management of PML 
is included in the Vumerity SmPC (Section 4.4 [Special warnings and 
precautions for use]). 
Risk factors and risk groups  PML can only occur in the presence of a John Cunningham virus (JCV) 
infection, with studies indicating that approximately 60% to 70% of 
multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were seropositive when screened for 
anti-JCV antibody [Olsson 2013]. Whilst patients who are anti-JCV 
antibody positive are at greater risk for developing PML than the overall 
population of MS patients, those who are anti-JCV antibody negative 
may still be at risk of PML for reasons such as a new JCV infection, 
fluctuating antibody status, or a false negative test result. 
There are several well-recognised risk factors for PML, such as 
immunosuppression, use of natalizumab, and a decrease in lymphocyte 
count. Furthermore, some patient populations have a higher risk of 
developing PML, including those with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV); those with malignancies (including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [CLL]); those diagnosed with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sarcoidosis, or autoimmune 
vasculitis; and those undergoing bone marrow transplantation.  
With regard to Tecfidera, the finding common to all confirmed cases of 
PML reported to date has been the presence of lymphopenia 
(< 0.91 × 109/L), with the majority of confirmed cases of PML occurring 
in the setting of moderate to severe lymphopenia for longer than 6 
months’ duration. Therefore, in Tecfidera- and Vumerity-treated 
patients, lymphopenia is considered a risk factor. 
Information from studies evaluating lymphopenia associated with 
Tecfidera treatment have shown that absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) 
was highly correlated with total, cluster of differentiation (CD)4+, and 
CD8+ T cells, highlighting the effectiveness of the regular monitoring of 
lymphocyte counts in identifying patients at risk of developing 
lymphopenia. 
 
 
 
Important identified risks 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Additional factors that might contribute to an increased risk for PML in 
the setting of lymphopenia are duration of Tecfidera therapy (cases of 
PML have occurred after approximately 1 to 5 years of treatment, 
although the exact relationship with duration of treatment is unknown); 
profound decreases in CD4+ and especially in CD8+ T cell counts, 
which are important for immunological defence; and prior 
immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy.  
Additionally, the majority of PML cases in the postmarketing setting 
have occurred in patients >50 years of age.

Decreases in leukocyte and lymphocyte counts 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
In Study ALK8700-A301, 9.2% of participants experienced lymphocyte 
counts < 0.5 × 109/L (lower limit of normal [LLN] 0.91 × 109/L) and 
participants with lymphocyte counts of < 0.5 × 109/L for 4 weeks were 
discontinued from the study as per protocol. 
AEs associated with lymphopenia, which includes lymphopenia, 
decreased lymphocyte count, and leukopenia, were experienced by 
17.7% of participants. AESIs relevant to lymphocytes (lymphopenia, 
lymphocyte count decreased, and lymphocyte percentage decreased) 
were experienced by 15.4% of participants 
Overall, lymphopenia AEs resulted in treatment discontinuation in 
22 participants (14 participants because of lymphopenia [1.3%], 
7 participants because of lymphocyte count decreased [0.7%], and 
1 participant because of leukopenia [< 0.1%]). No serious adverse events 
(SAEs) of lymphopenia, lymphocyte count decreased, or lymphocyte 
percentage decreased were experienced during study treatment, and most 
AEs were mild or moderate in severity. 
The incidence of the first occurrence of lymphopenia was highest 
between 3 and 6 months of treatment and between 12 and 18 months of 
treatment (4.0% and 4.3%, respectively). Most participants continued in 
the study; 71.8% of lymphopenia AEs and 56.5% of lymphocyte count 
decreased AEs resolved. 
The findings observed in the development programme with Vumerity 
are consistent with those for Tecfidera. Consequently, leukopenia and 
lymphopenia were added as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in Section 
4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the Vumerity SmPC, and requirements for 
regular monitoring of complete blood counts (CBCs), including 
 
 
 
Important identified risks 
lymphocytes, were included in Section 4.4 (Special warnings and 
precautions for use). 
Risk factors and risk groups  Analyses of clinical trial data from participants treated with Tecfidera 
suggest that the majority of the participants in this subpopulation who 
are at risk for developing lymphopenia tended to present early with 
lymphocyte counts < 0.5 × 109/L, specifically within the first 6 to 
12 months of Tecfidera treatment.

Observational study (Tecfidera Study 109MS401). 
Overall, in the Vumerity Study ALK8700-A301, the incidence of 
treatment-emergent AEs in the liver injury category was experienced by 
7.5% of participants, in whom the majority of those AEs resolved 
(84.8% of participants). The incidence of these AEs occurred more 
prominently during the first 2 months of treatment (median: 31 days), 
and most liver injury events were mild or moderate in severity. The most 
common AESI in this category was alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
increased, which was experienced by 5.6% of participants.  
There were 2 SAEs in the category of elevated liver transaminases, both 
reversible. One resulted in treatment discontinuation.  
None of the participants receiving Vumerity had values meeting Hy’s 
law criteria (total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN and ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN). 
In Tecfidera placebo-controlled studies, elevations of ALT and AST 
were observed. The majority of participants with elevations had 
elevations < 3 times the ULN. Elevations of ALT and AST ≥ 3 times the 
ULN, respectively, were seen in 5% and 2% of participants treated with 
placebo and 6% and 2% of participants treated with Tecfidera. 
Elevations in transaminases ≥ 3 times the ULN with concomitant 
elevations in total bilirubin > 2 times the ULN were not observed in 
placebo-controlled studies. Nevertheless, increases in liver enzymes and 
cases of DILI consistent with Hy’s law have been reported during 
postmarketing experience after Tecfidera administration; these have 
resolved upon treatment discontinuation.

Serious and opportunistic infections (other than PML and herpes zoster) 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Cumulatively, in Vumerity studies, 9 SAEs have been reported in the 
Infections and infestations category (all in Study ALK8700-A301), none 
of which were classified as opportunistic infections. All but one of the 
events was assessed as unrelated to Vumerity. These SAEs included 
appendicitis (2), cellulitis, pharyngitis, pneumonia, pneumonia bacterial 
(fatal), pharyngeal abscess, sepsis, and urinary tract infection. The event 
of pharyngitis was assessed as possibly related to study drug by the 
Investigator. One participant in Study ALK8700-A301 discontinued due 
to a serious infection, pneumonia bacterial, which was fatal.   
Tecfidera has been associated with a risk of severe prolonged 
lymphopenia in approximately 2% of the pivotal clinical trial population 
(Study 109MS303), which could theoretically lead to an increased risk 
of serious and opportunistic infection. 
However, the incidence of serious infections (excluding PML and herpes 
zoster) is similar in participants treated with placebo versus those treated 
with Tecfidera. Therefore, excluding PML infection and herpes zoster, 
no evidence of an increased risk of other serious or opportunistic 
infections has been demonstrated.

Observational study (Tecfidera Study 109MS401). 
In Study ALK8700-A301, there were 5 reported malignancies, and no 
malignancy was seen in greater than one participant. 
In 2-year rodent carcinogenicity studies with Tecfidera, renal tubular 
adenomas and carcinomas were observed, which were attributed to an 
exacerbation of rodent-specific age-related nephropathy. The 
 
 
 
Important identified risks 
nephropathy observed in aging rodents has no human correlate and since 
Tecfidera was not associated with an increased risk of urinary or renal 
events in clinical studies, these nonclinical findings represent a relatively 
low risk to humans. 
From a review of all available data, no evidence of a causal link between 
Tecfidera and the development of malignancies has been identified, and 
the types and frequencies of malignancies reported in patients treated 
with Tecfidera are consistent those observed in the general population.

Effects on pregnancy outcome 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Reproductive toxicology studies conducted with Vumerity revealed no 
impairment of male and female fertility in rats, no teratogenicity in rats 
and rabbits, and no pre- and postnatal development toxicity in rats at 
MMF and 2-hydroxyethyl succinimide (HES) exposure area under the 
concentration-time curve (AUC) at least 2 times the recommended 
human dose (RHD) of Vumerity. At maternal toxic doses, the offspring 
of Tecfidera-treated pregnant animals exhibited skeletal variations in rats 
and skeletal variations/malformations in rabbits; these findings occurred 
at MMF AUC that was approximately 10 times the RHD of Vumerity in 
rats and ≥ 6 times that in rabbits. At a toxic dose to pregnant rats, with 
MMF exposure (AUC) that was approximately 10 times of that at the 
RHD of Vumerity, decreased birth weights and body weights/weight 
gains during the preweaning period were noted in the offspring. Except 
for skeletal malformations in rabbits, similar embryo-foetal 
developmental findings have been reported for Tecfidera. 
However, no adequate data exist on the developmental risk associated 
with the use of Vumerity in pregnant women. Because animal 
reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this 
drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and if the 
potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.  
Ten pregnancies have been reported in the DRF clinical study 
programme. One pregnancy was reported in the Phase 1 study (Study 
ALK8700-A110), and 9 pregnancies were reported in Study ALK8700-
A301. The outcome of 6 pregnancies was the delivery of 7 healthy, full-
term infants (5 singletons and 1 twin gestation); 2 pregnancies resulted 
in spontaneous abortions (gestational ages unknown); and 2 pregnancies 
were terminated by elective abortions, 1 at 8 weeks and 1 at 10 weeks of 
gestation. 
 
 
 
Important identified risks 
The impact of Vumerity on pregnancy outcomes will be evaluated in a 
prospective pregnancy registry (Study 272MS401). The effects of 
Vumerity on labour and delivery are unknown. 
Current data from clinical trials, postmarketing and ongoing Biogen 
Multiple Sclerosis Pregnancy Exposure Registry (Study 109MS402) do 
not suggest that Tecfidera, when taken early in pregnancy, has an 
adverse or negative effect on pregnancy outcome. The observations from 
these studies are relevant to DRF given the shared common active 
metabolite, MMF, with Tecfidera.

Interaction with nephrotoxic medications leading to renal toxicity 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
In Study ALK8700-A301 with DRF and as of 01 September 2020, the 
overall incidence of AESIs in the renal injury category was low (3.5% 
[37/1057] of participants). The incidence was low across all groups. All 
events in this category were mild or moderate in severity and nonserious, 
with the most common event being proteinuria, which was experienced 
by 1.3% (14/1057) of participants. The evaluation of the events does not 
suggest or provide any evidence of renal injury associated with DRF. No 
impact to the risk-benefit balance of DRF is anticipated. 
Results of a subgroup analysis within the placebo-controlled Tecfidera 
studies show that there was an increased incidence of renal and urinary 
AEs (primarily AEs of proteinuria) in participants with concomitant 
potentially nephrotoxic medication (PNM) compared with participants 
who did not receive PNMs.

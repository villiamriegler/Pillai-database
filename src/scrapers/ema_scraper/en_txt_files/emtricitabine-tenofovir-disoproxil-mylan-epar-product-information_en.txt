CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of HIV-1 infection: 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment 
of HIV-1 infected adults (see section 5.1). 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adolescents, 
with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first line agents, (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-
exposure prophylaxis to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents at 
high risk (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management 
of HIV infection. 
Posology 
Treatment of HIV in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 35 kg: One tablet, 
once daily. 
Prevention of HIV in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older, weighing at least35 kg: One tablet, 
once daily. 
Separate preparations of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil are available for treatment of HIV-1 infection 
if it becomes necessary to discontinue or modify the dose of one of the components of

Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for these 
medicinal products.  
If a dose of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is missed within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should be taken as soon as possible and the normal dosing schedule should 
be resumed. If a dose of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is missed by more than 12 hours and it is almost 
time for the next dose, the missed dose should not be taken and the usual dosing schedule should be resumed.  
If vomiting occurs within 1 hour of taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, another tablet should 
be taken. If vomiting occurs more than 1 hour after taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan a 
second dose should not be taken. 
Special populations 
Elderly: 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir are eliminated by renal excretion and the exposure to emtricitabine and tenofovir 
increases in individuals with renal dysfunction (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Adults with renal impairment 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should only be used in individuals with creatinine clearance (CrCl) 
<80 mL/min if the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. See Table 1. 
Table 1: Dosing recommendations in adults with renal impairment 
Mild renal impairment  
(CrCl 50-80 mL/min) 
Treatment of HIV-1 infection 
Limited data from clinical studies support once 
daily dosing (see section 4.4). 
Moderate renal impairment 
(CrCl 30-49 mL/min) 
Severe renal impairment  
(CrCl <30 mL/min) and 
haemodialysis patients 
Administration every 48 hours is 
recommended based on modelling of single-
dose pharmacokinetic data for emtricitabine 
and tenofovir disoproxil in non-HIV infected 
subjects with varying degrees of renal 
impairment (see section 4.4). 
Not recommended because appropriate dose 
reductions cannot be achieved with the 
combination tablet. 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis 
Limited data from clinical studies 
support once daily dosing in HIV-1 
uninfected individuals with CrCl 
60-80 mL/min. Use is not 
recommended in HIV-1 uninfected 
individuals with CrCl < 60 mL/min 
as it has not been studied in this 
population (see sections 4.4 and 
5.2). 
Not recommended for use in this 
population. 
Not recommended for use in this 
population. 
Paediatrics with renal impairment: 
Not recommended for use in individuals under the age of 18 years with renal impairment (see 
section 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment  
No dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).

Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in children under the age of 12 years have not 
been established (see section 5.2). 
Method of administration  
Oral administration. It is preferable that Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is taken with food.  
The film-coated tablet can be disintegrated in approximately 100 mL of water, orange juice or grape juice 
and taken immediately. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Use for pre-exposure prophylaxis in individuals with unknown or positive HIV-1 status. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Patients with HIV-1 harbouring mutations 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 
harbouring the K65R mutation (see section 5.1).  
Overall HIV-1 infection prevention strategy 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1. The time to 
onset of protection after commencing emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is unknown. 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should only be used for pre-exposure prophylaxis as part of an overall 
HIV-1 infection prevention strategy including the use of other HIV-1 prevention measures (e.g. consistent 
and correct condom use, knowledge of HIV-1 status, regular testing for other sexually transmitted 
infections). 
Risk of resistance with undetected HIV-1 infection 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should only be used to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV-1 in individuals 
confirmed to be HIV negative (see section 4.3). Individuals should be re-confirmed to be HIV-negative at 
frequent intervals (e.g. at least every 3 months) using a combined antigen/antibody test while taking 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil for pre-exposure prophylaxis. 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil alone does not constitute a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 
and HIV-1 resistance mutations have emerged in individuals with undetected HIV-1 infection who are only 
taking emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil. 
If clinical symptoms consistent with acute viral infection are present and recent (< 1 month) exposures to 
HIV-1 are suspected, use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should be delayed for at least one month and 
HIV-1 status reconfirmed before starting emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil for pre-exposure prophylaxis. 
Importance of adherence 
The effectiveness of Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in reducing the risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly 
correlated with adherence as demonstrated by measurable drug levels in blood (see section 5.1). HIV-1 
uninfected individuals should be counselled at frequent intervals to strictly adhere to the recommended 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil daily dosing schedule.

Patients with hepatitis B or C virus infection 
HIV-1 infected patients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with antiretroviral therapy are at an increased 
risk for severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. Physicians should refer to current HIV 
treatment guidelines for the management of HIV infection in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV).  
The safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil for pre-exposure prophylaxis in patients with 
HBV or HCV infection has not been established. 
In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant Summary of 
Product Characteristics for these medicinal products. See also under Use with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir or 
sofosbuvir and velpatasvir below. 
Tenofovir disoproxil is indicated for the treatment of HBV and emtricitabine has shown activity against 
HBV in pharmacodynamic studies but the safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil have not 
been specifically established in patients with chronic HBV infection.  
Discontinuation of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil therapy in patients infected with HBV may be 
associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis. Patients infected with HBV who discontinue 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil therapy should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory 
follow-up for at least several months after stopping treatment. If appropriate, resumption of hepatitis B 
therapy may be warranted. In patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is 
not recommended since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation.  
Liver disease 
The safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil have not been established in patients with 
significant underlying liver disorders. The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir has been studied in patients with 
hepatic impairment and no dose adjustment is required. The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine has not been 
studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Based on minimal hepatic metabolism and the renal route of 
elimination for emtricitabine, it is unlikely that a dose adjustment would be required for 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in patients with hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
HIV-1 infected patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an 
increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and 
should be monitored according to standard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such 
patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered.  
Renal and bone effects in adults 
Renal effects 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration 
and active tubular secretion. Renal failure, renal impairment, elevated creatinine, hypophosphataemia and 
proximal tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) have been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil 
(see section 4.8). 
Renal monitoring 
Prior to initiating Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan for the treatment of HIV-1 infection or for use in 
pre-exposure prophylaxis, it is recommended that creatinine clearance is calculated in all individuals. 
In individuals without risk factors for renal disease, it is recommended that renal function (creatinine 
clearance and serum phosphate) is monitored after two to four weeks of use, after three months of use and 
every three to six months thereafter. 
In individuals at risk for renal disease more frequent monitoring of renal function is required.

See also under Co-administration of other medicinal products below. 
Renal management in HIV-1 infected patients 
If serum phosphate is < 1.5 mg/dL (0.48 mmol/L) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 50 mL/min in any 
patient receiving, emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, 
including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 
4.8, proximal tubulopathy). Consideration should be given to interrupting treatment with 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in patients with creatinine clearance decreased to < 50 mL/min or 
decreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L). Interrupting treatment with 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function 
when no other cause has been identified. 
Renal safety with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has only been studied to a very limited degree in HIV-1 
infected patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance < 80 mL/min). Dose interval adjustments 
are recommended for HIV-1 infected patients with creatinine clearance 30-49 mL/min (see section 4.2). 
Limited clinical study data suggest that the prolonged dose interval is not optimal and could result in 
increased toxicity and possibly inadequate response. Furthermore, in a small clinical study, a subgroup of 
patients with creatinine clearance between 50 and 60 mL/min who received tenofovir disoproxil in 
combination with emtricitabine every 24 hours had a 2-4-fold higher exposure to tenofovir and worsening of 
renal function (see section 5.2). Therefore, a careful benefit-risk assessment is needed when 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is used in patients with creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min, and renal 
function should be closely monitored. In addition, the clinical response to treatment should be closely 
monitored in patients receiving emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil at a prolonged dosing interval. The use of 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 mL/min) and in patients who require haemodialysis since appropriate dose reductions cannot 
be achieved with the combination tablet (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Renal management in PrEP 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in HIV-1 uninfected individuals with creatinine 
clearance < 60 mL/min and is therefore not recommended for use in this population. If serum phosphate is 
< 1.5 mg/dL (0.48 mmol/L) or creatinine clearance is decreased to < 60 mL/min in any individual receiving 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil for pre-exposure prophylaxis, renal function should be re-evaluated within 
one week, including measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see 
section 4.8, proximal tubulopathy). Consideration should be given to interrupting use of 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in individuals with creatinine clearance decreased to < 60 mL/min or 
decreases in serum phosphate to < 1.0 mg/dL (0.32 mmol/L). Interrupting use of emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function when no other cause has 
been identified. 
Bone effects 
Bone abnormalities such as osteomalacia which can manifest as persistent or worsening bone pain and, 
which can infrequently contribute to fractures may be associated with tenofovir disoproxil induced proximal 
renal tubulopathy (see section 4.8). 
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD). 
If bone abnormalities are suspected or detected then appropriate consultation should be obtained.  
Treatment of HIV-1 infection: 
In a 144-week controlled clinical study (GS-99-903) that compared tenofovir disoproxil with stavudine in 
combination with lamivudine and efavirenz in antiretroviral-naïve patients, small decreases in BMD of the 
hip and spine were observed in both treatment groups. Decreases in BMD of spine and changes in bone 
biomarkers from baseline were significantly greater in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group at 144 weeks. 
Decreases in BMD of hip were significantly greater in this group until 96 weeks. However, there was no 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased risk of fractures or evidence for clinically relevant bone abnormalities over 144 weeks in this 
study.  
In other studies (prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen in 
patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease inhibitor. 
Overall in view of the bone abnormalities associated with tenofovir disoproxil and the limitations of long 
term data on the impact of tenofovir disoproxil on bone health and fracture risk, alternative treatment 
regimens should be considered for patients with osteoporosis that are at a high risk for fractures. 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis 
In clinical studies of HIV-1 uninfected individuals, small decreases in BMD were observed. In a study of 
498 men, the mean changes from baseline to week 24 in BMD ranged from -0.4% to -1.0% across hip, spine, 
femoral neck and trochanter in men who received daily emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil prophylaxis (n = 
247) vs. placebo (n = 251). 
Renal and bone effects in the paediatric population 
There are uncertainties associated with the long -term renal and bone effects of tenofovir disoproxil during 
the treatment of HIV-1 infection in the paediatric population and on the long-term renal and bone effects of 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil when used for pre-exposure prophylaxis in uninfected adolescents (see 
section 5.1). Moreover, the reversibility of renal toxicity after cessation of tenofovir disoproxil for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection or after cessation of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil for pre-exposure 
prophylaxis cannot be fully ascertained.  
A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to weigh the benefit/risk balance of emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil for the treatment of HIV-1 infection or for pre-exposure prophylaxis, decide the appropriate 
monitoring during treatment (including decision for treatment withdrawal) and consider the need for 
supplementation on a case by case basis. 
When using emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil for pre-exposure prophylaxis individuals should be reassessed 
at each visit to ascertain whether they remain at high risk of HIV-1 infection. The risk of HIV-1 infection 
should be balanced against the potential for renal and bone effects with long-term use of 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil.  
Renal effects 
Renal adverse reactions consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy have been reported in HIV 1 infected 
paediatric patients aged 2 to < 12 years in clinical study GS US 104 0352 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
Renal monitoring 
Renal function (creatinine clearance and serum phosphate) should be evaluated prior to initiating 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil for treatment of HIV-1 or for pre-exposure prophylaxis, and should be 
monitored during use as in adults (see above). 
Renal management 
If serum phosphate is confirmed to be < 3.0 mg/dL (0.96 mmol/L) in any paediatric patient receiving 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, renal function should be re-evaluated within one week, including 
measurements of blood glucose, blood potassium and urine glucose concentrations (see section 4.8, proximal 
tubulopathy). If renal abnormalities are suspected or detected then consultation with a nephrologist should be 
obtained to consider interruption of Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil use. Interrupting use of 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should also be considered in case of progressive decline of renal function 
when no other cause has been identified. 
Co-administration and risk of renal toxicity 
The same recommendations apply as in adults (see Co-administration of other medicinal products below). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
The use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended in individuals under the age of 18 years 
with renal impairment (see section 4.2). Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be initiated in 
paediatric patients with renal impairment and should be discontinued in paediatric patients who develop 
renal impairment during emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil therapy. 
Bone effects  
Use of tenofovir disoproxil may cause a reduction in BMD. The effects of tenofovir disoproxil-associated 
changes in BMD on long-term bone health and future fracture risk are uncertain (see section 5.1). 
If bone abnormalities are detected or suspected during use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in any 
paediatric patient, consultation with an endocrinologist and/or nephrologist should be obtained. 
Weight and metabolic parameters 
An increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such 
changes may in part be linked to disease control and life style. For lipids, there is in some cases evidence for 
a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating this to any particular treatment. 
For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established HIV treatment guidelines. Lipid 
disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction following exposure in utero 
Nucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most pronounced 
with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV 
negative infants exposed in utero and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these have predominantly 
concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse reactions reported are 
haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia). 
These events have often been transitory. Late onset neurological disorders have been reported rarely 
(hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such neurological disorders are transient or 
permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be considered for any child exposed in utero to 
nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical findings of unknown etiology, particularly 
neurologic findings. These findings do not affect current national recommendations to use antiretroviral 
therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV.  
Immune Reactivation Syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an inflammatory 
reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, 
or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such reactions have been observed within the first few weeks or 
months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples are cytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal 
mycobacterial infections, and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Any inflammatory symptoms should be 
evaluated and treatment instituted when necessary.  
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to occur 
in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events 
can occur many months after initiation of treatment.  
Opportunistic infections  
HIV-1 infected patients receiving emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil or any other antiretroviral therapy may 
continue to develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection, and therefore should 
remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the treatment of patients with HIV 
associated diseases.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Osteonecrosis 
Although the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, 
severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly 
in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. Patients should be advised to 
seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in movement.  
Co-administration of other medicinal products 
Use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic 
medicinal product (see section 4.5). If concomitant use with nephrotoxic agents is unavoidable, renal 
function should be monitored weekly.  
Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) have been reported in HIV-1 infected patients treated with tenofovir disoproxil and with risk 
factors for renal dysfunction. If emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is co-administered with an NSAID, renal 
function should be monitored adequately. 
A higher risk of renal impairment has been reported in HIV-1 infected patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil 
in combination with a ritonavir or cobicistat boosted protease inhibitor. Close monitoring of renal function is 
required in these patients (see section 4.5). In HIV-1 infected patients with renal risk factors, the 
co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with a boosted protease inhibitor should be carefully evaluated. 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products 
containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide, or other cytidine analogues, such as 
lamivudine (see section 4.5). Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be administered concomitantly 
with adefovir dipivoxil. 
Use with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir and velpatasvir or sofosbuvir, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir, 
especially when used together with an HIV regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil and a pharmacokinetic 
enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat).  
The safety of tenofovir disoproxil when co-administered with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a pharmacokinetic enhancer has not been established. The potential 
risks and benefits associated with co-administration should be considered, particularly in patients at 
increased risk of renal dysfunction. Patients receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir concomitantly with tenofovir disoproxil and a boosted HIV protease 
inhibitor should be monitored for adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil. 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine  
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended (see section 4.5).  
Triple nucleoside therapy 
There have been reports of a high rate of virological failure and of emergence of resistance at an early stage 
in HIV-1 infected patients when tenofovir disoproxil was combined with lamivudine and abacavir as well as 
with lamivudine and didanosine as a once daily regimen. There is close structural similarity between 
lamivudine and emtricitabine and similarities in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these two 
agents. Therefore, the same problems may be seen if emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is administered with 
a third nucleoside analogue.

Elderly  
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in individuals over the age of 65 years. Individuals 
over the age of 65 years are more likely to have decreased renal function, therefore caution should be 
exercised when administering emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil to older people. 
Excipients 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary 
problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not 
take this medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
As emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fixed-dose combination tablets contains emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil, any interactions that have been identified with these agents individually may occur with the 
fixed-dose combination. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.  
The steady-state pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir were unaffected when emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil were administered together versus each medicinal product dosed alone.  
In vitro and clinical pharmacokinetic interaction studies have shown the potential for CYP450 mediated 
interactions involving emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil with other medicinal products is low.  
Concomitant use not recommended  
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be administered concomitantly with other medicinal products 
containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide or other cytidine analogues, such as 
lamivudine (see section 4.4). Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should not be administered concomitantly 
with adefovir dipivoxil.  
Didanosine: The co-administration of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine is not recommended 
(see section 4.4 and Table 2).  
Renally eliminated medicinal products: Since emtricitabine and tenofovir are primarily eliminated by the 
kidneys, co-administration of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with medicinal products that reduce renal 
function or compete for active tubular secretion (e.g. cidofovir) may increase serum concentrations of 
emtricitabine, tenofovir and/or the co-administered medicinal products. 
Use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic 
medicinal product. Some examples include, but are not limited to, aminoglycosides, amphotericin B, 
foscarnet, ganciclovir, pentamidine, vancomycin, cidofovir or interleukin-2 (see section 4.4).  
Other interactions  
Interactions between emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil or its individual component(s) and other medicinal 
products are listed in Table 2 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”, twice 
daily as “b.i.d.” and once daily as “q.d.”). If available, 90% confidence intervals are shown in parentheses.

sometimes fatal, have been reported. 
Co-administration of tenofovir disoproxil and 
didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily has been 
associated with a significant decrease in CD4 
cell count, possibly due to an intracellular 
interaction increasing phosphorylated (i.e. 
active) didanosine. A decreased dosage of 
250 mg didanosine co-administered with 
tenofovir disoproxil therapy has been associated 
with reports of high rates of virological failure 
within several tested combinations for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection  
Lamivudine and emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil should not be administered 
concomitantly (see section 4.4).

Recommendation concerning 
co-administration with 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil 
(emtricitabine 200 mg, tenofovir disoproxil 
245 mg) 
Increased plasma concentrations of tenofovir 
resulting from co-administration of tenofovir 
disoproxil, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir 
and darunavir/ritonavir may increase adverse 
reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil, 
including renal disorders. The safety of 
tenofovir disoproxil when used with 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and a 
pharmacokinetic enhancer (e.g. ritonavir or 
cobicistat) has not been established. 
The combination should be used with caution 
with frequent renal monitoring (see section 4.4)

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no 
malformations or foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil. Animal 
studies on emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil do not indicate reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Therefore, the use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil may be considered during pregnancy, if necessary. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir have been shown to be excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information 
on the effects of emtricitabine and tenofovir in newborns/infants. Therefore, emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil should not be used during breast-feeding.  
In order to avoid transmission of HIV to the infant it is recommended that women living with HIV do not 
breast-feed their infants.  
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil are available. Animal studies do not 
indicate harmful effects of emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, 
individuals should be informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with both emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
HIV-1 infection: The most frequently reported adverse reactions considered possibly or probably related to 
emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil were nausea (12%) and diarrhoea (7%) in an open-label randomised 
clinical study in adults (GS-01-934, see section 5.1). The safety profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil in this study was consistent with the previous experience with these agents when each was 
administered with other antiretroviral agents.  
Pre-exposure prophylaxis: No new adverse reactions to emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil were identified 
from two randomised placebo-controlled studies (iPrEx, Partners PrEP) in which 2,830 HIV-1 uninfected 
adults received emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil once daily for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Patients were 
followed for a median of 71 weeks and 87 weeks, respectively. The most frequent adverse reaction reported 
in the emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil group in the iPrEx study was headache (1%). 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions  
The adverse reactions considered at least possibly related to treatment with the components of 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil from clinical study and post-marketing experience in HIV-1 infected 
patients are listed in Table 3, below, by body system organ class and frequency. Within each 
frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are 
defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100) or rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000).

administered to paediatric patients.  
3 This adverse reaction was identified through post-marketing surveillance but not observed in randomised controlled clinical 
studies in adults or paediatric HIV clinical studies for emtricitabine or in randomised controlled clinical studies or the tenofovir

based on the total number of patients exposed to emtricitabine in randomised controlled clinical studies (n = 1,563) or tenofovir 
disoproxil in randomised controlled clinical trials and the expanded access program (n = 7,319). 
Description of selected adverse reactions  
Renal impairment 
As emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil may cause renal damage, monitoring of renal function is recommended 
(see section 4.4). Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after tenofovir disoproxil 
discontinuation. However, in some HIV-1 infected patients, declines in creatinine clearance did not 
completely resolve despite tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation. Patients at risk of renal impairment (such as 
patients with baseline renal risk factors, advanced HIV disease, or patients receiving concomitant 
nephrotoxic medications) are at increased risk of experiencing incomplete recovery of renal function despite 
tenofovir disoproxil discontinuation (see section 4.4). 
Lactic acidosis 
Cases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with other 
antiretrovirals. Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver disease, or 
patients receiving concomitant medications known to induce lactic acidosis are at increased risk of 
experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including fatal outcomes. 
Metabolic parameters 
Weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4).  
Immune Reactivation Syndrome 
In HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of CART, an inflammatory 
reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as 
Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is 
more variable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).  
Osteonecrosis 
Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, 
advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to CART. The frequency of this is unknown (see section 4.4).  
Paediatric population  
Assessment of adverse reactions related to emtricitabine is based on experience in three paediatric studies (n 
= 169) where treatment-naïve (n = 123) and treatment-experienced (n = 46) paediatric HIV infected patients 
aged 4 months to 18 years were treated with emtricitabine in combination with other antiretroviral agents.  In 
addition to the adverse reactions reported in adults, anaemia (9.5%) and skin discolouration (31.8%) 
occurred more frequently in clinical trials in paediatric patients than in adults (see section 4.8, Tabulated 
summary of adverse reactions). 
Assessment of adverse reactions related to tenofovir disoproxil is based on two randomised trials (studies GS 
US 104 0321 and GS US 104 0352) in 184 HIV 1 infected paediatric patients (aged 2 to < 18 years) who 
received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 93) or placebo/active comparator (n = 91) in combination 
with other antiretroviral agents for 48 weeks (see section 5.1). The adverse reactions observed in paediatric 
patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil were consistent with those observed in clinical 
studies of tenofovir disoproxil in adults (see section 4.8 Tabulated summary of adverse reactions and 5.1). 
Reductions in BMD have been reported in paediatric patients. In HIV 1 infected adolescents (aged 12 to < 18 
years), the BMD Z scores observed in subjects who received tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those 
observed in subjects who received placebo. In HIV 1 infected children (aged 2 to 15 years), the BMD Z 
scores observed in subjects who switched to tenofovir disoproxil were lower than those observed in subjects 
who remained on their stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimen (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study GS US 104 0352, 89 HIV-1 infected paediatric patients with a median age of 7 years (range 2 to 15 
years) were exposed to tenofovir disoproxil for a median of 331 weeks. Eight of the 89 patients (9.0%) 
discontinued study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings clinically 
consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil therapy.  Seven 
patients had estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values between 70 and 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. Among 
them, 3 patients experienced a clinically meaningful decline in estimated GFR during therapy which 
improved after discontinuation of tenofovir disoproxil. 
Other special populations  
Individuals with renal impairment: Since tenofovir disoproxil can cause renal toxicity, close monitoring of 
renal function is recommended in any adults with renal impairment receiving emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.2). The use of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended 
in individuals under the age of 18 years with renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
HIV/HBV or HCV co-infected patients: The adverse reaction profile of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil 
in a limited number of HIV-infected patients in study GS-01-934 who were co-infected with HBV (n = 13) 
or HCV (n = 26) was similar to that observed in patients infected with HIV without co-infection. However, 
as would be expected in this patient population, elevations in AST and ALT occurred more frequently than 
in the general HIV infected population.  
Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment: In HBV infected patients, clinical and 
laboratory evidence of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked 
to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
If overdose occurs the individual must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8), and standard 
supportive treatment applied as necessary.  
Up to 30% of the emtricitabine dose and approximately 10% of the tenofovir dose can be removed by 
haemodialysis. It is not known whether emtricitabine or tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use; antivirals for treatment of HIV infections, 
combinations. ATC code: J05AR03 
Mechanism of action 
Emtricitabine is a nucleoside analogue of cytidine. Tenofovir disoproxil is converted in vivo to tenofovir, a 
nucleoside monophosphate (nucleotide) analogue of adenosine monophosphate. Both emtricitabine and 
tenofovir have activity that is specific to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and hepatitis B 
virus. 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine triphosphate and 
tenofovir diphosphate, respectively. In vitro studies have shown that both emtricitabine and tenofovir can be 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fully phosphorylated when combined together in cells. Emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate 
competitively inhibit HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, resulting in DNA chain termination.  
Both emtricitabine triphosphate and tenofovir diphosphate are weak inhibitors of mammalian DNA 
polymerases and there was no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo. 
Antiviral activity in vitro  
Synergistic antiviral activity was observed with the combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir in vitro. 
Additive to synergistic effects were observed in combination studies with protease inhibitors, and with 
nucleoside and non-nucleoside analogue inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase.  
Resistance 
In vitro: Resistance has been seen in vitro and in some HIV-1 infected patients due to the development of the 
M184V/I mutation with emtricitabine or the K65R mutation with tenofovir.  
Emtricitabine-resistant viruses with the M184V/I mutation were cross-resistant to lamivudine, but retained 
sensitivity to didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir and zidovudine. The K65R mutation can also be selected by 
abacavir or didanosine and results in reduced susceptibility to these agents plus lamivudine, emtricitabine 
and tenofovir. Tenofovir disoproxil should be avoided in patients with HIV-1 harbouring the K65R mutation. 
In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has been selected by tenofovir and results in 
low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine and tenofovir. HIV-1 expressing three 
or more thymidine analogue associated mutations (TAMs) that included either the M41L or L210W reverse 
transcriptase mutation showed reduced susceptibility to tenofovir disoproxil.  
In vivo treatment of HIV-1: In an open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934) in antiretroviral-naïve 
patients, genotyping was performed on plasma HIV-1 isolates from all patients with confirmed HIV RNA > 
400 copies/mL at weeks 48, 96 or 144 or at the time of early study drug discontinuation. As of week 144:  
 
 
 
The M184V/I mutation developed in 2/19 (10.5%) isolates analysed from patients in the 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil/efavirenz group and in 10/29 (34.5%) isolates analysed from the 
lamivudine/zidovudine/efavirenz group (p-value < 0.05, Fisher’s Exact test comparing the 
emtricitabine+tenofovir disoproxil group to the lamivudine/zidovudine group among all patients).  
No virus analysed contained the K65R or K70E mutation.  
Genotypic resistance to efavirenz, predominantly the K103N mutation, developed in virus from 13/19 
(68%) patients in the emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil/efavirenz group and in virus from 21/29 (72%) 
patients in the comparative group.  
In vivo –-pre-exposure prophylaxis: Plasma samples from 2 clinical studies of HIV-1 uninfected subjects, 
iPrEx and Partners PrEP, were analysed for 4 HIV-1 variants expressing amino acid substitutions (i.e. K65R, 
K70E, M184V, and M184I) that potentially confer resistance to tenofovir or emtricitabine. In the iPrEx 
clinical study, no HIV-1 variants expressing K65R, K70E, M184V, or M184I were detected at the time of 
seroconversion among subjects who became infected with HIV-1 after enrolment in the study. In 3 of 
10 subjects who had acute HIV infection at study enrolment, M184I and M184V mutations were detected in 
the HIV of 2 of 2 subjects in the emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil group and 1 of 8 subjects in the placebo 
group. 
In the Partners PrEP clinical study, no HIV-1 variants expressing K65R, K70E, M184V, or M184I were 
detected at the time of seroconversion among subjects who became infected with HIV-1 during the study. In 
2 of 14 subjects who had acute HIV infection at study enrolment, the K65R mutation was detected in the 
HIV of 1 of 5 subjects in the tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg group and the M184V mutation (associated with 
resistance to emtricitabine) was detected in the HIV of 1 of 3 subjects in the emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil group.

Clinical data  
Treatment of HIV-1 infection: In an open-label randomised clinical study (GS-01-934), antiretroviral-naïve 
HIV-1 infected adult patients received either a once daily regimen of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and 
efavirenz (n = 255) or a fixed combination of lamivudine and zidovudine administered twice daily and 
efavirenz once daily (n = 254). Patients in the emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil group were given 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz from week 96 to week 144. At baseline the randomised 
groups had similar median plasma HIV-1 RNA (5.02 and 5.00 log10 copies/mL) and CD4 counts (233 and 
241 cells/mm3). The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was the achievement and maintenance of 
confirmed HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/mL over 48 weeks. Secondary efficacy analyses over 
144 weeks included the proportion of patients with HIV-1 RNA concentrations < 400 or < 50 copies/mL, and 
change from baseline in CD4 cell count. 
The 48-week primary endpoint data showed that the combination of emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and 
efavirenz provided superior antiviral efficacy as compared with the fixed combination of lamivudine and 
zidovudine with efavirenz as shown in Table 4. The 144 week secondary endpoint data are also presented in 
Table 4.

Patients receiving emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil and efavirenz were given emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil plus 
In a randomised clinical study (M02-418), 190 antiretroviral-naïve adults were treated once daily with 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir given once or twice daily. At 
48 weeks, 70% and 64% of patients demonstrated HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL with the once and twice daily 
regimens of lopinavir/ritonavir, respectively. The mean changes in CD4 cell count from baseline were 
+185 cells/mm3 and +196 cells/mm3 respectively.  
Limited clinical experience in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV suggests that treatment with 
emtricitabine or tenofovir disoproxil in antiretroviral combination therapy to control HIV infection results in 
a reduction in HBV DNA (3 log10 reduction or 4 to 5 log10 reduction, respectively) (see section 4.4).

uninfected men (or transgender women) who have sex with men and who were considered at high risk for 
HIV infection. Subjects were followed for 4,237 person-years. Baseline characteristics are summarised in

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in children under the age of 12 years have not 
been established. 
Treatment of HIV-1 infection in the paediatric population 
There are no clinical studies conducted with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in the paediatric population 
with HIV-1 infection.  
Clinical efficacy and safety of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil was established from studies conducted with 
emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil when given as single agents. 
Studies with emtricitabine 
In  infants  and  children  older  than  4  months,  the  majority  of  patients  taking  emtricitabine  achieved  or 
maintained complete suppression of plasma HIV 1 RNA through 48 weeks (89% achieved ≤ 400 copies/mL 
and 77% achieved ≤ 50 copies/mL).  
Studies with tenofovir disoproxil 
In study GS US 104 0321, 87 HIV 1 infected treatment-experienced patients 12 to < 18 years of age were 
treated with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 45) or placebo (n = 42) in combination with an optimised background 
regimen (OBR) for 48 weeks. Due to limitations of the study, a benefit of tenofovir disoproxil over placebo 
was not demonstrated based on plasma HIV 1 RNA levels at week 24. However, a benefit is expected for the 
adolescent population based on extrapolation of adult data and comparative pharmacokinetic data (see section 
5.2). 
In patients who received treatment with tenofovir disoproxil or placebo, mean lumbar spine BMD Z score was 
-1.004 and -0.809, and mean total body BMD Z-score was -0.866 and -0.584, respectively, at baseline. Mean 
changes at week 48 (end of double-blind phase) were -0.215 and          -0.165 in lumbar spine BMD Z-score, 
and -0.254 and -0.179 in total body BMD Z-score for the tenofovir disoproxil and placebo groups, respectively. 
The mean rate of BMD gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil group compared to the placebo group. At 
week  48,  six  adolescents  in  the  tenofovir  disoproxil  group  and  one  adolescent  in  the  placebo  group  had 
significant lumbar spine BMD loss (defined as > 4% loss). Among 28 patients receiving 96 weeks of treatment 
with tenofovir disoproxil, BMD Z scores declined by -0.341 for lumbar spine and -0.458 for total body. 
35 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In study GS US  104 0352, 97  treatment-experienced  patients  2  to < 12  years  of age  with stable,  virologic 
suppression on stavudine- or zidovudine-containing regimens were randomised to either replace stavudine or 
zidovudine with tenofovir disoproxil (n = 48) or continue on their original regimen (n = 49) for 48 weeks. At 
week 48, 83% of patients in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment group and 92% of patients in the stavudine or 
zidovudine treatment group had HIV 1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/mL. The difference in the proportion 
of  patients  who  maintained  <  400  copies/mL  at  week  48  was  mainly  influenced  by  the  higher  number  of 
discontinuations  in  the  tenofovir  disoproxil  treatment  group.  When  missing  data  were  excluded,  91%  of 
patients  in  the  tenofovir  disoproxil  treatment  group  and  94%  of  patients  in  the  stavudine  or  zidovudine 
treatment group had HIV 1 RNA concentrations < 400 copies/mL at week 48.  
Reductions  in  BMD  have  been  reported  in  paediatric  patients.  In  patients  who  received  treatment  with 
tenofovir disoproxil, or stavudine or zidovudine, mean lumbar spine BMD Z score was 1.034 and 0.498, and 
mean total body BMD Z-score was 0.471 and 0.386, respectively, at baseline. Mean changes at week 48 (end 
of randomised phase) were 0.032 and 0.087 in lumbar spine BMD Z score, and 0.184 and 0.027 in total body 
BMD Z score for the tenofovir disoproxil and stavudine or zidovudine groups, respectively. The mean rate of 
lumbar  spine  bone  gain  at  week  48  was  similar  between  the  tenofovir  disoproxil  treatment  group  and  the 
stavudine or zidovudine treatment group. Total body bone gain was less in the tenofovir disoproxil treatment 
group compared to the stavudine or zidovudine treatment group. One tenofovir disoproxil treated subject and 
no stavudine or zidovudine treated subjects experienced significant (> 4%) lumbar spine BMD loss at week 
48. BMD Z scores declined by 0.012 for lumbar spine and by 0.338 for total body in the 64 subjects who were 
treated with tenofovir disoproxil for 96 weeks. BMD Z scores were not adjusted for height and weight.  
In study GS US 104 0352, 8 out of 89 paediatric patients (9.0%) exposed to tenofovir disoproxil discontinued 
study drug due to renal adverse events.  Five subjects (5.6%) had laboratory findings clinically consistent with 
proximal renal tubulopathy, 4 of whom discontinued tenofovir disoproxil therapy (median tenofovir disoproxil 
exposure 331 weeks). 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis in the paediatric population 
The efficacy and safety of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil for pre-exposure prophylaxis in adolescents who 
adhere to daily dosing is expected to be similar to that in adults at the same level of adherence. The potential 
renal and bone effects with long term use of emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil for pre-exposure prophylaxis 
in adolescents are uncertain (see section 4.4). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The bioequivalence of one emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fixed-combination film-coated tablet with one 
emtricitabine 200 mg hard capsule and one tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg film-coated tablet was established 
following single dose administration to fasting healthy subjects. Following oral administration of 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil to healthy subjects, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil are rapidly 
absorbed and tenofovir disoproxil is converted to tenofovir. Maximum emtricitabine and tenofovir 
concentrations are observed in serum within 0.5 to 3.0 h of dosing in the fasted state. Administration of 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with food resulted in a delay of approximately three quarters of an hour in 
reaching maximum tenofovir concentrations and increases in tenofovir AUC and Cmax of approximately 35% 
and 15%, respectively, when administered with a high fat or light meal, compared to administration in the 
fasted state. In order to optimise the absorption of tenofovir, it is recommended that emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil should preferably be taken with food. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, the volume of distribution of emtricitabine and tenofovir was 
approximately 1.4 L/kg and 800 mL/kg, respectively. After oral administration of emtricitabine or tenofovir 
disoproxil, emtricitabine and tenofovir are widely distributed throughout the body. In vitro binding of 
emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4% and independent of concentration over the range of 0.02 
36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to 200 μg/mL. In vitro protein binding of tenofovir to plasma or serum protein was less than 0.7 and 7.2%, 
respectively, over the tenofovir concentration range 0.01 to 25 μg/mL. 
Biotransformation 
There is limited metabolism of emtricitabine. The biotransformation of emtricitabine includes oxidation of 
the thiol moiety to form the 3'-sulphoxide diastereomers (approximately 9% of dose) and conjugation with 
glucuronic acid to form 2'-O-glucuronide (approximately 4% of dose). In vitro studies have determined that 
neither tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the CYP450 enzymes. Neither emtricitabine nor 
tenofovir inhibited in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the major human CYP450 isoforms involved 
in drug biotransformation. Also, emtricitabine did not inhibit uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronyl transferase, the 
enzyme responsible for glucuronidation. 
Elimination 
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys with complete recovery of the dose achieved in urine 
(approximately 86%) and faeces (approximately 14%). Thirteen percent of the emtricitabine dose was 
recovered in urine as three metabolites. The systemic clearance of emtricitabine averaged 307 mL/min. 
Following oral administration, the elimination half-life of emtricitabine is approximately 10 hours.  
Tenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidney by both filtration and an active tubular transport system with 
approximately 70-80% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine following intravenous administration. The 
apparent clearance of tenofovir averaged approximately 307 mL/min. Renal clearance has been estimated to 
be approximately 210 mL/min, which is in excess of the glomerular filtration rate. This indicates that active 
tubular secretion is an important part of the elimination of tenofovir. Following oral administration, the 
elimination half-life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours.  
Elderly 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with emtricitabine or tenofovir (administered as tenofovir 
disoproxil) in the elderly (over 65 years of age).  
Gender 
Emtricitabine and tenofovir pharmacokinetics are similar in male and female patients.  
Ethnicity 
No clinically important pharmacokinetic difference due to ethnicity has been identified for emtricitabine. 
The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir (administered as tenofovir disoproxil) have not been specifically studied 
in different ethnic groups.  
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in children and 
adolescents (under 18 years of age). Steady-state pharmacokinetics of tenofovir were evaluated in 
8 HIV-1 infected adolescent patients (aged 12 to < 18 years) with body weight ≥ 35 kg and in 
23 HIV-1 infected children aged 2 to < 12 years. Tenofovir exposure achieved in these paediatric patients 
receiving oral daily doses of tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg or 6.5 mg/kg body weight tenofovir disoproxil up 
to a maximum dose of 245 mg was similar to exposures achieved in adults receiving once-daily doses of 
tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg. Pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with tenofovir disoproxil in 
children under 2 years. In general, the pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine in infants, children and adolescents 
(aged 4 months up to 18 years) are similar to those seen in adults. 
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir (administered as tenofovir disoproxil) are expected to 
be similar in HIV-1 infected and uninfected adolescents based on the similar exposures of emtricitabine and 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tenofovir in HIV-1 infected adolescents and adults, and the similar exposures of emtricitabine and tenofovir 
in HIV-1 infected and uninfected adults. 
Renal impairment 
Limited pharmacokinetic data are available for emtricitabine and tenofovir after co-administration of 
separate preparations or as a fixed-dose combination in patients with renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters were mainly determined following administration of single doses of emtricitabine 200 mg or 
tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to non-HIV infected subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment. The 
degree of renal impairment was defined according to baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) (normal renal 
function when CrCl > 80 mL/min; mild impairment with CrCl = 50-79 mL/min; moderate impairment with 
CrCl = 30-49 mL/min and severe impairment with CrCl = 10-29 mL/min).  
The mean (%CV) emtricitabine drug exposure increased from 12 (25%) μg•h/mL in subjects with normal 
renal function, to 20 (6%) μg•h/mL, 25 (23%) μg•h/mL and 34 (6%) μg•h/mL, in subjects with mild, 
moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively. The mean (%CV) tenofovir drug exposure increased 
from 2,185 (12%) ng•h/mL in subjects with normal renal function, to 3,064 (30%) ng•h/mL, 
6,009 (42%) ng•h/mL and 15,985 (45%) ng•h/mL, in subjects with mild, moderate and severe renal 
impairment, respectively.  
The increased dose interval for emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil in HIV-1 infected patients with moderate 
renal impairment is expected to result in higher peak plasma concentrations and lower Cmin levels as 
compared to patients with normal renal function. In subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring 
haemodialysis, between dialysis drug exposures substantially increased over 72 hours to 53 (19%) µg•h/mL 
of emtricitabine, and over 48 hours to 42,857 (29%) ng•h/mL of tenofovir. 
A small clinical study was conducted to evaluate the safety, antiviral activity and pharmacokinetics of 
tenofovir disoproxil in combination with emtricitabine in HIV infected patients with renal impairment. A 
subgroup of patients with baseline creatinine clearance between 50 and 60 mL/min, receiving once daily 
dosing, had a 2-4-fold increase in tenofovir exposure and worsening renal function.  
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine and tenofovir (administered as tenofovir disoproxil) in paediatric 
patients with renal impairment have not been studied. No data are available to make dose recommendations 
(see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil have not been studied in subjects with hepatic 
impairment.  
The pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine have not been studied in non-HBV infected subjects with varying 
degrees of hepatic insufficiency. In general, emtricitabine pharmacokinetics in HBV infected subjects were 
similar to those in healthy subjects and in HIV infected patients.  
A single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil was administered to non-HIV infected subjects with varying 
degrees of hepatic impairment defined according to Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) classification. Tenofovir 
pharmacokinetics were not substantially altered in subjects with hepatic impairment suggesting that no dose 
adjustment is required in these subjects. The mean (%CV) tenofovir Cmax and AUC0-∞ values were 
223 (34.8%) ng/mL and 2,050 (50.8%) ng•h/mL, respectively, in normal subjects compared with 
289 (46.0%) ng/mL and 2,310 (43.5%) ng•h/mL in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and 
305 (24.8%) ng/mL and 2,740 (44.0%) ng•h/mL in subjects with severe hepatic impairment.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Emtricitabine 
Non-clinical data on emtricitabine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of 
safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and toxicity to 
reproduction and development.  
Tenofovir disoproxil 
 Non-clinical safety pharmacology studies on tenofovir disoproxil reveal no special hazard for humans. 
Repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or equal to clinical 
exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use include renal and bone toxicity and a decrease in 
serum phosphate concentration. Bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced 
(BMD) (rats and dogs). The bone toxicity in young adult rats and dogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the 
exposure in paediatric or adult patients; bone toxicity occurred in juvenile infected monkeys at very high 
exposures following subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold the exposure in patients). Findings in the rat and 
monkey studies indicated that there was a substance-related decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate 
with potential secondary reduction in BMD. 
Genotoxicity studies revealed positive results in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay, equivocal results in one 
of the strains used in the Ames test, and weakly positive results in an UDS test in primary rat hepatocytes. 
However, it was negative in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.  
Oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an 
extremely high dose in mice. These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans.  
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or foetal 
parameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a peri and 
postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses.  
Combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil 
Genotoxicity and repeated dose toxicity studies of one month or less with the combination of these two 
components found no exacerbation of toxicological effects compared to studies with the separate 
components.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is and what it is used for 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan contains two active substances, emtricitabine and tenofovir 
disoproxil. Both of these active substances are antiretroviral medicines which are used to treat HIV 
infection. Emtricitabine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor. However, both are generally known as NRTIs and they work by interfering with the 
normal working of an enzyme (reverse transcriptase) that is essential for the virus to reproduce itself.  
 
 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 
(HIV-1) infection in adults.  
It is also used to treat HIV in adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg, 
and who have already been treated with other HIV medicines that are no longer effective or have 
caused side effects. 
- 
- 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should always be used combined with other 
medicines to treat HIV infection.  
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan can be administered in place of emtricitabine and 
tenofovir disoproxil used separately at the same doses. 
This medicine is not a cure for HIV infection. While taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan you 
may still develop infections or other illnesses associated with HIV infection. 
 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is also used to reduce the risk of getting HIV-1 
infection in adults, and adolescents aged 12 years to less than 18 years who weigh at least 35 kg, 
when used as a daily treatment, together with safer sex practices: 
See section 2 for a list of precautions to take against HIV infection. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
Do not take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan to treat HIV or to reduce the risk of getting 
HIV if you are allergic to emtricitabine, tenofovir, tenofovir disoproxil, or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
 If this applies to you, tell your doctor immediately. 
Before taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan to reduce the risk of getting HIV: 
This medicine can only help reduce your risk of getting HIV before you are infected. 
 
You must be HIV negative before you start to take this medicine to reduce the risk of getting 
HIV. You must get tested to make sure that you do not already have HIV infection. Do not take this 
medicine to reduce your risk unless you are confirmed to be HIV negative. People who do have HIV 
must take this medicine in combination with other drugs. 
  Many HIV tests can miss a recent infection. If you get a flu-like illness, it could mean you have 
recently been infected with HIV. These may be signs of HIV infection: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Tell your doctor about any flu-like illness – either in the month before starting this medicine, or 
tiredness 
fever 
joint or muscle aches 
headache 
vomiting or diarrhoea 
rash 
night sweats 
enlarged lymph nodes in the neck or groin 
at any time while taking this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions  
While taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan to reduce the risk of getting HIV: 
 
 
 
 
Take this medicine every day to reduce your risk, not just when you think you have been at risk of 
HIV infection. Do not miss any doses of Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan, or stop taking it. 
Missing doses may increase your risk of getting HIV infection. 
Get tested for HIV regularly. 
If you think you were infected with HIV, tell your doctor straight away. They may want to do more 
tests to make sure you are still HIV negative. 
Just taking this Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan may not stop you getting HIV. 
 
 
Always practice safer sex. Use condoms to reduce contact with semen, vaginal fluids, or blood. 
Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them, such as toothbrushes 
and razor blades. 
Do not share or re-use needles or other injection or drug equipment. 
Get tested for other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis and gonorrhoea. These 
infections make it easier for HIV to infect you. 
 
 
Ask your doctor if you have any more questions about how to prevent getting HIV or spreading HIV to other 
people.

While taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan to treat HIV or to reduce the risk of getting 
HIV: 
 
 
 
 
 
Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil may affect your kidneys. Before and during treatment, your 
doctor may order blood tests to measure kidney function. Tell your doctor if you have had kidney 
disease, or if tests have shown kidney problems. This medicine should not be given to adolescents 
with existing kidney problems. If you have kidney problems, your doctor may advise you to stop 
taking emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil or, if you already have HIV, to take emtricitabine/tenofovir 
disoproxil less frequently. Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil is not recommended if you have severe 
kidney disease or are on dialysis.  
Bone problems (manifesting as persistent or worsening bone pain and sometimes resulting in 
fractures) may also occur due to damage to kidney tubule cells (see section 4, Possible side effects). 
Tell your doctor if you have bone pain or fractures. 
Tenofovir disoproxil may also cause loss of bone mass.  The most pronounced bone loss was seen in 
clinical studies when patients were treated for HIV with tenofovir disoproxil in combination with a 
boosted protease inhibitor.  
Overall, the effects of tenofovir disoproxil on long term bone health and future fracture risk in adult 
and paediatric patients are uncertain.  
Tell your doctor if you know you suffer from osteoporosis.  Patients with osteoporosis are at a higher 
risk of fractures.  
Talk to your doctor if you have a history of liver disease, including hepatitis. Patients infected 
with HIV who also have liver disease (including chronic hepatitis B or C), who are treated with 
antiretrovirals, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal liver complications. If you have 
hepatitis B or C, your doctor will carefully consider the best treatment regimen for you. 
Know your hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection status before starting Emtricitabine/Tenofovir 
disoproxil Mylan. If you have HBV, there is a serious risk of liver problems when you stop taking 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil, whether or not you also have HIV. It is important not to stop taking 
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil without talking to your doctor: see section 3, Do not stop taking 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan. 
Talk to your doctor if you are over 65. Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil has not been studied in 
patients over 65 years of age. 
Talk to your doctor if you are intolerant to lactose (see Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
contains lactose later in this section). 
Children and adolescents 
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan is not for use in children under 12 years of age. 
Other medicines and Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan 
Do not take Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan if you are already taking other medicines that 
contain the components of this medicine (which are emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil), or any other 
antiviral medicines that contain tenofovir, alafenamide, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. 
Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with other medicines that can damage your 
kidneys: it is especially important to tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines, including 
 
aminoglycosides (for bacterial infection)  
58 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
amphotericin B (for fungal infection)  
foscarnet (for viral infection)  
ganciclovir (for viral infection)  
pentamidine (for infections)  
vancomycin (for bacterial infection)  
interleukin-2 (to treat cancer)  
cidofovir (for viral infection)  
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, to relieve bone or muscle pains) 
If you are taking another antiviral medicine called a protease inhibitor to treat HIV, your doctor may order 
blood tests to closely monitor your kidney function. 
It is also important to tell your doctor if you are taking ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir or 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir to treat hepatitis C infection. 
Taking Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with other medicines containing didanosine (for 
treatment of HIV infection): Taking emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil with other antiviral medicines that 
contain didanosine can raise the levels of didanosine in your blood and may reduce CD4 cell counts. Rarely, 
inflammation of the pancreas and lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood), which sometimes causes 
death, have been reported when medicines containing tenofovir disoproxil and didanosine were taken 
together. Your doctor will carefully consider whether to treat you with combinations of tenofovir and 
didanosine.  
 Tell your doctor if you are taking any of these medicines. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are 
taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines.  
Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan with food and drink 
  Whenever possible, Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil Mylan should be taken with food.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Possible serious side effects: 
 
 
 
Lactic acidosis (excess lactic acid in the blood) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect. 
Lactic acidosis occurs more often in women, particularly if they are overweight, and in people with 
liver disease. The following may be signs of lactic acidosis:  
 
 
 
 
deep rapid breathing 
drowsiness 
feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting)  
stomach pain 
 If you think you may have lactic acidosis, get medical help immediately.  
Any signs of inflammation or infection. In some patients with advanced HIV infection (AIDS) and a 
history of opportunistic infections (infections that occur in people with a weak immune system), signs 
and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti-HIV treatment is 
started. It is thought that these symptoms are due to an improvement in the body’s immune response, 
enabling the body to fight infections that may have been present with no obvious symptoms.  
Autoimmune disorders, when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue, may also occur after 
you start taking medicines to treat HIV infection. Autoimmune disorders may occur many months 
after the start of treatment. Look out for any symptoms of infection or other symptoms such as: 
-  muscle weakness 
-  weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up towards the trunk of the body 
-  palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity 
  If you notice these or any symptoms of inflammation or infection, get medical help 
immediately.

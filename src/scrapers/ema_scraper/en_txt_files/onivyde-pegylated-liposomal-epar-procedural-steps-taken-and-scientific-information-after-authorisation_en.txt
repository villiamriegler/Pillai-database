are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

working party (SWP) recommendations on the 
duration of contraception following the end of 
treatment with a genotoxic drug and to add a 
statement about the preservation of gametes. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to introduce 
minor changes to section 6.6 of the SmPC to provide 
clarification regarding the size of the needle to be 
used for the preparation of the infusion prior to 
administration. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly.

data 
contraception during ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal 
treatment and 7 months thereafter. Males should use 
condoms during ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal treatment 
and 4 months thereafter. 
There are no adequate data on the use of ONIVYDE 
pegylated liposomal in pregnant women. ONIVYDE 
pegylated liposomal can cause harm to the foetus when 
administered to the pregnant woman, as the main 
ingredient irinotecan has been shown to be embryotoxic 
and teratogenic in animals (see section 5.3). Therefore, 
based on results from animal studies and the mechanism of 
action of irinotecan, ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal should 
not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary. If 
ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal is used during pregnancy or 
if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving therapy, 
the patient should be informed about the potential hazard 
to the foetus. 
It is unknown whether ONIVYDE pegylated liposomal or its 
metabolites are excreted into human milk. Because of the 
potential for serious adverse reactions of ONIVYDE 
pegylated liposomal in breast feeding infants, ONIVYDE 
pegylated liposomal is contraindicated during breast 
feeding (see section 4.3). Patients should not breast-feed 
until one month after the last dose. 
There are no data on the impact of ONIVYDE pegylated 
liposomal on human fertility. Non liposomal irinotecan was 
shown to cause atrophy of male and female reproductive 
organs after multiple daily irinotecan doses in animals (see 
section 5.3). Prior to starting the administration of

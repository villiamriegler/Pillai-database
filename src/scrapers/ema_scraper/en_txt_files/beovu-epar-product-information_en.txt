CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Beovu is indicated in adults for the treatment of 
• 
• 
neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (see section 5.1), 
visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Beovu must be administered by a qualified ophthalmologist experienced in intravitreal injections. 
Posology 
Wet AMD 
Treatment initiation – loading 
The recommended dose is 6 mg brolucizumab (0.05 ml solution), administered by intravitreal 
injection every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 3 doses. A disease activity assessment is suggested 
16 weeks (4 months) after treatment start.

Alternatively, 6 mg brolucizumab (0.05 ml solution) may be administered every 6 weeks for the first 
2 doses. A disease activity assessment is suggested 12 weeks (3 months) after treatment start. A third 
dose may be administered based on disease activity as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical 
parameters at week 12. 
Maintenance treatment 
After the last loading dose, the physician may individualise treatment intervals based on disease activity 
as assessed by visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters. In patients without disease activity, 
treatment every 12 weeks (3 months) should be considered. In patients with disease activity, treatment 
every 8 weeks (2 months) should be considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
If visual and anatomical outcomes indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, 
Beovu should be discontinued. 
DME 
The recommended dose is 6 mg brolucizumab (0.05 ml solution) administered by intravitreal injection 
every 6 weeks for the first 5 doses. 
Thereafter, the physician may individualise treatment intervals based on disease activity as assessed by 
visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters. In patients without disease activity, treatment every 
12 weeks (3 months) should be considered. In patients with disease activity, treatment every 8 weeks 
(2 months) should be considered. After 12 months of treatment, in patients without disease activity, 
treatment intervals up to 16 weeks (4 months) could be considered (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
If visual and anatomical outcomes indicate that the patient is not benefiting from continued treatment, 
Beovu should be discontinued. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dosage adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years or above (see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Brolucizumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is 
required in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of brolucizumab in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Beovu is for intravitreal use only. 
The solution for injection should be inspected visually prior to administration (see section 6.6). 
The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the 
use of surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or 
equivalent). Sterile paracentesis equipment should be available as a precautionary measure. The 
patient’s medical history for hypersensitivity reactions should be carefully evaluated prior to 
performing the intravitreal procedure (see section 4.3). Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum 
topical microbicide to disinfect the periocular skin, eyelid and ocular surface should be administered 
prior to the injection. 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The injection needle should be inserted 3.5 to 4.0 mm posterior to the limbus into the vitreous cavity, 
avoiding the horizontal meridian and aiming towards the centre of the globe. The injection volume of 
0.05 ml is then delivered slowly; a different scleral site should be used for subsequent injections. 
Immediately following the intravitreal injection, patients should be monitored for elevation in 
intraocular pressure. Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve 
head or tonometry. If required, sterile equipment for paracentesis should be available. 
Following intravitreal injection patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of 
endophthalmitis (e.g. eye pain, redness of the eye, photophobia, blurring of vision) without delay. 
Pre-filled syringe 
The pre-filled syringe is for single use only. Each pre-filled syringe should only be used for the 
treatment of a single eye. 
Since the volume contained in the pre-filled syringe (0.165 ml) is greater than the recommended dose 
(0.05 ml), a portion of the volume contained in the pre-filled syringe must be discarded prior to 
administration. 
Injecting the entire volume of the pre-filled syringe could result in overdose. To expel the air bubble 
along with excess medicinal product, the plunger should be slowly depressed until the edge below the 
dome of the rubber stopper is aligned with the 0.05 ml dose mark (equivalent to 50 µl, i.e. 6 mg 
brolucizumab). 
Vial 
The vial is for single use only. Each vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye. 
Since the volume contained in the vial (0.23 ml) is greater than the recommended dose (0.05 ml), a 
portion of the volume contained in the vial must be discarded prior to administration. 
Injecting the entire volume of the vial could result in overdose. To expel the air bubble along with 
excess medicinal product, the air should be carefully expelled from the syringe and the dose adjusted 
to the 0.05 ml mark (equivalent to 50 µl, i.e. 6 mg brolucizumab). 
For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Patients with active or suspected ocular or periocular infections. 
Patients with active intraocular inflammation. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Endophthalmitis, intraocular inflammation, traumatic cataract, retinal detachment, retinal tear, retinal 
vasculitis, and/or retinal vascular occlusion 
Intravitreal injections, including those with Beovu, have been associated with endophthalmitis, 
intraocular inflammation, traumatic cataract, retinal detachment and retinal tear (see section 4.8). 
Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering Beovu. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of the above-mentioned events 
without delay. 
Intraocular inflammation, including retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion 
Intraocular inflammation, including retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, has been 
reported with the use of Beovu (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). A higher number of intraocular 
inflammation events were observed among patients with treatment-emergent antibodies. After 
investigation, retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion were found to be immune-mediated 
events. Intraocular inflammation, including retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, may 
occur following the first intravitreal injection and at any time of treatment. These events were 
observed more frequently at the beginning of the treatment. 
Based on clinical studies these events were more frequent in female patients treated with Beovu than 
male patients (e.g. 5.3% females vs. 3.2% males in HAWK and HARRIER) and in Japanese patients. 
In patients developing these events, treatment with Beovu should be discontinued and the events 
should be promptly managed. Patients treated with Beovu with a medical history of intraocular 
inflammation and/or retinal vascular occlusion (within 12 months prior to the first brolucizumab 
injection) should be closely monitored, since they are at increased risk of developing retinal vasculitis 
and/or retinal vascular occlusion. 
The interval between two Beovu doses during maintenance treatment should not be less than 8 weeks 
considering that a higher incidence of intraocular inflammation (including retinal vasculitis) and 
retinal vascular occlusion was reported in patients with nAMD who received Beovu every 4 week 
maintenance dosing in a clinical study compared to patients who received Beovu every 8 or 12 week 
maintenance dosing in the pivotal Phase III clinical studies. 
Intraocular pressure increases 
Transient increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 30 minutes of intravitreal injection 
with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, including brolucizumab (see section 4.8). 
Special precaution is needed in patients with poorly controlled glaucoma (do not inject Beovu while 
the intraocular pressure is ≥30 mmHg). Both intraocular pressure and perfusion of the optic nerve head 
must be monitored and managed appropriately. 
Bilateral treatment 
The safety and efficacy of brolucizumab administered in both eyes concurrently have not been studied. 
Immunogenicity 
As this is a therapeutic protein, there is a potential for immunogenicity with brolucizumab (see 
section 4.8). Patients should be instructed to inform their physician if they develop symptoms such as 
eye pain or increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or decreased vision, an increased 
number of small particles in their vision, or increased sensitivity to light (see section 4.8). 
Concomitant use of other anti-VEGF 
There are no data available on the concomitant use of Beovu with other anti-VEGF medicinal products 
in the same eye. Brolucizumab should not be administered concurrently with other anti-VEGF 
medicinal products (systemic or ocular). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Withholding treatment 
In intravitreal anti-VEGF treatments, the dose should be withheld and treatment should not be 
resumed earlier than the next scheduled treatment in the event of: 
• 
a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥30 letters compared with the last 
assessment of visual acuity; 
a retinal break; 
a subretinal haemorrhage involving the centre of the fovea, or, if the size of the haemorrhage is 
≥50% of the total lesion area; 
performed or planned intraocular surgery within the previous or next 28 days. 
• 
• 
• 
Retinal pigment epithelial tear 
Risk factors associated with the development of a retinal pigment epithelial tear after anti-VEGF 
therapy for wet AMD include a large and/or high pigment epithelial retinal detachment. When 
initiating brolucizumab therapy, caution should be used in patients with these risk factors for retinal 
pigment epithelial tears. 
Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or macular holes 
Treatment should be discontinued in subjects with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or stage 3 or 4 
macular holes. 
Systemic effects following intravitreal use 
Systemic adverse events, including non-ocular haemorrhages and arterial thromboembolic events, 
have been reported following intravitreal injection of VEGF inhibitors and there is a theoretical risk 
that these may relate to VEGF inhibition. There are limited data on safety in the treatment of patients 
with AMD and DME with a history of stroke, transient ischaemic attacks or myocardial infarction 
within the last 3 months. Caution should be exercised when treating such patients. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
Populations with limited data 
There is limited experience with Beovu treatment in diabetic patients with HbA1c greater than 10% or 
with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. There is also no experience of treatment with Beovu in diabetic 
patients with uncontrolled hypertension. This lack of information should be considered by the 
physician when treating such patients. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with 
brolucizumab and for at least one month after the last dose when stopping treatment with 
brolucizumab. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of brolucizumab in pregnant women. A study in 
pregnant cynomolgus monkeys did not indicate any harmful effects with respect to reproductive 
toxicity. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Although the systemic exposure after ocular administration is very low due to its mechanism of action, 
there is a potential risk to embryofoetal development. Therefore, brolucizumab should not be used 
during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether brolucizumab is excreted in human milk. In a reproductive toxicity study, 
brolucizumab was not detected in the maternal milk or infant serum of cynomolgus monkeys (see 
section 5.3). A risk to the breast-fed newborn/infant cannot be excluded. Brolucizumab is not 
recommended during breast-feeding and breast-feeding should not be started for at least one month 
after the last dose when stopping treatment with brolucizumab. A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from brolucizumab therapy, taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No reproductive or fertility studies have been conducted. VEGF inhibition has been shown to affect 
follicular development, corpus luteum function and fertility. Based on the mechanism of action of 
VEGF inhibitiors, there is a potential risk for female reproduction. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Beovu has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines due to possible temporary visual 
disturbances following the intravitreal injection and the associated eye examination. Patients should 
not drive or use machines until visual function has recovered sufficiently. 
4.8  Undesirable effects

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Immunogenicity 
There is a potential for an immune response in patients treated with Beovu. 
Wet AMD 
After dosing with Beovu for 88 weeks, treatment-emergent anti-brolucizumab antibodies were 
detected in 23–25% of patients. 
DME 
After dosing with Beovu for 96 weeks, treatment-emergent anti-brolucizumab antibodies were detected 
in 16-23% of patients. 
Among AMD and DME patients with treatment-emergent antibodies, a higher number of intraocular 
inflammation adverse reactions were observed. After investigation, retinal vasculitis and/or retinal 
vascular occlusion, typically in the presence of intraocular inflammation, were found to be 
immune-mediated adverse events related to exposure to Beovu (see section 4.4). Anti-brolucizumab 
antibodies were not associated with an impact on clinical efficacy. 
Product-class-related adverse reactions 
There is a theoretical risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including stroke and myocardial 
infarction, following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. A low incidence rate of arterial 
thromboembolic events was observed in the brolucizumab clinical studies in patients with AMD and 
DME. There were no major notable differences between the groups treated with brolucizumab and 
comparator. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdosing with greater than recommended injection volume may increase intraocular pressure. In the 
event of overdose, intraocular pressure should therefore be monitored and, if deemed necessary by the 
treating physician, appropriate treatment should be initiated.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Ophthalmologicals, antineovascularisation agents, ATC code: S01LA06 
Mechanism of action 
Brolucizumab is a humanised monoclonal single chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragment with a molecular 
weight of ~26 kDa. 
Increased levels of signalling through the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) pathway are 
associated with pathological ocular angiogenesis and retinal oedema. Brolucizumab binds with high 
affinity to VEGF-A isoforms (e.g. VEGF110, VEGF121, and VEGF165), thereby preventing binding of 
VEGF-A to its receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. By inhibiting VEGF-A binding, brolucizumab 
suppresses endothelial cell proliferation, thereby reducing pathological neovascularisation and 
decreasing vascular permeability.

Pharmacodynamic effects 
Wet AMD 
In the HAWK and HARRIER studies, anatomical parameters related to leakage of blood and fluid that 
characterise choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) were part of the disease activity assessments guiding 
treatment decisions. Reductions in central subfield thickness (CST) and in presence of 
intraretinal/subretinal fluid (IRF/SRF) or sub-retinal pigment epithelium (sub-RPE) fluid were 
observed in patients treated with Beovu as early as 4 weeks after treatment initiation and up to 
week 48 and week 96. 
At week 16, the reduction in CST was statistically significant on Beovu versus aflibercept in both 
studies (HAWK: -161 vs. -134 microns; HARRIER: -174 vs. -134 microns). This decrease from 
baseline in CST was also statistically significant at week 48 (HAWK: -173 vs. -144 microns; 
HARRIER: -194 vs. -144 microns), and maintained to the end of each study at week 96 (HAWK: -175 
vs. -149 microns; HARRIER: -198 vs. -155 microns). 
At week 16, the percentage difference in patients with IRF and/or SRF fluid was statistically 
significant on Beovu versus aflibercept in both studies (HAWK: 34% vs. 52%; HARRIER: 29% vs. 
45%). This difference was also statistically significant at week 48 (HAWK: 31% vs. 45%; HARRIER: 
26% vs. 44%), and maintained to the end of each study at week 96 (HAWK: 24% vs. 37%; 
HARRIER: 24% vs. 39%). 
At week 16, the percentage difference in patients with sub-RPE fluid was statistically significant on 
Beovu versus aflibercept in both studies (HAWK: 19% vs. 27%; HARRIER: 16% vs. 24%). This 
difference was also statistically significant at week 48 (HAWK: 14% vs. 22%; HARRIER: 13% vs. 
22%), and maintained to the end of each study at week 96 (HAWK: 11% vs. 15%; HARRIER: 17% 
vs. 22%). 
In these studies, for patients treated with Beovu, reductions in CNV lesion size were observed as early 
as 12 weeks, and at weeks 48 and 96 after treatment initiation. 
DME 
In the KESTREL and KITE studies, related anatomical parameters were part of the disease activity 
assessments guiding treatment decisions. Reductions in CST and in presence of IRF/SRF were 
observed in patients treated with Beovu as early as 4 weeks after treatment initiation and up to 
week 52. These reductions were maintained up to week 100. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Wet AMD 
The efficacy and safety of Beovu were assessed in two randomised, multicentre, double-masked, 
active-controlled Phase III studies (HAWK and HARRIER) in patients with neovascular (wet) AMD. 
A total of 1,817 patients were treated in these studies for two years (1 088 on Beovu and 729 on 
comparator aflibercept). Patient ages ranged from 50 to 97 years, with a mean age of 76 years. 
In both studies, after the first three monthly doses (weeks 0, 4 and 8), brolucizumab patients were 
treated every 12 weeks, with the option of adjusting to a dosing interval every 8 weeks based on 
disease activity. Disease activity was assessed by a physician during the first 12-week interval (at 
weeks 16 and 20) and at each subsequent scheduled 12-weekly treatment visit. Patients who showed 
disease activity (e.g. decreased visual acuity, increased CST and/or presence of IRF/SRF or sub-RPE 
fluid) at any of these visits were adjusted to an 8-weekly treatment interval. The comparator 
aflibercept was administered every 8 weeks after the first 3 monthly doses.

Results 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the studies was the change from baseline in best corrected visual 
acuity (BCVA) to week 48, as measured by the early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) 
letter score, with the primary objective being to demonstrate non-inferiority of Beovu versus 
aflibercept. In both studies, Beovu (administered in an every 12 weeks or an every 8 weeks regimen) 
demonstrated non-inferior efficacy to aflibercept 2 mg (administered every 8 weeks). The visual acuity 
gains observed in the first year were maintained in the second year. 
Detailed results of both studies are shown in Table 2 and in Figure 1 below.

These visual acuity gains were achieved with 56% and 51% of patients treated with Beovu on a 
12-weekly dosing interval at week 48, and with 45% and 39% of patients at week 96 in HAWK and 
HARRIER, respectively. Among patients identified as eligible for the 12-weekly regimen during the 
first 12-week interval, 85% and 82% remained on the 12-weekly dosing interval up to week 48. Of 
patients on the 12-weekly interval at week 48, 82% and 75% remained on the 12-weekly dosing 
interval up to week 96. 
Treatment effects in evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, race, baseline visual acuity, baseline 
retinal thickness, lesion type, lesion size, fluid status) in each study were generally consistent with the 
results in the overall populations. 
Disease activity was assessed by changes in visual acuity and/or anatomical parameters, including 
CST and/or presence of IRF/SRF or sub-RPE. Disease activity was assessed throughout the studies. 
Anatomical parameters of disease activity were decreased at week 48 and at week 96 for Beovu 
compared to aflibercept (see “Pharmacodynamic effects”). 
The percentage difference in patients with disease activity at week 16 was statistically significant on 
Beovu versus aflibercept (24% vs 35% in HAWK, p=0.0013; 23% vs 32% in HARRIER, p=0.0021). 
In both studies, Beovu demonstrated clinically meaningful increases from baseline in the pre-specified 
secondary efficacy endpoint of patient-reported outcomes, reported through the National Eye Institute 
Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25). The magnitude of these changes was similar to that 
seen in published studies, which corresponded to a 15-letter gain in BCVA. Patient-reported outcome 
benefits were maintained in the second year. 
No clinically meaningful differences were found between Beovu and aflibercept in changes from 
baseline to week 48 in NEI VFQ-25 total score and subscales (general vision, ocular pain, near 
activities, distance activities, social functioning, mental health, role difficulties, dependency, driving, 
colour vision and peripheral vision). 
The results of the Beovu arms of the HAWK and HARRIER studies, where Beovu was administered 
every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 3 doses (loading) followed by maintenance dosing every 12 or 
8 weeks, were replicated in a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model simulation study 
where Beovu was administered every 6 weeks for the first 2 or 3 doses (loading) followed by 
maintenance dosing every 12 or 8 weeks. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DME 
The efficacy and safety of Beovu were assessed in two randomised, multicentre, double-masked, 
active-controlled Phase III studies (KESTREL and KITE) in patients with visual impairment due to 
diabetic macular oedema. A total of 926 patients were treated in these studies for two years (558 on 
brolucizumab and 368 on aflibercept 2 mg). Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years, with a mean age 
of 63 years. 
In both studies, after the first five doses (weeks 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24), brolucizumab patients were 
treated every 12 weeks, with the option of adjusting to a dosing interval every 8 weeks based on 
disease activity. Disease activity was assessed by a physician during the first 12-week interval (at 
weeks 32 and 36) and at each subsequent scheduled treatment visit. Patients who showed disease 
activity (e.g. decreased visual acuity, increased CST) at any of these visits were adjusted to an every 
8 weeks treatment interval. In year 2 of KITE, patients who showed no disease activity could be 
extended to a 16-week treatment interval. The comparator aflibercept was administered every 8 weeks 
after the first 5 monthly doses. 
Results 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the studies was the change from baseline in BCVA to week 52, as 
measured by the ETDRS letter score, with the primary objective being to demonstrate non-inferiority 
of Beovu versus aflibercept 2 mg. In both studies, Beovu (administered in an every 12 weeks or an 
every 8 weeks regimen) demonstrated non-inferior efficacy to aflibercept 2 mg (administered every 
8 weeks). 
The results of KESTREL and KITE also demonstrated non-inferiority of Beovu versus aflibercept 
2 mg for the key secondary endpoint (average change from baseline in BVCA over the period week 40 
to week 52). 
The visual acuity gains observed in the first year were maintained in the second year. 
Detailed results of both studies are shown in Table 3 and in Figure 2 below.

Time (weeks)
Beovu 6mg (N=179)
Aflibercept 2mg (N=181)
These visual acuity gains were achieved with 55% and 50% of patients treated with Beovu on a 
12-weekly dosing interval at week 52, and 44% and 37% of patients treated with Beovu on a 
12-weekly or 12-weekly/16-weekly dosing interval at week 100 in KESTREL and KITE, respectively. 
Among patients identified as eligible for the 12-weekly regimen during the first 12-week interval, 
approximately 70% remained on at least the 12-weekly interval at week 100 in both studies. In KITE, 
25% of patients were treated with Beovu on a 16-weekly dosing interval at week 100. 
Treatment effects in evaluable subgroups (e.g. age, gender, baseline HbA1c, baseline visual acuity, 
baseline central subfield thickness, DME lesion type, duration of DME since diagnosis, retinal fluid 
status) in each study were generally consistent with the results in the overall populations.

In KESTREL and KITE, disease activity was assessed throughout the studies by changes in visual 
acuity and/or anatomical parameters, including CST and/or presence of IRF/SRF. The reduction in 
CST from baseline was maintained up to week 100. At week 100, the proportion of patients with 
IRF/SRF was lower in patients treated with Beovu (42% KESTREL and 41% KITE) compared to 
patients treated with aflibercept 2 mg (54% KESTREL and 57% KITE). 
Diabetic retinopathy severity score (DRSS) was assessed in the KESTREL and KITE studies. At 
baseline, 98.1% of patients in both KESTREL and KITE had gradable DRSS scores. Based on the 
pooled analysis, Beovu showed non-inferiority to aflibercept 2 mg in the proportion of subjects with at 
least a 2-step improvement from baseline in DRSS at week 52, using a non-inferiority margin of 10%. 
Estimated proportions were 28.9% and 24.9% in Beovu and aflibercept 2 mg, respectively, resulting in 
a treatment difference of 4.0% (95% CI: [-0.6, 8.6]). At week 100, the proportion of patients with a 
≥2-step improvement from baseline to week 100 in the DRSS score was 32.8% with Beovu and 29.3% 
with aflibercept 2 mg in KESTREL and 35.8% with Beovu and 31.1% with aflibercept 2 mg in KITE. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Beovu in all subsets of the paediatric population in neovascular AMD and DME (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Beovu is administered directly into the vitreous to exert local effects in the eye. 
Absorption and distribution 
After intravitreal administration of 6 mg brolucizumab per eye to patients with nAMD, the geometirc 
mean Cmax of free brolucizumab in the plasma was 49.0 ng/ml (range: 8.97 to 548 ng/ml) and was 
attained in 1 day. 
Biotransformation and elimination 
Brolucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment and no metabolism studies have been conducted. As 
a single-chain antibody fragment, free brolucizumab is expected to undergo elimination through both 
target-mediated disposition via binding to free endogenous VEGF, passive renal elimination and 
metabolism via proteolysis. 
After intravitreal injections, brolucizumab was eliminated with an apparent systemic half-life of 
4.3 ± 1.9 days. Concentrations were generally near or below the quantitation limit (<0.5 ng/ml) 
approximately 4 weeks after dosing in most patients. Brolucizumab did not accumulate in the serum 
when administered intravitreally every 4 weeks. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There were no relevant differences in systemic pharmacokinetics following intravitreal injection in a 
study with 22 patients aged 65 to 74 years, 18 patients aged 75 to 84 years and 3 patients aged 
≥85 years. 
Renal impairment 
The systemic pharmacokinetics of brolucizumab was evaluated in nAMD patients with normal renal 
function (≥90 ml/min [n=21]), with mild (60 to <90 ml/min [n=22]) or moderate (30 to <60 ml/min 
[n=7]) renal impairment. While the mean systemic clearance values for patients with mild or moderate 
renal impairment were generally lower than patients with normal renal function, no significant impact 
of mild and moderate renal impairment on the overall systemic exposure to brolucizumab was 
observed. No patients with severe (<30 ml/min) renal impairment were studied. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Brolucizumab has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Mild to severe hepatic 
impairment should have no impact on the overall systemic exposure to brolucizumab, because 
metabolism occurs via proteolysis and does not depend on hepatic function. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No studies have been conducted on the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of brolucizumab. 
In pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, brolucizumab was administered once every 4 weeks by intravitreal 
injection at dose levels resulting in maximal systemic exposures 6-fold higher than those in humans at 
the maximum recommended dose (based on serum Cmax). There was no impact on embryofoetal 
development, pregnancy or parturition, or on the survival, growth or postnatal development of 
offspring. Nevertheless, based on its pharmacological effect, brolucizumab should be regarded as 
potentially teratogenic and embryo-foetotoxic.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Beovu is and what it is used for 
What Beovu is 
Beovu contains the active substance brolucizumab, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents. Beovu is injected into the eye by your doctor to treat eye conditions 
which may impact your vision. 
Abnormal blood vessels 
that leak fluid or blood 
into the macula 
What Beovu is used for 
Beovu is used to treat eye conditions in adults which occur when abnormal blood vessels form and 
grow underneath the macula. The macula, which is at the back of the eye, is responsible for clear 
vision. The abnormal blood vessels may leak fluid or blood into the eye and interfere with the 
macula’s function, resulting in diseases which may cause decreased vision such as: 
• 
• 
wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) 
diabetic macular oedema (DME) 
How Beovu works 
Beovu may slow down disease progression and thereby maintain, or even improve, your vision. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Beovu 
You must not be given Beovu: 
- 
if you are allergic to brolucizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have an active or suspected infection in or around the eye. 
if you have pain or redness in your eye (eye inflammation). 
- 
- 
If any of these applies to you, tell your doctor. You should not be given Beovu. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Beovu if any of the following applies to you: 
- 
- 
if you have glaucoma (an eye condition usually caused by high pressure in the eye). 
if you have a history of seeing flashes of light or floaters (dark floating spots) and if you have a 
sudden increase in the size and number of floaters. 
if you have had eye surgery in the last 4 weeks or if eye surgery is planned in the next four 
weeks. 
if you have ever had any eye diseases or eye treatments. 
if you have a history of sudden vision loss due to blockage of blood vessels in the back of the 
eye (retinal vascular occlusion) or inflammation of blood vessels in the back of the eye (retinal 
vasculitis) in the last year. 
- 
- 
- 
Tell your doctor immediately if you: 
- 
develop redness of the eye, eye pain, increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or 
decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in your vision, increased sensitivity to 
light. 
develop sudden vision loss, which could be a sign of retinal vascular occlusion. 
- 
Any of the above symptoms may result in your doctor discontinuing your treatment with Beovu. 
Furthermore it is important for you to know that: 
- 
- 
- 
the safety and efficacy of Beovu when administered to both eyes at the same time has not been 
studied and use in this way may lead to an increased risk of experiencing side effects. 
injections with Beovu may cause an increase in eye pressure (intraocular pressure) in some 
patients within 30 minutes of the injection. Your doctor will monitor this after each injection. 
your doctor will check whether you have other risk factors that may increase the chance of a 
tear or detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear, and 
retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), in which case Beovu must be given with caution. 
The systemic use of VEGF inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in Beovu, is potentially 
related to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events), which may 
lead to heart attack or stroke. There is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of Beovu 
into the eye. 
Children and adolescents 
Beovu is not used in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Beovu 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before this medicine is given to you. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Beovu and for at least one month after 
stopping treatment with Beovu because it is not known whether Beovu passes into human milk. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Women who could become pregnant must use an effective method of birth control during treatment 
and for at least one month after stopping treatment with Beovu. If you become pregnant or think you 
are pregnant during treatment, tell your doctor right away. 
Driving and using machines 
After your injection with Beovu, you may have temporary vision problems (for example blurred 
vision). Do not drive or use machines as long as these last. 
Beovu contains sodium 
The medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”.

Method of administration 
Beovu is given as an injection into your eye (intravitreal use) by an eye doctor. 
Before the injection, your doctor will clean your eye carefully, to prevent infection. Your doctor will 
also give you an eye drop (local anaesthetic) to numb the eye to reduce or prevent pain from the 
injection. 
How long does Beovu treatment last for 
Beovu is used to treat chronic eye diseases which require long-term treatment, possibly continuing for 
months or years. Your doctor will check that the treatment is working during your regular scheduled 
visits. Your doctor may also check on your eyes between injections. If you have questions about how 
long you will receive Beovu, talk to your doctor. 
Before stopping Beovu treatment 
Speak with your doctor before stopping treatment. Stopping treatment may increase your risk of vision 
loss and your vision may worsen. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Instruction for use of pre-filled syringe 
Storage and inspection 
Store Beovu in the refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Keep the 
pre-filled syringe in its sealed blister and the outer carton in order to 
protect from light. 
Prior to use, the unopened blister with the pre-filled syringe of Beovu 
may be kept at room temperature (below 25°C) for up to 24 hours. 
Make sure that your pack contains a sterile pre-filled syringe in a 
sealed blister. After opening the blister pack, proceed under aseptic 
conditions. 
Beovu is a clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to slightly 
brownish-yellow aqueous solution. 
The solution should be inspected visually upon removal from the 
refrigerator and prior to administration. If particulates or cloudiness 
are visible, the pre-filled syringe must not be used and appropriate 
replacement procedures followed. 
The pre-filled syringe is sterile and for single use only. Do not use if 
the packaging or pre-filled syringe are damaged or expired. 
How to prepare and administer Beovu 
The pre-filled syringe contains more than the recommended dose of 6 mg. The extractable volume of 
the pre-filled syringe (0.165 ml) is not to be used in total. The excess volume should be expelled prior 
to injection. Injecting the entire volume of the pre-filled syringe could result in overdose. 
The intravitreal injection procedure must be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the 
use of surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape, a sterile eyelid speculum (or 
equivalent) and the availability of sterile paracentesis equipment (if required). 
Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the periocular skin, eyelid 
and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection. 
For intravitreal injection, use a 30G x ½” sterile injection needle. The injection needle is not included 
in the Beovu pack. 
Ensure that the injection is given immediately after preparation of the dose (step 5). 
Note: The dose must be set to 0.05 ml.

4. 
5. 
6. 
Peel the lid off the syringe blister and, using aseptic 
technique, remove the syringe. 
Snap off (do not turn or twist) the syringe cap. 
Aseptically and firmly assemble a 30G x ½” injection needle 
onto the syringe. 
To check for air bubbles, hold the syringe with the needle 
pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe 
with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top. 
Carefully remove the needle cap by pulling it straight off. 
Hold the syringe at eye level and carefully push the plunger 
until the edge below the dome of the rubber stopper is aligned 
with the 0.05 ml dose mark. This will expel the air and the 
excess solution and set the dose to 0.05 ml. The syringe is 
ready for the injection. 
Inject slowly until the rubber stopper reaches the end of the 
syringe to deliver the volume of 0.05 ml. Confirm delivery of 
the full dose by checking that the rubber stopper has reached 
the end of the syringe barrel. 
Note: Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commonly asked questions and answers 
Q: What if I cannot remove all the air bubbles from the liquid? 
A: It is important that the liquid is air free. However, tiny air bubbles that are attached to the stopper 
usually do not detach from the stopper during the injection and therefore do not affect the dose 
volume.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Beovu is and what it is used for 
What Beovu is 
Beovu contains the active substance brolucizumab, which belongs to a group of medicines called 
antineovascularisation agents. Beovu is injected into the eye by your doctor to treat eye conditions 
which may impact your vision. 
Abnormal blood vessels 
that leak fluid or blood 
into the macula 
What Beovu is used for 
Beovu is used to treat eye conditions in adults which occur when abnormal blood vessels form and 
grow underneath the macula. The macula, which is at the back of the eye, is responsible for clear 
vision. The abnormal blood vessels may leak fluid or blood into the eye and interfere with the 
macula’s function, resulting in diseases which may cause decreased vision such as: 
• 
• 
wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) 
diabetic macular oedema (DME) 
How Beovu works 
Beovu may slow down disease progression and thereby maintain, or even improve, your vision.

2.  What you need to know before you are given Beovu 
You must not be given Beovu: 
- 
if you are allergic to brolucizumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you have an active or suspected infection in or around the eye. 
if you have pain or redness in your eye (eye inflammation). 
- 
- 
If any of these applies to you, tell your doctor. You should not be given Beovu. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before you are given Beovu if any of the following applies to you: 
- 
- 
if you have glaucoma (an eye condition usually caused by high pressure in the eye). 
if you have a history of seeing flashes of light or floaters (dark floating spots) and if you have a 
sudden increase in the size and number of floaters. 
if you have had eye surgery in the last 4 weeks or if eye surgery is planned in the next four 
weeks. 
if you have ever had any eye diseases or eye treatments. 
if you have a history of sudden vision loss due to blockage of blood vessels in the back of the 
eye (retinal vascular occlusion) or inflammation of blood vessels in the back of the eye (retinal 
vasculitis) in the last year. 
- 
- 
- 
Tell your doctor immediately if you: 
- 
develop redness of the eye, eye pain, increased discomfort, worsening eye redness, blurred or 
decreased vision, an increased number of small particles in your vision, increased sensitivity to 
light. 
develop sudden vision loss, which could be a sign of retinal vascular occlusion. 
- 
Any of the above symptoms may result in your doctor discontinuing your treatment with Beovu. 
Furthermore it is important for you to know that: 
- 
- 
- 
the safety and efficacy of Beovu when administered to both eyes at the same time has not been 
studied and use in this way may lead to an increased risk of experiencing side effects. 
injections with Beovu may cause an increase in eye pressure (intraocular pressure) in some 
patients within 30 minutes of the injection. Your doctor will monitor this after each injection. 
your doctor will check whether you have other risk factors that may increase the chance of a 
tear or detachment of one of the layers at the back of the eye (retinal detachment or tear, and 
retinal pigment epithelial detachment or tear), in which case Beovu must be given with caution. 
The systemic use of VEGF inhibitors, substances similar to those contained in Beovu, is potentially 
related to the risk of blood clots blocking blood vessels (arterial thromboembolic events), which may 
lead to heart attack or stroke. There is a theoretical risk of such events following injection of Beovu 
into the eye. 
Children and adolescents 
Beovu is not used in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Beovu 
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think that you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, 
ask your doctor for advice before this medicine is given to you. 
Breast-feeding is not recommended during treatment with Beovu and for at least one month after 
stopping treatment with Beovu because it is not known whether Beovu passes into human milk. 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Women who could become pregnant must use an effective method of birth control during treatment 
and for at least one month after stopping treatment with Beovu. If you become pregnant or think you 
are pregnant during treatment, tell your doctor right away. 
Driving and using machines 
After your injection with Beovu, you may have temporary vision problems (for example blurred 
vision). Do not drive or use machines as long as these last. 
Beovu contains sodium 
The medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”.

Method of administration 
Beovu is given as an injection into your eye (intravitreal use) by an eye doctor. 
Before the injection, your doctor will clean your eye carefully, to prevent infection. Your doctor will 
also give you an eye drop (local anaesthetic) to numb the eye to reduce or prevent pain from the 
injection. 
How long does Beovu treatment last for 
Beovu is used to treat chronic eye diseases which require long-term treatment, possibly continuing for 
months or years. Your doctor will check that the treatment is working during your regular scheduled 
visits. Your doctor may also check on your eyes between injections. If you have questions about how 
long you will receive Beovu, talk to your doctor. 
Before stopping Beovu treatment 
Speak with your doctor before stopping treatment. Stopping treatment may increase your risk of vision 
loss and your vision may worsen. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.

Instructions for use of vial 
Storage and inspection 
Store Beovu in the refrigerator (2°C - 8°C). Do not freeze. Keep the vial 
in the outer carton in order to protect from light. 
Prior to use, the unopened vial of Beovu may be kept at room 
temperature (below 25°C) for up to 24 hours. After opening the vial, 
proceed under aseptic conditions. 
Beovu is a clear to slightly opalescent and colourless to slightly 
brownish-yellow aqueous solution. 
The solution should be inspected visually upon removal from the 
refrigerator and prior to administration. If particulates or cloudiness are 
visible, the vial must not be used and appropriate replacement procedures 
followed. 
The contents of the vial and the filter needle are sterile and for single use 
only. Do not use if the packaging, vial and/or filter needle are damaged 
or expired. 
How to prepare and administer Beovu 
The vial contains more than the recommended dose of 6 mg. The extractable volume of the vial 
(0.23 ml) is not to be used in total. The excess volume should be expelled prior to injection. Injecting 
the entire volume of the vial could result in overdose. 
The intravitreal injection procedure must be carried out under aseptic conditions, which includes the 
use of surgical hand disinfection, sterile gloves, a sterile drape and a sterile eyelid speculum (or 
equivalent) and the availability of sterile paracentesis equipment (if required). 
Adequate anaesthesia and a broad-spectrum topical microbicide to disinfect the periocular skin, eyelid 
and ocular surface should be administered prior to the injection. 
For preparation and intravitreal injection, the following single-use medical devices are needed: 
• 
• 
• 
A 30G x ½” injection needle, sterile. 
A 1 ml syringe with a 0.05 ml dose mark, sterile. 
The 5 μm blunt filter needle (18G x 1½”, 1.2 mm x 40 mm), sterile. 
The injection needle and the syringe are not included in the Beovu pack. 
Ensure that the injection is given immediately after preparation of the dose (step 8). 
Note: The dose must be set to 0.05 ml.

3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
Remove the vial cap and clean the vial septum (e.g. with 
70% alcohol swab). 
Assemble the filter needle onto a 1 ml syringe using aseptic 
technique. 
Push the filter needle into the centre of the vial septum until 
the needle touches the bottom of the vial. 
To withdraw the liquid, hold the vial slightly inclined and 
slowly withdraw all the liquid from the vial and filter needle. 
Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when 
emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter 
needle. 
Disconnect the filter needle from the syringe in an aseptic 
manner and dispose of it. The filter needle is not to be used 
for intravitreal injection. 
Aseptically and firmly assemble a 30G x ½” injection needle 
onto the syringe. 
To check for air bubbles, hold the syringe with the needle 
pointing up. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the 
syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top.

8. 
9. 
Hold the syringe at eye level and carefully push the plunger 
to expel the air along with the excess solution from the 
syringe and adjust the dose to the 0.05 ml mark. The syringe 
is ready for the injection. 
Inject slowly until the rubber stopper reaches the end of the 
syringe to deliver the volume of 0.05 ml. Confirm delivery 
of the full dose by checking that the rubber stopper has 
reached the end of the syringe barrel. 
Note: Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements. 
Commonly asked questions and answers 
Q: What if I have difficulty withdrawing sufficient liquid from the vial? 
A: Do not shake the vial before withdrawal but let the liquid settle to the bottom of the vial. Ensure the 
vial is in an upright, slightly inclined position. Slowly withdraw the plunger and wait for the liquid to 
appear in the syringe barrel. Continue to withdraw slowly to completely empty the vial and the filter 
needle. 
Q: What if I cannot remove all the air bubbles from the liquid? 
A: It is important that the liquid is air free. However, tiny air bubbles that are attached to the stopper 
usually do not detach from the stopper during the injection and therefore do not affect the dose 
volume.

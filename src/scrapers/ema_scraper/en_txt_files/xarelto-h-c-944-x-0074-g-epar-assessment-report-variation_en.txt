2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This application concerns a new, paediatric indication that pertains to treatment of VTE and prevention of VTE 
recurrence in children and adolescents as well as a new formulation: granules for oral suspension. The 
application is supported by extrapolation of data from approved adult indications as well as separate 
paediatric studies as outlined in the PIP. 
For the already approved 15 and 20 mg tablets, the sought indication was: 
15 mg tablets 
Paediatric population  
Treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of VTE recurrence in children and adolescents 
aged less than 18 years and weighing from 30 kg to 50 kg following initiation of standard anticoagulation 
treatment. 
20 mg tablets 
Paediatric population  
Treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of VTE recurrence in children and adolescents 
aged less than 18 years and weighing more than 50 kg following initiation of standard anticoagulation 
treatment 
For the new granules for oral suspension, the sought indication was: 
Treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of VTE recurrence in term neonates, infants 
and toddlers, children, and adolescents aged less than 18 years following initiation of standard 
anticoagulation treatment.

2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Venous thrombosis in children is rare, with an incidence at about 100 times lower than in adults. An annual 
incidence of VTE of between 53-57 per 100 000 has been reported among hospitalized children and between 
1.4-4.9 per 100 000 in the community overall. The distribution of events is bimodal with the majority 
occurring in neonates/infants and in adolescents. Idiopathic paediatric venous thromboses are very 
uncommon; more than 90 per cent of children who experience a VTE have been described to have a serious 
underlying disease including malignancy, congenital heart disease and nephrotic syndrome; a hereditary pro-
thrombotic condition; or a precipitating factor such as surgery, infection, trauma or an indwelling catheter 
such as central venous catheter (CVC). In adolescents, hormonal contraception is a common triggering factor 
for VTE. The only randomized study on the treatment of venous thrombosis in children conducted so far (the 
REVIVE study) confirmed that cancer and infections, followed by congenital heart disease, were the most 
frequently reported risk factors.  In the REVIVE study, children with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis were 
excluded due to lack of consensus on the need for anticoagulation.  Risk factors for recurrent VTE as reported 
in the European collaborative paediatric database on cerebral venous thrombosis include age at onset, 
absence of anticoagulant treatment, persistent venous occlusion, or presence of the prothrombin gene 
mutation. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
The coagulation system differs in neonates and infants aged < 6 months, as compared to older children and 
adults. At birth, the plasma levels of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X) are only half of 
the adult values, and increase during the first 6-12 months of life but remain at about 15% lower levels 
throughout childhood as compared to adults. The capacity to generate thrombin is decreased, whereas the 
capacity to inhibit thrombin is enhanced throughout childhood as compared to adults. The aetiology of VTE is 
based on Virchow’s triad including stasis, endothelial injury and hypercoagulability. For catheter-related 
thromboses, intravenous catheters cause endothelial trauma and inflammation and are often placed in 
patients who are hypercoagulable, leading to venous thrombosis. (Albisetti M et al 2020). For cerebral vein 
and sinus thrombosis, the pathogenesis has not been fully characterised. The mechanisms that contribute to 
the clinical features of CVST include obstruction of blood drainage from brain tissue, leading to parenchymal 
lesions and an increased venous and capillary pressure that could disrupt the blood-brain barrier, and 
occlusion of dural sinuses resulting in decreased CSF absorption and elevated intracranial pressure. (Ferro J 
et al 2020). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Paediatric VTE is rarely idiopathic, occurring in subjects with a high additional burden of disease. Location of 
VTE differs, with neonates and young children more often experiencing upper venous system VTE (most 
frequently CVC-related VTE), as compared to adolescents and adults. Deep vein thrombosis usually presents 
in the lower extremities similar to adults. Pulmonary embolism is relatively rare in children as compared to 
adults. Renal vein thrombosis most commonly occurs secondary to nephrotic syndrome or renal 
transplantation (Albisetti M 2020). Ultrasonography is the preferred initial diagnostic study; alternative 
imaging modalities include contrast venography, MRI or CT (Albisetti M 2020).  
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 9/86 
  
  
 
 
The risk of recurrence for paediatric VTE ranges from 7 to 20 percent, however, recurrence is uncommon if 
the underlying cause is removed or resolved. A prothrombotic state appears to be a predictor of VTE 
recurrence among children with unprovoked VTE, however, recurrence risk relating to a prothrombotic state 
is uncertain in children <2 years of age. (Albisetti M et al 2020). 
2.1.5.  Management 
The aim of VTE therapy is generally to prevent disease progression (including prevention of occurrence of 
severe manifestations such as pulmonary embolism) prevent VTE recurrence and the development of 
sequelae such as post thrombotic syndrome. 
The current standard of care of paediatric VTE is based upon a moderate level of evidence, including 
parenteral treatment with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular heparin (LMWH) and oral 
anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKA). The current understanding of PK in children is extrapolated 
from adult studies, although physiological differences in absorption, distribution and metabolism in children 
could warrant different doses according to body weight as compared to adults (Monagle P et al 2012). 
In the Clinical Overview, the MAH refers to the most recent American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) 
management guidelines published in 2012 (Monagle et al 2012), which recommend for the initial treatment 
of VTE in children adjusted-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH), bodyweight-adjusted low-molecular-weight 
heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux. For subsequent treatment, either INR-titrated vitamin K antagonist (VKA) 
or bodyweight-adjusted LMWH is recommended. Suggested treatment durations are 3 months for children 
with provoked VTE in whom the risk factor has resolved and continued anticoagulant therapy in children who 
have ongoing risk factors. For children with idiopathic VTE, the suggested treatment duration has a minimum 
of 3 months and a maximum of 6 to 12 months. Children with recurrent unprovoked VTE are usually treated 
indefinitely. 
In the ACCP guidelines, it is stated that it is suggested that central venous access devices or umbilical venous 
catheters associated with confirmed thrombosis is to be removed after 3 to 5 days of therapeutic 
anticoagulation rather than left in situ. Either initial anticoagulation or supportive care with radiologic 
monitoring for extension of thrombosis is suggested as well as start of anticoagulation if extension occurs in 
previously untreated patients. Anticoagulation should be with either LMWH or UFH followed by LMWH with a 
total duration of anticoagulation of between 6 weeks and 3 months. 
According to the ACCP guidelines, for children with CSVT without significant intracranial haemorrhage, 
anticoagulation is suggested, initially with UFH or LMWH and subsequently with LMWH, for a total therapy 
duration between 6 weeks and 3 months.  For children with CSVT with significant haemorrhage, either 
anticoagulation or supportive care with radiologic monitoring of the thrombosis at 5 to 7 days and 
anticoagulation if thrombus extension is noted is recommended. However, according to the American Heart 
association (AHA) scientific statement (Roach et al 2008), there is currently a consensus that older children 
without haemorrhage should be anticoagulated (International Pediatric Stroke Study consensus) but few 
neonates with CVST have been treated with anticoagulants, and such treatment is not recommended in 
neonates except perhaps in selected patients with clinical deterioration or with radiological evidence of clot 
propagation. 
A retrospective study in neonates and young children by Chan et al (2018), in which paediatricians from 12 
institutions in North America, Europe and Israel collected data for children younger than 2 years with VTE and 
described the diagnosis of VTE, use of anticoagulant therapy and its duration, and incidence of recurrent VTE. 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 10/86 
  
  
The feasibility of recruiting these children in EINSTEIN-Jr. phase III, was assessed. In total, 227/346 children 
had CVC-VTE and of these 199 (88%) received anticoagulation and 28 (12%) did not receive anticoagulation. 
Of the children with CVC-VTE that received anticoagulation 44/199 (22%) received a duration of 
anticoagulation shorter than 6 weeks. Thus, in total 72/227 (32%) of the subjects with CVC-VTE received 
either no anticoagulation or anticoagulation shorter than 6 weeks. It was not stated how many of these 
subjects that received anticoagulation shorter than 1 month i.e. the proposed posology for children <2 years 
with CVC-VTE in the current application. In that study, rates of symptomatic recurrent VTE in children with 
CVC-VTE were low, in particular if anticoagulant therapy was used (10/199 children had a symptomatic 
recurrent VTE during and after anticoagulant therapy); however, though higher, it was low also in the group 
of children not treated with anticoagulants (4/28 had a symptomatic recurrent VTE). 
There is no centrally approved anticoagulant product in the EU for treatment of secondary prevention of VTE 
in children. There is an unmet need for a new treatment-option with well documented efficacy and safety for 
treatment of paediatric VTE.  In this setting, an orally administered alternative that requires less monitoring 
than existing standard of care would also be a benefit. 
About the product 
Rivaroxaban is an oral anticoagulant that selectively targets activated coagulation factor X (Xa), thereby 
inhibiting thrombin generation and thrombus formation. It is approved in adults in various doses for VTE 
prevention in adjunction to elective hip or knee replacement surgery; for treatment and prevention of deep 
vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism; for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation and additional risk factors; and for prevention of atherothrombotic events in 
addition to certain antiplatelet agents in patients with acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery 
disease/peripheral artery disease. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
A Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for the treatment (secondary prevention) of VTE in children was agreed 
with EMA/PDCO in 2009 with the approval of the first indication for rivaroxaban. After sequential requests for 
modification procedures, the most recently agreed PIP (P/0126/2019) contains nine measures which have all 
been completed. The EMA/PDCO has confirmed positive final compliance check with the PIP in September 
2019  
Support for efficacy and safety in the claimed indication are derived from 6 studies: 2 phase 1 studies, 1 
phase 1/2 study, 2 phase 2 studies and 1 phase 3 study.  
In September 2016, a Scientific Advice was adopted by the CHMP on the paediatric EINSTEIN-Jr program 
(EMEA/H/SA/422/13/2016/PED/III). Questions relating to clinical development included a discussion of the 
concept to target similar exposures in children and adults for the treatment of VTE; the phase III study 
design including patient numbers and statistical analysis and the overall rivaroxaban paediatric program. 
Conclusions from the CHMP included: 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 11/86 
  
  
 
 
- 
To target similar exposure in children as in adults was a plausible approach given the similarities 
between the adult and paediatric disease process (coagulation cascade), although with different 
aetiologies, location and frequency. 
- 
The phase III study design was endorsed with regards to the open label design and the use of active 
comparators. 
-  At least 3 months of study period would be required for the treatment indication, and another 3 
months of extension phase for the prevention indication. The primary evaluation should be related to 
the presence of risk factors for recurrent VTE. 
- 
The PDCO had specified that a minimum number of children in each age cohort should be studied in 
the Phase III, to allow relevant efficacy and safety data to be provided in all the age-subsets 6 yrs. - 
< 12 yrs., 2 yrs. - < 6 yrs., 6 mo. to < 2 yrs. and from birth to < 6 mo., moreover taking into 
account the higher variability expected in the lower age-subsets, with the specific paediatric 
formulation, in particular below 12 yrs. of age. The limitations and the feasibility of performing a 
study in children of different age cohorts that is adequately powered to provide statistically significant 
results of efficacy were acknowledged. In the PIP, it was agreed that the number of patients in each 
age cohort should include at least 150 subjects aged 6 months – 18 years and at least 20 subjects 
aged <6 months. 
- 
For the endpoints of the phase III study, the inclusion of asymptomatic deterioration of thrombus 
burden in the composite secondary endpoint was acceptable, given that the expected number of the 
primary efficacy outcome (symptomatic recurrent VTE) would be low and that asymptomatic 
thromboses may have clinical sequelae in children. 
-  An adequate collection of PK/PD data in the phase III studies was discussed, considering the 
expected limited contribution of clinical outcome data, in particular for children from birth to < 6 
months, to further guide in the dose selection, and clarify if further monitoring is needed in the 
paediatric population. 
-  A discussion of the clinical relevance of the results both in terms of the size of the treatment effect as 
well as the corresponding 95% confidence interval were required. Consistency of treatment effects 
across the different age cohorts as well as across the different components of the composite endpoint 
was expected to be demonstrated. Paediatric patients < 2 yrs. are of particular concern due to 
differences in underlying aetiologies and thrombus location, as well as a not fully matured 
coagulation/fibrinolysis system. The applicant was encouraged to focus collection of clinical data in 
this age cohort to support the benefit/risk assessment. For safety, in children from birth to < 6 
months particular safety considerations were pointed out, including CNS bleeding and inconsistent 
enteric absorption. 
- 
 A POPPK approach was encouraged in particular to judge exposure in the youngest individuals 6 
months to < 2 years old. The final proposed doses should be adequately justified in terms of 
comparative exposure to adults. 
-  Unless otherwise justified, controlled data on a sufficient number of patients at high risk for recurrent 
VTE,  should  be  presented.  If  the  intended  indication  is  chronic/indefinite  use  safety  data  extending 
beyond the period of 1 year should be presented.

The clinical programme is overall appropriate for the sought indication and posology. The Scientific Advice 
and applicable EMA guidelines have overall been adhered to, there are some deviations which are commented 
in relevant parts of this report.

as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The 1 mg/mL granules introduced with this line extension application contain the same active substance, 
rivaroxaban, used to manufacture the already-approved film-coated tablets. No new information on the 
active substance has been provided within this application. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Xarelto 1 mg/mL granules for oral suspension are white to off-white granules.  
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to obtain an immediate release oral liquid formulation to 
offer dose flexibility, high convenience and compliance for paediatric use and for patients with dysphagia 
(difficulty in swallowing). Nasogastric or gastric tube application is possible for patients unable or not allowed 
to swallow their medication. To this end, the active pharmaceutical ingredient rivaroxaban is formulated as 
granules that can be administered as a suspension, at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, after addition of drinking 
water. After preparing the suspension for use, the patient or caregiver can withdraw multiple doses between 
0.8 mL and 10 mL from the bottle with an oral pipette depending on the body weight of the patient.  
Based on the QTPP, the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the product were identified.  
The compatibility of the excipients used in the granules formulation with the active substance was 
demonstrated in stability studies. 
The manufacturing process of the granules for oral suspension was developed and optimized at the proposed 
manufacturing site.  
A design of experiment (DoE) was conducted at laboratory scale to systemically explore the manufacturing 
process parameters and to develop a suitable manufacturing process.  
The primary packaging is brown glass type 3 bottles closed with a polypropylene (PP) white opaque child 
resistant screw cap. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: manufacture of granulation liquid; manufacture of a 
premix;  granulation;  and  blending.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 14/86 
  
  
 
producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are 
adequate for this granulation manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: formulation, 
colour,  appearance  of  suspension  colour,  suspendability,  appearance  of  suspension,  identity  (HPLC,  UV), 
dissolution, pH-value, degradation products, assay and microbial purity. 
The proposed specification is considered acceptable. 
The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. The analytical methods used have been 
adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory 
information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
The finished product is released onto the market based on release specifications, through traditional final 
product release testing. 
A risk assessment concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities was performed for the finished product 
based on the combined recommendations from health authorities, including EMA communication 
EMA/189634/2019. A statement that there is no risk of N-nitrosamine contamination has been provided and 
it was concluded that there is no risk related to the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the product. 
Therefore, no changes to the control strategy for Xarelto are necessary to mitigate potential contamination 
by nitrosamines. The nitrosamine impurities risk assessment of the finished product included evaluating 
contributions from rivaroxaban active substance, excipients, finished product manufacturing facilities, and 
packaging components.  
Batch analysis results are provided for three representative batches from each packaging configuration (100 
mL and 250 mL bottles) manufactured at commercial scale confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from several production scale batches of each packaging configuration stored for up to 24 months 
under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH and 30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product 
are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing.  Samples  were  tested  for  formulation  (granulate),  colour,  appearance  of  suspension,  colour  of 
suspension, suspendability, dissolution, pH-value of suspension, degradation products, assay of rivaroxaban, 
assay of sodium benzoate, and microbial purity.  
In  addition,  Rivaroxaban  granules  for  oral  suspension  in  100  mL  and  250  mL  bottles  (one  production  scale 
batch from each) and the suspension as prepared prior to administration to the patients packed in brown glass 
type 3 bottles were exposed to UV-light and visible light radiation exceeding the requirements defined in the 
ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. 
Despite this  extended UV-exposure, both the granules and the suspension  exposed in closed original brown 
glass bottle did not show relevant alterations This confirms the expected protective effect of the container. 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 15/86 
  
  
Therefore, it is concluded that rivaroxaban granules for oral suspension in the original primary container are 
photostable. Thus, a light protection instruction for the drug product after removing the secondary packaging 
is not required. 
For the suspended granules in the original primary container a light protection advice is also not considered 
necessary. 
A stress test was performed with the finished product Rivaroxaban granules for oral suspension to investigate 
physical  alterations  or  degradation.  In  summary,  no  degradation  was  observed  in  the  stress  studies 
Additionally, an in-use stability study of Rivaroxaban granules for oral suspension was performed according to 
the  guideline  CPMP/QWP/2934/99.  Several  batches  of  rivaroxaban  granules  for  oral  suspension  of  each 
presentation were investigated with one batch at the end of the proposed shelf-life. Defined volumes of the 
suspension were taken several times daily on each working day for several days. Between sampling, the bottles 
were stored either in a refrigerator at 2-8 °C or in a temperature-controlled oven at 30 °C. The usability period 
defined for the suspension is set to 14 days. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years, with a storage restriction "Do not store 
above  30  °C"  and  do  not  freeze  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  (section  6.3)  is  acceptable.  After  reconstitution  the 
suspension is stable for 14 days stored upright. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of Xarelto 1 mg/mL granules for oral suspension has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. This immediate release oral liquid formulation has been developed 
to offer dose flexibility, high convenience and compliance for paediatric use and also for patients with 
dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing). The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
Not applicable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No new preclinical data were submitted with this application. In order to support clinical development and 
market authorisation in paediatric indications, juvenile animal toxicity studies in rats up to 14-week 
treatment were performed which have been assessed in previous submissions. 
In order to support the development of a rivaroxaban liquid dosing device for the administration of 
rivaroxaban liquid formulation for children, an in silico genotoxicity assessment of leachables was submitted. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new non-clinical pharmacological data were submitted.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 substrates may differ between paediatric populations and adults. This may 
be related to changes of CYP3A4 activity during human development, as well as additional clearance 
contribution of the fetal isoform CYP3A7. Rivaroxaban was shown to be a substrate for CYP3A4 and 3A5, but 
substrate characteristics towards CYP3A7 were not investigated in the initial CYP reaction phenotyping 
studies. Therefore, an additional study to support the paediatric submission was performed and is discussed 
in the clinical aspects section of this report. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No new data were submitted in the current procedure. Juvenile toxicity studies were submitted and assessed 
in a previous procedure (EMEA/H/C/944/X/17). Information on study design and major findings from these 
studies are presented in Table 6.  
Dose levels were selected according to results in toxicity studies with adult rats. The maximum dose was 
selected based on a limit of absorption at 60 mg/kg.

*) In males, no relevant changes in exposure on Day 74 were observed as compared to Day 1. In females, a slightly higher 
exposure was observed (up to a factor of about 1.8). Thus, the change in vehicle at the time of weaning resulted in a 
relatively constant exposure throughout the study period, so that the high dose of 60 mglkg represents the maximum 
feasible exposure. 
**) In males, a slightly higher means for ALA T were seen in all dose groups. Because the deviations were minimal and 
exposure relationship did not exist, a toxicological relevance is not assumed. 
Other toxicity studies 
Chemical structures that were investigated in the in silico genotoxicity assessment were selected based on 
the results of an leachable study (S19001261). In this study, the adapter as well as the 10 mL pipette were 
exposed to the reconstituted drug suspension. Detected leachable compounds were 4-methoxybenzyl formate 
or 4-methoxybenzeneacetic acid, oleamide, 2,4,7,8-tetramethyl-5-decyn-4,7-diol, sclareolide, and an 
unknown compound. The study report for the investigation of potential mutagenic properties using computer-
based toxicity prediction system and the VITIC database was provided. The identified leachables showed no 
alerts for mutagenicity. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
For the current application no new experimental data on environmental toxicity of rivaroxaban were 
submitted, as the environmental exposure of rivaroxaban due to the new formulation granules for oral 
suspension and the new proposed paediatric indication for the treatment and secondary prevention was 
considered to be negligible compared to the exposure based on the currently approved indications for 
rivaroxaban.  
The prevalence of VTE in children is estimated to be 20-100 times lower than in adult patients (Andrew M et 
al, 1994, Van Ommen CH et al, 2001, Stein PD et al, 2004, Raskob GE et al, 2014). This would mean that 
approximately 1 to 5% paediatric cases can be expected compared to adults. Based on the above 
information, it was estimated that VTE occurs in 0.01 to 0.05 cases per 1000 children each year (Van Ommen 
CH et al, 2001, Stein PD et al, 2004).  According to Eurostat, there are approximately 69 million children<15 
years in the EU, which means that 690 to 3400 children are potential VTE patients. 
The dose for children is dependent of the weight; daily doses range from 2.4 mg to 20 mg. As a conservative 
average, 10 mg (children up to 30 kg) was used for the exposure calculation 
Based on a maximum potential paediatric patient population of 3400 patients, and a conservative average 
dose of 10 mg, the PECsurfacewater for this population and assuming 100% treatment with Xarelto is 
PECsurfacewater = 0.038 ng/L.  
Thus, the ERA for rivaroxaban remains unchanged.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Investigations of rivaroxaban in juvenile rats did not reveal any new toxicity compared to studies in 
adolescent or adult animals. The toxicological profile in juvenile rats appears to be in line with previous 
findings. Minor effects on pancreatic peri-insular findings as well as on the thyroid gland seen in the first 
subchronic toxicity study were not confirmed in the second study showing significantly higher systemic 
exposure. The numerical increase in pancreatic peri-insular lesions (hemorrhage, hemosiderin, and fibrosis) 
and colloid alteration in the thyroids in the first juvenile study was therefore considered to be incidental.  
In the submitted study on impurities, no structural alerts were detected for the investigated compounds. The 
study report for the investigation of potential mutagenic properties using computer-based toxicity prediction 
system and the VITIC database showed no alerts for mutagenicity. 
No ERA studies were submitted, and this was considered acceptable as the use of rivaroxaban in the 
paediatric population is not expected to lead to any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all 
rivaroxaban containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to the approval of rivaroxaban in the proposed paediatric indication from a non-
clinical point of view.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic properties of rivaroxaban have been extensively characterised in adults. Relevant 
subject covariates such as age (elderly), bodyweight, gender, ethnicity as well as renal and hepatic function 
have been investigated in detail in adults and were reported in previous submissions. Food affects the 
bioavailability of rivaroxaban which is reduced in the fasted state. This effect is more pronounced at doses of 
15 mg and above. A dose-dependent decrease in relative bioavailability has been detected in adult studies. 
Time-dependencies in rivaroxaban PK have been studied in adults and did not reveal any undue accumulation 
beyond steady-state, nor alterations in rivaroxaban absorption or elimination behaviour between morning and 
evening/night PK profiles. Based on the data obtained in adults, concomitant use of strong inhibitors of both 
CYP3A4 and P-gp is not recommended; strong inducers of CYP3A4 should be co-administered with caution. 
Based on the physicochemical properties of rivaroxaban and based on PK data obtained in adults, in all 
studies children received the rivaroxaban IR tablet or the oral suspension during or closely after feeding or

0.5 years were required have oral / (naso)gastric tube feeding for at least 10 days. 
A bodyweight-adjusted dosing scheme, resulting in rivaroxaban exposure similar to that observed in adult 
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) patients treated with 20 mg o.d., was developed and evaluated in a 
comprehensive program comprised of six Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies in children from birth (term neonates) to 
18 years. 
Different rivaroxaban formulations were used throughout the clinical paediatric program. The final to-be-
marketed granules for oral suspension, that was used in the pivotal phase-III study, was evaluated in two 
bioequivalence (BE) studies in healthy adults. At both 10 mg in the fasted state and 20 mg in the fed state 
the granules for suspension were equivalent with the respective 10 and 20 mg IR tablets using standard BE 
criteria. 
In healthy adults a similar effect of food was seen with the 20 mg suspension as with the 20 mg IR tablets, 
i.e. a reduced bioavailability in the fasted state compared to the fed state. In all paediatric studies 
rivaroxaban was administered during or closely after feeding or meal intake this is also recommended in the 
paediatric posology in the SmPC. 
CYP3A activity changes during human development. CYP3A4 activity is negligible in the first days after birth, 
increasing activity up to an age of 12 months. The fetal isoform CYP3A7 have peak activities in the first days 
after birth, deceasing activity to negligible levels up to 12 months of age. An in vitro study was performed 
which indicates that rivaroxaban is a poor substrate for the fetal isoform CYP3A7 compared to CYP3A4. A 
relevant contribution of CYP3A7 to the hepatic clearance of rivaroxaban in the paediatric population is 
unlikely. 
Methods 
An adequately validated HPLC-MS/MS method with a calibration range of 0.50 µg/L to 500 µg/L was used to 
detect rivaroxaban in plasma. 
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling was used to predict the initial doses to be used in 
the paediatric studies and to support further dosing recommendations during the running program.  
Population pharmacokinetic (popPK) modelling was used for the evaluation of rivaroxaban PK in children of 
various age groups and, additionally, to further support dosing recommendations required in the course of 
this program. A comprehensive popPK model was developed based on mainly sparse PK sampling collected in 
seven phase I/II/III trials (12892, 14372, 14373, 14374, 17992, 17618, and preliminary data of the first part 
of the UNIVERSE study). The median age was 9 years (SD 5.9 years, min 0 years, max 18 years), the 
median body weight was 29.5 kg (SD 28 kg, min 2.7 kg, max 194 kg). In total, 524 patients and 1988 PK 
samples were included in the final population PK analysis. In the final dataset, 62% of the patients and the 
PK samples were collected in the phase III study (study 14372).  
The comprehensive (final) population PK model for rivaroxaban in the paediatric population was a two-
compartment model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination from the central compartment. A 
lower rate of absorption was estimated for undiluted suspension when compared to the other tested 
formulations (tablet, granules for oral suspension, and diluted suspension). The dose dependent effect on 
relative bioavailability was described using a previously reported adult F1 function, in which dose was 
replaced by dose/weight ratio, with decreasing F1 with increasing dose/weight ratio. The relative oral

bioavailability of 100% as a reference value was assumed for a dose/weight of 0.12 mg/kg and decreased 
gradually to 79.1% at 0.30 mg/kg and 68.1% at 0.50 mg/kg.  
Rivaroxaban exposure in the paediatric population 
The underlying dosing strategy of this paediatric program was to achieve a rivaroxaban exposure in children 
that is similar to that observed in adult DVT patients receiving 20 mg rivaroxaban o.d. The bodyweight-
adjusted rivaroxaban dosing schedule for children aged birth (term neonates) to < 18 years (Table 7) was 
developed based on the comprehensive Phase 1 and 2 data and was confirmed in the subsequent Phase 3 
Study 14372.

PK Parameters were derived by PopPK.  On the right-hand side, popPK results for adult DVT patients (20 mg o.d.) are 
shown as box whisker plot, which indicate the percentiles 5, 25, 50, 75, and 95 and individual values beyond the 5th - 95th 
percentile as open circles. 
PK related to intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
Exploratory PK analyses did not indicate relevant differences between male and female children nor between 
either Japanese, Chinese, or Asian children outside Japan and China compared to the respective overall 
paediatric population.  Furthermore, no relevant impact of underweight or obesity on rivaroxaban PK in 
children was found. No influence of renal function on rivaroxaban PK was found. No data was available in 
children with hepatic impairment. The exploratory analyses did not indicate a relevant impact of concurrent 
functional gastrointestinal disorders, certain malignant diseases on rivaroxaban PK in children, neither for the 
acute and chronic GI diseases nor for neoplasms with high prevalence in childhood. Limited results from 
clinical studies in children did not indicate new drug-drug interaction potential not already known from adults. 
No additional analyses on the impact of food on rivaroxaban absorption in children were conducted, hence 
the recommendation of administration with food is based on the PK data obtained in adults. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacological effects of rivaroxaban have been extensively characterised in adults. A dose-dependent 
inhibition of Factor Xa was observed across the complete dose range, closely following the pharmacokinetic 
profiles of rivaroxaban. The other global clotting tests prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT) were also affected in a dose-dependent way.  
In children, the blood coagulation system is distinctly different from adults and matures with age – a 
phenomenon that is described as ‘developmental haemostasis’. The following studies of relevance for primary 
pharmacology have been provided: 
12892: Phase 1. Multicentre, single-arm single-dose study of oral rivaroxaban in suspension or tablets 
adapted to bodyweight. Primary objective: PK/PD. Secondary objective: safety/tolerability. Other outcomes: 
palatability and acceptability of suspension. 59 treated subjects aged 0.5 years-<18 years. 
14373: Phase 2. Multicentre, single-arm 30 days study of oral age- and bodyweight-adjusted rivaroxaban in 
suspension or tablets. Primary objective: major/CRNM bleeding. Secondary objective: recurrent VTE; 
asymptomatic deterioration of thrombotic burden on repeat imaging; PK/PD profile of 30 days oral 
rivaroxaban treatment. 68 enrolled, 63 treated subjects aged 6-18 years. 
14374: Phase 2. Multicentre, single-arm 30 days study of oral age- and bodyweight-adjusted rivaroxaban in 
suspension. Primary objective: major/CRNM bleeding. Secondary objective: recurrent VTE; asymptomatic 
deterioration of thrombotic burden on repeat imaging; PK/PD profile of 30-day oral rivaroxaban treatment. 51 
enrolled, 46 treated subjects aged 0.5-6 years. 
14372: Phase 3. Multicentre, open-label, randomised, active controlled study of age- and bodyweight-
adjusted rivaroxaban in granules for suspension or tablets, with a study duration of 3 to 12 months (1-3 
months for children < 2 years with CVC-VTE).  Study objectives were to assess the incidence of symptomatic 
recurrent VTE, asymptomatic deterioration, and PK/PD profile of rivaroxaban. 335 enrolled subjects in 
rivaroxaban group (165 comparator); 329 rivaroxaban treated subjects aged birth - <18 years. 313 children 
were valid for PD analysis.

17618: Phase 1/2. Multicentre, open-label 7 days study of oral bodyweight adjusted rivaroxaban in 
suspension given b.i.d. or t.i.d. Primary objective: PK/PD profile. Secondary objectives: major/CRNM 
bleeding; recurrent VTE, asymptomatic deterioration. 11 enrolled, 10 treated subjects aged 0-6 months. 
Results of PD parameters 
Ex-vivo experiments 
Ex-vivo spiking experiments with increasing rivaroxaban concentrations were performed that investigated the 
correlation of prothrombin time, aPTT, inhibition of anti-factor Xa activity and thrombin generation to 
rivaroxaban plasma concentrations in children aged birth to 16 years as compared to adults. Age-specific 
plasma pools were created (i.e. birth to 28 days, 28 days to 23 months, 2 to 6, 7 to 11, 12 to 16 years and 
adults) and spiked with increasing concentrations of rivaroxaban (0–500 ng/ml).  In children older than 28 
days, the effects of rivaroxaban on in vitro coagulation tests were similar across all age cohorts and similar to 
the effects observed in adults.  In children younger than 28 days, prothrombin time and thrombin generation 
(lag time), showed a significantly more pronounced effect as compared to adults for all plasma 
concentrations. A similar effect was also observed for aPTT at low plasma concentrations, which was not 
significant at higher plasma concentrations. No age-related differences were observed for the inhibition of 
anti-factor Xa activity assays. Whereas in general a dose and dosing regimen in children was chosen that 
targeted the exposure range of the adult reference population, in younger children (weighing less than 12 kg, 
which corresponds to an age of approximately 2 years and younger), a match with the lower 30% of the 
adult exposure range was targeted. 
Results from clinical studies 
Anti-Xa-activity 
In the anti-factor Xa activity assay, a linear correlation to plasma concentrations as determined by HPLC-
MS/MS was observed in a pooled analysis of all multiple dose studies in children (studies 14374, 14373, 
17618 and 14372). After exclusion of outliers originating from study 14372, which were potentially influenced 
by storage and/or processing/analysis deviations, the correlation between anti-factor Xa activity and plasma 
concentrations has a slope of 0.961 and an intercept of 0.655 μg/L. 
The dosing regimen (o.d., b.i.d. and t.i.d.) did not influence the correlation of anti-factor Xa activity versus 
plasma concentrations in children (data not shown).  
Global clotting tests (PT and aPTT): 
PT or aPTT data (absolute values) from the Phase 3 study in children were compared to the adult reference 
population (patients being treated for DVT who received a 20 mg once daily dose. A pooled analysis from all 
treatment studies in children (studies 14373, 14374, 17618, 14372) investigated the correlation of PT/aPTT 
versus plasma concentrations. PT and aPTT were determined as ratio to the individual baseline and correlated 
to plasma concentrations determined by HPLC-MS/MS. These data were compared to the adult data from 
patients who were treated for DVT and received a 20 mg once daily dose. These adult data are depicted as 
the 99% prediction interval of adult DVT patients. 
Prothrombin time (PT) 
The paediatric data are very similar to the adult data independent of the dosing regimen (once, twice and 
three times daily) as well as independent of the formulation used (tablet or oral suspension) (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Prothrombin time profiles in children  
The correlation of PT prolongation versus plasma concentration was visually close to linear in children, not 
different from adults, and not different between the individual age groups (Figure 3).

Different dosing regimens did not influence the correlation of PT versus plasma concentrations (data not 
shown). 
The relationship between the PT and measured plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban was explored using 
regression analysis of PT data from all paediatric studies. The relationship between PT and plasma 
concentration was best described by a modulated power model, described by a baseline and slope parameter, 
plus an exponent that modulates plasma concentration as the dependent variable. The exponent depends on 
the plasma concentration in a way that it approaches 1 for low rivaroxaban concentrations (i.e. approaching a 
linear model) and is smaller than 1 for high rivaroxaban concentrations. This exponential modulation of the 
plasma concentrations leads to a flattening of the linear relation between PT and plasma concentrations at 
high concentrations, in line with the observed PT data. 
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 
Individual aPTT values in children from the Phase 3 study 14372 were compared to adult DVT patients 
receiving 20 mg rivaroxaban once daily. The paediatric data are very similar to the adult data independent of 
the dosing regimen or the formulation used (Figure 4).

The correlation of aPTT prolongation versus plasma concentration is visually close to linear but less steep 
than observed for PT, but not different from adults, and not different between the individual age groups 
(Figure 5). Likewise, different dosing regimens do not influence the correlation of aPTT versus plasma 
concentrations. 
Figure 5. Correlation of aPTT prolongation versus plasma concentration in children treated with multiple 
doses of rivaroxaban by age 
The relationship between aPTT and measured plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban was explored using 
regression analysis with PT data from all pediatric studies. The relationship between PT and plasma 
concentration was best described by a modulated power model, described by a baseline and slope parameter, 
plus an exponent that modulates plasma concentration as the dependent variable. Similar to the model for 
PT, the exponent depends on the plasma concentration in a way that it approaches 1 for low rivaroxaban 
concentrations (i. e. approaching a linear model) and is smaller than 1 for high rivaroxaban concentrations. 
This exponential modulation of the plasma concentrations leads to a flattening of the linear relation between 
PT and plasma concentrations at high concentrations, in line with the observed aPTT data.  
The concentration-effect relationship was graphically explored to test for potential age or weight 
dependencies. No correlation was observed with the slope parameter of the PK/aPTT relationship. Additional 
analysis showed that the weighted residuals for aPTT are equally distributed around zero for each age group 
individually, indicating that the aPTT model describes the concentration-effect relationship adequately for all 
children irrespective of their age. 
Effect of intrinsic factors on PD 
No effect of age, weight, gender, acute or chronic GI disorders, mild renal impairment or children with and 
without neoplasms were observed for the correlation of the pharmacodynamic tests PT, aPTT, or anti-factor 
Xa activity versus plasma concentrations based on pooled data of studies 14373, 14374, 17618, 14372. No 
data is available in children with hepatic impairment.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Extensive PBPK and popPK analyses have been performed throughout the paediatric rivaroxaban 
development program. PBPK modelling has been used to predict the initial doses to be used in the paediatric 
studies and to support further dosing recommendations during the running program, however as the dosing 
regimens have been studied in clinical trials the PBPK analyses are not perceived as pivotal from a regulatory 
perspective.  
Population PK modelling was used throughout the EINSTEIN-Jr program to analyse the sparse PK samples 
collected in the clinical trials.  A comprehensive popPK model based on pooled paediatric data from all ages 
(seven studies all together) was developed and this analysis is viewed as the pivotal rivaroxaban population 
PK analysis in the paediatric population. The approach of a pooled data analysis is endorsed, and the data 
handling is acceptable. Furthermore, standard software and methods have been used in the model 
development and evaluation. Formulation was tested as a covariate in an exploratory PK model, and no 
statistical difference was detected between the tablet and prediluted suspension.  
In general, the simulation-based evaluations of the model indicate that the model describes the paediatric 
data fairly well. Apart from the expected body weight dependence, no major differences between adult and 
paediatric PK properties of rivaroxaban were detected. 
In comparing paediatric and adult exposure levels, a reference range for adult patients aged ≤ 45 years with 
acute symptomatic DVT receiving 20 mg o.d. was targeted. The adult reference range is based on the 
knowledge that renal insufficiency affects rivaroxaban PK. As such the exposure range the paediatric 
population is expected to be more similar to the exposure range in the young adult population. For most part, 
predicted values for AUC(0-24)ss, Cmax,ss as well as Ctrough,ss were within the adult reference ranges 
irrespective of formulation and for all age groups, bodyweight categories and treatment regimens. For 
children weighing less than 12 kg, a match with the lower 30% of the adult exposure range was targeted. As 
a result, most AUC(0-24)ss values in children receiving rivaroxaban in t.i.d. regimen were located below the 
median of the adult reference range.  As expected, for Cmax,ss a clear trend is seen by regimen, with 
decreasing Cmax,ss with less frequent dosing regimen. Ctrough,ss a minor trend towards higher values in b.i.d. 
and t.i.d. regimen compared to o.d. regimen is evident. As such, the exposure predictions from the phase III 
trial indicate that an adequate dosing regimen was achieved.  
For pharmacodynamics, the PD endpoints anti-Xa activity, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT) are deemed relevant, although the clinical relevance is somewhat limited, in 
particular for aPTT for which it was concluded in the adult SPAF studies that although aPTT was prolonged 
dose-dependently, the slope was too flat to allow a sufficient discrimination at the relevant plasma 
concentrations. Therefore, aPTT was not considered to be adequate for following the PD effects. 
The ex-vivo spiking experiments are of interest, given the differences noted between children from birth to 
28 days as compared to older children. The effect on PD markers (prothrombin time and thrombin 
generation) showed a significantly more pronounced effect as compared to adults for all plasma 
concentrations, and for aPTT a similar effect was shown at low plasma concentrations (not significant at 
higher plasma concentrations). However, no such effect was demonstrated in the clinical PD studies. For the 
clinical PD studies, the numbers of children in each age cohort is in line with the agreed PIP, and results 
indicate similar PD effects as in adults across the individual age groups and different dosing regimens. Of 
note, the sources of the adult reference data and prediction intervals originate from a limited number of 
subjects (N = 130) and not from the adult VTE population in the adult pivotal studies. A modulated power 
model could be fitted for both PT and aPTT versus measured plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban. 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 32/86 
  
  
No effect of age, weight, gender, acute or chronic GI disorders, mild renal impairment or children with and 
without neoplasms was demonstrated on the PD tests. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products relate primarily to other antithrombotic agents, 
for which concomitant use could increase the risk of bleeding. This has been extensively studied in adults, 
and a similar risk is likely in children, although use of additional antithrombotic agents such as antiplatelet 
agents for e.g. cardiovascular disease could be expected to be lower in children. There were no major 
bleedings or clinically relevant non major bleedings in children concomitantly treated with rivaroxaban and 
other antithrombotic agents during the main treatment period of study 14372; however, two of the three 
clinically relevant non-major bleeding events during extension phase occurred in children concomitantly 
treated with acetylsalicylic acid or ibuprofen. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters AUC(0-24)ss, Cmax,ss and Ctrough,ss did not correlate with efficacy or safety 
defined as thrombotic events or bleeding events. Consequently, there is no established correlation between 
any of the PD markers and clinical efficacy or safety. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the CHMP considered that the clinical pharmacology data provided with this application were 
adequate to support this application.  
A pooled population PK analysis of all paediatric PK data demonstrated that acceptable plasma concentration 
levels were reached across all weight and age groups, and that the exposure was comparable to the exposure 
measured in reference population of young adults.  
Similar to adults, an increased risk of bleeding if other antithrombotic agents are used concomitantly with 
rivaroxaban would be expected in children.

adjusted 20 mg equivalent dose given once-daily, twice-daily or thrice-daily for bodyweights of ≥30, ≥12 to 
<30, and <12 kg, respectively (dosing regimens adjusted if body weight changed during study). No dose 
reduction for impaired renal function was required (children with impaired renal function with eGFR 
<30mL/min/1.73 m2 were excluded as described above). Children with body weight of ≥ 20 kg received 
rivaroxaban tablets or oral suspension; children with body weight of < 20 kg received rivaroxaban as oral 
suspension; see Table 8.  
Table 3. Body weight-adjusted rivaroxaban dosing schedule for children aged birth to <18 years in Study 
14372  
For switching from UFH/heparin/fondaparinux to rivaroxaban, the first administration of rivaroxaban was 1) 4 
hours after stopping the infusion of UFH, 2) 12 hours after the last injection of LMWH with a twice-daily 
regimen, or 3) 24 hours after the last injection of fondaparinux or LMWH with a once-daily regimen.

Children randomised to comparator received standard of care anticoagulation, either continuous UFH, LMWH 
or fondaparinux or switch to VKA therapy, target therapeutic range 2.0-3.0, according to Table 9. 
Table 4. Overview of comparator treatment in Study 14372 
In all children, except those aged < 2 years with catheter-related thrombosis, the main study treatment 
period was 3 months. After that, up to the discretion of the treating physician, study treatment was stopped 
or continued for an additional 3 months. In children who completed 6 months of treatment, study treatment 
was stopped or continued for an additional 3 months. In children who completed 9 months of treatment, 
study treatment was stopped or continued for an additional 3 months. Thereafter, no prolongation of study 
treatment could take place. 
In children aged < 2 years with catheter-related thrombosis, the main study treatment period was 1 month. 
After that, up to the discretion of the treating physician, study treatment was stopped or continued for an 
additional 1 month. In children who completed 2 months of treatment, study treatment was stopped or 
continued for an additional 1 months. Thereafter, no prolongation of study treatment could take place.  
After cessation of study treatment with rivaroxaban, it was at the investigator’s discretion to continue with 
anticoagulation, as needed. 
Objectives 
The efficacy objectives were: 
- 
- 
To assess the incidence of symptomatic recurrent VTE 
To assess the incidence of symptomatic recurrent VTE and asymptomatic deterioration on repeat 
imaging 
The safety objective was: 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 36/86 
  
  
 
 
 
 
- 
To assess the incidence of overt major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent VTE. 
The secondary efficacy outcome was the composite of symptomatic recurrent VTE and asymptomatic 
deterioration in thrombotic burden on repeat imaging at the end of the main treatment period. 
Further efficacy outcomes: 
-Composite of symptomatic recurrent VTE and major bleeding 
-Composite of symptomatic recurrent VTE and asymptomatic deterioration and no change in thrombotic 
burden assessment on repeat imaging at the end of the main treatment period 
-Composite of symptomatic recurrent VTE and thrombotic burden assessment at repeated imaging at the end 
of the main treatment period (symptomatic recurrent VTE, asymptomatic deterioration, no relevant change, 
uncertain, improved, normalized) 
-Normalization of thrombotic burden assessment on repeat imaging at the end of the main treatment period 
without confirmed symptomatic recurrent VTE 
-Fatal or non-fatal pulmonary embolism 
-Composite of symptomatic recurrent VTE and other clinically significant thrombosis. 
Sample size 
A properly powered non-inferiority study was not feasible due to the low incidence of VTE in children, and the 
lack of well-documented information on recurrence rate and treatment effect with standard of care in 
children. Hence, there was no formal sample size calculation. 
At least 170 children were planned to be included: 80 in the age group 12 to < 18 years, 30 in the age group 
6 to < 12 years, 20 in the age group 2 to < 6 years, and 20 in the age group birth to < 2 years, with at least 
12 aged birth to < 6 months.  
Enrolment was conducted staggered by age, starting with children aged 12 to <18 years, and opening each 
subsequent age cohort via a substantial amendment once the body weight-adjusted dose regimen had been 
determined in Phase 2 for the respective age groups. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was in a 2 (rivaroxaban): 1 (standard of care [SOC]) fashion. Allocation to treatment was 
done centrally using an interactive voice/web response system (IxRS) and was stratified by two types of 
baseline presentation of venous thrombosis as diagnosed by the investigator for each age group, separately: 
a) lower extremity DVT, caval vein thrombosis, upper extremity DVT, subclavian thrombosis, right atrial 
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and catheter related thrombosis and 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 37/86 
  
  
b) cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis, jugular vein thrombosis, mesenteric vein thrombosis, portal vein 
thrombosis and renal vein thrombosis 
Children randomised to rivaroxaban were to start rivaroxaban the day following the last administration of 
initial therapy with UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux but with a minimal duration of initial therapy of 5 days and a 
maximum duration of 9 days. 
Children randomised to the comparator group had to continue with UFH, LMWH or fondaparinux or switch to 
VKA therapy.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
Incidence proportions were calculated for the efficacy outcomes by treatment group at the end of the main 
treatment period for the combined data over all children and by classification of index event. Cumulative 
incidences (time to first event; Kaplan-Meier) were calculated for the primary efficacy outcome and for the 
composite of all symptomatic recurrent VTE and major bleeding by treatment group at the end of the main 
study treatment period for pooled data over all children. Incidence proportions were calculated for each age 
stratum, weight group (seven level grouping) and dosing formulation assignment at the end of the main 
treatment period for SAF and PPS populations and by presentation of index event. Incidence proportions 
were also calculated for the primary outcome by treatment group for each age stratum, and pooled data 
excluding children <2 years with CVC-VTE in the extended study treatment period at 6, 9 and 12 months. 
Counts of composite of symptomatic recurrent VTE and thrombotic burden assessment at repeated imaging 
at the end of the main treatment period were reported by classification and presentation of index event. The 
counts were also calculated for subjects with anticoagulants that were prolonged after the main treatment 
period versus subjects without any anticoagulants after the main treatment period. Incidence proportions in 
the extended treatment period for children <2 years with CVC-VTE were presented separately at 2 and 3 
months. Denominators were the number of patients at risk at the start of the respective period. 
Two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the frequency efficacy outcomes were calculated by applying the 
method of Blyth-Still-Casella. For time-to-event analyses, the censoring mechanism was assumed to be non-
informative. These analyses included events up to the end of study periods per subject regardless of the 
actual stop date of study medication. Events that occurred more than 2 days after stop of study medication 
up to 30 days were to be listed.

The primary reason for not completing the main treatment period in children was withdrawal by subject 
(11/500, 2.2%, manually calculated), 5 (1.0%, manually calculated) of whom received, and 6 (1.2%) did not 
receive any study medication.

After completion of the main treatment period and at the discretion of the investigator, study treatment could 
be continued three times with blocks of 3 months each (maximum duration of study treatment, 12 months). 
However, for children with CVC-VTE aged < 2 years, study treatment could be continued two times with 
blocks of 1 month each (maximum study treatment duration, 3 months) (see Section 7.1). Of the 500 
randomized children, 218 (43.6%) entered and 179 (82.1%) completed the first block of extended 
treatment, 91 (18.2%) entered and 84 (92.3%) completed the second block of extended treatment, and 48 
(9.6%) entered and all (100%) completed the third block of extended treatment. Although some children 
with CVC-VTE aged < 2 years were included before Amendment 12 (and therefore had a main study 
treatment period of 3 months rather than 1 month), the main treatment duration was considered to be 1 
month for all of these children. If the actual main treatment period for these children exceeded 1 month, the 
children were considered as having a subsequent treatment extension.  
A total of 469/500 (93.8%) children completed the 30-day post-study treatment follow up period. Three 
children did not enter, and 28 (5.6%) children did not complete the follow-up. The most common reasons for 
not completing the follow up were withdrawal by subject and lost to follow-up. There was no relevant 
difference between the treatment groups or age groups. Of the 491 children in SAF, 248 (50.5%) continued 
with study medication after the main treatment period, or received local anticoagulant treatment within 7 
days after the main treatment period, for at least 7 days. 
Recruitment 
Study start: 13 November 2014 (First subject, first visit). 
Study ginish:30 January 2019 (Last subject, last visit). 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended 17 times, including 4 global amendments. The main amendments included  
• 
• 
• 
implementation of dosing regimen for children aged 6 to <12 years following the conformation of the 
body-weight adjusted dosing regimen for this age group in the phase II study (14373); 
enrolment in the study of children aged 0.5 to <6 years was opened; 
the dosing table was extended to include dosing information for children with body weight of 6-12 kg. 
Children with body weight between 6 and 12 kg were to be treated according to a three times daily 
schedule with a time interval of approximately 8 hours between individual doses. 
•  New dosing information for children with body weight between 2.6 and < 6 kg, and inclusion of 
children aged birth -0.5 year was added. 
Minor protocol deviations were reported for 345 (69.0%) of the 500 children: 72.2% in the rivaroxaban group 
and 62.4% in the comparator group (Table 14.1.1 / 44). Major protocol deviations were reported for 33 
(6.6%) of the children: 7.8% in the rivaroxaban group and 4.2% in the comparator group; 22 had major 
protocol deviations related to PK/PD (rivaroxaban group only), 9 treatment deviations, and 6 other protocol 
deviations.

Baseline data 
Demographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment groups. Of the 500 
randomized children, 255 (51.0%) were male and 245 (49.0%) were female, 395 (79.0%) were white, 25 
(5.0%) were black, 28 (5.6%) were Asian, 2 (0.4%) were American Indian or Alaska native, 1 (0.2%) was 
native Hawaiian or other pacific islander, and 4 (0.8%) were of multiple races. For 45 (9.0%) children, no 
race was reported. The mean age of children was 11.12 years (median 13.23 years). Average weight was 
46.35 kg (median 48.30 kg) and average height was 140.93 cm (median 156.00 cm).  
Demographics for the smaller group of patients aged between birth to two years of age are presented in 
Table 11.  
Table 6. Demographics for children aged birth to <2 years (FAS, Study 14372) 
Index events 
The index VTE was confirmed in 99.0% (495/500) of children: 99.7% (334/335) of children in the 
rivaroxaban group and 97.6% (161/165) of children in the comparator group. The index events were 
classified by the CIAC as thrombosis of the 1) lower extremity, 2) caval vein, 3) renal vein, 4) portal vein, 5) 
right side of the heart, 6) lungs, 7) upper extremity (including the axillary and subclavian veins), 8) jugular 
vein, and 9) cerebral vein or sinuses. For children who presented with VTE in multiple locations, the CIAC 
assessed the main presentation of VTE, and grouped the child in a single class. 
The most common index events were lower extremity VTE (rivaroxaban 112/335, 33.4% and comparator 
53/165, 32.1%), CVST (rivaroxaban 74/335, 22.1% and comparator 43/165, 26.1%), and pulmonary

embolism (rivaroxaban 49/335, 14.6% and comparator 31/165, 18.8%). CVC-VTE was found in 127/500 
(25.4%) children (90/335, 26.9% in rivaroxaban group and 37/165, 22.4% in comparator group).  
Index event by location, age and treatment allocation is reported in Table 12. 
Table 7. Index venous thrombosis-main clot location by age (FAS, Study 14372) 
Risk factors at baseline 
VTE was provoked by a single risk factor in 48.0%, by 2 risk factors in 29.2%, and by more than 2 risk 
factors in 10.4% of children. The most common persistent risk factors were major organ disease (16.6%) 
and active cancer (11.2%). Most common transient risk factors were major infectious disease (28.4%) and 
use of central venous catheter (25.2%) 
Kidney function at baseline 
Children were ineligible for the study if they had an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, or, in children 
younger than 1 year, if they had a serum creatinine above the 97.5th percentile. Renal function was 
categorized as ≥80 mL/min, 50 to <80 mL/min, and 30 to <50 mL/min to allow comparisons to adult data 
from VTE rivaroxaban treatment studies. However, in children younger than 1 year, GFR estimating formulas 
have never been validated. For the purpose of analyses, a serum creatinine level below the 90th percentile, 
between the 90th and the 97.5th percentile, and above the 97.5th percentile were classified as a GFR of≥80 
mL/min, 50 to <80 L/min, and <50 mL/min, respectively (Boer et al 2010). 465/500 children (rivaroxaban 
310/335, 92.5% and comparator 155/165, 93.9%) had a creatinine clearance ≥80 ml/min, 23/500 children 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 42/86 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
(rivaroxaban 17/335, 5.1% and comparator 6/165, 3.6%) had creatinine clearance 50 to <80 ml/min, and 
4/500 children (rivaroxaban 2/335, 0.6% and comparator 2/165,1.2%) <50 ml/min.  
Initial anticoagulant therapy for index event 
All children received initial parenteral anticoagulant treatment for the index event prior to study drug 
administration. Initial parenteral anticoagulant had a duration of at least 5 days in 97.4% of children.  
Comparator study medication type 
106/162 subjects in the SAF comparator group received LMWH/Fondaparinux, and 56/162 received vitamin 
K-antagonist (VKA). Distribution by age group is presented in Table 13.

Of the 91 available children who received comparator, treatment compliance for the main treatment period 
could not be calculated for 1 child because dispensed medication was not returned. Of the 90 remaining 
children with compliance calculations, 1 child (1.1%) had a compliance <50%, 4 (4.4%) had a compliance 
between 50 and 80%, and 85 (94.4%) had a compliance ≥80%.  
For the entire (main and extended) treatment period, treatment compliance could not be addressed for 1 of 
the 91 available children who received comparator because dispensed medication was not returned. Of the 
remaining 90 children in the comparator group, 2 (2.2%) had a treatment compliance <50%,8 (8.9%) had a 
compliance between 50 and 80%, and 79 (87.8%) had a compliance≥80%. 
Numbers analysed 
The full analysis set (FAS) included all randomised children, 335 children in the rivaroxaban group and 165 
patients in the comparator group. The safety analysis set (SAF, n=491)) included all randomised children 
who had received at least one dose of study medication. The per-protocol set (PPS, n=485) included all 
children included in FAS without major protocol deviations. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy outcome (recurrent VTE): 
Main treatment period 
Table 9. Incidences of primary efficacy outcomes during the main treatment period (FAS, study 14372) 
In the safety analysis set, the primary efficacy outcome occurred in 1.2% (4/329) in the rivaroxaban group 
(95% CI 0.4-3.0%) and in 3.1% (5/162) in the comparator group (95% CI 1.2%-6.7%) in the main study 
treatment period. 
Analysed by per protocol set, the primary efficacy outcome occurred in 1.2% (4/327) in the rivaroxaban 
group (95% CI 0.4-3.1%) and in 3.2% (5/158) in the comparator group (95% CI 1.3%-6.9%) in the main 
study treatment period. 
All recurrent VTEs in the rivaroxaban group occurring during the main treatment period occurred in children 
aged between 12 and 18 years (4/184; 2.2%;95% CI 0.7 - 5.3%). In the comparator group, recurrent VTE

occurred in 3 of the 92 children aged between 12 and 18 years (3.3%; 95% CI 0.9 - 8.6%), in 1 of the 34 
children aged between 6 and 12 years (2.9%; 95 CI 0.2% - 15.1%) and in 1 of the 22 children aged between 
2 and 6 years (4.5%; 95% CI 0.2 - 20.7%). Details of these events are summarised in Tables 15 and 16.

The incidence of recurrent VTE during the main treatment period was 0.5% (1/204; 95% CI 0.0 - 2.5%; 
location lower extremity) in children who received rivaroxaban as suspension and 2.4% (3/125; 95% CI 0.7 - 
6.6%; location lower extremity, lung, upper extremity) in children who received rivaroxaban as tablets. 
Primary efficacy outcome during extended treatment: 
A total of 135 subjects in the rivaroxaban group and 63 subjects in the comparator group participated in the 
first extended treatment period. Only 2 subjects <2 years of age were incluced in the rivaroxaban group, and 
only 1 subject in the comparator group. 
During Extension 1 (month 3 to 6), 1/46 children (2.2%; 95% CI 0.1-10.9%) in the comparator group had 
recurrent VTE. During Extension 2 (month 6 to 9), 1/38 children (2.6%; 95% CI 0.1-13.4%) in the 
rivaroxaban group and 1/19 children (5.3%; 95% CI 0.3-24.4%) in the comparator group had recurrent VTE. 
During Extension 3 (month 9 to 12), no recurrent VTE occurred.  
Primary efficacy outcome after stop of study treatment 
During the post-study treatment period >2 and ≤ 30 days after stop of study treatment, there were 2 children 
(both in the comparator group) with a primary efficacy outcome, i.e. recurrent VTE. Neither child had 
received local anticoagulant therapy in the days between stop of study treatment and occurrence of the 
recurrent VTE.  
Secondary efficacy outcome (composite of recurrent VTE and asymptomatic deterioration) 
During the main study treatment period, the secondary efficacy outcome (composite of recurrent VTE and 
asymptomatic deterioration) occurred in 5/335 children (1.5%; 95% CI 0.6-3.4%) in the rivaroxaban group 
and in 6/165 children (3.6%; 95% CI 1.6-7.6%) in the comparator group.  
For the comparator, the event of asymptomatic deterioration on repeat imaging occurred in a subject aged 
12-<18 years (weight group >/= 50 kg); for rivaroxaban, this event occurred in a subject aged 2-<6 years 
(weight group 10-<20 kg).

Thrombotic burden at repeat imaging 
The thrombotic burden assessment was based on the comparison of the repeat imaging test at the end of the 
main treatment period with the imaging test of the index event and is reported only for children who did not 
have a recurrent VTE (Table 18). Imaging location and methods used are summarised in Table 19.

Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy outcome 
Sensitivity analyses were performed in order to evaluate the potential influence of dropouts on the incidence 
of the primary efficacy outcome (i.e. recurrent VTE) during the main treatment period. In these analyses 
which included only children who were assigned to 3 months of study treatment, children with premature 
termination before the end (defined as day 83) of the main treatment period were assumed as having a 
hazard of recurrent VTE 1.5 times (scenario 1) and twice (scenario 2) as high as the hazard calculated 
including all patients within each treatment group, assuming informative censoring. For this sensitivity 
analysis, an exponential distribution for the time-to-event outcome, i.e. constant incidence rates (hazard), 
was assumed and the analysis was performed for each treatment group separately (Table 20).  
Table 15. Sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy outcome (FAS, study 14372) 
The results of the sensitivity analysis show that even if one assumes that dropouts in the rivaroxaban group 
are more likely (1.5 and 2.0 times more likely applying the respective IMHR) to have a primary efficacy 
outcome than those in the comparator group, the point estimates of the comparisons between rivaroxaban 
and comparator are similar. Therefore, there is no impact on the conclusions based on the results of the 
primary efficacy analysis. 
Ancillary analyses 
An exploratory analysis from study 14372 in patients with confirmed cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis 
(CVST) was performed.   
In addition to the efficacy and safety outcomes described for study 14372 above, a modified Rankin Scale, 
modified for assessment in young children, was applied to describe the functional outcome at the end of the 
main study treatment period at 3 months. Due to the large age range (birth to 17 years), a dichotomized 
version of the score was applied: children with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 were classified as having 
a favourable outcome, while children with a modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6 were classified as having a 
poor outcome. Classification of the dichotomized paediatric modified Rankin score was based on the local 
investigator’s assessment ‘Increased help for activities of daily living: requirement of (more) help with 
activities of daily living as before the CVST’ (if yes, outcome is scored as poor, if not, as favourable). A 
premorbid mRS of 0-2 for all patients was assumed. The blinded central adjudication committee evaluated 
this scale for each individual child based on the local assessment.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Studies 11702 were 2 multi-center, randomized, open-label, assessor-blind, event-driven, non-inferiority 
studies for efficacy with a study treatment duration of 3, 6, or 12 months among adult subjects having DVT 
(one study) or PE with or without DVT (one study). The primary efficacy objective in these studies was to 
show that rivaroxaban was non-inferior to Enoxaparin and VKA (acenocoumarol or warfarin) in the treatment 
of patients with acute symptomatic DVT or PE in terms of preventing recurrent VTE. 
An exploratory pooled analysis of studies 11702 and the paediatric study 14372, compared the incidences of 
selected efficacy events up to 3 months between treatment groups. The cumulative incidence of the primary 
endpoint and the corresponding Kaplan-Meier curves up to 3 months are presented in Table 24 and Figure 
7 for the rivaroxaban treated patients and in Table 25 and Figure 8 for the comparator treated patients 
these trials.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
Subjects with more than moderately impaired kidney dysfunction were excluded from the study. 
There were very few subjects with moderate kidney dysfunction (30 to < 50 mL/min/1.73m2); 2 in each 
treatment group (for children above 1 year of age; eGFR cannot be calculated for children below 1 year of 
age). There were 23 subjects with mild kidney dysfunction (50 to < 80 mL/min/1.73m2), 17 rivaroxaban 
treated and 6 in comparator group. A primary efficacy outcome event was not recorded for any of these 
patients.

Study 17618: 
Phase 1/2. Multicenter, open-label 7 days study of oral bodyweight adjusted rivaroxaban in suspension given 
b.i.d. or t.i.d. Primary objective: PK/PD profile. Secondary objectives: major/CRNM bleeding; recurrent VTE, 
asymptomatic deterioration 
Initially, children from birth to <6 months with catheter-related venous or arterial thrombosis with at least 2 
weeks of anticoagulant therapy were recruited. With an amendment, children from birth to <6 months with 
venous or arterial thrombosis with at least 5 days of anticoagulant therapy were recruited.

Results: 
10 children were valid for full analysis set (FAS). None of the 10 children had a confirmed symptomatic 
recurrent VTE during the treatment period or during the 30-day post study treatment period. Repeat imaging 
was available in 9/10 (90%) children in FAS. Of the 9 children who had repeat imaging, the thrombus burden 
was normalized in 5 (55.6%) children, improved in 3 (33.3%) children and unchanged in 1 (11.1%) child. 
None of the children had asymptomatic deterioration of the thrombus burden. 
Study 14373: 
Phase 2. Multicenter, single-arm 30 days study of oral age- and bodyweight-adjusted rivaroxaban in 
suspension or tablets. Primary objective: major/CRNM bleeding. Secondary objective: recurrent VTE; 
asymptomatic deterioration of thrombotic burden on repeat imaging; PK/PD profile of 30 days oral 
rivaroxaban treatment. 
Children aged 6-18 years with at least 2 months of anticoagulant treatment for a VTE (at least 6 weeks for 
catheter-related thrombosis) were included. 64 children formed the Full Analysis Set. 63 treated subjects 
received treatment and formed the Safety Analysis Set: 11 children aged 12-18 years received rivaroxaban 
o.d. as tablets. 13 children aged 12-18 years received comparator. 13 children aged 6-12 years received 
rivaroxaban o.d. as tablets. 19 children aged 6-12 years were administered rivaroxaban b.i.d. as oral 
suspension. 7 children aged 6-12 years received comparator (comparator cohort removed during the course 
of the study). 
Results 
None of the 63 children treated with study medication had a confirmed symptomatic recurrent VTE during the 
treatment period and during the 30-day post treatment period. Repeat imaging was available in only 43 
children (repeat imaging was introduced via an amendment during the course of the study). None of these 
had an asymptomatic deterioration of the thrombus burden upon repeat imaging. In the 33 children treated 
with rivaroxaban who had repeat imaging, the thrombus burden was normalized (9/33; 27.3%), improved 
(21/33; 63.6%) or unchanged (3/33; 9.1%). In the 10 children treated with comparator who had repeat 
imaging, the thrombosis burden was normalized (3/10; 30%), improved (4/10; 40%) and not evaluable 
(3/10; 30%). The distribution of adjudication outcomes was similar across age cohorts, formulations and 
treatment arms. 
Study 14374: 
Phase 2. Multicenter, single-arm 30 days study of oral age- and bodyweight-adjusted rivaroxaban in 
suspension. Primary objective: major/CRNM bleeding. Secondary objectives: recurrent VTE; asymptomatic 
deterioration of thrombotic burden on repeat imaging; PK/PD profile of 30 days oral rivaroxaban treatment. 
Children aged 6 months to <6 years with at least 2 months of anticoagulant treatment for a VTE (at least 6 
weeks for catheter-related thrombosis) were included. 46 children were valid for FAS and SAF:  25 children 
aged 2-6 years and 15 children aged 6 months-2 years received diluted rivaroxaban ready-to-use suspension 
b.i.d. 6 children aged 2-6 years received anticoagulation comparator (comparator cohort removed during the 
course of the study). 
Results 
None of the 46 children treated with study medication had a confirmed symptomatic recurrent VTE during the 
treatment period or during the 30-day post treatment period. Repeat imaging was available in 38/46 (82.6%) 
children. Of the 33 children in rivaroxaban groups, who had repeat imaging, the thrombus burden was

normalized in 10/33 (30.3%) children, improved in 19/33 (57%) children, and unchanged in 4/33 (12.1%) 
children. Of the 5 children in comparator group, who had repeat imaging, the thrombus burden was 
normalized in 1/5 (20%) child, improved in 3/5 (60%) children, and unchanged in 1/5 (20%) child. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study 14372 was an open-label, active-controlled, randomised phase III study to assess efficacy 
and safety of age- and body weight-adjusted rivaroxaban as compared to standard of care in children from 
birth to <18 years with acute VTE after at least 5 days of initial parenteral anticoagulant therapy. To reflect 
this the CHMP considered that the indication should be amended and specify the time period on parenteral 
anticoagulant therapy before rivaroxaban treatment can be initiated  Enrolment was staggered by age, 
starting with children aged 12 to <18 years; each subsequent age cohort was opened via a protocol 
amendment once the bodyweight-adjusted dose regimen had been determined in Phase 2 for the respective 
age groups. The study design is overall deemed adequate, and in line with the PIP and the scientific advice 
that the MAH received, in which the open-label design and was endorsed and the limitations were recognised 
with regards to feasibility of performing an adequately powered study in children providing statistically 
significant results, due to the rarity of VTE in the paediatric population.  
As discussed in the Paediatric Addendum on the guidelines on clinical investigation of medicinal products for 
the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease, there are some important differences 
between younger children and adults regarding clinical factors for VTE, course and response to VTE 
treatment. Therefore, relying entirely on an extrapolation of efficacy and safety data from adults based on 
similar exposure and PD data to support the paediatric indication would not be sufficient, and efficacy and 
safety data from children would still be required. Existing data in an indication already approved in adults 
(e.g.: treatment and secondary prevention of DVT/PE) could however, complement the results of the 
paediatric studies and further support the use in children based on the totality of the data without requesting 
a study powered to test a formal statistical hypothesis in children. 
The inclusion criteria allowed for a broad range of VTE subtypes, encompassing several VTE locations that 
have not been studied in adults; although this is reasonable, given the differences in VTE locations among 
children as compared to adults, this also suggests a heterogeneity in the study population in terms of VTE 
subtype . The children included were required to be expecting treatment with anticoagulant therapy for at 
least three months (one month for catheter-related thromboses in children <2 years); the rationale for 
expecting such length of therapy was at the discretion of the investigator. A large proportion of children with 
subacute or chronic CVC-VTE were included (44% of the CVC-VTE population), despite the aim of the study 
being at acute paediatric VTE, and a large proportion of children with CVC-VTE had asymptomatic VTE (40%). 
The exclusion criteria were considered reasonable, excluding in particular children at high risk of bleeding, 
children with more than moderately reduced renal function and children with hepatic impairment.  
Children with severe bleeding disorders were included, such as haemophilia with inhibitors. However, there 
were only 5 children (out of the 500 randomised children in the study) with underlying inherited or acquired 
bleeding disorders; their contribution to the overall data is considered negligible. 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 55/86 
  
  
 
There is no centrally approved anticoagulant product in the EU for treatment or secondary prevention of VTE 
in children. In large, the recommended choices and posologies for the comparator group are in line with 
widely recognised ACCP guidelines from 2012. VKA-treated patients were monitored to an INR 2-3. Most 
subjects in the comparator group were treated with LMWH with or without UFH; according to the MAH, it was 
assumed that monitoring of anti-FXa-activity in line with the ACCP guidelines would be performed, however, 
no data on actual monitoring and results thereof have been provided. In addition, the compliance for the 
comparator group could not be robustly assessed, as in 72/162 children, locally dispensed comparator 
treatment was used and thus could not be returned for compliance check. 
The outcomes are deemed clinically relevant, with the primary efficacy outcome being symptomatic recurrent 
VTE, similar to the pivotal DVT/LE studies in adults. The composite secondary endpoint consists of the 
primary endpoint combined with asymptomatic deterioration at repeat imaging; the latter is considered 
clinically relevant as it could relate to an increased risk of complications and affect treatment decisions. As 
noted in the Paediatric Addendum on the guidelines on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the 
treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease, thrombotic burden definitions available in 
adults have not been validated in children, which prevents for inclusion as part of the primary efficacy 
endpoint in confirmatory trials; however, deterioration in thrombotic burden has been associated with poor 
long term outcomes and post-thrombotic syndrome in both adult and paediatric thrombosis. All primary and 
secondary efficacy outcome events were adjudicated by a blinded adjudication committee. 
Neither VTE-related death or all-cause mortality were included in the primary or secondary efficacy 
outcomes, which is considered a draw-back of the study design; only fatal pulmonary embolism was included 
as an ‘other efficacy outcome’. Since no claim vs comparator were prespecified, and the actual deaths 
reported during the study (see Clinical safety section of this report) were deemed to be unrelated to either 
study treatment or VTE, omission of these endpoints is not considered of major importance. 
The study aimed at assessing incidences of the primary efficacy outcomes; no claims with regards to 
rivaroxaban versus comparator were prespecified. Primarily, incidence proportions were calculated for the 
efficacy outcomes by treatment group at the end of the main treatment period for the combined data over all 
children and by classification of index event. In exploratory analyses statistical models were fitted in order to 
compare outcomes between rivaroxaban and standard of care.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The incidence of the primary efficacy outcome event was low in both treatment groups, with numerically 
fewer events in the rivaroxaban group (4/329 = 1.2%; 95% CI 0.4-3.0%) in rivaroxaban group, and 5/162 = 
3.1%; 95% CI 1.2-6.7%) in the comparator group during the main study treatment period of 3 months (1 
month for children < 2 years with catheter-related thrombosis). Asymptomatic deterioration on repeat 
imaging, which constituted the other part of the composite secondary efficacy outcome, occurred in only one 
child in each treatment group during main treatment period.  
The assessment of thrombotic burden at repeated imaging showed normalisation or improvement in more 
than two thirds of subjects, with a higher proportion of subjects achieving normalisation in the rivaroxaban 
group. The incidences for the primary efficacy outcome during the main treatment period are slightly lower 
than what has been described for paediatric recurrent VTE during anticoagulation; in the REVIVE trial 
(Massicotte P et al 2003), recurrent VTE occurred in 5.6% and 10% of patients during three months of 
treatment with reviparin-sodium and UFH/oral anticoagulation respectively, however, absolute number of 
participants was low (36 and 40 in each treatment group). During the extended treatment period, only three

Page 56/86 
  
  
primary efficacy events occurred in total (1 in the rivaroxaban group at day 223 and 2 in the comparator 
group, at day 98 and 211); all events occurred in adolescents and affected the same location as the index 
event in two of three subjects. All subjects had a non-CVC-VTE index event. A large discrepancy between 
suspected and adjudicated primary efficacy outcome events is noted: during the main and extended 
treatment periods, recurrent VTE was adjudicated in 8.3% of 60 suspected cases in the rivaroxaban group 
and in 21.9% of 32 suspected cases in the comparator group, respectively, and was thus refuted in the vast 
majority of cases. This discrepancy is considered explained primarily by the fact that also events that were 
locally considered to be refuted were to be reported. 
135 subjects with CVST, non-CVC-VTE or CVC-VTE >/= 2 years were included in the first extension period 
(3-6 months) in the rivaroxaban group (63 subjects in comparator group) and 53 subjects with CVST, non-
CVC-VTE or CVC-VTE >/= 2 years were included in the second extension period (6-9 months) in the 
rivaroxaban group (24 subjects in the comparator group). However, exposure beyond 3 months was very 
limited in the youngest children, with only two subjects <2 years of age in the rivaroxaban group and one 
subject in the comparator group. 
The four primary efficacy events during main treatment in the rivaroxaban group occurred in adolescents 
(which was the most populous age group) and were non-CVC-related VTE occurring at same site as index 
event. In both treatment groups, the recurrent VTEs occurred early, with no primary efficacy events after day 
30. 
Additional expert consultation 
The Scientific Advisory Group on Cardiovascular Issues (SAG-CVS) was asked to provide their view on the 
following issues: 
1.  The MAH is proposing an indication including children of all ages. However, the experience of 
using rivaroxaban in children younger than 2 years is limited and safety in this age group is 
currently questioned. 
a.  Please discuss the adequacy of extrapolating efficacy and safety data from adults to 
the youngest children based on the known age-related development of haemostasis. 
b.  Please discuss the acceptability of the increased incidence of bleedings in this age 
group compare to standard of care (for treatment emergent bleedings in age group 
birth to < 0.5 years, incidence 5/15 children (33.3%) in the rivaroxaban group and 0/8 
(0%) in the comparator SOC group; for age group 0.5-2 years, incidence 8/21 (38.1%) 
in the rivaroxaban group and 3/9 (33.3%) in comparator group. 
c.  Should particular precautions be applied in the youngest children if rivaroxaban is 
approved in all age groups? 
The experts advised that the optimal target International Normalised Ratios (INRs) for anti-coagulation in 
the paediatric population are not precisely known due to the lack of randomised data in these patients.  
This uncertainty therefore limits any extrapolation between adult and paediatric patients. The Group 
noted that the results from the submitted randomised trial in very young patients were limited, but larger 
than any other randomized studies. This is due to the rarity of the condition in this population but also 
the difficulties to enrol such patients in randomised trials. 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 57/86 
  
  
Despite these limitations, the Group considered that the use of rivaroxaban in all paediatric patients is 
sufficiently supported by the results from the trial, as a similar efficacy and safety profile to what has 
been previously shown in adult patients was observed.  With regards to the small increased incidence of 
bleedings in the rivaroxaban treated patients, the experts advised that  the nature of these events, for 
which no sequalae was reported, did not raise concern for the use of rivaroxaban also in the very young 
patients or the need for specific precautions in this age group. One expert suggested PK monitoring in 
some very specific paediatric groups to establish anti-coagulation ranges in e.g. small bowel disease. The 
Group stressed the difficulties associated with SOC in terms of administration and monitoring and 
considered that the benefits of having an oral preparation available in clinical in practice outweighs the 
small increased risk of bleeding. In this context the group noted the benefits of making rivaroxaban also 
available to the youngest age group.  
Due  to  the  small  number  of  patients  included  in  the  trial,  the  experts  emphasized  the  need  for  a  post-
authorisation study to better characterise the safety profile of rivaroxaban in the paediatric population as 
the only way of further characterising the use of rivaroxaban in the very young children. 
2.  The proposed paediatric target population includes some types of VTE for which extrapolation 
of efficacy and safety from adults is not possible, and thus the evidence relies more heavily on 
the observed paediatric data from the phase III study. This is of particular concern for 
cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis (CVST) and catheter-related thrombosis (CVC-VTE).  
a.  Concerning CVST, please discuss the importance and acceptability of the relatively high 
risks of bleedings as indicated from the pivotal clinical study (incidence of major 
bleeding + clinically relevant non-major bleeding 6.8% in the rivaroxaban group and 
2.3 % in comparator SOC group; incidence of any bleedings 35.1% in the rivaroxaban 
group vs 30.2% in comparator group) considering that this is a condition which is 
known to be associated with intracerebral haemorrhage. Are there subpopulations 
(age, disease states, underlying disease conditions) or instances of CVST where the 
risk of bleeding may be too high? Is the proposed treatment duration (at least 3 
months) adequate? Is there a need for particular precautions/monitoring? Based on 
what is known about paediatric CVST, please discuss the adequacy of extrapolating 
data on efficacy and safety of treatment with rivaroxaban in older children with CVST to 
children < 2 years of age, for whom there is very little data in the phase III study (no 
data at all for children < 0.5 years of age)? 
b.   As reflected in the literature the overall benefits of anticoagulation are generally 
less clear for CVC-VTE than for other paediatric VTE-subtypes. Considering this, please 
discuss the acceptability of the documented bleeding rates (treatment-emergent 
bleedings 31.0% in the rivaroxaban group vs 21.6% in the comparator SOC group). 
Also discuss the relevance of the duration of anticoagulation proposed in the current 
rivaroxaban SmPC (at least 1 month). Are there particular subpopulations or instances 
of CVC-VTE where the risk of bleeding is considered too high? Please discuss the 
relevance of data on efficacy and safety in subjects with chronic or sub-acute CVC-VTE 
(44% of the CVC-VTE population in study 14372) for the proposed target indication. 
The Group noted the imbalance in the incidence of bleedings between rivaroxaban and Standard of Care 
(SOC) treated patients with CVST and CVC-VTE. The Group advised that these findings are in line with 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 58/86 
  
  
 
what has been observed in adult patients and are to be expected following treatment with an inhibitor of 
Factor Xa. Importantly, no intracranial bleeding was reported in patients treated with rivaroxaban. The 
Group, however, advised caution in patients with inflammatory intracranial conditions including 
meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscesses and recommended a contraindication for these 
conditions. The Group did not identify a need for any particular precautions in patients with CVST and 
CVC-VTE.   
Regarding duration of treatment, the Group noted that in paediatric patients this has not been well 
defined and is largely extrapolated from adult data. The Group advised that duration of treatment in 
these patients as proposed by the MAH are in line with current treatment guidelines which recommend a 
3-month course of anticoagulation for paediatric patients with provoked VTE and a shorter, 6-week 
course, of anticoagulation in certain instances such as CVC-VTE.  
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy data provided are considered sufficient to support the use of rivaroxaban for the treatment and 
secondary prevention of VTE in children.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Paediatric safety data are available from 6 studies summarised in Table 26.  
Table 21. Overview of rivaroxaban paediatric development program: relevant studies for Safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 59/86 
  
  
 
 
 
 
However, the MAH considered that for most age cohorts, pooling did not increase the sample size 
substantially (beyond the Phase 3 study). In addition, pool-ability of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 data was 
limited due to the different rivaroxaban dosing schedules, and duration and timing of study treatment. 
Therefore, pivotal safety data for this application were from the large phase III study 14372. Information 
from the other paediatric studies was provided as supportive data. 
In the phase III study 14372, patients aged birth to < 18 years,  received initial treatment with therapeutic 
doses of UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux for at least 5 days, and were randomised 2:1 to receive either 
rivaroxaban or comparator group (heparins, VKA) for a main study treatment period of 3 months (1 month 
for children < 2 years with CVC-VTE). Rivaroxaban was administered as either tablets or as granules for oral 
suspension. The study treatment could be stopped at this point, or at the discretion of the Investigator 
continued for up to 12 months (for children < 2 years with CVC VTE up to 3 months) in total. Cumulative 
treatment durations are provided in Tables 27 and 28 for children aged ≥2 years and < 2 years with CVC 
VTE respectively.

Mean treatment duration during the main treatment period for children with CVST, non-CVC-VTE, or aged ≥2 
years with CVC-VTE treated with rivaroxaban was 88.0 days and for children treated with comparator 86.7 
days. For children aged <2 years with CVC-VTE treated with rivaroxaban, mean treatment duration during 
main period was 29.8 days and in children treated with comparator 29.5 days. The overall mean study 
treatment duration was for children with CVST, non-CVC-VTE, or CVC-VTE aged ≥ 2 years 149.0 days in the 
rivaroxaban group and 146.3 days in the comparator group. For children with CVC-VTE <2 years, the overall 
mean study treatment duration was 60.9 days for rivaroxaban and 62.7 days for the comparator. 
For children 12->18 years, the majority had a non-CVC VTE as the index event while for subjects 6<12 and 
2->6 years, CVST was most common. For subjects from birth to <2 years, CVC-VTE was the most common 
index event. A majority of VTE cases were provoked, 90.4% (rivaroxaban) and 81.8% (comparator). The 
most frequent persistent risk factors were major organ disease (18.8% rivaroxaban vs 12.1% comparator) 
and active cancer (11.9% rivaroxaban vs 9.7% comparator). A total of 95.1% of the children received at 
least one concomitant medication. Please refer also to clinical efficacy assessment for a presentation of 
demographic data. 
Adverse events 
Overview of adverse events in phase III study 14372 
A summary of TEAEs in SAF during the main treatment period is found in Table 29. 
Table 24. Study 14372 - Overall summary of number of children with TEAEs during the main treatment 
period i.e. up to the end of the main treatment period (SAF) 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 61/86 
  
  
 
 
 
 
After the main treatment phase, at least one TEAE occurred in 130 (26.5%) of the 491 children: 91 (27.7%) 
in the rivaroxaban group and 39 (24.1%) in the comparator group. SAEs were reported for 13/329 (4.0%) 
children in the rivaroxaban group, and 6/162 (3.7%) children in the comparator group. 
In total, 421/491 children (85.7%) had at least one AE (i.e. also taking into account AEs that were not 
TEAEs): 88.1% in the rivaroxaban group and 80.9% in the comparator group. In the rivaroxaban group, AEs 
were reported as recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, not recovered/resolved in 50.5%, 10.9%, and 
25.4% of children, as compared to 37.0%, 8.6% and 27.2% of children in the comparator group. The worst 
outcome was reported as “fatal” for two children in the rivaroxaban group. At least one SAE occurred in 122 
(24.8%) children: 25.5% in the rivaroxaban group and 23.5% in the comparator group. SAEs were reported 
as recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, not recovered/resolved in 21.9%, 1.2%, and 1.8% or children, 
respectively, in the rivaroxaban group, and in 18.5%, 1.2%, and 2.5% of children in the comparator group. 
As stated above, the worst outcome was reported as “fatal” for two children in the rivaroxaban group (see 
section below: 4.4 Serious adverse events and deaths). 
Common Adverse events 
The most common TEAEs occurring with an incidence of ≥ 10% were (SAF, main treatment period):  
• 
• 
Rivaroxaban: headache (17%), epistaxis (11.2%), vomiting (10.6%), pyrexia (10.3%) 
Comparator: headache (14.8%), epistaxis (11.1%) 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Incidences by MedDRA terms were described for the following AEs defined as AEs of special interest: (1) 
Liver-related AEs or concurrent elevations of ALT >5x ULN and total bilirubin >2x ULN, (2) Thrombocytopenia 
or treatment-emergent platelet count< 50 109/L and (3) Treatment-emergent drug-related allergic skin 
reactions, allergic systemic reactions. 
One case in the rivaroxaban group was reported with a liver-related AESI (0.3%), and 1 case in each 
treatment group was observed with thrombocytopenia (0.3% rivaroxaban vs 0.6% comparator), for 
suspected/confirmed allergic skin/systemic reactions, there were 24 (7.3%) in the rivaroxaban group and 13 
(8.0%) in the comparator group (SAF, main treatment period), see also below under the heading “Laboratory 
findings”. 
ALT > 5x ULN (upper limit of normal) with TB > 2x ULN was reported for 2/329 children (0.6%) in the 
rivaroxaban group during the main treatment period. One event was related to cardiogenic shock prior to 
heart transplant; it was not considered as treatment emergent as the child had discontinued study 
medication more than 2 days before the event. For the other event, ALT and TB had already increased prior 
to study drug medication.

Bleeding events 
Definitions of bleedings and principal safety outcome (major + CRNM bleedings) 
The principal safety outcome in study 14372 was the composite of treatment-emergent overt major bleeding 
and CRNM bleeding, as defined in Table 30.   
Table 25. Definition of bleeding events in study 14372 
Treatment-emergent was defined as occurring after randomization until the last intake of study drug plus 2 
days. Bleeding events with onset on the day of randomization are considered only if the investigator stated 
that the event was related to the study drug. 
Principal safety outcome during main treatment period 
Clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 10 children (3%; all CRNM bleeding) in the rivaroxaban group and in 3 
children (1.9%; 2 major bleeding, 1 CRNM bleeding) in the comparator group. No major bleeding was seen 
under rivaroxaban treatment. The principal safety outcome by index event and age group during the main 
treatment period is shown in Table 31. 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 63/86 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 26. Study 14372 - Incidence of treatment-emergent principal safety outcome during the main 
treatment period by index event and age group (SAF) 
Principal safety outcomes in the rivaroxaban group occurred in individual children in all bodyweight groups 
except ‘weight 20 to < 30 kg’. In the comparator group, 2/77 children with a bodyweight of ≥ 50 kg and 
1/7 children with a body weight of 5 to < 10 kg had a principal safety outcome. 
4.0% (5/125) of children taking rivaroxaban tablets and 2.5% (5/204) taking the rivaroxaban suspension 
reported a principal safety outcome vs 1.9% (3/162) of children taking the comparator. 
Principal safety outcome during extended treatment period 
During extended treatment period 1, there was 1 principal safety outcome (CRNM) in the rivaroxaban group, 
the event occurred in the age group 12-<18 years. During extended treatment period 2, there were 2 
principal safety outcomes (CRNM) in the rivaroxaban group and 1 in the comparator group. The event in the 
comparator group and one of the events in the rivaroxaban group occurred in the age group 12-<18 years 
while the other event in the rivaroxaban group occurred in the age group <2 years. During extended 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020

treatment period 3, no primary safety outcomes were reported. No major bleedings were recorded during 
treatment extension. 
Thus, overall, the incidence of the principal safety outcome in the SAF were during the main and extended 
treatment periods in total 4.0% (13/329) and 2.5% (4/162). 
Principal safety outcome during follow-up period 
Two incidences of principal safety outcome were reported in the rivaroxaban group during follow-up period. 
One of the children was receiving anticoagulant therapy at the time of the event. 
All confirmed treatment-emergent bleedings during main treatment period 
The number of children with treatment-emergent bleeding by age groups during the main treatment period is 
displayed in Table 32. 
Table 27. Study 14372 – Number of children with confirmed treatment-emergent bleeding during the main 
treatment period by age group, category and site (SAF) 
Assessment report

Page 65/86 
  
  
 
  
The incidence of confirmed treatment-emergent bleedings up to the end of main treatment period by weight 
group (safety analysis set) was also presented. In the lightest children i.e children included in the weight 
group<5 kg, the incidence was 5/13 (38.5%) in the rivaroxaban group vs 0/7 (0% in the comparator). In the 
group 5-<10 kg, the incidences were  40.0% vs 42.9%, in 10 - <20 kg 26.4% vs 26.1%, in 20 - <30 kg 
26.2% vs  15.8%, in 30 - <40 kg 36.4% vs 23.1%, in 40 - <50 kg 26.9% vs  31.3% and in >= 50 kg  
43.0% vs 32.5%.  
Children with non-CVC-VTE had the highest incidence of treatment-emergent bleeding events (39.3% in the 
rivaroxaban group vs 29.3% in the comparator group) followed by children with CVST (35.1% rivaroxaban vs 
30.2% comparator), and by children with CVC-VTE (31.0% rivaroxaban vs 21.6% comparator). 
Analysis of incidence of all confirmed treatment-emergent bleedings up to the end of main treatment period 
by formulation, showed that 32.4% that received the rivaroxaban suspension, 42.4% that received 
rivaroxaban tablets and 27.8% that received the comparator had such event. 
All confirmed treatment-emergent bleedings during the overall duration of treatment 
Incidence of all confirmed treatment-emergent bleedings, for the overall duration of treatment (SAF) were 
also presented; 130/329 (39.5%) in the rivaroxaban group and 49/162 (30.3%) had such event. In the 
group birth<0.5 years, there were 6/15 (40%) with any confirmed bleeding in the rivaroxaban group and 0/8 
(0%) in the comparator group. 
Composite of symptomatic recurrent VTE and major bleeding at the end of the main treatment period 
The incidence (95% CI) of the composite of symptomatic recurrent VTE and major bleeding (in FAS) was 
1.2% (0.4-3.0%) in the rivaroxaban group and 4.2 % (2.0-8.4%) in the Comparator group. 
Other safety outcomes: Menstrual bleedings and vascular events 
Approximately one half to two thirds of the girls in the rivaroxaban group, and one third to two thirds of the 
children in the comparator group who had menstrual bleeding, had menstrual bleeding that was “more than 
usual” in intensity. 
There were no myocardial infarctions, cerebrovascular accidents, non-CNS systemic reported. 
AEs in the other paediatric studies: phase I-II studies 
In none of the five phase I-II studies, deaths or major bleedings were reported for rivaroxaban treated 
subjects but CRNM bleedings and more trivial bleedings were reported. As presented above, the new granules 
for oral suspension formulation was not used in all these studies. 
Two of the studies; 17992 (Phase 1) and 17618 (Phase 1/2) included subjects that were <0.5 years of age, 
in none of these studies any CRNM bleedings were reported. In total, these studies included 12 subjects that 
were <0.5 years of age (2+10 subjects).   
In study 17992 (in which subjects received rivaroxaban granules for oral suspension formulation) it is stated 
that 2 children were included in Group C that enrolled Children with an age ≥ 2 months and no confirmed 
bleedings or TEAEs was recorded in this group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 66/86 
  
  
 
 
In study 17618, 10 children from birth to <6 months were included (subjects received diluted “ready-to-use” 
suspension, n=4 and granules for oral suspension n=6). There was a non-TESAE of cardiac arrest. The 
cardiac arrest was occurred in infant patient with congenital hypoplastic left heart syndrome who completed 
the 7-day treatment course of rivaroxaban and was hospitalized with severe cardiac dysfunction and cardiac 
arrest nearly 4 weeks (27 days) after completion of rivaroxaban treatment. The event was considered 
unrelated to rivaroxaban. No death, major bleeding or other bleeding events occurred. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
The overall incidence of any TESAE across the two treatment groups was 21.6% in the rivaroxaban and 
19.8% in the comparator group 
The most commonly affected SOCs in the rivaroxaban group were ‘blood and lymphatic system disorders’ and 
‘gastrointestinal disorders’(3.0% each vs 1.9% each in the comparator group), whereas ‘infections and 
infestations’ and ‘nervous system disorders’ were more common in the comparator group (6.2% and 5.6%, 
respectively, vs 4.9% and 2.7% with rivaroxaban). In most cases, the events were reported as 
recovering/resolved or recovering/resolving. 
The most common TESAEs with ≥ 4% incidence by age group are provided in Table 33.

treatment period (SAF)

EMA/647126/2020 
Page 67/86 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
The overall incidence of any drug-related TESAE was 2.1% in the rivaroxaban group and 1.2% in the 
comparator group (summarised in Table 34). 
Table 29. Study 14372 - Number of children with study drug-related TESAEs by primary system organ class 
and preferred term during the main treatment period (SAF) 
There were two fatal events in the phase III study, both of which were assessed as unrelated to the study 
drug by the investigator. 
Laboratory findings 
For the phase 3 study; laboratory parameters for Hb, platelets, ALT, creatinine, bilirubin/direct bilirubin were 
collected at screening and, with the exception of serum creatinine, at Visit 4; Day 90 (Visit 2; Day 30 for 
children with CVC-VTE aged < 2 years).  
Treatment-emergent high or low laboratory abnormalities by laboratory category and treatment (safety 
analysis set) are presented in Tables 35 and 36 respectively.

Table 31. Study 14372-Number of subjects with treatment-emergent low laboratory abnormalities by 
laboratory category and treatment (safety analysis set) 
During the main treatment period of the phase III study, a platelet count below 50x109/L was reported for 
12/329 children (3.6%) in the rivaroxaban group, and for 3/162 children (1.9%) in the comparator group. All 
but 2 events were related to chemotherapy. Only one of those 2 cases was reported in the rivaroxaban 
group, and  had started before use of rivaroxaban and could be explained by another concomitant 
medication.  
No clinically relevant laboratory findings were found in the phase 1 and 2 studies. 
Safety in special populations 
Out of 2 children with moderate kidney dysfunction, 1 had a principal safety outcome. No child in the 
comparator group and no child with mild kidney dysfunction had a principal safety outcome. 
No clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment since based on exclusion criterion 3, children 
presenting with hepatic disease associated with either coagulopathy leading to a clinically relevant bleeding 
risk, or ALT >5x ULN or TB >2x ULN with direct bilirubin >20% of the total were excluded.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Based on the physicochemical properties of rivaroxaban and based on PK data obtained in adults, in all 
studies children received rivaroxaban tablet or oral suspension during or closely after feeding or meal intake 
and with a typical serving of drink to ensure reliable rivaroxaban dosing in children. In line with data obtained 
in adults, a decrease in relative bioavailability for increasing doses (in mg/kg bodyweight) was found, 
suggesting absorption limitations for higher doses also in children, even when taken with food. No further 
analyses on drug-food interactions in children were conducted.  
Based on the data obtained in adults, concomitant use of strong inhibitors of both cytochrome P450 
isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), as well as concomitant use of strong inducers of CYP3A4 
were excluded per protocol in all paediatric studies.  In the integrated rivaroxaban popPK model for adult 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 69/86 
  
  
 
 
 
 
patients, weak, moderate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, P-gp inhibitors and CYP3A4 inducers were identified 
as covariates. Therefore, the influence of these five classes of medications, when taken concomitantly and via 
administration routes which may result in relevant systemic exposure, on rivaroxaban clearance in children 
was explored. Overall, results did not indicate a new drug-drug interaction potential not already known from 
adults.  
As an anticoagulant, rivaroxaban has the potential to interact with other drugs that influence the coagulation 
system. The potential for pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions (LMWH, anti-platelet agents, NSAIDs, 
VKA) was studied in adults. No dedicated pharmacodynamic interaction studies were performed in children. 
As only a very limited number of bleeding events were observed in the paediatric studies, no meaningful sub-
analysis could be performed to evaluate the potential pharmacodynamic interaction in children. It is however, 
expected that co-administration of antiplatelet or anti-inflammatory agents or anticoagulants will result in 
similar effects as those observed in adults. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Table 37 summarises the incidence of TEAEs that led to discontinuation of study drug during the main 
treatment period of the phase III study by SOC and MedDRA PT. 
Table 32. Study 14372-Number of children with TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug due to 
adverse events during the main treatment period (SAF)

Page 70/86 
  
  
 
 
A total of 4 (1.2%) of the 329 children in the rivaroxaban group who continued study medication after the 
main study treatment period discontinued study drug at least once due to an AE: the preferred terms 
reported were anaemia and haemorrhagic ovarian cyst, nephropathy, rash, and mastoidectomy. No 
discontinuations due to AEs were reported for the 162 children in the comparator group who continued study 
medication after the main study treatment period. 
Post marketing experience 
Cases of rivaroxaban exposure in children outside the sponsor’s paediatric clinical development program have 
been routinely reviewed in XARELTO PSURs /PBRERs and relates to exposure via parent, accidental use by 
children, medication errors, overdose and occasional intentional use for medical purpose.  
Between the start of rivaroxaban marketing in 2008 and 15 JUN 2019 (data lock point for this analysis), the 
sponsor’s global safety database accumulated 292 post marketing cases involving rivaroxaban use in children 
aged less than 18 year.  
In 5 of the 292 cases, events of overdose (with 2 cases specifically reporting the event of intentional 
overdose) were reported: 1 non-serious case with an accidental overdose and 4 serious cases including 2 
serious events of overdose, 1 serious event of intentional overdose and 1 non-serious event of intentional 
overdose. Altogether, in 37 (12.7%) of the 292 cases events of accidental exposure to product were 
reported, with 34 cases more specifically reporting the event of accidental exposure to product by child, and 
1 of these overlapping with the non-serious event of accidental overdose. No fatalities were reported. 12 of 
the 41 cases reporting events of overdose and accidental exposure to product were assessed as serious and 
29 were assessed as non-serious. Most of the cases were only reporting information on circumstances of 
exposure (medication error, overdose, etc.) without reference to any harm to patient’s health. In 31 of the 
41 cases the outcome of the reported events was reported as unknown or no information on the outcome of 
the events were reported. Only in 1 case the outcome of the event of accidental exposure to the product was 
reported as not recovered / not resolved at the time of the reporting. However, no symptoms were reported 
at the time of reporting. In 1 case in which rivaroxaban film-coated tablet was used for deep vein thrombosis, 
the outcome of the event of overdose was reported as recovered/ resolved with sequelae. In 8 of the 41 
cases with reported events of overdose and accidental exposure to product, the outcome of the events was 
reported as recovered/resolved or recovering/resolving.  
Bleeding was reported in 32/115 serious cases of children who were exposed to rivaroxaban outside the 
sponsor’s paediatric clinical development program and in 40/292 cases overall, and comprised of 4 cases of 
gastrointestinal bleeding events, 9 cases of epistaxis, 8 cases of menorrhagia, 2 cases of vaginal 
haemorrhage, 1 case of menometrorrhagia, 1 case of penile haemorrhage, and 1 case each of periorbital 
haematoma and retinal haemorrhage.  
Overall, no particular risk was identified in these case reviews resulting from rivaroxaban exposure in children 
aged less than 18 years.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Nature of safety data and extent of exposure 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 71/86 
  
  
 
Paediatric safety data in support for this application are derived from 6 studies: two phase 1 studies (single-
dose, tablets/diluted/undiluted ready-to-use oral suspension in the first study, granules for oral suspension 
formulation in the second), one phase 1/2 study (7-day, diluted “ready-to-use” suspension and granules for 
oral suspension), two phase 2 studies (30 days, tablets and diluted ready-to-use oral suspension in the first, 
diluted ready-to-use suspension in the second) and one phase 3 study (>3 months, tablets or as granules for 
oral suspension). Safety analysis set (SAF) included all randomized children who received at least one dose of 
study medication: n= 528 patients. In the phase III, Study 14372, a total of 491 children; 329 rivaroxaban, 
162 comparator, were included in the SAF; analysis of the SAF was performed according “as treated” and 
MAH’s safety evaluation focused on  “treatment-emergent” AEs i.e. TEAEs (events occurring after 
randomization until the last intake of study medication plus 2 days) that happened during the main treatment 
period.  
As dosing of rivaroxaban cannot be reliably determined in children less than 6 months of age who at birth 
had less than 37 weeks of gestation, or have a body weight of less than 2.6 kg, or have had less than 
10 days of oral feeding use in such patients is not recommended.  . 
The safety results from the Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical studies were pooled as pre-specified. However, the MAH 
focused mainly on the pivotal phase III for the safety evaluation. This is accepted although, the safety 
outcome of the other paediatric studies are considered as supportive data, especially for age cohorts for 
which the phase III study only provided a limited number of subjects. In the age group <0.5 years, there 
were only 15 included rivaroxaban-treated children in the phase III study but an additional 12 more 
rivaroxaban-treated children in the other studies.  
A total of 304 (90.7%) of the 335 children randomized to rivaroxaban and 148 (89.7%) of the 165 children 
randomized to the comparator group completed study treatment in accordance with the per protocol 
treatment window for the main treatment period, defined as 30 days ± 7 days for children with CVC-VTE < 2 
years and 90 ± 7 days for the remaining children. 3/26 (11.5%) in the rivaroxaban group < 2 years of age 
with CVC-VTE were treated for a shorter period than 23 days (0/11 in comparator group).  
The phase III study included 117 subjects (including 80 in the rivaroxaban group) exposed at least 6 months 
and 15 subjects (including 9 in the rivaroxaban group) exposed at least 12 months. This is in line with the 
scientific advice that the MAH had received for the data required to support a secondary prevention indication 
for which the CHMP considered that an extension of the study (up to 6 months) would be preferred in 
conjunction with the supportive information available from the adult population.  For children < 2 years of 
age, there were only two subjects in the rivaroxaban group and one subject in the comparator group 
receiving treatment for more than 3 months. Moreover, extrapolation from adults in this population is limited 
due to developmental haemostasis in the young children, 
The proposed posology section states that treatment can be extended up to 12 months when clinically 
necessary (except for patients <2 years, or in cases of CVC-VTE). In addition, prescribers are advised that 
the benefit-risk of continued therapy after 3 months should be assessed on an individual basis taking into 
account the risk for recurrent thrombosis vs the potential bleeding risk.   
The experts from the SAG meeting also advised caution for use of rivaroxaban in patients with CVST and 
inflammatory intracranial conditions including meningitis, encephalitis and intracranial abscesses. Based on 
the data from study 14372, the CHMP did consider a contraindication in these patients necessary. None of the 
children in the rivaroxaban group who had a concomitant CVST and CNS infection had a treatment-emergent 
major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding event. Nevertheless, the amount of data is limited (13 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 72/86 
  
  
 
children in the rivaroxaban group) and there was one major bleeding in the comparator group in a child with 
concomitant CVST and CNS infection, suggesting that special caution could be warranted in this setting. 
Therefore, a warning has been included in the SmPC that the risk of bleeding should be carefully evaluated 
before and during therapy with rivaroxaban in such patients. 
Adverse events  
Treatment-emergent adverse events, serious treatment-emergent adverse events and treatment-emergent 
adverse event leading to discontinuation of study drug were all higher in the rivaroxaban group as compared 
to in the comparator group in the phase III study 14372.  
The incidence of the principal safety outcome during the main treatment period (major bleeding + clinically 
relevant non-major bleeding) was also numerically higher in the rivaroxaban group (10 children, 3%; all 
CRNM bleeding) compared to the comparator group (3 children, 1.9%; 2 major bleeding, 1 CRNM bleeding) 
and there were additional events recorded during the extended treatment periods and during follow-up.  
The proportion of children with any confirmed treatment-emergent bleeding during the main treatment period 
was 36.2% in the rivaroxaban group compared to 27.8% in the comparator group. In the clinical studies, 
mucosal bleedings (i.e. epistaxis, gingival, gastrointestinal, genitourinary including abnormal vaginal or 
increased menstrual bleeding) and anaemia were seen more frequent during long term rivaroxaban 
treatment compared with VKA treatment. Thus, in addition to adequate clinical surveillance, laboratory 
testing of haemoglobin/haematocrit could be of value to detect occult bleeding and quantify the clinical 
relevance of overt bleeding, as judged to be appropriate.  
With regards to safety in the different age strata, it is noted that in the youngest strata, i.e. birth to <0.5 
years, 5/15 children (33.3%) in the rivaroxaban group had any confirmed treatment-emergent bleeding 
during the main treatment period by age group as compared to 0/8 (0%) of the comparator group. 
Considering the overall treatment period, there was one additional subject with a bleeding in the rivaroxaban 
group and none in the comparator group and in addition there were two post-treatment bleedings in the 
rivaroxaban group compared to none in the comparator group. This observation was mirrored in the outcome 
of the incidence of confirmed treatment-emergent bleedings by weight group. For children < 2 years of age, 
15/36 (41.7%) children in the rivaroxaban group had a treatment-emergent bleed during the entire study 
period, 3 of which were CRNM bleeding. Thirteen of these occurred during the main treatment period (2 of 
which were CRNM bleeding). For the comparator in the same age group, there were 3/17 (17.6%) subjects 
with a treatment-emergent bleeding during the entire study period, 1 of which was a major bleeding. All 
bleeding episodes occurred during the main treatment period. Repeat bleeding events for children < 2 years 
of age was noted only in the rivaroxaban group; there were in total 20 treatment-emergent bleeding events 
during the main treatment period, 6 of which were CRNM. No child in the comparator group had a repeat 
bleed. The relevance of these findings is underlined by the fact that they concern an age group for which 
extrapolation from adults is less straight forward than for the elderly children. In order to better characterise 
the risk of bleeding in the young paediatric population the MAH will conduct a post-authorisation safety study 
will investigate the safety of rivaroxaban granules for oral suspension in at least 50 very young (< 2 years of 
age) VTE patients from start of rivaroxaban treatment until 1 month (30 days) after stop of treatment and 
children with VTE treated with other anticoagulants. 
Thrombocytopenia which is known to be adverse reaction in the adult population was also observed in the 
paediatric clinical trials and this is reflected in the SmPC which states that “Thrombocytopenia as observed in 
the post-marketing experience in adult population was common (4.6%) in paediatric clinical trials”. Increases 
in alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin were also observed and are adequately reflected in the PIL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 73/86 
  
  
Accidental over- and underdose was overall more frequent in the rivaroxaban group than in the comparator 
group in the phase III study. Although the incidences were relatively low also in the rivaroxaban group, these 
events can be expected to occur more frequently post-approval as compared to the controlled study-setting. 
For this reason, medication errors in relation to the reconstitution of the oral suspension and dosing with the 
new pharmaceutical form 1 mg/mL granules for oral suspension has been included in the RMP as an 
important potential risk. Additional risk minimisation measures in the form of educational material for the 
prescribers, an educational video showing how to prepare and administer the oral suspension and a patient 
alert card together with the information included in the SmPC and PIL are considered sufficient to minimise 
this risk. 
Safety in special populations and related to interactions 
The analysis of the impact of kidney function on rivaroxaban exposure did not reveal any influence of renal 
function on the rivaroxaban PK/PD in children, which might be explained by the fact that the majority of 
patients in the paediatric studies had normal kidney function. Rivaroxaban is not recommended in children 1 
year or older with moderate or severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 or 
in children younger than 1 year with serum creatinine results above 97.5th percentile, as no clinical data are 
available. 
No clinical data is available in children with hepatic impairment.  According to the MAH, overall results did not 
indicate a new drug-drug interaction potential not already known from adults (see also section on clinical 
pharmacology). 
Additional expert consultations 
See discussion on clinical efficacy. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
This application for a paediatric indication and new formulation is supported by data by paediatric studies as 
and to some extent from extrapolation of adult data. Overall, the observed safety data from the paediatric 
studies indicate a safety profile that is in line with the safety profile in the approved adult VTE indication and 
reflect the underlying conditions of the studied population. The limited information in the youngest children 
will be supplemented by a planned post-authorisation safety study. Although an imbalance with regards to 
treatment-emergent bleedings for rivaroxaban as compared to standard of care was observed in the pivotal 
study 14372, this risk is considered to be adequately managed by the proposed routine and additional risk 
minimisation measures.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet for Xarelto 1 mg/mL 
granules for oral suspension  submitted by the MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 76/86 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products 
for human use. 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed for Xarelto 15 
and 20 mg film-coated tablets on the basis of a bridging report making reference to Xarelto 1 mg/mL 
granules for oral suspension. The bridging report submitted by the MAH has been found acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it has a PASS imposed either at the time of authorisation or afterwards. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
As described in the Paediatric Addendum on the guidelines on clinical investigation of medicinal products for 
the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolic disease, venous thrombosis in children is rare, with 
an incidence at about 100 times lower than in adults. An annual incidence of VTE of between 53-57 per 100 
000 has been reported among hospitalized children and between 1.4-4.9 per 100 000 in the community 
overall. The distribution of events is bimodal with the majority occurring in neonates/infants and in 
adolescents. Idiopathic paediatric venous thromboses are very uncommon; more than 90 per cent of children 
who experience a VTE have been described to have a serious underlying disease including malignancy, 
congenital heart disease and nephrotic syndrome; a hereditary pro-thrombotic condition; or a precipitating 
factor such as surgery, infection, trauma or an indwelling catheter such as central venous catheter (CVC). In 
adolescents, hormonal contraception is a common triggering factor for VTE. 
Location of VTE differs, with neonates and young children more often experiencing upper venous system VTE 
(most frequently CVC-related VTE) as compared to adolescents and adults. 
The coagulation system differs in particular in neonates and infants aged < 6 months, as compared to older 
children and adults. At birth, the plasma levels of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, X) are 
only half of the adult values, and increase during the first 6-12 months of life but remain at about 15% lower 
levels as compared to adults. Both quantitative and qualitative differences of the coagulation system have 
been described in the youngest children, and their response to anticoagulant therapy is known to be different 
compared to older children and adults. 
The aim of anticoagulant VTE therapy is generally to prevent disease progression (including prevention of 
occurrence of severe manifestations such as pulmonary embolism), prevent VTE recurrence and the 
development of sequelae such as post thrombotic syndrome. 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 77/86 
  
  
 
3.1.1.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The ACCP management guidelines (Monagle et al 2012) generally recommends for the initial treatment of 
VTE in children adjusted-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH), bodyweight-adjusted low-molecular-weight 
heparin (LMWH) or fondaparinux.  For subsequent treatment, either INR-titrated vitamin K antagonist (VKA) 
or bodyweight-adjusted LMWH is recommended. Suggested treatment durations are 3 months for children 
with provoked VTE in whom the risk factor has resolved and extended anticoagulant therapy (for secondary 
prevention of recurrent VTE) in children who have ongoing risk factors.  For children with idiopathic VTE, the 
suggested treatment duration has a minimum of 3 months and a maximum of 6 to 12 months. Children with 
recurrent unprovoked VTE are usually treated indefinitely. 
In the ACCP guidelines, it is further stated that it is suggested that central venous access devices or umbilical 
venous catheters associated with confirmed thrombosis is to be removed after 3 to 5 days of therapeutic 
anticoagulation rather than left in situ. Either initial anticoagulation or supportive care with radiologic 
monitoring for extension of thrombosis is suggested as well as start of anticoagulation if extension occurs in 
previously untreated patients. Anticoagulation should be with either LMWH or UFH followed by LMWH with a 
total duration of anticoagulation of between 6 weeks and 3 months. As discussed in these guidelines, clear 
evidence that all thromboses in neonates or children require treatment, particularly for asymptomatic 
thrombosis, is lacking and further studies are required so that adequate risk-benefit assessments of 
treatment options can be determined. 
According to the ACCP guidelines, for children with CSVT without significant intracranial haemorrhage, 
anticoagulation is suggested, initially with UFH or LMWH and subsequently with LMWH, for a total therapy 
duration between 6 weeks and 3 months.  For children with CSVT with significant haemorrhage, either 
anticoagulation or supportive care with radiologic monitoring of the thrombosis at 5 to 7 days and 
anticoagulation if thrombus extension is noted is recommended. However, according to the AHA guidelines 
(Roach et al 2008), there is currently a consensus that older children without haemorrhage should be 
anticoagulated (International Paediatric Stroke Study consensus) but few neonates with CVST have been 
treated with anticoagulants, and such treatment is not recommended in neonates except perhaps in selected 
patients with clinical deterioration or with radiological evidence of clot propagation 
There is no centrally approved anticoagulant product in the EU for treatment or secondary prevention of VTE 
in children. There is an unmet need for a new treatment-option with well documented efficacy and safety in 
children. In the paediatric setting, an alternative that requires less monitoring than existing standard of care 
would also be a benefit. 
3.1.2.  Main clinical studies 
The focus of the application is the phase III trial, study 14372, in which patients aged birth to < 18 years 
with acute VTE, received initial treatment with therapeutic doses of UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux for at least 
5 days, and were randomised 2:1 to then receive either rivaroxaban (age- and bodyweight-adjusted) or 
comparator group (heparins, VKA) for a main study treatment period of 3 months (1 month for children < 2 
years with CVC-VTE). Rivaroxaban was administered as either tablets or as granules for oral suspension (in a 
body weight-adjusted 20 mg equivalent dose). At the end of the main study treatment period, the diagnostic 
imaging test, which was obtained at baseline, was repeated, if feasible. The study treatment could be 
stopped at this point, or at the discretion of the Investigator continued for up to 12 months (for children < 2 
years with CVC VTE up to 3 months) in total. The treatment period was followed by an observational period 
of 30 days.  
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 78/86 
  
  
In total 500 patients were randomized (335 to rivaroxaban, 165 to comparator) and 491 (329 rivaroxaban 
and 162 comparator) started treatment. Requirement for 90 days anticoagulation (30 days in children aged 
younger than 2 years with CVC-VTE) were included in the inclusion criteria. 
The most common index events in the phase III study were lower extremity VTE (rivaroxaban 33.4% and 
comparator 32%), CVST (rivaroxaban 22.1% and comparator 26.1%), and pulmonary embolism 
(rivaroxaban 14.6% and comparator 18.8%). CVC-VTE was found in 25.4% children (26.9% in rivaroxaban 
group and 22.4% in comparator group), primarily among the youngest children. A large proportion of 
subjects with CVC-VTE (44%) had subacute or chronic VTE. 
There were 15 rivaroxaban-treated children in the age group <0.5 years included in the phase III study in 
the Safety Analysis set (SAF; all randomized children who received at least one dose of study medication 
included, there were 16 in the FAS that included all randomized subjects).  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary efficacy outcome of recurrent VTE occurred in 1.2% (4/335 subjects) randomised to 
rivaroxaban; 95% CI 0.4-3.0%, and in 3% (5/165 subjects) randomised to comparator; 95% CI 1.2-6.6% 
during the main treatment period of 3 months (1 month for CVC-VTE in children < 2 years of age). All 
recurrent VTEs in the rivaroxaban group occurring during the main treatment period occurred in children 
aged between 12 and 18 years, which was also the largest age group in the study (4/184; 2.2%;95% CI 0.7 
- 5.3%). In the comparator group, recurrent VTE occurred in 3 of the 92 children aged between 12 and 18 
years (3.3%; 95% CI 0.9 - 8.6%), in 1 of the 34 children aged between 6 and 12 years (2.9%; 95 CI 0.2% - 
15.1%) and in 1 of the 22 children aged between 2 and 6 years (4.5%; 95% CI 0.2 - 20.7%). In both 
treatment groups, early recurrence predominated; there were no primary efficacy events after day 30. 
During the extended treatment period, only three primary efficacy events occurred in total (1 in the 
rivaroxaban group at day 223 and 2 in the comparator group, at day 98 and 211); all events occurred in 
adolescents. All subjects had a non-CVC-VTE index event. Only subjects with CVST, non-CVC-VTE or CVC-
VTE >/= 2 years were treated for more than three months: 135 subjects were included in the first extension 
period (3-6 months) in the rivaroxaban group (63 subjects in comparator group), 53 subjects were included 
in the second extension period (6-9 months) in the rivaroxaban group (24 subjects in the comparator group), 
and 31 subjects were included in the third extension period (9-12 months) in the rivaroxaban group (17 
subjects in the comparator group). 
The incidences of recurrent VTE are largely in line with the pivotal VTE studies (deep vein thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolism only) in adults.  
There were no primary efficacy events after stop of study treatment in subjects randomized to rivaroxaban, 
thus, no rebound effect of rivaroxaban is apparent. There were two primary efficacy events in the comparator 
group after stop of study treatment, both occurring in children with persistent risk factors for VTE. 
The secondary efficacy outcome was a composite of the primary efficacy outcome (recurrent VTE) and 
asymptomatic deterioration on repeat imaging, and occurred in 5/335 (1.5%, 95% CI 0.3-3.4%) of 
rivaroxaban treated subjects and 6/165 (3.6%, 95% CI 1.6-7.6%). The majority of secondary efficacy events 
were recurrent VTE (primary efficacy outcome); only 1 subject in each treatment group had asymptomatic 
deterioration during the main treatment period.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The study was not powered to test a formal hypothesis; thus, no type I error/multiplicity considerations have 
been made, which needs to be considered in the interpretation of outcomes. Although there were no formal 
claims with regards to comparator treatment, it is noted that there was no robust assessment of compliance 
for 72/162 children in the comparator group. Therefore, the data included in the SmPC pertaining to study 
14372 are to be descriptive only. 
The concept of developmental haemostasis precludes full extrapolation of efficacy data in adults to the 
youngest children. Even though the number of children below the age of 2 included in the pivotal study was 
limited, the data on favourable effects in all age groups are deemed conclusive enough to support adequate 
efficacy for treatment and secondary prevention of VTE in children of any age as also confirmed by the 
experts in the SAG meeting. Therefore, the Applicant´s proposal to include children of all age groups in the 
indication is accepted. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
During the main treatment period, any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) occurred in 83.3% of 
subjects in the rivaroxaban group and 75.3% in the comparator group while the frequency of serious TEAE 
occurred in 21.6% vs 19.8% and TEAE leading to discontinuation of study drug in 3.3% vs 1.9%.  
The principal safety outcome (a composite of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding; 
CRNM) occurred in 10/329 children in the rivaroxaban group ( 3%; all CRNM bleeding) and 3/162 children 
compared in the comparator group ( 1.9%; 2 major bleeding, 1 CRNM bleeding) during the main treatment 
period. Overall, considering both the main and extended treatment periods the incidence of the principal 
safety outcome in the SAF was in total 13/329 (4.0%) vs 4/162 (2.5%). In addition, two incidences of 
principal safety outcome were reported in the rivaroxaban group during follow-up period. 
The proportion of children with any confirmed treatment-emergent bleeding during the main treatment period 
was 36.2% in the rivaroxaban group and 27.8% in the comparator group. In the rivaroxaban group, these 
bleedings included mucosal bleedings such as gastrointestinal bleedings, epistaxis, bleedings from mouth and 
genitourinary bleedings (including increased menstrual bleedings). There were no intracranial bleedings in 
the rivaroxaban group (but one subdural haemorrhage in the comparator group). Incidence of all confirmed 
treatment-emergent bleedings, for the overall duration of treatment (SAF) was 39.5% in the rivaroxaban 
group and 30.2 % had such event in the comparator group. 
In the youngest age strata, i.e. birth to <0.5 years, 5/15 children (33.3%) in the rivaroxaban group had  
confirmed treatment-emergent bleeding (out of which 1 was a CRNM) during the main treatment period as 
compared to 0/8 (0%) of the comparator group.  
Taking into account the entire treatment period, there was 1 additional subject with a bleeding in the 
rivaroxaban group (thus 40% of the rivaroxaban-treated subjects had a bleeding during the overall treatment 
period) and 0 in the comparator group. In addition, there were 2 post-treatment bleedings in the rivaroxaban 
group compared to none in the comparator group. For children < 2 years of age, 15/36 (41.7%) children in 
the rivaroxaban group had a treatment-emergent bleed during the entire study period, 3 of which were CRNM 
bleeding. Thirteen of these occurred during the main treatment period (2 of which were CRNM bleeding). For 
the comparator in the same age group, there were 3/17 (17.6%) subjects with a treatment-emergent 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 80/86 
  
  
 
bleeding during the entire study period, 1 of which was a major bleeding. All bleeding episodes occurred 
during the main treatment period. Repeat bleeding events for children < 2 years of age was noted only in the 
rivaroxaban group; there were in total 20 treatment-emergent bleeding events during the main treatment 
period, 6 of which were CRNM. No child in the comparator group had a repeat bleed. 
In children with CVST as index event, the incidence of the principal safety outcome (major bleedings + 
CRNMs) was in the rivaroxaban group 5/74 (6.8%) and in the comparator group 1/43 (2.3%) during the 
main treatment period. The incidence of any confirmed bleeding was 35.1% rivaroxaban vs 30.2% 
comparator.  
In children with CVC-VTE, the incidence of the principal safety outcome was 3/87= 3.4% in the rivaroxaban 
group vs 0/37 in the comparator group during the main treatment period. The incidence of treatment-
emergent bleedings was 31.0% in rivaroxaban-group vs 21.6% in comparator. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The concept of developmental haemostasis precludes full extrapolation of safety data in adults to the 
youngest children. Nevertheless, the data on unfavourable effects in all age groups are deemed conclusive 
enough to support adequate safety for treatment and secondary prevention of VTE in children of any age. 
The number of children in each age group in study 14372, and the bleeding data including all bleeding events 
are reflected in the product information.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Importance of favourable effects  
Overall, the efficacy demonstrated for the paediatric rivaroxaban group is deemed well in line with what is 
expected for an anticoagulant for treatment and secondary prevention of VTE, supported by a low number of 
recurrent VTEs during main treatment period as well as during extended treatment periods. Efficacy is further 
supported by the repeat imaging with improved or normalised thrombotic burden in a majority of subjects. 
The magnitude of the effect as presented is deemed well in line with what is known in adults and in previous 
paediatric VTE studies. 
Importance of unfavourable effects 
For the overall paediatric population, treatment with rivaroxaban appears to carry an increased risk for 
bleedings compared to standard of care. This a known risk from the use of rivaroxaban in the adult 
population and is associated with its anticoagulant properties. Even though no major bleedings were reported 
with rivaroxaban, detailed information on this risk and necessary precautions on how to minimise is included 
in the product information.  Additional risk minimisation measures already in place for adult patients are also 
expected to contribute to effective management of this risk in the paediatric population. 
Furthermore, as advised by the SAG post-authorisation safety data on the use of rivaroxaban in the youngest 
children will be collected through a planned PASS. This study will focus on children < 2 years of age and 
addressing the risk of bleeding as well as the risk of medication errors with the new paediatric formulation.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
There is an unmet need for a new treatment-option with well documented efficacy and safety in children with 
VTE. Overall, the efficacy data in this application are considered to support a clinically adequate efficacy of 
rivaroxaban for treatment and secondary prevention of VTE in children and it is possible that this new 
Assessment report  
EMA/647126/2020 
Page 82/86 
  
  
 
 
 
treatment option will decrease the need for parenteral therapy and monitoring. Taken together, this is 
considered to outweigh the observed risks of bleeding in this patient group. 
With respect to safety, it is acknowledged that the incidence of treatment related bleedings (albeit not major 
bleedings) are higher in the groups treated with rivaroxaban compared to standard of care. However, as also 
confirmed by the experts at the SAG meeting, this risk can be handled in clinical practice.  
Therefore, the benefits associated with rivaroxaban uses are considered to outweigh the observed risks of 
bleeding in children of all ages. The granules for oral suspension can be used in in term neonates, infants and 
toddlers, children, and adolescents aged less than 18 years after at least 5 days of initial parenteral 
anticoagulation treatment. In children and adolescents aged less than 18 years and weighing from 30 kg to 
50 kg the 15 mg film-coated tablets can also be used and in children and adolescents aged less than 18 years 
and weighing more than 50 kg the 20mg film-coated tablets can be used. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Xarelto in the sought indications is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of, Xarelto 1 mg/mL granules for oral suspension is favourable in the following 
indication: 
Treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and prevention of VTE recurrence in term neonates, infants 
and toddlers, children, and adolescents aged less than 18 years after at least 5 days of initial parenteral 
anticoagulation treatment.

a  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: 
aspartate aminotransferase; ULN: upper limit of normal; BLV: baseline value.
b Upon improvement to ≤ Grade 1, corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 month. 
Consider increasing dose of corticosteroids and/or using additional systemic immunosuppressants if there is 
worsening or no improvement.
c After withholding, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and/or durvalumab can be resumed within 12 weeks if the 
adverse reactions improved to ≤ Grade 1 and the corticosteroid dose has been reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone 
or equivalent per day. Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and durvalumab should be permanently discontinued for 
recurrent Grade 3 adverse reactions, as applicable.
d For patients with alternative cause follow the recommendations for AST or ALT increases without concurrent 
bilirubin elevations.
e If no improvement within 2 to 3 days despite corticosteroids, promptly start additional immunosuppressive 
therapy. Upon resolution (< Grade 1), corticosteroid taper should be initiated and continued over at least 1 
month.
f Permanently discontinue Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and durvalumab if the adverse reaction does not resolve 
to ≤ Grade 1 within 30 days or if there are signs of respiratory insufficiency.
g Includes immune thrombocytopenia and pancreatitis.
h With the exception of Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities, about which the decision to discontinue should be 
based on accompanying clinical signs/symptoms and clinical judgment.
For suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to 
confirm aetiology or exclude alternate aetiologies. 
Special populations
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in children and adolescents aged below 18 
years of age have not been established. No data are available.
Elderly
No dose adjustment is required for elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) (see section 5.2). Data on 
patients aged 75 years of age or older are limited.
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is recommended in patients with mild or moderate 
renal impairment. There are insufficient data in patients with severe renal impairment for dosing 
recommendations (see section 5.2).
6
Hepatic impairment
Data from patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment are limited. Due to minor 
involvement of hepatic processes in the clearance of tremelimumab, no dose adjustment of 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment as no difference in 
exposure is expected (see section 5.2).
Method of administration
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is for intravenous use, it is administered as an intravenous infusion after 
dilution, over 1 hour. 
When Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given first, followed by durvalumab and then platinum-
based chemotherapy on the day of dosing.
When Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given as a fifth dose in combination with durvalumab and 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy at week 16, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is given first, followed by 
durvalumab and then pemetrexed maintenance therapy on the day of dosing.
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca, durvalumab, and platinum-based chemotherapy are administered as 
separate intravenous infusions. Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and durvalumab are each given over 1 
hour. For platinum-based chemotherapy, refer to the SmPC for administration information. For 
pemetrexed maintenance therapy, refer to the SmPCfor administration information. Separate infusion 
bags and filters for each infusion should be used.
During cycle 1, Tremelimumab AstraZeneca is to be followed by durvalumab starting approximately 1 
hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the Tremelimumab AstraZeneca infusion. Platinum-based 
chemotherapy infusion should start approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the 
durvalumab infusion. If there are no clinically significant concerns during cycle 1, then at the 
physician’s discretion, subsequent cycles of durvalumab can be given immediately after 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and the time period between the end of the durvalumab infusion and the 
start of chemotherapy can be reduced to 30 minutes.
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4

corticosteroids and with no clear alternate aetiology, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in 
combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Events of Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors. 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of rash or dermatitis and managed as 
recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated myocarditis 
Immune-mediated myocarditis, which can be fatal, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in 
combination with durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of immune-mediated myocarditis and managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Immune-mediated pancreatitis
Immune-mediated pancreatitis, occurred in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms 
of immune-mediated pancreatitis and managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Other immune-mediated adverse reactions
Given the mechanism of action of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab, other potential 
immune-mediated adverse reactions may occur. The following immune-related adverse reactions have 
been observed in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab: myasthenia 
gravis, myositis, polymyositis, meningitis, encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune 
thrombocytopenia and cystitis noninfective. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms and 
managed as recommended in section 4.2.
Infusion-related reactions
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions. Severe infusion-
related reactions have been reported in patients receiving tremelimumab in combination with 
durvalumab and chemotherapy (see section 4.8). Infusion-related reactions should be managed as 
recommended in section 4.2.
Disease-specific precaution
Metastatic NSCLC
Limited data are available in elderly patients (≥ 75 years) treated with tremelimumab in combination 
with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). Careful consideration 
of the potential benefit/risk of this regimen on an individual basis is recommended.
Patients excluded from clinical studies
Patients with the following were excluded from clinical studies: active or prior documented 
autoimmune disease; active and/or untreated brain metastases; a history of immunodeficiency;
administration of systemic immunosuppression within 14 days before the start of tremelimumab or 
durvalumab, except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (< 10 mg/day prednisone or 
equivalent); uncontrolled intercurrent illness; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV infection 
or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of tremelimumab
9
or durvalumab. In the absence of data, tremelimumab should be used with caution in these populations 
after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis.
Sodium content
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
The use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting tremelimumab, except 
physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent), is not 
recommended because of their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy 
of tremelimumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used after
starting tremelimumab to treat immune-related adverse reactions (see section 4.4).
No formal pharmacokinetic (PK) drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with 
tremelimumab. Since the primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein catabolism via 
reticuloendothelial system or target-mediated disposition, no metabolic drug-drug interactions are 
expected. PK drug-drug interactions between tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy were assessed in the POSEIDON study and showed no clinically 
meaningful PK interactions between tremelimumab, durvalumab, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, 
pemetrexed, carboplatin or cisplatin in the concomitant treatment.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment with
tremelimumab and for at least 3 months after the last dose of tremelimumab.
Pregnancy
There are no data on the use of tremelimumab in pregnant women. Based on its mechanism of action, 
tremelimumab has the potential to impact maintenance of pregnancy and may cause foetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of tremelimumab to 
pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis was not associated with maternal 
toxicity or any effects on maintenance of pregnancy or embryofoetal development (see section 5.3). 
Human IgG2 is known to cross the placental barrier. Tremelimumab is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception during treatment 
and for at least 3 months after the last dose.
Breast-feeding
There is no information regarding the presence of tremelimumab in human milk, the absorption and 
effects on the breast-fed infant, or the effects on milk production. Human IgG2 is excreted in human 
milk. Because of the potential for adverse reactions from tremelimumab in breast-fed infants, breast-
feeding women are advised not to breast-feed during treatment and for at least 3 months after the last 
dose.
Fertility
There are no data on the potential effects of tremelimumab on fertility in humans or animals. However, 
mononuclear cell infiltration in prostate and uterus was observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies (see 
Section 5.3). The clinical relevance of these findings for fertility is unknown.
10
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Tremelimumab has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8 Undesirable effects

adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were pneumonia (1.2%) and colitis (0.9%).
Tremelimumab was interrupted due to adverse reactions in 40.6% of patients. The most common 
adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were neutropenia (13.6%), thrombocytopenia (5.8%),
leukopenia (4.5%), diarrhoea (3.0%), pneumonia (2.7%), aspartate aminotransferase increased/alanine 
aminotransferase increased (2.4%), fatigue (2.4%), lipase increased (2.4%), colitis (2.1%), hepatitis 
(2.1%) and rash (2.1%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Table 3, unless otherwise stated, lists the incidence of adverse reactions in patients treated with 
tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy in the POSEIDON 
study, in which 330 patients received tremelimumab. Patients were exposed to tremelimumab during a 
median of 20 weeks.
Adverse reactions are listed according to system organ class in MedDRA. Within each system organ 
class, the adverse reactions are presented in decreasing frequency. The corresponding frequency 
category for each ADR is defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon 
(≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); very rare (< 1/10 000); not known (cannot be 
estimated from available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in 
order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Tremelimumabis associated with immune-mediated adverse reactions. Most of these, including severe 
reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of tremelimumab.
The data for the following immune-mediated adverse reactions are based on 2 280 patients who 
received tremelimumab 75 mg every 4 weeks or 1 mg/kg every 4 weeks in combination with 
durvalumab 1 500 mg every 4 weeks, 20 mg/kg every 4 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Details for 
the significant adverse reactions for tremelimumab when given in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy are presented if clinically relevant differences were noted in comparison 
to tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab. The management guidelines for these adverse 
reactions are described in section 4.4.

reactions occurred in 45 (2.0%) patients, including Grade 3 in 2 (< 0.1%) patients. There were no 
Grade 4 or 5 events.
Laboratory abnormalities
In patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based 
chemotherapy, the proportion of patients who experienced a shift from baseline to a Grade 3 or 4 
laboratory abnormality was as follows: 6.2% for alanine aminotransferase increased, 5.2% for 
aspartate aminotransferase increased, 4.0% for blood creatinine increased, 9.4% for amylase increased 
and 13.6% for lipase increased. The proportion of patients who experienced a TSH shift from baseline 
that was ≤ ULN to > ULN was 24.8% and a TSH shift from baseline that was ≥ LLN to < LLN was 
32.9%.
Immunogenicity 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity. Immunogenicity of 
tremelimumab is based on pooled data in 1337 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg or 
1 mg/kg and evaluable for the presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). One-hundred forty-three 
patients (10.7%) tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. Neutralizing antibodies against 
tremelimumab were detected in 8.9% (119/1337) of patients. The presence of ADAs did not impact 
tremelimumab pharmacokinetics and there was no apparent effect on safety.
In the POSEIDON study, of the 278 patients who were treated with tremelimumab 75 mg in 
combination with durvalumab 1 500 mg every 3 weeks and platinum-based chemotherapy and 
evaluable for the presence of ADAs, 38 (13.7%) patients tested positive for treatment-emergent ADAs. 
Neutralizing antibodies against tremelimumab were detected in 11.2% (31/278) of patients. The 
presence of ADAs did not have an apparent effect on pharmacokinetics or safety.
Elderly
In the POSEIDON study in patients treated with tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy, some differences in safety were reported between elderly (≥ 65 years) 
and younger patients. The safety data from patients 75 years of age or older are limited to a total of 74
patients. There was a higher frequency of serious adverse reactions and discontinuation of any study 
treatment due to adverse reactions in 35 patients aged 75 years of age or older treated with 
tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (45.7% and 28.6%, 
respectively) relative to 39 patients aged 75 years of age or older who received platinum-based
chemotherapy only (35.9% and 20.5%, respectively).
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
16
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
There is no information on overdose with tremelimumab. In case of overdose, patients should be 
closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment 
instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates. ATC code: 
L01FX20
Mechanism of action
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4) is primarily expressed on the surface of 
T lymphocytes. Interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80 and CD86, limits effector T-cell 
activation, through a number of potential mechanisms, but primarily by limiting co-stimulatory 
signalling through CD28. 
Tremelimumab is a selective, fully human IgG2 antibody that blocks CTLA-4 interaction with CD80 
and CD86, thus enhancing T-cell activation and proliferation, resulting in increased T-cell diversity 
and enhanced anti-tumour activity.
The combination of tremelimumab, a CTLA-4 inhibitor and durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor results in 
improved anti-tumour responses in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. In murine syngeneic tumour 
models, dual blockade of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 resulted in enhanced anti-tumour activity.
Clinical efficacy and safety
NSCLC – POSEIDON study
POSEIDON was a study designed to evaluate the efficacy of durvalumab with or without 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. POSEIDON was a 
randomised, open-label, multicentre study in 1013 metastatic NSCLC patients with no sensitising 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic 
tumour aberrations. Patients with histologically or cytologically documented metastatic NSCLC were 
eligible for enrolment. Patients had no prior chemotherapy or any other systemic therapy for metastatic
NSCLC. Prior to randomisation, patients had tumour PD-L1 status confirmed by using the Ventana 
PD-L1 (SP263) assay. Patients had a World Health Organization (WHO)/Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at enrolment.
The study excluded patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease; active and/or 
untreated brain metastases; a history of immunodeficiency; administration of systemic 
immunosuppression within 14 days before the start of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca or durvalumab, 
except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids; active tuberculosis or hepatitis B or C or HIV 
infection; or patients receiving live attenuated vaccine within 30 days before or after the start of 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca and/or durvalumab (see section 4.4).
Randomisation was stratified by tumour cells (TC) PD-L1 expression (TC ≥ 50% vs. TC < 50%), 
disease stage (Stage IVA vs. Stage IVB, per the 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer), 
and histology (non-squamous vs. squamous).
17
Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive:
 Arm 1: Tremelimumab AstraZeneca 75 mg with durvalumab 1 500 mg and platinum-based
chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1 500 mg every 4 weeks as 
monotherapy. A fifth dose of Tremelimumab AstraZeneca 75 mg was given at Week 16 alongside 
durvalumab dose 6.
 Arm 2: Durvalumab 1 500 mg and platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, 
followed by durvalumab 1 500 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy.
 Arm 3: Platinum-based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Patients could receive 2
additional cycles (a total of 6 cycles post-randomisation), as clinically indicated, at Investigator’s 
discretion.
Patients received one of the following platinum-based chemotherapy regimens:
 Non-squamous NSCLC

Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 with carboplatin AUC 5-6 or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 every 3 
weeks. Unless contraindicated by the investigator, pemetrexed maintenance could be 
given.

Squamous NSCLC
 Gemcitabine 1 000 or 1 250 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 with cisplatin 75 mg/m2 or 
carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks.
 Non-squamous or squamous NSCLC
 Nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 with carboplatin AUC 5-6 on Day 1 
every 3 weeks.
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca was given up to a maximum of 5 doses unless there was disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. Durvalumab and histology-based pemetrexed maintenance 
therapy (when applicable) was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Tumour assessments were conducted at Week 6 and Week 12 from the date of randomisation, and then 
every 8 weeks until confirmed objective disease progression. Survival assessments were conducted 
every 2 months following treatment discontinuation.
The dual primary endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
(OS) for durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 2) vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone
(Arm 3). The key secondary endpoints of the study were PFS and OS for Tremelimumab AstraZeneca
+ durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 1) and platinum-based chemotherapy alone (Arm 
3). The secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR).
PFS, ORR, and DoR were assessed using Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) according to 
RECIST v1.1.
The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well-balanced between study arms. 
Baseline demographics of the overall study population were as follows: male (76.0%), age ≥ 65 years
(47.1%), age ≥ 75 years (11.3%) median age 64 years (range: 27 to 87 years), White (55.9%), Asian
(34.6%), Black or African American (2.0%) other (7.6%), non-Hispanic or Latino (84.2%), current 
smoker or past-smoker (78.0%), WHO/ECOG PS 0 (33.4%), WHO/ECOG PS 1 (66.5%). Disease 
characteristics were as follows: Stage IVA (50.0%), Stage IVB (49.6%), histological sub-groups of 
squamous (36.9%), non-squamous (62.9%), brain metastases (10.5%) PD-L1 expression 
TC ≥ 50% (28.8%), PD-L1 expression TC < 50% (71.1%).
The study showed a statistically significant improvement in OS with Tremelimumab AstraZeneca +
durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 1) vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone (Arm 
3). Tremelimumab AstraZeneca + durvalumab + platinum-based chemotherapy showed a statistically 
significant improvement in PFS vs. platinum-based chemotherapy alone. The results are summarised 
below.

Elderly population
Hazard Ratio (95% CI)
A total of 75 patients aged ≥ 75 years were enrolled in the Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination 
with durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy (n=35) and platinum-based chemotherapy only 
(n=40) arms of the POSEIDON study. An exploratory HR of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.71) for OS was 
observed for Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in combination with durvalumab and platinum-based
chemotherapy vs. platinum-based chemotherapy within this study subgroup. Due to the exploratory 
nature of this subgroup analysis no definitive conclusions can be drawn, but caution is suggested when 
considering this regimen for elderly patients.
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Tremelimumab AstraZeneca in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of 
malignant neoplasms (except central nervous system tumours, haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue 
neoplasms). See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of tremelimumab was assessed as monotherapy and in combination with 
durvalumab and platinum-based chemotherapy.
The pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab was studied in patients with doses ranging from 75 mg to 
750 mg (or 10 mg/kg) administered intravenously once every 4 or 12 weeks as monotherapy. PK 
exposure increased dose-proportionally (linear PK) at doses ≥ 75 mg. Steady-state was achieved at 
approximately 12 weeks. Based on population PK analysis that included 1605 patients who received 
tremelimumab monotherapy or in combination with durvalumab with or without chemotherapy in the 
dose range of  ≥ 75 mg (or 1 mg/kg) every 3 or 4 weeks, the geometric mean steady-state volume of 
distribution (Vss) was 6.33 L. Tremelimumab clearance (CL) decreased over time in combination with 
durvalumab and chemotherapy resulting in a geometric mean steady-state clearance (CLss) of 
0.309 L/day; the decrease in CLss was not considered clinically relevant. The geometric mean terminal 
21
half-life was approximately 14.2 days. The primary elimination pathways of tremelimumab are protein 
catabolism via reticuloendothelial system or target mediated disposition.
Special populations
Age, gender, race
Age (22 - 97 years), body weight (34 - 149 kg), gender, positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) status, 
albumin levels, LDH levels, creatinine levels, tumour type, race or ECOG/WHO status had no 
clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab.
Renal impairment
Mild (creatinine clearance (CrCL) 60 to 89 ml/min) and moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance (CrCL) 30 to 59 ml/min) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab.
The effect of severe renal impairment (CrCL 15 to 29 ml/min) on the PK of tremelimumab is 
unknown; the potential need for dose adjustment cannot be determined. However, as IgG monoclonal 
antibodies are not primarily cleared via renal pathways, a change in renal function is not expected to 
influence tremelimumab exposure.
Hepatic impairment
Mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin > 1.0 to 1.5 × ULN and any 
AST) had no clinically significant effect on the PK of tremelimumab. The effect of moderate hepatic 
impairment (bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 x ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin 
> 3.0 x ULN and any AST) on the PK of tremelimumab is unknown; the potential need for dose 
adjustment cannot be determined. However, as IgG monoclonal antibodies are not primarily cleared 
via hepatic pathways, a change in hepatic function is not expected to influence tremelimumab 
exposure.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Animal toxicology 
In the chronic 6-month study in cynomolgus monkeys, treatment with tremelimumab was associated 
with dose-related incidence in persistent diarrhoea and skin rash, scabs and open sores, which were 
dose-limiting. These clinical signs were also associated with decreased appetite and body weight and 
swollen peripheral lymph nodes. Histopathological findings correlating with the observed clinical 
signs included reversible chronic inflammation in the cecum and colon, mononuclear cell infiltration 
in the skin and hyperplasia in lymphoid tissues. 
A dose-dependent increase in the incidence and severity of mononuclear cell infiltration with or 
without mononuclear cell inflammation was observed in the salivary gland, pancreas (acinar), thyroid, 
parathyroid, adrenal, heart, esophagus, tongue, periportal liver area, skeletal muscle, prostate, uterus, 
pituitary, eye (conjunctiva, extra ocular muscles), and choroid plexus of the brain. No NOAEL was 
found in this study with animals treated with the lowest dose of 5 mg/kg/week requiring supportive 
care. This dose provided an exposure-based safety margin of 3 to clinical relevant exposure (taking 
species difference in potency into account). 
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity
The carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of tremelimumab has not been evaluated.
Reproductive toxicology
Mononuclear cell infiltration in prostate and uterus was observed in repeat dose toxicity studies. Since 
animal fertility studies have not been conducted with tremelimumab, the clinical relevance of these 
22
findings for fertility is unknown. In reproduction studies, administration of tremelimumab to pregnant 
Cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis was not associated with maternal toxicity or 
effects pregnancy losses, foetal weights, or external, visceral, skeletal abnormalities or weights of 
selected foetal organs.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Preparation and administration of the infusion
•
•
•
•
Parenteral medicinal products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discolouration prior to administration. The concentrate is a clear to opalescent, colourless to 
slightly yellow solution, free from visible particles. Discard the vial if the solution is cloudy, 
discoloured or visible particles are observed.
Do not shake the vial.
Withdraw the required volume of concentrate from the vial(s) and transfer into an intravenous

1.  Introduction 
Study E2007-G000-402, “Study 402” is an Eisai-sponsored Phase 4 post-approval safety study 
(PASS). The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had requested Eisai to 
conduct a PASS as a source of additional safety data for identified safety risks and missing 
safety information. Therefore, Study 402 was designed as an observational, cohort study to 
evaluate the safety profile of perampanel when prescribed as add-on therapy in subjects with 
epilepsy, to assess these adverse events (AEs) under conditions of common (real-life) use in the 
epilepsy population.  
Study 402 was recently completed (last patient last visit [LPLV] was 01 March 2018). The study 
aimed to evaluate AEs of interest in the categories of important identified risks, important 
potential risks, and important missing information from the risk management plan. The objective 
of the study was to address the need for additional safety information on adverse events (AEs) 
of interest in the categories of important identified risks, important potential risks, and important 
missing information in the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)-approved 
EU Risk Management Plan (RMP) for perampanel given as add-on therapy in patients with 
epilepsy. This was achieved by assessment of events of dizziness, blurred vision, somnolence, 
aggression, balance disorders, ataxia, falls, unintended pregnancy, weight gain, suicidality, drug 
abuse, misuse, dependence, withdrawal, off-label use, skin photosensitivity, unintended 
pregnancy while taking levonorgestrel-containing contraceptives, and outcomes associated with 
any suspected drug-drug interaction.  
In addition it was the intention that the study would show any difference in the adverse event 
profile of the drug in patients not studied at the time of licensing. Specific analysis was requested 
of patients with cardiovascular disease, a history of psychotic disorder or suicidal behaviour, 
previous exposure to vigabatrin, history of substance abuse, elderly patients (aged over 65), 
patients with renal disease, patients with respiratory disease. 
The probability of observing events of interest was calculated based on having 500 subjects in 
the planned final analysis. This number has not been achieved. A total of 483 patients have 
been included in the safety analysis set.  The data collection was started in June 2014 and the 
agreed final study report date has been revised several times in annual study progress reports 
because of slower than expected recruitment. This report assesses the final study report findings 
and includes responses to the RFI submitted in January 2018 to the final interim study report. 
2.  Summary of data submitted  
A total of 493 subjects were treated. Of these, 243 (49.3%) subjects completed the study, an 
additional 23 subjects completed at least 52 weeks of treatment and were recorded as ongoing 
on treatment due to failure to reconsent beyond 52 weeks, and 227 (46.0%) subjects 
discontinued before reaching 52 weeks of treatment. 
The mean age (SD) of subjects was 38.3 (15.10) years. The study population was balanced with 
regard to gender (male, 51.6%) and the majority were white (95.6%). The mean (SD) time since 
diagnosis was 23 (14.8) years, with the majority of subjects having a complex partial seizure 
type (56.5%), followed by secondary generalised tonic-clonic (48.7%). Most subjects were taking 
1 to 3 concomitant antiepileptic (AEDs). 
Of the 483 subjects included in the Safety Analysis Set, 301 (62.3%) reported at least 1 
treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), the majority of which were mild to moderate in 
severity. A total of 153 (31.7%) subjects had a TEAE of special interest: the most common (≥ 1% 
incidence) being dizziness (13.9%), balance disorders (5.6%), aggression (5.4%), weight gain

(5.4%), depression events (3.3%), somnolence (2.7%), suicidality (2.1%), events associated with 
suspected drug-drug interaction (1.7%), and blurred vision (1.4%).  
The frequencies of TEAEs of interest reported was generally lower than the incidence observed  
in clinical studies, with the exception of increases in the incidence of suicidality (2.1% compared 
to 1.0%) and aggression (5.4% compared to 5.1%). Both these events are labelled in the SmPC. 
The majority of events overall had a frequency that was generally similar or lower than the 
incidence observed in clinical studies.  
Events that occurred with an incidence of greater than or equal to 0.5% compared to clinical 
studies include seizure (7.0% compared to 5.7% [convulsion]), sedation (1.7% compared to 
1.0%), epilepsy (1.2% compared to 0.5%), personality disorder (1.2% compared to 0.2%), 
generalized tonic-clonic seizure (1.0% compared to 0.5% [grand mal convulsion]), nightmare 
(0.8% compared to 0%), and petit mal-epilepsy (0.6% compared to 0%). Differences in the  
observed incidence may be due to the way in which events were reported compared to clinical 
studies. 
The frequency of depression was slightly lower than the expected incidence observed in clinical 
studies. There were a total of 16 events related to depression. Most depression events were 
non-serious, and mild to moderate in severity, and considered to be related to treatment by the 
investigator. The exposure adjusted event rate for all terms related to depression events showed 
no increase in the rate of reactions compared to clinical studies. 
All 16 subjects were taking at least 1 concomitant AED medication. Overall, the mean total 
HADS score for anxiety and depression were similar at Baseline compared to EOS and there 
was no change in the exposure adjusted event rate for depression compared to clinical studies 
of the study drug. 
Extent of Exposure 
All subjects included in the Safety Analysis Set had at least 1 dose of study drug and at least 1 
postbaseline safety assessment. The mean (SD) duration of exposure was 38 (22.1) weeks. A 
total of 472 (97.7%) subjects were exposed for more than 1 week, 319 (66.0%) subjects for 
more than 26 weeks, and 169 (35.0%) subjects for at least 52 weeks. The mean (SD) daily dose 
was 4.62 (1.82) mg/day. The mean (SD) maximum dose was 6.0 (2.45) mg. A total of 212 
(43.9%) subjects had a mean daily dose less than 4 mg/day, 252 (52.2%) subjects had a mean  
daily dose between 4 and less than 8 mg/day, and 19 (3.9%) subjects had a mean daily dose 
between 8 and less than 12 mg/day. No subjects had a mean daily dose greater than or equal to 
12 mg/day. 
Adverse Events 
Of the 483 subjects included in the Safety Analysis Set, 301 (62.3%) reported at least 1 TEAE, 
256 (85.0%) of which had TEAEs that were mild to moderate in severity. There were 265 
(54.9%) subjects who had at least 1 TEAE considered to be possibly or probably related to study 
drug by the investigator. A total of 51 (10.6%) subjects had a serious TEAE, of which 2 (0.4%) 
subjects had a fatal outcome, and 49 (10.1%) subjects had other SAEs. A total of 136 (28.2%) 
subjects had a TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation. 
Table 1 presents all reported TEAEs occurring in ≥2% of subjects during the study by Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms (PT). The system organ classes 
(SOCs) with the highest incidence of TEAEs were nervous system disorders (34%), psychiatric 
disorders (24.4%), and general disorders and administration site conditions (13.7%). The 
majority of events in these SOCs were of mild to moderate severity.

The TEAEs with the highest incidence were dizziness (13.9%), fatigue (9.5%), seizure (7.0%), 
irritability (6.2%), and weight increased (5.4%). All of the events of dizziness, fatigue, and 
irritability were considered as treatment related by the investigator, as well as most of the events 
of weight increased (5.0%) and approximately half of the events of seizure (3.7%). 
The frequencies of TEAEs reported was generally lower than or similar to the incidence 
observed in clinical studies. Events that occurred at a higher rate with an incidence of greater 
than or equal to 0.5% compared to clinical studies include seizure (7.0% compared to 5.7% 
[convulsion]), aggression (4.6% compared to 3.7%), sedation (1.7% compared to 1.0%), suicidal 
ideation (1.4% compared to 0.7%), epilepsy (1.2% compared to 0.5%), personality disorder 
(1.2% compared to 0.2%), generalized tonic-clonic seizure (1.0% compared to 0.5% [grand mal 
convulsion]), nightmare (0.8% compared to 0%), and petit mal-epilepsy (0.6% compared to 0%). 
There were 2 deaths observed during the study. The primary cause of death in one was 
malignant brain oedema in a 37 year old male with a history of status epilepticus, and in the 
other was sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in a 16 year old male. Both cases 
were assessed by the treating physicians as not related to treatment. 
Fifty one (10.6%) subjects experienced at least 1 AE that met the criteria for serious. The 
highest incidence of SAEs by SOC was nervous system disorders (5.8%) followed by psychiatric 
disorders (2.5%). SAEs occurring in more than 1 subject were seizure (2.1%), status epilepticus

(0.8%), generalized tonic-clonic seizures (0.6%), suicide attempt (0.6%), ataxia (0.4%), 
psychotic disorder (0.4%), intentional overdose (0.4%), pneumonia (0.4%), and epilepsy (0.4%). 
All serious generalized tonic clonic seizures, suicide attempt, ataxia, psychotic disorder events 
and intentional overdose as well as some events of seizure (0.8%) and some events of status 
epilepticus (0.4%) were considered related to treatment by the investigator. 
TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug or interruption of study drug and/or dose 
adjustment occurred in 136 (28.2%) subjects and 101 (20.9%) subjects in the Safety Analysis 
Set, respectively. The highest incidence of TEAEs resulting in treatment discontinuation or 
interruption of study drug and/or dose adjustment by SOC was nervous system disorders (14.5% 
and 11.4%, respectively), psychiatric disorders (12.4% and 7.7%, respectively), and general 
disorders and administration site conditions (5.0% and 4.3%, respectively). The most common 
(>2% incidence) TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation were dizziness (5.4%), seizure 
(3.5%), aggression (3.3%), fatigue (3.3%), and irritability (2.1%). The most common (≥1% 
incidence) TEAEs resulting in interruption of study drug and/or dose adjustment were dizziness 
(5.6%), irritability (3.1%), fatigue (2.9%), vertigo (1.9%), seizure (1.9%), gait disturbance (1.0%), 
and balance disorder (1.0%). 
Two subjects reported a TEAE of accidental overdose that was not associated with another 
TEAE in either subject, and 2 subjects reported a TEAE of intentional overdose that was 
associated with a TEAE of suicide attempt in both subjects. These events were assessed as 
probably related and possibly related to study drug by the investigator, respectively. There were 
25 (5.2%) subjects who were prescribed study drug, but who did not have partial seizures with or 
without secondary generalization in medical history or at treatment initiation; however, the 
majority of these subjects had primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, for which the study drug 
was approved during the course of the study. Other indications included generalized seizures, 
unclassified epileptic seizures and infantile spasms, Lennox gastaut syndrome, and atypical 
Dravet syndrome. A total of 4 (0.8%) subjects used study drug off label as monotherapy at any 
time during the study. Of these 4 subjects, 3 were prescribed study drug as monotherapy at  
Baseline and continued on monotherapy throughout the course of the study, and 1 received 
study drug as monotherapy for 2 days between discontinuation of 1 AED and initiation of a 
different AED. 
One pregnancy was reported for a woman in the Safety Analysis Set exposed to study drug in 
the study. The subject underwent an induced abortion and there was no interruption or change 
in the dose of study drug. 
Adverse events of special interest 
A total of 153 (31.7%) subjects had a TEAE of special interest, the most common (≥1% 
incidence) being dizziness (13.9%), balance disorders (5.6%), aggression (5.4%), weight gain 
(5.4%), depression events (3.3%), somnolence (2.7%), suicidality (2.1%), outcomes associated 
with suspected drug-drug interaction (1.7%), and blurred vision (1.4%). The frequencies of 
TEAEs of interest reported was generally lower than the incidence observed in clinical studies, 
with the exception of increases in the incidence of suicidality (2.1% compared to 1.0%) and 
aggression (5.4% compared to 5.1%). There were 8 subjects with events considered related to a 
drug-drug interaction. All events occurred in single subjects except for fatigue which occurred in 
2 subjects (0.4%). The interacting medications in all reports were other AEDs. The majority of 
events were moderate in severity and non-serious with 2 serious events reported. 
All events of dizziness and aggression were considered related to treatment by the investigator. 
Most events related to balance disorders (includes terms of balance disorder, ataxia, and fall) 
and weight gain were considered to be related to treatment by the investigator; only 1 (0.2%) 
event of balance disorder, 2 (0.4%) events of fall and 2 (0.4%) events of weight increased were 
considered to be not related. All events of suicidality and most events of somnolence and 
depression were considered to be related to treatment by the investigator; only 1 (0.2%) event

each of somnolence and depression were considered to be not related. While most TEAEs of 
special interest were of mild to moderate severity, 4 (0.8%) events of dizziness, 1 (0.2%) event 
of aggression, 1 (0.2%) event of somnolence, 2 (0.4%) events of balance disorder, 1 (0.2%) 
event of ataxia, 1 (0.2%) event of suicidal ideation, and 3 (0.6%) events of suicide attempt were 
severe. 
TEAEs of interest were reported in at least 1 subject in the subgroup of subjects with 
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, 
or any evidence of risk factors for QT prolongation (14 [42.4%] subjects); subjects exposed to 
vigabatrin (6 [40.0%] subjects); subjects ≥65 years with epilepsy (11 [44%] subjects); subjects 
with a history of drug or alcohol dependency (3 [75%] subjects); subjects who were pregnant or 
lactating (1 [100.0%] subject); subjects with renal disease (3 [42.9%] subjects); and subjects with 
underlying liver disease (2 [40.0%] subjects). While the incidence of some events was higher in 
some subgroups compared to subjects not in the subgroup, the groups are too small to provide 
any meaningful assessment, with most events occurring in 1 or 2 subjects. There were no 
TEAEs of special interest reported by subjects in any other subgroup, including subjects with a 
history of psychotic disorder or suicidal behaviour in the previous 2 years, subjects with a history 
of substance abuse, and subjects with respiratory disease. 
The frequency of depression events reported was slightly lower than the incidence observed in 
clinical studies (3.3% compared to 4.0%).There were a total of 16 events related to depression: 
10 events of depression, 4 events of depressed mood, and 1 event each of decreased interest 
and postictal depression. Most depression events were non-serious, and mild to moderate in 
severity; only 1 (6.3%) event of depression met the criteria of serious and only 2 (12.5%) events 
of depression were severe. Of these 3 events, all resulted in subject withdrawal from the study. 
Of the 16 depression events reported, 8 (50%) events resulted in subject withdrawal from the 
study, 5 (31.3%) events resulted in dose reduction, 2 (12.5%) events required no action, and the 
action taken for 1 (6.3%) event was unknown. 
Most depression events were considered to be related to treatment by the investigator; only 1 
(6.3%) event of depression and 1 (6.3%) of postictal depression were considered to be unrelated 
to treatment by the investigator. 
The exposure adjusted event rate for all terms related to depression events show no increase in 
the rate of reactions compared to clinical studies.

Of the 33 subjects in the subgroup of subjects with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, 
congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, or any evidence of risk factors for QT 
prolongation, 14 (42.4%) subjects reported at least 1 event of special interest TEAEs reported 
were, dizziness 4 (12.1%) subjects, balance disorders 4 (12.1%) subjects, weight gain 3 (9.1%) 
subjects, aggression 2 (6.1%) subjects, blurred vision 1 (3.0%) subject, somnolence 1 (3.0%) 
subject, suicidality 1 (3.0%) subject, and depression events 1 (3.0%) subject. 
Of the 15 subjects in the subgroup of subjects exposed to vigabatrin, 6 (40.0%) subjects 
reported at least 1 event of special interest (Table 14.3.2.6.1.3). TEAEs reported were dizziness 
2 (13.3%) subjects, aggression 2 (13.3%) subjects, weight gain 2 (13.3%) subjects and 
somnolence 1 (6.7%) subject. 
Of the 25 subjects in the subgroup of subjects ≥65 years with epilepsy, 11 (44%) subjects 
reported at least 1 event of special interest (Table 14.3.2.6.1.5). TEAEs reported were dizziness 
6 (24.0%) subjects, balance disorders 3 (12.0%) subjects, somnolence 2 (8.0%) subjects, weight 
gain 1 (4.0%) subject, suicidality 1 (4.0%) subject, and depression events 1 (4.0%) subject. 
Of the 4 subjects in the subgroup of subjects with a history of drug or alcohol dependency, 3 
(75%) subjects reported at least 1 event of special interest (Table 14.3.2.6.1.6). TEAEs reported 
were weight gain 2 (50.0) subjects, aggression 1 (25.0%) subject, suicidality 1 (25.0) subject, 
and depression events 1 (25.0) subject. 
There was 1 subject in the subgroup of subjects who were pregnant or lactating and this subject 
reported the following TEAEs of special interest; unintended pregnancy while taking 
levonorgestrel-containing contraceptives, suicidality, and depression events. Due to the inclusion 
of a single subject in this subgroup, no clinical conclusions can be made. 
Of the 7 subjects in the subgroup of subjects with renal disease, 3 (42.9%) subjects reported at 
least 1 event of special interest. TEAEs reported were, dizziness (28.6%) subjects, and weight 
gain 1 (14.3%) subject.

Of the 5 subjects in the subgroup of subjects with underlying liver disease, 1 subject reported 
dizziness and 1 reported weight gain. 
Subset numbers are very small. There are no reactions in any subsets of patients of interest 
identified at the RMP that are significantly different to those for the general study population but 
the small numbers makes interpretation of this observation very limited. 
Efficacy Results 
Of the 483 subjects in the Safety Analysis Set who had a CGI-C assessment, 44.6% noted 
improvement (4.8% of subjects had very much improved disease severity, 21.2% of subjects 
had much improved disease severity, 18.6% of subjects had minimally improved disease 
severity), 34% of the subjects had no change in disease severity, and 21.5% noted worsening 
(11.3% of subjects had minimally worse disease severity, 9.2% of subjects had much worse 
disease severity, and 1.0% of subjects had very much worse disease severity) compared to 
baseline. 
3.  Scientific discussion  
In the 483 patients in the safety analysis set, the frequencies of TEAEs did not differ significantly 
from that reported in clinical trials with some notable exceptions of labelled reactions- aggression 
and suicidal ideation and unlabelled events of seizure and related terms that could be due to 
lack of efficacy and the baseline risk in the patient population with epilepsy. The two deaths are 
not considered to be related to perampanel but related to the underlying disease. 
The frequency of TEAEs of special interest were generally lower than the incidence observed in 
clinical studies, with the exception of increases in the incidence of suicidality (2.1% compared to 
1.0%) and aggression (5.4% compared to 5.1%).  
The frequency of depression events reported was slightly lower than the incidence observed in 
clinical studies (3.3% compared to 4.0%). Suicidality is labelled in the SmPC for perampanel and 
there is advice in section 4.4 to monitor mood although this is in the context of a warning on 
aggression. There were a total of 16 events related to depression: 10 events of depression, 4 
events of depressed mood, and 1 event each of decreased interest and postictal depression. 
Most depression events were non-serious, and mild to moderate in severity; only 1 (6.3%) event 
of depression met the criteria of serious and only 2 (12.5%) events of depression were severe. 
Of these 3 events, all resulted in subject withdrawal from the study.  
Of the 16 depression events reported, 8 (50%) events resulted in subject withdrawal from the 
study, 5 (31.3%) events resulted in dose reduction, 2 (12.5%) events required no action, and the 
action taken for 1 (6.3%) event was unknown.  
Most depression events were considered to be related to treatment by the investigator; only 1 
(6.3%) event of depression and 1 (6.3%) of postictal depression were considered to be unrelated 
to treatment by the investigator. The exposure adjusted event rate for all terms related to 
depression events show no increase in the rate of reactions compared to clinical studies. The 16 
subjects reporting depression events were aged between 23 to 69 years old and the majority  
were female (68.8%). All 16 subjects were taking at least 1 concomitant AED medication 
including, levetiracetam (8 subjects), lamotrigine (5 subjects), clobazam (4 subjects), 
carbamazepine (4 subjects), lacosamide (3 subjects), eslicarbazepin (3 subjects), zonisamide (2 
subjects), topiramate (2 subjects), oxcarbazepine (2 subjects), and clonazepam, pregabalin, 
phenytoin, and valproic acid. Of the 16 subjects reporting ongoing depression events, 5 subjects 
had a history of depression events: 4 subjects with history of depression and 1 subject with a 
history of adjustment disorder with depressed mood. In addition, there was 1 subject with an 
Assessment Report for the Post-Authorisation Measure P46 017  
EMA/16999/2019  
Page 10/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ongoing history of anxiety. Of the 16 subjects reporting depression events, 4 subjects 
additionally reported events of suicidal ideation, 1 subject additionally reported events of 
intentional overdose and suicide attempt, and 2 subjects reported anxiety. 
Of the 8 depression events resulting in withdrawal, 4 subjects had increased total HADS scores 
(anxiety and depression scores); 1 subject had an increased total depression score and reduced 
total anxiety score, 1 subject had an increased total anxiety score and stable total depression 
score, and 1 subject had stable total anxiety score and decreased total depression score at the 
EOS Visit compared to baseline. The remaining subject did not have available HADS data at the 
EOS, but presented with normal total scores (both anxiety and depression) at Baseline. 
Of the 5 depression events resulting in a dose reduction, 1 subject had increased total HADS 
scores (anxiety and depression scores), 1 subject had decreased total HADS scores (anxiety 
and depression scores), and 1 subject had increased total anxiety score and reduced total 
depression score at the EOS compared to Baseline. The remaining 2 subjects did not have 
PASS Report E2007-G000-402 HADS data available at the EOS; 1 subject presented at 
Baseline with a mild depression and 1 subject additionally did not have Baseline HADS data. 
Of the 2 events requiring no action 1 subject had increased total HADS scores (anxiety and 
depression scores) and 1 subject had increased total anxiety score and reduced total depression 
score at the EOS compared to Baseline. The remaining 2 subjects did not have HADS data  
available at the EOS; 1 subject presented at Baseline with a mild depression and 1 subject 
additionally did not have Baseline HADS data. 
Implications of the cases of depression for labelling are not discussed by the MAH. The 16 
cases from the PASS are either confounded by other medications or a psychiatric history. The 
cases are assessed in the context of the prevalence of mood disorders in patients with epilepsy 
which is known to be increased. The currently available data in the PASS are insufficient for 
labelling depression but the issue of depression, low mood and related terms will continue to be 
closely monitored at PSUSAs. The class risk of suicidality is labelled in the SmPC without the 
labelling of depression.  
Events that are reported with a greater frequency than clinical trial data include suicidality 
(including terms suicidal ideation, intentional drug overdose and suicide attempt)- in clinical 
studies frequency was 1.0% and in this study Study 402, a slight increase (1.1%) was noted with 
an incidence of 2.1%. The incidence of aggression (including terms aggression, anger and 
paranoia) in clinical studies was 5.1% and in this study slightly increased at 5.4%. 
Suicidality and aggression are adequately labelled in the SmPC and there are no risk factors 
identified in the line listings of cases in the PASS data that would warrant additional 
pharmacovigilance activity. 
The MAH reports that 23 subjects had missing data because they did not consent for use of data 
beyond 52 weeks. Where off label use is reported there were 25 (5.2%) subjects who did not 
have partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation that used study drug in this study, 
however, the majority of these subjects had primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, for which 
the study drug was approved during the course of the study. Other indications included 
generalized seizures, unclassified epileptic seizures and infantile spasms, Lennox gastaut 
syndrome, and atypical Dravet syndrome. A total of 4 (0.8%) subjects used study drug off-label 
as monotherapy at any point in the study. The study findings cannot be reliably generalised to 
patients receiving perampanel monotherapy (not an EU authorised indication at the time of 
study) due to this small number of patients. 
There are very small numbers of patients in the subgroups of interest and no conclusions can be 
made as a result. There were no patients with respiratory disease and no patients with a history

of substance abuse. The largest number of patients is in the subgroup with cardiovascular 
disease.  The types of adverse events in these patients were similar to adverse events in the 
general population but with 33 patients in this group no firm conclusions on the significance of 
this can be drawn. 
3.  Overall conclusion 
The study hasn’t achieved its aim of better characterising use in patients in various risk groups, 
due to the small number of patients recruited making interpretation of the findings difficult. The 
agreed number (500 patients) required to power the study to observe the AEs of interest was not 
reached. However in the safety analysis inclusion of 483 patients findings are reassuring that 
there are no adverse events that are not labelled occurring above the frequency observed in 
clinical trial data.  
There are a high number of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events in the 
dataset presented as well as a high proportion of off label use; and where this is known 
perampanel is being used for Dravet’s syndrome or as monotherapy .  
Where data are available there are no concerns that the adverse event profile of perampanel is 
different in patients with any of the risk factors of interest (cardiovascular disease, patients with a 
history of psychotic disorder or suicidal behaviour, those exposed to vigabatrin, patient over 65 
years, patients with renal disease). There are no patients with respiratory disease or substance 
abuse in the study so no conclusion can be drawn.  
All the subgroups of interest must remain as missing information in the RMP. The serious 
adverse events that are possibly related to treatment are either already listed (ataxia, 
aggression, irritability) or the subject of a recent cumulative review in the PSUSA (psychosis, 
confusion) and remain under close monitoring. Depression should remain under close 
monitoring at PSUSAs given the number of cases and the labelling of suicidal behaviour and 
importance of monitoring mood in the context of aggression.   
  PAM fulfilled (all commitments fulfilled) - No further action required

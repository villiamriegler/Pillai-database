1.  Introduction 
On 26 July 2018, the MAH submitted a paediatric study report for study HPV-019 PRI (109823), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended: 
A phase IV, observer-blind, randomized, controlled, multicentric study to assess the safety and 
immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine (Cervarix) administered 
intramuscularly according to a three-dose schedule (Day 0, Week 6, Month 6) in human 
immunodeficiency virus-infected (HIV+) female subjects aged 15 - 25 years, as compared to Merck’s 
HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (Gardasil). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study HPV-019 PRI is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals’ human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine containing HPV-16 and HPV-
18 L1 VLP proteins and AS04 adjuvant was used in this study. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Cervarix is currently indicated from the age of 9 years for the prevention of persistent infection, 
premalignant ano-genital lesions (cervical, vulvar, vaginal and anal) and cervical, vulvar, vaginal and 
anal cancers (squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) caused by oncogenic Human 
Papillomaviruses (HPV). 
Human immunodeficiency virus-infected (HIV+) females are known to be predisposed to a higher risk 
of HPV infection and subsequent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) lesions.  
At the time of the HPV-019 study design, limited data were available on the use of the two HPV 
vaccines (Merck’s Gardasil and GSK Biologicals’ Cervarix) in HIV+ subjects. It is known that HIV+ 
women can mount a humoral response to HPV antigen. During the study conduct, data became 
available from a study conducted in South Africa, in which all HIV-positive and HIV-negative women 
aged 18-25 years who received Cervarix were seropositive for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 after the 
second vaccine dose and one year after the first dose, irrespective of baseline HPV status. 
A study with Gardasil in HIV-infected women aged 13-45 years showed that the vaccine was generally 
safe and immunogenic. However, lower seroconversion rates for HPV types 6,11, 16 and 18 were 
observed in HIV+ women with a viral load of >10000 copies/mL and/or CD4 count <200 cells/μL. 
Results from a large-scale comparative trial between the two licensed HPV vaccines show that immune 
responses were significantly higher with Cervarix compared to Gardasil, as indicated by HPV-16 and 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

HPV-18 neutralizing antibody levels in serum, positivity rates in cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) and 
HPV-16 and HPV-18 specific B cell frequencies, one month after the last dose. 
Five years after vaccination, serum neutralizing antibody levels were still 7.8-fold higher in 18-26 year 
old subjects receiving Cervarix compared to those who received Gardasil.  
These properties may prove important for HIV+ individuals to mount a good immunogenic response to 
HPV vaccination. Although inactivated vaccines can be administered safely to persons with altered 
immunocompetence, the safety and efficacy may differ depending on the type and severity of 
immunodeficiency. The fact that Cervarix and Gardasil do not contain live infectious agents greatly 
reduces concerns about potential harmful effects.  
The current study was designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a 3-dose schedule of 
Cervarix in HIV+ subjects aged 15 - 25 years, as compared to Gardasil. For comparative purposes, a 
group of HIV- subjects was also evaluated. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
HPV-019 PRI (109823): A phase IV, observer-blind, randomized, controlled, multicentric 
study to assess the safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals’ HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 
vaccine (Cervarix) administered intramuscularly according to a three-dose schedule (Day 0, 
Week 6, Month 6) in human immunodeficiency virus-infected (HIV+) female subjects aged 
15 - 25 years, as compared to Merck’s HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (Gardasil). 
Description 
This study was conducted by 15 principal investigators in four countries (Brazil, Estonia, India, and 
Thailand). 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Co-primary: 
Safety: 
- 
To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of both vaccines in HIV+ subjects for up to one 
month after the third dose of vaccine. 
Immunogenicity: 
The following objectives were assessed sequentially: 
- 
To demonstrate non-inferiority of Cervarix versus (vs.) Gardasil in terms of geometric mean 
titres (GMTs) against HPV-16 and HPV-18 measured by Pseudovirion-based neutralization 
assay (PBNA) one month after administration of the third dose of vaccine in HIV+ subjects. 
Criterion: Non-inferiority was to be demonstrated if the lower limit of the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) for the ratio of GMTs (Cervarix over Gardasil) was above 0.5 for both HPV types. 
- 
If the first primary objective for immunogenicity was demonstrated, superiority of Cervarix 
over Gardasil in terms of GMTs against HPV-16 and HPV-18 measured by PBNA in HIV+

subjects was to be assessed following a sequential approach. First, superiority for HPV-18 type 
was to be assessed.  
Criterion: Superiority was to be demonstrated if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of 
GMTs (Cervarix over Gardasil) was above 1 for HPV-18 type with a statistically significant p-
value. Second, if superiority for HPV-18 was shown, superiority for HPV-16 was to be assessed. 
Criterion: Superiority was to be demonstrated if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of 
GMTs (Cervarix over Gardasil) was above 1 for HPV-16 type with a statistically significant p-
value. 
Secondary: 
Immunogenicity: 
- 
To demonstrate superiority of Cervarix vs. Gardasil in terms of GMTs against HPV-16 or HPV-
18 measured by PBNA one month after the administration of the third dose of vaccine in HIV- 
subjects.  
Criterion: Superiority of Cervarix vs. Gardasil was to be demonstrated if the lower limit of the 
97.5% CI for the ratio of GMTs (Cervarix over Gardasil) was above 1 for the antigen 
considered with a statistically significant p-value.  
- 
To evaluate the antibody response of both vaccines with respect to HPV-16 and HPV-18 
antibody levels by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) at Day 0, Week 6, Week 10, 
Months 7, 12, 18 and 24 in all (HIV+ and HIV-) subjects.  
- 
To evaluate the antibody response, by ELISA, against HPV-16 and HPV-18 in cervico-vaginal 
secretions (CVS) at Day 0, Week 6, Week 10, Months 7, 12 and 24 in post-menarcheal 
subjects who volunteer for this procedure.  
- 
To evaluate the memory B and T cell-mediated immune (CMI) response against HPV-16 and 
HPV-18 at Day 0, Week 6, Week 10, Months 7 and 12 in a subset of approximately 100 
subjects (50 HIV+ and 50 HIV-).  
Safety:  
- 
To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of both vaccines in HIV- subjects for up to one month 
after the third dose of vaccine.  
- 
To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of both vaccines in all subjects for up to 24 months 
after the first vaccine dose. 
Study design 
This was a multi-centre, observer-blind, controlled trial with two vaccine groups (Cervarix and 
Gardasil) and a staggered enrollment (Part A and Part B).as presented in the Figures below.

Figure 1 Study design 
The study was supervised by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) consisting of clinical 
experts and a biostatistician that oversaw safety and ethical aspects of the trial. Subjects were enrolled 
in a staggered manner (Part A and Part B). In Part A, a subset of 60 subjects aged 18 - 25 years (30 
HIV+ and 30 HIV- subjects) were to be vaccinated (Dose 1) and evaluated for safety before 
proceeding with the enrolment and vaccination of the remaining subjects (Part B).  
The results of this safety interim analysis were reviewed by the GSK Safety Review Team and the 
IDMC. The IDMC provided recommendation to the sponsor via the GSK Safety Review Team prior to 
proceeding with the enrolment of the remaining study subjects in Part B of the study.

Figure 2 Overview of staggered vaccination progress and safety evaluation 
Study population /Sample size 
The study included females between, and including, 15 and 25 years of age. For HIV seropositive 
subjects, subjects had to be HIV seropositive according to WHO case definition, i.e., positive HIV 
antibody testing (rapid or laboratory-based enzyme immunoassay, confirmed by a second HIV 
antibody test relying on different antigens or of different operating characteristics and/or positive 
virological test for HIV or its components such as HIV-RNA, HIV-DNA or ultrasensitive HIV P24 
antigen).  
Subjects had to be asymptomatic regardless of their prior clinical stage. If they were currently taking 
antiretrovirals (ARVs), subjects were to be on Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) for at least 
one year, have undetectable viral load (i.e., viral load < 400 copies/mm3) for at least six months, and 
have a CD4 cell count > 350 cells/mm3 at study entry. HIV+ subjects diagnosed with active 
tuberculosis (TB), or subjects on TB therapy were not enrolled. No previous vaccination against HPV or 
previous administration of monophosphoryl lipid (MPL) or AS04 adjuvant was allowed.  
Treatments 
This was a multi-centre, observer-blind, controlled trial with two vaccine groups: 
-  Cervarix group: approximately 300 subjects who received 3 doses of GSK Biologicals’ HPV- 
16/18 vaccine at Day 0, Week 6, and Month 6  
-  Gardasil group: approximately 300 subjects who received 3 doses of Merck’s HPV-6/11/16/18 
vaccine at Day 0, Week 6, and Month 6. 
Subjects were randomized 1:1 with central randomization call-in system on internet (SBIR), stratified 
by HIV infection status and by age (15-17 years and 18-25 years).

Statistical Methods 
Analyses were performed as planned in the protocol amendment 8 (dated 26 April 2016) and the 
Statistical Analysis Plan Amendment (dated 23 November 2015), except for the following changes: 
-  Correlation between ELISA and PBNA was performed in HIV+ subjects. 
-  HPV-31 and HPV-45 antibodies were tested at Day 0, Month 7 and Month 24 for all subjects 
with remaining sample quantity ≥650 µl at all the three timepoints. 
- 
Table for number and percentage of subjects with HPV-31 and HPV-45 above the cut-off and 
Geometric mean concentration was generated. 
-  Graphs for persistence of antibodies against HPV-31 and HPV-45 were generated. 
-  Reverse cumulative curves for HPV-31 and HPV-45 antibodies were generated. 
-  Because of GCP non-compliance issues at center 72321, all 172 subjects from this center were 
excluded from statistical analysis. Despite the fact that 6 of the enrolled subjects from this 
center should not have been excluded, it did not impact study conclusions, as shown by 
sensitivity analysis. Safety listings were separately generated for all 172 subjects. 
-  Sub-group immunogenicity analysis was performed by baseline CD4 category, instead of the 
Nadir CD4 as planned in the SAP. 
-  As the number of subjects in the subset considered for CMI analysis was very low, the CMI 
analysis performed by stratification is not presented in the study report.

Analysis of demographics/baseline characteristics:  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, height and weight) of each study cohort were tabulated. 
Cohorts for analysis and withdrawal status were summarized per treatment group. The HIV mode of 
transmission, WHO clinical staging, HIV viral load, CD4 cell count and ARV use of the subjects at 
baseline were presented as a whole and by treatment group. 
Analysis of safety:  
The primary analysis was performed on the Total Vaccinated cohort (TVC). A second analysis based on 
the according-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for safety was performed to complement the TVC analysis. 
Analyses were done on HIV+ subjects (primary objectives) and on HIV- subjects (secondary 
objectives) according to the pre-specified objectives. 
Analysis of immunogenicity: 
Between group assessment: 
Primary and secondary between-group comparisons to assess non-inferiority were done on the ATP 
cohort for immunogenicity (by PBNA, regardless of HPV serostatus at baseline) for the antigen under 
analysis. A second analysis on TVC was performed to support the primary analysis. Primary and 
secondary between-group comparisons to assess superiority were performed on the TVC (by PBNA; 
regardless of HPV serostatus at baseline). A second analysis on ATP cohort for immunogenicity was 
performed to support the primary analysis. 
Two-sided 95% CIs of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 GMT ratios (Cervarix over Gardasil), at Month 7, 
were computed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model on the log10 transformation of the titres 
for HIV+ subjects (primary objective) and for HIV- subjects (secondary objectives). The ANOVA model 
included the vaccine group as fixed effect. 
Within group assessment: 
The within-group comparisons were performed on the ATP cohort for analysis of immunogenicity. A 
second analysis based on the TVC was performed to complement the ATP analysis. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 546 subjects in the TVC vaccinated in this study, a total of 448 subjects completed the study 
(117, 117, 103 and 111 subjects in the HIV+/HPV, HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, 
respectively). The main reasons for withdrawal from the study were withdrawal of consent not due to 
an AE, and loss to follow-up.

doubles]) were detected in all groups and similar in HIV- and HIV+ and for both antigens. 
There was a trend for a higher response in the HPV groups compared to GAR groups.  
-  No substantial HPV-16 and HPV-18 specific CD8+ T cell responses were detected.  
-  A trend for lower B cell responses in HIV+ subjects versus HIV- was observed for HPV-16 and 
HPV-18, in both HPV and GAR groups. 
Assessor’s comment 
The immunogenicity elicited by Cervarix in HIV+ individuals was superior to those elicited by Gardasil, 
which is expected in view of the presence of the AS04 adjuvant and is in line with earlier data.

Table 4 Incidence and nature of symptoms (solicited and unsolicited) reported during the 
30-day (Days 0-29) post-vaccination period following each dose and overall (Total 
vaccinated cohort) 
-  Unsolicited symptoms: Within the 30-day post-vaccination follow-up period:  
o  The most frequently reported unsolicited symptom in the HIV+/HPV group was 
headache, reported by 2.1% of subjects. In the HIV+/GAR and HIV-/GAR groups, 
nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported unsolicited symptom, reported by 
3.1% and 4.1% of subjects, respectively. In the HIV-/HPV group, the most frequently 
reported unsolicited symptom was dysmenorrhea, reported by 2.8% of subjects.  
o  At least one grade 3 unsolicited symptom was reported by 5.4%, 3.1%, 0.7% and 
2.1% of subjects after 1.9%, 1.1%, 0.2% and 0.7% of doses, in the HIV+/HPV, 
HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, respectively. None of the grade 3 
unsolicited symptoms were reported by more than 1 subject in any group.  
o  At least one unsolicited symptom considered by the investigator to have a possible 
causal relationship to vaccination was reported by 7.0%, 6.3%, 2.8% and 1.4% 
subjects after 2.9%, 2.1%, 1.0% and 0.5% of doses in the HIV+/HPV, HIV+/GAR, 
HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, respectively. The most frequently reported unsolicited 
symptoms considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to

vaccination in the HIV+/HPV group were headache and dizziness, reported by 2 
subjects (1.6%).  
o  One subject (0.8%) in the HIV+/HPV group reported a grade 3 unsolicited symptom 
considered by the investigator to have a possible causal relationship to vaccination 
(immune thrombocytopenic purpura). The event was also a SAE and a pIMD.  
- 
Fatal SAEs: Two fatal SAEs (bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis) were reported for 1 
subject in the HIV+/GAR group. The investigator did not consider the SAEs to be possibly 
causally related to vaccination.  
-  Non-fatal SAEs: Within the 30-day period after last dose of vaccination in HIV+ subjects, 6 
subjects in the HIV+/HPV and HIV+/GAR groups reported at least one SAE. During the entire 
study period, a total of 23 subjects (9 each in the HIV+/HPV and HIV+/GAR groups, 4 in the 
HIV-/HPV group and 1 in the HIV-/GAR group) reported a total of 29 SAEs (11, 12, 5 and 1 in 
the HIV+/HPV, HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, respectively). One SAE, which was 
also a pIMD (immune thrombocytopenic purpura), was considered by the investigator to have 
been due to underlying HIV infection which may have been aggravated by the study vaccine. 
All nonfatal SAEs resolved without sequelae.  
-  Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events: Apart from one subject in the 
HIV+/GAR group with fatal SAEs, no subjects were withdrawn from the study due to an 
AE/SAE.  
-  Medically significant conditions (MSC): Within the 30-day period after the last dose of 
vaccination (up to Month 7), in HIV+ subjects, a total of 44 subjects (17 in the HIV+/HPV 
group and 27 in the HIV+/GAR group) reported at least one MSC. In HIV- subjects, a total of 
21 subjects (7 in the HIV-/HPV group and 14 in the HIV-/GAR group) reported at least one 
MSC. Up to Month 18 (12 months after the last dose of vaccination), at least one MSC was 
reported by 25 (19.4%), 37 (28.9%), 10 (6.9%) and 17 (11.7%) subjects in the HIV+/HPV, 
HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, respectively. The most frequently reported MSCs 
(based on an incidence of ≥2 subjects [≥ 1.6%]) were herpes zoster, pain, anaemia and 
vulvovaginal pruritus in the HIV+/HPV group, reported by 2 subjects (1.6%) each, and 
diarrhea, reported by 5 subjects (3.9%) in the HIV+/GAR group. None of the MSCs were 
reported by more than 1 subject in the HIV- /HPV and HIV-/GAR groups.  
- 
pIMDs: Up to Month 18,one subject (0.3%) in the HIV+/HPV group reported one pIMD 
(immune thrombocytopenic purpura).  
- 
Pregnancies: A total of 9 pregnancies were reported up to Month 7. Seven pregnancies (3 in 
the HIV+/HPV group, 1 each in the HIV+/GAR and HIV-/HPV groups, and 2 in the HIV-/GAR 
group) resulted in live infants with no apparent congenital anomaly. Two pregnancies (one 
each in the HIV+/HPV and HIV+/GAR groups) resulted in spontaneous abortion with no 
apparent congenital anomaly. During the entire study period, a total of 28 pregnancies were 
reported. The majority of pregnancies (89.3%) resulted in live infants with no apparent 
congenital anomalies. One subject (10.0%) in the HIV+/HPV group underwent an elective 
termination, and two subjects (7.1%; 1 subject each in the HIV+/HPV and HIV+/GAR groups) 
had spontaneous abortions with no apparent congenital anomalies. 
Assessor’s comment 
Cervarix is more reactogenic than Gardasil, which is expected in view of the presence of the AS04

adjuvant and is in line with earlier data. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Summary  
The immunological co-primary objective of the study was met since: 
-  Non-inferiority of Cervarix compared to Gardasil in terms of GMT ratio assessed by PBNA was 
demonstrated, since the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs (Cervarix over 
Gardasil) was above 0.5 for both HPV types.  
-  Superiority of Cervarix compared to Gardasil in terms of HPV-18 and HPV-16 GMT ratio 
assessed by PBNA was demonstrated, since the lower limit of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs 
(Cervarix over Gardasil) was above 1 for both HPV types with a statistically significant p-value.  
-  Superiority of Cervarix compared to Gardasil in terms of HPV-18 and HPV-16 GMT ratios 
assessed by PBNA was demonstrated in HIV- subjects, with the lower limit of the 97.5% CI for 
the ratio of GMTs (Cervarix over Gardasil) above 1 for both HPV types with a statistically 
significant p-value.  
-  At Month 7, all subjects seroconverted for HPV-16 and all except two in the HIV+/GAR had 
seroconverted for HPV-18.  
-  At Month 24, by ELISA, all initially seronegative subjects (100%) in the HIV+/HPV, HIV-/HPV 
and HIV-/GAR groups, and 94.7% of subjects in the HIV+/GAR group remained seroconverted 
for HPV-16, while seropositivity rates for HPV-18 antibodies were 96.3%, 67.6%, 100% and 
98.5% in the HIV+/HPV, HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, respectively  
-  By ELISA, antibodies against HPV-16 and HPV-18 showed a peak in concentration one month 
after vaccination and a decline until Month 24.  
-  Antibodies against HPV-16 and HPV-18 were detected in most CVS samples tested.  
- 
The co-primary objective of safety of the study was met as the safety and reactogenicity profile 
of both HPV vaccines in HIV+ subjects was acceptable. 
Both HPV vaccines were generally well tolerated when administered to HIV+ and HIV- subjects. 
Cervarix is more reactogenic than Gardasil which is expected in view of the presence of the AS04 
adjuvant and is in line with earlier data. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study HPV-019 is a phase IV, observer-blind, randomized, controlled, multicentric study to assess the 
safety and immunogenicity of Cervarix three-dose schedule (Day 0, Week 6, Month 6) in HIV+ female 
subjects aged 15 - 25 years, as compared to Gardasil. 
The study demonstrates superiority of immune responses to both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens 1 
month after the last vaccination (Month 7) in HIV+ subjects when Cervarix was administered as 
compared to Gardasil. Both HPV vaccines were generally well tolerated when administered to HIV+ and 
HIV- subjects. Cervarix is more reactogenic than Gardasil which is expected in view of the presence of 
the AS04 adjuvant and is in line with earlier data.

The current SmPC presents the following information regarding HIV infected individuals: 
Section 4.4 
Except for asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected subjects for whom 
limited immunogenicity data are available (see section 5.1), there are no data on the use of 
Cervarix in subjects with impaired immune responsiveness such as patients receiving 
immunosuppressive treatment. As with other vaccines, an adequate immune response may not 
be elicited in these individuals. 
… 
Section 5.1 
Immunogenicity in HIV infected women 
In study HPV-020, conducted in South Africa, 22 HIV uninfected and 42 HIV infected subjects 
(WHO clinical stage 1; ATP cohort for immunogenicity) received Cervarix. All subjects were 
seropositive in the ELISA assay to both HPV 16 and 18 one month after the third dose (at 
Month 7) and the seropositivity for HPV 16 and 18 was maintained up to Month 12. The GMTs 
appeared to be lower in the HIV infected group (non overlapping 95% confidence interval). The 
clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. Functional antibodies were not determined. 
No information exists about protection against persistent infection or precancerous lesions 
among HIV infected women. No correlate of protection has been demonstrated so far for the 
HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigens used as part of Cervarix. Also, no information exists about 
protection against persistent infection or precancerous lesions among HIV infected women.  
The MAH concludes that the safety and immunogenicity data are in line with the approved SmPC. 
Meanwhile, an update of the SmPC is planned in 2019 as the data are more robust and informative on 
the HIV population studied.  
As conclusion, the CHMP agrees with the conclusion of the MAH. Meanwhile, information about 
protection against persistent infection or precancerous lesions among HIV infected women is still 
missing. Also of note, no minimal antibody level associated with protection against CIN of grade 2 or 3 
or against persistent infection associated with vaccine HPV types has been identified for HPV vaccines. 
  Fulfilled: 
No further action required, however further data are expected in the context of the final study report of 
study HPV-019 prior any conclusion on product information amendments is made. The MAH is 
committed to submit a variation by 31 December 2019.

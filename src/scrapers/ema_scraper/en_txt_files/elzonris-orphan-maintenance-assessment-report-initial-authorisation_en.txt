2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2015 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
The sponsor Spector Consulting SAS submitted on 16 July 2015 an application for designation as an 
orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 
recombinant human interleukin-3 truncated diphtheria toxin fusion protein for the treatment of blastic 
plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). The application was 
submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan 
medicinal products. 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing recombinant human 
interleukin-3 truncated diphtheria toxin fusion protein was considered justified based on 
preliminary clinical data demonstrating patient responses to treatment; 
the condition is life-threatening due to the aggressive progression leading to a mean survival of 
12-14 months and overall survival rates of 75-52% after one year; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 1.2 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has been 
authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing recombinant human interleukin-3 truncated 
diphtheria toxin fusion protein as an orphan medicinal product for the orphan indication: treatment of 
blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a haematological neoplasm derived from the 
precursor of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The aetiology of BPDCN is unknown. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000004627 
Page 4/7 
 
 
    
 
The nomenclature of BPDCN has evolved over the last 20 years and it was also previously named 
“agranular CD4+/CD56+ hematodermic neoplasm” and “blastic NK-cell lymphoma”. Since the World 
Health Organization classification of tumours of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues in 2008, the 
condition is classified as a distinct entity under acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and related precursor 
neoplasms (Facchetti et al., 2008). The status as distinct entity remains under the 2016 revision to the 
World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukaemia (Arber et al, 2016). 
The approved therapeutic indication “ELZONRIS is indicated as monotherapy for the first-line 
treatment of adult patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN)” falls within the 
scope of the designated orphan condition “blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm”.  
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP 
(please refer to the EPAR). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
At the time of initial designation and review at initial marketing authorisation, the COMP agreed that 
the condition was life-threatening. At the time of this review, BPDCN is presented to the COMP to have 
the same prognosis without any new treatments available. The COMP concluded that the condition 
remains life-threatening due to the aggressive progression leading to a mean survival of 12-14 months 
and overall survival rates of 52-75% after one year. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation, the prevalence was agreed to be approximately 1.2 per 10,000. At the time 
limited epidemiological data on the condition were available and the figure was considered to be a 
conservative (under) estimate based on epidemiological data from NHL/AML.  
For this review the prevalence was presented to the COMP to remain less than 5 per 10,000 and was 
estimated to be 0.1 per 10,000.  
First it is clarified that annual incidence figures can be used to estimate prevalence for this condition 
when taking into consideration published literature that describe disease duration and survival to be 
around 1 year.  
A systematic literature search has been conducted to identify epidemiological literature. One recent 
report from the SEER database in the USA has been identified. The primary epidemiological database 
reports a consistent annual incidence rate at 0.03 or 0.04 per 100,000 for each of the 7 years assessed 
(2008-2014). This would give a prevalence value of 0.004 per 10,000. 
Since this is US data, an attempt to estimate prevalence for the EU has been presented by using 
incidence data of all haematological malignancies and taking into consideration a proportion of BPDCN 
of 0.44%. This proportion is also reported in the scientific literature. When using this proportion in 
combination with HAEMACARE data (Sant et al, 2010) on all haematological malignancies a prevalence 
of 0.014 per 10,000 across the EU has been calculated (0.44% of 3.21 per 10,000). 
Both attempts, the US data and the EU estimation, have certain limitations to establish prevalence in 
the EU at the time of this review. It can be acknowledged that there are limited epidemiological 
sources at this point in time. Taking into consideration all data that has been presented, the COMP 
could accept the estimate of less than 0.1 per 10,000.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
At the time of this review, there are no products authorised products in the EU to treat the condition. 
There are no ESMO or other consensus treatment guidelines for treating the condition. 
The current standard of care include radiotherapy and off label use of chemotherapy treatments 
authorised for lymphoma (e.g. cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP] or 
CHOP-like), AML (e.g. cytarabine plus an anthracycline), or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (e.g. 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, [hyper-CVAD] alternating with 
methotrexate, and cytarabine).  
Furthermore, it is reported that stem cell transplantation can be a successful treatment. BPDCN 
patients should be referred for an allo-HCT evaluation as soon as possible to determine their candidacy 
for the procedure and to initiate donor identification in eligible cases. 
Significant benefit 
No authorised medicines or satisfactory methods have been identified for the treatment of the 
condition. Significant benefit is not applicable.  
4.  COMP list of issues 
Not applicable. 
5.  COMP position adopted on 16 November 2020 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be less than 0.1 in 
10,000 persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life-threatening due to the aggressive progression leading to a mean survival of 
12-14 months and overall survival rates of 52-75% after one year; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the European Union for 
patients affected by the condition. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied.

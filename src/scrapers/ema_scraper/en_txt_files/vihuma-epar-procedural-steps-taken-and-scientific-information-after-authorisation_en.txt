SmPC and PL 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Vihuma in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
No changes in the PI have been considered necessary 
based on the data provided in the renewal applica-tion. 
Nevertheless, changes in the PI have been included in the 
SmPC and in annex IIIB to align the wording with the 
excipient guideline for sodium content, to delete the 
additional monitoring text (inverted black triangle) and to 
align the text to the latest QRD review

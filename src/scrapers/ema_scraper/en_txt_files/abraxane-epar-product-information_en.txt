CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in adult patients who 
have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard, anthracycline containing 
therapy is not indicated (see section 4.4). 
Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. 
Abraxane in combination with carboplatin is indicated for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung 
cancer in adult patients who are not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or radiation therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Abraxane should only be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised 
in the administration of cytotoxic agents. It should not be substituted for or with other paclitaxel 
formulations. 
Posology 
Breast cancer 
The recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 
weeks.  
Dose adjustments during treatment of breast cancer 
Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 for a week or longer) or 
severe sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg/m2 for 
subsequent courses. Following recurrence of severe neutropenia or severe sensory neuropathy, additional 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose reduction should be made to 180 mg/m2. Abraxane should not be administered until neutrophil 
counts recover to >1500 cells/mm3. For Grade 3 sensory neuropathy, withhold treatment until resolution 
to Grade 1 or 2, followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses. 
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
The recommended dose of Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine is 125 mg/m2 administered 
intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The concurrent recommended 
dose of gemcitabine is 1000 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes immediately after the 
completion of Abraxane administration on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.

Non-small cell lung cancer: 
The recommended dose of Abraxane is 100 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 
minutes on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle.  The recommended dose of carboplatin is AUC = 6 
mg•min/mL on Day 1 only of each 21-day cycle, beginning immediately after the end of Abraxane 
administration.   
Dose adjustments during treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: 
Abraxane should not be administered on Day 1 of a cycle until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is ≥1500 
cells/mm3 and platelet count is ≥100,000 cells/mm3. For each subsequent weekly dose of Abraxane, 
patients must have an ANC ≥500 cells/mm3 and platelets >50,000 cells/mm3 or the dose is to be withheld 
until counts recover.  When counts recover, resume dosing the following week according to the criteria in 
Table 4. Reduce subsequent dose only if criteria in Table 4 are met.

Special populations 
Hepatic impairment 
For patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1 to ≤ 1.5 x ULN and aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] ≤ 10 x ULN), no dose adjustments are required, regardless of indication. Treat 
with same doses as patients with normal hepatic function. 
For metastatic breast cancer patients and non-small cell lung cancer patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 to ≤ 5 x ULN and AST ≤ 10 x ULN), a 20% reduction in dose is 
recommended. The reduced dose may be escalated to the dose for patients with normal hepatic function if 
the patient is tolerating the treatment for at least two cycles (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
For patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that have moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment, there are insufficient data to permit dosage recommendations (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
For patients with total bilirubin > 5 x ULN or AST > 10 x ULN, there are insufficient data to permit 
dosage recommendations regardless of indication (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
Adjustment of the starting Abraxane dose is not required for patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (estimated creatinine clearance ≥30 to <90 ml/min). There are insufficient data available to 
recommend dose modifications of Abraxane in patients with severe renal impairment or end stage renal 
disease (estimated creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) (see section 5.2). 
Elderly 
No additional dosage reductions, other than those for all patients, are recommended for patients 65 years 
and older. 
Of the 229 patients in the randomized study who received Abraxane monotherapy for breast cancer, 13% 
were at least 65 years of age and < 2% were 75 years and older. No toxicities occurred notably more 
frequently among patients at least 65 years of age who received Abraxane. However, a subsequent 
analysis in 981 patients receiving Abraxane monotherapy for metastatic breast cancer, of which 15% were 
≥ 65 years old and 2% were ≥ 75 years old, showed a higher incidence of epistaxis, diarrhoea, 
dehydration, fatigue and peripheral oedema in patients ≥ 65 years. 
Of the 421 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the randomized study who received Abraxane in 
combination with gemcitabine, 41% were 65 years and older and 10% were 75 years and older. In patients 
aged 75 years and older who received Abraxane and gemcitabine, there was a higher incidence of serious 
adverse reactions and adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation (see section 4.4). Patients 
with pancreatic adenocarcinoma aged 75 years and older should be carefully assessed before treatment is 
considered (see section 4.4). 
Of the 514 patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the randomized study who received Abraxane in 
combination with carboplatin, 31% were 65 years or older and 3.5% were 75 years or older.  
Myelosuppression events, peripheral neuropathy events, and arthralgia were more frequent in patients 65 
years or older compared to patients younger than 65 years of age. There is limited experience of 
Abraxane/carboplatin use in patients 75 years or older. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling using data from 125 patients with advanced solid tumours 
indicates that patients ≥ 65 years of age may be more susceptible to development of neutropenia within the 
first treatment cycle. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Abraxane in children and adolescents aged 0 to less than 18 years has not been 
established. Currently available data are described in section s 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on 
a posology can be made. There is no relevant use of Abraxane in the paediatric population for the 
indication of metastatic breast cancer or pancreatic adenocarcinoma or non-small cell lung cancer. 
Method of administration 
Administer reconstituted Abraxane dispersion intravenously using an infusion set incorporating a 15 µm 
filter. Following administration, it is recommended that the intravenous line be flushed with sodium 
chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose. 
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Lactation (see section 4.6). 
Patients who have baseline neutrophil counts < 1500 cells/mm3. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which may have substantially 
different pharmacological properties compared to other formulations of paclitaxel (see sections 5.1 and 
5.2). It should not be substituted for or with other paclitaxel formulations. 
Hypersensitivity 
Rare occurrences of severe hypersensitivity reactions, including very rare events of anaphylactic reactions 
with fatal outcome, have been reported. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the medicinal product should 
be discontinued immediately, symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient should not be 
rechallenged with paclitaxel. 
Haematology 
Bone marrow suppression (primarily neutropenia) occurs frequently with Abraxane. Neutropenia is 
dose-dependent and a dose-limiting toxicity. Frequent monitoring of blood cell counts should be 
performed during Abraxane therapy. Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Abraxane 
until neutrophils recover to >1500 cells/mm3 and platelets recover to >100,000 cells/mm3 (see section 
4.2). 
Neuropathy 
Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently with Abraxane, although development of severe symptoms is less 
common. The occurrence of Grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy does not generally require dose reduction. 
When Abraxane is used as monotherapy, if Grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops, treatment should be 
withheld until resolution to Grade 1 or 2 followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of 
Abraxane is recommended (see section 4.2). For combination use of Abraxane and gemcitabine, if Grade 
3 or higher peripheral neuropathy develops, withhold Abraxane; continue treatment with gemcitabine at 
the same dose. Resume Abraxane at reduced dose when peripheral neuropathy improves to Grade 0 or 1 
(see section 4.2). For combination use of Abraxane and carboplatin, if Grade 3 or higher peripheral 
neuropathy develops, treatment should be withheld until improvement to Grade 0 or 1 followed by a dose 
reduction for all subsequent courses of Abraxane and carboplatin (see section 4.2). 
Sepsis 
Sepsis was reported at a rate of 5% in patients with or without neutropenia who received Abraxane in 
combination with gemcitabine. Complications due to the underlying pancreatic cancer, especially biliary 
obstruction or presence of biliary stent, were identified as significant contributing factors. If a patient 
becomes febrile (regardless of neutrophil count), initiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. For 
febrile neutropenia, withhold Abraxane and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500 cells/mm3, 
then resume treatment at reduced dose levels (see section 4.2). 
Pneumonitis 
Pneumonitis occurred in 1% of patients when Abraxane was used as monotherapy and in 4% of patients 
when Abraxane was used in combination with gemcitabine. Closely monitor all patients for signs and 
symptoms of pneumonitis. After ruling out infectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of 
pneumonitis, permanently discontinue treatment with Abraxane and gemcitabine and promptly initiate 
appropriate treatment and supportive measures (see section 4.2). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
Because the toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased with hepatic impairment, administration of Abraxane in 
patients with hepatic impairment should be performed with caution. Patients with hepatic impairment may 
be at increased risk of toxicity, particularly from myelosuppression; such patients should be closely 
monitored for development of profound myelosuppression. 
Abraxane is not recommended in patients that have total bilirubin > 5 x ULN or AST > 10 x ULN. In 
addition, Abraxane is not recommended in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that 
have moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN and AST ≤ 10 x ULN) (see 
section 5.2). 
Cardiotoxicity 
Rare reports of congestive heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction have been observed among 
individuals receiving Abraxane. Most of the individuals were previously exposed to cardiotoxic medicinal 
products such as anthracyclines or had underlying cardiac history. Thus, patients receiving Abraxane 
should be vigilantly monitored by physicians for the occurrence of cardiac events. 
CNS metastases 
The effectiveness and safety of Abraxane in patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases has 
not been established. CNS metastases are generally not well controlled by systemic chemotherapy. 
Gastrointestinal symptoms 
If patients experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxane, they may 
be treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agents. 
Eye disorders 
Cystoid macular oedema (CMO) has been reported in patients treated with Abraxane. Patients with 
impaired vision should undergo a prompt and complete ophthalmologic examination. In case CMO is 
diagnosed, Abraxane treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated (see 
section 4.8). 
Patients 75 years and older 
For patients of 75 years and older, no benefit for the combination treatment of Abraxane and gemcitabine 
in comparison to gemcitabine monotherapy has been demonstrated. In the very elderly (≥ 75 years) who 
received Abraxane and gemcitabine, there was a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions and adverse 
reactions that led to treatment discontinuation including haematologic toxicities, peripheral neuropathy, 
decreased appetite and dehydration. Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma aged 75 years and older 
should be carefully assessed for their ability to tolerate Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine with 
special consideration to performance status, co-morbidities and increased risk of infections (see section 
4.2 and 4.8). 
Other 
Although limited data is available, no clear benefit in terms of prolonged overall survival has been 
demonstrated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with normal CA 19-9 levels prior to start of treatment 
with Abraxane and gemcitabine (see section 5.1). 
Erlotinib should not be co-administered with Abraxane plus gemcitabine (see section 4.5). 
Excipients 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’. 
4.5 
Interactions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The metabolism of paclitaxel is catalysed, in part, by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C8 and 
CYP3A4 (see section 5.2). Therefore, in the absence of a PK drug-drug interaction study, caution should 
be exercised when administering paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to inhibit either 
CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole and other imidazole antifungals, erythromycin, fluoxetine, 
gemfibrozil, clopidogrel, cimetidine, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir) because toxicity of 
paclitaxel may be increased due to higher paclitaxel exposure. Administering paclitaxel concomitantly 
with medicines known to induce either CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, 
efavirenz, nevirapine) is not recommended because efficacy may be compromised because of lower 
paclitaxel exposures. 
Paclitaxel and gemcitabine do not share a common metabolic pathway. Paclitaxel clearance is primarily 
determined by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 mediated metabolism followed by biliary excretion, while 
gemcitabine is inactivated by cytidine deaminase followed by urinary excretion. Pharmacokinetic 
interactions between Abraxane and gemcitabine have not been evaluated in humans. 
A pharmacokinetic study was conducted with Abraxane and carboplatin in non-small cell lung cancer 
patients. There were no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions between Abraxane and 
carboplatin. 
Abraxane is indicated as monotherapy for breast cancer, in combination with gemcitabine for pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, or in combination with carboplatin for non-small cell lung cancer (see section 4.1). 
Abraxane should not be used in combination with other anticancer agents.  
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during treatment and up to 1 month 
after receiving treatment with Abraxane. Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to use effective 
contraception and to avoid fathering a child during and up to six months after treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are very limited data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregnancy. Paclitaxel is suspected to cause 
serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Studies in animals have shown reproductive 
toxicity (see section 5.3). Women of childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting 
treatment with Abraxane. Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy, and in women of childbearing 
potential not using effective contraception, unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment 
with paclitaxel. 
Breast-feeding 
Paclitaxel and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk of lactating rats (see section 5.3). It is not 
known if paclitaxel is excreted in human milk. Because of potential serious adverse reactions in 
breast-feeding infants, Abraxane is contraindicated during lactation. Breast-feeding must be discontinued 
for the duration of therapy.  
Fertility 
Abraxane induced infertility in male rats (see section 5.3). Based on findings in animals, male and female 
fertility may be compromised. Male patients should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to 
treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines  
Abraxane has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Abraxane may cause 
adverse reactions such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (common) that may affect the ability to 
drive and use machinery. Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they feel tired or 
dizzy. 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of the safety profile  
The most common clinically significant adverse reactions associated with the use of Abraxane have been 
neutropenia, peripheral neuropathy, arthralgia/myalgia and gastrointestinal disorders.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions 
This section contains the most common and clinically relevant adverse reactions related to Abraxane.  
Adverse reactions were assessed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 
260 mg/m2 Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal phase III clinical study (Abraxane 
monotherapy).  
Adverse reactions were assessed in 421 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who were treated with 
Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine (125 mg/m2 Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine at a 
dose of 1000 mg/m2 given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle) and 402 gemcitabine 
monotherapy-treated patients receiving first-line systemic treatment for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the 
pancreas (Abraxane/gemcitabine).  
Adverse reactions were assessed in 514 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with 
Abraxane in combination with carboplatin (100mg/m2 Abraxane given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day 
cycle in combination with carboplatin given on Day 1 of each cycle) in the phase III randomized, 
controlled clinical trial (Abraxane/carboplatin). Patient-reported taxane toxicity was assessed using the 4 
subscales of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Taxane questionnaire. Using repeated 
measure analysis, 3 of the 4 subscales (peripheral neuropathy, pain hands/feet and hearing) favored 
Abraxane and carboplatin (p ≤ 0.002). For the other subscale (oedema), there was no difference in the 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment arms.  
Infections and infestations 
Abraxane/gemcitabine 
Sepsis was reported at a rate of 5% in patients with or without neutropenia who received Abraxane in 
combination with gemcitabine during the conduct of a trial in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Of the 22 cases 
of sepsis reported in patients treated with Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine, 5 had a fatal 
outcome. Complications due to the underlying pancreatic cancer, especially biliary obstruction or presence 
of biliary stent, were identified as significant contributing factors. If a patient becomes febrile (regardless 
of neutrophil count), initiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. For febrile neutropenia, withhold 
Abraxane and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500 cells/mm3, then resume treatment at 
reduced dose levels (see section 4.2). 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders 
Abraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer 
In patients with metastatic breast cancer, neutropenia was the most notable important haematological 
toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was rapidly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was 
reported in 71% of patients. Grade 4 neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 9% of patients treated 
with Abraxane. Febrile neutropenia occurred in four patients on Abraxane. Anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dl) was 
observed in 46% of patients on Abraxane and was severe (Hb < 8 g/dl) in three cases. Lymphopenia was 
observed in 45% of the patients. 
Abraxane/gemcitabine 
Table 7 provides the frequency and severity of haematologic laboratory-detected abnormalities for 
patients treated with Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine or with gemcitabine.

Abraxane/carboplatin 
Anaemia and thrombocytopenia were more commonly reported in the Abraxane and carboplatin arm than 
in the Taxol and carboplatin arm (54% versus 28% and 45% versus 27% respectively).  
Nervous system disorders 
Abraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer 
In general, the frequency and severity of neurotoxicity was dose-dependent in patients receiving 
Abraxane. Peripheral neuropathy (mostly Grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy) was observed in 68% of 
patients on Abraxane with 10% being Grade 3, and no cases of Grade 4. 
Abraxane/gemcitabine 
For patients treated with Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine, the median time to first occurrence 
of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was 140 days. The median time to improvement by at least 1 grade was 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
21 days, and the median time to improvement from Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy to Grade 0 or 1 was 29 
days. Of the patients with treatment interrupted due to peripheral neuropathy, 44% (31/70 patients) were 
able to resume Abraxane at a reduced dose. No patients treated with Abraxane in combination with 
gemcitabine had Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy. 
Abraxane/carboplatin 
For non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with Abraxane and carboplatin, the median time to first 
occurrence of Grade 3 treatment-related peripheral neuropathy was 121 days, and the median time to 
improvement from Grade 3 treatment related peripheral neuropathy to Grade 1 was 38 days.  No patients 
treated with Abraxane and carboplatin experienced Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy. 
Eye disorders 
There have been rare reports during post-marketing surveillance of reduced visual acuity due to cystoid 
macular oedema during treatment with Abraxane (see section 4.4).  
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
Abraxane/gemcitabine 
Pneumonitis has been reported at a rate of 4% with the use of Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine. 
Of the 17 cases of pneumonitis reported in patients treated with Abraxane in combination with 
gemcitabine, 2 had a fatal outcome. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis. 
After ruling out infectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of pneumonitis, permanently discontinue 
treatment with Abraxane and gemcitabine and promptly initiate appropriate treatment and supportive 
measures (see section 4.2). 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Abraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer 
Nausea occurred in 29% of the patients and diarrhoea in 25% of the patients.  
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Abraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer 
Alopecia was observed in >80% of the patients treated with Abraxane. The majority of alopecia events 
occurred less than one month after initiation of Abraxane. Pronounced hair loss ≥ 50% is expected for the 
majority of patients who experience alopecia. 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
Abraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer 
Arthralgia occurred in 32% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 6% of cases. Myalgia occurred in 
24% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 7% of cases. The symptoms were usually transient, 
typically occurred three days after Abraxane administration and resolved within a week.  
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Abraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer 
Asthenia/Fatigue was reported in 40% of the patients. 
Paediatric population 
The study consisted of 106 patients, 104 of whom were paediatric patients aged from 6 months to less than 
18 years (see section 5.1). Every patient experienced at least 1 adverse reaction. The most frequently 
reported adverse reactions were neutropenia, anaemia, leukopenia and pyrexia. Serious adverse reactions 
reported in more than 2 patients were pyrexia, back pain, peripheral oedema and vomiting. No new safety 
signals were identified in the limited number of paediatric patients treated with Abraxane and the safety 
profile was similar to that of the adult population.

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no known antidote for paclitaxel overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient should be 
closely monitored. Treatment should be directed at the major anticipated toxicities, which are bone 
marrow suppression, mucositis and peripheral neuropathy.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, plant alkaloids and other natural products, taxanes, 
ATC Code: L01CD01 
Mechanism of action  
Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and 
stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation. This stability results in the inhibition of the 
normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic 
cellular functions. In addition, paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or “bundles” of microtubules 
throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis.  
Abraxane contains human serum albumin-paclitaxel nanoparticles of approximately 130 nm in size, where 
the paclitaxel is present in a non-crystalline, amorphous state. Upon intravenous administration, the 
nanoparticles dissociate rapidly into soluble, albumin bound paclitaxel complexes of approximately 10 nm 
in size. Albumin is known to mediate endothelial caveolar transcytosis of plasma constituents, and in vitro 
studies demonstrated that the presence of albumin in Abraxane enhances transport of paclitaxel across 
endothelial cells. It is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial caveolar transport is mediated by 
the gp-60 albumin receptor, and that there is enhanced accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour 
due to the albumin-binding protein Secreted Protein Acidic Rich in Cysteine (SPARC). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Breast cancer 
Data from 106 patients accrued in two single-arm open-label studies and from 454 patients treated in a 
randomised Phase III comparative study are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast 
cancer. This information is presented below. 
Single-arm open-label studies 
In one study, Abraxane was administered as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/m2 to 43 patients 
with metastatic breast cancer. The second trial utilised a dose of 300 mg/m2 as a 30-minute infusion in 63 
patients with metastatic breast cancer. Patients were treated without steroid pre-treatment or planned 
G-CSF support. Cycles were administered at 3-week intervals. The response rates in all patients were 
39.5% (95% CI: 24.9%-54.2%) and 47.6% (95% CI: 35.3%-60.0%), respectively. The median time to 
disease progression was 5.3 months (175 mg/m2; 95% CI: 4.6-6.2 months) and 6.1 months (300 mg/m2; 
95% CI: 4.2-9.8 months). 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Randomised comparative study 
This multi-centre trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated every 3 
weeks with single-agent paclitaxel, either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 given as a 3-hour 
infusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity (N = 225), or as Abraxane 260 mg/m2 given as a 
30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).  
Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status (ECOG 1 or 2) at study entry; 79% had 
visceral metastases; and 76% had > 3 sites of metastases. Fourteen percent of the patients had not received 
prior chemotherapy; 27% had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only, 40% in the metastatic 
setting only, and 19% in both metastatic and adjuvant settings. Fifty-nine percent received study medicinal 
product as second or greater than second-line therapy. Seventy-seven percent of the patients had been 
previously exposed to anthracyclines. 
Results for overall response rate and time to disease progression, and progression-free survival and 
survival for patients receiving > 1st-line therapy, are shown below.

Two hundred and twenty nine patients treated with Abraxane in the randomized, controlled clinical trial 
were evaluated for safety. Neurotoxicity to paclitaxel was evaluated through improvement by one grade 
for patients experiencing Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy. The natural course of 
18 
 
 
 
 
peripheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 courses of 
treatment was not evaluated and remains unknown. 
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
A multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label study was conducted in 861 patients to compare 
Abraxane/gemcitabine versus gemcitabine monotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Abraxane was administered to patients (N = 431) as an intravenous 
infusion over 30-40 minutes at a dose of 125 mg/m2 followed by gemcitabine as an intravenous infusion 
over 30-40 minutes at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. In the 
comparator treatment arm, gemcitabine monotherapy was administered to patients (N = 430) in 
accordance with the recommended dose and regimen. Treatment was administered until disease 
progression or development of an unacceptable toxicity. Of the 431 patients with pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma who were randomized to receive Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine, the 
majority (93%) were white, 4% were black and 2% were Asian. 16% had a Karnofsky Performance Status 
of 100; 42% had a KPS of 90; 35% had a KPS of 80; 7% had a KPS of 70; and <1% of patients had a KPS 
of below 70. Patients with high cardiovascular risk, history of peripheral artery disease and/or of 
connective tissue disorders and/or interstitial lung disease were excluded from the study. 
Patients received a median treatment duration of 3.9 months in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 2.8 
months in the gemcitabine arm. 32% of patients in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm compared with 15% of 
patients in the gemcitabine arm received 6 or more months of treatment.  For the treated population, the 
median relative dose intensity for gemcitabine was 75% in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm and 85% in the 
gemcitabine arm. The median relative dose intensity of Abraxane was 81%. A higher median cumulative 
dose of gemcitabine was delivered in the Abraxane/gemcitabine arm (11400 mg/m2) when compared with 
the gemcitabine arm (9000 mg/m2). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival (OS). The key secondary endpoints were progression-
free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR), both assessed by independent, central, blinded 
radiological review using RECIST guidelines (Version 1.0).

presence of biliary stent at baseline, presence of pulmonary metastases, and number of metastatic sites). 
For patients ≥ 75 years of age in the Abraxane/gemcitabine and gemcitabine arms the survival Hazard 
Ratio (HR) was 1.08 (95% CI 0.653, 1. 797). For patients with normal baseline CA 19-9 levels the

A multicenter, randomized, open-label study was conducted in 1052 chemotherapy-naive patients with 
Stage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer. The study compared Abraxane in combination with carboplatin 
versus solvent-based paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin as first-line treatment in patients with 
advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Over 99% of patients had an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients with pre-existing neuropathy of Grade ≥ 2 or serious 
medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems were excluded. Abraxane was administered 
to patients (N=521) as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 
15 of each 21-day cycle without any steroid premedication and without granulocyte colony stimulating 
factor prophylaxis. Beginning immediately after the end of Abraxane administration, carboplatin at a dose 
of AUC = 6 mg•min/mL was administered intravenously on Day 1 only of each 21-day cycle.  Solvent-
based paclitaxel was administered to patients (N=531) at a dose of 200 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion 
over 3 hours with standard premedication, immediately followed by carboplatin administered 
intravenously at AUC = 6 mg•min/mL. Each drug was administered on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.  In 
both study arms treatment was administered until disease progression or development of an unacceptable 
toxicity. Patients received a median of 6 cycles of treatment in both study arms.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was overall response rate defined as the percentage of patients who 
achieved an objective confirmed complete response or partial response based on an independent, central, 
blinded radiological review using RECIST (Version 1.0).  Patients in the Abraxane/carboplatin arm had a 
significantly higher overall response rate compared with patients in the control arm: 33% versus 25%, 
p = 0.005 (Table 10). There was a significant difference in overall response rate in the 
Abraxane/carboplatin arm compared to the control arm in patients with non-small cell lung cancer of 
squamous histology (N=450, 41% vs. 24%, p<0.001), however this difference did not translate into a 
difference in PFS or OS. There was no difference in ORR between the treatment arms in patients with 
non-squamous histology (N=602, 26% vs 25%, p=0.808).

Paediatric population 
Safety and effectiveness in paediatric patients have not been established (see section 4.2). 
Study ABI-007-PST-001, a Phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose-finding study to assess the safety, 
tolerability and preliminary efficacy of weekly Abraxane in paediatric patients with recurrent or refractory 
solid tumours included a total of 106 patients aged ≥ 6 months to ≤ 24 years.  
The Phase 1 portion of the study included a total of 64 patients aged from 6 months to less than 18 years 
old and determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to be 240 mg/m2, administered as an intravenous 
infusion over 30 minutes, on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle.  
The Phase 2 portion enrolled a total of 42 patients using a Simon two-stage minimax design, aged from 6 
months to 24 years with recurrent or refractory Ewing’s sarcoma, neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma 
for the evaluation of antitumour activity assessed by the overall response rate (ORR). Of the 42 patients, 1 
patient was < 2, 27 were aged ≥ 2 to < 12, 12 were aged ≥12 to < 18 and 2 adult patients were aged ≥ 18 to 
24 years old. 
Patients were treated for a median of 2 cycles at the MTD. From the 41 patients eligible for efficacy 
evaluation in stage 1, 1 patient in the rhabdomyosarcoma group (N=14) had a confirmed partial response 
(PR) resulting in an ORR of 7.1% (95% CI:  0.2, 33.9). No confirmed complete response (CR) or PR was 
observed in either the Ewing’s sarcoma group (N=13) or the neuroblastoma group (N=14). None of the 
study arms continued into stage 2 because the protocol-defined requirement of ≥ 2 patients to have a 
confirmed response was not met.  
The median overall survival results, including the 1-year follow-up period were 32.1 weeks (95% CI: 
21.4, 72.9), 32.0 weeks (95% CI: 12, not established) and 19.6 weeks (95% CI: 4, 25.7) for the Ewing’s 
sarcoma, neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma groups, respectively. 
The overall safety profile of Abraxane in paediatric patients was consistent with the known safety profile 
of Abraxane in adults (see section 4.8). Based on these results, it was concluded that Abraxane as 
monotherapy does not have meaningful clinical activity or survival benefit that warrants further 
development in the paediatric population.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane at dose 
levels of 80 to 375 mg/m2 were determined in clinical studies. The paclitaxel exposure (AUC) increased 
linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.hr/ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg/m2. 
In a study in patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel 
following Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/m2 over 30 minutes were compared with those 
following 175 mg/m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hours. Based on 
non-compartmental PK analysis, the plasma clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane was larger (43%) than 
that following a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and its volume of distribution was also higher (53%). 
There were no differences in terminal half-lives. 
In a repeat dose study with 12 patients receiving Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/m2, 
intra-patient variability in AUC was 19% (range = 3.21%-37.70%). There was no evidence for 
accumulation of paclitaxel with multiple treatment courses. 
Distribution 
Following Abraxane administration to patients with solid tumours, paclitaxel is evenly distributed into 
blood cells and plasma and is highly bound to plasma proteins (94%). 
The protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane was evaluated by ultrafiltration in a within-patient 
comparison study. The fraction of free paclitaxel was significantly higher with Abraxane (6.2%) than with 
solvent-based paclitaxel (2.3%). This resulted in significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with 
Abraxane compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, even though the total exposure is comparable. This is 
possibly due to paclitaxel not being trapped in Cremophor EL micelles as with solvent-based paclitaxel. 
Based on the published literature, in vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins, (using paclitaxel at 
concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 µg/ml), indicate that the presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, 
dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel. 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the total volume of distribution is approximately 1741 L; 
the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/or tissue binding of 
paclitaxel. 
Biotransformation and elimination 
Based on the published literature, in vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices show that 
paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel; and to two minor metabolites, 
3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-3’-p-dihydroxypaclitaxel. The formation of these hydroxylated metabolites 
is catalysed by CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and both CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 isoenzymes, respectively. 
In patients with metastatic breast cancer, after a 30-minute infusion of Abraxane at 260 mg/m2, the mean 
value for cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged active substance accounted for 4% of the total 
administered dose with less than 1% as the metabolites 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, 
indicating extensive non-renal clearance. Paclitaxel is principally eliminated by hepatic metabolism and 
biliary excretion. 
At the clinical dose range of 80 to 300 mg/m2, the mean plasma clearance of paclitaxel ranges from 13 to 
30 L/h/m2, and the mean terminal half-life ranges from 13 to 27 hours. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on population pharmacokinetics of Abraxane was studied in patients 
with advanced solid tumours. This analysis included patients with normal hepatic function (n=130), and 
pre-existing mild (n=8), moderate (n=7), or severe (n=5) hepatic impairment (according to NCI Organ 
Dysfunction Working Group criteria). The results show that mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1 to 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
≤1.5 x ULN) has no clinically important effect on pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel. Patients with moderate 
(total bilirubin >1.5 to ≤3 x ULN) or severe (total bilirubin >3 to ≤5 x ULN) hepatic impairment have a 
22% to 26% decrease in the maximum elimination rate of paclitaxel and approximately 20% increase in 
mean paclitaxel AUC compared with patients with normal hepatic function. Hepatic impairment has no 
effect on mean paclitaxel Cmax. In addition, elimination of paclitaxel shows an inverse correlation with 
total bilirubin and a positive correlation with serum albumin. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling indicates that there is no correlation between hepatic 
function (as indicated by the baseline albumin or total bilirubin level) and neutropenia after adjusting for 
Abraxane exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic data are not available for patients with total bilirubin >5 x ULN or for patients with 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (see section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis included patients with normal renal function (n=65), and pre-existing 
mild (n=61), moderate (n=23), or severe (n=l) renal impairment (according to draft FDA guidance criteria 
2010). Mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≥30 to <90 ml/min) has no clinically 
important effect on the maximum elimination rate and systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of paclitaxel. 
Pharmacokinetic data are insufficient for patients with severe renal impairment and not available for 
patients with end stage kidney disease. 
Elderly 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis for Abraxane included patients with ages ranging from 24 to 85 
years old and shows that age does not significantly influence the maximum elimination rate and systemic 
exposure (AUC and Cmax) of paclitaxel. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling using data from 125 patients with advanced solid tumours 
indicates that patients ≥ 65 years of age may be more susceptible to development of neutropenia within the 
first treatment cycle, although the plasma paclitaxel exposure is not affected by age. 
Paediatric population  
The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel following 30 minutes of intravenous administration at dose levels of 
120 mg/m2 to 270 mg/m2 were determined in 64 patients (2 to ≤ 18 years) in Phase 1 of a Phase 1/2 study 
in recurrent or refractory paediatric solid tumours. Following dosing increase from 120 to 270 mg/m2, the 
paclitaxel mean AUC(0-inf) and Cmax ranged from 8867 to 14361 ng*hr/ml and from 3488 to 8078 ng/ml, 
respectively. 
Dose normalized peak drug exposure values were comparable across the dose range studied; however, 
dose-normalized total drug exposure values were only comparable across 120 mg/m2 to 240 mg/m2; with 
lower dose-normalized AUC∞ at the 270 mg/m2 dose level. At the MTD of 240 mg/m2, the mean CL was 
19.1 L/h and the mean terminal half-life was 13.5 hours. 
In children and adolescent patients, exposure to paclitaxel increased with higher dosing and weekly drug 
exposures were higher than in adult patients. 
Other intrinsic factors 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses for Abraxane indicate that gender, race (Asian vs. White), and type 
of solid tumours do not have a clinically important effect on systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) of 
paclitaxel. Patients weighing 50 kg had paclitaxel AUC approximately 25% lower than those weighing 75 
kg. The clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studied. However, based on the published literature, 
paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic agent at clinical doses, based upon its 
pharmacodynamic mechanism of action. Paclitaxel has been shown to be clastogenic in vitro 
(chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes) and in vivo (micronucleus test in mice). Paclitaxel has 
been shown to be genotoxic in vivo (micronucleus test in mice), but it did not induce mutagenicity in the 
Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary/hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (CHO/HGPRT) 
gene mutation assay. 
Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low fertility when administered 
prior and during mating in male and female rats and foetal toxicity in rats. Animal studies with Abraxane 
showed non-reversible, toxic effects on the male reproductive organs at clinically relevant exposure levels. 
Paclitaxel and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk of lactating rats. Following intravenous 
administration of radiolabelled paclitaxel to rats on days 9 to 10 postpartum, concentrations of 
radioactivity in milk were higher than in plasma and declined in parallel with the plasma concentrations.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Preparation and administration precautions 
Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticancer medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised in handling Abraxane. The use of gloves, goggles and protective clothing is 
recommended. If the dispersion contacts the skin, the skin should be washed immediately and thoroughly 
with soap and water. If it contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed thoroughly with 
water. Abraxane should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately trained in the 
handling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff should not handle Abraxane. 
Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible 
infiltration during administration of the medicinal product. Limiting the infusion of Abraxane to 30 
minutes, as directed, reduces the likelihood of infusion-related reactions. 
Reconstitution and administration of the product 
Abraxane is supplied as a sterile lyophilised powder for reconstitution before use. After reconstitution, 
each ml of dispersion contains 5 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound nanoparticles. 
100 mg vial: Using a sterile syringe, 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion 
should slowly be injected into a vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute. 
250 mg vial: Using a sterile syringe, 50 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion 
should slowly be injected into a vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute. 
The solution should be directed onto the inside wall of the vial. The solution should not be injected 
directly onto the powder as this will result in foaming. 
Once the addition is complete, the vial should be allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure 
proper wetting of the solid. Then, the vial should gently and slowly be swirled and/or inverted for at least 
2 minutes until complete redispersion of any powder occurs. The generation of foam must be avoided. If 
foaming or clumping occurs, the dispersion must stand for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The reconstituted dispersion should be milky and homogenous without visible precipitates. Some settling 
of the reconstituted dispersion may occur. If precipitates or settling are visible, the vial should be gently 
inverted again to ensure complete redispersion prior to use.  
Inspect the dispersion in the vial for particulate matter. Do not administer the reconstituted dispersion if 
particulate matter is observed in the vial. 
The exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml dispersion required for the patient should be calculated and the 
appropriate amount of reconstituted Abraxane should be injected into an empty, sterile, PVC or non-PVC 
type intravenous bag. 
The use of medical devices containing silicone oil as a lubricant (i.e. syringes and IV bags) to reconstitute 
and administer Abraxane may result in the formation of proteinaceous strands. Administer Abraxane using 
an infusion set incorporating a 15 µm filter to avoid administration of these strands. Use of a 15 µm filter 
removes strands and does not change the physical or chemical properties of the reconstituted product.  
Use of filters with a pore size less than 15 µm may result in blockage of the filter. 
The use of specialized di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)-free solution containers or administration sets is 
not necessary to prepare or administer Abraxane infusions.  
Following administration, it is recommended that the intravenous line be flushed with sodium chloride 9 
mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements.

Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. 
If you have any further questions, ask your doctor or nurse. 
This medicine has been prescribed for you only. Do not pass it on to others. It may harm them, even

Contents of the pack and other information 
Possible side effects 
1.  What Abraxane is and what it is used for  
What Abraxane is 
Abraxane contains, as its active substance, paclitaxel attached to the human protein albumin, in the form 
of tiny particles known as nanoparticles. Paclitaxel belongs to a group of medicines called “taxanes” used 
in cancer. 
• 
Paclitaxel is the part of the medicine that affects the cancer, it works by stopping cancer cells from 
dividing – this means that they die. 
Albumin is the part of the medicine that helps paclitaxel dissolve in the blood and get across the 
walls of the blood vessels into the tumour. This means that other chemicals that can cause side 
effects that can be life threatening are not needed. Such side effects occur far less with Abraxane. 
• 
What Abraxane is used for 
Abraxane is used to treat the following types of cancer: 
Breast Cancer 
• 
• 
Breast cancer which has spread to other parts of the body (this is called “metastatic” breast cancer). 
Abraxane is used in metastatic breast cancer when at least one other therapy has been tried but has 
not worked and you are unsuitable for treatments containing a group of medicines called 
“anthracyclines”. 
People with metastatic breast cancer who received Abraxane where another therapy had failed, were 
more likely to experience a reduction in tumour size, and lived longer than people who took an 
alternative therapy. 
• 
Pancreatic cancer 
• 
Abraxane is used together with a medicine called gemcitabine if you have metastatic cancer of the 
pancreas. People with metastatic pancreatic cancer (pancreatic cancer that has spread to other parts 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
of the body) who received Abraxane with gemcitabine in a clinical trial lived longer than people 
who had only received gemcitabine. 
Lung Cancer 
• 
Abraxane is also used together with a medicine called carboplatin if you have the most common 
type of lung cancer, called “non-small cell lung cancer”. 
Abraxane is used in non-small cell lung cancer where surgery or radiotherapy would not be suitable 
to treat the disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Abraxane 
Do not use Abraxane 
• 
if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredients of Abraxane (listed in 
section 6); 
if you are breast-feeding; 
if you have a low white blood cell count (baseline neutrophil counts <1500 cells/mm3 - your doctor 
will advise you on this). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or nurse before using Abraxane 
• 
• 
• 
if you have poor kidney function; 
if you have severe liver problems; 
if you have heart problems. 
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you experience any of these conditions whilst being treated with Abraxane, 
your doctor may wish to stop treatment or reduce the dose: 
• 
if you experience any abnormal bruising, bleeding, or signs of infections such as a sore throat or a 
fever; 
if you experience numbness, tingling, pricking sensations, sensitivity to touch, or muscle weakness; 
if you experience breathing problems, like shortness of breath or dry cough. 
• 
• 
Children and adolescents 
Abraxane is only for adults and should not be taken by children and adolescents aged below 18 years. 
Other medicines and Abraxane 
Tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines. This includes medicines 
obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. This is because Abraxane can affect the way 
some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect the way Abraxane works. 
• 
Take care and speak to your doctor when taking Abraxane at the same time as any of the following: 
• 
medicines for treating infections (i.e. antibiotics such erythromycin, rifampicin, etc.; ask your 
doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are unsure whether the medicine you are taking is an antibiotic), 
and including medicines for treating fungal infections (e.g. ketoconazole) 
medicines used to help you stabilize your mood also sometimes referred to as anti-depressants (e.g. 
fluoxetine)  
medicines used to treat seizures (epilepsy) (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin) 
medicines used to help you lower blood lipid levels (e.g. gemfibrozil) 
medicine used for heartburn or stomach ulcers (e.g. cimetidine) 
medicines used to treat HIV and AIDS (e.g. ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, efavirenz, 
nevirapine) 
a medicine called clopidogrel used to prevent blood clots. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy breast-feeding and fertility 
Paclitaxel may cause serious birth defects and should therefore not be used if you are pregnant. Your 
doctor will arrange a pregnancy test before starting treatment with Abraxane. 
Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving 
treatment with Abraxane. 
Do not breast feed when taking Abraxane as it is not known if the active ingredient paclitaxel passes into 
the mother’s milk. 
Male patients are advised to use effective contraception and to avoid fathering a child during and up to six 
months after treatment and should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the 
possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane. 
Ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Some people may feel tired or dizzy after being given Abraxane. If this happens to you, do not drive or use 
any tools or machines. 
If you are given other medicines as part of your treatment, you should ask your doctor for advice on 
driving and using machines. 
Abraxane contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per 100 mg, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’. 
3.  How to use Abraxane 
Abraxane will be given to you by a doctor or nurse into a vein from an intravenous drip. The dose you 
receive is based on your body surface area and blood test results. The usual dose is for breast cancer is 
260 mg/m2 of body surface area given over a 30 minute period. The usual dose for advanced pancreatic 
cancer is 125 mg/m2 of body surface area given over a 30 minute period. The usual dose for non-small cell 
lung cancer is 100 mg/m2 of body surface area given over a 30 minute period. 
How often will you receive Abraxane? 
For treatment of metastatic breast cancer, Abraxane is usually given once every three weeks (on day 1 of a 
21-day cycle). 
For treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer, Abraxane is given on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day 
treatment cycle with gemcitabine being given immediately after the Abraxane.  
For treatment of non-small cell lung cancer Abraxane is given once every week (i.e. on days 1, 8 and 15 of 
a 21-day cycle), with carboplatin being given once every three weeks (i.e. only on day 1 of each 21-day 
cycle), immediately after the Abraxane dose has been given. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or nurse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Medical or healthcare professionals 
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only: 
Instructions for use, handling and disposal 
Preparation and administration precautions 
Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticancer medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised in handling Abraxane. Gloves, goggles and protective clothing should be 
used. If Abraxane dispersion contacts the skin, the skin should be washed immediately and thoroughly 
with soap and water. If Abraxane contacts mucous membranes, the membranes should be flushed 
thoroughly with water. Abraxane should only be prepared and administered by personnel appropriately 
trained in the handling of cytotoxic agents. Pregnant staff should not handle Abraxane. 
Given the possibility of extravasation, it is advisable to closely monitor the infusion site for possible 
infiltration during administration of the medicinal product. Limiting the infusion of Abraxane to 30 
minutes, as directed, reduces the likelihood of infusion-related reactions. 
Reconstitution of the product and administration 
Abraxane should be administered under the supervision of a qualified oncologist in units specialised in the 
administration of cytotoxic agents. 
Abraxane is supplied as a sterile lyophilised powder for reconstitution before use. After reconstitution, 
each ml of dispersion contains 5 mg of paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound nanoparticles. 
Reconstituted Abraxane dispersion is administered intravenously using an infusion set incorporating a 
15 µm filter. 
Reconstitution of 100 mg: 
Using a sterile syringe, 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion should slowly be 
injected into the 100 mg vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute.  
Reconstitution of 250 mg: 
Using a sterile syringe, 50 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion should slowly be 
injected into the 250 mg vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute.  
The solution should be directed onto the inside wall of the vial. The solution should not be injected 
directly onto the powder as this will result in foaming. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Once the addition is complete, the vial should be allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure 
proper wetting of the solid. Then, the vial should gently and slowly be swirled and/or inverted for at least 
2 minutes until complete redispersion of any powder occurs. The generation of foam should be avoided. If 
foaming or clumping occurs, the dispersion should stand for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides. 
The reconstituted dispersion should be milky and homogenous without visible precipitates. Some settling 
of the reconstituted dispersion may occur. If precipitates or settling are visible, the vial should be gently 
inverted again to ensure complete redispersion prior to use. 
Inspect the dispersion in the vial for particulate matter. Do not administer the reconstituted dispersion if 
particulate matter is observed in the vial. 
The exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml dispersion required for the patient should be calculated and the 
appropriate amount of reconstituted Abraxane should be injected into an empty, sterile, PVC or non-PVC 
type intravenous bag 
The use of medical devices containing silicone oil as a lubricant (i.e. syringes and IV bags) to reconstitute 
and administer Abraxane may result in the formation of proteinaceous strands. Administer Abraxane using 
an infusion set incorporating a 15 µm filter to avoid administration of these strands. Use of a 15 µm filter 
removes strands and does not change the physical or chemical properties of the reconstituted product.  
Use of filters with a pore size less than 15 µm may result in blockage of the filter. 
The use of specialized DEHP-free solution containers or administration sets is not necessary to prepare or 
administer Abraxane infusions.  
Following administration, it is recommended that the intravenous line be flushed with sodium chloride 
9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
Stability 
Unopened vials of Abraxane are stable until the date indicated on the package when the vial is kept in the 
outer carton in order to protect from light. Neither freezing nor refrigeration adversely affects the stability 
of the product. This medicinal product does not require any special temperature storage conditions.  
Stability of the reconstituted dispersion in the vial 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C-8°C in the original 
carton, protected from light. 
Stability of the reconstituted dispersion in the infusion bag 
Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2°C-8°C followed by 4 hours 
at 25°C, protected from light.  
However, from a microbiological point of view, unless the method of reconstituting and filling of the 
infusion bags precludes the risks of microbial contamination, the product should be used immediately 
after reconstitution and filling of the infusion bags. 
If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility of the user. 
The total combined storage time of reconstituted medicinal product in the vial and in the infusion bag 
when refrigerated and protected from light is 24 hours. This may be followed by storage in the infusion 
bag for 4 hours below 25°C.

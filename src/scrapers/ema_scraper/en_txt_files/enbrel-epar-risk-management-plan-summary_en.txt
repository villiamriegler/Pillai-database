Summary of risk management plan for Enbrel (etanercept) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for ENBREL. The RMP details 
important risks of ENBREL, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about ENBREL’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
ENBREL’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet provide 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how ENBREL should be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for ENBREL should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which 
are part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
ENBREL’s RMP. 
I. The Medicine and What It Is Used For 
ENBREL is authorised for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 
psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque 
psoriasis, and paediatric plaque psoriasis (see SmPC for the full list of indications). It 
contains etanercept as the active substance and it is given by injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of ENBREL’s benefits can be found in ENBREL’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/enbrel. 
II. Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further 
Characterise the Risks 
Important risks of ENBREL, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about ENBREL’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.  
 
In the case of ENBREL, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected continuously and 
analysed regularly, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of ENBREL is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A. List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of ENBREL are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of ENBREL.  Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Subjects on concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, in addition to their 
underlying disease, could be predisposed to infections.  
Treatment of moderate to severe PsO has typically involved conventional 
systemic therapies such as MTX, cyclosporine, and oral retinoids, or 
phototherapy, which may increase the incidence of infections.  Studies have 
shown that cyclosporine can be associated with influenza-like symptoms (9.9%) 
and upper respiratory tract infections (7.7%) when administered to subjects with 
PsO.

In RA, the primary autoimmune condition may be a contributing factor to the 
development of demyelinating disorders, other inflammatory rheumatic 
disorders, particularly SpAs, are not classically associated with immune 
neurological disorders.  Potential risk factors for central demyelinating disorders 
include vitamin D deficiency and certain childhood infections including Epstein-

II.C. Post-Authorisation Development Plan 
II.C.1. Studies which are Conditions of the Marketing Authorisation 
There are no studies which are conditions of the marketing authorisation or specific 
obligation of etanercept. 
II.C.2. Other Studies in Post-Authorisation Development Plan 
BSRBR  
Purpose of the study: This is a large prospective observational study that obtains data from 
routine clinical practice and whose objective is to evaluate any excess risk in the occurrence 
of various adverse events in patients with RA, AS, and PsA after allowing for confounding 
factors particularly of disease severity and concomitant rheumatic disease therapy.  In 
addition, a long-term pharmacoepidemiological surveillance comparing the safety profile of 
etanercept before and after 3 years of introduction of drug product manufactured from a new 
high capacity drug substance manufacturing process will be conducted using data from 
BSRBR.  The safety concern to be monitored is the immunogenicity profile and related 
clinical outcomes of etanercept manufactured using the SFPHC process in a real-life 
post-marketing setting.

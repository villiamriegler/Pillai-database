are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The aim of this PASS study was to estimate the incidence 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
and to compare some risks (i.e. endometrial hyperplasia, 
of studies to the competent authority 
endometrial cancer) among postmenopausal women 
initiating either CE/BZA or E+P HRT. The results of the 
study show that the risk of breast cancern and stroke might 
be in the same range as among users of estrogen-progestin 
combination hormone therapy. The corresponding incidence 
rates are stated in the SmPC section 5.1.

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy,

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of

Duavive in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that oestrogens are 
clinical drug-drug interaction study B2311065 
undertaken to evaluate the effects of the strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor, itraconazole, on the 
pharmacokinetics of CE 0.45 mg/BZA 20 mg. The 
provision of the study report addresses the post-
authorisation measure MEA 001. In addition, the 
MAH took the opportunity to update section 5.1 of 
the SmPC with the assigned pharmacotherapeutic 
group and ATC code. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
partially metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, 
including CYP3A4. However, in a clinical drug drug 
interaction study, repeat administration of 200 mg 
itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, had minimal 
impact on the pharmacokinetics of CE (as measured by 
estrone and equilin) and bazedoxifene when administered 
with a single dose of CE 0.45 mg/bazedoxifene 20 mg. 
In a pharmacokinetic study (n=24) BMI appeared to have 
little impact on systemic exposure to CE and bazedoxifene.

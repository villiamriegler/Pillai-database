2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a progressive hematologic disease characterized by an 
accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells (CD5+CD23+) in the blood, bone marrow, and secondary 
lymph organs; diagnosis requires the presence of ≥5000 B-lymphocytes/µL in the peripheral blood 
(Hallek 2013). It is the most common form of adult leukaemia in the Western world, with an overall 
age-adjusted annual incidence of 4.65 per 100,000 persons and the number of deaths per year of 1.4 
per 100,000 persons. An exponential increase in the incidence of CLL with age is observed; the median 
age at diagnosis is 72 years of age (Molica 2013). 
The clinical course for CLL is associated with diminished bone marrow function, which is a hallmark of 
leukaemia. Recent guidelines on the management of CLL state that the biological parameters guiding 
treatment of CLL are genetic aberrations including deletions in the short arm of chromosome 17p13.1 
(del17p), deletions/mutations in TP53 and deletions in the long arm of chromosome 11 (del11q), 
which confer a poor prognosis (Ghielmini 2013). In particular, patients with the del17p abnormality 
have an increased risk of relapse and death; the median life expectancy is 2 to 3 years from first-line 
treatment (Stilgenbauer 2010; Eichhorst 2011; Ghielmini 2013).  
Current treatment guidelines from the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) indicate the 
choice of treatment for previously untreated patients with CLL is based on stage of disease, whether a 
patient is considered “fit” and presence or absence of del17p or TP53 mutation (Figure 1).

A representative summary of first-line treatments approved for patients with CLL in the European 
Union (EU) is shown in Table 1.  
Monotherapy with alkylating agents has traditionally been used for the initial treatment of CLL. For 
several decades, single-agent chlorambucil has been a standard first-line therapy for CLL due to its 
moderate toxicity profile, which is of particular advantage for frail and/or older patients (Hallek 2013). 
Chlorambucil has been used as comparator in a large number of studies conducted in patients with

previously untreated CLL, across a range of ages and baseline characteristics. These studies have used 
various criteria to define patient fitness, including age, presence of comorbidities (eg, cumulative 
illness ratings score [CIRS] >6), and creatinine clearance. Bendamustine was approved in the EU as a 
single agent for patients with CLL based on a randomized controlled study in patients <75 years 
showing an improvement in PFS compared with chlorambucil without demonstration of overall survival 
(OS) benefit (Table 1; Knauf 2009). In addition to bendamustine, alemtuzumab therapy has resulted 
in better PFS than chlorambucil, also without improvement in OS (Hillmen 2007). Of note, marketing 
authorization for alemtuzumab, which had been indicated for the treatment of CLL in patients for 
whom fludarabine combination chemotherapy is not appropriate, was withdrawn in the EU in August 
2012. In a Phase 3 study of CLL patients 65 years and older, the purine analogue fludarabine improved 
the response rate without improving PFS or OS (Eichhorst 2009). Additionally, purine analogs and 
bendamustine are associated with increased toxicity over chlorambucil. 
In fit patients without significant comorbidities, the standard first-line therapy for patients without 
TP53 deletion/mutations is the CIT combination fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab (FCR) (Figure 
1; Eichorst 2015). The addition of rituximab to fludarabine-cyclophosphamide (FC) demonstrated a 
significant improvement in PFS compared with FC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] 0.39, 0.67; Hallek 2010). However, no efficacy benefit was evident for the FCR regimen in the 
subset of subjects (N=81) ≥70 years (HR=1.17, 95% CI 0.51, 2.66; Casak 2011) and the CIT 
regimen was associated with an increase in toxicity. Furthermore, in a more recent Phase 3 study, fit 
patients ≥65 years treated with FCR did not derive a benefit in efficacy compared with bendamustine 
plus rituximab (BR) and experienced a higher rate of ≥Grade 3 toxicity including infections (Eichhorst 
2014). Therefore, in this group of patients, treatment with BR may be considered, although it produces 
fewer complete remissions than FCR (Eichorst 2015). 
In patients who are “less fit”, but without TP53 deletion/mutation, the combination of chlorambucil 
plus an anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab, ofatumumab or obinutuzumab) has recently become a 
recommended approach (Figure 1; Eichhorst 2015). Data from randomized clinical studies have shown 
that the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies such as ofatumumab, obinutuzumab, or rituximab to 
chlorambucil provides incremental improvement in median PFS (median PFS range: 15.4 to 29.2 
months) compared to chlorambucil alone (median PFS: 13.1 months; Goede 2015; Hillmen 2015). 
With the increase in treatment intensity, there is also an increase in toxicity including infusion 
reactions, as well as an increased rate of cytopenias, a common complication of all available first-line 
treatment regimens (Grade 3/4: 7% to 21%; MabThera Product Information 2015; Arzerra® Product 
Information 2015; Gazyvaro Product Information 2015). 
Despite improvement in PFS, none of the anti-CD20-based CITs demonstrated improved outcomes in 
patients with del17p or TP53 alterations (Goede 2014; Hallek 2010). Patients with TP53 
deletion/mutation have a poor prognosis even after FCR therapy (Hallek 2010). Therefore, it is 
recommended that these patients are treated with novel inhibitors such as ibrutinib or idelalisib plus 
rituximab, in the first-line setting (Eichhorst 2015). 
In summary, chlorambucil has remained a mainstay of treatment for CLL. Current treatment options 
include combination CIT, however older patients and those with comorbidities are less likely to tolerate 
combination CIT due to its association with more severe toxicities. In addition, patients with poor 
performance or functional status may not tolerate long infusions. Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias are often 
dose-limiting and are frequent causes of morbidity in patients of any age with CLL. Moreover, 
treatment with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy early on in the course of the disease may select for 
the development of more aggressive forms of CLL by introducing mutations (eg, TP53), which confer a 
poor prognosis or lead to treatment-related myelodysplasia or AML(Benjamini 2015). Patients become 
increasingly resistant to the currently available therapeutic agents, with decreased response rates and

PFS with each subsequent regimen (Brown 2015; Hillmen 2011; Maddocks and Lin 2009). Therefore, 
there is a need for alternative treatment options that can be safely administered to all patients 
regardless of age or comorbidities and that provide enhanced clinical outcomes (including 
improvement in hematologic function), which would be considered a substantial improvement over 
currently available therapies.

Ibrutinib is a potent, small molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK). Ibrutinib forms a covalent 
bond with a cysteine residue (Cys 481) in the BTK active site, leading to sustained inhibition of BTK 
enzymatic activity. BTK, a member of the Tec kinase family, is an important signalling molecule of the B 
cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. The BCR pathway is implicated in the 
pathogenesis of several B cell malignancies, including MCL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 
follicular lymphoma, and CLL. BTK’s pivotal role in signalling through the B cell surface receptors results 
in activation of pathways necessary for B cell trafficking, chemotaxis and adhesion. Preclinical studies 
have shown that ibrutinib effectively inhibits malignant B cell proliferation and survival in vivo as well as 
cell migration and substrate adhesion in vitro (SmPC section 5.1). 
The current indication for CLL for Imbruvica is as follows: 
IMBRUVICA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who 
have received at least one prior therapy, or in first line in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation 
in patients unsuitable for chemo immunotherapy. 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) applied for the following indication:  IMBRUVICA is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), 
including those with 17p deletion or TP53 mutation. 
IMBRUVICA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who 
have received at least one prior therapy. 
The recommended indication for approval is: Imbruvica as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (see section 5.1). 
Imbruvica is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) who 
have received at least one prior therapy. 
The recommended dose for the treatment of CLL and is 420 mg (three capsules) once daily (SmPC 
section 4.2). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Chronic general toxicology studies in rats and dogs, fertility and early embryonic development in rats and 
the definitive embryo/fetal development studies in rabbits were performed in compliance with GLP 
regulations. Toxicokinetic evaluations of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 (M37) were also conducted in 
accordance with GLP regulations.  
Nonclinical general toxicology studies of up to 6 months (rats) and 9 months (dogs) duration were 
conducted. In accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidance S5(R2), the rat 
was used for evaluation of effects on male and female fertility and early embryonic development and the 
rat and rabbit were used for the definitive assessment of embryo/fetal development toxicity.  
In addition, reference was made to the 4-week GLP study (14-239-M-PO-TX (TOX10814), in CByB6F1 
hybrid mice (Tg.rasH2 non-transgenic littermates) submitted in procedure EMEA/H/C/003791/II/0018 
and toxicokinetic results were submitted as part of the extension of indication.

No adverse effects were seen in males at any ibrutinib dose. In females, the 80 mg/kg/day ibrutinib dose 
was considered adverse due to moderate effects on mean body weight and mean body weight gain and a 
single pre-term death of uncertain aetiology (with no prodromal signs). The effects on female body 
weight parameters showed partial recovery during the 1-month dosing-free recovery phase. Lower spleen 
weights were observed in males across all ibrutinib dose groups and in females in the 80 mg/kg/day 
group at terminal necropsy. Decreases in liver, pituitary, and adrenal gland weights were seen in females 
across all dose groups at terminal necropsy. Ibrutinib-related changes in clinical pathology parameters 
were limited to minimal, non-adverse, dose-related, shortened coagulation times (prothrombin times and 
activated partial thromboplastin times) in ≥25 mg/kg/day males at termination. The coagulation times 
were similar to controls following recovery. Test article-related non-adverse microscopic changes in the 
pancreas (minimal to mild acinar atrophy or haemorrhage) were observed in all dose groups, including 
controls, at terminal necropsy with a slightly greater incidence and severity in the treated males as 
compared to the treated females.

No adverse effects were noted at 80 mg/kg/day in either males or females. Non-adverse treatment-
related changes included lower mean body weights and body weight gains in treated males as well as 
minor alterations in hematologic and clinical chemistry parameters in both males and females. Decreased 
circulating lymphocytes and minimal to mild lymphoid depletion (Peyer’s patches) were considered non-
adverse and attributed to the intended pharmacology of ibrutinib.

Six of 20 dams in the 45 mg/kg/day group showed persistent body weight loss, reduced fecal output and 
severely decreased food consumption from the start of dosing onwards resulting in pre-terminal sacrifice 
(from day 14 to 23) for humane reasons. All other females survived to the scheduled necropsy on day 28 
of pregnancy. 
In the 45 mg/kg/day group, maternal toxicity was evidenced by a significant decrease in mean body 
weight gain and reduced food consumption during the dosing period. During the post-dosing period, 
mean body weight gain and food consumption partially recovered. In the 15 mg/kg/day group, slightly 
decreased food consumption was noted during the initial dosing phase but mean body weight and mean 
body weight gain remained similar to the vehicle group. 
In the 5 and 15 mg/kg/day groups, there were no adverse effects on litter parameters. In the 45 
mg/kg/day group, maternal toxicity resulted in an increased number of resorptions and, hence, increased 
post-implantation loss. Fetal weight and sex ratio in the ibrutinib administered groups were not affected

by treatment at any dose level. There were no adverse treatment-related external or visceral effects on 
fetuses. There was a statistically significant and dose-related increase in the incidence of litters with 
fetuses with fused sternebrae in the groups receiving 15 and 45 mg/kg/day, with 47.1% and 100% of 
litters affected, respectively. In conclusion, ibrutinib cases malformations in both rat (heart and major 
vessels) and rabbit (fused strebebra). In addition, an increase in skeletal variations was observed in rat.

As noted, in rat and rabbit, ibrutinib metabolites M21, M25, and M34 show subclinical exposures. 
However, in a subsequent 4-week GLP study (14-239-M-PO-TX (TOX10814), in CByB6F1 hybrid mice 
(Tg.rasH2 non-transgenic littermates) submitted in procedure EMEA/H/C/003791/II/0018, conducted as a 
dose range finding study for a 6 month Tg.rasH2 carcinogenicity study, maximum observed concentration 
(Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) exposures above those seen in humans were 
attained for each of these metabolites (Seq0049/M4.2.3.4.2/14-239-M-PO-TX [TOX10814]). The mouse 
no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in this study was the highest dose administered (1000 
mg/kg/day), therefore the Applicant considers that these metabolites M21, M25 and M34 are now 
adequately assessed for toxicity in accordance with ICH M3 (R2). 
Table 1 to Table 4 summarize all available nonclinical exposure data from the initial MAA onwards 
including the recent study 14-239-M-PO-TX (TOX10814) and include references to the source data, 
including the eCTD sequence in which the data was originally submitted. Table 1 presents human 
reference exposure to ibrutinib and its important metabolites. Animal exposures and animal-to-human 
exposure ratios for metabolites M21 (Table 2), M25 (Table 3), and M34 (Table 4), include mouse, rat, 
rabbit, and dog data.

2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment  
The MAH has submitted an updated ERA dated October 2015 in which an updated CONai, based on sales 
forecast, is set to 2700 kg/year in the EU by 2018.  
Phase I 
Using the 2700 kg/year CONai claimed by the MAH Fpen is set to 0.0026% giving a PECsurfacewater of 0.0073 
µg/L.  
The outcome of the Phase II Tier A fate and effects analysis using these figures and previously presented 
ERA data gives;  
PECsurfacewater/PNECwater = 0.0073 (υg/L)/1.55 (υg/L) = 0.0047 which is below 1, thus further testing in the 
aquatic compartment is not necessary.  
PECsurfacewater/PNECmicroorganisms = 0.0073 (υg/L)/100 000  (υg/L) = 0.73x10-7 which is below 0.1, thus 
further evaluation of the fate and effects of ibrutinib on microorganisms is not required. 
PECgroundwater/PNECgroundwater = 0.0018 (υg/L) / 4.79 (υg/L) = 0.004 which is below 1, thus further testing 
in the aquatic compartment is not necessary.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/185019/2016 
Page 18/74 
 
  
  
 
Phase II 
PECsoil / PNECsoil = 0.004 which is below 1, thus further testing in the terrestrial compartment is not 
necessary. 
PECsediment / PNECsediment = 0.005 which is below 1, thus further testing in the sediment compartment is 
not necessary.  
The revised PEC/PNEC ratios recalculated to broaden the existing indication showed some variation 
compared to previously calculated values.  However, this does not change the conclusions drawn from 
previous ERAs and ibrutinib is unlikely to represent a risk to the environment. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In the toxicity studies presented and assessed as part of the initial Marketing Authorisation Application 
(MAA) several target organs were identified in both rat and dog. In the studies submitted as part of this 
extension of indication, lymph nodes, spleen, decreased bone marrow lymphoid cells, thymus, 
nonglandular stomach, intestines, pancreas and cortical and trabecular bone were identified as target 
organs/tissues of toxicity. Additionally, atrophy of squamous epithelium was noted in some tissues 
(oesophagus, stomach, skin and vagina). The primary toxicologic target in dogs dosed for 4 or 13 weeks 
was the intestinal tract. Additional target tissues noted in dogs dosed for 13 weeks included the Peyer’s 
patches and stomach. In studies of up to 13 weeks duration in rats and dogs, treatment-related soft 
faeces and/or diarrhoea was a consistent clinical finding. Also, rats dosed at 175 or 300 mg/kg/day for 13 
weeks included minimal to mild acute inflammation in the cecum, colon, and/or rectum. Slight corneal 
dystrophy/opacity was noted during ophthalmic examinations for 3 of 10 high-dose group dogs (150 
mg/kg/day) in the 4-week study and for 1 high-dose group dog (220/120 mg/kg/day) in the subsequent 
13-week study. In the 13-week study preformed in dog for the initial MAA most findings were observed in 
the high dose group (220/120 mg/kg/day), however the NOAEL in that study were set to 30 mg/kg/day 
due to findings in Peyer’s patches and stomach at the 80/60 mg/kg/day dose. In the 13-week rat study 
the NOEAL were set to 30 mg/kg/day due to multiple findings in the higher dose groups (100, 300M, 
300/175F).   
In general, many of these signals have not been re-identified in the new toxicity studies presented in this 
type II variation. For instance atypical bone marrow cells were not seen in either the rat 6-month study 
at overlapping dose levels or in the dog 9-month study. Also, the intestinal tract toxicity initially observed 
in dog was not re-identified in the 9-month study. It could be speculated that treated animals develops 
tolerance to ibrutinib over time. However, when comparing the exposure data from the previously 
assessed studies and the now submitted prolonged toxicity studies it is clear that the animals in the new 
longer studies are not exposed to the levels reached in the previous studies. Consequently, it can be 
questioned whether the decrease in toxicity is due to tolerance or if the lack of toxicity in the new studies 
is due to under exposure, especially since the major toxicities found in the previous studies were 
observed at higher exposure than what was tested in the new studies. Nevertheless, it can be concluded 
that no new relevant toxicity has been revealed in the new rat and dog studies.  
There were no effects on fertility or reproductive capacities in males or females rats up to the maximum 
dose tested of 100 mg/kg/day [HED 16 mg/kg].  
In pregnant rabbits, ibrutinib at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day or greater was associated with skeletal 
malformations (fused sternebrae) and ibrutinib at a dose of 45 mg/kg/day was associated with increased 
post implantation loss. Ibrutinib caused malformations in rabbits at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 2.0 times the exposure (AUC) in patients with MCL administered ibrutinib 560 mg daily 
and 2.8 times the exposure in patients with CLL or WM receiving ibrutinib dose 420 mg per day). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/185019/2016 
Page 19/74 
 
  
  
Consequently the foetal NOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the AUC of ibrutinib at a dose 
of 560 mg daily) (SmPC section 5.3). 
No effects on fertility or reproductive capacities were observed in male or female rats up to the maximum 
dose tested, 100 mg/kg/day (Human Equivalent Dose [HED]16 mg/kg/day) (SmpC section 5.3). 
Normally, non-clinical in vivo evaluation of major human metabolites (>10% of total) should be 
performed before entering phase III. In the case of ibrutinib, the initial indication falls under the ICH S9 
guideline, in which it is noted that in some cases, metabolites that have been identified in humans have 
not been qualified in nonclinical studies. It is further commented in for these metabolites, a separate 
evaluation is generally not warranted for patients with advanced cancer. Since the first-line CLL indication 
applied for in the context of this application, includes patients with a longer life expectancy, the non-
clinical evaluation of major human metabolites needs to be addressed, and more specifically M21, M25 
and M34. The exposures to these metabolites in human correspond up to three times that of ibrutinib.  
The MAH presented data on exposure with the major human metabolites in the pivotal toxicity studies 
and in the dose-range finding study performed in a transgenic Tg.rasH2 mouse model. The data clearly 
showed that supra-clinical exposures where only reached in the transgenic Tg.rasH2 mouse model but not 
in the pivotal toxicity studies or in the embryo-foetal studies.  
The study performed in transgenic Tg.rasH2 mice had the objective to determine the potential toxicity of 
ibrutinib and to support the dose selection for a 26-week oral carcinogenicity study in this strain of mice. 
In addition, the toxicokinetic characteristics of ibrutinib and 5 of its metabolites were determined. The 
study was performed over 28 days of daily dosing without recovery. The following parameters and end 
points were addressed; clinical signs, body weights, body weight changes, food consumption, clinical 
pathology parameters (hematology and clinical chemistry), gross necropsy findings, organ weights, and 
histopathologic examinations (assessed in relation to procedure EMEA/H/C/3791/II/18). The data showed 
that ibrutinb was well tolerated (with only minimal severity non-adverse findings at ≥ 500 mg/kg/day) 
also at the highest dose tested and NOEAL were subsequently set at this dose (1000 mg/kg/day).  
The potential transformation of ibrutinib into genotoxic metabolites has not been addressed by the MAH. 
For the intended indication such transformation is regarded as a potential safety concern.  Consequently, 
the MAH will perform, a (Q)SAR/DEREK analysis and AMES test for M21 and M34 but not for the M25 
since it is form in vitro using rat S9 metabolic activation and consequently already evaluated for 
mutagenic potential and since M25 did not generate structural alerts when analyzed by DEREK-analysis 
(see discussion on clinical efficacy).     
The revised PEC/PNEC ratios recalculated to broaden the existing indication showed some variation 
compared to previously calculated values.  However, this does not change the conclusions drawn from 
previous ERAs and ibrutinib is unlikely to represent a risk to the environment. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted by the MAH support the sought indication.  
Considering the above data, ibrutinib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

In the pivotal trial (Study 1115), the patients in the ibutinib arm (n=136) received 420 mg/day, which is 
the same dose as already approved for second line treatment of CLL. Sparse sampling for determination 
of ibrutinib and metabolite PCI-45227 concentrations was performed on day 1 in Cycles 2 (predose and 
around 1, 2 and 4 hours) and 3 (predose). 
The plasma concentrations observed were in agreement with previous data in CLL and other patient 
populations. Below the observed concentrations are shown overlayed to the model based simulations 
derived from a previous popPK model.  
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics in the new patient population appears to be similar to the pharmacokinetics in 
previously approved indications. This is expected. No changes in the SmPC regarding pharmacokinetics

(section 5.2) or drug interactions (section 4.5) are required. Information regarding drug interactions and

Treatments 
Treatment Arm A 
Oral chlorambucil 0.5 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle; the dose could be increased, if well 
tolerated, in increments of 0.1 mg/kg on Day 1 of each cycle to a maximum of 0.8 mg/kg; patients 
received a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 12 cycles, in the absence of progressive disease or 
unacceptable toxicity.  
Subjects in the chlorambucil group who had progressive disease confirmed by the IRC could subsequently 
receive ibrutinib in the follow-on study, PCYC-1116-CA. 
Treatment Arm B 
Oral ibrutinib 420 mg/day, until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib compared with chlorambucil 
based on the independent review committee (IRC) assessment of PFS in subjects 65 years of age or older 
with treatment-naive CLL or SLL. 
Secondary objectives were to compare the treatment arms in terms of the following: 
• 
Efficacy 
o  Overall response rate (ORR) according to International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) 2008 
criteria, as assessed by the IRC  
o  Rate of minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete responses (CRs)  
o  Overall survival (OS)  
o  Fatigue measured by Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-
Fatigue) 
o  Haematological improvement measured by haemoglobin and platelet counts 
•  Safety 
o  Safety and tolerability of ibrutinib compared with chlorambucil 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the IRC, defined 
as the time from the date of randomization to date of IRC-confirmed disease progression or date of death 
from any cause, whichever occurred first. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
•  ORR as assessed by the IRC, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a best overall 
response of CR, CRi, nPR, or PR per IRC assessment. 
•  OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/185019/2016 
Page 24/74 
 
  
  
• 
Event-free survival (EFS) as assessed by the IRC, defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the date of first documentation of EFS event 
•  Hematologic improvement: 
o  Rate of sustained platelet improvement, defined as the proportion of subjects with 
sustained improvement defined as platelet counts >100 ×109/L if baseline ≤100 ×109/L 
or increase ≥ 50% over baseline, sustained continuously for ≥ 56 days without blood 
transfusions or growth factors. 
o  Rate of sustained haemoglobin improvement, defined as the proportion of subjects with 
sustained improvement defined as haemoglobin >11 g/dL if baseline ≤11 g/dL or increase 
≥ 2 g/dL over baseline, sustained continuously for ≥ 56 days without blood transfusions 
or growth factors. 
•  Rate of MRD-negative response, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved MRD-
negative response defined as <1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes, assessed by flow cytometry of a 
bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood sample, per central laboratory.  
•  Rate of clinically meaningful improvement in FACIT-Fatigue score, defined as the proportion of 
subjects who achieved a clinically meaningful improvement defined as an improvement of ≥ 3 
points at any post-baseline time point measured by FACIT-Fatigue scale prior to the initiation of 
anti-neoplastic therapy. 
Sample size 
This study was designed to evaluate the effect of treatment on PFS and was powered for this endpoint. A 
minimum of 272 subjects were to be enrolled. The sample size for the study was calculated based on the 
following considerations:  
o  A 1:1 randomization ratio between Arms A and B. 
o  A uniform accrual rate of approximately 40 subjects per month. 
o  A target HR of 0.5. Assuming the median PFS for Arm A is 15 months from randomization, a 
target HR of 0.5 corresponds to a 2-fold increase in median PFS for Arm B relative to Arm A 
(ie, 30 months vs. 15 months, respectively). 
o  Eighty-one progression events provide approximately 85% power to detect the target HR of 
0.5 based on a log-rank test and a 1-sided overall significance level of 0.025. 
o  No interim analysis. 
The sample size and power calculations were based on a 1-sided log-rank test for PFS. A total of 273 
subjects were randomized to participate in the study. Four of the subjects were randomized at Site 381 
which was closed due to GCP quality findings with respect to source data collection and improper handling 
of study drug. Therefore these 4 subjects were excluded from the clinical database.  
As a result, only 269 subjects were considered as being randomized for the intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses 
performed. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised 1:1, with 136 subjects randomized to the ibrutinib arm and 133 subjects 
randomized to the chlorambucil arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/185019/2016 
Page 25/74 
 
  
  
The randomisation of treatment assignment was blocked by geographic region (US vs. non-US) and 
stratified by ECOG PS (0, 1 vs. 2) and presence of advanced-stage disease (Rai stage ≤ II vs. III-IV) 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Analyses of efficacy endpoints were conducted on the Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population, defined as all 
randomized subjects in the clinical database. The analysis for the study occurred 15 months 
after randomization of the last subject. 
In general, all tests were to be performed at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, unless otherwise 
specified.  
If the primary endpoint achieved statistical significance, tests of secondary endpoints were to 
be performed at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05 in a sequential hierarchical manner based on 
a closed testing procedure.  All key secondary endpoints were to be ranked in sequence according to the 
following hierarchical order: ORR; OS; EFS; Rate of sustained platelet improvement; Rate of sustained 
hemoglobin improvement; Rate of MRD-negative response; Rate of clinically meaningful improvement in 
FACIT-Fatigue score. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 269 subjects were randomized, with 136 subjects randomized to the ibrutinib arm and 133 
subjects randomized to the chlorambucil arm (see table below). Four additional randomized subjects from 
a single site (Site 381) were excluded from the clinical database due to significant GCP issues and for-
cause closure of this clinical site.

Study 1102 
This was an open-label, nonrandomized, multicentre, Phase 1b/2 study of ibrutinib in subjects with 
treatment-naïve or relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL conducted in the United States. Cohorts were defined by 
the disease population (treatment-naïve or relapsed/refractory) and by the ibrutinib dose level (420 mg 
or 840 mg). Subjects received study treatment once daily until disease progression, unacceptable drug-
related toxicity, or other reason for treatment discontinuation. After a minimum of 12 cycles of treatment 
or at the closure of this study, in the absence of disease progression, subjects could continue treatment 
in a long-term extension study PCYC-1103-CA (Study 1103). 
In total 132 subjects were enrolled in Study 1102 and 27 of these subjects were previously untreated and 
received 420 mg/day of ibrutinib. Efficacy was a secondary objective of this study; 19 of the 27 
previously untreated subjects (70.4%) were considered responders (partial response or better) and 4 
subjects (14.8%) achieved a complete response. Sustained hematological improvement was also 
observed for platelet counts (63.6%) and hemoglobin (70.0%) in previously untreated subjects who had 
baseline thrombocytopenia and anemia. 
The study was completed after a median follow-up of 31 months. At the 24-month landmark, the 
estimated PFS rate was 95.8% and the estimated survival rate 96.2% in previously untreated subjects.

At the end of the study, 18 of 19 subjects who achieved a response of PR or better (94.7%) were alive 
without disease progression. After a median follow-up of 3 years, median PFS and OS were not reached in 
ibrutinib-treated subjects in Study 1102/extension Study 1103. 
Efficacy in the context of historical data 
The indication sought based on the 1115 study includes not only patients unfit for the standard first-line 
therapy FCR, or those for whom the comparator chlorambucil as monotherapy would be appropriate.  To 
substantiate that ibrutinib would be an appropriate alternative also for  patients eligible for chemo-
immunotherapy, including FCR, cross-study comparisons with trials on which alternative therapies are 
based were presented. As such comparisons are not straightforward, exponential distribution modelling 
was utilised, generating the following graphs.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In the open-label 1115 study patients with del 17-negative disease ≥70 years old, or ≥65-69 years old 
with at least one defined comorbidity, were randomised between continuous ibrutinib (n=136) or 
maximum 12 cycles of chlorambucil (n=133). The primary endpoint was PFS as assessed by an IRC and a 
sequential design was applied for the secondary outcomes. The clinical cut-off for the final analysis was 
15 months after enrolment of the last subject. Demographics seem reasonably balanced between study 
arms. The median age was 73 years. Baseline characteristics were balanced between study arms. 
Approximately 50% had stage I-II disease, 7% had SLL and 20% had 11q del disease. 
With regard to the population under investigation the current ESMO guideline (2015) recommends 
chlorambucil + anti- CD20 therapy in less fit patients without del 17/TP53 mutated disease. In two recent 
studies superior efficacy of chlorambucil plus anti-CD20 (obinutuzumab, rituximab or ofatumumab) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/185019/2016 
Page 42/74 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
therapy over chlorambucil monotherapy has been shown (Goede et al, 2014; Hillmen at el, 2015), albeit 
at the cost of safety. In addition, bendamustin-based therapy may now be an option in some of these 
patients. Nevertheless, in the CHMP advice given 2012, it was considered that the proposed 
inclusion/exclusion criteria probably define a population where chlorambucil would be reasonably therapy. 
In this situation where new more efficacious treatment regimens have been reported since the initiation 
of the pivotal study, historical data may be of value. Here, the comparisons provided by the MAH are 
considered informative. Acknowledging the shortcomings of inter-study comparisons, ibrutinib data on 
PFS, and probably also OS, so far seem unlikely to be inferior of the chlorambucil plus anti-CD20 
combinations. Taken together, the chlorambucil monotherapy control is considered acceptable. 
Important protocol deviations were reported in relatively small but roughly similar fractions of subjects in 
both study arms and are deemed unlikely to affect the interpretation of the study results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary endpoint, PFS by IRC, showed a highly significant HR of 0.161 (0.091, 0.283) at an event 
rate of 11% in the ibrutinib arm and 48% in the chlorambucil arm, mainly due to disease progression. 
The median was 19 months in the chlorambucil arm while not reached in the ibrutinib arm. The KM PFS at 
24 months was 84% for the ibrutinib arm. The KM curve showed an early separation that increases over 
time. The sensitivity analyses, including investigator-assessed PFS, support the primary analysis.  
The subgroup analyses are consistent with the exception of SLL that shows a point estimate for HR of 
1.6. However, given the small size of this subgroup (n=20), the positive outcome in bulky disease and 
the lack of a biological rationale for different activity in SLL vs CLL as these are considered to represent 
the same disease, the finding is considered likely to reflect chance. The effectiveness also in del 11q 
disease is noted. 
Furthermore, it has been shown that the activity of ibrutinib is unaffected by poor prognostic factors such 
as del 17p. Cross study comparisons are indicative that ibrutinib as monotherapy does not yield lower 
efficacy than does various chemo-immunotherapy combinations in more fit patients, though such 
comparisons are necessarily fraught with uncertainty. Further, the tolerability of this single agent in more 
fit patients is highly unlikely to be worse than in less fit patients. 
Significant activity of ibrutinib in terms of response rates was observed; ORR was 82% in the ibrutinib 
arm  vs 35% in the chlorambucil arm. In line with previous experience few CRs were seen and no MRD-
negativity was detected.  
Regarding OS, based on 3 events in the ibrutinib arm and 17 events in the chlorambucil arm a HR of 
0.163 (0.048, 0.558) was observed, p<0.001. Due to immaturity, outcome in patients with better 
prognosis remains to be described. In order to address it, the MAH will submit the final study report from 
study PCYC-1116-CA the open-label extension of Study PCYC-1115-CA (see Risk Management Plan). 
There was a statistically significant sustained platelet or hemoglobin improvement in the ITT population in 
favor of ibrutinib versus chlorambucil. In patients with baseline cytopenias, sustained hematologic 
improvement was: platelets 77.1% versus 42.9%; hemoglobin 84.3% versus 45.5% for ibrutinib and 
chlorambucil respectively. 
At 12 months, 9 patients (7%) in the ibrutinib arm and 29 patients (22%) in the chlorambucil arm were 
non-responders. The EFS difference between study arms was highly statistically significant, HR 0.165. 
The median EFS was 12 months in the chlorambucil arm while not reached in the ibrutinib arm.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
With a median time on study of 18.4 months at the cut- off, and a maturation level of 48% in the control 
arm for the PFS analysis, convincing and internally robust data across the major efficacy endpoints, and 
with strong statistical significance, clearly favour imbrutinib from an efficacy point of view.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
In this Type II variation, the Applicant integrated the data from Study 1115 in previously-untreated CLL 
with the safety profile described for ibrutinib in CLL, MCL, and WM (from Studies 1112, 1102, 1104, 
1118E) in the ibrutinib SmPC. These 5 studies thus form the basis for the safety profile of ibrutinib in 
Section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC.

Specific adverse events of clinical interest 
Haemorrhage 
In Study 1115, 47.4% of the 135 ibrutinib-treated subjects experienced a haemorrhagic TEAE of any 
grade; the most common haemorrhagic events (≥5%) of any severity in the ibrutinib group of Study 
1115 were contusion (8.1%), increased tendency to bruise (5.9%), epistaxis (5.9%), and haematuria 
(5.9%). In the current monotherapy label pool, 46.9% of ibrutinib-treated subjects experienced a 
haemorrhagic TEAE of any severity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/185019/2016 
Page 49/74 
 
  
  
 
 
In the chlorambucil arm, haemorrhagic TEAEs (any grade) were reported for 20 (15.2%) subjects. 
Approximately half of all subjects in the ibrutinib (53.3%) or chlorambucil (53.8%) groups in Study 1115, 
and 32.9% of subjects in the current monotherapy label pool, used concomitant anticoagulant and/or 
antiplatelet medication at any time during the study treatment period. 
Leukostasis 
No cases of leukostasis were reported in Study 1115. There were 2 reports of leukostasis in the current 
monotherapy label pool. 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
No cases of TLS were reported in Study 1115; one event was reported in the current monotherapy label 
pool. 
Infections 
Pneumonias were the most frequently reported type of Grade 3 or 4 infection among ibrutinib- treated 
subjects in Study 1115. 
Atypical infections were uncommon in subjects treated with ibrutinib in Study 1115, and included single 
reports of pneumonia legionella and tuberculosis. 
One subject in the experimental arm died from a Klebsiella infection and 1 patient in the control arm died 
from an acute Hepatitis B infection. 
For 9 subjects (2.1%) in the current monotherapy label pool, the infection event was fatal. Pneumonia 
(6.9%) and urinary tract infection (2.1%) were also the most common serious infection TEAEs in this 
safety population.

Cardiac arrhythmias 
Cardiac arrhythmia TEAEs were reported in 14.8% of the 135 ibrutinib-treated subjects in Study 1115 as 
well as in the current monotherapy label pool vs. 4.5% in chlorambucil group. In both ibrutinib 
safety analysis sets, atrial fibrillation was the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia.

Most of the cardiac arrhythmia TEAEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and non-serious, and few (<2%) led 
to ibrutinib discontinuation or dose reduction. None of these events were fatal in the ibrutinib group of 
Study 1115; 2 were fatal in the current monotherapy label pool (both were episodes of cardiac arrest). 
Table 39. Overview of Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter Events - PCYC-1115 and Current 
Monotherapy Label Pool; Safety Population 
The median time to onset of the initial report of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter was approximately 3 
months after initiation of ibrutinib therapy (median, 99 days), with only 1 subject having an onset of the 
event within the first month of treatment. 
Among the 10 ibrutinib-treated subjects in Study 1115 who experienced atrial fibrillation/flutter, 8 were 
using anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapies, independent of the indication for use. None of the 10 subjects 
with these events had a major haemorrhage, and none had a reported event of ischemic stroke. In the 
current monotherapy label pool, 22 of the 30 subjects (73.3%) with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter were 
using anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapies. A major haemorrhage was reported for 3 of these 30 subjects 
at some time during the study period. A medical review of the 3 cases disclosed that the major 
haemorrhage occurred while on anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy.

A comparative, pooled, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial data analysis (including Studies 1112, 1115, 
MCL3001, and CLL3001) indicated that non-melanoma skin cancer was reported more frequently with 
ibrutinib than with the comparators, 6.1% vs 2.3%, respectively (Table 32).

Hypersensitivity 
In the ibrutinib group of Study 1115, a total of 6 subjects (4.4%) had hypersensitivity TEAEs, of which 
one (0.7%) had a Grade 3 or 4 event (angioedema, Grade 3). None of the hypersensitivity events were 
reported as serious, and none led to ibrutinib discontinuation or dose reduction. 
Eight subjects (6.1%) in the chlorambucil group of Study 1115 had a hypersensitivity TEAE. For 1 
subject, a hypersensitivity event (drug hypersensitivity) resulted in treatment discontinuation of

chlorambucil. 
None of the hypersensitivity TEAEs (4.0%) in the current monotherapy label pool resulted in 
discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy or a reduction in the ibrutinib dose; 1 subject had an event that 
was serious (angioedema, 0.2%). 
Eye disorders 
In Study 1115, TEAEs of any grade in the MedDRA SOC Eye Disorders were reported in 54.8% of subjects 
in the ibrutinib group and 22.7% of subjects in the chlorambucil group. Grade 3 or higher TEAEs reported 
in more than 1 ibrutinib-treated subject in Study 1115 were cataract (2 subjects, 1.5%) and unilateral 
blindness (2 subjects, 1.5%). Of the 2 ibrutinib-treated subjects with unilateral blindness (both reported 
as serious), 1 subject had medical history of vision problems secondary to diabetes, bilateral 
pseudophakia and blindness in the left eye of vision, and the other developed bilateral blindness after 
experiencing central retinal vein occlusion caused by thromboembolic disease. For 1 ibrutinib-treated 
subject (0.7%) in Study 1115, the eye-related TEAE resulted in discontinuation of study treatment 
(vitreous haemorrhage, also reported as serious).  No eye-related TEAE in the chlorambucil group was 
reported with a frequency of ≥10%, and 1 was assessed as Grade 3 (cataract). 
The overall frequency of TEAEs in the SOC Eye Disorders in the ibrutinib treatment group of Study 1115 
was higher than that reported in the current monotherapy label pool (29.5%), possibly due to the older 
median age and longer median treatment duration in Study 1115. In the current monotherapy label pool, 
1 subject had an eye disorder TEAE that was Grade 3 or 4 in severity (retinal detachment), and none 
were serious and none resulted in ibrutinib discontinuation. 
Severe gastrointestinal disorders 
The percentage of subjects with a Grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal (GI) TEAE was 9.6% for the ibrutinib 
group (4.5% for chlorambucil group), and no GI-related event was fatal. Diarrhoea (3.7%) and 
abdominal pain (3.0%) were the most frequent, Grade 3 or 4 GI TEAEs among ibrutinib-treated subjects 
in Study 1115, with all other individual, Grade 3 or 4 GI TEAEs reported in 1 subject each. For 3 ibrutinib-
treated subjects (2.2%) in Study 1115, the GI TEAE was serious (Grade 3 abdominal pain upper, Grade 3 
pancreatitis acute, and Grade 2 constipation). One subject had a GI TEAE that resulted in ibrutinib 
discontinuation (abdominal pain). 
In the current monotherapy label pool, GI TEAEs of Grade 3 or 4 in severity were reported in 33 subjects, 
7.9%. For 1 subject, the GI TEAE was fatal (ileus paralytic). Two subjects (0.5%) in the current 
monotherapy label pool had GI TEAEs that led to discontinuation of ibrutinib treatment (severe diarrhoea 
in both cases. 
Pancreatitis-related TEAE were reported for 1 ibrutinib-treated subject in Study 1115 (pancreatitis acute), 
1 subject in the current monotherapy label pool (pancreatitis chronic), and 1 subject in the chlorambucil 
group of Study 1115 (pancreatitis). 
Renal events 
Four subjects (3.0%) in the ibrutinib group had a Grade 3 or 4 event in this SOC (renal failure acute (2 
subjects), renal impairment (1 subject), renal failure (1 subject), and renal failure chronic (1 subject). For 
1 subject in Study 1115, ibrutinib treatment was discontinued as a result of renal-related TEAE (renal 
failure), and for 3 subjects (2.2%), the renal-related TEAE was serious (renal impairment; renal 
failure and renal failure chronic; renal failure acute). In the chlorambucil group of Study 1115, TEAEs in 
the MedDRA SOC Renal and Urinary Disorders were of grade 3 or 4 in 3 subjects (2.3%). 
In the current monotherapy label pool, grade 3 and 4 events for this SOC were reported in 2.4% and 
serious events in 1.9%.

Hypertension 
Hypertension TEAEs (including preferred terms of hypertension and blood pressure increased) were 
reported as a TEAE for 19 subjects (14.1%) in the ibrutinib group of Study 1115. For 6 subjects (4.4%) 
the event was assessed as Grade 3 or 4 in severity, and for 5 subjects (3.7%) the event assessed as 
treatment related. For all but 2 of the ibrutinib-treated subjects, the hypertension TEAEs were not 
serious, and none resulted in an ibrutinib dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Nine of 19 subjects 
with a reported TEAE of hypertension had a medical history of hypertension prior to ibrutinib therapy, and 
all subjects were managed with addition and/or adjustment of anti-hypertensive therapy. One subject in 
the chlorambucil group of Study 1115 had a hypertension TEAE. 
Among the 420 subjects treated with ibrutinib in the current monotherapy label pool, hypertension TEAEs 
was reported in 35 subjects (8.3%); 3.1% of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 event. None of the reported 
hypertension TEAEs in the current monotherapy label pool were serious or resulted in discontinuation of 
ibrutinib, and for 1 subject, the event resulted in an ibrutinib dose reduction. 
Hepatic events 
In Study 1115, TEAEs in the MedDRA SOC Hepatobiliary Disorders were reported for 8 ibrutinib-treated 
subjects (5.9%), of whom, 4 (3.0%) had a Grade 3 or 4 event. These latter TEAEs consisted for 2 reports 
of hepatic function abnormal (1.5%) and 1 report (0.7%) each of hyperbilirubinemia, bile duct stone, and 
cholangitis. Hepatobiliary TEAEs were reported for 5 subjects (3.8%) in the chlorambucil group of Study 
1115, and for 1 subject, the event was Grade 3 or 4 (cholecystitis). Toxic hepatitis resulted in the death 
of a chlorambucil-treated subject.  
In the current monotherapy label pool, TEAEs of any grade in this SOC were reported in 2.9% of subjects, 
with Grade 3 or 4 events reported for 2 subjects (0.5%) (hyperbilirubinemia and cholecystitis). No 
subject had a fatal hepatobiliary event, and serious hepatobiliary TEAEs were reported in 2 (0.5%) 
subjects (2 reports of cholecystitis). No subject experienced a hepatobiliary TEAE that resulted in 
discontinuation of ibrutinib treatment, although 1 subject had an event that led to dose reduction (hepatic 
function abnormal).

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In the ibrutinib group of Study 1115, no treatment-emergent, Grade 3 or 4 decreases in hemoglobin were 
observed, while treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 decreases in platelets and absolute neutrophil count 
(ANC) were observed for 7.4% and 28.1% of subjects, respectively. 
The percentages of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities in hemoglobin, platelet counts, 
and ANC for the chlorambucil group in Study 1115 were 1.5%, 13.6%, and 31.1%, respectively. 
In study 1115, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) values increased rapidly (but transiently) following 
initiation of ibrutinib to a peak median ALC of approximately 75 x 109/L, followed by a decrease toward 
normal values. The median time to treatment-emergent lymphocytosis (defined as an increase in ALC of 
at least 50% from baseline to an absolute value greater than 5.0 x 109/L) was 2.1 weeks, and 94.8% of 
ibrutinib-treated subjects who displayed treatment-emergent lymphocytosis achieved resolution (median 
time to resolution of 12.4 weeks; resolution defined as a decrease in ALC to baseline or to less than 5.0 x 
109/L). 
Hepatic function parameters 
No subject in the ibrutinib group of Study 1115 had a treatment-emergent, Grade 4 elevation; 3 
ibrutinib-treated subjects (2.3%) had a treatment-emergent, Grade 3 elevation in ALT, 1 subject (0.8%)

had a Grade 3 elevation in ALP, and no subject had a Grade 3 elevation in total bilirubin.  
In the current monotherapy label pool, there were no treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 elevations in ALT 
or AST, and <1% of subjects had a treatment-emergent Grade 3 elevation in ALP or total bilirubin (none 
had a Grade 4 elevation in these parameters).  
Based on case level review, no ibrutinib-treated subject in Study 1115 or the current monotherapy label 
pool met the Hy’s law laboratory criteria without an alternative etiology. 
In the chlorambucil group of Study 1115, Grade 3 or 4 elevations in ALT or AST were infrequent as well, 
reported for 2 (1.5%) subjects each; Grade 3 or 4 elevations in total bilirubin. 
Serum creatinine 
Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 elevations in serum creatinine were observed for 1 subject (0.8%) in 
the ibrutinib group of Study 1115 (0 subjects in chlorambucil group of Study 1115) and for no subject in 
the current monotherapy label pool. 
Among ibrutinib-treated subjects in Study 1115 or the current monotherapy label pool with normal 
baseline CrCl values of ≥60 mL/min, <1% had a decrease in value to <30 mL/min while on treatment, 
and 15.2% and 10.1%, respectively, had a decrease in value to between ≥30 and <60 mL/min on 
treatment.

Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs by MedDRA SOC for the 2 age subgroups indicated that all Grade 3 or 4 cardiac 
disorder TEAEs in the ibrutinib group occurred in subjects ≥70 years (8 subjects, 8.4%), as did all Grade 
3 or 4 neoplasm TEAEs (8 subjects, 8.4%). 
Sex 
Approximately two-thirds of the ibrutinib-treated subjects in Study 1115 were male (65.2%). The overall 
frequencies of TEAEs, Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation were 
similar (<10 % difference) in men and women in the ibrutinib group of this study. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
N/A 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the experimental arm were atrial fibrillation (2 subjects, 1.5%), death 
of unknown cause (2 subjects), bronchopneumonia (1), Klebsiella infection (1), pneumonia legionella (1), 
non-small cell lung cancer (1), abdominal pain (1), vitreous haemorrhage (1), subdural hematoma (1), 
cerebral haemorrhage (1), subarachnoid haemorrhage (1), renal failure (1), rash macular (1), and rash 
maculo-papular (1). 
Fifteen subjects (11.4%) in the control arm discontinued due to TEAEs in the Blood and Lymphatic 
System Disorders SOC compared with none among ibrutinib-treated subjects. 
The most common TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation in the current monotherapy label pool 
were pneumonia (1.2%), subdural hematoma (1.2%), and sepsis (1.0%). All other individual TEAEs 
leading to ibrutinib discontinuation in the safety population were reported in 2 or fewer subjects. 
Approximately twice as many subjects in the chlorambucil group (compared to the ibrutinib group) of 
Study 1115 had a TEAE leading to dose reduction (25 subjects, 18.9%). The most common TEAEs 
resulting in a reduction of the chlorambucil dose (≥2% of subjects) were neutropenia (6.8%), anemia 
(3.8%), and fatigue (2.3%). In the experimental arm, no individual TEAE (ie, preferred term) led to dose 
reduction in more than 1 subject and these events did not cluster within a particular SOC(s). 
Diarrhoea (1.7%) and neutropenia (1.4%) were the only TEAEs leading to dose reduction in 1% or more 
of the current monotherapy label pool. 
Post marketing experience 
The first PBRER/PSUR for ibrutinib has been submitted in the EU and included data received worldwide for 
the reporting period from 21 October 2014 (date of first approval for ibrutinib in EU) through 20 April 
2015. Based on the cumulative total of 1,429,641,360 milligrams of ibrutinib distributed (launch to 30 
Apr 2015), the estimated exposure to this drug in the post marketing setting was 106,372 person-months 
(average daily dose of 448 mg). 
A review of data for this reporting period indicated that the safety profile of ibrutinib remained 
acceptable, and the drug continues to have a favourable benefit-risk profile for the treatment of patients 
with the indications described in the Imbruvica SmPC.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Randomised safety data from the 1115 study has been submitted (ibrutinib, n=135; chlorambucil, 
n=132) and data on ibrutinib compared to the current monotherapy label pool (n=420). The latter partly 
included time-truncated data as compared to the basis for the current SmPC; a re-analysis using non-
truncated data was requested with reporting of any deviations regarding frequency of important AEs or 
ADR determination. The different treatment durations for the datasets should be noted when reviewing 
AE incidences: approximately 17 and 7 months for the ibrutinib and chlorambucil arms of study 1115, 
respectively, and 9 months for the monotherapy pool. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the ibrutinib arm of study 1115 were diarrhoea (42%), fatigue 
(30%), nausea (22%) and cough (22%). A higher rate of eye disorders vs the monotherapy pool is noted 
(55% vs 30%), possibly related to a higher median age and the longer treatment duration, but few grade 
≥ 3 events were reported. Although not adjusted for a declining number of subjects at risk over time, 
which, however, for the ibrutinib arm was quite low, an analysis suggests the lack of an increasing 
specific AE prevalence over time, except for hypertension. Generally, the highest AE rates were noted 
within the first 3 months of treatment. 
When compared to the chlorambucil arm in study 1115, ibrutinib was associated with higher rates of 
grade ≥ 3 events (66% vs 52%) and SAEs (41% vs 25%), but fewer AEs leading to discontinuation or 
dose reduction. It is noted that an SAE related to basal cell carcinoma was reported in 3.7% of patients in 
the ibrutinib arm of study 1115 vs none in the monotherapy pool or the chlorambucil group.  
As expected for a treatment-naïve population, the fraction of patients with AE leading to death was lower 
in the ibrutinib arm of the 1115 study (n=3; 2.2%) than in the monotherapy pool (7.6%); the 
corresponding fraction in the chlorambucil arm was 3%. 
TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation or dose reduction were both reported in 10% of patients in 
the ibrutinib arm of study 1115 vs 23% and 19% in the chlorambucil arm, respectively. For the ibrutinib 
arm, AEs leading to discontinuation were mainly related to infection, haemorrhage, atrial fibrillation and 
rash. As expected in a previously untreated population, the rates of TEAEs leading to death and deaths 
within 30 days of last dose were lower in the ibrutinib arm of the 1115 study compared to the 
monotherapy pool. 
The safety profile observed in the 1115 study was generally consistent with previous reports but a 
comparison with the “current monotherapy label pool” (n=420 with data from the 1112, 1104, 1118E and 
1102 studies in previously treated CLL, MCL and WM, and a few patients with treatment-naïve CLL) 
identified hypertension, muscle spasms and non-melanoma skin cancer as new ADRs. It should be noted 
in the comparisons that time on treatment vary widely between the study populations: approximately 17 
and 7 months for the ibrutinib and chlorambucil arms of study 1115, respectively, and 9 months for the 
monotherapy pool. 
Hypertension was identified as a new ADR for ibrutinib with a prevalence increasing over time. So far, 
only 1 event resulted in dose reduction, none led to treatment discontinuation. Hypertension and muscle 
spasms were identified as new ADRs in the 1115 study and are added in section 4.8 of the SmPC.   
The rate of treatment-emergent other malignancies in the ibrutinib arm of study 1115, total 17% with 
13% non-melanoma skin cancer vs a total 5% in the chlorambucil arm, may be of some concern. In the 
monotherapy pool, 8% of patients were reported with other malignancies. It is acknowledged that CLL 
per se is associated with a substantial increased risk for the development of other malignancies and that 
the different times on treatment may explain the observed differences between the safety populations. 
A comparative, pooled, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial data analysis (including Studies 1112, 1115, 
MCL3001, and CLL3001) indicated that non-melanoma skin cancer was reported more frequently with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/185019/2016 
Page 59/74 
 
  
  
ibrutinib than with the comparators, 6.1% vs 2.3%, respectively.  Patients should be monitored for the 
appearance of non-melanoma skin cancer (SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
In addition, a time to event analyses for non-melanoma skin cancer for ibrutinib and comparator arms in 
the 1115 study and the pooled randomised phase 3 studies was presented. Genotoxic evaluation was 
regarded as negative for ibrutinib. However, the potential transformation of ibrutinib into genotoxic 
metabolites has not been addressed by the MAH. For the intended indication such transformation is 
regarded as a potential safety concern. Consequently, the MAH will perform, a (Q)SAR/DEREK analysis 
and AMES test for M21 and M34 (see discussion on non-clinical). 
Further, the Risk Management Plan has been updated to include non-melanoma skin cancer as an 
important identified risk while other malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) will be 
continued to be listed as an important potential risk. Second primary malignancies will continue to be 
monitored in ongoing clinical trials and through routine pharmacovigilance, and will be presented in the 
PSURs.  
In the safety analysis of the Current monotherapy label pool, time-truncated data was used for the 1112 
and 1104 studies. Given the importance of long-term safety data, not least in the 1st line setting, a re-
analysis of the total data set was requested with reporting on frequency deviations regarding important 
AEs and the determination of ADRs. The only PTs that increased >1% were for Grade ≥ 3 events 
neutropenia (17.4% versus 16.2%), pneumonia (8.6% versus 6.9%) and hypertension (5.2% versus 
3.1%); SAEs that increased by > 1% were pneumonia (9.0% versus 6.9%) and atrial fibrillation (4.8% 
versus 3.6%). No change in identified ADRs was detected and no new safety signals or late-onset 
toxicities were observed. Hypertension would change from the category Common to Very Common. The 
MAH argued for giving the highest weight to randomised data in the procedure for determining ADRs and 
to present follow-up data in DSURs/PSURs and also refers to the growing body of safety data with further 
randomised trials like CLL3001 and MCL3001, which are dealt with in the parallel II-17G procedure. This 
reasoning was considered reasonable and accepted. 
No data of Long term use (>2 years) are available. An open-label extension study (PCYC-1116)  in 
patients 65 years or older with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) 
who participated in study PCYC-1115 is ongoing and a 2 years efficacy and safety update will be provided 
in support of the Missing Information of Long term use (>2 years) (see Risk Management Plan). 
Safety data reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC are now based on an analysis of the experience in 555 
patients with B cell malignancies and, as a result, some ADR frequencies have been updated. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety data gathered in the 1115 study, with support from historical data were largely consistent with the 
known safety profile of ibrutinib with hypertension, muscle spasms and non-melanoma skin cancer being 
new adverse reactions observed in patients treated for CLL. Toxicity was generally manageable. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan (RMP): 
The  PRAC  considered  that  the  RMP  version  5.0  (dated  08  October  2015)  could  be  acceptable  if  the

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In the 1115 study, efficacy was significantly superior with the ibrutinib regimen in terms of the primary 
endpoint PFS, compared to chlorambucil in previously untreated CLL patients with HR 0.161 (p<0.0001), 
based on 15 (11%) events in the ibrutinib arm and 64 (48%) events in the chlorambucil arm. The 
robustness of the PFS effect is supported by sensitivity analyses and by general consistency within 
subgroups. 
The secondary endpoints including ORR by IRC (82% vs 35%, p<0.0001 MRD-negative response, 
sustained haematological improvement (in subjects with cytopenia at baseline in 77% vs 43% of patients 
for thrombocytopenia, p<0.0054, and 84% vs 46% for anaemia, p<0.0001, respectively), and EFS at 12 
months (HR 0.165, p<0.0001) supported the primary efficacy endpoint and favoured the ibrutinib arm 
compared to the chlorambucil arm. 
Collectively, the historical comparison data support the notion that ibrutinib monotherapy would provide 
efficacy in the same range as that seen with first-line combination regimens used in more fit patients. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Overall survival data are still immature and the MAH will provide a 2-year efficacy and safety update of 
the long-term follow-up study PCYC-1116-CA, open-label extension of Study PCYC-1115-CA (see Risk 
Management Plan). 
The 1115 study has been performed in a population of patients deemed unfit for full dose FCR therapy. 
The indication sought includes also patients who would be eligible for FCR, as well as for other chemo-
immunotherapies as first line treatment of CLL. Estimates of efficacy in patients eligible for FCR is based 
on extrapolation to a more fit population and no direct estimate of efficacy is available. While cross-study 
comparisons are indicative that efficacy is not substantially lower than for alternatives, and this 
comparison may be conservative in the sense that patients were selected for the 1115 study based on an 
age and clinical status indicating that full dose FCR would not be tolerated, the absence of a direct, 
randomised comparison confers uncertainty to the knowledge of relative efficacy, for which no precise 
metric can be provided. However, in view of the benefits observed and plausible generalisations, this 
uncertainty does not raise concerns since based on indirect comparisons inferior efficacy can be ruled out. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The ibrutinib safety profile observed in the 1115 study was generally consistent with previous reports but 
hypertension, muscle spasms and non-melanoma skin cancer were identified as new ADRs. TEAEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation or dose reduction were both reported in 10% of patients in the ibrutinib arm 
of study 1115 vs 23% and 19% in the chlorambucil arm, respectively.  
As expected for a treatment-naïve population, the fraction of patients with AE leading to death was lower 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/185019/2016 
Page 68/74 
 
  
  
 
 
in the ibrutinib arm of the 1115 study (n=3; 2.2%) than in the monotherapy pool (7.6%); the 
corresponding fraction in the chlorambucil arm was 3% (n=4).The most frequently reported TEAEs were 
diarrhoea (42%), fatigue (30%), nausea (22%) and cough (22%). When compared to the chlorambucil 
arm in study 1115, ibrutinib was associated with higher rates of grade ≥3 events (66% vs 52%) and 
SAEs (41% vs 25%), but as noted above, fewer AEs leading to discontinuation or dose reduction. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Ibrutinib as a single agent in the first line setting has been studied in a relatively elderly patient 
population deemed unfit for FCR. There are no estimates of the frequency of adverse events in a more fit 
population, but in comparison with pooled monotherapy data there are nothing indicating that “first-line” 
per se would increase the risk for adverse reactions; rather the opposite.  To this may be added that a 
treatment with acceptable tolerability in unfit patients are likely to be better tolerated in fit patients. 
A comparative, pooled, randomized Phase 3 clinical trial data analysis (including Studies 1112, 1115, 
MCL3001, and CLL3001) indicated that non-melanoma skin cancer was reported more frequently with 
ibrutinib than with the comparators, 6.1% vs 2.3%, respectively). This has been adequately reflected in 
the SmPC (see section 4.4 and 4.8) and is reflected in the Risk Management Plan.  
In addition, second primary malignancies will continue to be monitored in ongoing clinical trials and 
through routine pharmacovigilance, and will be presented in the PSURs.  
No data of Long term use (>2 years) are available. An open-label extension study (PCYC-1116)  in 
patients 65 years or older with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) 
who participated in study PCYC-1115 is ongoing and a 2 years efficacy and safety update will be provided 
in support of the Missing Information of Long term use (>2 years) (see Risk Management Plan).

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The considerably better outcomes of the time-dependent measures, including OS, and also response rate 
vs chlorambucil, with generally good internal consistency, are deemed to be of definitive clinical 
relevance; furthermore, the magnitude of the effect seen in this study, supported by previous 
experiences such as results in the treatment of patients with 17p deletion, are indicative of a clinically 
relevant effect also in patients fit for various chemo-immunotherapies. This is supported by the relatively 
good tolerability of ibrutinib monotherapy  
From a safety perspective the 1115 study compares ibrutinib, dosed until progression or unacceptable 
side effects, with chlorambucil dosed for a definite number of cycles (12). With the exception of 
hypertension, the incidence of particular AEs does not seem to increase over time and with respect to 
hypertension this AE is expected to be readily handled by the treating physician. In conjunction with the 
data presented for the monotherapy poo,l the safety profile of ibrutinib within the 9-17 months exposure 
window must be considered sufficiently well characterised. Given the considerably longer treatment 
duration expected for most patients when initiated in the 1st line setting, long-term safety of ibrutinib is 
addressed in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
In comparison to chlorambucil monotherapy, in the investigated population, the efficacy of ibrutinib is 
clearly superior. In relation to chlorambucil, the safety profile of ibrutinib is characterised by higher rates 
of grade ≥3 events and SAEs but eventually lower fractions of AEs leading to discontinuation or dose 
reductions.  
The benefit-risk balance for the studied population is considered positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The 1115 study was a comparative study versus chlorambucil in previously untreated patients with CLL 
that are ≥ 65 years of age. In patients below 70 years of age, a comorbidity that could preclude the use 
of FCR was mandated for inclusion. Chlorambucil was selected as this was considered an acceptable 
treatment option for such patients at the time of initiation of the study. The treatment benefit was large 
(PFS HR 0.161, P <0.0001) and absolute B/R is undoubtedly favorable. 
Furthermore, it has been shown that the activity of ibrutinib is unaffected by poor prognostic factors such 
as del 17p. Cross study comparisons are indicative that ibrutinib as monotherapy does not yield lower 
efficacy than does various chemo-immunotherapy combinations in more fit patients, though such 
comparisons are necessarily fraught with uncertainty. Further, the tolerability of this single agent in more 
fit patients is highly unlikely to be worse than in less fit patients. 
As elaborated above, it appears that positive B/R may be inferred also in previously untreated patients 
that are eligible for FCR, and there are no indications that the use of ibrutinib until disease progression in 
such patients would impact the effectiveness of subsequent therapies. While the relative efficacy versus 
first line chemo-immunotherapy alternatives is not known, based on indirect comparisons single agent 
ibrutinib seems a reasonable alternative to consider among first line options for patients with CLL, 
regardless of fitness status and cytogenetics, along with chemo-immunotherapy alternatives.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication to add the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) based on the results from the final CSR of study PCYC-1115-CA (MEA 021). 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been updated. The Package 
Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to make minor editorial changes to the SmPC. A revised version of the RMP (version 5.0.3) 
has been approved as part of this application. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

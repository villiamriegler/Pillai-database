1.  Introduction 
This report covers the following post-authorisation commitments undertaken by the MAH: 
the clinical study report for the following paediatric study: HPV-025 EXT013 Month 120 and the 
Post-Authorisation Measure P46 19.7 , a follow-up request from CHMP “ a summary analysis of all 
pregnancy data from study HPV-025 Ext 013 up to Month 120 should be included in the final CSR 
of study HPV-025 Ext 013 ” 
The primary study HPV-013 evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 vaccine 
as compared to hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine in 2,067 healthy adolescent female subjects aged 
10-14 years. The immunogenicity subset comprised of 1244 vaccinated subjects enrolled at pre-
specified centres in Taiwan, Germany, Honduras, Panama and Colombia. 
A four-year follow-up study Ext HPV-013 was conducted in the same countries to assess the 
long-term persistence of HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody responses 18, 24, 36 and 48 months after 
the first vaccine dose given in study HPV-013. In addition, this follow-up study also assessed long-
term vaccine safety. To participate in the follow-up study until Month 48, subjects had to be part of 
the immunogenicity subset of study HPV-013, had to have completed the study and had to have 
received three doses of HPV-16/18 vaccine. 
The primary indication of the HPV-16/18 vaccine is for use in young adolescent females. It is 
therefore important to establish the long-term persistence of the immune response and safety of 
the vaccine in this population. The current study HPV-025 EXT 013 was designed to extend the 
long-term follow-up (LTFU) for an additional six years and to provide follow-up data up to 
approximately 10 years after administration of the first HPV-16/18 vaccine dose in study HPV-013. 
All subjects from the HPV-16/18 vaccine ngroup in study HPV-013, who had received three doses 
of the HPV-16/18 vaccine, were included in the immunogenicity subset and participated in the FU 
study Ext HPV-013, were invited to the present study HPV-025 EXT 013. 
Previously, a long-term efficacy follow-up study in women aged 15-25 years at the time of first 
vaccination demonstrated high vaccine efficacy against incident and persistent HPV-16/18 
infections and their associated cervical lesions up to 9.4 years of follow-up.

2.  Assessment of the PAM EMEA-H-C-721-P46 
Overall study design - Description 
The primary study, HPV-013, was designed as follows: 
•  A total of 2067 healthy females were enrolled and randomised (1:1) in two parallel groups: 
•  HPV-16/18 L1 VLP (20 μg HPV-16 and 20 μg HPV-18) vaccine formulated with AS04 (N = 
1035), 
•  HAV Control vaccine (360 ELISA Unit [EL.U]/0.5 millilitre [mL] dose) (N = 1032). 
• 
•  Double-blinding was maintained up to Month 7. Thereafter up to Month 12, study 
Immunogenicity follow-up was for seven months, safety follow-up was for 12 months. 
investigators and subjects remained blinded to the study/control vaccine administered. 
The first follow-up study, Ext HPV-013, was designed as follows: 
•  A total of 1244 subjects who had received three doses of HPV vaccine in study HPV-013 
and who were included in the immunogenicity subset at study sites in Taiwan, Germany, 
Honduras, Panama and Colombia were enrolled such that: 
o  Up to the unblinding of study HPV-013, there were two parallel groups HPV-16/18 
vaccine group (N = 625) and control group (N = 619); 
o  After completion and unblinding of study HPV-013, the study was open-label and 
subjects in the HPV-16/18 vaccine group continued their participation until Month 
48. Subjects in the control group attended one further visit as study completion 
visit, i.e. Visit 7 (Month 18) or Visit 8 (Month 24), depending on the time of their 
enrolment. 
• 
Immunogenicity and safety follow-up was for 36 months (i.e. up to Month 48 after 
administration of the first vaccine dose).

In the current study, HPV-025 EXT-013, all subjects from the HPV-16/18 vaccine group in study 
HPV-013 who had received three doses of the HPV-16/18 vaccine, who were included in the 
immunogenicity subset and participated in study Ext HPV-013, were invited for an additional six 
years of follow-up. Subjects who did not participate at a particular persistence time point in study 
HPV-025 EXT-013 
were still eligible to be included/continue participation in the study at later time points. 
•  Blinding: Open-label. 
• 
Type of study: Extension of study HPV-013 and subsequent follow-up study (i.e. protocol 
numbers 104896 [Ext HPV-013 M18], 104902 [M24], 104904 [M36] and 104918 [M48]). 
•  Data collection: electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
•  Blood sampling: At each yearly visit, i.e. at Months 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 and 120. 
•  Safety monitoring during the entire study period: Serious adverse events (SAEs) were 
reported. 
•  Duration of the study: Approximately six years. 
• 
Total duration: Approximately 10 years from administration of the first HPV-16/18 vaccine 
dose in HPV-013 study. 
•  Analysis: Interim analyses were performed on a yearly basis (i.e. at Months 60, 72, 84, 96 
and 108). The final analysis was carried out on all data up to Month 120, i.e. up to 10 
years after administration of the first HPV-16/18 vaccine dose in study HPV-013. 
Subjects could be invited to participate in a booster vaccination study and/or parallel research 
studies to evaluate the HPV vaccine response. Such studies will be described in detail in separate 
study protocols and separate consents will be obtained.

• 
• 
• 
This study was conducted according to protocol amendment 1 (dated 02 December 2013) and the 
analysis was conducted according to the Statistical Analysis Plan with the following exceptions: 
The demographic parameter ‘region’ was not tabulated for each study cohort. 
The mean age (plus range and standard deviation [SD]) was not calculated per pre-
vaccination status 
The distribution of subjects enrolled among the study sites was not tabulated. 
The administration of concomitant medication was not tabulated.  
The assay used to measure anti-HPV-16/-18 antibody concentrations was improved to 
increase the assay precision by changing the assay cut-off value from 8 EL.U/mL to 19 
EL.U/mL for HPV-16 and from 7 EL.U/mL to 18 EL.U/mL for HPV-18. This change in the 
assay was implemented for the testing of samples from Year 8 (Month 96) onwards. 
The primary analysis of safety was based on the HPV-025 Total Vaccinated cohort (TVC) 
instead of the Month 120 TVC. Additional analyses were based on the Month 120 TVC for 
the follow-up period from Month 0 to Month 120 and from Month 108 to Month 120. 
The protocol defined interval between Dose 1 and Visit 6 (Month 120) (3569 Days - 3691 
Days) was considered for the analysis instead of an adapted interval. 
• 
• 
•  Analysis of pregnancies/pregnancy outcomes for data collected during the ten-year follow-
up period was performed on the HPV-025 TVC.

Immunogenicity: 
The primary analysis of immunogenicity was based on the Month 120 according-to-protocol (ATP) 
cohort for immunogenicity. A second analysis based on the Month 120 TVC was performed to 
complement the ATP analysis. 
For all subjects, at the time of this final analysis at Month 120: 
•  Seropositivity rates with exact 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for anti-HPV-
16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies. 
•  Geometric mean titres (GMTs) (with 95% CI and range) were tabulated for anti-HPV-16 
• 
and 
anti-HPV-18 antibodies. 
The distribution of anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody titres was displayed using 
reverse 
cumulative distribution curves (RCCs). 
•  A descriptive comparison with anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 serology results from efficacy 
studies (HPV-001/007) and anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibody titres after natural 
infection (study HPV-008) was performed. 
•  A descriptive comparison with anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 serology results at the end of 
the approximately 9.4-year follow-up in study HPV-001/007/023 was performed. 
Safety: 
The primary analysis of SAEs was based on the HPV-025 TVC. In addition, analyses on the Month 
120 TVC were performed on data collected during the entire ten-year follow-up period (Month 0 to 
Month 120) and for events reported between Month 108 and Month 120. 
• 
The proportion of subjects with at least one report of a SAE classified by the Medical 
Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), whenever available, was tabulated with exact 
95% CI throughout the study period. 
•  SAEs were described in detail and were further evaluated for their clinical relevance and 
• 
relationship to vaccination. 
The analysis of pregnancies/pregnancy outcomes was based on the HPV-025 TVC for data 
collected during the ten-year follow-up period. 
•  Withdrawal(s) due to adverse event(s)/SAE(s) were described in detail. 
The investigator, or his/her designee, was instructed to collect pregnancy information on any 
subject who became pregnant since the last visit in the previous study and until Month 120 of the 
current study HPV-025 EXT 013. The investigator, or his/her designee, was to record pregnancy 
information on the Pregnancy Report Form and submit it to GSK Biologicals within 24 hours of 
learning of a subject's pregnancy. The subject was followed up to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. At the end of the pregnancy, whether it was full-term or premature, information on the 
status of the mother and child was forwarded to GSK Biologicals. Generally, the follow-up was no 
longer than six to eight weeks following the estimated delivery date. 
While pregnancy itself was not considered an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective 
termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons was recorded as an AE or a SAE. A spontaneous 
abortion was always considered to be a SAE and had to be reported as such.

Immunogenicity results 
Ten years after the administration of three doses of the HPV-16/18 vaccine at the age of 10-14 
years (i.e. at Month 120), among subjects in the ATP cohort who were initially seronegative for the 
HPV type analysed at baseline, all subjects (i.e. 100% [95% CI: 99.1 - 100.0]) were still 
seropositive for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies. 
In initially seronegative subjects, the GMT values at Month 120 were 1589.9 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 
1459.8 - 1731.6] and 597.2 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 541.7 - 658.5] for HPV-16 and HPV-18, 
respectively. These values were 53.35-fold [95% CI: 47.38 - 60.07] and 26.31-fold [95% CI: 
23.58 - 29.35] higher, respectively, than those elicited after natural infection in 15-25 year old 
subjects in study HPV-008. 
The GMT values for HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies were 3.80-fold [95% CI: 3.11 - 4.64] and 2.46-
fold [95% CI: 1.97 - 3.08] higher, respectively, than those measured at the end of the 
approximately 9.4 year follow-up from subjects vaccinated at the age of 15-25 years in the study 
HPV-001/007/023, wherein the plateau level of vaccine-induced antibodies was associated with 
protection against HPV-16 and HPV-18 infection and/or associated cytological and histopathological 
lesions.

Safety results 
During the ten-year follow-up period (i.e. Month 0 to Month 120), a total of 99 out of 557 subjects 
(17.8%) who received three doses of HPV-16/18 vaccine in the primary study HPV-013 (i.e. the 
HPV-025 TVC) reported 155 SAEs, none of which were considered by the investigator to be causally 
related to vaccination. None of the subjects experienced a fatal SAE. 
Of the 161 pregnancies that occurred during the entire ten-year follow-up period, 134 pregnancies 
(83.2%) resulted in a live infant with no apparent congenital anomaly. Eleven pregnancies resulted 
in spontaneous abortion and five pregnancies were electively terminated. Five cases of congenital 
anomalies were reported. None of the spontaneous abortions and congenital anomalies were 
considered to be causally related to the study vaccine by the investigator.

Conclusions  
• 
• 
• 
The final report presents the results of the end of study analysis up to Month 120 (Year 
10). No confirmatory analyses were performed on the primary or secondary objectives. 
Ten years after the administration of three doses of the HPV-16/18 vaccine at the age of 
10-14 years, among subjects in the ATP cohort who were initially seronegative for the HPV 
type analysed at baseline, all of the subjects (100% [95% CI: 99.1 - 100.0]) were 
seropositive for HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies. The GMT values at Month 120 were 1589.9 
EL.U/mL [95% CI: 1459.8 - 1731.6] for HPV-16 and 597.2 EL.U/mL [95% CI: 541.7 - 
658.5] for HPV-18. 
The HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody titres detected ten years after vaccination in young 
adolescents aged 10-14 years were 3.80-fold and 2.46-fold higher, respectively, than the 
titres observed at the end of the approximately 9.4-year follow-up during the plateau 
phase in female subjects vaccinated at the age of 15-25 years at the time of vaccination in 
the HPV-001/007/023 study, wherein the plateau level of vaccine-induced antibodies was 
associated with protection against HPV-16 and HPV-18 infection and/or associated 
cytological and histopathological lesions. 
The HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody titres detected ten years after vaccination in young 
adolescents aged 10-14 years were 53.35-fold and 26.31-fold higher, respectively, than 
those elicited after natural infection in subjects aged 15-25 years who were seropositive 
but HPV-DNA negative for the HPV type analysed prior to the vaccination in study HPV-008. 
•  During the entire ten-year follow-up period, 99 subjects reported a total of 155 SAEs, none 
of which were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. None of 
the subjects experienced a fatal SAE. 
• 
•  During the entire ten-year follow-up period, a total of 161 pregnancies were reported, 134 
of which resulted in a live infant with no apparent congenital anomaly. 
In conclusion, the results from this analysis suggest that the HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine in 
female subjects aged 10-14 years induces sustained antibody responses several folds higher than 
those induced in subjects aged 15-25 years up to ten years after administration of the first dose, 
and 
exhibits an acceptable safety profile. 
CHMP comment 
The MAH discussion is generally endorsed. The results of this annual update report were in 
agreement with previous annual reports and are in line with expectations. Also, the MAH’s overall 
conclusions are endorsed and no further actions are required for this PAM at Month 120. No further 
regulatory action is considered necessary based on these results. A complete safety profile of this 
long term follow up is presented as expected and is including all subjects from the TVC that were 
originally selected for inclusion in HPV025 EXT-13.

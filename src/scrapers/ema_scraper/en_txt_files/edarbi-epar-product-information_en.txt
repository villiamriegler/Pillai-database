CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Edarbi is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension in adults. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended starting dose in adults is 40 mg once daily. The dose may be increased to a 
maximum of 80 mg once daily for patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled at the 
lower dose. 
Near-maximal antihypertensive effect is evident at 2 weeks, with maximal effects attained by 4 weeks. 
If blood pressure is not adequately controlled with Edarbi alone, additional blood pressure reduction 
can be achieved when this treatment is coadministered with other antihypertensive medicinal products, 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
including diuretics (such as chlortalidone and hydrochlorothiazide) and calcium channel blockers (see 
sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). 
Special populations 
Elderly (65 years and over) 
No initial dose adjustment with Edarbi is necessary in elderly patients (see section 5.2), although 
consideration can be given to 20 mg as a starting dose in the very elderly (≥ 75 years), who may be at 
risk of hypotension. 
Renal impairment 
Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal 
disease as there is no experience of use of Edarbi in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Haemodialysis does not remove azilsartan from the systemic circulation. 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
Edarbi has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore its use is not 
recommended in this patient group (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
As there is limited experience of use of Edarbi in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment 
close monitoring is recommended and consideration should be given to 20 mg as a starting dose (see 
section 5.2).  
Intravascular volume depletion 
For patients with possible depletion of intravascular volume or salt depletion (e.g. patients with 
vomiting, diarrhoea or taking high doses of diuretics), Edarbi should be initiated under close medical 
supervision and consideration can be given to 20 mg as a starting dose (see section 4.4). 
Black population 
No dose adjustment is required in the black population, although smaller reductions in blood pressure 
are observed compared with a non-black population (see section 5.1). This generally has been true for 
other angiotensin II receptor (AT1) antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. 
Consequently, uptitration of Edarbi and concomitant therapy may be needed more frequently for blood 
pressure control in black patients. 
Paediatric population 
Edarbi is not indicated for use in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. Currently available 
data in children or adolescents 6 to < 18 years of age are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made. The safety and efficacy of Edarbi in children < 6 years 
of age have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Edarbi is for oral use and may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
- Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
- Second and third trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
- The concomitant use of Edarbi with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients with 
diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2) (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) 
In patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of the RAAS 
(e.g. patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal impairment or renal artery stenosis), treatment 
with medicinal products that affect this system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists, has been associated with acute hypotension, 
azotaemia, oliguria or, rarely, acute renal failure. The possibility of similar effects cannot be excluded 
with Edarbi.  
Caution should be exercised in hypertensive patients with severe renal impairment, congestive heart 
failure or renal artery stenosis, as there is no experience of use of Edarbi in these patients (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
Excessive blood pressure decreases in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy or ischaemic 
cerebrovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. 
Dual blockade of the RAAS 
There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or 
aliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including 
acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin 
II receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  
If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist 
supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. 
ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with 
diabetic nephropathy. 
Kidney transplantation  
There is currently no experience on the use of Edarbi in patients who have recently undergone kidney 
transplantation. 
Hepatic impairment 
Edarbi has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and therefore its use is not 
recommended in this patient group (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Hypotension in volume- and /or salt-depleted patients 
In patients with marked volume- and/or salt-depletion (e.g. patients with vomiting, diarrhoea or taking 
high doses of diuretics) symptomatic hypotension could occur after initiation of treatment with Edarbi. 
Hypovolemia should be corrected prior to administration of Edarbi, or the treatment should start under 
close medical supervision, and consideration can be given to a starting dose of 20 mg. 
Primary hyperaldosteronism 
Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism generally will not respond to antihypertensive medicinal 
products acting through inhibition of the RAAS. Therefore, the use of Edarbi is not recommended in 
these patients. 
Hyperkalaemia 
Based on experience with the use of other medicinal products that affect the RAAS, concomitant use 
of Edarbi with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing 
potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to 
increases in serum potassium in hypertensive patients (see section 4.5). In the elderly, in patients with 
renal insufficiency, in diabetic patients and/or in patients with other co-morbidities, the risk of 
hyperkalaemia, which may be fatal, is increased. Monitoring of potassium should be undertaken as 
appropriate. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  
Special caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral valve stenosis, or hypertrophic 
obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). 
Pregnancy 
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless continued 
angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should 
be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use 
in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with angiotensin II receptor antagonists should 
be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 
and 4.6). 
Lithium 
As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists the combination of lithium and Edarbi is not 
recommended (see section 4.5). 
Edarbi contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use not recommended  
Lithium 
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concurrent use of lithium and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. A similar effect may occur 
with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Due to the lack of experience with concomitant use of 
azilsartan medoxomil and lithium, this combination is not recommended. If the combination proves 
necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. 
Caution required with concomitant use  
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic 
acid (> 3 g/day), and non-selective NSAIDs  
When angiotensin II receptor antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs (i.e. selective 
COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the 
antihypertensive effect may occur. Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II receptor 
antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase 
in serum potassium. Therefore, adequate hydration and monitoring of renal function at the beginning 
of the treatment are recommended. 
Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other 
substances that may increase potassium levels  
Concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing 
potassium, or other medicinal products (e.g. heparin) may increase potassium levels. Monitoring of 
serum potassium should be undertaken as appropriate (see section 4.4). 
Additional information  
Clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of 
ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of 
adverse events such as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute 
renal failure) compared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No clinically significant interactions have been reported in studies of azilsartan medoxomil or 
azilsartan given with amlodipine, antacids, chlortalidone, digoxin, fluconazole, glyburide, 
ketoconazole, metformin, and warfarin. Following administration with a mixture of cytochrome P450 
(CYP) probe substrates, no clinically significant drug interactions were observed with caffeine 
(CYP1A2), tolbutamide (CYP2C9), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), or midazolam (CYP3A4). 
Azilsartan medoxomil is rapidly hydrolysed to the active moiety azilsartan by esterases in the 
gastrointestinal tract and/or during drug absorption (see section 5.2). In vitro studies indicated that 
interactions based on esterase inhibition are unlikely. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is not recommended during the first trimester of 
pregnancy (see section 4.4).  
The use of angiotensin II receptor antagonists is contraindicated during the second and third trimester 
of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
There are no data from the use of azilsartan medoxomil in pregnant women. Studies in animals have 
shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however, 
a small increase in risk cannot be excluded. Whilst there are no controlled epidemiological data on the 
risk with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, similar risks may exist for this class of medicinal 
products. Unless continued angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy is considered essential, patients 
planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative anti-hypertensive treatments which have an 
established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with 
angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be stopped immediately and, if appropriate, alternative 
therapy should be started. 
Exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy during the second and third trimesters is known 
to induce human fetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification 
retardation) and neonatal toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3). 
Should exposure to angiotensin II receptor antagonists have occurred from the second trimester of 
pregnancy, ultrasound check of renal function and skull is recommended. 
Infants whose mothers have taken Angiotensin II receptor antagonists should be closely observed for 
hypotension (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). 
Breast-feeding  
Because no information is available regarding the use of azilsartan medoxomil during breastfeeding, 
Edarbi is not recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during 
breastfeeding are preferable, especially while breast-feeding a newborn or preterm infant. 
Fertility 
No data are available on the effect of azilsartan medoxomil on human fertility. Nonclinical studies 
demonstrated that azilsartan did not appear to affect male or female fertility in the rat (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Azilsartan medoxomil has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
However it should be taken into account that occasionally dizziness or tiredness may occur.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Edarbi at doses of 20, 40 or 80 mg has been evaluated for safety in clinical studies in adult patients 
treated for up to 56 weeks. In these clinical studies, adverse reactions associated with treatment with 
Edarbi were mostly mild or moderate, with an overall incidence similar to placebo. The most common 
adverse reaction was dizziness. The incidence of adverse reactions with this treatment was not affected 
by gender, age, or race. Adverse reactions were reported at a similar frequency for the Edarbi 20 mg 
dose as with the 40 and 80 mg doses in one placebo controlled study. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions based on pooled data (40 and 80 mg doses) are listed below according to system 
organ class and preferred terms. These are ranked by frequency, using the following convention: very 
common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); 
rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), including isolated reports. Within each 
frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
When Edarbi was coadministered with chlortalidone, the frequencies of blood creatinine increased and 
hypotension were increased from uncommon to common. 
When Edarbi was coadministered with amlodipine, the frequency of peripheral oedema was increased 
from uncommon to common, but was lower than amlodipine alone. 
Investigations 
Serum creatinine 
The incidence of elevations in serum creatinine following treatment with Edarbi was similar to 
placebo in the randomised placebo-controlled monotherapy studies. Coadministration of Edarbi with 
diuretics, such as chlortalidone, resulted in a greater incidence of creatinine elevations, an observation 
consistent with that of other angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitors. The elevations in serum creatinine during coadministration of Edarbi with diuretics were 
associated with larger blood pressure reductions compared with a single medicinal product. Many of 
these elevations were transient or nonprogressive while subjects continued to receive treatment. 
Following discontinuation of treatment, the majority of the elevations that had not resolved during 
treatment were reversible, with the creatinine levels of most subjects returning to baseline or near-
baseline values. 
Uric acid  
Small mean increases of serum uric acid were observed with Edarbi (10.8 µmol/l) compared with 
placebo (4.3 µmol/l). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Haemoglobin and haematocrit 
Small decreases in haemoglobin and haematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 3 g/l and 
1 volume percent, respectively) were observed in placebo-controlled monotherapy studies. This effect 
is also seen with other inhibitors of the RAAS. 
Paediatric population 
A clinical study on the safety and efficacy of Edarbi in children and adolescents 6 to < 18 years of age 
was conducted (see section 5.1). The overall safety profile of Edarbi in the paediatric population was 
consistent with the known safety profile in adults. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Based on pharmacological considerations, the main manifestation of an overdose is likely to be 
symptomatic hypotension and dizziness. During controlled clinical studies in healthy adult subjects, 
once daily doses up to 320 mg of azilsartan medoxomil were administered for 7 days and were well 
tolerated. 
Management 
If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted and vital signs 
monitored. 
Azilsartan is not removed by dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II antagonists, 
plain, ATC Code: C09CA09. 
Mechanism of action 
Azilsartan medoxomil is an orally active prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active moiety, 
azilsartan, which selectively antagonises the effects of angiotensin II by blocking its binding to the 
AT1 receptor in multiple tissues (see section 5.2). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the 
RAAS, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, 
cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. 
Blockade of the AT1 receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin 
secretion, but the resulting increases in plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do 
not overcome the antihypertensive effect of azilsartan. 
Essential hypertension 
In seven double blind controlled studies, a total of 5,941 adult patients (3,672 given Edarbi, 801 given 
placebo, and 1,468 given active comparator) were evaluated. Overall, 51% of patients were male and 
26% were 65 years or older (5% ≥ 75 years); 67% were white and 19% were black.  
Edarbi was compared with placebo and active comparators in two 6 week randomised, double blind 
studies. Blood pressure reductions compared with placebo based on 24 hour mean blood pressure by 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and clinic blood pressure measurements at trough are 
shown in the table below for both studies. Additionally, Edarbi 80 mg resulted in significantly greater 
reductions in SBP than the highest approved doses of olmesartan medoxomil and valsartan.

analysis 
# Maximum dose achieved in study 2. Doses were force-titrated at Week 2 from 20 to 40 mg 
and 40 to 80 mg for Edarbi, and 20 to 40 mg and 160 to 320 mg, respectively, for olmesartan 
medoxomil and valsartan  
In these two studies, clinically important and most common adverse events included dizziness, 
headache and dyslipidemia. For Edarbi, olmesartan medoxomil and valsartan, respectively dizziness 
was observed at an incidence of 3.0%, 3.3% and 1.8%; headache at 4.8%, 5.5% and 7.6% and 
dyslipidemia at 3.5%, 2.4% and 1.1%. 
In active-comparator studies with either valsartan or ramipril, the blood-pressure-lowering effect with 
Edarbi was sustained during long-term treatment. Edarbi had a lower incidence of cough (1.2%) 
compared with ramipril (8.2%). 
The antihypertensive effect of azilsartan medoxomil occurred within the first 2 weeks of dosing with 
the full effect achieved by 4 weeks. The blood pressure lowering effect of azilsartan medoxomil was 
also maintained throughout the 24 hour dosing interval. The placebo-corrected trough-to-peak ratios 
for SBP and DBP were approximately 80% or higher. 
Rebound hypertension was not observed following abrupt cessation of Edarbi therapy after 6 months 
of treatment. 
No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger 
patients, but greater sensitivity to blood pressure lowering effects in some elderly individuals cannot 
be ruled out (see section 4.2). As with other angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors the antihypertensive effect was lower in black patients (usually a low-
renin population). 
Coadministration of Edarbi 40 and 80 mg with a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) or a thiazide-
type diuretic (chlortalidone) resulted in additional blood pressure reductions compared with the other 
antihypertensive alone. Dose dependent adverse events including dizziness, hypotension and serum 
creatinine elevations were more frequent with diuretic coadministration compared with Edarbi alone, 
while hypokalemia was less frequent compared with diuretic alone. 
Beneficial effects of Edarbi on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and target organ damage are 
currently unknown. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Effect on cardiac repolarisation 
A thorough QT/QTc study was conducted to assess the potential of azilsartan medoxomil to prolong 
the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects. There was no evidence of QT/QTc prolongation at a dose of 
320 mg of azilsartan medoxomil. 
Additional information 
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET (ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in 
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and VA NEPHRON-D (The Veterans Affairs 
Nephropathy in Diabetes)) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE-inhibitor with an 
angiotensin II receptor blocker. 
ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. 
VA NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy. 
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and 
mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as 
compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these 
results are also relevant for other ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. 
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should therefore not be used concomitantly in 
patients with diabetic nephropathy. 
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) 
was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE inhibitor 
or an angiotensin II receptor blocker in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney 
disease, cardiovascular disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk 
of adverse outcomes. Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the 
aliskiren group than in the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest 
(hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren 
group than in the placebo group. 
Paediatric population 
The antihypertensive effects of azilsartan medoxomil were evaluated in a Phase 3 randomised, 
double-blind study in children or adolescents 6 to < 18 years of age with primary or secondary 
hypertension. This study involved a 6-week, double-blind, randomised treatment phase (DB Phase), 
followed by a 2-week, double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled withdrawal phase (WD Phase). In 
the DB Phase, subjects were randomised (1:1:1:1) to the following groups: azilsartan medoxomil 
10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg/80 mg (based on subject body weight), or losartan. All patients started at the 
10 mg treatment for 2 weeks; subsequently, patients either continued at 10 mg or were up-titrated to 
20, 40, or 80 mg. In the WD Phase, subjects were randomised (1:1) to continue taking their previously 
assigned active treatment or were switched to placebo. This study also included a 44-week, open-label 
extension (OL Phase), in which all subjects received azilsartan medoxomil or azilsartan medoxomil 
and other antihypertensive medications as needed in a titrate-to-target blood pressure dosing 
algorithm, starting at 10 mg azilsartan medoxomil. 
In the 6-week DB Phase, 162 subjects were exposed to azilsartan medoxomil. In the 2-week 
WD Phase, 77 subjects were exposed to azilsartan medoxomil and 103 subjects were exposed to 
placebo. In the 44-week OL Phase, 156 subjects were exposed to azilsartan medoxomil alone and 
41 subjects were exposed to azilsartan medoxomil and other antihypertensives. 
In the 2-week withdrawal period, there was a loss of blood pressure control in subjects randomised to 
placebo, while subjects who remained on azilsartan medoxomil treatment had stable blood pressure 
control. The difference in mean seated diastolic blood pressure change from Week 6 to Week 8 in the 
subjects treated with azilsartan medoxomil versus placebo was -5.42 mmHg (95% CI, -7.29 to -
3.55 mmHg; p < 0.001). Percentage of subjects who achieved target blood pressure (defined as < 90th 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
percentile for age, gender, and height) at Week 8 (week 2 of the withdrawal period) was significantly 
higher with azilsartan medoxomil treatment compared with placebo. Subjects who were treated with 
azilsartan medoxomil (all doses pooled) had a statistically significantly greater change in mean seated 
DBP from baseline to Week 6 compared with losartan-treated subjects. The effect of azilsartan 
medoxomil remained consistent over time during the open-label phase. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following oral administration, azilsartan medoxomil is rapidly hydrolyzed to the active moiety 
azilsartan in the gastrointestinal tract and/or during absorption. Based on in vitro studies, 
carboxymethylenebutenolidase is involved in the hydrolysis in the intestine and liver. In addition, 
plasma esterases are involved in the hydrolysis of azilsartan medoxomil to azilsartan. 
Absorption 
The estimated absolute oral bioavailability of azilsartan medoxomil based on plasma levels of 
azilsartan is approximately 60%. After oral administration of azilsartan medoxomil, peak plasma 
concentrations (Cmax) of azilsartan are reached within 1.5 to 3 hours. Food does not affect the 
bioavailability of azilsartan (see section 4.2). 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of azilsartan is approximately 16 litres. Azilsartan is highly bound to 
plasma proteins (> 99%), mainly serum albumin. Protein binding is constant at azilsartan plasma 
concentrations well above the range achieved with recommended doses. 
Biotransformation 
Azilsartan is metabolised to two primary metabolites. The major metabolite in plasma is formed by O-
dealkylation, referred to as metabolite M-II, and the minor metabolite is formed by decarboxylation, 
referred to as metabolite M-I. Systemic exposures to the major and minor metabolites in humans were 
approximately 50% and less than 1% that of azilsartan, respectively. M-I and M-II do not contribute to 
the pharmacologic activity of azilsartan medoxomil. The major enzyme responsible for azilsartan 
metabolism is CYP2C9. 
Elimination 
Following an oral dose of 14C-labelled azilsartan medoxomil, approximately 55% of radioactivity was 
recovered in faeces and approximately 42% in urine, with 15% of the dose excreted in urine as 
azilsartan. The elimination half-life of azilsartan is approximately 11 hours and renal clearance is 
approximately 2.3 ml/min. Steady-state levels of azilsartan are achieved within 5 days and no 
accumulation in plasma occurs with repeated once-daily dosing. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Dose proportionality in exposure was established for azilsartan in the azilsartan medoxomil dose range 
of 20 mg to 320 mg after single or multiple dosing. 
Characteristics in specific groups of patients 
Paediatric population 
The population pharmacokinetics of azilsartan following oral doses of azilsartan medoxomil were 
evaluated in hypertensive children aged 6 to < 18 years in a single dose study as well as in a multiple 
dose study of 10 mg to a maximum of 80 mg for 6 weeks. Generally, a dose proportional increase of 
the maximum concentration (Cmax,ss) and exposure (AUCss) of azilsartan was observed. Exposure of 
azilsartan was dependent on body weight, generally a higher exposure was observed for paediatric 
patients weighing ≤ 50 kg compared to those weighing > 50 kg. The azilsartan exposure was similar 
between children and adults when allometric scaling was applied. 
Older people 
Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between young (age range 18-45 years) and 
elderly (age range 65-85 years) patients. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
In patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment azilsartan total exposure (AUC) was 
+30%, +25% and +95% increased. No increase (+5%) was observed in end-stage renal disease 
patients who were dialysed. However, there is no clinical experience in patients with severe renal 
impairment or end stage renal disease (see section 4.2). Haemodialysis does not remove azilsartan 
from the systemic circulation. 
Hepatic impairment 
Administration of Edarbi for up to 5 days in subjects with mild (Child-Pugh A) or moderate 
(Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment resulted in slight increase in azilsartan exposure (AUC increased 
by 1.3 to 1.6 fold, see section 4.2). Edarbi has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. 
Gender 
Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between males and females. No dose 
adjustment is necessary based on gender. 
Race 
Pharmacokinetics of azilsartan do not differ significantly between black and white populations. No 
dose adjustment is necessary based on race. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In preclinical safety studies, azilsartan medoxomil and M-II, the major human metabolite, were 
examined for repeated-dose toxicity, reproduction toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. 
In the repeated-dose toxicity studies, doses producing exposure comparable to that in the clinical 
therapeutic range caused reduced red cell parameters, changes in the kidney and renal 
haemodynamics, as well as increased serum potassium in normotensive animals. These effects, which 
were prevented by oral saline supplementation, do not have clinical significance in treatment of 
hypertension. 
In rats and dogs, increased plasma renin activity and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the renal 
juxtaglomerular cells were observed. These changes, also a class effect of angiotensin converting 
enzyme inhibitors and other angiotensin II receptor antagonists, do not appear to have clinical 
significance. 
Azilsartan and M-II crossed the placenta and were found in the fetuses of pregnant rats and were 
excreted into the milk of lactating rats. In the reproduction toxicity studies, there were no effects on 
male or female fertility. There is no evidence of a teratogenic effect, but animal studies indicated some 
hazardous potential to the postnatal development of the offspring such as lower body weight, a slight 
delay in physical development (delayed incisor eruption, pinna detachment, eye opening), and higher 
mortality. 
Azilsartan and M-II showed no evidence of mutagenicity and relevant clastogenic activity in in vitro 
studies and no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats and mice. 
Juvenile animal studies 
Juvenile oral toxicity studies up to 3 months in duration in rats (2 or 3 weeks old) with azilsartan 
medoxomil, alone or in combination with M-II, showed that juvenile rats may be more susceptible to 
angiotensin-related altered renal morphology and function when exposed from postnatal week 2, 
corresponding with the period of growth and maturation of the renal system. The growth and 
maturation stage of the human renal system extends to about 2 years of age.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Edarbi is and what it is used for 
Edarbi contains an active substance called azilsartan medoxomil and belongs to a class of medicines 
called angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs). Angiotensin II is a substance which occurs 
naturally in the body and which causes the blood vessels to tighten, therefore increasing your blood 
pressure. Edarbi blocks this effect so that the blood vessels relax, which helps lower your blood 
pressure. 
This medicine is used for treating high blood pressure (essential hypertension) in adult patients (over 
18 years of age). 
A reduction in your blood pressure will be measureable within 2 weeks of initiation of treatment and 
the full effect of your dose will be observed by 4 weeks. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Edarbi 
Do NOT take Edarbi if you  
- 
are allergic to azilsartan medoxomil or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
are more than 3 months pregnant. (It is also better to avoid this medicine in early 
pregnancy - see pregnancy section). 
have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure lowering 
medicine containing aliskiren. 
- 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor before taking Edarbi, especially if you 
- 
- 
- 
- 
have kidney problems. 
are on dialysis or had a recent kidney transplant. 
have severe liver disease. 
have heart problems (including heart failure, recent heart attack). 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
have ever had a stroke. 
have low blood pressure or feel dizzy or lightheaded. 
are vomiting, have recently had severe vomiting, or have diarrhoea. 
have raised levels of potassium in your blood (as shown in blood tests). 
have a disease of the adrenal gland called primary hyperaldosteronism. 
have been told that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “aortic or mitral 
valve stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called 
“obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”). 
are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure: 
o  an ACE-inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril), in particular if you have 
diabetes-related kidney problems. 
o  aliskiren. 
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals. 
See also information under the heading “Do not take Edarbi”. 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Edarbi is not 
recommended in early pregnancy, and must NOT be taken if you are more than 3 months pregnant, as 
it may cause serious harm to your baby if used at that stage (see section "Pregnancy section and breast-
feeding"). Edarbi may be less effective in lowering the blood pressure in black patients. 
Children and adolescents 
There is limited data on the use of Edarbi in children or adolescents under 18 years of age. Therefore, 
this medicine should not be given to children or adolescents. 
Other medicines and Edarbi 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Edarbi can affect the way some other medicines work and some medicines can have an effect on 
Edarbi. 
In particular, tell your doctor if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
- 
- 
Lithium (a medicine for mental health problems) 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, diclofenac or celecoxib 
(medicines to relieve pain and inflammation) 
Acetylsalicyclic acid if taking more than 3 g per day (medicine to relieve pain and 
inflammation) 
Medicines that increase the amount of potassium in your blood; these include potassium 
supplements, potassium-sparing medicines (certain ‘water tablets’) or salt substitutes containing 
potassium 
Heparin (a medicine for thinning the blood) 
Diuretics (water tablets) 
Aliskiren or other medicines to lower your blood pressure (angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, such as enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril or valsartan, 
telmisartan, irbesartan). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions if you are taking an 
ACE-inhibitor or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take Edarbi” and 
“Warnings and precautions”). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Pregnancy 
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking this medicine before you become pregnant or as soon as you know you are 
pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Edarbi. 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Edarbi is not recommended in early pregnancy, and must NOT be taken when more than 3 months

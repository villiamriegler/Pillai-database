STEPS TAKEN AFTER GRANTING THE MARKETING AUTHORISATION 
For procedures finalised after 1 July 2004 please refer to module 8B 
On  30  April  1996  the  European  Commission  issued  a  marketing  authorisation  valid  throughout  the 
European Union for the medicinal product Humalog. This decision was based on the assessment report 
and on the favourable opinion adopted by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) 
on 22 November 1995 for Humalog. Table N°1 summarise subsequent post Marketing Authorisation 
applications for Humalog issued by Commission Decision until 18 April 2001. 
The company Eli Lilly B.V. Nederland submitted to the EMEA an application to extend the marketing 
authorisation,  concerning  Humalog  (100  U/ml)  3.0  ml  cartridge  and  Humalog-HumaJect  (100U/ml) 
3.0 ml cartridge in a disposable pen. The CPMP issued on 20 November 1996 a positive opinion for 
granting the marketing authorisation to Humalog 3.0 ml cartridge and to Humalog-HumaJect 3.0 ml 
cartridge  in  a  disposable  pen.  Table  N°2  summarise  subsequent  post  Marketing  Authorisation 
applications for Humalog-HumaJect issued by Commission Decision until 18 April 2001. 
Eli Lilly B.V. Nederland submitted to the EMEA an application to extend the marketing authorisation 
for Humalog-HumaPen (100U/ml) 3.0 ml cartridge in a disposable pen. The CPMP issued a positive 
opinion  for  granting  the  marketing  authorisation  on  18  February  1997.  Table  N°3  summarise 
subsequent post Marketing Authorisation applications for Humalog-HumaPen issued by Commission 
Decision until 18 April 2001. 
During  the  variation  EMEA/H/C/0088/II/23  for  Humalog  the  MAH  requested  to  combine  all  17 
insulin  lispro  presentations  of  the  Humalog, Humalog-HumaJect and Humalog Pen licences into the 
one  core  Humalog  licence  (EU/1/96/007).  Table  N°4  summarise  subsequent  post  Marketing 
Authorisation applications for all Humalog, Humalog-HumaJect and Humalog Pen licences.

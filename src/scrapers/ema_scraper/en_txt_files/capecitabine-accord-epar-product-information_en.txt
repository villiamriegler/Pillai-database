4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Capecitabine Accord should only be prescribed by a qualified physician experienced in the utilisation 
of anti-neoplastic medicinal products. Careful monitoring during the first cycle of treatment is 
recommended for all patients. 
Treatment should be discontinued if progressive disease or intolerable toxicity is observed. Standard 
and reduced dose calculations according to body surface area for starting doses of Capecitabine 
Accord of 1250 mg/m2 and 1000 mg/m2 are provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. 
Posology 
Recommended posology (see section 5.1) 
Monotherapy 
Colon, colorectal and breast cancer 
Given as monotherapy, the recommended starting dose for capecitabine in the adjuvant treatment of 
colon cancer, in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer or of locally advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer is 1250 mg/m2 administered twice daily (morning and evening; equivalent to 
2500 mg/m2 total daily dose) for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period. Adjuvant treatment in 
patients with stage III colon cancer is recommended for a total of 6 months. 
Combination therapy 
Colon, colorectal and gastric cancer 
In combination treatment, the recommended starting dose of capecitabine should be reduced to 
800-1000 mg/m2 when administered twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period, or to 
625 mg/m2 twice daily when administered continuously (see section 5.1). For combination with 
irinotecan, the recommended starting dose is 800 mg/m2 when administered twice daily for 14 days 
followed by a 7-day rest period combined with irinotecan 200 mg/m2 on day 1. The inclusion of 
bevacizumab in a combination regimen has no effect on the starting dose of capecitabine. 
Premedication to maintain adequate hydration and anti-emesis according to the cisplatin summary of 
product characteristics should be started prior to cisplatin administration for patients receiving the 
capecitabine plus cisplatin combination. Premedication with antiemetics according to the oxaliplatin 
summary of product characteristics is recommended for patients receiving the capecitabine plus 
oxaliplatin combination. 
Adjuvant treatment in patients with stage III colon cancer is recommended for a duration of 6 months. 
Breast cancer 
In combination with docetaxel, the recommended starting dose of capecitabine in the treatment of 
metastatic breast cancer is 1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days followed by a 7-day rest period, 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
combined with docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. Premedication 
with an oral corticosteroid such as dexamethasone according to the docetaxel summary of product 
characteristics should be started prior to docetaxel administration for patients receiving the 
capecitabine plus docetaxel combination.

Toxicity due to capecitabine administration may be managed by symptomatic treatment and/or 
modification of the dose (treatment interruption or dose reduction). Once the dose has been reduced, it 
should not be increased at a later time. For those toxicities considered by the treating physician to be 
unlikely to become serious or life-threatening, e.g. alopecia, altered taste, nail changes, treatment can 
be continued at the same dose without reduction or interruption. Patients taking capecitabine should be 
informed of the need to interrupt treatment immediately if moderate or severe toxicity occurs. Doses 
of capecitabine omitted for toxicity are not replaced. The following are the recommended dose 
modifications for toxicity:

*According to the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trial Group (NCIC CTG) Common 
Toxicity Criteria (version 1) or the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of 
the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, US National Cancer Institute, version 4.0. For hand-foot 
syndrome and hyperbilirubinemia, see section 4.4. 
Haematology 
Patients with baseline neutrophil counts of <1.5 x 109/L and/or thrombocyte counts of <100 x 109/L 
should not be treated with capecitabine. If unscheduled laboratory assessments during a treatment 
cycle show that the neutrophil count drops below 1.0 x 109/L or that the platelet count drops below 
75 x 109/L, treatment with capecitabine should be interrupted. 
Dose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used as a 3 weekly cycle in combination with 
other medicinal products 
Dose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used as a 3 weekly cycle in combination with 
other medicinal products should be made according to Table 3 above for capecitabine and according to 
the appropriate summary of product characteristics for the other medicinal product(s). 
At the beginning of a treatment cycle, if a treatment delay is indicated for either capecitabine or the 
other medicinal product(s), then administration of all therapy should be delayed until the requirements 
for restarting all medicinal products are met. 
During a treatment cycle for those toxicities considered by the treating physician not to be related to 
capecitabine, capecitabine should be continued and the dose of the other medicinal product should be 
adjusted according to the appropriate Prescribing Information. 
If the other medicinal product(s) have to be discontinued permanently, capecitabine treatment can be 
resumed when the requirements for restarting capecitabine are met. 
This advice is applicable to all indications and to all special populations. 
Dose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used continuously in combination with other 
medicinal products 
Dose modifications for toxicity when capecitabine is used continuously in combination with other 
medicinal products should be made according to Table 3 above for capecitabine and according to the 
appropriate summary of product characteristics for the other medicinal product(s). 
Posology adjustments for special populations 
Hepatic impairment  
Insufficient safety and efficacy data are available in patients with hepatic impairment to provide a dose 
adjustment recommendation. No information is available on hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis or 
hepatitis. 
Renal impairment 
Capecitabine is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 
30 ml/min [Cockcroft and Gault] at baseline). The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in 
patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min at baseline) is increased 
compared to the overall population. In patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline, a dose 
reduction to 75% for a starting dose of 1250 mg/m2 is recommended. In patients with moderate renal 
impairment at baseline, no dose reduction is required for a starting dose of 1000 mg/m2. In patients 
with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 51-80 ml/min at baseline) no adjustment of the 
starting dose is recommended. Careful monitoring and prompt treatment interruption is recommended 
if the patient develops a grade 2, 3 or 4 adverse event during treatment and subsequent dose 
adjustment as outlined in Table 3 above. If the calculated creatinine clearance decreases during 
treatment to a value below 30 ml/min, Capecitabine Accord should be discontinued. These dose 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adjustment recommendations for renal impairment apply both to monotherapy and combination use 
(see also section “Elderly” below). 
Elderly 
During capecitabine monotherapy, no adjustment of the starting dose is needed. However, grade 3 or 
4 treatment-related adverse reactions were more frequent in patients ≥60 years of age compared to 
younger patients. 
When capecitabine was used in combination with other medicinal products, elderly patients 
(≥65 years) experienced more grade 3 and grade 4 adverse drug reactions, including those leading to 
discontinuation, compared to younger patients. Careful monitoring of patients ≥60 years of age is 
advisable. 
- 
In combination with docetaxel: an increased incidence of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse 
reactions and treatment-related serious adverse reactions were observed in patients 60 years of 
age or more (see section 5.1). For patients 60 years of age or more, a starting dose reduction of 
capecitabine to 75% (950 mg/m2 twice daily) is recommended. If no toxicity is observed in 
patients ≥60 years of age treated with a reduced capecitabine starting dose in combination with 
docetaxel, the dose of capecitabine may be cautiously escalated to 1250 mg/m2 twice daily.  
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of capecitabine in the paediatric population in the indications colon, 
colorectal, gastric and breast cancer. 
Method of administration 
Capecitabine Accord tablets should be swallowed whole with water within 30 minutes after a meal. 
Capecitabine Accord tablets should not be crushed or cut. 
4.3  Contraindications 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
History of severe and unexpected reactions to fluoropyrimidine therapy, 
Hypersensitivity to capecitabine or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or fluorouracil, 
Known complete dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency (see section 4.4).During 
pregnancy and lactation, 
In patients with severe leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia, 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, 
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min), 
Recent or concomitant treatment with brivudine (see section 4.4 and 4.5 for drug-drug 
interaction),If contraindications exist to any of the medicinal products in the combination 
regimen, that medicinal product should not be used. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Dose limiting toxicities  
Dose limiting toxicities include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome 
(hand-foot skin reaction, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia). Most adverse reactions are reversible and 
do not require permanent discontinuation of therapy, although doses may need to be withheld or 
reduced. 
Diarrhoea  
Patients with severe diarrhoea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte 
replacement if they become dehydrated. Standard antidiarrhoeal treatments (e.g. loperamide) may be 
used. NCIC CTC grade 2 diarrhoea is defined as an increase of 4 to 6 stools/day or nocturnal stools, 
grade 3 diarrhoea as an increase of 7 to 9 stools/day or incontinence and malabsorption. Grade 4 
diarrhoea is an increase of ≥10 stools/day or grossly bloody diarrhoea or the need for parenteral 
support. Dose reduction should be applied as necessary (see section 4.2). 
Dehydration 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dehydration should be prevented or corrected at the onset. Patients with anorexia, asthenia, nausea, 
vomiting or diarrhoea may rapidly become dehydrated. Dehydration may cause acute renal failure, 
especially in patients with pre-existing compromised renal function or when capecitabine is given 
concomitantly with known nephrotoxic drugs.  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration might be 
potentially fatal. If grade 2 (or higher) dehydration occurs, capecitabine treatment should be 
immediately interrupted and the dehydration corrected. Treatment should not be restarted until the 
patient is rehydrated and any precipitating causes have been corrected or controlled. Dose 
modifications applied should be applied for the precipitating adverse event as necessary (see section 
4.2). 
Hand-foot syndrome 
Hand and foot syndrome also known as hand-foot skin reaction or palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
or chemotherapy induced acral erythema. 
Grade 1 hand-foot syndrome is defined as numbness, dysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, painless 
swelling or erythema of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort which does not disrupt the patient’s 
normal activities. 
Grade 2 hand-foot syndrome is painful erythema and swelling of the hands and/or feet and/or 
discomfort affecting the patient’s activities of daily living. 
Grade 3 hand-foot syndrome is moist desquamation, ulceration, blistering and severe pain of the hands 
and/or feet and/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities 
of daily living. Persistent or severe hand-foot syndrome (Grade 2 and above) can eventually lead to 
loss of fingerprints which could impact patient identification. If grade 2 or 3 hand-foot syndrome 
occurs, administration of capecitabine should be interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in 
intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, subsequent doses of capecitabine should 
be decreased. When capecitabine and cisplatin are used in combination, the use of vitamin B6 
(pyridoxine) is not advised for symptomatic or secondary prophylactic treatment of hand-foot 
syndrome, because of published reports that it may decrease the efficacy of cisplatin. There is some 
evidence that dexpanthenol is effective for hand-foot syndrome prophylaxis in patients treated with 
Capecitabine Accord. 
Cardiotoxicity  
Cardiotoxicity has been associated with fluoropyrimidine therapy, including myocardial infarction, 
angina, dysrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, sudden death and electrocardiographic changes (including 
very rare cases of QT prolongation). These adverse reactions may be more common in patients with a 
prior history of coronary artery disease. Cardiac arrhythmias (including ventricular fibrillation, torsade 
de pointes, and bradycardia), angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure and cardiomyopathy 
have been reported in patients receiving capecitabine.  
Caution must be exercised in patients with history of significant cardiac disease, arrhythmias and 
angina pectoris (see section 4.8). 
Hypo- or hypercalcaemia 
Hypo- or hypercalcaemia has been reported during capecitabine treatment. Caution must be exercised 
in patients with pre-existing hypo- or hypercalcaemia (see section 4.8). 
Central or peripheral nervous system disease 
Caution must be exercised in patients with central or peripheral nervous system disease, e.g. brain 
metastasis or neuropathy (see section 4.8). 
Diabetes mellitus or electrolyte disturbances  
Caution must be exercised in patients with diabetes mellitus or electrolyte disturbances, as these may 
be aggravated during capecitabine treatment. 
Coumarin-derivative anticoagulation  
In a interaction study with single-dose warfarin administration, there was a significant increase in the 
mean AUC (+57%) of S-warfarin. These results suggest an interaction, probably due to an inhibition 
of the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system by capecitabine. Patients receiving concomitant 
capecitabine and oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulant therapy should have their anticoagulant 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
response (INR or prothrombin time) monitored closely and the anticoagulant dose adjusted 
accordingly (see section 4.5). 
Brivudine. Brivudine must not be administered concomitantly with capecitabine. Fatal cases have been 
reported following this drug interaction. There must be at least a 4-week waiting period between end 
of treatment with brivudine and start of capecitabine therapy. Treatment with brivudine can be started 
24 hours after the last dose of capecitabine (see section 4.3 and 4.5). In the event of accidental 
administration of brivudine to patients being treated with capecitabine, effective measures should be 
taken to reduce the toxicity of capecitabine. Immediate admission to hospital is recommended. All 
measures should be initiated to prevent systemic infections and dehydration. 
Hepatic impairment 
In the absence of safety and efficacy data in patients with hepatic impairment, capecitabine use should 
be carefully monitored in patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction, regardless of the presence 
or absence of liver metastasis. Administration of capecitabine should be interrupted if treatment-
related elevations in bilirubin of >3.0 x ULN or treatment-related elevations in hepatic 
aminotransferases (ALT, AST) of >2.5 x ULN occur. Treatment with capecitabine monotherapy may 
be resumed when bilirubin decreases to ≤3.0 x ULN or hepatic aminotransferases decrease to ≤ 2.5 x 
ULN. 
Renal impairment  
The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance 30-50 ml/min) is increased compared to the overall population (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). 
Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency: 
DPD activity is rate limiting in the catabolism of 5-fluorouracil (see Section 5.2). Patients with DPD 
deficiency are therefore at increased risk of fluoropyrimidines-related toxicity, including for example 
stomatitis, diarrhoea, mucosal inflammation, neutropenia and neurotoxicity. 
DPD-deficiency related toxicity usually occurs during the first cycle of treatment or after dose 
increase. 
Complete DPD deficiency 
Complete DPD deficiency is rare (0.01-0.5% of Caucasians). Patients with complete DPD deficiency 
are at high risk of life-threatening or fatal toxicity and must not be treated with Capecitabine Accord 
(see section 4.3).  
Partial DPD deficiency 
Partial DPD deficiency is estimated to affect 3-9% of the Caucasian population. Patients with partial 
DPD deficiency are at increased risk of severe and potentially life-threatening toxicity. A reduced 
starting dose should be considered to limit this toxicity. DPD deficiency should be considered as a 
parameter to be taken into account in conjunction with other routine measures for dose reduction. 
Initial dose reduction may impact the efficacy of treatment. In the absence of serious toxicity, 
subsequent doses may be increased with careful monitoring.  
Testing for DPD deficiency 
Phenotype and/or genotype testing prior to the initiation of treatment with Capecitabine Accord is 
recommended despite uncertainties regarding optimal pre-treatment testing methodologies. 
Consideration should be given to applicable clinical guidelines.  
Genotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency  
Pre-treatment testing for rare mutations of the DPYD gene can identify patients with DPD deficiency. 
The four DPYD variants c.1905+1G>A [also known as DPYD*2A], c.1679T>G [DPYD*13], 
c.2846A>T and c.1236G>A/HapB3 can cause complete absence or reduction of DPD enzymatic 
activity. Other rare variants may also be associated with an increased risk of severe or life-threatening 
toxicity.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Certain homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in the DPYD gene locus (e.g. 
combinations of the four variants with at least one allele of c.1905+1G>A or c.1679T>G) are known 
to cause complete or near complete absence of DPD enzymatic activity. 
Patients with certain heterozygous DPYD variants (including c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T 
and c.1236G>A/HapB3 variants) have increased risk of severe toxicity when treated with 
fluoropyrimidines.  
The frequency of the heterozygous c.1905+1G>A genotype in the DPYD gene in Caucasian patients is 
around 1%, 1.1% for c.2846A>T, 2.6-6.3% for c.1236G>A/HapB3 variants and 0.07 to 0.1% for 
c.1679T>G.  
Data on the frequency of the four DPYD variants in other populations than Caucasian is limited. At 
the present, the four DPYD variants (c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G, c.2846A>T and c.1236G>A/HapB3) 
are considered virtually absent in populations of African (-American) or Asian origin.  
Phenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency 
For phenotypic characterisation of DPD deficiency, the measurement of pre-therapeutic blood levels 
of the endogenous DPD substrate uracil (U) in plasma is recommended. 
Elevated pre-treatment uracil concentrations are associated with an increased risk of toxicity. Despite 
uncertainties on uracil thresholds defining complete and partial DPD deficiency, a blood uracil level ≥ 
16 ng/ml and < 150 ng/ml should be considered indicative of partial DPD deficiency and associated 
with an increased risk for fluoropyrimidine toxicity. A blood uracil level ≥ 150 ng/ml should be 
considered indicative of complete DPD deficiency and associated with a risk for life-threatening or 
fatal fluoropyrimidine toxicity. * 
Ophthalmologic complications 
Patients should be carefully monitored for ophthalmological complications such as keratitis and 
corneal disorders, especially if they have a prior history of eye disorders. Treatment of eye disorders 
should be initiated as clinically appropriate. 
Severe skin reactions  
Capecitabine can induce severe skin reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic 
Epidermal Necrolysis. Capecitabine should be permanently discontinued in patients who experience a 
severe skin reaction during treatment. 
Excipients 
As this medicinal product contains anhydrous lactose as an excipient, patients with rare hereditary 
problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should 
not take this medicine. 
Sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Capecitabine  Accord  tablets  should  not  be  crushed  or  cut.  In  case  of  exposure  of  either  patient  or 
caregiver to crushed or cut Capecitabine Accord tablets adverse drug reactions could occur (see Section 
4.8). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Interaction with other medicinal products 
Brivudine: a clinically significant interaction between brivudine and fluoropyrimidines (e.g. 
capecitabine, 5-Fluorouracil, tegafur), resulting from the inhibition of dihydropyrimidine 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dehydrogenase by brivudine, has been described. This interaction, which leads to increased 
fluoropyrimidine toxicity, is potentially fatal. Therefore, brivudine must not be administered 
concomitantly with  capecitabine  (see section 4.3 and 4.4). There must be at least a 4-week waiting 
period between end of treatment with brivudine and start of capecitabine therapy. Treatment with 
brivudine can be started 24 hours after the last dose of capecitabine. 
Cytochrome P-450 2C9 substrates  
Other than warfarin, no formal interaction studies between capecitabine and other CYP2C9 substrates 
have been conducted. Care should be exercised when capecitabine is co-administered with 2C9 
substrates (e.g., phenytoin). See also interaction with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants below, and 
section 4.4. 
Coumarin-derivative anticoagulants  
Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking capecitabine 
concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and phenprocoumon. These 
reactions occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating capecitabine therapy 
and, in a few cases, within one month after stopping capecitabine.In a clinical pharmacokinetic 
interaction study, after a single 20 mg dose of warfarin, capecitabine treatment increased the AUC of 
S-warfarin by 57% with a 91% increase in INR value. Since metabolism of R-warfarin was not 
affected, these results indicate that capecitabine down-regulates isozyme 2C9, but has no effect on 
isozymes 1A2 and 3A4. Patients taking coumarin-derivative anticoagulants concomitantly with 
capecitabine should be monitored regularly for alterations in their coagulation parameters (PT or INR) 
and the anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly. 
Phenytoin 
Increased phenytoin plasma concentrations resulting in symptoms of phenytoin intoxication in single 
cases have been reported during concomitant use of capecitabine with phenytoin. Patients taking 
phenytoin concomitantly with capecitabine should be regularly monitored for increased phenytoin 
plasma concentrations. 
Folinic acid/folic acid  
A combination study with capecitabine and folinic acid indicated that folinic acid has no major effect 
on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites. However, folinic acid has an effect on the 
pharmacodynamics of capecitabine and its toxicity may be enhanced by folinic acid: the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine alone using the intermittent regimen is 3000 mg/m2 per day 
whereas it is only 2000 mg/m2 per day when capecitabine was combined with folinic acid (30 mg 
orally bid). The enhanced toxicity may be relevant when switching from 5-FU/LV to a capecitabine 
regimen. This may also be relevant with folic acid supplementation for folate deficiency due to the 
similarity between folinic acid and folic acid. 
Antacid 
The effect of an aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide-containing antacid on the 
pharmacokinetics of capecitabine was investigated. There was a small increase in plasma 
concentrations of capecitabine and one metabolite (5’-DFCR); there was no effect on the 3 major 
metabolites (5’-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL). 
Allopurinol 
Interactions with allopurinol have been observed for 5-FU; with possible decreased efficacy of 5-FU. 
Concomitant use of allopurinol with capecitabine should be avoided. 
Interferon alpha 
The MTD of capecitabine was 2000 mg/m2 per day when combined with interferon 
alpha-2a (3 MIU/m2 per day) compared to 3000 mg/m2 per day when capecitabine was used alone. 
Radiotherapy  
The MTD of capecitabine alone using the intermittent regimen is 3000 mg/m2 per day, whereas, when 
combined with radiotherapy for rectal cancer, the MTD of capecitabine is 2000 mg/m2 per day using 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
either a continuous schedule or given daily Monday through Friday during a 6-week course of 
radiotherapy. 
Oxaliplatin  
No clinically significant differences in exposure to capecitabine or its metabolites, free platinum or 
total platinum occurred when capecitabine was administered in combination with oxaliplatin or in 
combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. 
Bevacizumab  
There was no clinically significant effect of bevacizumab on the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
capecitabine or its metabolites in the presence of oxaliplatin. 
Food interaction  
In all clinical trials, patients were instructed to administer capecitabine within 30 minutes after a meal. 
Since current safety and efficacy data are based upon administration with food, it is recommended that 
capecitabine be administered with food. Administration with food decreases the rate of capecitabine 
absorption (see section 5.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving 
treatment with capecitabine. If the patient becomes pregnant while receiving capecitabine, the 
potential hazard to the foetus must be explained. An effective method of contraception should be used 
during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of capecitabine. 
Based on genetic toxicity findings, male patients with female partners of reproductive potential should 
use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of capecitabine. 
Pregnancy 
There are no studies in pregnant women using capecitabine; however, it should be assumed that 
capecitabine may cause foetal harm if administered to pregnant women. In reproductive toxicity 
studies in animals, capecitabine administration caused embryolethality and teratogenicity. These 
findings are expected effects of fluoropyrimidine derivatives. Capecitabine is contraindicated during 
pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether capecitabine is excreted in human breast milk. No studies have been 
conducted to assess the impact of capecitabine on milk production or its presence in human breast 
milk. In lactating mice, considerable amounts of capecitabine and its metabolites were found in milk. 
As the potential for harm to the nursing infant is unknown, breast-feeding should be discontinued 
while receiving treatment with capecitabine and for 2 weeks after the final dose. 
Fertility 
There is no data on capecitabine and impact on fertility. The capecitabine pivotal studies 
included females of childbearing potential and males only if they agreed to use an acceptable method 
of birth control to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study and for a reasonable period thereafter.  
In animal studies effects on fertility were observed (see section 5.3) 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Capecitabine has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Capecitabine 
may cause dizziness, fatigue and nausea. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall safety profile of capecitabine is based on data from over 3,000 patients treated with 
capecitabine as monotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in 
multiple indications. The safety profiles of capecitabine monotherapy for the metastatic breast cancer, 
metastatic colorectal cancer and adjuvant colon cancer populations are comparable. See section 5.1 for 
details of major studies, including study designs and major efficacy results. 
The most commonly reported and/or clinically relevant treatment-related adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) were gastrointestinal disorders (especially diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
stomatitis), hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia), fatigue, asthenia, anorexia, 
cardiotoxicity, increased renal dysfunction on those with preexisting compromised renal function, and 
thrombosis/embolism. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
ADRs considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or remotely related to the 
administration of capecitabine are listed in Table 5 for capecitabine given as monotherapy and in 
Table 6 for capecitabine given in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple 
indications. The following headings are used to rank the ADRs by frequency: very common (≥ 1/10), 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and 
very rare (< 1/10,000). Within each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in order of decreasing 
seriousness. 
Capecitabine monotherapy  
Table 5 lists ADRs associated with the use of capecitabine monotherapy based on a pooled analysis of 
safety data from three major studies including over 1900 patients (studies M66001, SO14695, and 
SO14796). ADRs are added to the appropriate frequency grouping according to the overall incidence 
from the pooled analysis.

Capecitabine in combination therapy 
Table 6 lists ADRs associated with the use of capecitabine in combination with different 
chemotherapy regimens in multiple indications based on safety data from over 3000 patients. ADRs 
are added to the appropriate frequency grouping (very common or common) according to the highest 
incidence seen in any of the major clinical trials and are only added when they were seen in addition 
to those seen with capecitabine monotherapy or seen at a higher frequency grouping compared to 
capecitabine monotherapy (see Table 5). Uncommon ADRs reported for capecitabine in combination 
therapy are consistent with the ADRs reported for capecitabine monotherapy or reported for 
monotherapy with the combination medicinal product (in literature and/or respective summary of 
product characteristics). 
Some of the ADRs are reactions commonly seen with the combination medicinal product (e.g. 
peripheral sensory neuropathy with docetaxel or oxaliplatin, hypertension seen with bevacizumab); 
however an exacerbation by capecitabine therapy can not be excluded.

Contusion 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) (see section 4.4) 
For the capecitabine dose of 1250 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 3 weeks, a frequency of 
53% to 60% of all-grades HFS was observed in capecitabine monotherapy trials (comprising studies in 
adjuvant therapy in colon cancer, treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, and treatment of breast 
cancer) and a frequency of 63% was observed in the capecitabine/docetaxel arm for the treatment of 
metastatic breast cancer. For the capecitabine dose of 1000 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1 to 14 every 
3weeks, a frequency of 22% to 30% of all-grade HFS was observed in capecitabine combination 
therapy. 
A meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with capecitabine 
monotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple 
indications (colon, colorectal, gastric and breast cancer) showed that HFS (all grades) occurred in 
2066 (43%) patients after a median time of 239 [95% CI 201, 288] days after starting treatment with 
capecitabine. In all studies combined, the following covariates were statistically significantly 
associated with an increased risk of developing HFS: increasing capecitabine starting dose (gram), 
decreasing cumulative capecitabine dose (0.1*kg), increasing relative dose intensity in the first six 
weeks, increasing duration of study treatment (weeks), increasing age (by 10 year increments), female 
gender, and good ECOG performance status at baseline (0 versus ≥1). 
Diarrhoea (see section 4.4) 
Capecitabine can induce the occurrence of diarrhoea, which has been observed in up to 50% of 
patients.  
The results of a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with 
capecitabine showed that in all studies combined, the following covariates were statistically 
significantly associated with an increased risk of developing diarrhoea: increasing capecitabine 
starting dose (gram), increasing duration of study treatment (weeks), increasing age (by 10 year 
increments), and female gender.  The following covariates were statistically significantly associated 
with a decreased risk of developing diarrhoea:  increasing cumulative capecitabine dose (0.1*kg) and 
increasing relative dose intensity in the first six weeks.   
17 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Cardiotoxicity (see section 4.4) 
In addition to the ADRs described in tables 4 and 5, the following ADRs with an incidence of less than 
0.1% were associated with the use of capecitabine monotherapy based on a pooled analysis from 
clinical safety data from 7 clinical trials including 949 patients (2 phase III and 5 phase II clinical trials 
in metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic breast cancer): cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, sudden 
death, and ventricular extrasystoles.  
Encephalopathy 
In addition to the ADRs described in tables 4 and 5, and based on the above pooled analysis from 
clinical safety data from 7 clinical trials, encephalopathy was also associated with the use of 
capecitabine monotherapy with an incidence of less than 0.1%. 
Exposure to crushed or cut capecitabine tablets:  
In the instance of exposure to crushed or cut capecitabine tablets, the following adverse drug reactions 
have been reported: eye irritation, eye swelling, skin rash, headache, paresthesia, diarrhea, nausea, 
gastric irritation, and vomiting. 
Special populations 
Elderly patients (see section 4.2) 
An analysis of safety data in patients ≥ 60 years of age treated with capecitabine monotherapy and an 
analysis of patients treated with capecitabine plus docetaxel combination therapy showed an increase 
in the incidence of treatment-related grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions and treatment-related serious 
adverse reactions compared to patients < 60 years of age. Patients ≥ 60 years of age treated with 
capecitabine plus docetaxel also had more early withdrawals from treatment due to adverse reactions 
compared to patients < 60 years of age. 
The results of a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with 
capecitabine showed that in all studies combined, increasing age (by 10 year increments) was 
statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of developing HFS and diarrhoea and with a 
decreased risk of developing neutropenia. 
Gender 
The results of a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with 
capecitabine showed that in all studies combined, female gender was statistically significantly 
associated with an increased risk of developing HFS and diarrhoea and with a decreased risk of 
developing neutropenia. 
Patients with renal impairment (see section 4.2, 4.4, and 5.2): 
An analysis of safety data in patients treated with capecitabine monotherapy (colorectal cancer) with 
baseline renal impairment showed an increase in the incidence of treatment-related grade 3 and 4 
adverse reactions compared to patients with normal renal function (36% in patients without renal 
impairment n=268, vs. 41% in mild n=257 and 54% in moderate n=59, respectively) (see section 5.2). 
Patients with moderately impaired renal function show an increased rate of dose reduction (44%) vs. 
33% and 32% in patients with no or mild renal impairment and an increase in early withdrawals from 
treatment (21% withdrawals during the first two cycles) vs. 5% and 8% in patients with no or mild 
renal impairment. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The manifestations of acute overdose include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis, gastrointestinal 
irritation and bleeding, and bone marrow depression. Medical management of overdose should include 
customary therapeutic and supportive medical interventions aimed at correcting the presenting clinical 
manifestations and preventing their possible complications.

5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, pyrimidine analogues, ATC code: 
L01BC06  
Capecitabine is a non-cytotoxic fluoropyrimidine carbamate, which functions as an orally 
administered precursor of the cytotoxic moiety 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Capecitabine is activated via 
several enzymatic steps (see section 5.2). The enzyme involved in the final conversion to 5-FU, 
thymidine phosphorylase (ThyPase), is found in tumour tissues, but also in normal tissues, albeit 
usually at lower levels. In human cancer xenograft models capecitabine demonstrated a synergistic 
effect in combination with docetaxel, which may be related to the upregulation of thymidine 
phosphorylase by docetaxel. 
There is evidence that the metabolism of 5-FU in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation 
reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid, thereby interfering with the synthesis of 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The incorporation of 5-FU also leads to inhibition of RNA and protein 
synthesis. Since DNA and RNA are essential for cell division and growth, the effect of 5-FU may be 
to create a thymidine deficiency that provokes unbalanced growth and death of a cell. The effects of 
DNA and RNA deprivation are most marked on those cells which proliferate more rapidly and which 
metabolise 5-FU at a more rapid rate. 
Colon and colorectal cancer 
Monotherapy with capecitabine in adjuvant colon cancer 
Data from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trial in patients with stage III 
(Dukes' C) colon cancer supports the use of capecitabine for the adjuvant treatment of patients with 
colon cancer (XACT Study; M66001). In this trial, 1987 patients were randomised to treatment with 
capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period and given as 3-
week cycles for 24 weeks) or 5-FU and leucovorin (Mayo Clinic regimen: 20 mg/m2 leucovorin 
intravenous followed by 425 mg/m2 intravenous bolus 5-FU, on days 1 to 5, every 28 days for 24 
weeks). Capecitabine was at least equivalent to intravenous 5-FU/LV in disease-free survival in per 
protocol population (hazard ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.80-1.06). In the all-randomised population, tests for 
difference of capecitabine vs 5-FU/LV in disease-free and overall survival showed hazard ratios of 
0.88 (95% CI 0.77 – 1.01; p = 0.068) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.74 – 1.01; p = 0.060), respectively. The 
median follow up at the time of the analysis was 6.9 years. In a preplanned multivariate Cox analysis, 
superiority of capecitabine compared with bolus 5-FU/LV was demonstrated. The following factors 
were pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan for inclusion in the model: age, time from surgery to 
randomisation, gender, CEA levels at baseline, lymph nodes at baseline, and country. In the all-
randomised population, capecitabine was shown to be superior to 5-FU/LV for disease-free survival 
(hazard ratio 0.849; 95% CI 0.739 - 0.976; p = 0.0212), as well as for overall survival (hazard ratio 
0.828; 95% CI 0.705 - 0.971; p = 0.0203). 
Combination therapy in adjuvant colon cancer  
Data from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 3 clinical trial in patients with stage III 
(Dukes' C) colon cancer supports the use of capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin (XELOX) for 
the adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer (NO16968 study). In this trial, 944 patients were 
randomised to 3-week cycles for 24 weeks with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks 
followed by a 1-week rest period) in combination with oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 intravenous infusion 
over 2-hours on day 1 every 3 weeks); 942 patients were randomised to bolus 5-FU and leucovorin. In 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the primary analysis for DFS in the ITT population, XELOX was shown to be significantly superior to 
5-FU/LV (HR=0.80, 95% CI=[0.69; 0.93]; p=0.0045). The 3 year DFS rate was 71% for XELOX 
versus 67% for 5-FU/LV. The analysis for the secondary endpoint of RFS supports these results with a 
HR of 0.78 (95% CI=[0.67; 0.92]; p=0.0024) for XELOX vs. 5-FU/LV. XELOX showed a trend 
towards superior OS with a HR of 0.87 (95% CI=[0.72; 1.05]; p=0.1486) which translates into a 13% 
reduction in risk of death. The 5 year OS rate was 78% for XELOX versus 74% for 5-FU/LV. The 
efficacy data is based on a median observation time of 59 months for OS and 57 months for DFS. The 
rate of withdrawal due to adverse events was higher in the XELOX combination therapy arm (21 %) 
as compared with that of the 5-FU/LV monotherapy arm (9 %) in the ITT population. 
Monotherapy with capecitabine in metastatic colorectal cancer 
Data from two identically-designed, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trials 
(SO14695; SO14796) support the use of capecitabine for first line treatment of metastatic colorectal 
cancer. In these trials, 603 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice 
daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest period and given as 3-week cycles). 604 patients were 
randomised to treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin (Mayo regimen: 20 mg/m2 leucovorin intravenous 
followed by 425 mg/m2 intravenous bolus 5-FU, on days 1 to 5, every 28 days). The overall objective 
response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator assessment) were 25.7% (capecitabine) 
vs. 16.7% (Mayo regimen); p <0.0002. The median time to progression was 140 days (capecitabine) 
vs. 144 days (Mayo regimen). Median survival was 392 days (capecitabine) vs. 391 days (Mayo 
regimen). Currently, no comparative data are available on capecitabine monotherapy in colorectal 
cancer in comparison with first line combination regimens. 
Combination therapy in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer 
Data from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study (NO16966) support the use of 
capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin or in combination with oxaliplatin and bevacizumab for 
the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. The study contained two parts: an initial 2-arm 
part in which 634 patients were randomised to two different treatment groups, including XELOX or 
FOLFOX-4, and a subsequent 2x2 factorial part in which 1401 patients were randomised to four 
different treatment groups, including XELOX plus placebo, FOLFOX-4 plus placebo, XELOX plus 
bevacizumab, and FOLFOX-4 plus bevacizumab. See Table 7 for treatment regimens.

Non-inferiority of the XELOX-containing arms compared with the FOLFOX-4-containing arms in the 
overall comparison was demonstrated in terms of progression-free survival in the eligible patient 
population and the intent-to-treat population (see Table 8). The results indicate that XELOX is 
equivalent to FOLFOX-4 in terms of overall survival (see Table 8). A comparison of XELOX plus 
bevacizumab versus FOLFOX-4 plus bevacizumab was a pre-specified exploratory analysis. In this 
20 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
treatment subgroup comparison, XELOX plus bevacizumab was similar compared to FOLFOX-4 plus 
bevacizumab in terms of progression-free survival (hazard ratio 1.01; 97.5% CI 0.84 - 1.22). The 
median follow up at the time of the primary analyses in the intent-to-treat population was 1.5 years; 
data from analyses following an additional 1 year of follow up are also included in Table 8. However, 
the on-treatment PFS analysis did not confirm the results of the general PFS and OS analysis: the 
hazard ratio of XELOX versus FOLFOX-4 was 1.24 with 97.5% CI 1.07 - 1.44. Although sensitivity 
analyses show that differences in regimen schedules and timing of tumor assessments impact the on-
treatment PFS analysis, a full explanation for this result has not been found.

In a randomised, controlled phase III study (CAIRO), the effect of using capecitabine at a starting dose 
of 1000 mg/m2 for 2 weeks every 3 weeks in combination with irinotecan for the first-line treatment of 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer was studied.  820 Patients were randomised to receive either 
sequential treatment (n=410) or combination treatment (n=410). Sequential treatment consisted of 
first-line capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days), second-line irinotecan (350 mg/m2 on day 
1), and third-line combination of capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days) with oxaliplatin 
(130 mg/m2 on day 1). Combination treatment  consisted of first-line capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice 
daily for 14 days) combined with irinotecan (250 mg /m2 on day 1) (XELIRI) and second-line 
capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days) plus oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 on day 1). All 
treatment cycles were administered at intervals of 3 weeks. In first-line treatment the median 
progression-free survival in the intent-to-treat population was 5.8 months (95%CI 5.1 - 6.2 months) 
for capecitabine monotherapy and 7.8 months (95%CI 7.0 - 8.3 months; p=0.0002) for XELIRI. 
However this was associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity and neutropenia 
during first-line treatment with XELIRI (26% and 11% for XELIRI and first line capecitabine 
respectively). 
The XELIRI has been compared with 5-FU + irinotecan (FOLFIRI) in three randomised studies in 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The XELIRI regimens included capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 
twice daily on days 1 to 14 of a three-week cycle combined with irinotecan 250 mg/m2 on day1. In the 
largest study (BICC-C), patients were randomised to receive either open label FOLFIRI (n=144), 
bolus 5-FU (mIFL) (n=145) or XELIRI (n=141) and were additionally randomised to receive either 
double-blind treatment with celecoxib or placebo. Median PFS was 7.6 months for FOLFIRI, 5.9 
months for mIFL (p=0.004) for the comparison with FOLFIRI), and 5.8 months for XELIRI 
(p=0.015). Median OS was 23.1 months for FOLFIRI, 17.6 months for mIFL (p=0.09), and 18.9 
21 
 
  
  
 
 
months for XELIRI (p=0.27).  Patients treated with XELIRI experienced excessive gastrointestinal 
toxicity compared with FOLFIRI (diarrhoea 48% and 14% for XELIRI and FOLFIRI respectively). 
In the EORTC study patients were randomised to receive either open label FOLFIRI (n=41) or 
XELIRI (n=44) with additional randomisation to either double-blind treatment with celecoxib or 
placebo. Median PFS and overall survival (OS) times were shorter for XELIRI versus FOLFIRI (PFS 
5.9 versus 9.6 months and OS 14.8 versus 19.9 months), in addition to which excessive rates of 
diarrhoea were reported in patients receiving the XELIRI regimen (41% XELIRI, 5.1% FOLFIRI).  
In the study published by Skof et al, patients were randomised to receive either FOLFIRI or XELIRI . 
Overall response rate was 49% in the XELIRI and 48% in the FOLFIRI arm (p=0.76). At the end of 
treatment, 37% of patients in the XELIRI and 26% of patients in the FOLFIRI arm were without 
evidence of the disease (p=0.56). Toxcity was similar between treatments with the exception of 
neutropenia reported more commonly in patients treated with FOLFIRI. 
Montagnani et al used the results from the above three studies to provide an overall analysis of 
randomised studies comparing FOLFIRI and XELIRI treatment regimens in the treatment of mCRC.  
A significant reduction in the risk of progression was associated with FOLFIRI (HR, 0.76; 95%CI, 
0.62-0.95; P <0.01), a result partly due to poor tolerance to the XELIRI regimens used. 
Data from a randomised clinical study (Souglakos et al, 2012) comparing FOLFIRI + bevacizumab 
with XELIRI + bevacizumab showed no significant differences in PFS or OS between treatments. 
Patients were randomised to receive either FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (Arm-A, n=167) or XELIRI 
plus bevacizumab (Arm-B, n-166). For Arm B, the XELIRI regimen used capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 
twice daily for 14 days +irinotecan 250 mg/m2 on day 1.  Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 
10.0 and 8.9 months; p=0.64, overall survival 25.7 and 27.5 months; p=0.55 and response rates 45.5 
and 39.8%; p=0.32 for FOLFIRI-Bev and XELIRI-Bev, respectively. Patients treated with XELIRI + 
bevacizumab reported a significantly higher incidence of diarrhoea, febrile neutropenia and hand-foot 
skin reactions than patients treated with FOLFIRI + bevacizumab with significantly increased 
treatment delays, dose reductions and treatment discontinuations. 
Data from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase II study (AIO KRK 0604) supports the use of 
capecitabine at a starting dose of 800 mg/m2 for 2 weeks every 3 weeks in combination with irinotecan 
and bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  120 Patients 
were randomised to a modified XELIRI regimen  with capecitabine 800 mg/m2 twice daily for two 
weeks followed by a 7-day rest period), irinotecan (200 mg/m2 as a 30 minute infusion on day 1 every 
3 weeks), and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg as a 30 to 90 minute infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks) ;  127 
patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily for two weeks 
followed by a 7-day rest period), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 as a 2 hour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks), 
and bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg as a 30 to 90 minute infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks). Following a mean 
duration of follow-up for the study population of 26.2 months, treatment responses were as shown 
below:

Combination therapy in second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer 
Data from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical study (NO16967) support the use of 
capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin for the second-line treatment of metastastic colorectal 
cancer. In this trial, 627 patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who have received prior 
treatment with irinotecan in combination with a fluoropyrimidine regimen as first line therapy were 
randomised to treatment with XELOX or FOLFOX-4. For the dosing schedule of XELOX and 
FOLFOX-4 (without addition of placebo or bevacizumab), refer to Table 7. XELOX was 
demonstrated to be non-inferior to FOLFOX-4 in terms of progression-free survival in the per-
protocol population and intent-to-treat population (see Table 10). The results indicate that XELOX is 
equivalent to FOLFOX-4 in terms of overall survival (see Table 10). The median follow up at the time 
of the primary analyses in the intent-to-treat population was 2.1 years; data from analyses following an 
additional 6 months of follow up are also included in Table 10.

Advanced gastric cancer: 
Data from a multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trial in patients with advanced 
gastric cancer supports the use of capecitabine for the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer 
(ML17032). In this trial, 160 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 
twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 7-day rest period) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion 
every 3 weeks). A total of 156 patients were randomised to treatment with 5-FU (800 mg/m2 per day, 
continuous infusion on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on day 
1, every 3 weeks). Capecitabine in combination with cisplatin was non-inferior to 5-FU in 
combination with cisplatin in terms of progression-free survival in the per protocol analysis (hazard 
ratio 0.81; 95% CI 0.63 - 1.04). The median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (capecitabine + 
cisplatin) versus 5.0 months (5-FU + cisplatin). The hazard ratio for duration of survival (overall 
survival) was similar to the hazard ratio for progression-free survival (hazard ratio 0.85; 95% CI 0.64 - 
1.13). The median duration of survival was 10.5 months (capecitabine + cisplatin) versus 9.3 months 
(5-FU + cisplatin). 
Data from a randomised multicentre, phase III study comparing capecitabine to 5-FU and oxaliplatin 
to cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric cancer supports the use of capecitabine for the first-line 
23 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
treatment of advanced gastric cancer (REAL-2). In this trial, 1002 patients were randomised in a 2x2 
factorial design to one of the following 4 arms: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
ECF: epirubicin (50 mg/ m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), cisplatin (60 mg/m2 as a two 
hour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks) and 5-FU (200 mg/m2 daily given by continuous infusion 
via a central line). 
ECX: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), cisplatin (60 mg/m2 as a two 
hour infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks), and capecitabine (625 mg/m2 twice daily continuously).  
EOF: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 given as 
a 2 hour infusion on day 1 every three weeks), and 5-FU (200 mg/m2 daily given by continuous 
infusion via a central line). 
EOX: epirubicin (50 mg/m2 as a bolus on day 1 every 3 weeks), oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2 given as 
a 2 hour infusion on day 1 every three weeks), and capecitabine (625 mg/m2 twice daily 
continuously). 
The primary efficacy analyses in the per protocol population demonstrated non-inferiority in overall 
survival for capecitabine- vs 5-FU-based regimens (hazard ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.8 - 0.99) and for 
oxaliplatin- vs cisplatin-based regimens (hazard ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.80 - 1.1). The median overall 
survival was 10.9 months in capecitabine-based regimens and 9.6 months in 5-FU based regimens. 
The median overall survival was 10.0 months in cisplatin-based regimens and 10.4 months in 
oxaliplatin-based regimens. 
Capecitabine has also been used in combination with oxaliplatin for the treatment of advanced gastric 
cancer. Studies with capecitabine monotherapy indicate that capecitabine has activity in advanced 
gastric cancer. 
Colon, colorectal and advanced gastric cancer: meta-analysis 
A meta-analysis of six clinical trials (studies SO14695, SO14796, M66001, NO16966, NO16967, 
M17032) supports capecitabine replacing 5-FU in mono- and combination treatment in gastrointestinal 
cancer. The pooled analysis includes 3097 patients treated with capecitabine -containing regimens and 
3074 patients treated with 5-FU-containing regimens. Median overall survival time was 703 days 
(95% CI: 671; 745) in patients treated with capecitabine -containing regimens and 683 days (95% CI: 
646; 715) in patients treated with 5-FU-containing regimens. The hazard ratio for overall survival was 
0.94 (95% CI: 0.89; 1.00, p=0.0489) indicating that capecitabine -containing regimens are non-inferior 
to 5-FU-containing regimens. 
Breast cancer: 
Combination therapy with capecitabine and docetaxel in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
Data from one multicentre, randomised, controlled phase III clinical trial support the use of 
capecitabine in combination with docetaxel for treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic breast cancer after failure of cytotoxic chemotherapy, including an anthracycline. In this 
trial, 255 patients were randomised to treatment with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 
weeks followed by 1-week rest period and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 as a 1 hour intravenous infusion every 
3 weeks). 256 patients were randomised to treatment with docetaxel alone (100 mg/m2 as a 1 hour 
intravenous infusion every 3 weeks). Survival was superior in the capecitabine + docetaxel 
combination arm (p=0.0126). Median survival was 442 days (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 352 days 
(docetaxel alone). The overall objective response rates in the all-randomised population (investigator 
assessment) were 41.6% (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 29.7% (docetaxel alone); p = 0.0058. Time to 
progressive disease was superior in the capecitabine + docetaxel combination arm (p<0.0001). The 
median time to progression was 186 days (capecitabine + docetaxel) vs. 128 days (docetaxel alone). 
Monotherapy with capecitabine after failure of taxanes, anthracycline containing chemotherapy, and 
for whom anthracycline therapy is not indicated 
Data from two multicentre phase II clinical trials support the use of capecitabine monotherapy for 
treatment of patients after failure of taxanes and an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen or 
for whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated. In these trials, a total of 236 patients were 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treated with capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by 1-week rest period). The 
overall objective response rates (investigator assessment) were 20% (first trial) and 25% (second trial). 
The median time to progression was 93 and 98 days. Median survival was 384 and 373 days. 
All indications 
A meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials with data from over 4700 patients treated with capecitabine 
monotherapy or capecitabine in combination with different chemotherapy regimens in multiple 
indications (colon, colorectal, gastric and breast cancer) showed that patients on capecitabine who 
developed hand-foot syndrome (HFS) had a longer overall survival compared to patients who did not 
develop HFS: median overall survival 1100 days (95% CI 1007;1200) vs 691 days (95% CI 638;754) 
with a hazard ratio of 0.61 (95% CI 0.56; 0.66). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with the 
reference medicinal product containing capecitabine  in all subsets of the paediatric population in 
adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum, gastric adenocarcinoma and breast carcinoma (see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of capecitabine have been evaluated over a dose range of 502-3514 mg/m2/day. 
The parameters of capecitabine, 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5'-DFCR) and 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine 
(5'-DFUR) measured on days 1 and 14 were similar. The AUC of 5-FU was 30%-35% higher on day 
14. Capecitabine dose reduction decreases systemic exposure to 5-FU more than dose-proportionally, 
due to non-linear pharmacokinetics for the active metabolite. 
Absorption  
After oral administration, capecitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed, followed by extensive 
conversion to the metabolites, 5'-DFCR and 5'-DFUR. Administration with food decreases the rate of 
capecitabine absorption, but only results in a minor effect on the AUC of 5'-DFUR, and on the AUC of 
the subsequent metabolite 5-FU. At the dose of 1250 mg/m2 on day 14 with administration after food 
intake, the peak plasma concentrations (Cmax  in µg/ml) for capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and 
FBAL were 4.67, 3.05, 12.1, 0.95 and 5.46 respectively. The time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax 
in hours) were 1.50, 2.00, 2.00, 2.00 and 3.34. The AUC0- values in μg•h/ml were 7.75, 7.24, 24.6, 
2.03 and 36.3. 
Distribution  
In vitro human plasma studies have determined that capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR and 5-FU are 
54%, 10%, 62% and 10% protein bound, mainly to albumin. 
Biotransformation  
Capecitabine is first metabolised by hepatic carboxylesterase to 5'-DFCR, which is then converted to 
5'-DFUR by cytidine deaminase, principally located in the liver and tumour tissues. Further catalytic 
activation of 5'-DFUR then occurs by thymidine phosphorylase (ThyPase). The enzymes involved in 
the catalytic activation are found in tumour tissues but also in normal tissues, albeit usually at lower 
levels. The sequential enzymatic biotransformation of capecitabine to 5-FU leads to higher 
concentrations within tumour tissues. In the case of colorectal tumours, 5-FU generation appears to be 
in large part localised in tumour stromal cells. Following oral administration of capecitabine to 
patients with colorectal cancer, the ratio of 5-FU concentration in colorectal tumours to adjacent 
tissues was 3.2 (ranged from 0.9 to 8.0). The ratio of 5-FU concentration in tumour to plasma was 21.4 
(ranged from 3.9 to 59.9, n=8) whereas the ratio in healthy tissues to plasma was 8.9 (ranged from 3.0 
to 25.8, n=8). Thymidine phosphorylase activity was measured and found to be 4 times greater in 
primary colorectal tumour than in adjacent normal tissue. According to immunohistochemical studies, 
thymidine phosphorylase appears to be in large part localised in tumour stromal cells. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5-FU is further catabolised by the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) to the much less 
toxic dihydro-5-fluorouracil (FUH2). Dihydropyrimidinase cleaves the pyrimidine ring to yield 5-
fluoro-ureidopropionic acid (FUPA). Finally, β-ureido-propionase cleaves FUPA to α-fluoro-β-alanine 
(FBAL) which is cleared in the urine. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity is the rate 
limiting step. Deficiency of DPD may lead to increased toxicity of capecitabine (see section 4.3 and 
4.4). 
Elimination  
The elimination half-life (t1/2 in hours) of capecitabine, 5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL were 
0.85, 1.11, 0.66, 0.76 and 3.23 respectively. Capecitabine and its metabolites are predominantly 
excreted in urine; 95.5% of administered capecitabine dose is recovered in urine. Faecal excretion is 
minimal (2.6%). The major metabolite excreted in urine is FBAL, which represents 57% of the 
administered dose. About 3% of the administered dose is excreted in urine unchanged  
Combination therapy 
Phase I studies evaluating the effect of capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of either docetaxel or 
paclitaxel and vice versa showed no effect by capecitabine on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel or 
paclitaxel (Cmax and AUC) and no effect by docetaxel or paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of 
5'-DFUR. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after capecitabine treatment of 505 patients 
with colorectal cancer dosed at 1250 mg/m2 twice daily. Gender, presence or absence of liver 
metastasis at baseline, Karnofsky Performance Status, total bilirubin, serum albumin, ASAT and 
ALAT had no statistically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 5'-DFUR, 5-FU and FBAL. 
Patients with hepatic impairment due to liver metastases: According to a pharmacokinetic study in 
cancer patients with mild to moderate liver impairment due to liver metastases, the bioavailability of 
capecitabine and exposure to 5-FU may increase compared to patients with no liver impairment. There 
are no pharmacokinetic data on patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Patients with renal impairment: Based on a pharmacokinetic study in cancer patients with mild to 
severe renal impairment, there is no evidence for an effect of creatinine clearance on the 
pharmacokinetics of intact drug and 5-FU. Creatinine clearance was found to influence the systemic 
exposure to 5'-DFUR (35% increase in AUC when creatinine clearance decreases by 50%) and to 
FBAL (114% increase in AUC when creatinine clearance decreases by 50%). FBAL is a metabolite 
without antiproliferative activity. 
Elderly: Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, which included patients with a wide range 
of ages (27 to 86 years) and included 234 (46%) patients greater or equal to 65, age has no influence 
on the pharmacokinetics of 5'-DFUR and 5-FU. The AUC of FBAL increased with age (20% increase 
in age results in a 15% increase in the AUC of FBAL). This increase is likely due to a change in renal 
function. 
Ethnic factors: Following oral administration of 825 mg/m2 capecitabine twice daily for 14 days, 
Japanese patients (n=18) had about 36% lower Cmax and 24% lower AUC for capecitabine than 
Caucasian patients (n=22). Japanese patients had also about 25% lower Cmax and 34% lower AUC for 
FBAL than Caucasian patients. The clinical relevance of these differences is unknown. No significant 
differences occurred in the exposure to other metabolites (5'-DFCR, 5'-DFUR, and 5-FU). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies, daily oral administration of capecitabine to cynomolgus monkeys and 
mice produced toxic effects on the gastrointestinal, lymphoid and haemopoietic systems, typical for 
fluoropyrimidines. These toxicities were reversible. Skin toxicity, characterised 
bydegenerative/regressive changes, was observed with capecitabine. Capecitabine was devoid of 
hepatic and CNS toxicities. Cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. PR- and QT-interval prolongation) was 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
detectable in cynomolgus monkeys after intravenous administration (100 mg/kg) but not after repeated 
oral dosing (1379 mg/m2/day). 
A two-year mouse carcinogenicity study produced no evidence of carcinogenicity by capecitabine. 
During standard fertility studies, impairment of fertility was observed in female mice receiving 
capecitabine; however, this effect was reversible after a drug-free period. In addition, during a 
13-week study, atrophic and degenerative changes occurred in reproductive organs of male mice; 
however these effects were reversible after a drug-free period (see section 4.6). 
In embryotoxicity and teratogenicity studies in mice, dose-related increases in foetal resorption and 
teratogenicity were observed. In monkeys, abortion and embryolethality were observed at high doses, 
but there was no evidence of teratogenicity. 
Capecitabine was not mutagenic in vitro to bacteria (Ames test) or mammalian cells (Chinese hamster 
V79/HPRT gene mutation assay). However, similar to other nucleoside analogues (ie, 5-FU), 
capecitabine was clastogenic in human lymphocytes (in vitro) and a positive trend occurred in mouse 
bone marrow micronucleus tests (in vivo).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.   What Capecitabine Accord is and what it is used for 
Capecitabine Accord belongs to the group of medicines called "cytostatic medicines", which stop the 
growth of cancer cells. Capecitabine Accord contains capecitabine, which itself is not a cytostatic 
medicine. Only after being absorbed by the body is it changed into an active anti-cancer medicine 
(more in tumour tissue than in normal tissue). 
Capecitabine Accord is used in the treatment of colon, rectal, gastric, or breast cancers. 
Furthermore, Capecitabine Accord is used to prevent new occurrence of colon cancer after complete 
removal of the tumour by surgery. 
Capecitabine Accord may be used either alone or in combination with other medicines.

DPD deficiency:  
DPD deficiency is a genetic condition that is not usually associated with health problems unless you 
receive certain medicines. If you have DPD deficiency and take  Capecitabine Accord, you are at an 
increased risk of severe side effects (listed under section 4 Possible side effects). It is recommended to 
test you for DPD deficiency before start of treatment. If you have no activity of the enzyme you should 
not take Capecitabine Accord. If you have a reduced enzyme activity (partial deficiency) your doctor 
might prescribe a reduced dose. If you have negative test results for DPD deficiency, severe and life-
threatening side effects may still occur.

3. 
How to take Capecitabine Accord 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Capecitabine  Accord  should  only  be  prescribed  by  a  doctor  experienced  in  the  use  of  anticancer 
medicines. 
Your doctor will prescribe a dose and treatment regimen that is right for you. The dose of 
Capecitabine Accord is based on your body surface area. This is calculated from your height and 
weight. The usual dose for adults is 1250 mg/m2 of body surface area taken two times daily (morning 
and evening). Two examples are provided here: A person whose body weight is 64 kg and height is 
1.64 m has a body surface area of 1.7 m2 and should take 4 tablets of 500 mg and 1 tablet of 150 mg 
two times daily. A person whose body weight is 80 kg and height is 1.80 m has a body surface area of 
2.00 m2 and should take 5 tablets of 500 mg two times daily. 
Your doctor will tell you what dose you need to take, when to take it and for how long you need 
to take it. 
Your doctor may want you to take a combination of 150 mg and 500 mg tablets for each dose. 
• 
• 
Take the tablets morning and evening as prescribed by your doctor. 
Take the tablets within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast and dinner) and swallow 
them whole with water. Do not crush or cut tablets. If you cannot swallow Capecitabine 
Accord tablets whole, tell your healthcare provider. 
It is important that you take all your medicine as prescribed by your doctor. 
• 
Capecitabine Accord tablets are usually taken for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest period (when no 
tablets are taken). This 21 day period is one treatment cycle. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In combination with other medicines the usual dose for adults may be less than 1250 mg/m2 of body 
surface area, and you may need to take the tablets over a different time period (e.g. every day, with no 
rest period). 
If you take more Capecitabine Accord than you should 
If you take more Capecitabine Accord than you should, contact your doctor as soon as possible before 
taking the next dose. 
You might get the following side effects if you take a lot more capecitabine than you should, feeling or 
being sick, diarrhoea, inflammation or ulceration of the gut or mouth, pain or bleeding from the 
intestine or stomach, or bone marrow depression (reduction in certain kinds of blood cells). Tell your 
doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms. 
If you forget to take Capecitabine Accord 
Do not take the missed dose at all. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.Instead, 
continue your regular dosing schedule and check with your doctor.  
If you stop taking Capecitabine Accord 
There are no side-effects caused by stopping treatment with capecitabine. In case you are using 
coumarin anticoagulants (containing e.g. phenprocoumon), stopping capecitabine might require that 
your doctor adjusts your anticoagulant dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

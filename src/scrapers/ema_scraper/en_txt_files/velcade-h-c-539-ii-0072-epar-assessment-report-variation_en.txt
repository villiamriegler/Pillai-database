2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and it accounts for about 6% of all 
NHL cases (1).  In Europe, the annual incidence of MCL was similarly estimated as on average 0.45/100 000 
persons based on cancer registry data from 20 countries in the beginning of the 21st century (2). For patients 
categorized as low-risk according to the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (MIPI), 
5-year survival has been estimated to be 60%, while those in the intermediate- and high-risk groups have 
a median OS of 51 and 29 months, respectively (3). 
In the European Union (EU) temsirolimus and ibrutinib are the approved treatments for relapsed or 
refractory MCL. 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indication: 
Velcade in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma. 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is:  
Velcade  
Assessment report  
EMA/74029/2015 
Page 7/58 
 
  
 
 
Velcade in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are unsuitable for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor. It is specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsin like activity of the 
26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades 
ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the turnover 
of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents 
this targeted proteolysis and affects multiple signalling cascades within the cell, ultimately resulting in 
cancer cell death (SmPC section 5.1). 
The recommended dose is 1.3 mg/m2 body surface area twice weekly for two weeks on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, 
followed by a 10 day rest period on days 12-21. This 3 week period is considered a treatment cycle. Six 
Velcade cycles are recommended, although for patients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two 
additional Velcade cycles may be given. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of 
Velcade. The following medicinal products are administered on day 1 of each Velcade  3 week treatment 
cycle as intravenous infusions: rituximab at 375 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide at 750 mg/m2 and doxorubicin 
at 50 mg/m2. Prednisone is administered orally at 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of each Velcade 
treatment cycle (SmPC section 4.2). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  non-clinical  data  submitted  by  the  applicant  included  literature  data  with  a  summary  of  the 
understanding of the mechanism of anti-cancer activity of bortezomib in MCL. An updated ERA was also 
submitted. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor, specifically designed to inhibit the chymotrypsin like activity of the 
26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The role of proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of MCL was recently 
reviewed [4]. Pham et al. [5] concluded that bortezomib inhibits MCL tumor cell growth through two control 
mechanisms: cell cycle arrest and induction of cell death. Multiple mechanisms may contribute to these 
effects, including inhibition of the NF-κB pathway by stabilization of IκB, stabilization and increased 
intracellular levels of cyclindependent kinase inhibitors, such as p27 and p21, and induction of mitochondrial 
depolarization and apoptosis by activation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Noxa (Latin for 
damage) [5,6,7]. Activation of Noxa was shown to mediate bortezomib induced apoptosis in both 
bortezomib sensitive and resistant MCL cell lines, while down regulation of Noxa with siRNA protected the 
cell lines against bortezomib-induced apoptosis [5]. The findings suggested that Noxa may not contribute to 
the mechanisms of resistance to bortezomib. Bortezomib has been shown to cause cell cycle arrest in G1 
with rapid induction of apoptosis. In addition, G1 cell cycle arrest has been associated with inhibition of cyclin 
D1 expression [6].  
Reduced expression of p27 and loss of normal p53 function are both associated with a poor prognosis in MCL 
and the intracellular levels of p27 and p53 are both modulated by proteasomal degradation [9,10,11,12].  
In one study, lysates were prepared from primary MCL tumors, and tested for proteasome-mediated 
degradation of p27 protein [9]. Lysates from patients with more rapidly progressive MCL tended to show 
more rapid degradation of p27. In another series of experiments in human MCL cell lines, treatment with the 
Velcade  
Assessment report  
EMA/74029/2015 
Page 8/58 
 
  
proteasome inhibitor lactacystin resulted in accumulation of p21 and p53, inhibition of proliferation and 
induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis [11]. Therefore, it is possible that inhibition of the proteasome by 
bortezomib results in increased intracellular levels of p27, p21, and p53, and that this contributes to activity 
in MCL. More recently, transcription repressor PR domain zinc finger protein 1 (PRDM1) was also suggested 
to be an important regulator of apoptotic responses to bortezomib [13]. Bortezomib treatment of MCL cell 
lines rapidly induced PRDM1 expression leading to downregulation of the proliferation associated proteins 
MKI67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Expression of PRDM1 was also associated with 
apoptosis. 
In preclinical studies, bortezomib has also been shown to be additive or synergistic with other clinically 
active agents in MCL. The combination of bortezomib and rituximab in MCL cell lines and primary cultures 
from patients with MCL produced additive apoptotic effects [14]. In a separate study, bortezomib combined 
with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide enhanced apoptosis in MCL cell lines and primary cultures established 
from patient samples in vitro [15]. In vivo, the combination of bortezomib with rituximab plus 
cyclophosphamide induced a marked regression of established Jeko-1 MCL tumor xenografts, which was not 
observed when the compounds were administered as single agents. Bortezomib was reported to have 
synergistic activity with cytarabine in three out of four MCL cell lines in vitro [16]. Enhanced activity was also 
reported for the combination of bortezomib and arsenic trioxide in MCL cell lines and MCL primary cultures 
explanted from patients [17]. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new pharmacokinetic data have been submitted. 
2.2.4.  Toxicology 
No new toxicology data have been submitted. 
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Phase I  
Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) 
The log Kow, of bortezomib is 2 (pH=7), which is lower than the trigger value of 4.5. Consequently, no 
PBT-assessment is performed. 
Calculation of the predicted environmental concentration (PECsw) 
The PECsw has been refined considering: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the rarity of the new condition (MCL) for which the use of Velcade is being proposed,  
that since 2004 in EU bortezomib has been used in the treatment of Multiple Myeloma (MM), that 
although  rare  is  significantly  prevalent  than  MCL  (MM=1-5  /  10  000;  MCL=1-9  /  100  000  by 
Orphanet), 
the prevalence data is further limited when front line setting is considered, 
the use of Velcade in hospitals setting throughout Europe. 
In conclusion no significant increase in environmental exposure is anticipated based on this extension of 
indication.

2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Literature based data from non-clinical studies of the mechanism of action of bortezomib supports its activity 
in MCL. Bortezomib inhibits MCL tumour cell growth through reversible inhibition of the proteasome activity. 
Multiple mechanisms may contribute to cell cycle arrest and induction of cell death; bortezomib inhibits the 
NF-κB pathway, upregulates important cell cycle inhibitors such as p27 and p21, and activates proapoptotic 
pathways such as Noxa. In nonclinical combination studies, bortezomib was additive or synergistic with 
other clinically active agents (such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide) in vitro in MCL patient cells and in vivo 
MCL tumor xenograft model. 
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of active substance.  
Considering the above data, bortezomib is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
The non-clinical data submitted by the MAH support the sought indication.

2.4.  Discussion and Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No additional pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in support of this application. 
The  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  have  been  evaluated  and  approved  in  the  previous 
applications of Velcade. There is no need to conduct pharmacological analyses in order to support the new 
indication. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No new dose-response study has been submitted with this application. 
The  selected dose  and  schedule  of  cyclophosphamide  and  doxorubicin  are  based  on  the  dosing  of  these 
agents in the standard R-CHOP regimen. Regarding alternative Velcade dosing regimens in combination with 
an R-CHOP backbone, limited information is available in the medical literature. The MAH provided the results 
of a Phase 1/2 study in subjects with untreated Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) or MCL, in which 
standard  R-CHOP  was  combined  with  one  of  3  dose  levels  of  Velcade  (0.7  mg/m2,  1.0  mg/m2,  and  1.3 
mg/m2) administered on Days 1 and 4 of each cycle. In the Phase 1 portion of the study Velcade 1.3 mg/m2 
was found to be tolerable with this schedule. The primary toxicities of Velcade with standard R-CHOP were 
neuropathy in addition to reversible myelosuppression. Velcade with standard R-CHOP resulted in an 86% 
CR/CRu rate for evaluable subjects with DLBCL, compared with historical rates of 75% to 86% for R-CHOP 
alone. 
A study from the Wisconsin Oncology Network investigated the addition of Velcade to the R-CVAD regimen 
in  MCL  subjects.  Velcade  was  given  at  a  dose  of  1.3  mg/m2  on  Days  1  and  4  of  each  cycle.  The  major 
toxicities  from  VcR-CVAD  were  myelosuppression  (neutropenia,  and  thrombocytopenia)  and  peripheral 
neuropathy.  The  severity  of  myelosuppression  did  not  appear  to  be  altered  by  the  addition  of  Velcade, 
however,  there  was  clearly  an  increased  risk  for  peripheral  neuropathy  when  combining  VELCADE  and 
vincristine. The overall response rate (ORR) was 90% and the CR/CRu rate was 77%. 
In a Phase 2 study from the French Adult Lymphoma Study Group (GELA), subjects were randomized to 1 of 
2 schedules of Velcade, administered biweekly (Arm A; Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) or weekly (Arm B; Days 1 and 
8),  combined  with  6  cycles  of  R-CHOP.  The  most  common  drug-related  non-hematologic  toxicities  were 
neurologic toxicity (70% in biweekly and 71% in weekly) and more severe neurologic toxicity occurred in the 
biweekly Velcade arm. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 14% of cycles and only among subjects 
in the biweekly arm. The two treatment arms could not be compared statistically; however, the investigators 
concluded  that  the  biweekly  schedule  seems  to  lead  to  better  efficacy  results  than  the  weekly  schedule 
(CR/CRu rate, 90% versus 79%, respectively). However the peripheral neuropathy of the biweekly schedule 
in combination with vincristine was considered too high.  
The MAH also provided an exploratory post-hoc analysis of LYM-3002 evaluating the impact of Velcade dose 
intensity on OS in newly diagnosed MCL patients receiving VcR-CAP. For this analysis, Velcade dose intensity 
Velcade  
Assessment report  
EMA/74029/2015 
Page 11/58 
 
  
(total Velcade dose received per cycle) during Cycles 1–6 was calculated in Study LYM-3002. The median 
value was selected as a cut-off for dichotomization of patients to be included in lower or higher (<4.6 vs ≥4.6 
mg/m2/cycle) dose intensity groups. Overall survival was then compared between groups, among subjects 
who  had  received  ≥6  cycles  of  Velcade  (n=181).  A  landmark  analysis  (from  the  end  of  Cycle  6)  was 
performed. From the landmark, OS was found to be significantly longer in the higher (n=93) versus lower 
(n=88) Velcade dose intensity group in univariate analysis (HR 0.43 [0.23, 0.80]; p=0.0059).  
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study LYM-3002 
Methods 
Study LYM-3002 was a phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter, prospective study comparing the 
efficacy and safety of Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Velcade, and Prednisone (VcR-CAP) 
versus Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone (R-CHOP) in subjects with 
newly diagnosed MCL who were ineligible or not considered for bone marrow transplantation. 
Study participants 
Inclusion criteria 
The study included adult patients with MCL (stage II, III or IV) evidenced by histology and either expression 
of cyclin D1 (in association with CD20 and CD5) or evidence of t(11;14) such as cytogenetics, FISH or PCR. 
Patients must have had at least 1 measureable site of disease, no prior therapies for MCL and be assessed 
by the treating physician (Amendment 2) as ineligible for bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, 
patients were required to have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status score of ≤2, absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1500 cells/µL, platelet count ≥100,000 cells/µL (or ≥75,000 cells/µL if 
thrombocytopenia was considered by the investigator to be secondary to MCL), Alanine transaminase (ALT) 
≤3 times the ULN, aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤3 times ULN, total bilirubin ≤1.5 times ULN, calculated 
creatinine clearance ≥20 mL/min.  
Female subjects were required to be post-menopausal for at least 1 year, surgically sterile, or practicing an 
effective method of birth control and had a negative serum β−hCG or urine pregnancy test at screening. They 
also agreed to continue birth control measures for at least 6 months after terminating treatment; Male 
subjects agreed to use an acceptable method of contraception. 
All subjects signed an informed consent document and, the ones of them who participated in the 
pharmacogenomics component of the study, an informed consent form (ICF) for pharmacogenomics 
research. Acquisition of tumor sample collections was required for all subjects (when available); all other 
sample collections were optional. 
Exclusion criteria 
Patients were excluded if they had: prior treatment with Velcade, antineoplastic (including unconjugated

hydroxybenzoates; known anaphylaxis or immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity to murine proteins 
or to any component of rituximab; serious medical condition (eg, cardiac failure [New York Heart Association 
Class III or IV, or left ventricular ejection fraction {LVEF} <50%], active peptic ulceration, or uncontrolled 
diabetes mellitus), or psychiatric illness; concurrent treatment with another investigational agent. 
If a subject received doxorubicin for any condition other than MCL, the maximum dose and exposure 
received prior to entry into this study may not have exceeded 150 mg/m2. A short course (maximum of 10 
days; ≤100 mg/day) of prednisone or equivalent steroids was allowed to treat symptoms in subjects with 
advanced disease who entered the Screening Phase and were awaiting randomization. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomised in ratio 1:1 to receive VcR CAP or R CHOP for 6 cycles (1 cycle: 21 days), or 8 
cycles if a response is first documented at Cycle 6 assessment. 
VcR CAP: Velcade 1.3 mg/m2 IV on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11, in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on Day 
1, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, prednisone 100 mg/m2 
per os on Day 1 to Day 5 of a cycle. 
R CHOP: Rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on Day 1,cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, doxorubicin 50 
mg/m2 IV on Day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (maximum total of 2 mg) IV on Day 1, prednisone 100 mg/m2 
p.o. on Day 1 to Day 5 of a cycle. 
Patients may receive less therapy or deviate from the planned treatment dose and schedule due to adverse 
events. Dose or schedule re-escalations were not permitted for Velcade after modification for neuropathic 
pain or peripheral sensory neuropathy. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to determine superiority of VcR-CAP versus R-CHOP treatment, in 
terms of progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by an Independent Radiology Review Committee 
(IRC).  
Secondary objectives were to evaluate Time to Progression (TTP), Time to Next Anti-Lymphoma treatment 
(TTNT), duration of Treatment-Free Interval (TFI), Overall Response Rate (ORR), Complete Response Rate 
(CRR= CR/complete response – unconfirmed [CRu]), Overall Survival (OS), duration of response (CR, CRu, 
or partial response [PR]), time to response and rate of durable response.  
Exploratory Objectives included: identification of patient populations likely to respond to VcR-CAP or R-CHOP 
(through the evaluation of biomarker data); evaluation of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) utilizing the 
European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 
(EORTC-QLQ-C30), the European Quality of Life-5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D) and Brief Fatigue 
Inventory (BFI) instruments.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective of the study was to compare Progression-Free Survival (PFS) between patients 
treated with VcR-CAP and  R-CHOP, as assessed by IRC, defined as the interval between the date of 
randomization and the date of PD or death, whichever occurred first, using the intent-to–treat (ITT) 
population. Subjects who withdrew from the study (ie, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up) or started 
anti-neoplastic therapy without documented PD, or who died >6 months after the last disease assessment, 
or without PD before clinical cut-off were censored at the time of the last adequate (CT scan available) 
disease assessment.

Secondary efficacy objectives included: Time to Progression (TTP: duration from the date of randomization 
until the date of first documented evidence of PD or relapse for subjects who experienced CR or CRu), Time 
to Next Anti-Lymphoma treatment (TTNT: time from the date of initiation of study treatment as per protocol 
to the start date of new anti-lymphoma treatment), duration of Treatment-Free Interval (TFI: time from the 
date of last dose plus 1 day to the start date of the new treatment), Overall Response Rate (or Overall 
Radiological Response, ORR: the proportion of subjects who achieved CR, CRu, or PR relative to the 
response-evaluable population, according to the modified IWRC), Complete Response Rate (the proportion 
of subjects who achieved CR or CRu relative to the response-evaluable population), Overall Survival (OS: 
time from the date of randomization to the date of the subject’s death), duration of complete response 
(calculated from the date of initial documentation of a CR or CRu to the date of first documented evidence of 
PD or death due to PD), duration of response (calculated from the date of initial documentation of CR, Cru or 
PR to the date of first documented evidence of PD or death due to PD), time to response (from the date of 
randomization to the date of initial CR, CRu, or PR) and rate of durable response (defined as a CR, Cru or PR 
with a duration ≥6 months). 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation for the study population was based on the assumptions that the median PFS with 
R-CHOP treatment was 18 months and that VcR-CAP treatment would improve the median PFS by 40% (ie, 
from 18 to 25 months). It was estimated that 295 events (PD or death) would provide 80% power 
(alpha=0.05, 2-sided) to detect such an improvement. Assuming a 24-month accrual and 18-month 
follow-up, a total of 486 subjects was needed for the study (243 subjects per treatment group).  
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the 2 treatment groups stratified by IPI (0-1, 2, 3, and 4-5) 
and stage of disease at diagnosis (II, III, and IV). Randomization was based on two stratification factors: 
International Prognostic Index (0-1, 2, 3, and 4-5) and stage of disease at diagnosis (II, III, and IV). 
Blinding (masking) 
N/A 
Statistical methods 
The primary population for efficacy analyses was the ITT population, with sensitivity analyses performed on 
the centrally confirmed MCL population and PP populations. All statistical tests were 2-sided. The primary 
hypothesis was tested at the 0.05 significance level (overall).  The Kaplan-Meier method was used to 
estimate the distribution of the primary endpoint (PFS) for each treatment group. The primary treatment 
comparison was based on a stratified log-rank test. The hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval 
(CI) were estimated based on a stratified Cox’s model with treatment as the explanatory variable. The 
sensitivity analyses for PFS among centrally confirmed MCL subjects, for PFS without censoring subsequent 
therapy and for PFS censoring after more than 1 missing adequate disease assessment, were performed 
similarly. The unstratified log-rank test and the unstratified Cox regression model were performed as 
sensitivity analyses. 
The secondary hypotheses were tested sequentially at the nominal 0.05 significance level in the following 
order: 1) TTP; 2) TTNT; 3) CR rate (CR+CRu) and 4) OS. A secondary hypothesis was tested only if the 
primary hypothesis was rejected along with all the secondary hypotheses that preceded it. However, OS was 
to be analyzed regardless of what happened to the other endpoints in the hierarchical test.

Three interim analyses were performed during the study and the significance level at an interim analysis was 
determined by the observed number of events at the time of the interim analysis using the O’Brien-Fleming 
spending function. 
The first interim analysis was planned after the first 100 subjects had been randomized into the study in 
order to assess the safety and concordance rate of the diagnosis of MCL between central review and the 
investigator assessment of the diagnosis. The second interim analysis (review of safety data) was planned 
after 100 subjects per arm had either completed or discontinued study treatment. The third interim analysis 
(superiority and futility) was pre-specified after at least 148 events had occurred and the O’Brien-Fleming 
spending function method was used. The alpha allocated for the interim was 0.003 (2-sided) with 148 events 
and was 0.049 (2-sided) for the final analysis.

Recruitment 
The first subject was randomized on 26 May 2008 and the last on 05 December 2011. The last dose of study 
medication was given on 13 May 2012. Subjects were enrolled from 128 centers in 28 countries. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was issued 13 December 2007. There were 5 amendments to the original protocol up 
to the cut-off date of the clinical study report (CSR) analysis. 
Amendment 1 (01 October 2008: 18 subjects accrued): clarification was added that the IDMC would review 
data for interim analyses of safety, efficacy and the concordance rate of histological review; TFI added as a 
secondary objective; MRU added as an exploratory objective; subjects who withdrew could agree to provide 
information (ie, outcome of adverse events and survival status); subjects with initial response documented 
in Cycle 6 could receive 2 further cycles of therapy; central radiology review and assessments based on 
modified IWRC criteria; clarifications to definition of PFS, TTP. OS, TTNT, TFI; clarifications to definitions of 
measureable and assessable disease, criteria for response categories; ECG/ECHO/MUGA scans added to 
document baseline abnormalities; clarification that carriers of hepatitis B were allowed, but those with active 
hepatitis B or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were excluded; guidance on management of study drug 
toxicities added; defined minimum laboratory requirements at the beginning of each cycle (other than Cycle 
1) before study drug administration; clarification was added that patients for whom bone marrow 
transplantation was not available and patients who refused a transplant as frontline treatment were eligible 
for the study; additional clarifications were made to other subject inclusion/exclusion criteria, dose 
adjustments, and statistical analyses. 
Amendment 2 (26 February 2009: 74 subjects accrued): modification of inclusion criterion restricting 
enrollment to subjects deemed ineligible for transplantation as assessed by the treating physician based on 
clinical criteria (eg, age or presence of comorbidities); subjects who were eligible, but not considered for 
transplantation due to other than clinical reasons (e.g., cost or site not performing transplantation), were no 
longer eligible for the study.   
Amendment 3 (16 September 2009: 179 subjects accrued): an additional (second) interim analysis for 
safety was added to allow review of cumulative toxicity once there was sufficient exposure data; 
confirmation of MCL could be made by an independent lymphoma expert, based on local diagnostic and 
clinical information if central review of pathology specimen was impossible because of insufficient tumor 
material; review of concordance rate between central pathology review and local pathology diagnosis to be 
repeated at 50% accrual; urinalysis, other than for pregnancy, removed; clarification of PFS sensitivity 
analysis, sampling for biomarker analysis, and procedures when a subject is reported to have PD; inclusion 
of prophylaxis for herpes zoster reactivation and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for 
prevention and treatment of neutropenia/febrile neutropenia; guidance added on causality and dose 
adjustments for hematologic toxicity for study drugs added. 
Amendment 4 (23 September 2010: 315 subjects accrued). The amendment was based on the feedback 
from IDMC on the second interim analysis for safety and to provide more clarity and guidance on some 
aspects of the study. Amendment 5 (09 August 2011: 450 subjects accrued). A futility stopping guideline 
was added for the prospectively planned interim analysis.

Table 5. Disease Characteristics at Baseline; Intent-to-treat Analysis Set (Study LYM-3002) 
Based on medical monitor review of the 487 subjects in the ITT population after Amendment INT-2, 407 
subjects were ineligible for transplant due to age (60 years or older) or medical reasons, and 80 subjects 
were eligible for transplant. 
Numbers analysed 
The primary efficacy analysis set was the Intent to Treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized 
subjects (N=487). 
Secondary efficacy analyses were performed on the following sets: 
-Per-protocol Population (N=457) defined as all randomized subjects who met all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, who received at least 1 dose of study drug and underwent at least 1 post-baseline disease 
assessment (post-baseline tumor assessment by the IRC). Subjects in this population were analyzed 
according to the treatment to which they were randomized.

- Response-Evaluable Population (N=457) defined as all subjects in the ITT population, who received at least 
1 dose of study drug, had at least 1 measurable tumor mass (>1.5 cm in the longest dimension and >1.0 cm 
in the short axis) at baseline and had at least 1 post-baseline tumor assessment by IRC, before any 
subsequent anti-lymphoma treatment. 
- Biomarker Population (N[PSMB1]=271, N[PSMB5]=217, N[Ki67]=327) defined as all subjects in the ITT 
population whose biomaterial was available, who consented to participate in the biomarker and 
pharmacogenomics evaluations or future research, and had biomarker data generated for the biomarker 
evaluation. 
- Safety Population (N=482) defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
- Centrally confirmed MCL Population (N=471) defined as all the subjects who had a central pathology 
review which confirmed the local diagnosis of MCL.

Other secondary endpoints 
Based on IRC, median TTP was 490 days (16.1 months) in the R-CHOP group versus 929 days (30.5 months) 
in the VcR-CAP group (HR=0.58; p<0.001), median time to next anti-lymphoma treatment was 756 days 
(24.8 months) versus 1,353 days (44.5 months) (HR=0.50; p<0.001).  
The TFI was 624 days (20.5 months) for the R-CHOP group, compared with 1,236 days (40.6 months) for 
the VcR-CAP group (HR=0.50; p<0.001).       
The median time to initial response (CR, CRu or PR) by IRC assessment in the R-CHOP group was 50 days 
(1.6 months) compared with 42 days (1.4 months) in the VcR-CAP group (HR=1.54; p<0.001). 
Based on IRC data, the median duration of overall response, median duration of response for complete 
responders and median duration of complete response in the VcR-CAP group versus R-CHOP group were as 
follows: 1,110 days (36.5 months) versus 459 days (15.1 months); 1,282 days (42.1 months) versus 563 
days (18.5 months) and 1,282 days (42.1 months) versus 547 days (18.0 months), respectively.  
Median OS was 1,714 days (56.3 months) in the R-CHOP group and not reached in the VcR-CAP group. The 
estimated HR was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.10) (data not shown).

Pre-specified additional subgroup analyses were performed for the subset of subjects in the United States + 
Canada + Western Europe (91 subjects in total, 18.7% of enrollment, 49 into the R-CHOP group and 42 into 
the VcR-CAP group) and for the EU subpopulation (136 subjects in total, 69 in the R-CHOP arm and 67 in the 
VcR-CAP group). For the first subgroup in the R-CHOP group, 49% of subjects had an IPI score of 3 
(high-intermediate) and most (76%) had Stage IV disease. In the VcR-CAP group, 43% of subjects had an 
IPI score of 3 and 91% had Stage IV disease). The median PFS was 437 days (14.4 months) in the R-CHOP 
group and 592 days (19.4 months) in the VcR-CAP group, as IRC assessment. For the EU subgroup the 
Velcade  
Assessment report

median PFS was 13.9 months in the R-CHOP group and 22.4 months in the VcR-CAP group (IRC 
assessment). 
An ad hoc analysis has been performed for patients who underwent less than 6 cycles of VcR-CAP or 
R-CHOP: 63 subjects (R-CHOP: 31; VcR-CAP: 32) who received between 2 and 5 cycles of chemotherapy. As 
assessed by IRC, median PFS was 3.6 months for the VcR-CAP treatment group and 3.5 months for the 
R-CHOP treatment group. As assessed by investigator, median PFS was 5.7 months versus 3.5 months, 
respectively. Subjects included in this population very likely experienced some event that limited their 
exposure to between 2 and 5 cycles of treatment. 
A post hoc subgroup analysis of PFS (per IRC assessment) by MIPIb risk category (low, intermediate, and 
high) was performed for the 327 subjects (164 subjects in the R-CHOP group and 163 subjects in the 
VcR-CAP group) with available Ki-67 biomarker results. The median PFS in the low-risk MIPIb subgroup was 
504 days (16.6 months) in the R-CHOP group versus not estimable in the VcR-CAP (HR= 0.27; 95% CI: 
0.10, 0.71); in the intermediate-risk subgroup was 526 days (17.3 months) versus 1,245 days (40.9 
months), respectively (HR= 0.50; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.79); and in the high-risk subgroup was 362 days (11.9 
months) versus 408 days (13.4 months), respectively (HR= 0.86; 95% CI: 0.57, 1.31) 
Eighty-two (82) of subjects in the R-CHOP group (50%) and 84 (52%) of subjects in the VcR-CAP group 
were positive for Ki-67 (defined as Ki-67 >10%). For subjects who were Ki-67 negative, the median PFS in 
the R-CHOP group was 546 days [17.9 months] and in the VcR-CAP group was 1,245 days [40.9 months]; 
HR=0.60 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.94; p=0.024). For subjects who were Ki-67 positive, the median PFS in the 
R-CHOP group was 332 days [10.9 months] and in the VcR-CAP group was 604 days [19.8 months]; 
HR=0.59 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.88; p=0.009) (data not shown).

Supportive study 
Study M34103-053  
Study  M34103-053  was  a  phase  2,  single-arm,  open-label,  multicenter,  3-stage,  prospective  study  in 
subjects with documented relapsed or refractory MCL, conducted at 50 centers in US and Europe.  
A total of 155 patients with refractory/relapsed MCL were enrolled in this study and received single-agent 
Velcade 1.3 mg/m2 at days 1, 4, 8, 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle up to 17 cycles. All patients were reported 
to have progressed during or relapsed following 1 (54%) or 2 (42%) prior line of therapy. Over 90% of the 
patients had previously received an alkylating agent, an anthracycline (or mitoxantrone), and rituximab, 
either  in  combination  or  as  separate  agents.  More  than  one-third  of  patients  (37%)  had  received  prior 
high-intensity  chemotherapeutics,  including  Hyper-CVAD,  high-dose  cytarabine,  and  SCT,  with  30%  of 
patients having received these high-intensity regimens as their last therapy prior to receiving single-agent 
Velcade.  
The primary objective of this study was to determine if Velcade increases median TTP compared to historical 
controls in patients with MCL who have documented relapse or progression following 1 or 2 prior lines of 
antineoplastic therapy. The secondary objectives of this study included the response rate (CR/CRu/PR) to 
Velcade through the time of the first disease response evaluation, the overall CR rate (CR/CRu), the duration 
of response (DR) and the time to first response. Additional endpoints included OS and PFS.  
Median TTP across all patients in the All-treated population (ATP) was 6.7 months (Figure #) and 6.9 months 
for patients in the PP population (ie, patients with documented MCL who had received an anthracycline/ 
mitoxantrone, an alkylating agent and rituximab prior to study entry).

Figure 4 - Kaplan-Meier Curve of Time to Progression in ATP Population (Study M34103-053)  
Eleven  patients (8%) experienced CR or CRu as best response on treatment, including 9 patients with CR 
and 2 patients with CRu and an additional 34 (24%) patients experienced PR. Patients who achieved CR or 
CRu had longer TTP compared to patients in other response categories. 
With a median duration of follow-up of more than 26 months, median survival for both the ATP and the PP 
population was 23.5 months. Median survival for responders (CR+CRu+PR) was 35.4 months. At the time of 
database-lock,  62  (40%)  of  155  ATP  patients  were  alive,  including  50  (39%)  of  128  patients  in  the  PP 
population and the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 1-year survival in all patients was 69% in both populations. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study LYM-3002 was a Phase III, randomised, open-label study comparing the efficacy and safety of the 
combination of velcade, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (VcR-CAP; n=243) to 
that of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R-CHOP; n=244) in adult 
patients with previously untreated MCL (Stage II, III or IV). Patients in the VcR-CAP treatment arm received 
velcade (1.3 mg/m2; on days 1, 4, 8, 11, rest period days 12-21), rituximab 375 mg/m2 IV on day 1; 
cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV on day 1; doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1; and prednisone 100 mg/m2 
orally on day 1 through day 5 of the 21 day of velcade treatment cycle. For patients with a response first 
documented at cycle 6, two additional treatment cycles were given (see SmPC section 5.1). 
No new dose-response study has been submitted with this application. The phase 1/2 studies summarized 
have  shown  the  additive  neurotoxicity  of  vincristine  and  Velcade,  which  justified  the  replacement  of 
vincristine by Velcade in the VcR-CAP approach. While weekly Velcade led to improvement of efficacy, the 
GELA study suggested that it may be less effective than biweekly dosing, with fewer subjects achieving CR. 
In Study LYM-3002, the use of biweekly Velcade for only a brief treatment period (median 4 months) led to 
substantial improvements in long-term disease control as assessed by duration of response and time to next 
treatment.  Such  improvements  may  be  difficult  to  achieve  with  once-weekly  Velcade  treatment.  The 
selected dose and schedule of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin are based on the dosing of these agents in 
the standard R-CHOP regimen. 
Velcade  
Assessment report  
EMA/74029/2015 
Page 31/58 
 
  
 
 
 
Based on the above, the study is considered adequate with regard to drugs scheduling and dosing. Since 
blinding  was  problematic  due  to  the  different  dose  schedules  for  Velcade  and  Vincristine  the  open  label 
design of the study was acceptable. Velcade was administered exclusively by IV route; however, the sought 
indication in MCL includes both Velcade IV and SC administration. This is considered acceptable  since no 
relevant  Velcade  PK/PD  differences  were  observed  between  Velcade  administered  IV  and  SC  in  the  MM 
setting, and  no significant differences on the Velcade SC bioavailability are expected between MM and MCL 
patients. 
The study inclusion/exclusion criteria were considered appropriate to define a population of previously 
untreated MCL patients. The exclusion of stage I MCL patients was acceptable since these patients should 
receive a different, integrated therapeutic approach.  
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally well balanced between the two 
treatment arms: median patient age was 66 years, 74% were male, 66% were Caucasian and 32% Asian, 
69% of patients had a positive bone marrow aspirate and/or a positive bone marrow biopsy for MCL, 54% of 
patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of ≥ 3, and 76% had Stage IV disease (SmPC 
section 5.1). 
The validity of PFS as primary endpoint has been discussed and endorsed during the EMA scientific advice 
procedure. The choice of TTP, TTNT and TFI as secondary endpoints is deemed valid, since at present MCL 
is a chronic incurable disease, and treatment-free intervals are very valuable for the patient's quality of life. 
The estimate of ORR, CR and CR+CRu rates is also appropriate, primarily in the evaluation of the small set 
of transplant-fit patients.  
Study LYM-3002 was in conclusion adequately designed to investigate the superior efficacy of VcR-CAP in 
previously untreated MCL patients unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint was met in this study. Results from study LYM-3002 showed a clear 
superiority of VcR-CAP over R-CHOP in untreated MCL patients with regard to PFS by IRC assessment (24.7 
vs 14.4 months respectively, HR 0.63, 95% [CI 0.50-0.79]; p<0.001). There was a good concordance 
between IRC and investigator assessment of PFS and the findings of primary analysis were supported by all 
relevant sensitivity analyses. Thus, the efficacy results were considered robust.  
Secondary endpoints including time to progression, time to new treatment, treatment-free interval, 
complete response rates, duration of response and overall response rate supported the primary efficacy 
endpoint and favoured the VcR-CAP arm compared to the R-CHOP arm. 
During the evaluation, the CHMP raised a major objection about the indication needing to be further 
discussed, with reference to the patients who were ineligible to transplantation. Further to amendments 1 
and 2 of the original protocol, the majority of patients included were ineligible to transplantation for medical 
reasons and only 80 subjects by medical monitor assessment (42 subjects in the R-CHOP group and 38 
subjects in the VcR-CAP group) would have been considered suitable for transplantation out of this trial. In 
the small transplant-fit population, CR (52.8%) and CR+CRu (66.7%) rates observed in VcR-CAP arm were 
lower comparing to those obtained with more intensive chemotherapy regimens, according to recent 
scientific literature, despite the favourable baseline characteristics (18). The broad indication initially 
proposed by the MAH: ”adult patients with untreated mantle cell lymphoma”, which could possibly include 
transplant-fit patients, was therefore not justified considering also that feasibility of bone marrow 
transplantation procedures after VcR-CAP was not specifically addressed by the study. Taking into account 
that patients should always receive the best available therapy and that at present there is no evidence that 
VcR-CAP should be preferred to more intensive treatments (i.e. R-hyperCVAD/HD-Cytarabine plus 
Methotrexate) in the first-line setting, VcR-CAP can be considered nonetheless a valuable treatment option 
Velcade  
Assessment report  
EMA/74029/2015 
Page 32/58 
 
  
 
for patients not suitable for intensive chemotherapy regimens. To reflect this, the indication (see SmPC, 
section 4.1) has been restricted to treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell 
lymphoma who are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Overall, the baseline demographics and prognostic factors were well balanced although some imbalances 
were noted. It seems unlikely that such imbalances should influence the overall very convincing efficacy 
results. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Study LYM-3002 has provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of bortezomib in combination with 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone in terms of the primary endpoint PFS compared 
with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone in adult patients with previously 
untreated mantle cell lymphoma. The combination with bortezomib resulted in a clinically meaningful and 
statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of PFS.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The evaluation of safety of the VcR-CAP combination derives from the studies reported in Table 11. 
Table 11 Studies Included in the Summary of Clinical Safety Analysis 
Data from LYM-3002 and LYM-2034 were pooled by treatment group (R-CHOP or VcR-CAP), while data from 
Study M34103-053 (Velcade monotherapy) were presented alongside the pooled data. 
Study  LYM-2034  enrolled  subjects  with  previously  untreated  non-GCB  subtype  DLBCL.  The  maximum 
allowable number of treatment cycles was up to 6 cycles. Velcade administration and regimen of the 2 arms 
were the same as in Study LYM-3002.

Adverse Events of special interest 
Hepatitis B 
In the pooled analysis 4 (1%) subjects in the pooled R-CHOP group and 2 (1%) subjects in the VcR-CAP 
group experienced a hepatitis B event. With the exception of 1 subject in the pooled R-CHOP group, all cases 
of hepatitis B occurred in study LYM-3002. Three subjects (2 in the R-CHOP group and 1 in the VcR-CAP 
group) died due to hepatitis B infection. In study LYM-3002 for the 191 subjects with hepatitis B testing at 
baseline hepatitis B reactivations were seen in 3 subjects. In the 291 subjects (R-CHOP: 152; VcR-CAP: 139) 
without Hepatitis B testing at baseline in Study LYM-3002, events of Hepatitis B were seen in 2 subjects not 
treated with prophylactic anti-virals: one subject in the R-CHOP group and one in the VcR-CAP group. 
The overall incidence of Hepatitis B infection in Study LYM-3002 was 0.8% in the VcR-CAP group (incidence 
of Hepatitis B reactivation: 8.3% [1/12] for those not administered antiviral prophylaxis) and 1.2% in the 
R-CHOP group (incidence of Hepatitis B reactivation: 0% [0/4] for those administered antiviral prophylaxis). 
Three subjects (2 in the R-CHOP group and 1 in the VcR-CAP group) died due to Hepatitis B infection during 
treatment; of these, 2 subjects (1 in each group) had received antiviral prophylaxis. 
Cardiac events  
Cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormality adverse events were reported in 11% of subjects in the pooled 
R-CHOP group and 10% in VcR-CAP group. Five (2%) subjects in the pooled R-CHOP treatment group and 
11 (3%) subjects in the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group experienced a cardiac disorder adverse event; 
cardiac failure was experienced by no subject in the pooled R-CHOP treatment group and 5 (2%) subjects in 
the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group. In the Study LYM-3002 myocardial ischemia was reported in 3 
subjects (1.3%) in the VcR-CAP treatment group. 
Peripheral Neuropathies 
Subjects in the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group experienced peripheral neuropathy adverse events  in 31% 
of cases versus 27% of R-CHOP group. Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy was reported for 8% of 
subjects in the R-CHOP treatment group and 17% of subjects in the VcR-CAP treatment group. Grade 3 or 
higher peripheral neuropathy was reported for 4% of subjects in the R-CHOP treatment group and 7% of 
subjects in the VcR-CAP treatment group. Two (1%) subjects in the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group 
reported serious peripheral neuropathy versus none in the pooled R-CHOP treatment group, and 6 (2%) 
subjects in the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group discontinued all study treatment due to a peripheral 
neuropathy compared with 1 (<1%) subject in the pooled RCHOP treatment group. Velcade discontinuation 
due to peripheral neuropathy occurred in  5% of subjects in the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group versus a 
3% vincristine discontinuation in the pooled R-CHOP treatment group. Subjects in Study M34103-053 
experienced all grade peripheral neuropathy adverse events in 56% of cases versus 31% of the pooled 
VcR-CAP treatment group. Grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy was reported in 32% of subjects in the 
VELCADE monotherapy treatment group; Grade 3 and higher in 13% of subjects. Median time to onset of 
any grade peripheral neuropathy event was 49.5 days (range 1 to 197). Nineteen percent of peripheral 
neuropathies occurred in VcR-CAP patients and 25% in R-CHOP patients were not resolved. Median time to 
improvement of peripheral neuropathy in the pooled analysis was 145 days (95% CI: 86, 196) in R-CHOP 
patients versus 46 days (95% CI: 28, 62) in VcR-CAP patients, and median time to resolution was 168 days 
(95% CI: 119, 247) in the R-CHOP group versus 91 days (95% CI: 50, 144) in the VcR-CAP group. 
The results of the assessment of peripheral neuropathies in Study LYM-3002 demonstrated similar rates of 
peripheral neuropathy adverse events (R-CHOP: 29%; VcR-CAP 30%), with most of these considered 
related to study treatment in both treatment groups (R-CHOP: 27%; VcR-CAP 30%). Grade 2 or higher 
Velcade  
Assessment report

peripheral neuropathy adverse events occurred in 9% of subjects in the R-CHOP group and 18% of subjects 
in the VcR-CAP group. Grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy was reported in 4% of subjects in the 
R-CHOP treatment group and 8% of subjects in the VcR CAP treatment group. Two (1%) subjects in the 
VcR-CAP treatment group reported serious peripheral neuropathy adverse events versus none in the 
R-CHOP treatment group, and 4 (2%) subjects in the VcR-CAP treatment group discontinued treatment due 
to a peripheral neuropathy compared with 1 subject (<1%) in the R-CHOP treatment group. 
Thrombocytopenia and Bleeding Events 
In study LYM–3002 Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia occurred in 57% of subjects in the VcR-CAP group and in 
5.8% of subjects in the R-CHOP group. In the pooled analysis Grade ≥3 thrombocytopenia occurred in 52% 
of subjects in the pooled VcR-CAP group and in 5% of the pooled R-CHOP group. Sixteen (5%) subjects in 
the  pooled  R-CHOP  treatment  group  and  24  (8%)  subjects  in  the  pooled  VcR-CAP  treatment  group 
experienced a bleeding event of any grade. The majority of all-grade bleeding adverse events occurred in 
Study LYM-3002, in which bleeding events were reported for 12 (5%) subjects in the R-CHOP treatment 
group and 15 (6.3%) subjects in the VcR-CAP treatment group. Grade 3 or higher bleeding events were 
reported  for  3  (1.2%)  subjects  in  the  R-CHOP  treatment  group  and  4  (1.7%)  subjects  in  the  VcR-CAP 
treatment group. In study LYM–3002 the incidence of all grade bleeding events (5% and 6%, respectively) 
and Grade 3 or higher bleeding events (3 subjects versus 4 subjects) was low and similar in both groups. No 
subject died in this study due to a bleeding adverse event or due to a bleeding event related to study drug. 
In the VcR-CAP group, 22.5% of patients received platelet transfusions compared to 2.9% of patients in the 
R-CHOP group. 
Neutropenia and Infection Events 
In the pooled VcR-CAP group the incidence of infections was 59% versus 44% of R-CHOP group (in study 
LYM–3002: 60% and 46% of subjects respectively). The most frequently reported infection adverse event 
was pneumonia (R-CHOP: 7%; VcR-CAP: 11%). In the pooled VcR-CAP group Grade ≥3 infection events and 
serious adverse events were reported in 20% and 17% of subjects versus 13 and 12% of the pooled R-CHOP 
treatment  group,  respectively.  Pneumonia/lung  infection  was  the  most  commonly  reported  Grade  3  or 
higher event in both treatment groups. Antibacterials for systemic use were used in 70% of subjects in the 
R-CHOP group versus 79 in the VcR-CAP group. 
Eight (3%) subjects in the pooled R-CHOP treatment group and 7 (2%) subjects in the pooled VcR-CAP 
group  had  infection  adverse  events  leading  to  death.  In  the  pooled  R-CHOP  arm  2  subjects  died  of 
pneumonia, 2 of hepatitis B, 1 of septic shock, 1 of sepsis, 1 of bronchopneumonia, 1 of non-specified viral 
hepatitis. In the pooled VcR-CAP arm 4 subjects died of pneumonia, 2 of septic shock, 1 of hepatitis, 1 of 
non-specified lung infection, 1 of sepsis.  
In the Study LYM- 3002 15% of subjects in the R-CHOP group and 21% of subjects in the VcR-CAP group 
experienced a Grade 3 or higher infection (regardless of neutropenia); in 3 subjects in the R-CHOP group 
and 4 subjects in the VcR-CAP group the infection adverse event resulted in death within 30 days of the last 
dose of study medication. Infection adverse events were considered as serious in 29 subjects (12%) in the 
R-CHOP group and 42 subjects (18%) in the VcR-CAP group. The use of colony stimulating factors during 
study  treatment  (61%  in  the  R-CHOP  group  and  78%  in  the  VcR-CAP  group)  was  consistent  with  the 
incidence of Grade 3 or higher neutropenia (67% in the R-CHOP group and 85% in the VcR-CAP group). In 
the  3  groups  that  required  CSF  support  –  primary  prophylactic,  secondary  prophylactic,  and 
non-prophylactic – there was a trend for a lower rate of cycle delays (50%, 59%, and 65%, respectively) 
with  prophylactic  use  of  CSF,  and  a  similar  need  for  Velcade  dose  modifications  (96%,  95%,  and  98%, 
respectively).

Deaths 
The summary of deaths and causes of death are summarized in Table17. 
Table 17 Summary of Deaths and Causes of Death; Safety Analysis Set (Studies: LYM-3002, 
LYM-2034, and M34103-053) 
In the Study LYM3002, death incidence was 36% in the R-CHOP treatment group and 29% in the VcR-CAP 
group; in R–CHOP arm 23% of patients died to disease progression as compared to VcR-CAP arm (18.%). In 
both arms, fatal cases occurred mostly after 60 days of treatment. Adverse events were reported as the 
cause of death for 18 subjects (7%) in the R-CHOP group and 17 subjects (7%) in the VcR-CAP group. 
Twelve subjects, 7 (3%) in the R-CHOP group and 5 (2%) in the VcR-CAP group, died due to a drug-related 
adverse event that occurred within 30 days of the last dose of study treatment mainly due to cardiac or 
infection-related causes. Fourteen subjects (6%) in the R-CHOP group and 11 subjects (5%) in the VcR-CAP 
group died within 30 days of last dose, most due to adverse events, 12 (5%) and 8 (3%), respectively. 
Seven subjects in the R-CHOP group died due to a drug-related adverse event: of infectious origin (3), of 
cardiac origin (2), due to hypotension, diarrhea and renal failure (1), and tumor lysis syndrome (1). Five 
subjects in the VcR-CAP group died due to a drug-related adverse event of infectious origin (3), of cardiac 
origin (1) and due to pulmonary embolism (1).

Laboratory findings 
The proportions of subjects with Grade 3 or higher laboratory values were as follows: leukocytes: 76% 
R-CHOP versus 88% VcR-CAP (Grade 3 or higher adverse events of leukopenia were 29% versus 44%, 
respectively); lymphocytes: 59% R-CHOP versus 86% VcR-CAP (Grade 3 or higher adverse events of 
lymphopenia were 9% versus 28%, respectively); hemoglobin: 19% R-CHOP versus 20% VcR-CAP (Grade 
3 or higher adverse events of anemia were 14% versus 15%, respectively); supportive treatment with RBC 
transfusions: 17% in the R-CHOP group and 22% in the VcR-CAP group; supportive treatment with 
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: 9% in the R-CHOP group and 10% in the VcR-CAP group. Neutrophils: 
83% R-CHOP versus 89% VcR-CAP (Grade 3 or higher adverse events of febrile neutropenia were 14% and 
15%, respectively); supportive treatment with colony-stimulating factors was 78% in the VcR-CAP group 
and 61% in the R-CHOP group. 
During study treatment, Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities were reported for 5% or more subjects 
in either pooled treatment group for the following: hypoalbuminemia (R-CHOP: 13%; VcR-CAP: 18%); 
hyperglycemia (R-CHOP: 15%; VcR-CAP: 12%); hypocalcemia (R-CHOP: 11%; VcR-CAP: 16%); 
hyperkalemia (R-CHOP: 10%; VcR-CAP: 7%); hypokalemia (R-CHOP: 6%; VcR-CAP: 10%); ALT (R-CHOP: 
6%; VcR-CAP: 3%); hyponatremia (R-CHOP: 3%; VcR-CAP: 6%). For all other clinical chemistry 
assessments, the difference in incidence of Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities was 3% or less 
between the pooled R-CHOP and pooled VcR-CAP treatment groups.  
Safety in special populations 
Adverse events by sex 
Women in both pooled treatment groups experienced higher rates of Grade 4 adverse events compared with 
men (R-CHOP: men: 63%, women: 74%; VcR-CAP: men: 74%, women: 85%), the large majority of which 
were hematologic adverse events, primarily neutropenia, and in the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group, 
thrombocytopenia. At the SOC level for all-grade adverse events, in the pooled analysis women experienced 
10% or higher rates of Gastrointestinal disorders (men 57%, women 67%) and Skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders (men 26%, women 39%). In the pooled R-CHOP group women experienced higher rates of 
Nervous system disorders (men 44%, women 55%) and Metabolism and nutrition disorders (men 25%, 
women 37%). 
Adverse events by race 
In the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group, non-white subjects experienced higher rates of Grade 3 or higher 
adverse events (white: 88%; non-white 98%) and Grade 4 or higher adverse events (white: 72%, 
non-white: 89%). A similar trend was found in the pooled R-CHOP treatment group for Grade 3 or higher 
adverse events (white: 84%; non-white: 90%) and Grade 4 or higher adverse events (white: 63%; 
non-white: 74%). Non-white subjects in the pooled R-CHOP treatment group also experienced higher 
incidence of serious adverse events (white: 27%; nonwhite: 40%); a finding not observed in the pooled 
VcR-CAP treatment group (white: 38%; nonwhite: 37%). White subjects experienced higher rates of 
all-grade and higher-grade peripheral neuropathy (R-CHOP: white 30.6%, non-white: 18.2%; VcR-CAP: 
white 36.0%, non-white 21.6%). 
Adverse events by age 
In the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group, subjects >65 years old experienced 5% or higher incidence of 
serious adverse events compared with younger subjects (≤65 years: 33%; >65 years: 44%). Older and 
Velcade  
Assessment report

younger subjects experienced similar rates of Grade 3 or higher adverse events; however, older subjects 
experienced a 5% or greater incidence of Grade 4 or higher adverse events (≤65 years: 73%; >65 years: 
83%). Older subjects also experienced a 5% or higher rate of treatment discontinuation compared with 
younger subjects (≤65 years: 6%; >65 years: 11%). In the pooled R-CHOP treatment group, in addition to 
experiencing a 5% or greater rate of serious adverse events (≤65 years: 27%; >65 years: 35%), older 
subjects reported a higher rate of Grade 4 or higher adverse events (≤65 years: 61%; >65 years: 72%) and 
treatment discontinuation (≤65 years: 3%; >65 years: 9%). Eighty-four percent of subjects ≤65 years 
experienced Grade 3 or higher adverse events compared with 88% of subjects >65 years old. Older (>65 
years) subjects treated with VcR-CAP also experienced a higher incidence of adverse events leading to death 
(9%) compared to younger subjects (3%). Most of the Grade 5 adverse events leading to death among older 
(>65 years) subjects treated with VcR-CAP were respiratory, infectious or cardiac in nature; A similar 
pattern was also observed in the R-CHOP group. 
Adverse events by region 
In the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group, differences of 5% or greater were noted for incidence of serious 
adverse events (EU: 50%; USA/Canada: 22%; ROW: 33%), Grade 3 and higher adverse events (EU: 93%; 
USA/Canada: 78%; ROW: 92%), and Grade 4 and higher adverse events (EU: 79%; USA/Canada: 56%; 
ROW: 78%). In the pooled R-CHOP treatment group, differences of 5% or greater were noted for incidence 
of serious adverse events (EU: 27%; USA/Canada: 9%; ROW: 34%), Grade 3 and higher adverse events 
(EU: 83%; USA/Canada: 82%; ROW: 88%), Grade 4 and higher adverse events (EU: 62%; USA/Canada: 
55%; ROW: 69%), and discontinuation due to adverse events (EU: 6%; USA/Canada: 0%;  ROW: 6%). 
Renal impairment 
In the Study LYM-3002, in the VcR-CAP treatment group, the incidence of Grade 4 adverse events was 81% 
for subjects with impaired renal function versus 71% for those with normal renal function. For subjects in the 
R-CHOP group the incidence of Grade 4 adverse events was 66% for subjects with impaired renal function 
and 53% for subjects with normal renal function. 
Hepatic impairment 
In the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group subjects with impaired liver function had 5% or higher rates of 
Grade 3 or higher adverse events (<1.5xULN: 92%; ≥1.5xULN: 80%) and discontinuation due to adverse 
events (<1.5xULN: 8%; ≥1.5xULN: 20%). Also In pooled R-CHOP treatment group subjects with impaired 
liver function had 5% or higher rates of all grade adverse events (<1.5xULN: 99%; ≥1.5xULN: 94%), 
serious adverse events (<1.5xULN: 31%; ≥1.5xULN: 24%), and Grade 4 and higher adverse events 
(<1.5xULN: 66%; ≥1.5xULN: 77%). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No safety data related to drug-drug interactions have been submitted. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Nineteen (6%) subjects in the pooled R-CHOP treatment group and 27 (8%) of subjects in the pooled 
VcR-CAP treatment group experienced adverse events that led to permanent discontinuation of all study 
treatment. For the pooled treatment groups adverse events in the Nervous system disorders (R-CHOP: 4 
[2%]; VcR-CAP: 9 [3%]), Blood and lymphatic system disorders (R-CHOP: 2 [1%]; VcR-CAP: 7 [2%]), and 
Infections and infestations (R-CHOP: 6 [2%]; VcR-CAP: 7 [2%]) system organ classes were identified most

often as leading to treatment discontinuation.  
In the Study LYM-3002 a dose withholding has been reported in 25 subjects in the R-CHOP arm and in 205 
subjects in VcR-CAP arm. The most common adverse events that led to a dose withholding were peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (7 subjects; 3%) in the R-CHOP group and thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and 
neutropenia in VcR-CAP. In particular, 180 subjects (75%) had a dose of VELCADE withheld (most 
commonly for neutropenia [143 subjects; 60%]. Eighty (33%) of the subjects in the R-CHOP group and 121 
(50%) of the subjects in the VcR-CAP group experienced at least 1 adverse events that led to a cycle delay. 
Post marketing experience 
The review of post marketing experience (to identify cases in which Velcade was administered to patients 
with MCL alone or in combination) included retrieval of data from the following report types (number of 
cases) in the safety database: compassionate use (3), literature spontaneous (76), post-marketing survey 
(25), regulatory authority (7), and spontaneous (295). The database search criteria included any patient 
who was reported to have received Velcade for the treatment of MCL, in addition to any patient who reported 
a concurrent condition or past medical history of MCL and who received Velcade treatment for any indication. 
The search retrieved 406 cases reporting a total of 1,022 adverse events. The adverse events were reported 
from 29 countries, with the majority reported from the United States (170 [42%]), Japan (49 [12%]), and 
Switzerland (30 [7%]), in which Velcade is authorised in the relapsed/refractory setting. The most common 
adverse events were neuropathy peripheral (59 of 1,022 events [5.8%]), thrombocytopenia (51 events 
[5.0%]), platelet count decreased (45 events [4.4%]), disease progression (30 events [2.9%]), fatigue (22 
events [2.2%]), and diarrhea (21 events [2.1%]). All other adverse events occurred at a reporting 
frequency of <2%. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of VcR-CAP safety derives primarily from the pooled analysis of the 2 studies LYM-3002 and 
LYM-2034. Data from Study M34103-053 were only partially informative due to the different schedule and 
prolonged administration of Velcade in monotherapy compared to the VcR-CAP regimen. 
The safety profile of 240 patients treated with Velcade at 1.3 mg/m2 in combination with rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VcR-CAP) versus 242 patients treated with rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [R-CHOP], was relatively consistent to that 
observed in patients with multiple myeloma with main differences described below. Additional adverse drug 
reactions identified associated with the use of the combination therapy (VcR-CAP) were hepatitis B infection 
(< 1%) and myocardial ischaemia (1.3%). The similar incidences of these events in both treatment arms 
indicated that these adverse drug reactions are not attributable to Velcade alone. Notable differences in the 
MCL patient population as compared to patients in the multiple myeloma studies were a ≥ 5% higher 
incidence of the haematological adverse reactions (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, 
lymphopenia), peripheral sensory neuropathy, hypertension, pyrexia, pneumonia, stomatitis, and hair 
disorders (See SmPC section 4.8). 
Neurotoxicity is a known adverse reaction of bortezomib and a frequent event in the treatment of patients 
with multiple myeloma. Neurotoxicity is also a known adverse reaction of Vincristine. Peripheral sensory 
neuropathy was confirmed to be associated with Velcade and Vincristine treatment. Vincristine-related 
neuropathy is characterized by an earlier onset compared to Velcade-related neuropathy (49.5 vs 81.5 days 
respectively). This finding confirmed that Velcade-related neuropathy is dependent on the cumulative 
Velcade dose. Usually more prolonged Velcade exposures, as shown in Study M34103-053, are associated 
with higher rates of neuropathy. Velcade-related neuropathy is also more often reversible than 
Velcade  
Assessment report  
EMA/74029/2015 
Page 43/58 
 
  
 
Vincristine-related neuropathy: 19% of peripheral neuropathies occurred in VcR-CAP patients vs 25% in 
R-CHOP patients were not resolved at the end of follow-up. Velcade discontinuation due to peripheral 
neuropathy occurred in 5% of subjects in the pooled VcR-CAP treatment group while Vincristine 
discontinuation in the pooled R-CHOP treatment group was slightly less frequent (3%). Section 4.4 of the 
SmPC includes a warning that treatment with Velcade is very commonly associated with peripheral 
neuropathy, which is predominantly sensory. However, cases of severe motor neuropathy with or without 
sensory peripheral neuropathy have been reported. In addition, the SmPC provides a recommendation that 
patients should be carefully monitored for symptoms of neuropathy and those patients experiencing new or 
worsening peripheral neuropathy may require the dose and schedule of Velcade to be modified (See sections 
4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC and Risk Management Plan). 
In the VcR-CAP arm, one of the most common haematologic toxicity was transient thrombocytopenia. 
Platelets were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of Velcade treatment and typically recovered to baseline by the 
next cycle. The mean platelet count nadir measured was 50% in the MCL study (See SmPC section 4.4). 
In study LYM-3002, there was a higher incidence (56.7% versus 5.8%) of Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia in 
the Velcade treatment group (VcR-CAP) as compared to the non-Velcade treatment group (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [R-CHOP]). The two treatment groups were 
similar with regard to the overall incidence of all-grade bleeding events (6.3% in the VcR-CAP group and 
5.0% in the R-CHOP group) as well as Grade 3 and higher bleeding events (VcR-CAP: 4 patients [1.7%]; 
R-CHOP: 3 patients [1.2%]). In the VcR-CAP group, 22.5% of patients received platelet transfusions 
compared to 2.9% of patients in the R-CHOP group (SmPC section 4.4). In order to improve the 
haemorrhagic risk control section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated to include that platelet transfusion for 
the treatment of thrombocytopenia should be considered when clinically appropriate.  
In patients with MCL, transient neutropenia that was reversible between cycles was observed, with no 
evidence of cumulative neutropenia. Neutrophils were lowest at Day 11 of each cycle of Velcade treatment 
and typically recovered to baseline by the next cycle. In study LYM-3002, colony stimulating factor support 
was given to 78% of patients in the VcR-CAP arm and 61% of patients in the R-CHOP arm. Since patients 
with neutropenia are at increased risk of infections, they should be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
infection and treated promptly. Granulocyte colony stimulating factors may be administered for 
haematologic toxicity according to local standard practice. Prophylactic use of granulocyte colony 
stimulating factors should be considered in case of repeated delays in cycle administration (See SmPC 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
As for neutropenia, in spite of an intensive use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and antibacterial 
agents for prophylaxis, subjects in the VcR-CAP treatment group were nevertheless more likely to 
experience higher-grade infective adverse events compared to subjects in the R-CHOP treatment group. The 
increased number of pneumonia in the VcR-CAP group was of concern. However the MAH conducted an 
internal analysis in this patient population based on health insurance claims databases that provided further 
evidence that pneumonia is a well-recognized medical complication in patients with newly diagnosed MCL 
often treated with immunosuppressive medication. In addition, since the majority of the pneumonia events 
in study occurred within the context of neutropenia, the use of colony stimulating factors is strongly 
supported whenever necessary during the treatment of patients with MCL. Instructions regarding the use of 
colony stimulating factors in the SmPC section 4.2 have been included and the MAH will continue to monitor 
pneumonia cases as part of the important identified risk of “Neutropenia and neutropenia with associated 
infection” (see Risk Management Plan). 
In study LYM 3002, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with fatal outcomes occurred in 0.8% (n=2) of patients 
in the non -Velcade treatment group (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and 
prednisone; R CHOP) and 0.4% (n=1) of patients receiving Velcade in combination with rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VcR CAP). The overall incidence of hepatitis B infections 
Velcade  
Assessment report  
EMA/74029/2015 
Page 44/58 
 
  
was similar in patients treated with VcR CAP or with R CHOPS (0.8% vs 1.2% respectively). When rituximab 
is used in combination with Velcade, HBV screening must always be performed in patients at risk of infection 
with HBV before initiation of treatment. Carriers of hepatitis B and patients with a history of hepatitis B must 
be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection during and following rituximab 
combination treatment with Velcade. Antiviral prophylaxis should be considered. Refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics of rituximab for more information (See SmPC, section 4.4). 
In study LYM 3002, the incidence of herpes zoster infection was 6.7% in the VcR CAP arm and 1.2% in the 
R CHOP arm (See SmC section 4.4). Antiviral prophylaxis was administered to 137 of 240 patients (57%) in 
the VcR-CAP arm. The incidence of herpes zoster among patients in the VcR-CAP arm was 10.7% for patients 
not administered antiviral prophylaxis compared to 3.6% for patients administered antiviral prophylaxis 
(See SmPC section 4.8). 
10.7% and 5.4% of patients in the VcR-CAP arm were in the range 65-74 and ≥75 years of age, respectively. 
Although in patients aged ≥ 75 years both VcR-CAP and R-CHOP were less tolerated,  the serious adverse 
event rate in the VcR-CAP groups was 68%, compared to 42% in the R-CHOP group (See SmPC section 4.8). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The overall safety of the VcR-CAP combination is consistent with the known single safety profiles of Velcade, 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone. Additional adverse drug reactions identified 
associated with the use of the combination therapy (VcR-CAP) were hepatitis B infection and myocardial 
ischaemia.

Pharmacovigilance plan 
A survey is being conducted by the MAH within 18 months of the launch of the VELCADE 3.5 mg new dual 
route of administration (subcutaneous and intravenous). The survey targeted HCPs and other specialised 
personnel involved in the prescription, dispensing, and preparation and/or administration of VELCADE, and 
entailed questions regarding the utility and effectiveness of various tools provided as part of the educational 
materials. 
The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that routine pharmacovigilance is 
sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product. 
The PRAC also considered that the study in the post-authorisation development plan is sufficient to monitor 
the effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

SmPC: Labelled in Section 4.8 
Undesirable Effects. 
The SmPC, Section 4.4 Special 
Warnings and Precautions for Use, 
warns that in addition to 
peripheral neuropathy, there may 
be a contribution of autonomic 
neuropathy to some adverse 
reactions such as postural 
hypotension and severe 
constipation with ileus. 
The SmPC, Sections 4.4 and 4.8, 
states that in studies in patients 
with relapsed multiple myeloma 
treated with VELCADE and in 
patients with previously untreated 
MCL treated with VELCADE in 
combination with 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and prednisone 
(VcR-CAP), transient 
thrombocytopenia was one of the 
most common haematologic 
toxicities. Platelets were lowest at 
Day 11 of each cycle of VELCADE 
treatment and typically recovered 
to baseline by the next cycle. In 
MCL 
patients, 22.5% of patients 
receiving VcR-CAP received 
platelet transfusions compared to 
2.9% of patients receiving 
R-CHOP. Platelet transfusion for 
the treatment of 
thrombocytopenia should be 
considered when clinically 
appropriate. 
Dose toxicity management for 
thrombocytopenia within the 
different indications (MCL and 
multiple myeloma) are slightly 
different depending on the 
indication. 
The SmPC Section 4.2 provides 
guidance on all dose 
modifications. 
When VELCADE is given in 
combination with other 
chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products, appropriate dose

the event of toxicities, according 
to the recommendations in the 
respective SmPCs. For MCL 
patients receiving VcR-CAP, the 
SmPC Section 4.2 provides 
guidance on dose modifications of 
cyclophosphamide and 
doxorubicin for haematologic 
toxicities. 
The SmPC Section 4.9 (Overdose) 
states that overdosage more than 
twice the recommended dose has 
been associated with acute onset 
of thrombocytopenia with fatal 
outcomes. 
The SmPC Section 4.2 provides 
pretreatment criteria and dose 
modification guidance, including 
adjustments for ≥ Grade 3 
neutropenia with fever and Grade 
4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 
days. 
The SmPC, Sections 4.4 and 4.8, 
states that in studies in patients 
with relapsed multiple myeloma 
treated 
with VELCADE and in patients with 
previously untreated MCL treated 
with VELCADE in combination with 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, and prednisone 
(VcR-CAP), transient neutropenia 
was one of the most common 
haematologic toxicities. 
When VELCADE is given in 
combination with other 
chemotherapeutic medicinal 
products, appropriate dose 
reductions for these medicinal 
products should be considered in 
the event of toxicities, according 
to the recommendations in the 
respective SmPCs. For MCL 
patients receiving VcR-CAP, the 
SmPC Section 4.2 provides 
guidance on dose modifications of 
cyclophosphamide and

disorders 
Medication/Dispensing errors 
serious adverse reaction 
uncommonly reported during 
treatment with VELCADE. 
As stated in Section 4.3 of the 
SmPC, the use of VELCADE is 
contraindicated in patients with 
pericardial disease. The SmPC, 
Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects, 
identifies pericarditis as adverse 
reactions based on reports from 
postmarketing sources. 
In Section 4.4 of the SmPC, 
managing physicians are advised 
to monitor patients regularly for 
any new or worsening 
neurological symptoms or signs 
that may be 
suggestive of PML, and refer 
appropriately. 
The SmPC, Section 4.4 Special 
Warnings and Precautions for Use 
warns that isolated cases of 
QT-prolongation have been 
reported during treatment with 
VELCADE. 
Arrhythmia and ventricular 
dysfunction are identified as 
uncommon adverse drug 
reactions on the basis of 
postmarketing reports in 
Section 4.8 (Undesirable Effects) 
of the SmPC.

Subcutaneous administration 
The proposed SmPC, Section 6.6 
Special Precautions for Disposal 
and Other Handling, provides 
instructions for HCPs on 
reconstitution of the 10 mL vial of 
VELCADE for either IV or SC 
injection. 
Additionally, warnings regarding 
the danger of intrathecal 
administration are included in 
Sections 4.2, 4.4 and

Confusion with administering the 
incorrect regimens in the 
transplant induction setting. 
Refer to the proposed SmPC 
(Sections 4.2 and 4.8) for the 
correct use of the 2 regimens 
(VELCADE with dexamethasone 
and with dexamethasone and 
thalidomide) and for additional 
information concerning ADRs. 
Proposed actions/components and 
rationale include: 
The company will ensure proper 
training of all MSLs on the 
different VELCADE treatment 
schedules approved for transplant 
induction. MSLs will be able to 
offer on-site training and relevant 
recommendations. 
Have the schedules, doses and 
number of cycles for each of the 
2 combinations clearly described 
and graphically represented in 
educational materials. 
Include detailed discussions on 
the dosing regimens in the 
transplant induction setting in all 
future regional and local medical 
education (programme) whenever 
the use of VELCADE in the 
Transplant settings is addressed. 
Missing information 
Safety in patients with cardiac 
impairment or with NYHA Class III 
or IV impairment 
Safety in patients with ECOG>2 
Second primary malignancies with 
VcTD induction therapy 
The SmPC, Section 4.4 Special 
Warnings and Precautions for Use, 
states that acute development or 
exacerbation of congestive heart 
failure, and/or new onset of 
decreased LVEF has been reported 
during bortezomib treatment. In a 
single agent Phase 3 randomised, 
comparative trial the incidence of 
heart failure in the VELCADE 
(injected intravenously) group 
was 
similar to that in the 
dexamethasone group. Fluid 
retention may be a predisposing 
factor for signs and symptoms of 
heart failure. Patients with risk 
factors for or existing heart 
disease should be closely 
monitored.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The results from Study LYM-3002 have provided convincing evidence of clinical efficacy of VcR-CAP in terms 
of the primary endpoint PFS, compared to R-CHOP in untreated MCL patients unsuitable for haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation. The results of PFS (Cut-off 2 December 2013) showed a statistically significant 
improvement (IRR) for VcR-CAP compared with R-CHOP (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.79; p<0.001), with a gain 
in median PFS of 10.3 months in favour of VcR-CAP. The robustness of the PFS effect is supported by 
alternative IRC assessment and Investigator assessment and several sensitivity analyses, the results of 
which were in line with the primary analysis. 
The secondary endpoints, including time to progression (30.5 vs 16.1 months), time to next anti-lymphoma 
treatment (44.5 vs 24.8 months) and treatment free interval (40.6 vs 20.5 months), overall response rates 
(53.3 % vs. 41.7%), and duration of response rates (42.1 vs. 18.0 months) supported the primary efficacy 
endpoint and favoured the VcR-CAP arm compared to the R-CHOP arm. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
One uncertainty that was identified during the assessment was the specific population included in the pivotal 
trial (patients who were ineligible to transplantation) and the selected dose however this uncertainty was 
satisfactorily addressed (see discussion on clinical efficacy). 
The pivotal study supporting the MCL indication utilized IV administration of Velcade and no data were 
provided with SC administration in MCL, however no relevant Velcade PK/PD differences were observed 
between Velcade administered IV and SC in MM setting (Velcade is currently administered SC both as single 
agent and combination. Since no significant differences on the Velcade SC bioavailability are expected 
between MM and MCL patients, it is likely that the lack of data from study LYM-3002 on Velcade SC 
administration in VcR-CAP regimen have no impact on its overall efficacy. Therefore the SC administration is 
considered appropriate also for MCL indication and this has been reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC 3.5 mg 
vial only (the only strength for which SC is allowed). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The common chemotherapy backbone of the two regimens and the characteristics of the disease accounted 
for the most common classes of AEs in both groups in the LYM-3002 study: Hematologic abnormalities were 
the most common AE class in both groups (86% and 94% respectively in the R-CHOP and VcR-CAP arms), 
followed by infections and infestations (46% in R-CHOP and 60% in VcR-CAP), gastrointestinal disorders 
(47% in R-CHOP and 58% in VcR-CAP) and nervous system disorders (46% vs 50%).

More patients in the pooled VcR-CAP arm compared to the pooled R-CHOP group experienced adverse 
events grade ≥ 3 (92% vs 68% respectively) and serious adverse events (38% vs 31% respectively). 
Peripheral sensory neuropathy was confirmed to be a Velcade and Vincristine associated toxicity. Velcade 
discontinuation due to peripheral neuropathy occurred in 5% of subjects in the pooled VcR-CAP treatment 
group while Vincristine discontinuation in the pooled R-CHOP treatment group was slightly less frequent 
(3%).  
Myelotoxicity was higher in the pooled VcR-CAP group compared with the pooled R-CHOP group and reflects 
the higher and more extensive haematological toxicity of Velcade in comparison with Vincristine. Grade ≥ 3 
neutropenia rate was 70% in the pooled R-CHOP group and 83% in the pooled VcR-CAP group, and grade ≥ 
3 thrombocytopenia rate was 5% in pooled R-CHOP group and 52% in pooled VcR-CAP group. The greater 
Velcade-related myelotoxicity was clinically reflected in a more intensive supportive treatment with platelet 
transfusions administered to prevent the number and the severity of bleeding events in the VcR-CAP group 
(23% of subjects in the pooled VcR-CAP group needed platelet transfusions vs 3% in the pooled R-CHOP 
group). Platelet transfusions and the transient nature of thrombocytopenia have resulted, despite the high 
rate of grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia in the pooled VcR-CAP group, in a low incidence of all grade bleeding 
events in both pooled groups (5% in the R-CHOP arm and 6% in the VcR-CAP arm respectively), and a 
similar incidence of grade ≥ 3 bleeding events was also reported. In light of their efficiency in preventing 
major bleedings, platelet transfusions should be considered, where clinically appropriated, during VcR-CAP 
administration. The need of platelet transfusion and of prophylaxis due to neutropenia has been reflected in 
sections 4.2 and 4.4.of the SmPC.  
Herpes zoster-related events were more common in the VcR-CAP group, in spite of antiviral prophylaxis. The 
already established association between Velcade exposure and herpes zoster reactivation is therefore 
confirmed. Prophylactic antiviral therapy should be mandatory and this has been adequately reflected in the 
SmPC (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
HBV infection with fatal outcomes occurred in 0.8% (n=2) of patients in the non-Velcade treatment group 
(R-CHOP) and 0.4% (n=1) of patients receiving VcR-CAP. The overall incidence of hepatitis B infections was 
similar in patients treated with VcR-CAP or with R-CHOP (0.8% vs 1.2% respectively). These data have been 
adequately reflected in the SmPC (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Even if thrombocytopenia is a known safety concern associated to Velcade use, the grade of 
thrombocytopenia observed in study LYM-3002 in VcR-CAP group is higher than that expected in the 
regimens currently employed in the treatment of MCL (as highlighted by the lower platelet transfusions in 
R-CHOP treated patients). This has been adequately reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.2 and 4.4) and is 
reflected in the Risk Management Plan. 
The treatment with VcR-CAP is also associated with an increased risk of pneumonia compared to R-CHOP in 
the study LYM-3002. Since the majority of the pneumonia events in study occurred within the context of 
neutropenia, the use of colony stimulating factors is strongly supported (SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The proposed combination VcR-CAP showed a significant superiority over R-CHOP in untreated MCL patients 
unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with a gain in absolute PFS of 10.3 months. The 
secondary endpoints, supported the primary efficacy endpoint and favoured the VcR-CAP arm compared to 
the R-CHOP arm which can translate in a clinically significant benefit and in a better quality of life in patients 
who are at present destined to receive multiple chemotherapy treatments during their lifetime.  
The toxicity associated with VcR-CAP combination although consistent with the known single safety profiles 
of velcade, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone, was also important, including grade 
≥ 3 and serious adverse events especially with regard to thrombocytopenia, neutropenia peripheral 
neuropathy and herpes zoster reactivation.  
Benefit-risk balance 
In general, the availability of new medicinal products in the first line treatment of MCL in patients suitable or 
not for an autologous stem cell transplant is considered of great clinical value. The safety profile of VcR-CAP 
regimen although sufficiently characterized, is significantly higher than that of R-CHOP. In view of the large 
effect in terms of PFS, the coherent evidence from secondary efficacy endpoints and the lack of significant 
uncertainty in terms of efficacy or safety, the toxicity profile is considered acceptable. Therefore, the 
benefit-risk balance for VcR-CAP regimen in the proposed indication is considered positive.

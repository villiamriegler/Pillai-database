1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Pfizer Ltd. submitted on 5 May 2011 an application for the extension of the Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Revatio 10 mg/mL, powder for oral 
suspension, through the centralised procedure falling within the Article 19 (1) and Annex I (point 2, 
intend c) and d) of the Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Pfizer Limited is already the Marketing Authorisation Holder for Revatio 20 mg film-coated tablets and 
Revatio 0.8 mg/mL solution for injection (EU/1/05/318/001-002). 
Revatio was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/03/178 on 12/12/2003. Revatio was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following indication:  Treatment of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The calculated prevalence 
of this condition was 1 per 10,000 EU population. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/114/2011 for the following condition(s):  
 
Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. 
on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP)  
The PIP is not yet completed as some measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant referred to the previously submitted critical report addressing similarity with 
authorised orphan products. The CHMP confirmed that the similarity assessment performed as part of 
variation EMEA/H/C/000638/II/0028 is still valid. The scope of this variation was to extend the 
indication to paediatric patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension aged 1 year to 17 years old. The 
CHMP was of the opinion that Revatio is not similar to iloprost (Ventavis), treprostinil (Remodulin), 
bosentan (Tracleer), ambrisentan (Volibris) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation 
EC No. 847/2000 (see annex 4.4).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application for an extension of marketing authorisation is for the introduction of a new 
pharmaceutical form and a new strength of Revatio suitable for paediatric use: Revatio 10 mg/ml 
powder for oral suspension (POS). This was discussed and agreed with the Paediatric Committee 
(PDCO) EMEA-671-PIP01-09. The already existing presentations, Revatio 20 mg film-coated tablet and 
Revatio 0.8 mg/mL solution for injection, were authorised in the EU on 28 October 2005 and 24 
September 2009, respectively. 
The therapeutic indication for the Revatio 10 mg/ml powder for oral suspension is the same as for the 
authorised 20 mg tablets: 
Treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II 
and III, to improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and 
pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease. 
Paediatric population 
Treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  
Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary haemodynamics has been shown 
in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart 
disease. 
The Revatio solution for injection is only indicated for adults. 
In order to facilitate the administration of Revatio in paediatric population, the applicant was requested 
by the PDCO and the CHMP to develop an alternative formulation. The powder for oral suspension was 
considered  to  be  the  most  appropriate  formulation  for  use  in  children  below  6  years  and  who  cannot 
swallow the tablets. The preparation of an extemporaneous suspension from the tablets was approved 
as  an  interim  solution  until  the  age  appropriate  formulation  was  available.  Consequently  the  MAH  is 
recommended  to  delete  the  information  on  crushing  of  tablets  to  prepare  a  suspension  for  paediatric 
use once the new POS is marketed in the EU. The MAH should aim at shortening the transition period 
as  much  as  possible  to  enable  patients  and  prescribers  the  use  of  the  powder  for  oral  suspension  in 
children.  
The  product  information  of  Revatio  has  been  updated  to  include  the  10  mg/ml  powder  for  oral 
suspension  presentation.  In  addition,  the  product  information  has  been  revised  to  comply  with  the 
latest QRD guideline.  
Within  this  application,  the  applicant  has  updated  the  detailed  description  of  the  system  of 
pharmacovigilance (DDPS) and a RMP waiver for this line extension has been submitted. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Revatio powder for oral suspension 10 mg/mL is presented as a white to slightly pink powder packaged 
in a 125 mL type III amber glass bottle for reconstitution with water. The bottle is filled with 32.27 g of 
dry powder blend to be constituted with the addition of 90 ml of water yielding approximately 112 ml 
of constituted suspension. Upon constitution, a 10 mg/mL suspension is achieved that is adequate to 
provide a 30 day supply of a 10 mg dose, or a 15 day supply of a 20 mg dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/195291/2012  
Page 7/14
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to the bottle, a 30 mL cup for constitution of the formulation is provided, along with a 
press-in bottle adapter (PIBA) and syringe to ensure accurate dosing. 
The active substance is sildenafil citrate. The list of excipients can be found in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
2.2.1.  Active Substance (to be changed in the EPAR to “Active Substance”) 
Sildenafil citrate, the active substance used in the manufacturing of the Revatio powder for oral 
suspension is identical to the active substance used in the manufacturing of the currently authorized 
Revatio tablet formulation. For data on the active substance reference was made to the Module 3.2.S 
of the initial marketing authorisation of the 20 mg tablets and subsequent quality variations.  
2.2.2.  Finished Medicinal Product (To be changed in the EPAR to “Medicinal 
Product”) 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to develop a dosage form appropriate for paediatric 
use. In order to minimize the taste challenges of an oral solution and the physical stability risk of a 
ready to use suspension, the powder for oral suspension (POS) platform was progressed and agreed by 
the PDCO as the most appropriate dosage form. 
The paediatric formulation is a dry powder blend that is constituted into a multidose suspension 
suitable to provide the recommended doses for paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old of 10 
mg (1 ml of suspension) three times a day for patients ≤ 20 kg and 20 mg (2 ml of suspension or 1 
tablet) three times a day for patients > 20 kg. The 112 ml volume is indeed sufficient for one month (3 
x 1 ml for 30 days) or 15 days (3 x 2 ml for 15 days. 
Different factors were studied during the development of the new pharmaceutical form: pH of the 
suspension, choice and concentration of the buffer, preservative concentration, suspending agent 
concentration, robustness of the suspension and caking of the powder blend. The effect of viscosity on 
resuspendability and accurate dosing has been tested over the whole viscosity range observed for the 
product. Acceptable palatability has been substantiated. 
Due to the bitter taste of sildenafil citrate, sweeteners (sucralose and sorbitol) and grape flavour are 
used to mask the taste. The desired pH of the suspension is achieved by a buffer and the pH is 
selected to ensure stability of the sildenafil citrate as well as effectiveness of the preservative, sodium 
benzoate, which is utilized to meet the quality requirements for the multidose product. The formulation 
is packaged in an amber glass bottle with a polyethylene lined closure to provide adequate stability to 
ensure shelf-life. 
All excipients used in the manufacture of Revatio POS are of pharmacopoeial or food grade. 
As the active substance is not highly soluble and has a low oral bioavailability (41%) a BCS-based  
biowaiver was not accepted and a bioequivalence study with the POS formulation and the registered 20 
mg tablets was requested and submitted by the applicant (see section 3.3.2). 
Adventitious Agents 
Revatio POS 10 mg/mL does not contain materials of animal or human origin.

Manufacture of the Product 
Sildenafil citrate POS, 10 mg/ml is manufactured using a blend-mill-blend manufacturing process. This 
process was selected because it is a standard process and the commercial site is familiar with it in the 
manufacture of other products. Development studies were performed with small scale batches (2kg) to 
select blend speed, blend fill volume, mill speed and mill screen opening site. 
Blend process scale up (content uniformity on four batches) and the bottle filling process (bottle fill 
weight and potency and cap torque on two batches) were studied on 200 kg batches manufactured at 
the proposed site. Additionally, three registration batches of 200 kg have been manufactured at the 
proposed site with review of blend uniformity and bottle fill process (by fill weight and potency testing). 
No critical steps or intermediates have been identified.  
The manufacturing process demonstrated to be reproducible and provides a finished product that 
complies with the finished product specifications. 
In view of the standard manufacturing process and the results of the manufacturing process 
development provided it is considered acceptable to conduct the process validation study in accordance 
with the protocol submitted on the first three production scale batches of the product, post-approval.  
Current commercial batch size is anticipated to be 200 kg but may be adjusted based on expected 
market demand.  
Sildenafil citrate POS, 10 mg/ml, is presented in an amber glass bottle (USP-type III) with a 
polyethylene (PE) liner closure, a press-in bottle adaptor (PIBA), a 3 ml oral dosing syringe, and a 30 
ml cup for reconstitution.  The oral dosing syringe bears calibration marks that have been 
demonstrated to be accurate for delivering the required volumes of the constituted POS (1ml and 2 ml 
for the 10 mg and 20 mg doses respectively). Uniformity of mass of delivered dose was verified. 
The materials used for the LDPE closure liner, syringe, PIBA and cup comply with the EU food Directive 
2002/72/EC. The cup, oral syringe and PIBA meet the requirements of Ph Eur 3.2.2. ‘Plastic containers 
and closures for pharmaceutical use’. The oral syringe is CE marked. A declaration on compliance with 
Medical Devices EC Directive 93/42/EEC article 11 Section5 and Annex VII, and with the measuring 
requirements of Annex V has been provided. A declaration on compliance with that Directive has also 
been provided for the cup. 
Product Specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications for Revatio POS, 10 mg/mL include tests for 
appearance, fill weight and water content of powder (Ph. Eur.); whereas specifications for the 
constituted suspension include: appearance, identification (HPLC), assay (95.0%-105.0% of label 
claim), impurities (HPLC-not routinely), preservative content (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. 
Eur.), pH and microbiological limits (Ph. Eur.-not routinely).  
The proposed test procedures and acceptance criteria comply with the requirements of the Ph.Eur. and 
ICH guidelines. All tests included in the specification have been satisfactorily described and validated. 
Appropriate  data  have  been  presented  to  justify  the  release  specifications  for  each  quality 
characteristic that is controlled.  
Full  batch  analysis  data  have  been  provided  for  three  registration  batches  of  the  POS  suspension. 
Batch analysis results comply with the proposed specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity 
of manufacture and indicate that the process is under control.

Stability of the Product 
Stability studies have been performed in accordance with ICH guideline Q1A (R2) on three batches of 
sildenafil  citrate  POS,  10  mg/mL  packaged  in  125  mL  Type  III  amber  bottles  with  low  density 
polyethylene  (LDPE)  lined  plastic  closure.    Data  included  up  to  18  months  25°C/60%  RH  and 
30°C/75%  RH,  and  up  to  6  months  data  at  40°C/75%  RH  and  refrigerated  storage  conditions.  In 
addition, an in-use stability study was performed, and the photostability of one batch was evaluated in 
accordance with ICH guideline Q1B. 
The stability batches were made and packaged at the commercial manufacturing site. The batch sizes 
were approximately 200 kg and are of equivalent size to that of the commercial product. 
The stability samples were evaluated for appearance and water content (before constitution) and 
appearance, redispersability, reconstitution time, assay, impurities, preservative content, pH and 
viscosity after constitution. Microbial quality was also tested.  
The analytical procedures used to monitor those characteristics are identical to the ones applied for 
release testing, except appearance and water content methods. The methods used were validated and 
demonstrated to be stability indicating. 
Based on the long term stability data and supportive data in accelerated conditions, the proposed 
shelf-life of 2 years, stored not above 30°C in the original packaging to protect from moisture for the 
powder for oral suspension, and an in-use shelf-life of 30 days, stored not above 30°C and “do not 
freeze” for the reconstituted suspension are acceptable. 
A  commitment  is  made  to  place  the  first  three  commercial  scale  batches  of  sildenafil  citrate  POS, 
10mg/mL on long term stability at 30°C/75%RH. 
In  conclusion,  the  stability  results  presented  were  satisfactory and  support  the  proposed  shelf life for 
the commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SmPC.  
2.2.3.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Revatio POS is manufactured using the same active substance as the already authorised 20mg tablets. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the medicinal product has been presented in 
a satisfactory manner.  
The results of tests carried out on the finished product indicate satisfactory consistency and uniformity 
of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
The quality of this medicinal product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions  defined  in  the  SmPC.  At  the  time  of  the  CHMP  opinion,  there  were  no  unresolved  quality 
issues which could have an impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the medicinal product.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic study A1481293 
A bioequivalence study has been performed, comparing sildenafil citrate powder for oral suspension 
(10 mg/mL) with the registered 20 mg Revatio immediate release tablet and 2 x 10 mg sildenafil 
citrate immediate release tablets.  
Study Design 
The study was conducted as a three-way, three period, 6-sequenses, single dose cross-over study in 
healthy male (14) and female (28) subjects) aged 18 – 54 years, BMI 17.5 – 30.5 kg/m2). Before the 
products were administered the subjects fasted for at least 8 hours. The products were administered 
with 240 ml water. Blood samples were taken upon administration at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 
8, 10, 12, and 14 hours. 
Test and reference products  
Test: 
Sildenafil powder for suspension, 10 mg/ml, batch 10-082576. 
Reference:  
Sildenafil 10 mg tablets, batch 07-061004. 
Analytical methods 
Sildenafil was determined in plasma with a validated LC-MS/MS method. The calibration curve range 
from 1.0 ng/ml till 500 ng/ml. Precision and accuracy were in compliance. The long term stability in the 
biological matrix was tested over a period of 1275 days. In total 180 incurred samples were analyzed. 
Analytical method seems adequate to determine sildenafil in plasma accurately.

2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic variables after administration of the three formulations are comparable. The 90% 
confidence intervals in the comparison with the POS formulation are well within the acceptance criteria 
of 0.80 – 1.25 for the rate and extent of absorption.  Therefore bioequivalence can be considered as 
established. 
2.4.  Update of the product information  
Revatio product information has been updated to include the powder for oral suspension 
presentation. In addition, the product information has been revised to comply with the latest 
QRD guideline.  
The MAH is recommended to delete the information on crushing of tablets to prepare a 
paediatric use formulation once the new POS is effectively marketed in the EU. 
User consultation 
The Package Leaflet (PL) for Revatio 10 mg/ml Powder for Oral Suspension (Sildenafil) has been tested 
in English in accordance with Articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended by 
Directive 2004/27/EC. 
Overall the results demonstrate that the PL meets the requirements set for user testing and the user 
test is found to be acceptable. 
2.5.  Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system

The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements and provides adequate evidence that the applicant has the services of a 
qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the notification of 
any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third country. 
2.6.  Risk Management plan 
The Applicant submitted a Risk Management Plan Waiver, dated 2 May 2011. The current RMP waiver 
applies to this MAH application, which is being submitted for the Revatio line extension i.e. the powder 
for oral suspension for use in paediatric PAH patients. This waiver was  considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
An updated Revatio RMP v5.0 was included in the application for a new paediatric indication submitted 
to EMA on 12 February 2010. During the EMA review process, this RMP version has been updated. The 
assessment of the updated RMP (v5.3 and 5.4) is included in the type II variation 
EMEA/H/C/638/II/040 which is currently under evaluation. 
4. BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT 
This  new  POS  of  Revatio  has  been  developed  to  provide  a  formulation  suitable  for  paediatric  use 
(children from 1 to 6 years old), especially for those unable to swallow the 20 mg tablets. 
The CHMP concluded that the benefit-risk balance of this line extension is positive. 
The overall Benefit risk of Revatio is positive. 
Proposed list of recommendations:  
1. The MAH is recommended to delete the information on crushing of tablets to prepare a 
paediatric use formulation once the new POS is effectively marketed in the EU.

2.7.  Recommendation 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Revatio is not similar to iloprost (Ventavis), treprostinil (Remodulin), 
bosentan (Tracleer), ambrisentan (Volibris) within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation 
EC No. 847/2000 for the same therapeutic indication. See annex 4.4. 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of the new pharmaceutical form for Revatio in the treatment of: 
  Adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to 
 
improve exercise capacity. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and 
pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease. 
Paediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Efficacy in 
terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary haemodynamics has been shown in 
primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart 
disease (See section 5.1). 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the extension of the marketing 
authorisation.

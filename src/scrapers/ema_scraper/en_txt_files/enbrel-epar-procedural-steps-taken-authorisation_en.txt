Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The procedure started on 20 November 1998. 
The  Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  28  January 
1999. The Co-Rapporteur's first assessment report was circulated to all CPMP Members on  
3 February 1999.  
The  CPMP  at  its  meeting  of  23-25  February  1999  decided  that  there  was  no  need  for  a  GMP 
inspection of the manufacturing sites of Enbrel. 
During the meeting on 22-24 March 1999 the CPMP agreed on the consolidated list of questions 
to be sent to the company. The final consolidated list of questions was sent to the company on 
25 March 1999.  
The  company  submitted  the  responses  to  the  CPMP  consolidated  list  of  questions  on  8  June 
1999. 
The Rapporteur circulated the response assessment report on the company’s responses to the list 
of questions to all CPMP Members on 16 August 1999.  
During the CPMP meeting on 21 – 23 September 1999, the CPMP issued a list of outstanding 
questions to be addressed by the applicant during an oral explanation.  
The applicant submitted to the EMEA and the CPMP members on 8 October 1999 background 
documentation for the oral explanation. 
During the CPMP meeting of 19 – 21 October 1999 outstanding issues were addressed by the 
applicant during an oral explanation before the CPMP.  
During  the  meeting  on  19  –  21  October  1999  the  CPMP  requested  the  company  to  submit 
information on the use of Enbrel in the indication ‘Juvenile Chronic Arthritis’. 
The applicant submitted to the EMEA, Rapporteur and Co-rapporteur and CPMP members the 
clinical data on the use of Enbrel in the indication : Juvenile Chronic Arthritis (JCA) on  
21 October 1999.  
The  Rapporteur  circulated  (after  consultation  of  the  Co-Rapporteur)  an  additional  assessment 
report on the JCA data to all CPMP Members on 5 November 1999.  
During the meeting on 16 – 18 November 1999, in the light of the overall data submitted and the 
scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee, issued a  positive  opinion for granting a Marketing 
Authorisation to Enbrel on 18 November 1999.

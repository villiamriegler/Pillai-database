1.  Introduction 
On  1  December  2014,  the  MAH  submitted  one  completed  paediatric  study  (VX12-770-113)  for 
Kalydeco (Ivacaftor), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Kalydeco 
and that no consequential regulatory action is required. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study VX12-770-113 is a stand-alone study. No line listing is provided, since the 
study is not specifically part of a development program. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
The pharmaceutical formulation used in the study was ivacaftor 150-mg film coated tablets, essentially 
the  same  as  the  currently  approved  formulation.  Ivacaftor  150-mg  tablets  were  used  for  the 
adolescent  subjects  recruited  in  the  study;  hence  no  specific  paediatric  formulation  was  required  for 
this study. 
Ivacaftor  150-mg  tablets  were  administered  under  similar  conditions  as  the  approved  SmPC  for 
Kalydeco: 
-  Orally at a dosage of 150 mg q12h 
Recommended to take study drug 30 minutes after the start of a standard “CF” highfat, high-
calorie meal or snack. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Kalydeco  (ivacaftor)  was  first  authorised  23  July  2012  via  the  centralised  procedure  in  the  European 
Union. Kalydeco is currently indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years 
and  older  who  have  one  of  the  following  gating  (class  III)  mutations  in  the  CFTR  gene:  G551D, 
G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, or S549R. 
The MAH submitted final reports for:  
• 
Study VX12-770-113, a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple 
within-subject crossover (n-of-1) study.

Description 
The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effect of ivacaftor in patients 12 years and older with 
CF  who  have  phenotypic  or  molecular  evidence  of  residual  CF  transmembrane  conductance  regulator 
(CFTR) function. 
Methods 
•  Objective(s) 
Primary Objective 
To  evaluate  the  effect  of  ivacaftor  on  lung  function  in  subjects  aged  12  years  and  older  with  cystic 
fibrosis  (CF)  who  have  phenotypic  or  molecular  evidence  of  residual  CF  transmembrane  conductance 
regulator (CFTR) function. 
Secondary Objectives 
- 
- 
To evaluate the utility of home spirometry as a clinical endpoint 
To evaluate the utility of a smart phone-based data collection 
•  Study design 
This  was  a  Phase  2,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multiple  within-subject  crossover 
(n-of-1)  study.    The  n-of-1  design  was  selected  to  evaluate  the  potential  therapeutic  benefit  of 
ivacaftor  in  subjects  with  CF  who  did  not  have  gating  mutations  but  who  may  have  benefited  from 
ivacaftor treatment. This design enabled within subject comparison, while also allowing use of Bayesian 
meta-analysis for aggregation of multiple individual n-of-1 studies. 
This study included a Screening Period (Day -14 to Day -1); a Crossover Period consisting of Cycle 1 
(Day  1  to  Day  29  [±  2  days]),  Washout  1  (minimum  of  4  weeks  and  did  not  exceed  8  weeks  in 
duration), Cycle 2 (Day 1 to Day 29 [± 2 days]), Washout 2 (minimum of 4 weeks and did not exceed 
8  weeks  in  duration);  an  Open-label  Period  (Day  1  to  Day  57  [±  3  days]);  and  a  Follow-up  Visit  (2 
weeks [± 3 days] after last dose of study drug). The study design is presented in Figure 2-1.

•  Study population /Sample size 
Male  and  female  subjects with  CF  who  were  aged  12  years  and  older,  had  mild  to  moderate  CF  lung 
disease  (FEV1  ≥ 40%  of  predicted),  and  had  clinical  evidence  of  residual  CFTR  function,  as 
demonstrated  by  (1)  residual  exocrine  pancreatic  function,  (2)  sweat  chloride  values  ≤80  mmol/L,  or 
(3)  age  of  diagnosis  ≥12  years  and  at  least  1  copy  of  CFTR  mutation  associated  with  residual  CFTR 
function or mRNA splicing defect. 
Enrolment was planned for a maximum of 40 subjects. The study sample size was primarily driven by 
operational considerations in this rare population.  
•  Treatments 
Ivacaftor-matched placebo were administered orally q12h. It was recommended to take ivacaftor with 
fat-containing food such as a standard “CF” high-fat, high calorie meal or snack. Placebo batch umber: 
3091820R. Subjects were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences (Table 2-1). 
Table 2-1 Treatment Sequences 
The  planned  duration  of  study  drug  administration  was  16  weeks.  Excluding  the  2-week  Screening 
Period,  each  subject  was  planned  to  participate  in  the  study  for  approximately  26  weeks  (Day  1 
through the Follow-up Visit). 
Subjects  were  not  allowed  to  take  Grapefruit/grapefruit  juice,  Seville  orange/marmalade,  CYP3A4 
inhibitors  and  inducers  or  inhaled  hypertonic  saline.  Subjects  were  allowed  to  continue  their  prior 
inhaled antibiotics and bronchodilators during the study. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Assessments:  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 after 2 
weeks of treatment compared to placebo. This was assessed in 2 cross-over cycles (i.e., the Crossover 
Period), when ivacaftor was administered for 2 weeks either before or after 2 weeks of placebo.  
The following were secondary efficacy endpoints: 
-  Change in LCI after 2 weeks of treatment during the Crossover Period; 
-  Changes from baseline during the 8-week Open-label Period in:  percent predicted FEV1, LCI, 
Sweat chloride, Weight; 
-  Correlation between absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 and LCI after 2 
and 8 weeks of treatment; 
-  Absolute change from baseline in percent predicted FEV1 collected by home spirometry after 2 
and 8 weeks of treatment. 
Page 5/12 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Safety  Assessments:  Adverse  events  (AEs),  clinical  laboratory  values  (serum  chemistry,  hematology, 
coagulation,  and  urinalysis),  and  vital  signs,  electrocardiograms  (ECGs),  and  ophthalmologic 
examinations. 
•  Statistical Methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS), defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study 
drug,  was  used  for  all  efficacy  analyses.  Safety  Set  (all  randomized  subjects)  was  used  for  all  safety 
analyses. 
Efficacy Analyses 
The  absolute  change  from  cycle  baseline  in  percent  predicted  FEV1  and  LCI  were  analyzed  using  a 
Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) as the primary analysis and a mixed effects model as a supportive 
analysis. 
The results of the mixed effect model analyses are presented for the FAS as well as for the pre-defined 
mRNA splice site (Class V) mutation and residual CFTR function mutation subgroups. The mRNA splice 
site (Class V) mutation subgroup included all subjects with at least 1 allele having a mRNA splice site 
mutation,  with  the  exception  of  Subject,  who  had  the  1717-1G->A/R117H  genotype.  The  mutation 
1717-1G->A  is  not  classified  as  mRNA  splice  site  (Class  V)  mutation;  therefore,  this  subject  was 
assigned  to  the  residual  function  mutation  subgroup.  Summary  statistics  for  percent  predicted  FEV1, 
LCI,  weight,  BMI,  and  CFQ-R  respiratory  domain  are  presented  by  treatment  within  each  cycle  and 
during the Open-label Period, for the FAS and the genotype subgroups. Summary statistics for sweat 
chloride  and  fecal  elastase-1  are  presented  during  the  Open-label  Period  only,  for  the  FAS  and  the 
genotype subgroups. 
Safety Analyses 
Adverse events were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; Version 15.0). 
The  incidence  of  AEs  that  started  or  increased  in  severity  after  the  initial  study  drug  dosing  was 
summarized by treatment group. The incidence of AEs  was analyzed for the Safety Set and for the 2 
genotype subgroups. Descriptive statistics (raw values) were summarized for clinical laboratory values, 
ECG parameters, vital signs, and ophthalmologic examinations.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  24  subjects  were  randomized  (Table  2-2);  21  (87.5%)  subjects  completed  their  assigned 
duration of dosing in the study. One subject (4.2%) in the PIPI treatment sequence group discontinued 
at the end of Cycle 1 (during the Washout Period) due to an adverse event (AE) of infective pulmonary 
exacerbation  of  CF,  and  2  subjects,  1  in  each  of  the  IPPI  and  PIPI  treatment  sequence  groups, 
discontinued after Cycle 2 due to non-compliance with study drug. Of the 24 FAS subjects, 10 were in 
the  subgroup  of  subjects  with  mRNA  splice  site  (Class  V)  mutations  and  14  were  in  the  subgroup  of 
subjects with residual function mutations. 
Table 2-2 Subject Disposition 
Source: Table 14.1.1.1. 
The FAS and Safety Set included both 24 subjects. 
Baseline data 
Demographic  details  were  similar  across  mutation  subgroups  and  treatment  sequences.  Overall,  all 
subjects were White, 50% were male, and the mean age was 37.3 years (range 14 to 57 years). Mean 
baseline  percent  predicted  FEV1  was  approximately  67.8%  (range  38%  to  109%)  with  the  majority 
having a percent predicted FEV1 of <70%. The mean baseline BMI was 24.15 kg/m2 and the mean LCI 
was 10.6351 TO(N2.5). The study population had a typical CF medical history profile, with the majority 
having  sinus  disorders  and  gastroesophageal  reflux  disease,  and  at  least  a  third  of  FAS  subjects 
reported a medical history of asthma and pancreatic insufficiency. All subjects were receiving at least 1 
concomitant medication associated with the management of CF. 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint, absolute change from cycle baseline in percent predicted FEV1 after 2 
weeks of treatment (i.e., the Crossover Period Cycle 1 and Cycle 2), was analyzed with the BHM. Table 
11-1 presents the results of the model and demonstrates a treatment effect of 2.251 percentage points 
(SD 0.961; [95% CI 0.383, 4.144]) in favor of ivacaftor after 2 weeks of treatment. 
Results  are  summarized  for  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint,  absolute  change  from  cycle  baseline  in 
percent predicted FEV1 after 2 weeks treatment, in Table 11-3.

Change From Baseline in Lung Clearance Index after 8 Weeks of Treatment: 
For the FAS, the mean absolute change from baseline in LCI during the Open-label Period was -1.1344 
TO(N2.5)  after  2  weeks,  -0.8129  TO(N2.5)  after  4  weeks,  and  -1.5687  TO(N2.5)  after  8  weeks  of 
continuous ivacaftor treatment; after 2 weeks off-treatment at the Follow-up Visit, the LCI value was -
2.0421 TO(N2.5). 
After  8  weeks  of  open-label  ivacaftor  treatment,  the  mean  LCI  value  was  -1.3459  TO(N2.5)  in  the 
subgroup of subjects with mRNA splice site (Class V) mutations and -1.7358 TO(N2.5) in the subgroup of 
subjects with residual function mutations. 
Change From Baseline in Sweat Chloride After 8 Weeks of Treatment: 
For the FAS, the mean sweat chloride value at baseline was 64.69 mmol/L. At Day 1 of the Open-label 
Period, the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from study baseline was -9.14 mmol/L. The mean 
absolute  change  was  -15.38  mmol/L  at  Day  15  and  -15.74  mmol/L  at  Day  57.  The  baseline  sweat 
chloride value was higher in the subgroup of subjects with mRNA splice site (Class V) mutations (72.50 
mmol/L) than in the subgroup of subjects with residual function mutations (59.11 mmol/L). 
Change From Baseline in Weight After 8 Weeks of Treatment 
No relevant changes were seen in weight, height, or BMI during the Crossover Period. 
Correlation  Between  Absolute  Change  From  Baseline  in  Percent  Predicted  FEV1  and  Lung  Clearance 
Index After 2 and 8 Weeks of Treatment 
Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from -0.372 (Crossover Cycle 2, ivacaftor treatment) to 0.168 
(Open-label Period Day 15) (P = 0.9739 to P = 0.0881). There was no significant correlation between 
changes  from  baseline  in  percent  predicted  FEV1  and  LCI  at  2  and  8  weeks  during  the  Crossover  or 
Open-label Periods. 
Absolute Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV1 Collected by Home Spirometry After 2 and 8 
Weeks of Treatment 
For the FAS, the mean percent predicted FEV1 as collected by home spirometry was 57.6996% at the 
Open-label  Period  baseline  and  58.0511%  at  Day  57  (mean  absolute  change  from  baseline:  2.8619 
percentage points). For the subgroup of subjects with mRNA splice site (Class V) mutations, the mean 
percent predicted FEV1 was 63.2373% at the Open-label Period baseline and 61.9450% at Day 57. For 
the  subgroup  of  subjects  with  residual  function  mutations,  the  mean  percent  predicted  FEV1  was 
53.1686% at the Open-label Period baseline and 55.4551% at Day 57. 
Safety results 
Overall Summary of Adverse Events 
A total of 23 subjects (95.8%) had AEs during ivacaftor treatment. During the Crossover Period (Cycle 
1 and Cycle 2), the incidence of AEs was similar during treatment with ivacaftor (75.0% subjects) and 
placebo (70.8% subjects). The overall incidence of AEs during the Open-label Period was 95.2%. 
The  SOC  with  the  highest  incidence  of  AEs  during  placebo  or  ivacaftor  treatment  was  Respiratory, 
thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders.  During  the  Crossover  Period,  AEs  in  this  SOC  occurred  in  14 
(58.3%)  subjects  during  placebo  treatment  and  8  (33.3%)  subjects  during  ivacaftor  treatment.  The 
most frequently reported AEs (occurring in at least 10% subjects during either the Crossover or Open-
label  Periods)  within  this  SOC  were  cough,  sputum  increased,  and  dyspnea.  During  the  Crossover 
Period,  these  AEs  occurred  in  more  subjects  during  placebo  treatment  compared  with  ivacaftor

treatment  (cough:  6  subjects  [25.0%]  during  placebo  and  1  subject  [4.2%]  during  ivacaftor 
treatment,  sputum  increased:  7  subjects  [29.2%]  during  placebo  and  1  subject  [4.2%]  during 
ivacaftor  treatment,  dyspnea:  4  subjects  [16.7%]  during  placebo  and  0  subjects  during  ivacaftor 
treatment). During the Open-label Period, cough occurred in 7 subjects (33.3%), while the incidence of 
sputum increased (2 subjects, 9.5%) and dyspnea (1 subject, 4.8%) were reduced compared with the 
placebo treatment of the Crossover Period of the study. 
AE  effecting  the  Infections  and  infestations  SOC  occurred  in  7  subjects  (29.2%)  during  the  placebo 
treatment  and  in  11  subjects  (45.8%)  during  ivacaftor  treatment  in  the  Crossover  Period  and  in  7 
subjects  (33.3%)  during  the  Open-label  Period.  The  most  frequently  occurring  AEs  within  this  SOC 
were  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  which  occurred  in  8  subjects  (33.3%)  overall  during  ivacaftor 
treatment. Infective pulmonary exacerbations of CF occurred in similar proportions of subjects during 
placebo and ivacaftor treatment in the Crossover Period and also during the Open-label Period of the 
study. 
Other  AEs  that  were  reported  in  at  least  10%  subjects  during  either  placebo  or  ivacaftor  treatment 
were  fatigue  which  occurred  in  4  subjects  overall  (16.7%)  during  ivacaftor  treatment  and  3  subjects 
(12.5%) during placebo, and pyrexia which was reported in 3 subjects overall (12.5%) during ivacaftor 
treatment and 1 subject (4.2%) during placebo administration.

AEs by severity 
Most  AEs  were  considered  mild  or  moderate  in  severity  for  the  majority  of  subjects.  One  subject 
(4.2%)  had  a  severe  SAE  of  infective  pulmonary  exacerbation  of  CF  that  occurred  during  ivacaftor 
treatment;  this  SAE  occurred  during  the  Crossover  Period.  One  subject  (4.2%)  had  a  severe  AE  of 
infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF during placebo treatment. No subject had a life-threatening AE 
during either ivacaftor or placebo administration.

AEs Leading to Discontinuation  
No AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation of study drug. 
Adverse Events That Led to dose interruptions 
One subject had a severe AE of infective pulmonary exacerbation of CF during placebo treatment that 
led to the interruption of ivacaftor treatment. The event resolved and was considered to be not related 
to study drug by the investigator. An additional subject had moderate AE of urticaria during open-label 
ivacaftor  treatment  that  led  the  interruption  of  ivacaftor  treatment.  This  event  resolved  was  and 
considered possibly related to study drug. 
Adverse Events by Relationship to Study Drug 
In  19  of  the  23  subjects  with  AEs,  the  AEs  were  considered  not  related  or  to  study  drug.  AEs 
considered  possibly  related  to  study  drug  occurred  in  3  subjects  during  ivacaftor  treatment:  one 
subject  had  headache  and  chest  discomfort;  another  subject  had  paranasal  sinus  hypersecretion, 
sputum increased, cough, chest pain, and wheezing; and one last subject had urticaria). One additional 
subject  had  cough  and  sputum  increased  during  placebo  treatment  that  were  considered  treatment-
related. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Cystic  fibrosis  is  caused  by  mutations  in  the  CF  transmembrane  conductance  regulator  gene  (CFTR), 
which  results  in  absent  or  deficient  function  of  the  CF  transmembrane  conductance  regulator  protein 
(CFTR)  at  the  cell  surface.    CFTR  is  an  epithelial  chloride  channel  responsible  for  helping  to  regulate 
salt  and  water  absorption  and  it’s  involved  in  the  multi-system  pathology  associated  with  CF. 
Currently, increasing the level of chloride transport through the CFTR channels by using a potentiator, 
such as ivacaftor, is a strategy to treat CF.  
Efficacy 
Study  VX12-770-113  was  a  Phase  2,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multiple  within-
subject crossover (n-of-1) study.  
Design & conduct of the study 
The study was conducted in a single centre in the USA and took place from September 2012 to April 
2014.  
Male  and  female  subjects  with  CF,  aged  12  years  and  older,  with  mild  to  moderate  CF  lung  disease 
(FEV1  ≥40%  of  predicted),  and  had  clinical  evidence  of  residual  CFTR  function  were  allowed  to  enrol. 
Page 11/12 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
No formal sample size calculations were performed and the sample size was selected solely based on 
operational  considerations.  This  approach  can  be  accepted,  considering  the  low  prevalence  of  the 
disease  and  the  selected  CFTR  mutation.  However,  the  inherent  limitations  associated  with  small 
sample sizes need to be acknowledged. 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on lung function in subjects 
aged 12 years and older with CF who have phenotypic or molecular evidence of residual CFTR function. 
Secondary  endpoints  were:  to  evaluate  the  utility  of  home  spirometry  as  a  clinical  endpoint  and  to 
evaluate the utility of a smart phone-based data collection. 
Efficacy data & additional analyses 
A total of 24 patients were included, of which only 1 was a pediatric patient (14 years of age).  
Only global results have been provided and no separate results are available for the pediatric subject in 
this  study.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  number  of  pediatric  patients  included  in  the  study  was  very 
small  (n=1)  and  the  applicability  of  the  study  results  would  probably  be  very  limited  as  well  and  no 
further data is being requested from the MAH..  
Safety 
Most of the subjects (n=23, 95.8%) had AEs during ivacaftor treatment. During the Crossover Period, 
the  incidence  was  similar  during  treatment  with  ivacaftor  (75.0%  subjects)  and  placebo  (70.8% 
subjects).  The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  during  the  Open-label  Period  was  95.2%.  The  SOC  with  the 
highest  incidence  of  AEs  during  placebo  or  ivacaftor  treatment  was  Respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal disorders. The most frequently reported AEs (≥10%) within this SOC were cough, sputum 
increased, and dyspnea. Most of the AEs reported were of mild to moderate intensity.  
No deaths or life threatening AEs occurred. No new or unexpected signals were identified in this study. 
Safety results have been presented globally, without separating paediatric and adult data. On the EMA 
cover  letter  accompanying  the  documentation  supportive  of  this  procedure,  the  MAH  stated  that  the 
only paediatric patients included in the study did not experienced any AEs or SAEs, but no confirmation 
on this statement has been located in the clinical overview.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
Considering that the aim of this procedure is to specifically assess pediatric data the provided results 
(global  results  only)  do  not  allow  performing  an  adequate  assessment.  Nevertheless,  as  only  1 
adolescent was recruited into this trial requesting the pediatric data separately would not be add any 
relevant information to address the purpose of the article 44 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006.

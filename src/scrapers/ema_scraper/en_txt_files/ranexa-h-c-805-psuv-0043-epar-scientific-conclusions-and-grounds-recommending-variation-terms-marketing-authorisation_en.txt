Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Ranexa, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
A cumulative review of “myasthenic syndrome” was requested following the assessment of Ranexa 
PSUR 7. In PSUR 8, the MAH has provided the requested review. In clinical trials data, “myasthenic 
syndrome” was not described as treatment emergent adverse event, and the number of cases 
observed was not presented. In postmarketing data, although only one case with “myasthenic 
syndrome” has been reported, cases suggestive of “myasthenic syndrome” with positive dechallenge 
have been reported. Following the review of the information provided the PRAC concluded that there is 
no sufficient data supporting inclusion of” myasthenic syndrome” in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Inclusion 
of “muscular weakness” in section 4.8 of the SmPC was considered by the PRAC acceptable with the 
frequency “uncommon”. In order to monitor the potential safety issue of “myasthenic syndrome” it was 
proposed to add this safety topic as a potential risk in the next update of the RMP. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Ranexa the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance ranolazine is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

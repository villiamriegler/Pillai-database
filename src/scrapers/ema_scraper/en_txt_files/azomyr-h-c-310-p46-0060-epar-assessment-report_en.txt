II.  PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT RATIONALE 
The  purpose  of  this  file  is  to  summarize  pediatric  data  with  desloratadine  collected  by 
the Market Authorisation Holder in four studies with pediatric and/or adolescent subjects 
that have not been previously submitted to the EMEA. 
Desloratadine (DL) is a second-generation, non sedating, oral, selective, peripheral H1-
receptor  antagonist  that  is  approved  and  marketed  in  the  European  Union  for  the 
treatment  of  allergic  rhinitis  and  urticaria.    DL  Tablets  were  first  approved  in  January 
2001 for use in adolescent and adult patients 12 years of age and older. DL syrup was 
initially approved in April 2002 for pediatric use down to 2 years of age, and extended in 
September 2004 for use down to 1 years of age. 
The once-daily 5-mg DL tablet, RediTabs (orodispersible) tablet, and DL syrup (10 mL) 
are  approved  in  adults  and  adolescents  12  years  of  age  and  over.  The  once-daily  DL 
2.5-mg RediTabs (orodispersible) tablet and DL syrup (5 mL) are approved in children 6 
to 11 years of age. The DL syrup (2.5 mL) is approved in children 12 months to 5 years 
of age at a dose of 1.25 mg once daily. In the EU, a sugar-and dye-free DL oral solution 
has replaced the syrup at the same dosages. Desloratadine is indicated in the EU for the 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

relief  of  the  symptoms  of  allergic  rhinitis  (including  intermittent  and  persistent  allergic 
rhinitis) and urticaria in patients down to 1 year of age. 
The  four  studies  described  in  this  file  included  a  total  of  4374  subjects.  Two  studies 
(Study  Nos.  P04446  and  P04706)  included  133  pediatric  subjects  between  1  and  11 
years of age and three studies (Study Nos. P04683, P04684, and P04706) included 244 
adolescent  subjects  between  12  and  17  years  of  age  and  3994  subjects  ≥18  years  of 
age. The ages of three subjects in Study No. P04706 were not specified. A list of studies 
included in this response is presented in Table 2. 
III.  SUBMITTED DATA 
Study P04683 
Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Group, 
Multicenter/Multinational, Efficacy and Safety Study of Desloratadine 5 mg in the 
Treatment of Subjects With Allergic Rhinitis Who Meet the Criteria for Intermittent 
Allergic Rhinitis (IAR) (SCH 34117). 
Objective(s): 
Primary: The primary objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of desloratadine 
(DL) with placebo in the symptomatic treatment of subjects 12 years and older with 
intermittent allergic rhinitis (IAR). 
Secondary: The secondary objectives were to compare the effects of DL to those of 
placebo on quality of life and impact on productivity and health care utilization. 
Number of subjects: 547. 
Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion: Subjects 12 years of age or older, of either sex 
with at least a 2-year history consistent with allergic rhinitis who met the criteria for IAR 
(defined as symptoms of allergic rhinitis present less than four days per week or for less 
than four consecutive weeks per year) were to be included in the study. 
Duration of Treatment: 15 days.

Results 
Efficacy 
Primary  endpoint:  The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  on  the  change  from 
baseline in the subjects AM/PM PRIOR total 5 symptom score (T5SS) over Days 1 to 15 
of treatment. T5SS = Severity scores for five individual allergic rhinitis symptoms (nasal 
congestion/stuffiness,  sneezing,  rhinorrhea/nasal  discharge,  nasal  pruritus  and  ocular 
pruritus). Each symptom was scored 0 to 3. The scores were defined for T5SS as 0: no 
symptoms  to  15:  all  severe  symptoms.  Analyses  were  performed  using  an  analysis  of 
variance (ANOVA), extracting sources of variation due to treatment and site. 
A significantly greater decrease from baseline in the average AM/PM-PRIOR T5SS over 
days  1  to  15  was  seen  with  DL  vs.  Placebo  (-3.01  vs.  -2.13;  P<0.001).  Significantly 
greater decreases in AM/PM-PRIOR T5SS with DL vs. Placebo occurred from Day 1 (P= 
0.001) and on all 15 days of the study (P≤0.013). The significant effect of DL on T5SS 
endured across the full 24-hour dosing period (AM NOW T5SS) as early as the first full 
24-hour measurement on Day 2 (P< 0.001) and averaged over Days 2 to 15 (P< 0.001). 
Key Secondary Endpoint: The key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in 
the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ-S) Total Score at the Final 
Visit (Endpoint evaluation as LOCF to the Final Visit). The RQLQ-S was only completed 
for  subjects  ≥18  years  of  age.  The  RQLQ  Total  Score  was  analyzed  using  the  same 
ANOVA  as  specified  for  the  primary  endpoint.  A  significantly  greater  decrease 
(improvement) from baseline in total RQLQ-S score was seen in the DL group (-1.10 [-
38.2%])  vs  placebo  (-0.73  [-24.9%])  (P<  0.001)  at  the  study  endpoint.  Since  statistical 
significance of the primary efficacy variable was achieved, the overall alpha level of 5% 
is preserved for total RQLQ-S.  
The  RQLQ-S  domains  of  activity,  non-nose/eye  symptoms,  practical  problems,  nasal 
symptoms, eye symptoms and emotion scores were also significantly improved with DL 
vs  placebo  (P≤0.007).  Subjects  with  severe  symptom  score  (with  higher  baseline  diary 
T5SS  [≥8.5/15])  had  larger  improvements  from  baseline  in  total  RQLQ-S  with  DL  vs 
placebo, with an effect size (0.55). 
Secondary  endpoints:  In  addition  to  the  AM/PM  PRIOR  T5SS,  a  significantly  greater 
improvement  from  baseline  in  average  AM/PM  PRIOR  nasal  congestion  scores  over 
days 1 to 15 was seen with DL vs. Placebo (-0.56 vs. -0.43, respectively; P=0.013). This 
benefit  favoring  DL  was  seen  as  early  as  Day  1  of  treatment  (p<0.017).  Nasal 
congestion  was  significantly  lower  with  DL  vs.  Placebo  at  the  end    of  the  first  24-hour 
dosing interval (AM NOW Day 2; P≤0.001). Mean AM/PM PRIOR scores for rhinorrhea, 
sneezing and nasal itching were also significantly lower in the DL vs. Placebo on Day 1, 
over  week  1,  week  2  and  over  Days  1  to  15  (P≤0.033).    Eye  itching  was  significantly 
lower in the DL group over week 1 (P=0.021) and was numerically lower over Days 1 to 
15 (P= 0.051). Rhinorrhea, sneezing, eye itching and nasal itching scores at the end of 
the 24-hour dosing period (AM NOW) were significantly lower with DL at Day 2 ( end of 
the first 24- hour interval; (P≤0.035)) and across Days 2 to 15 (P≤0.036).  
A  significantly  greater  decrease  (improvement)  from  baseline  in  total  RQLQ  score  was 
seen in the DL group (-1.10 [-38.2%]) versus Placebo (-0.73 [-24.9%]) (P<0.001) at the 
study  endpoint.  The  RQLQ  domains  of  activity,  non-nose/eye  symptoms,  practical

problems,  nasal  symptoms,  eye  symptoms  and  emotion  scores  were  also  significantly 
improved  with  DL  versus  Placebo  (P≤0.007).  Subjects  with  severe  symptom  score  at 
baseline (higher baseline diary T5SS [≥8.5/15]) had larger improvements from baseline 
in total RQLQ with DL versus Placebo, with an effect size (0.55).  
The evaluation of therapeutic response by subjects in the DL 5- mg treatment group at 
the final visit (LOCF to the Final Visit) (3.24) was significantly lower (improved) than the 
evaluation of subjects in the placebo group (3.66) (P< 0.001).  
There  was  a  significantly  greater  decrease  from  baseline  in  the  VAS  score  with  DL  (-
17.2  [-30.6%])  versus  Placebo  (-10.9  [-17.0%])  (P<  0.001).  The  VAS  score  was 
significantly improved with DL on all treatment days.  
The  DL  group  had  greater  improvements  from  baseline  in  scores  for  interference  with 
sleep than placebo over the duration of the study (P= 0.039). The DL group had greater 
improvements from baseline in scores for interference with activities of daily living than 
placebo over the duration of the study (P< 0.001). 
Safety 
There  were  relatively  few  adverse  events  reported  by  the  subjects  in  this  study.  The 
overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  was  comparable  between  the 
DL 5-mg group (20.7%) and the Placebo group (21.0%). Additionally, neither treatment 
group  had  a  greater  frequency  of  any  adverse  event  relative  to  the  other  treatment 
group.  The  only  adverse  event  that  was  reported  by  more  than  5%  of  subjects  was 
headache,  which  was  reported  by  18  subjects  (6.5%)  in  the  DL  5-  mg  group  and  17 
subjects (6.3%) in the placebo group. No pattern of adverse events occurred at a greater 
frequency in the DL 5-mg group compared to the placebo group. The number of subjects 
who  experienced  treatment-related  adverse  events  was  similar  between  the  DL  5-mg 
treatment  group  (20  subjects  [7.2%])  and  the  placebo  group  (19  subjects  [7.0%]).  The 
most  frequently  occurring  treatment-related  adverse  event  was  headache,  which  was 
reported  by  7  subjects  (2.5%)  in  the  DL  5-  mg  group  and  by  5  subjects  (1.8%)  in  the 
placebo  group.  All  other  treatment-  emergent  adverse  events  occurred  in  <2%  of 
subjects  in  either  treatment  group.  There  were  no  deaths  or  severe  or  life-threatening 
adverse events in this study.

Efficacy 
Primary efficacy Variable: 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  performed  on  the  change  from  baseline  in  the 
subjects’ AM/PM PRIOR T5SS over days 1 to 29 of treatment. T5SS = Severity scores 
for  five  individual  allergic  rhinitis  symptoms  (nasal  congestion/stuffiness,  sneezing, 
rhinorrhea/nasal  discharge,  nasal  pruritus  and  ocular  pruritus).  Each  symptom  was 
scored 0 to 3. The scores were defined as 0: no symptoms to 15: all severe symptoms. 
Analyses were performed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA), extracting sources of 
variation due to treatment and site. 
A significantly greater decrease form baseline in the average AM/PM-PRIOR T5SS over 
days 1 to 29 was seen with DL vs placebo (-3.76 vs -2.87; p<0.001). Significantly greater 
decreases  were  observed  from  day  1  with  DL  vs  Placebo  in  AM/PM-PRIOR  T5SS 
(p=0.010) and with all individual symptom scores (p≤0.006) on Days 1 to 29. 
In  addition  to  the  T5SS,  a  significantly  greater  improvement  from  baseline  in  average 
AM/PM PRIOR nasal congestion scores over Days 1 to 29 was seen with DL vs Placebo 
(-  0.69  vs.  -  0.53,  respectively;  P=0.002).  Mean  AM/PM  PRIOR  scores  for  rhinorrhea 
and eye itching were significantly lower with DL vs Placebo as early as Day 1 (P≤0.042), 
score  for  sneezing  was  significantly  lower  with  DL  vs  Placebo  as  early  as  Day  2 
(P≤0.016), and nasal itching were significantly lower  with DL vs Placebo on Day 3 (P= 
0.005). 
Safety 
There  were  relatively  few  adverse  events  reported  by  the  subjects  in  this  study.  The 
overall  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  was  comparable  between  the 
DL  5  mg  group  (40.6%)  and  the  placebo  group  (34.6%).  The  DL  5  mg  group  had  a 
somewhat greater incidence of nasopharyngitis (10.6% vs 4.8%), somnolence (2.2% vs 
0.3%),  and  cough  (2.8%  vs  1.4%).  Subjects  in  the  placebo  group  had  a  somewhat 
greater  incidence  of  headache  (10.4%)  compared  to  the  DL  5  mg  group  (6.9%).  The 
only  adverse  events  that  were  reported  by  more  than  5%  of  subjects  were  headache, 
which was reported by 25 subjects (6.9%) in the DL 5 mg group and 37 subjects (10.4%) 
in the placebo group, and nasopharyngitis, which was reported by 38 subjects (10.6%) 
of subjects in the DL 5 mg group and by 17 subjects (4.8%) of subjects in the placebo 
group. The number of subjects who experienced treatment-related adverse events was 
similar  between  the  DL  5  mg  treatment  group  (36  subjects  [10.0%])  and  the  placebo 
group (30 subjects [8.4%]). The two most frequently occurring treatment-related adverse 
events were fatigue, which was reported by 7 subjects (1.9%) in the DL 5 mg group and 
by  9  subjects  (2.5%)  in  the  placebo  group  and  headache,  which  was  reported  by  6 
subjects (1.7%) in the DL 5 mg group and by 7 subjects (2.0%) in the placebo group. All 
other treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in < 2% of subjects 
in either treatment group.  
The  number  of  severe  adverse  events  was  similar  between  the  two  treatment  groups. 
Most  severe  adverse  events  were  only  reported  by  one  subject  each.  The  most 
commonly  reported  severe  adverse  events  were  headache,  which  was  reported  by  3 
subjects (0.8%) in the DL 5 mg group and by 5 subjects (1.4%) in the placebo group. In

addition  two  subjects  (0.6%)  in  the  placebo  group  also  reported  sinus  headaches  and 
one subject (0.3%) in the placebo group reported migraine that were considered severe 
by the investigator. Sinus headache and migraine were not reported by subjects in the 
DL 5 mg group. Fatigue and gastroenteritis were reported by three subjects (0.8%) and 
two subjects (0.6%), respectively in the DL 5 mg group. These two adverse events were 
not  reported  by  subjects  in  the  placebo  group.  All  other  severe  adverse  events  were 
reported by one subject each.  
There  was  one  life-threatening  adverse  event  reported  by  a  subject  in  the  placebo 
group.  Subject  No.  1449  experienced  a  myocardial  infarction  that  was  considered 
unrelated to study treatment. The subject was discontinued from the study.  
There were five severe adverse events (0.7%) that were considered by the investigator 
to  be  either  possibly  or  probably  related  to  study  treatment.  Three  severe  adverse 
events (0.7%) were reported by subjects in the DL 5 mg group and two severe adverse 
events (0.5%) were reported by subjects in the placebo group.  
There were three subjects (0.4%) who experienced four serious adverse events reported 
during the study. None of the serious adverse events were considered related to study 
treatment.  One  subject  (Subject  No.  1453)  in  the  DL  5-  mg  group  reported  a  serious 
adverse event (lower limb fracture). Two subjects in the placebo group reported serious 
adverse events. Subject No. 756 experienced a diverticulum intestinal and Subject No. 
1449  experienced  a  bronchospasm  and  acute  myocardial  infarction,  which  was 
considered  life  threatening  by  the  investigator.  One  subject  (Subject  No.  S00006)  who 
was  screened  but  was  not  randomized  to  study  drug  experienced  dizziness,  ataxia, 
nausea,  vomiting,  spondylosis  arterial  hypertension,  and  a  transient  ischemic  attack. 
The transient ischemic attach was considered life-threatening. 
A  total  of  23  subjects  (3.2%)  were  discontinued  from  the  study  because  of  adverse 
events: seven subjects (1.9%) in the DL 5-mg treatment group and 16 subjects (4.5%) in 
the  placebo  group.  One  subject  (Subject  No.  001453)  in  the  DL  5-mg  treatment  group 
and two subjects (Subject Nos. 000756 and 001449) in the placebo group had adverse 
events that were considered severe, but these adverse events were considered unlikely 
related  to  study  treatment  by  the  investigators.  One  of  the  adverse  events  (acute 
myocardial  infarction)  experienced  by  Subject  No.  001449  was  considered  life 
threatening by the investigator. All other adverse events that resulted in discontinuation 
from the study, including adverse events that were considered to be possibly or probably 
related to study drug, were considered to be mild-to-moderate in severity.  
Four  subjects  in  the  DL  5  mg  group  and  two  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  had  their 
treatment  interrupted  due  to  adverse  events.  All  adverse  event  leading  to  study  drug 
interruption were considered mild-to-moderate in severity and were considered unlikely 
related to study treatment.

Diagnosis and Criteria for Inclusion: Pediatric patients aged 1 to 5 years old with 
allergic rhinitis or chronic idiopathic urticaria. 
Duration of treatment: 1 to 9 weeks. 
Results 
Efficacy 
Efficacy  of  the  DL  1.25  mg  dose  of  Aerius  syrup  was  evaluated  and  measured  by  the 
amount of relief each subject experienced from the baseline visit to the final visit. Eighty-
eight subjects (88.9%) reported either marked or complete relief. Only two subjects (one 
subject with each condition) reported treatment failure.  
Most  subjects  (77  subjects)  showed  an  improvement  in  symptoms  from  Baseline  to 
Follow-up.  None  of  the  subjects  showed  a  worsening  of  symptoms  from  Baseline  to 
Follow-up, and only 22 subjects reported that their symptoms remained the same. Most 
subjects  (20  subjects  [20%])  who  reported  no  change  in  symptoms  evaluated  their 
symptoms as “mild” at Baseline, and two subjects (2.0%) evaluated their symptoms as 
“moderate”  at  Baseline.  There  were  four  subjects  whose  symptoms  were  “severe”  at 
Baseline. The symptoms of two of these subjects were improved to “moderate” and the 
symptoms of two of these subjects were improved to “mild”. 
Safety 
Forty-five  of  the  100  subjects  (45.0%)  reported  adverse  events  in  this  study.  Only  four 
adverse  events  were  reported  by  at  least  5%  of  subjects.  Vomiting  and  cough  were 
reported  by  6  subjects  (6.0%)  each  and  diarrhoea  and  bronchitis  were  reported  by  5 
subjects (5.0%) each.  
Ten subjects (10.0%) reported treatment-emergent adverse events that were considered 
possibly  related  to  treatment  with  desloratadine.  The  most  common  treatment-related, 
treatment-emergent adverse event was diarrhoea, which occurred in 4 subjects. Most of 
these  adverse  events  were  considered  mild-to-moderate  in  severity.  Subject  10/04 
experienced  emotional  distress  that  was  considered  severe  and  possibly  related  to 
treatment.  This  subject  discontinued  treatment  due  to  this  adverse  event.  No  other 
treatment-related adverse event was considered severe. 
 There were no life-threatening adverse events in this study. Two subjects experienced 
adverse  events  that  were  considered  severe.  Subject  10/04  experienced  emotional 
distress  that  was  considered  severe  and  possibly  related  to  treatment.  This  subject 
discontinued  treatment  due  to  this  adverse  event.  Subject  03/08  experienced  pyrexia, 
tonsillitis,  and  vomiting  that  were  considered  severe.  The  subject  also  experienced 
dehydration, which was considered moderate in severity, and resulted in interruption of 
treatment. These were serious adverse events that were considered unlikely related to 
treatment.

In adult men 
• 
Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital 
or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG) therapy. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with follitropin alfa should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in 
the treatment of fertility disorders. 
Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to 
use the proper injection techniques. 
Posology 
The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical 
assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment 
monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing 
medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. 
Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and 
shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered 
appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only 
in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian 
hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). 
Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) 
Follitropin alfa may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should 
commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. 
A commonly used regimen commences at 75 to 150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 
or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14-day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, 
response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring 
follicle size by ultrasound and/or estrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 
225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be 
abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence 
treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms recombinant human 
choriogonadotropin alfa (r-hCG) or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day 
of, and the day following hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination may be 
performed. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). 
Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. 
Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro 
fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies 
A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150 to 225 IU of 
follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate 
follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum estrogen concentrations 
and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually 
not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the 
tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 10 000 IU hCG is administered 24 to 
48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. 
Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now 
commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a 
commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist 
treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, 
following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150 to 225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for 
the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. 
Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during 
the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. 
Women with severe LH and FSH deficiency 
In LH and FSH deficient women, the objective of follitropin alfa therapy in association with a 
luteinising  hormone (LH) preparation is to promote follicular development followed by final 
maturation after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be 
given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. If the patient is amenorrhoeic 
and has low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. 
A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75 to 150 IU FSH. Treatment 
should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by 
ultrasound and estrogen response. 
If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7 to 14-day 
intervals and preferably by 37.5 to 75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of 
stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. 
When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5 000 IU up to 
10 000 IU hCG should be administered 24 to 48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa 
injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG 
administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction 
procedure may be performed based on the physician’s judgment of the clinical case. 
Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) 
after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. 
If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should 
recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle (see section 4.4). 
Men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism 
Follitropin alfa should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a 
minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment 
may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be 
necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. Safety and efficacy of follitropin 
alfa in elderly patients have not been established. 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
have not been established. 
Paediatric population

There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
Bemfola is intended for subcutaneous use. The injection should be given at the same time each day. 
The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-
administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately 
trained and have access to expert advice. 
The injection site should be alternated daily. 
As the Bemfola pre-filled pen with the single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear 
instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation. 
For instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the package leaflet.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
General recommendations 
Follitropin alfa is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse 
reactions and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems 
and their management. 
Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care 
professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and 
effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of the ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or 
preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may 
be a degree of inter-patient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH 
in some patients and exaggerated response in others. The lowest effective dose in relation to the 
treatment objective should be used in both men and women. 
Porphyria 
Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment 
with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment. 
Treatment in women 
Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative 
contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for 
hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment 
given. 
Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or 
ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the 
recommended follitropin alfa dose and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy 
will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle 
development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant 
tests. 
In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered 
with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably 
be at 7- to 14-day intervals and preferably with 37.5 to 75 IU increments. 
No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been 
performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin 
alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. 
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) 
A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is 
more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without 
treatment. 
In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with 
increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and 
an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, 
pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. 
The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms 
including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, 
haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, 
hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian 
torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial 
infarction. 
Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian 
syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotropins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol 
levels and previous episodes of OHSS, large number of developing ovarian follicles and large number 
of oocytes retrieved in assisted reproductive technology (ART) cycles. 
Adherence to recommended follitropin alfa dose and regimen of administration can minimise the risk 
of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound 
scans as well as estradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. 
There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may 
be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian 
hyperstimulation occur such as a serum estradiol level > 5 500 pg/mL or > 20 200 pmol/L and/or 
≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain 
from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly 
(within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days 
following treatment. Therefore, patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG 
administration. 
In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. 
Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended 
that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised, and 
appropriate therapy be started. 
Multiple pregnancy 
In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of a multiple pregnancy is increased 
compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple 
pregnancy, especially of high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal 
outcomes. 
To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. 
In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of a multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the 
number of embryos replaced, their quality and the patient age. 
The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. 
Pregnancy loss 
The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing 
stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. 
Ectopic pregnancy 
Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is 
obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy 
after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. 
Reproductive system neoplasms 
There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and 
malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is 
not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in 
infertile women. 
Congenital malformation 
The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous 
conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, 
sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. 
Thromboembolic events 
In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk 
factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins 
may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the 
benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted 
however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. 
Treatment in men 
Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are 
unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective 
response cannot be obtained. 
Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assessment of the response. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation 
(e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a 
GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa 
needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant medicinal product 
interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There is no indication for use of follitropin alfa during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of 
exposed pregnancies (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal 
toxicity of follitropin alfa. 
No teratogenic effect has been observed in animal studies (see section 5.3). In case of exposure during 
pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of follitropin alfa. 
Breast-feeding 
Follitropin alfa is not indicated during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
Follitropin alfa is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Follitropin alfa has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site 
reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). 
Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and 
should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see 
section 4.4). 
Thromboembolism may occur very rarely (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins, 
ATC code: G03GA05. 
Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product. Detailed information is available on the website of the 
European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. 
Mechanism of action 
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted from the anterior 
pituitary gland in response to GnRH and play a complementary role in follicle development and 
ovulation. FSH stimulates the development of ovarian follicles, while LH action is involved in follicle 
development, steroidogenesis and maturation. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Inhibin and estradiol (E2) levels are raised after administration of r-hFSH, with subsequent induction 
of follicular development. Inhibin serum level increase is rapid and can be observed as early as the 
third day of r-hFSH administration, while E2 levels take more time, and an increase is observed only 
from the fourth day of treatment. Total follicular volume starts to increase after 4 to 5 days of r-hFSH 
daily dosing, and, depending on patient response, the maximum effect is reached after about 10 days 
from the start of r-hFSH administration. 
Clinical efficacy and safety in women 
In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum 
LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that 
there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. 
In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table below) and 
in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose 
and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. 
In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in 
a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH.

Clinical efficacy and safety in men 
In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months 
induces spermatogenesis. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa when administered 
simultaneously. 
Distribution 
Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with 
an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of 14 to 
17 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is in the range of 9 to 11 L. 
Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is 66% and the apparent terminal 
half-life is in the range of 24 to 59 hours. Dose proportionality after subcutaneous administration was 
demonstrated up to 900 IU. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold 
achieving a steady-state within 3 to 4 days.  
Elimination 
Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and about 12% of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and 
repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity in addition to those already stated in the other sections of this 
SmPC. 
Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa 
(≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. 
Given in high doses (≥ 5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses 
without being teratogenic, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary menopausal gonadotropin 
(hMG). However, since follitropin alfa is not indicated in pregnancy, these data are of limited clinical 
relevance.

Contents of the pack and other information  
1.  What Bemfola is and what it is used for 
What Bemfola is 
This medicine contains the active substance follitropin alfa, which is almost identical to a natural 
hormone produced by your body called “follicle-stimulating hormone” (FSH). FSH is a gonadotropin, 
a type of hormone that plays an important role in human fertility and reproduction. In women, FSH is 
needed for the growth and development of the sacs (follicles) in the ovaries that contain the egg cells. 
In men, FSH is needed for the production of sperm. 
What Bemfola is used for 
In adult women, Bemfola is used: 
• 
• 
• 
to help release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women that cannot ovulate and that did not 
respond to treatment with a medicine called “clomiphene citrate”. 
together with another medicine called “lutropin alfa” (“luteinising hormone” or LH) to help 
release an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women whose body is producing very little 
gonadotropins (FSH and LH). 
to help develop several follicles (each containing an egg) in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology procedures (procedures that may help you to become pregnant) such as 
“in vitro fertilisation”, “gamete intra-fallopian transfer” or “zygote intra-fallopian transfer”. 
In adult men, Bemfola is used: 
• 
together with another medicine called “human chorionic gonadotropin” (hCG) to help produce 
sperm in men that are infertile due to a low level of certain hormones.

You and your partner’s fertility should be evaluated before the treatment is started by a doctor 
experienced in treating fertility disorders. 
Do not use Bemfola 
• 
if you are allergic to follicle stimulating hormone or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
if you have a tumour in your hypothalamus or pituitary gland (both are parts of the brain). 
if you are a woman: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
with large ovaries or sacs of fluids within the ovaries (ovarian cysts) of unknown origin. 
with unexplained vaginal bleeding. 
with cancer in your ovaries, womb or breasts. 
with a condition that usually makes normal pregnancy impossible, such as ovarian failure 
(early menopause), or malformed reproductive organs. 
if you are a man: 
- 
with damaged testicles that cannot be healed. 
• 
• 
• 
Do not use Bemfola if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor before 
using this medicine. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using Bemfola. 
Porphyria 
Tell your doctor before you start treatment, if you or any member of your family have porphyria (an 
inability to break down porphyrins that may be passed on from parents to children). 
Tell your doctor straight away if: 
• 
your skin becomes fragile and easily blistered, especially skin that has been frequently in the 
sun, and/or 
you have stomach, arm or leg pain. 
• 
In case of the above events your doctor may recommend that you stop treatment. 
Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
If you are a woman, this medicine increases your risk of developing OHSS. This is when your follicles 
develop too much and become large cysts. If you get lower abdominal pain, gain any weight rapidly, 
feel sick or are vomiting or if you have difficulty in breathing, talk to your doctor straight away who 
might ask you to stop using this medicine (see section 4). 
In case you are not ovulating, and if the recommended dose and schedule of administration are 
adhered to, the occurrence of OHSS is less likely. Bemfola treatment seldom causes severe OHSS 
unless the medicine that is used for final follicular maturation (containing human chorionic 
gonadotropin, hCG) is administered. If you are developing OHSS your doctor may not give you any 
hCG in this treatment cycle and you may be told not to have sex or to use a barrier contraceptive 
method for at least four days. 
Multiple pregnancy 
When using Bemfola, you have a higher risk of being pregnant with more than one child at the same 
time (“multiple pregnancy”, mostly twins), than if you conceived naturally. Multiple pregnancy may 
lead to medical complications for you and your babies. You can reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy 
by using the right dose of Bemfola at the right times. When undergoing assisted reproductive 
technology, the risk of having a multiple pregnancy is related to your age, the quality and the number 
of fertilised eggs or embryos placed inside you. 
Miscarriage 
When undergoing assisted reproductive technology or stimulation of your ovaries to produce eggs, 
you are more likely to have a miscarriage than the average woman. 
Blood clotting problems (thromboembolic events) 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you had in the past or recently blood clots in the leg or in the lung, or a heart attack or stroke, or if 
those happened in your family, then you might have a higher risk that these problems occur or become 
worse with Bemfola treatment. 
Men with too much FSH in their blood 
If you are a man, having too much FSH in your blood can be a sign of damaged testicles. Bemfola 
usually does not work if you have this problem. If your doctor decides to try Bemfola treatment, to 
monitor the treatment, they may ask you to provide semen for analysis 4 to 6 months after starting 
treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
Bemfola is not indicated for use in children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Bemfola 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
• 
If you use Bemfola with other medicines which help ovulation (such as hCG or clomiphene 
citrate), this may increase the response of your follicles. 
If you use Bemfola at the same time as a “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) agonist or 
antagonist (these medicines reduce your sex hormone levels and stop you ovulating) you may 
need a higher dose of Bemfola to produce follicles. 
• 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Do not use Bemfola if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. 
Bemfola contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially “sodium-
free”. 
3.  How to use Bemfola 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
Using this medicine 
• 
Bemfola is intended to be given by injection just under the skin (subcutaneously). Use each pre-
filled pen only once then they should be disposed of in a safe manner. Do not administered the 
solution if it contains particles or is not clear. 
The first injection of Bemfola should be given under supervision of your doctor. 
Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use the Bemfola pre-filled pen to inject the medicine 
yourself. 
If you administer Bemfola to yourself, please carefully read and follow the “Instructions for 
Use”. These instructions can be found at the end of the package leaflet. 
• 
• 
• 
How much to use 
Your doctor will decide how much medicine you will take and how often. The doses described below 
are stated in International Units (IU) and millilitres (mL). 
Women 
If you are not ovulating and have irregular or no periods 
• 
• 
Bemfola is usually given every day. 
If you have irregular periods, start using Bemfola within the first 7 days of your menstrual 
cycle. If you do not have periods you can start using the medicine on any convenient day. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The usual starting dose of Bemfola is 75 to 150 IU (0.12 to 0.25 mL) each day. 
Your dose of Bemfola may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get 
the desired response. 
The maximum daily dose of Bemfola is usually not higher than 225 IU (0.375 mL). 
• 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last Bemfola injection. The best time to 
have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
If your doctor cannot see a desired response after 4 weeks, that treatment cycle with Bemfola should 
be stopped. For the following treatment cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of 
Bemfola than before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment will be stopped and you will not be given any hCG 
(see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following cycle, your doctor 
will give you a lower dose of Bemfola than before. 
If you have been diagnosed with very low levels of FSH and LH hormones 
• 
The usual starting dose of Bemfola is 75 to 150 IU (0.12 to 0.25 mL) together with 75 IU 
(0.12 mL) of lutropin alfa. 
You will use these two medicines each day for up to five weeks. 
Your dose of Bemfola may be increased every 7 or every 14 days by 37.5 to 75 IU, until you get 
the desired response. 
• 
• 
•  When you get the desired response, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms of 
“recombinant hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special DNA technique), or 
5 000 to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after your last injections of Bemfola and lutropin 
alfa. The best time to have sex is on the day of the hCG injection and the day after. 
Alternatively, intrauterine insemination or another medically assisted reproduction procedure 
may be performed based on your doctor’s judgment. 
If your doctor cannot see a response after 5 weeks, that treatment cycle with Bemfola should be 
stopped. For the following cycle, your doctor will give you a higher starting dose of Bemfola than 
before. 
If your body responds too strongly, your treatment with Bemfola will be stopped and you will not be 
given any hCG (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). For the following 
cycle, your doctor will give you a lower dose of Bemfola than before. 
If you need to develop several eggs for collection prior to any assisted reproductive technology 
• 
The usual starting dose of Bemfola is 150 to 225 IU (0.25 to 0.37 mL) each day, from day 2 or 3 
of your treatment cycle. 
Bemfola dose may be increased, depending on your response. The maximum daily dose is 
450 IU (0.75 mL). 
Treatment is continued until your eggs have developed to a desired point. This usually takes 
about 10 days but can take any time between 5 and 20 days. Your doctor will use blood tests 
and/or an ultrasound machine to check when this is. 
• 
• 
•  When your eggs are ready, you will be given a single injection of 250 micrograms “recombinant 
hCG” (r-hCG, an hCG made in a laboratory by a special recombinant DNA technique), or 
5 000 IU to 10 000 IU of hCG, 24 to 48 hours after the last Bemfola injection. This gets your 
eggs ready for collection. 
In other cases, your doctor may first stop you from ovulating by using a gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Then Bemfola is started approximately two weeks after start 
of agonist treatment. The Bemfola and GnRH agonist are then both given until your follicles develop 
as desired. For example, after two weeks of GnRH agonist treatment, 150 to 225 IU Bemfola is 
administered for 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to your ovarian response.  
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Men 
• 
• 
• 
The usual dose of Bemfola is 150 IU (0.25 mL) together with hCG. 
You will use these two medicines three times a week for at least 4 months. 
If you have not responded to treatment after 4 months, your doctor may suggest that you 
continue using these two medicines for at least 18 months. 
If you use more Bemfola than you should 
The effects of taking too much Bemfola are unknown. Nevertheless, one could expect ovarian hyper-
stimulation syndrome (OHSS) to occur, which is described in section 4. However, the OHSS will only 
occur if hCG is also administered (see section 2, “Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS)”). 
If you forget to use Bemfola 
If you forget to use Bemfola, do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Please talk to 
your doctor as soon as you notice that you forgot a dose. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects in women 
• 
Lower abdominal pain together with nausea or vomiting may be the symptoms of ovarian 
hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHSS). This may indicate that the ovaries over-reacted to the 
treatment and that large ovarian cysts developed (see also section 2 “Ovarian hyper-stimulation 
syndrome (OHSS)”). This side effect is common (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). 
The OHSS may become severe with clearly enlarged ovaries, decreased urine production, 
weight gain, difficulty in breathing and/or possible fluid accumulation in your stomach or chest. 
This side effect is uncommon (may affect up to 1 in 100 people). 
Complications of OHSS such as twisting of ovaries or blood clotting may occur rarely (may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people). 
Serious blood clotting complications (thromboembolic events) sometimes independent of OHSS 
may be found very rarely (may affect up to 1 in 10 000 people). This could cause chest pain, 
breathlessness, stroke or heart attack (see also section 2, “Blood clotting 
problems(thromboembolic events)”).

• 
• 
• 
Before starting to use your pre-filled pens, please read the full Instructions for use and the 
package leaflet carefully. 
Each pre-filled pen is only for your single use – do not let anyone else use it. 
The numbers on the dose display of the pre-filled pens are measured in International Units or 
IU. Your doctor will have told you how many IU to inject each day. 
Your doctor/pharmacist will tell you how many pre-filled Bemfola pens for single use you 
need to use for your complete treatment course. 
Give yourself the injection around the same time each day. 
2. 
Before you start using your pre-filled pen 
2.1.  Take the pen out of the fridge 
• 
• 
Take one of your pens out of the fridge 5 to 10 minutes before using it. 
If the medicine is frozen, then please do not use it. 
2.2.  Wash your hands 
•  Wash your hands with soap and warm water, and dry them.  
• 
It is important that your hands and the things you use to get your pen ready are as clean as 
possible. 
2.3.  Find a clean area 
• 
A good place is a clean table or surface.

Perform the injection every day around the 
same time. Take the pen out of the fridge 5 to 
10 minutes before using it. 
Note: Please check that the medicine is not 
frozen. 
Prepare your needle for injection 
Get a new needle - only use the single-use 
needles supplied in the package. Hold the 
outer needle cap firmly. 
Check in all cases that the peel-off seal on the 
outer needle cap is not damaged or loose. 
Remove the peel-off seal from the injection 
needle. 
Caution: If the peel-off seal is damaged or 
loose, do not use the needle. Throw it away in 
a sharps disposal container. Get a new 
needle.

Attach the needle. 
Hold the pen by its sides and keep the needle 
in line with it while attaching the needle. 
Screw the needle clockwise onto the tip of 
the pen all the way until firmly attached. 
Make sure that the needle is properly secured 
on the pen in a straight position. 
Caution: Do not overtighten the needle. 
Do not push the dosage knob in while 
attaching the needle. 
Remove the outer needle cap (G). Keep it 
for later. You will need it after the 
injection to discard the pen.

4. 
Setting the dose prescribed by your doctor 
First, hold the pen so that the needle is pointing 
upwards. To remove the air bubbles from the 
system, gently tap the side of the pen to make 
the existing air bubbles rise to the top. 
Still holding the pen upright, push the dosage 
knob in until the activation bar with the small 
arrow disappears. You should also hear a click, 
and some liquid will splash out (this is 
normal).The pen is now ready to set the dose. 
Caution: If no liquid splashes out, or liquid 
leakage is detected at the junction of the needle 
and the pen, the pen should not be used. Tell 
your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any 
problems. 
Gently turn the dosage knob until the bar of 
your prescribed dose is in line with the middle 
of the indent on the pen. 
Note: For the Bemfola 75 IU/0.125 mL pre-
filled pen, the dosage knob cannot go around 
completely, but it can still be rotated 
backwards. 
The pen is now ready for injection. 
Caution: Do not push the dosage knob in any 
further, at this point.

5. 
Injecting the dose 
Now you are ready to immediately give yourself the injection: Your doctor or nurse will have 
already advised you where to inject (e.g. tummy, front of thigh). To minimise skin irritation, 
select a different injection site each day. 
Clean the injection site 
with the alcohol swab 
available in the package, 
using a circular motion. 
Wait for a few seconds 
until the alcohol has 
evaporated from the skin 
and it is dry before 
injecting. 
Check again that the 
correct dose is displayed 
on the pen. Lightly pinch 
the skin of the injection 
area. Hold the pen at 
approximately a right 
angle (900 angle) and 
insert the needle 
completely in one steady 
movement into your skin. 
Caution: Do not push the 
dosage knob, while 
inserting the needle and 
do not change the 
direction of the needle as 
it goes in. 
Once the needle is fully 
inserted in the injection 
site, push in the dosage 
knob slowly and 
continuously until it 
stops, and the bar of the 
set dose has disappeared. 
Do not remove the needle 
immediately, wait at least 
for 5 seconds, before 
pulling it out to ensure 
you have injected the full 
dose. 
After the withdrawal of 
the needle: clean the skin 
with an alcohol swab 
using a circular motion at 
the injection site. 
Caution: If liquid 
leakage is detected at the 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
junction of the needle 
and the pen during 
injecting, tell your doctor 
or pharmacist. 
52 
 
 
6. 
After the injection 
Replace the outer needle cap onto the needle 
carefully. 
You can use the pre-filled injection pen only 
once and must discard the pen even if any liquid 
remains in the pen after injection.  
Throw away the packaging box, inner needle 
cap, peel tab, alcohol swab and the Instructions 
for use in the normal household waste. Do not 
throw away any medicines via your sink, toilet 
or in your household waste. The used pen needs 
to be discarded in a sharps container and 
returned to the pharmacy for a correct disposal. 
Ask your pharmacist how to dispose of 
medicines you no longer use.

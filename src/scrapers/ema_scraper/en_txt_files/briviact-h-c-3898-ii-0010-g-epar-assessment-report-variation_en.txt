2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Brivaracetam displays a high and selective affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) in the 
brain. Binding to SV2A is believed to be the primary mechanism for BRV anticonvulsant activity. 
Brivaracetam was first approved in January 2016 by the EMA as adjunctive therapy in the 
treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adult and 
adolescent patients from 16 years of age with epilepsy.  
Three pharmaceutical formulations are available: 
- 
Film coated immediate-release tablets (strengths: 10mg, 25mg, 50mg, 75mg and 100mg) 
-  Solution for injection/infusion (10mg/mL) 
-  Oral solution (10mg/mL) 
Brivaracetam is approved for use at doses between 50 and 200 mg/day. In adults, initial dose 
titration to an effective dose is not required for tolerability. 
The scope of this variation is extension of the indication for brivaracetam (BRV) as adjunctive 
therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures (POS) down to 4 years of age in paediatric 
patients. Doses of 1mg/kg/day to 4mg/kg/day are proposed for the treatment of children and 
adolescents <50kg, the adult dose range is proposed for adolescents 50kg or greater. In addition, 
the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) proposed to add a 5ml oral syringe and adaptor in the 
oral solution (10mg/mL) presentation for the paediatric population. 
No clinical study data supporting the efficacy of BRV in children ≥4 to <16 years of age are 
included in this application. Previously submitted adult efficacy data of BRV as therapy for the 
treatment of POS in adults is referred. Pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling and the bridging of clinical 
evidence support the dosing recommendations to children with POS. 
Efficacy extrapolation of adult data to the paediatric population was discussed with the Scientific 
Advice Working Party (SAWP) during the 2011 EMA Scientific Advice procedure 
(EMEA/H/SA/1570/3/2011/PED/II) for Vimpat. 
The BRV Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) (EMEA-000332-PIP01-08) included a systematic 
review of the literature of all published trials focusing on the possibility of extrapolating efficacy 
from adults to paediatric patients with POS . 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Quality variation of this Grouped variation application: Type 1Ain B.IV.1a.1: Addition of a 5 ml oral 
syringe dosing device to accommodate smaller volumes  
Introduction 
The available approved formulations of Briviact are film-coated tablets of the 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 
mg, 75 mg and 100 mg strengths; Oral solution 10 mg/ml; Solution for injection/infusion 
10 mg/ml.  
In connection with the Type II variation application for extension of the indication from adults and 
Assessment report

adolescents from 16 years old, to include children from 4 years of age, the Applicant wishes to 
introduce an additional oral dosage syringe of 5 ml. This is to provide for the accurate 
administration of the oral solution in the target age group. A CE-marked 10 ml oral syringe is 
already approved for use with the oral solution.  A syringe adaptor for the product bottle is also 
utilised, the same adaptor is used for the 5 ml syringe as for the approved 10 ml syringe.  
To support the introduction of the 5 ml oral syringe, updated Module 3 sections have been 
provided.  
The addition of the oral dosing syringe affects Section 6.5 of the SmPC of the Briviact oral solution 
and revision has been made to the product information.  
No justifications as to the appropriateness of the available formulations for the paediatric 
population in line with the Guideline on pharmaceutical development of medicines for paediatric 
use EMA/CHMP/QWP/805880/2012 Rev.2 were provided in the original submission and this was 
requested. During the procedure adequate and acceptable justifications have been provided by the 
applicant. 
2.2.1.  Discussion on quality aspects 
Oral dosing syringe 
The 5 ml (and 10 ml) oral dosing syringes are classified by the manufacturer as Class I, non-sterile 
with measuring function, medical devices, according to Annex IX, rule number 5 of the Council 
Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices as amended by Directive 2007/47/EC and have 
been CE marked according to Annex V of the European Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical 
devices as amended by Directive 2007/47/EC.  
The materials of the 5 ml syringe are the same as for the already approved 10 ml dose syringe 
(polypropylene barrel and high density polyethylene plunger). The syringe complies with Ph. Eur. 
3.2.2 Plastic containers and closures for pharmaceutical use and EC regulations as laid down in the 
EEC Commission directive 2002/72 EEC (relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come 
into contact with foodstuffs) and amendments for plastic materials as well as regulatory 
requirements for food-contact materials. The identity of the plastic materials is verified by IR 
spectrometry. Drawings of the syringe components have been provided.  
The 5 mL dosing syringe has graduations from 0.3 mL to 5.0 mL (3 mg to 50 mg) in 0.1 mL (1 mg) 
intervals and from 0.25 mL to 5.0 mL (2.5 mg to 50 mg) in 0.25 mL (2.5 mg) intervals and the 10 
ml syringe has graduations from 1 mL to 10 mL (10 mg to 100 mg) in 0.25 mL (2.5 mg) intervals  
During the procedure the applicant was requested to provide  a sample of the 5 ml syringe  for the 
assessment of the graduation markings. Two separate scales are marked on the device (one side 
with 0.1 ml increments and the other side with 0.25 ml increments) and it was not evident that 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 9/112 
 
  
  
 
 
these are sufficiently clear to interpret for the user. The Applicant has in his response provided a 
sample of the 5 ml syringe.  The markings were considered by the CHMP sufficiently clear and 
acceptable.  
Dose accuracy 
The CHMP considers that the dosing accuracy of the 5 ml oral syringe has been acceptably 
demonstrated and the syringe complies with the requirements of Ph Eur 2.9.27 Uniformity of mass 
of delivered doses from multi-dose containers. The following volumes were tested: 0.25 ml, 2.5 ml 
and 5 ml. Also the 10 ml oral syringe has shown compliance for dose accuracy at 1.0 ml, 5.0 ml 
and 10.0 ml.  
Doses of the oral solution  
In children, the dose is defined based on the patient’s weight. The 10 mL dosing syringe is however 
not considered a sufficiently accurate dosing device for administration of Briviact 10mg/mL oral 
solution in children aged between 4 and 16 years of age weighing less than 20 kg. Therefore, UCB 
would like to introduce a 5mL plastic syringe dosing device to allow accurate dosing of Briviact 
10mg/mL oral solution in the youngest paediatric population proposed in this application.  
The 5 mL plastic syringe dosing device will be presented as an additional dosing device and will not 
replace the currently approved 10 mL dosing syringe. Initially, the intention was to provide the 
5 ml oral syringe and the 10 ml oral syringe in different package presentations, The 5 mL plastic 
syringe would have been the dosing device for the Briviact 10 mg/mL oral solution package for 
treatment of children weighing less than 20 kg and the 10 mL dosing syringe would remain the 
dosing device for the 10 mg/mL oral solution package for treatment of adults and adolescents and 
children weighing 20 kg or more.  
The CHMP considered that two different presentations of the oral solution – one with a 5 ml oral 
syringe and another with a 10 ml syringe – are not appropriate and therefore both syringes should 
be available in all packages with the bottle of 300 ml product. This would, for example avoid the 
risk of dispensing the wrong presentation (not containing the age appropriate syringe) at the 
pharmacy. Also, the placement of both the oral dosing syringes within the same pack would result 
useful especially for borderline weighed children, thus warranting to reduce the risk of dosing 
errors while providing the patients with the opportunity to adequately choose the correct device, 
according to the clinician’s prescription. Therefore, the CHMP concluded that only one 300mL pack 
of oral solution containing both dosing devices (5mL and 10mL syringes) should be marketed.  
In addition, section 6.5 of the SmPC for the oral solution was revised: “or” should be replaced with 
“and” in order to indicate that both syringes should be packaged into each carton.  
Suitability of formulations for the paediatric population 4-16 years of age  
The Applicant has justified the levels of the various excipients. The amount of preservative was 
minimised whilst still maintaining adequate preservation. The amounts of other excipients are 
below the levels recommended in relevant EU guidance. The palatability of the oral solution in 
paediatric patients has been adequately addressed.   
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the quality aspects 
The CHMP considers that the dosing accuracy of the 5 ml oral syringe has been acceptably 
demonstrated. The palatability of the oral solution in paediatric patients has been adequately 
addressed therefore the formulation is considered suitable for the paediatric population 4-16 years 
of age.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics or toxicology data have been submitted to 
support the extension of indication to include adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset 
seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients with epilepsy 4 years of age and older 
for Briviact. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In the initial MAA (EMEA/H/C/003898, 2016), Briviact was approved in the same indication in 
patients from 16 years of age. 
Juvenile toxicity studies were included in the initial MAA of Briviact and are briefly summarized in 
section 2.3.2. 
An updated ERA has also been submitted. The updated ERA includes a new water sediment 
degradation study as requested by the CHMP and accounts for the extension of indication to 
include paediatric populations. 
2.3.2.  Toxicology  
No new non-clinical toxicology data was submitted by the MAH. A summary of juvenile toxicity data 
included in the initial MAA of Briviact (EMEA/H/C/003898) originating from the EPAR is presented 
below: 
Juvenile toxicity studies 
Juvenile rats and dogs were evaluated from postnatal day 4 to 70 and 4 to 276, respectively, 
corresponding to neonatal to early (0 to 12 years) and adolescent (12 to 18 years) stages of 
development in humans.  
Juvenile rats were dosed by oral gavage at 150, 300 and 600 mg/kg between postnatal day 4 to 
70, followed by a 30-day recovery period. The main findings were lower absolute brain weights, -
5.2% to -11.4% at 600 mg/kg in males and females on postnatal days 22, 71 and 100, 
corresponding with shorter brain length and width. At 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg, the lower 
absolute brain weights were of lesser amplitude (-0.1% to -6.5%). There were no relevant 
differences in relative brain weights between control and treated groups and there was no 
histopathology observed at any dose. In addition, there were no adverse effects in any of the 
behavioral tests performed, apart from a slightly increased startle response on postnatal day 78 in 
males and females in the high-dose group. An additional study in rats at postnatal days 22, 71 and 
100 showed that mean absolute and relative (to final body weight) brain weights were similar 
within sexes in untreated animals on the three days studied. The percentage of variation between 
maximum and minimum absolute brain weight values within the three evaluation ages ranged from 
-12% to -26% for males and from -14% to -19% for females. Thus, the differences seen in the 
brivaracetam treated juvenile rats were within the range of differences seen inter-individually at 
the same developmental ages in untreated rats.  
Reversible centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, accompanied with higher liver weights, was 
observed in both sexes. The size and number of hyaline droplets in the kidneys of males given 300 
mg/kg or 600 mg/kg increased on postnatal day 71, a finding that was no longer present on 
postnatal day 100. The hyaline droplets were considered a male rat-specific change. Lower 
prostate weight in males given 600 mg/kg, only on postnatal day 71, was without concurrent 
histological findings. All the findings in the liver and kidney were also seen in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in adult rats. The NOAEL for rat pup growth and development, including CNS development, 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 11/112 
 
  
  
was set at 150 mg/kg in females and 300mg/kg in males, giving exposure margin to maximum 
human exposure of 4. The NOAEL for reproductive toxicity was 600 mg/kg, giving an exposure to 
maximum human exposure of 10. Exposure margins in adult rats, based on NOAEL and AUC values 
derived from the main repeat-dose toxicity study, generate a margin to clinically relevant exposure 
of approximately 5 to 8.  
In addition to studies in rats, juvenile dogs were dosed by oral gavage at 15, 30 and 100 mg/kg 
between postnatal day 4 to 276 (9 months duration), followed by a 56-day recovery period. The 
main findings concerned a partially to fully reversible decrease in thyroid hormone T4 level, seen 
mainly in females given 100 mg/kg. At the same dose, changes in the liver parameters were noted, 
as well as brown pigment accumulation (most likely porphyrin), centrilobular and periportal 
fibrosis, bile duct hyperplasia, hepatocellular hypertrophy and degeneration, associated with higher 
liver weights and concretion in the gall bladder. The effects on the liver were partially or fully 
reversible, apart from the brown pigment accumulation and concretion in the gall bladder. A 
reversible decrease in thymus weight in females was also seen and was accompanied by a slight 
increase in severity of thymic atrophy. All the findings in the liver, thyroid and thymus were also 
seen in repeat-dose toxicity studies in adult dogs. In another study in juvenile dogs, the pups were 
dosed at 15, 50 and 100 mg/kg between postnatal days 4 to 31. In males only, a lower bone 
mineral content, bone area and bone mineral density in femur was seen, as well as a shorter 
femoral length, lower bone mineral content and density in L3-L5 lumbar vertebral column. 
However, these effects were not seen in the longer duration, main 9-month study in juvenile dogs 
using the same dosage regimen. The NOAEL for dog pup growth and development, including CNS 
development, was set at 30 mg/kg, giving no margin to maximum human exposure. Similarly, in 
adult dogs, based on NOAEL and AUC values derived from the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study, 
no margin was observed to clinically relevant exposure. 
2.3.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted in the initial MAA of Briviact 
(EMEA/H/C/003898). As summarized in the EPAR, brivaracetam is not readily biodegradable and is 
not expected to bioaccumulate in aquatic systems. Furthermore, brivaracetam does not persist in 
water-sediment systems, and is degraded to one extractable metabolite and several polar 
metabolites. Overall, the CHMP concluded that brivaracetam is unlikely to represent a risk to the 
environment under the proposed conditions of use. However, the CHMP recommended that the 
water sediment degradation study be repeated and additional information on the identity of 
metabolites appearing at a concentration higher than 10% in the total water-sediment system at 
one or more sampling points be submitted post-authorization. As part of this procedure, a new 
water sediment degradation study (OECD 308, GLP) has been submitted and the ERA has been 
updated to account for the extension of indication to include paediatric populations. 
Phase 1 
PREDICTED ENVIRONMENTAL CONCENTRATIONS (PEC) 
Surface water 
In the original ERA, a predicted environmental concentration (PEC) for surface water of 1 µg/L was 
determined using the following equation, and based on the maximum daily dose of 200 mg and 
default values for FPEN, WASTEWINH and  Dilution. 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 12/112 
 
  
  
  
In the new indication for the use of brivaracetam in paediatric indications, the maximum daily 
dosage has not changed (200 mg for adults and children). 
The share of brivaracetam in the total paediatric population is estimated to be in the range of 0.02 
to 0.03% across various European Union Member States in the peak use year of 2025 (UCB 
internal information). Assuming that brivaracetam is the only drug used for paediatric epilepsy 
treatment, a refined FPEN can be estimated as follows: 
Where: 
FPEN: Market penetration factor, 
PREGION: Prevalence in the region (average), 
TTREATMENT: Duration of one treatment period (assumed to be 365 days/year for a 
conservative estimate), 
nTREATMENT,P: Number of treatment periods per year (since the treatment is assumed to 
continue throughout the year, this is considered to be 1), 
ND: Number of days per year 
Hence, FPEN = 0.03 x 365 x 1/365 = 0.03% considering only the paediatric population. The value is 
lower if total population is taken into account, knowing that on average children of 0 to 14 years 
old represent 13 to 22% of the total population in the EU-28 (Eurostat: 
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ statistics-explained/index.php/Population_structure_and_ageing). 
Given the above estimations, the additional indication is therefore not expected to impact the 
default FPEN value of 0.01 previously used for the PECSurface water calculation. FPEN can therefore be 
kept at 0.01.As a consequence, the existing PECSurface Water of 1 µg/L remains valid.  
Environmental fate – follow-up water-sediment study 
A second water sediment study was performed in 2016-2017 in accordance with OECD Guideline 
308. The environmental fate and transformation of (14C)-labelled brivaracetam was studied in two 
natural water-sediment systems maintained under aerobic conditions at 20 ± 2°C, in the dark, 
over a period of 100 days. The substance was applied at 10 μg/vessel (0.07 μg/L), a rate chosen to 
provide adequate analytical sensitivity. The characteristics of the two systems were as follows:  
The degradation rates of (14C)-brivaracetam from the total system (water and sediment) and the 
dissipation rates of (14C)-brivaracetam from the water and sediment phases were determined using 
single first-order (SFO) and best fit kinetics. A water sample and a sediment extract from each 
system were analysed by LC-MS to confirm the presence of brivaracetam, UCB1148379 and 4-
propylpyrrolidine-2-one.

For the present study, an extensive range of state of the art techniques was therefore employed 
during method development and in the main test to improve recovery. However, despite all 
reasonable efforts, it was not possible to improve the mass balance of some samples. This 
suggests that the losses were an inevitable result linked to the chemical characteristics of the 
parent compound and its degradation pathway. 
A significant amount of applied radioactivity (AR) remained unextracted in the sediment (up to 
61.5% of AR at 100 days, Swiss Lake system). Several additional extraction procedures were 
performed on the 100 day samples to analyze the type of bound residues. Only with bound residue 
fractionation it was possible to extract an unknown component with 4.9% (Calwich Abbey, CA) and 
45.5% (Swiss Lake, SL) of applied radioactivity in the Fulvic acid fraction. This fraction was 
analyzed by HPLC and LC-MS, comparing the results to the reference substance. The results of the 
study are summarized below: 
Distribution of AR: The biomass values were > 800 μg C/g sediment at the end of the incubation 
period, therefore the systems were considered viable throughout the incubation phase. The 
recovery and distribution of radioactivity in the systems are shown in Table 1. . For both systems, 
radioactivity decreased from the water layers from 97 to <80% within 7 days, with further 
decreases to 4.5 (CA) and 3.6% (SL) after 100 days. At the same time, the amount of radioactivity 
trapped as 14CO2 in the NaOH traps increases to 54 (CA) and 56% (SL) after 100 and 61 days. The 
recovery of radioactivity in the sodium hydroxide traps for Swiss Lake sediment at 100 DAT was 
lower than at 61 days. Although this is unusual, examination of the chromatography results 
confirm that this had no effect on the calculation of degradation and dissipation rates. 
Table 1.  Recovery and distribution of radioactivity in the test systems 
Radioactivity partially partitioned to the sediment up to 36.1% on 30 days (CA) and 64.7% on 100 
days (SL), with bound residues of 19.6 (CA) and 61.5% (SL) on 100 days. The amount of volatile 
substances trapped in activated charcoal was negligible. On 61 and 100 days for Calwich Abbey 
and 14 and 30 days for Swiss Lake, the mass balances were below 90%. 
Identification and quantification of brivaracetam and transformation products: Two metabolites 
with >10% of AR were detected by HPLC in surface water and sediment extract and were identified 
by LC-MS/MS in comparison to reference substances provided by the applicant. The metabolites 
were identified to be 4-propylpyrrolidin-2-one and UCB1148379, the butanoic acid degradant of 
brivaracetam. It was considered, based on chemical structures, that brivaracetam degrades to 4-
propylpyrrolidine-2-one via UCB1148379, although direct transformation is possible. All these may

be slowly incorporated into unextracted sediment residues and/or mineralised to carbon dioxide. 
With CO2 production of 54.3% AR (CA, DAT 100) and 55.7% AR (SL, DAT 61), mineralisation is the 
main transformation route. 
Sediment samples of the Calwich Abbey and Swiss Lake systems at 100 days were further 
analyzed by bound residue fractionation to identify main components of the bound residue if 
possible. An additional metabolite was recognized by HPLC with radioactive amounts of 4.9% (CA) 
and 45.5% (SL). The unknown component present in the Swiss Lake Fulvic acid extract was 
analysed by LC-MS/MS. The accurate mass measurement of the ion gave the empirical formula 
C9H14O5N ([M+H]+), with an error of 0.5 ppm. Based on the product ion spectrum for this 
component, it was postulated that this was the result of partial cleavage of the propyl side chain of 
UCB1148379 and subsequent formation of the carboxylic acid to give a dicarboxylic acid degradant. 
An authentic standard of this compound (UCB1147043) was provided by the Sponsor and analysed. 
The standard eluted at along with the minor peak in the radiochromatogram for the fulvic acid 
extract which also shows the same mass as the major peak. The product ion spectra of the 
authentic standard and component in the fulvic acid extract were consistent with major ions at m/z 
170, 152, 113, 96, 85, 70 and 56 Da. Subsequent analysis of UCB1147043, the fulvic acid extract 
and UCB1147043 spiked into the fulvic acid extract did not show a shift of the [M-H]-ion to match 
the retention time of the major peak on the radio trace. It is likely, therefore, that the major 
component is an isomer of UCB1147043. As the unknown was only observed in the fulvic acid 
fraction, created by destruction of the soil matrix, it cannot be considered to be bioavailable. 
The detailed recoveries of brivaracetam, UCB1148379 and 4-propylpyrrolidine-2-one in the various 
test systems are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The results show that brivaracetam gradually dissipated 
from the systems down to 0.6 (CA) and 2.0% (SL). It partially shifted into the sediment with a 
maximum of 6.4 (CA) and 9.2% (SL) on 7 days. UCB1148379 was formed with maxima of 21.6% 
(CA) on 14 days and 6.0% (SL) on 7 days. It dissipated from the system to 0.2% (CA) and was not 
detectable (SL) on 100 days. The amount of 4-propylpyrrolidine-2-one increased with maxima of 
55.7% (CA) at day 30 and 8.3% (SL) at 14 days and decreased to 7.5% in the CA system and was 
not detectable in the SL system at 100 days.

Calculation of half-lives: The percent of applied radioactivity present as brivaracetam, UCB1148379 
and 4-propylpyrrolidine-2-one were plotted against the time after treatment in days. Curves were 
constructed through appropriate data points using non-linear regression analysis to give lines of 
best fit. The degradation rates of the test substance, the parameters used to calculate them and 
parameter statistics were determined using CAKE version 2 software. In all cases, the values used 
for fitting were the experimentally derived, individual values from the two replicates per sampling 
interval. Degradation rates for brivaracetam, UCB1148379 and 4-propylpyrrolidine-2-one are 
shown in Tables 4 and 5. The half-life values of brivaracetam in water were 7.49 (CA) and 10.8 
days (SL) and in sediment 4.8 (CA) and 8.11 days (SL). For the total systems, the half-life values 
were calculated to be 8.06 (CA) and 12.7 days (SL). Taking into account the differences of water 
sediment systems, this correlates well with the results of the first water sediment study with 
DT50,system = 18.8/16.5 days. 
According to ECHA recommendations, a surface water temperature of 12°C is considered 
representative for European surface waters. The Applicant was therefore asked to correct the OECD 
TG308-derived DT50-values from 20°C to 12°C using the Arrhenius equation, and evaluate the 
substance persistence to degradation in the ERA based on those values. The corrected OECD 
TG308-derived DT50-values taking into account a surface water temperature of 12°C, using the 
Arrhenius equation, are given in Table 4. and Table 5.

2.3.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics or toxicology data have been submitted to 
support the extension of indication to include adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset 
seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients with epilepsy 4 years of age and older 
for Briviact. In the initial MAA (EMEA/H/C/003898, 2016), Briviact was approved in the same 
indication in patients from 16 years of age. 
The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of brivaracetam were investigated during the 
initial MAA of Briviact (EMEA/H/C/003898) and juvenile toxicity studies in rats and dogs were 
included. The absence of new data is therefore acceptable. 
In the previously conducted studies, juvenile rats and dogs were evaluated from postnatal day 4 to 
70 and 4 to 276, respectively, corresponding to neonatal to early (0 to 12 years) and adolescent 
(12 to 18 years) stages of development in humans.  
The data from the non-clinical juvenile toxicity studies have not identified any new or unique risks 
with regard to the safety of brivaracetam in a juvenile population. 
The findings are adequately reflected in the SmPC, and no further updates are considered 
necessary.  
Environmental risk assessment 
An updated ERA has also been submitted that includes a new water sediment degradation study as 
requested by the CHMP and accounts for the extension of indication to include paediatric 
populations. 
Based on the assumptions and estimations presented, the Applicant´s conclusion that the 
additional indication is not expected to impact the default FPEN value of 0.01 previously used for 
the PECSurface Water calculation is agreed. FPEN can therefore be kept at 0.01, and consequently 
the existing PECSurface Water 1 µg/L remains valid. A Phase II of the ERA with environmental fate 
and effects analysis was performed in the initial MAA of Briviact. As outlined in the EPAR, Tier A 
analysis showed that brivaracetam was not readily biodegradable. It is not expected to 
bioaccumulate in aquatic systems. Brivaracetam is degraded in water-sediment system to one 
extractable metabolite and several polar metabolites. Predicted no effect concentrations (PNEC) 
were calculated including ground and surface water, microorganisms and sediment. The resulting 
PEC:PNEC ratios indicated that brivaracetam was unlikely to be a concern for the aquatic 
environment or for the sediment compartment. The PEC:PNEC ratio for microorganisms indicates 
that brivaracetam is unlikely to be a concern in sewage treatment works. 
In the repeated OECD 308 study, the mean recovery of applied radioactivity was between 83 and 
99% for all replicates. The first OECD 308 study also showed several results with low mass 
balances below the validity criterion of 90% AR. As an extensive range of techniques were 
employed to improve or prevent suboptimal recovery of radioactivity, this suggests that the losses 
were an inevitable result of the nature of the compound.  
Low recoveries for the Swiss Lake system at 14 and 30 days were considered to be due a transient 
volatile compound lost during extraction procedures. Low recoveries for the Calwich Abbey system 
at the end of the test could have been due to loss of the same volatile component. 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 19/112 
 
  
  
Brivaracetam degraded rapidly in the two water-sediment systems used with DT50 values of 8 and 
13 days by biphasic kinetics (HS) at 20 ± 2°C. Brivaracetam also disappeared rapidly from the 
water phase and the DT50 values were 7 and 11 days, by HS kinetics. 
Degradation occurred to UCB1148379 (maximum of 22% AR), 4-propylpyrrolidine-2-one 
(maximum of 56% AR), unextracted sediment residues (maximum 62% AR) and CO2 (maximum 
56% AR), depending on the sediment system. 
[14C]-Brivaracetam and its major transformation products are unlikely to persist or accumulate in 
natural water-sediment systems as they either degraded rapidly in or were lost from the test 
systems during the course of the study.  
At the CHMP request, the applicant was asked to correct the OECD 308-derived DT50 values from 
20°C to 12°C in agreement with ECHA recommendations and to evaluate the substance persistence 
to degradation in the ERA based on those values.  
The requested corrections were provided. The data show that a transformation product of 
brivaracetam, 4-propylpyrrolidine-2-one, is persistent in one out of two water/sediment systems 
tested (i.e. Calwich Abbey system) and at the CHMP’s request this was appropriately reflected in 
the updated ERA. 
The CHMP agrees that based on the presented data the extension of indication does not 
significantly affect the environmental exposure to brivaracetam. 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted to support the extension of indication to add a new 
indication as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary 
generalisation in adult and adolescent (16-18 years) patients with epilepsy. The non-clinical data 
submitted and assessed in the original MAA (EMEA/H/C/000863) are considered adequate to 
support also the new indication. No updates in SmPC section 5.3 are needed. 
Environmental risk assessment 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead 
to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of brivaracetam.  
- Considering the above data, brivaracetam is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.  
A transformation product of brivaracetam, 4-propylpyrrolidine-2-one, is persistent in one out of two 
water/sediment systems tested (i.e. Calwich Abbey system). The applicant updated the ERA to 
include this information.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
The BRV paediatric development program supporting the application for an indication in children 
≥4 years to <16 years of age, consists of 1 completed study (N01263) and 1 ongoing long-term 
safety study (N01266) (Pool Paediatric Studies), is summarized in Table 6. .  
Table 6.  Table 6. Phase 2/3 studies of BRV in paediatric subjects with epilepsy 
No Phase III BRV controlled studies have been conducted in paediatric subjects with POS given that 
efficacy, as adjunctive treatment can be extrapolated from adult subjects with POS.  
The following clinical pharmacology studies are included in this application in support of 
extrapolation: 
•  CL0187: A population PK study in paediatric subjects with POS 
•  CL0258: An exposure-response modeling study of BRV as adjunctive therapy in paediatric 
subjects with POS 
The following modeling study was performed to support proposed BRV doses when used as iv 
injection/infusion: 
•  N01331: Population PK study to predict iv PK of BRV in the paediatric population (0 to <17 
years of age) 
Further support of the proposed paediatric indication is provided by updated safety data from 3 
adult safety pools included in the original application Pool S4, Pool Monotherapy, and Pool 
Unverricht-Lundborg disease (ULD). No new subjects were added to these pools since the original 
application was reviewed; however, the clinical cutoff date for the current application provides data 
for approximately 2 years of additional exposure to BRV. 
Phase 2/3 studies of adjunctive BRV (and LTFU) in subjects ≥16 years of age with epilepsy 
• 
LTFU studies of adjunctive BRV in subjects ≥16 years of age with epilepsy 
The studies of adjunctive BRV in subjects ≥16 years of age with epilepsy included subjects from 
core studies N01114, N01193, N01252, N01253, N01254, N01358, and N01395; and LTFU studies 
N01125, N01199, N01372, and N01379. Of the 4 adult LTFU studies included in the original 
application, 3 remain ongoing (N01125, N01199, and N01379) and 1 (N01372) has been 
completed. Updated safety data (data cutoff date: 31 Aug 2016) from these 4 studies are included

in Pool S4. 
•  Studies of conversion to monotherapy in subjects ≥16 years of age with epilepsy 
Two conversion to monotherapy studies (N01276 and N01306) in 150 subjects ≥16 years of age 
had been completed. One LTFU study (N01315) that enrolled 108 subjects was ongoing at the time 
of the original application. After the original application, 6 subjects originally enrolled in N01315 
were transferred to LTFU study N01125 due to site closure. N01315 and N01125 both remain 
ongoing with no additional subjects enrolled since the original application. 
•  Studies in other indications: ULD 
Studies in subjects with ULD included subjects from core studies N01187 and N01236, and LTFU 
study N01125. Updated safety data from the 94 subjects with ULD enrolled in the LTFU study 
N01125 were included in Pool ULD.  
Lastly, postmarketing data from both adult and paediatric patients (data cutoff date: 14 Oct 2016), 
and literature as well as reference to previously submitted adult data are included in the 
application. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics in paediatric population 
The PK of BRV has been investigated in paediatric subjects with epilepsy in one study (N01263). 
Brivaracetam plasma concentration data from this study were included in a population PK analysis 
(CL0187) to simulate BRV exposure after oral BRV using a weight-based dosing scheme. A 
summary of the PK and PK/PD modelling and simulation studies to support an indication for BRV as 
adjunctive therapy in the treatment of POS in paediatric patients ≥4 years of age with epilepsy is 
presented in Table 7.  below.  
Table 7.  Summary of BRV PK and PK/PD modelling and simulation studies supporting paediatric 
adjunctive therapy 
The BRV dosing recommendations in adults and children, according to the Applicant, are 
summarised in Table 8.  below.

Table 8.  Summary of adult and paediatric BRV dosing adaptations 
Population PK modelling 
Trial N01263 was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter, fixed 3-step up-titration study evaluating 
the PK, safety, and efficacy of BRV in children aged ≥ 1 month to <16 years. Brivaracetam oral 
solution was administered at weekly increasing doses of approximately 0.4mg/kg bid, 0.8mg/kg 
bid, and 1.6mg/kg bid for subjects ≥ 8 years of age and 0.5mg/kg bid, 1.0mg/kg bid, and 
2.0mg/kg bid for subjects <8 years of age. The doses were to be capped at the adult doses of 
25mg bid, 50mg bid and 100mg bid, respectively, for body weight (WT) ≥ 50kg.  
A population PK model was developed for BRV in sparsely sampled paediatric patients (two to three 
samples per visit, with one visit for each of three dosing levels) using non-linear mixed-effects 
modelling. 600 BRV plasma concentration-time records were available in 96 paediatric patients 
with a balanced distribution of patient numbers aged 1 month to <2 years, 2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 
years and 12 to <16 years age groups of 29, 26, 24 and 17 patients respectively.  
Estimated body surface area-normalized glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated for 
paediatric patients using the Schwartz bedside equation: 
eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = (36.2 × Height in cm) / Creatinine in μmol/L 
Lean body weight (LBW) was calculated according to James formula: 
LBW [kg] in males = 1.10 × weight[kg] – 0.0128 × BMI[kg/m2] × weight[kg] 
LBW [kg] in females = 1.07 × weight[kg] – 0.0148 × BMI[kg/m2] × weight[kg] 
Post-conceptional age (PCA) was only considered relevant for patients below 3 years; for all other 
patients, and for patients where PCA was missing, PCA was calculated as age (years) + 0.75. 
A summary of the categorical and continuous covariates in the paediatric dataset available for 
testing in the analysis is provided in Table 9. , Table 10.  and Table 11. , respectively.

The final paediatric population PK model consisted of first order absorption, single compartment 
distribution and first order elimination components with allometric scaling of clearance and volume 
parameters using fixed theoretical allometric exponents. Residual error was modelled using a 
proportional error term. A step-wise covariate modelling procedure was used to determine factors 
influencing BRV clearance. The final model parameters are summarised in Table 12.  including the 
adult PK parameter estimates, for comparison. In the paediatric model inter-individual variability 
were estimated on clearance (22.8 %CV), volume of distribution (16.7 %CV) and absorption (31.9 
%CV), with shrinkage 6.1%, 45.6% and 73.4%, respectively. Model evaluations, presented as 
visual predictive checks are presented in Figure 1. , Figure 2.  and Figure 3. .

Figure 3.  VPCs for BRV time profiles (run411) by PB, CBZ and VPA co-administration for Day 21.

Covariate analysis indicated that co-administration of phenobarbital or primidone (PB), 
carbamazepine (CBZ), or valproate (VPA) was associated with a clearance modification: PB was 
estimated to induce a 40.8% increase in clearance (95%CI: 19.9%/ 65.2%), CBZ a 47.9% 
increase (27.8%/ 71.2%) and VPA a 10.1% (0.8%/18.5%) decrease. No effects on clearance could 
be attributed to race, ethnicity, sex, co-administration of CYP3A or CYP2C19 inhibitors, age, 
postconceptional age (PCA) or body surface area-normalized glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Age-
related maturation of metabolism could not be detected. According to the Applicant, the increased 
clearance in young children could be associated with the more frequent coadministration of PB as 
compared to older children. 
The available data in young children were limited in absolute numbers but nevertheless 
represented about a third of the total (n=96) as there were 37 children aged <4 years (including 
29 aged <2 years): The presence of a relevant age effect on clearance could have been detected. 
The absence of any detectable maturation effect is consistent with the known disposition pathways 
of BRV: As BRV is extensively biotransformed with <10% excreted unchanged by the kidneys, 
renal maturation in younger children cannot influence its clearance significantly.

In order to assess further the presence or absence of clearance maturation effects, a maturation 
function has been incorporated in the expression of BRV clearance using either fixed or estimated 
parameters, as requested by the CHMP. The results are summarized in Table 13. . 
Table 13.  record for inclusion of maturation factor on BRV clearance 
Estimating the values of MATCL50 and HillCL (run413) led to numerical issues (model termination 
with rounding errors) and MATCL50 and HillCL values of 0.63 months and 6.96, respectively. Fixing 
the Hill coefficient to a value of 3.5 and MATCL50 to 47 months (run414) as observed for 
glomerular filtration rate and paracetamol clearance (Holford TN et al., 2009) led to successful 
minimization, and an increase in delta objective function value of 307 points, compared to the 
model without maturation (-730.104 vs. -1031.866), demonstrating a highly significant 
deterioration of goodness of fit. Fixing the Hill coefficient to a value of 3.5 (run415) as observed for 
glomerular filtration rate, paracetamol clearance and morphine clearance (Holford N et al., 2009) 
led to successful minimization, an objective function value identical to the model without 
maturation (-1031.866), and an estimate of MATCL50 of 0.47 months. Fixing the Hill coefficient to 
a value of 6.2 (run416) as observed for acyclovir clearance (Holford TN et al., 2009; Tod M et al., 
2001) led to successful minimization, an objective function value identical to the model without 
maturation (- 1031.866), and an estimate of MATCL50 of 0.489 months. Based on the available 
results the applicant considered that the data provide no support for a maturation function with 
PMA to describe BRV clearance. 
Absorption 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate the absorption of BRV in paediatric subjects. 
In adults, BRV is completely and rapidly absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract after oral 
administration. There is no pre-systemic metabolism or active (efflux) transport. The high oral 
bioavailability of approximately 100% is not affected by food. As BRV is a Biopharmaceutics 
Classification System class-I drug, it is expected that the BRV absorption profile in paediatric 
patients after administration of a tablet or oral solution is similar to that in adults. 
Distribution 
Brivaracetam is weakly bound to plasma proteins in adults (≤ 20%); no change in the low plasma 
protein binding is expected to occur in paediatric patients. The volume of distribution of BRV is 
0.5L/kg in adults, a value close to that of the total body water. Based on the paediatric population 
PK model, the typical distribution volume of BRV in the paediatric population was estimated to be 
47.8L for a lean body weight of 50kg (95% CI: 43.1, 52.5) or 55.7L for a total body weight of 70kg 
(95% CI: 51.0, 60.5), ie, 0.8L/kg. The mean volume of distribution was slightly higher than that 
reported in adult patients with epilepsy (Vz/F=48.1L; 95% CI: 45.8, 50.4).

Metabolism 
Expression of the amidase enzyme, which represents the main disposition pathway of BRV, is not 
known to be age dependent and it is assumed to be widely expressed at birth. The secondary 
hydroxylation pathway on the other hand, is supported by cytochrome-P (CYP)2C19 which has 
been reported to have a fractional expression of 0.23 at birth relative to adults, a time to half adult 
expression of 0.99 year, and a fractional expression of 0.92 or 92% of adults at the age of 4 years 
(Johnson et al, 2006). Therefore, the ontogeny of this secondary disposition pathway could have 
an effect of BRV metabolism and contribute to a lower clearance (CL) in young children; however, 
such an effect was not evidenced in the small dataset of paediatric subjects. Irrespective of the 
minor contribution of the hydroxylation pathway to the disposition of BRV, over 90% of the 
CYP2C19 adult expression is reached by the age of 4 years; therefore, no age dependency is 
expected in paediatric patients ≥ 4 years of age. 
Excretion 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate the excretion of BRV in paediatric subjects. In 
adults, BRV is primarily eliminated from the systemic circulation by renal excretion following 
extensive biotransformation. The terminal half-life (t ½) of BRV in adults is approximately 9 hours. 
As BRV is extensively biotransformed with <10% excreted unchanged by the kidneys, renal 
maturation in younger children is not expected to influence its clearance significantly.  
The mean (standard deviation [SD]) plasma half-life of BRV in children, estimated by simulation in 
CL0187, ranged from 6.9 hours (2.3 hours) in the group from 4 to <5 years of age to 9.0 hours 
(3.1 hours) in the group from 15 to <16 years of age. Overall, plasma half-life in paediatric 
populations was in the same range as adult subjects with epilepsy. 
Special populations 
Age and gender 
The population PK analysis did not detect a significant effect of gender or age on BRV CL in 
paediatric subjects. Clinical studies in adult subjects with epilepsy showed that gender does not 
have a clinically significant influence on the plasma concentrations of BRV.  
Race 
The population PK analysis did not detect a significant effect of race on BRV CL in paediatric 
subjects. Based on these data, it is expected that BRV PK profile in paediatric subjects would be 
consistent with the known PK profile of BRV derived from adult studies where there were no 
clinically relevant differences in the PK of BRV among Asian, Black, and Caucasian subjects.  
Body weight 
The results from the population PK analysis show that BRV steady-state plasma concentrations 
resulting from the proposed BRV weight-based dosing scheme for paediatric subjects (2mg/kg/day 
for subjects with body weights <50kg) approximate those observed in adults with POS taking the 
therapeutic dose BRV 100mg/day as adjunctive therapy. 
Genetic polymorphism 
The effect of genetic polymorphisms was not evaluated in the paediatric studies. 
Results from a PK study in healthy Japanese adults demonstrated that BRV AUCt underwent small 
increases as shown by values of 16.6, 20.0, and 23.1μg.h/mL (normalized to a dose of 1mg/kg) in 
homozygous extensive metabolizer (EM), heterozygous EM, and poor metabolizer (PM) subjects, 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 30/112 
 
  
  
respectively; whereas, the hydroxy metabolite decreased to less than 1/10th, from 2.55 
(homozygous EM subjects) to 0.968 (heterozygous EM subjects) to 0.191 (PM subjects) μg.h/mL 
(normalized to a dose of 1mg/kg). The carboxylic acid metabolite and hydroxyacid metabolite AUCs 
were not consistently modified among the 3 genotypes. These observations indicate that CYP2C19 
is the isoenzyme responsible for the hydroxylation of BRV into hydroxyl metabolite, and that this 
pathway is secondary compared to hydrolysis. As such, the potential for CYP2C19-mediated 
interactions with BRV is expected to be low. Thus, no dose adjustment is expected to be needed in 
paediatric patients with CYP2C19 polymorphisms or paediatric patients who received CYP2C19-
inhibiting drugs concomitantly with BRV. 
Renal impairment 
The effect of renal impairment was not evaluated in the paediatric studies.  
Based on renal impairment from adults, no dose adjustment is recommended for paediatric 
patients with renal impairment. Brivaracetam is not recommended in paediatric patients with end 
stage renal disease undergoing dialysis due to lack of data. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment was not evaluated in the paediatric studies.  
Based on hepatic impairment data from adults, a starting dose of BRV 1mg/kg/day (for body 
weights <50kg) or 50mg/day (for body weights ≥ 50kg) is recommended for paediatric patients at 
any stage of hepatic impairment. Based on the maximum dose recommended for adults, similar 
BRV maximums (3mg/kg/day for patients with body weights <50kg and 150mg/day for patients 
with body weights ≥ 50kg) are recommended for paediatric patients with hepatic impairment. 
Drug – drug interactions 
Potential interactions between BRV (50mg/day to 200mg/day) and other AEDs were investigated in 
a pooled analysis of plasma drug concentrations from all adult Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies and in 
a population exposure-response analysis of PBO-controlled Phase 3 studies in adjunctive therapy in 
the treatment of POS. 
In adults, co-administration of rifampicin with BRV resulted in a 45% decrease in BRV plasma 
concentration. Prescribers should consider increasing the BRV dose in patients starting treatment 
with rifampicin and decreasing when stopping rifampicin therapy. 
As in adults, for paediatric subjects prescribers should consider increasing the BRV dose in patients 
starting treatment with rifampicin and decreasing when stopping rifampicin therapy. For paediatric 
subjects, co-administration of PB and of CBZ increased BRV clearance, and co-administration of 
valproic acid decreased BRV clearance.  
2.4.3.  Simulations to establish dosing recommendations for oral 
administration 
Paediatric simulations using the population estimates from the final paediatric model were 
performed with the study administration schedule (2.0 mg/kg bid for patients <8 years and 1.6 
mg/kg bid with a maximum of 100 mg bid for patients ≥ 8 years). Additional schedules of 2.0 and 
2.5 mg/kg bid were investigated with a maximum of 100 mg bid, independent of age. The 
population estimates from the adult patient population PK model were used to derive the median 
and 90% of the predicted steady state concentration (Css) levels for adults receiving 100 mg BRV 
bid. In these predictions, effects of inducer coadministration (carbamazepine, 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 31/112 
 
  
  
phenobarbital/primidone, and phenytoin) were excluded from both adult and paediatric populations 
to allow an unbiased comparison. 
The Nhanes DXA database [Nhanes 2013] was used to provide demographic variables (age, 
weight, and calculated lean body weight using the James formula) to drive the simulations. 
Valproate coadministration for children was sampled from the paediatric dataset because the 
paediatric PK model contained a valproate effect. In the graphs, the gray shaded area depicts 90% 
of the adult Css values receiving 100 mg bid, the blue shaded area and line depict the median and 
90% of the paediatric Css values for the different simulations, and the red circles indicate the 
predicted Css values for the individual clearance values in study N01263 using the final model, 
where only paediatric patients not taking inducer AEDs are selected. The trial dosing scheme 
(Figure 4. ) put most of the model-predicted concentrations (blue area) in the adult range (gray 
area) and individual predictions for paediatric patients (red circles) were mostly contained within 
the model-predicted range.

the final paediatric population PK model (red circles: individual predictions for patients without 
inducer AED coadministration) and predicted ranges for children from the Nhanes database 
<16 years and ≤100 kg using 2 mg/kg bid for patients <8 years, and 1.6 mg/kg bid for 
patients ≥8 years with 100 mg bid maximum dose. The blue shaded area encompasses 90% 
of the simulated paediatric patients, the blue line is the median simulated paediatric Css. The 
horizontal gray bar is the predicted 90% CI Css of the adults receiving 100 mg bid, and not 
coadministered with inducer AEDs. 
By removing the age classification in the dosing recommendation and simply dosing all patients 
with 2.0 mg/kg bid with a maximum of 100 mg bid, the predicted concentration profile across the 
paediatric population was comparable to the age-based trial dosing regimen (Figure 5. , top panels, 
compared to Figure 4. ). Increasing the dose to 2.5 mg/kg bid across the entire population may 
bring the smaller/younger children closer to the desired concentration range, but increases the 
likelihood of over-dosing in older children (Figure 5. , lower panels)

inducer AED coadministration) and predicted ranges for children from the Nhanes database 
<16 years and ≤100 kg using 2 mg/kg bid with 100 mg bid maximum dose for all patients 
(top) or 2.5 mg/kg bid with 100 mg bid maximum dose for all patients (bottom). The blue 
shaded area encompasses 90% of the simulated paediatric patients, the blue line is the 
median simulated paediatric Css. The horizontal gray bar is the predicted 90% CI Css of the 
adults receiving 100 mg bid, and not coadministered with inducer AEDs. 
Paediatric and adult PK models were estimated separately, and adult models were scaled by weight 
while paediatric models were scaled by lean body weight. In addition, allometric scaling factors 
were estimated freely for the adult PK model, while the factors were fixed to the theoretical values 
of ¾ and 1 for scaling clearance and volume respectively in the paediatric model. The graphs with 
age independent dosing seem to suggest a deviation between adult predictions and paediatric 
predictions for the ranges of weights where these predictions should correspond (≥ 50kg for 2 
mg/kg bid and ≥ 40kg for 2.5 mg/kg bid), for children receiving a dose of 100 mg (see Figure 5. ). 
However, the adult reference range was calculated across the entire adult population and was not 
represented as a function of weight. A new graph was generated with predicted adult Css values 
but this time as a function of weight (Figure 6. ). This graph shows that the apparent discrepancy 
disappears when weight is taken into account and also demonstrates that for this weight range, the 
models, even though parameterized and scaled differently, provide similar predictions.

encompasses 90% of the simulated paediatric patients, the blue line is the median simulated 
paediatric Css. The underlying gray area is the predicted 90% CI Css of the adults receiving 
100 mg bid, summarized by WT, and not coadministered with inducer AEDs. 
At the CHMP’s request additional analyses were conducted to further elucidate the predicted BRV 
concentrations in children compared to adult reference ranges with background antiepileptic drugs 
(AEDs) corresponding to the pediatric population. 
An additional adult population PK model was executed including the effect of valproate (VPA) co-
administration, as the original adult reference model only contained effects of carbamazepine 
(CBZ), phenytoin (PHT) and phenobarbital (PB) while VPA was not significant. 0 below provides the 
predictions for BRV Css in children as a function of age, with the horizontal scale being restricted to 
patients aged ≥ 4 years, but using the originally submitted final pediaric population PK model 
including all children from 1 month to <16 years (run411). Of note, only 4 individuals are visible in 
the PB group (red circles) as the large majority of patients co-medicated with PB were aged <4 
years. The updated graph now contains adult reference ranges for adults taking the same class of 
co-medication as the pediatric patients and shows a near perfect match between children and 
adults except for the upper limit of the VPA confidence interval (but not for individual patients):

median simulated paediatric Css. The horizontal grey bar is the predicted 90% CI Css of the 
adults receiving 100 mg bid with the same AED background therapy as the pediatric groups. 
These graphs indicate that predicted Css for pediatric patients correspond well with AEDspecific 
adult reference sub-ranges, with the possible exception of VPA regarding the upper 95th percentile 
of the prediction interval which slightly exceeds the adult reference in the weight region of 40 to 60 
kg. The adult population PK model estimated a slight increase in BRV clearance associated with 
VPA co-administration (typical value: +11.1%; 95%CI: +6.8%, +15.7%) which was not retained 
in the original final model, while the paediatric population PK model estimated a decrease in BRV 
clearance with VPA co-administration (typical value: -10.1%; 95%CI: -18.5%, -0.81%). 
There is no strong rationale for suspecting a potential PK interaction of VPA on BRV. The modest 
and opposite changes estimated on BRV clearance in adults and children may be considered as 
chance effects, and their clinical relevance is insignificant.  
The MAH concludes that the widths of the 90%CI of the paediatric predictions reflect at least in 
part the limited data available and the imprecision of the model while individual observations (red

circles in Fig. 17-2 and Fig 17-3) are contained within the respective adult reference sub-ranges. 
Overall, paediatric dosing adaptations provide a good match to adults with the same AED co-
medication patterns. 
2.4.4.  Simulations to establish dosing recommendations for iv 
administration 
Data from an iv study in healthy volunteers (N01256) and a paediatric population PK model 
following oral administration (CL0187 derived from paediatric study N01263) were used to perform 
simulations to support the iv dosing recommendation in children. N01256 included 48 male and 
female healthy volunteers. In the part I of the study subjects received either a single oral or iv 
bolus or iv infusion of 10 mg BRV. In part II of the study the subjects were dosed with a single iv 
bolus or iv infusion of 10, 25, 50, 100, 150 mg BRV. Rich PK data was collected in the study.  
A 1-compartment model with linear elimination adequately described the healthy volunteer iv data. 
The model included estimates of CL and V and inter-individual variability on CL and V. The residual 
error was described by a proportional model. The population estimates of CL and V were 2.96L/h 
(26.8%) and 36.2L (22.4%), respectively.  
A paediatric iv model was derived by combining the adult iv model and model parameters from 
CL0187, a paediatric population PK model following oral administration (see section “Population PK 
modelling” above). The paediatric intravenous PK model was a one compartment model with linear 
elimination. The volume of distribution was 36.2 L. The CL was 3.61 L/h. Lean body weight was 
assumed to be a covariate on CL and V. Allometric scaling with fixed exponents of 1 and 0.75 were 
used as covariates on V and CL respectively. The effect of concomitant AEDs on CL was taken from 
paediatric oral population PK analysis. 
Simulations were performed to calculate the predicted steady state concentration (Css) of BRV at 
different dosage regimens. Two different age groups were simulated. The first age group consisted 
on subjects in the age range of 1 month to <17 years. The second age group included neonates 
(age between 0 to <28 days). Weight instead of lean body weight was used as a covariate when 
simulating steady state concentrations in neonates. The simulated Css were compared with the 
predicted Css in adults at 100 mg bid dosage regimen. The results of simulations in the age group 
of 1 month to <17 years are presented in Figure 10. Simulations suggested that in the age group 
of 1 month to <17 years a dosage regime of 2.0 mg/kg BID with a maximum of 100 mg BID would 
result in profiles comparable to simulated average steady state concentrations in the range of adult 
100 mg BID which is the expected maximum therapeutic dose in adults.

Figure 10.  Predicted steady state concentrations (Css) in the age group of 1 month to <17 years

The iv PK model for neonates was a one compartment model with linear elimination. The V was 
36.2 L. The CL was 3.81 L/h. Weight instead of lean body weight was assumed to be a covariate on 
CL. Allometric scaling with fixed exponents of 1 and 0.75 were used as covariates on V and CL 
respectively. The effect of concomitant inducers on CL, taken from paediatric oral population PK 
analysis, was assumed to be 0.46. Figure 11.  below shows the simulation results in the age group 
of 0 to <28 days. As presented in the figure below the simulations indicate that the Css at 2 and 
2.5 mg/kg concentrations in neonates may be lower when compared to the predicted steady state 
concentrations in adults at 100 mg bid.

2.4.5.  Pharmacodynamics 
No specific studies have been performed to evaluate BRV PD effects in paediatric subjects which 
was found acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.6.  PK/PD modelling 
An exposure-response modelling study of BRV as adjunctive therapy in children ≥ 4 to <16 years of 
age with POS, was conducted to support the proposed dosing scheme as well as dosing in future 
paediatric studies. The modelling was based on Phase 3 PK/PD data from adults and children who 
received Levetiracetam, and on Phase 2 and 3 PK/PD data from adults who received BRV, as well 
as PK data from children in N01263. 
A population PK/PD model was previously developed to describe the relationship between 
concentrations of BRV and daily seizure frequency in adult subjects. In order to support the 
extrapolation of PD in BRV to subjects 4 to 16 years of age, , a LEV adult/paediatric PK/PD model 
was built and subsequently used to scale the existing BRV adult PK/PD model to children. The 
developed LEV combined adult/paediatric PK model consisted of a first order absorption, single 
compartment distribution, and first order elimination population PK model. LEV CL and V were 
scaled as a function of body weight using allometric scaling, and the influence of coadministration 
with the hepatic enzyme-inducing AEDs CBZ, PHT, and PB was investigated for its effect on LEV CL. 
The developed LEV combined adult/paediatric PK/PD model described seizure frequencies using a 
negative binomial distribution taking previous day seizure frequencies into account, and using a 
mixture model to separate a placebo (PBO)–like (ie, non-responder) and a responder 
subpopulation. The model was adapted to describe aggregated monthly seizure counts for the adult 
subjects in the LEV studies: daily seizure counts were only available for the children in the LEV 
studies. The LEV adult/paediatric PK/PD model was then used to support the scaling of the existing 
adult BRV PK/PD model into children. Pharmacokinetic and PD simulations for BRV were performed 
in children for a range of mg/kg doses to predict BRV effect in paediatric subjects. 
The simulations conducted in CL0258 allowed characterization of the paediatric BRV dose response 
curve and suggest that BRV 1mg/kg/day is an effective dose, see Figure 12. Furthermore, the 
maximum response is obtained at approximately BRV 4mg/kg/day dosing (for body weights 
<50kg, and with a maximum of 200mg/day for body weights ≥ 50kg) in paediatric patients ≥ 4 
years of age. This range (1 to 4mg/kg/day) provides dosing consistent with adult dose range of 50 
to 200mg/day.

2.4.7.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The scope of the present application is to support the expansion of the current approved indication 
to include the use of BRV as adjunctive therapy in patients ≥4 years of age with POS for tablet, 
oral solution, and solution for iv use dosage forms. The BRV dosing recommendations in adults and 
in children, as proposed by the Applicant, are provided in the following table: 
The Applicant stated that children weighing <50kg who receive BRV 1 to 4 mg/kg/day achieve BRV 
steady state plasma concentrations in the range of adults (≥ 16 years of age) receiving BRV 50 to 
200mg/day. Children weighing ≥ 50kg are dosed like adults.  
Samples for all paediatric PK analyses of BRV included in this application were collected in study 
N01263, the initial study of BRV in children. The primary objectives of the completed paediatric 
BRV study N01263 were to characterize the steady-state PK of BRV and its metabolites in subjects 
from ≥ 1 month to <16 years of age, evaluate their relationship with physiological developmental 
variables, and develop dosing adaptations. Trough BRV plasma concentration increased 
proportionally with dose. Trough BRV plasma concentration increased with increasing age; for 
example, at the high dose, geometric mean trough BRV plasma concentration was 0.596, 0.827, 
and 1.065μg/mL in ≥ 1 month to <2 years, ≥ 2 to <12 years and ≥ 12 to <16 years groups, 
respectively.

As acknowledged by the MAH, meaningful comparisons across age groups should be interpreted 
with caution and considered as preliminary, due to the limited sample size, particularly in the ≥ 12 
to <16 years group. Baseline characteristics have been presented for the range ≥ 2 to <12 years, 
although the sought indication is for children from 4 years old onward, the presented data is 
considered applicable for the age range ≥4 to <12 years.  
A population PK model including fixed allometric scaling adequately describes the BRV PK data in 
children of 4 to 17 years of age. Lean body weight was used as the covariate for body size due to a 
slightly better model fit; this is considered acceptable due to the strong correlation to body weight. 
Further, it is not perceived that lean body weight is more predictive in a clinical setting and the 
dosing recommendation on body weight is endorsed.  
In the model development PK data from children down to 1 month of age were included although 
organ maturation could be expected to influence the PK in young children. However, age related 
metabolism was investigated in the model development and was found not to further improve the 
description of BRV PK in small children and hence not included in the model which is acceptable. 
No effects of categorical covariates race, ethnicity, sex, CYP3A or CYP2C19 inhibitors were detected 
and no effects of age, post-conceptional age (PCA), or eGFR were detected for either a linear, an 
exponential, or a power relationship. Instead PB, CBZ and VPA were highly significant covariates 
and the aggregate effect of IND obscured the individual contributions. All three AEDs had 
significant effects on CL on their own, and in the combined estimation (run411) co-administration 
of PB was estimated to induce a 40.8% increase in CL (95%CI: 19.9%/ 65.2%), CBZ a 47.9% 
increase (27.8%/ 71.2%), and VPA a 10.1% (0.8%/18.5%) decrease. The comparison of the 
population PK estimates in adult vs paediatric subjects pointed out that the effect on CL of 
concomitant drugs is higher for children. However, the effect of enzyme-inducing AEDs is expected 
to be similar in children and adults and proposing the same dose adjustments in adults and 
children (≥ 4 years of age) is considered appropriate.  
Apart from the effect of AEDs, the PK parameter estimates from the paediatric population are 
similar to those estimated in adult patients. The allometric exponents were freely estimated in 
adults, however concentrations simulated from both models versus body weight largely overlap 
indicating that the slight differences in parameter estimates between adult and paediatric models 
are negligible. 
Visual predictive check plots were then presented by age category visit, however the age category 
2 years -<6 years includes also an age range out of the scope of the present variation. However, 
visual predictive checks for BRV time profile relative to 4y - <6y category still showed an 
acceptable correspondence between observed and simulated data which support the adequacy of 
the population PK model. 
Exposure ranges based on predicted steady state concentrations from individual clearance values 
are considered acceptable due an adequate population PK model and low parameter shrinkage in 
individual clearance estimates.  
The exposure simulations given the dosing regimen with an age cut-off of 8 years indicate a 
paediatric exposure range that is overall more similar to the adult reference range. However, at the 
break point for dose adjustment (8 years) there is an instant reduction exposure that could 
potentially lead to an undesirable loss of effect. Hence, the proposed dosing recommendation of 2 
mg/kg bid with maximum 100 mg bid is endorsed although the exposure range in children 
somewhat exceeds the adult range between 30-70 kg.  
According to the MAH, after subdividing the simulations by AED co-administration, it became 
apparent that the deviations in the young age group were mainly attributable to the more frequent 
co-administration of PB in the younger age category, however also CBZ administration contributed 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 42/112 
 
  
  
to this deviation. This observation does support the above mentioned issue regarding possible 
different dose adjustments required paediatric population. 
Paediatric dosing by kg does not result in under-exposure in any condition, nor in over-exposure 
except for the upper tail of the VPA confidence interval in the region of 40 to 60kg. When using the 
upper limit of adult reference range without concomitant PB/CBZ/VPA treatment, the risk of over 
exposure in the paediatric population co-treated with VPA decreases. As there is no known 
mechanistic rationale supporting the effect of VPA on BRV clearance and its apparently opposite 
directions in adults and children, both being of small magnitude, it is agreed that the predicted 
difference in exposure is considered non-clinically relevant. 
The approach of extrapolation of adult iv exposure to paediatric iv exposure is accepted. Standard 
methods were used in the development of the adult healthy volunteer iv population PK model. The 
goodness of fit diagnostic indicates that the model fit the data reasonably well. The WRES vs time 
after dose indicate a deviation at late time points, however the model is considered acceptable due 
to adequate individual model fits and that only the volume of distribution is used from the model 
which is mainly informed by early time points. 
The CHMP noted that the comparison between adult and paediatric (i.v.) exposure ranges rely on 
an adult reference range which is based on data obtained in healthy volunteers without co-
medication of other AEDs. However, considering that the relevant adult reference range for oral 
administration including co-medication of different AEDs is provided in the application and the iv 
exposure in children is very similar to the oral exposure considers that the absence of adult 
exposure ranges for i.v. administration in patients receiving other AEDs is acceptable and the 
presence of such data would not be expected to indicate a need of change in i.v. posology.  
The predicted steady state concentrations in neonates indicate that the maximum dose of 4 
mg/kg/day is on the low side without inducer AEDs and too low with inducer AEDs, compared to 
the adult reference range. It is acknowledged that there is much uncertainty in these predictions, 
in terms of BRV PK, the PK of AEDs and the magnitude of interaction in neonates. However, these 
findings suggest that further considerations regarding dose selection in neonates are warranted in 
order to inform the recommended posology in this age group.  
CL0258, an exposure-response modelling study of BRV as adjunctive therapy in children with POS, 
was conducted to support the dosing scheme proposed in this application as well as dosing in 
future studies. CL0258 was based on Phase 3 PK/PD data from adults and children who received 
levetiracetam (LEV) and on Phase 2 and 3 PK/PD data from adults who received BRV as well as PK 
data from children in N01263. The LEV PK/PD model has been used to assess if and how the PK/PD 
relationship scales from adults to paediatric subjects. The existing BRV PK/PD model in adult 
subjects has been updated with a scaling component in order to predict PD (seizure count) changes 
in paediatric subjects receiving BRV. 
The final objectives of the analysis was to scale an existing adult population PK/PD model for BRV 
into children, using the information from a combined adult-paediatric PK/PD model for LEV, a 
compound with the same primary mechanism of action, and to predict the effective dose of BRV in 
children aged 4 to 16 years. 
Overall, the final PK model can be considered acceptable, also in the light of the GOF plots 
indicating virtual absence of systematic model misspecification regarding incorporation of the size 
covariate effect WT, and age and no apparent model misspecification regarding population 
predictions, TAD, or time in study. 
VPCs generated from the final LEV PK/PD model, for median % from baseline and fraction 
responders, suggest a reasonable model performance, and furthermore prediction corrected VPCs 
of change from baseline versus Cav display an adequate model fit.

It is acknowledged that few patients have been treated with brivaracetam in study N01263, 
however, model diagnostics suggest a reasonable model fit which further support the dose 
selection in the paediatric population.  
According to the MAH, the simulations conducted in CL0258 allowed characterization of the 
paediatric BRV dose-response curve and suggest that BRV 1mg/kg/day is an effective dose and 
that the maximum response is obtained at approximately BRV 4mg/kg/day dosing (for body 
weights <50kg, with a maximum of 200mg/day for body weights ≥50kg) in paediatric patients ≥4 
years of age. This range (1-4mg/kg/day) ensures to reach BRV Css consistent with the ones 
observed in adult with the administration of BRV from 50 to 200mg/day. However analyzing the 
simulations the added benefit with the higher doses seems to be not showed. Simulated overall 
BRV effect by daily dose and age, in children aged 4-16 years, showed that only a slight further 
benefit is expected following 3 mg/kg/day vs. 2 mg/kg/day and no benefit seems to be simulated 
with the 4 mg/kg/day. 
The simulated BRV% change in seizure count from baseline by daily dose and age, for mixture-
model responder population in children aged 4-16 years, the change from baseline simulated 
following 3 mg/kg/day, 4 mg/kg/day 5 mg/kg/day appears to be the same. Given that the 
recommended adult dose is 50 to 200 mg/day, where 200 mg/day is considered to be near or at 
the plateau of the exposure-response relationship, a paediatric dose range of 1 to 4 mg/kg/day 
(WT<50kg) is therefore supported by the data.  
The MAH has provided an in depth description of the similarities between BRV and LEV in support 
of the extrapolation of LEV PKPD relationship to BRV.  Most importantly, BRV and LEV have a 
similar primary mechanism of action, through their affinity for synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A). 
Compared with LEV, BRV displays a higher selectivity and affinity for SV2A and does not display 
any other relevant pharmacological mechanism of action, including absence of any relevant effect 
on voltage-gated sodium, calcium and potassium channels and an absence of a direct action on 
inhibitory and excitatory receptors including AMPA, glycine and GABA-A.  
2.4.8.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Population PK modelling and simulations have been used to provide evidence for Briviact exposure 
similarity between adults and paediatric patients (≥4 years). The results support the proposed 
posology in the paediatric population which is appropriately described in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Brivaracetam’s efficacy has been considered established as adjunctive treatment of partial-onset 
seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients from 16 years of age with epilepsy 
based on a clinical development program including two dose-ranging studies, three pivotal studies  
and one supportive flexible-dose study. The applicant has provided support for efficacy of BRV in 
the treatment of POS at adjunctive doses of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day.  
The efficacy of brivaracetam in childhood POS is based on extrapolation of efficacy from currently 
approved adult clinical data previously submitted and adult data and PK bridging and no further 
clinical efficacy data is provided within this variation. This is in accordance with regulatory guidance 
and previous practice. 
Doses of 1mg/kg/day to 4mg/kg/day are proposed for the treatment of children and adolescents 
<50kg, the adult dose range is proposed for adolescents 50kg or greater.

2.5.1.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Brivaracetam’s efficacy as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalization in adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy is 
considered established based on PK data supporting a similar exposure as in adults, where clinical 
efficacy was directly studied. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety pool for pediatric subjects ≥1 month to <17 years of age with epilepsy (Pool Paediatric 
Studies)  included  data  from  the  completed  open-label  core  study  (N01263)  and  ongoing  open-
label, follow-up study (N01266). N01266 was initially designed as a long-term follow-up (LTFU) to 
N01263 (enrolled subjects with either focal epilepsy or generalized epilepsy), but was amended to 
allow direct enrollment of subjects ≥4 to <17 years of age with focal epilepsy (Table 14. ). 
Subjects  with  POS  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies  were  also  summarized by  POS  summary  groups:  <4 
years,  ≥4  to  <16  years,  and  Total  POS  (included  subjects  who  were  16  years  of  age  at  study 
entry). Paediatric subjects (who were <17 years of age at the time of study entry) enrolled in the 
adult studies were not included in Pool Paediatric Studies. 
Subjects  in  the  paediatric  studies  were  given  doses  of  BRV  from  0.8  to  5.0mg/kg/day,  not 
exceeding  200mg/day.  For  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  the  calculation  of  BRV  modal  daily  doses 
considered  the  administration  of  both  oral  solution  and  oral  tablets,  where  oral  solution  was 
administered in mg/kg doses and tablets were administered in mg doses.

N01263: Brivaracetam oral solution was administered at weekly increasing doses of approximately 
0.4, 0.8, and 1.6mg/kg twice-daily (bid) (0.8, 1.6, and 3.2mg/kg/day) for subjects ≥8 years of age 
and 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0mg/kg bid (1.0, 2.0, and 4.0mg/kg/day) for subjects <8 years of age. A total 
of  100  subjects  were  enrolled  and  99  subjects  received  BRV,  including  30  subjects  who  were  28 
days to 23 months of age, 51 subjects who were 2 to 11 years of age, and 18 subjects who were 
12  to  <16  years  of  age.  The  final  clinical  study  report  (CSR)  was  submitted  with  the  original 
application. 
N01266:  Still  ongoing,  initially  designed  as  a  (long-term  follow-up)  LTFU  study  to  N01263 
(enrolled  subjects  ≥1  month  to  <16  years  of  age  with  POS  or  generalized  seizures),  but  was 
amended  to  allow  direct  enrolment  of  subjects  ≥4  to  <17  years  of  age  with  focal  (herein  called 
POS)  epilepsy  in  order  to  have  safety  data  for  at  least  100  subjects  for  1  year  to  support  the 
proposed  indication  as  requested  by  the  EU  guidance  on  epilepsy.  The  age  for  enrolment  of 
subjects  from  N01263  into  N01266  was  <17  years  of  age  to  allow  for  subjects  who  turned  16 
during enrolment in N01263. 
Dose  adjustments  of  BRV  and  any  concomitant  AEDs  are  allowed  at  any  time  based  on  clinical 
judgment.  Subjects  who  directly  enrolled  into  N01266  participate  in  an  Up-Titration  Period  of  at 
least  7-days  duration,  after  which  such  subjects  enter  the  Evaluation  Period  and  receive  flexible 
dosing of BRV as described above. 
Methods 
Study periods and study participants 
The Evaluation Visit (EV) corresponded to the first study visit for LTFU subjects, and for direct 
enrollers (DE) subjects to the visit at which they enter the Evaluation Period upon completion of  
the Screening Visit (ScrV) and at least 1 Titration Visit (TV), as shown below in Table 15.

The Up-Titration Period is only applicable to DE subjects, and the start date is the date of the first 
dose of BRV. The Evaluation Period extends from the EV to the Final Visit (FV) for subjects who 
continue in the study until it ends or until the Early Discontinuation Visit (EDV) for subjects who 
prematurely discontinue the study and down titrate BRV over a maximum of 4 weeks (Down-
Titration Period) Table 16:

After 2 weeks free of study drug (Safety Period), subjects will complete the Safety Visit (SV). 
During the Evaluation Period, Minimal Evaluation Visits (MEVs) and Full Evaluation Visits (FEVs) are 
performed alternatively every month during the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter, with 
a Yearly Evaluation Visit (YEV) every 12 months. Both safety data and efficacy data (seizure data) 
are collected during the study. The Post-Baseline Period is defined as the Evaluation, Down-
Titration, and Post-Treatment Periods combined.

Behaviour and cognition 
The  effect  of  BRV  on  behaviour  was  assessed  using  the  Achenbach  Child  Behaviour  Checklist 
(CBCL) in subjects ≥18 months of age.  
The  effect  of  BRV  on  cognition  in  subjects  <18  months  of  age  was  assessed  using  the  Bayley 
Scales  of  Infant  and  Toddler  Development,  Third  Edition  (Bayley-III®),  applicable  only  to  long-
term  follow-up  [LTFU]  subjects  enrolled  in  English-speaking  countries,  whereas  the  effect  of  BRV 
on  cognition  in  subjects  ≥2  years  of  age  (after  Protocol  Amendment  3,  dated  26  Sep  2012)  was 
explored  using 
the  Behaviour  Rating 
Inventory  of  Executive 
Function®-Preschool 
Version/Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function® (BRIEF-P/BRIEF). 
The effect of BRV on health-related quality of life was explored using the Paediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory™ (PedsQL™) in subjects ≥1 month of age which after Protocol Amendment 3, was also 
added to the assessments for subjects ≥2 years of age. 
Of note, full efficacy results, pharmacokinetics (PK), and direct cost parameters are not presented 
in this interim clinical study report (CSR), and will be fully reported only in the final CSR.  
Treatments and dose selection 
Brivaracetam oral solutions, at concentrations of 1.0mg/mL and 10mg/mL, are supplied in 150mL 
and  300mL  glass  bottles,  respectively.  Measuring  devices  are  polypropylene  syringes  (1.0mL  and 
10mL) with an adaptor able to fit the 2 bottle sizes. 
Brivaracetam oral tablets are provided in the following strengths: 10mg, 25mg, and 50mg. 
Brivaracetam  is  administered  twice  daily  (bid)  in  2  equally  divided  doses  approximately  12  hours 
apart. All LTFU subjects must be able to tolerate the minimum BRV dose specified in the previous 
study  to  be  eligible  for  entry  into  the  Evaluation  Period  of  N01266.  All  DE  subjects  are  screened 
and participate in up to 3 weeks of an Up-Titration Period during which are required to tolerate at 
least  1.0mg/kg/day  prior  to  entering  the  Evaluation  Period  on  that  dose.  Should  a  DE  subject 
demonstrate,  in  the  opinion  of  the  Investigator,  acceptable  tolerability  and  seizure  control  on  the 
same daily dose of BRV (no lower than the minimum specified dose) for 7±2 days during the Up-
Titration  Period, the  subject  attends the  Entry  Visit (EV)  and  enters  the  Evaluation  Period  on that 
dose. 
With  regards  to  the  dose  selection,  the  dosing  scheme  initially  included  in  N01266  and  gathered 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 48/112 
 
  
  
 
from  the  PK  analyses  of  study  N01263  showed  that  the  plasma  concentrations  approximating  the 
concentrations for adults receiving BRV 200mg/day could not be achieved, hence the same doses 
were recommended in all paediatric subgroups, ≥1 month to <17 years of age. For all subjects, the 
approximate  doses  to  be  administered  are  0.5,  1.0,  and  2.0mg/kg  bid  (1.0,  2.0,  and 
4.0mg/kg/day,  respectively),  with  the  daily  doses  not  exceeding  the  maximums  of  50mg/day, 
100mg/day, and 200mg/day for Weeks 1, 2, and 3  of up-titration, respectively. This scheme was 
derived by the PK linearity of BRV in adults up to 1 order of magnitude above the therapeutic dose 
range, the expected efficacious dose to be from 50mg/day up to 200mg/day and by the faster BRV 
elimination observed in N01263 for paediatric subjects in respect with adults, resulting in a lower 
plasma  concentration.  Therefore,  clearance  of  BRV  was  shown  to  be  higher  in  paediatric  subjects 
than in adult subjects. 
Modal dose calculation 
Modal daily dose is summarized by the following categories: 0.0 to <1.0, 1.0 to <2.0, 2.0 to <3.0, 
3.0  to  ≤4.0,  and  >4.0mg/kg/day,  after  conveniently  convert  the  tablet  doses  (in  mg/day)  to 
mg/kg/day  where  appropriate  and  after  considering  both  administration  of  oral  solution  and  oral 
tablets.

Statistical methods 
The data reported in the interim CSR included only subjects within the clinical cutoff date of 31 Aug 
2016; after this date for the ongoing subjects were not included. All summaries are descriptive and 
no statistical hypothesis testing is planned. 
For  categorical  parameters,  the  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  in  each  category  were 
presented.  The  denominator  for  percentages  is  based  on  the  number  of  subjects  appropriate  for 
the  purpose  of  analysis.  For  continuous  parameters,  descriptive  statistics  include  number  of 
subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  
The Safety Set (SS) consists of all enrolled subjects who took at least 1 dose of BRV in this long-
term study. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all subjects in the SS who have a Baseline and 
at least 1 completed post-Baseline daily record card or EEG. All safety analyses were performed on 
the SS. 
Adverse  events  were  tabulated  by  MeDRA  SOC  and  PT.  All  AE  summaries  were  presented  by  3-
month time intervals.

As  of  the  clinical  cut-off date  of 31  Aug  2016, 213 subjects  had  enrolled  in the  study  and  after  7 
screening failures from the DE group only, 206 subjects started the study and were included in the 
SS,  comprehending  86  subjects  and  120  subjects  in  the  LTFU  cohort  and  the  DE  cohort, 
respectively.  According  to  age  subgroups  overall,  in  the  ≥1  month  to  <2  years,  the  ≥2  to  <12 
years and the ≥12 to <17 years groups there are n=25, n=131 and n=50 subjects, respectively. 
A  total  of  126  subjects  (61.2%)  are  ongoing;  of  these,  41  subjects  (47.7%)  and  85  subjects 
(70.8%)  are  in  the  LTFU  cohort  and  in  the  DE  cohort,  respectively.  Overall,  80  subjects  (38.8%) 
discontinued  from  the  study,  including  45  subjects  (52.3%)  in  the  LTFU  cohort  and  35  subjects 
(29.2%)  in  the  DE  cohort.  Lack  of  efficacy  was  the  most  common  primary  reason  for 
discontinuation  (28  subjects  [13.6%]),  followed  by  adverse  events  and  consent  withdrawn  (18 
subjects [8.7%] each) both prevailing in the LTFU cohort. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
Overall,  the  mean  age  of  subjects  in  the  SS  at  the  time  of  entry  into  the  study  was  8.32  years 
(range: 0.17 to 16.92 years). The mean age of subjects by age groups was 1.21, 7.53, and 13.92 
years  in  the  ≥1  month  to  <2  years,  ≥2  to  <12  years,  and  ≥12  to  <17  years  of  age  groups, 
respectively. The mean weight was 9.54, 27.12, and 51.91kg in the ≥1 month to <2 years, ≥2 to 
<12  years,  and  ≥12  to  <17  years  of  age  groups,  respectively.  LTFU  subjects  weighed  ≥3kg  (per 
Inclusion  Criterion  8  of  N01263).  The  mean  height  was  75.26,  123.77,  and  158.41cm  in  the  ≥1 
month to <2 years, ≥2 to <12 years, and ≥12 to <17 years of age groups, respectively. The mean 
BMI was 16.27, 17.05, and 20.52kg/m2 in the ≥1 month to <2 years, ≥2 to <12 years, and ≥12 
to  <17  years  of  age  groups,  respectively.  Overall,  115  subjects  (55.8%)  were  male,  and  the 
majority  of  subjects  were  White  (146  subjects  [70.9%])  and  not  of  Hispanic  or  Latino  ethnicity 
(141 subjects [68.4%]). 
Seizure classification history  
Mean age at time of diagnosis was 0.52 years, 2.99 years and 6.02 years in the ≥1 month to <2 
years  group,  the  ≥2  to  <12  years,  and the  ≥12  to <17  years  of  age groups, respectively,  with  a 
total of 10 subjects (4.9%) having a history of status epilepticus.  
The  majority  of  subjects  presented  type  I  (focal)  seizures  (176  subjects  [85.4%]),  whereas  47 
subjects  (22.8%)  had  type  II  (generalized)  seizures,  according  to  ILAE  1981 classification.  In  the 
former group, 120 subjects (58.3%) reported seizures at Baseline that were classified as belonging 
to  group  1B  (complex  partial),  followed  by  92  subjects  (44.7%)  classified  as  having  seizures  of 
type 1C (partial evolving to secondary generalized). Among subjects of the latter group, the most 
frequently  reported  seizures  at  Baseline  were  type  IIB  (myoclonic)  for  24  subjects  (11.7%), 
followed  by  tonic  (type  IID)  and  tonic-clonic  (type  IIE)  for  17  subjects  (8.3%)  each.  A  total  of  7 
subjects (3.4%) had an unclassifiable seizure profile.

subjects or at the time of entry into N01266 for DE subjects. 
Note: Subjects may have been classified under more than 1 epileptic syndrome at Baseline. Data source: Table 5.1.2 
Previous and ongoing diseases (epilepsy excluded) 
Excluding  epilepsy,  188  subjects  (90.3%)  had  at  least  1  previous  (resolved)  or  ongoing  general 
medical condition at the ScrV of the previous study for LTFU subjects or at the ScrV of N01266 for 
DE subjects. In this category, the most common prior and concomitant medical conditions (≥30% 
of  all  subjects)  were  reported  in  the  SOC  of  Nervous  system  disorders  (108  subjects  [52.4%]), 
followed by Infections and infestations (70 subjects [34.0%]) and Congenital, familial and genetic 
disorders  (64  subjects  [31.1%]),  with  developmental  delay  being  the  most  common  PT  (32 
subjects [15.5%). 
Prior AEDs 
Overall, 185 subjects (89.8%) had taken at least one AED prior to entry into the parent BRV study 
(LTFU  subjects)  and  into  N01266  (DE  subjects).  A  total  of  59  subjects  (28.6%)  had  taken  0  to  1 
prior AEDs, 83 subjects (40.3%) had taken 2 to 4 prior AEDs, and 64 subjects (31.1%) had taken 
5  or  more  prior  AEDs.  Levetiracetam  (LEV)  was  the  most  common  prior  AED  (113  subjects 
[54.9%]). The proportions of subjects aged 2 to <12 years and 12 to <17 years were comparable 
in terms of prior AEDs (in descending order: LEV, DPA, TPM, CBZ, OXC, LTG, CLB, CNZ). Vigabatrin 
is most commonly used in subjects with West syndrome as expected by its highest incidence below 
2 years of age. 
AED medications taken at study entry 
The proportions of the most common (≥10% of all subjects) AED medications taken at entry into 
the  previous  study  for  LTFU  subjects  and  time  of  entry  into  N01266  for  DE  subjects  are 
summarized in Table 19. .

Note: WHO-DRL Version Jun/2012 was used.  Data source: Table 6.2.5 
The totality of LTFU and DE subjects were taking at least 1 AED at entry into the previous study or 
at  entry  at  N01266  study,  respectively.  Fifty-nine  subjects  (28.6%)  reported  taking  1  AED,  93 
subjects  (45.1%),  and  54  subjects  (26.2%)  reported  taking  2  AEDs  and  ≥3  AEDs  at  study  entry, 
respectively.  A  total  of  9 subjects  (4.4%)  were  using  VNS  at  the  time  of  study  entry,  including  4 
subjects (3.1%) in the 2 to <12 years age group and 5 subjects (10.0%) in the 12 to <17 years 
age group. 
Concomitant AEDs 
All  206  subjects  were  taking  at  least  1  concomitant  AED.  Valproate  was  the  most  commonly 
reported  concomitant  AED,  taken  by  approximately  half  of  all  subjects  (104  subjects  [50.5%]), 
followed  by  diazepam  (55  subjects  [26.7%]),  clobazam  (53  subjects  [25.7%]),  topiramate  (52 
subject  [25.2%]),  lamotrigine  (48  subjects  [23.3%]),  oxcarbazepine  (39  subjects  [18.9%])  and 
carbamazepine (38 subjects [18.4%]). 
Non-AED medications at study entry  
Most  non-AEDs  taken  at  study  entry  by  ≥5  subjects  were  in  the  pharmacological  groups  of  the 
Nervous  system  (44  subjects  [21.4%  of  all  subjects])  and  alimentary  tract  and  metabolism  (40 
subjects  [19.4%  of  all  subjects]).  Paracetamol  and  risperidone  were  the  most  common  non 
anticonvulsant  drugs  at  study  entry  (9  subjects  [4.4%]  each),  followed  by  colecalciferol  and 
melatonin  (7  subjects  [3.4%]  each),  macrogol,  ibuprofen,  levothyroxine  sodium,  and  pyridoxine 
hydrochloride  (6  subjects  [2.9%]  each),  and  methylphenidate  and  folic  acid  (5  subjects  [2.5%] 
each). 
Concomitant non-AED medications 
The  majority  of  subjects  (180  subjects  [87.4%])  were  taking  at  least  1  concomitant  non-AED 
during  the  study,  being  anti-infectives  for  systemic  use  (139  subjects  [67.5%])  and  nervous 
system (126 subjects [61.2%]), the most commonly reported concomitant non-AEDs, followed by 
alimentary  tract  and  metabolism  (107  subjects  [51.9%]),  and  respiratory  system  (105  subjects 
[51.0%]). 
Adult Safety Pools (for comparison)  
Pool S4 
Pool  S4  was  originally  defined  for  the  original  application  and  consisted  of  subjects  with  focal  or 
generalized  epilepsy  who  received  BRV  in  core  studies  N01114,  N01193,  N01252,  N01253, 
N01254,  N01358,  and  N01395,  and  follow-up  studies  N01125,  N01199,  N01372,  and  N01379, 
excluding subjects who enrolled in N01372 from N01394. No new subjects were added to Pool S4 
since  the  original  application  was  reviewed.  The  clinical  cutoff  date  for  the  current  application 
includes approximately 2 years of additional exposure to BRV. 
Subjects in N01258 were included in Pool S4 only if they received BRV in N01379. Only safety data 
collected during treatment with BRV in N01379 were included in the integrated summaries for Pool 
S4.  N01114  included  a  Conversion  Period  during  which  subjects  randomized  to  placebo  (PBO) 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 53/112 
 
  
  
 
started  treatment  with  BRV  prior  to  enrollment  in  follow-up  study  N01125.  All  subjects  who 
received BRV during the Conversion Period were included in Pool S4. 
Pool Monotherapy 
Pool Monotherapy was originally defined for the original application and consisted of subjects who 
received BRV in core studies N01276 and N01306, and LTFU study N01315. No new subjects were 
added to Pool Monotherapy since the original application was reviewed. The clinical cutoff date for 
the current application includes approximately 2 years of additional exposure to BRV. 
Except when noted, summaries for Pool Monotherapy presented results for all BRV doses combined 
and by modal dose categories 5, 20, 50, 100, 150, and 200mg/day. 
Of  150  randomized  subjects  in  N01276  or  N01306,  all  150  subjects  received  BRV  and  comprised 
Pool Monotherapy. 
Pool ULD 
Pool ULD consisted of subjects with ULD who received BRV in core studies N01187 and N01236 and 
follow-up  study  N01125.  No  new  subjects  were  added  to  Pool  ULD  since  the  original  application 
was reviewed. The clinical cutoff date for the current application includes approximately 2 years of 
additional exposure to BRV. 
N01187  and  N01236  included  a  Conversion  Period  during  which  subjects  randomized  to  PBO 
started  treatment  with  BRV  prior  to  enrollment  into  follow-up  study  N01125.  All  subjects  who 
received BRV during the Conversion Period were included in Pool ULD, including any subjects who 
did not receive BRV in N01125. 
Patient exposure 
In Pool Paediatric Studies, of the 219 paediatric subjects exposed to BRV, 168 were subjects with 
POS. Of these paediatric subjects with POS, 16 subjects were <4 years of age, 149 subjects were 
≥ 4 to <16 years of age, and 3 subjects were 16 years of age. The total subject-years of exposure 
for all subjects in Pool Paediatric Studies was 399.5 years and for subjects ≥ 4 to <16 years with 
POS was 249.7 years. For paediatric subjects ≥ 4 to <16 years with POS, 116 subjects (77.9%) 
were exposed to BRV for ≥ 6 months, 104 subjects (69.8%) for ≥ 12 months, 58 subjects (38.9%) 
for ≥ 24 months, 14 subjects (9.4%) for ≥ 48 months, and 2 subjects (1.3%) for ≥ 60 months. 
An overall summary of subject-years of exposure and duration of exposure to BRV in BRV Overall 
by paediatric summary group in Pool Paediatric Studies is presented in Table 20. .

Table 20.  Overall BRV exposure by paediatric summary group in Pool Paediatric Studies 
As of the clinical cutoff date, a total of 206 subjects had been exposed to at least 1 dose of BRV in 
N01266 for a total of 393.7 subject-years. Of these, 145 subjects (70.4%) had been exposed to 
BRV for at least 12 months, 92 subjects (44.7%) had been exposed to BRV for at least 24 months, 
50 subjects (24.3%) had been exposed to BRV for at least 36 months, and 32 subjects (15.5%) 
had been exposed to BRV for at least 48 months. 
Overall, the highest percentage of subjects had BRV modal daily doses >4.0mg/kg/day (96 
subjects [46.6%]), followed by >3.0 to 4.0mg/kg/day (63 subjects [30.6%]) and >2.0 to 
3.0mg/kg/day (26 subjects [12.6%]). Few subjects (n=15) had modal doses below 2.0mg/kg/day. 
Of the subjects with a BRV modal dose >4.0mg/kg/day, 4 subjects had a modal dose between 4.38 
and 4.6mg/kg/day; 15 subjects had a modal dose of 5.0mg/kg/day; 3 subjects had a modal dose 
>5.0mg/kg/day (modal doses of 5.17, 6.0, and 6.0mg/kg/day); and 30 subjects weighed <50kg 
and had tablet doses ≥ 4mg/kg/day when converted to mg/kg/day. A total of 31 subjects were 
ever exposed to a dose of ≥ 5.0mg/kg/day. 
The majority of subjects (53.1%) who had a modal dose >4.0mg/kg/day remained in the study for 
at least 24 months. For subjects who had modal doses of >3.0 to 4.0mg/kg/day and of >2.0 to 
3.0mg/kg/day a majority (≥ 50%) remained on treatment for at least 21 months and 18 months, 
respectively.

The ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies included 149 subjects who received BRV. 
Of these subjects, 97 (65.1%) were still participating in the long-term study (ongoing) at the time 
of the clinical cutoff date (31 Aug 2016) in BRV Overall; 2 subjects (1.3%) completed the core 
study but did not enter the long-term study. A total of 50 subjects (33.6%) in BRV Overall 
discontinued from either the core study or long-term study; the most frequently reported primary 
reason for discontinuation was lack of efficacy (16 subjects [10.7%]).  
Across BRV modal daily dose groups, in general, the results were similar and there were no dose-
related trends. The exceptions were the BRV 0.0 to 1.0mg/kg/day group, where the most 
frequently reported primary reason for discontinuation was AE (5 subjects [33.3%]), and the BRV 
>1.0 to 2.0mg/kg/day group, where the most frequently reported primary reason for 
discontinuation was subject choice (2 subjects [20.0%]). 
Adult/adolescent exposure 
In addition to data from the paediatric BRV clinical studies included in this application, data are 
included for the adult BRV studies (see above). In Pool Monotherapy, 150 subjects were exposed to 
BRV; the total subject-years of exposure was 394.6 years. In Pool S4, of the 2437 subjects 
exposed to BRV, 2368 were subjects with POS; the total subject-years of exposure for all subjects 
in Pool S4 was 7878.9 years.  In Pool ULD, 102 subjects were exposed to BRV; the total subject-
years of exposure was 459.7 years.

Note: The Total POS summary group included subjects <4 years, ≥4 to <16 years, and subjects who were 16 years at the time

Note: All pediatric subjects included subjects with POS and other seizure types.   
In Pool Paediatric Studies, the age ranged from 0 to 16 years, approximately half the subjects were 
male, and the majority of subjects were White. In the ≥ 4 to <16 years POS group in Pool 
Paediatric Studies, the mean age was 9.0 years (range: 4 to 15 years); other demographic and 
baseline characteristics were similar to all subjects in Pool Paediatric Studies. There were no 
notable differences in subject demographic characteristics across BRV modal daily dose groups. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects with POS in Pool Paediatric Studies were 
comparable with Pool S4, with the exception of age, height, weight, and body mass index, as 
expected. In general, the demographic and baseline characteristics of Pool Monotherapy, Pool S4,

and Pool ULD were similar for gender (approximately half males and half females), mean age 
(ranged from 36.3 to 39.6 years), and overall racial group (majority were White). In Pool 
Monotherapy, the percentage of subjects who were taking an AED inducer at core study entry was 
higher (47.3%), compared with Pool S4 and Pool ULD (14.7% and 29.4%, respectively); and in 
Pool ULD, the majority of subjects took 2 to 4 previous AEDs (73.5%), compared with Pool 
Monotherapy and Pool S4 (44.7% and 43.4%, respectively). Though there are understandable 
differences between the populations (eg, POS vs ULD), the demographic and Baseline 
characteristics in the various pools were generally similar. In addition, to the previous adult subject 
exposures, an adequate number of paediatric subject exposures are included in this application to 
characterize the safety of BRV at doses 50 to 200mg/day for up to 60 months of exposure.

In Pool Paediatric Studies, pre-existing conditions or diseases were reported as medical history by 
the vast majority of subjects (n=196 [89.5%]). The most frequently reported conditions/diseases 
were developmental delay (34 subjects [15.5%]), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (24 
subjects [11.0%]), cerebral palsy (20 subjects [9.1%]), constipation (19 subjects [8.7%]), and 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (18 subjects [8.2%]). The reported medical history in Pool 
Pediatric Studies is typical of pediatric subjects with epilepsy. 
The vast majority of POS subjects in ≥the 4 to <16 years age group (n=134 [89.9%]) had at least 
one medical history including conditions that resolved prior or that were ongoing at study entry 
without relevant differences among modal daily dose categories (range: 86.7%-92.3%). The most 
frequently reported conditions/diseases by Preferred Term were developmental delay (22 subjects 
[14.8%]), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (21 subjects [14.1%]), cerebral palsy (16 
subjects [10.7%]), and strabismus and mental retardation (11 subjects each [7.4%]). With respect 
to ADHD, there seemed to be a trend toward a dose-effect, from the >2 to 3 mg/kg/day modal 
dose (2 subjects [10.5%] towards >4 mg/kg/day modal daily dose (6 subjects [23.1%]). However 
the number seemed overall too small to draw definitive conclusions. 
Concomitant medications 
In Pool Paediatric Studies, all 219 subjects were taking AEDs at study entry and used concomitant 
AEDs during the studies. The use of LEV at study entry and for the 4 weeks prior to the Screening 
Visit was an exclusion criterion. The most frequently used concomitant AEDs during the studies 
were valproate, diazepam, clobazam, topiramate, and lamotrigine. 
In the ≥ 4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, all 149 subjects were taking AEDs at 
study entry and used concomitant AEDs during the studies. The most frequently used concomitant 
AEDs during the studies were valproate, diazepam, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, topiramate, 
oxcarbazepine, and clobazam. There were no notable differences in concomitant AED use across 
BRV modal daily dose groups. 
 In Pool S4, 99.9% of subjects used concomitant AEDs during the studies; the most frequently 
reported concomitant AEDs were carbamazepine, lamotrigine, valproate, and topiramate. 
Concomitant AEDs used in Pool S4, Pool Monotherapy, and Pool ULD were representative of the 
target population (Table 25.  and Table 26. ).

There  were  higher  incidences  of  severe  TEAEs  at  the  higher  BRV  modal  daily  doses  (>3.0  to  4.0 
and  >4.0mg/kg/day,  compared  with  the  lower  BRV  modal  daily  doses.  The  most  frequently 
reported common TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (24.2% of subjects); pharyngitis (20.1%); pyrexia, 
convulsion, headache (17.4%), vomiting (14.8%), diarrhea (12.1%) and somnolence (10.4%). The 
incidences  of  convulsion  and  headache  were  similar  to  Pool  S4.  There  were  higher  incidences  of 
nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, pyrexia, and vomiting compared with Pool S4 (Table 28. ). 
The MAH reported a higher incidence of diarrhoea (13.9% vs 7.3%) in children with the POS ≥4-
<12  years  compared  to  POS  ≥12-<16  years  group.  Concerns  were  raised  regarding  the  oral 
solution  formulation  of  brivaracetam  contains  sorbitol.  The  most  common  ADRs  known  to  be 
related  to  sorbitol  are  diarrhoea,  flatulence  and  abdominal  pain.  The  incidence  of  diarrhea  was 
higher  in  the  paediatric  subjects  with  POS  aged  ≥4  to  <16  years  compared  with  the  adult  (Pool 
S4)  (12.1%  vs  8.4%).  All  the  events  (18)  occurred  in  the  paediatric  population  were  considered 
non-serious and not related with BRV treatment. The MAH specified that with the updated data on 
Pool Pediatric Studies up to 15 Mar 2017 no additional event of diarrhea was reported.  
It  is  acknowledged  that  diarrhoea  is  one  of  the  events  consistent  with  the  higher  frequency  of 
infectious  diseases  in the paediatric  population.  This  AE  is  usually  associated with  gastrointestinal 
viruses  or  bacteria-related  infections,  antibiotic  therapy,  nutritional  aspects.  All  cases  of  diarrhea 
were  non-serious,  the  majority  were  mild  in  intensity  (moderate  diarrhea  was  reported  in  only  5 
patients),  did  not  lead  to  BRV  discontinuation,  and  were  not  considered  as  related  to  BRV 
treatment. No specific pattern in terms of temporal relationship with BRV treatment was observed. 
The  median  duration  of  the  event  was  relatively  short  (3  days).  Most  cases  were  related  to 
antibiotic  therapy.  Moreover,  all  subjects  received  concomitant  antiepileptic  medications,  some  of 
them associated with diarrhea as adverse drug reaction.  
As  regard  to  the  potential  impact  of  sorbitol  excipient  on  the  occurrence  of  diarrhea,  in  the    POS 
≥4 to <12 years group, 8 of 15 patients with diarrhea were receiving BRV oral solution. However, 
no  specific  pattern  in  terms  of  temporal  relationship  with  the  treatment  was  observed  and  when 
the  dosage  was  increased  in  4  subjects,  this  was  not  associated  with  diarrhea  recurrence.  
Moreover,  the  MAH  specify  that  the  amount  of  sorbitol  (95.92mg/kg/day)  present  if  the  maximal 
recommended  dose  for  BRV  (4  mg/kg/day)  is  given,  is  lower  than  the  amount  (140  mg/kg/day) 
reported as potentially associated with gastrointestinal discomfort and mild laxative effect. 
Given  the  above,  no  definite  conclusion  can  be  drawn  on  the  causal  relationship  between  the 
excipient sorbitol and the occurrence of diarrhea.

In the existing adult and adolescent indication, the most frequently reported adverse reactions for 
brivaracetam were somnolence (14.3%) and dizziness (11%) usually in mild to moderate intensity. 
Somnolence and fatigue (8.2%) were reported at a higher incidence with increasing dose. 
A  higher  TEAEs  incidence  Dysmenorrhea  (7.3%vs  1.9%)  and  Gynaecomastia  (4.9%  vs  0)  were 
reported in the POS ≥12-<16 years group than in the POS ≥4-<12 years group. The MAH specified 
that  with  the  updated  data  on  Pool  Pediatric  Studies  up  to  15  Mar  2017  no  additional  event  of 
dysmenorrhea was reported. The explanation provided by the MAH; whereby the small number of 
patients in the BRV POS ≥12-<16 years group (dysmenorrhea n=3; gynaecomastia n=2) and the 
prevalence reported in the literature suggest that the findings from the BRV Pediatric Pools do not 
differ from the global pediatric population, is acceptable. 
The incidences of severe TEAEs in the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies were 
lower than in Pool Monotherapy, Pool S4, and Pool ULD. 
In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, most subjects reported TEAEs with a 
maximum  intensity  of  mild  (57  subjects  [38.3%])  or  moderate  (69  subjects  [46.3%]);  severe 
TEAEs  were  reported  by  12  subjects  (8.1%)  in  BRV  Overall.  Severe  TEAEs  were  most  frequently 
reported in the Nervous system disorders System Organ Class (SOC) (3.4%); the most frequently 
reported  severe  TEAEs  were  convulsion  (2.0%),  and  status  epilepticus  and  pneumonia  (1.3% 
each). The incidence of severe TEAEs was lower compared with Pool S4 (22.2%); the incidences of 
the most frequently reported TEAEs of convulsion and status epilepticus were similar to Pool S4. 
Dose-relation 
The  TAEs  of  nasopharyngitis  and  headache  tended  to  have  increasing  incidences  with  increasing 
doses (Table 29. ).

 In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, most subjects reported TEAEs with a 
maximum  intensity  of  mild  (57  subjects  [38.3%])  or  moderate  (69  subjects  [46.3%]);  severe 
TEAEs  were  reported  by  12  subjects  (8.1%)  in  BRV  Overall.  In  general,  the  intensity  of  TEAEs  in 
subjects ≥4 to <16 years with POS is consistent with the intensity of TEAEs in adults. 
Drug-related TEAEs (as determined by the Investigator) 
In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  36.9%  of  subjects  in  BRV  Overall 
reported  TEAEs  that  were  considered  drug-related  by  the  Investigator.  Drug-related  TEAEs  were 
reported most frequently in the Psychiatric disorders SOC (16.8%) and Nervous system disorders 
SOC  (16.1%);  the  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  TEAEs  were  somnolence  (6.0%)  and 
decreased appetite (4.7%). 
The incidence of drug-related TEAEs in Pool Paediatric Studies was lower than in Pool S4 (38.8% vs 
57.0%,  respectively).  The  incidence  of  somnolence  was  lower  than  in  Pool  S4  (6.8%  vs  13.0%, 
respectively) and the incidence of decreased appetite was higher than in Pool S4 (6.4% vs 2.5%, 
respectively). 
Adverse  events  by  safety  time  interval  for  studies  in  paediatric  subjects  with  epilepsy 
(Pool Paediatric Studies) 
In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric  Studies, the incidence of TEAEs was  highest 
during the first 3-month safety time interval, and was lower and relatively stable at all subsequent 
safety  time  intervals.  No  TEAE  SOCs  or  PTs  increased  in  frequency  over  time.  In  the  ≥4  to  <16 
years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, the most frequently reported TEAEs (reported by more 
than 1 subject and ≥5% of subjects) in any safety time interval were vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, 
irritability,  nasopharyngitis,  pharyngitis,  pharyngotonsillitis,  decreased  appetite,  headache, 
convulsion, somnolence, cough, and dysmenorrhoea. 
Adverse events during  the first  7 days  of the  Treatment Period for  studies in paediatric 
subjects with epilepsy (Pool Paediatric Studies) 
In  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  71  subjects  (32.4%)  in  BRV  Overall  reported  TEAEs  during  the  first  7 
days  of  treatment;  TEAEs  were  most  frequently  reported  in  the  General  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions  SOC  (21  subjects  [9.6%]),  Nervous  system  disorders  SOC  and 
Psychiatric  disorders  SOC  (15  subjects  each  [6.8%]),  and  Infections  and  infestations  SOC  (14 
subjects  [6.4%]).  The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  irritability  (11  subjects  [5.0%])  and 
decreased appetite (7 subjects [3.2%]). 
In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, 46 subjects (30.9%) in BRV Overall 
reported  TEAEs  during  the  first  7  days  of  treatment;  TEAEs  were  most  frequently  reported  in  the 
Psychiatric  disorders  SOC  (12  subjects  [8.1%]),  General  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions  SOC  (11  subjects  [7.4%]),  and  Nervous  system  disorders  SOC  (10  subjects  [6.7%]). 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  irritability  (6  subjects  [4.0%]),  decreased  appetite  (5 
subjects [3.4%]), and cough (5 subjects [3.4%]). 
Laboratory findings 
Hematology and blood chemistry assays 
Within Appendix 12 of the SAP that accompanied the initial MAA for Brivaracetam, the MAH had 
defined the criteria for hematology and biochemistry Parameters to be considered possibly clinically 
significant treatment-emergent (PCST). 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 70/112 
 
  
  
Overall, most of mean values for hematology parameters for the total population were within 
standard laboratory normal ranges at baseline and showed slight post-baseline values changes that 
did not show a clear prevalence in a particular age group.  
Overall, PCST hematology values in the Evaluation Period were noticed for neutrophils (35 subjects 
[17.5%] with PCST low value) and leukocytes (26 subjects [12.9%] with PCST low value). The 
main differences observed between the POS ≥4 to <12 and ≥12 to <16 years populations were 
related to the higher incidence (>25) of PCST High Hematocrit and Leukocytes in the last group 
(Hematocrit: 17.5% vs 2.9%; Leucocytes: 10.0% vs 3.8%). In the overall POS paediatric 
population ≥4 to <16, PCST AEs High hematocrit occurred with an incidence of 6.7%. The MAH 
provided clarifications: as regard to the hematocrit high PCST values, none of them was considered 
by the Investigators as related to BRV treatment, no trend in the BRV dosage or the time to onset 
was observed and no changes of BRV dose was made for these patients. Values returned to normal 
at subsequent visits. For 9 out of 10 patients, the high PCST values were within normal range 
according to the laboratory where the samples were analyzed. As regard to leukocytes high PCST 
values, eight patients (4 in each age group) showed high PCST values of leukocytes that were 
potentially related to infections concomitantly reported and, therefore, were not considered related 
to BRV treatment by the Investigators. No changes in BRV dosage was made. For 6 of these 
patients, values returned within the normal range at the subsequent visits, for only one patients 
high leukocytes values were observed at last visit. 
With regard to blood chemistry results, in the Evaluation Period the highest incidences of PCST 
blood chemistry results were reported for creatinine clearance (52 subjects [26.3%] with low 
value), GGT (26 subjects [12.9%] with PCST high value) and triglycerides (20 subjects [10.0%] 
with PCST high value).  For DE subjects during the Up-Titration Period, the only reported PCST 
chemistry value was high GGT (7 subjects [6.4%]), whereas 10 subjects (29.4%) reported PCST 
low creatinine clearance. Overall, 3 subjects discontinued from the study due to TEAEs associated 
with blood chemistry values (1 subject due to a TEAE of GGT increased, 1 subject due to TEAEs of 
ALT increased, AST increased, and GGT increased, and 1 subject due to a TEAE of hepatic enzyme 
increased. The main differences observed between the POS ≥4 to <12 and ≥12 to <16 years 
populations were related to the higher incidence (>2%) of PCST ALT and Glucose in the ≥12 to 
<16 years population (ALT: 10.0% vs 0.9%; Glucose: 4.9% vs 0) and of PCST hypernatremia in 
the ≥4 to <12 years population (Hypernatremia: 4.7% vs 2.5%). In the overall POS pediatric 
population ≥4 to <16, PCST AEs high ALT (3.3%), GGT (10.9%), sodium (4.1%), and urate 
(3.3%) occurred with a relatively high incidence. The PCST high ALT occurred during the first 
months (first 9 months) of treatments and no specific trend over the different visits was observed. 
The increase of transaminase was also observed in the BRV adult population (Pool S4).  
As regard to the higher proportion of PCST related to Hypernatremia in POS ≥4 to <12 years 
group, this AE was not observed in the BRV adult population. The MAH stated that it could be 
potentially linked to episodes of fever or dehydration that are expected to be more frequent in the 
≥4 to <12 years population. This could be considered plausible. Unfortunately, in the absence of a 
control group and due to the open-label study design and the limited numbers, it is difficult to 
conclude on the relationship between the occurrence of an AE and BRV treatment. However, the 
MAH reassures that the AEs related to hepatic and renal disorders will continue to be monitored 
through routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
Endocrinology and Tanner stage 
Mean values for the endocrinology parameters (FSH, LH, TSH, FT3, FT4) remained substantially 
within the normal ranges. No clear effect of BRV upon the sexual maturation process could be 
observed. 
Evaluation of Potential Hepatotoxicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 71/112 
 
  
  
 
An evaluation of potential cases of hepatoxicity was performed for all subjects in the study pools. 
The  evaluation  required  medical  review  of  laboratory  data  and  TEAEs  potentially  associated  with 
hepatotoxicity for all subjects. 
In  the  ≥4  to  16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  TEAEs  potentially  associated  with 
hepatotoxicity  were  reported  in  4.7%  of  subjects;  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAE  was  GGT 
increased (3.4%). The incidences of TEAEs potentially associated with hepatotoxicity in the ≥4 to 
16 years POS group was not higher than in the adult population. 
Vital signs 
Overall,  there  were  no  clinically  meaningful  mean  changes  from  Baseline  over  time  in  vital  sign 
results in Pool Paediatric Studies or the adult analysis pools (Pool Monotherapy, Pool S4, and 
Pool ULD). 
Body weight 
In Pool Pediatric Studies, there was a steady increase in mean change from Baseline over time in 
body weight in BRV Overall. According to the Applicant, this is expected, since the pediatric 
subjects are growing. 
In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Pediatric Studies, there was a steady increase in mean 
change from Baseline over time in body weight in BRV Overall; the mean increase from Baseline 
was 3.6kg at Month 12, 6.4kg at Month 24, 11.9kg at Month 36, and 19.1kg at Month 48. 
According to the Applicant, this is expected, since the pediatric subjects are growing. 
In Pool Pediatric Studies, the incidence of any PCST body weight result at any time point was 68 
subjects (31.3%) in BRV Overall; 49 subjects (22.6%) had PCST low body weight and 19 subjects 
(8.8%) had PCST high body weight at any time point. There did not appear to be any trends over 
time in the incidence of PCST body weight results. 
In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Pediatric Studies, the incidence of any PCST body weight 
result at any time point was 41 subjects (27.9%) in BRV Overall; 25 subjects (17.0%) had PCST 
low body weight and 16 subjects (10.9%) had PCST high body weight at any time point. The 
incidence of PCST low and high body weight results over time was similar; there did not appear to 
be any trends over time in the incidence of PCST low or high body weight results. 
In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Pediatric Studies, body weight changes reported as 
TEAEs in BRV Overall were weight decreased (8 subjects [12.1%]), and weight increased and 
overweight (1 subject each [0.7%]). None of these events led to permanent discontinuation of 
study drug. 
The incidence of TEAE “weight decrease” was relatively high in the ≥4 to <16 years POS group 
in the Pool Pediatric Studies. This could be related to decreased appetite that is one of the 
established ADR to BRV in adult patients, and is now proposed by the MAH as an ADR for the 
pediatric patients as well. It is reassuring that none of the TEAEs “weight decrease” led to 
permanent discontinuation of study drug. However, the MAH was asked to clarify how many of the 
TEAEs related to body weight decrease presented also decreased appetite or weight decrease 
represents a standalone TEAE. It was apparent that a relationship between weight decrease and 
decreased appetite, that is a known ADR of BRV treatment, cannot be established in POS patients 
aged ≥4 to <16 years. Moreover, weight decrease occurred in a minority of these patients and can 
be considered plausibly related to the severity of the underlying disease or to concomitant TEAEs. 
In most cases the event recovered and in no patient it led to BRV treatment discontinuation. This 
was considered reassuring. 
Pool S4 
In Pool S4, there were no clinically meaningful mean changes from Baseline over time to the Last 
Value in BRV Overall in body weight. 
In Pool S4, the incidence of any PCST body weight result at any time point in BRV Overall was 
1175 subjects (48.5%). The incidence of PCST low body weight and PCST high body weight at any 
time point were similar (605 subjects [25.0%] and 680 subjects [28.1%], respectively). There did

not appear to be a trend over time in the incidence of PCST body weight results. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The incidences of treatment-emergent SAEs in the  ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric 
Studies were similar to the incidence in Pool S4. 
Severe TEAEs were most frequently reported in the Nervous system disorders System Organ Class 
(SOC)  (3.4%);  the  most  frequently  reported  severe  TEAEs  were  convulsion  (2.0%),  and  status 
epilepticus and pneumonia (1.3% each). The incidence of severe TEAEs was lower compared with 
Pool  S4  (22.2%);  the  incidences  of  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  of  convulsion  and  status 
epilepticus  were  similar  to  Pool  S4.    A  summary  of  treatment-emergent  SAEs  reported  in  >1 
subject in BRV Overall by paediatric group in Pool Paediatric Studies is presented in Table 30. . 
In Pool Paediatric Studies, 59 subjects (26.9%) in BRV Overall reported treatment-emergent SAEs 
(Table 31. ). In all paediatric subjects, treatment-emergent SAEs were most frequently reported in 
the Nervous system disorders SOC (28 subjects [12.8%]), and Infections and infestations SOC (15 
subjects [6.8%]). The most frequently reported treatment-emergent SAEs in all paediatric subjects 
were  convulsion  (16  subjects  [7.3%],  status  epilepticus  (6  subjects  [2.7%],  pyrexia  (5  subjects 
[2.3%]), and pneumonia and dehydration (4 subjects each [1.8%]). No other SAEs were reported 
in more than 3 subjects. 
In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, treatment-emergent SAEs were 
reported in 30 subjects (20.1%) in BRV Overall. Treatment-emergent SAEs were most frequently 
reported in BRV Overall in the Nervous system disorders SOC (17 subjects [11.4%]). The most 
frequently reported SAEs in BRV Overall were convulsion (9 subjects [6.0%]) and status epilepticus 
(5 subjects [3.4%]). No other SAEs were reported in more than 2 subjects.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Summary of AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug 
In Pool Paediatric Studies and the ≥4 to <16 years POS group, the incidences of TEAEs leading to 
permanent discontinuation of study drug were lower than in Pool S4, and the incidences of TEAEs 
leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug  during  the  first  7  days  of  treatment  were 
similar to Pool S4. 
In  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  25  subjects  (11.4%)  in  BRV  Overall  reported  TEAEs  leading  to 
permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug,  and  were  most  frequently  reported  in  the  Psychiatric 
disorders  SOC  (4.1%)  and  Nervous  system  disorders  SOC  (3.2%).  The  most  frequently  reported 
TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug  were  aggression  and  suicidal  ideation 
(1.4%),  and  convulsion,  decreased  appetite,  pneumonia,  and  circulatory  collapse  (0.9%).  The 
incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug  during  the  first  7  days  of 
treatment was low (4 subjects [1.8%]). 
In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool Paediatric  Studies,  11  subjects  (7.4%)  in  BRV  Overall 
reported  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug,  and  were  most  frequently 
reported in the Psychiatric disorders SOC (4.0%) and Nervous system disorders SOC (2.0%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAE  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug  in  BRV 
Overall was aggression (2.0%). In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, the 
incidence  of  TEAEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug  during  the  first  7  days  of 
treatment was low (3 subjects [2.0%]). 
Deaths 
In  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  a  total  of  4  subjects  had  TEAEs  with  fatal  outcome  during  the  BRV 
clinical  development  program  as  of  the  clinical  cutoff  date  of  31  Aug  2016.  Three  subject  deaths 
were  reviewed  with  the  original  application  and  1  subject  died  since  the  original  application  was 
reviewed.

TEAEs of interest 
Treatment-emergent AEs identified by the MAH to be of special interest included TEAEs potentially 
associated  with  seizure  worsening,  behavioral  disorders,  suicidality,  falls,  accidents  and  injuries, 
blood  dyscrasias,  SCARs,  abuse  potential,  renal  injury,  psychosis,  and  malignancies.  For  the 
paediatric  population,  additional  TEAEs  of  interest  included  TEAEs  potentially  associated  with 
growth,  endocrine  function/sexual  maturation,  neurodevelopment,  cognitive  impairment,  anxiety, 
and depression (Table 32. ).

Table 33.  Exposure-adjusted IRs for TEAEs of interest by category in subjects ≥4 to <16 years 
with POS in Pool Paediatric Studies is presented by BRV modal daily dose 
In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, TEAEs of interest were reported most 
frequently in the following categories: behavioural disorder (36 subjects [24.2%]; IR=17.78 per 
100 subject-years), seizure worsening (32 subjects [21.5%]; IR=14.91 per 100 subject-years), 
accidents and injuries (31 subjects [20.8%]; IR=14.59 per 100 subject-years), and falls (27 
subjects [18.1%]; IR=12.40 per 100 subject-years). 
TEAEs potentially associated with seizure worsening (Pool Paediatric Studies) 
In Pool Paediatric Studies, TEAEs potentially associated with seizure worsening were reported in 58 
subjects (26.5%) in BRV Overall; the most frequently reported TEAEs were convulsion (46 subjects

[21.0%]), and status epilepticus (6 subjects [2.7%]). In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool 
Paediatric Studies, TEAEs potentially associated with seizure worsening were reported in 32 
subjects (21.5%); the most frequently reported TEAEs were convulsion (17.4%) and status 
epilepticus (3.4%). In the majority of cases, the events did not lead to adjustment of BRV dose or 
discontinuation. Convulsion (9 subjects [6.0%]), status epilepticus (5 subjects [3.4%]), and 
epilepsy and partial seizure with secondary generalisation (1 subject each [0.7%]) were reported 
as treatment emergent SAEs.  
The exposure-adjusted IRs (95% CI) for TEAEs potentially associated with seizure worsening were 
higher in the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies compared with Pool S4 (14.91 
[10.20, 21.06] and 6.01 [5.45, 6.62] per 100 subject-years), respectively (Table 34. and Table 35. 
).

Table 35.  TEAEs potentially associated with seizure worsening in subjects ≥4 to <16 years with 
POS in Pool Paediatric Studies is presented by BRV modal daily dose 
The incidence of reports of TEAEs potentially associated with seizure worsening was highest during 
Months 1 to 3 (12 subjects [8.1%]), and decreased thereafter (during Months 4 to 12 [range: 5 to 
6 subjects; 4.6% to 5.2%], during Months 13 to 24 [range: 2 to 5 subjects; 2.8% to 6.1%], and 
after Month 25 [0 or 1 subject]). No TEAEs potentially associated with seizure worsening were 
reported during the Down-Titration Period. 
Treatment-emergent AEs potentially associated with suicidality 
In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, 7 subjects (4.7%) reported suicidal 
ideation, including 1 subject (0.7%) who attempted suicide 10 days after discontinuing BRV. Six of 
the 7 subjects were >10 years of age at onset and 1 subject was 8 years of age. 
 In  4  of  the  7  subjects,  the  TEAE  of  suicidal  ideation  occurred  within  the  first  3  months  of  BRV 
initiation. All events were mild and nonserious, except 1 event that was a severe SAE. Six of the 7 
events resolved and were considered not related to BRV by the Investigator. Five of the TEAEs of 
suicidal  ideation  started  the  same  day  (±1  day)  the  Columbia-Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale 
assessment  was  performed,  which  could  suggest  that  the  assessment  contributed  to  the 
identification and the reporting of these events. No subject completed suicide. 
The  overall  incidence  on  suicidality  in  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies 
was  4.7%  while  it  was  3.2%  in  the  Pool  S4.  The  exposure-adjusted  incidence  in  the  ≥4  to  <16 
years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies was 2.86% [1.15 - 5.90] versus 1.02% [0.8 – 1.27] in 
Pool S4 (Table 36.  and Table 37. ).

Table 37.  Paediatric subjects reporting TEAEs potentially associated with suicidality 
One event of suicidal ideation was considered related to study drug by the Investigator: 
Subject  N01266-113-07601,  a  13-year-old  white  female,  experienced  an  event  of  depression,  66 
days  after  the  first  study  drug  dose.  The  event  was  considered  mild  in  intensity  and  related  to 
study drug by the Investigator. The subject experienced an event of suicidal ideation, 4 days after 
the onset of depression. The event occurred 70 days after the first study drug dose in N01266. The 
event was considered mild in intensity and related to study drug by the Investigator. The subject 
received venlafaxine hydrochloride and escitalopram oxalate as treatment for the suicidal ideation. 
The  subject  experienced  an  event  of  suicide  attempt  during  the  Post-Treatment  Period,  18  days 
after  the  onset of  suicidal  ideation.  The  event  occurred  88  days  after the  first  study  drug  dose  in

N01266.  The  event  was  considered  moderate  in  intensity  and  not  related  to  study  drug  by  the 
Investigator. At the time of the suicide attempt, the subject was not taking the study drug and had 
been off study drug for 10 days. 
Treatment-emergent AEs potentially associated with behavior disorders 
In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  TEAEs  potentially  associated  with 
behavioral  disorders  were  reported  in  36  subjects  (24.2%);  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs 
were irritability (10.1%), and aggression and psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7% each). The events 
were reported most frequently during the first 3 months of treatment. 
Of  the  15  subjects  reporting  irritability,  the  events  were  mild  in  intensity  in  14  subjects  and 
moderate  in  1  subject.  None  of  the  events  of  irritability  were  serious  and  none  led  to 
discontinuation  of  BRV.  In  1  subject,  the  BRV  dose was  decreased,  while  in  all  other  subjects  the 
BRV  dose  was  unchanged.  In  6  of  the  15  subjects,  irritability  was  considered drug-related  by  the 
investigator. 
Among  7  subjects  for  whom  aggression  was  reported,  most  cases  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
intensity. One subject had aggression reported as severe. This event was the 1 case of aggression 
(0.7%) reported as an SAE (N01266-103-07511). The event was considered not related to BRV by 
the  investigator  and  led  to  discontinuation  of  BRV.  In  total,  3  subjects  (2.0%)  discontinued  BRV 
due  to  the  TEAE  of  aggression.  In  4  of the  7  subjects,  the  investigator  considered  the  aggression 
drug-related. 
In  the  7  subjects  with  psychomotor  hyperactivity,  all  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity. 
None  of  the  events  was  serious.  One  subject  (0.7%)  discontinued  BRV  because  of  psychomotor 
hyperactivity. None of the other events of psychomotor hyperactivity led to a change in BRV dose. 
In 4 of the 7 subjects, the investigator considered psychomotor hyperactivity drug-related. 
The  exposure-adjusted  incidence  rates  (IRs)  (95%  CI)  for  TEAEs  potentially  associated  with 
behavioral  disorders  were  higher  in  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies 
compared  with  Pool  S4  (17.78  [12.45,  24.61]  and  5.22  [4.70,  5.78]  per  100  subject-years), 
respectively. 
In  addition  to the  analysis  of  TEAEs  potentially  associated  with  behavioral  disorders,  the  effect  of 
BRV on behavior and cognition was assessed using the age-appropriate Achenbach Child Behavior 
Checklist  (CBCL)  and  Behavior  Rating  Inventory  of  Executive  Function  (BRIEF)/Behavior  Rating 
Inventory of Executive Function®-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P). 
In summary, behavioral disorders were reported more frequently in the ≥4 to 16 years POS group 
in Pool Paediatric Studies compared with the established BRV safety profile in adults. 
The  initially  assessed  interim  results  of  the  Achenbach  CBCL/1½-5  and  CBCL/6-18  and 
BRIEF/BRIEF-P  questionnaires  showed  small  improvements  (decreases)  from  baseline  for  most 
subscale  scores  and  large  variability.  Following  the  request  of  further  clarification  regarding  the 
interpretation of the outcomes from the scales adopted by the MAH, the listings provided resulted 
heavily  biased  by  the  low  numbers  and  by  a  remarkable  heterogeneity  of  the scores gathered by 
the  parents  among  visits.  They  seemed  to  coherently  show  highly  statistically  significant 
differences (LSM estimates) at the MMRM analysis for the following scales and domains: 
-Achenbach  P  (CBCL  11/2-5):  The  majority  of  subscales  showed  statistically  unsignificant  results 
from  Baseline  (e.g.,  Anxious/Depressed;  Attention  problems;  Emotionally  reactive;  Sleep

problems; Withdrawn). Few statistically significant differences were found late in the study only for 
the subscale Somatic complaints (p=0.019 at Visit 13 and p=0.0002 at Visit 15). 
-CBCL 6-18 scale: With the exception of the subscale/syndrome Withdrawn/Depressed for which no 
significant  changes  were  reported,  all  the  following  subscales  were  statistically  significant: 
aggressive  behavior  (p<0.003  from  Visit 7  through Visit  15);  anxious/depressed  (p  value  ranging 
from 0.0033 at Visit 3 to 0.02 at Visit 15; Attention problems (p ranging from 0.0014 at Visit 3 to 
<.0001  at  Visit  15);  Rule-breaking  behavior  (p  ranging  from  p=0.004  at  Visit  7  to  0.027  at  Visit 
15);  Social  problems  (p  ranging  from  p=0.0024  at  Visit  3  to  p=0.0015  at  Visit  15);  Somatic 
complaints  (p<0.0001  from  Visit  3  through  Visit  15,  with  the  exception  of  p=.0003  at  Visit  5); 
Thought problems (p=0.0031 at Visit 3 through p=0.0032 at Visit 15.  
-BRIEF  scale:  The  majority  of  subscales  did  not  show  statistically  unequivocal  results  from 
Baseline,  particularly  regarding  the  domains  Behavioral  Regulation,  Metacognition,  GEC,  Shift, 
Emotional  Control,  Initiate,  Plan/Organize,  Monitor.  On  the  other  hand,  the  following  domains 
showed  more  consistently  statistically  significant  differences  from  Baseline:  Inhibit  (p=0.009  at 
Visit  7,  p=0006  at  Visit  11  and  p=0.02  at  Visits  13  and  15),  Working  memory  (p  value  ranging 
from 0.0195 at Visit 3 to 0.0012 at Visit 11), Organization of Materials (p ranging from 0.04 at Visit 
5 to 0.0055 at Visit 13). 
Further  information  about  the  outcome/reversibility  of  the  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  in 
particular those in the SOC of Nervous System Disorders and Psychiatric Disorders, was required to 
the  MAH.  The  MAH  provided  additional  and  updated  (120-Day  Safety  Update  (120DSU)  Report; 
data  lock  point  15  Mar  2017)  information  on  the  outcome/reversibility  of  the  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation,  with  special  attention  to  those  occurred  in  the  SOC  of  Nervous  System  disorders 
and Psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the MAH further investigated the increased risks of suicidality 
and behavioral disorders in the pediatric population in two SSARs and neither of these signals was 
confirmed.  
In the updated Pool Pediatric Studies up to 15 Mar 2017, 2 additional subjects had AEs leading to 
permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug  due  to  astrocytoma  (low  grade)  and  pregnancy.  Overall 
37  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  were  reported  in  27  (12.3%)  subjects,  more 
frequently in the SOCs of Psychiatric disorders (4.1%) and Nervous System disorders (3.2%). The 
most  common  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  were  aggression  and  suicidal  ideation 
(1.4%  each)  (particularly  in  the  ≥12  to  <16  years  group),  and  convulsion  decreased  appetite, 
pneumonia, and circulatory collapse (0.9% each).  
Most  these  events  (21  AEs  in  16  subjects)  resolved.  In  the  updated  data,  no  additional  fatal 
outcome  was  reported  other  than  the  4  cases  (aspiration  [aspiration/acute  respiratory 
failure/circulatory collapse], septic shock/pneumonia, pneumonia, and circulatory collapse) already 
reported  in  the  previous  assessment  report.  None  of  these  fatal  cases  was  considered  related  to 
BRV.  One  AE  was  reported  as  resolving,  2  as  resolved  with  sequelae  and 6 AEs  not  resolved  in 5 
subjects  (4  in  study  N01266  and  1  in  study  N01263):  limited  information  could  be  obtained  on 
these patients because they were lost to follow-up or had withdrawn consent.  
In  the  SOC  of  Psychiatric  disorders:  3/10  events  (Aggression,  Depression,  and  Suicidal  ideation) 
were  not  resolved;  2/10  events  (Abnormal  behavior  and  Aggression)  resolved  with  sequelae 
(worsening  of  Abnormal  behavior  and  Aggression  that  remained  stable).  The  average  duration  of 
these AEs was <1 month. 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 83/112 
 
  
  
 
As  regard  to  the  AEs  in  the  SOC  of  Nervous  System  disorders,  all  of  them  resolved  and  their 
average duration was <2 months.  
In  the  SSARs  on  suicidality,  that  include  comprehensive  review  of  the  available  data  from  clinical 
studies,  published  literature  and  spontaneous  postmarketing  reports,  due  to  the  several 
methodological  limitations,  an  increased  risk  of  suicidality  in  the  pediatric  population  treated  with 
BRV beyond what is already documented in the SmPC could not be established.   
In  conclusion,  most  AEs  leading  to  study  drug discontinuation  resolved  without  sequelae,  most of 
these  occurred  as  per  the  PTs  in  the  SOC  of  Psychiatric  disorders  and  Nervous  System  disorders 
that  are  already  reported  as  ADRs  in  section  4.8  of  the  current  BRV  SmPC.  However,  due  to  the 
several methodological limitations of pediatric studies, these AEs should continue to be monitored 
through pharmacovigilance activities.

In Pool Paediatric Studies, TEAEs of interest for the paediatric population were reported most 
frequently in BRV Overall in the following categories: neurodevelopment (16 subjects [7.3%]), 
cognitive impairment (13 subjects [5.9%]), and endocrine function or sexual maturation (10 
subjects [4.6%]). No TEAEs were reported in the category of growth (Table 39. ).

Table 39.  TEAEs potentially associated with growth, endocrine function or sexual maturation, 
neurodevelopment, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression in subjects ≥4 to <16 years 
with POS in Pool Paediatric Studies 
In the neurodevelopment category, 1 subject (0.7%) discontinued study drug due to the TEAE of 
psychomotor hyperactivity. In the depression category, 1 subject (0.7%) had a treatment-
emergent SAE of depression, and 1 subject (0.7%) discontinued study drug due to the TEAE of 
depression. No other TEAEs of interest specific to the paediatric population were treatment-
emergent SAEs or resulted in discontinuation of study drug.

In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, the incidence of TEAEs potentially 
associated with neurodevelopment was highest during Months 1 to 3 (7 subjects [4.7%]), and was 
lower at all subsequent safety time intervals (0% to 1.7%). For TEAEs potentially associated with 
cognitive impairment, the incidence was highest during Months 1 to 3 (7 subjects [4.7%]), and 
was lower at all other safety time intervals (0% to 1.9%). 
TEAEs potentially associated with falls (Pool Paediatric Studies) 
In Pool Paediatric Studies, TEAEs potentially associated with falls were reported in 41 subjects 
(18.7%) in BRV Overall; the most frequently reported TEAE was fall (7.8%). 
Treatment-emergent AEs potentially associated with falls in BRV Overall were reported in 
27  subjects  (18.1%)  in  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  the  most 
frequently reported TEAE in BRV Overall was fall (8.1%). Clavicle fracture and forearm fracture (1 
subject  each  [0.7%])  were  reported  as  treatment-emergent  SAEs.  None  of  the  TEAEs  potentially 
associated with falls resulted in discontinuation of study drug.  
In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  potentially 
associated with falls was highest during Months 1 to 3 (11 subjects [7.4%]) and was lower during 
Months 4 to 24 (range: 0.9% to 6.3%); no falls were reported after Month 24 through Month 63. 
In Pool Paediatric Studies, TEAEs potentially associated with falls and concurrent Type 1B or 
Type 1C seizures were reported in 13 subjects (5.9%) in BRV Overall; the most frequently reported 
TEAE was fall (3.2%). 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  potentially  associated  with  falls  with  concurrent  Type  1B  or  Type  1C 
seizures in BRV Overall were reported in 9 subjects (6.0%) in the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in 
Pool Paediatric Studies (Table 40. ). In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies, 
TEAEs  potentially  associated  with  falls  without  concurrent  Type  1B  or  Type  1C  seizures  were 
reported in 20 subjects (13.4%) in BRV Overall; the most frequently reported TEAE was fall (6.0%) 
(Table 41. ).

In Pool Paediatric Studies, TEAEs potentially associated with accidents and injuries were reported in 
42 subjects (19.2%) in BRV Overall; the most frequently reported TEAE was fall (7.8%). 
In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  TEAEs  potentially  associated  with 
accidents  and  injuries  in  BRV  Overall  were  reported  in  31  subjects  (20.8%);  the  most  frequently 
reported  TEAE  was  fall  (8.1%).  Hypothermia,  clavicle  fracture,  and  forearm  fracture  (1  subject 
each  [0.7%])  were  reported  as  a  treatment-emergent  SAEs.  None  of  the  TEAEs  potentially 
associated with accidents and injuries resulted in discontinuation of study Drug. 
In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  potentially 
associated with accidents and injuries was highest during Months 1 to 3 (12 subjects [8.1%]), was 
lower during Months 4 to 24 (range: 1.9% to 6.3%); no accidents or injuries were reported after 
Month 24 through Month 63. 
In Pool Paediatric Studies, TEAEs potentially associated with accidents and injuries and concurrent 
Type  1B  or  Type  1C  seizures  were  reported  in  17  subjects  (7.8%);  the  most  frequently  reported 
TEAE was fall (3.2%). 
In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  TEAEs  potentially  associated  with 
accidents and injuries and concurrent Type 1B or Type 1C seizures in BRV Overall were reported in 
13 subjects (8.7%); the most frequently reported TEAE was fall (3.4%). In Pool Paediatric Studies, 
TEAEs  potentially  associated  with  accidents  and  injuries  without  concurrent  Type  1B  or  Type  1C 
seizures were reported in 30 subjects (13.7%) in BRV Overall; the most frequently reported TEAE 
was fall (5.5%).  
In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  TEAEs  potentially  associated  with 
accidents and injuries without concurrent Type 1B or Type 1C seizures were reported in 21 subjects 
(14.1%) in BRV Overall; the most frequently reported TEAE was fall (6.0%). 
TEAEs potentially associated with psychosis (Pool Paediatric Studies) 
In Pool Paediatric Studies, TEAEs potentially associated with psychosis were reported in 3 subjects 
(1.4%)  in  BRV  Overall;  the  reported  TEAEs  were  hallucination  (2  subjects  [0.9%])  and 
hallucination, visual (1 subject [0.5%]). 
In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool Paediatric   Studies,  TEAEs  potentially  associated  with 
psychosis in BRV Overall were reported in 2 subjects (1.3%); the reported TEAE was hallucination. 
The TEAE of hallucination was not a treatment-emergent SAE and did not result in discontinuation 
of study drug.  
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
Overall exposure: In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Pediatric Studies, exposure to BRV in 
BRV  Overall  was  higher  for  male  subjects  (84  subjects  with  146.1  subject-years  of  exposure) 
compared with female subjects (65 subjects with 103.6 subject-years of exposure). 
Subject disposition: In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group, 23 male subjects (27.4%) and 27 female 
subjects  (41.5%)  discontinued  prematurely  from  the  study.  The  most  frequently  reported  reason 
for discontinuation for male subjects was lack of efficacy (10.7%), and for female subjects was lack 
of efficacy, AE, and subject choice (10.8% each).

Common TEAEs: In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Pediatric Studies, the most frequently 
reported  common  TEAEs  in  BRV  Overall  were  nasopharyngitis  (24.2%);  pharyngitis  (20.1%); 
pyrexia, convulsion, and headache (17.4%); and vomiting (14.8%) (Section 6.2.1). The incidences 
of these most frequently reported common TEAEs in male and female subjects are as follows: 
- Nasopharyngitis: Male subjects (21.4%) and female subjects (27.7%) 
- Pharyngitis: Male subjects (19.0%) and female subjects (21.5%) 
- Pyrexia: Male subjects (16.7%) and female subjects (18.5%) 
- Convulsion: Male subjects (19.0%) and female subjects (15.4%) 
- Headache: Male subjects (9.5%) and female subjects (27.7%) 
- Vomiting: Male subjects (17.9%) and female subjects (10.8%) 
In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Pediatric Studies, in general, the incidences of the most 
frequently reported common TEAEs in BRV Overall were similar in male and female subjects. Male 
subjects,  compared  with  female  subjects,  reported  higher  incidences  of  vomiting  (17.9%  vs 
10.8%);  fatigue  (7.1%  vs  3.1%);  psychomotor  hyperactivity  (7.1%  vs  1.5%);  varicella  (7.1%  vs 
0%); sinusitis (6.0% vs 0%); constipation (6.0% vs 1.5%); aggression (6.0% vs 3.1%); and head 
injury (4.8% vs 0%). Male subjects, compared with female subjects, reported lower incidences of 
dental caries and abnormal behaviour (0% vs 4.6% each); suicidal ideation (1.2% vs 9.2%); sleep 
disorder  (1.2%  vs  4.6%);  rhinitis  allergic  (2.4%  vs 9.2%);  insomnia  (3.6%  vs  6.2%);  abdominal 
pain  and  gastroenteritis  (4.8%  vs  10.8%  each);  abdominal  pain  upper  (4.8%  vs  7.7%);  and 
headache (9.5% vs 27.7%). 
The  differences  observed  in  the  frequencies  of  some  of  common  treatment  emergent  adverse 
events  (TEAEs)  between  males  and  females,  particularly  those  related  to  the  system  organ  class 
(SOC)  Nervous  System  Disorders  and  the  SOC  Psychiatric  Disorders,  were  of  concern.  However, 
due  to  the  small  numbers  and  the  lack  of  a  control  group,  it  is  not  possible  to  conclude  on  the 
significance of differences observed for some AEs between males and females. The requested data 
provided by the MAH were particularly reassuring regarding the sex-differences for some important 
AEs  in  the  SOC  of  Nervous  System  disorders  and  Psychiatric  disorders  that  appear  to  be  unlikely 
related to BRV treatment but rather to the sex differences in the background population reported in 
literature. 
Hematology: In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Pediatric Studies, in both male and female 
subjects,  there  were  no  clinically  meaningful  mean  changes  from  Baseline  over  time  to  the  Last 
Value  in  BRV  Overall  for  any  hematology  parameter.  In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool 
Pediatric  Studies,  most  subjects  had  normal  values  at  both  Baseline  and  Last  Value  for  all 
hematology  parameters.  The  incidence  of  shifts  from  normal  at  Baseline  to  low  or  high  at  Last 
Value  was  similar  in  male  and  female  subjects  for  all  hematology  parameters.  In  the  ≥4  to  <16 
years  POS  group  in  Pool  Pediatric  Studies,  the  incidence  of  PCST  hematology  results  at  any  time 
point  was  low  and  was  similar  in  male  and  female  subjects  for  all  hematology  parameters;  there 
were no trends over time. 
Clinical  chemistry:  In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Pediatric  Studies,  in  both  male  and 
female subjects, there were no clinically meaningful mean changes from Baseline over time to the 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018

Last Value in BRV Overall for any clinical chemistry parameter. In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group 
in Pool Pediatric Studies, most subjects had normal values at both Baseline and Last Value for all 
clinical chemistry parameters. The incidence of shifts from normal at Baseline to low or high at Last 
Value was similar in male and female subjects for almost all clinical chemistry parameters. In male 
subjects,  compared  with  female  subjects,  there  was  a  lower  incidence  of  shifts  from  normal  at 
Baseline to high at Last Value for GGT (6.0% vs 15.4%), and there was a higher incidence of shifts 
from normal at Baseline to high at Last Value for creatinine (8.3% vs 0%).  
In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in Pool  Pediatric  Studies,  the  incidence  of  PCST  clinical 
chemistry  results  at  any  time  point  was  low  and  was  similar  in  male  and  female  subjects  for  all 
clinical chemistry parameters; there were no trends over time. 
Urinalysis:  In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Pediatric  Studies,  the  incidence  of  PCST 
urinalysis results at any time point was low and was similar in male and female subjects for almost 
all urinalysis parameters; there were no trends over time. In male subjects, compared with female 
subjects,  there  were  lower  incidences  of  PCST  results  at  any  time  point  for  occult  blood  (0%  vs 
17.9%) and leukocyte esterase (2.5% vs 17.9%). 
Endocrinology: In the ≥4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Pediatric Studies, the results were similar 
in male and female subjects; there were no clinically meaningful mean changes from Baseline over 
time to the  Last  Value  in BRV  Overall  for  T3  free,  T4  free,  and  thyrotropin;  there  were  no  trends 
over  time.  The  small  number  of  female  subjects  (N=0  or  1)  with  results  for  follicle  stimulating 
hormone and luteinizing hormone at most time points does not allow for meaningful comparisons. 
Vital  signs:  In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Pediatric  Studies,  there  were  gender 
differences  in  the  mean  changes  from  Baseline  in  pulse  rate;  in  male  subjects  the  changes  from 
Baseline were negative at almost all time points (during the first 24 months, when sample size is 
meaningful, range: -0.5 to -6.0bpm), while in female subjects the changes from Baseline tended to 
be positive (range: -0.6 to 4.6bpm). This gender difference did not raise clinical concern.  In both 
male  and  female  subjects  there  were  no  clinically  meaningful  mean  changes  from  Baseline  over 
time to the Last Value in BRV Overall for any vital sign parameter. The incidence of PCST vital sign 
results  at  any  time  point  was  similar  in  male  and  female  subjects  for  all  vital  sign  parameters; 
there were no trends over time.

2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  data  set  presented  in  support  of  the  current  group  of  variations  (II-10  G)  is  mainly 
based  on  an  ad  hoc  pediatric  Pool  which  included  clinical  safety  data  from  all  pediatric  subjects 
enrolled  in  the  completed  Phase  2a  study  N01263  (an  open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter, 
pharmacokinetic,  safety,  and  efficacy  study  of  adjunctive  administration  of  brivaracetam  in 
subjects  from  ≥ 1  month  to  <16  years  old  with  epilepsy)  and  its  ongoing  Phase  3  LTFU  N01266 
(open-label,  single-arm,  multicenter,  long-term  study  to  evaluate  safety  and  efficacy  of 
brivaracetam  used  as  adjunctive  treatment  in  pediatric  subjects  with  epilepsy),  amended  also  to 
include (as direct enrollers) a relevant quote of subjects (at least 100) with a clinical diagnosis of 
partial  onset  seizures  (POS).  The  clinical  cut-off  date  for  the  current  application  is  31  Aug  2016. 
The responses to request for supplementary information included also safety data from the US 120 
Day safety update for which the cut-off date is 15 March 2017. 
A total of 149 subjects were 4 to 16 years old with 249.7 subject-years of exposure. Of them, 34 
(22.8%) followed-up the parent study N01263, and 115 (77.2%) were directly enrolled into study 
N01266.  A  total  of  104  subjects  (69.8%)  had  ≥1  calendar  year  of  exposure  to  brivaracetam,  97 
subjects (65.1%) were ongoing and 50 subjects (33.6%) discontinued. Thus, the size of the safety 
database for this application is considered compliant to the current CHMP guideline for epilepsy. 
With  regards  to  the  modal  daily  dose  for  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  group  with  POS,  the  highest 
proportion  was  in  the  >3.0  to  4.0mg/kg/day  overall  (n=79  [53%])  with  151.0  subject-years, 
followed  by  the  >4.0mg/kg/day  (n=26  [17.4%])  with  43.6  subject-years  exposure.  As  per  those 
subjects with at least ≥12 months exposure to BRV, the highest proportion was again in the >3.0 
to  4.0mg/kg/day  modal  daily  dose  (58  subjects  [55.8%]),  followed  by  the  >4.0mg/kg/day  group 
overall (n=22 [21.2%]). These data comply with the CHMP requirements for  assessing the safety 
profile of brivaracetam as adjunctive therapy in subjects with POS down to 4 years of age. 
In  the  ≥ 4  to  <16  years  POS  group  in  Pool  Paediatric  Studies,  the  most  frequently  reported 
common  TEAEs  were  nasopharyngitis  (24.2%  of  subjects);  pharyngitis  (20.1%);  pyrexia, 
convulsion,  and  headache  (17.4%);  and  vomiting  (14.8%).  The  majority  of  adverse  events  was 
reported  as  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity  and  non-serious,  and  did  not  lead  to  dose  reduction  or 
discontinuation  of  study  drug.  Higher  incidences  for  nasopharyngitis,  pharyngitis,  pyrexia, 
vomiting,  decreased  appetite  and  psychomotor  hyperactivity  were  reported  in  the  paediatric 
population compared with adult Pool S4, while incidences of convulsion and headache were similar. 
The MAH presented analysis of the TEAEs in children divided to different age groups (4 to <12 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 94/112 
 
  
  
 
12 to <16 years) and compared to the pool S4. In general, it is agreed that the reporting of TEAE 
was similar between both children groups and adult population.  
The  MAH  reported  that  higher  incidence  of  vomiting  (21.3%  vs  0),  diarrhea  (13.9%  vs  7.3%), 
Pyrexia  (24.1%  vs  9.8%),  Irritability  (13.0%  vs  4.9%),  Pharyngitis  (26.9%  vs  9.8%),  Rhinitis 
(11.1%  vs  2.4%)  and  Varicella  (5.6%  vs  0)  in  children  with  the  POS  ≥4-<12  years  compared  to 
POS  ≥12-<16  years  group.  It  could  be  considered  that  Pyrexia,  Pharyngitis  and  Rhinitis  are 
common AEs observed in this children age group and could be difficult to establish direct causality 
to Briviact treatment. On the other hand, the ADRs of vomiting and irritability are already present 
in the Table of ADRs in section 4.8.  
A  higher  TEAEs  incidence  of  falls  (3.7%  vs  19.5%),  Dysmenorrhea  (1.9%  vs  7.3%)  and 
Gynaecomastia (0 vs 4.9%) were reported in the POS ≥12-<16 years group than in the POS ≥4-
<12  years  group  and  adults.  However,  the  explanation  provided  by  the  MAH  that considering the 
small  number  of  patients  in  the  BRV  POS  ≥12-<16  years  group  (dysmenorrhea  n=3; 
gynaecomastia  n=2)  and  the  prevalence  reported  in  the  literature,  the  findings  from  the  BRV 
Pediatric Pools do not differ from the global pediatric population is acceptable. 
The incidence of TEAE “weight decrease” was relatively high in the ≥ 4 to <16 years POS group 
in  the  Pool  Pediatric  Studies.  It  is  reassuring  that  none  of  the  TEAEs  “weight  decrease”  led  to 
permanent  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  It  was  apparent  that  a  relationship  between  weight 
decrease and decreased appetite, that is a known ADR of BRV treatment, cannot be established in 
POS  patients  aged  ≥ 4  to  <16  years.  Moreover,  weight  decrease  occurred  in  a  minority  of  these 
patients  and  can  be  considered  plausibly  related  to  the  severity  of  the  underlying  disease  or  to 
concomitant TEAEs. In most cases the event recovered and in no patient it lead to BRV treatment 
discontinuation. This was considered reassuring. 
In  addition,  there  are  higher  incidences  of  PTs  Headache  (26.8%),  Fatigue  (9.8%),  Dizziness 
(17.1%)  and  Suicidal  ideation  (9.8%)  in  POS  ≥12-<16  years  group.  It  is  noted  that  ADRs  of 
Headache,  Fatigue  and  Dizziness  were  also  the  most  common  ADRs  reported  in  adults  (Pool  S1 
9.6%,  7.7%  and  10.7%  respectively).  However,  frequency  of  suicidality  is  substantially  higher  in 
children,  especially  teenagers,  compared  to  the  one reported  for  adults  in  the  currently  approved 
SmPC  (0.3%  in  brivaracetam  treated  patients).  The  higher  incidence  observed  in  children  is 
appropriately  reflected  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  No  new  safety  signals  were  identified  in  the 
studied paediatric population except psychomotor hyperactivity. Dose-relation was not observed in 
paediatric population for somnolence and dizziness as reported in the adult population. This may be 
explained by the fact that the paediatric population is quite wide in age range and hence positive or 
negative trends may not be observed clearly also due to flexible dosing schedule without unbiased 
dose comparison and by the relative small sample size of paediatric study population which doesn’t 
allow drawing definitive conclusions.  
The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  in  the  SOC  Nervous  system  disorders  (17  subjects 
[11.4%]) and the most frequently reported PTs in BRV Overall were convulsion (9 subjects [6.0%]) 
and  status  epilepticus  (5  subjects  [3.4%]).  The  TEAEs  of  interest  specific  to  the  paediatric 
population 
(growth,  endocrine 
function/sexual  maturation,  neurodevelopment,  cognitive 
impairment,  anxiety  and  depression)  were 
reported 
the  mostly 
in 
the  category  of 
neurodevelopment  (6.7%),  cognitive  impairment  (6%)  and  endocrine  function  or  sexual

maturation (4.7%) in the ≥ 4 to <16 years POS group and were similar to what has been reported 
in paediatric populations with other AEDs. On the other hand, the available data concerning long-
term consequences of brivaracetam treatment is limited and these should be evaluated in a larger 
population with longer exposure duration. Relevant data that is expected to be collected in the on-
going study N01266. 
The exposure-adjusted (100 subject-years) IR of the most frequent TEAEs of interest were in the 
categories behavioural disorder (24.2%; IR=17.78), seizure worsening (21.5%; IR=14.91), 
accidents and injuries (20.8%; IR=14.59), falls (18.1%; IR=12.40) and neurodevelopment (6.7%; 
IR=4.26).  
The higher incidence of adverse events within the behavioral disorders can be expected in this age 
group in general and is reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
In relation to accidents/injuries, in the updated data (cutoff date (15 Mar 2017), there were 4 
additional subjects in the ≥4 to <16 age group reporting at least 1 of these AE that were mild to 
moderate, did not lead to BRV dose changes or discontinuation, and were not considered related to 
BRV treatment by the investigators. The same additional 4 subjects resulted when the PT falls was 
used in the searching strategy. For comparison purposes, the MAH provided also data on adult 
patients from the Pool Monotherapy, a safety pool for subjects ≥16 years of age enrolled in 
conversion to monotherapy studies with a sample size (N=150) smaller than that of the Pool S4 
but comparable to that of the POS ≥4 to <16 year group (N=149). The MAH pointed out that the 
adjusted-incidence rates in the pediatric groups are in between Pool S4 and the Pool Monotherapy 
and hence that BRV appears not to have a specific effect on the paediatric population. Limitations 
of pediatric studies do not allow drawing definitive conclusions on accident/injuries or fall-related 
AEs, however, given the above, based on the comparison with the Monotherapy Pool data 
presented by the MAH, the CHMP considers that it is plausible to conclude that there is no 
increased risk of falls and accidents/injury in the pediatric population treated with BRV. 
Concerning the TEAEs potentially associated with seizure worsening, higher exposure-adjusted IRs 
(95% CI) were reported in the ≥ 4 to <16 years POS group in Pool Paediatric Studies compared 
with adults Pool S4 (14.91 [10.20, 21.06] versus 6.01 [5.45, 6.62] per 100 subject-years). This 
more than doubled incidence in children is attributed by the applicant to the underlying disease and 
associated comorbidities in patients with difficult to treat childhood-onset epilepsies.  The Applicant 
provided a review of the (few) available data regarding TEAEs potentially associated with seizure 
worsening in pediatric studies with brivaracetam N01263 and N01266 (Pool Pediatric Studies) as of 
the cut-off date 15 March 2017. The conclusion that the distribution of focal or generalized 
epilepsies was generally similar in patients for whom TEAEs potentially associated with seizure 
worsening were or were not reported, with a slightly higher frequency of epilepsies of 
undetermined origin in the former group, is acknowledged by the CHMP. 
With respect to TEAEs potentially associated with seizure worsening, at least one event was 
reported in the ≥4 of <16 years age range for 43/149 (28.9%) subjects with POS and for 29/51 
(34.5%) in non-POS subjects. Apparently, the onset of TEAEs potentially associated with seizure 
worsening was slightly higher in the first 3-month interval. 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 96/112 
 
  
  
Regarding the effect of BRV on seizure frequency in patients with POS in the 4 to 16 years age 
range, no definitive conclusion can be drawn as only interim data are available and significant 
decrease in the number of patients, particularly beyond Visit 12 (month 24) was observed mainly 
due to premature discontinuation and the variable time of follow up depending on study entry. 
A larger amount of EEG data was expected than those presented with the current application. 
However, it seems difficult at the present stage to get further data during the present procedure. 
Additional data is expected to be collected and made available in the final CSR of study N01266. 
In  the  ≥4  to  <16  years  POS  group,  the  most  frequently  observed  AEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation  were  in  the  SOC  Psychiatric  disorders  (6  subjects  [4.0%]  and  Nervous  system 
disorders  SOC  (3  subjects  [2.0%]),  with  the  most  frequently  reported  PT  being  aggression  (3 
subjects  [2.0%]),  with  a  bimodal  distribution  for  the  vast  majority  of  AEs  being  in  the  0.0  to  1.0 
and  >3.0  to  4.0  modal  daily  dose  categories.  Most  AEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation 
resolved  without  sequelae,  most  of  these  occurred  as  per  the  PTs  in  the  SOC  of  Psychiatric 
disorders  and  Nervous  System  disorders  that  are  already  reported  as  ADRs  in  section  4.8  of  the 
current  BRV  SmPC.  However,  due  to  the  several  methodological  limitations  of  pediatric  studies, 
these AEs should continue to be monitored through pharmacovigilance activities.   
A higher overall incidence of TEAEs potentially associated with suicidality was reported in paediatric 
population compared to the adult Pool S4 with an exposure-adjusted incidence of 2.86% (95% CI; 
1.15 - 5.90) in the ≥ 4 to <16 years POS group compared to 1.02% (0.8 – 1.27) in adult Pool S4. 
Seven  subjects  (7.4%)  were  in  the  ≥4  to  <16y  POS  group  and  all  events  were  in  the  SOC 
Psychiatric  disorders,  with  PT  suicidal  ideation  (n=7  [4.7%])  and  suicidal  attempt  (n=1  [0.7%]) 
being  the  most  frequent.  The  events  mostly  occurred  in  the  dose  range  of  BRV  150-200mg/day, 
showed variability either in duration or delay of onset from the subject’s study entry and in some 
cases  the  onset  was  further  to  the  suspension  of  the  study  drug.  However,  only  one  of  the 
suicidality  cases  was  judged  to  be  related to  brivaracetam  treatment  by the  investigator.  Definite 
conclusions  on  suicidal  ideation  in  the  pediatric  population  cannot  be  drawn  due  to  several 
limitations of the pediatric studies presented by the MAH, including the lack of a control group, the 
small  numbers,  the  open-label  design  which  makes  the  drug  relationship  assessed  by  the 
investigators,  the  limitations  of  the  tools  used  for  the  evaluation  of  psychiatric  disorder  related 
event. Moreover, the presence of several confounding factors should be taken into account, such as 
the  potential  effects  of  concomitant  medications,  including  AEs,  and  concomitant  medical  and 
psychiatric conditions. However, it appears that the incidence of suicidality in the pediatric studies 
with  BRV  is  higher  than  that  observed  in  the  adult  population  of  Pool  S4,  particularly  in  the  age 
category of ≥12 to <16 years, even after exposure-adjusted analysis. It is acknowledged that this 
can  confirm  literature  data,  but  indirect  comparison  with  available  clinical  data  from  other  AEDs 
(lacosamide,  levetiracetam  and  perampanel),  seems  to  indicate  a  possibly  higher  incidence  of 
suicidal ideation in BRV pediatric studies, although differences in studied-population, exposure and 
study design should be taken into account.  
Large  variation  but  no  apparent  worsening  has  been  reported  according  to the  interim  results  for 
cognition-related  scales  (Achenbach  and  BRIEF/BRIEF-P).  Overall,  data  presented by  the  MAH  did 
not  show  a  trend  towards  a  worsening  of  the  responses  to  the  adopted  neurodevelopment  and 
cognition scales. This is reassuring. However, due to the limitations of paediatric studies, including 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 97/112 
 
  
  
the lack of a control group, the limited numbers, the open-label design, the limitations of the scales 
adopted,  no  definite  conclusion  can  be  drawn  on  the  actual  effects  of  BRV  on  cognition  and 
neurodevelopment  in  POS  paediatric  patients.  The  MAH  should  continue  to  strictly  monitor  the 
occurrence of AEs related to cognition and neurodevelopment through pharmacovigilance activity. 
Unexpectedly, in the ≥4 to <16 years POS patients of the Pool Pediatric Studies, some differences 
by gender were observed. The MAH explained these differences as mostly related to the differences 
in the background population reported in literature in terms of slightly lower incidence of epilepsy 
and  unprovoked  seizures  in  females  than  males.  Males  would  tend  to  have  a  higher  incidence  of 
lesional  epilepsy  and  acute  symptomatic  seizures  while  females  would  be  more  likely  to  have 
idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Moreover, the behavior of some common epilepsy syndromes such 
as mesial temporal sclerosis may differ between genders with isolated auras more common among 
females  and  secondary  seizure  spread  more  likely  in  males.  The  MAH  pointed  out  that  literature 
data report a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation in female adolescents than male.  
Due  to  the  small  numbers  and  the  lack  of  a  control  group,  it  is  not  possible  to  conclude  on  the 
significance  of  differences  observed  for  some  AEs  between  males  and  females.  Data  provided  by 
the  MAH  are  particularly  reassuring  regarding  the  sex-differences  for  some  important  AEs  in  the 
SOC  of  Nervous  System  disorders  and  Psychiatric  disorders  that  appear  to  be  unlikely  related  to 
BRV  treatment  but  rather  to  the  sex  differences  in  the  background  population  reported  in 
literature. Finally, changes from Baseline of pulse rate were more frequently negative (decrease) in 
males and positive (increase) in females. However, it is reassuring that the incidence of PCST vital 
sign results was similar between the two sexes.  
In the paediatric population of interest for this extension of indication, there were differences in the 
incidence of common TEAEs between AED inducer subjects and No AED inducer subjects. This is of 
particular  concern  mainly  for  Nervous  System  and  Psychiatric  Disorders  which  occurred  more 
frequently  in  AED  inducer  subjects:  headache  (23.1%  vs  11.3%);  convulsion  (19.2%  vs  15.5%); 
somnolence (11.5% vs 9.9%); dizziness (10.3% vs 1.4%); syncope (2.6% vs 0); suicidal ideation 
(5 subjects, 6.4% vs 2 subjects, 2.8%); sleep disorders (3.8% vs 1.4%); aggression (2.6% vs 0). 
The  majority  of  patients  was  under  carboxamide  derivatives  (47.2%  of  patients  in  ≥4-<12  years 
group,  and  by  39%  of  patients  in  ≥12-<16  years  group)  and  most  AEs  in  the  group  of  AED 
inducers  occurred  under  concomitant  treatment  with  carboxamide  derivatives.  Carbamazepine  is 
known to decrease the BRV plasma concentration by 29%. However, the MAH pointed out that this 
change in exposure does not require a BRV dose adjustment in the pediatric population, similarly to 
the  recommendation  made  in  adults  and  this  has  been  reflected  in  the  SmPC  section  4.5. 
Moreover,  it  should  be  considered  that  some  patients  could  have  taken  more  than  1  concomitant 
AED inducer.    
The  MAH  provided  additional  information  related  to the  analyses  performed  in  the  initial  pediatric 
submission on the PCST values for hematology and blood chemistry parameters. The MAH pointed 
out  that  only  possibly  clinically  significant  treatment  emergent  (PCST)  AEs  and  not  treatment 
emergent  markedly  abnormal  (TEMA)  values  were  recorded  in  the  frame  of  the  BRV  Pediatric 
clinical  development  program.  High  PCST  values  for  hematocrit  were  observed  in  10  patients 
(6.7%)  (3  [2.9%]  in  the  POS≥4  to  <12  years  group  and  7  [17.5%]  in  the  ≥12  to  <16  years 
Assessment report

group). For 3 of these patients, values returned within the normal range at the subsequent visits. 
For  2  patients  the  high  PCST  value  was  seen  at  the  last  visits.  None  of  these  PCST  values  were 
considered by the Investigators as related to BRV but as a stand-alone adverse event. No trend in 
the  BRV  dosage  or  the  time  to  onset  were  observed  and  no  changes  of  BRV  dose  was  made  for 
these patients. For 6 of these patients, values returned within the normal range at the subsequent 
visits, for only one patient high leukocytes values were observed at last visit. Given the above, the 
CHMP  agreed  that  the  reported  increased  hematocrit  values  are  not  related  to  brivaracetam 
treatment. 
As regard to chemistry parameters, the main differences observed between the POS ≥4 to <12 and 
≥12  to  <16  years  populations  were  related  to  the  higher  incidence  (>2%)  of  PCST  ALT  and 
Glucose  in  the  ≥12  to  <16  years  population  (ALT:  10.0%  vs  0.9%;  Glucose:  4.9%  vs  0)  and  of 
PCST  hypernatremia  in  the  ≥4  to  <12  years  population  (Hypernatremia:  4.7%  vs  2.5%).  In  the 
overall  POS  pediatric  population  ≥4  to  <16,  PCST  AEs  high  ALT  (3.3%),  GGT  (10.9%),  sodium 
(4.1%),  and  urate  (3.3%)  occurred  with  a  relatively  high  incidence.  The  PCST  high  ALT  occurred 
during the first months (first 9 months) of treatments and no specific trend over the different visits 
was observed. Given the above and the low numbers it is not possible to draw definite conclusion 
on causal relationship between BRV treatment and increase of transaminases and hypernatraemia. 
The  increase  of  transaminase  was  also  observed  in  the  BRV  adult  population  (Pool  S4).  The  MAH 
reassures that the AEs related to hepatic and renal disorders will continue to be monitored through 
routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
2.6.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Though the single arm study design constitutes a limitation in the ability to attribute side effects to 
drug exposure, it appears that no major safety issues were identified in paediatric patients when 
compared with the known safety profile in adults.  
A higher frequency of suicidality, especially teenagers, and behavioural disorders compared to the 
ones reported for adults were observed. These higher incidences observed in children are 
appropriately reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Considering the age group, further characterization of the safety of brivaracetam treatment in 
paediatric patients is needed in terms of long-term effects on growth, endocrine function or sexual 
maturation, neurodevelopment, cognitive impairment, anxiety, and depression in paediatric 
patients. These will continue to be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities. In 
addition, relevant data are expected to be collected in the on-going study N01266.  
Despite the uncertainties listed above, the safety profile of brivaracetam in the proposed paediatric 
population is considered acceptable. 
2.6.4.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are 
set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-

Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with impaired renal function (see section 5.2). 
Brivaracetam is not recommended in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing dialysis due to 
lack of data. 
Based on data in adults, no dose adjustment is necessary in paediatric patients with 
impaired renal function. 
Hepatic impairment 
Exposure to brivaracetam was increased in adult patients with chronic liver disease. AIn adults, a 
50 mg/day starting dose should be considered. In children and adolescents weighing 50 kg or 
greater, a 50 mg/day starting dose is recommended. A maximum daily dose of 150 mg 
administered in 2 divided doses is recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment (see section 
4.4 and 5.2). 
In children and adolescents weighing less than 50 kg, a 1 mg/kg/day starting dose is 
recommended. The maximum dose should not exceed 3 mg/kg/day. No clinical data are 
available in paediatric patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
The physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according 
to weight and dose.  
The following table summarises the recommended posology for children from 4 years of 
age and adolescents. More details are provided below the table.

Method of administration 
Brivaracetam oral solution can be diluted in water or juice shortly before swallowing and may be 
taken with or without food (see section 5.2). A nasogastric tube or a gastrostomy tube may be 
used when administering brivaracetam oral solution.  
Briviact oral solution is provided with a 5 ml and a 10 ml oral dosing syringe with their 
adaptor.

Oral dosing syringe (5 ml graduated every 0.1 ml) with an adaptor, recommended for 
use by patients weighing less than 20 kg or needing a maximum of 50 mg (5 ml) 
brivaracetam per administration. 
The 5 ml oral syringe must be used in patients weighing less than 20 kg to ensure 
accurate dosing as the 10 ml oral syringe does not allow accurate measurements of 
volumes <1 ml. 
One full 5 ml oral dosing syringe corresponds to 50 mg of brivaracetam. The minimum 
extractible volume is 0.25 ml which is 2.5 mg of brivaracetam. As from the 0.1 ml 
graduation mark, each graduation corresponds to 0.1 ml which is 1 mg of brivaracetam. 
Additional graduations at 0.25 ml and 0.75 ml starting at 0.25 ml up to 5 ml are shown. 
Oral dosing syringe (10 ml graduated every 0.25 ml) with an adaptor, recommended for 
use by patients weighing more than 20 kg or needing a dose between 50 mg and 100 mg 
(5 ml to 10 ml) brivaracetam per administration. 
One full 10 ml oral dosing syringe corresponds to 100 mg of brivaracetam. The minimum 
extractible volume is 1 ml which is 10 mg of brivaracetam. As from the 1 ml graduation 
mark, each graduation corresponds to 0.25 ml which is 2.5 mg of brivaracetam.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour 
Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs 
(AEDs), including brivaracetam, in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomized placebo-
controlled trials of AEDs has also shown a small increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour. 
The mechanism of this risk is not known and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an 
increased risk for brivaracetam. 
Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviours and appropriate 
treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek 
medical advice should any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. See also section 4.8, 
paediatric data.

Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In the table below, adverse reactions, which were identified based on review of the three 
placebo-controlled, fixed-dose full brivaracetam clinical studies safety database in subjects ≥ 
16 years of age, are listed by System Organ Class and frequency.  
The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), 
uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are 
presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
[…] 
Paediatric population 
The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children was consistent with the safety 
profile observed in adults. In the open label, uncontrolled, long-term studies suicidal 
ideation was reported in 4.7 % of paediatric patients (more common in adolescents) 
compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural disorders were reported in 24.8 % of 
paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or

moderate in intensity, were non-serious, and did not lead to discontinuation of study 
drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity 
(4.7 %).  
There are limited safety data from open-label studies in children from 1 month to < 16 4 years of 
age. A total of 152 children (1 month to < 16 years of age) were treated with brivaracetam in a 
pharmacokinetic study and the related follow up study.  From the limited available data, the most 
frequently reported TEAEs considered drug-related by the investigator were somnolence (10 %), 
decreased appetite (8 %), fatigue (5 %) and weight decreased (5 %).The safety profile appears to 
be consistent with that known in adults. No Limited data are available on neurodevelopment in 
children <4 years of age. Currently, nNo clinical data are available in neonates. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The applicant has submitted a full user test for the oral solution and two bridging reports, one for 
the film-coated tablets and one for the solution for injection/infusion. 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet show that the 
package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of the 
label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. The bridging reports submitted by 
the applicant have also been found acceptable 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Favourable effects 
The efficacy of brivaracetam has been established as adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures 
with or without secondary generalisation in adult and adolescent patients from 16 years of age with 
epilepsy.  An extension of indication is proposed with the present application for children from 4 
years of age. As stated in the CHMP Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the 
treatment of epileptic disorders, focal epilepsies in children older than 4 years are expected to have 
a similar clinical expression to that of adolescents and adults. Therefore, extrapolation of efficacy 
from adults to children based on similar exposure is considered acceptable. 
No study focusing on clinical efficacy in the paediatric population has been provided in the current 
application. Extrapolation of efficacy in adjunctive therapy of POS as established in adults was 
proposed with support of clinical pharmacology data. In a pharmacokinetic study with a 3-week 
evaluation period and weekly fixed 3-step up-titration scheme using the brivaracetam oral solution 
it was shown that plasma concentrations were dose-proportional in all age groups. Population 
pharmacokinetics modeling indicated that the dose of 2.0 mg/kg twice a day provides the same 
steady-state average plasma concentration as in adults receiving 100 mg twice daily. The 
estimated plasma clearance was 1.61 L/h, 2.18  L/h and 3.19 L/h for children weighing 20 kg, 
30 kg and 50 kg, respectively. In comparison, plasma clearance was estimated at 3.58 L/h in adult 
patients (70 kg body weight). Similar exposure as in adults and dose recommendations are 
supported with popPK/PD modelling and simulation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 108/112 
 
  
  
 
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The application is based on PK bridging of efficacy from adults to children, as is generally accepted 
in POS. Residual uncertainties on magnitude of effect are remaining but are considered minor to 
such extrapolation. 
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The paediatric safety database consisting of 219 patients including 168 with POS is considered of 
adequate size as 104 patients aged 4-16 years were exposed to brivaracetam at least 12 months. 
In general the safety profile did not differ qualitatively from the safety profile in adults. The most 
frequently reported common TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (24.2% of subjects); pharyngitis 
(20.1%); pyrexia, convulsion, headache (17.4%), vomiting (14.8%), diarrhea (12.1%) and 
somnolence (10.4%) with highest incidences during the first 3-month period after dosing (78.5% 
of subjects), and ranging from 13.3% to 52.8% at all subsequent time intervals. The incidences of 
nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, pyrexia, vomiting, psychomotor hyperactivity, decreased appetite and 
suicidality were higher in the paediatric patients compared to adults. 
Higher incidences rates (corrected by 100-year exposure) were observed in the 4 to 16 years POS 
children with respect to the Pool S4) for seizure worsening (14.91 vs. 6.01, respectively), 
behavioral disorder (17.78 vs. 5.22, respectively), suicidality (2.86 vs. 1.02, respectively), 
accidents and injuries (14.59 vs. 10.29, respectively), and falls (12.40 and 10.08, respectively).  
Weight decrease was frequently observed after brivaracetam treatment; however no permanent 
discontinuation of the study was registered. 
Although 9 subjects (6%) in the ≥4 to <16y POS population met at least 1 laboratory criterion for 
drug-induced liver injury or reported at least 1 TEAE potentially associated with hepatotoxicity, no 
subject met Hy’s Law for fatal drug-induced liver injury. Given the low numbers it is not possible to 
draw definite conclusion on causal relationship between BRV treatment and increase of 
transaminases and hypernatraemia. The increase of transaminase was also observed in the BRV 
adult population (Pool S4). The MAH reassures that the AEs related to hepatic and renal disorders 
will continue to be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
3.4.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The single arm open-label uncontrolled study design intrinsically makes specific attribution of 
causality of side effects fraught with uncertainty. 
The available data on growth, endocrine function or sexual maturation, neurodevelopment, 
cognition and psychotomor status in paediatric patients is very limited currently as these aspects 
require longer duration of observation and larger study population. Moreover, higher proportions of 
behavioral disorders and suicidality were observed in adolescents compared to adults, however 
definite conclusions cannot be drawn given the open-label design of the clinical studies assessing 
safety in the extended indication of brivaracetam down to 4 years of age. Although this could be 
expected, indirect comparison with available clinical data from other antiepileptics (lacosamide, 
levetiracetam and perampanel), seems to indicate a possibly higher incidence of suicidal ideation in 
pediatric brivaracetam studies. Nevertheless, differences in studied-population, exposure and study 
design should be taken into account.  Long-term safety is listed as missing information in the RMP 
and further characterization and monitoring of these safety concerns will be performed through 
routine pharmacovigilance.  
Overall, there is yet no convincing evidence of the absence of seizure worsening with the exposure 
to BRV in patients with POS aged from 4 to 16 years and particularly in those for whom POS and 
Assessment report  
EMA/472006/2018 
Page 109/112 
 
  
  
non-POS seizures could coexist. A larger amount of EEG data was expected than those presented 
with the current application. Additional data is expected to be collected and made available in the 
final CSR of study N01266.  
3.5.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.5.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The effect of brivaracetam in the adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in children 4 to 16 
years of age is extrapolated from the studies in patients 16 years and older. These studies showed 
clinically relevant reduction in seizure frequency with brivaracetam as add-on therapy. Weight-
based paediatric dosing regimens have been established using population-PK modelling and 
simulations. The safety profile in the paediatric population of 4 to 16 years of age does not seem to 
significantly differ in the types of adverse events from that already known in the adult population of 
POS patients, however available data on neurodevelopment, cognition and psychotomor status are 
very limited and no useful information is derived from the results of the Achenbach CBCL and 
BRIEF scales due to missing data and lack of adequate analyses. Further, higher incidence rates of 
suicidal ideation, compared with the adult studies, as discussed above were observed particularly in 
the ≥12 to <16 years POS children. The risk of suicidal ideation was already known and 
appropriately described in the Warnings and Precautions section of the SmPC. However, a higher 
incidence of adverse events within the behavioral disorders was observed in children when 
compared to the one reported for adults. Although this can be expected in this age group in 
general, such a higher incidence is reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC, given the uncertainties on 
causal relationship with brivaracetam treatment. 
3.5.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy of brivaracetam in 4 to 16 years old patients with POS is considered established based 
on extrapolation of efficacy from the studies in adults and adolescents.  
The safety profile of brivaracetam in the proposed paediatric population is considered sufficiently 
characterised to allow for an assessment of the benefit-risk balance.  
In conclusion, the benefit-risk profile of Briviact in the paediatric population is deemed positive, 
and the extension of indication to include adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset 
seizures with or without secondary generalisation in children with epilepsy 4 years of age and older 
is approvable.  
3.6.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Briviact is positive.

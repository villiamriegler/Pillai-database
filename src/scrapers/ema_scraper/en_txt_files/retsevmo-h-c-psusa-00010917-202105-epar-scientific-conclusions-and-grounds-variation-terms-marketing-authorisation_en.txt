Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for selpercatinib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on tumour lysis syndrome (TLS), one reported positive rechallenge confounded 
by the advance state of the disease, TLS listed for several class products, and due to the severity of the 
event, the PRAC concluded that the product information selpercatinib should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for selpercatinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing selpercatinib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

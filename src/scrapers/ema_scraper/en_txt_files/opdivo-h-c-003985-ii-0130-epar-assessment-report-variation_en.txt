2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The MAH submitted a variation to the marketing authorisation to extend the indication to include: 
“OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years of 
age and older with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma who have undergone complete resection.”. 
The finally approved wording is (new text in bold): 
“OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years of 
age and older with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma, or melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or 
metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection (see SmPC section 5.1).”.

Epidemiology and risk factors 
The European annual incidence of malignant melanoma varies from 3–5/100 000 in Mediterranean 
countries to 12–35/100 000 in Nordic countries. The incidence of melanoma has been rising steadily 
over the last 40 years, with a trend towards stabilization of mortality, except in elderly males1. 
Melanoma incidence peaks at 65 years, though any age can be affected2. Paediatric melanoma, usually 
defined as melanoma occurring in patients younger than 20 years, represents approximately 1% to 
4% of all melanomas.7,8 While rare in the adolescent population, the incidence of melanoma rises 
sharply to over 10 per million in the second decade, and 15-19 year old account for between 70% and 
80% of all melanoma cases diagnosed in individuals < 20 years of age 3,4  The major environmental 
risk factor for melanoma is ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the best prevention is physical protection 
with adapted garments. Risk factors for melanoma in pediatric and adult patients are similar. Genetic 
predisposing conditions for developing melanoma, specifically in the pediatric population, do more 
frequently manifest in early childhood than in adolescence. 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Most melanomas arise as superficial, indolent tumours that are confined to the epidermis, where they 
remain for several years. At some point, probably in response to the stepwise accumulation of genetic 
abnormalities, the melanoma is transformed into an expansile nodule that extends beyond the biologic 
boundary of the basement membrane and invades the dermis. Frequently observed mutations in order 
of decreasing frequency are BRAF, RAS and NF15. Melanoma is a heterogeneous and complex disease 
with various clinical factors and molecular defects playing a key role in outcomes. Cutaneous 
melanoma is by far the most common melanoma subtype, accounting for in excess of 90% of cases of 
melanoma. The 2018 World Health Organization classification of cutaneous melanoma takes into 
account the site of origin (epithelium associated versus non-epithelium associated), role of cumulative 
sun damage (CSD; high CSD related, low CSD related, or non-CSD related), mole phenotype (high 
versus low nevus count), and frequency of BRAF, NRAS, and other relevant mutations. Based on 
morphologic features, there are four main types of cutaneous melanoma: superficial spreading 
melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, and nodular melanoma. Less 
common variants include amelanotic melanoma, spitzoid melanoma, and desmoplastic melanoma. 
Paediatric melanoma is conventionally distinguished into three main categories, including conventional 
melanoma (CM), melanoma arising in congenital nevi (CNM), and spitzoid melanoma. CMs show a high 
rate of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) that are characteristic of UV damage and displays a high 
rate of genetic similarities with adult melanoma. On the contrarily, there is evidence that melanoma 
arising in CNMs shows a lower frequency of UV-related mutations, possibly due to a higher baseline 
risk. 
The 8th Edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual also applies to paediatric melanoma. The comparison 
between adult and paediatric melanoma is challenging given the poorly investigated biology and 
pathogenesis of disease in the paediatric setting. Controversial findings have been reported in terms of 
prognostic values in the young age categories for histopathological hallmarks such as ulceration and

thickness (see below section), differences in primary site of lesions between adults and adolescents 
have been described, as well as stage at diagnosis and tumour subtypes. Primary melanoma tumour 
characteristics are considered to be comparable between adolescent and adult melanoma patients, in 
contrast to the disease in prepubescent children. In an analysis of 1255 paediatric and young adults 
(age less than 20 years), the 10 to 19 year-old group had similar baseline characteristics compared 
with the group of 20 to 24 year-old young adults, while there were significant differences in baseline 
characteristics of young children (age less than 10 years) as compared with adolescents and young 
adults. Young children were more likely to be non-white and to have metastases, nodular or other 
histology, head, face, or neck primaries, thicker lesions, and history of cancer.6 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Suspicious pigmented lesions are usually clinically analysed with the ‘ugly duckling’ concept and the 
‘ABCD’ rule: Asymmetry, Border irregularities, Colour heterogeneity, Dynamics, (Dynamics or 
evolution in colours, elevation or size). The eighth version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC) staging and classification system, which includes sentinel node staging, is the preferred 
classification system7. 
The target population is confined to adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with stage IIB 
and stage IIC melanoma (patients with T3b-T4b N0 disease per AJCC 8th edition) who have undergone 
complete resection. These patients have a primary tumour that is thick and/or ulcerated (>4 mm thick 
with or without ulceration, or >2 to 4 mm thick with ulceration), but no lymph node involvement. 
Patients with Stage IIB/C resected melanoma are at high risk of melanoma recurrence (approximately 
one third of Stage IIB and one half of Stage IIC patients will recur within 5 years). Melanoma-specific 
survival of Stage IIB and IIC patients is generally similar to melanoma-specific survival of Stage IIIA 
and IIIB patients, respectively. 5-year and 10-year melanoma-specific survival is estimated to be 
83%-87% and 72%-82%, respectively, for Stage IIB patients and 70%-82% and 58%-75%, 
respectively, for Stage IIC patients.2,4  
Management 
Standard of care for patients with clinical Stage II melanoma of all substages consists of wide surgical 
excision of the primary melanoma with the option to perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy. For Stage 
IIB/C melanomas (tumor thickness > 2.0 mm), the evaluation of the sentinel lymph node for disease 
involvement and a wide excision of the primary melanoma with 2-cm margins is recommended. 
Patients who have a positive sentinel lymph node are upstaged to Stage III and can undergo either 
surveillance of the nodal basin with ultrasound or complete lymph node dissection. Per current 
guidelines, patients with node positive disease may be offered nivolumab, pembrolizumab, 
dabrafenib/trametinib (for patients with a BRAF V600 activating mutation), or observation in the 
adjuvant setting. Current treatment recommendations for patients with a negative sentinel lymph node 
biopsy or for patients in whom a sentinel lymph node biopsy was not conducted for any reason is 
observation with periodic surveillance to detect disease recurrence. In addition to observation for 
patients with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma, adjuvant pembrolizumab is also a recommended treatment 
option in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines after a clinician has a 
detailed discussion with a patient taking into consideration treatment benefits and risks8.

Pembrolizumab has not yet been listed in the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
guidelines for treatment of Stage IIB/C adjuvant melanoma9.  
Currently, only 1 approved treatment option, pembrolizumab, exists for Stage IIB/C resected 
melanoma patients. In Jun-2022, pembrolizumab (Keytruda) was approved for the adjuvant treatment 
of adult and paediatric (≥ 12 years of age) patients with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma following complete 
resection and is the only approved treatment option available for these patients (Keytruda II/111 
EPAR). Approval was based on the registrational study KEYNOTE-716, a multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with resected Stage IIB or IIC melanoma who 
received pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks (or the paediatric [12 to 17 years old] dose of 2 
mg/kg intravenously [up to a maximum of 200 mg] every three weeks) or placebo, for up to one year 
or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. The study initially demonstrated a statistically 
significant improvement in RFS (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.46, 0.92), supported by a statistically significant 
effect of pembrolizumab relative to placebo on DMFS at the first interim analysis.  
Melanoma in adolescents and adults is generally regarded as an analogous disease and is treated 
similarly using multimodal therapy including surgery, systemic therapy, and in some cases, radiation. 
As such, current treatment strategies for paediatric and adolescent melanoma are based on clinical 
guidelines for adult patients10, and there are limited clinical studies evaluating treatment outcomes in 
these age groups. Despite the small number of patients, results of these studies suggest that safety 
profiles and treatment effects in adolescents are comparable with adult patients.  
The efficacy and safety of nivolumab has been reviewed for use in adolescent patients (≥ 12 to < 18 
years old) in the Type II variation for extension of the indication for nivolumab as a single agent or in 
combination with ipilimumab for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in 
adolescents and for nivolumab as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of adolescents with 
melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete 
resection (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G, positive opinion April 2023). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Opdivo (nivolumab) is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (HuMAb), which binds 
to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 
receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of 
T-cell immune responses. Nivolumab potentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, 
through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands. 
Nivolumab monotherapy is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with 
advanced/metastatic melanoma, NSCLC, RCC, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, squamous cell cancer of 
the head and neck, urothelial carcinoma, and OSCC (Opdivo SmPC). 
In the adjuvant setting, nivolumab is approved for treatment of adults with melanoma with 
involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection, muscle 
invasive urothelial carcinoma, and oesophageal cancer or GEJC, and in the neoadjuvant treatment of 
adult patients with resectable Stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer.

Nivolumab is also approved in combination therapy for the treatment of patients with melanoma, RCC, 
mismatch repair deficient/microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer, malignant pleural 
mesothelioma, NSCLC, GC, GEJC or OC, and OSCC. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific advice was not sought for the proposed indication. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The pivotal study CA20976K was conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) as defined by the International Council for Harmonisation and was conducted to meet the ethical 
requirement of European Directive 2001/20/EC. For Study CA20976K, the protocol, amendments, 
administrative letters, and subject informed consent form received Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee approval prior to implementation. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Nivolumab is a protein, which is expected to be metabolised in the body and biodegrade in the 
environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), nivolumab is exempt from the submission of 
Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not expect to pose a 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody and is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment, 
thus the lack of ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Nivolumab doses of 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W are currently approved in adults in the EU for 
multiple indications, including advanced melanoma and for the adjuvant treatment of resected Stage 
III/IV melanoma. The approved dosing regimens for melanoma were based on population 
pharmacokinetics and exposure-response (E-R) safety and efficacy analyses. This is supported by 
similar nivolumab exposures across subjects with Stage III/IV resected melanoma and similar 
recurrence free survival (RFS) across Stage III/IV for the 3 mg/kg Q2W dosing regimen from Study 
CA209238 and for the 480 mg Q4W dosing regimen from Study CA209915 (see procedures 
EMEA/H/C/003985/0003, II/0036, II/0041, and II/0069).  
In the recently adopted procedure EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G, extensive pharmacokinetic and 
exposure-response safety analyses across adolescent and adult studies were conducted to recommend 
an adolescent (≥ 12 to < 18 years) dosing regimen in advanced and resected Stage III/IV melanoma 
based on paediatric extrapolation principles. 
Predicted pharmacokinetic exposure parameters of nivolumab for the proposed posology in adolescents 
and adults with melanoma are summarised in Table 2 and Table 3. For treatment of adults with 
melanoma, dosing of 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W is approved. For adolescents, currently a body-
weight based dosing is proposed for patients 30-40 kg i.e. 3 mg/kg Q2W or 6 mg/kg Q4W, and a flat 
dosing regimen for patients> 40 kg i.e. 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W. As can be seen in Table 2 and 
Table 3, adolescents with body-weights 40-60 kg have on average slightly higher exposures than those 
observed in adults. Since a body weight dosing is proposed for adolescents with body weight < 40 kg,

nivolumab exposures are within the range of adults for adolescents weighing 30-40 kg. Average 
nivolumab exposures in adolescents > 60 kg are within the range of adults.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new pharmacokinetic and exposure-response data were submitted for this application. This is 
acceptable based on the well known pharmacology of nivolumab in patients with melanoma. 
Extension of the indication to include adolescent patients aged 12 years and older in treatment of 
advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma (nivolumab monotherapy), treatment of advanced 
(unresectable or metastatic) melanoma (nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab) and adjuvant 
treatment of melanoma (nivolumab monotherapy) for Opdivo has been evaluated in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G. Since there were no new data in adolescents in the current procedure, 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023  
Page 14/94 
 
 
 
 
the posology of Opdivo for adolescents with stage IIB or IIC melanoma who have undergone complete 
resection was harmonised with the approved posology in procedure EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G, 
where for treatment of adults with melanoma, dosing of 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W is proposed and 
for adolescents, a body-weight based dosing is proposed for patients 30-40 kg i.e. 3 mg/kg Q2W or 6 
mg/kg Q4W, and a flat dosing regimen for patients> 40 kg i.e. 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W (see 
SmPC 4.2). 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No new pharmacology data were provided for this extension of indication. This is considered 
acceptable. The posology for Opdivo monotherapy in adolescents with melanoma has been established 
during evaluation of EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Nivolumab is approved at the 240 mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W dose for numerous indications. 
The proposed posology of nivolumab 480 mg Q4W and 240 mg Q2W are recommended based on the 
totality of clinical data from Study CA20976K dosing 480 mg Q4W as a 30-minute IV infusion, as well 
as the collective clinical experience of nivolumab monotherapy in melanoma. The following provide a 
summary of the dose justification for nivolumab in adults and adolescents: 
•  Clinical efficacy and safety data from pivotal Study CA20976K confirmed the favourable 
benefit-risk of nivolumab 480 mg Q4W as adjuvant treatment in subjects with completely 
resected Stage IIB/C melanoma. 
•  The stage of resected melanoma prior to treatment is not expected to impact nivolumab PK 
given the similarity of PK across different stages of resected III/IV from study CA209238 for 3 
mg/kg Q2W dosing and from study CA209915 for 480 mg Q4W dosing. Therefore, nivolumab 
PK is expected to be similar in resected Stage IIB/C to that of resected Stage III/IV. 
•  Previous population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response safety and efficacy analyses 
confirmed a favourable benefit-risk profile for adults in the adjuvant treatment of resected 
Stage III/IV melanoma and advanced melanoma for the 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W dosing 
regimens.  
•  Previous population pharmacokinetics and exposure-response safety analyses, showed a 
favourable benefit-risk profile for adolescents in adjuvant treatment of melanoma Stage III/IV 
across adult and adolescent studies for the 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W dosing regimens for 
adolescents ≥40 kg and 3 mg/kg Q2W or 6 mg/kg Q4W for adolescents < 40 kg 
(EMEA/H/C/003985/II/125/G).  
•  Exposure differences between 240 mg Q2W and 480 mg Q4W have been extensively evaluated 
in advanced and adjuvant settings. Clinical equivalence of the posology is supported by 
modelling and simulation with the same benefit-risk expected to apply across resected Stage 
IIB/C and III/IV melanoma. 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023  
Page 15/94 
 
 
 
 
•  An alternative nivolumab dosing option of 240 mg Q2W provides patients and clinicians with 
dosing flexibility and is consistent with the current approved dosing regimens of 240 mg Q2W 
or 480 mg Q4W in advanced melanoma and the adjuvant treatment of resected Stage III/IV 
melanoma. 
•  No dose modifications are needed for any patient subgroups. 
The posology of Opdivo for adolescents with stage IIB or IIC melanoma who have undergone complete 
resection has been harmonized with the agreed posology in the previous procedure 
EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G. 
2.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
CA20976K: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind Study of Adjuvant 
Immunotherapy with Nivolumab versus Placebo after Complete Resection 
of Stage IIB/C Melanoma 
Methods 
Study CA20976K (NCT04099251) is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate 
the use of adjuvant immunotherapy with nivolumab versus placebo after complete resection of Stage 
IIB/C melanoma in adults and adolescent subjects ≥ 12 years old. Subjects with resected Stage IIB/C 
melanoma and no evidence of disease were randomized to treatment with either nivolumab or placebo 
for a duration of 12 months. In the event of disease recurrence, subjects had the option to receive on-
study open-label nivolumab treatment or receive treatment per local standard of care. Placebo-treated 
subjects who experienced disease recurrence within 3 years after the last dose of placebo, and 
nivolumab-treated subjects who experienced recurrence greater than 6 months and within 3 years 
after completing treatment, were eligible to receive on-study open-label nivolumab treatment. 
Subjects with recurrent resectable disease were offered nivolumab for a maximum duration of 12 
months, whereas subjects with recurrent unresectable or metastatic disease were offered nivolumab 
for a maximum of 24 months (Figure 1).

Tumor assessments were performed every 26 weeks (± 14 days) during the treatment phase of 12 
months using CT and CT/MRI. Participants with signs or symptoms consistent with brain metastases 
should have an MRI of the brain (CT if MRI was contraindicated) as clinically indicated. 
Participants must be followed for at least 100 days after the last dose of study treatment. FU1 should 
occur 30 days from the last dose (± 7 days) and FU2 occurs approximately 100 days (± 7 days) from 
the last dose of study treatment.  
Long term follow-up: Imaging was performed every 26 weeks (± 14 days) during years 1, 2, and 3 
and every 52 weeks (± 28 days) during years 4 and 5. Participants who develop a loco-regional 
recurrence only, must be followed by surveillance imaging until the development of distant 
metastases.  
Survival status was determined every 12 weeks (±14 days) from FU2 until the OS final analysis. 
In the current application (thus also in this document), only data from the blinded part are presented. 
Study participants 
Male and female participants (≥ 12 years of age) with completely resected Stage IIB or IIC melanoma, 
with no evidence of disease (NED). Note: Where local regulations and/or institutional policies do not 
allow for participants < 18 years of age, the eligible participant population is ≥ 18 years of age. 
Inclusion criteria 
Key inclusion criteria included the following: 
•  Participants must have been diagnosed with Stage IIB/C cutaneous melanoma (AJCC Staging, 
8th edition) and have histologically confirmed melanoma that is completely surgically resected, 
with documented negative margins (per local standard) for disease on resected specimens. All 
melanomas, except ocular and mucosal melanoma, regardless of primary site of disease will be 
allowed. 
•  Complete resection with documented negative margins (per local standard) and sentinel lymph 
node assessment for presence/absence of disease, must be performed within 12 weeks prior to 
randomization. Note: In case of delays exceeding 12 weeks due to unforeseen circumstances, 
the eligibility should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or designee.  
•  Participants must have had a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy. Participants in whom a 
sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure could not be done or a sentinel lymph node was not 
detected are not eligible. 
•  Participants must have disease-free status documented by a complete physical examination 
(within 14 days) and imaging studies within 4 weeks (28 days) prior to randomization. Imaging 
studies must include computerized tomography (CT) scans of the chest/abdomen/pelvis or CT 
scan of the chest and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the abdomen and pelvis, 
and all known sites of resected disease (imaging of extremities for resected melanomas located 
in the extremities is not a requirement). The evaluation of extremities may be conducted, and 
documented, per local standard of care. Participants with signs and symptoms consistent with 
brain metastases should have imaging studies done to rule out the presence of brain 
metastases. 
•  Participant has not been previously treated for melanoma beyond complete surgical resection 
of the melanoma lesion. 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023

•  Participant has recovered adequately from toxicity and/or complications from surgery prior to 
study start. 
•  ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 at the time of enrolment. 
•  Tumour tissue (minimum of 15 unstained slides, preferably freshly cut, or 1 formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded block to contain sufficient tissue for at least 15 sections) from the primary 
diagnostic biopsy must be shipped to the central laboratory prior to randomization. If the

Blinded part - Nivolumab/placebo treated subjects: Adult subjects and paediatric subjects (≥ 12 
years old) who weighed ≥ 40 kg received nivolumab (or matching placebo) at a dose of 480 mg as an 
approximately 30-minute infusion on Day 1 of each 4-week treatment cycle until unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal of consent, completion of 12 months of treatment (from first dose of study treatment), 
disease recurrence, or the study ends, whichever occurred first. Paediatric subjects weighing < 40 kg 
received nivolumab (or matching placebo) 6 mg/kg once every 4 weeks (Q4W) up to a maximum of 
240 mg. Subjects began study treatment (Cycle 1) within 3 calendar days of randomization. 
Subsequent cycles were initiated within ± 3 days of the target visit date.

Objectives/endpoints 
Table 4 Objectives and endpoints for study CA20976K 
Primary objective 
Primary endpoint 
To compare investigator-assessed 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) between 
treatment arms  
RFS: the time between the date of randomization and the 
date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant 
metastasis), new primary melanoma (including melanoma in 
situ), or death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first. 
Secondary objectives 
Secondary endpoint 
To compare the overall survival (OS) 
between treatment arms 
OS was defined as the time between the date of 
randomization and the date of death, from any cause.  
To assess safety and toxicity of 
nivolumab monotherapy  
The assessment of safety was based on the incidence of 
adverse events (AEs). The use of immune modulating 
medications were also summarized. In addition, clinical 
laboratory tests and immunogenicity were analyzed. 
Toxicities were graded using the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 5.0. 
To evaluate investigator-assessed 
distant metastases-free survival 
(DMFS) 
DMFS was defined as the time between the date of 
randomization and the date of first distant recurrence or the 
date of death (due to any cause), whichever occurred first. 
To evaluate investigator-assessed 
outcomes on next-line therapies 
The definition of next line therapy is any systemic anti-cancer 
therapy for melanoma with a start date on or after the date 
of first dose of study drug (randomization date if subject was 
never treated). 
Progression-free survival through next-line therapy 
(PFS2) was defined as the time from randomization to 
recurrence/objective disease progression after the start of 
next-line of systemic anti-cancer therapy, or to the start of 
second next-line systemic therapy, or to death from any 
cause, whichever occurred first. 
In case PFS2 cannot be reliably determined, an alternative 
end-of-next-line-treatment will be defined as the time 
from randomization to recurrence/objective disease 
progression after start of next-line systemic anti-cancer 
therapy, or to discontinuation of next-line therapy, or death 
from any cause, whichever occurred first. 
Duration of treatment on next-line therapy was defined 
as the time from first dose date of next-line therapy to last 
dose date of next-line therapy. Subjects who did not stop the 
next-line therapy were censored. 
Objective Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the 
number of randomized subjects who achieve a best overall 
response of complete response or partial response after next-
line therapy based on investigator assessments (using 
RECIST v1.1) divided by the number of all randomized 
subjects.

•  To evaluate treatment-free interval (TFI) defined as the time from last dose of study treatment 
to the start of subsequent systemic therapy or the last known alive date (for those who never 
received subsequent cancer therapy). 
•  To assess the participant’s cancer-related Quality of Life (QoL) using the European 
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30. 
•  To assess the participant’s quality of life and overall health status using the EQ-5D-5L utility 
index (UI) and visual analogue scale, respectively. 
•  To characterize participant perceptions of the bothersomeness of symptomatic AEs based on 
functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) GP5 item. 
•  To characterize the immunogenicity of nivolumab. 
•  To explore potential association of biomarkers (e.g., PD-L1 expression) with clinical efficacy 
(RFS, DMFS and OS) and/or incidence of adverse events of nivolumab by analyzing biomarker 
measures within the tumour microenvironment and periphery (e.g., blood, serum, plasma, 
tumour tissue and PBMCs) in comparison to clinical outcomes. 
•  To explore potential association of tumour mutational burden (TMB) with clinical efficacy (RFS, 
DMFS and OS). 
No data were provided on TMB and biomarkers, other than PD-L1. 
Sample size 
The sample size of the study was based on a comparison of the RFS distribution between subjects 
randomized to nivolumab and subjects randomized to placebo. Approximately 154 RFS events were 
required for a two-sided experiment-wise alpha = 0.05 log-rank test, to show a statistically significant 
difference in RFS between the treatment arms with at least 90% power when the average HR of the 
nivolumab arm to the placebo arm is 0.573. Given an estimated accrual rate, the accrual of 780 
subjects (i.e., 520 subjects in the nivolumab arm and 260 subjects in the placebo arm) would take 
approximately 29.6 months. Under the assumptions for accrual, an assumed delayed treatment effect 
of 6 months as per the Sunbelt Melanoma Trial (McMasters KM, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2016;34:1079-
1086) and assumed HR as stated above (HR = 1 for the first 6 months, HR = 0.537 after 6 months, HR 
= 1 from Year 10 [plateau effect]), it would take approximately 68.1 months from the randomization 
of the first subject to observe the required number of RFS events. An observed HR of 0.707 or less 
would result in a statistically significant improvement at the final analysis of RFS. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomised 2:1 to nivolumab or placebo though the interactive response 
technology (IRT). Randomization was stratified by AJCC 8th edition tumour category (T3b vs. T4a vs. 
T4b). 
Blinding (masking) 
During the double-blind treatment phase, the sponsor, participants, investigator, and site staff were 
blinded to the study drug administered during the study.

Statistical methods 
Efficacy endpoints 
The primary endpoint of RFS based on the disease recurrence date provided by the investigator is 
defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional 
or distant metastasis), new primary melanoma (including melanoma in situ), or death (due to any 
cause), whichever occurs first. For participants who remain alive and whose disease has not recurred, 
RFS will be censored on the date of last evaluable disease assessment. For those participants who 
remained alive and had no recorded post-randomization tumour assessment, RFS will be censored on 
the day of randomization. Censoring rules for the primary definition of RFS are presented in the table 
below. 
Table 5 Censoring scheme for primary definition of RFS 
The final analysis of RFS was to be conducted when approximately 154 RFS events have occurred. In 
case the events occurred slower than anticipated, final analysis of RFS would be conducted when at 
least 139 events (90% of planned number of events for the final analysis) have been observed. In that 
case, the power would be at least 86% (and the critical hazard ratio (HR) would be 0.692). 
An interim analysis of RFS was planned when approximately 123 RFS events (80% information 
fraction) had been reached among all randomized subjects. The stopping boundaries at the interim and 
final analyses were derived based on the exact number of RFS events using Lan-DeMets alpha 
spending function with O’Brien-Fleming boundaries. With an interim RFS analysis at approximately 123 
RFS events, the type I error was 0.024 (two-sided), the power 62.8%, and an observed HR of 0.65 or 
less would result in a statistically significant improvement. The type I error used for final RFS analysis 
was 0.0043 (two-sided). 
The primary RFS analysis was conducted using a stratified two-sided log-rank test. The stratification 
factor that was used in the analysis was AJCC tumour category at study entry (as recorded per IRT). 
The two-sided stratified log-rank p-value was reported. The estimate of the RFS hazard ratio of 
nivolumab to placebo was calculated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, with treatment 
as the sole covariate, stratified by the above stratification factor. Ties were handled using the exact 
method. A two sided 100x(1-adjusted α)% and 95% confidence intervals (CI’s) for the hazard ratio 
was also presented, along with the two-sided stratified log-rank p-value.

Sensitivity analyses RFS 
In a supportive analysis, a treatment policy strategy was employed for the intercurrent events ‘new 
anti-cancer therapy’ and ‘second non-melanoma primary cancer’. Further supportive analyses included 
analyses using an alternative RFS definition (accounting for two or more consecutively missing disease 
assessments prior to RFS events), analyses accounting for the possibility of delayed effects, analyses 
to evaluate the proportional hazards assumption and treatment by strata interactions, and analyses 
using different modelling options (e.g. models without stratification, or including stratification factors 
as covariates in the model). 
The first secondary endpoint OS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date 
of death, from any cause. For subjects that are alive, their survival time will be censored at the date of 
last contact (or “last known alive date”). Overall survival will be censored at the date of randomization 
for subjects who were randomized but had no follow-up. For the comparison of OS between nivolumab 
and placebo in all randomized subjects, approximately 277 deaths would be required for a two-sided 
experiment-wise alpha = 0.05 logrank test, to show a statistically significant difference in OS with at 
least 76.6% power when the average HR of the nivolumab arm to the placebo arm is 0.7. It is 
projected that an observed HR of 0.777 or less would result in a statistically significant improvement at 
the final analysis of OS. In case OS events occur too slowly, final analysis may be triggered when a 
minimum follow-up of 9 years (i.e., 108 months) is reached. 
To ensure sufficient maturity of the OS data at the time formal analysis is performed, one formal OS 
interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 166 deaths (60% information fraction) have 
been reached among all randomized subjects, which is expected to occur after the final analysis of 
RFS. We estimate this would occur when all subjects have a minimum follow-up of approximately 63 
months from the randomization of the last subject. The estimated timing for this interim analysis is at 
93 months. The stopping boundaries at the interim and final analyses will be derived based on the 
exact number of OS events using Lan DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming 
boundaries. With an interim OS analysis at approximately 166 deaths, the type I error would be 0.008 
(two-sided), the power 30.7%, and an observed HR of 0.644 or less would result in a statistically 
significant improvement. The type I error to be used for final OS analysis would be 0.048 (two-sided). 
No formal OS interim analysis was planned at the time of either RFS interim or final analysis due to 
anticipated immaturity of the OS data. Descriptive statistics for OS will be prepared at RFS IA and/or 
RFS FA upon regulatory requests. If OS results (beyond the frequency of deaths per arm) including 
Kaplan Meier curves are requested, an administrative alpha of 0.0001 will be spent as alpha penalty. 
Should such analyses be conducted, only a MAH restricted team will have access to OS descriptive 
results. 
OS will be compared between the treatment groups at the OS interim and final analyses, using 
stratified two-sided log-rank test stratified by AJCC T category at study entry (as recorded per IRT). 
Multiplicity 
Multiplicity over RFS and OS was handled by a fixed sequence testing procedure (RFS then OS) and 
the interim and final analyses were handled using group-sequential methodology as described above. 
No formal hypothesis testing was planned besides RFS and OS. 
DMFS (secondary) will be determined based on the first date of distant metastasis provided by the

recurrence (distant metastasis) or the date of death (due to any cause), whichever occurs first.

Table 6 Censoring scheme for primary definition of DMFS 
DMFS will be analyzed using similar analyses methods as for RFS. Analysis results (including p values) 
are considered descriptive, as no multiplicity adjustment was applied. 
PFS2 (secondary): The definition of next line therapy is any systemic anti-cancer therapy for the 
cancer under study with a start date on or after the date of first dose of study drug (randomization 
date if subject was never treated). Accordingly, progression-free survival through next-line therapy 
(PFS2) is defined as the time from randomization to recurrence/objective disease progression after the 
start of the next line of systemic anti-cancer therapy, or to the start of second next-line systemic 
therapy, or to death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Analysis results (including p values) are 
considered descriptive, as no multiplicity adjustment was applied. 
The following censoring rules will be applied for PFS2: 
• 
For subjects who did not receive subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy (ie, next-line 
therapy): 
o  Subjects who died will be considered as having the event on the date of death. 
Subjects who did not die will be censored at the last known alive date. 
• 
For subjects who received subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy (ie, next-line therapy): 
o  Subjects who had a disease progression after the start of subsequent systemic anti-
cancer therapy will be considered as having the event on the date of disease 
progression. Otherwise, if a subject died or started second next-line therapy, the date 
of death or start date of second next-line therapy will be the event date, whichever is 
earlier. Subjects who did not experience disease progression, death, or second next-
line therapy will be censored on the last known alive date. 
Exploratory analyses will be performed for Patient Report Outcome (PRO)’s based on EORTC QLQ-C30 
and EQ-5D-5L, only descriptive data will be provided. 
Pre-planned subgroup analyses (descriptive) included age, gender, race, region, disease category, 
and tumour category. 
Biomarker analyses will be exploratory only. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 986 subjects were enrolled, 790 were randomized, and 788 were treated: 524 with 
nivolumab and 264 with placebo. The most common reason for discontinuation of treatment was study 
drug toxicity in the nivolumab arm and disease progression in the placebo arm (below table). Thirty 
subjects were treated with nivolumab in the open-label phase; 28 who received placebo during the 
blinded phase and 2 who received nivolumab.

At the time of the data cut-off (DCO) (28-Jun-2022), there were 486 (92.7%) subjects in the 
nivolumab arm and 247 (93.6%) subjects in the placebo arm continuing in the study overall. The 
median follow-up (date of randomization to the last known date alive or death date) for all randomized 
subjects was 15.84 months for the nivolumab arm and 15.93 months for the placebo arm. Overall 
minimum follow-up was 7.8 months.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol for this study was dated 13-May-2019. As of the 17-Aug-2022 DBL, there had 
been a total of 3 global protocol amendments, 3 site specific amendments, and 3 administrative 
letters. Key changes to Study CA20976K after the original protocol are provided below. 
Table 7 Summary of key changes to protocol CA20976K  
Changes to planned analysis: There were no major changes to the planned analysis. Additional post-
hoc analyses included ethnicity analysis added to baseline demographic characteristics and a 
subsequent cancer therapy summary for all randomized subjects. 
Protocol deviations 
Important Protocol Deviations are a subset of protocol deviations that may significantly impact the 
completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject's 
rights, safety, or well-being. A review of the deviations determined that there was no detriment to 
subject safety and no significant impact on the interpretability of study results. A summary of 
important protocol deviations is presented below.

GCP deviations and serious breaches 
On 02-Sep-2021, the MAH discovered that an automated process for republishing documents from the 
document management system/PRISM to the shared investigator platform experienced delays due to 
intermittent system failures. Upon investigation (QE-030565), 21% of suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSAR) were delayed (1553/7478), of which 18% (278/1553) were initial SUSARs. 
In addition, 15 blinded SASUSAR reports and 10 executive summaries of development safety update 
reports that had not been communicated in a timely manner to clinical investigators. Based on 
assessment, the MAH determined there was no impact to patient safety as the processes to timely 
report to health authorities and ethics committees were not affected. Also, the signal detection and 
mechanisms to inform investigators and subjects of changes to the risk benefit profile through updates 
to the Investigator Brochure and the Informed Consent remained unchanged. This incident was 
reported as a potential serious breach due to the systemic nature and the potential to impact patient 
safety as the CA20976K investigators may not have received timely notification of SUSARs and 
SASUSARs; however, it was confirmed not to be a serious breach. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographic (Table 9) and disease (Table 10) characteristics were balanced between 
treatment arms. Among all randomized subjects, the median age was 62.0 years (range 19 to 92). The 
majority of subjects were White (98.4%) and male (61.1%). The predominant melanoma subtypes 
were nodular (50.5%) and superficial spreading (29.5%). Per case record form (CRF), 60.6% of 
subjects had Stage IIB disease. The tumour category was T3b in 39.0%, T4a in 21.5%, and T4b in 
39.5% of all randomized subjects. Discrepancy between IRT and CRF was 1.6% (n=12 the nivolumab 
arm).

Outcomes and estimation 
As of the DCO for this planned interim analysis (28-Jun-2022), 135 RFS events had occurred (87.7% 
information fraction). Based on a Lan-DeMets alpha spending function with O’Brien-Fleming 
boundaries, the alpha stopping boundary is 0.03334. The median duration of therapy was 11.04 
months in the nivolumab arm and 11.07 months in the placebo arm. Minimum follow-up time was 7.8 
months and 8.7 months for nivolumab and placebo, respectively.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Recurrence-free Survival 
Study CA20976K met its primary endpoint of RFS; adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg Q4W demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in RFS compared with placebo (HR = 0.42 [95% CI: 0.30, 0.59]; 
log-rank p-value < 0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier curve shows a separation of curves starting around 3 
months which increases over time (Figure 2). RFS rates were higher in the nivolumab arm compared 
with the placebo arm: 95.1% and 88.1% at 6 months, 89.0% and 79.4% at 12 months. 
Figure 3 Kaplan-Meier plot of recurrence-free survival per investigator – All randomized subjects. 
At the time of DCO, 12.5% and 26.1% of all randomized subjects in the nivolumab and placebo arm, 
respectively, had suffered an event for RFS, 87.5% and 73.9% were thus censored for RFS (Table 11), 
and 425 (80.8%) and 180 (68.2%) subjects were either continuing on-treatment or in follow-up in the 
nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively.

Updated analysis of RFS (DCO: 21-Feb-2023) 
An updated RFS analysis was performed with DCO 21-Feb-2023 resulting in an increase of follow-up of 
about 6 months. Median follow-up was about 24 months and minimum follow-up was 15.6 months. All 
patients were off blinded treatment. Event rate increased with 5% - 7% in both treatment arms;

19.4% of patients receiving nivolumab and 31.8% of patients receiving placebo had experienced a 
recurrence event; HR: 0.53 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.71) (Table 15). The reduction in recurrence events was 
primarily driven by fewer distant recurrences (8.4% vs 14.8%) and regional recurrences (3.0% vs 
8.7%) in favor of nivolumab (Table 16). An updated KM plot is presented as well, showing separation 
of curves up till at least 24 months (Figure 4).

Secondary endpoints 
•  Distant metastasis-free survival 
Adjuvant nivolumab was associated with an improvement in DMFS per Investigator compared with 
placebo (HR = 0.47 [95% CI: 0.30, 0.72], descriptive result). Overall, 8% of subjects receiving 
nivolumab and 15.5% receiving placebo experienced a distant recurrence. DMFS rates were 
numerically higher in the nivolumab arm compared with the placebo arm: 97.6% and 93.5% at 6 
months, and 92.3% and 86.7% at 12 months (Table 12 and Figure 5).

Updated analysis of DMFS (DCO: 21-Feb-2023) 
As of the 21-Feb-2023 DCO, 13.1% of patients receiving nivolumab and 19.3% of patients receiving 
placebo had experienced a DMFS event (4% - 5% increase compared to previous DCO) (HR: 0.62, 
95% CI: 0.43, 0.89) (Table 17). DMFS rates over time were numerically higher in the nivolumab arm 
compared with the placebo arm and the KM curves separate from 6 months onwards (Figure 6). As of 
the data cut-off, 457 (86.9%) and 213 (80.7%) of all randomized patients in the nivolumab and 
placebo arms, respectively, were censored for DMFS. The majority of patients were censored on the 
date of their last disease assessment on study.

•  PFS2 
As of the data cutoff, relatively few PFS2 events (n=40) occurred. In all randomized subjects, 23 
(4.4%) PFS2 events occurred in the nivolumab arm and 17 (6.4%) events occurred in the placebo 
arm. The PFS2 HR favoured nivolumab over placebo: 0.68 (95% CI: 0.36, 1.27), though results are 
descriptive only (Figure 7).

Subsequent cancer therapy 
More than 90% of all patients experiencing a recurrence received subsequent therapy (Table 18). More 
patients in the placebo arm than in the nivolumab arm received subsequent systemic therapy (74.1% 
vs 50.0%). Nivolumab monotherapy was the most commonly reported subsequent systemic therapy in 
the placebo arm (45.7% vs. 9.1% in the nivolumab arm), whereas a combination of ipilimumab and 
nivolumab was the most common subsequent systemic therapy in the nivolumab arm (22.7% vs. 
24.7% in the placebo arm).

•  Duration of treatment on next-line systemic therapy 
Median duration of treatment on next-line systemic therapy was numerically lower in the nivolumab 
arm (n=30) compared to placebo (3.94 months vs 11.07 months). This was based on a limited number 
of patients (nivolumab: n=45, and placebo: n=62). 
•  QoL/PRO 
Quality of life on treatment through Week 53 was measured by EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales and showed 
no clinically meaningful deterioration in any arm (descriptive analysis). Mean change in EORTC QLQ-
C30 global health status/QoL score from baseline is shown in Figure 9. Compliance rates were high 
throughout treatment (above 90%). Similar results were observed for EORTS QLQ-C30 Role 
Functioning subscale. Also scores for other subscales remained stable in both treatment arms, with no 
group mean score from baseline reaching the minimally important difference (MID).

A total of 790 patients were randomized in the study, out of which 658 (83.3%) had evaluable 
BRAF V600 samples and 132 were not evaluable. BRAF status was determined by whole DNA exome 
sequencing of the submitted tumor samples. Subgroup analysis by BRAF mutation status is shown 
below.

PD-L1 subgroups 
Biomarker assay 
The PD-L1 immunohistochemistry 28-8 pharmDx assay co-developed by the MAH and DAKO North 
America (Carpinteria, CA US) using a rabbit anti-human PD-L1 antibody (clone 28-8; Epitomics Inc, 
Burlingame, CA US) was used to assess PD-L1 expression in tumour samples. The Dako 28-8 assay 
has acceptable cut slide stability validated up to 4 months and has not generated data beyond this 
time point; thus only freshly sectioned samples from tumour blocks were used for this retrospective 
analysis. 
Please note the following definitions: 
PD-L1 expression missing: no available tumour biopsy specimen for PD-L1 evaluation.  
PD-L1 expression: the percentage of tumour cells demonstrating plasma membrane PD-L1 staining of 
any intensity in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumour cells using the Dako PD-L1 immunohistochemistry 
28-8 pharmDx assay.  
Quantifiable: an available tumour biopsy specimen and the number of viable tumour cells is ≥100 and 
percentage of tumour PD-L1 expression is ≥ 0%. 
Indeterminate: tumour cell membrane staining hampered for reasons attributed to the biology of the 
tumour biopsy specimen and not because of improper sample preparation or handling.  
Not evaluable: tumour biopsy specimen was not optimally collected or prepared (eg, PD-L1 expression 
is neither quantifiable nor indeterminate). 
Baseline characteristics patients with PD-L1 status 
Determination of PD-L1 status was not mandatory for inclusion in the trial and any comparisons are 
therefore exploratory. Pre-treatment tumour tissue from 346 of the 790 (43.8%) randomized 
participants (nivolumab, n=219 [41.6%]; placebo, n=127 [48.1%]) was available for PD-L1 analysis. 
Among these participants, 300 participants (86.7%) were evaluable for PD-L1 expression, including 
Assessment report

189 and 111 participants in the nivolumab and placebo arms, respectively. In the nivolumab arm, 
tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and ≥ 5% were identified in 109 (57.7%) and 59 (31.2%) 
participants, respectively. In the placebo arm, tumour cell PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and ≥ 5% were 
identified in 58 (52.3%) and 33 (29.7%) participants, respectively (Table 22). 
Table 22 Frequency of PD-L1 tumour cell expression status: All randomized subjects
Baseline characteristics were generally balanced in PD-L1 quantifiable and non-quantifiable subgroups 
and the all-randomized subjects, although some imbalances were observed in tumour category, 
geographic region, and melanoma subtype. A higher percentage of subjects in the PD-L1 quantifiable 
group were enrolled from Eastern Europe than the all-randomized subjects (23.0% vs 10.9%). A lower 
percentage of subjects in the PD-L1 quantifiable group had a T stage of T4A at study entry than the 
all-randomized subjects (15.3% vs 21.5%). A higher percentage of subjects in the PD-L1 quantifiable 
group had a melanoma sub-type of nodular melanoma than the all-randomized subjects (59.0% vs 
50.5%). These numerical differences between the PD-L1 quantifiable group and the all-randomized 
subjects were similarly observed within both treatment arms.

RFS by PD-L1 subgroup 
The relative benefit of biomarker-defined subgroups was assessed as an exploratory endpoint. 
Evaluation of treatment effect (nivolumab vs. placebo) on RFS in PD-L1 positive subgroups (≥ median, 
≥ 1%, and ≥ 5%) was limited by the low number of RFS events, precluding the estimation of HRs 
(Table 24). In the PD-L1 negative subgroups (< median, < 1%, and < 5%), treatment benefit from 
nivolumab compared to placebo was observed with HRs below one and wide confidence intervals 
overlapping the ITT HR. For PD L1 analysis as a continuous variable, treatment benefit from nivolumab 
compared to placebo was observed in both the PD-L1 high (HR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.76) and low 
subgroups (HR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.94).

Clinical studies in special populations 
Paediatric population 
The currently applied for extension of the indication includes adolescents aged 12 years and older. 
Another procedure to extent the indication of nivolumab for treatment of adolescent patients aged 12 
years and older with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma (nivolumab as monotherapy or 
in combination with ipilimumab) and adjuvant treatment of melanoma (nivolumab monotherapy) has 
been recently finalised (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G). No adolescents were included in study 
CA20976K which is the pivotal clinical study to support the current extension of the indication.  
The applied for indication for adolescents is based on extrapolation of efficacy from adults to 
adolescents. The MAH justifies the extrapolation based on similarity of disease, understanding of 
adolescent PK and E R safety, and predicted similar E-R efficacy based on expected similar 
pharmacology of drug effect (see also section 2.1.1.). 
Similarity of melanoma between adults and adolescents: 
•  The frequency of histological subtypes in adolescent melanoma, as well as the biology, is 
comparable to melanoma in adults. 
•  Phenotypic traits that are associated with an increased risk of melanoma are similar in adults 
and adolescents with melanoma. The staging system for paediatric and adult melanoma is the 
same. 
•  The treatment of childhood and adolescent melanoma is based on the same principles as for 
adult patients including surgical excision, immune checkpoint inhibitors or BRAF/MEK 
inhibitors.  
•  As in adults, survival is correlated with the disease stage at diagnosis and overall survival (OS) 
is similar between the two age groups. 
By adult melanoma studies, biomarkers that are associated with patient treatment responses on CPI 
have been identified, those include tumour mutation burden (TMB), expression of PD-L1, and CD8 T-
cell infiltration into tumours. Despite these activity in adult melanoma patients, predictions of patient 
responses with high confidence is, according to the MAH, not yet possible. Further efforts are ongoing 
to understand the biology and biomarkers that predict response in adults with high probability. The 
very small number of adolescents with melanoma, if any, included in clinical trials with check point 
inhibitors (CPIs) makes it extremely difficult to evaluate predictive biomarkers accurately. 
A literature review of relative TMB levels in adolescents and non-adolescent melanoma patients was 
provided (data not shown). In the review it is stated that a positive association of TMB, a surrogate 
measure for immunogenic tumour neoantigens arising from UV-irradiation and other genetic 
instabilities, is associated with adult cutaneous melanoma patient CPI treatment response. In total 
seven publications were discussed by the MAH. 
Although some studies have shown that the presence of somatic mutations in BRAF and PTEN were 
higher in the group of adolescents and young adults (15-30 years old) in comparison with older adults, 
overall findings across studies found that conventional melanomas in the adolescent-young adults 
(AYA) patients had a generally similar profile of genetic changes as those of older adults, including UV-
induced SNVs, TMB, CNAs, structural variations and oncogene activating mutations. Genomic profiling 
of other melanoma tumours found in younger patients, included Spitz melanoma (SM), atypical Spitz 
tumours (ATS), were all found to have some features of CMs, albeit a unique subset of features for 
Assessment report

each type and variations in prevalence by study. None had the high level of somatic mutations (TMB) 
of CM. 
The study of van der Kooij et al., found similar profiles of treatment outcomes for CPI or BRAF/MEK 
inhibitor therapies for both AYA and older adult advanced melanoma patients from The Dutch 
Melanoma Treatment Registry (van der Kooij et al. Cancers [Basel]. 2020). 
Supportive study 
As supportive study the MAH presented Study CA209238,a randomized, double-blind, Phase 3 study 
investigating adjuvant therapy with nivolumab 3mg/kg versus ipilimimab 10 mg/kg after complete 
resection of high-risk Stage IIIB/C or IV melanoma (AJCC 7th ed). Patients were enrolled regardless of 
their PD-L1 status. Randomisation was stratified by tumour PD L1 expression (≥ 5% vs. < 
5%/indeterminate), and stage of disease per the AJCC staging system (Stage IIIB/C vs Stage IV M1a-
M1b vs Stage IV M1c). The majority of patients had AJCC Stage III disease (81%). 
At a primary pre-specified interim analysis (minimum follow up 18 months) a statistically significant 
improvement in RFS with nivolumab compared to ipilimumab with HR of 0.65 (97.56% CI: 0.51, 0.83; 
stratified log-rank p<0.0001) was demonstrated (Figure 17). Results from 48-month RFS and DMFS 
analyses were consistent with analyses at 12, 24, and 36 months. Nivolumab showed improvements in 
RFS and DMFS rates by 10.5% and 5.9%, respectively at 48-months compared to ipilimumab, (HRs: 
0.71, 95% CI [0.60, 0.86] and HR: 0.79, 95% CI [0.63, 0.99], respectively). OS rates at 48 months 
were high in both groups (78% and 77%), with no significant difference observed between the two 
groups (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.66-1.14). 
RFS benefit was consistently demonstrated across subgroups, including tumour PD L1-expression, 
BRAF status, and stage of disease (data not shown).

Quality of life (QoL) with nivolumab remained stable and close to baseline values during treatment, as 
assessed by valid and reliable scales like the European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30 and the EQ 5D utility index and VAS. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH is seeking an extension of indication to include: 
“OPDIVO as monotherapy is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents 12 years of 
age and older with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma who have undergone complete resection.” 
The application is based on results from the pivotal study CA20976K. Inclusion of the adolescent 
indication is based on extrapolation of efficacy from adults to adolescents. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study CA20976K is a phase III, randomized, double-blind study of adjuvant immunotherapy with 
nivolumab versus placebo after complete resection of stage IIB/C melanoma (NCT04099251). Within 
Part I, subjects with resected Stage IIB/C melanoma and no evidence of disease were randomized 2:1 
to treatment with either nivolumab or placebo for a duration of 12 months. In the event of disease 
recurrence, subjects had the option to receive on-study open-label nivolumab treatment or receive 
treatment per local standard of care (Part 2). Only results from Part 1 were presented in the current 
submission.  
Target population: The study enrolled subjects with Stage IIB and IIC cutaneous melanoma based on 
the eighth edition of the AJCC melanoma staging system. Eligible patients had tumour category T3b, 
T4a, or T4b, with no regional nodal metastases (N0) confirmed by a negative sentinel lymph node 
biopsy and no evidence of distant metastasis (M0). Prior systemic therapy for Stage II melanoma was 
not allowed, except prior adjuvant treatment with interferon if completed ≥ 6 months prior to 
randomization. All patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Overall, the eligibility criteria adequately define 
the target population, with the general remark that the clinical trial population is relatively fit 
compared with the patient population treated in clinical practice. 
Comparator: Randomization to nivolumab or placebo (2:1) was stratified by AJCC tumour category 
(T3b vs. T4a vs. T4b) which is agreed upon given the prognostic value. The choice of the comparator 
(placebo) is acceptable, as observation with periodic surveillance to detect disease recurrence was 
generally recommended at the time of the start of the study. Adjuvant treatment with pembrolizumab 
has been approved by the CHMP (June 2022; Keytruda II/111 EPAR). 
PD-L1 was not included as a stratification factor based on expected tissue limitations in this early-stage 
patient population at the time of study design and the lack of predictive benefit of PD-L1 expression 
observed in resected Stage III melanoma. Exploratory analyses were planned between PD-L1 
expression and RFS for the subset of patients with tumour specimens available for retrospective 
analysis (different tumour cell PD-L1 cut-offs (i.e., 1% and 5%) and PD-L1 as a continuous variable). 
However, uncertainties remained on the beneficial effect of adjuvant treatment in patients with PD-L1 
expression <1% in patients with stage III/IV Melanoma (study CA209238, Opdivo II/41 EPAR). 
Furthermore, the CHMP concluded that the role of PD-L1 expression and/or other biomarkers on 
efficacy remains to be elucidated and the MAH has been encouraged to further include prospective 
biomarker studies in melanoma subjects (EMEA/H/C/3985/ANX/030). 
Treatment: Adult patients received 480 mg every 4 weeks over 30 minutes up till 12 months. This is in 
line with the approved dose and treatment duration for nivolumab for adjuvant stage IIIC/IV 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023  
Page 59/94 
 
 
 
melanoma. A 60 minutes infusion time is proposed by the MAH in line with the infusion rate for 
adjuvant treatment of stage II/IV melanoma. The MAH also included an additional 30-miutes infusion 
time as used in the pivotal trial (see SmPC). The treatment duration is similar to that of Keytruda 
approved in the same setting. Whether the optimal treatment duration could be shorter than currently 
proposed is unknown as no data are available. 
Tumour assessments were conducted every 26 weeks during years 1-3 and every 52 weeks from 3 
years to 5 years. This is at a similar frequency as in the pivotal study for Keytruda (Keytruda II/111 
EPAR). Tumour assessment was performed by the investigator and central blinded independent central 
review (BICR) was not mandatory. This may be acceptable in the context of a blinded trial, although 
true blinding may be questioned given the known side effects of nivolumab and placebo being the 
comparator. The MAH confirmed that no scans were assessed by a BICR committee. Given that 
immune-related adverse events were also reported in the placebo arm, though at lower frequencies, 
the risk of unblinding may be limited. In addition, given the observed strength of the effect, it is 
considered unlikely that potential misclassification of recurrences would have altered the conclusion of 
the trial. Though acceptable, the rather long, 26-week interval between scans entails that maturation 
of the RFS KM-curves may take long (e.g., all patients with follow-up between 6 months and 12 
months are currently censored at 6 months). 
Clinical endpoints: The primary endpoint investigator-assessed RFS can be considered acceptable for 
the adjuvant setting, provided data are of sufficient maturity and supported by additional endpoints 
enabling a sound conclusion on efficacy and a proper evaluation of the benefit of early (adjuvant) 
versus late treatment (at recurrence). This has been previously accepted for Keytruda in the same 
setting (Keytruda II/111 EPAR). Main secondary endpoints were OS (alpha-controlled) and DMFS 
(descriptive). An interim OS analysis is only expected to occur 8 years after the first patient was 
treated and no OS data were currently provided. As the ultimate goal of adjuvant treatment is cure 
and OS data are needed to better understand whether adjuvant nivolumab increases OS or only delays 
the progression of disease, these data are considered key to the benefit-risk. The MAH committed to 
submit interim OS results for study CA20976K with a current estimated timeline of 1Q 2029 for 
submission (as an Annex II condition to the marketing authorisation). An impact analysis of Part 2 on 
OS and any other time-dependent endpoints is expected at the time these data become available, 
taking into account available guidance (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-
guideline/question-answer-adjustment-cross-over-estimating-effects-oncology-trials_en.pd). DMFS is 
considered supportive for RFS and may be considered a more clinically relevant representative for 
long-term benefit, as melanoma is generally considered to be incurable when distant metastasis is 
present. PFS2 may also provide some information on the long-term benefit in the absence of OS data. 
Overall, the primary and secondary endpoints are considered established in the adjuvant setting and 
thus acceptable. 
Statistical methods: For the primary analysis (RFS), two intercurrent events are identified (‘new 
anticancer therapy […]’ and ‘second non-melanoma primary cancer […]’), and subjects are censored at 
the last assessment date prior to their occurrence. A treatment policy strategy for the intercurrent 
events was included as a sensitivity analysis in line with the EMA guideline (Appendix 1 to the guideline 
on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man (europa.eu). In addition, the selected 
strategy to handle missing data due to missed disease assessments, i.e. censoring at baseline, may 
introduce a bias in the effect estimates. This is further discussed with the results. 
The primary analysis for the time-to-event RFS outcome is a log-rank test and Cox proportional 
hazards model, both stratified by AJCC tumour category (corresponding to the randomization 
procedure), which is acceptable. The currently presented interim analysis of RFS was planned when 
approximately 123 RFS events (80% information fraction) had been reached among all randomized 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023  
Page 60/94 
 
 
 
subjects. The statistical methods are considered overall adequate. However, interim analyses on PFS-
like endpoints are not recommended (EMA/CHMP/27994/2008/Rev.1). 
Baseline characteristics 
A total of 986 subjects were enrolled, 790 were randomized, and 788 were treated: 524 with 
nivolumab and 264 with placebo. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the two 
groups. The median age was 62 years (range 19 to 92), 61% were men, and 98% were white. About 
14% of patients were ≥75 years of age, whereas no adolescents were included in the study. Baseline 
ECOG PS score was 0 (94%) or 1 (6%). Sixty percent had stage IIB and 40% had stage IIC disease, 
39% of patients had tumour category T3b or T4b, and 21% had T4a. PD-L1 expression data were 
evaluable for 189 (35.9%) patients in the nivolumab arm and 111 (42.0%) patients in the placebo 
arm. BRAF mutation status was available for 658 (83.3%) patients, 429 patients had BRAF Wild Type. 
In general, the conduct of the study does not seem to raise any serious concerns which could have 
introduced any important biases in the analyses of the primary efficacy parameters. Important protocol 
deviations were balanced between treatment groups and were mostly in the category of trial 
procedures. 
Adolescents 
No adolescents were included in the pivotal study. The applied for indication for adolescents is based 
on extrapolation of efficacy from adults to adolescents. The MAH justifies the extrapolation based on 
similarity of disease, understanding of adolescent PK and E-R safety, and predicted similar E-R efficacy 
based on expected similar pharmacology of drug effect. Extrapolation of adult efficacy data, is already 
accepted for several products intended for the treatment of advanced melanoma and for the treatment 
of melanoma in the adjuvant setting (Yervoy II/44 EPAR; Opdualag MAA EPAR; Keytruda II/0111 
EPAR). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At the time of DCO (28 June 2022) for the planned interim RFS analysis, the median duration of 
treatment was 11 months. Median follow-up time was approximately 16 months and minimum follow-
up time was 8 months. Approximately 50% and 60% of patients completed treatment in the nivolumab 
and placebo arm, respectively, whereas 12-15% of patients are ongoing on treatment. More patients 
discontinued nivolumab compared to placebo (38.7% vs. 25.4%), and mostly due to study drug 
toxicity (17.9% nivolumab vs. 2.7% placebo) as expected. Minimum follow-up is much shorter than 
the anticipated minimum follow-up of approximately 24 months for the IA of RFS, limiting the 
conclusions that can be drawn from these data. 
Primary endpoint – Recurrence-Free survival 
The study met its primary endpoint as a statistically significant improvement in RFS for patients 
randomised to the nivolumab arm compared with placebo was observed at the time of the RFS IA: HR 
0.42 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.59; log-rank p-value < 0.0001). RFS rates were higher in the nivolumab arm 
than in the placebo arm at 6 months (97.6% vs 93.5%), and at 12 months (92.3% vs 86.7%). Both 
regional and distant metastases occurred less frequently with nivolumab. However, follow-up time was 
too limited and no conclusions could be drawn on the (long-term) clinical benefit in the target 
population. Upon request, the MAH presented updated efficacy analyses based on a DCO of 21 
February2023, resulting in a median follow-up of approximately 24 months and a minimum follow-up 
of 15.6 months. The results with longer follow-up support the initial efficacy analysis with a HR of 0.53 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023  
Page 61/94 
 
 
 
 
(95% CI: 0.40-0.71) based on an event rate of 19.4% vs. 31.8% in the nivolumab and placebo arm, 
respectively. RFS rates were 88.8% in the nivolumab arm and 81.1% in the placebo arm at 12 months 
of follow-up. Corresponding RFS rates at 18 months were 83.9% in the nivolumab arm and 70.7% in 
the placebo arm. Results in subgroups were in general consistent with the ITT, with all RFS HR point 
estimates <1. The RFS rates and median follow-up resemble that available at the time of approval of 
Keytruda in the same indication (IA3 RFS rates of 19.5% for Keytruda vs 28.5% for placebo at IA3 
with a median follow-up 26.9 months; Keytruda II/111 EPAR). Due to the long interval between 
imaging assessments (6 months), the impact of the limited follow-up is aggravated resulting in 
censoring focused on 6, 12, 18, etc months. Also, separation of the curves seems only to occur (as 
anticipated by the MAH) after 6 months and separation thereafter is uncertain due to the censoring in 
both treatment arms. With longer follow-up, there were no indications of imbalances in reasons for 
censoring over time. Most patients were censored on the date of their last tumour assessment and 
remained in the study. Few patients were censored due to “off study” at 6 and 12 months which could 
have been potential informative censoring. However, given the low numbers this is not likely to impact 
the obtained results. With the updated results, the RFS events (186) exceed the number of 154 events 
planned for the final RFS analysis. Overall, updated results on event and censoring rates support the 
benefit in terms of RFS observed at the IA RFS analysis. The current data allow a robust estimation of 
the KM-curves up till 12 months, data thereafter are uncertain given the high censoring rates. Updated 
results with a median follow-up of 36 months could provide robust data up till around 27 months. 
These are considered of relevance as current data do not allow a conclusion on a potential plateau 
around 36 months of follow-up. Plus, OS data will only become available in the long term. These 
updated results with a median follow-up of 36 months can be provided post-marketing and the 
applicant already committed to provide these data with an estimated timeline of 4Q 2024 as a 
recommendation (REC). 
Sensitivity analyses, including the analysis in which a treatment policy strategy was employed for the 
intercurrent events (‘new anticancer therapy […]’ and ‘second non-melanoma primary cancer […]’), 
supported the primary RFS analysis, although their relevance is limited by the limited number of 
events observed. Relatively few subjects (14 out of 526 and 3 out of 264) have been censored at 
baseline due to missing disease assessments, which, in light of the observed difference in the KM 
curves, is not expected to alter the conclusions regarding the primary analysis. 
Subgroup analyses in pre-specified subgroups showed similar effects for adjuvant nivolumab as seen 
for the ITT population, including the subgroups according to disease stage and tumour category. PD L1 
subgroup analyses were presented separately and performed in a subset of patients only. There were 
some imbalances in baseline characteristics with more patients from Eastern Europe, more nodular 
disease and less T4a tumours in patients with available PD-L1 data versus the ITT. Event rates were 
low and no HR could be obtained in patients with high PD-L1 expression (≥1% or ≥5%), hampering 
the interpretation of the results. For patients with low PD-L1 expression (<1% or < 5%), point 
estimates of HR were below one although higher than for the ITT (PD-L1<1%: HR=0.71 vs ITT: 
HR=0.43), however the 95% CIs overlap considerably. Given the low event rate and the exploratory 
comparisons, results are difficult to interpret. No restrictions with regard to PD-L1 expression were 
made in the adjuvant stage III/IV setting despite some concerns on the benefit in patients with low 
PD-L1 expression (Opdivo II/41 EPAR), and uncertainty remains on PD-L1 as a predictive marker. An 
update of RFS per PD-L1 expression subgroup based on the DCO 21-Feb-2023 was provided. Point 
estimates of the HR in both subgroups were below 1, which was reassuring. The RFS rate at 12 months 
in the PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% subgroup was numerically higher in the nivolumab arm compared to the 
placebo arm, 93.3% vs 77.0% (HR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.84) supporting a beneficial effect. On the 
other hand, the RFS rate at 12 months in the PD-L1 expression < 1% subgroup was numerically lower 
for nivolumab compared to placebo, 79.5% vs 84.1% (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.44, 1.54). KM curves 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023  
Page 62/94 
 
 
 
show no beneficial effect of nivolumab over placebo up till 24 months in the PD-L1 expression <1% 
subgroup, thereafter curves separate in favor of nivolumab but censoring rates are high. A clear 
separation of KM curves in favor of nivolumab is shown in the PD-L1 ≥1% subgroup, whereas the KM 
curve in subjects with indeterminate/not reported/not evaluable PD-L1 at baseline resemble that of the 
ITT as may be expected. Overall, uncertainty remains on a beneficial effect in the PD-L1 <1% 
subgroup. However, given the low event rate, non-stratified comparisons and data available for only a 
subset of the ITT (<40%) no firm conclusions can be drawn. Updated results are expected with the 36 
month update (REC). 
Secondary endpoints 
An improvement in distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was seen with adjuvant nivolumab 
compared to placebo (HR = 0.47 [95% CI: 0.30, 0.72]) and DMFS rates were numerically higher 
(92.3% vs. 86.7% at 12 months). Although the results for DMFS are not part of the formal testing 
procedure, it is considered unlikely that these results constitute a chance finding due to the 
consistency with the results of the primary analysis, the clear separation of the KM curves, the 
estimate of the HR, and the result of the log-rank test. The results were confirmed with longer 
follow-up with 13.1% and 19.3% of events in the nivolumab vs the placebo arm (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 
0.43, 0.89), DMFS rates were 92.0% and 88.5% at 12 months, respectively. The results of all DMFS 
sensitivity analyses were consistent with the DMFS primary analysis (data not shown). 
Progression on next line treatment can provide some information on the likelihood for sustained 
clinical benefit for patients with recurrence after adjuvant melanoma. More patients with recurrence in 
the nivolumab arm received radiation therapy and surgery compared to the placebo arm where 
patients in the placebo arm more often received systemic treatment and especially anti-PD-(L)1 
therapy, as may be expected. Duration of treatment on next-line systemic cancer treatment was lower 
for nivolumab compared to placebo, which may be explained by the differences in type of subsequent 
therapy. Relatively few PFS2 events were currently observed, the HR numerically favoured nivolumab 
over placebo (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.36, 1.27). Comparable results were observed with longer follow-up 
in favour of nivolumab (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.40, 1.01), however event rates were still limited (7.6% 
and 11.7% in the nivolumab and placebo arm, respectively). 
The results from the exploratory endpoints freedom from relapse and treatment-free interval 
are in line with the other efficacy data showing a beneficial effect of adjuvant nivolumab treatment 
(data not shown). 
Exploratory analyses of quality of life using the questionnaires EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D 
showed a trend for a reduction in mean change score from baseline over time in both treatment arms 
and numerically somewhat larger for the nivolumab arm. Nevertheless, CIs largely overlap and the 
MID was not reached at any time for either treatment group. PRO’s from blinded trials may be 
considered for inclusion in the SmPC, provided they are pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan, 
unbiased and reliable, and type 1 error controlled. Even though CA209076K was a double-blind study, 
blinding may be questioned given the known side effects of nivolumab and placebo being the 
comparator. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the QoL results were truly unbiased and reliable. 
Moreover, the QoL results were not type 1 error controlled. As a result, the above QoL data do not 
qualify for inclusion in section 5.1. of the SmPC. 
Supportive study  
Study CA209238 was the registrational study for the adjuvant treatment of nivolumab vs ipilimumab 
after complete resection of high-risk Stage IIIB/C or IV melanoma (AJCC 7th ed). A pre-specified 
interim analysis (minimum follow-up 18 months) showed a statistically significant improvement in RFS 
that was confirmed with longer follow-up time up to 48 months and supported by DMFS. No effect was

Page 63/94 
 
 
 
seen on OS. These data underline the immaturity of the current data with a minimum follow-up of only 
8 months in an earlier setting. It is reassuring that no “rebound” effect for nivolumab was seen in the 
later stage setting after the adjuvant treatment-phase. Whether this applies to the earlier setting 
needs to be seen based on longer follow-up time. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
No adolescents were included in study CA20976K, therefore efficacy of Opdivo as adjuvant treatment 
in adolescents needs to be supported by full extrapolation of efficacy data from the adult population to 
the adolescent population. Recently, the indication of nivolumab was extended for treatment of 
adolescent patients aged 12 years and older with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma 
(nivolumab as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab) and adjuvant treatment of melanoma 
(nivolumab monotherapy) (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G).  
The extrapolation of the efficacy of nivolumab treatment to the adolescent part of the applied-for 
target population is considered acceptable. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In study CA20976K, adjuvant treatment with nivolumab showed a statistically significant effect on 
recurrence-free survival compared to placebo in the target population. Results were supported by a 
numerical reduction in distant metastases. With the updated results with a median follow-up of 
approximately 24 months, the current data are considered sufficient to conclude on a beneficial effect 
on RFS. Moreover, it is considered likely that the obtained results translate into a long-term beneficial 
effect of adjuvant nivolumab. Some uncertainty exists on the RFS KM-curves beyond 12 months 
though, due to the censoring rate. Therefore, further long-term efficacy data should be provided post-
approval, including OS data. As the ultimate goal of adjuvant treatment is cure, OS data are needed to 
better understand whether adjuvant nivolumab increases OS or only delays the progression of disease, 
these data are considered key to the benefit/risk. The OS analysis was not available during this 
procedure and is included as an Annex II condition.  
Therefore, the MAH will provide the following results from study CA20976K post-marketing: 
-  4Q 2024 - Updated RFS analysis including subgroup analysis as well as DMFS (REC) 
-  1Q 2029 – Interim OS analysis (Annex II.D) 
The proposed bridging strategy in support of a paediatric indication is considered acceptable. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterise the efficacy of nivolumab as 
adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with stage IIB or stage IIC 
melanoma, the MAH should submit the OS data from the first interim OS analysis of the Phase III 
study CA20976K (1Q 2029).

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data from the pivotal Phase 3 Study CA20976K was submitted to support the use of nivolumab 
as monotherapy in the adjuvant setting of Stage Iib/C melanoma following complete resection. The 
safety data from study CA20976K included 524 patients that were treated with nivolumab. The safety 
results of Study CA20976K were compared with pooled safety data (n=4646 treated patients) of all 
studies conducted in different tumour types with nivolumab monotherapy.  
Patient exposure 
Adult melanoma patients randomized to the nivolumab arm received 480 mg Q4W as a 30 min-
infusion.  
The planned dosing for adolescents 12 years of age and older weighing ≥40 kg was the same as the 
adult dose. The planned dose for adolescents (12 years of age and older and weighing < 40 kg) 6 
mg/kg Q4W over 60 min. However, no adolescents were included in the study.  
The planned treatment duration in the study was 12 months. 
The median number of nivolumab doses received was 12 (range: 1 – 14) and the median number of 
placebo doses received was 13 (range: 1-14) (Table 28). The proportion of treated patients who 
received ≥ 90% of the planned nivolumab dose intensity was 89.7%. 
The median duration of therapy was 11.04 months in the nivolumab arm and 11.07 months in the 
placebo arm (Table 29).

Dose Modifications and Dose Delays 
Of all treated patients in the blinded phase, the majority received all doses of study drug without dose 
delays, infusion interruptions, or infusion rate reductions.  
Dose reductions were not permitted with nivolumab or placebo. 
Dose delays of study drug (proportion of patients with at least 1 dose delay) were reported in 36.3% 
patients in the nivolumab arm and 33.3% patients in the placebo arm. The majority of dose delays 
lasted 4-7 days. The most common cause of dose delay in the nivolumab arm was ‘adverse event’. 26 
(5.0%) and 14 (5.3%) patients had at least one dose delayed due to COVID-19 in the nivolumab and 
placebo arms, respectively. 
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs of any grade leading to dose delay were as follows:  
•  Nivolumab arm: diarrhea (1.7%), arthralgia (1.5%), ALT increased and blood CPK increased 
(1.3% each) 
•  Placebo arm: diarrhea (1.1%), ALT increased, blood CPK increased and AST increased (0.8% 
each) 
For 6.7% of patients a nivolumab infusion interruption was reported. Of the patients who were 
reported with infusion interruption, the majority were reported with 1 interrupted infusion. Reasons for 
infusion interruption included hypersensitivity reaction and administration issues. 
Infusion rate reductions were reported in 3.1% patients in the nivolumab arm. Reasons for infusion 
rate reductions included hypersensitivity reaction and administration issues. 
Adverse events 
Adverse Events (Regardless of Causality) 
Any-grade AEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 502 (95.8%) patients in the nivolumab arm, 
and 229 (86.7%) patients in the placebo arm (Table 30).

Drug-Related Adverse Events  
Any-grade drug-related AEs were reported in 433 (82.6%) patients in the nivolumab arm and 142 
(53.8%) patients in the placebo arm. 
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs were as follows: 
•  Nivolumab arm: fatigue (20.2%), pruritus (18.5%), and diarrhoea (15.3%) 
•  Placebo arm: fatigue (20.1%), pruritus, and diarrhoea (9.5% each) 
Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were reported in 54 (10.3%) patients in the nivolumab arm, and 6 (2.3%) 
patients in the placebo arm. 
The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs were as follows:  
•  Nivolumab arm: AST increased and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (1.1% each) 
•  Placebo arm: lipase increased (1.1%) 
Selected Adverse Events 
Selected Adverse Events included AEs in the categories; endocrine, gastrointestinal, hepatic, 
pulmonary, renal, skin and hypersensitivity/infusion reactions (Table 23).  
Selected AEs were reported more frequently in the nivolumab arm than the placebo arm. Most selected 
AEs reported were Grade 1-2 and most were considered drug-related by the investigator. The most 
frequently reported drug-related selected AE categories (any grade) in each treatment arm were as 
follows: 
•  Nivolumab arm: skin (34.5%), endocrine (20.6%), and gastrointestinal (16.2%) 
•  Placebo arm: skin (17.8%), gastrointestinal (9.5%), and hepatic (6.1%) 
The five most frequently reported drug-related selected AEs by preferred term (PT) (any grade) in 
each treatment arm were as follows: 
•  Nivolumab arm: pruritus (18.5%); diarrhoea (15.3%); rash (10.9%), hypothyroidism 
(10.3%), ALT increased (6.3%) 
Assessment report

•  Placebo arm: pruritus (9.5%); diarrhoea (9.5%); rash (6.8%), ALT increased (4.9%); AST 
increased (2.3%) 
There were few drug-related serious selected AEs (any grade) reported in either arm, with no more 
than 2 patients with the same event. 
Across the selected AE categories, with the exception of endocrine events, most events in the 
nivolumab arm resolved using the established algorithms. Less than half (41.7%) of patients with 
endocrine selected AEs were reported to have event resolution at data cut-off.

Nivolumab Treated Patients (N=524) 
Adverse Events in CA20976K and Across Pooled Monotherapy Studies 
The frequencies of any grade, all-causality, and drug-related AEs were comparable in nivolumab 
treated subjects in CA20976K when compared with the pooled nivolumab monotherapy studies 
excluding CA20976K and all pooled nivolumab monotherapy studies (including CA20976K). 
•  Any grade all-causality AEs frequencies were similar in nivolumab monotherapy treated 
patients in CA20976K vs pooled studies excluding CA20976K and vs pooled studies including 
CA20976K. 
•  Drug-related AEs frequencies for any grade were higher in nivolumab monotherapy treated 
patients in CA20976K vs pooled studies excluding CA20976K vs pooled studies including 
CA20976K (82.6% vs 74.4% vs 75.3%, respectively). Frequencies for the most of PTs were 
similar between CA20976K nivolumab monotherapy and pooled studies, excluding few 
frequencies with an absolute difference of minimum 2% and maximum 4% (Table 33). 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023

Overall, the safety data of the CA20976K safety data is considered comparable with the safety data of 
the nivolumab monotherapy pool.

Grade, Grade 3-4, Grade 5) with 5% Cutoff All Treated Patients with Nivolumab monotherapy Types
Immune-Mediated Adverse Events (IMAEs) 
IMAEs were reported more frequently in the nivolumab arm than the placebo arm. Overall, most IMAEs 
were Grade 1-2, excluding hepatitis, nephritis, hypophysitis, and diabetes mellitus (Table 34). The 
most frequently reported IMAEs (any grade) by category in each treatment arm were as follows: 
•  Nivolumab arm: hypothyroidism/thyroiditis (12.2%), rash (8.6%), and hyperthyroidism 
(7.6%) 
•  Placebo arm: hyperthyroidism (1.5%), rash (1.5%), and adrenal insufficiency (1.1%) 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023

Across IMAE categories, most non-endocrine IMAEs were manageable using established algorithms, 
with resolution occurring when immune-modulating medication (commonly systemic corticosteroids) 
was administered. Except for hyperthyroidism, many endocrine IMAEs were not considered resolved at 
the time of DBL due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy.

Other Events of Special Interest (OESIs) 
OESIs were reported in 21/524 patients in the nivolumab arm, including pancreatitis, uveitis, 
myocarditis, and myositis/rhabdomyolysis categories. The frequency of all OESI categories (any grade; 
any causality) with nivolumab was < 1%, except for myositis/rhabdomyolysis (1.5%) and pancreatitis 
(1.5%). Most of the OESIs in the nivolumab arm were considered drug-related by the investigator. 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023

Drug-related OESIs in the nivolumab arm included myositis/rhabdomyolysis (1.5%), pancreatitis 
(1.3%), myocarditis (0.6%), and uveitis (0.2%). 
In the placebo arm, OESIs were reported in 2 (0.8%) patients. The events were rhabdomyolysis in 
both patients and were considered to be drug-related by the investigator.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Any-grade SAEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 74 (14.1%) patients in the nivolumab arm 
vs 29 (11.0%) patients in the placebo arm (Table 25). Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 55 (10.5%) 
patients in the nivolumab arm and 20 (7.6%) patients in the placebo arm. 
The frequency of all reported SAEs were < 1% in both the nivolumab and placebo arms. 
The most frequently reported SAEs (regardless of causality) were as follows (Table 35): 
•  Nivolumab arm: COVID-19 (0.8%), ALT increased, AST increased, and pulmonary embolism 
(0.6% each) 
•  Placebo arm: melanoma recurrent and invasive breast carcinoma (0.8% each)

Any-grade drug-related SAEs were reported in 25 (4.8%) patients in the nivolumab arm, and 3 (1.1%) 
patients in the placebo arm. Grade 3-4 drug related SAEs were reported in 23 (4.4%) patients in the 
nivolumab arm, and 2 (0.8%) patients in the placebo arm. 
The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs were as follows: 
•  Nivolumab arm: colitis, diarrhoea, adrenal insufficiency, and myocarditis (0.4% each) 
•  Placebo arm: rhabdomyolysis, hepatitis and AST increased (0.4% each) 
Deaths 
As of the 28-June-2022 data cutoff, 13 (2.5%) treated patients in the nivolumab arm and 8 (3.0%) in 
the placebo arms had died (Table 36). One additional death occurred in the nivolumab arm prior to the 
data cut-off, but was reported after the database lock for a total of 14 (2.7%) deaths.   
There was 1 patient (0.2%) who died due to study drug toxicity in the nivolumab arm. The patient 
developed a Grade 3 vasculitic skin rash 3 days after the first dose of nivolumab, as well as cervical 
lymphadenopathy that was confirmed as non-metastatic, with fibrous and lymphadenitic changes only. 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023

The rash resolved with topical steroids, however the patient developed rising creatinine levels and was 
hospitalized due to Grade 4 acute kidney injury (requiring haemodialysis and intravenous steroids), 
Grade 3 anaemia and thrombocytopenia (all events related to therapy). Study therapy was 
discontinued. The patient continued to deteriorate with gastrointestinal bleeding, and cardiac failure; 
coronary angiography reported re-stenosis of coronary vessels (the subject had past medical history of 
cardiac bypass). The patient was resuscitated after a cardiac arrest, however continued to deteriorate 
with Grade 4 sepsis, multiorgan failure and culminating in death, 123 days after the first and only dose 
of nivolumab. The cause of death was reported as heart failure and acute kidney failure. 
There was one Grade 5 event in each treatment arm that was not a drug-related SAE; myocardial 
ischemia was reported in the nivolumab arm and sudden death in the placebo arm. Only events that 
led to death within 24 hours were documented as Grade 5. Events leading to death > 24 hours after 
onset were reported with the worst grade before death and captured in the death listing.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Abnormalities in haematology tests performed during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study 
drug were as anticipated and were primarily Grade 1 2 in the nivolumab and placebo arms. No Grade 3 
4 haematologic abnormalities were reported in ≥2% of patients in either arm. 
Liver Tests 
During the treatment period, abnormalities in hepatic parameters (increases) were as anticipated and 
were primarily Grade 1 2. Grade 3 4 hepatic abnormalities were reported in 4.3% in the nivolumab 
arm and 0.8% of patients in the placebo arm. No patients in either arm were reported with concurrent 
elevated ALT or AST and elevated total bilirubin. 
Thyroid Tests 
Most patients were reported with normal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at baseline and 
throughout the treatment period. TSH increases (> ULN) from baseline (≤ ULN) and TSH decreases (< 
LLN) from baseline (≥ LLN) were reported more frequently in the nivolumab arm than in the placebo 
arm, as expected. 
Kidney Function Tests 
Most patients with at least one on-treatment measurement were reported with normal creatinine 
values during the treatment reporting period. Abnormalities in creatinine (increases) were as 
anticipated and were primarily Grade 1 2. Grade 3 increases in creatinine were reported in 2 (0.4%) 
patients in the nivolumab arm and no patients in the placebo arm. No Grade 4 increases in creatinine 
were reported.

Safety in special populations 
In the blinded phase, the frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivolumab and 
placebo arms for subgroups of gender, race, and age, were similar to AE frequencies reported for the 
overall study population by treatment (Table 38).  
By Age: 
• 
Frequencies of all-causality AEs and drug-related AEs were comparable by age category (< 65, 
≥ 65 - < 75, and ≥ 75 - < 85) within each treatment arm. 
•  Due to a very small sample size of patients in the ≥ 85 age category in nivolumab and placebo 
arms, the interpretability is limited. 
By Sex: 
• 
Frequencies of all-causality AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs were slightly higher in males than females 
in the nivolumab arm. 
•  The drug-related AE rates were generally similar by sex in both nivolumab and placebo arms. 
By Race: 
• 
For subgroups based on race, most of the patients were classified as “White” with frequencies 
of all-causality AEs and drug-related AEs of any grade and Grade 3-4 consistent with that 
reported in the overall study population.  
•  Very low sample sizes in other categories of race, such as “Black” or “African American”, 
“Asian” and “Other”, limit the interpretability of potential differences. 
By Region: 
•  Subgroup analyses by region showed that most of the patients were located in Western Europe 
with frequencies of all-causality AEs and drug-related AEs of any grade and Grade 3-4 
consistent with that reported in the overall study population.

Safety to Support Use in Adolescents 
The safety of nivolumab has been evaluated in adolescent patients (≥ 12 to < 18 years old) in the 
extension of the indication for nivolumab as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab for the 
treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults and adolescents 12 years of 
age and older, and for nivolumab as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of adults and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older with melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes or metastatic 
disease who have undergone complete resection (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G). 
Melanoma in adolescents and adults is generally regarded as an analogous disease and is treated 
similarly using multimodal therapy including surgery, systemic therapy, and in some cases, radiation.

As such, current treatment strategies for pediatric and adolescent melanoma are based on clinical 
guidelines for adult patients and there are limited clinical studies evaluating treatment outcomes in 
these age groups. Despite the small number of patients, results of these studies suggested that safety 
profiles and treatment effects in pediatric patients are comparable with adult patients.  
Within the aforementioned procedure (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G), safety data for the use of 
nivolumab monotherapy and in combination with ipilimumab in adolescents have been provided from 
study CA209070, a phase I/II study of nivolumab in children, adolescents, and young adults with 
recurrent or refractory solid tumours as a single agent and in combination with ipilimumab 
(NCT02304458). This study did not enroll any adolescent melanoma patient to be treated with the 
combination and the dosing used is not the same, as approved for melanoma adult patients, which is 
also the one proposed for the extension of the indication to treat adolescents.  
For these reasons, the safety assessment in the current application relies mainly in a full extrapolation 
approach based on clinical data in adults from the already assessed studies CA209067 (NCT01844505) 
and CA209238 (NCT02388906), in addition to study CA209915 which was conducted in the adjuvant 
setting and included two adolescents treated with nivolumab monotherapy (NCT03068455). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Any-grade AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality) were reported in 91 (17.4%) 
patients in the nivolumab arm, and 9 (3.4%) patients in the placebo arm (Table 39). Most AEs leading 
to discontinuation were Grade 1-2. Grade 3 4 AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 37 
(7.1%) patients in the nivolumab arm, and 2 (0.8%) patients in the placebo arm. 
The most common AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality) were as follows:  
•  Nivolumab arm: arthralgia (1.7%) and diarrhoea, ALT increased, and AST increased (1.1% 
each) 
•  Placebo arm: ALT increased and AST increased (0.8% each) 
Any-grade drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 77 (14.7%) patients in the 
nivolumab arm, and 7 (2.7%) patients in the placebo arm. Most drug-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation were Grade 1-2. Grade 3, 4 AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 29 (5.5%) 
patients in the nivolumab arm, and 2 (0.8%) patients in the placebo arm. 
The most common drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were as follows: 
•  Nivolumab arm: arthralgia (1.7%) and diarrhoea (1.1%) 
•  Placebo arm: ALT increased and AST increased (0.8% each)

Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity samples were collected at regular intervals in pivotal Study CA20976K. In subjects 
who were evaluable for anti-drug antibodies (ADA), the incidence of nivolumab ADA was 3.2% 
(12/378) at baseline and 2.6% (10/378) after the start of treatment. Among the post-treatment ADA 
positive subjects, 0.5% (2/378) of the ADA evaluable subjects were considered persistently positive 
(had an ADA positive sample at two or more consecutive timepoints, where the first and last ADA-
positive samples are at least 16 weeks apart), and 0.5% (2/378) of the ADA evaluable subjects were 
neutralizing ADA positive. Data on neutralizing antibodies for Study CA20976K were provided in an 
addendum to the CA20976K clinical study report (CSR). ADA positivity did not appear to impact 
hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions of adjuvant nivolumab treatment in subjects with 
completely resected Stage IIB/C melanoma. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data from the pivotal Phase 3 Study CA20976K was submitted to support the use of nivolumab 
as monotherapy in the adjuvant setting of Stage IIB/C melanoma following complete resection. The 
safety data from study CA20976K included 524 patients that were treated with nivolumab and 264 
patients that were treated with placebo.  
Further, the safety results of Study CA20976K were compared with pooled safety data (n=4646 
treated patients) of all study conducted in different tumour types with nivolumab monotherapy. 
Adult melanoma patients randomized to the nivolumab arm received 480 mg Q4W as a 30 min-
infusion.  
The planned dosing for adolescents 12 years of age and older weighing ≥40 kg was the same as the 
adult dose. The planned dose for adolescents (12 years of age and older and weighing < 40 kg) 6 
mg/kg Q4W over 60 min. However no adolescents were included in the study.  
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023  
Page 82/94 
 
 
 
 
In line with the current information in the Opdivo SmPC, dose reductions were not permitted with 
nivolumab or placebo. Dose delays of study drug (proportion of patients with at least 1 dose delay) 
were reported in 36.3% patients in the nivolumab arm and 33.3% patients in the placebo arm. 
The planned treatment duration in the study was 12 months. The median number of nivolumab doses 
received was 12 (range: 1 – 14) and the median number of placebo doses received was 13 (range: 1-
14). The proportion of treated patients who received ≥ 90% of the planned nivolumab dose intensity 
was 89.7%. The median duration of therapy was 11.04 months in the nivolumab arm and 11.07 
months in the placebo arm.  
It is noted that 17 patients in the nivolumab arm and 10 patients in placebo arm, had a treatment 
duration of more than 12 months, as the planned treatment duration in the study was 12 months. 
These were reported as protocol deviations, and not considered to impact efficacy or safety. 
Adverse events 
Any-grade AEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 502 (95.8%) patient in the nivolumab arm, 
and 229 (86.7%) patients in the placebo arm. Drug-related any-grade AEs in 433 (82.6%) patients in 
the nivolumab, and 142 (53.8%) patients in the placebo arms. The most frequently reported AEs 
(regardless of causality) were for the patients treated with nivolumab; fatigue (26.1%), diarrhoea 
(22.5%), and pruritus (20.0%). The most frequently reported AEs in the placebo arm were; fatigue 
(25.0%), diarrhoea (15.2%), and headache (12.5%).  
Grade 3-4 AEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 115 (21.9%) patients in the nivolumab arm, 
and 32 (12.1%) patients in the placebo arm. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 AEs (regardless 
of causality) were for patients treated with nivolumab; blood creatinine phosphokinase increased 
(1.9%), ALT increased, AST increased, and hypertension (1.5% each), while in the placebo arm the 
most frequently reported AE was headache (0.8%). 
The frequencies of any grade, all-causality, and drug-related AEs were comparable for nivolumab 
treated subjects in CA20976K with what is reported for the pooled data-set including safety data of 
other clinical studies with nivolumab monotherapy. 
In the blinded phase, the frequencies of all-causality and drug-related AEs in the nivolumab and 
placebo arms for subgroups of gender, race, and age, were similar to AE frequencies reported for the 
overall study population by treatment. 
Selected Adverse events 
Selected AEs included the usual categories along nivolumab clinical development: endocrine, 
gastrointestinal, hepatic, pulmonary, renal, skin, and hypersensitivity/infusion reactions. Selected AEs 
were reported more frequently in the nivolumab arm than the placebo arm. Most selected AEs reported 
were Grade 1-2 and most were considered drug-related by the investigator. The most frequently 
reported drug-related selected AE categories (any grade) were for patients treated with nivolumab; 
skin (34.5%), endocrine (20.6%), and gastrointestinal (16.2%). For patients included in the placebo 
arm, the most frequently reported AE categories (any grade) were skin (17.8%), gastrointestinal 
(9.5%), and hepatic (6.1%).  
Immune-Mediated Adverse Events 
Immune-Mediated Adverse Events (IMAEs) were also more frequently reported in the nivolumab arm 
than in the placebo arm. The most frequently reported IMAEs (any grade) by category in each 
treatment arm were for the nivolumab arm; hypothyroidism/thyroiditis (12.2%), rash (8.6%), and 
hyperthyroidism (7.6%) and for the placebo arm; hyperthyroidism (1.5%), rash (1.5%), and adrenal 
insufficiency (1.1%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023  
Page 83/94 
 
 
 
Across IMAE categories, most non-endocrine IMAEs were manageable using established algorithms, 
with resolution occurring when immune-modulating medication (commonly systemic corticosteroids) 
was administered. Except for hyperthyroidism, many endocrine IMAEs were not considered resolved at 
time of DBL due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy. 
Other Events of Special Interest events 
Other Events of Special Interest (OESIs) were reported in 21/524 patients in the nivolumab arm, 
including pancreatitis, uveitis, myocarditis, and myositis/rhabdomyolysis categories. Frequency of all 
OESI categories (any grade; any causality) with nivolumab were < 1%, except for 
myositis/rhabdomyolysis (1.5%) and pancreatitis (1.5%). Most of the OESIs in the nivolumab arm 
were considered drug-related by the investigator. 
Serious Adverse events 
Any-grade SAEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 74 (14.1%) patients in the nivolumab arm 
vs 29 (11.0%) patients in the placebo arm. Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 55 (10.5%) patients in 
the nivolumab arm and 20 (7.6%) patients in the placebo arm. The most frequently reported SAEs 
(regardless of causality) were for patients treated with nivolumab COVID-19 (0.8%), ALT increased, 
AST increased, and pulmonary embolism (0.6% each) and for patients in the placebo arm; melanoma 
recurrent and invasive breast carcinoma (0.8% each).  
Deaths 
As of the 28-June-2022 data cut-off, 13 (2.5%) treated patients in the nivolumab arm and 8 (3.0%) in 
the placebo arms had died. One additional death occurred in the nivolumab arm prior to the data cut-
off, but was reported after the database lock for a total of 14 (2.7%) deaths. Three patients in the 
nivolumab arm and 4 patients in the placebo arm died due to progressive disease (melanoma). There 
was one Grade 5 event in each treatment arm that was not a drug-related SAE; myocardial ischemia 
was reported in the nivolumab arm and sudden death in the placebo arm. Further most frequent cause 
of death was “other”, which included Covid infection, diverticulitis, circulatory failure, suicide, 
pulmonary embolism, HSV-1 encephalitis, potential allergic reaction during imaging investigation (PET 
scan), acute cardiac ischemic event not related to therapy, multi-organ failure and sudden death. 
One patient in the nivolumab arm thus died by pulmonary embolism, which is among the most 
frequently reported SAEs in this treatment arm (3 patients [0.6%] vs none in the placebo arm). These 
events of pulmonary embolism were not considered drug-related. In the pooled safety data including 
patients who were treated with nivolumab monotherapy in the different clinical studies, pulmonary 
embolism was also reported in 1.1% of patients and <0.1% was considered drug related. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Any-grade AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality) were reported in 91 (17.4%) 
patients in the nivolumab arm, and 9 (3.4%) patients in the placebo arm. The most common AEs 
leading to discontinuation for patients treated with nivolumab were arthralgia (1.7%) and diarrhoea, 
ALT increased, and AST increased (1.1% each) and for patients in the placebo arm ALT increased and 
AST increased (0.8% each). 
Immunogenicity 
The observed incidence of nivolumab ADA in Study CA20976K was low (2.6%) and generally consistent 
with those observed in other tumour types following nivolumab monotherapy. There was no apparent 
impact on hypersensitivity or infusion-related reactions.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
No patients younger than 18 of age were included in the pivotal study CA20976K. Therefore, there is a 
need to extrapolate the safety of nivolumab treatment to part of the applied-for target population. 
The safety of nivolumab has been evaluated in adolescent patients (≥ 12 to < 18 years old) in the type 
II variation for extension of the indication for nivolumab as monotherapy or in combination with 
ipilimumab for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older, and for nivolumab as monotherapy for the adjuvant treatment 
of adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with melanoma with involvement of lymph nodes 
or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G). For this 
procedure, safety data for the use of nivolumab monotherapy and in combination with ipilimumab in 
adolescents have been provided from study CA209070. -T safety data of the paediatric study 
CA20907, were compared with safety data from the adults studies CA209067 (advanced melanoma), 
CA209238 (adjuvant setting). Due the limited sample size of the paediatric patients included (n=64 in 
the nivolumab monotherapy arm) no definitive conclusion could be drawn regarding the safety profile 
of nivolumab in adolescents, however no significant differences between treatment groups in these 
studies were observed. 
To obtain long-term safety data, the MAH (in procedure EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G) proposed to 
extend the ongoing post-authorization long-term follow-up safety study CA184557 (NCT04196452) to 
include paediatric patients treated with nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab in the DMTR, as an additional pharmacovigilance activity. 
All in all, the extrapolation of the safety of nivolumab treatment to the adolescent part of the applied-
for target population is considered acceptable. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Safety data from study CA20976K for the use of nivolumab monotherapy in the adjuvant setting of 
Stage IIB or IIC melanoma following complete resection was submitted. In general the reported AEs 
and SAEs were in line with the known safety profile of nivolumab.  
No patients younger than 18 of age were included in the pivotal study CA20976K. Therefore, there is a 
need to extrapolate the safety of nivolumab treatment to part of the applied-for target population. 
The safety of nivolumab has been evaluated in adolescent patients (≥ 12 to < 18 years old) in 
procedure EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G with a positive outcome. Therefore, the extrapolation of the 
safety of nivolumab treatment to the adolescent part of the applied-for target population is considered 
acceptable in the current procedure also.  
Long-term safety data is unavailable on the use of nivolumab in adolescents 12 years of age and older. 
Long-term safety data for adolescent patients will be collected in the DMTR study as an additional 
pharmacovigilance activity (see RMP section). 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC have 
being updated. The Annex II and Package Leaflet (PL) are updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The extension of indication does not result in a relevant impact on the PL that would require 
performing a full user consultation. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This is an extension of indication for Opdivo in the adjuvant treatment of adults and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard of care for patients with clinical Stage II melanoma of all substages consists of wide surgical 
excision of the primary melanoma with the option to perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy. Current 
treatment recommendations for patients with a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy is observation 
with periodic surveillance to detect disease recurrence. In addition to observation, adjuvant 
pembrolizumab was recently (June 2022; Keytruda II/111 EPAR) approved for Stage IIB/C resected 
Assessment report  
EMA/358599/2023  
Page 89/94 
 
 
 
 
melanoma patients and is a recommended treatment option in the NCCN guidelines, but not yet listed 
in the ESMO guidelines. Patients with stage IIB/IIC have a high risk of recurrence after complete 
resection and approximately one third of Stage IIB and one half of Stage IIC will have disease 
recurrence within 5 years. Ten-year melanoma-specific survival is estimated to be 72%-82% and 
58%-75% for Stage IIB and Stage IIC patients, respectively. The goal of adjuvant treatment is to cure 
patients. 
Melanoma in adolescents and adults is generally regarded as an analogous disease and is treated 
similarly using multimodal therapy including surgery, systemic therapy, and in some cases, radiation. 
As such, current treatment strategies for adolescent patients with melanoma are based on clinical 
guidelines for adult patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
CA20976K (NCT04099251) is a phase 3, randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the use 
of adjuvant immunotherapy with nivolumab versus placebo after complete resection of Stage IIB/C 
melanoma in adults and adolescent subjects ≥12 years old. In Part 1 of the study, patients were 
randomised (2:1) to receive either nivolumab (n=526) 480 mg IV Q4W or placebo (n=264) with a 
maximum treatment duration of 1 year. Randomisation was stratified by tumour category (T3b vs. T4a 
vs. T4b). In Part 2 of the study, patients with a recurrence could be treated with nivolumab, regardless 
of their Part 1 treatment. Only results from Part 1 are presented and discussed. The primary efficacy 
outcome measure was investigator-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS). The main secondary 
outcome measures were OS and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS, exploratory). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At a pre-planned interim analysis (IA; DCO 28-Jun-2022), with a median follow-up of approximately 
16 months (minimum ~8 months), the primary endpoint RFS showed a statistically significant 
improvement in RFS for nivolumab compared to placebo (HR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.30-0.59, p<0.0001). 
RFS rates were higher in the nivolumab group than in the placebo group at 6 months (95.1% vs 
88.1%), and at 12 months (89.0% vs 79.4%). Results were confirmed based on a longer median 
follow-up of about 24 months (minimum follow-up ~16 months, DCO 21-Feb-2023) with a HR of 0.53 
(95% CI: 0.40, 0.71) and 12 month RFS rates of 88.8% and 81.1% in the nivolumab and placebo arm, 
respectively. 
Support was obtained from a numerical improvement in DMFS (HR=0.62; 95% CI: 0.43-0.89) at DCO 
21 February 2023. 
All subgroup analyses for RFS showed results consistent with the primary analysis, including the 
results for important subgroups like disease stage (IIB, IIC) and tumour category (T3b, T4a, T4b). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Updated results based on a median follow-up of approximately 24 months are sufficient to conclude on 
a beneficial effect on RFS of adjuvant nivolumab treatment in the target population, supported by a 
numerical improvement in DMFS which may be considered a more clinically relevant representative of 
long-term benefit. Some uncertainty exists on the RFS KM-curves beyond 12 months though, due to 
the censoring rate. Therefore, further long-term efficacy data should be provided post-approval, 
including OS data. The MAH will submit updated RFS data with a median follow-up of about 36 months 
(REC) and OS data from the first interim analysis from study CA20976K (Annex II.D PAES).

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Any-grade AEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 502 (95.8%) patient in the nivolumab arm, 
and 229 (86.7%) patients in the placebo arm. Drug-related any-grade AEs in 433 (82.6%) patients in 
the nivolumab, and 142 (53.8%) patients in the placebo arms. The most frequently reported AEs 
(regardless of causality) were for the patients treated with nivolumab; fatigue (26.1%), diarrhoea 
(22.5%), and pruritus (20.0%). The most frequently reported AEs in the placebo arm were; fatigue 
(25.0%), diarrhoea (15.2%), and headache (12.5%).  
Grade 3-4 AEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 115 (21.9%) patients in the nivolumab arm, 
and 32 (12.1%) patients in the placebo arm. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 AEs (regardless 
of causality) were for patients treated with nivolumab; blood creatinine phosphokinase increased 
(1.9%), ALT increased, AST increased, and hypertension (1.5% each), while in the placebo arm the 
most frequently reported AE was headache (0.8%).   
Any-grade SAEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 74 (14.1%) patients in the nivolumab arm 
vs 29 (11.0%) patients in the placebo arm. Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 55 (10.5%) patients in 
the nivolumab arm and 20 (7.6%) patients in the placebo arm. The most frequently reported SAEs 
(regardless of causality) were for patients treated with nivolumab COVID-19 (0.8%), ALT increased, 
AST increased, and pulmonary embolism (0.6% each) and for patients in the placebo arm; melanoma 
recurrent and invasive breast carcinoma (0.8% each). 
As of the 28-June-2022 data cut-off, 13 (2.5%) treated patients in the nivolumab arm and 8 (3.0%) in 
the placebo arms had died. Three patients in the nivolumab arm and 4 patients in the placebo arm 
died due to the disease. There was one Grade 5 event in each treatment arm that was not considered 
a drug related SAE; myocardial ischemia was reported in the nivolumab arm and sudden death in the 
placebo arm. Further most frequent cause of death was “other”, which included Covid infection, 
diverticulitis, circulatory failure, suicide, pulmonary embolism, HSV-1 encephalitis, potential allergic 
reaction during TEP scanner, acute cardiac ischemic event not related to therapy, multi-organ failure 
and sudden death. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No patients younger than 18 of age were included in the pivotal study CA20976K. Therefore, the safety 
of nivolumab treatment in this part of the applied-for target population is based on extrapolation.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Patients with Stage IIB and IIC melanoma are at high risk of recurrence and could therefore be 
candidates for adjuvant treatment after complete resection of all detectable disease. In the adjuvant 
setting, the ultimate aim is to increase cure rate. Nevertheless, effects on RFS are considered relevant 
to the individual patient and it is, therefore, considered an acceptable primary endpoint in 
registrational studies of adjuvant treatment in melanoma. 
The clinical data indicate an improvement in RFS of nivolumab over placebo. The primary endpoint is 
supported by an effect on distant metastases (DMFS), which is considered a clinically relevant endpoint 
as melanoma is generally considered to be incurable when distant metastasis is present. The results on 
RFS and DMFS were confirmed with longer follow-up (median approximately 24 months) and are 
considered sufficient to conclude on a beneficial effect of adjuvant nivolumab on RFS in the target 
population. As censoring rates beyond 12 months are still high and a plateau was not yet reached, the 
RFS results need further confirmation with longer follow-up, though this can be provided post 
approval. As the use of adjuvant therapy may limit therapeutic options at time of recurrence, OS data 
should also be reported in due time (post approval). The MAH has committed to submit updated RFS 
data (REC) as well as interim OS results from study CA20976K (Annex II D). 
The toxicity profile of nivolumab treatment as observed in study CA20976K was generally in line with 
the known safety profile of nivolumab. There were no new safety signals. 
No patients younger than 18 of age were included in the pivotal study. The extrapolation approach 
from adults to adolescents proposed is based on two main principles: 1) the drug behaves similarly 
and a comparable exposure-response to treatment can be expected between adults and adolescents; 
and 2) the disease biology can be considered similar between the two populations. This is considered 
acceptable for efficacy.

Moreover, the exposure and the safety of nivolumab in adolescent patients (≥ 12 to < 18 years old) 
has been evaluated in another procedure with a positive outcome (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0125/G). 
Therefore, the extrapolation of the safety of nivolumab treatment to the adolescent part of the applied 
indication is considered acceptable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A statistically significant treatment effect on recurrence-free survival of adjuvant nivolumab over 
placebo was observed in patients with completely resected Stage IIB and IIC melanoma. Results were 
confirmed with longer follow-up. Therefore, a beneficial effect of nivolumab in the adjuvant treatment 
of melanoma is considered demonstrated. The toxicity profile of nivolumab treatment as observed in 
study CA20976K was generally in line with what is known, is considered acceptable, and to outweighed 
by the beneficial effects in the applied-for target population. The benefit/risk balance is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As censoring rates beyond 12 months are still high and a plateau was not yet reached, the RFS results 
need further confirmation with longer follow-up. In addition, OS data are needed to better understand 
whether adjuvant nivolumab increases OS or only delays the progression of disease, these data are 
considered key to the benefit/risk. The OS analysis from study CA20976K was not available at the time 
of this submission and is included as an Annex II condition. The MAH will submit updated RFS data 
with a median follow-up of about 36 months (REC) and OS data from the first interim analysis (Annex 
II.D) from study CA20976K. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Opdivo is positive. 
The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy, in accordance 
with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EC) No 357/2014, (a) an initial efficacy assessment that is 
based on surrogate endpoints, which requires verification of the impact of the intervention on clinical 
outcome or disease progression or confirmation of previous efficacy assumptions: 
Post authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further characterise the efficacy of nivolumab as 
adjuvant treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with stage IIB or stage IIC 
melanoma, the MAH should submit the OS data from the first interim OS analysis of the Phase III 
study CA20976K.

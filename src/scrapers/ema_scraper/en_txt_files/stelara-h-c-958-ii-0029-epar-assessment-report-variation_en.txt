2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Therapies  for  PsA  are  intended  to  ameliorate  disease  signs  and  symptoms  and  the  functional 
impairment  caused  by  the  disease,  inhibit  the  structural  damage  resulting  from  inflammation,  and 
improve quality of life in affected patients. Mild PsA can be effectively managed with nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs).  DMARDs  are  the  standard  therapy  for  moderate  to  severe  PsA. 
Methotrexate  (MTX),  cyclosporine,  sulfasalazine,  and  leflunomide  have  been  used  in  the  treatment  of 
this condition, and several anti-TNF agents have been approved for the treatment of PsA. 
From a clinical perspective a clear need remains for alternative treatment options for patients with PsA 
who  have  inadequately  responded  to  or  are  intolerant  to  NSAIDs,  DMARDs  and/or  anti-TNF  agents. 
There  is  room  for  new  agents  with  a  novel  mechanism  of  action,  which  demonstrate  consistent  or 
improved  efficacy  across  all  components  of  PsA,  improved  safety,  and  a  more  convenient  dosing 
schedule.

Ustekinumab (STELARA) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody that 
binds the p40 subunit common to the heterodimeric cytokines interleukin 12 (IL-12) and interleukin 23 
(IL-23) and neutralizes their biological activities. 
Ustekinumab has been authorised in the EU since 16 January 2009 and has received approval for the 
treatment of adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Ps) in over 65 countries. 
This  was  primarily  based  on  2  large,  Phase  3,  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies  (C0743T08  and 
C0743T09)  in  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe  plaque  psoriasis.  In  addition,  ustekinumab  has  been 
studied or is currently being studied in multiple indications including psoriatic arthritis (PsA), paediatric 
psoriasis,  Crohn’s  disease,  multiple  sclerosis  (MS),  primary  biliary  cirrhosis,  sarcoidosis,  and 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
An  overview  of  the  3  clinical  studies  that  comprise  the  PsA  clinical  development  program,  including 
study populations, dose regimens, and efficacy endpoints is briefly presented in Table 1.  Note that the 
older name for Stelara (ustekinumab) in the phase 2 Study C0743T10 is CNTO 1275.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A  comprehensive  PK  analysis  was  provided  at  the  initial  MAA  in  subjects  with  plaque  psoriasis.  The 
additional data provided in this application is summarised below. 
Assays 
No updates were available for the assays used to detect serum ustekinumab concentrations. 
There  was  a  new  validated  assay  developed  for  detection  of  antibodies  to  ustekinumab  (Meso  Scale 
Discovery ECLIA Method for Detection of Antibodies to Ustekinumab in Human Serum). The difference 
between  this  newer  assay  (ECLIA)  and  the  older  ADA  assay  provided  in  the  initial  MAA  (EIA)  is  that 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 9/77 
 
 
 
this  newer  assay  incorporates  an  acid  dissociation  step  and  is  therefore  more  tolerant  to  drug 
substance. 
The  older  EIA  and  new  ECLIA  ADA  methods  were  compared  in  a  cross-validation  that  evaluated 
method  sensitivity  and  ustekinumab  interference  in  the  ability  of  the  methods  to  accurately  detect 
antibodies  to  ustekinumab.  The  ECLIA  method  demonstrated  greater  sensitivity  than  the  EIA  method 
(1.97  ng/mL  vs.  125  ng/mL  respectively)  when  a  purified  cynomolgus  anti-ustekinumab  pAb  was 
serially diluted. 
Based  on  the  screening  Method  A  cut-point  (0.132  OD),  50  ng/mL  Cyno  6747  was  detected  in  the 
presence of up to 7 ng/mL ustekinumab (CNTO 1275), whereas for the newer ECLIA the low positive 
ADA  control  (50  ng/mL  Cyno  6747)  could  be  detected  in  the  presence  of  up  to  100,000  ng/mL 
ustekinumab (CNTO 1275), thereby showing more tolerance to serum ustekinumab for the new ECLIA 
assay.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Efficacy  for  plaque  psoriasis  (Ps)  was  the  main  PD  readout  in  the  original  MAA.    In  the  Psoriatic 
Arthritis (PsA) studies the MAH conducted a variety of assessments for a PD effect other than clinical 
efficacy.  
Assessments  of  serum  markers  previously  reported  to  be  associated  with  PsA  were  analysed.  The 
serum  inflammatory  markers  evaluated  were  VEGF,  sIL-2R,  MMP-3,  and  osteocalcin.  Despite  the 
reported  association  of  elevated  levels  of  these  markers  with  PsA,  in  the  study  population  the  mean 
levels  of  all  markers  were  not  markedly  elevated  and  were  similar  to  those  reported  in  the  literature 
for  healthy  adults  (Fink  et  al,  2007;  Bons  et  al,  2007;  Brennan  et  al  1997;  Gundberg  et  al,  1983). 
Overall,  there  were  minimal  changes  (<  10%)  from  baseline  with  no  trend  for  change  following 
treatment with ustekinumab. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
Population PK Analysis 
A  population  PK  analysis  was  performed  examining  a  variety  of  demographics,  baseline  disease 
characteristics and concomitant medication.    
There  were  334  (48.0%)  subjects  who  used  concomitant  MTX  during  the  study  period  and  were 
included in the population PK analysis. The median CL/F value in subjects who used concomitant MTX 
tended  to  be lower  when  compared  with  subjects  who  did  not  use  concomitant  MTX;  the  ratio  of  the 
median  CL/F  values  in  subjects  who  used  concomitant  MTX  versus  subjects  who  did  not  use 
concomitant  MTX  was  0.92  and  the  90%  CI  of  the  ratio  was  (0.88,  0.96).  Therefore,  the  use  of 
concomitant MTX did not appear to affect the CL/F of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA. 
Of  the  demographic  factors  (e.g.,  weight,  gender,  race,  and  age),  baseline  subject  physical  or 
biochemical characteristics, medical or medication history, or concomitant medications evaluated in the 
current population PK analysis, only subject weight and positive antibody to ustekinumab status were 
confirmed  to  be  important  covariates  affecting  the  CL/F  and  therefore  systemic  exposure  to 
ustekinumab  in  subjects  with  active  PsA.  However,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  effects  of  these 
important covariates needs to be evaluated concurrently with the clinical efficacy and safety data. The 
PK  simulation  indicated  that  subjects  of  higher  weight  (>100  kg)  had  lower  median  serum 
ustekinumab concentrations compared with subjects of lower weight (≤100 kg), whereby the systemic 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 10/77 
 
 
exposure to ustekinumab in subjects >100 kg treated with 90 mg doses was generally comparable to 
that in subjects ≤100 kg treated with the 45 mg doses. These findings are consistent with the results 
from the previous population PK analysis using data from Phase 3 plaque psoriasis studies. None of the 
other  factors  evaluated,  such  as  concomitant  medications  (MTX,  NSAIDs,  or  oral  corticosteroids)  and 
prior exposure to anti-TNF agents, appeared to have impacts on the CL/F of ustekinumab in subjects 
with PsA. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH developed and validated an improved assay the ECLIA for detection of ADA.  Serum samples 
were taken in all three trials described in this report. Data from the two pivotal trials were used for the 
population PK analysis. 
The overall conclusions from these data are summarised below: 
• 
• 
In general, the PK and immunogenicity results from the PsA studies were consistent with those 
from the plaque psoriasis (Ps) studies submitted at the initial MAA. 
The median t1/2 of ustekinumab was estimated to be 22.4 days in the Phase 2 PsA study. 
•  Dose  proportionality  in  serum  ustekinumab  concentration  was  observed  in  the  PsA  studies 
when  comparing  mean  serum  ustekinumab  concentrations  between  the  45  mg  and  90  mg 
groups. 
• 
There was no evidence of accumulation in serum ustekinumab concentrations over time when 
ustekinumab was given SC q12w in the PsA studies. 
•  A  higher  proportion  of  subjects  with  BQL  trough  serum  ustekinumab  concentrations  were 
observed in the 45 mg group compared with the 90 mg group in the PsA studies. 
•  Serum  ustekinumab  concentrations  were  affected  by  weight 
in  subjects  with  PsA. 
Subjects >100 kg had lower mean serum ustekinumab concentrations compared with subjects 
≤100 kg. Notably, mean serum ustekinumab concentrations in subjects >100 kg in the 90 mg 
group were generally comparable to those observed in subjects ≤100 kg in the 45 mg group. 
• 
• 
This was supported by population PK modeling and simulation. 
In  the  population  PK  analysis  using  Phase  3  PsA  data,  among  the  demographic  factors  (e.g., 
weight,  gender,  race,  and  age),  baseline  subject  physical  or  biochemical  characteristics, 
medical or medication history, or concomitant medications evaluated, only subject weight and 
positive  antibody  to  ustekinumab  status  were  found  to  be  important  covariates  affecting  the 
CL/F and therefore systemic exposure to ustekinumab in subjects with PsA. 
o 
o 
In  the  population  PK  analysis,  the  use  of  concomitant  MTX  did  not  appear  to  have  a 
clinically relevant impact on the CL/F of ustekinumab. 
In the population PK analysis, prior exposure to biologic anti-TNF agents did not appear 
to have a clinically relevant impact on the CL/F of ustekinumab. 
•  Subjects  with  higher  pre-injection  serum  ustekinumab  concentrations  tended  to  have  higher 
clinical efficacy in PsA studies. The proportion of subjects who achieved ACR 20, ACR 50, and 
PASI  75  responses  at  Week  24  was  higher  in  subjects  with  quantifiable  preinjection  serum 
ustekinumab  concentrations  at  Week  16  when  compared  with  subjects  with  preinjection  BQL 
serum ustekinumab concentrations at Week 16.

• 
• 
Population  PK  modeling  showed  that  weight  impacted  systemic  exposure  to  ustekinumab. 
Population PK/PD modeling showed a clear exposure-response relationship and that the impact 
of weight on efficacy resulted only from its impact on exposure to ustekinumab. This supports 
the  concept  of  giving  heavier  subjects  a  higher  dose  of  ustekinumab  to  achieve  higher 
exposure to ustekinumab. 
The overall incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab was 5.8% to 6.1% through Week 24 in the 
Phase  3  PsA  studies.  The  incidence  of  antibodies  to  ustekinumab  was  generally  comparable 
between the 45 mg group and the 90 mg group in the PsA studies. 
o  The  incidence  of  antibodies  to  ustekinumab  was  lower  in  subjects  receiving  MTX  at 
baseline  (3.3%  and  4.5%)  compared  with  subjects  not  receiving  MTX  at  baseline 
(8.1%  and  7.6%)  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  and  CNTO1275PSA3002  studies, 
respectively. 
o  The incidence of antibodies to ustekinumab was higher in subjects who were previously 
treated  with  biologic  anti-TNF  agents  (8.5%)  compared  with  subjects  who  were  naïve 
to biologic anti-TNF agents (3.1%) in CNTO1275PSA3002. 
•  Subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab had lower mean serum ustekinumab 
concentrations  than  subjects  who  were  negative  for  antibodies  to  ustekinumab  in  the  PsA 
studies. 
•  Systemic  markers  of  inflammation  were  measurable  in  the  serum  at  baseline  and  4  markers 
(MDC,  VEGF,  MCSF-1,  and  YKL-40)  showed  modest  differences  in  concentration  in 
ustekinumab-treated subjects compared to placebo at Week 4. However, there were no strong 
associations observed between the serum biomarkers measured and baseline disease severity 
or joint and/or skin response. 
Patients  with  diabetes  showed  an  apparent  slightly  increased  clearance.  The  MAH  performed  a 
subgroup analyses for subjects with diabetes for the primary efficacy endpoint and the results showed 
that  the  PK  and  exposure  in  diabetic  patients  is  within  the  90%  CI  interval  within  the  defined  range 
(0.8-1.25)  and  that  diabetes  is  not  in  itself  a  covariate  that  impacts  on  exposure  from  population  PK 
analysis.  The  efficacy  of  patients  with  diabetes  was  also  presented  and  although  reduced  compared 
with  non-diabetic  patients,  no  firm  conclusions  can  be  drawn  in  view  of  the  small  numbers  with 
diabetes.   
In Study C0743T10 use of a filter was introduced after the study commenced and had the effect of 
reducing the delivered dose of ustekinumab. The MAH clarified that the filter was introduced as a 
precaution following identification of particulate matter in other lyophilised products (not 
ustekinumab). Notably this lyophilised product used in study C0743T10 is not the marketed product.  
Although the dose administered was less (63 mg instead of 90mg as a result of loss of product in the 
filter), the PK data was as expected from the dose administered and there were no safety or efficacy 
concerns.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK results were as expected and similar to the PK data from the initial MAA as the posology was 
the  same  in  the  2  pivotal  trials  in  PsA  and  the  patient  population  are  similar.  The  only  difference 
between  the  PsA  subjects  and  the  Ps  subjects  was  that  in  some  PsA  subjects  there  was  concomitant 
MTX treatment.  The MAH also provided extensive PD studies and separate report for these but there 
were no clear relationships with baseline disease or response to treatment.

Although the correlation of efficacy with serum levels of Stelara for outcome measures of PsA was not 
as  clear  as  the  correlation  seen  in  the  Ps  programme  at  initial  MAA  (where  much  larger  numbers  of 
subjects were studied), throughout the PsA clinical trials efficacy was higher in the high dose groups. 
As exposure is less in those >100kg and a 90mg dose in those >100kg results in exposure similar to 
the  45mg  dose  in  those  <100kg,  it  is  expected  that  those  >100kg  will  benefit  from  the  90mg  dose 
which is already licensed for Ps in those >100kg.   
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Study C0743T10 
Study  C0743T10  was  a  Phase  2,  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Double-blind,  Placebo-controlled  Trial  of 
CNTO 1275 (CNTO 1275 was the name for  ustekinumab at the time of study C0743T10), in Subjects 
with  Active  Psoriatic  Arthritis  (EudraCT  No.:  2005-003525-92)  24  sites  in  the  US,  Canada,  Finland, 
Denmark, and Switzerland Studied Period: 21 Dec 2005/20 Sep 2007 
The Phase 2 study, C0743T10, was conducted to establish proof of concept for ustekinumab in PsA and 
to  aid  in  determining  the  doses  and  dose  regimens  to  be  evaluated  in  Phase  3.  Subjects  enrolled  in 
C0743T10  were  required  to  have  active  PsA  despite  previous  or  current  treatment  with  disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  
Methods 
This  was  a  Phase  2,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  2  arm  study  of  CNTO 
1275 90 mg in subjects with active PsA who had an inadequate response to current standard therapies 
(e.g., methotrexate [MTX], corticosteroids, NSAIDs, anti-tumour necrosis factor [anti-TNF] agents). 
• 
Study participants  
140  planned  (70  subjects  per  group);  146  subjects  were  randomized  to  treatment  and  analysed  for 
efficacy and for safety; 133 were analysed for pharmacokinetics and 124 were analysed for antibodies 
to CNTO 1275. 
Men and women aged 18 years or older with active PsA (defined as disease for at least 6 months prior 
to  study  drug  administration)  who  had  an  inadequate  response  to  standard  disease  modifying 
antirheumatic drug (DMARD), and/or NSAID, and/or prior exposure to anti-TNF therapies. 
DMARD  therapy  is  defined  as  taking  a  DMARD  for  at  least  3  months,  or  evidence  of  DMARD 
intolerance. Use of MTX at a dose ≤25 mg/week was allowed during the study but was not mandatory. 
Up to 25% of subjects may have had prior exposure to anti-TNF agents. 
• 
Treatments 
90 mg CNTO 1275 (or 63 mg after filtration) was administered by SC injection. Subjects randomized to 
CNTO 1275 x 4 were to receive CNTO 1275 at Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3. At Week 12, subjects randomized 
to placebo were to receive CNTO 1275 63 mg at Weeks 12 and 16.   
Placebo  was  administered  by  SC  injection.  Subjects  randomized  to  placebo  were  to  receive  placebo 
injections Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3. To maintain the blind, subjects randomized to CNTO 1275 x 4 were to 
receive placebo injections at Weeks 12 and 16.

The  first  to  last  administration  of  study  agent  was  16  weeks;  pharmacokinetics,  efficacy,  safety,  and 
antibodies to CNTO 1275 were evaluated through Week 36.  
A schematic of the study design is provided in Figure 1. At Week 0, 146 subjects were randomized to 
SC  injections  of  either  ustekinumab  90  mg  or  placebo  at  Weeks  0,  1,  2,  and  3.  Placebo  subjects 
crossed  over to  receive  ustekinumab  90  mg  SC  at Week  12  and  Week  16.  After  the  first 36  subjects 
were enrolled in the study, the implementation of a filtration procedure during study dose preparation 
resulted in a dose volume reduction to approximately 0.70 mL, equivalent to approximately 63 mg for 
all  subsequent  doses.  Fifty-nine  of  the  76  subjects  who  were  randomized  to  ustekinumab  and  57 
subjects randomized to placebo were administered ustekinumab after the addition of the filtration step.

Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  CNTO  1275  in  the 
treatment of subjects with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).  
The secondary objectives were to evaluate:  
(1) The efficacy of CNTO 1275 in achieving a high level of improvement in arthritis.  
(2) The impact of CNTO 1275 on quality of life.  
(3) The efficacy of CNTO 1275 on psoriatic skin lesions.  
(4) The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of CNTO 1275 in subjects with PsA.

Analyses  of  the  primary  and  major  secondary  endpoints  were  stratified  by  subjects’  prior  anti-TNF 
exposure status. 
Other  efficacy  assessments  included  assessments  of  dactylitis,  enthesopathy,  morning  stiffness, 
Disease Activity Index (DAS) 28, and target lesions assessments. In addition, the relationship between 
serum  CNTO  1275  concentration  and  efficacy  was  examined,  as  well  as  between  antibodies  to  CNTO 
1275 and efficacy. 
Blood samples were collected from all subjects at each visit through Week 36 for the determination of 
serum CNTO 1275 concentration over time and t1/2. Antibodies to CNTO 1275 were determined from 
serum  samples  collected  at  Weeks  0,  12,  and  36.  Biomarkers  were  assessed  at  Weeks  0,  4,  12,  and 
36. 
Statistical Methods 
Simple descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, SD, interquartile range, minimum and maximum 
for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables were used to summarize 
most data. Analyses were adjusted for subjects’ status of anti-TNF exposure. All statistical procedures 
were  performed  2-sided  at  a  significance  level  of  0.05.  The  study  was  designed  to  maintain  a  Type  I 
error  of  0.05  or  less  for  the  primary  analysis.  Nominal  p-values  were  to  be  reported  for  secondary 
analyses. 
Results  
• 
Participant flow  
A total of 287 subjects were screened and 146 subjects were randomized, 76 subjects to CNTO 1275 
and 70 subjects to placebo.

Figure 2 Subject disposition through Week 36 for subjects randomized at Week 0 
Through  Week  12,  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  discontinued  study  agent  in  the  placebo  group 
(18.6%) compared with the CNTO 1275 x 4 group (5.3%). 
The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  of  study  agent  in  the  placebo  group  were  AEs  and 
unsatisfactory  therapeutic  effect  (4  [5.7%]  each).  No  subjects  in  the  CNTO  1275  x  4  group 
discontinued  study  agent  for  an  AE  of  worsening  PsA,  psoriasis,  or  PsA  and  psoriasis.  The  most 
common reason for discontinuation in the CNTO 1275 x 4 group was unsatisfactory therapeutic effect 
for PsA only (2.6%). 
• 
Baseline data 
Baseline  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  were  generally  comparable  between  the  study 
groups. The majority of subjects were men (56.2%) and Caucasian (94.5%). The median age was 49.0 
years,  and  the  median  weight  was  90.91  kg.  The  median  duration  of  PsA  was  5.22  years  while  the 
median  duration  of  Ps  was  16.92  years.  The  total  median  numbers  of  swollen  and  tender  joints  at 
baseline  were  9.0  and  18.0,  respectively.  The  total  median  HAQ  disability  index  was  0.8  and  total 
median  C-reactive  protein  (CRP)  was  0.5  mg/dL.  In  subjects  with  ≥  3%  body  surface  area  (BSA) 
involvement at baseline, the median PASI score was 8.70 and the median DLQI score was 10.5. 
As the PsA population is at higher risk for comorbidity when compared with the general population and 
the study population had significant comorbidities in addition to PsA: 
•  past  or  current  history  of  cigarette  smoking  was  reported  by  59.6%  of  subjects,  with  29.5%  still 
smoking at the start of study participation; 
•  hypertension  was  reported  by  34.2%  of  subjects,  with  30.1%  requiring  medication  to  control  their 
hypertension; 
• hyperlipidaemia was reported by 26.0% of subjects, with 17.1% requiring medication to control their 
hyperlipidaemia; 
• depression was reported by 21.2% of subjects;

•  diabetes  mellitus  was  reported  by  12.3%  of  subjects,  with  2.7%  requiring  insulin  to  control  their 
diabetes. 
At baseline, 48.6% of subjects were using NSAIDs, 5.5% of subjects were taking COX-2 inhibitors, and 
20.5% of subjects were using MTX. There were no subjects who were using oral corticosteroids.

Summary of results 
PK results 
Of  the  146  subjects  with  serum  samples,  133  subjects  received  CNTO  1275  at  least  once  during  the 
study period and thus had evaluable serum CNTO 1275 concentrations. On days when study agent was 
administered, samples were taken immediately before the injection. 
Serum CNTO 1275 Concentrations Over Time 
After receiving 4 weekly doses of CNTO 1275 (at Weeks 0, 1, 2, and 3), the median serum CNTO 1275 
concentrations generally peaked at Week 4 (the first available sampling time point after Week 3) and 
then declined exponentially through Week 20  
Figure 3 Median serum CNTO 1275 concentrations (micrograms/mL) through Week 36; 
treated subjects 
Median  serum  CNTO  1275  concentrations  were  below  the  LLOQ  at  Week  24 in  subjects  who  received 
63 mg x 4 and  subjects who received 90 mg  x 4. At each  sampling time point from Week 1 through 
Week  4,  serum  CNTO  1275  concentrations  were  higher  in  subjects  who  received  90  mg  x  4  than  in 
subjects who received 63 mg x 4, with the difference between the 2 dosages showing an approximate 
dose-proportionality.

In  the  placebo  →  CNTO  1275  x  2  group,  after  receiving  the  second  dose  of  CNTO  1275  at  Week  16, 
median  serum  CNTO  1275  concentrations  generally  peaked  at  Week  20  (the  first  available  sampling 
time  point  after  Week  16)  and  then  declined  exponentially  through  Week  28.  Median  serum  CNTO 
1275 concentrations were below the LLOQ at Week 36.  
Similar  terminal  elimination  phases,  in  terms  of  the  descending  slopes  of  the  median  serum 
concentration versus time curves, were observed in the placebo → CNTO 1275 x 2 and CNTO 1275 x 4 
groups regardless of dose. 
Compared  with  subjects  not  receiving  MTX  at  baseline,  no  consistent  trends  towards  higher  or  lower 
serum  CNTO  1275  levels  were  observed  in  subjects  treated  with  MTX  at  baseline,  suggesting  that 
concomitant administration of MTX had no impact on the systemic exposure of CNTO 1275. However, 
interpretation is limited by the small number of subjects receiving MTX at baseline  
Serum CNTO 1275 Half-life 
CNTO 1275 was eliminated from the circulation with a similar median t1/2 in subjects who received 63 
mg x 4 and subjects who received 90 mg x 4. The overall median t1/2 of CNTO 1275 was 22.4 days. 
Effect of ADA on PK 
The  number  of  subjects  who  were  positive  for  antibodies  to  CNTO  1275  was  low,  and  these  subjects 
exhibited median serum levels of CNTO 1275 that trended lower than those in subjects either negative 
or undetectable for antibodies to CNTO 1275.

Figure 4 Median serum CNTO 1275 concentration over time by antibody to CNTO 1275 status 
and treatment groups; treated subjects 
Although interpretation of the impact of immunogenicity on CNTO 1275 serum concentration is limited 
by the small study population and the small number of subjects positive for antibodies to CNTO 1275, 
there is a trend for lower serum levels in those who are ADA positive. This is similar to the results in 
the initial MAA for plaque psoriasis. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Assessments  of  serum  markers  previously  reported  to  be  associated  with  PsA  were  analysed  (see 
section 2.3.3). Overall, there were minimal changes (< 10%) from baseline with no trend for change 
following treatment with CNTO 1275. 
Efficacy results  
Primary Endpoint 
  ACR 20 Response at Week 12 
The proportion of subjects who achieved the primary efficacy endpoint, ACR 20 response at Week 12, 
was  significantly  greater  in  the  CNTO  1275  x  4  group  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (42.1%  vs. 
14.3%, p < 0.001. 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 19/77 
 
 
 
 
A  per  protocol  analysis  including  subjects  who  received  all  4  correct  injections  within  2  weeks  of  the 
scheduled  visit  dates  was  performed.    ACR  20  response  at  Week  12  was  significantly  greater  in  the 
CNTO 1275 x 4 group compared with the placebo group (45.7% vs. 16.9%, p < 0.001). 
Major Secondary Endpoints:  
  ACR 50 and ACR 70 Responses at Week 12 
ACR  50  and  ACR  70  responses  at  Week  12  were  also  compared.  A  significantly  greater  proportion  of 
subjects in the CNTO 1275 x 4 group achieved an ACR 50 response and an ACR 70 response at Week 
12  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (25.0%  vs.  7.1%,  p  =  0.004  and  10.5%  vs.  0.0%,  p  =  0.005, 
respectively). 
  Change From Baseline in the HAQ Score at Week 12 
The functional status of subjects was assessed using the Disability Index of the HAQ. The improvement 
from baseline in the HAQ score is calculated such that negative values indicate improvement (i.e., less 
disability)  and  positive  values  indicate  worsening  (i.e.,  more  disability).  Reductions  of  ≥  0.22  are 
considered  clinically  meaningful.  The  change  from  baseline  in  HAQ  disability  index  at  Week  12  was 
significantly greater in the CNTO 1275 X 4 group compared with the placebo group (median: –0.25 vs. 
0.00, p < 0.001). 
 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index Response at Week 12 
In  the  subset  of  subjects  with  psoriasis  involving  ≥  3%  BSA  at  baseline,  a  significantly  greater 
proportion  of  subjects  in  the  CNTO  1275  x  4  group  achieved  a  PASI  75  response  compared  with  the 
placebo group (52.4% vs. 5.5%, p < 0.001).  
  Change From Baseline in DLQI at Week 12 
DLQI  scores  range  from  0  to  30,  with  lower  scores  indicating  better  quality  of  life.  A  change  from 
baseline is calculated such that negative values indicate improvement (i.e., better quality of life), and a 
decrease of 5 or more points from the baseline score (i.e., a change of –5) has been demonstrated to 
be clinically meaningful (Kimball et al, 2004). 
At  Week  12,  among  subjects  with  Ps  involving  ≥  3%  BSA  at  baseline,  those  in  the  CNTO  1275  x  4 
group had a significantly greater decrease (improvement) in DLQI scores compared with those in the 
placebo group (median: 6.0 vs. 0.0, p < 0.001).

Study CNTO1275PSA3001 (A Phase 3 Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-
controlled Trial of Ustekinumab, a Fully Human Anti-IL-12/23p40 Monoclonal Antibody, 
Administered Subcutaneously, in Subjects with Active Psoriatic Arthritis.) 
Methods 
The  CNTO1275PSA3001  (3001)  study  is  an  ongoing  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, 
parallel, multicenter 3-arm study (with early escape at Week 16) of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA. 
Approximately  600  subjects  were  planned  to  receive  treatment  with  ustekinumab  45  mg,  90  mg,  or 
placebo  SC  at  Weeks  0  and  4  followed  by  q12w  dosing  with  the  last  dose  at  Week  88.  Subjects 
randomized  to  placebo  were  to  crossover  to  receive  ustekinumab  at  Weeks  24  and  28  followed  by 
q12w  dosing  with  the  last  dose  at  Week  88.  Subjects  will  be  followed  for  efficacy  through  Week  100 
and for safety through Week 108.

All  PK,  efficacy,  and  safety  data  through  Week  24  with  the  exception  of  the  radiographic  data  for  all 
randomized  subjects  were  included  in  this  DBL.  In  addition,  subject  disposition  and  safety  data 
(including laboratory data) through Week 52  for subjects randomized prior to 26 Oct 2010 who were 
supposed  to  have  completed  Week  52  visit  by  the  time  of  the  24-week  DBL  (either  terminated  the 
study or completed through Week 52), and  referred thereafter as “the  Week 52 safety subset”,  were 
also included. Radiographic data through Week 52 will be available in a subsequent DBL. 
The expected duration of exposure to ustekinumab for randomized subjects is 100 weeks. Completion 
of  the  Week  108  visit  will  be  considered the  end  of  the  study.  Additional  DBLs  will  occur  at  Week  52 
and Week 108 with future reports planned to summarize the data through these time periods. 
The Study Schema through Week 108 is presented in Figure 6 
Figure 6: Schematic of Study CNTO1275PSA3001 through Week 108 
Study participants 
Subjects eligible for this study were men and women (excluding pregnant or nursing women, and men 
and women planning a pregnancy) aged 18 through 99 years who had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 
months  prior  to  first  study  agent  administration  and  who  had  active  PsA  despite  current  or  previous 
DMARD and/or NSAID therapy. Diagnosis of PsA must have included the diagnosis of active arthritis as 
defined by 5 or more swollen joints and 5 or more tender joints at screening and at baseline and high 
sensitivity  CRP  ≥0.3  mg/dL  (decreased  from  ≥0.6  mg/dL  per  Amendment  3;  upper  limit  of  normal 
[ULN]  1.0  mg/dL)  at  screening,  and  the  presence  of  active  plaque  psoriasis  (Ps)  or  a  documented 
history of Ps. As per study design, subjects were to be naïve with respect to anti-TNF therapy.

In  addition,  subjects  must  have  had  at  least  1  of  the  following  PsA  subtypes:  DIP  joint  arthritis, 
polyarticular  arthritis  with  the  absence  of  rheumatoid  nodules,  arthritis  mutilans,  asymmetric 
peripheral arthritis, or spondylitis with peripheral arthritis. 
Subjects were eligible to participate if they had no evidence of active TB and no history of past latent 
TB. Subjects with latent TB newly detected at screening were eligible if they were started on treatment 
for  latent  TB  prior  to  or  simultaneously  with  first  study  agent  administration.  The  study  design 
excluded  subjects  with  other  inflammatory  diseases  that  could  confound  the  evaluations  of  benefit 
from ustekinumab therapy. Subjects who previously had been treated with anti-TNF therapy, received 
systemic immunosuppressives, or DMARDs other than methotrexate (MTX) within 4 weeks prior to the 
first  study  dose,  were  to  be  excluded  from  participation.  Subjects  who  had  received  other  specific 
drugs  as  outlined  in  the  protocol  were  also  excluded.  Subjects  who  had  used  or  were  currently  on  a 
stable dose of MTX, NSAIDs, or oral corticosteroids were eligible for enrolment in the study. Subjects 
who  had received topical or systemic Ps treatments as outlined in the protocol within the  first 2 or 4 
weeks of administration of study agent were excluded from participation in the study. 
Treatments  
Prior to the first injection, eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups as follows: 
Ustekinumab 45 mg (n=205): Ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by q12w dosing with 
the last dose at Week 88. At Weeks 20 and 24, subjects received placebo to maintain the blind. 
Ustekinumab 90 mg (n=204): Ustekinumab 90 mg at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by q12w dosing with 
the last dose at Week 88. At Weeks 20 and 24, subjects received placebo to maintain the blind. 
Placebo  (n=206):  Placebo  at  Weeks  0,  4,  16,  and  20.  At  Weeks  24  and  28,  subjects  received 
ustekinumab 45 mg followed by q12w dosing with the last dose at Week 88. 
At  Week  16,  subjects  with  <5%  improvement  from  baseline  in  both  tender  and  swollen  joint  counts 
were eligible to enter early escape in a double-blind fashion as follows: 
Ustekinumab  45  mg:  Ustekinumab  90  mg  at  Week  16,  followed  by  90  mg  q12w  dosing  with  the  last 
dose at Week 88. At Weeks 20 and 24, subjects received placebo to maintain the blind. 
Ustekinumab 90 mg: The same dosage schedule was to be continued. 
Placebo: Ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 16, 20, and 28, followed by 45 mg q12w dosing with the last 
dose at Week 88. At Week 24, subjects received placebo to maintain the blind. 
An additional dose was administered in the early escape arm because of operational reasons and the 
timing  of  placebo/active  doses  in  the  arms.  The  efficacy  results  from  the  early  escape  arm  were 
descriptive only and not part of the formal comparisons between the treatment arms. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this study CNTO1275PSA3001 were to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab 
in subjects with active PsA by assessing the reduction in signs and symptoms of PsA and to evaluate 
the safety of ustekinumab in this population. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab in: 
• 
• 
• 
Improving physical function; 
Improving psoriatic skin lesions; and 
Inhibiting the progression of structural damage (this will be addressed in a future report).

The data on radiographic scores is not yet available. Regarding the efficacy of ustekinumab in reducing 
the rate of progression of structural damage in PsA, this will be established based on radiographic data 
collected  from  Phase  3  studies  CNTO1275PSA3001  and  CNTO1275PSA3002.  A  meta-analysis  has 
recently been performed and a separate report is currently being prepared for inclusion in a variation 
submission, planned for later in 2013, in support of a STELARA PsA claim for structural damage.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 24. 
Major secondary endpoints in the order of statistical testing were: 
-  The change from baseline in the Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI) 
score at Week 24; 
-  The  proportion  of  subjects  (with  baseline  ≥3%  body  surface  area  [BSA]  psoriatic  involvement)  who 
achieve a PASI 75 response at Week 24; 
- The proportion of subjects with ACR 50 response at Week 24; 
- The proportion of subjects with ACR 70 responses at Week 24; 
-  The  change  from  baseline  in  total  radiographic  scores  of  the  hands  and  feet  at  Week  24  (to  be 
summarized in a later report). 
Multiple  additional  efficacy  analyses  were  conducted  including  Das28  response,  dactylitis,  enthesitis 
and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). 
The schedule of assessment is shown in the table below. 
Sample size 
The study was powered to detect significant treatment differences in reducing the signs and symptoms 
of  arthritis.  With  600  subjects  (200  subjects  in  each  treatment  group),  assuming  50%  MTX  usage  at 
baseline,  a  simulation  of  5,000  repetitions  was  used  to  calculate  the  power  to  detect  a  significant 
difference  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  an  ACR  20  response  using  a  CMH  test  with 
stratification by subjects’ baseline MTX usage (yes/no). The study  had over 99% power to detect the 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 23/77 
 
 
 
treatment differences (α=0.05) in ACR 20 response for at least one ustekinumab group compared with 
the placebo group assuming the effect size of 20% to 25% for subjects not receiving MTX and 25% to 
30%  for  subjects  receiving  MTX  in  achieving  ACR  20  at  Week  24.  These  assumptions  were  based  on 
the data from the ustekinumab Phase 2 PsA study, C0743T10.  
Randomisation 
The  randomization  was  stratified  by  investigational  site,  baseline  weight  (≤100  kg  or  >100  kg),  and 
baseline MTX usage (yes/no) since these three factors could potentially affect the outcome measures. 
The randomization method was minimization with a biased-coin assignment in a 1:1:1 ratio, resulting 
in  approximately  200  subjects  to  each  group.  This  randomization  method  was  chosen  since  some  of 
the  study  sites  may  only  enrol  a  few  subjects  and  it  would  be  difficult  to  ensure  balanced  treatment 
assignments within each combination of site stratum, weight stratum and baseline MTX stratum using 
a  traditional  block  randomization.  The  randomization  using  the  minimization  with  a  biased  coin 
assignment  minimizes  the  imbalance  in  the  distribution  of  the  number  of  subjects  across  treatment 
groups within the levels of each individual stratification factor. 
Blinding (masking) 
At the Week 24 database lock, the data was unblinded for analysis while subjects are still participating 
in  the  study.  Identification  of  sponsor  personnel  who  had  access  to  the  unblinded  subject-level  data 
was  documented  prior  to  unblinding.  Investigative  study  sites  and  subjects  remained  blinded  to 
treatment  assignment  until  the  last  subject  enrolled  completed  the  Week  108  evaluations  for 
CNTO1275PSA3001  and  the  Week  60  evaluations  for  CNTO275PSA3002  and  the  respective  database 
was  locked  for  each  study.  Data  that  could  potentially  unblind  the  treatment  assignment  (i.e.,  study 
agent serum concentrations, antibodies to study agent, treatment allocation) was handled with special 
care to ensure that the integrity of the blind was maintained and the potential for bias was minimized. 
This could include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by the 
investigators, clinical team, or others as appropriate until the time of database lock and unblinding. 
Statistical methods 
All statistical tests were 2-sided and performed at α=0.05.  
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  all  randomized  subjects  according  to  their  assigned  treatment 
groups regardless of the actual treatment received.  
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  ACR  20  response  at  Week  24  was  compared  between  the  combined 
ustekinumab  group  (45  mg  group  and  90  mg  group  combined),  each  individual  dose  group  and  the 
placebo  group.  The  re-randomization  test  was  used  as  the  primary  statistical  testing  method  to 
determine  the  p-values  for  these  comparisons.  In  addition,  a  CMH  test,  stratified  by  baseline  MTX 
usage (yes/no), was also performed for these comparisons as a sensitivity analysis.  
To  maintain  a  Type  I  error  rate  of  0.05,  the  pairwise  comparisons  between  each  dose  group  and  the 
placebo  group  were  performed  after  the  combined  group  showed  a  significant  treatment  effect 
compared with the placebo group at a significance level of 0.05.  
To  control  for  multiplicity  for  the  primary  endpoint  analysis  and  the  major  secondary  endpoint 
analyses,  the  5  major  secondary  analyses  listed  below  were  performed  sequentially  contingent  upon 
the  success  of  the  primary  statistical  analysis.  That  is,  for  each  endpoint,  the  test  between  the 
combined ustekinumab group and the placebo group was performed first. If that test was significant at 
the  0.05  level,  then  the  pairwise  comparison  between  each  dose  group  and  the  placebo  group  was 
performed. If at least one dose group comparison with placebo was significant at the 0.05 level, then 
the  test  for  the  next  endpoint  could  be  performed.  Otherwise,  the  p-values  for  the  subsequent 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report

Page 24/77 
 
 
endpoints  would  be  considered  nominal.  The  following  prespecified  order  was  used  to  analyse  the 
major secondary endpoints: 
1. The change from baseline in HAQ-DI score at Week 24 
2.  The  proportion  of  subjects  (with  baseline  ≥3%  BSA  psoriatic  involvement)  who  achieve  a  PASI  75 
response at Week 24 
3. The proportion of subjects with ACR 50 response at Week 24 
4. The proportion of subjects with ACR 70 response at Week 24 
5.  The  change  from  baseline  in  total  radiographic  scores  of  the  hands  and  feet  at  Week  24  based  on 
the pooled data from CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002, which are not available yet and will 
be summarized in a separate report after the Week 52 DBL.  
Nominal  p-values  were  reported  for  all  other  endpoints.  The  ordering  of  the  secondary  endpoints 
prevents any problems of error inflation caused by testing multiple endpoints.

The  study  population  comprised  615  randomized  subjects  in  104  sites.  Sites  were  located  in  14 
countries: Austria (3 sites), Australia (5 sites), Canada (19 sites), Finland (3 sites), Germany (6 sites), 
Hungary (6 sites), Latvia (2 sites), Lithuania (4 sites), New Zealand (4 sites), Poland (8 sites), Russia 
(12 sites), Spain (3 sites), United Kingdom (6 sites) and the United States (23 sites). 
The majority of the subjects were enrolled in Europe (64.6%) followed by North America (28.5%) and 
Asia-Pacific  (7.0%)  which  includes  subjects  from  New  Zealand  and  Australia.  Consent  was  obtained 
from  the  first  subject  on  30  Nov  2009.  The  last  study-related  procedure  for  the  24-Week  CSR  was 
performed 27 Oct 2011. 
Conduct of the study 
There  were  four  amendments  to  the  protocol.  The  first  amendment  was  on  16  Oct  2009,  the  second 
was on 30 Apr 2010, the third was on 27 Oct 2010 and the fourth was on 16 Feb 2012. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were similar across treatment groups and indicative 
of  the  protocol-defined  population  of  subjects  with  active  PsA.  The  majority  of  randomized  subjects 
were men (53.7%) and the median subject age was 48 years. Subjects were predominantly Caucasian 
(96.6%). Subjects’ median weight was 86.0 kg and median body mass index (BMI) was 29.7 kg/m2.  
The  most  prevalent  PsA  subtype  was  polyarticular  arthritis  with  no  rheumatoid  arthritis  (37.9%  of 
subjects).  As  commonly  observed  in  the  PsA  population,  the  median  duration  of  Ps  (13.2  years)  was 
substantially greater than the median duration of PsA (4.03 years).  
The majority of subjects (71.5%) had at least 3% BSA involved by Ps, a median percent of BSA skin 
involvement of 11.0% and the median PASI score was 8.0, indicative of a study population with active 
Ps.  
The included population had moderate to severe disease with a median numbers of swollen and tender 
joints  of  10.0  and  20.0,  respectively,  a  median  HAQ-DI  score  of  1.25,  and  a  median  CRP  of  10.30 
mg/L.  
While using the DAS28 score may be problematic in PsA with oligoarticular disease or where the lower 
limbs are predominantly involved, it is clear that the median DAS28 score was high. 
The mean BASDAI score was >6/10 for those with spondylitis. 48.1% of subjects had dactylitis with a 
median  score  of  4.0  and  71.7%  of  subjects  had  enthesitis  with  a  median  score  of  4.0.  The  high 
proportions  of  subjects  with  dactylitis/enthesitis/skin  disease  and  to  a  lesser  extent  spondylitis,  allow 
assessment of efficacy across the many domains of psoriatic arthritis.  
Approximately  half  of  the  subjects  (48.1%)  were  taking  MTX  at  baseline  at  a  median  dose  of  15.0 
mg/week.  At  baseline,  15.6%  of  subjects  were  taking  oral  corticosteroids  at  median  doses  of  5.0 
mg/day.  The  majority  of  the  subjects  (74.5%)  were  taking  NSAIDs  at  baseline  and  the  majority  of 
subjects (79.5%) had prior DMARD experience. Subjects were naïve with respect to anti-TNF therapy.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
ACR 20 Response at Week 24 
At Week 24, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the combined ustekinumab, 45 mg, and 90 
mg  groups  (46.0%,  42.4%,  49.5%,  respectively)  achieved  an  ACR  20  response  compared  with 
subjects  in  the  placebo  group  (22.8%).  Both  p-values  by  either  the  re-randomization  test  (primary 
analysis)  or  the  CMH  test  (sensitivity  analysis)  were  significant  (p<0.001,  Table  2).  A  numerically 
higher  ACR  20  response  at  Week  24  was  observed  in  the  90  mg  group  compared  with  the  45  mg 
group. 
Table 2: Number of subjects who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24; randomized 
Subjects 
The primary endpoint was clearly met and was clinically and statistically significant. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the primary endpoint and to assess the 
impact  of  missing  data.  All  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  showed  results  similar  to  the  main  analysis 
results,  confirming  efficacy  and  demonstrating  that  the  conclusions  were  robust  and  not  impacted  by 
the data handling rules for missing data.  
Benefit  in  terms  of  ACR  20  response  at  week  24  was  observed  in  both  subjects  receiving  MTX  at 
baseline (26.0%, 43.4%, and 45.5% in the placebo, 45 mg, and 90 mg groups, respectively), and not

receiving  MTX  at  baseline  (20.0%,  41.5%,  and  53.4%  in  the  placebo,  45  mg,  and  90  mg  groups, 
respectively). 
Major Secondary Endpoint Analyses 
Improvement From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score at Week 24 
There was significantly greater improvement in HAQ-DI scores at Week 24 in subjects in the combined 
ustekinumab and ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups (all with a median change from baseline of -
0.25)  compared  with  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  (median  of  0.00)  by  either  the  re-randomization 
test or the test of analysis on the van der Waerden normal scores (sensitivity analysis) (p<0.001). The 
mean improvement in HAQ-DI score at Week 24 was numerically higher in the 90 mg group compared 
with the 45 mg group. 
PASI 75 Response at Week 24 
In  the  combined,  45  mg,  and  90  mg  ustekinumab  groups,  59.9%,  57.2%,  and  62.4%,  respectively, 
achieved a PASI 75 response compared with subjects in the placebo group (11.0%). Both p-values by 
either the re-randomization or CMH chi-square test (sensitivity analysis) were significant (p <0.001). A 
numerically higher PASI 75 response at Week 24 was observed in the 90 mg group compared with the 
45 mg group. 
ACR 50 and ACR 70 Response at Week 24 
At Week 24, a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the combined ustekinumab group and in 
each  of  the  individual  ustekinumab  groups  achieved  either  an  ACR  50  or  ACR  70  response  compared 
with the placebo group. Both p-values by either the re-randomization test or the CMH chi-square test 
(sensitivity analysis) were significant and consistent with the primary endpoint (<0.001). Numerically 
higher ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses at Week 24  were observed in the 90 mg group compared with 
the 45 mg group. 
The primary and all major secondary endpoints were met and demonstrated clinically meaningful and 
statistically significant evidence of efficacy. This held for those on and those not on concomitant MTX.  
For most endpoints efficacy trended higher for the 90mg dose.  
Other Secondary Endpoints 
Other secondary analysis included the following: 
ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 Responses at Week 12 
At Week 12, there was a significantly greater proportion of subjects in the combined ustekinumab, 45 
mg, and 90 mg groups who achieved an ACR 20 and ACR 50 response compared with subjects in the 
placebo group. There was a significantly greater proportion of subjects with an ACR 70 response in the 
combined ustekinumab and 90 mg groups (p=0.034 and p=0.016, respectively) but not in the 45 mg 
group (p=0.127) compared with the placebo group. 
ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 Responses Over Time by MTX Use at Baseline 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  baseline  MTX  use.  Similar  number  of  subjects  were  on  baseline  MTX 
(n=200) to those not on baseline MTX (n=209). Within each MTX stratum, higher ACR 20, ACR 50 and 
ACR 70 responses were consistently observed over time in the ustekinumab groups than in the placebo 
group.  In  general,  the  trends  observed  for  onset  of  response  and  timing  of  the  maximum  response 
within each MTX stratum were similar to those observed in the overall population.  
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 28/77 
 
 
 
A treatment effect was noted whether patients are on concomitant MTX or not, although the treatment 
effect is larger for those not on MTX. All efficacy results other than ACR20 in the 45 mg group trend to 
slightly  higher  values  in  those  not  on  concomitant  MTX.  However  efficacy  is  clearly  demonstrated 
regardless of MTX usage and the addition of ustekinumab to those on MTX therapy increases efficacy.      
ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70 Responses by Weight 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  baseline  weight  (≤100  kg  vs.  >100kg).  There  were  approximately  3 
times as many subjects in the ≤100 kg group (n=307) as in the >100 kg group (n=102). ACR 20, 50, 
and  70  responses  were  summarized  over  time  by  weight  (≤100kg  and  >100kg).  In  general,  similar 
trends as the overall population were observed in terms of onset of action and timing of the maximum 
response  within  each  weight  stratum.  Across  all  treatment  groups,  ACR  responses  generally  trended 
higher for subjects in the ≤100 kg group especially for ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses. 
The  trend  for  higher  efficacy  with  the  90mg  dose  for  both  weight  strata  and  for  higher  efficacy  in 
patients <100kg is consistent with the data provided for Ps and also with the PK data.   
DAS28 Response Measurements 
As  early  as  Week  4,  there  was  a  notable  difference  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  a  DAS28 
response in the ustekinumab groups and the placebo group (44.5% in the 90 mg group and 42.9% in 
the 45 mg group achieved a DAS28 response compared with the 18.6% in the placebo group).  
The  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  a  DAS28  response  was  significantly  higher  in  both  ustekinumab 
dose  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group  at  both  Week  12  and  at  Week  24  (p<0.001  for  all 
comparisons). At Week 24, the proportion of subjects achieving a DAS28 response was 66.7% in the 
combined ustekinumab group, 65.9% in the 45 mg group, and 67.6% in the 90 mg group compared 
with 34.5% in the placebo group. 
DAS28 Remission Over Time 
DAS28 remission generally trended upward over time. DAS28 remission was achieved by a significantly 
greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  and  individual  ustekinumab 
treatment  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group  at  Week  12  and  Week  24  (p<0.001  for  all 
comparisons  except  for  p=0.002  for  90  mg  at  Week  12).  At  Week  24,  the  proportion  of  subjects 
achieving  DAS28  remission  was  20.0%  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group,  20.5%  in  the  45  mg 
group, and 19.6% in the 90 mg group compared with 8.3% in the placebo group. 
Dactylitis at Week 24 
At  baseline,  approximately  half  the  subjects  randomized  (48.1%)  reported  at  least  1  digit  with 
dactylitis. At Week 24, among the subjects with dactylitis at baseline, the proportion of subjects with 1 
or  more  digits  with  dactylitis  was  significantly  lower  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  (56.2%, 
p=0.001), in the 45 mg group (56.6%, p=0.005), and in the 90 mg (55.8%, p=0.004) compared with 
the placebo group (76.1%). 
Enthesitis at Week 24 
At  baseline,  71.7%  of  the  subjects  randomized  reported  enthesitis.  At  Week  24,  among  the  subjects 
with enthesitis at baseline, the proportion of subjects with enthesitis was statistically significantly lower 
in the combined ustekinumab group (64.6%, p<0.001), in the 45 mg group (68.6%, p=0.018), and in 
the 90 mg (60.8%, p<0.001) compared with the placebo group (81.0%). 
Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index 
At  Week  12,  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  subjects  achieved  at  least  a  50%  improvement  in 
BASDAI  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  and  in  the  45  mg  group,  but  not  in  the  90  mg  group 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 29/77 
 
 
compared with the placebo group. At Week 24, a significantly higher proportion of subjects achieved at 
least a 50% improvement in BASDAI in the combined ustekinumab group (27.9%, p=0.023) and the 
90  mg  group  (31.7%,  p=0.014),  but  not  in  the  45  mg  group  (23.5%,  p=0.133)  compared  with  the 
placebo group (13.1%). 
At  both  Week  12  and  Week  24,  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of  subjects  achieved  at  least  a  70% 
improvement  from  baseline  in  BASDAI  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  and  each  of  the 
ustekinumab dose group as compared with the placebo group. At Week 24, the proportion of subjects 
achieving  at  least  a  70%  improvement  in  BASDAI  was  14.4%  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group 
(p=0.002), 13.7% in the 45 mg group (p=0.003), and 15.0% in the 90 mg group (p=0.002) compared 
with 0% in the placebo group. 
A small number of subjects showed at least 90% improvement in the 90 mg group (3/59 at Week 12 
and  4/60  Week  24)  while  no  subjects  in  either  the  45  mg  group  or  the  placebo  group  achieved  this 
level of improvement at either week. 
Impact of Ustekinumab on Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) 
The  impact  of  ustekinumab  on  DLQI  was  assessed  by  comparing  the  change  in  DLQI  scores  from 
baseline for those subjects with ≥3% BSA at baseline. At Week 16 and Week 24, there was a significant 
improvement  from  baseline  in  DLQI  score  in  both  ustekinumab  dose  groups  as  compared  with  the 
placebo  group  (p<0.001).  At  Week  24,  the  median  change  from  baseline  in  DLQI  score  was -6.00  in 
both ustekinumab dose groups compared with -1.00 in the placebo group. 
Change From Baseline in SF-36 PCS and MCS at Week 16 and Week 24 
At Week 16 and Week 24, the change from baseline in the SF-36 PCS scores was significantly greater 
in the combined ustekinumab group and in each of the individual ustekinumab groups compared with 
the placebo group (p<0.001). 
At Week 16 and Week 24, the proportion of subjects that achieved a clinically meaningful improvement 
(≥5 from baseline in SF-36 PCS score),  was significantly greater in the combined ustekinumab group 
and in each of the individual ustekinumab groups compared with the placebo group. 
At Week 16 and Week 24, the change from baseline in the SF-36 MCS scores was significantly greater 
in the ustekinumab 90 mg group compared with the placebo group (p=0.018 at Week 16 and p<0.001 
at  Week  24).  However,  the  comparison  between  the  45  mg  group  and  the  placebo  group  was 
significantly greater (p=0.005) at Week 16, but not at Week 24 (p=0.065). 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroups Defined by Demographics 
The  study  largely  enrolled  Caucasians  and  therefore  cannot  meaningfully  assess  the  ustekinumab 
effect on other races. For subgroups by age, gender, BMI and geographic regions, across both doses as 
well  as  in  the  combined  dose  group  versus  the  placebo  group,  consistent  and  significant  treatment 
effect  determined  by  ACR  20  at  Week  24  has  been  observed  across  different  subgroups  with  the 
exception  of  subjects  with  normal  BMI  and  subjects  from  Asian  Pacific  region  (New  Zealand  and 
Australia).  The  treatment  effect  for  both  doses  and  combined  group  versus  placebo  was  smaller  in 
subjects with normal BMI, in part due to higher placebo response rate (31.1%). The small sample size 
for subjects from Asian Pacific region limits the interpretation.   
Efficacy Responses by Subject Weight 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 30/77 
 
 
 
Randomization was stratified by baseline weight (≤100kg versus >100kg). There were approximately 3 
times as many subjects in the ≤100 kg group (n=461) as in the >100 kg group (n=154). 
Within each weight stratum, consistently higher ACR 20, ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses were observed 
over  time  in  the  ustekinumab  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  Across  all  treatment groups, 
ACR responses generally trended higher for subjects in the ≤100 kg group compared with subjects in 
the  >100  kg  group,  especially  for  ACR  50  and  ACR  70  responses.  At  Week  16  (trough  serum 
ustekinumab concentrations), the proportion of subjects with an ACR 20 response in the ustekinumab 
45  mg  dose  group  decreased  in  both  weight  strata.  This  dip  was  not  observed  in  the  90  mg  dose 
group. 
Efficacy in Subjects by Prior DMARD Use 
At  baseline,  79.5%  of  subjects  had  prior  DMARDs  exposure.  DMARD-naïve  subjects  had  a  larger 
treatment effect compared to subjects with previous DMARD experience.  
Efficacy in Subjects with Prior DMARD Use 
For subjects with prior DMARD use, the primary endpoint (ACR 20 at Week 24) was consistent with the 
overall  population.  All  major  secondary  endpoints  (ACR  50  and  ACR  70,  PASI  75,  and  HAQ-DI)  were 
also consistent with the overall population. 
Efficacy and Antibodies to Ustekinumab 
Subjects who were positive for antibodies to ustekinumab (6.2%) tended to have lower clinical efficacy 
when  compared  with  subjects  who  were  negative  for  antibodies  to  ustekinumab.  However,  antibody 
positivity to ustekinumab did not preclude a clinical response. 
The limited number of subjects positive for antibodies to ustekinumab precludes a definitive conclusion 
on the impact of antibody on efficacy. 
A lower effect but still a response is seen in those with ADA positivity as in the original plaque psoriasis 
programme.

controlled  trial  of  Ustekinumab,  a  Fully  Human  Anti-IL-12/23p40  Monoclonal  Antibody, 
Administered  Subcutaneously,  in  Subjects  With  Active  Psoriatic  Arthritis  Including  Those 
Previously Treated With Biologic Anti-TNFα Agent(s)) 
Study  CNTO1275PSA3002  was  the  second  phase  3  trial  presented  in  support  of  the  indication  of 
psoriatic arthritis. 
Methods 
The  CNTO1275PSA3002  (3002)  study  is  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel, 
multicenter, 3-arm study (with early escape at Week 16) of ustekinumab in subjects with PsA including 
those  previously  treated  with  biologic  anti-TNF  agent(s)  (February  2010-March  2012).  Approximately 
300  subjects  were  planned  to  receive  treatment  with  ustekinumab  45  mg,  90  mg,  or  placebo  SC  at 
Weeks 0 and 4 followed by q12w doses with the last dose at Week 40. Subjects randomized to placebo 
were to cross over to receive ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 24 and 28 followed by q12w doses with the 
last  dose  at  Week  40.  Subjects  were  to  be  followed  for  efficacy  through  Week  52  and  for  safety 
through  Week  60.  This  report  summarizes  data  included  in  the  24-week  database  lock  (DBL);  all  PK, 
efficacy,  and  safety  data  through  Week  24,  with  the  exception  of  the  radiographic  data,  for  all 
randomized subjects were included in this DBL. Radiographic data through Week 52 will be available in 
a subsequent DBL.

The expected duration of exposure to ustekinumab for enrolled subjects is 52 weeks. 
Completion of the Week 60 visit will be considered the end of the study. An additional DBL will occur at 
Week 60, with a future report planned to summarize the data through that time period.  
The  study  schema  through  Week  60  is  presented  in  Figure  8.  The  study  schema  for  study  3002  is 
similar to study 3001 except that it is shorter, has fewer subjects and also includes subjects with prior 
anti-TNF exposure.

Study participants 
As for Study CNTO1275PSA3001 except that: 
At  least  150  but  not  more  than  180  subjects  could  have  been  previously  treated  with  1  or  more 
biologic anti-TNF agents. Subjects previously treated with anti-TNF agents must have received at least 
8  weeks  of  therapy  with  etanercept,  adalimumab,  golimumab,  or  certolizumab  pegol,  or  at  least  14 
weeks  of  therapy  with  infliximab;  or  have  documented  intolerance  to  anti-TNF  therapy  for  a  shorter 
period of time. Additionally, subjects who were previously treated with anti-TNF agents and who had a 
history  of  latent  TB  were  permitted  to  enrol  in  the  study  with  adequate  documentation  about  having 
completed  appropriate  treatment  for  latent  TB  within  3  years  before  the  first  administration  of  study 
agent (subjects who were anti-TNF naive were not eligible to participate if they had a previous history 
of latent TB).

Section  4  of  the  protocol  contains  the  complete  list  of  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  as  well  as 
prohibitions and restrictions to which subjects were required to adhere during the course of this study. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized to 1 of the 3 groups and received treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 
mg, or placebo SC at Weeks 0 and 4 followed by q12w dosing, with the last dose at Week 40. Subjects 
randomized to placebo were eligible for crossover to receive ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 24 and 28 
followed by q12w dosing, with the last dose at Week 40. 
Objectives 
The  primary  objectives  of  this  study  were  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  ustekinumab  in  subjects  with 
active  PsA,  including  those  previously  treated  with  biologic  anti-TNF  agent(s),  by  assessing  the 
reduction in signs and symptoms of PsA and to evaluate the safety of ustekinumab in this population. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of ustekinumab in: 
 
 
 
Improving physical function; 
Improving psoriatic skin lesions; and 
Inhibiting  the  progression  of  structural  damage  (this  objective  will  be  addressed  in  a  future 
report) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved an ACR 20 response at Week 24 
Major  secondary  endpoints  and  other  secondary  analyses  were  the  same  as 
for  study 
CNTO1275PSA3001  with  the  additional  endpoint  of  assessing  Impact  of  Prior  Anti-TNF  Exposure  on 
Efficacy outcomes (ACR), HAQ-DI and PASI. 
Sample size 
The study was powered to detect significant treatment differences in reducing the signs and symptoms 
of  arthritis.  With  300  subjects  (100  subjects  in  each  treatment  group),  assuming  60%  MTX  usage  at 
baseline,  a  simulation  of  5,000  repetitions  was  used  to  calculate  the  power  to  detect  a  significant 
difference  in  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  an  ACR  20  response  using  a  CMH  test  with 
stratification by subjects’ baseline MTX usage (yes/no). The study  had over 99% power to detect the 
treatment differences (α=0.05) in ACR 20 response for at least one ustekinumab group compared with 
the placebo group, assuming an effect size of 20% to 25% for subjects not receiving MTX and 25% to 
30% for subjects receiving MTX, in achieving ACR  20 at Week 24. These assumptions were based on 
the data from the ustekinumab Phase 2 PsA study, C0743T10. 
Randomisation 
Randomization  was  stratified  by  investigational  site,  baseline  weight  (≤100  kg  or  >100  kg),  and 
baseline methotrexate (MTX) usage (yes/no) because these factors could have potentially affected the 
outcome  measures.  The  randomization  method  was  minimization  with  a  biased-coin  assignment 
(Pocock and Simon, 1975)23 in a 1:1:1 ratio, resulting in approximately 100 subjects in each group. 
This randomization method was chosen because some study sites might enrol only a few subjects and 
it would have been difficult to ensure balanced treatment assignments within each combination of site 
stratum,  weight  stratum,  and  baseline  MTX  stratum  using  a  traditional  block  randomization.  The 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 33/77 
 
 
 
randomization  using  minimization  with  a  biased-coin  assignment  minimizes  the  imbalance  in  the 
distribution  of  the  number  of  subjects  across  treatment  groups  within  the  levels  of  each  individual 
stratification factor. The  measure used to calculate lack of balance in the minimization algorithm was 
the variance. 
Blinding (masking) 
Blinding was as per Study CNTO1275PSA3001 
Statistical methods 
All statistical tests were 2-sided and performed at α=0.05.  
The  primary  analysis  was  based  on  all  randomized  subjects  according  to  their  assigned  treatment 
groups regardless of the actual treatment received.  
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  ACR  20  response  at  Week  24  was  compared  between  the  combined 
ustekinumab  group  (45  mg  group  and  90  mg  group  combined),  each  individual  dose  group  and  the 
placebo  group.  The  re-randomization  test  was  used  as  the  primary  statistical  testing  method  to 
determine  the  p-values  for  these  comparisons.  In  addition,  a  CMH  test,  stratified  by  baseline  MTX 
usage (yes/no), was also performed for these comparisons as a sensitivity analysis.  
To  maintain  a  Type  I  error  rate  of  0.05,  the  pairwise  comparisons  between  each  dose  group  and the 
placebo  group  were  performed  after  the  combined  group  showed  a  significant  treatment  effect 
compared with the placebo group at a significance level of 0.05.  
To  control  for  multiplicity  for  the  primary  endpoint  analysis  and  the  major  secondary  endpoint 
analyses,  the  5  major  secondary  analyses  listed  below  were  performed  sequentially  contingent  upon 
the  success  of  the  primary  statistical  analysis.  That  is,  for  each  endpoint,  the  test  between  the 
combined ustekinumab group and the placebo group was performed first. If that test was significant at 
the  0.05  level,  then  the  pairwise  comparison  between  each  dose  group  and  the  placebo  group  was 
performed. If at least one dose group comparison with placebo was significant at the 0.05 level, then 
the  test  for  the  next  endpoint  could  be  performed.  Otherwise,  the  p-values  for  the  subsequent 
endpoints  would  be  considered  nominal.  The  following  prespecified  order  was  used  to  analyse  the 
major secondary endpoints: 
1. The change from baseline in HAQ-DI score at Week 24 
2.  The  proportion  of  subjects  (with  baseline  ≥3%  BSA  psoriatic  involvement)  who  achieve  a  PASI  75 
response at Week 24 
3. The proportion of subjects with ACR 50 response at Week 24 
4.  The  change  from  baseline  in  total  radiographic  scores  of  the  hands  and  feet  at  Week  24  based  on 
the pooled data from CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002, which are not available yet and will 
be summarized in a separate report after the Week 52 DBL.  
5. The proportion of subjects with ACR 70 response at Week 24 
Nominal p-values were reported for all other endpoints. 
The  ordering  of  the  secondary  endpoints  prevents  any  problems  of  error  inflation  caused  by  testing 
multiple endpoints.  
Data handling rules and sensitivity analyses are as for study CNTO1275PSA3001

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 9: Subject Disposition through Week 24 
Recruitment 
The  study  was  conducted  at  71  sites  in  Europe  and  North  America.  Of  the  597  subjects  who  were 
screened,  312  subjects  were  randomized  into  the  study:  168  in  Europe  (53.8%)  and  144  in  North 
America  (46.2%).  Sites  were  located  in  10  countries:  Austria  (2  sites),  France  (4),  Germany  (6), 
Hungary (3), Poland (5), Russia (3), Sweden (4), the United Kingdom (9), Canada (11), and the United 
States (24) 
Conduct of the study 
There  were  4  amendments  to  the  protocol,  similar  to  those  for  Study  CNTO1275PSA3001.  The  first 
amendment on 19 Oct 2009, the second on 30th  Apr 2010, the third amendment on 27 Oct 2010 and 
fourth amendment on 13 Apr 2012.  
Concomitant Therapy 
Every  effort  was  to  be  made  to  keep  subjects  on  a  stable  concomitant  medication  regimen  (MTX, 
corticosteroids, and/or NSAIDs and other analgesics) through Week 52. The investigator was permitted 
to reduce or temporarily discontinue the concomitant medication dose because of abnormal laboratory 
values, side effects, concurrent illness, or the performance of a surgical procedure, but the change and 
reason for the medication was to be clearly documented in the subject’s medical record. 
Baseline data

Demographic  characteristics  of  subjects  at  baseline  were  similar  across  treatment  groups. 
Approximately half of randomized subjects were women (52.6%) and the median subject age was 49 
years.  Subjects  were  predominantly  Caucasian  (98.4%).  Subjects’  median  weight  was  88.3  kg  and 
median BMI was 30.3 kg/m2. 
The  baseline  PsA  disease  characteristics  for  the  ACR  core  set  of  outcome  measurements  were 
indicative of subjects with moderately to severely active PsA and were generally comparable across the 
treatment groups, with median numbers of swollen and tender joints of 11.0 and 22.0, respectively, in 
the  overall  study  population.  Median  VAS  of  patient’s  assessment  of  pain  was  6.80;  median  VAS  of 
patient's global assessment of disease activity was 6.20; median VAS of physician’s global assessment 
of disease activity was 7.10; median HAQ-DI score was 1.25; and median CRP level was 9.32 mg/L.  
Baseline  disease  characteristics  of  psoriasis  measurements  for  subjects  with  ≥3%  body  surface  area 
(BSA)  involvement  with  psoriasis  were  generally  comparable  across  the  treatment  groups  and  were 
indicative of significant psoriatic skin involvement with a substantial negative impact on health- related 
quality  of  life  (HRQoL):  median  percentage  of  BSA  psoriasis  skin  involvement,  12%;  median  PASI 
score, 8.30; and median DLQI score, 11.00.  
 Of  the  312  randomized  subjects,  180  (57.7%)  had  prior  anti-TNFα  exposure  and  132  (42.3%)  were 
anti-TNFα naive.  
At  baseline,  157  (50.3%)  subjects  were  receiving  MTX  and  155  (49.7%)  subjects  were  not  receiving 
MTX.  
Through  Week  24,  subjects  who  were  randomly  assigned  to  ustekinumab  received  a  median  dose  of 
180  mg.  Subjects  randomized  to  placebo  who  entered  early  escape  received  approximately  2 
ustekinumab  injections,  while  subjects  randomized  to  ustekinumab  received  an  average  of  3 
ustekinumab injections.  
Numbers analysed 
Of  the  312  subjects  randomly  assigned  to  treatment  at  Week  0,  104  were  assigned  to  the  placebo 
group, 103 to the ustekinumab 45 mg group, and 105 to the ustekinumab 90 mg group.  
At Week 16, 73 subjects met early escape criteria: 31 (29.8%) subjects in the placebo group entered 
early escape and received ustekinumab 45 mg; 20 (19.4%) subjects in the ustekinumab 45 mg group 
entered early escape and received ustekinumab 90 mg; and 22 (21.2%) subjects in the ustekinumab 
90  mg  group  entered  early  escape  and  continued  on  the  same  dose  regimen.  Most  discontinuations 
occurred at or before Week 12, well before the reported peak effect at Weeks 20 or 24. 
Discontinuation of Study Agent Through Week 24 
A  total  of  41  (13.1%)  subjects  discontinued  across  the  randomized  treatment  groups,  with  a  higher 
rate of discontinuation in the placebo group (23.1%) than in the ustekinumab 45 mg (5.8%) or 90 mg 
(10.5%) groups.  
Discontinuation of Study Agent for Subjects With Prior Anti-TNF Exposure 
Among  subjects  with  prior  anti-TNF  exposure  (n=180),  rates  of  discontinuation  were  higher  through 
Week  16  and  Week  24  compared  with  the  overall  population,  driven  by  the  higher  proportion  of 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 36/77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects  who  discontinued  in  the  placebo  group:  22.6%  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  compared 
with  3.3%  and  8.6%  in  the  ustekinumab  45  mg  and  90  mg  groups,  respectively,  through  Week  16, 
and  30.6%  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  compared  with  5.0%  and  10.3%  of  subjects  in  the 
ustekinumab  45  mg  and  90  mg  groups,  respectively,  through  Week  24.  Similar  to  the  overall 
population,  the  difference  between  the  placebo  group  and  the  ustekinumab  groups  was  primarily 
driven by the higher proportion of subjects in the placebo group who discontinued for efficacy-related 
reasons (i.e., lack of efficacy and worsening of PsA and/or Ps). 
Termination of Study Participation 
Through  Week  24,  33  (10.6%)  randomized  subjects  terminated  their  study  participation.  The  most 
common  reason  for  termination  was  withdrawal  of  consent,  in  13  (12.5%)  subjects  in  the  placebo 
group and 12 subjects (5.8%) in the combined ustekinumab group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis  
ACR 20 Response at Week 24 
At  Week  24,  a  statistically  significantly  greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  combined  ustekinumab 
group and in the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups achieved an ACR 20 response (43.8%, 43.7%, 
and 43.8%, respectively) compared with subjects in the placebo group (20.2%; each p<0.001), with 
no evidence of dose response. 
The primary endpoint was clearly met and was clinically and statistically significant. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the primary endpoint and to assess the 
impact  of  missing  data.  All  of  the  sensitivity  analyses  showed  results  similar  to  the  main  analysis 
results,  confirming  efficacy  demonstrating  that  the  conclusions  were  robust  and  not  impacted  by  the 
data handling rules for missing data.  
Benefit  in  terms  of  ACR  20  response  at  week  24  was  observed  in  both  subjects  receiving  MTX  at 
baseline (28.6%, 50.0%, and 40.4% in the placebo, 45 mg, and 90 mg groups, respectively), and not 
receiving  MTX  at  baseline  (12.7%,  36.7%,  and  47.2%  in  the  placebo,  45  mg,  and  90  mg  groups, 
respectively. 
Major Secondary Endpoint Analyses 
Improvement From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score at Week 24 
At Week 24, the improvement from baseline in HAQ-DI score was significantly greater in the combined 
ustekinumab group and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups  (median change from baseline of 
−0.25,  −0.13,  and  −0.25,  respectively)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (median  improvement  of 
0.00; all p≤0.002), based on the re-randomization test [secondary analysis] or the test of analysis of 
covariance on the van der Waerden normal scores [sensitivity analysis])). 
PASI 75 Response at Week 24 
At  Week  24,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  ≥  3%  BSA  Ps  involvement  at  baseline  who  achieved  a 
PASI 75 response was significantly greater in the combined ustekinumab group and the ustekinumab 
45 mg and 90 mg groups (53.4%, 51.3%, and 55.6%, respectively; all p<0.001) compared with the 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 37/77 
 
 
 
 
 
placebo group (5.0%). A numerically higher PASI 75 response at Week 24 was observed in the 90 mg 
group compared with the 45 mg group.  
Two  additional  sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  to  assess  the  impact  of  missing  data  on  this 
endpoint. Both sensitivity analyses showed results similar to the main analysis, demonstrating that the 
main analysis results were robust and not impacted by the data-handling rules for the missing data. 
ACR 50 and ACR 70 Response at Week 24 
At  Week  24,  a  significantly  greater  proportion  of  subjects  achieved  an  ACR  50  response  in  the 
ustekinumab  groups  compared  with  the  placebo  group.  Numerically  higher  ACR  50  responses  were 
observed at Week 24 in the 90 mg group compared with the 45 mg group.  
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  an  ACR  70  response  at  Week  24  was  numerically  but  not 
significantly higher in the combined ustekinumab group and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups 
(7.7%, 6.8%, and 8.6 %, respectively) compared with the placebo group (2.9%). 
Other Secondary Endpoints 
Other secondary analysis included the following: 
ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 Responses at Week 12 
The  proportion  of  subjects  who  achieved  ACR  responses  at  Week  12  in  the  combined  ustekinumab 
group (and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups) versus the placebo group was as follows: 
- ACR 20: 36.6% (39.6%, 33.7%) versus 17.5% 
- ACR 50: 14.9% (13.9%, 15.8%) versus 4.1% 
- ACR 70: 5.4% (6.9%, 4.0%) versus 1.0% 
ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 Responses Over Time by MTX Use at Baseline 
Among subjects treated with ustekinumab, response rates were generally comparable in subjects who 
were  and  were  not  receiving  MTX  at  baseline  (45.3%  and  42.2%,  respectively),  although  the 
treatment effect (i.e., the difference in response rates between the combined ustekinumab group and 
the  placebo  group)  in  ACR  20  at  Week  24  was  modestly  greater  in  subjects  who  were  not  receiving 
MTX  at  baseline  compared  with  subjects  who  were  receiving  MTX  at  baseline,  because  of  the  higher 
placebo response rate in subjects who were receiving MTX. 
ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 Responses by Weight at Baseline 
Randomization was stratified by baseline weight (≤100 kg vs. >100 kg). ACR responses at Week 24 in 
the combined ustekinumab group (and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups) versus the placebo 
group were as follows for the 2 weight stratums: 
•  ACR 20: 
o  ≤100 kg group: 44.9% (43.2%, 46.6%) versus 23.0% 
o  >100 kg group: 41.7% (44.8%, 38.7%) versus 13.3% 
•  ACR 50: 
o  ≤100 kg group: 24.5% (20.3%, 28.8%) versus 8.1% 
o  >100 kg group: 10.0% (10.3%, 9.7%) versus 3.3%

•  ACR 70: 
o  ≤100 kg group: 9.5% (8.1%, 11.0%) versus 4.1% 
o  >100 kg group: 3.3% (3.4%, 3.2%) versus 0.0% 
The response in those >100kg is less than for the lighter subjects. The expected increased efficacy at 
the  90mg  dose  is  evident  in  the  lighter  groups.  This  is  not  seen  for  those  >100kg.  There  were  221 
subjects <100kg and only 90 subjects >100kg and the relatively small number in each dose cohort for 
those >100kg may have impacted on the results. 
DAS28 Response Measurements 
When evaluated over time, the differences in response rates between the ustekinumab groups and the 
placebo group were evident as early as Week 4. By the second evaluation at Week 8, more than half 
(54.0%)  of  the  subjects  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  achieved  a  DAS28  good  or  moderate 
response, compared with 33.7% in the placebo group. The level of response was generally maintained 
through Week 24. Results for an LOCF analysis were similar. 
Dactylitis 
Of  the  312  randomized  subjects,  127  (40.7%)  had  dactylitis  diagnosed  at  baseline.  At  Week  24, 
among  subjects  with  dactylitis  at  baseline,  a  numerically  but  not  significantly  lower  proportion  of 
subjects in the combined ustekinumab and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups (61.9%, 65.2%, 
and 57.9%, respectively) had dactylitis compared with the placebo group (75.8%). 
At Week 24, numerically but not significantly greater percentage improvements in the dactylitis score 
were  observed  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  and  ustekinumab  90  mg  groups  (median:  −46.41  and 
−64.58,  respectively)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (0.00);  no  difference  was  observed  between 
the ustekinumab 45 mg group and the placebo group. 
Enthesitis 
Of  the  312  randomized  subjects,  221  (70.8%)  had  enthesitis  diagnosed  at  baseline.  At  Week  24, 
among subjects with enthesitis at baseline, significantly lower proportions of subjects in the combined 
ustekinumab  group  and  the  ustekinumab  45  mg  and  90  mg  groups  (72.9%,  75.7%,  and  70.0%, 
respectively; all p<0.05) had enthesitis compared with the placebo group (88.2%). 
Among subjects with enthesitis at baseline, a significantly greater percentage improvement in MASES 
score was observed at Week 24 in the combined ustekinumab and ustekinumab 90 mg groups (percent 
change  from  baseline  of  −45.80  [p=0.017]  and  −48.33  [p=0.008],  respectively)  compared  with  the 
placebo  group  (0.00).  Numerically  but  not  significantly  greater  percentage  improvement  in  MASES 
score  was  observed  at  Week  24  for  the  ustekinumab  45  mg  group  (percent  change  from  baseline  of 
−33.33) compared with the placebo group. 
BASDAI 
The change from baseline in BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index) scores was 
calculated at Week 12 and Week 24 only for subjects with spondylitis with peripheral joint involvement 
as  their  primary  arthritic  presentation  of  PsA  at  baseline  and  was  limited  by  the  small  sample  size 
(n=70).  Among  subjects  with  spondylitis  with  peripheral  joint  involvement  at  baseline,  numerically 
greater  improvement  in  BASDAI  was  noted  at  Week  12  and  Week  24  in  subjects  treated  with 
ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg compared with placebo, although no consistently significant differences 
were observed for the proportion of subjects who achieved at least 20%, 50%, or 70% improvement in 
Stelara II-29

BASDAI  between  ustekinumab  groups  and  the  placebo  group.  Only  1  subject  in  the  90  mg  group 
achieved at least a 90% improvement in BASDAI from baseline at Week 12 and Week 24  
The efficacy results for dactylitis spondylitis and enthesitis show similar trends as in study 3001.   
Impact of Ustekinumab on DLQI 
The  impact  of  ustekinumab  on  DLQI  was  assessed  by  comparing  the  change  in  DLQI  scores  from 
baseline for those subjects with ≥3% BSA Ps skin involvement at baseline. At Week 16 and Week 24, a 
statistically  significant  improvement  from  baseline  in  DLQI  score  was  seen  in  the  combined 
ustekinumab  group  and  the  ustekinumab  45  mg  and  90  mg  groups  (all  p<0.001).  At  Week  24,  the 
median  change  from  baseline  in  DLQI  score  was  -6.00  in  all  ustekinumab  groups  compared  with  a 
median of 0.00 in the placebo group.  
Change From Baseline in FACIT-F at Week 16 and Week 24 
A  statistically  significant  change  from  baseline  in  FACIT-F  scores  was  observed  at  Week  24  in  the 
combined  ustekinumab  group  and  in  the  ustekinumab  45  mg  and  90  mg  groups  compared  with  the 
placebo  group  (median  improvement,  all  3.0  vs.  0.0;  all  p≤0.007).  Similarly,  the  percentage  of 
subjects  with  clinically  significant  improvement  in  fatigue  at  Week  24  from  baseline  (≥4  points  in 
FACIT-F) was significantly higher in the combined ustekinumab group and the ustekinumab 45 mg and 
90 mg groups (49% for all) compared with the placebo group (25.8%; all p<0.001). 
Ancillary analyses 
Impact of Prior Anti-TNF Exposure on Efficacy 
For  subjects  with  prior  anti-TNF  exposure,  a  statistically  significant  difference  was  reached  in  the 
proportion  of  ACR  20  responders  at  Week  24  for  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  and  the 
ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups (35.6%, 36.7%, and 34.5%, respectively) compared with the 
placebo  group  (14.5%;  all  p<0.05).  This  was  also  true  for  PASI  75  at  Week  24  (47.1%,  45.5%,  and 
48.8%,  respectively,  vs.  2.0%;  all  p<0.001).  For  ACR  50  and  ACR  70  at  Week  24,  however, 
numerically  greater  but  not  statistically  significant  results  were  noted  for  both  ustekinumab  doses  in 
this population. 
The  improvement  from  baseline  in  HAQ-DI  score  was  significantly  greater  in  the  combined 
ustekinumab and ustekinumab 45 mg and 90 mg groups compared with the placebo group at Week 24 
(p<0.02 in all groups) for subjects with prior anti-TNF exposure. 
Efficacy in Subjects with Prior DMARD Use 
For subjects with prior DMARD use, the primary endpoint (ACR 20 at Week 24) was consistent with the 
overall  population.  All  major  secondary  endpoints  (HAQ-DI,  PASI  75,  and  ACR  50  and  ACR  70)  were 
consistent with the overall population.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A  comparison  of  the  efficacy  data  through  Week  24  for  both  Phase  3  studies,  including  efficacy 
measures related to joint disease (ACR 20, ACR 50, ACR 70, DAS28, PsARC, and BASDAI) soft tissue 
(dactylitis  and  enthesitis),  skin  disease  (PASI  75),  physical  function  (HAQ-DI),  and  quality  of  life 
evaluations  (DLQI  and  SF-36),  were  presented    by  the  MAH.  The  comparisons  are  focused  on  an 
evaluation  of  the  consistency  in  the  overall  population  for  the  magnitude  of  the  treatment  effect 
compared  with  placebo,  dose-response,  and  the  time  course  of  a  response.  Data 
from 
CNTO1275PSA3001  and  CNTO1275PSA3002  were  also  pooled  to  increase  the  precision  in  the 
evaluation of efficacy in subpopulations. A summary of the results is provided below.

Comparison of efficacy at Week 24 as measured by primary and major secondary endpoints; 
randomized subjects in CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002 
Comparison of other efficacy measures at Week 24; randomized subjects in 
CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002 
The  treatment  effects  for ACR  50  and  ACR  70  were  higher  in  CNTO1275PSA3001,  possibly  related to 
the fact that CNTO1275PSA3002 enrolled a more treatment refractory population with prior anti-TNFα 
exposure.  Across  both  studies,  90  mg  resulted  in  numerically  higher  ACR  50  and  ACR  70  response 
rates than the 45 mg. 
Both  the  Phase  3  study  CNTO1275PSA3002  and  the  Phase  2  study  C0743T10  enrolled  subjects  with 
previous  anti-TNFα  exposure.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  an  ACR  20  response  was  larger  for  all 
ustekinumab groups compared with the placebo group with or without prior biologic anti-TNFα therapy

exposure.  Of  note,  subjects  who  were  naïve  to  anti-TNFα  therapy  had  a  larger  treatment  effect 
compared  with  subjects  who  had  previous  anti-TNFα  exposure  across  both  C0743T10  and 
CNTO1275PSA3002 studies. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study C0743T10 supported proof of concept for ustekinumab in the treatment of PsA and also broadly 
supported the posology already licensed for plaque psoriasis (Ps). 
Two well designed pivotal studies were provided in support of this extension of indication.  The larger 
pivotal  phase  3  study  CNTO1275PSA3001  and  the  second  smaller  study  CNTO1275PSA3002  had  a 
similar study design. The differences were as follows: 
•  Study  Population:  in  addition  to  the  anti-TNF  naïve  subjects  as  in  CNTO1275PSA3001  study, 
CNTO1275PSA3002  study  also  enrolled  subjects  who  have  been  previously  treated  with 
biologic anti-TNF agent(s). At least 150, but no more than 180 of the 300 randomized subjects 
must have been previously treated with anti-TNF agents. 
•  Study  Duration:  the  last  dose  in  CNTO1275PSA3002  study  was  at  Week  40.  Subjects  were 
followed for efficacy through Week 52 and safety through Week 60. Database locks occurred at 
Week 24 and Week 60. 
•  Study Size: in study CNTO1275PSA3002 approximately 300 subjects were randomly assigned 
to treatment with ustekinumab 45 mg, 90 mg, or placebo SC at Week 0 in this study whereas 
in study CNTO1275PSA3001 around 600 subjects were included. 
Both  studies  included  ~50%  of  patients  taking  concomitant  MTX  and  assessed  a  large  number  of 
endpoints related to joints, heath related quality of life, dactylitis, enthesitis spondylitis and skin. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All  primary  and  major  secondary  endpoints  were  met  and  clearly  demonstrated  clinically  and 
statistically significant results for both doses in both studies, with the exception of ACR 70 response in 
study CNTO1275PSA3002 which showed numerical improvement.  
As 2 doses were used at the already licensed posology for Ps, analysis of efficacy by weight and dose 
was performed. Exposure in those >100kg on the 90 mg dose is similar to exposure in those <100kg 
on  the  45mg  dose.  Efficacy  was  higher  at  the  90mg  dose  for  ACR20  particularly  in  those  >100kg  in 
study  CNTO1275PSA3001  but  not  for  the  smaller  second  study  CNTO1275PSA3002.  A  relationship 
between  exposure  (serum  trough  levels)  and  weight  was  shown  and  therefore  the  proposed 
recommendation to allow for the higher 90mg dose in those >100kg is supported and is in line with the 
Ps licensed posology. 
In  study  CNTO1275PSA3001,  efficacy  was  seen  in  all  subgroups  consistent  with  an  effect  from 
ustekinumab  across  a  range  of  baseline  medications  used  for  PsA.  The  included  population  had 
moderate  to  severe  disease  with  a  median  numbers  of  swollen  and  tender  joints  of  10.0  and  20.0, 
respectively, a median HAQ-DI score of 1.25, and a median CRP of 10.30 mg/L.

Page 46/77 
 
 
 
 
While using the DAS28 score may be problematic in PsA with oligoarticular disease or where the lower 
limbs are predominantly involved, it is clear that the median DAS28 score was high. 
The mean BASDAI score was >6/10 for those with spondylitis. 48.1% of subjects had dactylitis with a 
median  score  of  4.0  and  71.7%  of  subjects  had  enthesitis  with  a  median  score  of  4.0.  The  high 
proportions of subjects with dactylitis/enthesitis/skin disease and to a lesser extent spondylitis, allows 
assessment of efficacy across many domains of psoriatic arthritis.  
A treatment effect is noted whether patients are on concomitant MTX or not.  All ACR and PASI efficacy 
results,  other  than  ACR20  in  the  45  mg  group,  trended  to  slightly  higher  values  in  those  not  on 
concomitant  MTX.  The  differences  in  efficacy  are  not  consistently  higher  or  lower  when  comparing 
concomitant MTX with monotherapy. Efficacy is clearly demonstrated regardless of MTX usage.      
Evidence  for  efficacy  in  each  of  the  components  of  the  ACR  is  demonstrated  also  showing  higher 
efficacy at the 90mg dose. This shows that efficacy is not restricted to symptoms only, as both clinical 
signs  (swollen  joint  count,  dactylitis)  and  measures  of  systemic  inflammation  (CRP)  all  show  a 
treatment effect. 
Efficacy results are consistent for joints, dactylitis, enthesitis and spondylitis. A small reduction in the 
numbers with enthesitis is shown. The reduction in the severity of enthesitis is not as marked as seen 
in dactylitis. It is also noted that accurate assessment of enthesitis is difficult.   
A clear exposure response relationship was observed for psoriasis, while it was less clear for PsA.  
A lower effect but still a response is seen in those with ADA positivity as in the original plaque psoriasis 
programme. The conclusion that ADA positivity does not preclude a response is agreed. 
The indication initially applied for by the MAH was as follows: “STELARA, alone or in combination with 
MTX, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when the response to 
previous non-biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy has been inadequate. 
Stelara has been shown to improve physical function (see section 5.1)”. In line with the Guideline on 
Summary of Product Characteristics, the physical function claim was not included in the indication in 
section 4.1 but placed as an information in section 5.1. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy  for  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  PsA  have  been  clearly  demonstrated  across  a  wide  range  of 
disease  manifestations  (joint,  soft  tissue)  in  patients  who  have  failed  previous  DMARDs  as  well  as  in  
those  who  have  prior  anti-TNF  exposure.  All  primary  and  major  secondary  endpoints  were  met  and 
clearly  demonstrated  clinically  and  statistically  significant  results,  with  the  exception  of  ACR  70 
response  in  study  CNTO1275PSA3002  which  showed  numerical  improvement.  Efficacy  was  seen 
whether ustekinumab was given as monotherapy or as an add-on to MTX.

The safety of ustekinumab was evaluated in safety data pooled from the 2 ongoing, placebo-controlled 
Phase 3 PsA studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002). These studies have similar designs 
and the PsA data summarized are derived from the following 3 studies: 
•  CNTO1275PSA3001 
o  Data through Week 24  for 615 randomized subjects as captured in the 24-Week data 
base lock (DBL). 
o  Data through Week 52 for 356 subjects randomized prior to 26 Oct 2010 who were to 
have completed their Week 52 visit by the time of the 24-Week DBL (either terminated 
the study or completed study through Week 52). This group of subjects is referred to 
as the 52-Week safety subset. 
•  CNTO1275PSA3002 
o  Data through Week 24 for 312 randomized subjects as captured in the 24-Week DBL. 
•  C0743T10 
o  Data through Week 36 for 146 randomized subjects. 
As  supportive  safety  information,  the  safety  of  ustekinumab  in  PsA  is  compared  with  the  safety  of 
ustekinumab  in  Ps.  Safety  data  from  Ps  studies  are  relevant  for  comparison  for  the  evaluating  the 
safety of ustekinumab in PsA for the following reasons: 
-  Ps  and  PsA  commonly  co-exist  in  the  same  patient,  and  patients  with  these  diseases  have  similar 
comorbidities and medical risks as supported by the following: 
-  Approximately 28% of the subjects in the Phase 3 Ps studies (C0743T08 and C0743T09) had 
a  baseline  medical  history  or  current  diagnosis  of  PsA.  Similarly,  approximately  75%  of  the 
subjects in the Phase 3 PsA studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002) had Ps with 
≥3% body surface area (BSA) skin involvement at baseline. 
-  The  PsA  and  the  Ps  populations  share  certain  risk  factors  such  as  increased  cardiovascular 
(CV) risk, increased body weight, and increased body mass index (BMI).6;7;17 
-  The  2  pivotal,  placebo-controlled  Phase  3  Ps  studies  (C0743T08  and  C0743T09)  had  similar  SC 
dosing regimens as the 2 Phase 3 PsA studies. 
Standard analyses of AEs focus on comparisons of pooled safety data from the combined Phase 3 PsA 
studies (CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002) with pooled safety data from the 2 pivotal Phase 
3 Ps studies (C0743T08 and C0743T09). For the analyses of less frequently occurring targeted events, 
pooled  data  from  the  global  Ps  studies  (Phase  2  C0379T04  study  and  3  Phase  3  studies  [C0743T08, 
C0743T09,  and  C0743T12])  were  used,  unless  otherwise  stated.  These  studies  were  selected  for 
comparison since they were conducted in generally the same geographic regions as the PsA programs 
and  would  be  expected  to  have  recruited  subjects  with  similar  demographics  and  comorbidities.  In 
addition, the C0743T08 and C0743T09 studies incorporated 5-year long-term extension (LTE) phases 
providing  supportive  long-term  safety  data.  The  database  for  the  global  Ps  studies  includes  safety 
information  from  a  total  of  3117  subjects  with  approximately  9000  subject-years  of  follow-up  and 
provides extensive clinical study safety data of ustekinumab. 
Supportive Safety Data from Crohn’s Disease Studies 
The  safety  of  ustekinumab  in  Crohn’s  disease  was  considered  relevant  because  the  Crohn's  disease 
studies  provide  additional  safety  of  ustekinumab  in  subjects  using  concomitant  immunosuppressant 
agents (e.g., corticosteroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid [5-ASA], azathioprine [AZA], and 6-mercaptopurine

[6-MP]).  Moreover,  safety  was  evaluated  for  higher  doses  of  ustekinumab  (up  to  6  mg/kg  IV)  in  the 
Crohn’s  disease  studies  than  those  administered  in  the  PsA  and  Ps  studies.  For  these  comparisons, 
safety  data  from  the  2  completed  Phase  2  studies  in  Crohn's  disease  were  used  (C0379T07  and 
C0743T26, Table 5).

In the combined Phase 3 PsA studies, the proportions of subjects with AEs and the types of AEs were 
generally  comparable  across  all  treatment  groups  without  any  clear  dose  response  or  pattern. 
Furthermore, there were  no disproportionate increases in rates or  notable changes in the patterns or 
types of AEs observed over time. 
Through the Placebo-controlled Period 
Combined Phase 3 PsA Studies 
Through  Week  16,  the  proportions  of  subjects  with  AEs  after  the  first  administration  of  study  agent 
were  similar  across  all  treatment  groups  (47.9%  in  the  placebo  group,  48.4%  in  the  45  mg  group, 
49.4% in the 90 mg group, and 48.9% in the combined ustekinumab group). 
In  general,  the  proportions  of  subjects  with  AEs  and  the  types  of  AEs  were  comparable  across 
treatment  groups  without  any  clear  dose  response.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  (occurred  in 
≥2% of subjects in any group) during the placebo-controlled period are presented in Table 6.  
Table 6. Number of subjects with 1 or more treatment-emergent adverse events in at least 
2% of the subjects in any treatment group during the controlled portions of clinical trials by 
preferred term; treated subjects in Phase 3 PsA and Ps studies  
AEs of nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, oropharyngeal pain, and back 
pain  were  reported  more  frequently  in  ustekinumab-treated  subjects  compared  with  placebo-treated 
subjects without clear evidence of a dose response.  
These  AEs  are  generally  consistent  with  known  ADRs  for  ustekinumab  with  the  exceptions  of  nausea 
and arthralgia. The >2% difference in the proportion of subjects with the PT of nausea in the combined 
ustekinumab and placebo groups accounts for the difference observed in the Gastrointestinal disorders 
SOC. Rates of nausea were >4-fold higher in ustekinumab-treated groups in the combined Phase 3 PsA 
studies. Rates of arthralgia were 2.5-fold higher in ustekinumab-treated groups in the combined Phase 
3 PsA studies (Table 6). These data supported the determination of arthralgia and nausea as new ADRs. 
Dental infections was also additionally identified as a new ADR. 
The absence of a dose response in terms of safety profile was demonstrated in the 5 years long-term 
maintenance of efficacy and safety update provided for ustekinumab in Ps (type II variation 028).  In 
the PsA population new ADR of arthralgia, nausea and dental infections have been identified.

Through Week 24 
As observed in the placebo-controlled period, the proportions of subjects with treatment-emergent AEs 
through  Week  24  in  the  combined  Phase  3  PsA  studies  were  similar  between  placebo-treated  and 
ustekinumab-treated subjects and between the 45 mg and 90 mg groups (55.0% in the placebo group, 
54.9%  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group,  59.7%  in  the  45  mg  group,  and  58.1%  in  the  90  mg 
group; Table 7).  
AEs that occurred in ≥2% of subjects in any treatment group through Week 24 are presented in Table 
7.  The  proportions  of  subjects  with  AEs  and  the  types  of  AEs  were  generally  comparable  across  the 
ustekinumab treatment groups without any clear dose response relationship with the exception of ALT 
elevations  which  were  reported  in  a  greater  proportion  of  subjects  in  the  90  mg  group  (2.9%) 
compared with the 45 mg group (1.6%). Analyses of markedly abnormal clinical chemistry values did 
not suggest any association between ustekinumab treatment and ALT elevation.

Through Week 52 
Among  the  615  randomized  subjects  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  study,  data  for  347  ustekinumab-
treated  subjects  (52-Week  safety  subset)  and  data  from  1965  ustekinumab-treated  subjects  in  the 
combined  the  C0743T08  and  C0743T09  Ps  studies  through  Week  52  are  presented.  Safety  data 
through Week 52 are not currently available for the ongoing CNTO1275PSA3002 study. Consideration 
should be given for the difference in group sizes when comparing the 2 populations at Week 52. 
Consistent  with  the  results  through  Week  24,  the  SOCs  with  the  highest  proportions  of  AEs  through 
Week 52 were Infections and infestations (39.2% in the combined ustekinumab group) followed by the 
Stelara II-29

Musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  (13.8%  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group),  and 
gastrointestinal disorders (12.1% in the combined ustekinumab group). 
AEs that occurred in ≥5% of subjects in any treatment group through Week 52 are presented in Table

The  proportions  of  subjects  with  AEs  and  the  types  of  AEs  were  generally  comparable  across  the 
ustekinumab  treatment  groups  without  any  clear  dose-responses.  Overall,  the  types  of  AEs  were 
similar to that reported at earlier time points.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No  deaths  were  reported  in  the  PsA  studies  through  the  Week  24  DBLs  and  through  31  May  2012  in 
either  of  the  ongoing  CNTO1275PSA3001  and  CNTO1275PSA3002  studies.  Deaths  were  analysed  as 
targeted events . Through the end of the reporting period, there were no deaths in the combined PsA 
studies. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Through the Placebo-controlled Period Combined Phase 3 PsA Studies 
Through the controlled portion of the studies, all SAEs in the PsA studies and almost all SAEs in the Ps 
studies  (with  the  exceptions  of  2  subjects  in  placebo  and  2  subjects  in  90  mg  with  cellulitis,  and  2 
subjects  in  45  mg  with  intervertebral  disc  protrusion)  occurred  as  single  events  without  any  notable 
patterns  with  regard  to  SOC,  type  of  event,  or  treatment  group  in  both  the  PsA  and  Ps  populations 
(Table 9). 
The proportions of subjects with SAEs were comparable across the placebo groups and all ustekinumab 
dose groups in both PsA and Ps (Table 9).

The  proportions  of  subjects  with  SAEs  were  comparable  in  the  ustekinumab  45  mg  and  90  mg  dose 
groups  in  the  psoriasis  studies  with  no  disproportionate  increases  in  the  proportions  of  subjects  with 
SAEs compared with the placebo-controlled period (Table 10). 
Consistent  with  results  during  the  placebo-controlled  portion  of  the  studies,  through  Week  24  the 
majority  of  SAEs  occurred  as  single  events  without any  notable  patterns  with  regard  to  SOC,  type  of 
event, or treatment group in both the PsA and Ps populations (Table 10).

subjects)  of  subjects  with  available  data  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  (Table  11).  The 
proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent SAEs was higher in the 45 mg treatment group (5.8% 
[7  subjects,  all  of  which  occurred  in  subjects  randomized  to  45mg  and  not  in  those  who  early 
escaped]),  compared  with  the  90  mg  treatment  group  (2.5%  [3  subjects])  although  the  overall 
incidence  was  low.  Consistent  with  results through  Week  24,  the  majority  of SAEs  occurred  as  single 
events without any notable patterns with regard to SOC, type of event, or treatment group.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In  the  combined  PsA  studies,  markedly  abnormal  changes  in  haematology  laboratory  values  were 
generally infrequent with comparable rates among the treatment groups through Week 16 without any 
dose-related or clinically-concerning patterns.

Consistent  with  results  during  the  placebo-controlled  period,  markedly  abnormal  changes  in 
haematology  laboratory  values  through  Week  24  in  the  combined  psoriasis  studies  were  generally 
infrequent  occurring  in  comparable  proportions  of  subjects  among  the  treatment  groups  without  any 
dose-related or clinically-concerning patterns. 
Through  Week  52  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  52-Week  safety  subset,  markedly  abnormal  changes  in 
haematology  laboratory  values  remained  generally  infrequent  with  comparable  types  as  observed 
through  Week  24  and  comparable  rates  among  the  treatment  groups  without  any  dose-related  or 
clinically-concerning patterns. 
Clinical Chemistry 
In  the  combined  PsA  studies,  markedly  abnormal  changes  in  chemistry  laboratory  values  were 
generally infrequent with comparable rates among the treatment groups through Week 16 without any 
dose-related  or  clinically-concerning  patterns  In  the  combined  PsA  studies,  markedly  abnormal 
changes  in  chemistry  laboratory  values  were  generally  infrequent  with  comparable  rates  among  the

chemistry laboratory values remained generally infrequent with comparable types as observed through 
Week 24. The number of subjects with events did not increase disproportionately, and the proportions 
of  subjects  with  events  were  comparable  between  the  45  mg  and  90  mg  groups  without  any  dose-
related or clinically-concerning patterns 
Immunological events 
Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions (Including Anaphylaxis and Serum Sickness) 
There  were  no  subjects  who  experienced  anaphylaxis  or  serum  sickness  reactions  in  the 
CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002 studies through Week 24. 
In the CNTO1275PSA3001 study, none of the ustekinumab injections in subjects who were positive for 
antibodies  to  ustekinumab  were  associated  with  an  injection-site  reaction,  while  10  of  1671  (0.6%) 
ustekinumab  injections  in  subjects  who  were  negative  for  antibodies  to  ustekinumab  were  associated 
with an injection-site reaction (all mild). 
In the CNTO1275PSA3002 study, none of the ustekinumab injections in subjects who were positive for 
antibodies  to  ustekinumab  were  associated  with  an  injection-site  reaction,  while  7  of  602  (1.2%) 
ustekinumab  injections  in  subjects  who  were  negative  for  antibodies  to  ustekinumab  were  associated 
with injection-site reactions (all mild). 
Therefore, there was no apparent association between the development of antibodies to ustekinumab 
and the occurrence of injection-site reactions in the Phase 3 PsA studies. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The  overall  numbers  of  subjects  with  serious  adverse  event  (SAEs)  in  CNTO1275PSA3001  and 
CNTO1275PSA3002 through Week 24 were low.  Among ustekinumab-treated subjects, the proportion 
of subjects with 1 or more SAEs through Week 24 was similar between subjects receiving concomitant 
MTX  and  those  without  concomitant  MTX  (1.8%  vs.  1.9%,  respectively).  A  higher  proportion  of 
placebo-treated  subjects  reported  an  SAE  in  the  concomitant  MTX  group  (4.8%)  compared  with  the 
non-concomitant MTX group (1.8%). 
Stelara II-29

To evaluate whether there is a difference in the types of SAEs that occurred between subjects treated 
with concomitant MTX vs. those who received ustekinumab monotherapy, a summary table is provided 
that  presents  the  proportions  of  subjects  with  1  or  more  SAEs  through  Week  24  for  subjects  with  or 
without concomitant MTX by MedDRA system-organ class and preferred term (PT). Within subgroups of 
subjects  with  or  without  concomitant  MTX,  SAEs  occurred  as  single  events  in  each  treatment  group, 
without  any  notable  patterns  with  regard  to  SOC,  type  of  event,  or  treatment  group.  The  only  SOCs 
with  SAEs  occurring  in  more  than  1  subject  in  a  treatment  group  were  the  Gastrointestinal  disorders 
SOC  (2  [0.6%]  ustekinumab-treated  subjects  who  were  receiving  concomitant  MTX),  the  Nervous 
system  orders  SOC  (2  [0.5%]  ustekinumab-treated  subjects  without  concomitant  MTX),  and  the 
Psychiatric  disorders  SOC  (2  [0.5%]  ustekinumab-treated  subjects  without  concomitant  MTX). 
Additionally, there were no differences observed between the 45 mg and 90 mg groups, regardless of 
baseline MTX stat. 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 63/77 
 
 
 
In summary, the  SAE data presented by SOC and PT term through  Week 24 do not indicate that the 
nature  of  SAEs  is  different  between  subjects  treated  with  concomitant  MTX  and  those  treated  with 
ustekinumab  monotherapy.  SAEs  were  generally  singular  in  nature  and  no  patterns  of  SAEs  were 
observed  regardless  of  concomitant  MTX  use.  The  nature  of  the  SAEs  in  those  with  or  without 
concomitant MTX show no major differences and the numbers were limited.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Through the placebo-controlled period (0-16 weeks) in the combined Phase 3 PsA studies, the overall 
incidence of treatment-emergent AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent was low. The proportion 
of  subjects  who  discontinued  study  agent  due  to  an  AE  was  higher  in  the  placebo  group  (3.6%  [11 
subjects])  compared  with  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  (1.1%  [7  subjects].  The  proportions  of 
subjects who discontinued study agent due to an AE were similar in the 45 mg (1.0% [3 subjects]) and 
90 mg (1.3% [4 subjects]) groups.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013

The SOCs with the highest proportions of discontinuations were Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (2.3% [7 subjects] in the placebo group and 0.3% [2 subjects] in the combined ustekinumab 
group) and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (0.6% [2 subjects] in the placebo group and 0.3% 
[2 subjects] in the combined ustekinumab group) most likely reflecting a lack of treatment benefit in 
the  placebo  group.  Consistent  with  this,  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  agent  of  psoriatic 
arthropathy  and  psoriasis  were  highest  in  the  placebo  group  followed  by  the  45  mg  group  and  were 
absent in the 90 mg group (Other AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent generally occurred as 
single events without any notable patterns with regard to SOC or type of event and did not occur more  
Through Week 52 
Phase 3 CNTO1275PSA3001 PsA Study 
Through  Week  52  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  study  in  the  52-Week  safety  subset,  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation  of  study  agent  occurred  in  2.0%  (7  subjects)  of  subjects  with  available  data  in  the 
combined ustekinumab group. The proportion of subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation of study 
agent was higher in the 45 mg group (3.3% [4 subjects]), compared with the 90 mg group (0.8% [1 
subject])  although  the  overall  incidence  was  low.  Consistent  with  results  through  Week  24,  the 
majority of AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent occurred as single events without any notable 
patterns with regard to SOC, type of event, or treatment group. 
Adverse events of Special interest 
Infections 
Through the Placebo-controlled Period 
PsA Compared with Ps 
The  proportions  of  subjects  with  infections  were  comparable  across  the  placebo  groups  and  all 
ustekinumab  dose  groups  within  the  PsA  and  Ps  studies,  and  the  types  of  infections  were  generally 
comparable across all treatment groups without any clear dose response, with the exception of dental-
related  infections.  Consistent  with  the  analysis  from  the  Phase  3  PsA  studies,  more  dental-related 
infections (tooth infection and tooth abscess) occurred in ustekinumab-treated subject compared with 
placebo-treated  subjects  in  the  Phase  3  Ps  studies,  which  supported  the  identification  of  dental 
infections as an ADR. The most frequently occurring types of infections (occurred in ≥2% of subjects in 
any treatment group) were similar between the PsA and Ps populations without any notable differences 
in  the  types  of  infections  across  treatment  groups  or  between  study  populations.  Infections  that 
occurred  in  ≥2%  of  subjects  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  in  both  PsA  and  Ps  were 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and sinusitis.

Through  Week  24  in  the  Ps  and  PsA  studies,  the  most  frequently  occurring  types  of  infections  in  the 
combined  ustekinumab  group  were  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  sinusitis, 
gastroenteritis,  and  influenza.  There  were  no  clear  dose  responses  observed  between  45  mg  and  90 
mg groups in all the PsA and Ps studies.  
Through Week 52 
Phase 3 CNTO1275PSA3001 PsA Study 
Through  Week  52  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  52-Week  safety  subset,  treatment-emergent  infections 
occurred in 37.8% (131 subjects) of subjects with available data in the combined ustekinumab group.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 65/77 
 
 
The  proportion  of  subjects  with  infections  was  similar  in  the  45  mg  (42.5%)  and  90  mg  (42.4%) 
treatment  groups.  Consistent  with  results  through  Week  24,  the  most  frequently  occurring  infections 
were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. 
Serious infections 
Through  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  in  the  combined  Phase  3  PsA  studies,  there  was  1  serious 
infection in the placebo group (interstitial lung disease in the CNTO1275PSA3002 study), and 4 serious 
infections  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  study  in  the  combined  ustekinumab  group  (cholecystitis  in  the 
placebo→45  mg  group,  acute  cholecystitis  and  salpingitis  in  the  45  mg  group  and  pharyngolaryngeal 
abscess in the 90 mg group). 
Malignancies 
Through the placebo-controlled period (0-16 weeks) in the combined Phase 3 PsA studies, there was 1 
subject  in  the  ustekinumab  90  mg  group  with  squamous  cell  carcinoma  in  situ  in  an  area  of  cleared 
plaque psoriasis. 
Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) 
As  in  Ps,  patients  with  PsA  are  reported  to  be  at  increased  risk  for  occlusive  vascular  diseases, 
including MI and stroke.  At least part of this increased risk results from higher rates of cardiovascular 
risk  factors  such  as  hypertension,  hyperlipidaemia,  diabetes,  obesity,  and  smoking  in  the  PsA 
population. While Ps patients with PsA appear to have higher rates of CV comorbidities compared with 
Ps patients without PsA, whether PsA is an independent CV risk factor still requires further study. 
To  evaluate  the  potential impact  of  ustekinumab  on  this  population  risk,  the  incidence  of  adjudicated 
MACE  (cardiovascular  death,  nonfatal  myocardial  infarction,  non-fatal  stroke)  were  evaluated  in  the 
placebo-controlled  period  and  through  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  in  the  combined  Phase  3  PsA 
studies. 
Through the End of the Reporting Period 
Through the end of the reporting period across indications, there were: 
-  4  MACE  in  the  PsA  studies  (1  nonfatal  myocardial  infarction  in  placebo,  1  nonfatal  myocardial 
infarction and 1 nonfatal stroke in 45 mg, 1 nonfatal stroke in 90 mg), 
-  41  MACE  in  the  Ps  studies  (1  nonfatal  myocardial  infarction  in  placebo  which  occurred  3  days  after 
Week  12  in  a  subject  in  the  placebo  group  who  never  crossed  over  to  receive  ustekinumab;  3 
cardiovascular deaths, 15 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and 3 nonfatal strokes in the 45 mg group; 
and 3 cardiovascular deaths and 16 nonfatal myocardial infarctions in the 90 mg group), and 
- no MACE in the Crohn’s disease studies 
In the PsA studies, the event rates of MACE per 100 subject-years in the placebo, 45 mg group, 90 mg 
group,  and  combined  ustekinumab  groups  were  0.70,  0.78,  0.34,  and  0.55,  respectively.  In  the  Ps 
studies,  the  event  rates  of  MACE  per  100  subject-years  in  the  placebo,  45  mg  group,  90  mg  group, 
and  combined  ustekinumab  groups  were  0.55,  0.56,  0.36,  and  0.44,  respectively.  When  the  rate  of 
MACE was evaluated by the time period of exposure, (Years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), the event rates per 100 
subject-years of follow-up showed  no evidence of a dose response or an increase in event rates with 
increased  exposure  to  ustekinumab.  However,  the  interpretation  is  limited  by  the  small  number  of 
events and the modest year-to-year variability.

Through  the  end  of  the  reporting  period  in  the  PsA  studies  (C0743T10,  CNTO1275PSA3001,  and 
CNTO1275PSA3002), the SIR in the combined ustekinumab group was 1.24 (95% CI: 0.26, 3.63), and 
the  SIR  in  the  placebo  group  was  1.81  (95%  CI:  0.05,  10.08);  however,  CIs  were  wide  and 
overlapping. 
Serious Neurologic Disorders 
There were no events of RPLS reported in any PsA study with ustekinumab. 
Injection-site Reactions 
Through Week 24 
Combined Phase 3 PsA Studies 
Through  Week  24,  the  number  of  injections  associated  with  injection-site  reactions  was  low  in  the 
combined Phase 3 PsA studies regardless of the study agent administered, although a modest increase 
was observed in injections of 90 mg, (0.4% of injections of placebo, 0.6% of injections of 45 mg, and 
1.0% of injections of 90 mg). All injection-site reactions were mild, and none were moderate or severe 
or serious. The most common injection-site reactions through Week 24 were erythema and pain which 
are known ADRs. 
PsA Compared with Ps 
Through Week 24, there were similar average numbers of injections in each study agent group across 
the  PsA  and  Ps  populations.  The  proportion  of  injections  associated  with  injection-site  reactions  was 
low across all study agent groups and comparable between the PsA studies and Ps studies. There were 
no  moderate  or  severe injection-site  reactions  in  the  combined  Phase  3  PsA  studies,  and  3  moderate 
and  1  severe  injection-site  reactions  in  the  combined  C0743T08  and  C0743T09  Ps  studies.  The  most 
common injection-site reactions through Week 24 in both the PsA and Ps populations were erythema 
and pain. 
Through  Week  52  in  the  CNTO1275PSA3001  52-Week  safety  subset,  the  proportion  of  injections 
associated  with  injection-site  reactions  was  low  and  generally  comparable  across  all  groups  (0.3%  of 
injections of placebo, 0.5% of injections of 45 mg, and 0.6% of injections of 90 mg). All injection-site 
reactions  were  mild,  and  none  were  moderate  or  severe.  The  most  common  injection-site  reaction 
through Week 52 was pain. 
Post-marketing experience 
Post-marketing information has been accruing since the first approval of ustekinumab on 12 Dec 2008. 
As  of  30  Jun  2012,  ustekinumab  has  subsequently  been  approved  in  over  65  countries.  Global  post-
marketing  exposure  through  30  Jun  2012  has  been  estimated  as  120,462  person-years.  Biannual 
Periodic Safety Update reports (PSURs) have been generated for this product reflecting the assessment 
of  active  ongoing  post-marketing  surveillance  of  targeted  safety  events  as  described  in  clinical  study 
safety analyses, as well as broad overall safety surveillance as described below. 
Aggregate data from post-marketing reports are reviewed at defined intervals in conjunction with the 
preparation of the  PSUR to monitor for changes in the overall AE pattern for  ustekinumab over time, 
and for changes in the reporting frequency or severity of selected AEs in order to identify potential new 
safety  concerns.  In  addition,  trending  and  review  of  lot-related  AEs  or  product  quality/technical 
complaints  with  AEs  from  the  global  safety  database  are  conducted  at  defined  intervals  to  identify 
signals  related  to  product  quality  and  manufacturing.  Finally,  surveillance  with  trending  of  reported 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 67/77 
 
 
 
 
event frequency over time, as well as comparison of event reporting disproportionality with other drugs 
from  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  Adverse  Event  Reporting  System  (FDA  AERS)  and  the  World 
Health Organization (WHO) Vigibase databases is performed routinely. 
Through  30  June  2012,  7  PSURs  have  been  completed.  Hypersensitivity  reactions  (including  rash, 
urticaria) and serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and angioedema occurring in conjunction 
with ustekinumab therapy were identified from spontaneous reports and were identified as ADRs. The 
safety  concerns  of  serious  infections,  including  TB  and  Salmonella,  malignancies,  MACE,  RPLS,  facial 
palsy,  and  pregnancy  outcomes  are  under  heightened  surveillance.  While  the  complete  evaluation  of 
NMSC  has  not  suggested  a  causal  relationship,  a  post-marketing  case  report  was  published  in  the 
Australasian  Journal  of  Dermatology  which  described  2  patients  older  than  60  years  of  age,  who 
developed  multiple  cutaneous  SCCs  after  each  receiving  2  doses  of  ustekinumab.  Based  on  this 
information  the  sponsor  has  recently  added  a  warning  advising  prescribers  to  monitor  patients,  in 
particular  those  greater  than  60  years  of  age,  those  with  a  history  of  prolonged  immunosuppressant 
therapy  or  those  with  a  history  of  psoralen  plus  ultraviolet  A  light  (PUVA)  treatment,  for  the 
appearance  of  non-melanoma  skin  cancer.  No  additional  ADRs  have  been  identified  from  post-
marketing reports through 30 Jun 2012. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  MAH  assessed  safety  and  compared  the  relatively  small  safety  database  in  PsA  (213  patients 
for  >12months)  with  the  larger  Ps  safety  database.  In  view  of  the  similarity  in  patient  demographics 
and baseline disease characteristics that supportive information from the ~9000 patient years of data 
for  Ps  is  informative.  As  ustekinumab  is  licensed  as  monotherapy  for  Ps,  the  additional  information 
from Crohn’s disease is relevant although demographics differ markedly with those of Ps patients. 
There were no new safety signals arising from the data, no evidence for a dose-effect and no evidence 
for a more severe adverse profile for those on concomitant MTX. New ADRs reported in the PsA studies 
were arthralgia, nausea and dental infection. 
The absolute number of MACE events in the PsA studies are low but the event rates of MACE per 100 
subject-years  appears  higher  than  in  the  Ps  indication  where  there  is  over  9000  patients  years  of 
experience.  In view of the small absolute numbers it is not possible to conclude on any difference for 
MACE incidence in PsA from the data through to the end of the reporting period. It is also not expected 
that there should be a different safety profile for patients treated for PsA as opposed to those treated 
for  Ps  as  there  is  significant  overlap  in  the  manifestations  of  psoriasis  and  the  background 
demographics  and  baseline  risk  factors  for  MACE  are  similar  in  those  with  skin  and/or  joint 
manifestations of psoriasis.  Of note is that an additional 6 cases of MI (3 in each study) (5 recovered, 
for  one  case  recovery  was  not  reported)  were  reported  after  the  24week  DBL  and  for  5  subjects  the 
treatment was blinded. All subjects had at least 2 CV risk factors and half were on MTX. Monitoring of 
MACE  events  continues  as  part  of  the  ongoing  pharmacovigilance  activities  and  further  data  on  the 
safety profile of ustekinumab in PsA will become available from the two ongoing pivotal studies. 
In terms of the assurance from the Ps safety data the main different for the PsA indication is the use of 
concomitant  MTX.  While  supportive  safety  data  from  the  Crohn’s  disease  database  was  provided,  as 
these patients were taking additional immunosuppressive medication, there remains the potential for a 
worse safety profile with ustekinumab is given with MTX in this patient population.

2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
There were no new safety signals arising from the data, no evidence for a dose-effect and no evidence 
for a more severe adverse profile for those on concomitant MTX.  
The  RMP  provided  is  considered  appropriate  for  the  PsA  indication  and  the  same  risk  minimisation 
activities  than  for  Ps,  which  include  a  ustekinumab  educational  programme,  are  required.  All  safety 
concerns are appropriately reflected in the Contraindications, Special Warnings and Precautions for Use, 
and Undesirable Effects sections of the Product Information. 
Comparison  of  rates  of  important  safety  concerns  subject  to  specific  monitoring  (serious  infections, 
malignancies  and  MACE)  events  from  clinical  trials  and  external  datasets  in  the  psoriasis  population 
does  not  suggest  any  excess  risk  associated  with  ustekinumab  treatment.  This  is  conclusion  is 
supported by data from comparisons between the different patient cohorts in PSOLAR. 
2.5.4.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged and is currently yearly. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The beneficial effects demonstrated in PsA with ustekinumab include improvement of rapid onset in 
joint disease, plaque psoriasis, health related quality of life, and in addition some improvement in 
dactylitis, spondylitis and enthesitis. The positive effects on all these outcomes were maintained at 12 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 73/77 
 
 
 
 
weekly dosing up to week 24. The two pivotal trials were supportive of the proposed posology which is 
similar to that licensed in plaque psoriasis. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Demonstration of long-term maintenance of effect remains to be provided from the ongoing main 
studies. Submission of these data is defined in the risk management plan. 
The data on radiographic scores to support efficacy of ustekinumab in reducing the rate of progression 
of  structural  damage  in  PsA  is  not  yet  available.  Radiographic  data  will  be  available  from  Phase  3 
studies CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002 and will be provided as defined in the RMP.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most common unfavourable effects of ustekinumab include infections, fatigue and injection site 
reactions. Other adverse events such as skin malignancies and MACE occur at a rate seen in the 
psoriasis population. Three new ADRs were identified in the PsA programme: arthralgia, nausea and 
dental infection. No new SAEs no opportunistic infections and no deaths were seen in the PsA 
programme.   
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As in Ps, patients with PsA are reported to be at increased risk for occlusive vascular diseases, 
including MI and stroke. However, in view of the small absolute numbers it is not possible to conclude 
on any difference for MACE incidence in PsA from the data through to the end of the reporting period.  
It is also not expected that there should be a different safety profile for patients treated for PsA as 
opposed to those treated for Ps as there is significant overlap in the manifestations of psoriasis and the 
background demographics and baseline risk factors for MACE are similar in those with skin and/or joint 
manifestations of psoriasis.  Monitoring of MACE events continues as part of the ongoing 
pharmacovigilance activities as defined in the risk management plan. 
There is >9000 patients years of safety data for ustekinumab monotherapy in plaque psoriasis. The 
longer term safety profile for add on therapy to MTX remains to be collected in PsA. Further data on 
the safety profile of ustekinumab in PsA will become available from the two ongoing from Phase 3 
studies CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002   studies. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
The beneficial effects of ustekinumab in joint, skin, and in addition improvement in dactylitis, 
spondylitis and enthesitis skin and in quality of life endpoints are considered relevant. As there are 
limited treatments available for patients who have failed DMARDs for PsA, a treatment which has 
shown efficacy in multiple domains of the disease and in quality of life is a useful additional treatment 
option.   
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The favourable effect of rapid onset efficacy in those who have failed previous treatment for PsA is 
considered a very useful addition to therapies for PsA. Data on structural damage is not yet available 
Stelara II-29 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/431551/2013  
Page 74/77 
 
 
 
hence limiting the demonstrated benefit but this data is expected to be available in the future. This 
information will be established based on radiographic data collected from Phase 3 studies 
CNTO1275PSA3001 and CNTO1275PSA3002.  
The unfavourable effects are described in the SmPC and no new SAEs no opportunistic infections and 
no deaths were seen in the PsA programme.  No additional safety concerns are evidence at this stage 
for combined therapy with MTX. Longer term data will provide further information on this.  
Overall at this stage the favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable ones, particularly as efficacy and 
safety in Ps are well established and there have been no post-marketing signals for any adverse effects 
on joint.  In addition although the safety data base for Ps is limited to ~9000 patient years as 
compared with anti-TNFs, at this stage the safety profile of ustekinumab is considered favourable. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The beneficial effects of ustekinumab in joint, skin and in quality of life endpoints are considered 
relevant. As there are limited treatments available for patients who have previously failed DMARDs for 
PsA, a treatment which has shown efficacy in multiple domains of the disease and in quality of life is a 
useful additional treatment option.   
The unfavourable effects of ustekinumab include infections, fatigue and injection site reactions.  Other 
adverse events such as skin malignancies and MACE occur at a rate seen in the psoriasis population. 
Three new ADRs were identified in the PsA programme: arthralgia, nausea and dental infection. No 
new SAEs no opportunistic infections and no deaths were seen in the PsA programme.   
The favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects. The B/R balance for ustekinumab in PsA is 
considered positive by the CHMP.

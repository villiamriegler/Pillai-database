2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia B is a rare bleeding disorder which is x-linked recessively inherited and affecting ~1 in 
20,000 of the male population worldwide (Konkle et al. 2000). The disease is caused by coagulation factor 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 10/154 
 
 
  
 
 
IX (FIX) deficiency and classified based on remaining in vitro clotting activity, which in turn is closely 
associated with the clinical phenotype (Giangrande, 2005). 
Signs and symptoms of haemophilia B are variable; depending on severity of the factor deficiency and the 
location of the bleeding. Thereby, bleeding is characterized by spontaneous or trauma-induced 
haemorrhage into joints, muscles and soft tissues. Severe haemophilia B is characterised by spontaneous 
or traumatic bleeding episodes into soft tissues and joints, but also life-threatening gastrointestinal or 
intracranial bleeding may occur. Recurrent joint bleeding may lead to chronic arthropathy and disability. 
2.1.2.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The primary aim of care for patients with haemophilia B is to prevent bleeding which can successfully be 
managed with FIX replacement therapy. Replacement therapy with exogenous FIX provides a temporary 
correction of the coagulation factor deficiency by increasing FIX levels and thereby reducing bleeding.  
Haemophilia B can successfully be managed with FIX replacement therapy. Besides of acute treatment of 
bleeding episodes, prophylactic treatment with the deficient clotting factor should be the goal of 
haemophilia therapy to preserve normal musculoskeletal function (World Federation of Haemophilia 
2013). Therapeutic formulations of FIX are available as both plasma-derived FIX (pdFIX) and 
recombinant FIX (rFIX) products for treatment. Half-life of both pdFIX and rFIX is ~18 hours and 
prophylactic treatment is usually required 2 to 3 times a week in order to achieve a significant reduction 
of bleeding episodes. Recently products with prolonged half-life such as Idelvion and Alprolix were 
approved. 
Development of neutralising anti-FIX antibodies (inhibitors) is a serious complication of FIX replacement 
therapy. Approximately 1-3% of all patients with haemophilia B develop inhibitors following exposure to 
FIX. Among patients with severe haemophilia B, the percentage is however as high as 9%. Most inhibitors 
develop in early childhood and after relatively few FIX exposure days. In patients who develop inhibitors 
to FIX, the condition will manifest itself as an insufficient clinical response to FIX replacement therapy. 
The occurrence of FIX inhibitors shows some correlation to allergic reactions, and patients with FIX 
inhibitors are at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with subsequent exposure to FIX. 
2.1.3.  Management 
There are two main modes of therapy for haemophilia B patients: preventive treatment (prophylaxis) and 
episodic treatment (on-demand). 
Prophylaxis is the treatment by regular intravenous injection of FIX concentrate (FIX replacement 
therapy) to prevent anticipated bleeding and is the key to successful long-term outcomes in patients with 
haemophilia B (Oldenburg J, 2015). In an ideal setting, the number of spontaneous bleeds should be 
minimised in order to prevent the development of severe joint damage. Once joint damage has occurred, 
it will progress over the patient’s lifetime even if no further symptomatic bleeds occur in the affected joint 
(Aledort LM, 1994). Prophylaxis was conceived from the observation that haemophilia patients with factor 
activity levels >1% less frequently experience spontaneous bleeds and have much better preservation of 
joint function (Srivastava A, 2013). Historically, the aim of prophylaxis in haemophilia B has therefore 
been to keep the FIX activity >1% to minimise spontaneous bleeds, but the recent development of FIX 
products with extended half-lives has made it possible to maintain even higher FIX activity levels and 
discussions are currently ongoing with regard to the optimal FIX activity level required to avoid joint 
bleeds. Some experts have recommended aiming for a target trough level of 15% to 20% (Skinner MW, 
2012, Oldenburg J, 2015). A benefit of higher factor activity levels was supported by a Dutch study in 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 11/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
which modelling projected no joint bleeds with a level of 15% or greater (den Uijl IE, 2011). Another study 
predicted a rate of 0.6 joint bleeds per year in the typical haemophilia B patient aged 25-44 years, even 
with a trough FIX level of 20% (Soucie M., 2015). 
About the product 
The applicant Novo Nordisk has developed nonacog beta pegol, a recombinant human coagulation factor 
IX (FIX) product expressed in a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line and the production 
process is without any human- or additional animal derived materials. A 40 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) 
moiety is attached to the FIX activation peptide by site-directed glycoPEGylation. PEGylation increases 
the half-life of the protein, and the prolonged circulation time is believed to arise from a reduction in the 
efficiency of various elimination processes such as renal excretion, receptor mediated uptake, and 
proteolytic degradation. 
When FIX is activated during the coagulation process, the activation peptide and the attached PEG moiety 
are cleaved off leaving the native activated FIX (FIXa). Together with other cofactors, including activated 
factor VIII (FVIIIa) in addition to phospholipid and calcium ions, FIXa forms the tenase complex which 
activates factor X (FXa). Ultimately, this leads to the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin which again 
leads to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. 
The company applied for the following indication: “Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with 
haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency). Refixia can be used for all age groups”. 
Following assessment, the following indication was agreed: Refixia is intended for the indication of the 
“Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia B (congenital 
factor IX deficiency)”. 
The proposed posology for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding in patients 12 years and above with 
haemophilia B is 40 IU/kg body weight once weekly. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals 
may be considered based on achieved FIX levels and individual bleeding tendency. 
The posology for on demand treatment depends on the location and severity of the bleeding, please refer 
to section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Type of application and aspects on development 
The applicant Novo Nordisk A/S submitted on 7 January 2016 an application for marketing authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Refixia, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 26 February 2015. 
Refixia clinical development programme was designed to meet the requirements as set out in the EMA 
guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived FIX products 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009).  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Nonacog beta pegol finished product (FP) is a powder and solvent for solution for injection in a 12mL vial 
which is reconstituted with 4 mL 10mM histidine solvent provided in a pre-filled syringe using a medical 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 12/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
device, i.e. a single–use sterile vial adapter. The finished product, when reconstituted, contains 500 IU; 
1000 IU or 2000 IU of nonacog beta pegol (INN) as active substance. The other excipients are: sodium 
chloride; histidine; sucrose; polysorbate 80; mannitol; water for injections; sodium hydroxide (for pH 
adjustment); hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment). 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Nonacog beta pegol (also named N9-GP in this document) is a PEGylated recombinant human factor IX of 
about 98 kDa. The molecule consists of a Gla domain, two EGF-like (epidermal growth factor) domains, an 
activation peptide and a protease domain. Upon activation of nonacog beta pegol by FXIa or FVII/TF 
during the coagulation process, fully active FIXa is generated by proteolytic release of the activation 
peptide, and consequently of the PEG (polyethylene glycol) moiety. In its amino acid sequence the 
mature, activated form of nonacog beta pegol is identical to the endogenous activated human FIX. 
There are two possible PEGylation sites on the rFIX molecule (Asn157 and Asn167), both located on the 
activation peptide. Nonacog beta pegol is mainly mono-PEGylated (about 80%), and the distribution 
between the two possible PEGylation sites is approximately equal. 
Recombinant factor IX (rFIX) is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. The post translational 
modifications include disulphide bridges, γ-carboxylations, glycosylations, sulphation and hydroxylation. 
The γ-carboxylation cannot be determined for nonacog beta pegol due to the presence of the PEG group. 
The γ-carboxylation sites, N-linked glycosylation sites, O-linked glycosylation sites at Ser53 and Ser61, 
tyrosine sulphation site and hydroxylation site are the same as described for native human factor IX. 
The active substance recombinant human factor IX with a 40kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) covalently 
attached to the N-linked glycans in the activation peptide of the protein contained in the medicinal 
product nonacog beta pegol is to be qualified as a new active substance in itself. No pegylated rFIX 
products are authorised in the EU. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured and released by Novo Nordisk A/S Denmark which complies with 
GMP Guidance for the manufacture of nonacog beta pegol.  
The manufacturing process starts with the thawing of one vial WCB (working cell bank) of the rFIX 
producing CHO cell line, followed by its propagation in shaker flasks and then in bioreactors. The clarified 
harvest is concentrated. A dedicated viral safety step for inactivating enveloped viruses is included 
The downstream process consists of capture, purification and virus filtration steps for production of an 
rFIX intermediate which is subsequently PEGylated. Then, the AS is filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and 
filled into suitable containers. 
All process steps are appropriately described and process parameters which are controlled during 
manufacture (including microbial/ endotoxin control) are listed in tabular form including respective 
acceptance ranges/limits. Information on process times was provided in the dossier. Reprocessing was 
not claimed by the company and is therefore not authorised. 
The purification steps and the PEGylation reaction are well described. The PEGylation process is 
appropriately controlled to form a mainly mono-PEGylated rFIX product at the PEGylation step. 
Information on column and filter life time was provided; updated information on the maximum number of

cycles of column resins and potential carryover of protein or other impurities between column runs was 
given and the Company committed to submit data from ongoing studies (recommendation). 20nm virus 
filtration is performed as a second dedicated safety step for the reduction of small, (non-) enveloped 
viruses. .  
Control of materials 
The AS manufacturing process used non-animal and non-human derived raw materials.   
Sufficient details were provided on the manufacture, control and stability of this substance. A listing of 
raw materials used for cell cultivation was provided in sufficient detail. .  
A list of raw materials used for the purification and PEGylation including resins was presented. Most of the 
raw materials were commercially sourced and information of specifically manufactured raw materials is 
acceptable. Specifications of the different raw materials were provided. 
The initial definition of the 40 kDa PEGylation agent was considered inappropriate and the starting 
materials were requested to be defined at earlier steps. Thus, the PEGylation agent was redefined as an 
intermediate. Manufacture of this intermediate has been validated and is conducted under GMP; the 
analytical procedures for the intermediate have been validated as well. Impurities were suitably 
addressed. Based on long term and accelerated data, an appropriate shelf-life and storage conditions 
were defined.  The dossier has been updated with the information related to the intermediate 
(manufacturer, manufacturing process and control of critical steps, raw materials and control, analytical 
procedures, removal of impurities, stability data, CoA). The rFIX expression system was based on the use 
of a CHO cell line.  
The human rFIX cDNA used encodes the human wild-type FIX coding sequence.  
A tiered cell banking system was established. The cell banking procedure was adequately described and 
qualified in accordance with ICH Q5D. The storage conditions were provided. Characterisation and testing 
of the master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB) were addressed by studying identity, 
adventitious agents, genetic characterization, genetic stability and impurities. The protocol for 
establishment of a new WCB was provided. The number of generations and cultivation duration between 
MCB and WCB was indicated in the protocol for establishment of a new WCB. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The control strategy for the AS is based on risk assessments in order to define critical quality attributes 
(CQAs) as well as process parameters (PPs) with potential impact on the CQAs. IPCs are established for 
those CQA-impacting process parameters. CQAs are rated by their severity (mainly based on medical 
consequences) and a table was provided listing all CQAs including their severity, a rationale for the 
selection of the respective CQA as well as a rationale for the severity rating. The specification for the AS 
and IPC specification for the intermediate are as expected for this type of product. 
Limits were established for those PPs and IPCs during the process where the quality can be affected or 
should be evaluated. In addition, maintaining a controlled microbial quality is essential for the process 
and controls are in place. Process parameters are evaluated during review and approval of batch 
documentation. In-Process tests are evaluated separately before release of each active substance batch. 
If limits are exceeded, this is handled according to the non-conformity procedure within the Novo Nordisk 
A/S  Denmark, quality system.  
Appropriate shelf lives for the intermediates are also agreed.  
Process validation 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 14/154 
 
 
  
 
 
The process validation of the nonacog beta pegol AS manufacturing process has three key elements 
considered as essential for the delivery of an active substance with a consistent quality: 
Process design, including process evaluation studies and justification of impurity reduction: The 
identification of CQAs is based on thorough characterisation of the molecule, prior experience and process 
understanding. Process parameters for cell cultivation, capture, purification and PEGylation, were 
evaluated using a risk based approach with regard to their potential effect on the critical quality attributes 
and process performance. Relevant process parameters were selected for further investigation.  
Process performance qualification (PPQ), comprising three cell cultivation and capture batches and three 
purification and PEGylation batches: The PPQ of nonacog beta pegol AS was executed to demonstrate that 
the commercial scale process performs consistently and reproducibly. Based on experience, a PPQ with 
three batches for AS production were conducted. After production of the PPQ batches another two batches 
for clinical phase 3 trials were produced.  
The batch results have been considered satisfactory. 
Continued process verification (CPV) – extended monitoring of process performance by compliance to IPC 
and selected additional testing: A programme for CPV has been defined to ensure that the manufacturing 
process remains in the validated state throughout commercial production. 
During process validation the removal capacity of the manufacturing process regarding process-related 
impurities was investigated in lab scale experiments. The types of impurities are discussed in the 
characterisation section. Spiking studies and/or measurement of the impurities at different steps and on 
different PPQ batches were performed. In conclusion, the purification process consistently produces 
active substance of reproducible quality that complies with the predetermined specification and 
in-process acceptance criteria. 
Manufacturing process development 
Five manufacturing processes were used throughout the process development history.  
Two comparability exercises were performed. The first one compared the material manufactured at the 
beginning of the development and included the non–clinical, the phase 1 as well as phase 3 batches.  
The second one assessed changes implemented between manufacturing of the pivotal trial material and 
manufacturing of product intended for commercial use. The overall manufacturing process and operating 
parameters are unchanged.  
A comprehensive comparability exercise was carried out in accordance with ICH Q5E on both rFIX and AS 
batches and includes AS batches and commercial batches, i.e. PPQ AS batches. The pivotal and 
commercial batches of nonacog beta pegol are concluded to be comparable. 
Characterisation 
Structural characterisation and elucidation of the physico-chemical and biological properties have been 
performed on rFIX intermediate and N9-GP. The techniques applied are state-of-the-art and for several 
parameters, orthogonal techniques were used. Primary, higher order structures and post-translation 
modifications were investigated and conformity with native FIX was demonstrated. PEGylation was shown 
at the N-linked glycans Asn157 or Asn167 present in the activation peptide. 
Biological activity 
FIX is produced as an inactive precursor and is cleaved by FXIa (in the contact pathway) or TF/FVIIa (in 
the tissue factor pathway) to produce an activated two-chain form of FIX (FIXa), where the chains are 
linked by a disulphide bridge. When activated to FIXa, in the presence of Ca2+, membrane phospholipids, 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 15/154 
 
 
  
 
 
and activated cofactor FVIII, FIXa hydrolyses one arginine-isoleucine bond in FX to form FXa, resulting in 
a fibrin clot formation.  
In nonacog beta pegol, a 40 kDa PEG is attached to the activation peptide and upon activation by its 
physiological activators TF/FVIIa and FXIa at the site of vascular injury, the PEGylated activation peptide 
is released and nonacog beta pegol is converted to native and fully functional rFIXa. The irreversible 
inhibition of FIXa by Antithrombin inhibitor requires a mature and accessible active site, which is only 
formed upon full activation of FIX to FIXa. Since nonacog beta pegol is converted to native and fully 
functional rFIXa, it is expected that activated nonacog beta pegol will be inhibited by Antithrombin 
inhibitor similarly to native activated factor IX. 
For the determination of the nonacog beta pegol biological activity several methods were applied: rFIX 
activation by tissue factor and FXIa, thrombin generation after rFIX activation and FIX potency by one 
stage clotting assay (according to Ph. Eur.) as well as chromogenic assay.  
FIX activation was investigated with rFIX secondary reference material (SRM), Nonacog beta pegol SRM 
and plasma derived FIX (Mononine) and the results show generation of a rFIXa heavy chain (HC) and light 
chain (LC) similar to Mononine.  
Thrombin generation as well as FIX potency (chromogenic and one stage clotting assay used) was 
investigated and compared with commercially available FIX products (i.e. Mononine, Benefix, PEGylated 
Benefix). Thrombin generation potential revealed similar kinetics for nonacog beta pegol and Benefix 
when activated with FXIa or TF (tissue factor). Potency determined by the chromogenic assay was 
comparable to Mononine and Benefix. With regard to the one stage clotting assay result-dependence on 
the aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) reagent used became obvious and confirmed results of 
recent studies.  
In addition, thenonacog beta pegol functional properties regarding binding to FVIIIa and activation of FX 
in the presence of FVIIIa were similar to those of rFIX (BeneFIX and rFIX intermediate). No specific 
information on nonacog beta pegol inhibition by antithrombin was presented since the same behaviour is 
expected for activated nonacog beta pegol as for native FIX. 
Thus, the impact of the PEGylation on the rFIX capacity to bind FVIIIa and Antithrombin inhibitor was 
satisfactorily discussed and the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule.  
Product-related impurities 
The potential product related impurities correspond to size variants, rFIX PEG forms, sequence variants 
and other impurities such as rFIXa and Low Gla variants. For some impurities biological activity has also 
been determined. Levels are appropriately controlled.  
Stressed degradation studies were conducted to identify degradant pathways. Nonacog beta pegol can be 
considered as a stable molecule since the conditions used in forced degradation are very extreme and are 
not expected to occur during the storage and processing conditions.  
Overall, the impact of biologically active product-related impurities on clinical performance was 
sufficiently described. 
Process-related impurities 
During process validation the removal capacity of the manufacturing process regarding process-related 
impurities was investigated in lab scale and full scale experiments as discussed aboveProcess related 
impurities were identified including HCP and DNA. 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 16/154 
 
 
  
 
 
Most of these impurities are reduced below their limits of quantification (LoQ). Specification limits are 
included in the AS specification for specified impurities where needed.  All these impurities were studied 
in clinical and non-clinical trials. 
Specification 
The nonacog beta pegol testing is part of an overall control strategy established using quality risk 
management principles. The proposed AS specification is in line with ICH Q6B. The selection of tests to be 
part of the AS batch release and stability studies includes physicochemical tests (Ph. Eur.): appearance, 
pH of solution; identity, purity, impurities, potency, bioburden and endotoxins. Acceptance criteria were 
set based on batch data as well as on process capability.  A commitment to recalculate the Specification 
limits for AS for two specified parameters when more commercial-scale batches are available has been 
included in the recommendations.  
Analytical methods 
Non-compendial methods were adequately validated according to ICHQ2. Verification for the compendial 
methods bacterial endotoxin and microbial count was demonstrated.  
The anti-HCP antibodies and HCP reference standard were made using a parental, non-transfected null 
cell line. The strategy is acceptable since it is in accordance with the new HCP chapter (Ph. Eur. chapter 
2.6.34).  
Potency by One-stage clotting assay: The method is a standard one-stage clotting assay that meets the 
requirements of Ph. Eur. - assay of human coagulation factor IX. The assay involves simulation of a part 
of the coagulation cascade leading to the formation of a clot. A sample containing nonacog beta pegol is 
mixed with human factor IX deficient plasma, aPTT reagent and calcium chloride, the clotting reaction is 
initiated and the coagulation in the reaction cuvette is followed. 
Batch analysis 
Details of the batches (pilot scale and commercial scale AS batches) produced throughout development 
from 2008 to 2015 were provided, including those used in clinical studies. The provided batch analyses 
include not only the parameters followed in the AS specification on AS and on rFIX intermediate but also 
some IPC performed for consistency demonstration. All the data met the acceptance criteria. The batch 
analysis data reflect quite well that the changes introduced during process development lead to an AS 
with higher purity in relation to product and process-related impurities, e.g. improved control of HCP 
levels. Hence, specification criteria were revised and adapted respectively. Overall, all acceptance criteria 
were met for all batches, supporting that the manufacturing process is capable of delivering an AS 
product of a consistent and appropriate quality. 
Reference standards 
The current in house reference standard was produced from a clinical phase 3 production batch and is 
used as a reference for assignment of protein content and potency to nonacog beta pegol secondary 
reference material (SRM). Potency was calibrated against the current WHO International standard for FIX 
concentrates. From the same clinical AS batch, a secondary reference material, was produced and is used 
for quality control of Nonacog beta pegol AS and FP. Potency was calibrated also against the WHO FIX 
International Standard (IS). An appropriate protocol for establishment of future SRMs has been provided.

Stability 
A shelf life for Nonacog beta pegol AS is agreed. The stability results indicate that the drug substance is 
sufficiently stable and justify the proposed shelf life in the proposed container. 
The container closure system is appropriately sterilized and suitable extractable and leachable studies 
were performed. 
Regarding the stability data of the AS, the assessment focused on commercial batches  stored in 
containers representative of the container closure system to be used for marketing.For the PPQ batches, 
stability under long term and accelerated conditions were provided. 
All results for the long term as well as the accelerated study fulfil the specification for commercial 
production. Updated stability data were provided which support the accepted shelf life. 
Post-approval change management protocol (PACMP) 
For future commercial development the applicant is planning  to make some changes to the AS 
manufacturing process. Agreements to the PAMCP made during licencing procedure will be taken into 
account by the applicant. Finished Medicinal Product- Nonacog beta pegol FP

The pharmaceutical development of nonacog beta pegol was carried out in several stages during clinical 
development.  
The pharmaceutical development has been based on considerations of the degradation pathways of 
nonacog beta pegol and experience with NovoSeven, another recombinant coagulation factor marketed 
by the manufacturer. Comparability of the finished product from the different development stages and 
manufacturing sites was demonstrated by comparing release results as well as long-term and accelerated 
stability data. Some minor differences were observed but overall the presented data support the 
conclusion that finished product batches produced at the different development stages are comparable. 
Medical device  
A vial adapter is provided for nonacog beta pegol finished product for transfer of fluids into and out of the 
vial. The vial adapter is sterile and disposable and is made of plastic. A drawing of the vial adapter, which 
is a CE- marked device allowing the easy transfer of fluids into and out of vials, is provided. A compatibility 
study covering suitability of the adapter regarding sorption, precipitation and discolouration was 
performed and all the quality attributes tested for the reconstituted FP complied with the specification. 
Neither precipitation nor discolouration was observed. Extractable and leachable studies were performed 
with sufficient details on the conditions used. 
Manufacture of the product and process controlsNonacog beta pegol finished product batch release is 
performed at Novo Nordisk A/S in Bagsværd, Denmark. 
The manufacturing process of nonacog beta pegol finished product consists of the following steps: 
formulation, sterile filtration; filling and lyophilisation. 
Process controls and corresponding control limits have been established to ensure consistent quality of 
the product. Critical steps and controls were identified by risk assessment of the finished product 
manufacturing process. Process times have been defined for the various process steps. As requested, 
lyophilisation,, in-process controls and critical steps have been fully described.  
Process validation  
The process validation programme comprised process design justification, process performance 
qualification and continued process verification.  
Data of batches manufactured at the intended commercial facility were used to justify the process design 
and demonstrate that the established process is robust and reproducibly delivers product with acceptable 
quality. Robustness of the lyophilisation step was shown by challenging the process by setting parameters 
to their extremes and monitoring of shelf and product temperature as well as of product attributes. Proper 
positioning of the scale label to the syringe with solvent was verified and a sterile filter validation was 
carried out as part of the validation programme. Results of routine process controls, release testing and 
supplementary testing show that the commercial manufacturing process reproducibly and consistently 
delivers nonacog beta pegol FP of the required quality. Sterile filter compatibility and leachables have 
been adequately addressed. For the compounding, sterilisation and filling steps, duration limits appear 
adequately validated.

Product specification 
The FP release specification includes physicochemical tests (Ph. Eur.) for appearance, water content and 
reconstitution time for powder. Tests on reconstituted product include physicochemical tests: 
appearance, pH, particulate matter, osmotic pressure, identity, purity, impurities, potency, sterility, 
endotoxins and excipient content. Methods which are also used for AS release are described in the active 
substance section.  
The specification limits for release and shelf life were established using knowledge gathered during 
pharmaceutical development, regulatory guidelines and pharmacopoeial requirements.  A commitment to 
recalculate the specification limits for FP for two specified parameters when more commercial-scale 
batches are available has been included in the recommendations. As a recommendation for further 
development of the product, a variation will be submitted to introduce skip tests for additional specified 
release tests of the reconstituted finish product once verification has been completed and appropriate 
specifications may be established. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analyses data including commercial scale batches have been presented. The batch analyses data 
show consistency of the product throughout development.

testing and levels of impurities are comparable for active substance and finished product.  
Reference materials 
See AS section. 
Stability of the product 
The applicant claims a 2 year shelf life at 5°C±3°C with a single period up to 6 months at ≤ 30°C which 
is supported by the data submitted. As detailed in the SmPC, after removal from refrigerated storage, the 
product must not be returned to the refrigerator and the use is instructed to record the beginning of 
storage at this temperature on the carton.Commercial batches were studied at long-term and accelerated 
conditions.  
The stability studies have shown that nonacog beta pegol finished product is comparable between 
different strengths. Stability indicating test parameters for  finished product have been used.  
In-use stability studies have been performed to investigate the product stability following reconstitution 
with histidine solvent. The data support the in-use period described in the SmPC, of 24 hours at 5°C ± 3°C 
or up to 4 hours at maximum 30°C. Studies show that the secondary packaging provides protection 
against light. The integrity of the container closure was tested under worst-case conditions.

Adventitious agents 
In general, the viral safety of nonacog beta pegol is well addressed. Several steps are taken in order to 
ensure adventitious agents safety: no human- or animal-derived material is used during the 
establishment of the cell banks or manufacturing of nonacog beta pegol AS and FP.  
There is appropriate testing for freedom from adventitious viruses at relevant stages e.g. cell banks. Virus 
validation studies (in accordance with the CPMP/BWP/268/95 guideline) have also been performed in 
order to evaluate the capacity of the nonacog beta pegol manufacturing process viral clearance capacity. 
With respect to the validation studies, global reduction factors were satisfactory regarding the virus 
removal/inactivation for enveloped viruses as well as for non-enveloped viruses. Two dedicated virus 
safety steps were shown to be effective in removing/inactivating potential viral contaminants. Further 
chromatography steps were shown to contribute to the overall viral safety.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Nonacog beta pegol (N9-GP) is a novel medicinal product, consisting of PEGylated recombinant human 
factor IX with a molecular mass of about 98 kDa. The rFIX protein consists of a gamma-carboxylated 
domain (Gla domain), two EGF-like (epidermal growth factor) domains, an activation peptide (which is 
cleaved off upon activation) and a protease domain. A 40kDa PEG-group is selectively attached to specific 
N-linked glycans (two possible PEGylation sites  Asn157 and Asn167) in the rFIX activation peptide.  
Nonacog beta pegol is developed and manufactured by Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark. rFIX is expressed in 
a CHO cell line under controlled conditions. The AS process consists of manufacturing steps, performed at 
the Novo Nordisk sites; cell cultivation up to the rFIX intermediate, PEGylation and further purification. 
Two dedicated virus safety steps are established and were shown to be effective in removing/inactivating 
potential viral contaminants. Further chromatography steps were shown to contribute to the overall viral 
safety. Some specification limits for AS have been tightened and are now deemed appropriate. However, 
for two specified release tests, , the limits proposed are approvable but will be optimised further as the 
applicant has committed to recalculate the specification limits when more commercial scale batches are 
available -.This is therefore included as a recommendation.  
Appropriate viral safety evaluation has been included  
Nonacog beta pegol finished product is manufactured (final formulation, sterile filtration, filling and 
lyophilisation),, labelling and secondary packaging of the finished product as well as attachment of scale 
to syringe for administration, by Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark. Some specification limits for FP have been 
tightened and are now deemed appropriate. However, for two specified tests, the limits proposed are 
approvable but will be optimised further as the applicant has committed to recalculate the specification 
limits when more commercial scale batches are available. This is therefore included as a 
recommendation. Skip tests will be introduced for additional specified release tests of the reconstituted 
finish product once verification has been completed and appropriate specifications may be established. 
This is therefore included as a recommendation.  
The pre-filled syringes with histidine solvent for reconstitution of the lyophilised product and the main 
production steps are: formulation, filling and terminal sterilisation. Batch release of the finished product 
is performed at Novo Nordisk A/S in Bagsværd, Denmark. The specification is acceptable. Skip tests will 
be introduced for additional specified release tests once verification has been completed and appropriate 
specifications may be established. This is therefore included as a recommendation. A well-structured and 
easy-to-read Module 3 was presented, no major objections were raised. All outstanding issues have been 
adequately addressed.

In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP has recommended somepoints for investigation as detailed in the report. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacological properties of nonacog beta pegol have been investigated in 11 in vitro studies and in 
5  in  vivo  studies  [FIX  KO  (F9-KO),  F9  knock  out,  mouse  models  (tail  tip  bleeding,  knee  injury, 
ferric-chloride injury) and haemophila B dogs].  
The safety pharmacology aspects have been included in the pivotal 4-week repeated dose toxicity study 
in Cynomolgus monkeys. PD drug interaction studies have not been performed. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Primary pharmacodynamic properties have been investigated in 11 in vitro studies and several in vivo 
studies. Acute and prolonged in vivo effects of nonacog beta pegol compared to BeneFIX, Mononine and 
N9 (rFIX produced by Novo Nordisk) were evaluated in F9-KO mice in three different injury models, the 
tail bleeding model, the ferric-chloride injury model and the needle induced knee injury model and in the 
haemophilia B dog.

the PEGylated activation peptide of nonacog beta pegol is cleaved of during activation, resulting 
in FIXa similar to activated BeneFIX 
nonacog beta pegol, N9 (rFIX) and BeneFIX were activated by FXIa at similar rates suggesting 
that FXIa activation was unaffected by glycoPEGylation while activation of nonacog beta pegol 
with  TF/FVIIa  was  reduced  mainly  due  to  an  increased  Km.  Once  activated  the  functional 
properties of nonacog beta pegol were similar to those of BeneFIX. 
The  effect  of  glycoPEGylation  on  the  binding  to  endothelial  cells  (HUVECs)  revealed  a  20-fold 
lower concentration of nonacog beta pegol compared to BeneFIX or Refixia.  
PEGylation  of  FIX  can  with  the  majority  of  aPTT  reagents  cause  a  specific  interference. 
GlycoPEGylation  of  BeneFIX  with  40  kDa-PEG  caused  same  aPTT  specific  interference  in  the 
one-stage clotting assay as seen for nonacog beta pegol. Therefore, observed discrepancies 
were not related to N9, but to the PEG moiety as the results for 40K-PEG BeneFIX and nonacog 
beta pegol were similar. 
Activity  of  nonacog  beta  pegol  is  overestimated  in  one-stage  FIX  clot  assay  using  most  silica 
based reagents e.g. APTT-SP due to PEG-mediated co-localisation with the activators FXIa and 
plasma kallikrein on the surface of silica particles, leading to premature conversion to FIXa.  
Activity of nonacog beta pegol is underestimated in one-stage FIX clot assay using Actin FS due 
to relatively slower conversion to FIXa after calcification compared with FIX. 
The aPTT reagent, SynthAFax was selected as as the most appropriate reagent for the one stage 
clotting assay for potency labelling and clinical monitoring.

•  Once activated, nonacog beta pegol has similar pro-coagulant properties as FIXa generated from 
BeneFIX in the one-stage clot assay. 
• 
The FIX activity of nonacog beta pegol is comparable to the activity of BeneFIX and MonoNine 
when  measured  in  the  chromogenic  assay.  In  addition  GlycoPEGylation  of  BeneFIX  did  not 
change the FIX activity. 
•  Comparable activity of nonacog beta pegol and BeneFIX was observed by TEG analysis of spiked 
(0.08 – 75 nM) haemophilia B blood. 
• 
TEG and TGA assays using FIX deficient blood or plasma, respectively, showed similar activity of 
nonacog beta pegol and BeneFIX or N9 (rFIX). In the TGA, however, a slightly lower amount of

thrombin was generated with nonacog beta pegol as compared to BeneFIX when TF was used as 
trigger.

Outcomes: 
• 
There were no differences in the acute dose response of nonacog beta pegol and BeneFIX after 
amputation of the tip of the tail in F9-KO mice measured by bleeding time and blood loss. 
•  Significantly prolonged haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol when compared to BeneFIX in 
the F9-KO mice tail bleeding model and FeCl3 induced injury model.

• 
The effect of one single 250 IU/kg dose of nonacog beta pegol was significantly superior to an 
equivalent dose of BeneFIX. The prolonged effect of nonacog beta pegol appeared to correspond 
to the effect of multiple doses of BeneFIX in the knee joint injury model in F9-KO mice. 
•  Nonacog  beta  pegol  dosed  at  0.4  mg/kg  had  a  significantly  prolonged  haemostatic  potential 
in haemophilia B dogs determined by WBCT and TEG compared to BeneFIX.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of nonacog beta pegol were evaluated by using F9 knock-out mice, rats, 
haemophila B dogs, minipigs and Cynomolgus monkeys and compared to those of BeneFIX (recombinant 
FIX product).

Methods of analysis 
Various  bioanalytical  assays  have  been  developed  to  assess  pharmacokinetics  of  nonacog  beta  pegol 
including one-stage clotting assays, two-stage chromogenic assay and antigen concentration determined 
by  Enzyme  Linked  Immuno  Sorbent  Assay  (ELISA)  or  by  a  Luminescent  Oxygen  Channelling 
Immunoassay (LOCI) assay. To minimise variation in the clot activity assays,  SynthAfax was  used as 
aPTT reagent in all the non-clinical assays where the one-stage clotting assay was used. Common for 
these  bio-analytical  assays  is  that  they  follow  the  protein  part  of  the  molecule  as  they  measure  FIX 
activity (clot), FIX antigen (LOCI/ELISA) or the full length molecule (ELISA sandwich capturing both FIX 
and PEG). Assays to detect binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies were developed to support the 
toxicology studies. 
Absorption  
Pharmacokinetic  attributes  of  nonacog  beta  pegol  were  compared  with  BeneFIX  in  F9-KO  mice  and 
haemophilia B dogs. The minipig was included as second non-rodent species. After IV dosing, nonacog 
beta  pegol  displayed  a  terminal  half-life  (t½)  ranging  from  41  hours  (ELISA)  to  67  hours  (one-stage 
clotting assay) in the F9-KO mouse to 113 hours in the haemophilia B dog (one-stage clotting assay) and 
76 hours in the minipig (ELISA).  
The t½ of nonacog beta pegol was in general 2- to 6- fold longer compared to BeneFIX. Clearance was 
7-fold lower in the minipig and 10- to 20-fold lower in haemophilia B mice and dogs when compared to 
BeneFIX. Following single IV administration the in vivo plasma recovery (Cmax) was 1.1-1.8 fold higher 
for nonacog beta pegol as compared to BeneFIX.  
Regarding the exposure ratios animal dose to human dose, the AUC0-t was 5-fold higher at the highest 
dose  in  rat  and  up  to  75-fold  higher  at  the  highest  dose  in  monkey,  compared  to  the  recommended 
prophylactic clinical dose of 40 IU/kg. 
Single dose PK in F9-KO mice comparing three different batches produced by two different manufacturing 
processes (phase 3 and commercial process) showed comparable PK profiles. 
Distribution 
Tissue distribution studies by using quantitative whole body autoradiography have been performed both 
with nonacog beta pegol and the 40 kDa PEG moiety itself. Studies were performed both in F9-KO mice 
and  Han  Wistar  rats  showing  very  similar  results.  Tissue  distribution  was  similar  for  all  tracers  and 
compounds.  Radioactivity was  widely  distributed  and  the  highest  levels  of  radioactivity  were  found  in 
highly  vascularised  tissue/organs  and  the  lowest  levels  in  the  CNS  (brain  and  spinal  cord).  A 
re-assessment of tissue distribution in selected tissues revealed variations between time points in the 
choroid plexus.  
Metabolism 
Selected plasma, urine and faeces samples from F9-KO mice and rats were profiled via HPLC and gel 
electrophoresis for metabolism. Data revealed that the 40 kDa PEG moiety is circulating in plasma for a 
longer time (t½ ~ 15-18 days) than nonacog beta pegol (t½ ~ up to 2 days). The protein part of nonacog 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 32/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
beta pegol is expected to be metabolised via proteases to minor components (peptides and/or amino 
acids) which is either endogenously reused or excreted in urine and faeces. PEG related components (40 
kDa PEG and smaller sized PEG molecules) were found to be excreted both via urine and faeces in F9 KO 
mice and rats. 
Pharmacokinetic  evaluation,  modelling  and  simulation  in  animals  and  humans  based  on  rat  tissue 
distribution data of nonacog beta pegol showed that once weekly dosing ofnonacog beta pegol to humans 
leads to an estimated steady-state PEG level after ~1 year in peripheral organs, and after ~2 years in the 
choroid  plexus.  The  predicted  rat:human  steady-state  plasma  and  tissue  PEG  exposure  ratios  were 
approximately 10 between the 26-week rat toxicity study and human prophylaxis nonacog beta pegol 
dosing of 40 IU/kg/week. 
Excretion 
Excretion of the PEG moiety has been investigated in F9-KO mice and rats following single IV dosing of 
(3H or 14C) nonacog beta pegol. In accordance with the distribution data, PEG related radioactivity was 
shown to be excreted both via urine/kidneys and faeces/liver in mice and rats. For PEG alone, the major 
route of excretion was via the kidneys (62 – 74 %), whereas smaller amounts were excreted via the liver 
(12-13 %). Following administration of nonacog beta pegol, ~42-56 % were excreted in urine and 28-50 
% in faeces.  Low levels of radioactivity were detected at the final time point (12 weeks post dose) in a 
number of tissues/organs following dosing of both [3H-PEG]-nonacog beta pegol and 40 kDa [3H-PEG] to 
rats and [3H-PEG]-nonacog beta pegol to F9-KO mice. The amount of nonacog beta pegol found in the 
carcasses was 5-7 % in rats and 11 % in F9-KO mice.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
No non-clinical drug interaction studies were submitted because no specific pharmacokinetic interactions 
with human coagulation factor IX are known or expected, since nonacog beta pegol is not expected to be 
metabolised by the drug metabolising CYP450 enzymes nor bind to plasma proteins such as albumin or 
alfa-1-acid glycoprotein (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
PK study in mice comparing three phase 3 clinical batches – Study No. xxxx130101 
Only minor differences were observed between the three batches of N9-GP. The manufacturing changes 
from the pivotal to the intended commercial process did not affect F9-KO mouse pharmacokinetics. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology program covered in vitro studies and in vivo toxicity studies in two relevant animal species 
– the Rowett Nude Rat and the Cynomolgus monkey as well as evaluation of local tolerance in the rabbit, 
the rat and Cynomolgus monkey. 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 33/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the rat (Han Wistar), an exploratory immunogenicity study was undertaken for 8 weeks to assess 
anti-drug-antibodies development.  
Furthermore, an exploratory assessment of the systemic toxic potential of 40 kDa PEG alone in Han 
Wistar rats and Cynomolgus monkeys was carried out. 
Species selection 
In vitro Cross-reactivity of nonacog beta pegol and BeneFIX with Cynomolgus monkey, rat, 
rabbit and mouse plasma relative to normal human plasma in a thrombin generation assay – 
Study No. xxxx080802 
Design: 
the effect of human FIX was studied in a TGA in plasma from normal mouse, F9-KO mice, 
rat,  rabbit  and  Cynomolgus  monkey  and  compared  with  the  effect  in  normal  human 
plasma 
Dose: 
0, 22.5, 45, 90, 180, 360 and 450 nM  
Nonacog beta pegol or BeneFIX 
Results: 
•  BeneFIX and nonacog beta pegol have similar effect in a TGA in normal human plasma and in 
plasma  from  Cynomolgus  monkeys  thus  demonstrating  species  cross-reactivity  of  human 
recombinant factor IX (rFIX) to the Cynomolgus monkey coagulation system 
•  BeneFIX and nonacog beta pegol were not activated in rat plasma under a variety of experimental 
conditions  in  the  TGA,  however  pre-activated  human  FIX  (rFIXa)  was  capable  to  elicit  dose 
dependent thrombin generation in rat plasma 
•  BeneFIX (representing rFIX) in plasma from rabbit, normal mouse and F9- KO mouse:  
o  aPTT clotting time was prolonged in F9-KO mouse compared with normal mouse 
o  BeneFIX  was  activated  in  rabbit  and  mouse  plasma  and  preactivated  (rFIXa)  increased 
thrombin generation 
Single dose toxicity 
Nonacog  beta  pegol Single  dose  IV  (Bolus)  Administration  Comparison  Study  in  the  Rat  – 
Study No. 210259 
Five M and five F rats were administered a single IV dose of either 200, 1000 or 2000 IU/kg of nonacog 
beta pegol with a content of 0.03% rFIXa (phase 1 batch) or 0.12% rFIXa (phase 3 batch). The animals 
were sacrificed 24 hours after dosing.

Repeat dose toxicity 
Table 9: Overview of repeat dose Toxicity studies 
Due to the large size of the rFIX molecule and expected formation of neutralizing antibodies in animal 
species, two non-pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies were performed to assess the feasibility, timing and 
dose dependency for development of neutralizing antibodies.

•  CNS  assessment  on  Day  2  and  12:  mild  body  tremors  on  a  single  occasion  in  7/8  high  dose 
animals (3750 IU/kg/week). 
•  Clinical observation on Day 15: tremors in 2 high dose animals previously noted to have tremors 
present on Day 2 during CNS assessment. 
•  A  treatment  related  dose-dependently  and  significantly  increase  in  PT  was  seen,  normalising 
during recovery. Further in vitro experiments by the Sponsor, which is independent of this study, 
indicated  that  the  fluctuations  in  PT  are  considered  to  be  a  result  of  the  high  plasma 
concentrations of 40K PEG-rFIX interfering with the assay. 
•  Anti-drug  antibodies  were  detected  in  the  5  /6  animals  in  the  treatment  free  period.  During 
treatment anti-drug-antibodies may be masked due to interference with drug present in plasma 
sample.  
•  Decrease in aPTT post dose - is an expected pharmacological effect of FIX. From Day 15 and 
onwards a time and dose dependent increase in number of animals with an increase in aPTT prior 
to dosing was seen, indicating development of neutralising cross reacting antibodies. (An increase 
in  aPTT  above  pre-treatment  values  can  be  used  as  a  surrogate  marker  for  development  of 
neutralising anti-drug-antibodies cross reacting to endogenous FIX) 
•  5  high  dose  animals  were  terminated  early  due to  signs  of  bleeding  and  an  increase  in  aPTT, 
indicating development of acquired haemophilia. Signs of acquired haemophilia were seen in 1/8 
intermediate dose (1300 IU/kg) animals and 6/8 high dose (3750 IU/kg) animals.  
•  No microscopic changes were seen in the brain or choroid plexus (study no. 209200).

(two antibody negative animals had either no or a slight decrease in halflife). 
o  AUC0-168 increased proportionally with dose for all animals.

including controls. Treatment related local reaction noted at the terminal sacrifice had reversed in those 
animals examined at the end of the treatment free period.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Nonacog beta pegol is a biological product consisting of a protein (rFIX), coupled to polyethylene glycol 
(40K) via a chemical linker (cytidin-5'-sialic acid-glycyl). 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient, rFIX, and the chemical linker are due to their composition expected 
readily biodegradable. Polyethylene glycol (40K) is not expected to be readily biodegradable, but it is not 
hazard labelled according to EU legislation and it has no known adverse effects on humans or the 
EMA/346525/2017

environment. Polyethylene glycol has for many years been widely used in cosmetics and medicinal 
products. 
The use of nonacog beta pegol for haemophilia treatment is unlikely to result in any risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Several in vitro studies and studies in three in vivo haemophilia B models in the F9-KO mice and the 
haemophilia B dog characterized clear haemostatic efficacy of nonacog beta pegol. The duration of 
haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol was significantly prolonged when compared to BeneFIX. 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated in a 4 week repeated dose toxicity study in 
Cynomolgus monkeys. Mild and transient body tremors were observed in 7 out of 8 high dose treated 
Cynomolgus monkeys (3750 IU/kg/week). Even though different hypotheses were envisaged by the 
applicant (high levels of endotoxin/impurities inside non-clinical batches), the cause of the tremors was 
not clearly identified, and this issue remains thus questionable. Consequently, these findings observed in 
monkeys were included in section 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic attributes of nonacog beta pegol have been characterised for both the protein and the 
PEG part of the molecule. F9-KO mice and haemophilia B dogs displayed an extended half-life and support 
the potential of nonacog beta pegol to provide a prolonged protective haemostatic effect with less 
frequent dosing compared to BeneFIX. 
Systemic exposure increased proportionally to dose. Minor accumulation was seen after repeated dosing 
in Rowett nude rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, consistent with the half-life determined in the respective 
species and the dosing intervals used. In Cynomolgus monkeys, exposure decreased in most animals 
after 4 to 5 repeated doses, which coincided with the development of neutralizing antibodies. Clearance 
was predictive for clearance in humans. 
Nonacog beta pegol distributed widely to highly perfused tissues in mice and rats. The PEG part of the 
molecule was shown to be eliminated from plasma in a bi-phasic manner with a fast first phase (half-life 
2-3 days) and a slower second phase (half-life 15-18 days). Nonacog beta pegol was shown to be 
excreted via urine and faeces. Some PEG related radioactivity was present in the carcass 12 weeks after 
a single high dose but was not confined to any particular organ. The long term consequences and the 
relevance of this finding for the treated patients are unknown. Hence, the following was added in section 
5.3 of the SmPC: “In repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) 
was detected by immunohistochemical staining in epithelial cells of choroid plexus in the brain. This 
finding was not associated with tissue damage or abnormal clinical signs. In distribution and excretion 
studies in mice and rats, the 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) moiety of Refixia was shown to be widely 
distributed to and eliminated from organs, and excreted via plasma in urine (44–56%) and faeces (28–
50%). Based on modelled data using observed terminal half-lives (15–49 days) in rat tissue distribution 
studies, the 40 kDa polyethylene-glycol (PEG) moiety will reach steady state levels in all human tissues 
within 1–2 years of treatment.” 
In conclusion, the pharmacokinetic properties of nonacog beta pegol have been well characterised. With 
regard to the MA, considering a t1/2 of 15-18 days for the PEG moiety, some accumulation by weekly 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 46/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
administration of nonacog beta pegol in clinical prophylactic dose regimen may be expected. The long 
term consequences for the patients are unknown (please see Benefit-Risk discussion). 
Drug interactions caused by the PEG moiety are not expected as PEGylated therapeutics have been widely 
studies and descriptions of drug interactions related to the PEG moiety conjugated to proteins/peptides 
have not been found in the literature. 
Toxicology 
Several non-clinical studies (except studies on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproduction) have been 
performed to characterize toxicological effects of nonacog beta pegol.  
Regarding the GLP aspects, several non-clinical batches used either for the single dose toxicity study in 
rat or for the pivotal repeated dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkey appear non-conform to the end 
of shelf life specifications (EOSL) of the drug substance. It is acknowledged that early non-clinical batches 
do not necessarily fully conform to the commercial EOSL. The concern that high levels of impurities could 
have influenced the non-clinical study was further addressed by the applicant. No data suggesting that 
the outcome of the 4 week monkey study was affected or masked by the levels of endotoxin or impurities 
could be identified. The non-clinical safety studies showed nonacog beta pegol to be well tolerated in rats 
and monkeys at doses up to and including 2000 IU/kg/day and 1300 IU/kg/day, respectively, the highest 
doses tested.  
There is no in vitro or in vivo evidence that nonacog beta pegol has biological properties other than those 
similar to endogenous FIX. For these reasons and in accordance with the ICH S6 guideline, genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity studies and reproductive toxicology studies are not required. Furthermore, no adverse 
effects have been reported on male fertility in clinical data of licensed plasma-derived and recombinant 
FIX products.  
Regarding a possible transplacental passage the applicant submitted a review of available data in the 
SmPC of Cimzia, Pegasys and Macugen. For Cimzia, a publication related a low or negligible transfer to the 
foetal compartment, and limited clinical data show low levels of Cimzia in plasma of an infant born by a 
treated woman. This suggests that, irrespective of the size of the recombinant pegylated molecule, a 
passage across the placental barrier cannot be completely excluded. Consequently, transplacental 
passage of the PEG moiety can not be excluded.  
Non-clinical  studies  are  not  considered  predictive  for  clinical  immunogenicity.  Therefore,  for  these 
aspects, the specifications are justified primarily by clinical data. 
Repeat dose toxicity studies in monkeys and rats revealed PEG present in choroid plexus of the brain (but 
not in other brain structures)whereas PEG alone studies demonstrated in addition vacuolation within 
macrophages in certain tissues in the same animal species. This was explained by accumulation of 40K 
PEG which is not easily broken down appearing histologically as vacuoles. The applicant provided 
bibliographic data from other approved PEGylated products. The most comparable product is Cimzia 
which is approved for the treatment of adults with a comparable PEG moiety for chronic indications such 
as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis. Histological 
examinations also revealed comparable vacuolation as seen in the PEG alone studies with high PEG doses. 
For these indications treatment-free periods may be expected, that means that short recovery periods 
allow PEG elimination and partial reversibility of the histological findings. This is in contrast to the 
intended nonacog beta pegol administration as prophylaxis translates into life-long use without planned 
treatment-free intervals. Regarding the vulnerable population of newborns, infants and children, no 
relevant new data have been provided that could ascertain that the impact of accumulated PEG in the 
choroid plexus is negligible in relation to brain development. Thus, the long term consequences of chronic 
parenteral administration of nonacog beta pegol are still not predictable based on non-clinical data 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 47/154 
 
 
  
 
 
especially with regard to the neuronal development in the paediatric population specifically below 12 
years of age.  
Based on the available data (bibliographic data, preclinical data package) an approval in the paediatric 
population < 12 years of age is not justifiable at the moment. No relevant animal model has been 
identified to study e.g. the effect of vacuolation or accumulation of PEG in epithelial cells in the choroid 
plexus on brain development/ functional changes/potential disruption of the secretion of neurotrophic 
factors in the CSF in the paediatric population. It was also questionable if a relevant animal model could 
be established for review of the application. Furthermore, it was considered doubtful by CHMP if a 
(recently developed) animal model could provide data which are robust enough to be directly 
extrapolated to children <12 years of age. Please see discussion on clinical safety and benefit-risk 
discussion (Please refer to Section 2.6.1. and Section 3.).  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies provided evidence that nonacog beta pegol demonstrated clear 
haemostatic efficacy with prolonged effects. Several studies confirmed the comparability of the 
pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties of nonacog beta pegol to a commercially available FIX 
product (BeneFIX). 
Regarding toxicology, no signs of adverse effects relating to nonacog beta pegol have been observed.  
The possible long term consequences of chronic parenteral administration of nonacog beta pegol are  not 
predictable especially with regards to the neural development in the paediatric population particularly 
below 12 years of age. From the non-clinical point of view, the use of nonacog beta pegol in the paediatric 
population below 12 years of age is not conceivable at this stage. A final assessment of the benefits and 
risks for this population can only be done from a clinical point of view, also taking into account the medical 
need for a new FIX product especially for children. Please see discussion on clinical safety and benefit-risk 
discussion (Please refer to Section 2.6.1. and Section 3.).

Methods 
• 
Analytical methods 
FIX activity 
Plasma FIX activity assays are used during diagnosis and for post-administration and pharmacokinetic 
evaluation. Baseline plasma levels of FIX are measured at the time of diagnosis in order to confirm the 
diagnosis and to determine the degree of haemophilia severity. 
FIX activity and pharmacokinetic properties of three batches of nonacog beta pegol were evaluated (in 
Trial 3747). 
In the clinical trials, FIX activity levels in plasma were measured by: 
o  One-stage  clotting  assay  based  on  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time,  aPTT  (performed  at  a 
central laboratory) using a product-specific standard (PSS) of nonacog beta pegol as calibrator. The 
assay was chosen as primary assay as it is also the FIX potency method described in Ph. Eur. 
o  Chromogenic  assay  based  on  colour  development  by  FXa  cleavage  of  a  chromogenic  substrate 
(performed at Novo Nordisk, Denmark) using normal human plasma (NHP) as calibrator. The assay 
was used for supportive purposes. 
Assay principle: FIX activity assays measure the amount of FIXa generated in response to initiation of 
coagulation or exposure to a specific FIX activator. The activity measured in the FIX activity assays is 
directly related to the FIX plasma concentration.  
The activity of nonacog beta pegol is expressed in international units (IU) in both assays. FIX activity in 
plasma  is  expressed  as  IU/mL  relative  to  the  international  standard  for  FIX  concentrates  for  FIX  in 
plasma. FIX potency was calibrated against the WHO 4th International Standard using a validated one 
stage clotting assay with SynthAFax as aPTT reagent. 
One stage clotting assay 
The one-stage clotting assay measures the FIX activity by time to clot formation. It is based on the ability 
of  a  test  sample  to  correct  the  aPTT-dependent  clotting  time  of  a  plasma  sample  deficient in  FIX  but 
containing all other factors required for normal clotting. As FIX is the limiting factor, the clotting time is 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 50/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
dependent on the FIX concentration in the sample. The assay measures the time from initiation of the 
coagulation process until formation of the fibrin clot. The observed time to fibrin clot formation (turbidity 
measured as optical density) is inversely proportional to FIX activity. 
A vast number of commercial aPTT test reagents are available, and the choice of a certain reagent is 
mainly  based  on  the  technical  laboratory  equipment  used  in  a  particular  laboratory.  It  is  widely 
recognised  that  the  one-stage  clotting  assay 
is  associated  with  considerable  within-  and 
between-laboratory  variability,  owing  to  the  numerous  combinations  of  aPTT  reagents,  instruments, 
calibration  standards  and  factor-deficient  plasmas  available.  The  variability  among  the  aPTT-based 
assays is greater when attempting to measure factor activity levels near the lower limits of the assay 
range. 
The PEG moiety attached to the N-glycan in the activation peptide of nonacog beta pegol interferes with 
several aPTT reagents causing either prolongation or shortening of the clotting times leading to under- or 
overestimation of the FIX activity.  
The interference between the PEG moiety and aPTT reagents was assessed in vitro using haemophilia B 
plasma spiked with nonacog beta pegol. It was shown that the measured activity of nonacog beta pegol 
varied from less than half to approximately 5-fold more than the target activity (concentration) when 
using NHP as calibrator. In contrast non-PEGylated rFIX and BeneFIX both yielded similar activity levels 
within the expected recoveries. The large variability was attributed to the presence of the 40kDa PEG, as 
PEGylated BeneFIX also displayed similar assay variability as nonacog beta pegol.  
Feasibility 
Mechanistic studies were undertaken in order to examine the cause of the very different nonacog beta 
pegol FIX activities observed with different aPTT reagents. The study has two major purposes:  
o  To characterize the recovery of nonacog beta pegol activity against the international standard by use 
of 16 highly used aPTT reagents  
o  To investigate whether calibration with a nonacog beta pegol reference standard would minimize the 
variation to the level observed for other commercial products (BeneFIX and MonoNine) 
The FIX clotting assay was performed with two different standards (nonacog beta pegol and a plasma 
standard – SSC standard).  
In total four products were investigated: N9-GP, N9 (un-pegylated nonacog beta pegol), BeneFIX and 
Mononine (a plasma derived FIX product). 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 51/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On the basis of the measurement of different products in the FIX one-stage clotting assay the following 
conclusions were drawn: 
o  The  observed  variable  assay  performance  of  nonacog  beta  pegol  in  aPTT  assays  is  caused  by 
pegylation of the molecule. 
o  Three of the reagents (SynthAFax, Cephascreen and DAPPTIN) resulted in values for N9- GP within 
target using a plasma standard, confirming that SynthAFax was the correct choice of reagent for assay 
of nonacog beta pegol. At the time the study was done, SynthAFax was already chosen a preferred 
agent. 
o  Four  of  the  chosen  aPTT  reagents  results  for  nonacog  beta  pegol  in  values  below  target  while  the 
majority, 9 reagents resulted in values well above target when using a plasma standard. 
o  Using a nonacog beta pegol calibrator values within target range is obtained for nonacog beta pegol for 
most aPTT reagents, however some concentration dependencies are observed. 
o  Among  the  tested  reagents  the  reagents  containing  ellagic  acid  showed  less  PEG  dependency, 
otherwise no trend in why and what in the aPTT reagents caused the interference was identified. 
o  The samples spiked in the low concentration for all products were giving values well above target. 
o  The % CV for nonacog beta pegol is below 20% for the great majority of the tested aPTT reagents and 
comparable to that of Mononine and BeneFIX. 
o  Mononine and BeneFIX gave results within target with almost all reagents, with the exception of aPTT 
silica resulting in values above target.  
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 52/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
Summary: These studies showed that the FIX activity of nonacog beta pegol was overestimated when 
using silica containing reagents due to adsorption of nonacog beta pegol via the PEG moiety to the surface 
of the silica particles, hereby leading to precocious conversion to FIXa during the contact phase. 
Based on these data, the assay reagent was changed between the phase 1 and phase 3 clinical trials. The 
estimated half-lives and dose linearity were not affected by this change. However, the FIX activity levels 
as measured in the phase 1 trial and the phase 3 trials are therefore not directly comparable. 
Chromogenic assay 
The  chromogenic  assay  is  a  two-stage  activity  assay.  Human  plasma  samples  (test  samples)  are 
incubated with FXIa, FX, FVIII, thrombin, phospholipids and calcium, which activates FIX (present in the 
test sample) to FIXa. FIXa forms an enzymatic complex with thrombin-activated FVIII, phospholipids and 
calcium,  thereby  activating  FX  to  FXa.  Generated  FXa  then  hydrolyses  a  chromogenic  substrate  and 
releases p-nitroanilin, which is quantified by colorimetric detection. Thus, there is a direct relationship 
between the amount of FIXa in the test sample and the generated FXa. 
Two  FIX  chromogenic  assays  (Biophen  (Hyphen  Biomed/Sysmex)  and  Rox  FIX  (Rossix  AB,  Sweden) 
currently approved in the EU have been tested. The activity of nonacog beta pegol, BeneFIX, and the 
plasma-derived FIX product MonoNine spiked into FIX deficient plasma was determined using these two 
FIX  chromogenic  kits.  Similar  results  were  obtained with  both  chromogenic  kits  and  the  different  FIX 
preparations showing that PEGylation did not cause any interference in the chromogenic assay. 
In  order  to  qualify  selected  reagents  for  the  monitoring  of  nonacog  beta  pegol  an  assay  study  was 
conducted using normal human plasma as calibrator. In this study, a one-stage clotting assay with the 
aPTT  reagent  STA-Cephascreen  and  the  two  FIX  chromogenic  assay  kits,  Biophen  (Hyphen 
Biomed/Sysmex) and ROX FIX (Rossix AB, Sweden) were included. Overall, the study concluded that the 
STA-Cephascreen aPTT reagent, the ROX FACTOR IX and the BIOPHEN Factor IX chromogenic assays 
were considered qualified for the measurement of nonacog beta pegol in citrated human plasma. 
In addition, the one-stage clotting assay has been validated with NHP as calibrator. Acceptable correlation 
between  FIX  activities  measured  in  the  one-stage  clotting  assay  using  either  NHP  or  PSS  was 
demonstrated. This assay is used in the ongoing trial of previously untreated patients (Trial 3895). 
FIX concentration in plasma 
Nonacog beta pegol ELISA 
The  plasma  concentration  of  nonacog  beta  pegol  was  measured  using  a  specific  enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  with  target  antibodies  against  PEG  and  against  FIX.  One  antibody  was 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 53/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
directed against an epitope on FIX and the other against an epitope on PEG, which was only present on 
nonacog beta pegol. The ELISA was thus specific for PEGylated nonacog beta molecules. 
The nonacog beta pegol concentrations were reported in ng/mL and included in the phase 1 trial (Trial 
3639). The obtained data were not within the pre-specified acceptance criteria for reproducibility, and the 
data were deemed invalid. 
In the pivotal trial (Trial 3747), the nonacog beta pegol ELISA was used for exploratory purposes. Only 
three samples (one pre-dose and two post-dose) per patient undergoing pharmacokinetic sessions were 
analysed, thus making derivation of pharmacokinetic parameters unfeasible.

All pharmacokinetic endpoints for nonacog beta pegol were derived from pharmacokinetic profiles using 
non-compartmental methods. For all trials, the actual dose was determined by the volume administered. 
Additionally the dose was adjusted for the actual potency of vials (the potency in the certificate of Analysis 
released for each batch); except for Trial 3639 as only one batch (same potency) was used in this trial. All 
pharmacokinetic parameters are presented using summary statistics. 
Dose linearity for nonacog beta pegol was evaluated based on AUC and C30 min at three dose levels (25, 50, 
and 100 IU/kg) in Trial 3639. This was done by applying an analysis of covariance on log-transformed 
parameter values with log dose as a covariate.

Statistical analysis 
The aim of this uncontrolled, open-label trial NN7999-3639 was to evaluate the safety and PK of nonacog 
beta pegol in non-bleeding haemophilia patients without inhibitors. PK properties of the patients’ previous 
FIX product was determined followed by a PK assessment of N9-GP. Data analysis was descriptive rather 
than based on a statistical approach. Thus, no formal power calculation was performed. The SAP was 
based on protocol version 1.0 and amendment version 2.0.   
The safety analysis set, comprising all patients dosed with Refixia, was the primary analysis set of interest 
for both safety endpoints and PK endpoints. In addition, PK analyses were also to be reported for the PK 
analysis set. The PK population consisted of all patients exposed to FIX and Refixia, and where at least one 
PK blood sample had been taken and without significant violations or deviations from the protocol.  
The PK-parameters are calculated using standard non-compartmental methods. Prior to calculation of the 
PK parameters, the baseline level of FIX activity was subtracted from all post-dose values. PK endpoints 
for nonacog beta pegol as well as for previous FIX treatment were modelled by an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) on the log transformed parameter values with dose as a factor. Estimates with 95% confidence 
intervals  are  provided  back-transformed  to  the  original  scale.  Since  there  may  be  differences  in  PK 
parameters between pdFIX and rFIX, analyses were also done separately for the two types of previous FIX 
treatments. The PK endpoints are, in addition, modelled by an ANOVA on the log transformed parameter 
values with dose, type of FIX treatment and dose by type of FIX treatment interaction as factors. Mean 
estimates of PK parameters and 95% confidence intervals from the ANOVA were presented.  
Dose linearity for nonacog beta pegol was evaluated based on AUC and C30 min. This was done by analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) on log transformed parameter values with log dose as a covariate. The slope 
estimate was provided with a 95% confidence interval. 
Assuming  adequate  dose  linearity,  IR,  Vz,  CL  and  t ½  was  also  to  be  compared  between  previous  FIX 
treatment and Refixia. The comparison of the treatments was done by a mixed model with patient as a 
random factor and treatment (Refixia, Previous FIX), type of previous FIX treatment (pdFIX, rFIX) and 
treatment by type of previous FIX treatment interaction as factors. The comparison of the previous FIX 
treatment and Refixia were presented as number of subjects in the analysis, mean estimates with 95% 
confidence intervals, treatment difference as ratio with 95% confidence interval.

Absorption  
Refixia  is  administered  intravenously;  therefore,  there  are  no  relevant  data  to  present  concerning 
absorption. 
Distribution 
The geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss, mL/kg) was   46.5 in Arm 1 prophylaxis 
once-weekly 10 IU/kg and 64.9 mL/kg in Arm 2 prophylaxis once-weekly 40 IU/kg in pivotal trial 3747.  
In  the  paediatric  trial  3774,  the  geometric  mean  volume  of  distribution  Vz  (mL/kg)  after  single-dose 
administration was 76.1 for children 0-6 years of age and 71.5 in children 7-12 years of age. 
Elimination 
Geometric mean terminal t1/2 (h) after single-dose administration was 69.6 for paediatric patients from 
0-6 years, 76.3 and for paediatric patients 7-12 years in trial 3774; 89.4 for adolescents 13-17 years and 
83.0 for adults 18-70 in trial 3747. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose linearity 
Dose linearity for nonacog beta pegol was evaluated based on AUC and C30 min at three dose levels (25, 50 
and 100 IU/kg) in Trial 3639. Based on the results, dose linearity could not be rejected and the slope 
estimates with corresponding confidence intervals indicated dose linearity of nonacog beta pegol within 
the dose range tested (25-100 IU/kg).  
In  Trial  3747  pharmacokinetics  was  assessed  at  10  IU/kg  and  40  IU/kg.  For  both  single-dose  and 
steady-state, all post-dose mean FIX levels for 40 IU/kg were approximately 3−4-fold higher compared 
with 10 IU/kg, supporting dose linearity. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
PK Trial 3639 
This phase I trial was designed to determine the safety and PK properties of ascending single intravenous 
doses of nonacog beta pegol in patients with haemophilia B (factor IX≤2%) at three dose levels 25 IU/kg, 
50  IU/kg  and  100  IU/kg.  In  addition,  the  PK  properties  of  patients’  previous  FIX  treatment 
(plasma-derived FIX [pdFIX] or recombinant FIX [rFIX]) were compared with Nonacog beta pegol at the 
same dose level. 
The trial was conducted at 14 sites in 6 countries (1 site in France, 4 sites in Germany, 3 sites in Japan, 
1 site in Spain, 3 sites in UK, and 2 sites in US). Three cohorts of five patients were administered a single 
dose of 25 IU/kg, 50 IU/kg or 100 IU/kg nonacog beta pegol.  
Sampling time points for previous product: 
Pre-dose, 30min, 1h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 30h and 48h. 
Sampling time points for nonacog beta pegol: 
Pre-dose, 30min, 1h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h, 30h, 48h, 96h, 120h, 144h and 168h.

The  previous  FIX  product  was  pdFIX  in  9  patients  and  rFIX  in  7  patients.  All  patients  had  a 
pharmacokinetic  assessment  with  their  previous  product  (including  both  plasma-derived  and 
recombinant  FIX  products)  followed  by  a  7-day  wash-out  period,  whereafter  the  pharmacokinetics  of 
nonacog beta pegol was assessed.

After one week (168 hours), the mean FIX activity was higher than 0.01 IU/ml (1%) in all dose levels. In 
addition, no single patient had FIX activity levels below 0.01 IU/mL (1%) after 168 hours.  
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 59/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The FIX activity level after 168 hours in the 25 IU/kg dose tier ranged from 5.7%-7.0%; in the 50 IU/kg 
dose tier from 9.6%-22.2% and in the 100 IU/kg dose tier from 28.1% to 44.3%. 
Comparison to patients’ previous product 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  patients’  previous  FIX  product  (pdFIX,  rFIX)  was  compared  to  nonacog  beta 
pegol, see Figure 3–2. The mean terminal half-life of nonacog beta pegol was 93 hours, this was 5-fold 
longer than the patients’ previous FIX products.

Correlation between ELISA and FIX activity 
It should be noted that even though quality control for the nonacog beta pegol antigen ELISA were within 
the acceptance criteria, it was not possible to achieve reproducible results from the trial plasma samples. 
Therefore,  the  individual  nonacog  beta  pegol  antigen  values  cannot  be  considered  valid  for 
pharmacokinetic evaluation. 
aPPT Reagent 
The aPTT reagent used for measurement of plasma FIX activity changed after completion of Trial 3639, 
but the estimated half-lives and dose linearity are not affected by this change. However, the FIX activity 
levels measured in the phase 1 trial and the phase 3 trials are not directly comparable. 
Pivotal Trial 3747 
Trial  3747  was  a  multi-centre,  single-blind  trial  evaluating  safety  and  efficacy, 
including 
pharmacokinetics, of nonacog beta pegol when used for treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding episodes 
in patients with haemophilia B (FIX activity ≤2%). A total of 86 patients were screened for this trial, 74 
patients were enrolled (18 adolescents [13−17 years] and 56 adults [18−65 years]), and 67 patients 
completed the trial. 
PK assessments of nonacog beta pegol were performed at Visit 2 (single-dose) and between Visits 5−9 
(steady state). Patients who continued from the Phase 1 trial (NN7999-3639) into the present trial were 
allowed  to  omit  the  single-dose  PK  assessments  and  only  had  to  perform  the  steady-state  PK 
assessments. Three different lots of nonacog beta pegol were used for PK assessments in order to comply 
with EU regulations.  There was a wash-out period of 5 days before the first dose of nonacog beta pegol. 
Steady-state pharmacokinetics was assessed after at least 3 months of prophylactic treatment and 7 days 
after last injection of nonacog beta pegol.  
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 61/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIX activity was measured using two different assays, the one-stage clotting assay and the chromogenic 
assay. The primary evaluation was based on the one-stage clotting assay. The chromogenic assay was an 
exploratory  assay.  FIX  concentration  was  measured  with  a  nonacog  beta  pegol  antigen  ELISA.  Blood 
samples for analysis of FIX activity were collected pre-dose, 30 minutes post-dose and at 24, 48, 96 and 
168 h post dose. 
Pharmacokinetic endpoints 
The PK endpoints were incremental recovery, FIX trough level, AUC, terminal half-life and clearance, and 
are presented for single-dose and steady-state in Table 3-1. As expected for steady-state, AUC and FIX 
trough  levels  were  3−4  fold  higher  in  the  40  IU/kg  arm  compared  with  the  10  IU/kg  arm,  while  no 
differences were observed for incremental recovery. The t ½ for single-dose was 93 hours in the 10 IU/kg 
arm and 85 hours in the 40 IU/kg arm, while at steady-state t ½ was 107 hours in the 10 IU/kg arm and 
111  hours  in  the  40  IU/kg  arm.  Clearance  was  however  similar  between  groups,  and  indicates  no 
differences in elimination between the 10 IU/kg and 40 IU/kg groups. 
Mean  residence  time  (MRT),  volume  of  distribution  (Vz)  and  (Vss),  AUC(0-t),  AUC(0-168)  and 
accumulation ratio were added post-hoc as additional PK parameters. MRT increased from single-dose to 
steady-state in both the 10 IU/kg and the 40 IU/kg arm. For single-dose, Vz was similar between groups. 
For steady-state, Vss was lower and the accumulation ratio was higher in the 10 IU/kg arm compared with 
the 40 IU/kg arm. However, the accumulation ratio for 10 IU/kg was based on data from 3 patients only 
and conclusions should be made cautiously.

A subgroup of 17 patients was enrolled for PK assessments, and 16 patients were dosed. Thus 16 patients 
(7 with 10 IU/kg and 9 with 40 IU/kg) had steady state pharmacokinetics assessed in Trial 3747. Patients 
who  participated  in  Trial  3639  prior  to  entering  Trial  3747  were  allowed  to  skip  single-dose 
pharmacokinetic assessments. A total of 7 patients randomised to the 10 IU/kg arm in Trial 3747 had 
pharmacokinetic assessments at steady state, 3 of these 7 patients participated in Trial 3639, hence were

allowed  skipping  the  single-dose  pharmacokinetic  session.  The  remaining  4  patients  performed  both 
single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetic assessment in Trial 3747.

Comparison of the one-stage clotting assay and the chromogenic assay 
The  results  obtained  with  the  one-stage  clotting  assay  using  a  PSS  (product-specific  standard)  as 
calibrator and the chromogenic assay using NHP (normal human plasma) as calibrator were compared 
both in the pivotal trial (Trial 3747) and the paediatric trial (Trial 3774) and a high correlation between the 
results obtained with the two assays was seen with no systematic differences. 
Mean  PK  profiles  of  FIX  activity  with  the  one-stage  clotting  assay  and  the  chromogenic  assay  shown 
together  are  found  in  EOT  Figures  14.2.103  and  14.2.105.  A  Bland-Altman  plot  of  the  ratio  between 
individual  sample  results  with  the  one-stage  clotting  and  the  chromogenic  assay  plotted  against  the

geometric  mean  of  the  two  results  is  presented  in  EOT  Figure  14.2.90.  The  plot  indicates  an 
approximately 1:1 ratio between the two assays.

Trough levels and Accumulation of nonacog beta pegol 
Due  to  the  long  half-life  of  nonacog  beta  pegol  some  accumulation  of  FIX  activity  was  observed  and 
pre-dose FIX activity was higher at steady-state compared to single dose, and as a consequence, FIX

activity for the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile was proportionally higher at all time-points than for 
the single-dose pharmacokinetic profile. The observed accumulation ratio, was estimated to 1.43 for the 
40 IU/kg arm, which corresponds well to the accumulation ratio estimated based on single-dose data. 
Single-dose pharmacokinetics in the 40 IU/kg arm showed that the mean FIX activity 168 hours post 
dosing  (which  corresponds  to  pre-dosing  to  next  dose,  i.e.  trough  level)  was  0.16  IU/mL  (range: 
0.10-0.25 IU/mL). The mean incremental recovery was 0.022 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg), mean clearance was 0.4 
mL/h/kg  and  mean  terminal  half-life  was  ~85  hours  (confirming  the  finding  from  Trial  3639,  where 
terminal half-life was found to be 93 hours).

Steady-state pharmacokinetics in the 40 IU/kg arm showed that the mean FIX activity 168 hours post 
dosing was 0.31 IU/mL (range: 0.25-0.43 IU/mL). The mean incremental recovery and clearance was 
similar to single-dose, and terminal half-life was found to be ~111 hours.

Study 3774 
This  was  a  multicentre,  multinational,  open-label,  non-controlled,  single-arm,  confirmatory  trial 
evaluating safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of nonacog beta pegol in prophylaxis and treatment of 
bleeding episodes in children with haemophilia B. The trial was divided into a main phase of 52 weeks, 
followed by an optional extension phase. 
A total of 28 patients were screened for this trial and 25 patients were enrolled, of which 12 patients were 
in the age group of 0–6 years and 13 patients were in the 7–12 years age group. 
At visit 2, the patients underwent a PK session. The wash-out period was at least 4 days before the first 
dose of nonacog beta pegol. Blood samples for analysis were collected predosing and at 30 ± 10 min, 24h 
± 8h, 48h ± 8h, 96h ± 8h and 168h ± 24h after dosing with 40 IU/kg of nonacog beta pegol. The sampling 
time  was  relative  to  completion  of  nonacog  beta  pegol  administration,  and  the  actual  time  was 
documented. 
The PK endpoints were assessed with the one-stage clotting assay. 
Mean FIX activity versus time profiles of the two age groups after a single dose of nonacog beta pegol 
(Visit 2) are presented in Figure 11–1. The FIX activity levels declined exponentially over time and were 
slightly lower in the younger age group (0-6 years) as compared to the older age group (7-12 years) 
throughout the PK session. 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 71/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
After the single dose of nonacog beta pegol, the FIX activity 30 min after administration was 0.543 IU/mL 
in the 0–6 years age group and 0.596 IU/mL in the 7–12 years age group. The incremental recovery was 
0.015 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) and 0.016 (IU/mL)/(IU/kg) in the 0–6 years age group and 7–12 years age group 
respectively.  
Single dose FIX trough activity levels were measured 168 h post-dose at Visit 2, and were 0.084 IU/mL in 
the 0–6 years age group and 0.109 IU/mL in the 7–12 years age group (Table 11–12). The clearance was 
0.758 mL/h/kg in the 0–6 years age group and 0.650 mL/h/kg in the 7–12 years age group. The terminal 
half-life for the entire patient population was 73.0 h, 69.6 h in the 0–6 years age group and 76.3 h in the 
7–12 years age group. The AUC was 37.5 (IU*h/mL) in the 0–6 years age group and 43.6 (IU*h/mL) in 
the 7–12 years age group. The mean residence time was 95.4 h for the 0–6 years age group and 105.1 
for the 7–12 years age group and the volume of distribution (Vz) was 76.1 (mL/kg) and 71.5 (mL/kg) for 
the age groups respectively (Table 11–12).

All individual FIX trough activity levels after treatment with nonacog beta pegol were within the range of 
0.05-0.40 IU/mL, which defines mild haemophilia, and the estimated mean steady state FIX trough levels 
were 0.154 IU/mL for the 0–6 years age group and 0.190 IU/mL for the 7–12 years age group (Table 11–
13).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The FIX activity used for the pharmacokinetic assessment is known to correlate with clinical efficacy of FIX 
products. Thus, the FIX activity is to be considered pharmacodynamic in nature, as it reflects the biologic 
action of nonacog beta pegol. Hence, no other pharmacodynamic endpoints have been assessed. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant has explored the single dose PK parameters of Refixia at three different dose levels (25, 50 
and 100 IU/kg) in 15 PTPs  (age between 18 and 65 years, both inclusive) in trial 3639 (5 per dose level) 
in comparison to the patients’ previous product at corresponding dose levels. Phase 1 pharmacokinetic 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 79/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
data was used to select two nonacog beta pegol dose regimens (10 and 40 IU/kg once weekly) for the 
phase 3 trial (Trial 3747) in adolescent and adult patients. Once weekly administration of the dose 
regimens were predicted to achieve FIX activity levels consistently above the standard of treatment with 
other FIX products. 10 IU/kg nonacog beta pegol once weekly was selected to investigate the effect of FIX 
trough levels above 1-3% as suggested in the literature for non-modified FIX products, while 40 IU/kg 
nonacog beta pegol once weekly was selected to investigate the effect of maintaining FIX activity levels 
expected to be within the range of mild haemophilia patients. 
In the pivotal trial 3747, 16 patients >12 years (7 with 10 IU/kg and 9 with 40 IU/kg) had steady state 
pharmacokinetics assessed. However, only 4 of the 7 patients in the 10 IU/kg arm provided directly 
comparable single-dose and steady-state data in trial 3747, because patients rolled over from trial 3639 
did not repeat single dose PK assessment. 
Three different lots were employed for PK assessment in the pivotal trial 3747 and PK data appeared 
comparable for the tested lots. PK data according to bodyweight subgroups [normal weight (BMI 
18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2)] were provided for trial 
3747 and no relevant differences could be identified.   
In addition, single-dose pharmacokinetics of nonacog beta pegol was investigated in 25 paediatric 
patients (12 from 0-6; 13 from 7-12 years) in Trial 3774. Historical recovery from the medical records of 
the patients’ previous product was available for comparison. 
The chosen pharmacokinetic parameters as well as the non-compartmental analysis are considered 
relevant and acceptable. To provide data both with the one stage clotting assay as well as the 
chromogenic assay is endorsed and the observed comparability of these data may facilitate treatment 
decisions for the haemophilia centres. 
In conclusion, the PK exercise undertaken during the clinical development programme of nonacog beta 
pegol fulfils or exceeds most of the guideline requirements.  
However, the submitted PK results do not fully support the high prophylactic dose of 40 IU/kg once 
weekly as the only worthwhile dose. Unusually high trough levels as well as distinct accumulation were 
observed for the 40 IU/kg once weekly dose at steady state. Accumulation was even higher in the 10 
IU/kg, but as this is based on data from only 3 patients, no meaningful interpretation is possible. The 
applicant was asked to further justify the chosen dosing regimen, i.e. 40 IU/kg once weekly, also with 
regard to the paediatric population, and to explain why the lower dosing regimen, i.e. 10 IU/kg once 
weekly, which produces trough levels adequate to convert severe to mild haemophilia, is not considered 
suitable. The argumentation provided by the applicant that conventional factor IX products are not able to 
achieve such high trough levels and that it would therefore be appropriate to target these levels with a 
modified factor is not considered convincing. Intending to achieve trough levels between 5 and 15 % is a 
novel, not commonly adopted practice with the objective to avoid bleeding events by aiming to keep the 
available factor IX levels at or above those seen in mild haemophilia at all times. To target even higher 
trough levels is not justified by current clinical practice and could lead to very high peak levels, which is 
especially relevant in patients with known cardiovascular risk factors.  
To provide patients and treating physicians with a choice between a lower dose that results in trough 
levels already higher than in common practice and the very high levels targeted by the 40 IU/kg dose is 
clearly preferred. Thus, the following recommendation was added in section 4.2 of the SmPC with regards 
to prophylaxis posology: 
“Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FIX levels and 
individual bleeding tendency.” 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 80/154 
 
 
  
 
 
The justification of the applicant for not conducting investigations on PD was acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK exercise is conform to guideline requirements with regard to number and age distribution of 
included patients, explored PK parameters, lots investigated, comparison to patients’ previous product 
and availability of PK data at initial exposure as well as after continuous treatment for at least 3 months. 
However, the PK results do not seem to fully support a prophylactic dose regimen of 40 IU/kg once weekly 
as the only possible or worthwhile prophylactic treatment regimen. 
Hence, the following recommendation was added in section 4.2 of the SmPC with regards to prophylaxis 
posology: 
“Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FIX levels and 
individual bleeding tendency.”

Treatments 
Patients enrolled in a prophylaxis arm received either 10 IU/kg or 40 IU/kg nonacog beta pegol doses 
once weekly (every 7th day ± 24 hours), depending on which prophylaxis arm they were randomised to. 
These doses were based on results from the Phase 1 trial NN7999-3639. 
Applying  to  all  patients  in  the  trial,  the  dose  levels  of  nonacog  beta  pegol  for  treatment  of  a  mild  or 
moderate bleeding episode was a single dose of 40 IU/kg. A severe bleeding episode was to be treated 
immediately at home or at a local emergency room with 80 IU/kg and the haemophilia centre was to be 
contacted immediately thereafter for further instructions or transport. 
If a dose for treatment of bleeding was taken, the next prophylactic dose was to be taken on the planned 
day. If a bleeding episode occurred on the same day as the planned prophylaxis, the dose was to be 
registered for the bleeding episode and not as prophylaxis. 
The following investigational medicinal product was used in the trial: 
Nonacog beta pegol was presented as freeze-dried powder in single-use vials with a nominal content of 
500  IU/vial  or  2000  IU/vial  (see  Table  9–1).  Both  strengths  were  to  be  reconstituted  with  4.2  mL  of 
histidine solvent for i.v. injection. Histidine solvent (4.2 mL/vial) was provided together with nonacog 
beta pegol.

Secondary confirmatory efficacy endpoints (hierarchical hypothesis testing with protection against false 
significances) 
•  Haemostatic  effect  of  nonacog  beta  pegol  when  used  for  treatment  of  bleeding  episodes,

Additional supportive efficacy endpoints (see PK section) 
• 
FIX trough levels  
•  Number of bleeding episodes per patient during routine prophylaxis by type of bleed 
• 
The number of injections of nonacog beta pegol required per bleeding episode 
•  Amount of nonacog beta pegol required per bleeding episode (U/kg BW/bleeding episode) 
Patient reported outcomes and health economic endpoints 
PRO data were collected to assess change in health related, disease and age-specific quality of life and 
treatment satisfaction from the screening visit (Visit 1) to Visit 7 (end-of-trial visit) for patients in the 
on-demand arm; and from the screening visit (Visit 1) to Visit 10 (end-of-trial visit) for patients in the 
prophylaxis arms. 
The severity of bleeding episodes was defined as: 
•  Mild/moderate: Bleeding episodes that were uncomplicated joint bleeds, muscular bleeds without 
compartment  syndrome,  mucosal-  or  subcutaneous  bleeds.  These  bleeding  episodes  could  be 
treated at home and details of the bleeding episodes were entered in the electronic diary by the 
patient. 
•  Severe: All intracranial, retroperitoneal, iliopsoas and neck bleeds were categorised as severe. 
Muscle bleeds with compartment syndrome and bleeds associated with a significant decrease in 
the haemoglobin level (>3g/dl) were also to be reported as severe. These bleeding episodes had 
to  be  treated  immediately  or  at  the  local  emergency  room,  and  the  trial  personnel  had  to  be 
contacted.  The  details  of  severe  bleeding  episodes  had  to  be  entered  in  the  eCRF  by  the 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 85/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
investigator or trial personnel. Traumatic bleedings at other locations than described above could 
always be considered severe at the discretion of the investigator. 
Haemostatic response 
The assessment of haemostatic response was made by the patient or LAR. If there was no observed effect 
of 40 IU/kg, the investigator should be contacted prior to administration of the second dose of 40 IU/kg. 
If the investigator reclassified a mild/moderate bleeding episode to a severe bleeding episode, treatment 
with a double dose of 40 IU/kg was considered as a single injection of 80 IU/kg. 
The four-point scale was defined as below and took into account the improvement in signs of bleeding, 
mainly by pain relief, but also took swelling and motion into account. The evaluation using the four-point 
scale  was  to  reflect  the  haemostatic  response  from  the  time of  treatment  and  until  8  hours  after  the 
treatment had been administered. 
• 
Excellent – abrupt pain relief and/or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding within 8 
hours after a single injection 
•  Good – noticeable pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single 
injection 
•  Moderate – probable or slight beneficial effect within the first 8 hours after the first injection but 
requiring more than one injection within 8 hours 
• 
Poor – no improvement, or worsening of symptoms within 8 hours after two injections 
Classification of a re-bleed was performed at the time of the statistical analysis, according to the following 
criteria: A re-bleed was defined as a worsening of symptoms in the same location after an initial period of 
improvement,  either  on  treatment  or  within  72  hours  after  stopping  treatment.  If  a  bleeding  episode 
occurred in the same location later than 72 hours after stopping the treatment it is considered a new 
bleeding episode. 
Randomisation 
The decision to enrol into either the on-demand arm or one of the two prophylactic arms was made by the 
patient and the investigator. 
For patients enrolled into one of the two prophylaxis arms: At Visit 2, eligible patients were randomised in 
a  1:1  manner  to  one  of  the  two  prophylaxis  arms,  using  the  telephone  or  web-based  randomisation 
system IV/WRS. 
Blinding (masking) 
This trial was a single-blinded trial, meaning that patients on prophylaxis did not know whether they were 
randomised to 10 IU/kg or 40 IU/kg. This information was also concealed from the investigator; however, 
as the investigator had the possibility to measure FIX activity levels during the trial, the investigator could 
potentially be unblinded during the trial. If so, it was not allowed for the investigator to disclose neither 
the FIX activity level nor the trial product dose level to the patient. 
The blinding was not broken for any patients during the trial.

Statistical methods 
Statistical Study Conduct 
This  Statistical  Analysis  Plan  (SAP)  was  based  on  Final  Protocol  version  2.0  (17-Nov-2010)  including 
Substantial Amendment no 2 (02-Feb-2011), Substantial Amendment no 3 (01-Apr-2011), Substantial 
Amendment  no  6  (13-May-2011),  Global  Substantial  Amendment  no  8  (24-Nov-2011),  and  Global 
Substantial Amendment no 9 (19-Mar-2012). 
The  scope  of  the  SAP  was  to  further  specify  how  the  dose  recommendation  was  to  be  determined. 
Furthermore,  some  additional  sensitivity  analyses  had  been  added  and  some  details  of  the  analyses 
clarified. 
Analysis Sets 
The  following  analysis  sets  were  defined  in  the  protocol,  prior  to  any  unblinding  of  the  treatment 
randomisation, and in accordance with ICH E9. 
•  Safety analysis set – all dosed patients 
• 
Full analysis set (FAS) – all dosed patients 
The full analysis set and the safety analysis set both consisted of all patients exposed to nonacog beta 
pegol.  Although  the  two  analysis  sets  were  identical,  safety  analyses  were  performed  on  the  safety 
analysis set, whereas efficacy and PK analyses were performed on the full analysis set. All analyses were 
based  on  all  available  information  until  the  last  visit.  If  not  otherwise  specified,  withdrawn  patients 
contributed with data until the date of withdrawal. 
Testing Strategy and Statistical Analysis Methods 
The confirmatory tests were to be tested hierarchically. 
Primary Endpoint Incidence of Inhibitory Antibodies against FIX: The rate of neutralising antibodies was 
to  be  reported  and  a  1-sided  97.5%  upper  confidence  limit  was  to  be  provided  based  on  an  exact 
calculation  for  a  binomial  distribution.  For  the  calculation  of  the  inhibitor  rate  the  numerator  was  to 
include all patients with neutralising antibodies while the denominator was to include all patients with a 
minimum of 10 exposure days plus any patients with less than 10 exposure days but with neutralising 
inhibitors. Adequate safety with regard to neutralising inhibitors was to be concluded if the observed rate 
was lower than or equal to 2% and the upper 1-sided 97.5% confidence limit was below or equal to 10.7% 
corresponding to the upper 97.5% confidence limit if just 1 inhibitor out of 50 patients was observed. In 
terms of actual observed number of neutralising antibodies the consequence of this was that 1 or less 
neutralising  antibody  out  of  50  patients  was  considered  acceptable  whereas  2  or  more  neutralising 
antibodies  was  considered  unacceptable.  Any  patient  from  the  on-demand  group  that  should  develop 
neutralising antibodies was to be counted in the numerator. Patients from the on-demand arm were only 
to be included in the denominator if they had neutralising antibodies or if they had more than 10 exposure 
days. 
Confirmatory Secondary Endpoint Haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol when used for treatment of 
bleeding  episodes:  In  order  to  protect  against  false  significances  this  endpoint  was  to  be  tested  as  a 
confirmatory secondary endpoint if and only if the analysis of the primary endpoint was successful. 
The  efficacy  endpoint  of  response  to  treatment  of  acute  bleeding  episodes  was  to  be  analysed  by 
dichotomizing into success/failure based on counting excellent and good as success and moderate and 
poor as failure. A success rate of 80% was considered the goal. Due to variation it was not certain that 
nonacog beta pegol would achieve an observed 80% success rate in this trial even if the true success rate 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 87/154 
 
 
  
 
 
is 80%. For that reason a non-inferiority approach was be used where it was to be demonstrated that the 
success rate for nonacog beta pegol is at most 15% (absolute) worse than 80%. 
Specifically this was to be analysed using logistic regression. The analysis was to be performed by use of 
Proc Genmod in SAS. A repeated statement was to be applied in order to take correlation within subjects 
into  account.  Non-inferiority  (to  80%)  was  to  be  concluded  if  the  lower  95%  confidence  limit  for  the 
success rate was above 65%. 
Two sensitivity analyses were to be carried out. The first was an analysis where any bleeding episode with 
missing response was to be counted as a failure. Secondly, dichotomizing into success/failure (regardless 
of the response reported on the four-point scale) based on the number of additional doses administered 
within 8 hours after the first dose to treat the bleeding episode. 
Confirmatory  Secondary  Endpoint  Number  of  bleeding  episodes  per  patient  during  routine 
prophylaxis: The next in order of the confirmatory secondary endpoints for clinical efficacy was number of 
bleeding episodes (spontaneous and traumatic) during routine prophylaxis. In order to protect against 
false  significances  this  endpoint  was  only  be  analysed  as  a  confirmatory  secondary  endpoint  if  the 
analysis of the primary endpoint and the first confirmatory secondary endpoint were successful.  
The  endpoint  was  to  be  analysed  by  a  Poisson  regression  model  with  dose  as  a  factor  allowing  for 
over-dispersion and using treatment duration as an offset. Estimates of the annualised bleeding rates for 
each dose were to be provided with 95% confidence intervals. 
The first test aimed to establish that the higher dose leads to a bleeding frequency below 4.8 bleeding 
episodes per year by evaluating whether the upper confidence limit for the annualised bleeding rate was 
below 4.8. 12 bleeding episodes per year were considered a conservative estimate for the annual bleeding 
rates  for  haemophilia  B  patients  treated  on  demand.  By  applying  this,  the  proposed  test  strategy 
corresponded to demonstrating an upper confidence limit for the reduction of at least 60%. Only if the 
higher  dose  demonstrated  to  have  a  bleeding  rate  <  4.8  bleeding  episodes  per  year,  a  similar 
confirmatory test was to be performed for the lower dose. The test aimed to establish that the lower dose 
leads  to  a  bleeding  frequency  below  4.8  bleeding  episodes per  year  by  evaluating  whether  the  upper 
confidence limit for the annualised bleeding rate was below 4.8.  
In addition the lower dose was to be compared statistically to the higher dose by a test with the null 
hypothesis  to  be  investigated  being  no  difference  between  doses.  Based  on  the  above  analyses,  the 
dosing recommendation was to be determined as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
If 10 IU/kg gives adequate prophylactic protection and 40 IU/kg was not clearly better than 10 
IU/kg, then the dosing recommendation should be 10 IU/kg. 
If 10 IU/kg gives adequate prophylactic protection, but 40 IU/kg was clearly better than 10 IU/kg, 
then the recommended dose should be 40 IU/kg. 
If 10 U/kg does not give adequate protection but 40 IU/kg does, then the dosing recommendation 
should be 40 IU/kg. 
Since it could be expected that some patients would withdraw prior to 52 weeks of treatment it became 
essential  to  account  for  how  such  withdrawals  may  affect  the  analyses  of  the  prophylaxis  effect.  The 
analyses above already account for possible different treatment durations by using treatment duration as 
an offset. This was a proper adjustment if withdrawal is not related to the observed bleeding frequency. 
However, since it was possible that patients would withdraw exactly because of the observed bleeding 
rate it is important to perform sensitivity analyses that may account for withdrawn patients possibly being 
qualitatively different from completing patients. Specifically this was to be done by performing sensitivity 
analyses  for  all  prophylaxis  analyses  using  a  last  observation  carried  forward  (LOCF)  approach  for  all 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 88/154 
 
 
  
 
 
patients with at least 1 month prophylaxis treatment duration by calculating the yearly bleeding episode 
rate  for  withdrawn  patients  and  use  that  as  endpoint.  For  patients  withdrawing  within  1  month  this 
method was considered to give too uncertain LOCF values, hence imputation was not attempted for such 
patients. 
An  additional  conservative  sensitivity  analysis  was  to  be  performed  where  the  number  of  bleeding 
episodes was to be imputed for withdrawals based on LOCF approach as described above if the patient has 
had at least one bleed. For patients withdrawing after one month with 0 bleeds, imputation for the missing 
period was to be done based on an Annualized Bleeding Rate of 12 (12 being the estimated bleeding rate 
for haemophilia B patients on on-demand treatment). Patients withdrawing within one month were to 
contribute to the analysis with their observed number of bleeds and the treatment duration as above.

Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations at trial level: 
One  important  protocol  deviation  was  reported  after  database  lock  at  trial  level.  With  substantial 
amendment no. 8 it was specified that anti-murine IgG antibodies were only to be analysed if a patient 
developed  a  severe  allergic  reaction  related  to  nonacog  beta  pegol.  By  mistake,  Section  8.6.6  of  the 
protocol was not adjusted accordingly 
Deviations on trial site level: 
In all, 29 important deviations were reported at trial site level. These were related to the informed consent 
procedure,  ethics  committees/institutional  review  board  procedures,  monitoring  intervals  outside  the 
intervals  described  in  the  protocol,  treatment  compliance,  drug  handling  procedures,  assessment 
deviations and laboratory procedures.

Numbers analysed 
The safety analysis set and the full analysis set were identical and consisted of all dosed patients. Thus, 
a total of 74 patients were included in these analysis sets. No patients were excluded from any analyses. 
Outcomes and estimation 
A total of 345 bleeds were treated in 55 patients (74.3%) during the trial. The majority of the bleeds 
(65.8%) were spontaneous, 33.6% were traumatic bleeds and 0.6% were due to minor surgery or other 
reasons (Table 11–1). The most frequent location of bleeds was in a joint, which accounted for 78.5% of 
the 331 bleeds with reported information on location. The bleeds were classified as mild/moderate in 
99.7% of the cases, and only 1 bleed (0.3%) was classified as severe (a joint bleed which occurred in the 
10 IU/kg arm). The mean duration of bleeds for the 307 bleeds with reported information on duration was 
33.4 hours. 5 (1.4%) of the total 345 bleeds had re-bleeds, and the most frequently reported start time 
of a bleed was in the morning from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.

Details of bleeds in target joints
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 94/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
A total of 3 patients (one in each treatment arm) without target joints at baseline had 3 or more bleeds 
in the same joint during the trial; one patient (10 IU/kg arm) had 5 spontaneous bleeds in left ankle (joint 
with severe haemophilic arthropathy at baseline); one patient (40 IU/kg arm) had 2 traumatic and 1 
spontaneous bleeds in left ankle (joint with previous bleeds prior to trial); one patient (on-demand arm) 
had 3 spontaneous bleeds in right ankle. 
Haemostatic effect of treatment of bleeds 
The haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol was confirmed statistically with an overall success rate for 
treatment of bleeds of 92.2% (95% CI: 86.9; 95.4) as the lower 95% confidence limit was above 65%. 
Number of bleeding episodes per patient during routine prophylaxis 
A  prophylactic  protection  of  40  IU/kg  was  demonstrated  from  the  statistical  analysis  as  the  upper 
confidence limit for the annualised bleeding rate was below 4.8 (see Table 11–5). Efficacy of 10 IU/kg was 
not demonstrated from the statistical analysis as the upper confidence limit for the annualised bleeding 
rate was not below 4.8 (see Table 14.2.38). 
The annualised bleeding rate for the 40 IU/kg arm was estimated to be 45% lower than the bleeding rate 
for the 10 IU/kg arm, but no statistical significant difference between the two prophylaxis arms was found 
in this supportive statistical analysis (see Table 14.2.38). A sensitivity analysis where withdrawals with at 
least 1 month of prophylaxis treatment (2 patients in the 40 IU/kg arm and 2 patients in the 10 IU/kg 
arm) were included using a last observation carried forward approach confirmed the results of the original 
analysis. Another sensitivity analysis where withdrawals without any bleeds in the trial were assigned an 
annual bleeding rate of 12 also confirmed the result of the original analysis.

Number of bleeding episodes per patient during routine prophylaxis by subgroup of bleed 
Generally,  the  estimated  annualised  bleeding  rates  for  the  40  IU/kg  arm  were  below  or  equal  to  the 
bleeding rates for the 10 IU/kg arm. For spontaneous bleeds, the bleeding rate was lower in the 40 IU/kg 
arm compared with the 10 IU/kg arm. For traumatic bleeds, the bleeding rates were similar in the two 
prophylaxis arms (Table 11–7).

Paediatric trial 3774 
This  was  a  multicentre,  multinational,  open-label,  non-controlled,  single-arm,  confirmatory  trial 
evaluating safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of nonacog beta pegol in prophylaxis and on demand 
treatment of bleeding episodes (hereafter referred to as “treatment of bleeding episodes”) in children 
with haemophilia B. The trial was divided into a main phase, core study, of 52 weeks, followed by an 
optional extension phase. 
A clinical study report for the core phase was included in the dossier, whereas only preliminary safety data 
from the extension phase was included.

Treatments 
All patients received 40 IU/kg nonacog beta pegol i.v. once weekly for prophylaxis. 
Bleeding  episodes  were  treated  as  soon  as  they  were  identified.  The  dose  for  treatment  of  an 
uncomplicated mild/moderate bleeding episode, e.g. a joint bleed, was a single dose of nonacog beta 
pegol 40 IU/kg i.v.. Severe bleeding episodes were treated immediately with 80 IU/kg. 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 102/154 
 
 
  
 
 
For minor surgeries and placement of central venous access ports an additional dose of nonacog beta 
pegol 40 IU/kg was administered, or aligned to local practice after confirmation from sponsor’s medical 
expert  (see  Attachment  I  in  the  protocol).  The  dose  level  was  based  on  the  World  Federation  of 
Hemophilia (WFH) guideline. 
Patients in need of major  surgery were withdrawn from the core trial. However, as described in the 
protocol, if nonacog beta pegol was proven safe in the separate surgery trial (NN7999-3773) performed 
in adults and adolescents, patients in the extension phase would be offered treatment with nonacog beta 
pegol during major surgery. As of the cut-off date for this report major surgery was not allowed in the 
present trial. The protocol was later amended to include major surgeries in the extension part of the trial 
The following investigational medicinal products were: 
•  Nonacog beta pegol product (500 IU and 2000 IU vials) 
•  Histidine solvent 4.2 mL 
•

Patient reported outcomes and health economic endpoints 
•  Changes in health related quality of life (HRQOL) from Visit 1 to Visit 11 (end of main phase/core 
study)  and  to  end  of  trial  visit  (EOT)  (to  be  reported  with  data  from  extension  phase),  were 
assessed  using  age  and  disease  specific  PRO  questionnaires:  Haemophilia-quality  of  life 
(HAEMO-QOL), Haemophilia treatment satisfaction (HEMO-SAT), and TNO-AZL preschool quality 
of life (TAPQOL). 
•  Health  economic  impact  of  nonacog  beta  pegol  treatment  through  characterisation  of 
hospitalisations,  emergency  room  visits,  missed  work  and/or  school  days,  and  mobility  aid 
requirements in connection with bleeds. 
The severity of bleeding episodes was defined as: 
•  Mild/Moderate: Bleeding episodes that were uncomplicated joint bleeds, muscular bleeds without 
compartment syndrome, mucosal- or subcutaneous bleeds. 
•  Severe: All intracranial, retroperitoneal, iliopsoas and neck bleeds were categorised as severe. 
Muscle bleeds with compartment syndrome and bleeds associated with a significant decrease in 
the haemoglobin level (>3g/dL) were also reported as severe. These bleeding episodes were to 
be treated immediately at home or at the local emergency room and the trial personnel were to 
be contacted. 
Haemostatic response 
The assessment of haemostatic response was made by the patient or LAR. If there was no observed effect 
of 40 IU/kg, the investigator should be contacted prior to administration of the second dose of 40 IU/kg. 
If the investigator reclassified a mild/moderate bleeding episode to a severe bleeding episode, treatment 
with a double dose of 40 IU/kg was considered as a single injection of 80 IU/kg. 
The four-point scale was defined as below and took into account the improvement in signs of bleeding, 
mainly by pain relief, but also took swelling and motion into account. The evaluation using the four-point 
scale  was  to  reflect  the  haemostatic  response  from  the  time of  treatment  and  until  8  hours  after  the 
treatment had been administered. 
• 
Excellent – abrupt pain relief and/or clear improvement in objective signs of bleeding within 8 
hours after a single injection 
•  Good – noticeable pain relief and/or improvement in signs of bleeding within 8 hours after a single 
injection 
•  Moderate – probable or slight beneficial effect within the first 8 hours after the first injection but 
requiring more than one injection within 8 hours 
• 
Poor – no improvement, or worsening of symptoms within 8 hours after two injections 
Classification of a re-bleed was performed at the time of the statistical analysis, according to the following 
criteria: A re-bleed was defined as a worsening of symptoms in the same location after an initial period of 
improvement,  either  on  treatment  or  within  72  hours  after  stopping  treatment.  If  a  bleeding  episode 
occurred in the same location later than 72 hours after stopping the treatment it is considered a new 
bleeding episode.

• 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculations were performed.  
The main statistical reporting of the trial was performed when  all patients had completed the initial main 
phase (core study) (52 weeks) with at least 50 EDs. Data from patients that had entered the extension 
phase at this point were included up to this cut-off date.  
• 
Randomisation 
There was no randomisation due to the single-arm nature of the trial. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, as this was an open-label trial. 
• 
Statistical methods 
Statistical Study Conduct 
All patients received the same treatment during the main phase and the extension phase of the trial. 
Therefore, the prophylactic effect was evaluated based on accumulated data from both main phase and 
extension phase when all patients has completed the main phase of the trial. 
Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets were defined in the protocol, as defined in ICH E9 guidelines: 
• 
Full analysis set (FAS) – all patients with efficacy data after exposure to nonacog beta pegol 
•  Safety analysis set – all patients exposed to nonacog beta pegol 
Statistical Analysis Methods 
The primary endpoint was a safety endpoint. The trial had no confirmatory secondary endpoints. 
Except for the confidence interval for inhibitor rate and for annualised bleeding rate, the evaluation of all 
other endpoints was based on descriptive analyses, i.e. summary tables, listings and figures. 
Inhibitor Rate 
The primary safety endpoint of this trial was evaluated when the main phase/core study of the trial was 
completed and included all data from patients already having entered the extension phase up to that 
cut-off date. The rate of neutralising inhibitors was reported and a 1-sided 97.5% upper confidence limit 
was provided based on an exact calculation for a binomial distribution. For the calculation of the rate, the 
numerator  included  the  patients  with  inhibitors,  while  the  denominator  included  all  patients  with  a 
minimum  of  10  EDs  plus  any  patient  with  less  than  10  EDs  but  with  inhibitors.  Adequate  safety  with 
regard to inhibitors was concluded if the observed rate was lower than or equal to 5%, corresponding to 
at most 1 inhibitor observed. The analysis was performed on the safety analysis set. 
Number of bleeding episodes during prophylaxis 
Number of bleeding episodes during prophylaxis was presented by type (spontaneous, traumatic or other 
origin). Annualised bleeding rate was summarised and a 95% two sided confidence interval was provided 
based on a Poisson regression model adjusting for exposure time and allowing for over-dispersion. As 
sensitivity  analysis  data  from  patients  withdrawing  prematurely  (but  after  more  than  1  month  on 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 105/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
prophylaxis) was imputed using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach. If patients dropped 
out due to ineffective prophylaxis this was expected to give a more correct estimate of the treatment 
effect. 
Haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol in treatment of bleeding episodes 
Summaries of this endpoint included bleeding episodes from both the main phase (core study) and the 
extension phase up to the cut-off date since they were treated in the same manner. Summaries were 
however also provided for the main phase (core study) alone. Description of the haemostatic effect of 
nonacog beta pegol when used for treatment of bleeding episodes was measured and listed according to 
the four point scale for haemostatic response (excellent, good, moderate and poor). 
Results  
• 
Participant flow  
A total of 28 patients were screened for this trial (Table 10–1) and 25 patients were enrolled, of which 12 
patients were in the age group of 0–6 years and 13 patients were in the 7–12 years age group. 
Of the 25 enrolled and exposed patients, 24 patients (96.0%) completed the main phase/core study of 
the trial (11 patients in the 0–6 years age group and 13 patients in the 7–12 years age group). One (1) 
patient withdrew during the main phase (core study) of the trial and 2 patients did not continue in the 
extension phase of the trial. No patients withdrew during the extension phase before the cut-off date. Of 
the patients that withdrew, 2 patients (7–12 years) withdrew at the end of main phase (core study), with 
>50 ED, due to fulfilling withdrawal criteria 5 (incapacity or unwillingness to follow trial procedures)  and 
1 patient (0–6 years) withdrew after 3.5 months, with 10 ED, due to withdrawal of consent. All withdrawn 
patients contributed with data until the date of withdrawal. No patients were withdrawn due to adverse 
events.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol Amendments 
There were 4 substantial amendments to the protocol. Three patients entered the extension phase before 
Amendment 4 was implemented. These patients were however not individually dosed due to the near 
execution of the amendment and continued on the 40 IUU/kg regime as in the main phase (core study) 
of the trial. 
Protocol Deviations 
Important protocol deviations at trial level: 
Three important protocol deviations were reported at trial level. The first deviation concerned a missing 
source data verification agreement for the trial. An agreement was therefore prepared and distributed to 
relevant parties. The second deviation concerned registration of patient data in an automatically updated 
version of LogPad (used to enter data into the eDiary), prior to local EC/IRB  approval. The issue was 
solved by removing the option of automatically updating LogPad, and ensuring that all updates were done 
manually by trial site staff. 
After the trial database for the present report had been locked, it was discovered that a total of 4 doses 
in 2 different patients had not been included in the database. This was reported as a protocol deviation at 
trial level. Since these two patients already fulfilled the definition for completion of the main phase (core 
study)  it  was  decided  to  leave  the  4  doses  out  of  the  calculations  as  this  did  not  change  any  of  the 
conclusions in the present report and in order to be able to comply with EU regulatory requirements to 
report paediatric trials within 6 months. The 4 doses will be part of the full report covering both the main 
phase (core study) and the extension phase of this trial. 
Deviations on trial unit level: 
In all, 12 important deviations were reported at trial unit level. These were related to monitoring outside 
the defined monitoring window, drug handling procedures, assessment of patient eligibility according to 
inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  laboratory  procedures,  ethics  committees/institutional  review  board 
procedures and involvement of non-trained personnel in the trial.

Numbers analysed 
The safety analysis set and the full analysis set both consisted of all dosed patients. Thus, a total of 25 
patients were included in these analysis sets. No patients were excluded from any analyses. 
• 
Outcomes and estimation 
Of the 25 patients included in the trial, 15 patients (60.0%) were treated for a total of 42 bleeds during 
the trial. In the 7–12 years age group, 76.9% of the patients (N=10) experienced treatment requiring 
bleeds, whereas this number was 41.7% (N=5) in the 0–6 years age group.  
The time since last dose of nonacog beta pegol was reported for 33 of the bleeding episodes. 66.7% 
(N=22) of the bleeds occurred after >4 days since last dose of nonacog beta pegol. The majority of the 
bleeds (N=25, 59.5%) were traumatic, 31.0% (N=13) were spontaneous and 9.5% (N=4) were of other 
origin.  
The most frequent location of bleeds was in a joint, which accounted for 35.7% (N=15) of the 42 bleeds 
with  reported  information  on  location.  Of  the  remaining  bleeds,  19.0%  (N=8)  were  muscular  or 
subcutaneous, respectively, and 16.7% (N=7) of the bleeds were mucosal. 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 110/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The bleeds were classified as mild/moderate in all of the cases. 2 (4.8%) of the total 42 bleeds resulted 
in re-bleeds, and the most frequently reported start time of a bleed was in the evening from 7 p.m. to 11 
p.m. The mean duration of bleeds for the 33 bleeds with reported information on duration was 51.6 h, 
whereas the median duration was 17.7 h. 
Joints (N=13, 41.9%) were the most frequent location of bleeds in the older age group and subcutaneous 
bleeds (N=5, 45.5%) were most common among the 0–6 years old patients. Most of the reported bleeds 
in the 0–6 years age group started in the morning  between 7 a.m. to 11 a.m.,  whereas most bleeds 
started in the evening between 7 p.m. to 11 p.m in the older age group. 
Haemostatic effect of treatment of bleeds 
All of the total 42 treatment requiring bleeding episodes in the trial were rated and the success rate was 
92.9%. The success rate was similar in the two age groups. 
Differences in treatment success between location of bleeds were also observed (Table 11–8). Whereas 
there  was  100%  success  in  treating  bleeds  in  target  joints  as  well  as  mucosal-,  muscular-, 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 111/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
gastrointestinal- and other bleeds, there occurred treatment failures in joint- (2 of the 3 failures) and 
subcutaneous bleeds (1 of the 3 failures). There was no association between treatment failure and time 
to treatment as all 3 failures were treated within 4h after onset of bleed. The number of injections of 
nonacog beta pegol to treat a bleed was recorded (Table 11–8). 36 bleeds were treated with 1 injection 
of nonacog beta pegol and resulted in 97.2% treatment success. Among the 3 failures registered, 1 bleed 
required 1 injection, 1 bleed required 2 injections, and 1 bleed was treated with 5 injections. 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 112/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of bleeds were resolved with 1 injection in both age groups. In 85.7% (36) of the cases, 1 
injection of nonacog beta pegol was used to treat a bleed. Two injections were given in 11.9% (5) of the 
cases and 5 injections were used in 2.4% (1) of the cases. 
Out of 42 bleeds in total, 39 were successfully treated. In 35 (89.7%) of the cases 1 injection was enough 
for successful treatment whereas 2 injections were needed in 4 (10.3%) of the cases. 
Annual bleeding rate 
Among  the  patients  treated  with  prophylaxis  over  52  weeks,  the  haemostatic  effect  assessed  as  an 
estimated  annual  bleeding  rate  (ABR)  was  calculated  from  the  total  number  of  breakthrough  bleeds 
(treatment-  requiring  bleeds)  reported  during  bleeding  prevention  divided  by  the  total  nonacog  beta 
pegol exposure time. The estimated ABR in the trial was 1.44 bleeds/patient/year for the entire patient 
population, 1.88 bleeds/patient/year in the 7–12 years age group and 0.87 bleeds/patient/year the 0–6 
years age group (Table 11–2).

Clinical studies in special populations 
Only one patient aged 65 years was enrolled into the clinical trial programme. As it is not a guideline 
requirement to recruit a specific number of older subjects, this is acceptable. Furthermore, efficacy in 
older adults with haemophilia B is expected to be comparable to younger age cohorts, the safety profile 
might differ, though. 
Supportive studies 
Surgery trial 3773 
This was an open-label, multi-centre, uncontrolled trial evaluating efficacy and safety of nonacog beta 
pegol in major surgical procedures in patients with haemophilia B. Patients enrolled in the present trial 
could  be  recruited  from  the  pivotal  trial  (NN7999-3747)  or  the  extension  trial  (NN7999-3775).  In 
addition, new patients could also be recruited into the present trial. After trial completion, patients were 
offered to continue on prophylaxis or on-demand treatment in the extension trial (NN7999-3775). 
Efficacy of nonacog beta pegol during surgical procedures was assessed using a 4-point scale.  
Haemostatic effect (4-point scale) 
Clinical evaluation of haemostatic response during surgery was assessed immediately after surgery (last 
stitch) by the surgeon, anaesthesiologist and/or investigator based on experience as follows: 
1. Excellent: Better than expected/predicted in this type of procedure. 
2. Good: As expected in this type of procedure. 
EMA/346525/2017

3. Moderate: Less than optimal for the type of procedure but haemostatic response maintained without 
change of treatment regimen. 
4.  Poor:  Bleeding  due  to  inadequate  therapeutic  response  with  adequate  dosing,  change  of  regimen 
required. 
In  addition,  transfusion  requirements  (during  surgery  and  post-operatively  through  Day  6  or  until 
discharge), haemoglobin, consumption and number of doses per procedure were recorded as part of the 
efficacy assessment. 
Results  
A total of 13 surgeries were performed in 13 patients 
The haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol was rated as ‘excellent’ in 10 (76.9%) and as ‘good’ in 3 
(23.1%) of the surgeries, thus, the success rate was 100%.  
The mean pre-operative dose was 81.8 IU/kg ranging from 80.9 to 83.6 IU/kg. All pre-operative doses 
were administered as one single injection and none of the patients needed additional doses on the day of 
surgery. 
During surgery, 2 patients (1 patient with a total right knee arthroplasty and 1 with prothetic total hip 
arthroplasty) were transfused with 300 and 250 mL packed red blood cells, respectively.

The trial was an open label, non-randomised, multi-national trial with the purpose of evaluating safety 
and clinical efficacy of treatment of bleeding episodes and for long-term prophylaxis with nonacog beta 
pegol. Patients enrolled in the present trial could be recruited from the pivotal trial (NN7999-3747) or the 
surgery trial (NN7999-3773). 
The  10  IU/kg  and  40  IU/kg  weekly  prophylaxis  and  the  40  IU/kg  on-demand  treatment  arms  were 
identical  to  those  from  the  pivotal  trial  (NN7999-3747)  in  order  to  collect  additional  safety  data. 
Furthermore,  clinical  efficacy  of  haemostasis  (treatment  of  bleeding  episodes),  in  long  term  bleeding 
prophylaxis (number of bleeding episodes during prophylaxis) and FIX activity were investigated. 
The 80 IU/kg prophylaxis dosing every second week was introduced in a protocol amendment as a new 
treatment option to reduce the burden of injections for patient convenience. This dose level was based on 
phase  1  PK  data  as  well  as  mechanistic  modelling.  The  four  different  treatment  arms  are  depicted  in 
Figure 9–1. Patients were free to switch between treatment arms if agreed between the investigator and 
the patient. Patients could start and stop the 80 IU/kg treatment at an unscheduled visit if there was more 
than 1 month remaining to the next scheduled visit. 
Patients  with  on-demand  treatment  and  patients  on  prophylaxis  who  experienced  a  bleeding  episode 
were to treat the bleeding episode with a single dose of 40 IU/kg, unless the bleeding episode was severe 
in which case it was to be treated with 80 IU/kg. 
The trial was closed earlier than planned due to lack of sufficient trial drug supply.  
A total of 71 patients were enrolled in this trial (15 adolescents [13-17 years] and 56 adults [18-66 
years]). Six patients were withdrawn, one subject due to ineffective therapy (40 IU/kg/week). 
Table 14 
A key feature of this trial was that patients could shift treatment arms during the trial if agreed between 
the patient and the investigator. A total of 9 patients (12.7%) changed treatment arm during this trial as 
EMA/346525/2017

depicted  in  Table  10–2.  The  remaining  62  patients  (87.3%)  stayed  on  the  same  treatment  arm 
throughout the trial. 
Treatment of bleeding events 
Of  the  total  207  bleeds  in  the  trial,  87.9%  were  resolved  with  1  injection  of  nonacog  beta  pegol,  an 
additional 9.2% were resolved with 2 injections, and the last 2.9% bleeds were solved with 3-4 injections. 
In the 40 IU/kg prophylaxis arm 84.7% of the bleeding episodes were resolved with 1 injection of nonacog 
beta pegol compared with 82.9% for the 10 IU/kg prophylaxis arm. A total of 94.5% of bleeding episodes 
were resolved with 1 injection in the on-demand arm. Furthermore, the highest number of injections to 
treat a bleed was 4 injections, which occurred only once in the 40 IU/kg. A maximum of 3 injections were 
used to resolve all bleeds in the 10 IU/kg prophylaxis arm and on-demand arm. 
The median of nonacog beta pegol required per bleeding episode was 42.3 IU/kg. The haemostatic effect 
in the treatment of bleeding episodes is consistent with that observed in the pivotal study. 
Annualised bleeding rate 
Estimated ABR was 1.84 (95% CI: 1.00; 3.38) for the 10 IU/kg treatment arm and 1.84 (95% CI: 1.26; 
2.70) for the 40 IU/kg treatment arm. For traumatic bleeds, estimated ABR was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.20; 
1.39) for the 10 IU/kg treatment arm versus 1.01 (95% CI: 0.64; 1.57) for the 40 IU/kg treatment arm.  
Trough levels 
Nonacog  beta  pegol  administered  once  weekly  maintained  FIX  activity  levels  significantly  above  0.01 
IU/mL and the estimated mean FIX trough levels during the trial were 0.098 IU/mL for the 10 IU/kg arm 
and 0.213 IU/mL for the 40 IU/kg arm. 
Consumption of nonacog beta pegol 
EMA/346525/2017

Consumption of FIX is consistent over time in comparison to the pivotal trial. 
Efficacy in surgery 
A  total  of  14  patients  underwent  24  surgical  procedures  divided  into  the  following  categories:  Dental 
procedures  (11),  endoscopy  (5),  skin  incision,  drainage  and  excision  (4),  orthopaedic  surgery  (2), 
cataract surgery (1), and port-a-cath removal (1). 
Three major surgeries were performed in this trial (all dental): 
• 
Two surgical removals of impaction teeth (10 IU/kg prophylaxis) 
•  One odontectomy and extraction (40 IU/kg prophylaxis) 
Clinical evaluation of haemostatic response during surgery was assessed the surgeon, anaesthesiologist 
and/or investigator. In all, 20 out of 24 surgical procedures (83%) were recorded as “excellent”, 2 as 
“good”, and the remaining 2 were not determined. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design of the two submitted pivotal clinical trials investigating the efficacy (study 3747 in PTPs >12 
years  old)  and  study  3774  in  PTPs  ≤12  years  old)  of  nonacog  beta  pegol  follows  and  exceeds  the 
requirements  of  the  current  guideline  for  recombinant  FIX  products  (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009 
Rev. 1, Corr. 1) regarding the number and age distribution of subjects included as well as the number of 
exposure days observed. In addition, the extension trial 3775 as well as the dedicated surgery trial 3773 
provide data supporting the efficacy of Refixia.  
Study 3747 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 120/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
In the clinical trials the efficacy of nonacog beta pegol was explored for the prevention as well as for the 
treatment of bleeding events. Trial 3747 investigated the efficacy of Refixia for prophylactic as well as 
on-demand treatment in 74 PTPs >12 years of age (Arm 1: prophylaxis with 10 IU/kg once weekly; Arm 
2: prophylaxis with 40 IU/kg once weekly; Arm 3: On demand treatment of Bleeding Events). Subjects 
undergoing  prophylaxis  treatment  were  randomized  to  one  of  the  two  prophylaxis  arms  and  blinded 
towards assignment to 10 or 40 IU/kg once weekly. Trial 3774 investigated the efficacy of nonacog beta 
pegol for the prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds in 25 PTPs ≤12 years age at a prophylactic dose of 40 
IU/kg. 
Study 3775 
In the extension trial 3775 the sustained efficacy of Refixia was investigated in 71 subjects >12 years 
after long term treatment at the same doses as those in the pivotal trial.  
Study 3773 
The dedicated surgery trial 3773 contributed to the dossier with data from 13 major surgical procedures 
in 13 PTPS >12.  
Study 3774 
The investigated patient population in study 3774 was multi-national and included 25 previously treated 
children (0-≤12 years of age), suffering from severe to moderately severe haemophilia B defined as FIX 
levels ≤2%. This fulfils guideline requirements. The extension phase of trial 3774 in 22 children ≤12 is 
currently ongoing, with limited safety data available for review. 
In addition, 16 patients were exposed to nonacog beta pegol in the phase  I trial 3639, from which 6 
patients rolled over into the pivotal trial 3747. 
The primary endpoint in Trials 3747, 3775 and 3774 was incidence of inhibitory antibodies (inhibitors) 
against  FIX.  The  secondary  endpoints  related  to  efficacy  in  these  trials  were  defined  as  follows: 
Haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol when used for treatment of bleeds (4 point scale); Number of 
injections of nonacog beta pegol required per bleeding episode; Consumption of nonacog beta pegol; 
Estimated annualised bleeding rate during prophylaxis; FIX trough levels at steady-state. All of these 
endpoints are considered appropriate and relevant. 
For the evaluation of the effects of nonacog beta pegol in surgery trial 3773, investigators’/surgeons’ 
assessments  of  subjects’  response  to  surgery  on  a  4-point  scale  as  well  as  transfusion  requirements, 
haemoglobin levels, consumption and number of doses per procedure were defined as efficacy endpoints, 
fulfilling guideline requirements and are considered appropriate. 
Statistical methods 3747 pivotal trial 
The applicant has thoroughly pre-planned the decision strategy and the hypotheses, endpoints and the 
analysis tests were generally well described. Due to this fact and due to the wide appropriateness of the 
analyses  only  minor  statistical  concerns  were  identified  and  have  been  adequately  addressed  in  the 
response to questions. 
The hierarchical procedure of first testing the primary endpoint on the inhibitor rate, thereafter testing the 
haemostatic  effect  of  nonacog  beta  pegol,  and  finally  testing  prophylactic  efficacy  (starting  with  the 
higher dose, followed by the lower dose) controls the type I error. However, the primary test on inhibitor 
rate is rather artificial, as a goal to exclude only a rate of 10.7% is not a meaningful target per se, but only 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 121/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
describes  what  is  scientifically  demonstrated,  in  case  one  out  of  50  patients  with  an  inhibitor  was 
observed. The analysis for this endpoint using the binomial distribution is appropriate.  
The  dichotomization  (success/failure)  of  the  4-point  scale  facilitates  analysis  and  interpretation  of 
haemostatic efficacy in the treatment of bleeds. Treating bleeds as if each occurred in a different patient 
would provide incorrect analyses results. This was correctly recognized by the applicant and a logistic 
regression for repeated measurements was planned. However, the applicant had incorrectly applied an 
'independent' correlation structure for the analysis in the CSR. This in effect however has the untoward 
consequence that in fact 'no correlation' was assumed, i.e. that all bleeds were treated as if stemming 
from different patients. Post-hoc results using an exchangeable correlation structure were performed for 
the Summary of Clinical Efficacy, and in response to the questions a further autoregressive correlation 
structure was utilized. Both analyses confirmed robustness to these assumptions. While the use of the 
lower limit of the 95% CI is appropriate, the applicant has described a target of 65% as a non-inferiority 
aim for a haemostatic efficacy rate of 80%. The CHMP did not agree, instead such an approach would only 
demonstrate  that  haemostatic  efficacy  is  at  least  65%.  Nevertheless,  the  lower  limit  of  the 
95%-confidence interval anyway by far exceeded this threshold. 
The statistical approach for testing efficacy of prophylactic treatment using the upper limit of the 95% 
confidence  interval  is  appropriate.  The  target  threshold  of  4.8  ABRs  is  difficult  to  assess,  based  on 
uncertainties on the proposed 'baseline on-demand rate' of 12 ABRs (underlined by the baseline bleeding 
rate of the study subjects, which has been much larger then this assumption) and the arbitrariness of a 
target  reduction  of  60%.  Nevertheless,  the  resulting  target  of  not  more  than  4.8  bleeds  per  year  is 
sufficiently low to justify that a treatment that meets this target can be regarded as efficacious in bleeding 
prophylaxis. The statistical analysis using a Poisson regression model is supported. A post-hoc Negative 
Binomial  Regression  analysis  has  been  provided  and  the  respective  results  show  that  the  results  are 
robust to the choice of this analysis model. The applicant has thoroughly discussed the weaknesses of the 
preplanned Poisson regression model in case of withdrawals. Nevertheless, the 'LOCF' method performed 
as sensitivity analysis was not helpful as this merely 'carries forward' the same event rate as observed 
before withdrawal. An additional analysis was therefore requested which imputed missing data with the 
bleeding rate observed in patients previously on on-demand treatment. This resulted in more reasonable, 
less optimistic, but still acceptable estimates of the ABR. Another analysis requested a direct comparison 
of  the  on-trial  ABR  versus  the  individual  pre-study  bleeding  rate  using  a  repeated  Poisson  regression 
model and the results from this supported efficacy (of both doses) of nonacog beta pegol. 
Statistical methods 3774 pivotal paediatric trial 
Inhibitor  rate  was  defined  as  the  only  primary  endpoint  and  the  trial  had  no  confirmatory  secondary 
endpoints. The primary safety endpoint was evaluated when the main phase/core study of the trial was 
completed and included all data from patients already having entered the extension phase up to that 
cut-off date. The rate of neutralising inhibitors was analysed using an appropriate exact calculation for a 
binomial distribution. 
For  the  number  of  bleeding  episodes  during  prophylaxis  the  annualised  bleeding  rate  was  presented 
based  on  an  appropriate  Poisson  regression  model.  Despite  the  small  sample  size  a  very  narrow 
95%-confidence  interval  for  the  ABR  could  be  estimated.  Though  not  predefined  a  Negative  Binomial 
Regression Analysis has also been performed and this sensitivity analysis confirmed robustness of the 
results to the choice of the analysis model. The evaluation of the haemostatic effect of nonacog beta pegol 
in treatment of bleeding episodes was based on descriptive analyses only, but was confirmed on request 
using appropriate statistical analysis. Consistent efficacy results are provided irrespective of the window 
for inclusion of data, i.e. including only data from the main phase or also including some data from the 
extension phase.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the pivotal trial 3747 the mean bleeding rates (4.56 and 2.51 in the 10 IU/kg dose prophylaxis arm and 
40 IU/kg dose prophylaxis, respectively) confirm the beneficial effect of prophylaxis with Refixia observed 
in this trial. These annualized bleeding rates also compare favourably to published results from trials with 
other licensed FIX products. 
The weekly doses of nonacog beta pegol for subjects was 10 IU/kg and 40 IU/kg. Although the outcome 
of the 10 IU/kg arm did not meet the prespecified efficacy criterion of the upper bound of the two-sided 
95% confidence interval for the annualised bleeding rate (ABR) being below 4.8, a comparison of the 
ABRs of the two arms found no statistically significant difference. 
Regarding the efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events, in 92.2% of bleeding episodes the response to 
nonacog beta pegol was rated as excellent or good. 87% were controlled by 1 injection and 10.4% by 2 
injections. The median amount of Refixia needed for the treatment of a bleed was ~ 42 IU/kg, reflecting 
the need for one dose in most cases. 
The median annual consumption of FIX was 673.7 IU/kg for 10 IU/kg dose, 2279 IU/kg for 40 IU/kg dose 
and  801.6  IU/kg  for  on  demand  treatment  arms,  respectively.  These  values  appear  lower  than  those 
observed with non-prolonged factor IX products, most conceivably due to the higher IR and less frequent 
administration intervals. 
Trough  levels  at  steady  state  in  the  prophylactic  arms  were  considerably  higher  than  those  usually 
targeted with prophylaxis therapy. Levels of 0.085 IU/mL (95% CI 0.077; 0.093) were estimated in the 
10 IU/kg dose arm and 0.273 IU/mL (95% CI 0.248; 0.300) in the 40 IU/kg dose arm. The 10 IU/kg dose 
group thus reflects new approaches to elevate the trough to 5-15%, while the 40 IU/kg dose prophylaxis 
generates even higher levels. These results also reflect that a treatment interval larger than one week 
could have been realistically considered for prophylaxis with Refixia. 
In the paediatric population of trial 3774 the mean annualized bleeding rate was 0.83 in the <6 years of 
age cohort, 1.96 in the 6  to <12 years of age cohort, and 1.42 in the total of both age cohorts. The 
prophylactic dose administered was 40 IU/kg once weekly in both age cohort. 
In 92.9% of bleeding episodes in the overall population the response to nonacog beta pegol  was rated as 
excellent or good, with 90.9% for younger and 93.5% for older children. Overall, 85.7% were controlled 
by 1 injection (81.8% in younger and 87.1% in older children) and 11.9% by 2 injections (9.1% and 
12.9%). The median amount of Refixia needed for the treatment of a bleed was ~ 43 IU/kg in both age 
cohorts, reflecting the need for one dose in most cases.  
The median annual consumption of nonacog beta pegol was 2304.8 for younger children, 2391.5 for older 
children and 2355.5 IU/kg overall, respectively. These values also appear lower than those observed with 
non-prolonged  factor  IX  products,  most  conceivably  due  to  the  higher  recovery  and  less  frequent 
administration intervals. 
The estimated mean steady state FIX trough levels were 0.154 IU/mL for the 0–6 years age group and 
0.190 IU/mL for the 7–12 years age group. These levels are again considerably higher than those usually 
targeted with prophylactic therapy. 
Outcomes  from  the  extension  trial  in  PTPs  >12  years  (3775),  where  71  subjects  were  treated  for  an 
additional  year  with  the  same  modality  as  in  the  pivotal  trial  confirmed  that  the  haemostatic  and 
prophylactic efficacy after prolonged administration of nonacog beta pegol is sustained. The guideline 
requirement  to  submit  data  of  a  minimum  of  5  patients  undergoing  at  least  10  surgical  procedures 
(comprising  major  surgeries)  is  exceeded.  In  the  dedicated  surgery  trial  3773  the  efficacy  of  Refixia 
during surgery was investigated through 13 major surgical procedures in 13 subjects. Additionally, in the 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 123/154 
 
 
  
 
 
extension trial 14 patients underwent 24 surgical procedures, of which 3 were rated as major. The vast 
majority of evaluable surgeries were assessed as excellent or good by the surgeon or investigator. 
Additional expert consultation 
An ad hoc expert group meeting was convened on 28 November 2016 and were asked to respond to the 
following efficacy question as agreed by CHMP: 
How would you consider the potential clinical treatment benefit that Refixia could provide in 
the treatment of Haemophilia B? 
It was acknowledged that in principle maintaining physiological levels of FIX is expected to be associated 
with relevant clinical outcomes. Based on the clinical data presented, Refixia 40 IU/kg once weekly was 
able to sustain FIX levels in normal range (> 40%) for 5.4 days/week, which is promising. Treatment with 
Refixia was associated with improved quality of life with just a single infusion per week. Although it was 
questioned whether the trough levels need to be as high as 40%, the longer time between infusions is 
expected to result in better compliance and less burden for patients.  
However, available data in terms of PK do not allow assessing directly how much higher trough levels 
obtained translate into a substantial and measurable clinical benefit. For a conclusive evaluation of the 
clinical benefits, randomized trials using sensitive endpoints should be conducted (if feasible considering 
the high level of patient individualisation issues with regards to duration and choice of comparator for 
example). The experts also questioned the choice of the doses of 10 and 40 IU/kg, and that doses in 
between were not investigated.  It was highlighted that if licenced at 40IU/kg, many clinicians would use 
doses of 20-35 IU/kg weekly. 
Due  to  the  existing  uncertainties  and  the  modest  benefits  (despite  some  benefits  are  expected),  the 
clinical benefit of the treatment cannot be considered positive in children < 12 years old. For adolescents 
and  adults  further  studies  with  more  appropriate  comparison  groups  and  more  meaningful  clinical 
outcomes are useful. 
Considering the above, the CHMP has added the following recommendation with regards to the 
prophylactic dose in section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
“Prophylaxis 
40 IU/kg body weight once weekly. Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered 
based on achieved FIX levels and individual bleeding tendency.” 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The submitted data are considered sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of nonacog beta pegol for the 
prevention and treatment of bleeding events in patients with Haemophilia B as well as efficacy during 
surgery. The 40 IU/kg per week dose investigated in one arm in the pivotal trial as well as in the paediatric 
trial yielded satisfactory results with regard to prophylaxis of bleeding events. Overall bleedings as well as 
bleedings into target joints observed in the pivotal trial showed superior results in comparison to the 10 
IU/kg per week prophylactic dose, therefore the Applicant proposed to license only the 40 IU/kg weekly 
dose, which can be agreed. In addition and also taking into consideration the ad hoc expert group advice, 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 124/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
the following recommendation has been added in section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
“Prophylaxis 
40 IU/kg body weight once weekly. 
Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FIX levels and 
individual bleeding tendency.” 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data are derived from the following trials: 
Previously treated patients: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Trial 3639 – phase 1 first human dose trial in adults. 
Trial 3747 – phase 3 pivotal trial in adolescent and adult patients. 
Trial 3773 – phase 3 surgery trial in adolescent and adult patients. 
Trial 3775 – phase 3 extension trial in adolescent and adult patients. 
Trial 3774 – phase 3 trial in paediatric patients. This trial consists of a completed main phase and 
an ongoing extension phase. 
Previously untreated patients: 
• 
Trial 3895 – phase 3 trial in previously untreated patients (<6 years). This trial is ongoing. 
The summary of clinical safety includes safety information on all patients exposed to nonacog beta pegol 
in clinical trials as of the cut-off date of 07 April 2014 which was the date when all paediatric patients had 
completed the main phase of the paediatric trial (Trial 3774). Safety data from ongoing trials are provided 
for deaths, serious adverse events and medical events of special interest until the cut-off date 01 April 
2016.  
Grouping and pooling of data 
Safety  data  from  all  completed  trials  (Trials  3639,  3747,  3773,  3775  and  3774  [main  phase])  in 
previously treated patients are pooled, including safety during surgery. 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  115  unique  previously  treated  patients  have  been  exposed  to  nonacog  beta  pegol  in  the 
completed clinical trials (Trials 3639, 3747, 3773, 3775 and 3774 [main phase]), with a total of 8801 
exposure  days.  The  majority  of  patients  participated  in  more  than  one  trial  which  is  why  the  sum  of 
patients in the individual trials is higher than the total number of unique patients. 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 125/154 
 
 
  
 
 
Exposure to commercial product 
In the extension phase of the paediatric trial patients were exposed to the commercial product. The 21 
paediatric patients in the extension phase of Trial 3774 were exposed to the commercial product for 10 to 
53 exposure days (Table 12) with the majority exposed for 20 to 29 exposure days. 
Adverse events 
A total of 645 adverse events were reported in 98 (85.2%) patients. The overall rate was 3.8 adverse 
events per patient year of exposure. The rate of adverse events was higher in children aged 0-12 years 
than in adolescents and adults aged ≥13 years. As expected, this difference was mainly driven by frequent 
adverse events concerning common childhood diseases and did not raise any safety concern. 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 126/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the completed trials, the most commonly reported adverse events were nasopharyngitis (35 events in 
19 [16.5%] patients), upper respiratory tract infection (20 events in 13 [11.3%] patients), contusion (27 
events in 15 [13.0%] patients) and cough (23 events in 14 [12.2%] patients).  
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 127/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In the completed trials, a total of 37 adverse events in 23 patients were evaluated by the investigator as 
possibly or probably related to trial product corresponding to a rate of 0.2 events per patient year of 
exposure. However, most of these adverse events were considered unlikely related by the applicant.

The applicant´s assessment was not endorsed for all adverse events. Eventually, the following adverse 
events are included in the tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC as a causal 
relationship cannot be excluded: hypersensitivity, palpitations, nausea, pruritus, fatigue, hot flush and 
injections site reactions. 
Thromboembolic events 
No thromboembolic events were reported in the completed trials nor were any thromboembolic events 
reported in the ongoing trials. 
Medication errors 
In all trials, medication errors were considered as medical events of special interest. Potential medication 
errors were identified through an NNMQ and 15 events were identified in 10 patients in the completed 
trials.  The  applicant´s  conclusion  that  the  reported  events  can  be  considered  similar  to  what  would 
generally be expected with other coagulation factor replacement products is agreed. Furthermore, there 
were no medications errors with regard to dosing frequency. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions are known to occur with injection of FIX products. Potential injection site reactions 
were identified through an NNMQ and included events that were reported as injection site pain, infusion 
site  pain,  injection  site  swelling  (as  a  result  of  subcutaneous  administration  of  nonacog  beta  pegol), 
injection site erythema and injection site rash. A total of 5 injection site reactions were reported in 4 
patients in the completed trials.

This evaluation is based on safety data revealed in previously treated patients.  
In an ongoing trial in previously untreated patients, anaphylactic reaction has occurred in close temporal 
association with development of FIX inhibitor following treatment with nonacog beta pegol. Both events 
are included in the tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
One death occurred in an adult patient diagnosed with metastatic stage IV hepatocellular carcinoma after 
499  days  in  the  trial  programme.  The  underlying  disease  as  well  as  the  death  is  considered  unlikely 
related to nonacog beta pegol and no safety concerns arise from this event with fatal outcome. 
Serious adverse events 
In the completed trials, a total of 12 serious adverse events in 11 patients were reported. Except for one 
serious  adverse  event  of  hypersensitivity,  all  other  serious  adverse  events  were  evaluated  by  the 
investigator and Novo Nordisk as unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol. 
Allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions 
One patient experienced a hypersensitivity reaction when exposed to 25 IU/kg nonacog beta pegol. It was 
the first administration of nonacog beta pegol for this patient. This event was considered possibly related 
by the investigator and the patient was withdrawn from the trial. The patient fully recovered from the 
adverse event. Hypersensitivity reactions are possible with FIX products and have been observed rarely. 
A warning statement is included in section 4.4 and hypersensitivity reactions are included in the summary 
of safety profile in section 4.8 of the SmPC of nonacog beta pegol.  
The applicant conducted searches in the safety dataset using both a narrow and a broad NNMQ search 
‘allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions’. A total of 5 events in 4 patients were judged by the investigator 
to be possibly or probably related to nonacog beta pegol. These 5 events were hypersensitivity, pruritus, 
eosinophilia, injection site rash, and wheezing.

As of 01 April 2016, one previously untreated patient in Trial 3895 experienced serious adverse events. 
Prior to entering Trial 3895, the patient had been exposed for 2 exposure days to standard rFIX which was 
within the protocol definition of a previously untreated patient. The patient had an anaphylactic reaction 
after the fourth exposure with nonacog beta pego. lThe patient was treated immediately with intravenous 
hydrocortisone and was referred for further treatment in the paediatric emergency room and recovered 
within  1  hour.  The  patient  was  found  to  have  FIX  inhibitors  and  was  withdrawn  from  treatment  with 
nonacog beta pegol. The patient was reported to have high responding inhibitors considered a chronic 
condition  which  is  not  expected  to  recover.  The  events  were  judged  to  be  probably  related  by  the 
investigator and possibly related by Novo Nordisk. Approximately 3 weeks later (no longer on nonacog 
beta pegol treatment), the patient had a mouth haemorrhage that was reported as an unlikely related 
serious adverse event in this trial. The patient was treated with NovoSeven and recovered from the event. 
One previously treated patient (child) in Trial 3774 (extension phase) had 3 serious adverse events of 
viral upper respiratory tract infection, wheezing and otitis media. All events were reported on the same 
day  and  the  patient  was  admitted  to  the  hospital  where  he  was  treated  with  paracetamol,  amoxillin, 
salbutamol  and  ipratropium.  Two  days  later,  the  patient  was  discharged  from  the  hospital  and  he 
recovered from all the events. The events were judged to be unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol by the 
investigator and Novo Nordisk. 
Apart from these events, no other serious adverse events were reported in the ongoing trials in the period 
from 08 April 2014 to 01 April 2016. 
Nonclinical findings 
In the pivotal repeat dose toxicity study in Cynomolgus monkeys PEG was found in the brain vasculature 
at all three dose levels, whereas PEG was detected in the choroid plexus only at higher doses (1300 or 
3750 IU/kg). In the pivotal repeat dose toxicity study in rats, PEG was detected in the choroid plexus at 
all dose levels (40 IU/kg – 1200 IU/kg) and was also present in choroid plexus at 1200 IU/kg after 26 
weeks recovery. Detection of PEG is not completely unexpected, since this was described in the past for 
other products containing PEG proteins, where also cases of cellular vacuolation of the choroid plexus 
epithelial  cells  (ependymal  cells)  have  been  observed  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  with 
proteins  PEGylated  with  molecules  ≥  40  kDa  (CHMP  Safety  Working  Party’s  response  to  the  PDCO 
regarding 
the 
use 
of 
PEGylated 
drug 
products 
in 
the 
paediatric 
population”, 
EMA/CHMP/SWP/647258/2012).   
In PEG alone studies, vacuolation of macrophages in the interstitium of the choroid plexus, red pulp of the 
spleen and mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes most likely due to accumulation of 40K PEG could be 
observed in rats after 6 weeks treatment in the high dose groups (45 mg/kg and 117 mg/kg), but not in 
the  low  dosed  animals.  These  findings  were  accompanied  by  reduction  of  bodyweight  gain  and  food 
consumption in males, indicating a systemic toxic effect. No detectable level of vacuolation was found 
after two weeks of treatment. Furthermore, vacuolation of the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus of the 
brain was observed at 45 mg/kg/week after 6 weeks of treatment in Cynomolgus monkeys. Treatment 
with 7 mg/kg/week over 13 weeks and 45 mg/kg/week over 2 weeks did not result in any change in the 
epithelial cells. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, no clinically relevant changes associated with exposure to trial product have been observed for 
parameters of haematology, biochemistry, coagulation-related parameters and urinalysis in any of the 
clinical trials with nonacog beta pegol.

Safety in special populations 
Safety in patients <2 years of age 
Three (3) patients were  <2 years of age by the time of inclusion in  Trial 3774. The mean number of 
exposure days with nonacog beta pegol was 60 ranging from 53 to 68. 
A total of 55 adverse events were reported in the three patients. None of the adverse events were serious 
or severe. Two events (abdominal pain and diarrhoea) in one patient were judged to be possibly related 
to  nonacog  beta  pegol  by  the  investigator  while  the  remaining  53  events  were  judged  to  be  unlikely 
related. 
One  previously  untreated patient  in  the  ongoing  Trial  3895  experienced  an  anaphylactic  reaction  and 
developed a FIX inhibitor. This event is described above. 
Safety in patients >50 years of age 
Patients≤70 years of age could be included in Trials 3747 and 3773, and continue in Trial 3775. 
Only one patient was 65 years old at inclusion in Trial 3747 and 66 years old when he continued in Trial 
3775. No safety concerns were identified for this patient. All other patients were below 65 years of age. 
Overall, no specific safety concerns for nonacog beta pegol are expected with increasing age. 
Eleven (11) patients were >50 years of age by the time of inclusion. The mean number of exposure days 
was 84.8 ranging from 8 to 120 exposure days. 
A total of 89 adverse events were reported in the 11 patients. One of the events (skin ulcer for one patient 
in Trial 3747) was serious while the remaining 88 were non-serious. In addition, 9 of the 89 events were 
judged to be possibly or probably related to nonacog beta pegol by the investigator. As there is limited 
experience  in  elderly  patients,  the  population  is  considered  to  be  missing  information  and  therefore 
included in the risk management plan. 
Pregnancy and lactation 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with nonacog beta pegol.  
Hepatic impairment 
The safety profile for Refixia is not expected to be different in patients with hepatic impairment when 
compared to patients with normal liver function.

Validation summaries and reports of the Nijmengen-modified FIX Bethesda assay used in Novo Nordisk 
and Esoterix  laboratories, Anti-nonacog beta pegol IgE ImmunoCAP assay, rFIX IgE ImmunoCAP assay, 
Tryptase measurement, nonacog beta pegol ELISA, Anti-CHO HCP antibody assay, the Anti-murine IgG 
antibody assay used to assess the immunogenicity and the Lupus coagulant assay were provided by the 
applicant. All validations have been performed according to the ICH Q2 and other relevant guidelines. 
FIX Inhibitors 
Inhibitor development was assessed throughout the development programme, and tests for FIX inhibitors 
were performed in all clinical trials. All cases of inhibitors were to be recorded as adverse events and 
medical events of special interest. 
None of the previously treated patients had any positive FIX inhibitor samples (≥0.6 BU), and thus, no 
patients developed  inhibitors  in  the  completed  trials.  Additionally,  as  lack  of  drug  effect  may  point to 
inhibitor  development  cases  of  ‘lack  of  efficacy’  were  also  evaluated  in  connection  with  evaluation  of 
inhibitors. No adverse events of ‘lack of efficacy’ were reported and therefore not considered a safety 
concern unless it is related to inhibitor development. It should be noted, however, that two patients were 
withdrawn with the reason ‘ineffective therapy’, which were not reported as adverse events. 
One  previously  untreated  patient  in  the  ongoing  Trial  3895  developed  a  FIX  inhibitor,  and  thus, 
development of FIX inhibitors is an identified risk with nonacog beta pegol treatment. 
Other antibodies 
EMA/346525/2017

Tests for anti-nonacog beta pegol binding antibodies and anti-CHO HCP antibodies were performed in 
Trials 3747, 3773, 3774 and 3775. In Trial 3639, tests for anti-nonacog beta pegol binding antibodies 
were  performed  while  tests  for  anti-CHO  HCP  antibodies  were  performed  only  in  cases  of 
allergic/anaphylactic reactions or inhibitor development.  
A total of five patients had positive titres for anti-CHO HCP antibodies during the nonacog beta pegol 
development programme. One of these patients was positive prior to dosing with nonacog beta pegol. All 
positive anti-CHO HCP antibodies titres were low and none of these were reported as adverse events. 
Anti-nonacog beta pegol binding antibodies were identified in three patients, of which two were positive 
prior to exposure to nonacog beta pegol. None of the anti-nonacog beta pegol binding antibodies had any 
inhibitory  effect,  and  patients  were  only  transiently  positive.  Overall,  detection  of  antibodies  did  not 
correlate with any adverse events or reduced trough FIX activity levels. Accordingly, no heightened risk 
was identified in any of the patient populations. 
In the period from 08 April 2014 to 01 April 2016, none of the previously treated patients exposed to  
Refixia  in  the  extension  phase  of  Trial  3774  developed  inhibitors,  anti-nonacog  beta  pegol  binding 
antibodies or anti-CHO HCP antibodies. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug interaction studies have been performed. Formal drug-drug interaction studies are generally not 
applicable for coagulation factors and no interactions of human coagulation factor IX products with other 
medicinal products have been reported (Core-SmPC for FIX products). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Two previously treated patients (1.7%) were withdrawn due to adverse events in the completed trials. 
One of the events  was an allergic-type hypersensitivity reaction, while the other was a fatal event of 
hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, one previously untreated patient was withdrawn in the ongoing 
Trial 3895 due to an anaphylactic reaction. 
No patients were withdrawn due to adverse events of ‘lack of efficacy’. It should be noted, however, that 
two patients were withdrawn with the reason ‘ineffective therapy’, which were not reported as adverse 
events  (the  reason  for  withdrawal  was  not  further  specified):  one  of  the  patients  was  an  on-demand 
patient in Trial 3747 (36 days exposure time), the other patient was a 40 IU/kg once weekly prophylaxis 
patient in Trial 3775 (82 days exposure time). None of the patients had inhibitors or binding antibodies to 
nonacog beta pegol at any time point. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data are derived from 5 completed trials in a total of 115 unique previously treated patients (trials 
3639, 3747, 3773, 3775 and main phase of 3774) including 12 patients 0-6 years of age, 13 patients 7-12 
years of age, 18 patients 13-17 years of age and 72 patients 18-70 years of age. Safety data from all 
completed trials in previously treated patients were pooled, including safety during surgery. The guideline 
requirement to follow and document at least 20 PTPs ≥12 years of age for a minimum of 50 exposure days 
and at least 20 children (0-<12 years of age) for 50 exposure days was fulfilled. 
The extension phase of the paediatric trial (3774) and the trial in previously untreated patients (3895) are 
still  ongoing  and  CRFs  and  narratives  were  provided  for  deaths,  serious  adverse  events  and  medical 
events of special interest as of 01 April 2016.  
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 135/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
A total of 645 adverse events were reported in 98 (85.2%) patients. Most of the adverse events were of 
mild  severity  and  considered  unrelated  to  nonacog  beta  pegol.  The  nature  and  frequency  of  adverse 
events does not give rise to concern and do not reveal unexpected safety signals. 37 adverse events in 23 
patients were considered possibly or probably related to nonacog beta pegol by the investigator but most 
of these adverse events were considered unlikely related by the applicant. The applicant´s conclusion 
that all these adverse events are not related to nonacog beta pegol is not endorsed for all adverse events. 
From the provided data a causal relationship with nonacog beta pegol cannot be excluded for the following 
adverse events:  fatigue, hot flush, nausea and palpitations. These adverse events were added to the 
tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC, accordingly.   
One death considered unlikely related to nonacog beta pegol occurred and a total of 12 serious adverse 
events in 11 patients were reported in the completed trials, all of them considered unlikely related except 
one event of hypersensitivity. The patient experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction in the phase I trial fully 
recovered and was withdrawn from the study. It is known for FIX products that hypersensitivity reactions 
are possible and this is also reflected in section 4.4 of SmPC for Refixia. In addition, hypersensitivity has 
been added as an important identified risk in the RMP (please see section 3.6). 
In the ongoing PUP trial one patient had an anaphylactic reaction after the fourth exposure with nonacog 
beta  pegol.  Moreover,  the  patient  was  reported  to  have  high  responding  inhibitors  considered  to  be 
probably related by the investigator. The risk of anaphylaxis and the correlation between the occurrence 
of FIX inhibitors and allergic reactions is known for FIX products and is reflected in the section 4.4 and 4.8 
of the SmPC for Refixia. In addition, FIX inhibitors has been added as an important identified risk in the 
RMP (please see section 3.6). 
No thromboembolic events occurred during the completed or ongoing trials. Furthermore, data do not 
indicate that nonacog beta pegol treatment has an adverse effect on laboratory parameters. Because of 
the potential risk of thrombotic complications for FIX medicinal products, clinical surveillance for early 
signs of thrombotic and consumptive coagulopathy should be initiated with appropriate biological testing 
when administering this product to patients with liver disease, to patients post-operatively, to new-born 
infants, or to patients at risk of thrombotic phenomena or DIC. After repeated treatment with human 
coagulation factor IX (rDNA) products, patients should be monitored for the development of neutralising 
antibodies  (inhibitors)  that  should  be  quantified  in  Bethesda  Units  (BU)  using  appropriate  biological 
testing. Patients experiencing allergic reactions should be evaluated for the presence of an inhibitor. It 
should be noted that patients with factor IX inhibitors may be at an increased risk of anaphylaxis with 
subsequent challenge with factor IX. Because of the risk of allergic reactions with factor IX products, the 
initial administrations of factor IX should, according to the treating physician’s judgement, be performed 
under medical observation where proper medical care for allergic reactions could be provided. In case of 
residual  FIX  activity  levels,  there  is  a  risk  of  interference  when  performing  the  Nijmegen  modified 
Bethesda assay for inhibitor testing. Therefore a pre-heating step or a wash-out is recommended in order 
to ensure detection of low-titre inhibitors. This information has been added in section 4.4 of the SmPC for 
Refixia. In addition, thromboembolic events has been added as an important potential risk (please see 
section 3.6). 
During the extension phase of the paediatric trial patients were switched from trial product to commercial 
product. Due to the limited safety information from this ongoing trial (brief overview in the summary of 
clinical safety and CRFs and narratives for deaths serious adverse events and medical events of special 
interest) no conclusions about any possible new trend in the safety profile can be drawn. Moreover, only 
one paediatric patient was exposed to commercial product for more than 50 EDs. However, based on 
quality and preclinical data, the comparability of trial product and commercial product has been shown 
and no further clinical data are considered necessary for comparison of trial and commercial product.

Cellular vacuolation associated with PEG accumulation 
No treatment related cellular vacuolation has been seen in the non-clinical studies with nonacog beta 
pegol. However, in nonclinical studies with high doses of PEG alone, cellular vacuolation in certain tissues 
(choroid plexus of brain, macrophages in the interstium of the choroid plexus, red pulp of the spleen and 
mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes) was observed. This was explained by accumulation of 40K PEG, 
which is not easily broken down, appearing histologically as vacuoles. No adverse reactions associated 
with PEG accumulation were seen in the submitted clinical trials.  However, no long-term safety data are 
available (47 patients had ≥100 exposure days, 57 <100 EDs).  
Duration  of  treatment  with  nonacog  beta  pegol  would  be  life-long  and  it  is  to  be  expected  that 
unfavourable  effects  associated  with  potential  accumulation  of  PEG  would  only  be  detected  after 
long-term exposure over several years. It might be expected that e.g. renal failure or consequences of 
diminished function of the choroid plexus only occur after treatment for several years, manifesting with 
potentially unspecific signs and symptoms that develop insidiously over time. Additionally, it is currently 
unclear which clinical signs or symptoms could optimally serve as (early) markers for negative effects 
caused by accumulation of PEG in certain tissues/organs.  
Based on evidence presented in this dossier, a possible impact of potential accumulation of PEG in tissues 
on  clinical  safety  after  long-term  treatment  cannot  be  excluded  with  reasonable  certainty.  However, 
available safety data derived in clinical trials with nonacog beta pegol, although limited with regards to the 
number of patients, treatment duration and absence of specific monitoring for PEG-associated adverse 
events, do not reveal any signals hinting to negative effects of PEG accumulation. Moreover, there are a 
number  of  other  pegylated  medicinal  products  available  on  the  market.  Although  most  of  them  are 
intended for short-term treatment and those which can be administered chronically are only licensed for 
the  adult  population  (e.g.  Cimzia),  supporting  evidence  derives  from  the  safety  databases  of  these 
products  including  post  marketing  data.  To  date  there  are  no  safety  concerns  with  regards  to  PEG 
accumulation arising from clinical trials and post marketing data from these pegylated products, including 
pegylated products intended for the chronic treatment of adults. Therefore, a license for the treatment 
and prophylaxis of bleeding in haemophilia B patients with nonacog beta pegol can be granted for the 
adult population.  
In contrast, the paediatric population is considered more vulnerable and sensitive to potential detrimental 
effects of chronic administration of medicinal products due to the ongoing development of the brain and 
growth of the body. As the magnitude of clinical consequences of the preclinical findings regarding PEG 
accumulation in the choroid plexus and certain tissues/organs are unclear and no reassuring experience 
with long-term treatment with other licensed PEGylated products is available in this population, life-long 
treatment of nonacog beta pegol cannot be recommended for paediatric patients in general. The applicant 
has  proposed  a  licence  in  adolescent  patients  12  years  and  above  which  might  be  acceptable  for  the 
following  reasons:  Excluding  children  below  12  years  of  age  will  reduce  the  PEG  load  arising  from 
prophylactic  treatment  with  nonacog  beta  pegol  during  the  entire  childhood.  Moreover,  most 
neurodevelopmental milestones are reached in children 12 years of age. Therefore, the potential risks 
associated with PEG accumulation can be seen differently in children below or above 12 years of age. In 
consequence, the benefit risk balance has to be assessed separately for all age groups and an indication 
above 12 years of age can be granted.  
Finally, the CHMP is requesting the company to conduct an imposed study in order to investigate the 
potential effects of PEG accumulation I choroid plexus of  the brain and other tissues/organs. The MAH 
should conduct and submit the results of a study deriving from a registry of haemophilia B adults and 
adolescents (children above 12 years of age) patients according to an agreed protocol. In addition, the 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 137/154 
 
 
  
 
 
MAH  shall  submit  the  first  periodic  safety  update  report  for  this  product  within  6  months  following 
authorisation. 
Additional expert consultations on safety aspects 
An ad hoc expert group meeting was convened on 28 November 2016 and were asked to respond to the 
following questions as agreed by CHMP: 
Cellular  vacuolation  of  the  choroid  plexus  epithelial  cells  has  been  observed  in  non-clinical 
studies  with≥  40kDa  PEGylated  proteins.  Could  the  experts  discuss  the  relevance  of  these 
findings  and  if  possible  describe  potential  risks  if  such  accumulation  also  would  occur  in 
humans with special consideration of: 
• 
• 
prolonged (possibly life-long) treatment 
specific problems in children/adolescents 
With regards to vacuolation, it is not clear based on current knowledge what the translation to humans 
and actual clinical impact is. At present, there are not enough data (as no juvenile and chronic exposure 
studies have been conducted) to be able to conclude on the potential risks of PEG accumulation and asses 
the clinical impact and understand the long term toxicity of the product. Thus, detrimental effects cannot 
be excluded, especially in younger patients and in case of prolonged treatment. 
PEG is released for FIX and will stay in the circulation, hence we do not know if PEG is accumulating and 
will induce vacuolation. It was shown that PEG alone accumulates in cells. In addition, accumulation in 
macrophages was shown. The applicant investigated changes in cellular structure by histopathology and 
electron microscopy.  
The  experts  agreed  that  there  are  still  doubts  and  concerns  with  regards  to  the  potential  clinical 
consequences  of  PEG  accumulation  in  tissues/organs.  The  only  way  to  investigate  the  issue  properly 
would  be  to  conduct  a  comparative  randomised  clinical  trial,  which  would  probably  not  be  feasible. 
Whether this aspect can be addressed in the context of other evidence generation (e.g., registries) would 
have to be explored.  
How manageable could be a risk related to PEG accumulation in brain structures? Are there 
solutions to follow and monitor patients and to detect and/or to prevent or reverse adverse 
events related to PEG accumulation? 
There are no parameters  which could be used as a  marker of accumulation of PEG in tissues/organs. 
Possibly macrophages behaviour could be investigated and long-term clinical follow-up would be needed. 
No conclusions can be drawn at this stage with regards to the possibility of managing accumulation in 
brain structures and potential clinical consequences. In clinical practice, it may not be possible to conduct 
frequent MRIs unless clinically indicated. Due to these uncertainties, the clinical benefit of the treatment 
cannot be considered positive in children <12 years old. 
Is there any impact on kidney function expected if a 40 kDa PEGylated protein is used? How 
manageable (with regard to prevention and reversibility) are adverse events related to PEG 
accumulation in the kidney considered to be? 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 138/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
There  is  a  need  to  monitor  any  adverse  effects  on  renal  function  including  proximal  tubular  and 
glomerular  damage  using  sensitive  markers  (serum  creatinine  clearance  and  albuminuria  may  not  be 
sufficient,  especially  in  children,  for  early  detection  of  damage).  The  clinical  benefit  of  the  treatment 
cannot be considered positive in patients with renal failure or kidneys with renal dysfunction. 
Accumulation  in  spleen  could  also  take  place.  A  stronger  evidence  of  non-accumulation  should  be 
provided.  
In addition, in all patients, a short duration of treatment could be envisaged (based on the duration of 
follow-up for safety provided so far) until more long-term safety and efficacy data are available.  
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Please refer to the discussion above. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on data submitted within this dossier and clinical experience gained with other pegylated products, 
a license for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in haemophilia B patients with nonacog beta pegol 
can be granted for the adult population and paediatric patients 12 years of age and above.  
The CHMP considers the following imposed Post-Authorisation Safety Study necessary to address issues 
related to safety: 
In order to investigate the potential effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the brain and 
other tissues/organs, the MAH should conduct and submit the results of a study deriving from a registry 
of haemophilia B patients according to an agreed protocol. In addition, the MAH shall submit the first 
periodic safety update report for this product within 6 months following authorisation.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that nonacog beta pegol has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product 
in the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Refixia (nonacog beta pegol) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1st January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU, it has an imposed PASS and it has obligations for 
stricter recording/monitoring of suspected adverse drug reactions.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Haemophilia B is a rare bleeding disorder which is x-linked recessively inherited and affecting ~1 in 
20,000 of the male population worldwide (Konkle et al. 2000). The primary aim of care for patients with 
haemophilia B is to prevent bleeding which can successfully be managed with FIX replacement therapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current replacement therapy includes plasma-derived (pdFIX) as well as recombinant FIX (rFIX) 
products. These products are indicated for both the prophylactic and acute treatment of bleeding 
episodes, including bleeding in the perioperative setting. Half-life of both pdFIX and rFIX is ~18 hours. 
Prophylactic treatment with those products is usually required 2 to 3 times a week in order to achieve a 
significant reduction of bleeding episodes. Only recently, FIX products with a prolonged half-life have 
been licensed, which can be given once per week or even less often. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Four trials have been completed in previously treated adolescent and adult patients. The main phase of a 
trial in previously treated paediatric patients has also been completed, while the extension phase of this 
trial is ongoing. In addition, a trial in previously untreated patients is ongoing. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the pivotal trial 3747, prophylaxis patients were randomised to a dose of 10 IU/kg or 40 IU/kg once 
weekly. The mean bleeding rates based on observed data (4.56 and 2.51 in the 10 IU/kg arm and 40 
IU/kg, respectively) confirm the beneficial effect of prophylaxis with nonacog beta pegol. A substantially 
higher proportion of subjects on the high prophylactic dose than on the low dose did not experience any 
bleeding event during the course of the trial, i.e. 13/29 (44.8%) vs. 5/30 (16.6%). In addition, a 
considerably higher number of subjects on the high prophylactic dose vs. the lower dose did not 
experience bleeds into the target joints [10/15 (66.7%) vs. 1/13 (7.7%)]. For comparison, in the on 
demand arm, 2/12 - 16.6% of subjects had no bleed into their target joint. 
In the paediatric population of trial 3774 the mean annualized bleeding rate was 0.83 in the <6 years of 
age cohort, 1.96 in the 6 to <12 years of age cohort, and 1.42 in the total of both age cohorts. The 
prophylactic dose administered was 40 IU/kg once weekly in both age cohorts. 
Regarding the efficacy in the treatment of bleeding events in the pivotal trial 3747, in 92.2% of bleeding 
episodes the response to nonacog beta pegol was rated as excellent or good. 87% were controlled by 1 
injection and 10.4% by 2 injections. The median amount of nonacog beta pegol needed for the treatment 
of a bleed was ~ 42 IU/kg. In 92.9% of bleeding episodes in the overall paediatric population of trial 3774 
the response to nonacog beta pegol was rated as excellent or good, with 90.9% for younger and 93.5% 
for older children. Overall, 85.7% were controlled by 1 injection (81.8% in younger and 87.1% in older 
children) and 11.9% by 2 injections (9.1% and 12.9%). The median amount of nonacog beta pegol 
needed for the treatment of a bleed was ~ 43 IU/kg in both age cohorts.  
Trough levels at steady state in the prophylactic arms of the pivotal trial 3747 were estimated in the 10 
IU/kg arm at 0.085 IU/mL (95% CI 0.077; 0.093) and at 0.273 IU/mL (95% CI 0.248; 0.300) in the 40 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 143/154 
 
 
  
 
 
IU/kg dose arm. The estimated mean steady state FIX trough levels were 0.154 IU/mL for the 0–6 years 
age group and 0.190 IU/mL for the 7–12 years age group in trial 3774. These levels are considerably 
higher than those commonly achieved with unmodified FIX products (~1-3%, i.e 0.01-0.03 IU/mL). 
Outcomes from the extension trial 3775 in PTPs >12, where 71 subjects were treated for an additional 
year with the same modality as in the pivotal trial were in line with data from trial 3747 and confirm that 
the haemostatic and prophylactic efficacy after prolonged administration of nonacog beta pegol is 
sustained. 
The guideline requirement to submit data of a minimum of 5 patients undergoing at least 10 surgical 
procedures (comprising major surgeries) is exceeded. In the dedicated surgery trial 3773 the efficacy of 
nonacog beta pegol during surgery was investigated through 13 major surgical procedures in 13 subjects. 
Additionally, in the extension trial 14 patients underwent 24 surgical procedures, of which 3 were rated as 
major. For the vast majority of evaluable surgeries haemostatic efficacy was assessed as excellent or 
good by the surgeon or investigator. The pre-operative dose given in the clinical trial was a single bolus 
injection of 80 IU/kg 15 minutes to 4 hours prior to the surgery and is the one recommended in section 
4.2 of the SmPC. If needed, the dose level of nonacog beta pegol can be adjusted to aim for a FIX activity 
level of approximately 1.0 IU/mL and maintained during surgery according to WFH guidelines. After the 
pre-operative dose, the recommended dose is 40 IU/kg approximately 48-72 hours.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Residual FIX activity at 168 hours of up to 40% indicates that longer dosing intervals or lower doses could 
easily have been envisaged for nonacog beta pegol prophylactic treatment. Unusually high trough levels 
as well as accumulation were observed for the 40 IU/kg once weekly dose at steady state in the pivotal 
trial. The provided PK results also do not seem to fully support a prophylactic dose of 40 IU/kg once 
weekly as the only possible or worthwhile prophylactic treatment regimen. It is therefore considered 
unfortunate that the applicant did not investigate alternative promising dosing regimens (e.g. in PK trial 
3639 a dose of 25 IU/kg was tested), considering that the prophylactic dosing with 10 IU/kg once weekly 
produces adequate trough levels. However, it is acknowledged that the higher dose resulted in 
numerically improved bleeding rates with a noticeable reduction of spontaneous bleeds and bleeding 
events into target joints in the pivotal trial 3747. Hence, the following recommendation was made in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC: “Adjustments of doses and administration intervals may be considered based on 
achieved FIX levels and individual bleeding tendency”. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The nature and frequency of the reported adverse events during clinical trials did not reveal unexpected 
safety signals. A total of 645 adverse events were reported in 98 (85.2%) patients. Most of the adverse 
events were of mild severity and considered unrelated to nonacog beta pegol.  
In the phase I trial one patient experienced an event of hypersensitivity considered related to nonacog 
beta pegol. It is known for FIX products that hypersensitivity reactions are possible and this is reflected in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC for Refixia. In addition, Refixia is contraindicated in patients with known allergic 
reaction to hamster protein (please see section 4.3 of the SmPC). 
In the ongoing PUP trial one patient had an anaphylactic reaction after the fourth exposure with nonacog 
beta pegol. Moreover, the patient was reported to have high responding inhibitors considered to be 
probably related by the investigator. The risk of anaphylaxis and the correlation between the occurrence 
of FIX inhibitors and allergic reactions is known for FIX products and is reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of 
the SmPC for Refixia. No thromboembolic events were reported during the trials. 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 144/154 
 
 
  
 
 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
37 adverse events in 23 patients were considered possibly or probably related to nonacog beta pegol by 
the investigator but most of these adverse events were considered unlikely related by the applicant. The 
justification of the different evaluation of relationship could not be followed in all cases and consequently 
the tabulated list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC was updated with those AEs where a 
reasonable causality cannot be excluded.  
No treatment related vacuolation has been seen in the non-clinical studies with nonacog beta pegol. 
However, in nonclinical studies with PEG alone cellular vacuolation due to accumulation of 40 kDa PEG in 
certain tissues (choroid plexus of brain, macrophages in the interstitium of the choroid plexus, red pulp of 
the spleen and mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes) in monkeys and rats observed at doses 200-500 
fold higher (rats) or 200 fold higher (Cynomolgus monkey) than the PEG load resulting from the 
recommended clinical dose. Although no neurological symptoms (e.g. tremor) occurred in the clinical 
studies, accumulation of PEG with possible long-term consequences poses a conceivable risk. Hence, the 
observed non-clinical effects of the PEG moiety of the molecule are of unknown clinical relevance. It is to 
be expected that unfavourable effects associated with accumulation of PEG would only be detected after 
long-term exposure over years.  
Due to the rareness of the disease the safety database is relatively small although in principle in line with 
guideline requirements. However, these requirements pertain primarily to unmodified factor IX products, 
where additional safety issues to those already identified for plasma derived or recombinant coagulation 
factors are not an issue. In the clinical development programme, 48 patients had ≥100 exposure days 
and 57 <100 EDs. Unfortunately, the extension study in 71 PTPs > 12 years of age had to be closed after 
one year as insufficient clinical trial material could be provided. 
The clinical trial programme was not prospectively designed to investigate possible clinical effects of PEG 
accumulation on the function of presumed main target organs. Accumulation of PEG after long-term 
treatment has been added as an identified potential risk in the RMP (see section 3.6). The database for 
nonacog beta pegol will be expanded by data gathered in the ongoing studies (extension phase of 
paediatric trial 3774 and PUP study 3895). In addition, the MAH will have to submit the results of an 
imposed PASS in order to investigate the possible effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid plexus of the 
brain and other tissues and organs. Finally, the MAH shall submit the first periodic safety update report for 
this product within 6 months following authorisation.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Maintaining physiological levels of FIX is expected to be associated with relevant clinical outcomes. Based 
on the clinical data presented, Refixia 40 IU/kg once weekly was able to sustain FIX levels in normal range 
(> 40%) for 5.4 days/week, which is promising and could translate into less target joints and thus a 
better preservation of musculoskeletal function over time. In order to allow individualised treatment, the 
following recommendation has been added in section 4.2 of the SmPC: “Adjustments of doses and 
administration intervals may be considered based on achieved FIX levels and individual bleeding 
tendency.” Treatment with Refixia was associated with improved quality of life with just a single infusion 
per week.  
A total of 645 adverse events were reported in 98 (85.2%) patients. The most common side effects are 
nausea, pruritus, fatigue and injection site reactions. Most of the adverse events were of mild severity and 
considered unrelated to nonacog beta pegol. The nature and frequency of adverse events does not give 
rise to concern and do not reveal unexpected safety signals.  
Based on evidence presented in this dossier, a possible impact of accumulation of PEG on function of 
affected tissues/organs after long-term treatment cannot be excluded with reasonable certainty. 
However, available safety data derived in clinical trials with nonacog beta pegol, although limited with 
regards to the number of patients, treatment duration and absence of specific monitoring for 
PEG-associated adverse events, do not reveal any signals hinting to negative effects of PEG accumulation. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Pertaining to the preclinical and clinical data, the beneficial effects of nonacog beta pegol with regard to 
its ability to replace functional factor IX and thus to prevent and treat bleeding events and to allow major 
surgery in patients with severe haemophilia have been satisfactorily shown at an improved treatment 
interval compared to conventional FIX products. Furthermore, trough levels in the range of mild 
haemophilia or even healthy subjects can be reached throughout the majority of the treatment interval 
EMA/346525/2017  
Page 147/154 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which may be a specific advantage of Refixia as this is likely to have a beneficial impact on target joints, 
preserve joint function and leads to less morbidity and orthopaedic long-term consequences.  
The provided safety data did not give rise to concern with regard to the short-term treatment of patients 
(48 patients had ≥100 exposure days, 57 <100 EDs). However, unfavourable effects associated with 
accumulation of PEG in the choroid plexus or other tissues or impairment of neural development might 
only become symptomatic after long-term exposure over several years. Hence, the CHMP has imposed to 
the MAH to conduct and submit the results of a PASS deriving from a registry of Haemophilia B patients 
(adults and adolescents) in order to investigate the possible effects of PEG accumulation in the choroid 
plexus of the brain and other tissues and organs. In addition, the MAH shall submit the first periodic safety 
update report for this product within 6 months following authorisation. 
Based on the data from clinical trials with nonacog beta pegol and safety data of licensed pegylated 
products for chronic use in the adult population, approval for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in 
haemophilia B patients with nonacog beta pegol can be granted for the adult population.  
No supportive safety data from other pegylated products intended for chronic use are available for the 
paediatric population. Therefore, the indication in the entire paediatric population cannot be granted. 
With regards to children below 12 years, at present there is not enough data to conclude and the company 
should provide additional efficacy and safety data with special considerations on dosing intervals and 
dosing regimen showing efficacy with even lesser injections. However, the benefit-risk balance has to be 
seen differently in adolescents compared to children below 12 years of age. Most neurodevelopmental 
milestones are reached in children below 12 years of age. Moreover, according to literature the treatment 
compliance generally declines when patients pass from childhood to adolescence. Prophylactic treatment 
with Refixia in adolescents with just a single infusion per week may lead to improved treatment 
compliance, could reduce bleeding rates and improve joint health in this patient population and could 
allow an improved quality of life, thereby outweighing the risks/uncertainties in relation to potential PEG 
accumulation. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Refixia is positive. 
Divergent positions are appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Refixia is not similar to Alprolix and Idelvion within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Refixia is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients 12 years and above with haemophilia B (congenital 
factor IX deficiency).  
EMA/346525/2017

Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that nonacog beta pegol is 
considered to be a new active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0329/2014 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 23 March 2017  
Product name EMEA/H/C/004178 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of the marketing authorisation of Refixia indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding 
in  patients  12  years  and  above  with  haemophilia  B  (congenital  factor  IX  deficiency).  Refixia  was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product on 15 May 2009. The applicant for this medicinal product is 
Novo Nordisk A/S. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
It is acknowledged that Refixia provides clinical benefits in terms of correction of haemostasis, by showing 
a better compliance to the treatment and a better quality of life, due to the fact that Refixia permits once 
weekly administration, due to its long lasting effect. Nonetheless, the dosing foreseen by the Applicant is 
40IU/kg/week, for all age group. This dosing yields trough levels of FIX around 40%. Such trough levels 
do not seem necessary to treat the disease. It is problematic that no clinical trials have been carried out 
to test/assess different posologies e.g. extended interval dosing regimens (i.e. every ten days or more), 
in order to demonstrate that lower trough levels were sufficient to obtain acceptable annualised bleeding 
rate  (ABR).  In  these  conditions,  Refixia  could  have  demonstrated  a  real  benefit,  compared  to  others 
recombinant long-lasting FIX. It is acknowledged that Refixia has been well tolerated during clinical trials, 
with  a  similar  safety  profile  compared  to  other  recombinant  FIX.  This  level  of  exposure  obtained  in 
patients does not raise any concern as regards the clinical benefit, with the exception to the risk discussed 
below. 
Despite the uncertainties related to the observations seen in the non-clinical studies (PEG accumulation in 
the choroid plexus in rats and monkeys), no specific safety issue was observed in human clinical trials 
with Refixia. No central nervous system related toxicity or any clear other organ issue has been detected. 
However, this absence of signals, on a short period of follow-up, with a limited number of patients, does 
not preclude a potential long-term toxicity, which could occur long after the termination of the treatment 
with Refixia considering that the elimination of PEG from the choroid plexus is not fully characterised. The 
limited clinical experience acquired during three years of exposure with Refixia does not allow concluding 
on a positive Benefit-Risk for the following reasons: 
- Delayed effects can occur after 3 years of dosing, even without signals reported during the monitoring 
of the patients included in the clinical trials,  
-  The  duration  of  the  follow-up  of  patients  in  studies  3747  and  3775  was  not  sufficient  to  detect  the 
possible delayed PEG accumulation-related effects,  
Even  though  this  risk  cannot  be  differentiated  between  different  age  groups,  young  children  may 
represent a particularly sensitive population considering the potential impact on the developing CNS. As 
a conclusion, irrespective of the age group, the risks outlined above outweigh the benefits. At this stage 
of the procedure, the benefit /risk ratio is still highly uncertain, and thus no marketing authorization can 
be granted in any population.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 23 March 2017  
Product name EMEA/H/C/004178 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of the marketing authorisation of Refixia indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding 
in patients 12 years to 18 years of age with haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency). Refixia was 
designated as an orphan medicinal product on 15 May 2009. The applicant for this medicinal product is 
Novo Nordisk A/S. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
The risks outlined above outweigh the benefits in adolescents (children > 12 years of age) considering the 
potential safety impact of a chronic treatment.  
At  this  stage  of  the  procedure,  the  benefit  /risk  ratio  is  still  highly  uncertain,  and  no  marketing 
authorisation can be granted in the entire paediatric population.

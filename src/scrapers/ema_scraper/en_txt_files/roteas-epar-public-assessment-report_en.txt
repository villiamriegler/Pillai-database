1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Daiichi  Sankyo  Europe  GmbH  submitted  on  10  August  2016  an  application  for  marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Roteas, through the centralised procedure under 
Article 3(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon 
by the EMA/CHMP on 19 November 2015.  
The applicant applied for the following indications:  
- 
- 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes 
mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).  
Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article  10(c)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  –  relating  to  informed  consent  from  a  marketing  authorisation  holder 
for an authorised medicinal product. 
The  application  submitted  is  composed  of  administrative  information  quality,  non-clinical  and  clinical  data 
with a letter from Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH allowing the cross reference to relevant quality, non-clinical 
and/or clinical data. 
The  applicant  has  addressed  the  request  to  provide  the  EC  agreement  for  the  duplicate  Marketing 
authorisation  application  (MAA)  required  by  Article  82(1)  of  the  regulation,  by  providing  the  EC  letter  of 
acceptance, dated 23 January 2017. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Not applicable. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  141/2000  and  Article  3  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No 
847/2000,  the  applicant  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with  authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication. 
This application is submitted as a multiple of Lixiana, authorised on 19 June 2015 in accordance with Article 
82.1 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This  application  has  been  submitted  as  an  informed  consent  application  in  accordance  with  Article  10c  of 
Directive  2001/83/EC  as  amended.  The  marketing  authorisation  holder  (MAH)  of  the  reference  product, 
Lixiana,  has  provided  consent  to  allow  access  to  Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  and  any 
subsequent post-marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. 
The  reference  product,  Lixiana  had  been  submitted  as  a  full  application  under  Art  8(3)  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC.  As  a  consequence,  the  quality,  safety  and  efficacy  of  Roteas  are  identical  to  the  up  to  date 
quality, safety and efficacy profile of Lixiana. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Atrial  fibrillation  (AF)  represents  the  most  common  sustained  cardiac  rhythm  disorder.  AF,  particularly 
when  it  is  persistent/permanent,  predisposes  patients  to  the  development  of  atrial  thrombi,  which  may 
embolize to the systemic circulation.  
Vitamin  K  antagonists  ([VKAs];  coumarins,  like  warfarin  and  acenocoumarol)  have  been  the  only  oral 
anticoagulants available over the last 60 years. These agents are effective to prevent stroke in patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/158410/2017 
Page 5/13 
  
  
 
AF, but their management remains problematic due to their narrow therapeutic index and variability in drug 
exposure,  necessitating  routine  coagulation  monitoring,  clinical  surveillance,  and  continuous  patient 
education1. Such monitoring is inconvenient for patients and medical staff, and costly for healthcare payers. 
As a result, approximately only half of eligible patients with AF receive oral anticoagulation with VKA.  
Venous  thromboembolism  (VTE),  encompassing  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  and  pulmonary  embolism 
(PE), is the third leading mortality cause due to circulatory diseases, only behind of myocardial infarction and 
stroke.  
Current guidelines recommend treating patients with acute VTE with an oral VKA for at least 3 months2. As 
VKA  have  a  slow  onset  of  action,  overlapping  with  a  parenteral  anticoagulant  [e.g.:  low  molecular  weight 
heparin  (LMWH)  or  unfractionated  heparin  (UFH)]  is  needed  for  the  initial  5–10  days  of  acute  VTE,  until 
appropriate anticoagulation with VKA is achieved [i.e.: international normalized ratio (INR) between 2.0 and 
3.0].  LMWH are effective and safe also for the long-term treatment of VTE. However, they still require daily 
parenteral  subcutaneous  (SC)  administration,  which  may  be  problematic  for  many  patients.  On  the  other 
hand, the VKA have several limitations, as mentioned in previous paragraph.   
Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are currently available in the European Union (EU) and other regions for 
several  indications,  including  prevention  of  stroke/systemic  embolic  events  (SEE)  in  nonvalvular  atrial 
fibrillation  (NVAF)  and/or  treatment  of  VTE:  the  direct  thrombin  inhibitor  dabigatran  (as  etexilate)  and  the 
direct  factor  Xa  inhibitors  rivaroxaban  and  apixaban.  The  pivotal  studies  conducted  with  the  DOACs  in 
prevention of stroke/SEE in NVAF or treatment of VTE were mainly large non-inferiority event-driven clinical 
trials  recruiting  heterogeneous  populations  in  different  geographic  regions  and  with  different  quality  of  oral 
anticoagulation with warfarin. The potential influence of differences in clinical, geographic factors and quality 
of oral anticoagulation across studies on the relative efficacy and safety of the DOACs, as well as the clinical 
relevance of these differences, may be significant, particularly in NVAF indication3. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
AF  affects  approximately  4.5  million  adults  in  the  EU  and  about  2.3  million  adults  in  the  United  States  of 
America  (USA).  Over  the  past  three  decades,  the  incidence  of  AF  has  been  increasing.  The  variability  and 
uncertainty about the incidence and prevalence of AF is in part related to case definitions and/or inclusion of 
different  types  of  AF  (permanent,  paroxysmal,  related  to  other  particular  underlying  pathologies).  Older 
studies tended to include only patients with permanent AF. The lifetime risk of developing AF is about 25% 
among  those  who  have  reached  the  age  of  40  years.  Prevalence  of  AF  has  increased  over  time  and  is 
projected  to  increase  further  in  the  next  50  years.  In  a  recent  pooled  analysis  of  published  studies,  AF 
prevalence was estimated at 2.8%. The incidence and prevalence of AF increase with age. Using data from 4 
large prospective population-based studies (USA, Australia, European studies) and the USA census data, the 
median  age  of  patients  with  AF  is  estimated  to  be  about  75  years,  and  an  estimated  70%  of  patients  fall 
between  the  ages  of  65  to  85  years.  In  international  (UK,  Iceland,  France,  and  Sweden)  large  population 
studies,  prevalence  was  higher  in  men  than  in  women.  In  a  recent  pooled  analysis  of  published  studies,  AF 
prevalence was estimated at 3.3% in men and 2.4% in women. In a prospective cohort study in USA, the risk 
of AF was 45% lower in Blacks compared to Whites. In a cross-sectional study (in UK), the prevalence of AF 
was 1.4% in African-Caribbeans and 0.7 % in South Asians.

The  following  risk  factors  for  AF  have  been  identified:  increasing  age,  hypertension,  symptomatic  heart 
failure, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, atrial septal defect, other congenital heart defects, coronary 
heart  disease,  hyperthyroidism,  obesity,  diabetes  mellitus,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD), 
sleep apnoea, chronic renal disease.  
AF is an important marker of future morbidity with major consequences for the healthcare delivery systems 
and  imposes  substantial  burden  on  increased  morbidity  and  mortality-associated  therapeutic  interventions. 
Patients were hospitalized more frequently, for longer durations with more visits to specialists as opposed to 
general  physicians.  Death  rates  are  doubled  by  AF,  independently  of  other  known  predictors  of  mortality. 
Only  antithrombotic  treatment  has  been  shown  to  reduce  AF-related  deaths.  In  an  international  study 
(Observational Euro Heart Survey (n = 3182)) with one year follow-up, all-cause mortality was 5.3% (3.5% 
for paroxysymal AF, 3.0% for persistent AF and 8.2% for permanent AF). The mean age of the patients with 
paroxysymal AF, persistent AF and permanent AF at baseline were 64, 66 and 71 years, respectively. 
There  are  several  known  risk  factors  that  can  be  attributed  to  the  development  of  AF  and  constitute 
important  comorbidities  for  AF.  Concomitant  medical  conditions  play  a  role  in  the  perpetuation  of  AF.  The 
prevalence  of  these  comorbidities  is  much  higher  in  patients  with  AF  than  in  patients  without.  AF  is  an 
independent risk factor for stroke which increases a patient’s risk of stroke 4- to 5- fold.  
DVT and PE are considered to be manifestations of a single pathophysiological process collectively referred 
to  as  VTE.  DVT  and  PE  often  present  together,  share  the  same  risk  factors,  and  are  associated  with  high 
morbidity  that  may  progress  to  a  fatal  outcome  if  left  untreated.  VTE  is  the  third  most  common 
cardiovascular  illness  after  acute  coronary  syndrome  and  stroke.  The  reported  incidence of  VTE  vary  widely 
due  to  differences  in  the  study  populations,  the  coding  or  classification  of  the  diagnoses  and  the  settings 
under  which  VTE  are  diagnosed  (eg,  hospital,  outpatient  clinics  etc.)  and  study  methodologies.  Many  of  the 
large epidemiology studies on VTE in European countries reported the cumulative incidence or incidence rate 
of VTE rather than prevalence data. The incidence of VTE steadily increases with age, and particularly  after 
age 40 years. No consistent differences in the incidence of VTE among men and women have been observed. 
Risk of recurrence may be higher in men than in women. A few studies showed 2-4 fold lower risk of VTE in 
Asian and Hispanic population than in Caucasians. 
The  following  temporary  risk  factors  for  VTE  have  been  identified:  surgery,  trauma,  pregnancy  and  post-
partum period, prolonged immobilization and use of female hormones. Other risk factors include age, cancer 
and  chemotherapy,  cardiovascular  diseases  such  as  myocardial  infarction  (MI),  congestive  heart  failure 
(CHF),  COPD,  obesity,  cigarette  smoking,  central  vein  catheterization  or  transvenous  pacemaker,  prior 
superficial vein thrombosis, thrombophilia. 
Studies in Europe report that the total number of symptomatic VTE events per annum across the 6 countries 
was estimated to be 761697 nonfatal VTE events and 399808 associated complications. Early mortality after 
VTE  is  strongly  associated  with  presentation  as  PE,  advanced  age,  cancer,  and  underlying  cardiovascular 
disease. Survival after PE is much worse than after DVT alone. 
Compared with the AF population, patients presenting with VTE arise from diverse populations. Patients with 
short-term  increased  risk  of  thromboembolic  events  (such  as  preoperatively  or  during  significant  periods  of 
immobilization)  will  have  different  concomitant  medications  from  patients  with  chronic  comorbid  conditions. 
For patients with chronic comorbid conditions, complex polypharmacy is frequent and complicates individual 
patient  management.  Patients  with  COPD,  renal  disease  and  impairment  with  consequent  anaemia,  lead  to 
potentially complex multifactorial ongoing treatment.

Comorbidities that the AF population and the VTE population have in common are stroke/TIA, coronary artery 
disease/MI, CHF, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, COPD, and renal failure, albeit their incidence, 
prevalence and mortality/morbidity typically differ. Malignancy is an associated risk factor for VTE but not for 
AF. 
About the product 
Edoxaban  is  an  orally  active,  selective,  direct,  reversible  inhibitor  of the  coagulation  factor  Xa  (FXa).  Factor 
Xa plays a pivotal role in the coagulation cascade because it sits at the junction of the intrinsic and extrinsic 
pathways of the coagulation system. Inhibition of FXa is exerting anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects by 
decreasing  the  conversion  of  prothrombin  to  active  thrombin,  thereby  diminishing  thrombin-mediated 
activation of the coagulation process, including fibrin formation and platelet activation. 
At the time of submission of the current application, edoxaban was approved in Japan, Switzerland, European 
Union, Hong Kong, Korea, and Turkey for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in non-valvular atrial 
fibrillation (NVAF) as well as the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and 
prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. 
In the United States and Taiwan, edoxaban was approved for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in 
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), for treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism 
(PE). 
In Japan, edoxaban was also approved for VTE prophylaxis following orthopedic surgery. 
The CHMP granted the positive opinion for Roteas, for the following indications: 
• 
• 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes 
mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). 
Treatment  of  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  and  pulmonary  embolism  (PE),  and  prevention  of  recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients). 
For the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism, the recommended dose is 60 mg Roteas once daily. For 
the  treatment  of  VTE  including  DVT  and  PE,  and  prevention  of  recurrent  VTE,  the  recommended  dose  is  60 
mg  Roteas  once  daily  following  initial  use  of  heparin.  For  NVAF  and  VTE  the  recommended  dose  is  30  mg 
Roteas once daily in patients with one or more of the following clinical factors: a) moderate or severe renal 
impairment  (creatinine  clearance:  15-50  ml/min);  b)  low  body  weight  ≤60  kg;  c)  concomitant  use  of  the 
following  P-glycoprotein  (P-gp)  inhibitors:  ciclosporine,  dronedarone,  erythromycin,  ketoconazole,  quinidine, 
or verapamil. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Lixiana,  the  quality  data  in  support  of  the  Roteas 
application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date quality  data  of  the  Lixiana  dossier, which  has  been  assessed  and 
approved (including all post-marketing procedures).

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Roteas is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. Module 4 of 
Roteas  dossier  cross-refers  to  the  up-to-date  module  4  of  Lixiana  which  has  been  assessed  and  approved 
(including all post-marketing procedures). No additional non-clinical data have been submitted. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Roteas is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. Module 1.6 
of  Roteas  dossier  cross-refers  to  the  up-to-date  Module  1.6  of  Lixiana  authorised  previously.  This  was 
considered acceptable.  
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In  this  informed  consent  application,  there  are  no  new  issues  related  to  the  non-clinical  data.  All  the  non-
clinical  data  have  been  assessed  in  the  application  for  reference  medicinal  product,  Lixiana  and  adequately 
reflected in the Product Information (PI). 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Roteas is submitted under an informed consent application, article 10(c) of directive 2001/83/EC. Module 5 of 
Roteas  dossier  cross-refers  to  the  up-to-date  module  5  of  the  dossier  of  Lixiana.  No  additional  clinical  data 
have been submitted. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical aspects 
In this informed consent application, there are no new issues related to the clinical data. All the clinical data 
have been assessed within Lixiana application and adequately reflected in the PI. 
2.5.  Risk Management Plan 
The  MAH  has  submitted  a  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  dated  January  2017  based  on  originator  licence 
Lixiana  RMP  Version  number  6.0,  which  is  the  currently  approved  version.  The  MAH  has  addressed  the 
request to confirm that the safety specification in the proposed RMP is in line with that of the last approved 
RMP  for  Lixiana  and  to  ensure  that  the  corrected  invented  name  (Roteas)  is  presented  throughout  the 
proposed RMP.

2.6.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.  New Active Substance 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers that edoxaban is not a new active substance, as it is a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. Edoxaban is contained in 
Lixiana, which was authorised in the European Union on 19 June 2015. 
2.8.  Product information 
Roteas  is  submitted  under  an  informed  consent  application,  article  10(c)  of  directive  2001/83/EC.  PI  of  the 
present  dossier  cross-refers  to  the  up-to-date  PI  of  Lixiana,  which  has  been  assessed  and  authorised,  with 
the logical changes in the medicinal product specific data (i.e.: invented name). The PI for Roteas 15 mg, 30 
mg and 60 mg film-coated tablets is therefore identical to the one of Lixiana 15 mg, 30 mg and 60 mg film-
coated tablets, with the only exception of the invented name of the medicinal product.  
The (invented) name of the medicinal product followed by its strength expressed in Braille format is included 
in the proposed labelling and mock-ups for the cartons. 
The  applicant  has  addressed  the  request  to  confirm  that  the  Patient  information  leaflet  for  Roteas  will  be 
identical in design and layout to the one of Lixiana. 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The  applicant  has  submitted  a  document  justifying  that  as  Roteas  is  an  informed  consent  application,  the 
User  Testing  performed  for  Lixiana  that  has  been  reviewed  in  the  original  MAA  is  relevant  for  the  current 
initial  MAA.  There  are  no  significant  changes  for  the  proposed  patient  leaflet.  Therefore,  the  company´s 
justification to not undertake further consultation with target patient groups is considered acceptable. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Roteas is included in the additional monitoring list 
as it contains an active substance (edoxaban) which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore  the  summary  of  product  characteristics  and  the  package  leaflet  includes  a  statement  that  this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This  Marketing  Authorisation  application  for  Roteas has  been  submitted by  Daiichi  Sankyo  Europe  GmbH  as 
an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10(c) of Directive 2011/83/EC, as amended. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the Roteas medicinal product are identical to the up-to-date 
quality, non-clinical and clinical profile of Lixiana. The application for Roteas concerns the identical strengths 
to those approved for Lixiana and consists of only Module 1. Information on the scientific discussion can be 
found in Lixiana European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) published on the EMA website. 
Consequentially,  and  in  line  with  the  assessment  of  data  undertaken  in  the  framework  of  the  Lixiana  initial 
marketing  authorisation  application  as  well  as  within  all  post-authorisation  procedures,  the  CHMP  considers 
that the benefit/risk balance for Roteas is positive.

Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Roteas is favourable in the following indications: 
• 
• 
Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) 
with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes 
mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). 
Treatment  of  deep  vein  thrombosis  (DVT)  and  pulmonary  embolism  (PE),  and  prevention  of  recurrent 
DVT and PE in adults (see section 4.4 for haemodynamically unstable PE patients). 
The  CHMP  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation  subject  to  the  following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The  MAH  shall  perform  the  required  pharmacovigilance  activities  and  interventions  detailed  in  the  agreed 
RMP  presented  in  Module  1.8.2  of  the  marketing  authorisation  and  any  agreed  subsequent  updates  of  the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever  the  risk  management  system  is  modified,  especially  as  the  result  of  new  information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If the submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted at the same time.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior  to  launch  of  Roteas  in  each  Member  State,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  must  agree  the 
content  and  format  of  the  educational  programme,  including  communication  media,  distribution  modalities, 
and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority.  
The  educational  programme  is  aimed  at  mitigating  the  risk  of  serious  bleeds  or  haemorrhage  in  patients 
treated  with  Roteas  by  ensuring  prescriber  awareness  and  providing  guidance  on  appropriate  patient 
selection, correct dosing as well as management of the risk. 
The  programme  is  also  aimed  at  ensuring  that  the  healthcare  professionals  who  intend  to  prescribe  Roteas 
are aware of the Patient alert card and that the card is to be given to and reviewed with all patients treated 
with Roteas.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State where Roteas is marketed, all healthcare professionals who 
are expected to use Roteas are provided with the following educational material: 
• 
• 
• 
The Summary of Product Characteristics 
Prescriber Guide for healthcare professionals 
Patient alert card 
The Prescriber Guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements: 
•  Relevant information on the risk of bleeding 
•  Details of the population potentially at higher risk of bleeding 
•  Contraindications 
•  Recommendations for dose adjustment in at risk populations, including patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment, low body weight and concomitant use of some P-gp inhibitors 
•  Guidance on switching from or to Roteas treatment 
•  Guidance regarding surgery or invasive procedure, and temporary discontinuation 
•  Management of overdose situations and haemorrhage 
•  Use of coagulation tests and their interpretation 
• 
That all patients should be provided with a Patient alert card and be counselled about: 
  The signs or symptoms of bleeding and when to seek attention from a healthcare provider 
 
  Necessity to carry the Patient alert card with them at all times

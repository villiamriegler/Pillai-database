INTRODUCTION 
On  3  October  2008,  the  MAH  submitted  the  clinical  overview  and  report  on  study  PACTG 
Protocol  1052  for  Ziagen  (Abacavir  pharmacokinetics  during  chronic  therapy  in  HIV-
infected  adolescent  and  young  adults),  in  accordance  with  Article  45  of  the  Regulation 
(EC)No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use. 
Study PACTG P1052 was a phase I, open-label, age-stratified pharmacokinetic study of a single 
oral  300  mg  dose  of  abacavir  administered  to  HIV-infected  adolescents  aged  ≥  13  to  <18 
(stratum 1) and young adults aged ≥ 18 to < 25 years (stratum 2). 
The  MAH  has  reviewed  the  results  of  this  study  and  has  concluded  that  they  are  in 
accordance  with  the  approved  Global  Data  Sheet  and  that  no  changes  to  the  Product 
Information are considered necessary. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
Clinical aspects 
1. 
Introduction 
As  a  reminder,  Ziagen  is  indicated  in  adults  and  children  from  3  months  of  age.  The 
recommended dose in children aged 12 years and more is the adult dose i.e. 600 mg daily given 
as 300 mg BID or 600 mg QD. 
For children less than 12 years, a dosing according to weight bands is recommended for Ziagen 
tablets  and  a  dosing  of  8  mg/kg  BID  (up  to  a  maximum  of  600  mg  daily)  is  recommended  for 
Ziagen oral solution. 
Results  from  a  previous  study  PACTG  P1018  (a  single  dose  PK  study  of  an  8  mg/kg  dose  in 
children and adolescents 9 to <19 years of age) showed that the PK parameters in adolescents 
were more similar to children than to adults, indicating that using a 300 mg dose in adolescents 
may results in under-dosing. 
Study  PACTG  P1052  was  designed  to  address  the  question  whether  adolescents  and  young 
adults being given adult doses were achieving adequate plasma concentrations.

Clinical study(ies) 
(cid:1)  Description 
Study PACTG P1052 was a phase I, open-label, age-stratified pharmacokinetic study of a single 
oral  300  mg  dose  of  abacavir  administered  to  HIV-infected  adolescents  aged  ≥  13  to  <18 
(stratum 1) and young adults aged ≥ 18 to < 25 years (stratum 2).

Primary objective:

the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

To  determine  ABC  PK  parameters  in  a  cohort  of  HIV-1  infected  adolescents  and  young  adults 
receiving  the  current  recommended  dose  for  comparison  with  previously  published  data  for 
young children and adults 
Secondary objective: 
To  examine  the  possible  relationships  between  subject  characteristics  (age,  body  size, 
race/ethnicity and gender) and ABC PK parameters (oral clearance, AUC and half-life). 
•  Study design 
Open-label, single-dose, PK study. 
Enrolment was stratified by age (> 13 to <18 years and > 18 to < 25 years). 
•  Study population /Sample size 
Patients who had participated in P1018 were not eligible. 
HIV-1 infected patients should have CD4>100 cells/mm3 and viral load < 100 000 cp/mL. 
Patients had to be on abacavir for at least 8 weeks. 
•  Treatments 
Subjects  were  given  an  observed  300  mg  dose  of  ABC  prescribed  as  part  of  the  subject’s 
current ARV treatment regimen. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
PK  parameters  were  assessed  for  Abacavir,  its  carboxylate  metabolite  and  its  glucuronide 
metabolite. 
•  PK modelling 
Blood  samples  for  PK  parameters  were  drawn  at  pre  dose,  0.5,  1.0,  2.0,  3.0,  4.0,  6.0  and  8.0 
hours post-dose. Additional blood was drawn at pre dose and 4.0 hours post dose for assessing 
PK phenotype.

•  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
15  subjects  were  enrolled  into  each  stratum  at  10  sites  between  August  2004  and  December 
2004. All 30 subjects completed the one day study and had evaluable PK data for analysis. 
•  Baseline data 
53% of patients were male. 57% of patients were Black, non Hispanic. 
Median CD4 count was 565 cells/mm3 and median CD4% was 27%. 
52% of patients had CV < 400 cp/mL. 
The majority of patients (n=24) received Trizivir alone (n=15) or with another ARV drug (n=9).

Summary statistics for PK parameters are shown overall in the table 12 (appendix). 
Summary statistics for PK parameters by age group, gender and race are given in tables 13 to 
15  (appendix).  The  last  column  in  the  tables  shows  the  significance  values  for  Wilcoxon  rank 
sum  tests  comparing  distributions  in  the  2  groups.  There  were  no  statistically  significant 
differences in any of the PK parameters by age group or gender. Hispanics had marginally 
higher median glucuronide AUCs than Blacks (p=0.044). 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
There is no statistically significant difference in abacavir PK parameters between patients aged > 
13  to  <18  years  and  those  aged  >  18  to  <  25  years.  Therefore,  there  is  no  concerning  signal 
suggesting  that  adolescents  might  be  under-dosed  compared  to  adults  with  the  currently 
recommended dose of abacavir. 
•  Comparison of P1052 PK results with previous published values 
Published summary statistics are available from 2 studies (Hughes at al, 1999 for children aged 
3 months to 13 years and Kumar et al, 1999 for adults aged 13-55 years) and from P10189. 
Comparisons are provided in table 19 (see below).

Rapporteur’s comment: 
Based  on  historical  comparison,  abacavir  Cmac  and  AUC  were  similar  in  patients  from  study 
P1052  than  in  adult  patients  receiving  the  same  dose  of  300  mg.  Therefore,  there  is  no  trend 
indicating a decrease in abacavir PK parameters in adolescents compared to adults.

RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
Study  PACTG  P1052  was  designed  to  address  the  question  whether  adolescents  and  young 
adults being given adult doses were achieving adequate plasma concentrations. 
There is no statistically significant difference in abacavir PK parameters between patients aged > 
13  to  <18  years  and  those  aged  >  18  to  <  25  years.  Therefore,  there  is  no  concerning  signal 
suggesting  that  adolescents  might  be  under-dosed  compared  to  adults  with  the  currently 
recommended dose of abacavir. 
Based  on  historical  comparison,  abacavir  Cmax  and  AUC  were  similar  in  patients  from  study 
P1052  than  in  adult  patients  receiving  the  same  dose  of  300  mg.  Therefore,  there  is  no  trend 
indicating a decrease in abacavir PK parameters in adolescents compared to adults. 
Overall, the Rapporteur concurs with the MAH that no changes to the Product Information 
are  considered  necessary  and  that  no  further  action  is  required  regarding  this 
submission

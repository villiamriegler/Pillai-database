On 17 October 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Kalydeco. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Ireland) 
Limited. 
The CHMP recommended approval of a new 25-mg strength, for Kalydeco granules, and an extension to the 
existing indication to allow use in infants from 6 months of age and weighing from 5 kg to less than 25 kg.    
For information, the full indication for Kalydeco granules will be as follows:2 
 “Kalydeco granules are indicated for the treatment of children with cystic fibrosis (CF)infants aged 12 at 
least 6 months, toddlers and older and children weighing 75 kg to less than 25 kg with cystic fibrosis  
(CF) who have one of the following gating (class III) mutations in the CFTR gene: G551D, G1244E, G1349D, 
G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N or S549R (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR),

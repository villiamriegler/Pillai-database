1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Sanofi Pasteur submitted on 4 October 2019 an application for marketing authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Supemtek, through the centralised procedure falling 
within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The applicant applied for the following indication “Supemtek vaccine is indicated for active 
immunization for the prevention of influenza disease in persons 18 years of age and older. Supemtek 
should be used in accordance with official recommendations”. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0219/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0219/2019 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the four strains of recombinant haemagglutinin contained in the above 
medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Scientific advice 
The applicant received the following Scientific advice on the development relevant for the indication  
subject to the present application:

1.2.  Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP were: 
Rapporteur: Jan Mueller-Berghaus 
Co-Rapporteur: Andrea Laslop 
For the appointed co-rapporteur it was considered exceptionally justified that the individual had 
previously been acting as coordinator for Scientific advice on the development relevant for the 
indication subject to the present application. The justification was as follows: 
Within the European regulatory network, there is a confined pool of vaccine experts and this limits the 
options available for coordinators and rapporteurs. 
The appointed rapporteur had no such prominent role in Scientific advice relevant for the indication 
subject to the present application.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease 
Influenza is an infectious acute respiratory disease of global importance that occurs in annual 
epidemics in the northern hemisphere (NH) and southern hemisphere (SH). The influenza virus is 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020

transmitted by respiratory droplets or aerosols containing the influenza virus particles and subsequent 
inhalation of infectious particles or self-inoculation from a contaminated surface. Clinical manifestation 
of influenza virus infection is characterised by an abrupt onset of nonspecific respiratory and systemic 
effects, such as fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat and rhinitis.   
Some individuals are more prone than others to develop complications from influenza, e.g. bacterial 
pneumonia or other organ dysfunction. Severe influenza and complicated influenza potentially leading 
to hospitalisation and death are more likely to occur in vulnerable populations, such as older people 
(≥65 years of age, in part due to the age related decline of the immune response 
(immunosenescence)), pregnant women, younger children (especially up to 24 months of age), and 
patients with chronic underlying diseases. These groups are considered at risk and represent the 
priority target for influenza vaccination programmes in the EU. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, prevention 
Influenza is an infectious acute respiratory disease of global importance that occurs in annual 
epidemics in the NH and SH during winter months. In temperate climates, influenza generally affects 
people from November to March in the NH and from May to September in the SH. It can occur all year 
round in tropical climates.   
Influenza in humans can be caused by the influenza virus type A, B and C, of which type A and B 
viruses are most clinically relevant. Type A viruses are associated with annual epidemics and 
pandemics, and B viruses contribute to annual epidemics. The type A viruses are further divided into 
different subtypes, of which the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 viruses are the most clinically relevant for annual 
influenza disease burden. For influenza B, only a single type is known to exist, but 2 distinct genetic 
lineages are identified: Yamagata and Victoria. Influenza B circulates almost every year worldwide 
generally later in the season in comparison to influenza A-viruses. According to data from the 
European Influenza Network, since 2001, influenza B has circulated with variable frequency, including 
2017-2018 when type B was the predominant circulating strain. From year to year, the predominating 
B lineage has varied, resulting in the recommendations for quadrivalent influenza vaccines. 
Traditionally and until 2012, seasonal influenza vaccines included antigens from 3 influenza strains in 
their composition, 2 influenza A strains (largely A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), and a strain from 1 of the 2 
influenza B lineages (B/Yamagata or B/Victoria). This is because the majority of global influenza 
disease cases in humans since 1977 have been caused by circulating A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza B 
strains viruses. Influenza B strains from the 2 lineages have co-circulated yearly since 1980s, when 
they emerged, with either or both types prevalent within any given year with no cross protection 
between the lineages.  
The burden of influenza morbidity and mortality is high with a greater burden attributable to influenza 
A, largely due to the greater virulence of influenza A (A/H3N2 in particular). Seasonal influenza causes 
4 – 50 million symptomatic cases in EU/EEA each year, and 15,000 – 70,000 European citizens die 
every year of causes associated with influenza. Despite the often short duration of illness, the yearly 
economic and healthcare burden of influenza is substantial. Worldwide, these annual epidemics are 
estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290,000 to 650,000 
respiratory deaths (WHO. Influenza (Seasonal). Fact sheet. Nov 2018). The main prevention strategy 
to minimise influenza burden is through annual prophylactic vaccination. Influenza vaccines are 
designed to protect against illness from the circulating virus strains, and the most commonly used 
vaccines have been inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV). The World Health Organization (WHO) 
recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for specific group of people which are more at risk of 
complications and death: pregnant women, elderly individuals (≥65 years of age), individuals with 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 10/99 
 
 
 
chronic medical conditions, health care workers, and children aged from 6 months to 5 years. 
Additionally, some public health authorities are moving towards vaccination strategies to reduce the 
risk of influenza in all age groups in an effort to decrease overall disease burden and spread to those in 
the population who are most at risk.   
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The influenza virus is an orthomyxovirus that can be classified into 3 biologically similar, but 
antigenically different types, A, B, and C, of which type A and B viruses are the most clinically 
significant. They are characterised as enveloped, negative strand, segmented ribonucleic acid (RNA) 
viruses. The viral haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface antigens are subject to 
continuous and sequential evolution within immune or partially immune populations. Antigenic drift 
results from mutation(s) affecting the RNA segment coding for either HA or – less frequently - NA. As a 
result, there is alteration in the protein sequence that can lead to (minor) changes in antigenicity. 
Antigenic variants within a subtype (e.g. H1 or H3) emerge periodically and through natural selection 
gradually become the more predominant circulating virus strain, usually on an annual basis, while the 
preceding antigenic variant is suppressed by a specific immunity in the population. In contrast to 
antigenic drift, antigenic shift represents the emergence of completely new subtypes, typically through 
gen segment reassortment with other circulating strains and acquisition of substantially different 
antigenic gene sequences. Antigenic shift occurs at irregular intervals and may lead to pandemics. 
The influenza type A virus can be further divided into subtypes based on the HA and NA surface 
glycoprotein antigens. The subtype refers to major antigenic variation with respect to the HA and/or 
NA virion antigens. Of the influenza type A virus subtypes, the A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes are the 
most clinically important for annual influenza disease burden. Influenza type B viruses show extensive 
variation in antigenicity. Although no true B subtype is known to exist, during the early part of the 
1980s, 2 antigenically and genetically distinct lineages of influenza B emerged: B/Yamagata and 
B/Victoria.  
The 3 influenza virus types share no common virus-coded antigens and differ in epidemiology and to 
some degree in the severity of illness caused. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Clinical manifestation of influenza virus infection is characterised by an abrupt onset of nonspecific 
respiratory and systemic effects, such as fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, non-productive cough, 
sore throat and rhinitis (Monto et al. 2000). Influenza is generally self-limited and an uncomplicated 
disease. It can, however, be associated with severe morbidity and mortality in healthy children and 
certain groups of children and adults who are at increased risk of severe or complicated illness from 
influenza. Complications such as febrile convulsions, croup, acute otitis media, lower respiratory 
infections and encephalitis may arise in children as a consequence of the primary influenza infection, or 
as a result of secondary bacterial infections (Heikkinen et al. 1991). In older adults, pulmonary 
complications of influenza are most common and include secondary bacterial infection. Among others, 
acute respiratory infections can exacerbate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
or lead to decompensation of patients with congestive heart failure or diabetes mellitus and 
subsequently lead to an increased risk of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident (Gordon 
and Reingold 2018). 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 11/99 
 
 
 
2.1.5.  Management  
There is no effective treatment for influenza, and clinical management is based mostly on symptomatic 
treatment. Few antiviral drugs are available which may be able to reduce disease severity and 
duration, but they need to be taken soon after infection in order to be effective and can induce drug-
resistant mutants. Influenza antivirals target the viral NA protein (peramivir, zanamivir and 
oseltamivir), or the M2 protein (amantadine and rimantadine). The latter two are no longer 
recommended due to high level of resistance (>99%) in circulating viruses since 2009. Viruses 
resistant to the NA inhibitors have also increased dramatically after 2007 with the majority of seasonal 
H1N1 viruses (pre-pandemic 2009) exhibiting oseltamivir resistance.  
Vaccination is considered the best approach to lower the impact and burden of influenza disease. 
Currently, different seasonal inactivated (split virion or subunit) influenza vaccines (quadrivalent and 
trivalent) are licensed for children aged 6 months and older, adolescents and adults, as well as a live 
attenuated influenza vaccine licensed for children and adolescents aged 2 years to 17 years of age. 
In order to prevent influenza, annual vaccination against influenza is recommended in most risk groups 
for older adults (≥60 or ≥65 years) and individuals with underlying conditions, such as COPD, heart 
conditions, diabetes, that leave them at high risk of influenza disease and associated complications. In 
addition, some countries have general recommendations for influenza vaccination of healthy children.  
The protection afforded by conventional influenza vaccines is driven by how well the strains in the 
vaccine match the viruses that circulate during influenza season (antigenic match).  
In the EU many licensed seasonal influenza vaccines are produced using embryonated hen’s eggs. 
Influenza vaccine produced in eggs can only be obtained by careful advanced planning and the supply 
of eggs can be uncertain. Due to the antigenic drift, influenza vaccines may require an annual 
adjustment of vaccine strains. A potential mismatch between circulating influenza virus strains and the 
strains included in the vaccine because of antigenic drift poses a major challenge for vaccine 
production. A need for alternative production methods for influenza vaccines was identified in a World 
Health Organization report already in 1995. The vaccine under licensure is a quadrivalent recombinant 
haemagglutinin influenza vaccine, produced in patented insect cells using a baculovirus expression 
vector. This technology still requires the production of a high-yielding reassortant virus, but production 
in cell culture has its advantages from a production perspective, i.e. for example independency from 
eggs, and a better scalability. Influenza vaccine virus strains can mutate and the mutation be selected 
when passaged in eggs. In contrast, the finished product potentially yields a purified recombinant 
influenza haemagglutinin that is an exact genetic match to that of the influenza strains selected for the 
seasonal vaccine. 
About the product 
Quadrivalent Recombinant Influenza Vaccine (RIV4) active substances comprises recombinant 
haemagglutinin of the 4 strains of influenza virus recommended annually by the WHO for the Northern 
Hemisphere season: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
a strain A (H1N1) 
a strain A (H3N2)  
a strain B (Yamagata lineage) 
a strain B (Victoria lineage) 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 12/99 
 
 
 
Influenza vaccines induce antibodies that protect against infection by influenza viruses that match or 
are similar to the antigen composition of the vaccine based on antigenic similarity of vaccine to 
circulating strains. 
The RIV4 influenza vaccine contains a higher haemagglutinin antigen content (45 μg per antigen) than 
quadrivalent standard dose influenza vaccines (15 μg per antigen) currently licensed. 
The first recombinant haemagglutinin influenza vaccine was developed as a trivalent vaccine by Protein 
Sciences Corporation (PSC), now a Sanofi Company, under the trade name Flublok (RIV3), and was 
initially licensed in the United States of America (USA) for prevention of influenza disease in individuals 
18 years of age and older in 2013. Subsequently, PSC transitioned the product from a trivalent to the 
current quadrivalent vaccine (RIV4), approved in 2016 in the USA for use in individuals 18 years and 
older. 
RIV4 is a sterile solution for injection and is presented in a 0.5 mL pre-filled syringe. RIV4 is 
administered as one single dose per influenza season via intramuscular route.

The finished product (FP) also known as RIV4, is presented as sterile solution containing 45 µg of each 
of four recombinant HA (rHA) antigens as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: polysorbate 20, sodium chloride, monobasic sodium phosphate (monohydrate) 
and dibasic sodium phosphate (dodecahydrate) for pH control and water for injection. 
The product is available in a pre-filled syringe (Type I borosilicate glass) with tip cap and plunger 
stopper (bromobutyl rubber), with separate (CE marked) needle or without needle. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance (AS) included in the final finished product consists of four active substances, 
separately manufactured recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) proteins: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
rHA protein, derived from Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (named rHA H1) 
rHA protein, derived from Influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (named rHA H3) 
rHA protein, derived from Influenza B virus Victoria lineage (named rHA B-V) 
rHA protein, derived from Influenza B virus Yamagata lineage (named rHA B-Y) 
The recombinant HA antigens (rHA) are full length, uncleaved glycoproteins with molecular weights of 
approximately 65kDa. The rHA assembles to trimers with an approximate molecular weight of 195 
kDa. The functional structure comprises rosette-like complexes. Recombinant haemagglutinins are 
expressed in proprietary expresSF+ insect cells (derived from Spodoptera frugiperda cells) using 
baculovirus (Autographa californica Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (AcNPV)) as the vector for protein 
expression.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured at Unigen Inc., Gifu, Japan. 
Major objections were raised regarding missing GMP certificates for the Unigen and Protein Sciences 
sites. These were addressed during the procedure and appropriate GMP authorisations are now 
available for all sites. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process of the active substance contains the following steps: 
• 
Production of the rHA expressing baculovirus 
•  Upstream process: expansion of baculovirus and SF+ cells and expression of rHA in baculovirus-
infected SF+ cells 
•  Downstream process: harvest of rHA expressing cells and purification of rHA protein 
The manufacturing steps are appropriately described.  
Upstream manufacture of the AS includes culturing of expresSF+ cells, baculovirus infection and 
expansion and protein production. Detailed process flow diagrams including the in-process testing and 
process parameters have been provided. Recombinant baculoviruses are expanded in parallel in 
expresSF+ cells from the working virus bank (WVB) through to the working virus stock (WVS). WVS is 
used for inoculation of the working volume culture. The upstream manufacturing process is considered 
appropriately described and is adequately controlled. Critical in-process controls and in-process 
controls are suitably described.  
Downstream processing includes centrifugation, extraction of recombinant HA from the cell pellet, 
followed by clarification of the crude extract column chromatography, DNA removal, ultrafiltration and 
final AS formulation and bulk filtration. The container used for the storage and transport of the 
monovalent bulk active substance concentrate manufactured is a single use bag. Appropriate in-
process controls (including critical) are defined for downstream processing.  
It is acknowledged that certain parameters may change annually in response to seasonal strain 
variability and it is expected that the respective information is submitted together with the annual 
strain variations. Reprocessing is not claimed. 
Control of materials 
Cell banks 
The source, history and generation of the expresSF+ cell line is described in sufficient detail. The 
applicant is using a two-tiered cell bank system. The master cell bank (MCB) and the two working cell 
bank (WCB) lots derived thereof have been characterised in line with ICH Q5D requirements. The 
testing of the MCB and end of production (EOP) cells is in line with Ph. Eur. 5.2.3. requirements. A 
protocol for establishment of new WCBs has been submitted. All new WCB will be qualified using the 
adventitious agents testing scheme. The WCB is stored in liquid nitrogen. 
Master Virus Banks, viral vectors 
Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) was originally isolated from a single field 
collected alfalfa looper larva. AcNPV is the prototype virus of the family Baculoviridae. Generation of 
the master parent linear baculovirus bank has been described.  
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 14/99 
 
 
 
The master virus bank (MVB) was generated from the parent viral vector. Qualification testing of the 
MVB was performed in comparison to the parent viral vector. Taken together, the MVB is considered 
appropriately qualified.  
The history and generation of viral vectors are described in sufficient detail. 
Working virus banks 
The HA gene for each influenza strain included in the seasonal vaccine is added to the master virus 
bank (MVB) to create the working virus bank (WVB). 
The WVBs are subsequently tested to ensure identity, potency and correct assembly of the WVB. 
Stability of each new WVB is assessed as part of the selection process.  
The WVBs described in the dossier were used for the production of recombinant influenza virus (RIV)4 
for the 2018/2019 Northern Hemisphere vaccine season since these were the most recent WVBs for 
which qualification data were available at the time of CTD preparation. The qualification of these WVBs 
is representative of the qualification of all future WVBs. The respective section in the dossier is updated 
on an annual basis following the recommendation by WHO of influenza strains to be included in the 
vaccine. 
Antigens derived from the following influenza strains are included in the 2018-2019 RIV4 formulation: 
H1N1 (A/Michigan/45/2015), H3N2 (A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016), B-Yamagata 
(B/Phuket/3073/2013), B-Victoria (B/Maryland/15/2016). 
After construction of the working virus bank, the correct sequence is then verified by comparison with 
the sequence of a reference virus. Reference sequences are obtained from the Influenza Sequence 
Database (ISD, http://www.flu.lanl.gov/vaccine), GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), or the 
Global initiative on sharing all influenza data -GISAID EpiFlu database (http://platform.gisaid.org). An 
outline of the general cloning procedure from viral isolates is provided in the dossier.  
Raw materials 
Raw materials have been listed by the applicant along with their compliance to relevant 
pharmacopoeia.  
Protein Sciences Formulary Medium (PSFM) is the growth medium used for culturing of the SF+ cells. 
There are no ruminant-derived materials used in the manufacturing process of the PSFM. A table with 
the components of PSMF medium has been provided.  
The information on buffers and solutions used has been provided, the procedures used for preparation, 
regeneration and sanitisation of chromatography resins are described in the dossier. Re-use of the 
chromatography resins used has been defined. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical in-process controls are indicated in the section “Description of manufacturing process and process 
controls” (CTD section: S.2.2). The applicant outlined the ‘key’ process parameters and in-process tests 
for each manufacturing step. The classification was performed as follows: in-process tests, critical in-
process  tests,  process  parameters,  critical  process  parameters.  In  addition,  questions  regarding  the 
definition of critical process parameters and critical quality attributes have been suitably addressed.   
Acceptance criteria and action limits have been established based on previous manufacturing 
experience and process validation studies and appear sufficiently justified. Storage containers have 
been specified. Holding times for any process intermediates are specified and justified.

Process validation 
Prior to process validation (PV), performance qualification (PQ) studies were executed according to a 
validation master plan. All PV and PQ have been manufactured at Unigen, Gifu, using the final process 
at commercial scale. The objective of the PQ phase was to provide documented verification that the 
facilities and equipment can perform reproducibly to produce a product meeting its predetermined 
specifications and quality attributes. Commercial scale batches of rHA A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), 
A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2), and B/Wisconsin/1/2010 were manufactured, sampled, and tested during 
PQ.  
Adequate tests have been chosen for process validation. Validation of cell culture passage and 
preparation of virus suspension was also conducted. All PV reports have been submitted in the dossier. 
Furthermore, a comparability study was performed following scale-up and process changes at the 
commercial scale. In-process control parameters, critical process parameters, and quality attributes 
were defined for each process. All acceptance criteria were met. Shipping of AS to the FP site has been 
suitably validated. The presented data indicate that the process performs effectively and reproducibly 
to produce an active substance/intermediate meeting its predetermined specifications. 
Manufacturing process development 
The applicant outlined the manufacturing process development for the early development phase (1993 
– 2003; studies performed under the direction of NIH, NIAID), the commercial process development 
phase (2003 – 2007; under direction of Protein Sciences) and final expansion of the manufacturing 
capacity (2007 – 2018).  
RIV was initially developed as a trivalent formulation in the clinical lot manufacturing facility and 
licensed by the US FDA in 2013. RIV trivalent finished product was formulated and packaged for 
commercial distribution. 
AS and FP manufacturing facilities were validated and licensed by the U.S. FDA through a combination 
of clinical studies and comprehensive comparability studies which included demonstration of 
comparability of stability of product produced at the different sites.  
Development of the upstream block included several Phase 1/2 safety, immunogenicity and dose-
ranging studies. The transition from serum-requiring Sf9 cells to Protein Science’s (PSC) patented SF+ 
cells, which are grown without added serum was the most important development. In 2007, a 
commercial manufacturing process was established, that does not represent the final process.  
After 2007, manufacturing process development focused on reduction of manufacturing cost of goods 
and expansion of the manufacturing scale to prepare for commercialisation and global expansion of RIV 
U.S. commercial scale facilities were approved by the FDA, for formulation and packaging of RIV 
trivalent. 
RIV4 was approved by the US FDA in 2016. Approval was supported by clinical studies PSC12 and 
PSC16, process validation data and comparability of stability profiles from FP process validation 
batches to stability profiles of trivalent commercial RIV batches.  
A number of facilities were used to produce phase 3 lots during clinical development of RIV. The 
commercial scale facility in Gifu, Japan was built for manufacture of commercial RIV AS. A number of 
changes have been introduced by Unigen in order to increase the production scale. The manufacturing 
process implemented in Gifu, Japan for commercial AS production has been linked to the pivotal phase 
III clinical study material by a comparability study.

Changes in the manufacturing process due to annual strain changes: 
The downstream process is designed as universal process with some adaptations when necessary. The 
process readjustments made annually within the approved design space, which ensures that process 
changes do not impact safety or efficacy. The company has, upon request, agreed to update the 
dossier to reflect that the registered design space is now part of section 3.2.S.2.2.  In case a process 
change out of the registered design space is needed, this would be submitted as a dossier variation. 
Characterisation 
The recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) antigens are full length, uncleaved glycoproteins with molecular 
weights of approximately 65,000 Daltons and are widely considered to be the most essential antigenic 
component of influenza virus vaccines. Full length, intact rHA molecules are referred to as rHA0. 
Recombinant HA0 contains two domains, HA1 and HA2, which are separable by proteolysis with 
trypsin. The N-terminal HA1 contains the globular head of the protein with five antigenic sites and the 
receptor binding domain that mediates attachment of the influenza virus to cells. The C-terminal HA2 
contains the transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions of the protein. In addition, rHA proteins contain 
multiple cysteine residues capable of forming disulfide bonds, which contribute to the tertiary structure 
and antigenicity of the molecule. A battery of methods was used to characterise physicochemical 
properties. The results from rHA glycoform characterisation studies should be provided to further 
support comparability of material derived from the clinical lot manufacturing sites and the Gifu 
commercial site (recommendation 1). The purified rHA proteins are in a native, properly folded 
conformation. rHA assembles into complexes of HA trimers. The potency of each rHA is measured with 
the SRID. The assay is standardised with reference antigen and antiserum provided by FDA Center for 
Biologics Evaluation and Research CBER or any other WHO Essential Regulatory Laboratory. This assay 
demonstrates the potency and appropriate antigenic activity of the rHA proteins. The biological activity 
of rHA and the ability to form multimers have been assessed by a haemagglutination assay. The assay 
demonstrated that rHA proteins are competent to agglutinate red blood cells (RBCs) and is used to 
confirm the biological activity of the purified rHA proteins.  
A series of immunogenicity studies were conducted in laboratory animals during the pre-clinical and 
clinical development of RIV4, primarily in CD-1 outbred mice. Additional studies were conducted in 
chickens, ferrets, and rats. Those studies demonstrated a robust serological response as measured by 
ELISA, haemagglutination inhibition (HAI), or neutralisation assays. The appropriateness of 
immunogenicity studies is discussed in the non-clinical assessment report. 
The data presented were initially considered limited (i.e. only 1 batch per strain of the trivalent 
formulation was tested) and in part outdated (strains manufactured in seasons 2004/2005 and 
2006/2007 and not according to the current manufacturing process). However, it is noted that 
additional physico-chemical characterisation data from recent batches of 3 of the 4 rHA antigens are 
available in section 3.2.S.2.6. Furthermore, additional characterisation data were presented for three 
recent commercial batches of rHA B Yamagata lineage (i.e. B/Phuket/3073/2013, manufactured in 
2019). The presented results indicate a consistent manufacturing process. 
The rHA proteins are sufficiently characterised to control identity, glycosylation and higher order 
conformation. Functionality is tested by adequate methods which demonstrate the appropriate 
antigenic activity of the rHA proteins.  
Impurities: 
The active substance contains impurities which derive from the cell substrate, or the cell culture or 
from the downstream processing of rHA proteins. Process-related impurities are controlled by release 
Assessment report

tests at the level of the AS. For certain impurities, the maximum amount per human dose has been 
calculated and raises no safety concern. Other impurities are removed during the process. Other 
impurities are additionally controlled at the level of the FP. The polysorbate 20 assay is still in 
development. The polysorbate 20 method should be validated and implemented as FP release test, via 
variation, (see recommendation 6). All specified impurities have been present in product studied in 
clinical trials. Potential product-related are present at low abundance and sufficiently controlled via 
release tests.  
Specification 
The release tests and specifications for the active substance rHA are presented in the dossier. They 
comprise appropriate specifications tests for appearance, identity, sterility, endotoxin, process-related 
impurities, rHA size, protein content and biological activity. In addition to these release tests, tests for 
the presence of mycoplasma and spiroplasma and in vitro assays for the presence of adventitious 
viruses are conducted at the time of harvest.  
Analytical methods 
Brief descriptions have been provided for all non-compendial methods. Non-compendial methods have 
been validated according to ICH Q2(R1) requirements.  
Batch analysis 
Batch release results have been submitted for the process validation batches produced at the 
commercial site. In addition, batch release results for AS batches used to demonstrate comparability of 
the production process are shown. 
All batches were manufactured according to the commercial scale (final process). The presented batch 
data comply with the pre-defined acceptance criteria valid at time of release and indicate a consistent 
manufacturing process. 
Reference materials 
The applicant provided information on reference materials used (and their qualification) used for 
identity/potency, purity, host cell protein (HCP), quantification of protein, DNA quantification and for 
rHA.  the provided information is considered acceptable. The procedure for qualifying new reagents for 
identity/potency testing is outlined in the FP section of the dossier. 
Container closure 
The container used for the storage and transport of the monovalent bulk AS concentrate is a single use 
bag. Compatibility with the AS has been addressed. 
Stability studies were conducted to confirm the compatibility of the components in contact with the rHA 
AS. An extractables study is part of the dossier. Information provided on extractables and leachables is 
considered sufficient.

Stability data have been provided for rHA bulk AS produced at sites used to produce clinical lots 
(seasons 2013/2014, 2014/2015, and 2015/2016).  Stability data are also provided for the proposed 
commercial manufacturing site Unigen/Gifu. The batches were manufactured according to the final 
process and stored at long-term conditions. All stability studies are finalised. Essentially, the stability 
studies comply with ICH guidelines Q1A and Q5C; a statistical evaluation of stability data was 
performed according to ICH guideline Q1E. Data on accelerated stability has also been provided. 
Photostability has been adequately addressed according to ICH Q1B. The analytical program comprised 
the relevant stability indicating methods. All batches met the stability specifications.  
 Shelf life and storage conditions for the active substance have been proposed by the applicant and 
found acceptable. However, a stability monitoring method for assessment of active substance product-
related impurities should be implemented (recommendation 2). 
For each Northern Hemisphere vaccine campaign, the applicant proposes to include batches of each 
rHA antigen in the annual stability study. Strain specific data will be expected as part of the annual 
update the following season. This approach is deemed acceptable. This approach is acceptable.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product

Sodium phosphate is included as a buffer for pH control. Sodium chloride is added to maintain 
osmolality for a product intended for intramuscular injection and to maintain a physiological medium 
for proper conformation of the rHA protein (active pharmaceutical ingredient). rHA proteins are 
membrane-bound and a surfactant (polysorbate/ tween 20) is added to maintain their solubility. 
The container closure system consists a pre-filled syringe (Type I borosilicate glass) with plunger 
stopper (grey butyl rubber), with separate needle or without needle. The container closure system was 
tested for integrity. Extractables and leachables of the final container have been sufficiently addressed. 
The applicant commits to provide the completed risk assessment report(s) for elemental impurities 
(see recommendation 4). The medical device (separate CE-marked needle if supplied) has been 
sufficiently described.  
Development of RIV4 (approved by USA FDA in 2016) was based on the trivalent formulation of RIV, 
which is licensed in the USA since 2013. From the submitted information, it is concluded that the 
applicant followed a traditional/minimal development approach.  
The same general procedure is used for formulation and filling of RIV4 lots as was used for trivalent 
RIV. All lots were formulated in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.0 ± 0.4, with 0.005% Tween 20. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Name and address of the manufacturer responsible for batch release: Sanofi Pasteur, Parc Industriel 
d'Incarville, 27100 Val de Reuil, France. A major objection was raised since a valid GMP certificate 
issued by an EU/EAA inspectorate was not available for one manufacturing site. This was resolved 
during the procedure and suitable GMP certificates/authorisations are available for all sites. 
The manufacturing process of the FP follows a standard process namely mixing of AS with PBS and 
polysorbate, final filtration and filling.  
The four active substances (rHA of H1, H3, and two B strains) are mixed with the formulation buffer 
(sodium phosphate, sodium chloride, polysorbate 20) and formulated to the target rHA content /dose 
based on the potency of each rHA active substance batch, which is measured prior to each RIV4 
formulation. The bulk finished product solution is sterile filtered and aseptically filled into syringes. 
Following visual inspection, the syringes are labelled, the plunger rod is inserted, and the syringes are 
packaged. The finished product is stored at 2 – 8°C.  
For the 2018/2019 RIV4 influenza vaccine the formulation is provided. The rHA composition is changed 
to match the appropriate strains recommended by the WHO for each influenza season.  
A traditional process validation approach was chosen by the applicant. To confirm that the 
manufacturing process performs reliably and delivers product of consistent quality, RIV4 lots with the 
2015/2016 NH composition were manufactured at intended commercial scale at the intended 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 20/99 
 
 
 
commercial site. Consecutive validation lots have been used. For the validation runs, all IPC and 
release tests complied with the specifications valid at time of testing and the proposed commercial 
release specification. Adequate mixing during formulation was demonstrated and the analytical results 
confirm homogenous filling of the syringes. The percentage of rejected syringes was consistent over 
the validation runs. In summary, the results for the validation runs indicate consistent performance of 
the manufacturing process. 
Aseptic manufacturing is regularly confirmed by media fills. Results for three media fills performed in 
2014 are presented. The filtration and filling times cover the times specified for the RIV4 process.  
The results of the filter validation demonstrate that the sterile filter is suitable for the filtration of RIV4 
and has a sufficient capacity for retention of bacteria. Information on extractables/leachables has been 
provided but leaching from other single-use process equipment (e.g. tubing) has not been addressed 
and a risk assessment for elemental impurities according to ICH Q3D is missing. The applicant commits 
to provide the completed risk assessment report(s) for leachables from single-use materials and 
elemental impurities (see recommendations 3 and 4). 
The applicant outlined the shipping strategy for shipment of RIV4 syringes from the manufacturing site 
to the EU release site and summarised the corresponding shipping validations. The shipping process is 
considered sufficiently supported. 
Product specification 
The quadrivalent formulated bulk acceptance criteria and the RIV4 FP specifications are described in 
the dossier. The specifications include appropriate tests for appearance, identity, endotoxin, sterility, 
potency, total protein content, content uniformity, purity, total DNA, osmolarity pH, fill volume, Triton 
X 100, Tween 20. Several other concerns regarding the specification have been sufficiently clarified. 
The polysorbate 20 method validation, the implementation as characterisation test and finally the 
implementation as release test with justified specifications has been included in the list of 
recommendations (recommendation 6).  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.    
In addition, the applicant commits to submit the study results to investigate the stability indicating 
capability of the SRID method for one B strain in the presence of the other B strain (see 
recommendation 5). 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis results for the process validation batches and the clinical lot used for the pivotal studies 
PSC12 and PSC16 comply with the release specification. The results indicate that the manufacturing 
process is capable of delivering FP of consistent quality that meets its specifications. Compared to the 
AS, no new impurities are introduced during FP manufacturing. 
Reference materials 
The influenza reference antigen material is obtained from CBER (US FDA) or other World Health 
Organization Essential Regulatory Laboratories (ERLs) for each of the four seasonal haemagglutinin 
strains. The reference antigen is strain specific and has been standardised by CBER or other ERLs. New 
reagents are qualified and the qualification report is submitted as part of the strain change annual 
update.

Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life of Supemtek FP is 12 months at 2 – 8°C. 
Extensive real time stability data for multiple commercial RIV lots manufactured from 2013/2014 to 
2018/2019 are presented by the applicant. The stability data for RIV4 are sufficient to support the 
claimed shelf life. To a large extent the stability studies comply with ICH guidelines Q1A and Q5C; a 
statistical evaluation of stability data was performed according to ICH guideline Q1E. Photostability has 
been adequately addressed according to ICH Q1B. Real time data covering a period of at least 12 
months at 2-8°C are available.  
The photostability studies show that RIV4 in the primary packaging (pre-filled syringes) is sensitive to 
light but sufficiently protected by the secondary packaging.  
The claimed shelf life of 12 months at 2 - 8°C is supported by the presented stability data and is 
acceptable.  
The applicant provided a stability commitment for annual stability studies and the respective stability 
protocol (data expected in the next season’s annual update). The analytical program includes relevant 
stability indicating methods and safety related tests. Taking into account the large set of stability data 
gathered, the annual stability studies is deemed acceptable.  
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant 
negative trend, for any on-going stability studies should be reported to EMA. 
Adventitious agents 
Non-viral adventitious agents 
The applicant presented an overview describing all measures set as regards the control of 
mycoplasma/spiroplasma, bacteria and fungi as well as a respective discussion, as requested. The 
measures set to prevent adventitious agents from entering the production process appear appropriate 
and include careful selecting and testing raw and starting (MCB and MVB) materials of biological origin, 
assessing the manufacturing process to prevent contamination (operators, equipment, and 
environment), assessing the ability of the production process to clear (eliminate, reduce, neutralise, or 
inactivate) any adventitious agents, and testing the product at appropriate stages of the production 
process for the absence of adventitious agents. Taken together, the measures set to assure safety with 
respect to non-viral contaminants are considered adequate and the risk associated with these 
contaminants is considered low. 
TSE 
The applicant states that no bovine-derived ingredients have been nor are currently used in the 
establishment of the master cell banks, working cell banks, master virus banks, working virus banks, 
nor the production process of rHA active substance bulk.  
Viral adventitious agents 
Cell banks 
The cell banks were tested for potential viral contaminants in line with ICH Q5A requirements.  
Given that bovine materials were used in cell line development and an insect cell line is used as the cell 
substrate, cells banks were additionally screened for relevant viruses found in those species, as 
1 6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the European Union 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 22/99 
 
 
 
 
detailed in the dossier. Taken together, the above studies provided no evidence of contamination by 
adventitious viruses and the safety of cell banks with respect to adventitious viruses is considered 
sufficiently demonstrated.  
Virus banks 
The MVB was tested according to the “Points to Consider in the Characterization of Cell Lines Used to 
Produce Biologics” by in vitro assays and in vivo assays and is considered adequate. Adventitious 
agents testing is in line with Ph. Eur. 2.6.16. Testing of virus banks with respect to adventitious viruses 
is considered sufficient.  
Testing of unprocessed and purified bulks 
During routine manufacturing, each unprocessed bulk is tested for the presence of viral contaminants. 
Prior to infection, the production culture is additionally tested. The proposed testing is considered 
adequate.  The absence of infectious baculovirus is a requirement for release of the AS. A respective 
specification has been implemented, the method to control for the absence of infectious baculovirus is 
considered adequate. 
Virus validation studies: 
The capacity of the manufacturing process for effective virus clearance has been evaluated in several 
studies. The virus clearance studies were conducted in line with the requirements outlined in the Note 
for guidance on virus validation studies (CPMP/BWP/268/95). The applicant provided the information 
on validation of down-scale models as requested. Based on the results provided (i.e. results of process 
parameters and analytical data of process intermediates), the scale-down models can be considered as 
representative for the commercial scale. The provided information is considered sufficient.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active Substance 
The MO regarding comparability of the vaccine batches used in pivotal clinical trials and the 
commercial product manufactured from AS produced at a different site, the Unigen site in Gifu has 
been solved. During the procedure, a question remained regarding a potential clinical impact of the 
observed differences in the rHA complex. The applicant has analysed data from AS batches 
manufactured between sites and found no correlation with immunogenicity. Thus, it can be concluded 
that no clinical impact is expected from the differences in the rHA manufactured at the different sites. 
The analysis of glycoforms which is required to further support comparability of material derived from 
the clinical lot manufacturing sites and the Gifu commercial site has been included in the list of 
recommendations (recommendation 1). 
The applicant is recommended to introduce a stability monitoring method for assessment of active 
substance product-related impurities (recommendation 2).  All other concerns raised have been 
sufficiently addressed by the applicant.  
Finished Product 
The GMP certificate for the manufacturing site has been provided. Therefore, the FP MO has been 
resolved.  
All other concerns have been sufficiently addressed by the applicant. The validation of the polysorbate 
20 methods and its implementation as FP release test has been included in the list of recommendations 
(recommendation 6).  
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020

Also, the risk assessment for leachables from single-use materials (recommendation 3) and the risk 
assessment for elemental impurities (recommendation 4), as well as the investigation of the stability 
indicating capability of the SRID method for one B strain in the presence of the other B 
(recommendation 5) have been included in the list of recommendations.  
Risk assessment regarding Nitrosamine 
The applicant has submitted the required risk assessment regarding the potential nitrosamine 
impurities in Supemtek. The CHMP agrees with the applicant’s conclusion that no risk of presence of 
nitrosamines is identified.  
New active substance claim 
It was not agreed that the active substance in Supemtek fulfils the requirements for a new active 
substance as defined by indent 1 of Annex 1 of Volume 2a of Notice to Applicants (NtA) for the 
following reasons: although it is acknowledged that the structure of rHA might differ from conventional 
flu vaccines with regards to HA0/HA1+HA2 ratio and the size of the rosette clusters, this is considered 
not sufficient to define a new active substance. Conventional flu vaccines are highly variable. 
Depending on the substrate, the inactivation agent and the whole process, a wide distribution of 
structurally different antigens exists. Also, mutations are not considered to induce a structurally 
different active substance, especially not in the context of influenza vaccine viruses which change 
annually. Despite this variability, all HA antigens can be considered as comparable. Chemical 
modifications and differences in glycosylation pattern are not well defined and the high purity is not a 
feature of the active substance itself.  
There is high variability between different influenza vaccines and also between annually updated 
antigens of each single vaccine. The differences described for the rHA fall within the normal range for 
influenza vaccines and do not generate a new active substance under indent 1 of Annex 1 of Volume 
2a of Notice to Applicants (NtA)  (see new active substance section of the CHMP AR for clinical 
considerations, under indent 3). 
2.2.1.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical programme for the quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV4) was primarily 
based on immunogenicity, non-clinical safety data, clinical and pharmacovigilance data obtained with 
trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3). The main difference between RIV3 and RIV4 relates to 
an increase in the rHA content (from 135 to 180 µg/dose) due to the addition of a second lineage B 
strain. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
No specific non-clinical pharmacology studies including immunogenicity and challenge-protection 
studies in animal models have been performed with RIV4. There is large amount of pharmacodynamics 
data available in humans with both RIV3 and RIV4, both licensed in the US and manufactured using 
the same manufacturing process as that intended for EU. In addition, immunogenicity of RIV3 was 
established in mice. 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 25/99 
 
 
 
 
The applicant presented non-clinical immunogenicity data generated in mice with the monovalent rH3 
antigen (studies M0117 and M0139) and with the RIV3 (study M0163) that were administered 
intraperitoneally, intramuscular and subcutaneously, respectively.

Immune responses were dose-dependent; a 
10-fold increase in antigen resulted in 
approximately a three-fold increase over 
baseline in ELISA and HAI antibody titers. 
rHA produced in cell culture grown in serum-
free medium stimulated HAI antibodies to 
similar levels induced by rHA manufactured 
using serum in the production process. 
A trivalent formulation of rHA vaccine (RIV3) 
containing the 1994-1995 Northern 
Hemisphere type A and B influenza strains 
induced functional serum HAI and neutralizing 
antibodies against all strains of influenza in 
the vaccine. 
The results from these studies show that RIV3 and rH3 are immunogenic and can induce serum HAI 
and nAb antibodies against the influenza strains present in the vaccine. A clear dose effect was evident 
in a range of 5 - 15 – 50 µg of rH3 and the antibody response was strongly enhanced when 15 µg rH3 
was formulated with aluminium adjuvant. These data provide important proof-of-concept and support 
omission of the protection studies in animals. Although these non-clinical data do not address 
immunogenicity of the 4th strain in the context of RIV4, the CHMP acknowledged the extensive clinical 
experience with RIV4 that showed immunogenicity of each of the 4 antigen compositions within the 
vaccine. Therefore, the absence of non-clinical pharmacology data on the Yamagata lineage is 
considered acceptable. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No dedicated studies were performed regarding secondary pharmacodynamic. This is endorsed due to 
the nature of the product. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated studies including RIV4 were performed regarding safety pharmacology.  
Three safety pharmacology studies were performed with RIV3, even though the repeat-dose toxicity 
study performed in rats with this vaccine did not show effects on the cardiovascular system (no clinical 
signs or abnormal histopathology), respiratory system (no unusual respiratory pattern) or CNS 
functions (no abnormal clinical signs on behaviour and posture). 
These safety pharmacology studies were performed to evaluate the effects of RIV3 (trivalent, 135μg 
total rHA/dose, corresponding to 45 μg rHA/strain) following a single subcutaneous injection of one 
human dose.

on the cardiovascular system (blood pressure, heart rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
parameters) (Study number P081016) in unanaesthetised dogs;

on the central nervous system (CNS) (functional observational battery test, locomotor activity 
and the body temperature measurement) (Study number P081014) in rats. 
Results of safety pharmacology studies showed that a single SC injection with RIV3 did not adversely 
affect the blood pressure, heart rate, ECG parameters (in beagle dogs), respiratory parameters (in 
rats) as well as FOB, locomotor activity or body temperature (in rats). However, there are limitations 
of this study due to the use of SC route instead of the intended IM administration in humans. In 
addition, relevance of the dog can be questioned due to absence of immunogenicity evidence from the 
model. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated studies were performed regarding secondary pharmacodynamic. This is endorsed due to 
the nature of the product. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In accordance with current guidelines, pharmacokinetic studies are not required for the vaccine 
assessment. No non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies have been performed to evaluate absorption, 
distribution, metabolism and excretion of the active ingredients of RIV4. RIV4 does not contain novel 
excipient or adjuvant. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No non-clinical toxicity studies have been performed with RIV4. The applicant supports the non-clinical 
safety evaluation of RIV4 based on a number of toxicology studies conducted with RIV3. The only 
notable difference between RIV3 and RIV4 relates to an increase in the total rHA content (from 135 to 
180 µg/dose) due to the addition of another lineage B rHA. 
Taking into account the similarity of RIV3 to RIV4, with respect to the manufacturing process with no 
novel excipients or process residuals and in absence of post-marketing safety concerns with RIV3, it is 
agreed that the non-clinical package developed to support RIV3 is relevant to support licensure of RIV4 
in the EU. 
The omission of non-clinical toxicity studies with RIV4 for the licensure of RIV4 in Europe is consistent 
with the CHMP Scientific Advice (EMEA/H/SA/3849/1/2018/III) and the EMA guidelines on influenza 
vaccines. 
The applicant presented toxicity studies with RIV3 in different animal species as shown in Table 3. All 
pivotal non-clinical toxicity studies were conducted under GLP conditions.  
Table 3: Toxicology program 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 27/99 
 
 
 
Single dose toxicity 
In single-dose toxicity studies, a single SC injection of RIV3 at a human dose did not induce toxicity 
effects over a 14-day observation period. During each study, there were no premature deaths, no 
clinical signs, no effects on body weights and no macroscopic findings. In addition, local reactions and 
food consumption were monitored in the dog study only and there were no vaccine-related effects 
noted on these parameters. Limitations of these studies include use of alternative SC administration 
route and the small number of animals per group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 28/99 
 
 
 
 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study was conducted with the SC route. Results showed that five 
weekly SC injections with RIV3 were locally and systemically well tolerated in rats. There were no local 
reactions and no signs of systemic toxicity including clinical pathology parameters, organ weights and 
macroscopic findings. The main related findings were transient microscopic changes at the injection 
sites, which is expected. It is noteworthy that use of an alternative administration route (SC) rather 
than the clinically intended IM route for a pivotal toxicity study is uncommon, as is the short dosing 
interval of 7-days rather than a classic 2-3-weeks interval. Overall, results of this study are limited, in 
view of the fact that RIV3 had extensive human experience at the time of conducting this study. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
No genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies were carried out in line with relevant guidelines. Studies 
evaluating genotoxicity and carcinogenicity are normally not required for viral vaccines. Since no 
adjuvants or novel excipients are used in this product absence of those studies is considered 
acceptable. 
Reproduction toxicity 
In DART study conducted in female rats, three IM injections (31 and 12 days before mating and on 
Gestation Day 6) of RIV3 did not induce maternal toxicity, and there were no adverse effects on 
mating performance or fertility, embryo-foetal development (including an evaluation of teratogenicity) 
and an early post-natal development. RIV3 at the human dose induced an active immune response to 
the three strains in all rat dams from the vaccine group. The exposure of foetuses and pups to vaccine-
specific maternal antibodies was also demonstrated. 
Local tolerance  
Local tolerance studies showed that RIV3 was well tolerated upon a single IM or SC injection at the 
human dose, with no local reactions related to vaccine injection and no signs of systemic toxicity for a 
7-day observation period. Transient microscopic inflammation at injection sites was observed after IM 
injection only, which was expected. 
Other toxicity studies 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance of RIV4 is purified protein, the use of which is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. Therefore, dedicated environmental risk studies are not considered necessary. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The present MAA does not include any dedicate pharmacology or toxicology studies with RIV4. The 
non-clinical evaluation of RIV4 was primarily based on non-clinical obtained with RIV3 and clinical trial 
data and post-marketing surveillance data obtained with RIV3 and RIV4. 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 29/99 
 
 
 
The main difference between RIV3 and RIV4 relates to an increase in the rHA content (from 135 to 180 
µg/dose) due to the addition of a second lineage B strain. Both vaccines are manufactured using the 
same manufacturing process, same compositions and amounts of excipients and process residuals. 
Based on the similarity between RIV3 and RIV4 and availability of extensive clinical experience with 
RIV3, it is justified that no additional non-clinical studies with RIV4 are necessary for its MAA in the EU, 
in line with the EMA guidance on Guideline on Influenza Vaccines. This is also in agreement with the 
CHMP Scientific Advice provided confirming that sufficient non-clinical and clinical data are available for 
RIV3 and RIV4 so that no further non-clinical studies with RIV4 are deemed necessary for MAA in the 
EU.  
Despite the limitations observed in the pharmacodynamic or toxicology studies, it is acknowledged that 
extensive clinical experience with RIV3 from pre-licensure clinical trials and post-marketing 
surveillance safety profile did not identify any unexpected safety signal. The absence of non-clinical 
immunogenicity data on the additionally added Yamagata line and the lack of dedicated 
pharmacodynamic data generated exclusively with the quadrivalent product was justified by available 
clinical data from trials and marketing/post-marketing process in US of RIV4. In particular to safety, 
the non-clinical safety package developed for RIV3 showing no issue of major safety concern complies 
with the known clinical adverse event profile of RIV3. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the non-clinical data available from studies conducted with recombinant H3 and RIV3 and 
data collected from the extensive clinical experience with RIV3 from pre-licensure clinical trials and 
post-marketing surveillance the product, there is no specific safety concern. The product is considered 
approvable from a non-clinical perspective. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical development strategy for RIV4 followed the initial development of the trivalent product and 
was based on the demonstration that RIV4 was at least comparable to a licensed influenza 
quadrivalent vaccine in terms of safety, immunogenicity and efficacy. 
The quantity of each HA antigen and excipients of RIV4 was equivalent to that of the US licensed 
trivalent  recombinant influenza vaccine manufactured by PSC with the addition of the second B strain. 
Safety and immunogenicity of the RIV4 were expected to be similar to the trivalent formulation. 
Therefore, the clinical development plan for RIV4 did not include formal evaluation of safety in a Phase 
I study and dose selection in a Phase II study. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies were not conducted in the development program of RIV4, in line with current 
guidelines. Pharmacokinetic studies are not required for influenza vaccines as the kinetics properties of 
vaccines do not provide useful information for establishing adequate dosing recommendations.    
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Supemtek provides active immunisation against four influenza virus strains (two A subtypes and two B 
types) contained in the vaccine. Supemtek induces humoral antibodies against the haemagglutinins. 
These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses. 
The pharmacodynamic profile of vaccines is defined by their immunogenicity profile, as detailed in the 
CHMP guideline “Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines” (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005).  
It should be mentioned that HI titres are not a true correlate of protection in the sense that there is 
not a globally accepted cut-off titre that defines clinical protection. Nonetheless, it has been widely 
shown that higher HI titres tend to correlate with better protection so HI assay can be used as 
immunological marker for comparative assessment. Antibody against one influenza virus type or 
subtype confers limited or no protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic 
variant of influenza virus might not protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or 
subtype.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Immunogenicity of the vaccine was assessed using a haemagglutination inhibition test (HAI). Although 
HAI is not a confirmed immunological correlate of protection, HAI is traditionally used for the 
assessment of immunogenicity of influenza vaccines. The serological analysis of the study samples 
from the pivotal studies PSC12 and PSC16 was performed by one central laboratory (Q2 Solutions, San 
Juan Capistrano (SJC), California, USA; previously Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA), as 
recommended in the EMA Guideline on Influenza Vaccines - Non-clinical and Clinical Module 
EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014.  
The HAI has been described. Method validation reports for the strains A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), 
A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2), A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2), B/Hubei Wujiagang/158/2009, 
B/Massachusetts/2/2012, and B/Brisbane/60/2008 influenza antigens (i.e. the strains for the 
2014/2015 NH season are covered) have been provided. The method validation comprised the 
parameters accuracy/recovery, sensitivity, specificity, intra- and inter-assay precision, and linearity. 
The precision experiments addressed day-to-day variability as well as variability introduced by 
operator and the lot of RBCs. Egg-derived antigens and corresponding sheep reference sera from 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 32/99 
 
 
 
 
NIBSC as well as a panel of human sera from influenza vaccinees were used throughout the validation 
experiments.  
The validation data demonstrate that the HAI method performs reliably and is suitable for monitoring 
of immunogenicity in clinical studies.  
In the two main studies for RIV4 approval (PSC12 and PSC16), HAI antibody titers to each virus strain 
represented in RIV4 and IIV4 were measured as sole serologic parameter in sera obtained 
approximately 28 days after vaccination. HAI antibody titers were determined by an assay that used 
egg-derived antigens supplied by NIBSC. In contrary, the former study PSC04, now submitted 
supportively mainly for efficacy bridging reasons, uses a BEVS (Baculovirus-Expression Vector-
System)-derived test antigen. Still, the relative values among the different included vaccine strains as 
well as the fact, that its respective B strain is supporting the efficacy of RIV, renders consideration of 
its immunogenicity results worthwhile. 
Analysis of antibody responses in all studies was performed for each HA contained in the vaccine and 
active control according to the criteria related to post-vaccination HAI GMT, seroconversion rates and 
proportion of subjects with post-vaccination HAI titers ≥ 40, as specified in the FDA Guidance for 
Industry.  
Post hoc analyses of HAI titers using additional criteria, including post-vaccination fold-increase in HAI 
GMT and plots of Reverse Cumulative Distribution Curves, as described in EMA Guidelines were 
performed for this dossier. Subsequently, the applicant also provided a subset of 100 vaccinees per 
arm (RIV4 and IIV4) each of PSC12 and PSC16 for seroneutralizing antibody response assessment. 
These post hoc analyses, as described in the EMA Guidelines in effect since 2014, show close 
comparability of HAI immune responses between RIV4 and IIV4 as were shown in the previous pre-
specified analysis. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considers that all aspects dealing with clinical pharmacology have been well addressed by 
the applicant. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The applicant presented three phase III studies (PSC12, PSC16, PSC04) to be used to support the 
effective use of RIV4 in subjects 18 years of age and older for the present application. PSC12 and 
PSC16 were pivotal studies that were run with RIV4 in older adults ≥50 years and young adults 18 to 
49 years of age, respectively, to demonstrate vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity of RIV4, whereas 
PSC04 was a supportive study conducted with RIV3 to establish vaccine efficacy in young healthy 
adults from 18 to 49 years of age. 
The virus strains selected for the RIV4 and the RIV3 were in compliance with the seasonal influenza 
WHO recommendations for influenza vaccine strains chosen for each influenza seasons. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The clinical development plan for RIV4 did not include formal dose selection in a phase II study. The 
applicant explains that the dose of 45 mcg rHA per strain is approved in the USA for use in adults 18 
years of age and older and the safety and immunogenicity of the RIV4 were expected to be similar to 
the US licensed trivalent formulation RIV3. 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 33/99 
 
 
 
The applicant’s choice of 45 mcg rHA per strain for RIV4 appears to be justifiable, considering the fact 
that it was a licensed dose for RIV3. The similarity of manufacturing process for RIV4 vs RIV3, and the 
discussion provided by the applicant regarding the results of previous clinical studies with monovalent, 
bivalent and trivalent rHAs.  
In the frame of RIV3 development, two Phase II clinical trials were conducted to establish the optimal 
dose of rHA in comparison to licensed, egg-grown inactivated influenza vaccine. Dose selection was 
based on pharmacodynamics determined by the measured humoral immune response. The doses of 
rHA evaluated in the early trials were multiples of 15 µg in order to compare with licensed influenza 
vaccines. 
Two Phase II clinical trials were conducted to establish the optimal dose of rHA ( 
Table 5). The first trial (DMID-03-119) was conducted in adults 65 years of age and older, due to the 
recognised medical need for influenza vaccines with improved efficacy in this age group. This trial, 
conducted by the United States of America (USA) National Institutes of Health Division of Microbiology 
and Infectious Diseases (DMID), evaluated rHA doses of 15, 45 and 135 µg of each antigen compared 
with trivalent inactivated vaccine (IIV3). Immunogenicity was determined by geometric mean HAI 
titers to each antigen before and approximately 28 days following a single injection.  
The second dose-finding trial (PSC01), was a placebo-controlled study in adults 18-49 years of age. 
The RIV3 contained 15 or 45 µg rHA for influenza A/H1 and influenza B, to evaluate a dose-response 
for these antigens that had not been apparent in the earlier study, and 45 µg rHA for influenza A/H3 
antigen, as this dose had been established as the optimal dose in the earlier study.

Results of HAI titers in the DMID-03-119 study (adults ≥65 years of age) were reported according to 
GMTs within each vaccine group. The authors concluded that the HAI immune response in these older 
adults was dose-related for influenza A/H3 and considerably more robust than that induced by IIV3. By 
contrast, there was not a clear dose-response to influenza A/H1 or B. They further concluded that rHA 
doses of 45 µg and higher provided the optimal immune response to influenza A/H1 and B and perhaps 
a level of immunogenicity for influenza A/H3 superior to that of conventional inactivated vaccine. 
In the 2nd study (PSC01) designed to evaluate a possible dose-response to influenza A/H1 and B 
versus placebo, the HAI immunogenicity was assessed by the proportion of subjects experiencing a 4-
fold rise in HAI titer. Both dose levels of rHA A/H1 and B induced HAI responses (4-fold rise) in the 
majority of subjects, but the geometric means of titers (GMTs) were higher for the 45 µg per antigen 
formulation.  
After conducting both studies, the authors concluded that “further development of the rHA vaccine 
should use a formulation of 45 µg per component, and future studies should directly compare the 
safety and immunogenicity of this dose with that of inactivated vaccine”.

Objectives 
Primary objective 
• 
To compare the clinical efficacy of RIV4 to that of IIV4, with respect to the ratio of attack 
rates of rtPCR-confirmed protocol-defined ILI that begin at least 14 days after vaccination 
caused by any influenza viral types/subtypes. 
Secondary objectives 
• 
• 
To compare the protective efficacy in prevention of respiratory illness and influenza 
infection beginning at least 14 days after vaccination among RIV4 recipients vs. IIV4 
recipients using several alternative case definitions. 
To compare immunogenicity of RIV4 vs. IIV4 in a preselected subset of subjects adequate 
to compare post-vaccination HAI GMTs and SCRs for all four antigens in each study 
vaccine. All comparisons were designed to demonstrate non-inferior immunogenicity 
according to CBER criteria. 
• 
To compare the safety and reactogenicity of RIV4 vs. IIV4. 
Exploratory objectives 
• 
Efficacy and safety/reactogenicity will be assessed by subgroups defined by age category, 
gender, and race/ethnicity, and the receipt of influenza vaccination in the prior year, as 
exploratory analyses. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
• 
rtPCR-confirmed, protocol-defined ILI3 caused by any influenza strain that begins at least 
14 days post-vaccination. 
Key secondary efficacy and immunogenicity endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
rtPCR-confirmed CDC-defined ILI4 that begins at least 14 days post-vaccination caused by 
any influenza strain. 
culture-confirmed protocol-defined ILI that begins at least 14 days post-vaccination caused 
by an influenza strain antigenically matched to those strains represented in the study 
vaccines. 
culture-confirmed CDC-defined ILI that begins at least 14 days post-vaccination caused by 
an influenza strain antigenically matched to those in the study vaccines. 
post-vaccination HAI GMTs and SCR for all four antigens in a preselected subset of 
subjects. 
3 Protocol-defined ILI is defined as at least one of the following respiratory symptoms (sore throat, cough, sputum 
production, wheezin, difficulty breathing) accompanied by at least one of the following systemic symptoms (fever >37.2°C 
(99.0°F), chills (shivering), tiredness (fatigue), headache and myalgia (muscle ache). 
4 CDC-defined ILI is defined as body temperature ≥100°F accompanied by cough and/or sore throat on the same or 
consecutive days.

Sample size 
The study was planned to be performed with 4,311 patients per group. The primary objective of the 
study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of rVE of RIV4 vs. IIV4. The non-inferiority margin was set to 
be -0.2. Assuming an influenza attack rate (AR) of 2% in IIV and 1.53% in RIV4 recipients, 
respectively, a significance level of 0.05, 4,311 evaluable subjects per group would be required to 
demonstrate non-inferiority with 80% power, with lower bound of the two-sided 95%CI around rVE of 
>-0.20 (-20%). A total of 9,000 subjects were enrolled to account for 4-5% loss to follow-up. The 
number of patients actually randomised was 4,474 for RIV4 and 4,489 patients for IIV4. The sample 
size for serology subset of ~520 subjects provided >80% power to determine non-inferiority. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised 1:1 via a centralised Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) on Day 0 of 
their participation in the study. The IWRS system ensured balanced enrolment across the age 
categories of 50-64, 65-74 and ≥75 years and balanced treatment assignment across study sites. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an observer-blind study. The subjects and the study personnel who performed study 
assessments after vaccination were blinded to treatment assignment. There was only one unblinded 
study member who administered study vaccine to the subject, who was not involved in subsequent 
assessments. Study assessments were conducted by a blinded investigator. 
Statistical methods 
The primary hypothesis for this trial is that the efficacy of RIV4 was non-inferior to licensed IIV4, 
based on the relative efficacy in prevention of rtPCR-confirmed influenza-like illness. If non-inferiority 
was demonstrated, the efficacy of RIV4 was tested as an exploratory analysis for superiority over 
licensed IIV4, based on the incidence of rtPCR-confirmed protocol-defined influenza-like illness. 
Analysis set for efficacy 
The efficacy population included all randomised subjects who received study vaccine and provided any 
follow-up documentation for ILI beginning at least 14 days following vaccine administration. Subjects 
were analyzed according to the vaccine received, regardless of the vaccine group to which they were 
randomised. The efficacy population did not include subjects with significant protocol deviations. The 
efficacy population was used for all analyses of efficacy endpoints. 
Statistical methods for efficacy 
The ILI confirmed by a positive nasopharyngeal rt-PCR test for influenza virus of any strain that begins 
at least 14 days after vaccination was the primary efficacy endpoint. The rVE against this endpoint was 
determined as rVE = 1- relative risk (RR) = 1- (attack rate (AR)RIV4/attack rate (AR)IIV4) x 100. 
Farrington and Manning’s score method was used to compute the CI around rVE. Non-inferiority was 
established if the lower bound of the two-sided 95%CI for VE is greater than the non-inferiority margin 
of -0.20.  
Analysis set for immunogenicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 38/99 
 
 
 
 
The immunogenicity population included all randomised subjects at the specific study sites pre-selected 
for serology, who received study vaccine, provided serum samples on Days 0 and 28, and had no 
significant protocol deviations. Subjects were analysed according to the vaccine received, regardless of 
the vaccine group to which they were randomised. 
Statistical methods for immunogenicity 
The analyses of non-inferiority, superiority and descriptive analyses were based on results obtained 
with the HAI assay. 
Post-vaccination HAI titers from a subset of approximately 520 subjects were compared between RIV4 
subjects and IIV4 subjects using the criteria for non-inferiority defined by CBER for the difference in 
seroconversion rates and the ratio of GMTs of IIV4/RIV4: 
• 
• 
The upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI on the difference between the seroconversion 
rates (% Seroconversion (licensed vaccine) - % Seroconversion(RIV4) should not exceed 
10 percentage points. 
The upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI on the ratio of the GMTs (GMT [licensed 
vaccine]/GMT[RIV4)) should not exceed 1.5. 
The computation of the CI for the difference in seroconversion rates utilised Farrington and Manning’s 
score method. 
The ratios of the GMTs were calculated as the antilog of the difference between 2 mean log-
transformed titers. The 95% CI was calculated as the antilog of the 95% confidence limits of the log-
transformed titers.  
Non-inferiority of immune responses across the entire age spectrum was concluded when the criteria 
specified above were met.

Of the 9,003 subjects enrolled and randomised, 8,988 received a dose of study vaccine. 15 randomised 
subjects did not receive study vaccine due to withdrawal before vaccination and 25 randomised 
subjects at study site 44 received a dose of study vaccine but the identity of which could not be 
verified from site records, yielding a total randomised population for final analysis of 8,963 subjects 
(4,474 RIV4, 4,489 IIV4). 
Overall, the number of subjects included in efficacy analyses was high and only small fraction of 
vaccinated subjects were excluded. Of the 4,474 RIV4 recipients, 4,303 (96.2%) provided any follow-
up data for ILI and had no major protocol deviations, were included for clinical efficacy analyses. 4,228 
(94.5%) completed the study. Of the 4,489 IIV4 recipients, 4,301 (95.8%) were included in efficacy 
population and 4,236 (94.4%) completed the study. 
For both treatment groups, the most common reason for discontinuation of study was lost-to-follow up 
(176 [3.9%] RIV4 and 172 [3.8%] IIV4 recipients), followed by voluntary withdrawal unrelated to AE 
(53 [1.2%] RIV4 and 61 [1.4%] IIV4 recipients). 
The small subset for immunogenicity analysis was pre-selected from each treatment group, including 
314 RIV4 and 300 IIV4 recipients.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 40 sites dispersed geographically across the US during the study period 
from October 22, 2014 (first subject enrolled) to May 22, 2015 (last subject completed). 
Conduct of the study 
Of the 8,963 randomised subjects, 251 (2.8%) were categorised as having “major” protocol deviations 
that led to subjects being excluded from the efficacy analyses (Table 7). The most common major 
protocol deviations represented failure to be evaluated with NP swab in the context of symptoms of an 
influenza-like illness. The two treatment groups were well-balanced with respect to the number and 
types of protocol deviations. 
Table 7: PSC12 -- Major Protocol Deviations 
Baseline data 
Subjects in both treatment groups were ambulatory medically-stable adults aged 50 years and older. 
The majority of subjects were white, non-Hispanic, and there was a slight majority of females. 
Approximately 40% of subjects in this trial were ≥65 years. 
There were no notable differences in demographic characteristics of subjects with post-randomization 
data between the two treatment groups.

The baseline data for comparing the immunogenicity subset was not presented. The applicant noted 
the randomization via IWRS to ensure a balance of treatment group across study sites. 
Numbers analysed 
As part of clinical efficacy determination, 4,303 RIV4 recipients and 4,301 IIV4 recipients met the 
efficacy population definition (per Protocol) that was used for all clinical efficacy analyses. In total, 234 
subjects, including 96 RIV4 and 138 IIV4 recipients developed protocol-defined ILI and had positive rt-
PCR for influenza. Of these, 159 subjects who met the criteria for protocol-defined ILI were 
subsequently confirmed by culture, including 58 RIV4 and 101 IIV4 recipients. 
It was mentioned that 4 ILI cases were hospitalised with documented influenza A infection, including 3 
IIV4 and 1 RIV4 recipients. 
In total, 314 RIV4 and 300 IIV4 recipients were analysed for the immunogenicity endpoints.

Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results are presented only for the per protocol population. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for PSC12 was met. The attack rates of rtPCR confirmed protocol-defined 
ILI occurring at least 14 days after vaccination were 2.2% (n=96) among 4,303 RIV4 recipients and 
3.2% (n=138) among 4,301 IIV4 recipients, yielding a rVE of +30% (95%CI: +10, 47%), thus 
meeting the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion. 
The applicant also stated that this rVE from the primary endpoint met the pre-specified criterion for 
superiority (lower bound of 95%CI >+9.0%). . 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint – occurrence of rtPCR confirmed CDC-ILI met the non-inferiority 
criterion but unmet the superiority criterion. rVE was +32% (95%CI: +8, 54%). 
The time to rtPCR-confirmed, protocol-defined ILI further confirmed a consistently reduced attack rate 
among RIV4 recipients as compared with IIV4 recipients that became apparent within 2-4 weeks of 
vaccination and persisted throughout the influenza season (Figure 1).

Figure 1: PSC12 – Time to rt-PCR-confirmed, protocol-defined ILI 
An increase of B activity late in the season can be determined from the time to rt-PCR confirmed ILI 
curves provided according to vaccine and A or B strain infection (Figure 2). 
Figure 2: PSC12 – Time to rt-PCR-confirmed, protocol-defined ILI due to Influenza A and B 
Two other key secondary efficacy endpoints – occurrence of culture-confirmed influenza due to 
antigenically matched strains in association with protocol-defined ILI or CDC-ILI, were not analyzed, as 
the virus cultures did not provide adequate titers of viruses for antigenic similarity testing.

For the secondary immunogenicity endpoints, pre- and post-vaccination (Day 28) HAI titers and 38 
days post-vaccination for each strain, from a subset of subjects (N= 614) were analysed. The results 
are included in the table below. 
Table 10: PSC12: Comparison of post-vaccination HAI GMTs – Adults ≥ 50 years of age
* Figures in bold meet criterion for non-inferiority (upper limit of 2-sided 95% CI of GMR < 1.5) 
Table 11: PSC12: HAI seroconversion rates – Adults ≥ 50 years of age 
* Figures in bold meet CBER criteria for non-inferiority 
RIV4 met the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion vs IIV4 with respect to the differences in HAI SCRs 
for 2 of the 4 strains (A/Texas, B/Massachusetts), while the post-vaccination HAI GMT ratio endpoint 
met non-inferiority criterion for 3 of the 4 strains (A/California, A/Texas, B/Massachusetts), according 
to the CBER criteria. 
Overall, RIV4 induced robust HAI response to A/H3 strain, but blunted responses to influenza B strains. 
The HAI response to B/Brisbane was lower in RIV4 than in IIV4 recipients. The clinical relevance of this 
difference is unknown. In general, these data is well consistent with clinical efficacy results. 
Ancillary analyses 
A post-hoc analysis was carried out on the occurrence of culture-confirmed protocol-defined ILI due to 
any influenza strain, meeting both non-inferiority and superiority criteria. The rVE was estimated to be 
43% (95%CI: +21, 59%) in the efficacy population. 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 45/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional post-hoc analysis on the primary efficacy endpoint showed that the rVE of RIV4 over IIV4 
was apparent for influenza A strains especially A/H3 strain, whereas rVE for influenza B was not 
conclusive due to limited cases. The rVE against influenza A strain was estimated to be +36% (95%CI: 
+14, 53%), and rVE against influenza B was +4% (95%CI: -72, 46%). 
Data on subgroup analyses according to age, gender and other categories of demographics generally 
point in the same direction as the primary analysis. The point estimates for rVE were mostly positive 
but with some variability between genders, races and ethnicities. The CIs were wide and no meaningful 
conclusion can be drawn. rVE point estimate was higher in subjects aged 50-64 years than in subjects 
≥65 years, and 95% CI for older subjects was wide and encompassed zero. The applicant stated that 
between the RIV4 and IIV4 recipients, no conclusive difference in efficacy of two vaccines could be 
demonstrated based on age category. 
The impact of prior influenza vaccination status was evaluated in exploratory analysis, showing greater 
rVE in subjects who had not received influenza vaccines in the prior year than in the study population 
as a whole. Among 3,994 subjects (2,006 RIV4 and 1,988 IIV4 recipients) who reported not having 
received a flu vaccine in the prior season, the rVE was +48% (95%CI: +16, 68%). 
The impact of underlying medical illness on rVE was explored in an post-hoc analysis. RIV4 was shown 
to be more effective than IIV4 in subjects with underlying conditions, although this RIV4 benefit is 
higher in subjects with no underlying conditions than in subjects with underlying conditions. 
The applicant clarified that the pre-specified exploratory efficacy analyses on the influenza-related 
complications such as hospitalizations, deaths and pneumonia in PSC12, were not performed, due to 
the absence or not sufficient data to warrant a health economic assessment. There were 4 influenza-
related hospitalization cases, which were categorised as SAEs, because these subjects were not tested 
according to the protocol. Due to distribution of these cases (1 in RIV4 vs 3 in IIV4), it is agreed that 
excluding these cases from primary analysis would not bias the results towards rejecting the null 
hypothesis and thus study conclusion holds.

Treatments 
Two vaccines were tested in the trial: 
• 
• 
Group A: RIV4 (Flublok Quadrivalent) containing 4x45μg (180μg total) of rHA derived from 
influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 and two influenza B viruses in a total volume of 0.5mL 
provided in pre-filled syringes, or 
Group B: IIV4 (Fluarix Quadrivalent) containing 4x15μg (60 μg total), of quadrivalent, 
inactivated influenza vaccine (licensed IIV4) containing influenza antigen derived from 
A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 and two influenza B viruses in a total volume of 0.5mL provided in 
pre-filled syringes. 
IIV4 and rHAs were derived from the following influenza viruses that were identified by the FDA’s 
Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee as the four strains (or “like viruses”) to 
be included in quadrivalent influenza vaccines for the 2014-2015 season:

Objectives 
Primary Objective 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 47/99 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
To demonstrate non-inferior immunogenicity of the four antigens in the RIV4 formulation 
to the corresponding antigens in the licensed IIV4. This was to be accomplished through 
the evaluation of the ratio of post-vaccination HAI GMT to each of the four antigens and 
the difference in HAI seroconversion rates to the same four antigens. 
Evaluations utilised CBER criteria for non-inferiority of HAI GMTs and seroconversion rates. 
• 
A second objective is to compare the safety profiles of RIV4 and US-licensed IIV4. 
Secondary Objectives: 
• 
To evaluate the HAI seroconversion rates and % with post-vaccination HAI titers ≥40 
(seroprotection rates) against the four rHA antigens contained in the quadrivalent 
formulation with respect to CBER criteria for licensure under accelerated approval 
regulations. 
• 
To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of RIV4 in adults 18-49 years of age. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary immunogenicity endpoint: 
The study had eight co-primary endpoints: 
• 
• 
HAI seroconversion rates at Day 28 to each of the four antigens contained in the study 
vaccine 
HAI GMTs at Day 28 to each of the four antigens contained in the study vaccine 
These measurements were compared between the two vaccine groups according to CBER criteria for 
non-inferiority. HAI seroconversion is defined as the percentage of subjects with either a pre-
vaccination HI titer < 1:10 and a post-vaccination HI titer ≥1:40 or a pre-vaccination HI titer ≥1:10 
and a minimum four fold rise in post-vaccination HI antibody titer. 
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints: 
• 
Seroconversion rates and seroprotection to all four antigens in RIV4, assessed according to 
CBER criteria for licensure under accelerated approval regulations: 
o  For adults <65 years of age, the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the percent 
of subjects achieving seroconversion for HAI antibody should meet or exceed 40%. The 
lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the percent of subjects achieving an HAI 
antibody titer ≥ 1:40 (seroprotection) should meet or exceed 70%. 
Incidence and severity of solicited local and solicited systemic events of reactogenicity and 
body temperature reported via Memory Aid A during Days 0-7 following vaccine 
administration. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and other unsolicited AEs and MAEs occurring during the 28 
days following vaccine administration. 
SAEs and MAEs occurring up to 6 months post-vaccination. 
• 
• 
• 
Immunogenicity: The antigens used in the HAI assay were the egg-derived versions of the HA in RIV4, 
i.e. A/California/07/2009, not A/Christchurch/16/2010, an antigenically similar H1 strain that was

Sample size 
The sample size proposed for this study is ~1,000 for the RIV4 group and ~350 for the US-licensed 
IIV4 control (total 1,350 subjects). This allowed for a retention rate of ~98%, assuring adequate 
power for the non-inferior immunogenicity analyses. This was a reasonable retention rate based on 
clinical trials conducted by PSC. In order to accumulate a safety database on RIV4 of ~1,000 subjects, 
randomization of ~1,350 subjects in a 3:1 ratio assured at least 80% power for evaluation of the co-
primary comparisons. These calculations assumed HAI titer variability ≤1.5, and the criterion for GMT 
ratios ≤1.5. 
Randomisation 
Randomization assignments were centralised. Subjects were to receive their allocated treatment of 
RIV4 or IIV4 according to a SAS-generated randomization schedule. Following determination of 
eligibility, subjects were to be randomised in a 3:1 ratio to RIV4 or US-licensed IIV4.  
Blinding (masking) 
Neither the investigator nor the subject was planned to be aware of the treatment assignment until the 
study was completed. An unblinded person (provided he or she was not involved in any study 
assessments) or site staff was to administer study vaccine according to the label information on the 
syringe. Study personnel who performed study assessments after vaccination were blinded to 
treatment assignment. 
Statistical methods 
The primary non-inferiority immunogenicity analyses for this trial was based on the modified Per-
Protocol (mPP) population. The primary immunogenicity population (mPP) included all randomised 
subjects who received a dose of study vaccine, provided serum samples for baseline (Day 0) and Day 
28 HAI titers within specified time frames for those study days and had no major protocol deviations 
that might be expected to adversely affect the immune response.  
For the primary endpoint of the GMT ratio, non-inferiority was planned to be established for each 
antigen if the upper bound of a two-sided 95% CI for ratio of 2 vaccine groups GMT ratios did not 
exceed 1.5. The ratio of the GMTs were to be calculated as the antilog of the difference between two 
mean log-transformed titers. The 95% CI were to be calculated as the antilog of the 95% confidence 
limits of the log transformed titers. 
For the primary endpoint of the seroconversion rate, non-inferiority for each antigen was planned to be 
established if the upper bound of a two-sided 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates did not 
exceed 10 percentage points. The computation of the confidence interval for the difference in 
seroconversion rates was planned following Farrington and Manning’s score method. To control the 
experiment wise error rate, all eight null hypotheses needed to be rejected at a nominal significance 
level of 0.025 to achieve statistical significance for any single endpoint.

Of the 1,350 subjects who were enrolled and randomised, all received a dose of study vaccine. Overall, 
the rate of retention of subjects was very high (>95%); of the 63 subjects who did not complete the 
study, 49 were lost to follow-up, 11 withdrew consent and 3 terminated for other reasons. No subject 
discontinued due to an adverse event. 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 10 sites dispersed geographically across the US during the study period 
from October 22, 2014 (first subject enrolled) to May 14, 2015 (last subject completed). 
Conduct of the study 
No changes from the original protocol were made in the conduct of this study and no changes were 
implemented from the original Statistical Analysis Plan.

Of the 1,350 randomised subjects, 35 (2.6%) represented a major protocol deviation that excluded the 
subject from the immunogenicity analyses (Table 13). The most common reason for exclusion from the 
immunogenicity analysis was that the subject missed the visit at which serology samples were to be 
obtained.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Immunogenicity Analyses 
Non-inferiority of Seroconversion Rates 
The primary endpoint of seroconversion rates (SCR) for each of the four antigens represented in the 
study vaccines and the differences between SCR in the two treatment groups are shown Table 16.  
Non-inferiority, defined as an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in SCR 
[IIV4 minus RIV4] ≤10%, was demonstrated for seroconversion among RIV4 recipients for 
A/H1/California, A/ H3/Texas and B/Massachusetts. The seroconversion rate to B/Brisbane among 
RIV4 was less robust and did not meet the criterion for non-inferiority.

Immunogenicity population 
Non-inferiority of post-vaccination HAI GMTs 
The co-primary endpoint of non-inferior post-vaccination HAI GMTs demonstrated satisfactory rises in 
GMT among RIV4 recipients for A/H1/California, A/H3/Texas and B/Massachusetts (Table 17). The 
Assessment report

post-vaccination GMTs for these three antigens were non-inferior by the criterion of an upper bound of 
the 95% confidence interval around the ratio of GMT IIV4 / GMT RIV4 ≤1.5.

Table 17: PSC16: Pre- and post-vaccination HAI GMTs – Immunogenicity population 
Seroconversion rate and GMT-ratio for each strain were co-primary endpoints and non-inferiority 
according to CBER criteria could be shown for both A strains as well as for B/Yamagata. For B/Victoria 
however, in line with results observed in trial PSC12, both seroconversion and GMT data were 
markedly worse than for the comparator. Seroconversion was achieved by 40.6% (95% CI: 37.4, 
43.7) of subjects treated with RIV4 in contrast to 58.2% (95% CI: 52.6, 63.6) of subjects who had 
received IIV4. GMT values were 43 (95% CI: 40, 46) for RIV4 recipients and 64 (95% CI: 58, 72) for 
IIV4 recipients. These results illustrate that the upper bounds of the confidence intervals for the 
recombinant vaccine were below the lower bounds of the CIs for the egg-derived vaccine, leading to 
the conclusion that the immunogenicity for B/Victoria falls short of the magnitude of response expected 
from an influenza vaccine. While antibody titres are only surrogates for clinical efficacy and 
haemagglutinin assays may produce a different readout for an egg-derived versus a recombinant 
antigen, immunogenicity data consistently cannot demonstrate NI for B/Victoria. This issue is not 
evident for B/Yamagata.  
Additional data subsequently submitted by the applicant however indicate, that there is not a general 
weakness regarding B/Victoria lineage immunogenicity in RIV4. 
In a study, performed in Hong Kong during the 2017-2018 influenza season in adults 65 to 82 years of 
age (Cowling BJ et al), immunogenicity of RIV 4 was compared with the immunogenicity of an IIV4 
standard dose vaccine, a MF59 adjuvanted trivalent vaccine, and a High Dose IIV3. HAI showed that 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 54/99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
RIV4 immunogenicity was comparable to the immunogenicity of the IIV4 vaccine for all strains 
including responses to the B/Victoria lineage, B/Brisbane/60/2008 strain. 
Table 18: Summary of pre- and post-vaccination antibody titers and fold rises in each 
vaccination group 
Another study (Belongia et al 2020. Clinical Trial number: NCT02872311) evaluated the 
immunogenicity performance of RIV4 compared to Fluzone high dose IIV3 and adjuvanted-IIV3 after 
standard-dose IIV3 the season prior, in individuals 65-74 years of age. The study was performed over 
2 seasons 2016-2017, 2017-2108 when the B/Victoria lineage strain in vaccine TIV and QIV 
formulations was the same strain used in the pivotal RIV4 trials, B/Brisbane/60/2008. HAI titers were 
measured at 28 days post vaccination in the second season of the study as well as influenza attack 
rates, both stratified by vaccine types. The results for the influenza B strain, B/Brisbane/60/2008 were 
comparable to the Fluzone HD and adjuvanted IIV3 results in this older age group. 
Whilst a potential for underpowering is given, it needs to be noted that sample size eventually sufficed 
to bring up statistical evidence for RIV4 being not non-inferior to IIV4 in terms of immunogenic 
response for strain B/Victoria. 
In order to complete assessment of the primary non-inferiority investigations, an ITT analysis was 
performed, and results were submitted subsequently. Due to the small difference in subject numbers 
between the ITT set and the mPP set, no noteworthy divergencies appear. 
Secondary Immunogenicity Analyses 
Seroconversion Rates to each Study Vaccine 
Seroconversion rates were also assessed by CBER criteria under accelerated approval regulations 
(Table 19). The criterion for an acceptable magnitude of seroconversion (lower bound of the 95% 
confidence interval ≥40%) was met in the RIV4 group for A/H1/California, A/H3/Texas and 
B/Massachusetts. The criterion was not met for B/Brisbane.

Page 55/99 
 
 
 
 
Proportion of Subjects with Post Vaccination HAI Titer ≥40 
Another criterion for approval of seasonal influenza vaccines under accelerated approval regulations is 
the proportion of individuals who have a post-vaccination HAI titer of ≥40 (Table 20). The criterion for 
this parameter in adults <65 years of age is a lower bound of the 95% confidence interval that meets 
or exceeds 70%. 
Table 20: PSC16 -- Proportion of Subjects with Post Vaccination HAI Titer ≥40 at Day 28
The secondary immunogenicity analyses demonstrate that the B/Victoria component of RIV4 is not 
able to meet the FDA immunogenicity criteria as defined in the FDA Guidance for Industry. Results for 
seroconversion and seroprotection rates are consistently below those of the comparator vaccine. The 
B/Yamagata component on the other hand has no such difficulties, even though it is evaluated against 
an egg-derived antigen in a similar fashion.

Ancillary analyses 
The Per Protocol population was defined in the protocol, but that analysis was overlooked by the CRO 
statisticians in their initial analysis of the trial. The PP analysis was performed as a sensitivity analysis 
during the review period at the reminder of the FDA. The results apparently confirmed the mPP 
population analysis. 
An analysis of the GMTs of IIV4/RIV4 (GMRs) at day 28, and difference between groups for 
seroconversion rates for the immunogenicity population, was provided, as well as for the revised 
immunogenicity population and the per-protocol immunogenicity population. The values for GMTs and 
seroconversion rates do not reveal meaningful differences. It is agreed, that there is no effect on the 
study “noninferiority” outcome. All endpoints are met in all populations, except B/Brisbane (B/Victoria-
lineage), which was not met in all population.

Women of child-bearing potential had to have a negative urine pregnancy test results at the time of 
randomization and had to be willing to use an adequate form of contraception during the course of the 
study. 
Treatments 
Two vaccines were tested in the trial: 
•  RIV3 (Flublok): each 0.5 mL dose of RIV3 contained 135µg of rHA, consisting of 45µg each of 
rHA derived from the respective influenza viruses for the 2007-2008 formulation: A/Solomon 
Islands/3/2006 (H1N1), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2), and B/Malaysia/2506/2004.  
Note: Flublok assignment will be further stratified into three lots: A, B and C at all sites. 
• 
Placebo consisted of normal saline for injection, USP.  
According to treatment assignment, a single IM injection of the RIV3 (total 135 mcg rHA from 3 strains 
containing 45 mcg per strain) or placebo, in a total volume of 0.5 mL, will be administered into the 
non-dominant deltoid muscle. 
Objectives 
Primary 
•  Efficacy: to determine the absolute efficacy of a single dose of RIV3 containing 135μg of total 
recombinant haemagglutinin (rHA) (45μg per strain) in the prevention of culture-confirmed 
symptomatic influenza meeting the case definition of CDC-ILI due to strains represented in the 
vaccine in a population of healthy adults aged 18-49 years. 
• 
Lot consistency: to demonstrate clinical consistency among three different lots of FluBlok 
administered during the study. The primary immunogenicity hypothesis is that for each strain 
contained within FluBlok, the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of post-vaccination geometric mean 
titers (GMTs) of HI antibody for Lot A vs. B, Lot A vs. C and Lot B vs. C will all fall within 0.67 
to 1.5. 
•  Safety: to determine the safety relative to placebo of a single dose of RIV3 containing 135μg of 
total rHA as determined by the rates of adverse events (AEs) and the observation of systemic 
and local reactions 
Secondary 
•  Efficacy: to determine the efficacy, relative to Placebo, of a single dose of RIV3 containing 
135μg of total rHA in the prevention of culture-confirmed respiratory illness (regardless of 
CDC-ILI) due to strains represented in the vaccine 
•  Seroconversion rate: Post-vaccination titer of ≥1:40 in subjects with undetectable baseline 
antibody (HI titer <1:10) or a >4-fold rise in antibody in subjects with a baseline titer of 
≥1:10, with the achievement of post-vaccination titer of at least 1:40. For adults <65 years of 
age, the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI should meet or exceed 40% 
•  Seroprotection rate: Post-vaccination titer of ≥1:40. For adults <65 years of age, the lower 
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI should meet or exceed 70%.

•  Efficacy: to determine the efficacy, relative to Placebo, of a single dose of RIV3 containing 
135μg of total rHA in prevention of culture-confirmed CDC-ILI due to any strain of influenza 
•  Efficacy: to determine the efficacy, relative to Placebo, of a single dose of RIV3 in prevention 
of all episodes of CDC-ILI or respiratory illness occurring during the surveillance period, 
regardless of culture results

• 
•

of ≥40; 28 days after vaccination 
Exploratory endpoints: 
• 
• 
development of CDC-ILI with a positive NS/TS culture for any influenza virus strain obtained 
during the acute illness episode 
development of CDC-ILI during the surveillance period regardless of culture results 
Sample size 
Based on previous studies it was estimated that RIV3 was at least 70% efficacious relative to Placebo, 
as measured by protective efficacy (PE). A Placebo attack rate of 3% or greater was expected 
(influenza culture positive). This trial was powered to establish that the lower bound of the 95% 
confidence interval for PE is greater than 40%. The sample size chosen for this study was 4,318 
randomised 1:1 (RIV3=2,159, Placebo= 2,159). This test has approximately 80% power with α = 0.05 
to achieve its goal assuming a total sample size of 4,318 accounting for a 5% attrition rate (post-
attrition samples sizes of at least: RIV3=2,051, Placebo= 2,051).  
Randomisation 
All subjects were stratified prior to randomization based on whether receipt (y/n) of influenza vaccine 
during the 2006-2007 influenza season. All subjects were randomised 1:1 to either RIV3 or Placebo 
and to maintain a 1:1:1 ratio of RIV3 clinical lots A, B and C. The randomised treatment schedule was 
prepared by a Biostatistician using the block method with a block size of 6.

Blinding (masking) 
The study is a modified double-blind. The study vaccine was administered by an unblinded person who 
was not involved in subsequent assessment. Neither the subjects nor the study personnel who 
performed study assessments after vaccination were aware of the treatment assignment until the 
study was over. 
Statistical methods 
The efficacy for subjects was computed as follows for the RIV3 and Placebo treatment groups:  
VE = 100 x (1 – relative risk of subjects having culture-confirmed CDC-ILI) 
CDC-ILI = 1 – attack rate RIV3/attack rate placebo 
The efficacy analysis population consists of all subjects that met study entry criteria, received vaccine 
as assigned, and who made at least 50% of telephone contacts during the surveillance period, 
including the EIOS call. 
The primary efficacy hypothesis was that the efficacy of RIV3 against culture-confirmed CDC-ILI due to 
influenza strains antigenically resembling the vaccine exceeded 40%, with 95% confidence. This trial 
was powered to establish that the lower bound of the 95%CI for vaccine efficacy was greater than 
40%. 
Immunogenicity analysis population consists of all subjects who met the study entry criteria and had 
HAI titers taken at baseline (Day 0) and after vaccination (Day 28). 
Safety analysis population included all randomised subjects who received study vaccine according to 
the treatment (RIV3 or Placebo) actually received.

Results 
Participant flow 
All 4,648 randomised subjects received the treatments, including 2,344 RIV3 recipients and 2,304 
Placebo recipients, and were used as efficacy population for clinical efficacy analyses. 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted in the US during the study period from September 2007 (first subject 
enrolled) to May 2008 (last subject completed). 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol deviation that occurred during the study was provided. 
Baseline data 
The study subjects that constitute safety population (and efficacy population) were healthy young 
adults. The median age was 32 years for both RIV3 and Placebo treatment groups. The majority of 
subjects were females (59% in each group) and white (67% RIV3, 66% Placebo). The proportions of 
black subjects, Hispanic subjects and other race/ethnicity were similar between RIV3 and Placebo 
groups.

The demographic characteristics of subjects included in immunogenicity subset for interim analysis did 
not show notable differences to the overall safety (and efficacy) population. 
Table 22: PSC04 – Summary of Demographics and Other baseline characteristics – Safety

Numbers analysed 
All 4,648 randomised subjects received the treatments, including 2,344 RIV3 recipients and 2,304 
Placebo recipients, and were used as efficacy population for clinical efficacy analyses. The most 
common reason for discontinuation was lost to follow-up (251 instances [89% of all discontinuations] 
in the Placebo group and 260 instances [88% of all discontinuations] in the RIV3 group). 
A total of 577 (12%) subjects discontinued prior to the completion of the study, including 282 Placebo 
recipients and 295 RIV3 recipients. 
In total, 391 RIV3 recipients had serum samples and were included in interim immunogenicity analysis 
and 448 evaluable at end of the study for immunogenicity endpoints. 
The numbers of subjects for safety analysis was 4,648, including 2,344 in RIV3 and 2,304 in Placebo 
treatment group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
During the study period, a total of 582 subjects reported a score of 2 or more on their flu symptoms 
Card, including 273 in RIV3 and 309 in Placebo treatment groups. Among them, positive cultures for 
influenza were evident in 178 subjects, including 64 RIV3 and 114 placebo recipients. Of these, a total 
of 122 subjects (69%), including 44 RIV3 and 78 placebo recipients, developed culture-confirmed CDC 
ILI, as defined by a fever of ≥100ºF oral accompanied by cough and/or sore throat, on the same day 
or on consecutive days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 62/99 
 
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint of study PSC04 was unmet. Only 1 subject with a positive culture due to 
a strain represented in the vaccine met CDC-ILI definition among RIV3 recipients versus 4 among the 
Placebo group, resulting in a point estimate of RIV3 efficacy of 75.4% (95%CI: -148.0, 99.5). 
The secondary efficacy endpoint of study PSC04 – development of culture-positive ILI regardless of 
CDC ILI definition, was unmet, either. With 2 subjects reporting culture-positive ILI due to matched 
strains in RIV3 vs 6 subjects in placebo recipients, giving rise to a rVE of 67.2% (95%CI: -83.2; 96.8). 
Both primary and secondary efficacy endpoints required that influenza strain isolated is antigenically 
similar to the HA of the strain included in the vaccine. However, the 2007-2008 influenza season was 
proven with characteristics of a suboptimal match for Type A strains, and a different lineage (i.e. 
B/Yamagata) for Type B. Only 8 of all virus isolates (<5%) from 179 subjects in PSC04 were 
antigenically related to the strains represented in RIV3, including none of 59 B isolates. Because of so 
few cases of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, it is impossible to accurately estimate the 
protective efficacy of RIV3 in PSC04. 
Evaluable populations for immunogenicity analysis included 391 RIV3 recipients for interim analysis 
and 448 recipients for additional analysis. 
Lot consistency could not be demonstrated for A/Wisconsin due to issues with the potency assay used 
for determination of rHA antigen content in the drug substance batches. Improved recalculation 
indicated that the H3 antigen (A/Wisconsin/67/2005) content in two of three lots was reduced by ~ 
1/3 of the intended amount (45µg) whereas other antigens exceeded the intended antigen amount by 
up to ~40%. 
For secondary immunogenicity endpoints, RIV3 met CBER immunogenicity criteria for all 3 strains, 
using both SCR (lower bound of 2-sided 95%CI exceeds 40%) and SPR (lower bound of the 2-sided 
95%CI exceeds 70%): 
•  H1: 78% (95%CI: 73.8, 82.2) for seroconversion rate and 98% (95%CI: 96.7, 99.4) for 
seroprotection rate. 
•  H3: 81% (95%CI: 76.3, 84.4) for seroconversion rate and 96% (95%CI: 94.1, 98.0) for 
seroprotection rate. 
•  B: 53% (95%CI: 48.1, 58.2) for seroconversion rate and 96% (95%CI: 93.4, 97.6) for 
seroprotection rate. 
However, immunogenicity results have to be interpreted with caution, as issues with the potency test 
to measure antigen content caused considerable variation in rHA amount contained in the different. 
Ancillary analyses 
Clinical efficacy of RIV3 was further explored on two pre-specified exploratory endpoints. The first - 
culture-positive CDC-ILI due to any strain of influenza was reported by 44 RIV3 and 78 Placebo 
recipients, resulting in an overall vaccine efficacy of 44.6% (95%CI: 18.8, 62.6). The second – CDC-
ILI regardless of culture results, developed in 127 RIV3 and 162 placebo recipients, yielding an efficacy 
of 22.9% (95%CI: 2.2, 39.4). 
Additional post-hoc exploratory analyses were performed on culture-positive influenza regardless of 
CDC-ILI and culture-positive CDC-ILI by influenza Type regardless of antigenic match, in order to 
compare these results with the results of published findings of vaccine efficacy reported during the 
2007-2008 influenza season. Although these analyses might provide some useful information, caution 
Assessment report

is needed to interpret these comparative data from different studies, due to differences in study 
design, trial population, statistical methods, and number of cases included in the subgroup analyses. 
Interestingly, post-hoc analysis according to time periods showed little or no protective efficacy of RIV3 
after Feb 8, 2008, corresponding to approximately 4-5 months after vaccination. The applicant is 
unable to explain the underlying mechanism except the assumption about a decline in cross-protective 
HAI antibodies.  The applicant claimed that RIV3 efficacy is higher or at least comparable to other 
licensed influenza vaccines during the 2007/2008 influenza season, and presented the results of 
another study conducted in 2017/2018 influenza season with older adults aged 65-74 years (Clinical 
Trial number: NCT02872311), showing that the HAI response to all three vaccine strains at month 6 
were similar in RIV4 vs aIIV3 and HD-IIV3.

Based on the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints the study 
shows that efficacy of RIV4 is non-inferior to that of IIV4. The RIV4 was 
30% more efficacious than IIV4 in preventing rt-PCR confirmed protocol-
defined ILI, and this was driven primarily by predominant efficacy against 
A/H3N2 strain.

Primary efficacy endpoint did not meet success criteria and secondary 
efficacy analysis was non-conclusive. Exploratory and post-hoc analyses 
describe moderate efficacy of RIV3 in preventing against culture-
confirmed CDC-ILI due to any strain, and this effect was driven by the 
predominant efficacy against influenza type A strains. Lot consistency 
analyses showed that three clinical lots did not meet pre-defined criteria 
for A/H3 strain, partially due to different amounts of Wisconsin rHA 
protein included in the three lots. Nonetheless, RIV3 is demonstrated 
immunogenic and meets CBER criteria for SCRs and SPRs. 
*using 448 subjects showed consistent results 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
To support this application, two pivotal phase 3 studies, PSC12 and PSC16, were submitted, aiming to 
show clinical efficacy of RIV4 in adults ≥50 (PSC12) years and clinical immunogenicity of RIV4 in 
adults 18 to 49 years (PSC16). Both studies compared RIV4 with a US and EU-licensed active 
comparator IIV4. In addition, a supportive study PSC04 conducted with RIV3 was included for adult 
18-49 years of age indication. The CHMP Scientific advice of the EMA (EMEA/H/SA/3849/1/2018/III) 
supported this program.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The designs of PSC12, PSC16 and PSC04 were adequate, all were conducted in the USA in accordance 
with GCP. 
In PSC12, of 9,003 randomised subjects, 8,963 received a known study vaccine and were included in 
the final analysis. 8,604 (96%) constituted efficacy population for the non-inferiority analysis. The 
number of subjects excluded from efficacy analyses was small (total 359) and well balanced between 
two treatment groups, including 251 subjects who had protocol deviation. In PSC04, a total of 4,648 
eligible subjects were randomised, all vaccinated and included in the efficacy analyses. 
Surveillance of lab-confirmed ILI was the key measure of efficacy endpoints of PSC12 and PSC04. In 
PSC04, there was inconsistent description about the time window for swabs taken. The applicant 
explains that only the date of the swab was reported during the study and thus the time window of up 
to 2 days for ILI is referred to a maximum of 72 hours. In PSC12, case definition required that lab-
confirmed ILIs began at least 14 days after vaccination. However, no such a requirement was stated in 
CSR of PSC04. 
While PSC04 was a superiority trial to compare RIV3 versus placebo, PSC12 aimed to demonstrate 
non-inferior efficacy of RIV4 relative to IIV4, as endorsed by the CHMP (EMEA/H/SA/3849/1/2018/III). 
The protocol stated that if the non-inferiority criterion was met, an exploratory superior analysis was 
pursued. However, this analysis was not included in the SAP of PSC12.  
Both PSC12 and PSC04 included immunogenicity endpoints but focusing on only serum HAI responses. 
PSC12 did not include the measurement of CMI. This precluded the possibility to explore a potential 
immune correlate of protection for the elderly. 
In study PSC12, immunogenicity data were determined in a subpopulation of ~300 subjects for each 
vaccine collected from subjects enrolled in 5 pre-selected study sites. Neither protocol nor CSR provide 
any detail regarding site- and subject- selection for serology investigations. The applicant clarified, that 
the three PSC12 sites (10, 14, and 39) chosen prior to study initiation to obtain serology samples were 
all affiliated with the same clinical site network (Benchmark Research) and selected based on previous 
enrolment experience and projections from prior successfully enrolled clinical trials sponsored by 
Protein Sciences Corporation. As the pace of enrolment indicated those three sites might not fully 
obtain the serology subset sample, based on previous experience, enrolment pace and likelihood of 
success, the two additional sites (34 and 37) were asked to participate in the PSC12 serology subset 
because they were appropriately prepared to undertake the additional study procedures. 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were overall similar across vaccine groups. There was 
only a slight difference in one centre with a very limited population size.  The described selection 
approach finally did not raise concerns related to selection bias. 
The dose used in pivotal PSC12 with RIV4 was selected based on the US licensed RIV3 in terms of 
safety and immunogenicity at a dose of 0.5 mL (45 mcg rHA per strain) and the fact that RIV4 follows 
essentially the same manufacturing process as RIV3. This appears acceptable. 
Trial PSC16 investigated the immunogenicity of RIV4 in comparison to IIV4 in adults from 18 to 49 
years of age. PSC16 is a randomised, observer-blind, active-controlled, two arm trial in which ten 
investigators in the USA recruited 1,350 subjects, of whom 1,011 received one injection of RIV4 and 
339 received one injection of IIV4. Co-primary endpoints were the seroconversion rate for each 
antigen and the GMT for each antigen at Day 28 measured with the haemagglutinin assay. 
Both pivotal trials (PSC12 and PSC16) were multi-centre, randomised, active-controlled, observer-
blind clinical studies employing a non-inferiority comparison to a licensed, egg-based quadrivalent

influenza vaccine. In trial PSC12, non-inferiority was defined as a lower bound of the two-sided 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) > -20%. The size of the NI margin was 
discussed and justified. For trial PSC16, the proposed co-primary endpoints (GMT-ratio and SCR-
difference) and NI margins were based on the FDA Guidance for Industry dating May 2007. This 
guideline does not cite a scientific rationale for the required cut-offs. However, the proposed co-
primary endpoints and NI margins can principally be accepted in view of regulatory precedence. The 
design of both pivotal trials is adequate to demonstrate immunogenicity and efficacy in an adult 
population and in line with the requirements of the Guideline on Influenza Vaccines (Non-clinical and 
Clinical Module; EMA/CHMP/VWP/457259/2014). From a planning perspective, trial PSC16 might have 
been underpowered to evaluate non-inferiority in the multiple primary endpoints. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In pivotal PSC12, RIV4 is demonstrated similarly efficacious as IIV4 in the prevention against 
influenza in adults ≥50 years of age. Following a single IM dose, the rVE of RIV4 vs IIV4 against 
protocol-defined rtPCR-positive influenza in the efficacy population (per protocol) was 30% (95%CI: 
+10, 47%). This size of treatment effect was further confirmed by secondary and exploratory analyses 
using the rtPCR-confirmed CDC-ILI and culture-confirmed CDC-ILI (any match). 
As shown in a post-hoc analysis, the observed rVE was mainly attributable to the predominant efficacy 
of RIV4 against influenza A strains, especially A/H3 (rVE 36%, 95%CI: 14%, 53%). However, for rVE 
against influenza B strains, the attack rates were 0.5% versus 0.6% for RIV4 and IIV4, respectively, 
resulting in a rVE of +17 (95% CI: -72, +46). The confidence intervals are extremely wide due to the 
low incidence of cases and no firm conclusion can be drawn. It remains unclear whether two vaccines 
can be intrinsically similar in efficacy against influenza B strains. Since more than 70% of circulating B 
strains in 2014/15 were of the B/Yamagata lineage, thus driving the B strain results, and since the 
non-inferiority of antibody titres against B/Yamagata could be replicated in both pivotal trials in 
comparison to an egg-derived licensed vaccine, efficacy of RIV4 against infection with the B/Yamagata 
strain can be accepted despite the scarcity of provided data. The applicant further substantiated the 
low efficacy observed for B/Victoria in study PSC12 with one clinical trial conducted during the 2018/19 
influenza season in the US (NCT03617523), RIV4 induced comparable humoral responses (GMT, 
GMTR, SCR) to each of the vaccine strains (including B/Victoria lineage), as did an egg-derived 
quadrivalent influenza vaccine, in adults aged 18-64 years (data shown in table below). In a second 
trial conducted in older adults 65 to 82 years of age in Hong Kong during the influenza season 
2017/18, RIV4 was demonstrated at least as immunogenic as a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine, 
with respect to humoral immune response to individual vaccine strains, including B/Brisbane/60/2008 
Victoria lineage.

Table 26: Summary of immune response in ages 18 to 64 by GMTs, GMRs and SCR 
(NCT03617523) 
The rVE (PSC12) analysis by subject demographics showed a greater rVE in the 18-64 years of age 
group than in older subjects ≥65 years of age. Although a positive point estimates in sex and race 
strata, the applicant concluded that wide 95%CI and the limited sizes of subgroups preclude their 
meaningful interpretation and there was no conclusive difference in efficacy of RIV4 vs IIV4 in the ≥65 
years of age subjects. These analyses might be read as aligning with the non-inferiority conclusion of 
the primary efficacy endpoint, but alternatively may raise a question if the effect size reported in 
primary efficacy analysis could be reproduced in different subgroups of subjects. 
In an exploratory analysis, the magnitude of treatment effect of RIV4 vs IIV4 was smaller in subjects 
having received influenza vaccines in the prior season than reported in the primary efficacy analysis. 
A post-hoc analysis for study PSC12 showed that RIV4 is more effective than IIV4 in subjects with 
underlying conditions, although this RIV4 benefit is higher in subjects with no underlying conditions 
than in subjects with underlying conditions. 
The pre-specified exploratory efficacy analyses on the influenza-related complications such as 
hospitalizations, deaths and pneumonia in PSC12, were not performed, due to the absence or not 
sufficient data to warrant a health economic assessment. 
Regarding the exploratory superiority analysis, although RIV4 met the prespecified criterion in the per 
protocol population, it is questionable if the observed rVE of >+9% with 95%CI for RIV4 over IIV4 
could be held in various situations, such as for different influenza seasons with both a good antigenic 
match and apparent mismatch of A/H3, for subgroups of subjects discussed above or for A/H1 and/or 
influenz B strains.  
Exploring potential immune correlate of protection for the older adults ≥65 years was not attempted in 
PSC12, as the study did not include measurements of CMI. 
In PSC04, which is supportive in nature for this application, efficacy of RIV3 relative to saline placebo 
could not be reliably estimated due to so few cases of the primary and secondary endpoints. In two 
exploratory analyses carried out on culture-confirmed CDC-ILI or CDC-ILI, in the ITT population, one 
Assessment report

Page 72/99 
 
 
 
 
IM dose of RIV3 could confer an overall rVE of 44.6% (95%CI: 18,8, 62.6) and 22.9% (95%CI: 2.2, 
39.4), respectively, in adults 18 to 49 years of age. As shown in an post-hoc analysis, these treatment 
effects were ascribed to the predominant efficacy of RIV3 against influenza type A strains (54.4%; 
95%CI: 26.1, 72.5). 
The applicant intended to directly compare these descriptive analyses to data of published literatures. 
Caution is needed as the differences in study design, trial population, statistical methods, and the 
number of cases can greatly confound the interpretation of these comparisons. 
Interestingly, a post-hoc analysis according to analysis periods showed a little or no protective efficacy 
of RIV3 after Feb 8, 2008, corresponding to approximately 4-5 months after vaccination. Though it has 
not been possible to explain the underlying mechanism except the assumption about a decline in cross-
protective HAI antibodies, the applicant clarified that RIV3 efficacy is higher or at least comparable to 
other licensed influenza vaccines during the 2007/2008 influenza season. The applicant presented 
results of another study (Clinical Trial number: NCT02872311). In this study, 89 subjects aged 65-74 
years were randomised 1:1:1 to receive HD-IIV3, aIIV3, or RIV4 the year after receipt of a standard 
dose of trivalent IIV-3 in the previous influenza season 2016-2017. Antibody persistence after 182 
days after vaccination (D182) were measured. The results show that antibody titers were still present 
at D182 in all vaccine groups and indicate a comparable persistence of immunogenicity for all 
administered vaccines. It should be noted, that the sample size was small with altogether 59 subjects. 
RIV3 is demonstrated immunogenic for each vaccine strain. RIV3 demonstrated satisfactory SCR and 
SPR that met CBER criteria for the 18 to 49 years of age. 
Immunogenicity data 
Immunogenicity data are available in a subset (about 7% or n~300 in each arm) of subjects from trial 
PSC12 and from the total population of trial PSC16.  
Apart from the uncertainty of how the immunogenicity population was selected in PSC12, it is notable 
that the pre-defined NI criteria (seroconversion and GMT ratio according to CBER guidance) could not be 
met for both seroconversion as well as GMT-ratio for B/Victoria, demonstrating substantial inferiority. 
For A/H1N1 seroconversion, non-inferiority was missed by a small amount. 
Immunogenicity parameters were defined as the primary outcome measure in trial PSC16, with the 
intention of establishing the immune response to RIV4 as non-inferior to the immune response elicited 
by a commercially available, egg-derived comparator as measured by the HA assay. Seroconversion 
rate and GMT-ratio were co-primary endpoints and non-inferiority according to CBER criteria could be 
shown for both A strains as well as for B/Yamagata. For B/Victoria however, in line with results 
observed in trial PSC12, both seroconversion and GMT data were markedly worse than for the 
comparator. Seroconversion was achieved by 40.6% (95% CI: 37.4, 43.7) of subjects treated with RIV4 
in contrast to 58.2% (95% CI: 52.6, 63.6) of subjects who had received IIV4. GMT values were 43 
(95% CI: 40, 46) for RIV4 recipients and 64 (95% CI: 58, 72) for IIV4 recipients. These results 
illustrate that the upper bounds of the confidence intervals for the recombinant vaccine were below the 
lower bounds of the CIs for the egg-derived vaccine, leading to the conclusion that the immunogenicity 
for B/Victoria falls short of the expected magnitude of response. While antibody titres are only 
surrogates for clinical efficacy and haemagglutinin assays may produce a different readout for an egg-
derived versus a recombinant antigen, it is a concern that immunogenicity data consistently cannot 
demonstrate NI for B/Victoria, while for B/Yamagata no such issue is evident.  
The HAI responses to B/Brisbane (Victoria lineage) were very low in both RIV4 and IIV4 vaccine 
groups. RIV4 did not meet the non-inferiority criterion for either seroconversion rates or for GMT ratios 
for this strain in either study. This finding was in contrast to the immune response to the recombinant 
B antigens observed in earlier clinical trials of the trivalent formulation of the recombinant vaccine in 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 73/99 
 
 
 
which criteria for either accelerated approval (seroconversion rates) or non-inferiority to inactivated 
vaccine B strains were met. 
The magnitude of HAI response to this antigen in both vaccine groups was low, suggesting a possibly 
reduced inherent immunogenicity of the B/Brisbane HA antigen in general. Another potential 
contributing factor proposed by the applicant may have been that most subjects were seronegative to 
B/Brisbane at the time of vaccination and therefore unprimed for this antigen. But although there are 
indeed literature hints for a generally low B/Brisbane/60/2008 immunogenicity, two other vaccines in 
Europe within the same season showed better B/Brisbane antigenicity, closer to A strain values, also 
with a mainly unprimed population (e.g. https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2014-
001042-24/results and https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2014-000785-
21/results#moreInformationSection). Furthermore, this strain has been used successfully for several 
years between 2010 and 2018.  
In a subset of 100 vaccinees of each study arm (RIV4 and IIV4) of PSC12/16, subsequently 
determined seroneutralization assay data (Baseline and Day 28 post-vaccination) also showed less 
immunogenicity for B/Victoria in the RIV4 arms compared to the IIV4 arms, but the absolute GMTs 
post-vaccination at least proved to be sufficiently “protective” values (99-100% “seroprotection”, 
≥1:40), interestingly with already high baseline “seroprotection” rates (95-96% in elder population 
and 87-89% in young adults). The clinical relevance of the low B/Victoria strain immunogenicity in trial 
PSC12 could not be elucidated unequivocally, as no conclusive efficacy for that strain could be shown 
due to low B/Victoria circulation during the trial seasons (more than 70% of circulating B strains in 
2014/15 were of the B/Yamagata lineage). 
Additional data subsequently submitted by the applicant reinforce the notion that there is not a general 
weakness regarding B/Victoria lineage immunogenicity in RIV4. 
In study performed in Hong Kong during the 2017-2018 influenza season in adults 65 to 82 years of age 
(Cowling BJ et al), immunogenicity of RIV4 was compared with the immunogenicity of an IIV4-standard 
dose vaccine, a MF59 adjuvanted trivalent vaccine, and a High Dose IIV3. HAI showed that RIV4 
immunogenicity was comparable to the immunogenicity of the IIV4 vaccine for all strains including 
responses to the B/Victoria lineage, B/Brisbane/60/2008 strain. Another study (Belongia et al 2020) 
evaluated the immunogenicity performance of RIV4 compared to Fluzone HD IIV3 and adjuvanted-IIV3 
after standard-dose IIV3 the season prior, in individuals 65-74 years of age. The study was performed 
over 2 seasons 2016-2017, 2017-2108 when the B/Victoria lineage strain in vaccine TIV and QIV 
formulations was the same strain used in the pivotal RIV4 trials, B/Brisbane/60/2008. HAI titers were 
measured at 28 days post vaccination in the second season of the study as well as influenza attack 
rates, both stratified by vaccine types. The results for the influenza B strain, B/Brisbane/60/2008 were 
comparable to the Fluzone HD and adjuvanted IIV3 results in this older age group.  
In contrary, and consistent with the earlier RIV3 studies, RIV4 subjects in studies PSC12 and PSC16 
had notably higher HAI antibody responses to the influenza A/H3N2 vaccine component relative to IIV4 
subjects for all major adult age brackets (from 18 to 49 years of age, from 50 to 64 years of age, and 
≥65 years of age). 
The findings related to A/H3N2 are especially relevant, given that seasons in which A/H3N2 is the 
predominant circulating strain are known to be associated with greater morbidity and mortality than 
are seasons dominated by the other epidemic subtypes based on observations in recent decades. 
Furthermore, in study PSC12, the higher immune response to A/H3N2 in RIV4 subjects relative to IIV4 
subjects and the predominance of cases with type A/H3N2 isolates (73/96, 76 %) very likely 
contributed to the higher relative VE demonstrated in this study. “Antigenic match” could not be 
evaluated within PSC12 as planned due to the predominant “antigenic mismatch” of A/H3N2 circulating 
strains (A/H3N2/Switzerland) and the corresponding vaccine strain (A/H3N2/Texas) for the 2014-2015 
Assessment report

influenza season, also reported by the CDC. Similar observations were made in the study PSC04 
conducted during the 2007-2008 season. 
Regarding specifically elderly subjects ≥65 years of age in PSC12, the immunogenicity exploratively 
has been shown to be weaker than in subjects 50-64 or 18-49 years of age in all strains in both RIV4 
and IIV4, with the A/H1N1 strain yielding a relatively better seroconversion rate in IIV4 (37 vs. 27%) 
and the A/H3N2 in turn a better result in RIV4 (41 vs 25%). In adults 50-64 years of age, the 
seroconversion rates ranged between the <50- and >65 year-old subjects, and did not significantly 
differ between the treatment groups, except for A/H3N2 with a better result for RIV4 (63 vs. 51%) and 
B/Brisbane in favour of IIV4 (43 vs. 26%). Thus, like in other influenza vaccines, a clear age-
dependency of immune response is visible here as well. 
The assessment of the performance of RIV4 in adults 18 years of age and older in comparison to an 
active IIV4 comparator showed that RIV4 was, in general, as immunogenic as, and for influenza 
A/H3N2 more immunogenic, than the licensed IIV4 Fluarix Tetra in the given season. This roughly was 
true, as well, for the age categories ≥50 years of age.  
Furthermore, regarding the intended bridging approach, adults from 18 to 49 years of age 
demonstrated immune responses at least comparable to those generated by adults ≥ 50 years of age 
in whom protective efficacy was demonstrated.  
In general, the immune responses to the B strains among both age groups were less robust than to 
the A strains, but this was true for both RIV4 and the active IIV4 comparator. RIV4 was non-inferior to 
IIV4 for B/Massachusetts for SCR and GMT in both studies (all subjects). B/Brisbane demonstrated the 
least robust immunogenicity with both vaccines. 
At least, regarding B strains, in view of a predominant strain mismatch during the 2014-2015 influenza 
season (and also 2007-2008), some degree of cross-reactive effectivity of RIV4 (and RIV3) can be 
assumed from the efficacy results in studies PSC12 (and PSC04), albeit no exact strain differentiation 
could be made during their evaluations.   
The immunogenicity subset of study PSC04, otherwise mainly meant to show absolute efficacy (1:1 
compared to placebo) of the equivalent trivalent predecessor vaccine (RIV3) against culture-confirmed 
CDC- or non-CDC-defined influenza-like illness in adults 18-49 years of age, may in some respects also 
support the present immunogenicity considerations, albeit HAI titers determined with a different test 
antigen (recombinant versus egg-grown, as mentioned above).  
The GMTs raised in the subpopulation of n=391 (448) originally used for the lot-to-lot consistency 
assessment and as secondary objectives for seroconversion and seroprotection rate calculation allows 
the relative conclusion, that still sufficient immunogenicity (and efficacy, albeit mismatching strains) 
for B/Malaysia (also a B/Victoria strain) could be shown, in order to alleviate doubts against a general 
insufficient immunogenicity against the B/Victoria lineage as suspected when only considering the 
PSC12 and PSC16 B/Brisbane-results.

However, immunogenicity results of PSC04 have to be interpreted with caution, as issues with the 
potency test to measure antigen content caused considerable variation in rHA amount contained in the 
different RIV3 lots, leading to failure of lot consistency. Improved recalculation indicated that the H3 
antigen (A/Wisconsin/67/2005) content in two of three lots was reduced by ~ 1/3 (~30µg) of the 
intended amount (45µg) whereas the other antigens exceeded the intended antigen amount by up to 
40% (51-64µg).The applicant reconfirmed that the reference reagents used for the potency 
measurement were essential regulatory laboratory (ERL) calibrated and relevant for recombinant HA 
antigens used in the vaccine lots, and they did not compromise the HA antigen content of the 
B/Brisbane strain contained in the vaccine formulation used in PSC12 and PSC16 studies. 
In the context of seroconversion calculation, comparing A-strain seroconversion results in PSC16 (and 
12) to the respective values in PSC04, the PSC16/12 values turn out to be generally lower in spite of 
higher GMTs with relatively narrow CIs. Comparing the lower A-strain seroconversion rates in PSC16 
versus PSC04 in spite of higher post-exposure GMTs, it was hint that this discrepancy may be due of 
the different vaccine strains between these two seasons, different HAI methodologies, as well as 
different pre-exposure history and baseline titers.  
Finally, according to the Guideline on Influenza Vaccines – Non-clinical and clinical module, it is not 
expected that any one study will be able to provide estimates of strain-specific efficacy and studies will 
not be powered for such analyses. It is noted that trial PSC16 has formally failed its primary objective 
and could not show non-inferiority of RIV4 to IIV4 in all its strains. Whilst the potential of 
underpowering of PSC16 was mentioned in the methodological assessment in this report, it needs to 
be noted that sample size eventually also sufficed to bring up statistical evidence for RIV4 being 
inferior to IIV4 in terms of immunogenic response in relation to strain B/Victoria. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy of RIV4 has been demonstrated in subjects ≥50 years of age in pivotal PSC12, showing 
10% efficacy with 95%CI, relative to IIV4, in preventing against rt-PCR confirmed protocol defined ILI 
occurring >14 days after vaccination. RIV4 can also be inferred as effective in adults 18 to 49 years of 
age, based on immunogenicity data from pivotal PSC16 and the clinical endpoint data of the supportive 
PSC04 study with RIV3, taking in to account the evidence documented in PSC12 with older adults. 
Regarding clinical efficacy by influenza subtype, RIV4 is demonstrated efficacious against influenza A, 
whereas efficacy against influenza B is inconclusive. Nonetheless, RIV4 is shown to be as immunogenic 
as IIV4 comparator with respect to the HAI response to B/Yamagata strain. 
Though the beneficial effects of RIV4 against influenza A and B/Yamagata is demonstrated by efficacy 
and supported by immunogenicity data, there were uncertainties with regard to the B/Victoria 
component due to inferior immunogenicity. Further data from two independent clinical trials were 
provided to alleviate this issue, indicating that there is not a general weakness regarding the 
immunogenicity of the B/Victoria lineage in RIV4. 
The applicant commits to continue to monitor the performance of this vaccine during the post-
authorisation phase by means of an effectiveness study, as specified in the RMP.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety of the quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine Supemtek (RIV4) to support registration 
in adults ≥18 years of age has been studied in 2 completed phase III studies: 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 76/99 
 
 
 
•  Study PSC12 was a Phase III observer-blind, randomised, active-controlled, parallel design, 
multicentre clinical trial in adults ≥ 50 years of age designed to assess relative vaccine 
efficacy, and to compare the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of RIV4 with that of an 
EU-licensed IIV4 (Fluarix Tetra).  
•  Study PSC16 was a Phase III observer-blind, randomised, active-controlled, parallel design, 
multicentre clinical trial in subjects from 18 to 49 years of age designed to compare the safety, 
reactogenicity and immunogenicity of RIV4 to EU-licensed IIV4 (Fluarix Tetra).  
The safety data from these two studies were not pooled for an integrated safety analysis as the age 
groups enrolled were not overlapping. Therefore, safety data were presented separately according to 
the 2 age strata covered by these studies (18 to 49 years of age and ≥50 years of age). Additionally, 
safety data from study PSC12 conducted in elderly subjects ≥ 50 years of age were also presented by 
the age categories 50-64 years of age and ≥ 65 years of age.  
The RIV4 development is based on the manufacturing process and controls of the trivalent 
recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3). The quantity of each HA antigen and excipients of RIV4 was 
equivalent to that of RIV3 but with the addition of the second B strain. Safety data from one clinical 
study performed with the trivalent vaccine RIV3 has been provided: 
•  Study PSC04 was a Phase III double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial 
designed to evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, reactogenicity, efficacy, effectiveness and lot 
consistency of FluBlok trivalent recombinant baculovirus-expressed haemagglutinin influenza 
vaccine in healthy adults 18 to 49 years. 
The RIV3 safety program provided includes results from a number of additional clinical trials (e.g. 
PSC01, PSC03, PSC04, PSC06 and PSC11) demonstrating the safety of RIV3 compared to either 
placebo or active comparators in adult and elderly subjects.  
Patient exposure 
The study population in both trial included ambulatory and medically stable adults ≥50 years of age 
(trial PSC12) or 18-49 years of age (trial PSC16) without contraindication to the vaccines, and who did 
not have underlying conditions that might complicate the evaluation of the primary efficacy and safety 
endpoint. Individuals with underlying disease or therapeutic intervention that might adversely affect 
the immune response, e.g. cytotoxic agents or supraphysiologic doses of corticosteroids were 
excluded. Also pregnant or lactating women and women planning to become pregnant within 30 days 
after vaccine administration were excluded (applicable only for trial PSC16 including subjects 18-49 
years of age). 
The safety population included all randomised subjects who received study vaccine or control (i.e. RIV4 
or IIV4) and provided any safety data. The safety population from trial PSC12 and PSC16 included 
altogether 10,002 subjects. 8,672 subjects were included in the safety population of trial PSC12 and 
1,330 subjects in the safety population of trial PSC16. A total of 5,326 subjects received one dose of 
RIV4 in the two studies, i.e. 998 adults 18 to 49 years of age in study PSC16, and 4,328 adults from 
≥50 years of in study PSC12. The safety population of RIV4 included 2,569 individuals 50-64 years of 
age, 1,234 individuals 65 to 74 years, and 525 individuals ≥75 years of age. 4,676 subjects received 
IIV4 in the two trials. 
Adverse events 
Solicited adverse events 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 77/99 
 
 
 
In trial PSC12 and PSC16, local solicited reactions were more frequently recorded than solicited 
systemic reactions in both vaccine groups. The incidence of solicited local and systemic reactogenicity 
was comparable in both vaccine groups in both trials. The most frequently reported local solicited 
reaction in both vaccine groups was local tenderness, followed by local pain. The most frequently 
reported solicited systemic reactions were headache, fatigue, joint and muscle pain. The majority of 
local and systemic solicited reactions was mild to moderate in both vaccine groups. Also the incidence 
of fever was comparable in the two groups. 
Differences in the frequency of solicited injection site reactions were observed in both trials, and in 
both vaccine groups related to gender, race, and ethnicity. In trial PSC12, reactogenicity differences 
were additionally observed related to age. In both trials and both vaccine groups, local reactogenicity 
events occurred within the same range, but tended to be more frequently reported by females 
compared with males, by white subjects compared with non-white subjects, and by non-hispanic 
subjects compared with hispanic subjects. Reactogenicity also tended to be higher in individuals 50 to 
64 years of age, compared to those older than 64 years of age (trial PSC12). It is known from other 
vaccines, that demographic parameters might have an impact on immune response. Age related 
differences are well known for vaccines. The lower reactogenicity in elderly is associated with a lower 
immune response due to immunosenesence. The observed different reactogenicity in demographic 
subgroups is not large and not considered clinically meaningful in respect to safety. 
Solicited local adverse reactions 
Trial PSC12 
Overall, 48.0% of subjects (2,071) in the RIV4 vaccine group and 51.0% of subjects (2,206) in the 
IIV4 vaccine group recorded one or more solicited reactogenicity event (local or systemic), p-value 
0.006, [95 % CI (46.5,49.5) and (49.5, 52.5)].  
Overall, 37.6% of subjects (1,621) in the RIV4 vaccine group versus 40.4% of subjects (1,745) in the 
IIV4 vaccine group recorded one or more solicited local reaction, p-value 0.009, [95 % CI (36.2, 39.1) 
and (38.9, 41.9)]. The most frequently reported solicited local reaction in both vaccine groups was 
local tenderness reported by 34.3% (1,479) of subjects [95% CI (32.9, 35.8)] in the RIV4 vaccine 
group and by 37.1% (1,604) of subjects in the IIV4 vaccine group [95% CI (35.7, 38.6)], followed by 
local pain reported by 18.9% (813) of subjects [95% CI (17.7, 20.1)], versus 22.0% (950) of subjects 
[95% CI (20.8, 23.3)], in the two vaccine groups. The majority of solicited local reactions were mild to 
moderate. 13 subjects each in the two vaccine groups reported grade 3 solicited local reactions and 3 
subjects reported grade 4 reactions (1 in the RIV4 group and 2 in the IIV4 group).  
Trial PSC16 
Overall, 51.2%  of subjects (510) in the RIV4 vaccine group versus 51.8% of subjects (172) in the 
IIV4 vaccine group recorded one or more solicited local reaction, p-value 0.90, [95% CI (48.1, 54.4) 
and (46.3, 57.3)]. The most frequently reported solicited local reactions in both vaccine groups were 
local tenderness reported by 48.0% of subjects (478) in the RIV4 vaccine group and by 46.7% of 
subjects (155) in the IIV4 vaccine group [CI 95% (44.8, 51.1) and  (41.2, 52.2)], followed by local 
pain reported by 36.8% of subjects (367), and by 36.4% of subjects (121) in the two vaccine groups, 
[95% CI (33.8, 39.9) and (31.3, 41.9)]. P-values for the events of tenderness and local pain were 0.70 
and 0.95. The majority of solicited local reactions were mild to moderate. A total of 16 subjects 
reported grade 3 solicited local reactions, 11 (1.1%) in the RIV4 and 5 (1.5%) in the IIV4 vaccine 
group. Overall, only 1 subject (in the RIV4 vaccine group) reported a grade 4 solicited local 
reactogenicity event. 
Local reactogenicty by demography

Demographic differences reagarding local reactogenicity have been observed. Since the reactogenicity 
events occurred within the same range, they do not negatively impact the B/R ratio of RIV4 in any of 
the demographic subgroups.  
Trial PSC12 
In both treatment groups injection-site reactions were within the same range, but tended to be 
reported more frequently in younger subjects (50-64 years of age), females, whites, and non-
hispanics, compared with older subjects ≥65 years of age, males, blacks, and hispanics. The 
proportion of subjects reporting at least one solicited local reactogenicity event in the 50-64 years of  
age group in trial PSC12 was 42.3% (1080) of subjects (95% CI [40.3, 44.2] in the RIV4 group and 
44.6% (1159) of subjects in the IIV4 group (95% CI [(42.6,46.5]), as compared with 30.9% (541) of 
subjects (95% CI [28.7, 33.1]), and 34.1% (586) of subjects (95% CI [31.9, 36.4]) in adults ≥ 65 
years of age in the two vaccine groups, p-value <0.001 in both groups (statistically significant). The 
proportion of subjects who reported at least one solicited local reactogenicity event was higher in 
females compared with males in both vaccine groups. Overall, 45.4% (95% CI [43.4, 47.4]) of females 
(1145 subjects) in the RIV4 and 48.4% of females (95% CI [46.5, 50.4]) in the IIV4 vaccine group 
(1221 subjects) reported at least one solicited local reactogenicity event compared with 26.7% (95% 
CI [24.6,28.8]) of male subjects (476) and 29.1% (95% CI [27.1, 31.3] of male subjects (524) in the 
two vaccine groups. The difference was statistically significant in both groups (p-value <0.001). Local 
reactogenicity was higher in white subjects compared with non-white subjects in both vaccine groups. 
At least one solicited local reactogenicty event was reported by 39.9% (1378) of white subjects in the 
RIV4 vaccine group (95% CI [38.3, 41.6]), and by 42.8% (1486) of white subjecsts in the IIV4 vaccine 
group (95% CI [41.1, 44.4]), compared with 28.5% (243) and 30.7% (259) of non-white subjects 
(95% CI [25.4,31.6] and [27.6, 33.9]) in the two vaccine groups (p-value <0.001, statistically 
significant). Regarding to ethnicity, local reactogenicty was lower in hispanic subjects compared with 
non-hispanic subjects in both vaccine groups. 27.3% (56) and 31.7% (69) of hispanic subjects (95% 
CI [21.3,34.0] and [25.5,38.3]) in the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine group, compared with 38.2% (1565) 
and 40.9% (1676) of non-hispanic subjects (95% CI [36.7,39.7] and [39.4,42.4]), p-value 0.002 in 
the RIV4 and 0.007 in the IIV4 vaccine group. 
Trial PSC16 
The proportion of subjects reporting at least one solicited local reactogenicity event was 56.7% (361) 
and 57.2% (127) of female subjects in the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine group (95% CI [52.7,60.6] and 
[50.4,63.8]), versus 41.5% (149) and 40.9% (45) of male subjects (95% CI [36.4,46.8] and 
[31.6,50.7]). Overall 59.7% (351) and 56.4% (114) of white subjects in the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine 
group (95% CI [55.6,63.7] and [49.3,63.4]), versus 39.0% (159) and 44.6% (58) of non-white 
subjects (95% CI [34.2,43.9] and [35.9,53.6]), reported at least one local reactogenicity event, p-
value <0.001 in the RIV 4 vaccine group (statistically significant) and 0.037 in the IIV 4 vaccine group. 
53.7% (87) and 52.6% (30) of hispanic subjects (95% CI [45.7,61.6] and [39.0,66.0]), versus 62.7% 
(523) and 63.6% (175) of non-hispanic subjects, (95% CI [59.3,66.0] and [57.6,69.3]) reported at 
least one solicited local reactogenicity, p-value 0.034 and 0.14 in the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine group. 
Solicited systemic adverse reactions 
Trial PSC12 
Overall, 25.0% (1,077) of subjects in the RIV4 and 25.6% (1,106) of subjects in the IIV4 vaccine 
group recorded one or more solicited systemic reaction, p-value 0.54, [95% CI (23.7, 26.3) and (24.3, 
26.9)]. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions in the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine 
group were fatigue reported by 12.2% (526) versus 12.1% (521) of subjects, p-value 0.84, [95% CI

(11.3,13.2) and (11.1, 13.1)], and headache reported by 12.7% (549) versus 13.5% (582) of 
subjects, p-value was 0.32, [95% CI (11.8, 13.8) and (12.5, 14.5)]. This was followed by joint (7.5% 
versus 8.0% of subjects) and muscle pain (8.5% versus 8.8% of subjects). p-values for joint and 
muscle pain were 0.40 and 0.7, respectively, [95% CIs were (6.8, 8.4) versus (7.2, 8.9)], and [(7.7, 
9.4) versus (7.9, 9.6)] for the two symptoms in the two vaccine groups. The majority of solicited 
systemic reactions were mild to moderate. Grade 3 solicited systemic reactions were reported by 1.3% 
of subjects each in the two vaccine groups (58 and 55 subjects in the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine 
group). Grade 4 solicited systemic reactions were reported by 4 subjects (0.1%) in the RIV4 and by 8 
subjects (0.2%) in the IIV4 vaccine group. 
In relation to fever, only 0.4% (19) and 0.5% (21) of subjects in the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine group 
reported fever events ≥100.4°F (38.0° C). Grade 3 body temperature, i.e. 102.1°F (38.9°C) to 104°F 
(40°C) was recorded for 7 (0.2%) and 6 (0.1%) subjects in the two vaccine groups. No subject 
reported a grade 4 fever event, i.e. body temperature >104°F (40°C). 
Trial PSC16 
Overall, 34.1% (339) of subjects in the RIV4 and 35.8% (119) of subjects in the IIV4 vaccine group 
recorded one or more solicited systemic reaction, p-value 0.59, [95% CI (31.2, 37.1) and (30.7, 
41.3)]. The most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions in the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine 
group was headache, reported by 20.3% (202) versus 21.1% (70) of subjects, p-value 0.75, [95% CI 
(17.9, 23.0) and (16.8, 25.9)], followed by fatigue reported by 16.5% (164) versus 16.6% (55) of 
subjects, p-value > 0.99, [95% CI (14.2,19.0) and (12.7, 21.0)], respectively. Joint and muscle pain 
were reported by less than 13% of subjects in both groups. The majority of solicited systemic reactions 
were mild to moderate. Grade 3 solicited systemic reactions were reported by 2.3% and 2.7% of 
subjects in the two vaccine groups (23 and 9 subjects). Grade 4 solicited systemic reactions were 
reported by 2 subjects, one in the RIV4, and one in the IIV4 vaccine group. 
In relation to fever, only 1.5% (15) and 0.6% (2) of subjects in the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine group 
reported fever events ≥100.4° F (38.0° C). Grade 3 body temperature, i.e. 102.1° F (38.9° C) to 104° 
F (40° C) was recorded for 4 (0.4%) and 1 (0.3%) subject in the two vaccine groups. No subject 
reported a grade 4 fever event, i.e. body temperature >104°F (40°C). 
Unsolicited adverse events 
The safety population to assess unsolicited adverse events was 4,328 subjects in the RIV4 and 4,344 
subjects in the IIV4 vaccine group in trial PSC12, and 998 subjects and 332 subjects in trial PSC16. 
The most common unsolicited AE terms reported from the RIV4 and IIV4 groups in both studies were 
respiratory tract infection symptoms like nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, 
and cough/productive cough, in the SOCs of “infection and infestations” and “respiratory disorders”. 
Other commonly reported unsolicited AE were headache, fatigue, and myalgia. The tabled unsolicited 
adverse events did not indicate any difference in the safety profile of the two vaccines. Frequency and 
nature of AEs was balanced. 
A subgroup analysis by age, gender and racial/ethnic origin was performed in each population. Elderly 
subjects tended to report unsolicited AE with higher frequency compared to non-elderly (31.1% versus 
14.3%). Unsolicited non-serious AEs were reported by higher percentages of female subjects than 
male subjects. Caucasian/white subjects tended to report unsolicited non-serious AEs more frequently 
than non-white subjects. 
Trial PSC12 
Overall, 31.1% (1,345) and 31.2% (1,355) of subjects recorded at least one unsolicited AE. The most 
common recorded unsolicited AEs were cough recorded by 5.2% (226) and 5.8% (253) of subjects in 
Assessment report

the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine group, influenza like illness (4.3% [186] and 4.6% [199]), 
oropharyngeal pain (4.1% each [178, 177]), headache (3.3% each [143, 145]), upper respiratory 
tract infection (3.0% [129] and 3.6% [156]), fatigue (2.4% [106] and 2.3% [100]), myalgia (2.2% 
[95] and 1.8% [79]), and productive cough (1.4% [59] and 2.2% [97]).  
Trial PSC16 
Overall, 14.3% (143) and 14.2% (47) of subjects recorded at least one unsolicited AE. The most 
common recorded unsolicited AEs were headache recorded by 2.0% (20) and 1.5% (5) of subjects in 
the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine group, nasopharyngitis (1.3% [13] and 1.5% [5]), upper respiratory 
tract infection (1.0% [10] and 1.5% [5]), sinusitis (0.6% [6] and 1.5% [5[), and cough (1.4% [14] 
and 1.2% [4]). All other events were reported from less than 1% of subjects in either treatment 
group. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The study protocol did not define AESIs as specific safety endpoints. However, study protocols were 
screened for AEs potentially associated with influenza vaccination including neuritis, convulsion, 
encephalitis, vasculitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Bell´s palsy and demyelinating disorders.  
Overall, the incidence of AESIs potentially associated with influenza vaccination was low across the 
RIV4 clinical development program and generally balanced between the vaccine groups. However, one 
case of Bell´s palsy has been reported in study PSC12 in a 79-year old female subject 85 days after 
vaccination with RIV4. This event resolved within 17 days after the diagnosis and was judged as not 
related to study vaccine by the investigator. However, based on the information provided a causal 
relationship between the event of Bell´s palsy and vaccination cannot be excluded. The applicant 
argued that the causal relationship between Bell´s palsy and RIV4 vaccination seems unlikely as the 
occurrence of this event was beyond the risk window of cranial nerve disorders which was published to 
be between 8 to 30 days in girls receiving HPV4 vaccination. With regard to the time periods used to 
investigate the increased risk of Bell´s palsy after influenza vaccination, different risk periods up to 3 
months were found in literature (e.g. Greene et al., 2010, Stowe et al., 2006, Wijnans et al., 2017). 
No temporal relationship between administration of influenza vaccines and the occurrence of Bell´s 
Palsy have been reported, however, the available evidence favours that a causal relationship between 
Bell´s palsy and influenza vaccinations seems to be low considering the late onset of this event. No 
event of Bell´s palsy has been reported in study PSC16 in adults 18 – 49 years of age. Bell´s palsy has 
also been reported in study PSC04 in a 35-year old subject who received the trivalent vaccine RIV3. 
This subject had a history of multiple prior episodes of Bell´s palsy. The event was initially classified as 
treatment-related SAE, but then reclassified as “not related” upon subsequent investigation. The 
subject had prodromal symptoms (watery eyes) one day prior to vaccination, which was consistent 
with the prodrome in her previous episodes of Bell’s palsy. In addition, onset of the Bell’s palsy had 
occurred within one hour of vaccination, which is incompatible with the known pathophysiology of this 
disorder. The symptoms resolved without treatment or sequelae within 3 days after vaccination, and 
did not recur by the time of the Day 28 contact. 
In study PSC12 conducted in elderly ≥50 years of age, 2 subjects (0.0%) in the RIV4 treatment arm 
and 1 subject (0.0%) in the IIV4 treatment arm reported an AE of convulsion 14, 133 and 70 days 
after vaccination, respectively. None of these events was considered related by the Investigator. 
However, one of these AEs experienced by a 52-year old subject 133 days post-vaccination was fatal. 
Since this subject had a medical history of seizure disorders, the cause of death might be attributable 
to the underlying comorbid condition. In study PSC16, one case (0.1%) of convulsion was reported in 
the RIV4 vaccine group compared to none in the IIV4 arm. This event occurred 114 days post-
vaccination and it is agreed that this event is considered unrelated to study vaccine due to the lack of 
temporal relationship. 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 81/99 
 
 
 
Among elderly, 3 subjects (0.1%) in the RIV4 treatment arm and 1 subject (0.0%) in the IIV4 
treatment arm reported an AE of peripheral neuropathy 53, 175, 107 and 58 days after vaccination, 
respectively. Due to the late onset of these events after vaccination, it is agreed that these AEs might 
not be related to the study vaccine.  
No events of neuritis, vasculitis, demyelinating disorders or Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) have been 
reported across the clinical development program of RIV4. However, the annual incidence rate of GBS 
ranges from 0.8 to 1.9 per 100,000 persons and it might be difficult to detect a small increase in risk 
for a rare disease such as GBS in the clinical studies (Fadrigue et al., 2019). Therefore, the addition of 
GBS in section 4.8 of the SmPC is endorsed. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The proportion of subjects who recorded a SAE was in general comparable in the two vaccine groups in 
both trials. No notable differences could be observed with regard to the nature of SAEs in the two 
vaccine groups. It was however noted, that the SAE of myocardial infarction was slightly more 
frequently reported in the RIV4 group compared to the IIV4 arm. In study PSC12, 4 subjects (0.1%) 
exposed to RIV4 and 3 subjects (0.1%) in the IIV4 treatment arm experienced myocardial infarction. 
In study PSC16, 2 subjects (0.2%) in the RIV4 and 0 subjects (0%) in the IIV4 arm experienced 
myocardial infarction. In study PSC12, all of the subjects who suffered from MI had comorbidities that 
are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events including increased age, hypertension, 
hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesterolemia and/or diabetes mellitus and thus reflect a population of high 
risk of MI. However, in study PSC16 conducted in adults 18 to 49 years of age, the subjects who 
suffered from MI were <45 years of age (37 and 44 years of age). The 37-year old subject who 
suffered from myocardial infarction on day 88 received concomitant medications of steroid injections 
(since 01 May 2012), tramadol (since 06 January 2014) and Flexeril (since 06 July 2014). 
Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) is closely related to tricyclic antidepressants which are known to produce 
arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, prolongation of conduction time leading to myocardial infarction and 
stroke. The 44-year old subject had comorbidities of hypertriglyceridemia (since 2012) and diabetes 
mellitus type II (since 2011) which are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events. 
These were judged as not related to the vaccination.  
No SAEs considered being vaccine related were recorded in the clinical trial protocols of trial PSC12 and 
PSC16. Subgroup analysis for SAEs by age (age categories 50-64, 65-74, ≥65 and ≥75), gender and 
race/ethnicity were submitted for study PSC12. These data was not provided for study PSC16 
conducted in adults 18 to 49 years of age. However, considering that subgroup analyses by race and 
ethnicity need to be interpreted with caution because the number of subjects belonging in racial groups 
other than whites or blacks/African American or subjects with Hispanic/Latino ethnicity were 
underrepresented, subgroup analyses by race and ethnicity for study PSC16 might be less informative. 
This is acceptable. The number of subjects experiencing at least one SAE after vaccination was 2.5% 
among subjects 50-64 years of age, 3.7% among subjects 65-74 years of age, 4.6% among subjects 
≥65 years of age and 6.7% among subjects ≥75 years of age. The incidence of SAE was comparable in 
the age categories of both vaccine groups (RIV4 and IIV4). As expected, the incidence of SAE tended 
to increase with age. The number of subjects with at least one SAE was slightly higher in male subjects 
(4%) compared to female subjects (2.9%) in the RIV4 arm. In subjects vaccinated with IIV4, the 
incidence of SAE was comparable between male and female subjects (3% in both groups). The number 
of subjects with at least one SAE were slightly lower in Caucasian/white subjects (3.3%) compared to 
blacks/African American (3.9%). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed a slightly higher incidence of 
SAE in non-Hispanic (3.4%) compared to Hispanic (2.4%) subjects vaccinated with RIV4. In subjects 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 82/99 
 
 
 
vaccinated with IIV4, Hispanic subjects (5.5%) reported a higher incidence of at least one SAE 
compared to non-Hispanic (2.9%). Overall, no safety concerns arise from the provided data. 
Trial PSC12 
Overall, 145 (3.4%) and 132 (3.0%) of the 4,328 and 4,344 subjects of the safety population in the 
RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine group of trials PSC12 recorded SAEs during the 6-months follow-up period. 
Trial PSC16 
Overall, 15 SAEs were reported from 10 out of 998 subjects (1.0%) in the safety population of the RIV 
4 vaccine group, and from 2 out of 332 subjects (0.6%) in the safety population of the IIV4 vaccine 
group, during the 6-months follow-up period in trial PSC16. 
Deaths 
Overall, 20 deaths were recorded throughout the duration of trial PSC12; 8 in the RIV4 and 12 in the 
IIV4 vaccine group. None of the deaths were considered being vaccine related. There were no deaths 
reported throughout the duration of trial PSC16. 
Medically-attended adverse events (MAEs) 
Among elderly, MAEs reported throughout the study period of 6 months were 17.9% in the RIV4 and 
18.1% in the IIV4 treatment arm. The most commonly reported MAEs were in the SOCs “Infections 
and Infestations” (8.45% RIV4 and 8.2% IIV4), “Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders” 
(2.5% RIV4 and 2.6% IIV4), “General disorders and administration site conditions” (2.4% RIV4 and 
2.7% IIV4), “Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders” (2.2% RIV4 and 2.3% IIV4) and 
“Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” (2.1% RIV4 and 1.9% IIV4). Within these 
categories, the specific preferred terms of respiratory infection, sinusitis, bronchitis, cough and 
influenza-like illness were reported by ≥1% of subjects. The frequency of MAEs reported within 28 
days post-vaccination was 4.8% in the RIV4 and 5.4% in the IIV4 treatment arm and was almost 
balanced between the vaccine groups. The incidence of vaccine-related MAEs was 0.5% in both 
treatment groups.  
In study PSC12, the applicant stated that treatment related MAEs were reported from 774 (17.9%) 
and 785 (18.1%) subjects in the RIV4 and IIV4 groups, respectively. However, the incidence of 
vaccine-related MAEs was 0.5% in both treatment groups. The data provided show that the most 
frequently reported MAEs were in the SOCs “Infections and infestations” (0.3% RIV4 and 0.2% IIV4) 
and “Respiratory tract infection and mediastinal disorders” (0.1% RIV4 and 0.2% IIV4). Within these 
SOCs, no noteworthy differences were observed in any of the preferred terms. Most of the MAEs were 
reported in only one or two subjects. The only MAEs that were reported from ≥2 subjects in either 
treatment group were upper respiratory infection, bronchitis and cough. 
Overall, the incidence of vaccine-related MAEs was low in study PSC12 and no noteworthy difference 
was observed in any of the preferred terms between the vaccine groups. 
In study PSC16, MAEs reported throughout the study period of 6 months were 8.0% in the RIV4 and 
7.2% in the IIV4 group. The most frequently reported MAEs were in the SOCs “Infections and 
infestations” (3.5% RIV4 and 3.9% IIV4), “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” (0.8% 
RIV4 and 0.3% IIV4) and “Respiratory tract infection and mediastinal disorders” (0.8% RIV4 and 0.6% 
IIV4). Within these SOCs no noteworthy difference was observed in any of the preferred terms. 
However, an imbalance has been observed in the SOC “Pregnancy and puerperium and perinatal 
conditions” (0.6% RIV4 versus 0% IIV4) with a notable difference in pregnancies reported for 0.5% (5 
subjects) in the RIV4 arm compared to no pregnancy reported in the IIV4 arm (please refer to section 
Safety in Special Population). Within all other reported SOCs, the only MAE that was reported from 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 83/99 
 
 
 
≥1% of subjects in a treatment group was sinusitis, reported from 1.5% IIV4 recipients. No MAE was 
reported by ≥1% of subjects in the RIV4 group. The frequency of MAEs reported within 28 days post-
vaccination was 3.8% in the RIV4 and 3.3% in the IIV4 treatment arm. The incidence of vaccine-
related MAEs in study PSC16 was 0.2% in the RIV4 and 0.6% in the IIV4 group. The data show that 
treatment-related MAEs were only reported in the SOCs “Infections and infestations” (0.2% RIV4 and 
0.3% IIV4) and “Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders” (0.0% RIV4 and 0.3% IIV4). Within these 
SOCs, each preferred term was reported by one subject each. The incidence of vaccine-related MAEs 
was low in study PSC16 and did not raise any safety concerns.  
The incidence of MEAs increased with age (15.3% in subjects aged 50 – 64 years of age, 20.3% in 
subjects 65 – 74% and 24.6% in subjects ≥75 years of age). Slightly higher incidence of MAEs were 
reported in female subjects (19.9%) compared to male subjects (15.5%). Subpopulation analyses of 
SAEs by race and ethnicity revealed higher rates in whites as compared to blacks/African Americans 
and in non-Hispanic (18%) as compared to Hispanic (14.6%). It should be noted, that subgroup 
analyses by race and ethnicity need to be interpreted with caution because the number of subjects 
belonging in racial groups other than whites or blacks/African American or subjects with 
Hispanic/Latino ethnicity were underrepresented. 
Laboratory findings 
No routine safety laboratory testing was specified. 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and lactation 
The use of RIV4 during pregnancy has not been studied. Pregnant women were excluded from clinical 
study trial PSC12, and PSC16 only included individuals ≥50 years. 
Post-marketing data for use of the recombinant influenza vaccines RIV3 and RIV4 during pregnancy in 
the USA are available from 2013/14 through 2017/18 for RIV3 and since 2017/18 for RIV4. Data are 
limited to reports of pregnancies occurring incidentally during clinical trials, VAERS (Vaccine Adverse 
Event Reporting System) reports, and pregnancy registry reports. Overall, 29 pregnancy cases are 
present in Sanofi pharmacovigilance database. For 20 cases the outcome is unknown, one miscarriage, 
one abortion, and 7 live births were recorded. In a program conducted by Center for vaccine Equity at 
the Task Force for Global Health, 40,000 doses of RIV3 were donated for influenza vaccine coverage in 
Mongolia. 333 pregnant women received RIV3. No serious AEs were reported from the passive 
surveillance network. No active follow-up of pregnancies has been performed, and the capability of 
Mongolian surveillance network to capture the pregnancy related AE are uncertain. During the clinical 
development of the RIV3 (PSC01 trial), three pregnancies were reported, two of these subjects 
reported elective termination while the third subject had an uneventful term pregnancy. In PSC04 
study involving RIV3, 20 pregnancies were reported with 12 live births, one spontaneous abortion, two 
elective abortions, and five cases were lost to follow-up. The data do not raise safety concerns, but are 
overall too limited for final conclusion. The limited experience with the use of RIV4 during pregnancy is 
adequately reflected in the SmPC. The routine pharmacovigilance activities include an observational 
study (VAP00007) to address the missing information regarding use of RIV4 during pregnancy. 
Paediatric population 
The intended indication is active immunization for use in persons 18 years of age and older for the 
prevention of influenza disease. The company conducted a clinical trial to evaluate safety, 
reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of RIV compared with IIV4 in the paediatric population from 6 to

less than 18 years of age (PSC08). This study was conducted during the 2013/2014 northern 
hemisphere influenza season and completed on 28 July 2014, but is not included into the application 
dossier. Two other studies are not finalised yet, i.e. LIO-04-16 (completion due June 2020) and 
VAP0004 (completion due). 
Immunological events 
Events possibly reflecting hypersensitivity were identified to be of interest since commercialisation of 
Flublok, the trivalent formulation of RIV4. As with most vaccines, inactivated influenza vaccines are 
associated with a risk of serious allergic reactions. Anaphylaxis and reactions related to 
hypersensitivity have been reported in the post-marketing experience with RIV4. In trial PSC12 events 
potentially reflecting hypersensitivity were recorded infrequently and were balanced between the two 
vaccine groups. The most frequently recorded event potentially representing hypersensitivity was mild 
wheezing in 0.4% (16) versus 0.5% (22) of subjects in the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine group. 4 cases 
of hypersensitivity occurred in trial PSC12, 1 in the RIV4 and 3 in the IIV4 group. The one event of 
hypersensitivity in the RIV4 vaccine group was considered unrelated to the vaccine. The applicant 
states that no subject in study PSC16 reported an AE of anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity events. 
AEs that may represent hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. rash and pruritus) were reported in subjects 
exposed to RIV4 within a few days following vaccination. The applicant provided a comparative table 
for study PSC16 showing unsolicited related and not related AEs suggesting allergic reactions.  The AEs 
of anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity events included pruritus, rash and dermatitis. Although the 
incidences of these events were rare, they were only reported in subjects vaccinated with RIV4. None 
of these events was reported in subjects vaccinated with IIV4. However, the AEs of pruritus, dermatitis 
and rash are adequately reflected in the tabulated list of AEs in section 4.8 of the updated SmPC. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies were performed for RIV4.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was comparable in the two vaccine groups in trial 
PSC12 (10 cases in RIV4 group and 12 cases in IIV4 group). Overall, 20 subjects were discontinued 
due to serious adverse events (SAEs) leading to death: 
• 
• 
In the RIV4 group, 8 deaths were recorded. None of them was related to the vaccine. 
In the IIV4 group, 12 deaths were recorded. None of them was related to the vaccine. 
Besides these deaths, 2 other subjects were discontinued due to AEs (general and psychiatric 
disorders) in the RIV4 group.  
No subject discontinued due an AE in study PSC16.  
Post marketing experience 
The first marketing authorisation for the trivalent formulation of the recombinant haemagglutinin 
influenza vaccine (RIV3), produced within the same manufacturing process like the quadrivalent 
formulation RIV4, was obtained tin the USA on 16 January 2013. The RIV3 vaccine was discontinued as 
of March 2018 and is no longer marketed in the USA. RIV4 was licensed under the tradename Flublok 
Quadrivalent in the USA on 07 October 2016.  
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020  
Page 85/99 
 
 
 
Cumulatively up to 15 January 2020, there has been no cases from post-marketing experience 
reporting fatal events involving RIV3 or RIV4. The total number of recorded AEs was 983 for RIV4 and 
672 for RIV3. For RIV4 the AE with the highest reporting incidences were related to product use, i.e. 
“product administered to patient of inappropriate age” (223 events/reporting rate 2.4.2/100.000), 
followed by “product storage error” and “wrong product administered” (61 and 53 events, reporting 
rates 0.3 and 0.55, respectively). This is followed by pain, headache, pruritus, and rash with reporting 
rates of 0.37, 0.22, 018, and 0.15 per 100,000. 
Overall, 15 SAEs RIV4 were recorded for RIV4 post licensure. This includes two cases of Guillain-Barre 
and one case of Steven-Johnson syndrome. The case of Steven-Johnson syndrome involves a 69 year 
old female who received RIV4 on 18-Oct-2019. On 26-Oct- 2019, 8 days post vaccination, patient 
developed unknown symptoms (not reported) and on 30- Oct-2019 the patient was diagnosed with 
Steven Johnson's syndrome. Co-medication included lisinopril and atorvastatin. Patient's medical 
history, medical condition at time of product use and laboratory test results were not reported. Steven-
Johnson-syndrome is included as an AE in the SmPC of atorvastatin. Because of missing information 
and the co-medication a definitive conclusion of causality is not possible. In the two cases of GBS time 
to onset after vaccination is compatible with the role of the vaccine. The medical information is not 
sufficient to draw a final conclusion. GBS is a known potential risk for influenza vaccines (class risk). 
Both Steven-Johnson-syndrome and GBS will be followed up within the routine pharmacovigilance. 
Three cluster cases of neuropathy, all from the same reporter were submitted. The cases involved 
three female vaccines who experience neuropathy on arm 14 days post vaccination with RIV4. From 
the available clinical data it is not known whether neuropathy occurred in the arm were the vaccine has 
been administered. For none of the three cases further clinical information is available, the symptoms 
were not described. In summary, it remains unclear what symptoms the females experienced. A 
causality assessment is not possible from the submitted information. 
Two case of anaphylactic reaction were recorded, one occurred 5 minutes after vaccination and 
another with unknown time to onset. The first anaphylactic reactions was experienced by a female with 
knowns allergies who had been getting "mild hives" on her jawline, and couldn't determine what they 
were from, and was taking a preventative tablet of Benadryl each day. Vaccine causality cannot be 
ruled out. The second case cannot be assessed due to missing date of onset and missing clinical 
information. Anaphylactic reaction are described for vaccines and are included into the Supemtek 
SmPC with a frequency “not known”. 
In the majority of cases (beside the one with missing information on time to onset) a temporally 
association is given. A lack of medical information and co-medication do not allow a final causality 
assessment of the SAEs. Safety evaluation of Supemtek will be performed within routine 
pharmacovigilance. Since, a clear causality cannot be established from the clinical data available from 
the SAE narratives it is not considered appropriate to include any of the events into the SmPC. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Supemtek (RIV4) is a quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine that contains a higher 
haemagglutinin antigen content (45 μg per antigen) than other licensed quadrivalent standard dose 
influenza vaccines (15 μg per antigen). RIV4 is licensed in the USA since 2016 for use in adults. The 
manufacturing process of RIV4 is based on the same as was used for the trivalent recombinant 
influenza vaccine, that was formerly licensed in the USA, with the addition of another B strain. The 
clinical trial program to support the licensure of RIV4 in the EU includes two pivotal and one supportive 
trial. In the two pivotal trials (PSC12 and PSC16), the safety and reactogenicity of RIV4 was compared 
with a licensed egg-based IIV4 (Fluarix Tetra), that contains 15 µg antigen per strain. The comparator 
Assessment report  
EMA/522939/2020

is considered acceptable. Both pivotal trials were conducted in the USA, which is also deemed 
acceptable. 
Study PSC04, used as supportive in the context of this application, was conducted with RIV3 and 
designed with the primary object of evaluating the efficacy, relative to placebo, of a single dose of 
RIV3 in a population of healthy adults aged 18-49 years. This study is considered of less relevance for 
the evaluation of safety of the quadrivalent product. 
The study population in both pivotal trials included ambulatory and medically stable adults ≥50 years 
of age (trial PSC12) or 18-49 years of age (trial PSC16) without contraindication to the vaccines and 
who did not have underlying conditions that might complicate the evaluation of the primary endpoints. 
The safety database is considered sufficient for the licensure of RIV4. A total of 5,326 subjects received 
one dose of RIV4 in the two pivotal trials, i.e. 998 adults 18 to 49 years of age in trial PSC16, and 
4,328 adults ≥50 years of age in study PSC12. The safety population of RIV4 included 2,569 
individuals 50-64 years of age, 1,234 individuals 65 to 74 years, and 525 individuals ≥75 years of age. 
Local and systemic reactogenicity was comparable between RIV4 and the comparator vaccine group in 
trials PSC12 and PSC16. The majority of local and systemic solicited reactions were mild to moderate 
in both vaccine groups and both trials. The most frequently reported local solicited reaction in both 
vaccine groups was local tenderness, followed by local pain. The incidence of solicited systemic 
reactions was lower than the incidence of solicited local reactions in both vaccine groups and was 
comparable between the two groups, in both trials. The most frequently reported solicited systemic 
reactions in the RIV4 and the IIV4 vaccine group were fatigue and headache, followed by joint and 
muscle pain. Fever events were uncommon in both vaccine groups and both trials. 
Differences in the frequency of solicited injection site reactions were observed in both trials related to 
gender, race, and ethnicity, and in trial PSC12 also related to age. Local reactogenicity occurred within 
the same range, but tended to be higher in females compared with males, in white subjects compared 
with non-white subjects, and in non-hispanic subjects compared with hispanic subjects. Reactogenicity 
tended to be also higher in younger individuals 50 to 64 years of age, compared with those older than 
64 years of age. Like for solicited local reactions, demographic differences regarding solicited systemic 
reactogenicity were observed in both trials, but less notable. These effects are results of complex 
genetic, immunological, hormonal and environmental interactions and not yet entirely understood. A 
lower reactogenicity in elderly compared with younger individuals is well known for vaccines and 
associated with a lower immune response in the elderly caused by immunosenescence. Sex-based 
differences in vaccine response are also described in literature. Data about racial and ethnic disparity 
in vaccine immune response are limited, and underlying mechanisms and contributing factors are not 
well known. The demographic differences observed in the two trials were not large and were observed 
for both vaccines. They are not considered of clinical importance in any of the subgroups, regarding 
the reactogenicity profile and risk/benefit ratio of the product. 
The safety profile of the two vaccines was comparable in the two trials. Frequency and nature of AEs 
was balanced between the two vaccine groups in both trials. In none of the two trials SAEs considered 
being vaccine related were recorded. However, the SAE of myocardial infarction was slightly more 
frequently reported in the RIV4 group compared to the IIV4 arm. All subjects who suffered from MI in 
study PSC12 (4 subjects in RIV4 and 3 subjects in IIV4) had comorbidities that are associated with 
increased risk for cardiovascular events including increased age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
hypercholesterolemia and/or diabetes mellitus and thus reflect a population of high risk of MI. 
However, in study PSC16 the subjects (2 subjects in RIV4 and none in IIV4) who suffered from MI 
were <45 years of age (37 and 44 years of age). The 44-year old subject had comorbidities of 
hypertriglyceridemia (since 2012) and diabetes mellitus type II (since 2011) which are associated with 
an increased risk for cardiovascular events. The 37-year old subject who suffered from myocardial

infarction on day 88 received concomitant medications of steroid injections (since 01 May 2012), 
tramadol (since 06 January 2014) and Flexeril (since 06 July 2014). Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) is 
closely related to tricyclic antidepressants which are known to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, 
prolongation of conduction time leading to myocardial infarction and stroke. Considering the lack of 
temporal association as well as any additional inflammatory signs or symptoms indicating 
pathophysiology related to vaccination, it is agreed to that these events were judged as not related to 
the vaccination. 
The use of RIV4 during pregnancy has not been studied. A high level summary of post-marketing 
experience with RIV3 and RIV4 from the use in the USA has been submitted within RMP and in the 
summary of clinical safety. Also a high level summary of pregnancy outcomes from trial PSC16 was 
provided. The pregnancy data are overall too limited for a final conclusion. The limited experience with 
the use of RIV4 during pregnancy is adequately reflected in the SmPC. An observational study 
(VAP00007) will be conducted after licensure. The objective of this Phase IV study is to estimate the 
relative vaccine effectiveness of RIV4 versus a standard dose inactivated influenza vaccine against all 
PCR-confirmed influenza in vaccinees aged 18–64 years.  Safety data from the pregnancy effectiveness 
study will be reported, as per the legislation, as part of the post-marketing data with potential impact 
on the R/B balance, in the PSURs, if they will result in meaningful safety data.  
Indication is only sought for the adult population. The company conducted a clinical trial to evaluate 
safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of RIV4 compared with IIV4 in the paediatric population 
from 6 to less than 18 years of age (PSC08). This study was conducted during the 2013/2014 northern 
hemisphere influenza season and completed on 28 July 2014, but is not included into the application 
dossier. Two other studies, i.e. LIO-04-16 (completion due June 2020) and VAP0004 (completion due) 
are not finalised yet. 
In general, the methodology for collecting safety data is deemed acceptable. The submitted clinical 
safety data overall indicate an acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile for RIV4. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The submitted clinical safety data overall indicate an acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile for 
Supemtek, the recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine. RIV4 was not more reactogenic than IIV4, 
though the antigen content in RIV4 is higher. No safety concerns or major safety objections could be 
identified.  
The safety profile of RIV4 will be further characterised through post-marketing safety surveillance, 
encompassing analysis of spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions in periodic safety reports, 
product technical complaints (PTCs) relating to adverse events and signal detection.

Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 16.01.2013. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. The PSUR cycle will be yearly. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that quadrivalent influenza virus haemagglutinin has been previously authorised 
in a medicinal product in the European Union but differs significantly with regard to safety and/or 
efficacy due to differences in molecular structure, nature of the source material or manufacturing 
process. 
The CHMP considers that, based on the available quality and clinical data, recombinant influenza 
A/H3N2 virus haemagglutinin is considered to be a new active substance as it differs significantly in 
properties with regard to safety and efficacy from other influenza H3N2 virus haemagglutinin contained 
in medicinal products previously authorised within the European Union due to differences in molecular 
structure, nature of the source material or manufacturing process.  
The applicant claims that the improved efficacy seen against H3N2 is truly attributable to different HA 
glycosylation. Most probably, the higher efficacy against H3N2 is rather because the HA is expressed in 
insect cells and is therefore less prone to acquiring mutations during production and therefore simply 
better matches circulating strains (including drift variants). The data revealing a better efficacy in 
elderly come from a H3N2-dominated season (2014-2015, Dunkle et al., 2017) and are not 
representative for all four influenza strains included in the Supemtek vaccine. The same is true for the 
data referenced for the 2017-2018 season (Belongia et al., 2020). In the latter however a certain 
advantage in terms of immunogenicity for H3N2 strains is detectable in recipients of Supemtek as 
compared to other influenza vaccines that is even more pronounced for drifted viral strains.  
From a safety perspective, the recombinant influenza virus haemagglutinin within Supemtek show a 
better safety profile than conventional split and subunit vaccines due to differences in the nature of 
source material and manufacturing process (e.g. no exposure to inactivation agents, absence of micro-
aggregates or viral RNA fragments in combination with lipids). 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Supemtek (Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine 
(recombinant, prepared in cell culture)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it is a biological 
medicine, such as a vaccine or a medicine derived from plasma (blood), authorised in the EU after 1 
January 2011.

Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Influenza is an infectious acute respiratory disease of global importance that occurs in annual 
epidemics in the northern hemisphere (NH) and southern hemisphere (SH). The influenza virus is 
transmitted by respiratory droplets or aerosols containing the influenza virus particles and subsequent 
inhalation of infectious particles or self-inoculation from a contaminated surface. Clinical manifestation 
of influenza virus infection is characterised by an abrupt onset of nonspecific respiratory and systemic 
effects, such as fever, myalgia, headache, malaise, non-productive cough, sore throat and rhinitis.   
Some individuals are more prone than others to develop complications from influenza, e.g. bacterial 
pneumonia or other organ dysfunction. Severe influenza and complicated influenza potentially leading 
to hospitalisation and death are more likely to occur in vulnerable populations, such as older people (≥
65 years of age, in part due to the age related decline of the immune response (immunosenescence)), 
pregnant women, younger children (especially up to 24 months of age), and patients with chronic 
underlying diseases. These groups are considered at risk and represent the priority target for influenza 
vaccination programmes in the EU. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies  
Vaccination is considered the best approach to lower the burden of influenza disease. Different 
seasonal inactivated (split virion or subunit) influenza vaccines (quadrivalent and trivalent) are licensed 
for children aged 6 months and older, adolescents and adults, as well as a Live Attenuated Influenza 
Vaccine licensed for children and adolescents aged 2 years to 17 years. 
Differences between the circulating strains and those included in the vaccine as a result of antigenic 
drift poses another key challenge for conventional influenza vaccines as it decreases vaccine efficacy. 
This is particularly relevant since A/H3N2 shows a high rate of evolution among the influenza subtypes 
currently circulating with antigenically distinct strains emerging on average every 2 to 5 years. 
In elderly, immune responses against conventional (trivalent) inactivated influenza vaccines has been 
shown to be lower than in younger adults due to immunosenescence. In line with this, clinical vaccine 
efficacy estimates were lower in older adults (17% to 53 %) as compared to younger adults (70% to 
90%) (Goodwin et al. 2006). Therefore, there is a need for improved influenza vaccines for these age 
groups, i.e. children and elderly. 
There is no effective treatment for influenza, and clinical management is based mostly on symptomatic 
treatment. Few antiviral drugs are available which may be able to reduce disease severity and 
duration, but they need to be taken soon after infection in order to be effective and can induce drug-
resistant mutants.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Supemtek clinical development presented three phase III studies (PSC12, PSC16, PSC04) to be used 
to support the effective use of RIV4 in subjects 18 years of age and older for the present application. 
PSC12 and PSC16 were pivotal studies that were run with RIV4 in older adults ≥50 years and young 
adults 18 to 49 years of age, respectively, to demonstrate vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity of 
RIV4, whereas PSC04 was a supportive study conducted with RIV3 to establish vaccine efficacy in 
young healthy adults from 18 to 49 years of age. 
The pivotal PSC12 trial was a randomised observer-blind active-controlled multicentre study of 
efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of RIV4 in older medically-stable adults ≥50 years of age 
(N=8,963); the primary objective was to demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy of one single IM dose of 
RIV4 compared to a US and EU-licensed IIV4. The second pivotal study PSC16 was a randomised 
observer-blind active comparator-controlled multicentre study of immunogenicity and safety of RIV4 in 
healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age (N=1,350); the primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferior 
immunogenicity of RIV4 compared to IIV4 for each vaccine strain. The supportive PSC04 was a 
randomised observer-blind placebo-controlled multicentre study of immunogenicity, safety, 
reactogenicity, efficacy, effectiveness and lot consistency of RIV3 in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of 
age (N=4,648). 
The virus strains selected for the RIV4 and the RIV3 were in compliance with the seasonal influenza 
WHO recommendations for influenza vaccine strains chosen for each influenza seasons. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In PSC12, the preventative efficacy of RIV4 following single 0.5 mL IM dose administration is evident 
by demonstrating statistically non-inferior to that of IIV4 in medically stable adults ≥50 years of age. 
The overall rVE against rtPCR-positive protocol-defined ILI due to any strain in per protocol population 
was 30% (95%CI: 10%, 47%). rVE persisted for at least 6 months. 
This treatment effect was confirmed by a key secondary endpoint (culture confirmed ILI according to 
CDC ILI definition) and a post-hoc exploratory endpoint based on all culture-confirmed influenza. 
In exploratory analysis of PSC12 using subjects having not received influenza vaccines in the prior 
season, a greater treatment effect than reported in the primary efficacy analysis was shown. 
Further post-hoc analysis showed that the demonstrated rVE was primarily attributable to the 
predominant efficacy of RIV4 against influenza A strains, mostly A/H3. Whereas against influenza B 
strains, only the same attack rates in RIV4 recipients and IIV4 recipients were observed. 
Because the rVE lower bound of 95%CI was >9% - a criterion for superiority test (exploratory 
analysis), the applicant concluded that this exploratory efficacy endpoint was met. 
Immunogenicity data are available in a subset (about 7% or n~300 in each arm) of subjects from trial 
PSC12. The post-vaccination HAI GMTs among RIV4 recipients showed non-inferiority according to 
CBER guidance for three of the four antigens (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B/Yamagata). The GMT ratio’s 
between RIV4 and IIV4 were 1.15 (95%CI: 0.95, 1.41), 0.69 (95%CI: 0.58, 0.82) and 1.04 (95%CI: 
0.86, 1.24) for the A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B/Yamagata strains respectively. Seroconversion rates (SCR) 
induced by RIV4 were non-inferior to those in the IIV4 group for the strains A/H3N2 and B/Yamagata. 
The difference in SCR was -11.2% (95% CI: -19.0, -3.3) and -0.6% (95% CI: -8.2, 7.2) for A/H3N2 
and B/Yamagata, respectively. 
Overall, one 0.5 mL IM dose of RIV4 is demonstrated immunogenic for each vaccine strain in subjects 
≥50 years of age, where RIV4 induced more robust HAI response to A/H3 strain but blunted HAI

response to influenza B strains. This immunogenicity profile of RIV4 is consistent with demonstrated 
efficacy of this vaccine in PSC12. 
In study PSC16 conducted in adults 18 to 49 years of age the immunogenicity parameters 
seroconversion rate and GMT-ratio at day 28 were defined as co-primary endpoints and non-inferiority 
according to CBER criteria could be shown for both A strains as well as for B/Yamagata. The GMT ratios 
between RIV4 and IIV4 were 0.81 (95%CI: 0.71, 0.92), 0.50 (95%CI: 0.44, 0.57) and 0.86 (95%CI: 
0.74, 0.99) for the A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B/Yamagata strains respectively. The difference in SCR was -
3.2% (95% CI: -9.2, 2.8), -15.2% (95% CI: -21.3, -9.1) and 0.7% (95% CI: -5.4, 6.9) for A/H1N1, 
A/H3N2 and B/Yamagata, respectively. 
In PSC04 conducted in healthy adults aged 18 to 49 years, one single 0.5 mL IM dose of RIV3 is 
demonstrated efficacious in preventing against the culture positive CDC-ILI due to any strain, with rVE 
estimated at 44.6% (95%CI: 18.8, 62.6) in the ITT population in an exploratory analysis. This effect 
was revealed to be primarily ascribed to the apparent efficacy against influenza A strains. 
Data from immunogenicity subset of PSC04 demonstrate that RIV3 is immunogenic for each vaccine 
strain and that SCRs and SPRs induced by single dose of RIV3 met CBER criteria. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Against influenza B strains, rVE of RIV4 relative to IIV4 has not been demonstrated in PSC12, and the 
same holds for RIV3 relative to saline placebo in PSC04. However, the same attack rates of influenza B 
strains observed in the RIV4 vs IIV4 recipients of PSC12 study may suggest similar efficacy of the two 
vaccines.  In PSC04 supportive study, a trend towards cross-protective efficacy of RIV3 (containing 
A/H3, A/H1, and B/Victoria vaccine strain) against influenza B/Yamagata strain was suggested by the 
reduced number of influenza B cases in the RIV3 vs placebo recipients. This sign of evidence for cross-
protection between influenza B strains observed in PSC04 suggests that RIV4 may be effective against 
B/Victoria strain.  
In study PSC16, the results for the B/Victoria strain illustrate that the upper bounds of the confidence 
intervals for the recombinant vaccine were well below the lower bounds of the CIs for the egg-derived 
vaccine, leading to the conclusion that the immunogenicity for B/Victoria falls short of the magnitude of 
response expected from an influenza vaccine. Antibody titres are only surrogates for clinical efficacy 
and the clinical relevance of this difference is unknown. Haemagglutinin assays may produce a 
different readout for an egg-derived versus a recombinant antigen, but it is of concern, that 
immunogenicity data consistently cannot demonstrate non-inferiority for B/Victoria, while for 
B/Yamagata no such issue is evident. The uncertainty of immunogenicity related to B/Victoria strain 
has not been explicitly addressed by the clinical efficacy data provided in this dossier, as no conclusive 
vaccine efficacy for B/Victoria could be shown in trial PSC12. It should however be noted that PSC12 
study was not designed with adequate power to demonstrate non-inferior efficacy of RIV4 vs IIV4 
against each individual strain.  
On subgroup analysis, the effect size seen in primary analysis of PSC12 was not reproduced in subjects 
≥65 years of age or subjects having received influenza vaccines in the prior season. It remains an 
open question whether the >9% of rVE with 95%CI observed for RIV4 over IIV4 could hold in subjects 
with chronic medical conditions or in influenza seasons with good antigenic match and apparent 
mismatch of A/H3 strain.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The local and systemic reactions recorded for both vaccines are not unexpected for influenza vaccines 
regarding nature, frequency and severity. The reactogenicity of RIV4 was comparable to the 
reactogenicity of the comparator. The most frequently reported local solicited reaction in both vaccine 
groups was local tenderness, followed by local pain. The majority of local solicited reactions were mild 
to moderate in both vaccine groups. The most frequently reported systemic symptoms were fatigue, 
headache, joint and muscle pain in both vaccine groups. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Demographic differences in the frequency of solicited injection site reactions were observed in both 
trials, and in both vaccine groups related to gender, age, race, and ethnicity. In both trials and both 
vaccine groups, reactogenicity events tended to be more frequently reported by females compared 
with males, by white subjects compared with non-white subjects, and by non-hispanic subjects 
compared with hispanic subjects. Reactogenicity tended also to be higher in individuals 50 to 64 years 
of age, compared in those older than 64 years of age. It should be noted that, though the frequency 
tended to be higher, the events occurred within the same range. This observation is a result of 
complex genetic, immunological, hormonal and environmental interactions and not yet entirely 
understood. However, a lower reactogenicity in elderly compared with younger individuals is well 
known for vaccines and associated with a lower immune response in the elderly caused by immune-
senescence. 
Data including the frequency of treatment related MAEs experienced by at least one subject in PSC12 
in both treatment groups was provided. The treatment related MAEs were reported from 774 (17.9%) 
and 785 (18.1%) subjects in the RIV4 and IIV4 groups, respectively. However, the incidence of 
vaccine-related MAEs was 0.5% in both treatment groups. The most frequently reported MAEs were in 
the SOCs “Infections and infestations” (0.3% RIV4 and 0.2% IIV4) and “Respiratory tract infection and 
mediastinal disorders” (0.1% RIV4 and 0.2% IIV4). Within these SOCs, no noteworthy differences 
were observed in any of the preferred terms. Most of the MAEs were reported in only one or two 
subjects. The only MAEs that were reported from ≥ 2 subjects in either treatment group were upper 
respiratory infection, bronchitis and cough. Overall, the incidence of vaccine-related MAEs was low in 
study PSC12 and no noteworthy difference was observed in any of the preferred terms between the 
vaccine groups. The applicant clarified that the incidence of vaccine-related MAEs in study PSC16 was 
0.2% in the RIV4 and 0.6% in the IIV4 group. The treatment-related MAEs were only reported in the 
SOCs “Infections and infestations” (0.2% RIV4 and 0.3% IIV4) and “Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders” (0.0% RIV4 and 0.3% IIV4). Within these SOCs, each preferred term was reported by one 
subject each. The incidence of vaccine-related MAEs was low in study PSC16 and did not raise any 
safety concerns. 
In relation to age strata, the number of subjects experiencing at least one SAE after vaccination was 
2.5% among subjects 50-64 years of age, 3.7% among subjects 65-74 years of age, 4.6% among 
subjects ≥65 years of age and 6.7% among subjects ≥75 years of age. The incidence of SAE was 
comparable in the age categories of both vaccine groups (RIV4 and IIV4). As expected, the incidence 
of SAE tended to increase with age. The number of subjects with at least one SAE was slightly higher 
in male subjects (4%) compared to female subjects (2.9%) in the RIV4 arm. In subjects vaccinated 
with IIV4, the incidence of SAE was comparable between male and female subjects (3% in both 
groups). The number of subjects with at least one SAE were slightly lower in Caucasian/white subjects 
(3.3%) compared to blacks/African American (3.9%). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity showed a slightly 
higher incidence of SAE in non-Hispanic (3.4%) compared to Hispanic (2.4%) subjects vaccinated with

RIV4. In subjects vaccinated with IIV4, Hispanic subjects (5.5%) reported a higher incidence of at 
least one SAE compared to non-Hispanic (2.9%).  
The incidence of MEAs increased with age (15.3% in subjects aged 50 – 64 years of age, 20.3% in 
subjects 65 – 74% and 24.6% in subjects ≥75 years of age). Slightly higher incidence of MAEs were 
reported in female subjects (19.9%) compared to male subjects (15.5%). Subpopulation analyses of 
SAEs by race and ethnicity revealed higher rates in whites as compared to blacks/African Americans 
and in non-Hispanic (18%) as compared to Hispanic (14.6%).  
Overall, no safety concerns arise from the provided data. It has to be noted that the requested 
subgroup analyses for SAE and MAE have only been provided for study PSC12 and not for study PSC16 
conducted in adults 18 to 49 years of age. However, considering that subgroup analyses by race and 
ethnicity need to be interpreted with caution because the number of subjects belonging in racial groups 
other than whites or blacks/African American or subjects with Hispanic/Latino ethnicity were 
underrepresented in these studies, subgroup analyses by race and ethnicity for study PSC16 might be 
less informative. 
The SAE of myocardial infarction (MI) was slightly more frequently reported in the RIV4 group 
compared to the IIV4 arm. Elderly subjects who suffered from MI had comorbidities that are associated 
with increased risk for cardiovascular events including increased age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
hypercholesterolemia and/or diabetes mellitus and thus reflect a population of high risk of MI. 
However, in study PSC16 conducted in adults 18 to 49 years of age two subjects treated with RIV4 
suffered from MI. Both subjects were <45 years of age (37 and 44 years of age) and did not have any 
medical history that might be associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events. The 44-year 
old subject who suffered from myocardial infarction on day 146 had comorbidities of 
hypertriglyceridemia (since 2012) and diabetes mellitus type II (since 2011) which are associated with 
an increased risk for cardiovascular events. Considering the lack of temporal association, any 
additional inflammatory signs or symptoms indicating pathophysiology related to vaccination as well as 
the reported comorbid conditions of hypertriglyceridemia and type II diabetes mellitus, it is agreed to 
judge the event as not related to the vaccination.  The 37-year old subject who suffered from 
myocardial infarction on day 88 received concomitant medications of steroid injections (since 01 May 
2012), tramadol (since 06 January 2014) and Flexeril (since 06 July 2014). Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril) 
is closely related to tricyclic antidepressants which are known to produce arrhythmias, sinus 
tachycardia, prolongation of conduction time leading to myocardial infarction and stroke. Although 
causal relationship between Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine) and the occurrence of cardiovascular events 
including myocardial infarction could not be established (causal relationship unknown), it is 
contraindicated in the acute recovery phase of myocardial infarction and patients with arrhythmias, 
heart block or conduction disturbance or congestive heart failure due the potential side effect on the 
heart. Additionally, as no other inflammatory pathophysiology have been reported as well as 
considering no temporal relationship it is also for the second case agreed to judge it as not related to 
the vaccine.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important favourable effect is the clinical efficacy of RIV4 in the older medically stable adult 
subjects ≥50 years of age. The rVE of RIV4 was demonstrated statistically non-inferior to that of a US 
and EU-licensed standard dose of IIV4 in preventing against rtPCR-confirmed protocol-defined ILI. The 
overall rVE of RIV4 vs IIV4 in the efficacy population was estimated at 30% (95%CI: 10, 47%), which 
was primarily attributable to the predominant efficacy against influenza A strains, especially A/H3N2 
strain. RIV4 is able to induce HAI response to each vaccine strain after one 0.5 mL IM dose of 
administration. Further favourable effect is clinical efficacy of RIV3 in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of 
age. RIV3 was 44.6% (95%CI: 18.8, 62.6) effective, relative to placebo, in the ITT population, in 
preventing against the culture positive CDC-ILI due to any strain. This effect was revealed to be 
primarily ascribed to its apparent efficacy against influenza A strains. 
For rVE against influenza B infection in PSC12, the confidence intervals were extremely wide due to the 
low incidence of cases. More than 70% of circulating B strains in 2014/15 were of the B/Yamagata 
lineage, thus driving the B strain results. The non-inferiority of antibody titres against B/Yamagata 
could be replicated in both pivotal trials in comparison to an egg-derived licensed vaccine. Therefore, 
efficacy of Supemtek against infection with the B/Yamagata strain can be accepted despite the scarcity 
of provided data. However, clinical efficacy of Supemtek against the fourth strain included in the 
quadrivalent vaccine (B/Victoria) could neither be demonstrated by the clinical efficacy study PSC12 
since the circulating strains did not include B/Victoria nor by immunogenicity data since this strain 
showed consistently inferior antibody levels. The available data raise considerable doubts that the 
B/Victoria component is adequately immunogenic. This concern is further aggravated by the evidence 
that the trivalent parent vaccine, FluBlok, which was never licensed in the EU, also could not elicit a 
substantial immune response against the B/Victoria in its clinical trials (as evidenced in the FDA Clinical 
Review from January 2013). Further data provided from two independent clinical trials showed that 
RIV4 induced comparable humoral responses (GMT, GMTR, SCR) to each of the vaccine strains 
(including B/Victoria lineage), as did an egg-derived quadrivalent influenza vaccine.  
Vaccination was generally associated with a reactogenicity profile common to most vaccines. No safety 
concerns or major safety objections could be identified. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Clinical benefit of RIV4 in the protection against influenza A and B/Yamagata lineage is demonstrated 
from the pivotal studies PSC12, PSC16 and supportive study PSC04. The concern of lack of 
demonstration of clinical protection against B/Victoria infection discussed in PSC12 was alleviated by 
further data demonstrating that RIV4 induced comparable humoral responses (GMT, GMTR, SCR) to 
each of the vaccine strains (including B/Victoria lineage), as did an egg-derived quadrivalent influenza 
vaccine. 
The observed unfavourable effects were generally consistent with the nature and frequency of AEs 
expected after influenza vaccine administration and the multimorbidity of the investigated elderly 
population. Overall, the clinical benefit-risk balance of Supemtek is currently positive.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Supemtek is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Supemtek is favourable in the following indication: 
“Supemtek is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of influenza disease in 
adults.  
Supemtek should be used in accordance with official recommendations.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Official batch release 
In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a 
state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that recombinant influenza A/H3N2 
virus haemagglutinin is a new active substance as it differs significantly in properties with regard to 
safety and efficacy from other influenza A/H3N2 virus haemagglutinin contained in medicinal products 
previously authorised within the European Union due to differences in molecular structure, nature of 
the source material or manufacturing process.  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0219/2019 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

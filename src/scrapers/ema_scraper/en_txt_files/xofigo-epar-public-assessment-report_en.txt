2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in men, affecting approximately 323,000 
men in the EU including 71,000 fatalities from the disease. The incidence rate of about 135 cases per 
100,000 men increases sharply with age, and is peaking at ≥75 years (781 per 100,000). Bone is the 
dominant site of metastases in prostate cancer. Depending on its location (e.g. spine) or bone marrow 
involvement, bone metastases result in potentially severe morbidity including bone pain, bone fractures, 
compression of the spinal cord and haematological consequences of bone marrow involvement such as 
anaemia. Nearly all treatments are directed toward eradicating or limiting osseous metastases or 
palliating the side effects. Once prostate cancer becomes metastatic, the survival of the patient is 
correlated with the extent of the disease.  
As prostate cancer cells are stimulated by testosterone, conventional androgen deprivation therapy aims 
to reach castration levels of testosterone which can be effective initially to control the bone metastases. 
However, most patients eventually become castration-resistant. Approximately 50% of patients with 
bone-metastatic prostate cancer die of prostate cancer within 30 months, and 80% within 5 years.  Early 
stages of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with bone metastases are associated with 
substantial pain (35% of patients) and rising levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in 90% of patients.  
Current treatment options in metastatic CRPC include abiraterone in combination with prednisone or 
prednisolone for patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease who are not yet eligible for 
chemotherapy, based on an overall survival benefit compared to placebo, and docetaxel in combination 
with prednisone, based on an overall survival benefit observed in a direct comparison with mitoxantrone. 
However, the potential haematological toxicity as well as clinical status of patients preclude a 
considerable proportion of patients from receiving this treatment: an estimated 40-60% of those who die 
of prostate cancer had never received docetaxel either because they were not considered eligible to 
tolerate the toxicity of docetaxel chemotherapy, or because they declined therapy due to concern about 
adverse events. 
Cabazitaxel in combination with prednisone has been approved for the treatment of patients with 
hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen on 
the basis of improved median OS compared to mitoxantrone.  Furthermore, abiraterone acetate in 
combination with prednisone or prednisolone has also been approved for the treatment of metastatic 
castration resistant prostate cancer in adult men who have failed a docetaxel-based chemotherapy 
regimen, based on an OS benefit compared to placebo.  
For palliation of bone pain from metastases the bone-targeting radionuclides strontium-89 and 
samarium-153 EDTMP are currently available. Both, however, are emitters of beta radiation which due to 
the long range of beta particles exerts toxicity to the haematopoietic cells of the bone marrow thereby 
restricting their clinical use mainly to pain palliation. The impact on survival of these palliative treatment 
options for CRPC patients with bone metastases has not been studied. Bone metastases are currently

treated mainly with either bisphosphonates or anti-RANKL antibodies, both interfering with bone turnover 
without cytotoxic action. The main benefit of these treatments is delay of skeletal-related events.  
About the product 
Xofigo is a therapeutic alpha particle-emitting pharmaceutical. The active ingredient is radium-223 with a 
half-life of 11.4 days. The specific activity of radium-223 is 1.9 MBq/ng. 
The six-stage-decay of radium-223 to lead-207 occurs via short-lived daughters, and is accompanied by 
a number of alpha, beta and gamma emissions with different energies and emission probabilities. The 
fraction of energy emitted from radium-223 and its daughters as alpha-particles is 95.3% (energy range 
of 5.0   7.5 MeV). The fraction emitted as beta-particles is 3.6% (average energies are 0.445 MeV and 
0.492 MeV), and the fraction emitted as gamma-radiation is 1.1% (energy range of 0.01 - 1.27 MeV). 
Figure 1.  Radium-223 decay chain with physical half-lives and mode of decay 
Radium-223 (as radium-223 dichloride) mimics calcium and selectively targets bone, specifically areas of 
bone metastases associated with high bone turnover, by forming complexes with the bone mineral 
hydroxyapatite. The high linear energy transfer of alpha emitters (80 keV/µm) is considered to lead to a 
high frequency of double-strand DNA breaks in adjacent tumour cells, resulting in a cytotoxic effect. 
Moreover, an inhibition of osteoclast differentiation and osteoblast activity which was seen in vitro may 
also account to the in vivo efficacy. The alpha particle range from radium-223 is less than 100 µm (less 
than 10 cell diameters) which minimises damage to the surrounding normal tissue.  
The Applicant applied for the indication: Xofigo is indicated for the treatment of castration-resistant 
prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. 
The finally approved indication is the following: Xofigo is indicated for the treatment of adults with 
castration-resistant prostate cancer, symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastases.  
The dose regimen of Xofigo is 50 kBq per kg body weight, given at 4 week intervals for 6 injections. 
Xofigo is for intravenous use. It must be administered by slow injection (generally up to 1 minute). The 
Assessment report

intravenous access line or cannula must be flushed with isotonic sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) 
solution for injection before and after injection of Xofigo. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as solution for injection.  Each ml of solution contains 1000 kBq radium 
Ra 223 chloride (radium-223 dichloride), corresponding to 0.53 ng radium-223 at the reference date as 
active substance.  
Other ingredients are: water for injection, sodium citrate, sodium chloride, and hydrochloric acid.  
The product is available in colourless Type I glass vial, closed with a grey chlorobutyl rubber stopper and 
aluminium seal. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The chemical name of active substance is Radium-223 dichloride (Radium-223 chloride can also be used). 
The active moiety of the Radium-223 dichloride active substance is the divalent cation of Radium-223, 
223Ra2+. 
The active substance solution is a radioactive, clear and colourless aqueous solution of radium-223 
dichloride with divalent carrier free radium-223 cations as the active moiety. Radium-223 is an alpha 
particle emitter (alpha emitter) with a physical half-life of 11.4 days. The active substance solution has 
identical composition as the finished product with the exception of radium-223 dichloride concentration. 
Manufacture 
Radium-223 is generated by natural decay of a mother nuclide. Data and discussion on the presence of 
potential chemical and radionuclidic impurities in the starting material was provided. 
The radionuclide purity as the main quality feature of this type of active substance is assured by high 
resolution gamma spectroscopy. However, based on the currently proposed specification for the 
radionuclidic purity of the starting material, a definite radionuclidic purity value cannot be drawn since 
only the limit for two specified radionuclidic impurities and a limit for any unknown gamma impurities are 
included. Therefore, the CHMP recommends that the applicant should include a limit for ‘Total unspecified 
gamma peaks’ or a limit for radionuclidic purity of the actinium-227 activity in the starting material 
specification.  
The active substance is synthesized in 8 main steps.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The characterisation of the active 
substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active 
substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and 
characterised.  
The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have 
been presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 10/86 
 
 
 
 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, radionuclidic identity (Gamma 
spectroscopy), pH (Ph Eur), osmolality (Ph Eur), citrate (UV/VIS spectroscopy), radionuclidic purity 
(Gamma spectroscopy).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Based on the presented data the radionuclidic purity in view of the potential impurities from the mother 
nuclides is sufficiently assured. 
Batch analysis data of 3 production batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability studies were performed to generate holding time data for three representative batches of the 
radium - 223 chloride active substance solution in pilot scale and in production scale. 
In the production setting the active substance solution will be stored in the proposed compounding 
container at ambient room temperature and humidity within the dedicated production hot cell until 
production of the finished product. These conditions are not in accordance with the ICH guidelines. This is 
justified because the active substance solution is never stored outside a dedicated hot cell.  
The studies were performed under the same conditions as the production, i.e. ambient room temperature 
and humidity. The glass bottles were only tested in upright position as the active substance container is 
not subject to any shipment, and will always be stored in this fixed position prior to production of the 
finished product. 
All stability indicating parameters (appearance, pH, osmolality, citrate and assay) were tested according 
to the test procedure and evaluated against the specification. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
However, for new stability studies with higher radioactive concentrations, the CHMP recommends to take 
the trend in chemical stability (citrate and pH changes in relation to radioactive concentration) into 
consideration 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product was developed as a ready-to-use, aqueous solution of radium-223 chloride for 
intravenous injection. With the exception of the radium-223 concentration and calcium chloride 
concentration, the composition of the finished product is the same as for the active substance solution. 
This allows for manufacturing of the finished product by dilution of the active substance solution with the 
premixed excipient solution (sodium citrate solution in sodium chloride) to achieve the claimed 
radium-223 radioactivity concentration and maintaining isotonicity and physiological pH 
The finished product is obtained by dilution of the active substance solution. The manufacturing process 
development is adequate for a sterile solution for injection which contains a chemically stable active 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 11/86 
 
 
 
 
substance, well known simple excipients and which can be sterilised according standard conditions by 
heat.  
In view to the microbiological attributes it is evident that the alpha irradiation generates an antimicrobial 
environment. Taking into account that the finished product is terminally sterilized by heat using standard 
conditions the sterile status of the finished product is assured. 
Sodium chloride is added to achieve isotonicity. The concentration of sodium citrate and hydrochloric acid 
was found sufficient to maintain the pH of the final finished product in the range of 6.0 - 8.0 throughout 
the shelf life. 
Calcium chloride is added to the active substance solution to prevent adhesion of radium-223 ions to 
components in contact with the active substance. The amount of calcium chloride added to the active 
substance batch is constant, independent from the radioactivity concentration of the active substance 
batch. The amount of calcium chloride in the finished product will vary since the active substance is 
diluted depending on its radioactivity concentration, and the solution used for dilution contains no further 
calcium chloride. Since the total concentration of calcium carried over into the finished product is very low 
and will vary between batches, calcium is not declared as a component in the finished product.  
The CHMP recommends to perform analytical tests towards the influence of calcium ions to the prevention 
of radium-223 absorption to the surfaces of the primary packaging components and typical 
administration syringe/kits if the radioactive concentration of the active substance solution is increased 
above the current approved specification limit.Xofigo is a ready-to-use solution and should not be diluted 
or mixed with any solutions. 
Towards convenient use in the case of radiopharmaceuticals as solution for injections always the question 
occurs if the finished product can be solved with physiological saline or other solutions which facilitates 
the use. For Xofigo dilution is generally excluded but recognising the chemical character of radium ions 
dilution, at least with aqueous solution containing the excipients including some amount of calcium, will 
be possible. Therefore the CHMP recommends further development studies in view to the solubility / 
compatibility of the finished product 
The process modifications and scale up of the active substance purification process during development 
had a minor impact on the finished product composition.  
The finished product formulation from early development through clinical phases and to production scale 
have been the same, with the exception of some specific batches produced at lower radioactivity 
concentration to accommodate suitable injection volumes during studies with a wide range of dose levels. 
The primary packaging is Type I glass vial. The suitability of this container closure system for packaging 
of radium-223 chloride solution for injection is demonstrated in stability studies, leachable/migration 
studies, and container closure integrity studies. There is no indication of any incompatibility between the 
primary packaging material and the components of the solution. The bioburden and bacterial endotoxin 
tests on the packaging materials are carried out by the supplier of the glass vials and stoppers and are 
included in the packaging specifications. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Assessment report

Manufacture of the product 
Radium-223 chloride solution for injection is produced by dilution of radium-223 chloride active substance 
solution to achieve the target radioactivity concentration, followed by filling and terminal sterilization by 
autoclaving. The finished product manufacturing process consists of the following main steps: dilution 
and mixing (to obtain target radioactivity concentration), filling and sterilization (autoclaving). 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance, radionuclidic identity (gamma spectroscopy), particulate matter (Ph Eur), pH (Ph Eur), 
osmolality (Ph Eur), assay citrate (UV/VIS spectroscopy), assay chloride (ion chromatography, chemical 
impurities (ICP-MS and FIMS), radionuclidic purity (gamma spectroscopy – not tested on the finished 
product, the results are carried forward from radium-223 chloride drug substance to be included in the 
Certificate of Analysis), assay (dose calibrator), bacterial endotoxins (Ph Eur), sterility (Ph Eur).  
In cases when testing procedures are performed by radiation protection reasons retrospectively it is 
recommended to minimize the delay towards the technically necessary period. Without delays triggered 
by organizational reasons.   In the case of the sterility testing this is fulfilled but in the case of the 
determination of the chloride assay and the testing of the chemical impurities a delay of 3 months 
additionally to the decay period of 10 months is not justified. Therefore, the CHMP recommends reducing 
the maximum delay of 13 months to not much more than the technically necessary 10 months of the

also in the field of GMP and belongs by this in the competence of the local GMP authority 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of four pilot scale batches and three production scale batches under normal (25 °C/60 % 
RH) and accelerated (40 °C/75 % RH) conditions according to the ICH guidelines are presented. The 
storage period was four weeks, which is the intended shelf life of the finished product. 
The production scale batches and one of the pilot scale batches were stored in the commercial container 
closure system. The other three pilot scale batches were stored in a 20 mL glass vial with rubber stopper, 
as it was used for clinical samples. 
A thermal stress test was conducted over a period of four weeks at 60 °C, and a freeze/thaw study 
covering three cycles of -20 °C / room temperature (approx. 24 hours per cycle). 
The results demonstrate that the finished product remains stable under long-term, accelerated, and 
thermal stress conditions for the tested period of four weeks, and after three freeze/thaw cycles.

All stability indicating parameters (appearance, particulate matter, pH, osmolality, assay citrate, assay 
chloride, chemical impurities, assay, bacterial endotoxins, and sterility) were tested according to the test 
procedures and evaluated against the specification. 
The finished product is therefore evaluated to be stable in all climatic zones. The stability profiles of the 
pilot scale batches and production scale batches are comparable. Based on the results of the stability 
studies, a shelf life of 28 days in all climatic zones is justified. The finished product needs no specific 
storage conditions. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
To include a limit for ‘Total unspecified gamma peaks’ or a limit for radionuclidic purity of the starting 
material activity (e.g.>99.5% or other) in the starting material specification.- new stability studies 
with higher radioactive concentrations the trend in chemical stability (citrate and pH changes in 
relation to radioactive concentration) should be taken into consideration. 
To perform analytical tests towards the influence of calcium ions to the prevention of radium-223 
absorption on surfaces in the case if the radioactive concentration of the active substance solution is 
increased above the current approved specification limit. 
In view to user compliance further development studies in view to the solubility / compatibility of the 
finished product should be provided. 
In cases when testing procedures are performed retrospectively it is recommended to minimize the 
delay towards the technically necessary period without delays triggered by organizational reasons. In 
the case of the sterility testing this is fulfilled but in the case of the determination of the chloride assay 
and the testing of the chemical impurities a delay of 3 months additionally to the decay period of 10 
months is not justified. Therefore, it is recommended to reduce the maximum delay of 13 months to 
not much more than the technically necessary 10 months of the decay time. Furthermore the 
verification of the adequate performance of the analytical testing belongs also in the field of GMP and 
belongs by this in the competence of the local GMP authority.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The anti-tumour activity was assessed in two different experimental models of skeletal metastases in 
nude rats and nude mice. Additional experiments addressed the mechanism of action and potential 
interactions with bisphosphonates and doxorubicin. The effects of radium-223 chloride administration on 
vital organ systems were investigated in several safety pharmacology studies. 
All pivotal non-clinical studies were conducted in accordance with current testing guidelines and in 
compliance with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) with the exception of the 
radio-analytical part of the single dose mouse and rat toxicity studies.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Effects of radium-223 chloride on vital organ functions [central nervous system, cardiovascular system 
(including ECG) and respiratory system] were investigated in several in vivo studies (rats, dogs). Clinical, 
gross and histopathology investigations were also included in the dog cardiovascular study. No blood or 
tissue levels of radioactivity levels were measured in the rat and dog safety pharmacology studies. 
Doses administered were chosen to cover sufficient safety margins of up to 20-fold in the rat studies and 
up to 9-fold in the dog study; the clinical dose for radium-223 chloride is 50 kBq per kg body weight.  
Radium-223 dichloride [i.v. (50, 250 or 1,000 kBq/kg (0.0014, 0.0068 or 0.027 mCi/kg, respectively)] 
did not induce treatment related, toxicologically significant effects on mortality, body temperatures, body 
weights, body weight gains, functional observational battery (FOB) and locomotor activity in male 
Sprague-Dawley rats. Statistically significant but sporadic changes in FOB were not considered 
biologically significant or treatment related. 
Radium-223 dichloride [i.v. 50, 150 and 450 kBq/kg (0,0.0014, 0.0040 and 0.012 mCi/kg, respectively)] 
did not induce mortalities, treatment related statistically significant differences in mean body weights or 
total body weight gains, body temperature, locomotor activity, clinical chemistry changes, gross lesions 
or histologic findings in telemetered conscious Beagle dogs (n=4). Several haematology parameters 
(white blood cells, platelets, eosinophils, reticulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes) showed apparent 
dose-related increases or decreases that were considered related to radium-223 dichloride

administration. None of the administered doses of radium-223 affected electrocardiogram (ECG) 
measurements (PR, QRS, RR and QT duration) or heart rate in any significant manner.  
Radium-223 dichloride [i.v. 50, 150 and 1000 kBq/kg (0,0.0014, 0.0068 or 0.027 mCi/kg, respectively)] 
did not induce treatment related findings in in-life parameters, including clinical observations, body 
weights and total body weight gains, absolute values of respiratory rate, tidal volume and minute volume 
comparing to the mean of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th hours after dosing to the mean of baseline measured 
prior to administration in male Sprague-Dawley rats. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The potential additive efficacy of administration of radium-223 chloride with the subsequent (next day) 
administration of the bisphosphonate pamidronic acid (bone resorption inhibitor) has been investigated in 
a breast cancer bone metastasis model in nude rats (Henriksen et al. 2002). Efficacy (as percent 
symptom-free survival) of radium-223 chloride in this model was not modified by subsequent 
administration of pamidronic acid. 
In a second model, radium-223 chloride treatment (300 kBq/kg) was combined with the administration of 
the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (bone resorption inhibitor) or the administration of the cytotoxic 
agent doxorubicin in a breast cancer bone metastasis model in nude mice (R-8698) (n=10 per group). 
Primary endpoint of this study was the median time to sacrifice (TTS). While neither doxorubicin nor 
zoledronic acid prolonged the median TTS (24 days vs. 23 days vs. 25 days for the vehicle control) both 
combination treatment groups showed a significant increase of this parameter (30 days for the radium 
223 chloride/doxorubicin combination vs. 33 days for the radium-223 chloride/zoledronic acid 
combination vs. 28 days for the radium-223 chloride single agent group). Additionally, the most 
pronounced reduction of the mean osteolytic lesion area at sacrifice was seen in mice which received the 
combination of radium-223 chloride and zoledronic acid. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of radium-223 has been investigated in vivo in Wistar rats, Balb/c mice and Beagle 
dogs, using the same formulation as the clinically intended. 
Blood pharmacokinetics of radium-223 has been determined in mice (only half-life) (R-8646, R-8649) and 
dogs (R-8668, R-8668A; R-8670; R-8670A) after single dose intravenous administration. 
One hour after intravenous administration, less than 1% and 12% of the radioactive dose was present in 
plasma of mice and dogs, respectively. The values of radioactivity in blood decreased below 0.1% in mice 
and 2% in dogs 24h after administration. The blood elimination appeared to be biphasic in mice and 
triphasic in dogs. In the single dose study in dogs, where three different doses (50, 150 and 450 kBq/kg) 
were investigated, distribution and elimination from blood appeared to be independent of dose. 
In mice administered 625 kBq/kg, calculation of the biological half-life of radium-223 in blood established 
the initial half-life (t1/2α) to be about 0.1 hours (about 5-10 minutes), and a last measured half-life (t 1/2ß) 
to be about 13 hours.  
In dogs administered single doses of 50, 150 or 450 kBq/kg radium-223, the pharmacokinetic data 
indicate a triphasic elimination from blood with an initial half-life (t 1/2α) calculated to be 0.2 hours (about 
10 minutes), an intermediate half-life (t1/2ß) of about 2 hours, and last measured half-life (t 1/2γ) of about 
50 hours.

No separate studies on pharmacokinetics after repeat administration of radium-223 were performed. 
Pharmacokinetic data after repeat administration were performed in the 6-month repeat dose toxicity 
study in dogs (R-8670; R-8670A). Data were obtained after the 3rd and the 6th injection. 
No plasma protein binding and plasma/blood cell partitioning investigation were submitted. Single dose 
biodistribution has been investigated in mice, rats and dogs, and after repeat dose intravenous 
administration in dogs. 
In mice the biodistribution of radium-223 was followed up to 14 and 56 days after a single injection of 625 
kBq/kg in two different studies. In the first study, over a period of 14 days, the greatest accumulation of 
activity occurred in bone. Levels of radium-223 decreased rapidly from the kidneys and large intestine. In 
addition, radium-223 was taken up in the spleen but appeared to clear from this organ over time. 
Radium-223 was essentially absent in soft tissue, with the exception of the spleen where a small amount 
could be detected. In the second study radium-223 remained within the bone at least up to approximately 
5 half-lives and probably for the entire decay period.  
As part of a single dose toxicology study in rats (R-8661), a non-GLP biodistribution assessment was 
performed. Thirty days after radium-223 chloride administration at a dose of 1,250 kBq/kg, the highest 
level of radioactivity was found in the bone and cartilage tissues. Low levels of radioactivity were 
measured in soft tissues such as urethra, salivary gland, thyroid, sciatic nerve and pituitary. 
In dogs, after single or repeat dose of radium-223 biodistribution was assessed after 30 days following 
administration. Radium-223 was preferentially retained in bone samples compared to soft tissue organs. 
The liver and spleen were the only two soft tissue organs that showed measurable amount of retained 
radioactivity in the single dose study and then only in the highest dose group. 
In Henriksen et al. (2003), uptake of radium-223 in organs and tissues of mice in comparison to the 
beta-emitter strontium-89 was evaluated. Both radionuclides reached an activity level equivalent to 
maximum only 1 h after injection and the radioactivity levels in bone did not change significantly up to 14 
days. The highest absorbed dose of radium-223 occurred in bone with little absorbed dose occurring in 
soft tissue. Brain and heart samples contained insignificant amounts of radioactivity at all time-points (up 
to 14 days after dosing). 
No studies investigating potential metabolism of radium-223 were submitted (see discussion on 
non-clinical aspects). 
Urinary and faecal excretion was studied in two mice studies receiving a single injection of 625 kBq/kg 
radium-223 chloride (R-8647, R-8650). Radium-223 was seen in both urine and faeces as early as 1 hour 
after dosing. Maximum urinary and faecal excretion occurred at 6 hours or 12 hours after dosing. Five 
days after administration on average 16% (14-18%) of the administered dose was recovered. Little or no 
radium-223 was detected in urine and faeces 4 days after radium-223 chloride- administration. The 
cumulative urine to faeces ratios in these studies were found to be 1:1 or 1:3, respectively. 
In another long term study in mice, small but detectable amounts of radium-223 were excreted in the 
urine and faeces over the entire time course of the study (56 days). The elimination of radium-223 in 
faeces and urine was even detectable after 56 days after injection, however on a continuously decreasing 
course. The ratio of urine and faeces excretion is considered unchanged during the course of excretion 
with a factor of about 1:5. 
In the dog studies, total urine and faeces output was not measured, and a full mass balance was not 
available. However, data of Lloyd et al. (1982), showed retention of about 50% of injected radioactivity 
after intravenous radium-224 administration.

No relevant difference in blood pharmacokinetics or tissue biodistribution was observed between 
radium-223 given alone or 2 hours after zoledronic acid.

No toxicokinetic studies were conducted, either separately or as part of the toxicity studies. 
Biodistribution determinations including blood pharmacokinetics were performed as part of the single

Local Tolerance  
Radium-223 chloride was well tolerated locally after bolus intravenous administration in the GLP single 
and repeat dose toxicity studies described above based on the conduct of clinical observations and the 
histopathological evaluation of the injection site. 
Transient erythema, but no oedema, haemorrhage or histological change of the injection site was 
observed after a single perivenous injection of 750 kBq/animal in a GLP study in rabbits (R-8667). 
Other toxicity studies 
Toxicity of radium-223 chloride in combination with docetaxel was evaluated in three toxicity studies 
conducted in rats. In these combination studies of radium-223 chloride (50 kBq/kg) with docetaxel 
(4mg/kg) after single and repeated dose, changes in haematology parameters were observed after 
treatment with both, radium-223 chloride and docetaxel and with the combination. After repeated dosing, 
a more pronounced effect on haematological parameters was observed with the combination. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An Environmental Risk Assessment was not submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Radium-223 chloride showed a cell killing effect in vitro by inducing DNA double strand breaks in NHIK 
3025 cervical cancer cells and A549 NSCLC cells and 2 multidrug resistant cell lines derived from NHIK 
3025 and A549 cells as well as in non-cycling NHIK 3025 cells. Beside this direct cytotoxic effect, an 
inhibition of osteoclast differentiation and osteoblast activity which was seen in vitro may also account to 
the in vivo efficacy. However, the inhibition of osteoblast activity was only seen at high concentrations of 
radium-223 chloride (800 and 1600 Bq/ml). At low concentrations of radium-223 chloride (100 and 200 
Bq/ml), osteoblast activity was moderately induced. Since bone metastases in prostate cancer patients 
are frequently osteoblastic showing a profound local stimulation of osteoblasts adjacent to the metastatic 
tumour cells, the inverse effect on osteoblast activity may have an impact on the clinical efficacy 
dependent on the dose administered. Even though the model used is still considered not appropriate, 
taking into account the lack of suitable commercially available osteoblastic prostate cancer bone growth 
or metastasis models and of the available non clinical and clinical data, it is endorsed that based on the 
reduction of several serum bone formation markers seen in clinical studies and based on the in vivo 
preclinical data, a moderate inhibition of osteoblast activity would occur in patients at the clinical dose of 
50 kBq/kg of radium-223 dichloride.  
A significant radium-223 chloride anti-tumour effect has been demonstrated in an osteolytic experimental 
skeletal metastases model in nude rats intraventricularly inoculated with human breast cancer cells. Rats 
treated with approximately 110 kBq/kg showed a significantly increased symptom free survival compared 
to control animals. Additionally, radium-223 chloride was tested in vivo in a second osteolytic breast 
cancer bone metastasis model in nude mice. Radium-223 chloride significantly reduced the incidence of

cachexia, inhibited osteolytic destruction of the bone, reduced the total tumour burden and ultimately led 
to an increase of the median survival time in this setting. With regards to the underlying mode of action, 
necrotic areas within the bone metastases were found in radium-223 chloride treated animals. The 
nonclinical pharmacology studies indicated that radium-223 chloride delivers potent radiation targeted to 
bone at sites of increased bone turnover, such as skeletal metastases. In general, it would be more 
appropriate to perform in vivo pharmacodynamics studies of radium-223 chloride in an osteoblastic 
prostate cancer bone metastasis model. However, due to the data available from clinical studies with 
radium-223 chloride in patients with CRPC with bone metastasis, the efficacy on bone metastases of 
prostate cancer has been evaluated and no further in vivo non-clinical studies are required. 
No secondary pharmacology studies were submitted. Due to the small mass of radium, 0.53 ng/ml 
corresponding to 1,000 kBq radium-223 per ml in the drug product at the date of calibration, no 
physiological effects are expected due to radium and its decay products itself. 
No effects on CNS function, respiratory function and cardiovascular function have been observed in safety 
pharmacology studies conducted in rats (CNS and respiratory) and dogs (cardiovascular) that could be 
attributed to radium-223 chloride treatment. The doses used in the safety pharmacology studies were up 
to 1,000 kBq/kg in rats and up to 450 kBq/kg in dogs, which are multiples of the intended clinical dose. 
No negative effects on different efficacy parameters were observed for the combination of radium-223 
chloride with bisphosphonates in skeletal metastasis models in rats and mice. 
The pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies with doxorubicin are of limited value for the proposed 
indication of radium 223 chloride, since doxorubicin is not indicated for treatment of castration-resistant 
prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. 
Pharmacokinetic studies in mice and dogs showed that radium-223 was rapidly eliminated from the blood 
circulation. Elimination from blood appeared to be biphasic in mice and triphasic in dogs. In mice, initial 
half-life was about 0.1 h while terminal half-life was about 13 hours. In dogs, following single dose 
injection of radium-223 chloride the initial and intermediate half-lives were short, approximately 0.2 
hours and just above 2 hours; and comparable following single and repeated injection of radium-223 
chloride. The last measured half-life was about 50 hours following single dose injection. In dogs, where 
three different doses were investigated, distribution and elimination from blood appeared to be 
independent of dose. 
No plasma protein binding studies have been performed for radium-223 chloride. For other earth alkaline 
ions plasma protein binding has been reported, e.g. ~40% for Ca2+ and ~50% for Ba2+. Therefore, it is 
likely that radium-223 also binds to plasma proteins. In this case, a fraction of administered 
radium-223-dose will probably be retained within the blood circulation. However, saturation of the bone 
binding sites that could theoretically lead to increased blood concentrations of radium-223 has been 
reasonably excluded, so that studies on plasma protein binding are not considered necessary for 
radium-223 chloride. 
The biodistribution studies in mice, rats and dogs showed that radium-223 is primarily distributed to bone 
tissue with much higher affinity relative to soft tissues. However, the studies in rats and dogs had some 
limitations, since radioactivity levels in organs and tissues were only measured 30 days after 
administration of radium-223 chloride. Literature data showed that little redistribution of radium-223 
daughter nuclides away from bone was found in mice after i.v. administration of radium-223 chloride (2% 
at 6 hours and less than 1% at 3 days). In mice where the biodistribution after a single dose of 
radium-223 was followed up to 56 days (approximately 5 half-lives of radium-223), radium-223 
remained within the bone at least up to approximately 5 half-lives and probably for the entire decay 
period. Little radioactivity was detected in soft tissue with the exception of the spleen in mice, where a 
significant amount of radioactivity was found with a maximum level at 1 hour after administration and 
Assessment report

then declines to levels below 1% of the administered does after 14 days. This accumulation in spleen is 
unclear but this could be a species-specific finding. Uptake in spleen was not seen in rats and only a very 
limited uptake in spleen was seen in dogs. However, in rats and dogs, investigations of biodistribution 
have only been performed 30 days after administration of radium-223 chloride. Therefore, it is likely that 
an initial accumulation occurs in the spleen shortly after administration of radium-223 chloride, which 
declines to low levels 30 days after dosing. 
Dosimetry calculations for radium-223 in comparison to the beta-emitter strontium-89 distributed on the 
bone surface of marrow cavities indicated that the radium-223 alpha-emitter might have a 
marrow-sparing advantage compared with beta-emitters because the short-range alpha-particles 
irradiate a significantly lower fraction of the marrow volume than beta-particles emitted from e.g. 
strontium-89 (Henriksen et al, 2003). 
Initially, a high level of radioactivity was found in the kidney in mice, most likely because of excretion in 
the urine but the level was rapidly reduced. High concentrations of radioactivity from radium-223 were 
found in the large intestine of mice, a finding that is confirmed by literature references citing excretion of 
radium isotopes (dog, rat, rabbits and cow) directly into the intestinal tract and contained in the faecal. 
This result was confirmed in the excretion studies in mice and dogs where it was observed that 
radium-223 was excreted in both faeces and urine. 
No biodistribution studies directly comparing biodistribution after single and repeated dosing in the same 
study have been submitted by the applicant. It is agreed that an accumulation of radium-223 within the 
bone and a relevant saturation of the binding sites within the bone are not expected. 
No known metabolic pathways exist for radium-223. Therefore, studies of the metabolism of radium-223 
are neither considered appropriate nor relevant to the safety evaluation of radium-223 chloride. The 
decay of radium-223 to stable lead-207 (via radon-219, polonium-215, lead-211, bismuth-211 and 
thallium-207) is known. 
In both mice and dogs, excretion of radium-223 occurred by both gastrointestinal and renal route. 
Maximum urinary and faecal excretion in mice was seen until 6 hours and 12 hours, respectively. In dogs, 
maximum urinary and faecal excretion was seen at 2 and 12 hours, the first sampling times for these 
parameters, respectively. In two mice studies, five days after administration on average 16% (14-18%) 
of the administered dose was recovered. Little or no radium-223 chloride was detected in urine and faeces 
4 days after radium-223 - administration. Small detectable amounts of radium-223 were excreted in the 
urine and faeces in mice throughout a period of 56 days after a single dose radium-223 chloride 
administration. The low recovery rate of 16% can be explained by the retention of radium-223 into the 
bone tissue. 
A mass balance calculation in mice reveals that on average about 70% of the administered single dose 
was bound to bone tissue. This binding occurs rapidly after the first investigated time point after 
administration (0.5 hours) and remains on a constant level until the end of entire study (14 days). It can 
be concluded that once bound to bone, radium-223 remains within the bone for the entire decay period. 
In all other investigated tissues, the residues of radioactivity were observed below 1% of the 
administered dose already 12 hours after administration, with the exception of the spleen. The 
cumulative urine to faeces ratios in these studies in mice were found to be 1:1 or 1:3, respectively. In the 
dog studies, total urine and faeces output was not measured. Therefore, a full mass balance was not 
calculated. Levels of radioactivity concentration in urine and faeces reveal a time dependent decrease. In 
addition, the radium-223 excretion was observed in a dose dependent manner. A published distribution 
study in dogs after intravenous administration of the radium isotope radium-224 reported a total 
retention of about 50% of the injected radioactivity. Another published study after subcutaneous injection 
of the radium isotope radium-226 to dogs showed that the faecal to urinary excretion ratio was about

10:1. Excretion into bile of radium-223 has been investigated in dogs showing that biliar excretion 
accounted for a small percentage of total excretion. This suggests first pass liver metabolism and 
probably enterohepatic circulation of radium-223. The secretion/excretion of radium from blood into the 
small intestine through the small intestine wall is most likely through the transport mechanisms involved 
for other divalent cations (e.g. Ca, Mg, Sr and Ba). 
The pharmacokinetics or biodistribution of radium-223 was not affected by administration of a 
bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid) in mice. The transport pathways most likely used by radium are not the 
same as used by small molecules so no drug-drug interaction is anticipated at the small intestinal wall. As 
a calcium-analogue, radium-223 is incorporated into bone and other newly calcified tissues instead of 
calcium. Furthermore, the transport mechanisms from blood into the small intestine are most likely the 
same as used for other divalent cations (e.g. Ca, Mg, Sr and Ba). 
In single and repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, the main findings were reduced body weight gain, 
haematological changes, reduced serum alkaline phosphatase and microscopic findings in the bone 
marrow (depletion of haematopoietic cells, fibrosis), spleen (secondary extra-medullary haematopoiesis) 
and bone (depletion of osteocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibro-osseous lesions, 
disruption/disorganisation of the physis/growth line). These findings were related to radiation-induced 
impairment of haematopoiesis and a reduction of osteogenesis and started at the lowest dose of 20 kBq 
per kg body weight (0.4 times the clinically recommended dose). 
In dogs, haematological changes were observed beginning at the lowest dose of 50 kBq/kg. Dose limiting 
myelotoxicity was observed after a single dose of 450 kBq/kg, while single doses of 50 kBq/kg and 150 
kBq/kg were considered safe and repeated administration of the clinically recommended dose of 
radium-223 chloride (50 kBq/kg) at intervals of 4 weeks for 6 months was well tolerated without 
dose-limiting toxicities. Some of the haematological changes were partially reversible after the end of 
treatment. In the single dose dog study, a rebound in haematology parameters to the low reference range 
was observed by the end of the study period in dogs given 50 kBq/kg but not 150 kBq/kg or 450 kBq/kg 
radium-223 chloride. In the repeat dose study with dogs given 50 kBq/kg, gradual recovery of the 
decreases in total white blood cell, granulocyte and platelet counts began after the third of 6 injections 
and continued over the remainder of the study period. However, the repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs 
has some limitations, since only one radium-223 treated dose group, using the clinically recommended 
dose of 50 kBq/kg, was used. Therefore, dose-responses of the toxicological findings and safety margins 
to humans could not be established. 
After repeated administration of the clinically recommended dose of 50 kBq per kg body weight once 
every 4 weeks for 6 months, two dogs developed non-displaced pelvic fractures. Due to the presence of 
osteolysis of trabecular bone in other bone locations of treated animals in varying degree, a spontaneous 
fracture in the context of osteolysis cannot be excluded. The clinical relevance of these findings is 
unknown. 
Retinal detachment with hypertrophy of the retinal unpigmented and/or pigmented epithelium was seen 
in dogs after a single injection of radium-223 chloride at dose levels of 150 and 450 kBq/kg (3 to 9 times 
the clinically recommended dose), but not after repeated administration of the clinically recommended 
dose of 50 kBq/kg. The exact mechanism for the induction of retinal detachment in dogs is unknown but 
might be a consequence of the enhanced delivery of alpha radiation to the ocular tissues secondary to the 
avidity of the canine pigmented epithelium for radium and radium daughters as described in the 
literature. A potential mechanism for this avidity may be the high number of calcium binding sites in 
pigment epithelium, especially the tapetum lucidum, probably reflecting a critical role for calcium in 
photoreceptor signaling and light adaptation. Since humans do not have a tapetum lucidum, the 
retinopathy observed in dogs may reflect a species-specific accumulation of radium in the pigmented

structures of the canine eye. Until now, no retinopathy was observed in patients treated with radium-223 
chloride. 
No histological changes were observed in organs involved in the excretion of the radium-223. 
Osteosarcomas, a known effect of bone-seeking radionuclides, occurred in rats at extended times (7 to 12 
months) in the single or repeat dose (4 q4w) study and the 12-month repeat-dose (12 q4w) study. More 
than 6 months after single and repeated administration of radium-223 chloride, rats were found dead or 
sacrificed for humane reasons mainly due to osteosarcomas. The indication for Xofigo is treatment of 
castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases, an advanced cancer disease. 
Therefore for this patient population, the long-term risk for development of osteosarcomas is acceptable. 
Studies on the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of Xofigo have not been performed. In general, 
radionuclides are considered to be genotoxic and carcinogenic. 
Studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity have not been submitted. In general, radionuclides 
induce reproductive and developmental effects. 
A minimal number of abnormal spermatocytes were seen in a few seminiferous tubules in the testes of 
male rats after a single administration of ≥2054 kBq/kg body weight radium-223 dichloride (≥41 times 
the clinically recommended dose). The testes seemed to otherwise be functioning normally and the 
epididymides revealed a normal content of spermatocytes. Uterine polyps (endometrial stroma) were 
observed in female rats after single or repeated administration of ≥325 kBq/kg body weight radium-223 
dichloride (≥6.5 times the clinically recommended dose). 
According to the Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) an environmental risk assessment for radium-223 chloride is not required, 
because inorganic salts representing electrolytes are considered not to pose a risk to the environment. 
Moreover, as radium-223 chloride is a radiopharmaceutical, the Product Information contains adequate 
relevant warnings and precautions regarding handling and disposal. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical aspects have been investigated and addressed adequately and there are no remaining 
non-clinical concerns preventing the marketing authorisation of radium-223 chloride. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The application underwent accelerated assessment as it was considered of major interest from the point 
of view of public health and in particular from the view point of therapeutic innovation. The CHMP 
accepted the Applicant’s request for accelerated assessment on the grounds of the high unmet medical 
need, the novel mechanism of action of the medicinal product which has the potential to offer an 
alternative therapeutic option and, finally, the adequacy/ completeness of the proposed data package 
which could allow the application to be assessed under an accelerated timetable.  
In a Scientific Advice procedure the CHMP concluded that regarding the primary endpoint proposal of 
having SRE and OS as co-primary endpoints, two options were acceptable to the CHMP: 
1.  time to first SRE as a primary endpoint; 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 27/86 
 
 
 
 
2.  OS as a unique primary endpoint, and PFS (including extra osseous events) and time to first SRE as 
secondary endpoints. 
As the primary endpoint was changed to implement option 2 proposed by the CHMP the statistical design 
of the study was agreed with CHMP in a follow-up advice procedure. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

In the phase I studies, no drug concentration measurements were made. However, blood samples for 
analyses of radioactivity were collected. The radium-223 chloride activity in blood, plasma, urine and 
faeces was measured using a gamma counter. The number of counts was corrected for background and 
dead-time and converted into activity via a measured calibration factor. The activity was corrected for 
decay until the time of injection. The absorbed radiation dose calculation was performed based on clinical 
biodistribution data.  
Absorption  
No studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Distribution 
After intravenous injection, the fraction of the injected activity retained in the blood at 15 minutes 
following injection was 20 ±8% (range 9-33%). At 4 hours, only 4 ±1% (range 2-6%) of the activity 
remained in the blood, which had decreased to 0.4 ±0.2% (range 0.2-0.7%) at 72 hours. 
The volume of distribution was higher than the blood volume indicating distribution to peripheral 
compartments. The initial half-life was not estimated due to the limited number of sampling points within 
the initial distribution phase. The second, third and fourth half-life was estimated to approximately 10 
minutes, 2 hours and 30 hours, respectively.

Approximately 49% of the activity passed into the gut at 4 hours (range 19% - 69%). This increased to 
about 59% (range 22% - 93%) at 24 hours and decreased to about 52% (8% – 79%) at 48 hours and 
about 33% (3% – 70%) at 72 hours. Within 4 hours 40% (range 19% - 69%) of the injected activity 
passed into the small intestine. Activity then passed into the upper large intestine with a mean uptake of 
45% (range 17% – 57%) at 24 hours, decreasing to 4% (range 0% – 18%) at 1 week. Maximum uptake 
in the lower large intestine occurred at 24 – 72 hours with an uptake of 17% (range 0% – 33%) at 48 
hours.  
Activity in bone was calculated as the mean of the activity per unit mass in the skull and both legs. Activity 
was rapidly taken up in bone. With one exception the maximum activity appeared at the time of the first 
scan at 4 hours. The initial level of uptake was 61% (range 44% - 77%). No specific uptake was visible in 
the gamma scintigraphy images of other tissues/organs such as kidneys, urinary bladder, liver, 
gallbladder, stomach, heart and spleen. 
For an administered activity of 3.65 MBq (50 kBq/kg BW to a 70-kg adult) the calculated absorbed doses 
to the bone (osteogenic cells) was 4.2050 Gy and to the red marrow 0.5066 Gy. The calculated absorbed 
doses to the main excretory organs were 0.0265 Gy (2.65 rad) for the small intestine wall, 0.1180 Gy for 
the upper large intestine wall and 0.1696 Gy for the lower large intestine wall. The calculated absorbed 
doses to other organs were low, e.g. heart wall (0.0063 Gy), lung (0.0003 Gy), liver (0.0109 Gy), kidneys 
(0.0117 Gy), urinary bladder wall (0.0147 Gy), testes (0.0003 Gy), and spleen (0.0003 Gy) (Study 
BC1-05). The calculated absorbed organ doses (Gy/MBq) per activity radium-223 chloride are 
summarised in Table 6 below.

Elimination 
Faecal excretion was the major route of elimination from the body. In the intestine, activity was already 
observed 10 minutes post injection, (Study BC1-08).  In Study BC1-05, faecal excretion was determined 
by direct measurement of radioactivity in the faecal samples collected over 48 hours.  There was 
variability in gut transit rates across the population with once daily up to once weekly bowel evacuation. 
The rate of elimination of radium-223 chloride from the gastrointestinal tract is however influenced by the 
high variability in intestinal transit rates across the population, with the normal range from once daily to 
once weekly bowel evacuation.  
Imaging data from Study BC1-05 and Study BC1-08 allowed for an estimate of the amount of 
radioactivity in the different regions of the gastrointestinal tract.  After radium-223 is excreted in the 
gastrointestinal tract (GIT), at least about 50 to 60% of injected radium-223 is excreted via the faecal 
route. In particular, data from Study BC1-08 suggests that the radium was secreted into the small 
intestine from the blood through the small intestine wall. 
Mean faecal excretion at 24 hours was 2% (range <1% - 13%) of the injected activity. At the time of 
discharge at 48 hours, the mean cumulative faecal excretion (at ~48 hours) was 13% (range <1% - 
34%). The faecal excretion was continuing to increase at the last time point of collection.  
Mean urine excretion at 24 hours was 2% (range <1% - 4%). At the time of discharge at 48 hours, the 
cumulative mean urine excretion was 2% (range <1% - 5%) and the rate of excretion was decreasing. 
There was a tendency for the rate of excretion to decrease during the patient’s stay (48 hours).  
The whole body measurements at 7 days after injection indicated that a median of 76% of administered 
activity was excreted from the body.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In Study AT1-BC1 (see dose response study), the pharmacokinetics of total radioactivity following 
administration of radium-223 chloride was evaluated in the dose range of 46 to 250 kBq/kg BW.  The AUC 
and Cmax values increased with increasing dose and the pharmacokinetic analyses showed very similar 
pharmacokinetic characteristics for all five dose-groups, indicating a close to linear dose relationship. The 
pharmacokinetics was linear between the dose range of 46 to 250 kBq/kg.  The mean t 1/2 was 10.51 hour, 
CL was 0.25 IU/(h*IU/g) and Vss was 2.66 IU/(IU/g).

No relevant studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No clinical studies addressing the mechanism of action were submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
PSA, an indicator of the disease status in metastatic prostate cancer was measured in all four studies 
contributing efficacy information (Studies BC1 02, BC1 03, BC1 04, and BC1 06) described under the 
clinical efficacy section. Phase 2 studies were performed to show the pharmacodynamic effects of 
radium-223 chloride on skeletal-related events (placebo-controlled study BC1-02), on bone pain (study 
BC1-03) and on the change in bone-ALP levels (study BC1-02) as well as PSA response (study BC1-04).  
Regarding secondary pharmacology, a sub-study was performed to evaluate the potential for QTc interval 
prolongation of radium-223 chloride in a sub-group of the patient population of the pivotal phase III 
BC1-06 study (the methodology of the study is described under clinical efficacy). In the radium-223 
chloride group, the highest mean increase in QTcF was 5.2±6.5 msecs and the mean change from 
baseline in QTcF at one hour post-injection was 7.6 msecs. These findings were similar to those obtained 
in the placebo group. The mean maximal change from baseline in the radium 223 chloride group was 
11.4±6.7 msecs  while the upper limit of the 90% Confidence Interval (CI) of the mean maximal change 
from baseline in QTcF was 13.9 msecs. Similar results were obtained in the placebo group where the 
mean maximal change from baseline was 11.5±7.8 msecs while the upper limit of the 90% Confidence 
Interval (CI) of the mean maximal change from baseline in QTcF was 16.7 msecs. No significant 
differences were noted between radium-223 chloride and placebo. Similarly, no clinically-relevant 
changes in heart rate (HR) were found in the radium-223 chloride groups. A significant mean increase in 
PR interval in the radium-223 chloride group of 14.8±48.1 msecs at the three hour post-dose time point 
was related to a significant increase in one patient with a previous history of ischaemic heart disease, 
arrhythmia and bradycardia. This patient exhibited more than 200 msecs increase at the two, three and 
four to six hours post-dose time points.  There were no clinically-relevant changes found in the QRS 
interval. The QTcB duration showed the same trends as the QTcF duration. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No studies of bioavailability, comparative bioavailability, bioequivalence or effect of food were conducted. 
This is acceptable since radium-223 chloride is a radiopharmaceutical administered by intravenous 
injection and consequently is completely bioavailable.  
After intravenous injection, the maximal therapeutic radium plasma concentration in patients is 
< 1 pmol/L which is much lower (i.e. >10000) than the anticipated concentrations that might have 
adverse effects (≥ 0.1 µmol/L). 
Radium-223 is rapidly cleared from the blood with distribution primarily to the bone with 44% to 77% of 
the administered activity at 4 hours post injection and into the small intestine. No significant uptake was 
seen in other organs such as heart, liver, kidneys, urinary bladder and spleen at 4 hours post injection. 
The main route of excretion from the body was via the faeces which amounted at 24 hours pi 2% (range 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 32/86 
 
 
 
 
< 1% to 13%) and at ~48 hours 13% (range < 1% to 34%). Radium-223 is secreted into the small 
intestine from the blood through the small intestine wall.  The transport pathways most likely used by 
radium are not the same as used by small molecules so no drug-drug interaction is anticipated at the 
small intestinal wall.  
Radium-223 is an isotope which decays and is not metabolised. Faecal excretion is the major route of 
elimination from the body. The excretion in the urine was low (approximately 5%). At 7 days after 
injection, 76% of the administered activity was excreted from the body.  
The absence of pharmacokinetic interaction studies and of studies using human biomaterials is 
considered acceptable due to the lack of in vivo metabolism and the small likelihood that transport 
pathways most likely used by radium are shared by small molecules. Moreover, no interactions were 
observed with several medications used by patients with prostate cancer in clinical studies and, despite 
the theoretical potential for calcium supplements to compete with radium-223 chloride bone uptake as 
well as elimination, no difference in the mean or median serum calcium concentration between patients 
taking and not taking calcium supplements was seen (wide distribution over the complete normal range 
vs. even wider range of serum calcium concentrations in subjects not taking calcium supplements). 
However, as interactions with calcium and phosphate cannot be excluded, pausing supplementation with 
these substances and/or Vitamin D should be considered some days before starting with Xofigo 
treatment. 
Moreover, concomitant chemotherapy with Xofigo may have additive effects on bone marrow suppression 
(see also discussion on clinical safety). Safety and efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy with Xofigo have 
not been established. 
The pharmacokinetics of radium-223 chloride were linear in the dose range investigated (46 to 250 
kBq/kg). 
No pharmacokinetic studies in special populations were submitted. The applicant discussed the effects of 
intrinsic factors (age, race, weight, renal and hepatic function etc.) on the efficacy and safety of 
radium-223 chloride and no differences were noted related to these factors, so that the impact of the lack 
of pharmacokinetic information in special populations could be considered acceptable. 
Finally, there was no evidence to suggest that the intravenous injection of radium 223 chloride may 
significantly prolong the QTc interval thereby having pro-arrhythmic potential. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the Applicant has sufficiently described the pharmacokinetics of radium-223 chloride. The 
pharmacodynamic effects of radium-223 are discussed under the clinical efficacy section. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
Seven studies were submitted in support of the use of radium chloride in the claimed indication (see 
Figure 2). 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The dose-response relationship of Xofigo was evaluated in a dose finding Phase 2 Study (BC1-04). In 
addition, Phase 1 study ATI-BC1/15522 also contributed information towards a dose-dependent response 
based mainly on bone biomarkers.

Study BC1-04 was a double-blind, randomised, repeat dose, multicentre study of Xofigo for the treatment 
of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and skeletal metastases. The primary objective was 
to compare the proportion of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer and skeletal metastases 
showing a prostate specific antigen (PSA) response (PSA decrease ≥ 50% from baseline, confirmed three 
weeks later) on three different repeat dose regimens of Xofigo (25, 50, or 80 kBq/kg b.w. of radium-223 
chloride at 6 week intervals for a total of 3 injections). The study enrolled 122 patients. The primary 
efficacy variable was the proportion of patients with a confirmed PSA response. In the Per-Protocol Set, 
this occurred in 0 (0 %), 2 (5.6 %) and 5 (12.8 %) of subjects in the 25 kBq/kg, 50 kBq/kg and 80 kBq/kg 
dose groups, respectively (p=0.0297, Jonckheere-Terpstra test for dose response; pairwise comparison 
between 25 kBq/kg and 80 kBq/kg dose groups was borderline significant, p=0.0548). Results in the 
Intention-to Treat Set were similar (p=0.0290). There was no gradient of risk across the doses up to 80 
kBq/kg BW in the study. 
Study ATI-BC1 was a phase I open-label, multicentre, dose-escalating study of radium-223 in patients 
with advanced skeletal metastases. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of escalating doses and identify possible dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of radium-223 
administered to patients with advanced skeletal metastases. The study was conducted in 31 patients in 
total (25 in part 1a and 6 in part 1b) with skeletal metastases from breast or prostate cancer. The 
dose-escalation part of the study (designated as "study part 1a") was with single injections of radium-223 
chloride to be administered to cohorts of 5 patients for each of the 5 pre-defined dose levels (46, 93, 163, 
213 and 250 kBq/kg BW). During study part 1b, patients receiving multiple doses of radium-223 chloride 
were either allocated to receive 5 injections of 50 kBq/kg BW at 3 weeks intervals or 2 injections of 125 
kBq/kg BW at 6 weeks intervals.  Radium-223 was well tolerated by patients with skeletal metastases. 
Mild to moderate and transient haematological toxicity was observed at potentially therapeutic doses. 
Platelets were less affected than neutrophils and white blood cells; toxicity grade I was seen in 5 of the 31 
patients. Pain relief was seen in more than 50% of the patients.

Treatments 
Patients were randomised (2:1) to receive either radium-223 chloride, 50 kBq/kg b.w. or isotonic 
(normal) saline solution, administered as slow bolus IV injection 6 times at intervals of 4 weeks between 
each administration.   
All patients were to receive “best standard of care” (BSoC). Best standard of care was regarded as the 
routine standard of care at each centre, for example local external beam radiotherapy, corticosteroids, 
antiandrogens, oestrogens (e.g. stilboestrol), estramustine (not regarded as cytotoxic as per exclusion 
criterion 3 or ketoconazole. Patients were not included in the study if the standard of care included 
chemotherapy, hemibody radiation or use of radionuclides. 
Study drug dose level adjustment was not permitted. Treatment was discontinued when patients 
experienced unacceptable toxicity or initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes, 
hemibody external radiotherapy or other investigational drugs.  In case of a treatment delay of more than 
4 weeks, treatment was to be discontinued.   
Subsequently, during the follow-up period, the patients were evaluated every 2 months until 1 year from 
first administration, and thereafter, every 4 months until 3 years from first administration.  If a patient 
was withdrawn from the study during the treatment period, the patient was encouraged to attend a safety 
follow-up visit 4 weeks after last treatment visit.   
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare, in subjects with symptomatic hormone refractory 
prostate cancer (HRPC) and skeletal metastases, the efficacy of BSC plus Xofigo versus BSC plus placebo.  
Secondary objectives included the comparison of the acute and long-term safety profile and quality of life 
(QoL) between the treatment groups. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was Overall Survival defined as the time from date of randomisation to the date of 
death, whatever the cause. Survival times for patients who were still alive at the time of the analysis or 
who were lost to follow-up were censored at the last available date on which the patient was known to be 
alive. 
The key secondary endpoints included the following five ordered hierarchically (see statistical methods): 
Time to total-ALP progression defined a) in patients with no total-ALP decline from baseline as ≥ 25% 
increase from the baseline value, at least 12 weeks from baseline; b) in patients with an initial total-ALP 
decline from baseline as ≥ 25% increase above the nadir value, which is confirmed by a second value 
obtained three or more weeks later. 
(Confirmed) Total ALP response defined as ≥30% reduction of the blood level, compared to the baseline 
value, confirmed by a second total ALP value approximately 4 or more weeks later. 
Time to occurrence of first SRE: Disease events were defined as: Use of External Beam Radiation Therapy 
(EBRT) to relieve skeletal symptoms (1); Use of radio-isotopes to relieve skeletal symptom (2); New 
symptomatic pathological bone fractures (vertebral and non-vertebral) (3); Tumour-related orthopaedic 
surgical intervention (4); Spinal cord compression (5); Start of any other anti-cancer treatment such as 
chemotherapy and hormonal treatment (6); Deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
Performance Status (ECOG PS) by at least 2 points from baseline (includes death) (7). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 36/86 
 
 
 
 
For the first 6 events above, the start date of the event/medication/therapy was used as the time of the 
event. For the last event, the visit at which a 2-point or more deterioration in PS was observed compared 
to baseline was used as the time of the event. The ECOG was assessed at every study visit. Disease 
events were collected for all subjects until the last subject had been followed for 3 years. If a particular 
event or a marked deterioration in PS had not occurred at the time of the analysis or the subject was lost 
to follow-up, the time-to-event variables were censored at the last disease or PS assessment date.  
Disease events 1, 3, 4 and 5 were combined into a composite endpoint of Skeletal Related Events (SREs) 
for the analysis. 
Total ALP normalisation defined as return of total ALP value to within normal range at 12 weeks in 2 
consecutive measurements (at least 2 weeks apart) after start of treatment in patients who had their total 
ALP above ULN at baseline. 
Time to PSA progression defined a) in patients with no PSA decline from baseline as ≥ 25% increase from 
the baseline value and an increase in absolute value of ≥ 2 ng/mL, at least 12 weeks from baseline; b) in 
patients with an initial PSA decline from baseline as ≥ 25% increase and an absolute increase of ≥ 2 
ng/mL above the nadir value, which is confirmed by a second value obtained three or more weeks later. 
Other secondary endpoints included: time to occurrence of first use of EBRT to relieve skeletal symptoms, 
use of radio-isotopes to relieve skeletal symptoms, new symptomatic pathological bone fractures 
(vertebral and non-vertebral), tumour related orthopaedic surgical intervention, first spinal cord 
compression, start of any other anti-cancer treatment, deterioration of ECOG PS by at least 2 points from 
baseline [includes death (score of 5) by definition], changes in PSA, changes in total ALP, performance 
status (PS) response and progression and Quality of life (QoL) assessed using Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire and EuroQoL (EQ-5D). 
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for patients with Prostate cancer (FACT-P) is a disease 
specific QoL questionnaire (i.e. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G] plus a 
prostate cancer specific module comprised of 5 subscales (Physical Well-being [PWB] Social/Family 
Well-being [SWB], Emotional Well-being [EWB], Functional Well-being [FWB], and Prostate Cancer 
[PCS]).  All FACT-P items are scored on a scale of 0 to 4 representing the extent to which the item reflects 
the experience of the individual completing the instrument (0 = not at all; 4 = very much).  Higher scores 
indicate better QoL.  The EQ-5D is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome and 
has been validated for the general population.  EQ-5D utility scores were calculated using 5 domains 
(mobility, self-care, pain/discomfort, usual activities and psychological status i.e. anxiety/depression) 
with 3 possible answers for each item (1 = no problems; 2 = some problems and 3 = extreme problems).  
Utility scores potentially range from - 0.59 to 1.0 (a score of 1 represents full health and a score of 0 
represents dead, negative values indicate worse than dead).     
Sample size 
The sample size was calculated based on two-sided Type I error: 5%; power: 90%; 50% of patients have 
had prior docetaxel treatment (median survival time in the placebo – no prior docetaxel: 18 months; 
radium-223 – no prior docetaxel: 22 months; placebo– prior docetaxel: 12 months; radium-223 - prior 
docetaxel: 15 months).  
Based on the above assumptions and further to the protocol amendments, a total of 900 subjects were 
required, with the final analysis to be conducted after 640 events had been observed.

Page 37/86 
 
 
 
 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised 2:1 to receive either radium-223 chloride or placebo study treatment. Three 
binary variables were used for stratification: total ALP < 220 U/L versus total ALP ≥ 220 U/L; current use 
of bisphosphonates: yes versus no; any prior use of docetaxel: yes versus no. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study: both patients and treating physicians were to be blinded. In view of the 
necessity of dose calculation, personnel at the nuclear department were unblinded. 
Statistical methods 
For the purpose of analysis, the following populations were defined: 
The ITT population was defined as all patients randomised to their respective treatment. The ITT 
population was the primary population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint and for the 
analysis of all secondary efficacy and clinical benefit endpoints.  
The Per Protocol population was only used for the interim analysis and it is not described further. 
The safety population was defined as all randomised patients who have received study medication. The 
safety population was used in the analysis of all safety endpoints. 
The primary endpoint was analysed using the stratified log-rank test stratified for the randomisation 
factors. A formal interim analysis (IA) was performed when a total of 314 deaths had been observed 
(cut-off date 14 October 2010) following IDMC recommendation to stop the study as the primary efficacy 
analysis of overall survival had crossed the pre-specified boundary for efficacy.  
The final analysis (data cut-off date 15 July 2011) was applied on the cumulative database of all data 
collected. However, the database did not include the last injection of 2 subjects. The data included within 
this cumulative database were not fully blinded since the study was unblinded on 1 July 2011 but no 
cross-over of placebo subjects had occurred by the data cut-off date. 
O'Brien-Fleming-type boundaries were used to preserve an overall two sided type I error rate of 0.05 for 
the interim and final analysis. The actual interim analysis boundary would be calculated based on the 
actual number of events for the interim analysis and this was 0.00275. 
In the time-to-event analyses, patients without the event were supposed to be censored. It was planned 
that patients who withdrew early from the study would be followed for survival. For withdrawals with no 
survival status data or who were lost to follow up, time to death was censored at the time of withdrawal 
(i.e. the last date on which these patients were known to be alive).  
The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was to recommend the Sponsor whether to 
continue, modify, or stop the clinical trial on the basis of efficacy and safety considerations. The 
pre-planned interim efficacy analysis assessed the effect of radium-223 on overall survival, with the 
intent to stop the study early if there was overwhelming evidence of treatment benefit. 
Subgroup analyses were performed on the primary efficacy variable for the ITT population. These 
analyses were defined by the three binary randomisation stratification and the following additional 
baseline covariates: ECOG performance status at baseline (0 and 1, vs. 2 or greater); Extent of Disease 
(Number of hot spots); Presence/absence of pain at baseline; Opiate use vs. non-use at baseline; 
Ethnicity (collected as Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Asian and Other). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 38/86 
 
 
 
 
ALP progression was defined as >=25% increase from baseline at least 12 weeks from baseline (“12 week 
rule”). Post hoc analyses were conducted with ALP progression from day 1. 
Finally, the key secondary endpoints were ordered hierarchically for interim analysis in the course of a 
gatekeeping procedure in order to control for overall type I error rate at 0.05.

Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled from June 2008 until February 2011 from 136 study centres worldwide (Australia; 
Belgium; Brazil; Canada; Czech Republic; France; Germany; Hong Kong; Israel; Italy; Norway; Poland; 
Singapore; Slovakia; Spain; Sweden; The Netherlands; UK; USA). 
Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol, dated 14 December 2007, was subsequently amended 6 times: 
•  Amendment 1 (dated 23 May 2008): changes regarding the stratification factors (removed 
stratification factors for ECOG and any prior cytotoxic therapy and added stratification factors for 
current use of bisphosphonates (yes or no) and prior use of docetaxel (yes or no).

•  Amendment 2 (dated 9 July 2008): changed the sample size from 450 to 750 subjects randomized; 
planned for an unblinded interim analysis of overall survival, changed PSA outcome and reporting to 
adhere to the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (March 2008). 
•  Amendment 3 (dated 10 July 2009): screening haematology values were measured at a maximum of 
1 week prior to randomization and it was required to be at least 10 g/dL (it should not have been lower 
than 8 g/dL within 24 hours before any injection); after documented PSA progression, the PSA could 
decline prior to randomization provided that the screening value was at least 5 ng/mL; changed the 
interval between injection of bisphosphonates and injection of study drug (at least 2 hours before or 
after study drug administration); changed the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint from Cox 
proportional hazards regression to a stratified log-rank test; changed the definition of the Safety 
population from all randomized subjects to all randomized subjects who had received at least 1 study 
drug administration; added sub-group analyses for safety and secondary efficacy variables in order to 
examine relationships between exposure and response. 
•  Amendment 4 (dated 23 June 2010): increase of the statistical power from 80% to 90%; the sample 
size from 750 to 900 with an increase in the accrual period from 24 to 30 months, changed time of 
interim analysis to be after approximately 320 events. 
•  Amendment 5 (dated 20 January 2011): to control for overall false positive rate (type I error rate), 
five secondary endpoints have been identified (including creating a composite endpoint for the time to 
occurrence of first SRE based on disease events already being collected and adding total ALP 
normalisation) and ordered hierarchically according to their clinical importance. 
•  Amendment 6 (dated 24 June 2011): due to IDMC approval to unblind the study, changes to study 
design and reference therapy (placebo), allowing access to Xofigo for subjects who previously 
received placebo. 
The most common violations recorded were for subjects not having the required castrate serum 
testosterone levels ≤ 50 ng/dL (14/54 (12.6%) in the radium-223 group; 7/268 (2.6%) in the placebo 
group) and not showing the required serum PSA progression at the time of randomization (17/541 (3.1%) 
in the radium-223 group; 7/268 (2.6%) in the placebo group). 
Protocol violations resulted in the exclusion from the PP population in the interim analysis.

Numbers analysed 
The ITT population comprised 921 subjects, 614 in the Xofigo treatment group and 307 in the placebo 
group. The Safety population comprised 901 subjects, 600 in the Xofigo treatment group and 301 in the 
placebo group. 
The ITT population (921 subjects receiving BSoC: 614 Alpharadin and 307 placebo) was used for the 
updated analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint and for the analysis of all secondary efficacy and clinical 
benefit endpoints. The efficacy results presented for the updated analysis relate to the study up until the 
cut-off date of 15 July 2011; no cross-over of placebo subjects had occurred by the data cut-off date. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The efficacy results in terms of the primary endpoint of Overall Survival and for both the primary (cut-of 
date 14 October 2010) and the updated (cut-of date 15 July 2011) analysis are summarised in the

As mentioned earlier, other secondary endpoints included: time to occurrence of first use of EBRT to 
relieve skeletal symptoms, use of radio-isotopes to relieve skeletal symptoms, new symptomatic 
pathological bone fractures (vertebral and non-vertebral), tumour related orthopaedic surgical 
intervention, first spinal cord compression, start of any other anti-cancer treatment, deterioration of 
ECOG PS by at least 2 points from baseline [includes death (score of 5) by definition], changes in PSA, 
changes in total ALP, performance status (PS) response and progression and Quality of life (QoL) 
assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire and EuroQoL 
(EQ-5D).

Regarding the QoL endpoints, a smaller decrease median FACT-P score was noted in the radium-223 
chloride arm when compared to the placebo group at both weeks 16 and 24 (i.e. radium-223 chloride -2.0 
and placebo -5.57. For the EQ-5D endpoint, changes from baseline were observed at week 16 and 24; the 
changes were in favour of radium-223 chloride. 
Overall, both treatment groups experienced loss of quality of life captured by both instruments. The loss 
of quality of life was more pronounced in the placebo group. Compliance with filling out the questionnaires 
became very low during follow up.

No efficacy analyses across trials were submitted.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special populations were submitted (see discussion on clinical efficacy). 
Supportive studies 
Two supportive phase II Studies (BC1-02 and BC1-03) were submitted. Additionally, the dose-response 
study BC1-04, described earlier, is considered as supportive. 
Study BC1-02 
Study BC1-02 was a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre study designed to evaluate the 
efficacy of repeated radium-223 chloride injections in prostate cancer patients with painful bone 
metastases.  
Eligible patients had confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with multiple bone metastases or 
1 painful lesion with 2 consecutive rising amounts of PSA levels at least 2 weeks apart. The treatment 
period was three months (12 weeks), during which four injections of radium-223 chloride were given at 
4-week intervals, follow-up until 24 months.  All subjects received a single treatment of EBR (external 
beam radiotherapy) followed within 7 days by the first injection of study medication. 
The primary objective was to study the biological effectiveness of radium-223 therapy measured as time 
to occurrence of skeletal-related events (SRE) and change in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase 
(bone-ALP) levels. 
Results 
The study population had a mean age of 72.3 years (range, 57 to 88), body mass index of 26.9 kg/m2 
(range, 18 to 38) and mean BW of 82.6 kg at inclusion (range, 54 to 109). Prostate cancer had been

diagnosed a mean of 5.12 years (range, 0.2 to 23.1) and bony metastases a mean of 1.58 years (range, 
0.1 to 17.8) before entry to the study. The median extent of disease on entry to the study was category 
2 (6 to 20 lesions on bone scan) and the mean pain severity index was 3.83 (of a maximum 10).  
A total of 64 patients were enrolled, randomised, and treated (33 patients in the radium-223 chloride 
group and 31 patients in the placebo group). The 12-month visit was completed by 19 (58%) and by 12 
(39%) and the 24-month visit was completed by 10 (30%) and by 3 (10%) subjects in the Xofigo and 
placebo group respectively. 
The results of the primary and co-primary endpoint are presented in Tables 18 and 19 below.

Study BC1-03  
Study BC1-03 was a double-blind, dose-response phase II, multicentre study of radium-223 designed to 
investigate whether there is a dose-response relationship for radium-223 in patients with painful bone 
metastases secondary to prostate carcinoma regarding the palliation of bone pain. Following protocol 
amendment 02, the study design was changed from an open-label study assessing a dose of 100 kBq/kg 
body weight (b.w.) radium-223 in 35 breast and prostate cancer patients, to a double-blind, randomised, 
dose-ranging study assessing four dose levels (5, 25, 50 and 100 kBq/kg b.w. radium-223) in 100 
hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients.  
The primary endpoint was the pain index defined by a combination of the change in diary pain rating, 
(recorded by patients on a visual analogue scale [VAS]), and the change in analgesic consumption (from 
baseline to Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16). Randomized patients received a single dose i.v. injection of 
radium-223 chloride (at 5, 25, 50 or 100 kBq/kg BW) followed by a 16-week Post-Treatment Period. At 
the end of this period the study was unblinded. Follow-up visits were planned 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months. 
A second injection of radium-223 chloride (fixed dose of 50 kBq/kg BW) could be offered to patients 
during the Follow-up Period at the Investigator's discretion.   
Results 
Among demographic characteristics, more than half of the enrolled population had ECOG of 1 and the 
extent of disease was of grade 3 (>20 mets) in 41.9% of patients.  
A statistically significant (Jonckheere-Terpstra test) trend for dose-response relationship at Week 2 (P = 
0.035) was reported on PP population since the mean pain score was higher in the 2 lowest dose groups 
(4.8 and 4.1 in the 5 and 25 kBq/kg BW groups, respectively) compared to the 2 highest dose groups (3.9 
in both the 50 and 100 kBq/kg BW groups). The analysis on ITT population, although showed a trend in 
pain score reduction in the higher (5 and 25 kBq/kg BW) groups, did not showed any statistical results. 
Daily diary data on average bone pain (VAS recorded by patients) showed a decrease over time in all dose 
groups but the change in mean VAS score was higher in the lower dose group (5 and 25 kBq/kg B*W) 
than in the higher (50 and 100 kBq/kg BW) dose group. The highest change from baseline was seen in the 
25 kBq/kg BW group (data not shown). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The indication applied for reflects the patient population included in the pivotal trial and it is independent 
of line of chemotherapy, i.e. encompasses chemo-naive patients as well as patients having failed first line 
docetaxel chemotherapy. In contrast to a population previously treated with docetaxel, which would be 
expected to be rather homogeneous, chemotherapy-naïve patients are rather heterogeneous as they are 
either not eligible for docetaxel or do not receive docetaxel due to unwillingness or non-availability of 
docetaxel, factors of unknown distribution between study arms in this case. Therefore, this group may 
unite patients with very different prognosis. Several surveys have concluded that a large proportion of 
patients do not receive first-line docetaxel after disease progression during castrate levels of testosterone 
in clinical practice, probably in view of its toxicity and the modest survival benefit around 2-3 months. 
However, sensitivity analyses showed that the OS results were robust, including for all baseline 
parameters tested, so that the uncertainty from the heterogeneity of the patient population and the 
imbalances in baseline characteristics does not affect the efficacy conclusions.

The pivotal trial was performed as a placebo-controlled add-on to best standard of care. Best standard of 
care was an oncologist’s choice among overall acceptable palliative treatment regimens. No common 
back-bone treatment was used. Of note, there is potential impact of co-medication on endpoints such as 
PSA response or skeletal-related events. Imbalances in co-medication over the study period, especially 
after the treatment phase, may contribute to the magnitude or the maintenance of the beneficial effect 
with respect to SREs; this is difficult to differentiate from a treatment effect in view of selection processes 
in the trial. However, a survival benefit of the magnitude observed in the pivotal study of radium-223 is 
unlikely to be due to co-medication alone.  
The dosing regimen selected by the Applicant for clinical development was a fixed-dose regimen (50 KBq 
/kg per body weight) administered 6 times at intervals of 4 weeks between each administration which is 
based on the results of the supportive BC1-02 and BC1-04 studies and seems to represent the optimal 
biological dose. The use of a treatment dose calculated on the basis of patient’s weight and not directly 
measured by radioisotopic procedure is acceptable, despite the fact that it disregards pharmacokinetic 
variability between patients and the extent of potential Xofigo accumulation depending on factors such as 
the administered dose, metastatic burden and location as well as tumour permeability. This is because 
radium-223 rapidly goes into the bone and bone lesions and it is also rapidly excreted via the intestinal 
route which reduces a patient-specific variability of the activity at the target site substantially. Moreover, 
only about 1% of the energy is emitted as gamma radiation (which could be used for imaging and thus for 
dosimetric evaluation of exposure) and the total activity administered to a patient is only 50 kBq/kg body 
weight which is much lower than doses usually applied for other radiopharmaceuticals. 
The selected interval between doses (4 weeks) was justified by the fact that haematological side effects 
were expected to recover in most patients after three weeks and in every patient after 4 weeks. However, 
study BC1-04 (dose-seeking study) evaluated efficacy and safety at a 6-week interval.  
Optimisation of the dose could further explore the effect or treatment withdrawal, longer treatment 
duration, dose adjustments (e.g., increase in non-responders and decrease in patients experiencing 
excessive toxicity), use of a lower number of doses (even a single-dose as other radiopharmaceuticals) or 
higher interval between doses (especially because the absorbed radiation dose is likely to change during 
the treatment period if radium-223 works on bone metastases). Until further dose optimisation data 
become available, the total number of doses suggested (6 doses over a period of 5 months) is acceptable. 
At the time of the design and conduct of the pivotal study, the choice of placebo plus BSC as comparator 
was adequate; however, this is currently questioned in relation to the therapeutic armamentarium 
nowadays available for the treatment of CRPC patients, primarily the use of abiraterone in asymptomatic 
or only mildly symptomatic patients, as well as abiraterone and cabazitaxel in patients having failed 
docetaxel. In addition, other radionuclides (beta radiators such as Samarium-153 or Strontium-89) are 
used for pain palliation associated with bone metastasis. None of the second-line treatments is curative, 
and patients either fail to respond, or progress after an initial response. Cabazitaxel is also associated 
with significant toxicity. Other bone-targeted agents have either not been studied (e.g. Samarium-153, 
Strontium-89), or were not studied for their impact on survival. However, it is neither known how 
radium-223 compares to other recently authorised products for systemic treatment of prostate cancer or 
how it compares to the palliative effect on bone disease of other radionuclides. 
Treatment allocation was concealed and the study was double-blind. However, in view of the radioactive 
nature of the product, the nuclear department of the centre was unblinded. The toxicity profile was not 
expected to de-mask the nature of study treatment. On the other hand, administration by an unblinded 
member of the nuclear lab required no special flanking procedures which would facilitate the maintenance 
of the blind. Maintenance of the blind would be critical for quality of life analyses used as supportive 
endpoints.

The conduct of the pivotal study and amendments to the protocol did not give rise to concerns. There was 
one pre-planned increase in sample size and few losses to follow-up with respect to the primary endpoint.  
In the course of the interim analysis of the pivotal trial, inconsistencies in the database were noted with 
respect to the secondary endpoint skeletal related-events. Individual components of this composite 
endpoint were captured in different parts of the CRF and it was necessary to verify, if all events which had 
been described in e.g. the concomitant treatment (e.g. EBRT) or adverse event (e.g. spinal cord 
compression) part were indeed accounted for also for the evaluation of efficacy. Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted which indicated the robustness of the results.  
The study was terminated early as recommended by an independent data monitoring committee during a 
pre-specified interim analysis in view of the statistically significant prolongation of overall survival with 
respect to the primary endpoint and its support from further secondary endpoints. Results were updated 
after 6 months at the latest time-point before patients were allowed to cross-over from placebo to Xofigo. 
While the pre-specified interim analysis represents the confirmatory analysis, the updated analysis (a 
cumulative report including the data of the interim analysis) is regarded as the clinically more relevant 
analysis in view of data maturity of the primary endpoint, overall survival, and further time-to-event 
endpoints such as time-to-first-skeletal-event.  The updated analysis contained some unblinded data, but 
in view of the little overlap (database lock 15 days after unblinding, the overall maturity of data (almost 
all subjects had completed injections) and the objective primary endpoint, this is acceptable. P-values of 
the updated analysis cannot formally be accepted from a statistical perspective, of course.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics were representative of the target population. In both groups 
more than half of the population had basal total ALP values <220 U/L. This cut-off value identifies a 
population with high basal elevated levels of total ALP (the serum ALP cut-off is 120 U/L is generally used) 
reflecting the target population characterised by highly prevalent bone disease. Baseline categories 
differed mostly below 4%. However, the biggest difference between study arms to the advantage of the 
radium-223 group in both interim and updated analysis referred to extent of disease and PSA at baseline. 
More patients in the radium-223 group had less than 6 metastases in bone. Extent of disease was a strong 
predictor of survival (longest overall survival of all subgroups in patients with most limited extent of 
disease). The observed safety profile in the pivotal trial was also highly suggestive of an overall superior 
health status of the radium-233 group. Since an imbalance in non-prostate-cancer-related deaths 
contributed to the magnitude of the observed prolongation of survival in the radium-223 group, a superior 
health status in the active treatment group could not be excluded. This is especially relevant, as the OS 
was not supported by PFS or TTP data and a direct anti-tumour effect remained elusive also in view of the 
marginal effect on PSA. The definition of subgroups analysis of OS according to stratification factors 
(baseline ALP level, bisphosphonate use during study treatment, prior docetaxel therapy, see Figure 8) 
and of exploratory analyses of OS according to clinically relevant covariates (graded EOD at baseline, 
baseline pain, opiate use, ethnicity, albumin, total ALP, Hb, PSA, LDH, ECOG PS, and age, data not shown) 
is helpful in exploring the consistency of the result in the overall population and in depicting the effect of 
baseline covariates and treatment. The exploratory analyses of survival adjusted for important prognostic 
factors showed a consistent treatment effect. Thus important bias do to imbalance in prognostic factors is 
considered unlikely. The additional analyses provide sufficient reassurance about a robust beneficial 
effect on overall survival with some remaining uncertainty regarding the exact quantification. 
The primary objective was to compare overall survival. Overall survival is an undisputed primary endpoint 
for late-stage cancer. However, particularly in prostate cancer, death due to non-cancer causes 
represents a competing risk. 
The choice and hierarchy of secondary endpoints (ALP and skeletal-related effects) follows the proposed 
pharmacodynamic action (main effect on bone disease), but it did not allow complete tumour assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 59/86 
 
 
 
 
including extra-osseous disease by imaging data. Thus, OS is not supported by PFS or TTP in the single 
pivotal study.   
The clinical relevance of the endpoints focussing on bone marker turnover is questionable. Although total 
ALP and not bone specific ALP is considered, a better radium-223 effect was demonstrated in patients 
having total ALP ≥220 U/L and thus in those patients having a high osteoblastic activity and probably 
higher extent of disease.  
A direct effect on tumour is limited to a locally determined PSA concentration, with overall very few 
responses and high heterogeneity of response rates across trials. All aspects of the composite endpoint 
SRE are referring to clinically relevant issues and there is a consistent effect in three of four aspects of the 
composite endpoint. The clinical impact of the different event types is somewhat different: while EBRT 
indicates need for palliation of skeletal symptoms, it does not reflect the acute medical emergency as e.g. 
spinal cord compression. Symptomatic pathological fracture indicated advanced bone disease and 
surgical intervention aims at preventing further complications. Due to the absence of systematic 
follow-up by imaging, non-symptomatic fractures were not recorded.  EBRT (which may be more 
subjective compared to the infrequent components) dominates the effect on the composite endpoint SRE 
(incidence in about 30% of patients compared to well below 10% for the other components).  
The proportion of patients having to undergo surgical intervention it is too low (around 2%) to allow firm 
conclusions. The (low) number of patients experiencing spinal cord compression is half in the radium-223 
group, which represents a clinically meaningful reduction.   
All skeletal-related events appear as rather late occurring events (median occurrence of earliest skeletal 
event, in particular time to need for EBRT, in updated analyses was 17 months compared to median 
overall survival of 11 months). Location of metastases at baseline and whether there were imbalances 
with respect to developing complications due to the site of metastases between groups were not 
recorded. Similarly, it was not recorded whether the more infrequent SREs were occurring early or late. 
It is unlikely, however, that the entire magnitude of delay of skeletal-related events is due to baseline 
imbalances.   
Current use of bisphosphonates subgroup analysis showed similar HRs (0.69 yes and 0.73 no) between 
the two groups. Although skeletal metastases from prostate cancer primarily have increased osteoblastic 
activity (a bone-forming phenotype as a result of stimulation of osteoblasts, inhibition of osteoclasts or 
both by cancer cells), evidence also suggests increased osteoclast activation and bone resorption. Results 
of the BC1-02 study, although obtained on a limited number of subjects, confirm Xofigo preferential effect 
in areas of new bone formation (osteoblastic metastasis) but also suggest an action on bone resorption 
areas (osteoclastic metastasis). The reduction (especially in view of spinal cord compression) or delay of 
clinically meaningful skeletal-related events is supportive of a beneficial effect of radium-223 on bone 
metastases. It is a relevant objective for the treatment of bone metastases in patients with symptomatic 
castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer. Additional, although weak, support for a palliative effect 
is given by recorded changes in performance status and quality of life. The ad-hoc analysis of 
time-to-initial-opioid use in the pivotal study also supports the palliative effect of radium-223.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For the primary endpoint a difference of 2.8 months in median OS was observed in the radium-223 group 
in the interim analysis. In the updated analysis, the difference increased to a total of 3.6 months (14.9 
months in the radium-223 compared to 11.3 months in the placebo group). This is statistically significant 
and a difference of this magnitude is regarded as clinically meaningful in advanced cancer stages. An 
overall survival benefit for the Xogifo group had also been seen in a small placebo-controlled phase 2 
study. Interpretation of the survival difference is impaired by baseline imbalances in both studies with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 60/86 
 
 
 
 
respect to extent of disease and baseline PSA. These imbalances are suggestive of a superior health 
status of the Xofigo group. Additional sensitivity analyses addressed this issue for the pivotal study; in the 
adjusted analyses the effect on overall survival appears to be slightly smaller but robust in this respect. 
An imbalance (of 8% absolute) with respect to non-prostate-cancer related deaths in the placebo group 
in the pivotal trial clearly in favour of the Xofigo treatment group  appears to drive the increasing 
difference in overall survival in the updated analysis. The size of the impact on the observed effects on OS 
is currently not clear. Overall survival after a subsequent treatment was favourable in the Xofigo 
treatment group; however, median overall survival appears not to be relevantly influenced by the 
response to subsequent treatment in this subgroup. Differences in the distribution of causes of death 
between treatment groups should be interpreted with caution since they may be confounded by the effect 
of treatment. Although a confounding of non-prostate-cancer related deaths cannot be ruled out, in view 
of the small imbalance and the results of analyses of survival adjusted by important prognostic factors, 
important bias seems unlikely. 
The results of the available secondary endpoints support a beneficial effect on bone disease of 
radium-223 compared to placebo: skeletal-related events, changes in performance status and further 
treatment for pain or prostate cancer and changes in ALP all favoured the Xofigo arm. Fewer patients in 
the radium-223 group experienced skeletal-related events or ALP progression compared to the placebo 
group and at a later time point. All aspects of the composite endpoint SRE referred to clinically relevant 
issues and there was a consistent effect in three of four aspects of the composite endpoint.  
Changes in ALP as such, however, cannot be related to a patient-relevant endpoint. In addition, the effect 
on ALP appears to be transient and most prominent during the treatment phase. Kaplan Meier analyses 
were limited to the first 9 months and the other endpoints were referenced to the 12th week 
(mid-treatment). While an immediate controlling effect on active bone remodelling appears plausible in 
view of the bone-seeking nature of the alpha-radiation-emitting radium-223, the cytotoxic nature of 
radium-223 could also result in decreased secretion of ALP from osteoblasts.  
The beneficial effect of radium-223 on pain is supported by fewer patients in the radium-223 receiving 
either opioids or other radioisotopes also at a later time point, as well as a delayed marked deterioration 
of the performance status in the radium-223 group. A mainly delaying effect is evident for the receipt of 
other anti-cancer treatments (with similar final proportions of patients receiving it).   
In spite of a statistically significant result in the primary endpoint of overall survival and other key 
secondary endpoints, the effect on PSA progression did not indicate a relevant decrease in cancer cell 
mass with a similar final proportion of patients experiencing PSA progression at a very similar median 
time point and reductions in PSA in only a small subset of patients in all clinical trials. The rather limited 
effect on PSA is in line with the presumed mode of action. Determination of PSA in the local laboratories 
could also have resulted in substantial variation across centres.  
Quality of life data are also suggestive of a slight delaying effect on the deterioration of quality of life 
during treatment, but results of the pivotal study were not consistent with the phase 2 results and they 
did not reach minimally important differences. 
Since radium-223 chloride is neither metabolised by the liver nor eliminated via the bile, hepatic 
impairment was considered by the Applicant not to affect the pharmacokinetics of Xofigo. No dose 
adjustment is considered necessary in patients with hepatic impairment. Similarly, since excretion in 
urine is minimal and the major route of elimination is via the feces, renal impairment is not expected to 
affect the PK of radium-223 chloride and no dose adjustment is considered necessary in patients with 
renal impairment. 
As expected, based on the epidemiology of prostate cancer, the median age of enrolled 
patients in the pivotal study was 70 years. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were

observed between elderly (aged ≥ 65 years) and younger patients (aged < 65 years) in the 
phase III study. However, the percentage of patients aged ≥85 years was very low (roughly 
10 subjects in each group). Overall, no dose adjustment is considered necessary in elderly 
patients (see SmPC section 4.2). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall efficacy results from the pivotal trial showed a statistically significant benefit in OS, the primary 
study endpoint, in patients with HRPC with bone metastasis treated with Xofigo plus BSC compared to 
placebo plus BSC. Results from secondary endpoints support the positive effect of Xofigo treatment on 
clinical bone metastasis sequelae (SREs) and on bone markers (ALP) confirming the target efficacy of 
Xofigo on bone metastases. The activity of Xofigo in CRPC patients with bone metastasis is biologically 
supported and it is consistent with preclinical evidence. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety database of radium 223-chloride has been presented in 3 different populations: 
• 
• 
• 
Pool 2: Safety data from the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Study BC1-06 (n=600). 
Pool 4: Safety data (50 kBq/kg data only) from studies: ATI-BC-1 (n=3), BC1-02 (n=33), BC1-03 
(n=25), BC1-04 (n=39), BC1-08 (n=3), BC1-06 (n=600). 
Pool 5: Safety data (50 kBq/kg data only) from studies: ATI-BC-1 (n=3), BC1-02 (n=33), BC1-03 
(n=25), BC1-04 (n=39), BC1-08 (n=3). 
Patients in Pool 5 have often been treated only with a single dose of the recommended dose and overall 
treatment regimes in the patients included in this pool were very heterogeneous. Therefore, the safety 
analysis below is focused on the population defined in pool 2 which represents the population of the 
pivotal study. In the pivotal study, 901 patients (600 treated with radium-223 chloride and 301 treated 
with placebo) received at least 1 injection of study drug and were included in the safety population. 
Twenty patients (14 in radium-223 chloride and 6 in the placebo group) were randomised but never 
received treatment. One subject was randomised to placebo but received radium 223 chloride at Week 0; 
thus the subject was summarised in the placebo group for the ITT population and in the radium 223 
chloride group for the safety population. The median duration of exposure to study treatment in the safety 
population was 141 days in the radium-223 chloride group and 128 days in the placebo group. The mean 
number of injections of study treatment was 5.1 for radium-223 chloride treated patients and 4.5 for the 
placebo group. 
The duration of exposure to radium 223 chloride for the above different populations is summarised in

The incidence of subjects who experienced a Grade 3 or 4 TEAE was higher in the placebo group (62.5%, 
188/301), compared to the Radium-223 group (56.5%, 339/600). The Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs with the 
highest proportion of subjects were bone pain (20.8%, 125/600 Radium-223; 25.6%, 77/301 placebo) 
and anaemia (12.8%, 77/600 Radium-223; 13.0%, 39/301 placebo). 
Table 23 below summarises the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) for Xofigo. 
Table 23.  Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in patients treated with radium-223 chloride, study 
BC1-06 
Adverse Events of special interest (AESI) included injection site reactions, new primary malignancies, 
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, osteonecrosis of the jaw and eye disorders. 
Grade 1 and 2 injection site reactions, such as erythema, pain and swelling, were reported in 1.2% of 
patients treated with Xofigo and in 0% of patients receiving placebo, in the pivotal study.

Like any other radiation therapy, Xofigo contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation 
exposure. Long-term cumulative radiation exposure may be associated with an increased risk of cancer 
and hereditary defects. Overall none of the 12 cases of primary cancers observed during the clinical 
development (8 of them in BC1-06) were considered likely primarily due to radium-223 chloride.  
Thrombocytopenia (all grades) occurred in 11.5% of patients treated with Xofigo and 5.6% of patients 
receiving placebo. Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in 6.3% of patients treated with Xofigo 
and in 2% of patients receiving placebo. Overall, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was 
lower in patients that did not previously receive docetaxel (2.8% in patients treated with Xofigo versus 
0.8% in patients receiving placebo) compared to patients that previously received docetaxel (8.9% in 
patients treated with Xofigo versus 2.9% in patients receiving placebo).  
Neutropenia (all grades) was reported in 5% of patients treated with Xofigo and in 1% of patients 
receiving placebo. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was observed in 2.2% of patients treated with Xofigo and 
in 0.7% of patients receiving placebo. Overall, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was lower in 
patients that did not previously receive docetaxel (0.8% in patients treated with Xofigo versus 0.8% in 
patients receiving placebo) compared to patients that previously received docetaxel (3.2% in patients 
treated with Xofigo versus 0.6% in patients receiving placebo). 
In the pivotal study, the incidence rate of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) was 0.67% (4/600 patients) in 
the radium-223 chloride group compared to 0.33% (1/301 patients) in the placebo group. No other cases 
of ONJ were reported from other studies. All patients with ONJ were exposed to prior or concomitant 
zolendronic acid and prior chemotherapy.  
Due to the observation of retinal detachment in dogs, eye disorders were of special interest during the 
clinical development. In the pivotal study, 2 patients (1 in each treatment group) experienced an SAE 
categorized as an eye disorder:  1 (0.2%) case of cataract in a radium-223 chloride patient and 1 (0.3%) 
case of glaucoma in a placebo patient. However, no case of retinal detachment has been reported in 
clinical trials. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths  
During the pivotal study, 518 deaths occurred in the safety population: 327 (54.5%) of the included 
patients died in the radium-223 chloride group and 191 (63.5%) in the placebo group. Overall, 26 (4.3%) 
patients in the radium-223- chloride group and 22 (7.3%) patients in the placebo group died during the 
treatment period of the study. The largest proportion of subjects died between 24 weeks and 1 year after 
their first injection of study drug (22.2% in radium-223 chloride group versus 25.6% in placebo group). 
During the 3-year follow-up period deaths were balanced between the treatment groups. The rate of 
patients with at least 1 TEAE leading to death was significantly 16 % in patients within the radium-223 
chloride group versus 22.3 % in the placebo group. Most of the deaths observed were reported due to 
disease progression in 48.2% of patients in the radium-223 chloride group and 49.5% of patients in the 
placebo group. Skeletal metastases were the most frequent type of prostate cancer-related death (40.7% 
in radium-223 chloride and 44.9% in placebo), while cardiac disorders were the most common non 
prostate cancer-related causes of death (2% % in radium-223 chloride and 3% in placebo).  
A summary of deaths is presented in Table 24 below.

In the pivotal study BC1-06 the number of patients with any SAE was 46.8% in the radium-223 group 
versus 60.1% in the placebo group.  
The most common (≥5% in either group) treatment-emergent SAEs were: bone pain (10.0% radium-223 
chloride; 16.3% placebo), malignant neoplasm progression (11.0% radium-223 chloride; 12.0% 
placebo), anaemia (8.2% radium-223 chloride; 8.6% placebo) and spinal cord compression (3.5% 
radium-223 chloride; 5.3% placebo).  The main difference seen between the treatment groups where the 
highest occurrence was in the radium 223 chloride group was thrombocytopenia (2.3% radium-223 
chloride; 1.0% placebo). 
The following events were reported more frequently in the placebo group: bone pain (10.0% radium-223 
chloride; 16.3% placebo), fatigue (1.0% radium-223 chloride; 3.0% placebo), pathological fracture 
(2.3% radium-223 chloride; 3.7% placebo), and spinal cord compression (3.5% radium-223 chloride; 
5.3% placebo). 
Treatment-emergent SAEs considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment were 
experienced by 72 subjects (12.0%) in the radium-223 chloride group and 30 subjects (10.0%) in the 
placebo group. The treatment-emergent SAEs considered related to study drug reported by ≥ 1% of 
subjects in both groups were: anaemia (6.0% radium-223 chloride; 3.7% placebo), thrombocytopenia 
(1.8% radium-223 chloride; 1.0% placebo) and bone pain (1.0% radium-223 chloride; 2.0% placebo).

SAEs of thrombocytopenia occurred in higher rates for patients in both treatment groups who received 
external beam radiation to bone. SAEs rates of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea were two- to three-fold 
higher for the radium-223 chloride group who received EBRT compared with those who did not receive 
EBRT.

median values showed a small decrease over time in both treatment groups but the changes observed 
were not clinically meaningful. 
Safety in special populations 
The safety of radium-223 chloride in children and adolescents below 18 years of age has not been studied. 
In the pivotal study, 447 patients (74.5%) were 65 years of age and over, while 196 patients (32.7%) 
were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety were observed between elderly (aged 
≥65 years) and younger patients (aged <65 years) in the pivotal study population.  
Safety of radium-223 chloride has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment.  
In the pivotal study no relevant differences in safety were observed between patients with mild renal 
impairment and those with normal renal function. Only limited data is available on patients with moderate 
renal impairment. No data are available on patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal 
disease.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Please refer to the discussion on clinical pharmacology.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Treatment-emergent adverse events that led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment were 
experienced by a total of 16.5% (99/600) patients in radium 223 chloride group and 20.6% (62/301) 
patients in the placebo group (see Participant flow in the pivotal study Study BC1-06).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety evaluation in the clinical development programme of radium-223 chloride was appropriate in all 
trials submitted and allows an adequate safety assessment. The study design and the sample size of the 
pivotal trial of the pivotal phase 3 trial BC1-06 is acceptable. With respect to safety aspects, no general 
doubts about the quality of the submitted data was raised; in general missing safety data was not an issue 
of concern in this application and all limitations resulting from missing exposure due to exclusion criteria 
are adequately covered in the product information.  
As usual in the advanced cancer setting, nearly all patients had adverse events and almost all adverse 
events could be manifestations of the disease itself. Until the end-of-treatment period, TEAES, SAEs, 
discontinuations due to TEAEs and mortality were consistently in favour of radium-223-chloride.  
A total of 93% (558/600) of patients in the radium-223 chloride group and 96.3% (290/301) of patients 
in the placebo group reported treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The difference in favour of 
radium-223 chloride is even larger for the SAE event rate, were in the radium-223 chloride group only 
46.8% (281/600) of the patients experienced serious TEAEs in comparison to 60.1% (181/301) in the 
placebo group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013

The incidence of subjects who experienced a Grade 3 or 4 TEAE was higher in the placebo group (62.5%, 
188/301), compared to the radium-223 group (56.5%, 339/600). The Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs with the 
highest frequency were bone pain (20.8%, 125/600 Radium-223; 25.6%, 77/301 placebo) and anaemia 
(12.8%, 77/600 Radium-223; 13.0%, 39/301 placebo). 
Mortality was also lower in the radium-223 group: overall, 4.3% (26/600) of patients in the radium-223- 
chloride group and 7.3% (22/301) in the placebo group died during the treatment period of the study. The 
largest proportion of subjects died between 24 weeks and 1 year after their first injection of study drug 
(radium-223:22.2%, 133/600 versus placebo: 25.6%, 77/301). With respect to safety as a primary 
endpoint, it seems interesting that again the rate of patients with patients with at least 1 TEAE leading to 
death was significantly lower in patients within the radium-223 chloride group (16 %) versus 22,3 % in 
the placebo group.  
With respect to drug-related adverse events the following specific TEAEs were identified and observed 
with a notably higher frequency in the active group than in the placebo group: Diarrhoea (25.2% versus 
15.0%), thrombocytopenia (11.5% versus 5.6%) and neutropenia (5.0% versus 1.0%).While diarrhoea 
may reflect direct radiation effect on the intestine surface cells during excretion, thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia and lymphocytopenia as well as anaemia may be caused by radiation effect on the bone 
marrow. Most of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting adverse events were of Grade 1 or 2. Higher-grade drug 
related events were mainly observed with thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anaemia. Most of those 
patients were pre-treated with docetaxel and/or EBRB, which may have contributed to the SAE. However, 
higher frequencies for thrombocytopenia and neutropenia/leukopenia did not result in an increased rate 
of haemorrhages or infections, which indicates that acute toxicity is manageable in clinical practice. 
Therefore, haematological evaluation of patients must be performed at baseline and prior to every dose 
of Xofigo. Before the first administration, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be ≥ 1.5 x 109/l, the 
platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/l and haemoglobin ≥ 10.0 g/dl. Before subsequent administrations, the ANC 
should be ≥ 1.0 x 109/l and the platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/l. In case there is no recovery in these values 
within 6 weeks after the last administration of Xofigo despite receiving standard of care, further treatment 
with Xofigo should only be continued after a careful benefit/risk evaluation. 
Patients with evidence of compromised bone marrow reserve e.g. following prior cytotoxic chemotherapy 
and/or radiation treatment should be treated with caution.  
Bone radiation with radium-223 may increase the general risk for osteonecrosis, in particular in 
combination with bisphosphonate treatment. About 1 % of the target population develops osteonecrosis 
of the jaw (ONJ) if treated with zoledronic acid for bone metastases. The rate of ONJ in the radium-223 
chloride group was (0,67%). It was concluded that radium-223 appeared not to increase the overall rate 
of ONJ in the target population treated. However, data were considered inconclusive due to the overall 
limited low event rate and relatively small study population for an event of such frequency. A warning is 
included in the SmPC aiming to clarify that radium-223 chloride may increase the rate of osteonecrosis of 
the jaw (ONJ) in particular in combination with zoledronic acid and previous cytostatic treatment.  
Active inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, acute intestinal infections) 
may increase the risk for septic complications or intestinal perforation upon treatment with radium-223. 
This is because excretion of radium-223 is mainly via the gastrointestinal system, which leads to a high 
local radiation activity on intestine mucosa and might exacerbate pre-existing intestinal damage. Xofigo 
should only be administered after a careful benefit-risk assessment in patients with acute inflammatory 
bowel disease (see SmPC section 4.4). 
In patients with untreated imminent or established spinal cord compression, treatment with standard of 
care, as clinically indicated, should be completed before starting or resuming treatment with Xofigo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 70/86 
 
 
 
 
Similarly, in patients with bone fractures, orthopaedic stabilisation of fractures should be performed 
before starting or resuming treatment with Xofigo (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Cases of retinal detachment were observed only in dogs as a late complication during the non-clinical 
studies, but no cases were observed in the clinical studies (see discussion on Non-clinical aspects).  
The proposed injection duration (generally up to 1 minute) takes into consideration avoidance of injection 
site reactions and radiation protection for the clinical personnel. Injection site reactions with erythema, 
pain and swelling (all Grade 1 or 2) were observed in only 1.2% of patients (see SmPC section 4.8).  
Overall, drug-related adverse events reported were manageable during the study.  
Acute toxicity is deemed favourable in comparison to cytostatic drugs like docetaxel, which is also used in 
the target population. It was clarified that supportive therapy with blood components and growth factors 
was balanced between the groups.  
The development of secondary malignancy, in particular osteosarcoma, and diseases of the 
hematopoietic tissues, such as myelodysplasia, aplastic anaemia, and myeloid leukaemias are known 
long-term risks during treatment with alpha-particle emitter radium-224 as a pharmacological class 
effect. A similar alpha particle emitter product (radium-224) was licensed for treatment of juvenile 
ankylosing spondylitis in Germany until 2000, when it was withdrawn from the market due to the 
long-term safety concern. At that time a cohort study found that after a mean follow-up time of 26 years 
(n=1006) in the exposed group or 25 years (n=1072) in a control group, 19 cases of leukaemia were 
observed in the exposure group (vs. 6.8 cases expected<0.001) compared to 12 cases of leukaemia in 
the control group (vs. 7.5 cases expected). The leukaemia developed after a latency time between 15 to 
33 years. Insofar, this safety concern has not the same relevance in the target population of patients with 
castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases, since the life-expectancy of these 
patients is much shorter. No case of haematologic malignancy occurred in the clinical development 
programme and also no case of osteosarcoma was observed. In total, 16 cases of other primary cancers 
were reported during the clinical development programme (12 of them in the pivotal BC1-06 in the 
updated analysis). However, biodistribution as well as the latency period of radiation-induced 
malignancies (solid tumours) argue against a strong evidence of causality. Missing information on 
secondary malignancies is included in the RMP and a warning on secondary malignancies is included in the 
SmPC.  
Patients with evidence of compromised bone marrow reserve e.g. following prior cytotoxic chemotherapy 
and/or radiation treatment (EBRT) or prostate cancer patients with advanced diffuse infiltration of the 
bone (EOD4; “superscan”) should be treated with caution. An increased incidence of haematological 
adverse reactions such as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was observed in these patients during the 
phase III study (see SmPC section 4.4). 
The efficacy and safety of cytotoxic chemotherapy performed after treatment with Xofigo has not been 
established. The limited available data indicates that patients receiving chemotherapy after Xofigo had a 
similar haematological profile compared to patients receiving chemotherapy after placebo (see SmPC 
section 4.4).  
Because of potential effects on spermatogenesis associated with radiation, men should be advised to use 
effective contraceptive methods during and up to 6 months after treatment with Xofigo. 
Xofigo is not indicated in women. Xofigo is not to be used in women who are, or may be, pregnant or 
breast-feeding. 
Assessment report

There are no human data on the effect of Xofigo on fertility. Based on studies in animals, there is a 
potential risk that radiation from Xofigo could cause adverse effects on fertility.  Male patients should seek 
advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment. 
Relevant restrictions of study population as well as remaining uncertainties regarding the product’s safety 
profile are adequately reflected in the product information and included in the RMP, respectively.  
For all potential risks, routine and enhanced pharmacovigilance activities as well as active surveillance are 
being and will be conducted. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, radium-223 has an acute toxicity profile which is deemed as relatively favourable. Only 
drug-related adverse events as thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and diarrhoea and decreased appetite 
occurred more often in the radiun-223 group. 
Moreover, drug-related adverse events were obviously manageable and of lower intensity than those 
associated with the use of cytostatic drugs (e.g. docetaxel) also used in the target population. 
Long-term risks of secondary malignancies (osteosarcoma, haematological disorders) are sufficiently 
characterised, but no events were reported during the clinical development. As overall frequency of 
secondary malignancies was very low, the study population is not large enough to clarify these issues 
adequately. Further exploration is included in the RMP and a warning regarding the possibility of 
secondary malignancies is included in the product information. In general, biodistribution of radium-223 
chloride and latency times known for radium products seems to exclude a clinical relevant risk for the 
CRPC target population at present, since this advanced cancer population has a limited life-expectancy, 
which seems not to overlap with the reported latency times.

Warning and Precautions 
Bone marrow suppression, notably thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, leukopenia and pancytopenia, has been reported in 
patients treated with Xofigo (see section ‘Undesirable effects’). 
Therefore, haematological evaluation of patients must be 
performed at baseline and prior to every dose of Xofigo. Before the 
first administration, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be 
≥1.5 x 10^9/L, the platelet count ≥100 x 10^9/L and haemoglobin 
≥10.0 g/dL. Before subsequent administrations the ANC should be 
≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L and the platelet count ≥50 x 10^9/L. In case there 
is no recovery to these values within 6 weeks after the last 
administration of Xofigo despite receiving standard of care, further 
treatment with Xofigo should only be continued after a careful 
benefit/risk evaluation. 
Patients with evidence of compromised bone marrow reserve e.g. 
following prior cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment 
(EBRT) or prostate cancer patients with advanced diffuse 
infiltration of the bone (EOD4; “superscan”) should be treated with 
caution. 
Thrombocytopenia is listed as a very common adverse drug 
reaction (ADR), and neutropenia, pancytopenia and leukopenia are 
listed as common ADRs in Section 4.8 Undesirables effects in the 
SmPC.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In the single pivotal study in patients with symptomatic bone metastases from castration-resistant 
prostate cancer without visceral metastases overall survival was longer in the radium-223 group by 2.8 
months during the pre-specified interim analysis (HR 0.695, 95% CI 0.552-0.875, p=0.00185). The 
results were consistent at an updated OS analysis performed with later cut-off, with a total difference of 
3.6 months in favour of radium-223(HR 0.695, 95% CI 0.581-0.832, p=0.00007). Treatment effect on 
OS was robust after adjustment for stratification factors and was consistently favourable across all 
subgroups. 
The beneficial effect on survival was supported by the secondary endpoints. Overall, treatment of patients 
with radium-223 delayed and in some aspects also reduced the occurrence of unfavourable events. The 
composite endpoint symptomatic skeletal events favoured the radium-223 group with the first SRE 
occurring 5.8 months later (HR 0.658, 95% CI 0.552-0.830, p=0.00037). The most frequent component 
of SRE was external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), which in itself was supporting the palliative effect of 
radium-223. There was a clear effect in terms of time to total ALP progression (7.4 vs. 3.8 months, HR 
0.167, 95% CI 0.129-0.217, p<00001), response (e.g. confirmed 50% reduction: 27.2% vs. 0% in the 
updated analysis) and normalisation at week 12 (34% vs. 1.4%) all in favour of the radium-223 group. 
The effect on PSA as a marker of tumour progression showed only a marginal effect. Median time to PSA 
progression paralleled treatment (3.6 vs. 3.4 months, i.e. mid-treatment) and confirmed reductions in 
PSA by 50% occur in only 5% of patients in the radium-223 group compared to less than 2% in the 
placebo group. The rather limited effect on PSA was in line with the presumed mode of action, i.e. 
cytotoxic radiation on a thin peripheral part of bone metastases. Support for a palliative effect of 
radium-223 was derived from the following further secondary endpoints such as time-to-further 
anticancer treatment, and (time-to) other radionuclides or marked deterioration of performance status.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The imbalance (8% absolute) with respect to non-prostate-cancer related deaths in the placebo group in 
the pivotal trial clearly in favour of the Xofigo treatment group appeared to contribute to the increasing 
difference in overall survival in the updated analysis. It remains currently unclear whether or to what 
extent this might reflect an unusual and not understood beneficial treatment effect on putatively not 
cancer-related death (i.e. difficulties to distinguish disease-related from not disease related death) or  
more likely  whether the difference in non-prostate-cancer related deaths was a consequence of an 
imbalanced distribution of disease stages at randomisation (i.e. more patients with less advanced disease 
in the Xofigo group).  Heterogeneity in baseline characteristics is expected due to the subjective nature of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 80/86 
 
 
 
 
 
the definition of eligibility for docetaxel treatment with unknown distribution between study arms. Best 
standard of care was an oncologist’s choice with overall acceptable choice of palliative treatment regimen. 
No common back-bone treatment was used. Of note, there is potential impact of co-medication on 
endpoints such as PSA response or symptomatic skeletal events. Imbalances in co-medication over the 
study period, especially after the treatment phase, increase the uncertainty regarding the magnitude or 
the maintenance of the beneficial effect with respect to SREs. In view of selection processes in the trial, 
it is difficult to differentiate these confounders from a true treatment effect. However, the possible impact 
of these factors does not put the OS results into question, in view of the large treatment effect. 
Furthermore, the exploratory analyses of survival adjusted for important prognostic factors showed a 
consistent treatment effect. Thus, important bias due to imbalances in prognostic factors is considered 
unlikely. The additional analyses provide sufficient reassurance about a robust beneficial effect on overall 
survival with some remaining uncertainty regarding the exact quantification. 
The pivotal study was the first study of a bone-targeted agent resulting in a prolongation of survival. 
Radium-223 forms complexes with the bone mineral hydroxyapatite, which is enriched in areas of bone 
turnover, e.g. bone metastases and releases cytotoxic radiation to adjacent cells. While the mode of 
action on bone metastasis is plausible and a delay in symptomatic SRE is clearly demonstrated, the exact 
mechanism of action of prolonging overall survival in the absence of a demonstrated effect on PFS/TTP 
remains elusive. A direct anti-tumour effect has not been demonstrated. In addition to the endpoints 
overall survival and symptomatic skeletal events, patients were only followed by serum markers, which 
were measured at the local laboratories, potentially introducing significant variability. Serum markers do 
not represent a clinical benefit experienced by patients. Radiographic assessments in order to ascertain 
disease progression, either in bone or in extra-osseous tissues, were not collected. In any case, despite 
the uncertainties about the exact mechanism of action, this does not put the OS results into question in 
view of the statistically significant and clinically relevant effect observed. 
The endpoint time to symptomatic skeletal events was dominated by the time to first EBRT with the 
highest incidence in all patients. The impact on the other skeletal-related events was associated with a 
higher degree of uncertainty in view of the low event rate. Competing risks may have played a role 
especially for late-occurring events.  An impact of co-medication (such as steroids or bisphosphonates) on 
symptomatic skeletal events could not be entirely ruled out. It is unlikely, however, that the entire 
magnitude of delay of skeletal-related events is due to baseline imbalances.  Thus, the effect on 
symptomatic skeletal events is overall considered supportive of the effect on OS. 
There was an excess of use of bisphosphonates reported in the experimental arm during the follow-up 
phase, maybe contributing to the maintenance of the beneficial effect. An increase in the time until the 
need for other cancer treatments was observed with Xofigo (16.2 months vs. 13.5 months). Limited 
survival data after chemotherapy were indicative of neither a benefit nor a disadvantage for patients 
having received radium-223 previously. The effect of post-progression treatments is generally difficult to 
ascertain. Regardless of such effect, this does not put the OS results into question in view of the 
statistically significant and clinically relevant effect observed. 
The effect on quality of life was marginal and results were not consistent between the pivotal trial and 
supportive studies. Uncertainty remained also with respect to the maintenance of the palliative effect of 
radium-223 after end-of-treatment. Pain and performance status seemed to deteriorate quickly after end 
of treatment. Compliance with questionnaires on quality of life became critically low after the end of 
treatment.  However, even without a demonstrated positive effect on this secondary endpoint, the 
efficacy can be considered established. 
Finally, at the time when the pivotal study was started, a placebo controlled trial could be regarded as 
acceptable, when overall survival was the primary endpoint. During the conduct of the pivotal clinical trial 
of radium-223, only docetaxel was authorised as first-line treatment of metastatic CRPC based on a 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 81/86 
 
 
 
 
prolongation of survival by 2-3 months at the cost of significant toxicity. The pivotal study for this 
application was an add-on to best standard of care for patients not eligible for or not willing to receive 
docetaxel. Almost 60% of patients had already received docetaxel. Nowadays several new drugs were 
authorised and it becomes difficult to put the life-prolonging effect of a bone-specific agent into 
perspective. Although the efficacy of radium-233 has been established, there is no head-to-head 
comparison that would show how radium-223 compares to products for systemic treatment of prostate 
cancer or to the effect of other bone-targeted radionuclides.   
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Radium-223 has relatively mild acute haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity. Furthermore long- 
term risks are known pharmacological class effects in the form of an increase rate of secondary 
malignancies. 
With respect to drug-related adverse events the following specific TEAEs were identified and observed 
with a notably higher frequency in the active group than in the placebo group: Diarrhoea (25.2% versus 
15.0%), thrombocytopenia (11.5% versus 5.6%) and neutropenia (5.0% versus 1.0%). 
While diarrhoea may reflect direct radiation effect on the intestine surface cells during excretion, 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and lymphocytopenia as well as anaemia may be caused by radiation 
effect on the bone marrow. Most of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting adverse events were of Grade 1 or 2. 
Higher-grade drug related events were mainly observed with thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and 
anaemia. Most of those patients were pre-treated with docetaxel and/or EBRT, which may have 
contributed to the SAE. However, higher frequencies for thrombocytopenia and neutropenia/leukopenia 
did not result in an increased rate of haemorrhages or infections, which indicates that acute toxicity is 
manageable in clinical practice. 
Patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis were excluded from the pivotal study. This is currently 
mentioned in a special warning. Due to the local radiation during faecal excretion the risk for complication 
in inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g. toxic megacolon and sepsis) seems high. Appropriate warnings have 
been included in the SmPC and PL and the issue has been adequately addressed in the RMP. 
Bone radiation with radium-223 may increase the general risk for osteonecrosis; in particular in 
combination with bisphosphonate treatment the risk for osteonecrosis of jaw (ONJ) the risk may increase. 
In prostate cancer patients treated with zoledronic acid for bone metastases the rate for development of 
ONJ is about 1 %. In Study BC1-06, the incidence rate of osteonecrosis was higher in the radium-223 
chloride group, (0.67%), compared to (0.33%) in the placebo group. However, data were considered 
inconclusive due to the overall limited low event rate and relatively small study population for an event of 
such frequency. A warning is included in the SmPC aiming to clarify that radium-223 chloride may 
increase the rate of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in particular in combination with zoledronic acid and 
previous cytostatic treatment.  
Injection site reactions with erythema, pain and swelling (all Grade 1 or 2) were infrequent and are not a 
matter of particular concern due to concomitant risk from the injection procedure itself and acceptable 
local tolerability results for the drug. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The overall safety profile of radium-223 until end-of-treatment seemed to be in favour of the active 
treatment compared to placebo. Rates of TEAES, SAEs, discontinuations due to TEAEs and mortality were 
consistently lower in the radium-223-group. This finding was deemed implausible in an add-on study and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 82/86 
 
 
 
 
indicative of imbalances between study arms, unless unknown indirect effects of the treatment or an 
inadequate differentiation between disease-related and not disease-related events would be presumed. 
Due to imbalances at baseline, the rate of all safety events might have been higher in the radium-223 
group than currently observed. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that such imbalances would significantly 
change the observed toxicity profile. The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise 
the risks of the product in the proposed indication.  
Safety and efficacy of concomitant cytostatic chemotherapy on top on radium 223 chloride has not been 
established. Data on safety in patients receiving chemotherapy after treatment with radium-therapy, in 
patients with concomitant EBRT to bone, in patients with concomitant EBRT to prostate, and safety in 
repeated use are limited or not available (see SmPC section 4.4).  
In total, 16 cases of other primary cancers were reported during the clinical development programme (12 
of them in the pivotal BC1-06 in the updated analysis). However, biodistribution as well as the latency 
period of radiation-induced malignancies (solid tumours) argue against a strong evidence of causality. 
Missing information on secondary malignancies is included in the RMP and a warning on secondary 
malignancies is included in the SmPC.  
Cases of retinal detachment were observed only in dogs during the non-clinical studies, but not in the 
investigated target population. Due to the limited number of patients the overall relevance of this result 
remains inconclusive, but will be monitored in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Radium-223 is the first bone targeted therapy which demonstrated a survival benefit (3.6 months) over 
placebo to date. This magnitude is regarded as clinically meaningful in advanced cancer stages. Although 
uncertainties with regard to baseline imbalances and possible confounding effects of co-medication 
remain, important bias seems unlikely.  
The effect on SRE is considered clinically relevant: less patients in the radium-223 group experienced a 
SRE and time to first SRE was clinically significantly longer with 6 months difference. All aspects of the 
composite endpoint SRE are referring to clinically relevant issues and there is a consistent effect in three 
of four aspects of the composite endpoint, with EBRT being the dominant component. 
The difference in symptoms, e. g. with respect to pain as also demonstrated by the delay SRE, contributes 
strongly to the immediate benefits for the patient. 
In prostate cancer non-prostate-cancer deaths are a relevant competing risk. Due to considerable 
imbalances in non-prostate-cancer related deaths which can impact the size of the benefit uncertainties 
remain. A contribution of baseline imbalances or imbalances in co-medication on the magnitude of the 
effect could not be entirely ruled out.  However, based on exploratory analyses adjusted for important 
prognostic factors, an important bias seems unlikely. 
Overall, radium-223 chloride had an acute toxicity profile which was relatively favourable in comparison 
with the placebo results. Drug-related adverse events (gastrointestinal and haematological ADRS) were 
obviously manageable and of lower intensity than those associated with the use of cytostatic alternatives 
(e.g. docetaxel). Long-term risks as secondary malignancies are not of major concern taking into account 
the life expectancy of the target population of advanced prostate cancer.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/578779/2013  
Page 83/86 
 
 
 
 
Benefit-risk balance 
The observed improvement in overall survival together with the observed effect on symptomatic skeletal 
events is supported by secondary endpoints, e.g. the biomarker ALP reflecting the activity of bone 
disease. The clinical benefit in terms of survival and palliation for bone metastases has clearly been 
shown. 
In terms of safety profile, the data shown a low acute toxicity (better than most pharmacological 
anti-cancer therapies) of the product and in addition, although there is a long-term risk for secondary 
malignancies this is not of major concern taking into account the life expectancy of the target population 
of advanced prostate cancer. The mild to moderate haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity was 
manageable. 
Overall, the benefits overweigh the risks in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with 
symptomatic bone metastases.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Radium-223 is a novel alpha particle emitter, meant for the treatment of bone metastases of HRPC, 
bearing the favourable characteristics of having a short ionisation path length that may reduce toxicity to 
tumour adjacent healthy tissues.  
Radium-223 is the first bone target therapy which demonstrated a survival benefit (3.6 months) over 
placebo. This magnitude is regarded as clinically meaningful in advanced cancer stages. The safety profile 
of radium-223 is considered sufficiently characterised, the main TAEs being haematological toxicity and 
gastrointestinal disorders, both manageable and reversible.  
From a clinical perspective the benefit in terms of SRE delay and the benefit in OS -even in light of the 
uncertainties regarding the size of the effect that is truly due to treatment with radium-223- are 
considered to outweigh the safety risks.

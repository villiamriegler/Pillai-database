are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, Annex 
IXIARO is an inactivated JE vaccine adsorbed to aluminium 
II and PL 
hydroxide (alum). 
Page 14/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is the only vaccine indicated for active immunisation 
against Japanese encephalitis that is available in Europe 
and in the US. There is no specific (causally acting) therapy 
available for Japanese encephalitis infection.  
IXIARO has an established positive benefit risk profile 
shown both in clinical trials (high seroconversion rates, 
significant lack of serious adverse reactions) as well as in 
post-marketing (no confirmed cases of vaccination failure, 
limited number of serious reactions not affecting the safety 
profile). 
However, the post-marketing exposure of IXIARO to 
pediatric population is very small to date. This limited 
exposure, together with fewer than 2,000 pediatric subjects 
exposed in clinical trials, form a safety database that is too 
small to characterize rare or very rare adverse events, 
including the important identified and potential risks 
mentioned in the Risk Management Plan.  Hence, the CHMP 
recommends one additional 5-year renewal of the 
Marketing Authorisation.

Report: Ixiaro-H-963-II-0039-G-VAR-en 
and PL 
The MAH proposed the extension of indication of 
Ixiaro to the paediatric segment (2 months of age 
and older) in line with approved PIP EMEA -000559-
PIP01-09-M03. Modification of syringe label to 
include "half dose mark" for administration of a 0.25 
ml nominal dose for the paediatric sub-segment 2 
months to below 3 years of age in line with the 
aforementioned PIP. The latter is grouped with the 
indication extension as direct result of the proposed 
extension. The Package Leaflet and Labelling were 
proposed to be updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the PI is being brought in line with the 
latest QRD template version 8.2.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC 
18/02/2010

SmPC, Annex 
The data demonstrate that for the antibody response 
based on the 24 and 36 months immunogenicity and 
II and PL 
following primary immunisation regimen of 2x 6µg is long-
safety data from studies IC51-303, -305, and -311 in 
lasting and clearly boosterable after 11 or 23 months. This 
line with follow-up measures 016 and 018. The PL 
was updated accordingly. The MAH also took this 
opportunity to add the approved EU numbers in 
section 8 of the SPC and to amend the instructions 
for disposal in section 6.6 of the SPC. Furthermore, 
the MAH took this opportunity to correct a minor 
spelling mistake in the address of the manufacturer 
in Annex II and to update the European Medicines 
Agency web site address. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
is further corroborated by immunogenicity data on a 
booster dose given 15 months after the primary 
immunisation. Therefore, subjects with a continuously high 
risk of exposure to Japanese encephalitis should receive a 
booster dose within a time interval of 1 to 2 years after the 
primary immunisation series to ensure optimal protection.  
Moreover the data indicate that subjects, who received only 
a single dose of 1x 6µg respond effectively to a booster 
dose given 11 months after the first dose. This information 
is deemed to be important for travellers which are in urgent 
need to be at least partly protected within a short time 
frame and are not able to complete the primary 
immunisation series (e.g. last minute travellers). In 
addition the list of adverse events was updated to reflect 
the safety data from the studies submitted.

a consequence of the FUMS 0016 (24 months reports 
from clinical studies IC51-303 and IC51-305) and to 
reflect updated processes. The Risk Management 
Plan (RMP) has also been updated to version 1.4. 
Consequently, Annex II has been updated with the 
new version numbers of the agreed DDPS and RMP. 
Update of DDPS (Pharmacovigilance) 
and Risk Management Plan (RMP) have been updated. The 
DDPS has been amended in its structure and organisation, 
inclusion of trials with long-term observations and post-
marketing surveillance program, update on the processing

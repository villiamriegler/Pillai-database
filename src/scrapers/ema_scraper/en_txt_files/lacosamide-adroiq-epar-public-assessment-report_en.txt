2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application concerns a generic medicinal product referring to the centrally authorised product 
Vimpat, which was first authorised in the European Union on 29 August 2008. 
The active substance is lacosamide, an amino acid derivate with anticonvulsive activity. Although its 
mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, lacosamide has shown to selectively enhance slow 
inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of hyper-excitable neuronal 
membranes.  
The proposed indications for Lacosamide Adroiq are the same as for the reference product: indication 
as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in 
adults, adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy, as adjunctive therapy for the 
treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents 
and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy, and as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary 
generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with 
idiopathic generalised epilepsy. 
The reference product Vimpat is available as tablets (50mg, 100mg, 150mg, and 200mg), solution for 
infusion (10mg/mL), and syrup (10mg/mL). Treatment is initiated at a starting dose of 50 mg twice a 
day which is titrated in weekly increments to a maximum maintenance dose of 200 mg twice a day 
for adjunctive treatment and 300 mg twice a day for monotherapy. In case of monotherapy, 
treatment can also be initiated at a starting dose of 100 mg twice a day. Vimpat may be taken with 
or without food. 
The application for Lacosamide Adroiq concerns the solution for infusion (10mg/mL) formulation. 
Lacosamide Adroiq 10mg/mL solution for infusion contains the same active ingredient in the same 
concentration as Vimpat solution for infusion (10mg/mL), and Lacosamide Adroiq 10mg/mL solution 
for infusion is applied for the same indications, strength, and route of administration as the reference 
product Vimpat. Therefore, in accordance with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), no bioequivalence study was submitted to support the application. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as solution for infusion containing 10 mg/mL of lacosamide as active 
substance.  
Assessment report  
EMA/216528/2023

Other ingredients are water for injections, sodium chloride, and hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment). 
The product is available in type I glass vial with a bromobutyl rubber closure with aluminium flip off 
seals as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance is (2R)-2-Acetamido-N-benzyl-3-methoxypropanamide 
corresponding to the molecular formula C13H18N2O3. It has a relative molecular weight of 250.3 and the 
following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated solid-state properties confirmed by 
suitable analytical techniques. 
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic white or almost white or light-yellow powder sparingly 
soluble in water, freely soluble in methanol, practically insoluble in heptane.  
Lacosamide contains one chiral centre. Hence it exhibits stereoisomerism.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by one manufacturer. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Detailed discussion on actual and potential impurities that are likely to arise during the synthesis have 
been provided and the mechanisms utilised for their control are presented.  
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in antistatic polyethylene bags. This is placed inside an outer black 
polythene bag. Displace the air completely from inner poly bag and tie inner and outer poly bag with a 
plastic strap. This in turn is enclosed in a HM-HDPE drum and tightly closed which complies with the EC 
directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended.

Specification 
The active substance specification used by the finished product manufacturer includes tests for 
appearance (visual), identification (FTIR/Infrared absorption spectroscopy, HPLC), solubility (Ph. Eur.), 
appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash / residue of ignition (Ph. 
Eur.), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 
residual solvents (GC), dimethyl sulfate content (GCMS), bacterial endotoxins (Ph, Eur.), microbial 
enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
Proposed  specification  for  lacosamide  is  in  line  with  the  Ph.  Eur.  monograph.  Additional  limits  set  for 
residual solvents are in line with ICH Q3C and for dimethyl sulfate with ICH M7.  
The  methods  used  for  the  control  of  the  active  substance  are  the  same  as  described  in  the  Ph.  Eur. 
monograph for lacosamide, with exception of the method for related substances and assay.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of two commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 
65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
All results under long term and accelerated conditions are within proposed limits without significant 
changes between the testing points. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months stored below 
30°C in the proposed container.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as clear, colourless solution free from visible particles.The generic 
medicinal product has identical qualitative and quantitative composition of the active substance and 
excipients and the same pharmaceutical form and strength as the reference product Vimpat 10 mg/ml 
solution for infusion. 
The formulation composition is similar to that of the reference medicinal product. Since the finished 
product is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the reference medicinal product, the excipients can 
be considered to be compatible. Additionally, the stability testing of the finished product confirms the 
compatibility of the excipients. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their 
quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/216528/2023  
Page 9/16 
 
 
 
The aim of the formulation development is to develop a generic medicinal product equivalent to the 
reference medicinal product, to identify and mitigate the risks during the formulation design scale up 
and to provide control strategy for the manufacturing 
No bioequivalence studies have been performed since the product is to be administered as an aqueous 
intravenous solution containing identical active substance’s concentration as the originator and both 
products contain the same excipients’ quantity, in accordance with the Guideline on the investigation of 
bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98), it is acceptable to exempt bioequivalence studies.  
During the manufacturing development, the effect of several Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) were 
studied to understand their impact on Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) of the finished product. 
The primary packaging is type I glass vial with a bromobutyl rubber closure with aluminum flip off seals. 
The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  5  main  steps  as  outlined  dispensing,  compounding,  filtration, 
filling, terminal sterilization, visual inspection, and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process since it includes terminal sterilisation with the reference Ph. Eur. cycle.  
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form:  appearance  (visual),  identification  (HPLC,  HPLC/PDA-UV),  pH  (Ph.  Eur.),  clarity  of  solution  (Ph. 
Eur.),  colour  of  solution  (Ph.  Eur.),  osmolality  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substances  (HPLC), 
container  content  for  injections/extractable  volume  (Ph.  Eur),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.), 
visible particles (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter-sub-visible particles (by light obscuration method (Method 
1 Test 1.B), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), injections and implanted drug products 
(Parenteral)-product quality test (Ph. Eur.), container closure integrity test (CCIT) (Ph. Eur.), residual 
solvents (Ph. Eur.), and elemental impurities. 
The provided specification for the finished product includes adequate tests to control the quality of the 
product. The set specification limits are reasonable and the specified parameters for the finished product 
are justified in general. The proposed limits for impurities are considered acceptable as they are in line 
with the Ph. Eur. monograph for Lacosamide infusion. 
Risk  assessment  on  the  elemental  impurities  according  to  ICH  Q3D  infusion  was  performed.  The 
assessment examined the sources of elemental impurities and identified several components that had 
the potential to transfer elemental impurities into finished product. The results obtained show that the 
content of elemental impurities are below the control threshold. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
Assessment report

726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided,  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under long 
term conditions (25°C / 60% RH), and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal product are identical 
to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, identification, pH, osmolality, clarity of solution, colour of solution, 
osmolality, assay, related substances, container content for injection, visible particles, particle matter-
sub-visible, bacterial endotoxins, sterility, and injections and implanted drug product.  
All the results at long-term storage condition of and at accelerated storage condition were found to be 
well within the limits as per finished product shelf-life specifications. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. No significant change is observed during photo stability study for 
the finished product samples outside immediate pack. All the results were found to be well within the 
limits. It is concluded that the product is not light sensitive.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years do not store above 25°C as stated 
in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its 
manufacturing process. However, no design space was claimed for the manufacturing process of the 
finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Lacosamide Adroiq manufactured by Extrovis EU Ltd. is considered unlikely to result in 
any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all lacosamide containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance.  
In view of data showing an increase of lacosamide consumption over the past years, in accordance 
with the respective EMA guideline, the applicant agreed to perform a detailed environmental risk 
assessment (Phase I) as a post-authorisation commitment. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
justifies that there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology data. This is agreed. 
The impurity profile of Lacosamide Adroiq 10 mg/mL solution for infusion is discussed and acceptable, 
thus, additional toxicology studies to qualify the impurity profile of the drug product are not required. 
In view of data showing an increase of lacosamide consumption over the past years, in accordance 
with the respective EMA guideline, the applicant will provide a detailed environmental risk assessment 
(Phase I) as a post-authorisation measure. 
All non-clinical information has been adequately reflected in the SmPC in line with the reference

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for solution for infusion containing 10 mg/ml lacosamide. Lacosamide Adroiq 
contains the same active substance as the reference product Vimpat and is intended for parenteral 
administration. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of lacosamide based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the 
SmPC of the reference product. 
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) is of particular relevance.  
GCP aspect 
No new clinical data have been presented. 
Exemption 
The EMA Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 is of relevance for 
the  clinical  assessment.  Bioequivalence  studies  are  generally  not  required  if  the  test  product  is  to  be 
administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently 
approved product.  
Lacosamide Adroiq 10 mg/ml, solution for infusion, contains the same active ingredient in the same 
concentration as the reference product Vimpat and for use in the same indication, strength, and route 
of administration as the reference medicinal product. Therefore, according to the guideline, a 
bioequivalence study is not considered necessary for the above-mentioned product 
2.4.1.1.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The clinical overview on the clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety is adequate.  
In accordance with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence, no bioequivalence study was 
submitted to support the application. 
Lacosamide Adroiq is considered essentially similar to Vimpat 10 mg/l solution for infusion 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on scientific literature, a clinical overview has been provided. The overview justifies why there is 
no need to generate additional clinical data. The clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC 
of the reference product. 
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further clinical studies are required.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of lacosamide solution for infusion. The reference product 
Vimpat is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without 
secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy. 
Vimpat is indicated as adjunctive therapy   
• 
• 
in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, 
adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy 
in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults, adolescents and children 
from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy.  
No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
No bioequivalence studies have been provided, which is acceptable and in line with the Guideline on 
the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr**): bioequivalence studies 
are generally not required for a parenteral solution, and all conditions are fulfilled. Therefore, the proof 
of therapeutic equivalence with the reference medicinal product is based on the proof of 
pharmaceutical equivalence.   
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Lacosamide Adroiq is favourable in the following indication: 
Lacosamide Adroiq is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or 
without secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy. 
Lacosamide Adroiq is indicated as adjunctive therapy  
• 
• 
in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, 
adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy. 
in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults, adolescents and children 
from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalised epilepsy.

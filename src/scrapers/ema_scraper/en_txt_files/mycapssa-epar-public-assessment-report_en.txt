1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant FGK Representative Service GmbH submitted on 28 June 2021 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Mycapssa, through the 
centralised procedure under Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 10 December 2020. 
The application concerns a hybrid medicinal product as defined in Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and refers to a reference product, as defined in Article 10 (2)(a) of Directive 2001/83/EC, for which a 
marketing authorisation is or has been granted in a Member State on the basis of a complete dossier in 
accordance with Article 8(3). 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Mycapssa as an orphan medicinal product in 
the approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan 
maintenance assessment report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website:

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The legal basis of MAA for Mycapssa is Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, a so-called “hybrid” 
application to the reference medicinal product sc Sandostatin IR (MA number 29423.00-03.00), which 
was first approved in the European Union on 06 October 1995. The applicant set the main objective of 
the Mycapssa development to change the route of administration in order to address the unmet 
medical need of an efficacious oral octreotide treatment. As a consequence, full quality and pivotal 
clinical development was foreseen as well as partially derogated non-clinical development. 
For quality development, the pharmaceutical form needed to be adjusted to allow oral administration 
and the strength had to be adjusted to reach comparable systemic exposure with oral Mycapssa 
therapy as with the subcutaneous reference medicinal product. The applicant has developed octreotide 
capsules, a new formulation of octreotide for oral delivery. The enteric-coated capsule is filled with an 
oily suspension of unmodified octreotide formulated with transient permeability enhancer (TPE®) 
excipients, a proprietary mixture that permits oral administration. The enteric coating allows the intact 
capsule to pass through the stomach and disintegrate when it reaches the higher pH of the small 
intestine.  The TPE excipients facilitate local transit across the intestinal wall and allows the intact 
peptide (i.e., octreotide) to be absorbed into the systemic circulation. 
For non-clinical development, three main non-clinical studies were conducted (safety pharmacology of 
the formulation, PK studies in vivo and comparative toxicology studies of 9 months duration). 
For clinical development, this hybrid application is not based on bioequivalence between Mycapssa and 
the reference medicinal product Sandostatin, but on non-clinical and clinical data supporting the safety 
and efficacy of the new route of administration, pharmaceutical form, and strength. In total 11 
(eleven) clinical studies were conducted with the same intent, addressing PK in healthy volunteers 
(HV), in patients with liver and renal impairments and 8 interaction studies (drug-food and DDI) in HV. 
2.2.  Disease or condition 
The applicant was applying for the following indication:  
“MYCAPSSA is indicated for long-term maintenance treatment in patients with acromegaly who have 
responded to and tolerated treatment with somatostatin analogues.”  
This indication is part of the indication for treatment of acromegaly (ACM) approved for Sandostatin s/c 
that is: “Symptomatic control and reduction of growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1 plasma levels in 
patients with acromegaly who are inadequately controlled by surgery or radiotherapy. Sandostatin is 
also indicated for acromegalic patients unfit or unwilling to undergo surgery, or in the interim period 
until radiotherapy becomes fully effective.”  
In addition to acromegaly, Sandostatin is indicated also for Gastro-entero-pancreatic endocrine 
tumours, Bleeding gastro-oesophageal varices, Treatment of TSH-secreting pituitary adenomas. These 
other indications are not a subject to this application.  
The CHMP approved the following indication: 
“Mycapssa is indicated for maintenance treatment in adult patients with acromegaly who have 
responded to and tolerated treatment with somatostatin analogues.”

Page 10/130 
 
 
 
2.3.  Epidemiology  
The annual incidence of acromegaly is 3 to 5 cases per million individuals, and the estimated 
prevalence is 40 to 70 cases per million, with men and women equally affected. Owing to its insidious 
onset it is often diagnosed late (4 to more than 10 years after onset), at an average age of about 40 
years 
2.4.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
At diagnosis, patients generally exhibit coarsened facial features, exaggerated growth of hands and 
feet, and soft tissue hypertrophy. The diagnosis of acromegaly requires demonstration of dysregulated 
and enhanced GH secretion or elevated IGF-1 levels, reflective of peripheral tissue exposure to 
tonically elevated GH concentrations. Acromegaly comorbidities occur especially with uncontrolled 
GH/IGF-1 hypersecretion, and most comorbidities are ameliorated by controlling GH/IGF-1 levels.  
2.5.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
Acromegaly, a serious and life-threatening rare disease usually caused by a growth hormone (GH)-
secreting pituitary adenoma, is an inexorable chronic condition with significant morbidity  
and mortality. Acromegaly mortality determinants include GH >2.5 ng/mL and elevated IGF-1, 
hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, requirement for glucocorticoid replacement, 
and prior pituitary radiation. 
Effective surgical, radiation, and medical strategies to improve comorbidity and mortality require 
control of GH/IGF-1. 
2.6.  Management 
Treatment options for acromegaly include surgical resection of the pituitary adenoma, radiotherapy, 
and drug therapy to reduce GH and IGF-1 levels to normal values. Transsphenoidal surgery has been 
recommended as the primary therapy in most patients. Use of a somatostatin receptor ligand (SRL) as 
primary therapy has been recommended for patients who cannot be cured by surgery, have extensive 
cavernous sinus invasion, do not have chiasmal compression, or are poor surgical candidates. 
Currently, there are 3 drug classes available for the treatment of acromegaly: SRLs or somatostatin 
analogues (SSAs; octreotide, lanreotide, and pasireotide), dopamine agonists (bromocriptine and 
cabergoline), and a GH receptor antagonist (pegvisomant). At present, SRLs are the most widely used 
drugs to control acromegaly. Current injectable therapies for acromegaly are suboptimal for multiple 
reasons. The injections are poorly tolerated. Patients experience long-term sequelae associated with 
their injection, including persistent pain (lasting days), nodules, haemorrhage, inflammation, and 
scarring. At an emotional level, anxiety, frustration, and loss of independence due to assistance 
required in receiving injections compounds the physical impact. Work time is lost in scheduling and 
traveling for injections, and from adverse events (AEs) associated with injections or symptom 
exacerbation towards the end of the injection interval. The medical literature, the EMA and US FDA and 
WHO post-marketing AE databases, and patient-reported outcome (PRO) studies all support these 
burdens of existing SRL injection treatment and the unmet medical need for safer, less burdensome 
treatment.

2.7.  About the product 
Mode of action. Octreotide is a synthetic octapeptide derivative of naturally occurring somatostatin 
with similar pharmacological effects, but with a considerably prolonged duration of action. It inhibits 
pathologically increased secretion of GH and of peptides and serotonin produced within the gastro-
entero-pancreatic (GEP) endocrine system. 
Pharmacological classification. Somatostatin and analogues, ATC code: H01CB02 
Mycapssa is presented in new dosage form: enteric-coated hard gelatin capsule, containing an oily 
suspension of octreotide acetate corresponding to 20 mg of the free peptide octreotide. 
Considering  non-clinical  development,  as  stated  by  the  applicant  with  respect  to  non-clinical  studies 
because  octreotide  capsules  are  administered  by  a  route  that  has  not  previously  been  approved  for 
octreotide  acetate,  a  series  of  primary  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  (PK),  and  repeat-dose 
toxicity studies were conducted to characterise the mode of action of the octreotide-TPE formulation, the 
oral bioavailability of octreotide after administration of octreotide capsules, and the safety of octreotide 
capsules. Since the combination of excipients in the TPE formulation is novel, the applicant also qualified 
the  excipients  in  octreotide  capsules  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies.  The  safety  of  the  individual 
excipients in octreotide capsules is also supported by published information and by their use in marketed 
pharmaceuticals. 
The applicant states that primary pharmacodynamic effects of the somatostatin analogue octreotide and 
its potential effects on safety pharmacology parameters have been established during development of 
sc Sandostatin IR. Additional primary pharmacodynamic (non-GLP) studies conducted by the applicant 
in  rats  have  characterised  the  enhancement  of  permeability  in  the  GI  tract  induced  by  the  TPE 
formulation. 
No identical compositions of to-be-marketed TPE (CH-906-4) formulations in octreotide test articles were 
used in all non-clinical studies. 
To quantify octreotide plasma concentrations in the battery of repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus 
monkeys  the  validated  liquid  chromatography-tandem  mass  spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  method  was 
used.  In  part  of  studies  used  LC-MS/MS  and  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  methods 
followed in-house validation. 
As PK studies, the applicant performed oral octreotide bioavailability evaluations in rats and monkeys. 
Different  test  article  application  approach  was  used  (bulk  formulation  via  intestinal  cannulas,  gavage 
compared with intrajejunal administration, administration of octreotide-TPE to the stomach, duodenum, 
jejunum, ileum, or colon, capsules in monkeys) in comparison with parenteral octreotide. 
Concerning toxicity evaluation, the  applicant relies in part on non-clinical data for sc Sandostatin and 
has  conducted  additional  toxicological  studies  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  to  demonstrate  the  safety  of 
octreotide capsules in comparison to sc Sandostatin IR and to qualify product-related impurities.

physico-chemical properties 
The active substance is a hygroscopic white to off white powder (it is characterised by needle shape 
particles) freely soluble in water pH 2.0, pH 4.0, pH 7.0, slightly soluble in water pH 10.0, soluble in 
AcOH and MeOH.  
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 17/130 
 
 
 
 
The active substance exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 10 chiral centres. The active 
substance has a specific optical rotation between -14.5° and -18.5°. Enantiomeric purity is controlled 
routinely by specific optical rotation. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for the active substance.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is supplied by two manufacturers. 
Octreotide acetate is synthesised using well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in polyethylene bag as direct packaging.  
General information and specifications of the plastic materials are provided. The release specification 
and compliance statement to the European Regulation 10/2011/EC, as amended, on plastic materials 
and articles intended to come into contact with food are submitted in the dossier. The confirmation of 
compliance to current Ph. Eur. requirements is presented.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual), identification (HPLC, 1H NMR), 
special  rotation  (Ph.  Eur.),  assay  (HPLC),  acetic  acid  content  (Ph.  Eur.),  related  compounds  (HPLC), 
water content (Ph. Eur.), microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.), and residual organic solvents (GC).  
The parameters tested are in line with the Ph. Eur. monograph for octreotide and do not need 
additional justification. The use of alternative method for content and related peptides related has been 
satisfactorily justified and supported by comparability study. 
Each specification parameter has been justified individually.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (3 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are 
within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions 
(-20ºC±5ºC) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (2-8ºC) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification, assay, water determination, related 
peptides, microbial tests, and bacteria; endotoxins tests. The analytical methods used were the same 
as for release and were stability indicating. 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 18/130 
 
 
 
The purity profile results remained within specifications at all intervals during long-term and 
accelerated conditions. No trends were observed. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. According to the 
obtained results, octreotide acetate powder is not photostable under the tested conditions. 
Results on stress conditions (alkaline, oxidation, sunlight solution, sunlight powder, acidic, heat 
solution, and humidity) were also provided on one batch. According to presented information 
octreotide active substance was found to be stable when stressed by heat, light and acid, minimal 
degradation was observed for alkaline conditions and oxidation stress (14% and 12% accordingly). 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers  is 
sufficiently stable.  
2.8.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a white, size 0 enteric-coated hard gelatin capsules. 
The finished product has been developed as a formulation to enable the oral delivery of the peptide 
which otherwise has limited oral bioavailability. The Transient Permeability Enhancer (TPE) system is a 
combination of excipients assembled in a proprietary process. 
The formulation objective was to develop an oral dosage form finished product. It was necessary to 
protect the oral dosage form during its passage through the acidic environment of the stomach and 
have the dosage form rapidly dissolve when it reached the intestines. An enteric coated capsule was 
the preferred oral dosage form among many which were considered. 
An extensive and systematic formulation development exercise led to an octreotide capsule final 
formulation and process which has been consistently used for the manufacture of clinical supply 
batches, toxicology supplies, and primary registration stability batches and is also the formulation 
which has been scaled up to commercial scale. This finished product formulation has demonstrated 
good stability and has the desired bioavailability as evaluated in animal and human studies. Octreotide 
capsules have consistently met specifications and are stable long term under cold chain conditions and 
at controlled room-temperature conditions throughout a 30-day in-use stability period. 
Stability data was generated with the commercial octreotide capsules formulation in aluminium-Aclar 
blisters. The stability data from these studies demonstrated acceptable compatibility of the active 
substance with the excipients at long-term storage conditions. A binary compatibility study was also 
carried out which demonstrated the product remained stable at the proposed long-term storage 
conditions. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
The manufacturing of octreotide capsules uses standard pharmaceutical unit operation and equipment. 
The process involves the proprietary preparation of the fill mass, filling into hard gelatin capsules, 
employing an automated encapsulation filling machine. Concurrently with encapsulation, the filled 
capsules are banded with a gelatin solution to seal the body and cap of the hard gelatin capsules. The 
dried banded capsules are then enteric coated and cured at room temperature. 
The primary packaging is polychlorotrifluoroethylene PCTFE/polyethylene (PE)/polyvinylchloride (PVC)-
aluminium blisters. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022

container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by two manufacturing sites.  
The manufacturing process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. It involves the 
proprietary combination of the excipients with the active, filling, into gelatine capsules, banding, enteric 
coating and blister packaging. 
During evaluation the CHMP considered as Major Objection (MO) that the proposed acceptance range 
for sodium caprylate assay in the intermediate was not acceptable. The applicant has introduced a limit  
for routine sodium caprylate testing in the release specification, what it is considered acceptable. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on 3 commercial 
scale  batches.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the manufacturing  process  is capable  of  producing  the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for 
this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life  specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), identification (HPLC-UV, HPLC/UV-DAD), assay (HPLC-UV), impurities (HPLC-
fluo),  uniformity  of  dosage  (Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.),  microbial  limits  (Ph.  Eur.),  and  sodium 
caprylate assay (HPLC-UV). 
The tests selected and the methods used to verify the identity, strength, purity, and quality of the 
finished product are consistent with those for delayed-release oral capsule drug products as per ICH 
Q6A. The specifications were developed using compendial and the ICH guidance, information from the 
active substance manufacturer, and finished product release and stability data. The proposed 
specification is considered adequately justified. 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested as MO) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based 
on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional 
control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for twenty-one batches that include six primary registration 
stability batches (precommercial scale) and fifteen commercial-scale batches confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 20/130 
 
 
 
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 6 commercial scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under 
long term conditions (2°C – 8°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (25ºC / 60% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical  to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, octreotide assay, impurities/degradation products, sodium 
caprylate content, and dissolution. Water content is performed for information only. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating.  
The stability data does not show any significant changes under long-term conditions. The 6-month 
accelerated data clearly show the need to keep the drug product refrigerated. Under accelerated 
conditions, there is significant degradation of the finished product by the 6-month test point. 
For convenience during the drug use period, and to allow storage of the blisters at room temperature 
for up to 1 month, an end-use study was included. No significant changes were observed in the 
parameters studied.   
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years and storage condition “store in a 
refrigerator (2 °C – 8 °C)” and “do not freeze” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. Valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the 
gelatine used in the manufacture is provided.  
2.8.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner.  
Two MOs that had been raised about the proposed acceptance range for sodium caprylate assay in the 
intermediate and the risk evaluation on the presence of nitrosamine impurities. Both were resolved by 
provision of additional information or justification. Overall, during the procedure, the information of the 
dossier has been updated and improved as requested. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.8.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.8.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.9.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.9.1.  Introduction 
Octreotide is the acetate salt of a cyclic octapeptide. It is long-acting and has pharmacologic properties 
mimicking those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Octreotide displays a high affinity for 
somatostatin receptor subtypes 2 and 5, effectively suppressing GH hypersecretion in up to ~60% of 
patients with acromegaly (Colao 2004; Chanson 2008; Melmed 2009a; Fleseriu 2014; Melmed 2014). 
Current somatostatin therapies (Sandostatin®, Sandostatin long-acting release (LAR), Somatuline® 
Autogel (lanreotide)) for acromegaly are to be injected  by intravenous, subcutaneous, deep 
subcutaneous or intramuscular route. There are currently no licenced oral formulations of somatostatin 
analogues, octreotide, lanreotide, or pasireotide. 
The applicant has developed octreotide capsules, a new formulation of octreotide for oral delivery. The 
enteric coated capsule is filled with an oily suspension of unmodified octreotide formulated with 
transient permeability enhancer (TPE®) excipients, a proprietary mixture that permits oral 
administration. The enteric coating allows the intact capsule to pass through the stomach and 
disintegrate when it reaches the higher pH of the small intestine to discharge octreotide capsules 
suspension. 
To support a hybrid MAA the applicant relies on nonclinical data for the EU-approved medicinal product 
Sandostatin® and on information in the published literature for sc Sandostatin IR. In addition, the 
applicant conducted 5 pharmacology studies (with rat), 7 pharmacokinetic studies (rat and monkey), 
and 6 toxicity studies, 2 of which bridged to the safety of sc Sandostatin IR (monkey). The safety of 
the excipients in octreotide capsules was evaluated in the 1-, 3-, and 9-month oral toxicology studies 
in cynomolgus monkeys. 
The dedicated studies conducted by the applicant focused on the following key areas and objectives: 
1. Enhancement of intestinal absorption of octreotide with the TPE formulation, including duration and 
extent of absorption. 
2. The pharmacokinetics of octreotide following oral dosing with octreotide capsules or octreotide-TPE, 
including the potential extent of liver sequestration. 
3. The safety of octreotide acetate and the TPE excipients, administered as octreotide capsules, on the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, cardiovascular system, and other major organs after chronic exposure. 
4. Establishment of a bridge in terms of exposure and safety with sc Sandostatin IR.

2.9.2.  Pharmacology 
2.9.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
As to the primary pharmacodynamics data of octreotide acetate, it is referred to the identical active 
substance of the EU-approved medicinal product sc Sandostatin IR, which mode of action is well 
established: inhibition of growth hormone (GH) secretion. The effects of octreotide were found to be 
similar to those of the natural hormone somatostatin. Octreotide displayed greater potency and 
selectivity for GH and glucagon suppression and a longer duration of action than the native hormone. 
As this application is a hybrid MAA according to Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC the approach to 
not conduct separate NC primary pharmacodynamics studies was considered acceptable. 
To increase octreotide acetate GI absorption the applicant developed a capsule formulation with a 
transient permeability enhancer (TPE®) using Medium Chain Fatty Acids salts (MCFAS). According to 
sources MCFAS exert their permeation effect mainly via the paracellular route by inducing tight 
junction (TJ) opening. The selection of the formulation excipients and their concentration in the final 
formulation was based on absorption of octreotide acetate in an animal model and desirable physico-
chemical properties supporting stability and manufacturability. During development of the octreotide 
capsule formulation, several combinations of the excipients were studied resulting in selection of the 
final TPE formulation components with the main component for enhancing GI permeation – sodium 
caprylate. Presented in the NC PD part studies focused on different compositions (classes) of TPE 
permeability-enhancing properties and action reversibility. Through the development process, in PD 
experiments conducted by the applicant, combinations of the TPE excipients (class CH-809, CH-811-1, 
CH-906-1, CH-906-2) differed from those chosen for final commercial formulation of Mycapssa 
capsules (class CH-906-4). 
In its own in vivo studies with rats the applicant focuses on the mode of action of TPE-induced 
permeability, pharmacokinetic properties and evaluation of the magnitude, duration, and long-term 
reproducibility of the effects of the TPE system on GI permeability. 
In the study (75-30-12) with rats’ effect of TPE on intestinal epithelial TJs, the permeation pathway 
(paracellular or transcellular), and the reversibility of TPE’s effect on intestinal epithelial TJs were 
investigated. Results showed that following TPE administration, TJ protein localisation is altered in a 
reversible fashion as demonstrated for ZO-1 and Cla-3 proteins in rat intestine, suggesting a TPE 
permeation effect and its reversibility. The paracellular marker LC-Biotin was able to penetrate through 
the opened TJs of the intestinal barrier, binding to the cell membranes around the epithelial cells in the 
intestine. These results indicate paracellular permeability enhancement by TPE. Administration of 
biotin-labelled octreotide in TPE to the jejunum of rats resulted in a pattern of localisation of the 
octreotide similar to that seen for the LC-Biotin paracellular marker. It is worth mentioning that TPE 
formulation in one component differed from that of commercial capsule TPE formulation and study 
results should be regarded with certain reserve. 
In one study (75-30-05) the applicant evaluated octreotide-TPE absorption after gavage and direct 
intrajejunal administration. Gavage shoved limited octreotide absorption. In contrast, plasma 
octreotide levels were greater than 50-fold following administration directly to the intestine. The TPE 
formulations were different from that of commercial Mycapssa capsule composition. 
In in vivo study (75-30-08) in rats determined octreotide-TPE absorption along the different segments 
of the GI tract. Direct administration of octreotide-TPE to the stomach resulted in the lowest 
absorption. The TPE enhancing effect was highest at the proximal region of the intestine (duodenum-
jejunum). The TPE formulation in one component differed from that of the commercial capsule TPE 
formulation.

The study 75-30-02 evaluated the size limit of molecules that can penetrate from the intestinal lumen 
into the blood in rats during TPE-induced permeation. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled dextran 
molecules of increasing size were used to determine (in a rat model) the size of molecules that can 
penetrate into the blood. Results show that molecules in size of 10-40 kDa penetrated in systemic 
circulation in higher amounts whereas those of >70 kDa in size were scarcely absorbed. This leads to 
the applicant conclusion that during the TPE action penetration of the majority of pathogens is 
precluded.  
The applicant performed a study (75-30-03) evaluating the duration of TPE induced intestinal 
permeability in rats using FITC-labelled dextran marker. Obtained results point to a decrease of 
permeation induced by TPE after 60 and 90 min. The TPE formulations were different from that of the 
commercial Mycapssa capsule composition. 
The non-GLP study (75-30-10) assessed intestinal permeation effect after repeat dosing intra-
intestinally (daily for 14 days) of octreotide-TPE formulation and found that prolonged dosing did not 
impact absorption rate and it remained steady during all two weeks. The TPE formulation in two 
components differed from that of the commercial capsule TPE formulation. 
In the dossier the applicant provides an overview of published literature on the capacity of different 
substances to improve absorption of drugs with poor permeability. From the literature data it can be 
seen that the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is not static, its permeability can be influenced by different 
external substances. In addition, orally administered permeability enhancement can be influenced by 
many factors (e.g., gastric acidity); it cannot assure complete bioavailability of concomitantly 
administered medicine, it could act adversely. It is not evident with certainty how to measure local 
tight junction (TJ) permeability and the absorption with permeability enhancement can be considered 
as erratic. 
2.9.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No independent secondary pharmacodynamics studies of octreotide capsules were conducted. The 
applicant relies on literature data from earlier octreotide secondary pharmacodynamics investigations. 
The approach was considered acceptable. 
2.9.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No dedicated safety pharmacology studies of octreotide capsules were conducted. Concerning capsule 
excipients safety, the applicant qualifies them as safe, possessing food and pharmacopoeial grade and 
provides a literature overview. This approach was considered acceptable. More details on excipients 
safety evaluation are provided in Toxicology 3.2.4.8 Other toxicity studies section. 
2.9.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The applicant did not perform dedicated NC studies related with pharmacodynamic drug interactions. 
This is acceptable. 
2.9.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant evaluated PK of octreotide-TPE in studies with Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus 
monkeys. The TPE formulation used in the final Mycapssa capsule product is CH-906-4, and 20 mg of 
octreotide. Through the development process, in some NC experiments combinations of the TPE 
excipients were different from those in CH-906-4 and the API concentration varied.

The study (75-30-05) in rats when octreotide-TPE absorption parameters were evaluated after gavage 
and upon intra-jejunal administration showed 53-fold higher AUC0-90 level after direct intra-intestinal 
test article dosing compared to gavage administration. Results should be interpreted with reserve as 
composition of TPE formulation differed significantly. 
Investigation for octreotide-TPE quantitative evaluation of absorption from different segments of GIT in 
rats (75-30-08) resulted in evidence that highest absorption was in the duodenum and the jejunum. 
Calculated PK parameters as Cmax/dose and AUC/dose were higher for octreotide-TPE than those of 
octreotide solution. The octreotide-TPE formulation (CH-906-2) differed in one component compared to 
final CH-906-4 composition. 
The comparison study in rats (75-30-06) after octreotide injection s.c., i.v. or octreotide-TPE intra-
jejunal administration showed dose-related increase of PK parameters. However, calculated absolute 
bioavailability of octreotide-TPE ranged from 1.93% to 4.89% and F relative to a sc octreotide - from 
3.46% to 10.3%, suggesting weak absorption to systemic blood. Moreover, results should be 
interpreted with caution as three TPE formulation classes (CH-809, CH-906-1 and CH-906-2) of 
octreotide acetate used in this study were different from the final formulation. 
Study results in rats (75-30-17) after intrajejunal administration of different doses of octreotide-TPE 
(with CH-906-4 as final formulation) depicted linear increase of PK parameters (AUC, Cmax) over 
doses ranging from 15 to 50 mg/g and smaller increase at 66 mg/g dose. The used Sprague Dawley 
rat model attests to octreotide-TPE absorption after direct intra-intestinal administration but results 
should be translated with caution to oral administration as capsules.  
Study 75-30-13 evaluated octreotide-TPE (with CH-906-4 as final formulation) PK parameters after 
single jejunal (j.j.) or subcutaneous(s.c.) administration comparing hepatic portal (HPV) and systemic 
blood octreotide concentrations. After a single s.c. octreotide injection, mean plasma octreotide 
concentrations were similar in HPV and systemic circulation. Similar results were observed following a 
single i.j. administration of octreotide-TPE formulation, although mean plasma octreotide 
concentrations were slightly higher in HPV plasma than in systemic plasma samples. Although, the 
differences in AUCs were not statistically significant, calculated 17.5% disparity indicated a certain rate 
of first-pass biotransformation. The applicant does not make evaluation of the equivalence (e.g., 
compared to HED) of the applied doses s.c. (289 micrograms/kg) and i.j. (29 770 micrograms/kg). 
The octreotide-TPE pharmacokinetics were evaluated in study (75-30-04) in rats during repeated once 
daily intra-jejunal application. The octreotide-TPE formulation (CH-906-2) differed in one component 
compared to final CH-906-4 composition. Obtained results show comparable octreotide plasma 
concentration-time profiles over the 12 days of dosing and absence of prolonged impact of TPE on the 
gut permeability in rats. 
The applicant in study (75-30-01, 1300-003, Appendix B) in monkeys compared PK of octreotide-TPE 
capsule coated with Acryl-Eze® at different thickness upon its oral administration versus s.c. 
administration of octreotide acetate. The TPE formulations were CH 811-1 and CH-906-1. The first one 
differed significantly in composition from CH-906-4 as final formulation and the second in one 
component. Study depicted that in animals dosed with 0.5 and 8 mg octreotide-TPE dose 
concentrations measured up to 240 min were likely confounded and results are not discussed. In the 
group dosed with 5 mg, blood sampling time was extended until 585 min. Individual monkeys’ oral 
octreotide plasma concentration curves showed significant dispersion in Cmax, Tmax and AUC, 
suggesting non-consistent, erratic absorption rate and very small bioavailability (F only 1.5%) 
calculated from s.c. octreotide data. Results from this study in monkey send certain signals of possible 
weak and non-consistent absorption of oral octreotide in capsule with TPE in humans. Data from 
published literature (Fricker, 1991, 1992) confirms negligible octreotide oral bioavailability.

2.9.4.  Toxicology 
2.9.4.1.  Single dose toxicity  
No single-dose toxicity studies were conducted with octreotide. Octreotide capsules are intended for 
repeated administration. Therefore, the lack of single dose toxicity studies was considered acceptable. 
2.9.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity  
The potential toxicity of octreotide capsules was evaluated in 28-day (Study 1300-002), and the 3-
month (Study 1300-007) and 9-month (Study 1300-009) GLP toxicology studies, which were 
conducted using clinical trial batches of octreotide capsules containing 20 mg of octreotide, except the 
28-day toxicity study, where the formulation used did not contain magnesium chloride. The monkey 
was selected for repeat-dose toxicity studies because it is considered the most appropriate species to 
study absorption with enteric-coated drugs, such as the octreotide capsules, due to the difficulty in 
delivering capsules to the stomach of animals of a small size.  No clinical signs of test article-related 
toxicity were observed during the dosing period in any dose groups of the toxicity studies. Few 
monkeys from the control group and the treatment groups died or were euthanised during the study. 
All deaths were unequivocally attributed to complications occurring in the dosing and handling process. 
The NOAEL was determined at the highest dose used in the studies – 20 mg/day (4,9 mg/kg/d). The 
20 mg/day dose of octreotide acetate administered in toxicity studies corresponds to approximately 
5.0 mg/kg/day for monkeys weighing 4 kg, which represents a human equivalent dose (HED) of 1.62 
mg/kg/day, or a total human dose of approximately 113 mg/day of octreotide based on a human body 
weight of 70 kg. This provides a safety margin of 1.4 for the maximum human dose of 80 mg/day. 
Therefore, the data from the repeat-dose toxicity study in monkeys suggested that no novel toxicities 
will be associated with oral administration of octreotide capsules at doses that produce systemic 
exposures similar to those obtained following sc Sandostatin IR. Thus, the local gastrointestinal and 
the systemic toxicity profiles of Octreolin, Sandostatin and negative control olive oil capsules were 
comparable without any adverse events noted. 
Based on results of a 28-day oral dose toxicology study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys, the NOAEL 
of octreotide capsules was the highest dose tested, 19.5 mg/day or 4.9 mg/kg/day. Moreover, no 
safety issues related to the TPE excipients were reported. However, due to oesophageal injury some 
animals did not receive all doses. Therefore, the applicant was asked to present analysis of results of 
Study 1300-002 excluding animal no. 126. However, the conclusions of the study that administration 
of Octreolin to male and female cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 9.75 mg/animal/day (Group 3) and 
19.5 mg/animal/day (Group 4) has demonstrated a trend toward a decrease in exposure with 
continued dosing and a decrease after the afternoon dose compared to the morning dose, and that the 
latter appears to be somewhat less in female than in male animals, did not change. 
2.9.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
No additional genotoxicity testing with octreotide capsules has been conducted and the applicant relies 
on data from sc Sandostatin IR. The Lack of studies was considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 26/130 
 
 
 
2.9.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
The applicant did not conduct any carcinogenicity study and refers to studies conducted during 
development of sc Sandostatin IR using the generated data for product labelling (SmPC section 5.6). 
Lack of carcinogenicity studies was considered acceptable. 
2.9.4.5.  Reproduction toxicity and developmental toxicity 
The applicant did not evaluate reproductive and developmental toxicity of octreotide-TPE and refer to 
studies conducted during development of sc Sandostatin IR using the generated data for product 
labelling (SmPC section 5.6). Lack of reproductive and developmental toxicity studies was considered 
acceptable. 
2.9.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Systemic exposure in terms of AUC0-t and Cmax showed high variability among study days and 
between animals, indicating day-to-day differences in oral bioavailability and very low bioavailability. 
While on Day 90 in the study 1300-009, octreotide plasma concentrations in animals receiving 
octreotide capsules were low, measurements on Days 1, 180, and 270 indicated continuous systemic 
exposure to octreotide. For sc Sandostatin IR, the mean values for AUC0-t were comparable at each 
sampling time point. A consistently longer Tmax was observed following treatment with octreotide 
capsules compared with sc Sandostatin IR. However, this had no effect on overall exposure (AUC0-t) 
to octreotide which was comparable for oral administration of 20 mg of octreotide capsules and sc 
administration of 0.1 mg of sc Sandostatin IR. 
2.9.4.7.  Local tolerance 
The local tolerance of octreotide capsules was investigated as part of repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
cynomolgus monkeys. No signs of GI toxicity were detected at approximately 10-fold greater local 
exposure in monkeys compared to humans. 
2.9.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Since the TPE formulation in its exact composition is a novel pharmaceutical formulation, it was 
necessary to provide safety data for the TPE formulation contained in octreotide capsules 
(EMEA/CHMP/QWP/396951/2006). The excipients included in the TPE system are polyvinylpyrrolidone 
(PVP-12), sodium caprylate, polysorbate 80, glyceryl monocaprylate (GMC), glyceryl tricaprylate 
(GTC), and magnesium chloride. The applicant has provided the safety assessment protocols for each 
excipient considering that they are not novel by EMA, as they all have been included in drugs approved 
for marketing. Also, metabolism and function of each excipient was explained in these protocols, safety 
is assessed referring to 3-month and 9-month repeat toxicity studies in vivo. All the excipients are 
pharmacopoeial grade or made of pharmacopoeial ingredients. It was considered acceptable. 
The applicant conducted an additional 28-day toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys (Study 1300-015) 
to qualify the impurities according to ICH guideline Q3B(R2). The drug product batch used in the study 
was exposed to stress conditions (7 months at 25°C/60%RH followed by 12 months at 2°C to 8°C) to 
enrich product-related impurities. The octreotide capsules enriched with product-related impurities 
were well tolerated. No signs of toxicity were observed in in-life and post-mortem analyses. The lack of 
toxicity in this study qualified impurity levels at the specified acceptance limits and the maximum 
human dose of 80 mg/subject. According to the ICH Q3B(R2) guideline, a minimum duration of 14 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 27/130 
 
 
 
days for the toxicity study is appropriate for the continuous treatment drug product. Also, a minimum 
screen (e.g., genotoxic potential), should be conducted. A study to detect point mutations and one to 
detect chromosomal aberrations, both in vitro, are considered an appropriate minimum screen. The 
applicant has tested the specified impurities in octreotide capsules for structural alerts for genotoxicity 
using two quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) prediction methodologies (DEREK and 
Leadscope). The purpose of this assessment is to meet the ICH M7 (R2) requirements, which states 
that two (Q)SAR prediction methodologies that complement each other should be applied. One 
methodology should be expert rule-based (i.e., DEREK) and the second methodology should be 
statistical-based (i.e., Leadscope Model Applier). The applicant has evaluated the potential genotoxicity 
and mutagenicity of the five Octreotide degradants structures provided: octreotide linear, n-acetyl 
octreotide, lys(ac)- octreotide, n-octanoyl-octreotide and lys(oct)-octreotide in the study 75-69-03 and 
the 2 degradants - D-Phe-Cys (R-methyl imidazolidinone adduct) Octreotide Isomer and D-Phe-Cys (S-
methyl imidazolidinone adduct) Octreotide Isomer in the study 75-69-04). Based on the results of both 
knowledge-based and statistically based genotoxicity QSAR prediction programs, the overall weight of 
evidence indicates that none of the potential impurities or degradation products in octreotide capsules 
should present any potential risk for genotoxicity.

In Phase I two parameters for octreotide were presented, the distribution coefficient (logD) and 
Predicted Environmental concentration (PEC). 
The applicant refers to Buchwald and Bodor (1998) for determination of the distribution coefficient of 
octreotide where the octonal-water partition of several peptides including octreotide was evaluated 
using the shake flask approach. Protocol of the analysis on determination of logD for octreotide has not 
been provided, but the full refereed article has been provided within the dossier in Module 4. 
The log Kow was reported to be -0.49, which does not exceed the EMA partition coefficient limit of 4.5. 
Fpen was refined assuming that 100% of the patient population is daily taking the medicinal product 
for the relevant disease(s), i.e., Fpen = prevalence of the disease. For orphan drug submissions, Fpen 
can be refined based on the prevalence on which the medicinal orphan drug designation, as adopted by 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 28/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Product (COMP), was based. Based on the prevalence of the 
disease, this was equivalent to a total of fewer than 102,000 people or less than 0.02% of the 
population in the EU. Therefore, the refined PECSW of octreotide is 0.008 μg/L. This value is below the 
action limit of 0.01 μg/L. As such, according to the EMA guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) if the 
PECSW value is below 0.01 μg/L, then a Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis should not be 
performed. 
2.9.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant seeks to obtain MA for Mycapssa gastro-resistant capsules with octreotide acetate-TPE 
and presented hybrid Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) according to Article 10(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC. To support MAA the applicant relies in part on nonclinical data for the medicinal product 
Sandostatin® and on information in the published literature for sc Sandostatin IR and has conducted 
additional studies to qualify the safety of its formulation and administration suitability of octreotide 
acetate by the oral route. The design the nonclinical development programme fulfils regulatory 
guidance and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) requirements. As this MAA is a hybrid MAA, the 
applicant provided justifications on absence of studies in CTD Module 4 (NC part) of the dossier. In 
general justifications to forego specific studies were considered as acceptable. The applicant’s non-
clinical written and tabulated summary and toxicology study-reports have been used as the basis of 
the text in this critical assessment. The data submitted were assessed taking into account the legal 
basis of the application, applicable guidelines and other scientific criteria. 
The nonclinical primary pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies were performed as non GLP-
compliant investigations. However, four toxicity studies up to 9 months in duration were Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant. In vitro studies on impurities conducted by the applicant were 
non-GLP studies. This is in line with official requirements. 
Concentrations of octreotide were quantified in mice and monkey plasma by LC-MS/MS, ELISA and 
fluorescence methods. For GLP studies, validated methods were used for the quantification of 
octreotide in plasma and validation reports are presented in the dossier. The analytical method was 
validated for intra- and inter-day accuracy, precision and if necessary, specificity, dilution effect, 
freeze/thaw stability and storage stability. 
For MoA of octreotide acetate, the applicant relies on identical active substance to the medicinal 
product Sandostatin approved in the EU and on published literature. The approach was considered as 
completely satisfactory. It is known that octreotide is poorly absorbed given orally, thus, to increase 
the permeability of the intestine the applicant formulated capsule with excipients collectively called 
Transient Permeability Enhancer (TPE®). In the dossier published literature data were provided 
describing that TPE ingredients enhance paracellular enterocyte permeability. Through the 
development process, in some NC experiments combinations of the TPE excipients were different from 
those chosen as final formulation (CH-906-4). Subsequently those investigation results should be 
regarded with caution.  
In its own in vivo PD studies with rats the applicant focused on the mode of action of TPE-induced 
permeability, pharmacokinetic properties and evaluation of the magnitude, duration, and long-term 
reproducibility of the effects of the TPE system on GI permeability. The applicant demonstrated that 
TPE induced permeability is limited, that repeated administration of octreotide-TPE is transient, 
reversible and non-refractory; induced permeation is restricted to molecules size of about 70 kDa etc. 
It is worth mentioning that direct intra-intestinal administration of the test article differs from oral 
application of capsules and results from the clinical perspective should be read with certain caution. 
From the literature it can be seen that gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is not static, its permeability can be 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 29/130 
 
 
 
influenced by different external substances. Orally administered permeability enhancement can be 
influenced by many factors (e.g., gastric acidity, food etc.), cannot assure complete absorption and 
can act adversely. It is not certain that it can assure local tight junction (TJ) permeability. In addition, 
absorption supported by enhancement may be considered as erratic.  
PK studies conducted by the applicant demonstrated that enteral administration of octreotide-TPE 
capsules enhances to a certain degree the absorption of octreotide, which is normally very poorly 
absorbed in the GI tract. Individual monkeys’ oral octreotide plasma concentration curves showed 
significant dispersion in Cmax, Tmax and AUC, suggesting non-consistent, erratic absorption rate and 
very small bioavailability (F only 1.5%) calculated from s.c. octreotide data. Results from this study in 
monkeys send certain signals of possible weak and non-consistent absorption of oral octreotide in 
capsule with TPE. 
As toxicological properties following sc administration of octreotide contained in Sandostatin®, are well 
established, the applicant relies in part on nonclinical data for this reference medical product. 
Therefore, single-dose, reproductive and developmental toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
studies were not conducted. The reference data from these studies has been transferred to the 
appropriate sections of SmPC of octreotide-TPE capsules. This is in line with the guidelines for the 
hybrid MAA. 
The applicant has conducted additional toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys to demonstrate the 
safety of octreotide capsules in comparison to sc Sandostatin IR and to qualify product-related 
impurities in support of a hybrid MAA according to Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The potential 
toxicity of octreotide capsules was evaluated in repeat-dose toxicology studies, which almost all were 
conducted using clinical trial batches of octreotide capsules containing 20 mg of octreotide. The 
cynomolgus monkey is considered the most appropriate species, selected for repeat-dose toxicity 
studies, because it would be difficult to deliver capsules to the stomach of animals of a small size. The 
data from the repeat-dose toxicity study in monkeys suggested that there was no novel systemic 
toxicities discovered and the local gastrointestinal toxicities will be observed with oral administration of 
octreotide capsules at doses that produce systemic exposures similar to those obtained following sc 
Sandostatin IR. Toxicokinetic data confirms that systemic exposure in terms of AUC0-t and Cmax is 
highly variable among study days and between animals, indicating day-to-day differences in oral 
bioavailability and very low bioavailability. 
Since the TPE formulation in its exact composition is a novel pharmaceutical formulation, according to 
the EMA Guidelines the applicant was asked to provide adequate information on systemic effects of the 
excipients, either from published literature or from own studies. The applicant has provided the safety 
assessment protocols for each excipient considering that they are not novel, as they all have been 
included in medicinal products approved previously in the EU, they are pharmacopoeial grade or made 
of pharmacopoeial ingredients. Also, some of the excipients do not reach systemic circulation because 
either are metabolised in the liver or are poorly absorbed. 
Toxicity profile of the drug-related impurities and degradation products identified in clinical trial 
batches of octreotide capsules were assessed in vivo and in vitro for potential genotoxicity. A study to 
detect point mutations and one to detect chromosomal aberrations, both in vitro, are considered an 
appropriate minimum screen according to the guidelines. Based on the results, none of the potential 
impurities or degradation products in octreotide capsules should present any potential risk for 
genotoxicity and they seem to be well tolerated. 
The assessment of the potential risk to the environment for octreotide has been terminated in Phase I 
because the PECsurface/water value was below the action limit. The calculations were made based on 
the prevalence of acromegaly and assuming a market share of 100%, which is in line with the ERA 
Guideline. According to the same guideline log Know should be determined experimentally by the

applicant or can be taken from the published literature. The full reference of log Know determination 
for octreotide has been provided with the dossier. 
2.9.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the NC programme was based in part on data generated for sc and iv administration of 
octreotide during development of Sandostatin. The applicant performed additional primary PD, PK and 
repeat-dose toxicity studies with octreotide-TPE or octreotide capsules which demonstrated that the 
novel TPE formulation of octreotide is suitable and safe for oral administration. No additional 
recommendations for the Product Information are suggested from the nonclinical point of view. All 
issues revealed as nonclinical concerns were resolved. 
2.10.  Clinical aspects

2.10.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.10.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology development programme for octreotide capsules consisted of 12 studies (11 
clinical pharmacology studies and 1 Phase 3 study). Comparative bioavailability bridging results for 
octreotide capsules and the reference medicinal product (sc Sandostatin IR), as well as the effect of 
food and water volume on the PK of octreotide capsules (studies CHI-001, CHI-002, OCT-01) were 
provided. 
Overall, a total of 184 healthy subjects participated in the clinical pharmacology programme for 
octreotide capsules. Subjects were exposed to at least a single dose (3 mg – 40 mg) of octreotide 
capsules. In study CH-ACM-01 in patients with acromegaly, 65 patients were treated with 40 mg/day, 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 32/130 
 
 
 
 
 
33 patients were treated with 60 mg/day, and 57 patients were treated with 80 mg/day at the end of 
the core treatment phase. According to the applicant no definitive ADME studies in humans have been 
performed for octreotide capsules.  
Bioanalytical methods. The methods used here represent standard approaches used in the field. The 
pre-specified criteria for the different validation parameters are in line with the Guideline on 
bioanalytical method validation and were fulfilled. The provided validation reports for quantitation of 
octreotide in human serum and plasma include the necessary information. The measurements with the 
individual calculated concentrations are presented. The analytical reports contain necessary 
information on reference and calibration standards, run acceptance criteria are set, adequately detailed 
descriptions of analytical procedures are provided, information on sample tracking and sample analysis 
are provided. Necessary certificates of analysis are presented.  In general, the applied approaches in 
designing and implementing the validation of bioanalytical procedures is considered acceptable as the 
performance of the assay methods in the study met the defined criteria, and could be considered 
suitable for purpose. Information on the development of anti-octreotide neutralizing antibodies in 
human serum assays is provided. As there was no evidence for induction of anti-octreotide antibodies 
during chronic administration of oral octreotide acetate, the development of the neutralizing antibody 
assay is considered not to be needed. 
Several issues were raised. Bioanalytical analysis (clinical study OCT-02 - according to the validation 
report P1206 Project AHEA2 - Quantitation of Lisinopril) - The long-term storage parameters covering 
time of the sample storage in study OTC-02 was not found. applicant was asked to submit validation 
results and time of the sample storage for Lisinopril analysis. Method Validation Report LCMSD 455.2 - 
Quantitation of Digoxin - The analysis of the effect of haemolysis and lipemia were not found in the 
dossier. The applicant was asked to submit the missing results. Bioanalytical analysis (clinical study 
CHI-006 - quantitation of metformin) Long term storage condition for metformin were supposed to be 
added but the results are missing. applicant was asked to submit the results covering storage of the 
samples during bioanalysis. The lipemic effect was not addressed during validation of detection 
methods for warfarin enantiomers, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin and estradiol. The bioanalytical 
reports for GH and IGF determination could not be identified in the dossier. The applicant submitted 
the missing results. Lipaemia effect was accounted for in the bioanalytical method used as a routine, 
and the applicant showed that haemolysis was observed in very few samples and that this effect was 
unlikely to distort the overall reliability of the results. The final IGF-1 and GH bioanalytical report from 
ERL for the 3 pivotal studies was provided and is acceptable, therefore, the issue is resolved. 
Therefore, we conclude that there are no further issues with bioanalytical methods and their validation. 
Absorption  
Octreotide capsules are designed to withstand the acid environment of the stomach, deliver octreotide 
to the small intestine, reversibly increase intestinal paracellular absorption without effecting 
transcellular absorption.  
Mechanistic effects of Transient Permeability Enhancer (TPE). Octreotide capsules have a gastric acid 
resistant enteric coating to deliver octreotide acetate to the small intestine for absorption. The TPE 
formulation protects the drug molecule from inactivation by the GI environment and at the same time 
acts on the intestinal wall to induce local, transient, and reversible opening of the tight junctions, 
allowing permeation of the drug molecules through the intestine. The intestinal permeability induced 
by octreotide capsules after a single dose of 20 mg, was tested in a study CHI-004 using the 
lactulose/mannitol (L/M) assay and supported by a literature review.

The applicant performed a number of studies where bioavailability of Octreotide capsules was analysed 
in both HV and ACM patients. The results most relevant to bioavailability are presented here from 
studies CHI-004, CHI-001, CHI-002, OCT-01 and CH-ACM-01 (PK Substudy of pivotal Study 302). 
Study CHI-001 
Study design. This was a single centre, Phase 1, open, partly randomised, dose-escalation study in 12 
healthy male volunteers. The study consisted of 2 stages. Twelve (12) subjects were planned and 
completed Stage 1 and the first treatment of Stage 2 (10 mg dose). The 20 mg treatment in Stage 2 
was conducted after approval of a protocol amendment, and 9 of the 12 subjects returned for that visit 
and dose. Octreotide plasma concentrations following each Octreolin administration were determined 
at 0 (pre-dose, up to 60 minutes before administration), every 20 minutes post dosing for the first 4 
hours, then at 5, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours post dosing. 
Study results are presented in Table 3.3.1.1.1. 
The observed variability of PK parameters followed p.o. administration seems quite high. The applicant 
did not present the analysis of the sources of significant inter-subject and intra-subject variability. This 
issue will not be further pursued because administration of this drug will require biochemical 
monitoring to ascertain efficacy.

Study CHI-002 
Study design  
This was a phase 1, open-label, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover, food-effect bioavailability study 
(N=24), followed by open-label assessment bioavailability after single octreotide acetate (Sandostatin) 
injection in healthy subjects. Octreotide plasma concentrations following oral Octreolin administrations 
were determined on each dosing day at 0 (pre-dose, up to 60 minutes before administration), every 20 
minutes post dosing for the first 5 hours, then after 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours post dosing. 
Study results are presented in Table 3.3.1.1.2 and Table 3.3.1.1.4

Mean plasma concentrations, Cmax, AUC0 t, and AUC0-inf increased in a dose-related manner 
following administration of different octreotide capsule doses (3 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg).  
• Octreotide capsules showed an apparent lag time and considerable within- and between-subject 
variability in the octreotide plasma concentration-time profile.  
• Median Tmax and mean t½ were not dependent on octreotide capsule dose.  
• Octreotide capsule (20 mg) was comparable to 0.1 mg octreotide sc in systemic exposure (AUC).

Administration of Octreotide 0.1 mg and Administration of Octreolin 3 mg, 10 mg, and 20

Bioavailability is calculated as AUC oral/AUC IV*Dose IV/Dose oral, under assumption nothing else 
impacts clearance and F(u)b fraction unbound in blood. The applicant claims that after correcting for 
dose, the octreotide apparent BA from fasted oral administration of octreotide capsules relative to sc 
Sandostatin IR was 0.63%. Study CHI-002 Demographic information are given as a mean for all 
subjected enrolled to the study, regardless treatment groups. That approach hinders analysis of any 
imbalance according to the initial demographic parameters that could affect PK, between treatment 
groups. The applicant was asked to submit the demographic description for age, body weight, BMI, 
height, sex according to treatment arms. The data were provided and the issue was resolved. 
Study CHI-004  
Study design. This was a phase 1, open-label, 4-period, 2-sequence crossover study designed to 
assess the Transient Permeability Enhancer (TPE) induced intestinal permeability effect, PK, and safety 
in healthy subjects (N = 24) after a single dose of 20 mg octreotide capsules using the L/M test that 
measures the ability of 2 non-metabolised sugar molecules (mannitol and lactulose), to permeate the 
intestinal mucosa.  
Subjects received the following treatments during the study: 
A = Control: L/M test and GHRH-Arginine test at the same time 
B = Octreolin 20 mg at t = 0 plus L/M test at 2 hours post Octreolin dosing  
C = Octreolin 20 mg at t = 0 plus L/M test at 5.5 hours post Octreolin dosing and GHRHArginine test at 
t = 2 h 
D = Octreolin 20 mg at t = 0 plus L/M test at 10 hours post Octreolin dosing 
Octreotide plasma concentrations were determined within 20 minutes pre-dose, and then post-dose at 
0.33, 0.66, 1, 1.33, 1.66, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3, 3.25, 3.5, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours.

healthy subjects. A single 20 mg dose was used in this study. The study aimed to (a) evaluate the 
effect of a reduced size high fat meal (i.e. snack) post-dose and (b) full standardised meal pre- and 
post-dose on the absorption of octreotide from Octreolin (oral octreotide acetate) compared to a

Product Characteristics 
The applicant concluded that the relative bioavailability of oral octreotide compared to sc octreotide 
was approximately 0.5%. Night dosing may result in decreased exposure (AUC) to octreotide capsules. 
Octreotide capsules induce an increase in paracellular intestinal permeability measured 2 hours 
following administration. Within 5.5 hours of administration, intestinal permeability returns to baseline 
levels. 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 38/130 
 
 
 
 
The absolute bioavailability of Octreotide capsules 20 mg has not been determined in humans. The 
applicant performed six studies where bioavailability was analysed in HV (Studies CHI-001, CHI-002, 
CHI-004, CHI-005, OCT-01 and OCT-02 and in one study in ACM (PK sub-study of Study CH-ACM-01). 
The sampling time is sufficient to describe bioavailability of both oral and comparator octreotide and 
AUCinf values. 
The applicant claims that study CHI-004 showed that the octreotide capsules formulation increases 
intestinal absorption of octreotide. The concept is based on applicant’s approach to use TPE technology 
to increase BA of octreotide. The applicant proposes octreotide novel oral formulation that has similar 
bioavailability as described for subcutaneously injectable somatostatin analogue (2 mg of orally 
administered octreotide was comparable to subcutaneous injection of 50 micrograms [20 mg would be 
comparable to 0.5 mg sc] while the proposed novel octreotide capsule (20 mg) was comparable to 0.1 
mg octreotide sc in systemic exposure (AUC)). Previous research indicated that absorption of the drug 
was quite variable between the subjects and the different locations. The dose-corrected systemic 
availability relative to subcutaneous administration in some studies was 0.28%, but significant plasma 
octreotide concentrations were achieved even without the TPE technology in the 1986– 1991 period. 
The then proposed oral formulation managed to lower the mean 24 h growth-hormone concentrations 
by over 50% in every case (Fuessl et al, 1987; Willimset al, 1986 and Tuvia et al, 2012). The 
consistent efficiency using TPE technology is not obvious, as seen in high variability in BA and rather 
limited clinical efficacy in substantial proportion of patients. 
Two comparative bioavailability (BA) bridging studies between octreotide capsules and sc Sandostatin 
IR 0.1-mg single injection were conducted (studies CHI-001 and CHI-002).  
The PK of octreotide is linear after single-dose administration of octreotide capsules from 3 mg to 40 
mg in healthy subjects under fasted conditions. The median time to maximum plasma concentration 
(Tmax) after oral administration of octreotide capsules 3 mg to 20 mg ranged from 0.67 to 1.67 hours 
and was not dose-dependent. 
The studies with octreotide capsules 20 mg showed rather broad distribution of both Tmax and C max 
values. The applicant acknowledges that a capsule containing 20 mg of octreotide (calculated as free 
base) resulted in a systemic exposure (based on AUC) that was slightly higher than the exposure to a 
0.1-mg dose sc Sandostatin IR. The mean time to maximal absorption values ranged from 1.67 to 3.54 
hrs for capsules in HV and from 1 to 1.5 hrs in ACM for capsules. The mean time to mean maximal 
absorption seems clearly numerically longer as compared to ~0.5 hr for mean maximal absorption 
after SC formulations. However, the mean C max concentrations values were not so different and less 
numerically different between capsules and SC formulations, i.e., mean C max values after 20 mg were 
ranging from ~3 till 8.21 ng/mL after oral and ~3.5 ng/ml after SC formulation of 0.1 mg.  
After correcting for dose, the octreotide apparent BA from fasted oral administration of octreotide 
capsules relative to sc Sandostatin IR was calculated as 0.63%.  
In patients with acromegaly, there was a dose-related increase in the mean plasma octreotide 
concentrations after chronic administration of 40 mg (20 mg bid), 60 mg (40 mg morning / 20 mg 
evening), and 80 mg bid (study CH-ACM-01) 
Unprecise calculation of bioavailability. Based on comparable mean Cmax values from studies 
CHI-001 and CHI-002 the applicant calculated ratio relative to s.c. bioavailability of 0,63%. It was 
unclear how this BA value was generated as different proportions for different oral dosages were 
calculated and the applicant was asked to clarify. This calculation does not represent absolute 
bioavailability and the approach to calculate relative to s.c. bioavailability based on mean Cmax values 
is unprecise. Based on AUCinf values, it did not seem that 20 mg oral is comparable to 0.1 mg s.c. The 
number of patients in both cohorts differ more than two times and this is prone to biases. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 39/130 
 
 
 
applicant was asked to use bioavailability calculation the AUCinf values from the same patients after 
both s.c. and oral administration and incorporate these results clearly in SmPC section 5.2. The 
applicant implemented the requested changes. The agreed wording of section 5.2 of the SmPC states 
that: “In healthy subjects, systemic exposure, as measured by AUC, of a single oral dose of Mycapssa 
(20 mg octreotide acetate) was 95% to 100% of that of a single dose of subcutaneous octreotide 
acetate (0.1 mg octreotide acetate), demonstrating comparable exposure.” The issue was considered 
resolved.  
Higher variability in bioavailability after the oral vs s/c administration. Much higher variability 
was observed in Cmax and AUCinf values after the oral as compared s/c administration, e.g., SD were 
+/- 50 to 110% vs +/- 10 to 20% for AUC inf mean values for oral vs s/c administration, respectively. 
This is observed despite higher sample sizes of patients analysed after oral administration as compared 
to s/c. The consequence of such increased variability on clinical effectiveness has not been provided.  
Influence of food 
Influence of food (including the size and alcohol) was assessed in several studies, primarily in Study 
CHI-002, Study OCT-01 and Study OCT-02. 
Study CHI-002 
The effect of a high-calorie/high-fat meal on the BA of octreotide from octreotide capsules following a 
single 20-mg dose was assessed in study CHI-002. Mean octreotide plasma concentrations and values 
for Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(inf) were substantially reduced following fed as compared to fasted 
Octreolin administration with geometric mean ratios of fed vs. fasted administration ranging from 
8.79% to 10.44%. (Table 3.3.1.1.5).

In the Main Study, administration of oral octreotide acetate 1 hour before a full high fat meal, 1 hour 
after a full high fat meal, or 0.5 hours before a reduced size high fat meal resulted in a substantial 
decrease in plasma octreotide concentrations by 82% to 92%. (see Table 3.3.1.1.6). 
Table 3.3.1.1.6. Statistical comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters between fed and 
fasted Test Conditions (Main Study) 
*Mean ± standard deviation (N) except Tlag and Tmax for which the median (N) [Range] is reported. 
†A lag time was not calculated if the first concentration ≤LOQ occurred at the first sample time. 
Bioavailability was decreased by approximately 60% when octreotide capsules were administered 1 
hour before a reduced size high fat meal and by approximately 87% (95% CI, from 5 to 40%) when 
octreotide capsules were administered 2 hours after full high fat meal. 
Food, but not the ingested water volume, decreases the absorption of octreotide from octreotide 
capsules by 90%. Therefore, the octreotide capsules should be administered under fasting conditions 
(at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after a meal). Bioavailability was decreased by approximately 60% 
when octreotide capsules were administered 1 hour before a reduced size high fat meal. In the Phase 3 
clinical studies in patients with acromegaly, octreotide capsules were effective when administered at 
least 1 hour prior to a meal and at least 2 hours after a meal. Therefore, applicant states that 
octreotide capsules should be administered under fasting conditions (at least 1 hour before and 2 
hours after a meal). Night dosing may result in decreased exposure (AUC) to octreotide capsules.  
Uncertain method of administration. Study OCT-01 showed that bioavailability was decreased by 
approximately 87% (95% CI, from 5 to 40%) when octreotide capsules were administered 2 hours 
after full high fat meal. This finding might be the reason for such high variability of BA and thus does 
not support the proposal made for method administration (Section 4.2 of SmPC). The administration 
should be limited to administration by 1 hour before the meal. As the administration of octreotide 
capsules (20 mg) with food results in decreases in the extent of exposure, regardless of meal size or 
timing (BA was decreased by 60% when octreotide was administered 1 hour before a reduced-size 
high-fat meal and BA was decreased by 82 – 92% for the other 4 meal size/timing treatments) the 
applicant was invited to further justify the proposed posology (at least 1 hour before a meal or at least 
2 hours after a meal  The applicant informed that the instructions regarding administration are the 
same as those used in all Phase 3 clinical studies, which demonstrated the efficacy of octreotide 
capsules. However, according to Rapporteurs suggestion, the recommendation for the individual

patient to standardise intake in relation was added to the SmPC (Section 4.2). ). A statement was 
added to the SmPC section 5.2 that “Full size high fat meals provided 1 hour prior or 2 hours post dose 
significantly decreased the absorption of Mycapssa”. 
Distribution 
No dedicated distribution studies were performed by the applicant. The applicant addresses distribution 
data based on originators study results. This information is provided in SmPC Section 5.2. This is 
acceptable. 
Elimination 
No dedicated excretion studies were performed by the applicant. Excretion was assessed in view of 
elimination analysis that was addressed in several studies.

The applicant concluded that there was no effect of route of administration on octreotide elimination, 
and a comparable mean elimination half-life was obtained following all treatments. Based on data from 
originator, after iv injection, the elimination is biphasic, with half-lives of 10 and 90 minutes. Most of 
the peptide is eliminated via the faeces, while approximately 32% is excreted unchanged into the 
urine. 
The applicant also concluded that in patients with acromegaly, elimination after chronic dosing was 
slightly slower than that seen in healthy volunteers, with mean apparent half-life values at steady state 
ranging from 3.2–4.5 hours across doses (daily 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg). 
Longer half-life as compared to s/c administration. The applicant notes that elimination half-life 
after sc administration of octreotide is similar to Mycapssa single dose (100 minutes).  
No definitive metabolism studies in humans have been performed for octreotide capsules.

The applicant did not perform dedicated inter-conversion studies.  
No definitive metabolism studies in humans have been performed for octreotide capsules. This is 
acceptable, as there is no data that octreotide metabolism could depend on route of administration. 
No definitive metabolism studies in humans have been performed for octreotide capsules. This is 
acceptable, as there is no data that octreotide metabolism could depend on route of administration. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality. The dose proportionality was assessed by a power model analysis using the 
arithmetic mean values from several PK studies. Data were used to assess PK linearity of octreotide 
after administration of octreotide capsules. Pharmacokinetic parameters included Cmax and AUC0-inf 
following oral administration of single doses to healthy volunteers under fasted conditions. 
The applicant notes that although there was variability among the 4 studies with the 20-mg dose, 
there was a dose-related increase in the mean plasma octreotide concentration after oral 
administration of single doses of octreotide capsules ranging from 3 mg to 40 mg (see Figure 
3.3.1.1.8 below).

In conclusion, the PK of octreotide is linear after single-dose administration of octreotide capsules from 
3 mg to 40 mg. Based on analysis performed by the applicant, the PK of octreotide is linear after 
single-dose administration of octreotide capsules from 3 mg to 40 mg in healthy subjects under fasted 
conditions. This is acceptable. 
Time dependency. No dedicated studies were performed for time dependence. Based on indirect 
comparison of the same dosages, mean Cmax levels were not increased and mean half-live values 
were numerically ~20Į higher after multiple dosages for the same dosage administration (20 or 40 
mg). This longer elimination is addressed in SmPC section 5,2.   
Intra- and inter-subject variability. The Intra- and inter-subject variability was addressed in Study 
CHI-004 (see study design and above) and several PK parameters. The intra-subject variability was 
addressed in coefficients of variation and was less than 50% for markers of bioavailability. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population. PK of octreotide capsules in patients with acromegaly was 
addressed in PK sub-study of study CH-ACM-01. There was a dose-related increase in the mean 
plasma octreotide concentrations after administration of octreotide capsules 40 mg (20 mg bid), 60 mg 
(40 mg morning / 20 mg evening), and 80 mg bid (40 mg bid). Based on AUC0-t, there is a dose-
related and reasonably dose-proportional increase in exposure after the morning dose.  
The steady-state mean apparent elimination t½ ranged from 3.19   1.07 (arithmetic mean   SD, for 
a dose of 60 mg) to 4.47   2.02 hours (for a dose of 80 mg). The applicant concludes that similar 
trends in octreotide PK between healthy subjects and patients with acromegaly were seen following 
oral administration, except for a longer half-life in acromegaly patients than in healthy volunteers. 
Study ACM-01 tested PK after the multiple regimen that was assessed after at least two months of 
receiving the therapeutic dosage regimen (the last month of the Dose Escalation Phase plus the first 
month of the Fixed Dose Phase. Numerically ~50% longer half-life values were observed in ACM 
patient’s (after the multiple doses) vs healthy volunteers (after single dose administration). The 
applicant addressed this finding in the SmPC, although the reason for this finding is not explained. This 
was considered acceptable. 
Special populations

Study design. This was a phase 1, open-label, single dose (40 mg) PK and safety study in healthy or 
with severe renal impairment or with end-stage renal disease on dialysis patients 
Study results. The mean plasma octreotide concentrations and PK parameter values in subjects with 
ESRD on dialysis and their matched controls as well in subjects with severe renal impairment (SRI), 
i.e., eGFR 15 – 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) and their matched controls were similar (Figure 3.3.1.1.10, Table 
3.3.1.1.9). There was a significant increase in octreotide exposure in patients with end stage renal 
disease (ESRD).

Based on Study CHI-007 results, the SRI function did not affect essentially the mean total exposure 
(AUC) to octreotide administered following oral administration, whereas numerical ~3x decrease CL/F 
with only 20% increase in half-life, compared to healthy controls.  
In the same study, with octreotide capsules, subjects with ESRD on dialysis had ~2x decrease in CL/F 
with a corresponding ~2x increase in AUC0-inf and t½ compared to matched healthy subjects. There 
were minimal changes in Vz/F and Tmax. In both renal populations. 
The observed significant increase in octreotide exposure in patients with ESRD is addressed in the 
SmPC proposing mitigation strategy – to start from 2x smaller dose (20 mg daily) and maintenance 
dose based on IGF-1 levels, patient’s signs and symptoms, and tolerability. The adequacy of this 
proposal is not tested but seems reasonable, but this is based on small study after single dose 
administration. The applicant had to address the issue of accumulation during the procedure. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Impact on PK in patients with impaired hepatic function was addressed in study CHI-PHT-01. 
Study CH-PHT-01 
Study design. This was a phase 2, open-label, dose escalation, PK, and safety study in 18 patients with 
impaired liver function liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension patients (Child Pugh A or B). 
Study results. Single dose administration of oral octreotide acetate (10 mg or 20 mg) in 18 subjects 
with cirrhosis and portal hypertension was associated with at least 10% decrease in Hepatic venous 
pressure gradient (HVPG) or reduction to below 12 mmHg in 61% of subjects. PK analysis indicated a 
dose-related but greater than dose-proportional increase in the mean plasma octreotide concentrations 
after administration of 10 mg and 20 mg oral octreotide acetate. PK of oral octreotide acetate in 
subjects with cirrhosis was determined to be similar to the PK in healthy subjects. 
Based on octreotide administered as sc injection data, the elimination capacity may be reduced in 
patients with liver cirrhosis. In study CH-PHT-01, the PK analysis of octreotide after administration of 
10 mg or 20 mg octreotide capsules in subjects with stable cirrhosis and portal hypertension was dose-
related but greater than dose-proportional; other mean plasma octreotide concentrations were  
comparable to the PK in healthy volunteers. 
The proposal that no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with Child Pugh A or B is acceptable as 
there is proposal that the MYCAPSSA dose should be up-titrated based on clinical response.  
Lack of studies in patients with Child Pugh C is addressed and the proposal for careful monitoring of 
these patients initiating treatment with MYCAPSSA is recommended. 
Gender. No specific studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of gender on PK/PD. This is 
acceptable, as no impact from gender is expected.

Race. No specific studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of race on PK/PD. This is 
acceptable, as no impact from race is expected. 
Weight. No specific studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of weight on PK/PD.  
Elderly. No specific studies were conducted in the elderly.  
Children. No specific studies were conducted in children. 
Octreotide PK following administration of octreotide capsules (10 mg or 20 mg) in subjects with stable 
cirrhosis and portal hypertension appears to be similar to the PK observed in healthy volunteers from 
Phase 1 studies. 
Renal function (exposure in subjects with severe renal impairment) was lower than in the matched 
controls, while the patients with ESRD had an increased octreotide exposure). 
Specific studies to evaluate the influence of gender, race, and weight were not conducted. 
Studies in children and elderly were not conducted. 
The PK seems to be sufficiently established in special populations. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The applicant collected data from the SmPc reference drug and indicated that dose adjustments are 
needed when beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, insulin, antidiabetic drugs, or agents to control 
fluid and electrolyte balance are used with octreotide. In addition, octreotide reduces the intestinal 
absorption of ciclosporin, delays it for cimetidine and increases the bioavailability of bromocriptine. 
Also, somatostatin analogues slows cytochrome P450 enzyme mediated drug metabolism. 
Five DDI studies (CHI-005, CHI-006, OCT-02, OCT-03, OCT-04) were conducted to address aspects 
relating specifically to the octreotide capsules formulation (enhancing intestinal permeability) and route 
of administration (via the GI tract). 
In silico studies were not performed. This is acceptable, as no specific concerns are foreseen regarding 
oral administration vs injections. 
Study CHI-005 
Study design. This was a phase 1, open-label, 2-period crossover study in 14 patients that aimed to 
evaluate the bioavailability and PK changes of octreotide after PPI administration (2 days 20 mg 
octreotide with 5 days esomeprazole 40 mg). Safety outcomes were also evaluated.  
Study results. After 6 days of PPI treatment, there was an approximate 40% decrease in the mean 
extent of absorption of octreotide. However, this decrease was highly variable among individual 
subjects, ranging from -1% (minimal or no change) to -86% in 9 of 13 subjects. 
Study OCT- 02 
Study design. This was a phase 1, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-period, 2-sequence crossover 
study in healthy subjects (N=18) to evaluate the bioavailability (BA), PK, BA dependence on ingested 
water volume, and safety of Octreotide (capsules 40 mg) used in conjunction with Digoxin (0.5 mg) 
and Lisinopril (20 mg). 
Study results. Water intake did not significantly change the PK parameters of oral octreotide. 
Concomitant administration of oral octreotide acetate with digoxin does not affect the extent (AUC) of 
digoxin absorption, but the rate of digoxin absorption was decreased. Cmax decreased by 37% and 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 47/130 
 
 
 
Tmax increased from 1 to 3 hours. Concomitant administration of oral octreotide acetate with lisinopril 
resulted in an increase in the extent of lisinopril absorption. Cmax increased by 50% and AUC0-12 
increased by 40%. 
Study CHI-006 
Study design. This was a phase 1, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 2- way (males) or 4-way (females) 
crossover study in healthy subjects (N=20) that aimed to assess the bioavailability (BA), PK, and 
safety of octreotide used in conjunction with octreotide (capsules 40 mg), warfarin (7.5 mg), HCTZ (25 
mg), metformin (850 mg), levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol (0.150 mg/0.030 mg (females only)). 
Study results. The arithmetic mean plasma concentrations and PK parameters of R-warfarin were 
comparable after administration with oral octreotide acetate or with placebo. The arithmetic mean 
plasma concentrations and PK parameters of S-warfarin were comparable after administration with oral 
octreotide acetate or with placebo. The arithmetic mean plasma concentrations of HCTZ over the initial 
5 hours were lower after administration with oral octreotide acetate compared to placebo. The 
arithmetic and geometric mean values for Cmax and AUC0-5 were lower during concomitant 
administration. The arithmetic mean plasma concentrations of metformin over the initial 5 hours 
showed a slower rate of absorption when metformin was administered with oral octreotide acetate. The 
arithmetic mean plasma concentrations and PK parameters of ethinyl oestradiol were comparable after 
administration with oral octreotide acetate or with placebo. The arithmetic mean plasma concentrations 
of levonorgestrel over the initial 3 hours were lower after administration with oral octreotide acetate 
compared to placebo. The arithmetic and geometric mean values for Cmax and AUC0-5 were lower 
during concomitant administration. 
Study OCT-03 
Study design. This was a phase 1, open-label, 5-period, 3-sequence crossover, single dose study 
designed to evaluate the bioavailability of Octreotide (capsules 40 mg) and PK (accounting for body 
posture and night-time administration) metoclopramide (20 mg), loperamide (4 mg) in healthy 
subjects (N=18). 
Study results. Administration of oral octreotide acetate in the morning in a standing position resulted in 
a decrease in the mean plasma concentrations compared to the semi-sitting position. The arithmetic 
mean values for Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUCinf were also decreased when oral octreotide acetate was 
administered in a standing position compared to a sitting position. Administration of oral octreotide 
acetate at night in a semi-sitting position followed by lying resulted in a slower increase in the mean 
plasma concentrations and lower concentrations compared to the morning administration in the semi-
sitting position. The arithmetic mean value for Cmax was reduced after the night administration. 
Administration of oral octreotide at night in a semi-sitting position followed by lying compared to 
administration in the morning in a sitting position resulted in a c.a. 20% decrease in AUCinf in 8 of the 
14 subjects (57%) completing both treatments, no change (< 20% decrease or increase) in 3 subjects 
(21%), and a 20% increase in 3 subjects (21%). Administration of oral octreotide acetate 2 hours after 
a 20 mg oral dose of metoclopramide, a gastroprokinetic agent, resulted in a slight decrease in the 
mean plasma concentrations of octreotide. The arithmetic mean values for Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUCinf 
were also decreased when oral octreotide acetate was administered 2 hours after a 20 mg oral dose of 
metoclopramide. Administration of oral octreotide acetate 2 hours after a 4 mg oral dose of 
loperamide, an antidiarrheal agent that reduces gastric motility, resulted in minimal differences in the 
mean plasma concentrations compared to oral octreotide acetate alone. The arithmetic mean value for 
Cmax was lower, with a GMR of 90.55%.

Study OCT-04    
Study design. This was a phase 1, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, 2-sequence, single dose 
crossover study that aimed to assess the bioavailability and PK of Octreotide (capsules 40 mg) when 
used with cyclosporine (300 mg) and evaluate the safety of such use in healthy subjects (N=18). 
Study results. Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and oral octreotide acetate 40 mg (as 2 × 
20-mg capsules) results in a 60% decrease in the extent of cyclosporine exposure and a decrease in 
the rate of cyclosporine absorption. Coadministration of oral octreotide acetate 40 mg (as 2 × 20-mg 
capsules) and oral cyclosporine 300 mg was safe and well tolerated. 
In Study CHI-005 it was shown that administration of octreotide capsules (20 mg) after 6 days of PPI 
treatment decreases absorption of octreotide, possibly because proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) elevate 
the gastric pH and impairs the capsule’s ability to stay intact until it reaches the small intestine for 
absorption. Thus, the octreotide capsules dose may need to be increased when PPIs, H2-receptor 
antagonists, or antacids are given concomitantly. This is addressed in SmPC. 
In Study OCT-03 it was shown that motility inducer metoclopramide and the motility inhibitor 
loperamide does not change the PK of octreotide. In the study OCT-03 interaction with enhancers and 
inhibitors of gastrointestinal motility was analyzed. The estimates for the Cmax and AUC0-t were about 
90%, however the 90% CIs were wide and were not contained within 80-125%.  
Three DDI studies (OCT-02, OCT-04, CHI-006) evaluated probe drugs that may be affected by 
octreotide capsules (HCTZ, and metformin), drugs with a narrow therapeutic window (digoxin, oral 
contraceptives [ethinyl oestradiol and levonorgestrel], warfarin, and cyclosporine), and low 
permeability drugs (lisinopril and cyclosporine).  
It was revealed that possibly due to the pharmacological GI effects of octreotide capsules may reduce 
the intestinal absorption of concomitantly administered tested drugs, i.e., cyclosporine, digoxin (rate 
more than extend), HCTZ, levonorgestrel). The only drug for which a potential increase in absorption 
was noted was lisinopril. There was a 50% increase in Cmax and a 40% increase in AUC when lisinopril 
was administered concomitantly with octreotide capsules. There is no rationale explaining the increase 
of lisinopril although the same mechanism on increased bioavailability of octreotide in Mycapssa could 
play the role. The trends of changes for lisinopril, digoxin and levonorgestrel are addressed properly in 
SmPC section 4.5. The changes in warfarin, HCTZ, metformin, ethinyl oestradiol, norgestrel, 
metoclopramide, loperamide were only minimal. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials  
Specific pharmacokinetic studies using human biomaterials were not performed. This is acceptable, as 
no specific PK changes are expected for oral formulation as compared to parenteral one. 
2.10.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Based on originator SmPC, in healthy subjects, octreotide inhibits: 
• release of GH stimulated by arginine, exercise- and insulin-induced hypoglycaemia 
• post-prandial release of insulin, glucagon, gastrin, other peptides of the GEP endocrine system, and 
arginine-stimulated release of insulin and glucagon 
• thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-stimulated release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
For octreotide capsules, a PK/PD study (CHI-004) was conducted in 24 volunteers to evaluate the PK of 
a single 20-mg dose  and its effects on  GH  suppression.  Inhibition  of GH was recorded  in all subjects 
receiving octreotide capsules. Administration of a single dose 20 mg dose of octreotide capsules results 
in an approximately 43% decrease in basal GH concentrations as well as an approximately 80% decrease 
in  growth  hormone  releasing  hormone  (GHRH)-induced  GH  concentrations  in  healthy  volunteers.  A 
correlation was noted between octreotide exposure and a decrease in GH. 
Figure 3.3.1.2. Mean ± Standard Error Plasma Concentrations of Octreotide and GH After 
GHRH-Arginine With and Without Octreolin. 
The effects of octreotide capsules on IGF-1 and GH levels were determined in study CH-ACM-01 
where the lack of PK/PD correlation was observed and explained by individual tumour characteristics 
(GH secretion and somatostatin receptors load and sensitivity, somatostatin receptor [SSTR] 2 and 5). 
In clinical practice, somatostatin analogue doses are not titrated to trough levels but titrated based on 
the individual response level. 
In the Phase 3 studies in patients with acromegaly, octreotide capsules were effective as long-term 
maintenance therapy [both biochemical (IGF-1 and GH) and symptomatic control] in patients who 
have responded to and tolerated treatment with parenteral somatostatin analogues. 
There does not appear to be an effect of octreotide on ∆QTcF over the range of concentrations 
observed in this study (Study CH-ACM-01). 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Relationship between plasma concentrations and effect was analysed during Studies CHI-004 (in HV) 
and ACM-01 (in ACM patients). 
Study CHI-004 
For octreotide capsules, a PK/PD study (CHI-004) was conducted in 24 volunteers to evaluate the PK of 
a single 20-mg dose and its effects on GH suppression. Inhibition of GH was recorded in all subjects 
receiving octreotide capsules.

Administration of a single dose of octreotide capsules (20 mg) resulted in an approximately 44% 
decrease in basal GH concentrations as well as an approximately 80% decrease in GHRH-induced GH 
concentrations in healthy volunteers. Although variable, there was a trend toward an increased 
response, i.e. greater decrease in all GH exposure parameters, as exposure to octreotide increased. 
Study CH-ACM-01 
Assessments of the Phase 3 study CH-ACM-01 explored the relationship between achieved octreotide 
concentration (exposure) and therapeutic response (IGF-1 and GH serum levels), and the following 
observations were made: 
• The arithmetic mean  standard error serum GH concentrations were reasonably constant over the 
2.5 to 4 hour period after dosing in all 3 dosing cohorts, with lower concentrations and mean values for 
average concentration (Cav) in the 40-mg cohort than in the 60-mg and 80-mg cohorts. 
• There does not seem to be a relationship between GH Cav and octreotide AUC2-4. 
• There was no apparent relationship between normalised IGF-1 levels and octreotide AUC2-4 (at Visit 
TB6 (end of treatment [EOT] in core treatment phase) with almost complete overlap among the 3 
cohorts — all evaluable patients, responders, and non-responders. (see Figure 3.3.1.3). 
Within the PK substudy population, there were no apparent relationships between normalised IGF-1 
levels and octreotide AUC0-t, AUC0-4, or AUC2-4 at Visit TB2 (i.e. after at least 2 months of receiving a 
therapeutic dose of octreotide capsules), with almost complete overlap among the 3 cohorts — all PK 
substudy population, responders and non-responders. 
•The lack of PK/PD correlation is not unexpected, as response to octreotide is known to be correlated 
to individual tumour characteristics (GH secretion and somatostatin receptors load and sensitivity, 
somatostatin receptors [SSTR] 2 and 5).

Missing profiling of PD effect in ACM population. It is noted that the applicant observed a trend 
towards an increased response (in decrease in all GH exposure parameters) as exposure to octreotide 
increased in HV and no apparent PK/PD relationships in ACM patients after multiple administration. 
However, the majority of results were below the cut-off for both IGF-1 and GH markers. The applicant 
was asked to analyse proportions of factual achievement in pivotal study for both therapeutic PD effect 
as well as clinical symptoms of the disease, such as headache, skin and soft tissue swelling, 
hyperhidrosis, arthralgia, paraesthesia and reflect that in section 5.1 of SmPC. This issue was 
addressed by the applicant and was considered resolved. 
2.10.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology development programme for octreotide capsules consisted of 12 studies (11 
clinical pharmacology studies and 1 Phase 3 study.  
PK 
The absolute bioavailability of Octreotide capsules 20 mg has not been determined in humans.  
The applicant performed six studies where bioavailability was analysed in HV (Studies CHI-001, CHI-
002, CHI-004, CHI-005, OCT-01 and OCT-02 and in one study in ACM (PK sub-study of Study CH-
ACM-01). The sampling time is sufficient to describe bioavailability of both oral and comparator 
octreotide and AUCinf values. 
Two comparative bioavailability (BA) bridging studies between octreotide capsules and sc Sandostatin 
IR 0.1-mg single injection were conducted (studies CHI-001 and CHI-002).  
The PK of octreotide is linear after single-dose administration of octreotide capsules from 3 mg to 40 
mg in healthy subjects under fasted conditions. The median time to maximum plasma concentration 
(Tmax) after oral administration of octreotide capsules 3 mg to 20 mg ranged from 0.67 to 1.67 hours 
and was not dose-dependent. 
The studies with octreotide capsules 20 mg showed rather broad distribution of both Tmax and C max 
values. The applicant acknowledges that a capsule containing 20 mg of octreotide (calculated as free 
base) resulted in a systemic exposure (based on AUC) that was slightly higher than the exposure to a 
0.1-mg dose sc Sandostatin IR. The mean time to maximal absorption values ranged from 1.67 to 3.54 
hrs for capsules in HV and from 1 to 1.5 hrs in ACM for capsules. The mean time to mean maximal 
absorption seems clearly numerically longer as compared to ~0.5 hr for mean maximal absorption 
after SC formulations. However, the mean C max concentrations values were not so different and less 
numerically different between capsules and SC formulations, i.e., mean C max values after 20 mg were 
ranging from ~3 to 8.21 ng/mL after oral and ~3.5 ng/ml after SC formulation of 0.1 mg.  
After correcting for dose, the octreotide apparent BA from fasted oral administration of octreotide 
capsules relative to sc Sandostatin IR was calculated as 0.63%.  
In patients with acromegaly, there was a dose-related increase in the mean plasma octreotide 
concentrations after chronic administration of 40 mg (20 mg bid), 60 mg (40 mg morning / 20 mg 
evening), and 80 mg bid (study CH-ACM-01). 
Octreotide capsules deliver octreotide to the small intestine and reversibly increase intestinal 
paracellular absorption without effecting transcellular absorption. The relative bioavailability of oral 
octreotide compared to sc octreotide was approximately 0.5%.

EMA/796198/2022 
Page 52/130 
 
 
 
 
Food, but not the ingested water volume, decreases the absorption of octreotide from octreotide 
capsules by 90%. Therefore, the octreotide capsules should be administered under fasting conditions 
(at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after a meal). Bioavailability was decreased by approximately 60% 
when octreotide capsules were administered 1 hour before a reduced size high fat meal. In the Phase 3 
clinical studies in patients with acromegaly, octreotide capsules were effective when administered at 
least 1 hour prior to a meal and at least 2 hours after a meal. Therefore, the applicant proposed that 
octreotide capsules should be administered under fasting conditions (at least 1 hour before and 2 
hours after a meal).  
Uncertain method of administration. Study OCT-01 showed that bioavailability was decreased by 
approximately 87% (95% CI, from 5 to 40%) when octreotide capsules were administered 2 hours 
after full high fat meal. This finding might be the reason for such high variability of BA and thus does 
not support the initial proposal made for method administration. It was agreed that the administration 
should be limited to administration one hour before the meal. 
Night dosing may result in decreased exposure (AUC) to octreotide capsules. Food, but not the 
ingested water volume, decreases the absorption of octreotide from octreotide capsules by 90%, when 
octreotide capsules were administered 2 hours after full high fat meal.  
After sc injection, the volume of distribution of octreotide is 0.27 L/kg and the total body clearance 160 
mL/min. Plasma protein binding amounts to 65%. The amount of octreotide bound to blood cells is 
negligible. 
The elimination half-life after sc administration of octreotide is 100 minutes. After iv injection, the 
elimination is biphasic, with half-lives of 10 and 90 minutes. Most of the peptide is eliminated via the 
faeces, while approximately 32% is excreted unchanged into the urine. Considering all PK studies the 
half-life is longer that is consistent with delayed absorption of oral dosage form. The SmPC was 
amended accordingly. 
The PK of octreotide is linear after single-dose administration of octreotide capsules from 3 mg to 40 
mg in healthy subjects under fasted conditions. 
Several factors were found that influence the PK of octreotide capsules: 
(a) meal (high fat/high calorie meal decreases the systemic absorption of octreotide). 
(b) body posture (administration of octreotide capsules at night in a semi-sitting position followed by 
lying resulted in a slower increase in the mean plasma concentrations and lower concentrations 
compared to the morning administration in the semi sitting position and administration of octreotide 
capsules in the morning in a standing position resulted in an average 40% decrease in the extent of 
absorption compared with the sitting position); 
(c) interaction with cyclosporine (decreases the cyclosporine exposure and absorption); 
(d) PPI treatment (esomeprazole use decreases the absorption of octreotide). Octreotide seems to 
decrease hydrochlorothiazide exposure, the rate of exposure of digoxin, and increases the exposure of 
lisinopril; 
(e) renal function (exposure in subjects with severe renal impairment was lower than in the matched 
controls, while the patients with ESRD had an increased octreotide exposure). 
Exposure between healthy subjects and patients with acromegaly was similar, but a longer half-life in 
patients with acromegaly than in healthy volunteers was observed.

PD and PK/PD 
For octreotide capsules, a PK/PD study (CHI-004) was conducted in 24 volunteers to evaluate the PK of 
a single 20-mg dose and its effects on GH suppression. Inhibition of GH was recorded in all subjects 
receiving octreotide capsules. Administration of a single dose 20 mg dose of octreotide capsules 
resulted in an approximately 43% decrease in basal GH concentrations as well as an approximately 
80% decrease in growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH)-induced GH concentrations in healthy 
volunteers. 
The effects of octreotide capsules on IGF-1 and GH levels were determined in study CH-ACM-01 where 
the lack of PK/PD correlation was observed. In clinical practice, somatostatin analogue doses are not 
titrated to trough levels but titrated based on the individual response level. 
In the Phase 3 studies in patients with acromegaly, octreotide capsules were effective as long-term 
maintenance therapy [both biochemical (IGF-1 and GH) and symptomatic control] in patients who 
have responded to and tolerated treatment with parenteral somatostatin analogues. 
Assessments of the Phase 3 study CH-ACM-01 explored the relationship between achieved octreotide 
concentration (exposure) and therapeutic response (IGF-1 and GH serum levels), and the following 
observations were made: 
• The arithmetic mean   standard error serum GH concentrations were reasonably constant over the 
2.5 to 4 hour period after dosing in all 3 dosing cohorts, with lower concentrations and mean values for 
average concentration (Cav) in the 40-mg cohort than in the 60-mg and 80-mg cohorts 
• There does not seem to be a relationship between GH Cav and octreotide AUC2-4. 
• There was no apparent relationship between normalised IGF-1 levels and octreotide AUC2-4 (at Visit 
TB6 (end of treatment [EOT] in core treatment phase) with almost complete overlap among the 3 
cohorts — all evaluable patients, responders, and non-responders.  
Within the PK sub-study population, there were no apparent relationships between normalised IGF-1 
levels and octreotide AUC0-t, AUC0-4, or AUC2-4 at Visit TB2 (i.e. after at least 2 months of receiving 
a therapeutic dose of octreotide capsules), with almost complete overlap among the 3 cohorts — all PK 
sub-study population, responders and non-responders. 
The lack of PK/PD correlation is not unexpected, as response to octreotide is known to be correlated to 
individual tumour characteristics (GH secretion and somatostatin receptors load and sensitivity, 
somatostatin receptors [SSTR] 2 and 5). 
The issue of missing profiling of PD effect in ACM population was raised and the applicant was asked to 
analyse proportions of factual achievement in pivotal study for both therapeutic PD effect as well as 
clinical symptoms of the disease, such as headache, skin and soft tissue swelling, hyperhidrosis, 
arthralgia, paraesthesia. This was also reflected in section 5.1 of SmPC.  
2.10.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Available data do support certain minimal bioavailability and PD effect to those patients who responded 
to oral administration after the switch from s.c. formulation. Mycapssa was considered acceptable from 
clinical pharmacology point of view.

The applicant performed two concurrently controlled (one with active control and one with placebo 
control) and one baseline controlled pivotal studies that is in line with ICH E8 provisions and thus it is 
acceptable.  
2.10.5.1.  Dose response studies 
During the three clinical Phase 3 studies in patients with acromegaly that were designed for the 
evaluation of the efficacy of octreotide capsules a dose escalation part was an integral part. No formal 
dose response studies were performed. This is acceptable, considering dose titration approach 
employed in all three pivotal clinical confirmatory studies. 
2.10.5.2.  Main studies 
Three clinical Phase 3 studies in patients with acromegaly contribute to the evaluation of the efficacy of 
octreotide capsules: OOC-ACM-302, a randomised, open-label, active-controlled, preceded by a run-in 
phase, followed by an OLE phase study, OOC-ACM-303, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, followed by an OLE phase, and CH-ACM-01 a single-arm, baseline-controlled, followed by 
an OLE phase. Thus, the applicant performed two concurrently controlled (one with active control and 
one with placebo control) and one baseline controlled pivotal studies that is in line with ICH E8 
provisions and thus it is acceptable. 
•  Methods 
Study OOC-ACM-302 
Design 
Study OOC-ACM-302 was a randomised, open-label, active-controlled, multicentre study (Core Study) 
with two sub-studies (Combination Phase sub-study and Withdrawal Phase sub-study) with Open Label 
Extension phase, OLE (see Figure 3.3.4.2.1 below). This core study will be discussed as one of main 
studies for this application and it was designed to evaluate maintenance of response, safety, and PROs 
in acromegaly patients treated with octreotide capsules and in patients treated with standard of care 
injectable SRLs, who previously tolerated and demonstrated a biochemical control on both treatments. 
Eligible patients had a confirmed diagnosis of acromegaly, had been treated with SRL injections 
(octreotide or lanreotide monotherapy) for at least 6 months and had been on a stable dose for the 
last 4 months, and were biochemically controlled (IGF-1 < 1.3 x upper limit of normal [ULN] and mean 
integrated GH < 2.5 ng/mL over 2 hours) on their current dose of SRL. IGF-1 and GH were analysed 
centrally throughout the study. Eligible patients were switched to octreotide capsules for a 26-week 
run-in phase. During this phase, the effective dose for each patient was determined through dose 
titration. The octreotide capsule dose was to be increased per investigator’s discretion in the case of 
increased IGF-1 levels, worsening of acromegaly symptoms, or both. Patients whose acromegaly was 
controlled biochemically on octreotide capsules at the end of the run-in phase entered a 36-week 
open-label RCT phase, where they were randomised in a 3:2 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms: continue 
treatment with octreotide capsules (treatment arm 1) or revert to injectable SRL treatment (treatment 
arm 2) as received prior to Screening. Following completion of the core study (Screening, run-in, and 
RCT phases), or study OOC-ACM-303 OLE phase (see below), eligible patients were offered entry into 
the OOC-ACM-302 OLE phase to receive octreotide capsules for up to 5 years or until product 
marketing, or termination of the study by the sponsor.

Location and settings 
Fifty-six study sites were initiated. Twenty-nine study sites in Austria, France, Germany, Hungry, Italy, 
Lithuania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Spain, and the US enrolled at least 1 patient into the Run-in 
phase. The trial was conducted in hospitals and university hospitals. 
The main pivotal study is based on concurrently controlled with active control arm study (Study 302). 
The design of this study is enriching the ACM population by excluding non-responders after the switch 
from parenteral Sandostatin to oral octreotide.

who were biochemically controlled (IGF-1 < 1.3 times ULN and mean integrated GH < 2.5 ng/mL over 
2 hours) at screening, were included in this study. Patients were excluded if were taking injections of 
long-acting SRLs less frequently than once every 8 weeks, or being treated with pegvisomant, 
dopamine, pasireotide, recent radiotherapy or recent pituitary surgery, with cholelithiasis, high-risk 
pattern of pituitary tumour location, unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction, other clinically 
significant uncontrolled disorders (nervous system, GI, renal, pulmonary, diabetes), allergy or 
hypersensitivity to any of the test compounds or materials.  
Study OOC-ACM-303 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria 
Main inclusion criteria were adults ≥ 18 years of age with active acromegaly (defined as documented 
evidence of GH-secreting pituitary tumour based on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]/ pathology 
report and documented evidence of IGF-1 levels ≥ 1.3 times ULN) who, at screening, were receiving 
parenteral SRL monotherapy for at least 6 months with a stable dose for at least the last 3 months and 
who had an average IGF-1 of 2 assessments obtained during the Screening period of ≤ 1 times ULN. 
Main exclusion criteria: patients taking injections of long-acting SRLs off label (unlabelled doses or 
dosing interval; e.g., 60 or 90 mg lanreotide every 8 weeks or 30 mg octreotide every 6 or 8 weeks), 
patients with cholelithiasis, radiotherapy any time in the past, recent pituitary surgery, high-risk 
pattern of pituitary tumour location, unstable medical condition (acute myocardial infarction, nervous 
system, GI, renal, pulmonary, or hepatic concomitant disease), known allergy or hypersensitivity to 
any of the test compounds or materials, or failure to comply.  
Study CH-ACM-01  
Inclusion/exclusion criteria. Adult patients diagnosed with acromegaly who, at screening, were 
receiving a stable dose of a parenteral SRL for at least 3 months and who were considered responders 
to their therapy were eligible for this study. Patients with cholelithiasis, recent pituitary radiotherapy or 
pituitary surgery, high-risk pattern of pituitary tumour location, tumour with neurologic sequalae, 
unstable medical condition (renal, hepatic or other, including recent unstable angina or acute 
myocardial infarction), or otherwise frail and/or non-compliant were excluded from this study. 
The populations were defined appropriately to represent controlled stable non-tumour origin 
acromegaly treatment indication in the maintenance phase. Although patient across all 3 pivotal 
studies differed as regards previous therapies (radio-, or surgical) in general eligibility criteria 
represent target population for the proposed indication. 
•  Treatments 
Study OOC-ACM-302 
Test drug: Octreotide capsules (MYCAPSSA®) were titrated during the Run-in phase from 40 mg (20 
mg twice daily; bid) to 60 mg/day (40 mg in the morning and 20 mg in the evening/night) to 80 
mg/day (40 mg bid), based on clinical and biochemical response. Octreotide capsules were to be 
administered bid with a glass of water (240 mL) on an empty stomach (ie, at least 1 hour prior to a 
meal or at least 2 hours after a meal). Cabergoline (up to 3.5 mg/week per a fixed titration algorithm) 
was co-administered with octreotide capsules 80 mg in the Combination phase sub-study. Patients 
participating in the Combination phase sub-study continued to receive cabergoline (up to 3.5 
mg/week) with octreotide capsules during the Study Extension phase. Reference drug: standard of 
care injectable SRL (octreotide long-acting release [LAR] or lanreotide) according to the individual 
patient use prior to enrolment in the study. The SRLs were provided as injectable suspension.

EMA/796198/2022 
Page 63/130 
 
 
 
 
Study OOC-ACM-303 
Test drug: Mycapssa (octreotide capsule). During the DPC period, octreotide treatment was started at 
a total dose of 40 mg per day (for patients randomised to the octreotide capsule group); it was taken 
orally in 2 doses: one 20 mg capsule in the morning and one 20 mg capsule in the evening/night. Dose 
escalation was based on measurement of the patient’s circulating IGF-1 levels and acromegaly-related 
symptoms. Dose escalation was performed in a stepwise manner from 1 capsule twice daily (bid; 
equivalent to 40 mg/day), to 2 capsules in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening/night (equivalent 
to 60 mg/day), to 2 capsules bid (equivalent to 80 mg/day). Patients were instructed to take the study 
drug with a glass of water (240 mL) on an empty stomach (ie, at least 1 hour prior to a meal or at 
least 2 hours after a meal). 
Study CH-ACM-01  
Test drug: Oral octreotide acetate, 20 mg, in an enteric-coated capsule (MYCAPSSA). Oral octreotide 
treatment was started at a total dose of 40 mg per day; it was to be taken by mouth in two doses: 20 
mg in the morning and 20 mg in the evening/night. Patients were instructed to take the study 
medication at least 1 hour prior to a meal and at least 1 to 2 hours after a meal. 
In all 3 studies starting dose was the same (40 mg) with somewhat different instruction for method of 
administration - patients were instructed to take the study drug with a glass of water (240 mL) on an 
empty stomach i.e., at least 1 hour prior to a meal or at least 2 hours after meal in Studies 302 and 
303 and (as it is proposed in MAA) whereas “at least 1 hour prior to a meal and at least 1 to 2 hours 
after a meal”. This is acceptable as far, as for main studies that are Studies 302 and 303. Study ACM-
01 contributes as exploratory study only. 
•  Objectives 
Study OOC-ACM-302. The study aimed to assess maintenance of biochemical control and safety of 
octreotide capsules compared to parenteral SRLs in patients with acromegaly. Since all enrolled 
patients were required to be responders to injectable SRLs on Screening, the objective of the 
Randomised, Controlled Treatment (RCT) phase was to compare long-term maintenance of biochemical 
control in patients responding to octreotide capsules at the end of the Run-in phase to patients 
responding to injectable SRLs (on Screening). 
Study OOC-ACM-303. The primary objective of this study was to assess maintenance of biochemical 
control with octreotide capsules compared to placebo in patients with acromegaly who previously 
demonstrated biochemical control on SRLs. 
Study CH-ACM-01. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
MYCAPSSA as maintenance therapy in patients with acromegaly who were responders to a stable dose 
of a parenteral SRLs. Additional objectives were to assess treatment satisfaction with parenteral 
somatostatin analogues vs. oral therapy and to determine the PK profile of MYCAPSSA during chronic 
treatment. 
The objectives of the Studies are focused on assessment of comparative maintenance of biochemical 
control (in studies 302 and 303) vs baseline maintenance. Study 302 objective does comply with EMA 
SA given to the applicant and thus is acceptable for confirmatory purpose.

•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Study OOC-ACM-302 
The primary efficacy endpoint (in line with EMA SA) was the proportion of patients who were 
biochemically controlled throughout the RCT phase. A patient was considered biochemically controlled 
if his or her IGF-1 time weighted average (TWA) during the RCT phase was < 1.3 times ULN. 
The use of TWA response over time is a simple longitudinal data analysis approach intended to 
minimise the number of missing patients from a primary effectiveness analysis and to account for 
natural variation among the measure of interest that may be observed over the time period of 
monitoring. The TWA response over the treatment period represents an integrated measure of efficacy 
across time. It is derived as the area under the curve (AUC) divided by the total amount of time under 
observation between the first and last IGF-1 value. 
The applicant also included additional primary endpoints for in line with the request from the FDA 
(hereinafter referred to as exploratory landmark analyses) those were as follows: 
• Run-in phase – Proportion of patients biochemically controlled at the end of the Run-in phase, 
defined as IGF-1 < 1.3 times ULN (based on the average of week 24 and week 26) 
• RCT phase – Proportion of patients on octreotide capsules who were biochemically controlled at the 
end of the RCT phase, defined as IGF-1 < 1.3 times ULN (based on the average of week 62 and week 
58). 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were as follows: 
1.  The proportion of patients who were biochemically controlled throughout the RCT phase (IGF-1 
TWA during the RCT phase was < 1.3 times ULN); 
2.  Proportion of patients with clinical and biochemical response at the end of the RCT phase  
(week 62/EOT). Patients were considered controlled if they met both of the following criteria: 
a)  Biochemically controlled if their IGF-1 TWA during the RCT phase was < 1.3 times ULN; b) 
Clinically controlled if their AIS score at week 62/EOT was maintained or reduced compared to 
week 26 (start of RCT phase); 
3.  Proportion of patients who maintained or reduced the overall number of active acromegaly 
symptoms at the end of the RCT phase (week 62/EOT) compared to week 26  (start of RCT 
phase);  
4.  Proportion of patients who maintained or improved their overall AIS score at the end of  the 
RCT phase (improvement defined as a reduction of at least 1 point in the AIS score),  
compared to week 26 (start of RCT phase);  
5.  Change from baseline (week 36) in Acromegaly Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ACRO-

9.  Shift in response categories at the end of the RCT phase (week 62/EOT) compared to week 26

Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints included the assessment of improvement in the overall AIS score, 
acromegaly symptoms change, proportion of patients with TWA IGF-1 ≤ 1 times ULN and others. 
Data on adverse reactions, vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical and instrumental (e.g. ultrasound) 
examination and clinical laboratory assessments were also collected during this study.  
Several PRO questionnaires were used as well: Acromegaly Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire 
(ACRO-TSQ); EuroQol – 5 Dimensions – 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) and The Work productivity questionnaire 
(WPAI). 
Study OOC-ACM-303 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained their biochemical 
response at the end of the DPC phase. Maintenance of response was defined by using the average IGF-
1 level of the last 2 available assessments (analysed centrally) between Weeks 34 and 36 in the DPC 
phase. If the average IGF-1 was ≤1 x ULN, a patient was classified as a responder (i.e. maintained 
their biochemical response). If the average IGF-1 was >1 x ULN, a patient was classified as a non-
responder. Patients who discontinued study drug during the DPC phase for any reason were classified 
as non-responders for the primary analysis, regardless of their IGF-1 values. 
Study CH-ACM-01  
The primary efficacy endpoint was: Concentrations of IGF-1 and mean GH over 2 hours at the end of 
the Core Treatment Period as a measure of response in the modified Intention-to-Treat (mITT) 
Population. Response was defined as IGF-1 < 1.3 times ULN adjusted for age and an integrated GH 
levels over 2 hours < 2.5 ng/mL. 
The chosen primary endpoints are clinically meaningful, in line with EMA SA given for pivotal 
confirmatory purpose in the planned indication (in Study 302) and are therefore endorsed. 
•  Sample size 
Study OOC-ACM-302. The sample size was determined based on the CHMP advice to include 150 
patients to be enrolled into the Run-in phase of the study to ensure a minimum of 80 patients would 
enter the RCT phase, with approximately 48 patients assigned to octreotide capsule arm and 32 
patients assigned to SRL injection arm. The CHMP also recommended an unbalanced randomisation 
(3:2) to maximise data collected from treatment with octreotide capsules in the comparative setting 
and enhance the octreotide capsule treatment safety database. An assessment of non-inferiority (NI) 
was made by comparing the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in biochemical 
control (octreotide capsules - SRL) to a NI margin of -20%, based on prior studies with SRLs that 
showed maintenance of response between 80-90% as well as on information provided in the 
Cerdelga® European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) where the EMA accepted a -20% NI margin for 
Cerdelga, an oral drug, compared to an injectable drug in an orphan population (Gaucher disease). 
Study OOC-ACM-303. The ex-ante power was determined based on an assumed sample of 50 patients, 
with 25 in each arm. Power was determined to be at least 80% even under conservative assumptions 
of a 10% false-response and 50% true response rate (lower than even in the initial trials). The final 
study sample was a bit larger with 56 total. An assessment of superiority was made using an exact 
logistic regression model, with covariates for treatment, baseline SRL dose (low vs mid or high) and 
baseline IGF-1 level (<median vs ≥median). 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 66/130 
 
 
 
 
Study CH-ACM-01. This was an open-label study control used to establish the safety profile and 
maintenance profile of the drug. A total of 155 patients were enrolled. Experts in the field determined 
that the response rate of 50% would be reasonable, and statistical calculations bore out that this size 
would exhibit sufficient power. At least 150 evaluable patients were to be enrolled in this study. 
The approaches used for determining sample size in the OOC-ACM-302, OOC-ACM-303, CH-ACM-01 
study were appropriate given the information at the time and are endorsed. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Study OOC-ACM-302. Patients using SRLs who completed the 6-months run-in phase (116 [79,5%]) 
were randomised into the treatment group. 30 patients (20.5%) discontinued. Most frequent reasons 
for discontinuation during the run in phase were treatment failure (5.5%) and adverse events (9.6%; 
mostly mild to moderate gastrointestinal events). The odds of being randomised decreased with 
increasing IGF-1 level. The CHMP recommended an unbalanced 3:2 randomisation as well. The study 
utilised a centralised stratified randomisation based on the following variables on week 24 of the Run-
in phase: (1) IGF-1 ≤ 1 times ULN vs IGF-1 > 1 times ULN to < 1.3 times ULN and (2) Octreotide 
capsule treatment dose at week 24 (40 mg vs 60 mg or 80 mg). This was an open-Label study. 
Study OOC-ACM-303. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio across all centres. Patients were 
stratified by previous treatment dosing level (low or mid/high). This was a double-blind, placebo-
controlled study. Treatment allocation was not revealed before database lock, after the last patient had 
completed the DPC period. 
Study CH-ACM-01 Randomisation was not appropriate for the study objective, which was to 
demonstrate long-term safety and maintenance characteristics of the treatment. This was an open-
Label study. 
The randomisation methods in the two pivotal trials (Study 302 and 303) were appropriate given their 
different objectives (active comparison, causality and efficacy, safety and maintenance). The 
approaches are endorsed. The blinding, where it was applied, was done so appropriately. 
•  Statistical methods 
Study OOC-ACM-302 
This study was an actively controlled multi-centre RCT for patients with acromegaly between 18 and 75 
years of age, who were biochemically controlled under SRL exhibiting an IGF-1 < 1.3 ULN and GH < 
2.5 ng/mL over 2 hours. 135 patients entered in the run-in phase, 81 remained in the RCT phase, with 
34 in the control group, and 47 in the treatment group. Additional subgroup analysis was performed 
for gender, region, age, baseline characteristics. 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were biochemically controlled; this mirrors 
the common practice of monitoring patients’ IGF using SRL. 
The test of the primary end-point was non-inferiority margin at the 20% level at 95% confidence, 
adjusted for baseline values using the Miettinen & Nurminen method.  
No interim analyses of efficacy were planned, but there were interim safety analyses done to comply 
with FDA practices.  
The population, surrogate endpoint under active control, and NI inferiority level are appropriately 
chosen. The statistical approach for study OOC-ACM-302 is endorsed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 67/130 
 
 
 
 
 
Study OOC-ACM-303. This study looks at whether the proportion of patients in the treatment group 
maintaining biochemical response differs from the placebo control. Given baseline differences in IGF-1 
and response, the proportions of where adjusted using logistic regression. The study uses Newcombe’s 
proportion test to determine the adjusted proportions. 
The population, placebo control, and endpoint measurement are appropriately chosen. While the 
covariate adjustment using logistic regression (rather than sufficiently sized subgroups) is less than 
ideal, it is statistically reasonable. The statistical approach for study OOC-ACM-303 is acceptable for 
showing clinical efficacy in maintenance. 
Study CH-ACM-01. This study looks at the proportion of responders at end of treatment. Subgroup 
analysis included age, gender, and renal function, which was appropriate given safety as a primary 
motivation for the study. 
Worth noting are the number of patients withdrawing and resuming their baseline treatment. The 
sponsor was requested to specify the proportion test or method of constructing the confidence 
intervals used to assess the primary endpoint in CH-ACM-01. The Clopper-Pearson (Exact) method was 
used to estimate the 95% confidence intervals for the primary endpoint in study CH-ACM-01. This was 
considered acceptable.  
The statistical approaches were endorsed. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
Study OOC-ACM-302 
From the 146 patients enrolled into the 26-week Run-in phase (see Table 3.3.4.2.1 and Figure 3.3.4.2.4) 
and who received at least 1 dose of study drug (octreotide capsules), a total of 116 patients (79.5%) 
completed  the  Run-in  phase  and  30  patients  (20.5%)  discontinued  the  Run-in  phase.  Reasons  for 
discontinuation  were  TEAE  (14  patients  [9.6%]);  treatment  failure  (8  patients  [5.5%]),  3  of  whom 
entered  the  Combination  phase;  withdrawal  by  patient  (6  patients  [4.1%]);  Investigator  request  (1 
patient, 0.7%]); and protocol deviation (1 patient, 0.7%]).  
Of the 116 patients who completed the Run-in phase, 92 patients (79.3%) entered the RCT phase, 11 
(9.4%) entered the Combination phase, and 13 (11.2%) did not continue treatment. Eleven of the 13 
patients who did not continue treatment were ineligible for the RCT phase or Combination phase.

Of the 55 patients assigned to the octreotide capsule group, 54 patients (98.2%) completed the RCT 
phase and 1 patient (1.8%) discontinued treatment due to a TEAE. 34 patients (63.0%) elected to 
continue into the Study Extension phase. Of the 37 patients assigned to the SRL injection group, 35 
patients (94.6%) completed the RCT phase. Two patients chose to withdraw from the study during the 
RCT phase for personal reasons.

Study OOC-ACM-303 
A total of 119 patients were screened for this study (see Figure 3.3.4.2.6.). Fifty-six patients (47.1%) 
completed the screening; 28 were randomly assigned to the octreotide capsule group and 28 were 
randomly assigned to the placebo group. All 56 enrolled patients completed the DPC period. Thirty 
patients completed the DPC period on study drug (21 patients [75.0%] in the octreotide capsule group 
and 9 patients [32.1%] in the placebo group). Overall, 26 patients discontinued study drug treatment 
during the DPC and required rescue medication (7 patients [25.0%] in the octreotide capsule group 
and 19 patients [67.9%] in the placebo group).

Two hundred and thirty-five patients were screened for this study (see Figure 3.3.4.2.7); of these 
patients, 155 were enrolled for participation.

Patients  were  involved  into  the  core  studies  as  per  sample  size  required  in  all  three  pivotal  studies. 
Participant  flows  shows  consistent  high  treatment  discontinuation  rate  across  all  three  trials  due  to 
treatment inefficacy and adverse events. 
1.  In  the  study  OOC-ACM-302  a  total  of  116  patients  (79.5%)  completed  the  Run-in  phase  and  30 
patients (20.5%) discontinued the Run-in phase. Reasons for discontinuation  were  TEAE  (14 patients 
[9.6%]); treatment failure (8 patients [5.5%]). Of the 55 patients assigned to the octreotide capsule 
group, 54 patients (98.2%) completed the RCT phase and 1 patient (1.8%) discontinued treatment due 
to a TEAE. 
2. In the  study  OOC-ACM-303 twenty-six  patients discontinued  study  drug  treatment during  the DPC 
period  and  required  rescue  medication  (7  patients  [25.0%]  in  the  octreotide  capsule  group  and  19 
patients [67.9%] in the placebo group). 
3. In the study CH-ACM-01, sixteen patients discontinued early during the Dose Escalation Phase due to 
adverse events; 10 of those early terminations were due to GI side effects. 
Unknown  real  failure  rate  after  switching  in  study  302.  The  enrichment  design  applied  to  RCT 
Phase  from  Run-in  Phase  (EAS)  excluded  8  Mycapssa  treatment  failures  and  unknown  number  of 
treatment failures from the 14 patients withdrawn due to ADR and 24 patients who completed Run-in

Phase but were excluded from RCT phase and entered into combination phase. The individual IGF-1 and 
GH  test  results  could  not  initially  be  retrieved  from  the  application.  The  applicant  has  provided  the 
requested data. The data from the Run-in phase suggest that ~64% to 78% of patients will respond to 
treatment with octreotide capsules. 
Possibly too low comparative efficacy due to high withdrawal rate during switch (run-in) period. One fifth 
of patients (30/116) discontinued from the switch period of Study 302. More than half of discontinued 
patients were due to TEAE (14 patients) or treatment failures (8 patients). Although primary analysis is 
performed  from  all  of  the  55  patients  assigned  to  the  octreotide  capsule  group,  this  approach  is  not 
representative  to  future  clinical  use,  where  efficacy  should  be  known  before  switching  to  alternative 
treatment. The applicant is asked to address the issue of limited efficacy after the switch. About 30-40% 
of  patients  switching  from  SRL  to  Mycapssa  loose  biochemical  control  and  are  considered  to  be  non-
responders. The applicant was requested to justify the acceptability of this responder rate and to analyse 
whether non-responders can be identified based on their demographic/disease characteristics in order 
to refine the target population to avoid futile switches. This issue was addressed by the applicant and is 
currently considered as resolved. This medicinal product can be beneficial for patients who respond to 
octreotide capsules and reduce the need for injections and associated inconveniences. The patients that 
fail the oral therapy trial can be reverted to injectable treatment options.

Changes to the planned analyses outlined in the SAP 
1. The primary analysis specified the adjusted 95% CIs would be obtained using the stratified Newcombe 
method but the stratified Miettinen & Nurminen method using Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) weights 
was used instead because the results of the study did not allow the Miettinen & Nurminen method to be 
used due to the presence of 0’s in some strata. 
2.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  for  the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  (e.g.  Patients  were 
randomised at week 26 (Baseline of the RCT phase) based on IGF-1 and GH values collected at week 
24. Analyses were conducted using a subset of the FAS that only included patients who met the IGF-1

and GH inclusion criteria using week 26 values (Baseline of the RCT phase). These analyses were referred 
to as Week 26 Responders). 
Study OOC-ACM-303. The study was initiated with Protocol Version 4. The protocol subsequently was 
amended twice. The amendments changed the order of the secondary objectives and secondary efficacy 
endpoints; added an exploratory endpoint  (i.e.,  proportion of patients who require  rescue  medication 
[e.g., re-initiate SRL treatment]), modified the definition of the FAS. 
Study CH-ACM-01. During protocol amendments pituitary MRI versus brain MRI was specified, additional 
testing  planned  (e.g.  anti-octreotide  antibodies),  new  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  of  proportion  of 
patients with both normalised IGF-1 levels (adjusted for age) and mean integrated GH over 2 hours < 
2.5 ng/mL was added, 6-month Extension Treatment Period was added. Some endpoints were modified 
after interaction with regulatory agencies. 
The changes to the planed analyses do not seem to impair the overall validity of the clinical trial. 
•  Baseline data 
Study OOC-ACM-302 
Patients’  mean  age  at  screening  for  the  run-in  phase  for  study  OOC-ACM-302  was  54.1  years.  Most 
patients  were  Caucasian  (91.1%),  and  about  two  thirds  were  female  (64.4%).  The  demographic 
characteristics  of  patients  in  the  RCT  phase  were  similar  to  those  in  the  run-in  phase.  Also,  the 
demographic  characteristics  were  well  balanced  between  the  octreotide  capsules  group  and  the  SRL 
injections group. (See Table 3.3.4.2.4)

•  Treatment compliance  
Study OOC-ACM-302. Mean octreotide capsule compliance was 96.3% during the Run-in phase. Across 
dose groups, 95.9% of patients were 75-100% compliant with their study medication. Drug compliance 
during the RCT phase was similar between the octreotide capsule group (98.5%) and the SRL injection 
group (98.3%). 
Study OOC-ACM-303. In both treatment groups patients were ≥ 75% compliant with the study drug 
dosing regimen. Thirty patients completed the DPC period on study drug (21 patients [75.0%] in the 
octreotide capsule group and 9 patients [32.1%] in the placebo group). Twenty-six patients 
discontinued study drug treatment during the DPC period and required rescue medication (7 patients 
[25.0%] in the octreotide capsule group and 19 patients [67.9%] in the placebo group). 
Study CH-ACM-01 
In study patients >95% of patients were ≥ 75% compliant with the study drug dosing regimen.  
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics data do not indicate any asymmetry in characteristics 
across treatment arms. The study population reflects the intended indication well.  
Across trials the study compliance was good.

Across trials there was a high treatment discontinuation rate across trials due to treatment inefficacy 
and adverse events (see comments in section Participant flow above). 
The applicant was invited to discuss reasons for the high discontinuation rate in CH-ACM-01, including 
differences in populations of the three clinical studies. The applicant clarified that the higher 
discontinuation rates in study CH-ACM-01 (34%), compared to  Studies OOC-ACM-303 and OOC-ACM-
3032 (25% and 20.5%) was mainly related to GI AEs. The applicant’s response is acceptable. 
•  Outcomes and estimation 
Study OOC-ACM-302 
Primary endpoint results 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who were biochemically controlled 
throughout the RCT phase. A patient was considered biochemically controlled if his or her IGF-1 TWA 
during the RCT phase was <1.3 x ULN.  
Overall, 90.9% of patients in the octreotide capsules group maintained biochemical control (95% CI 
80.0, 97.0) compared to 100% of patients in the SRL injections group (95% CI 90.5, 100). The lower 
bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the adjusted difference (octreotide capsules minus SRL injections) in

Secondary endpoint results 
65.5% of patients in the octreotide capsules group and 73.0% of patients in the SRL injections group 
were clinically and biochemically controlled at the end of the RCT phase (adjusted treatment 
difference: -6.8%; 95% CI -25.3, 13.2). 
The overall proportion of patients with a reduced overall number of active acromegaly symptoms at the 
end of the run-in phase compared to baseline was 30.8% (95% CI: 23.3, 38.3); the number of 
symptoms was maintained in 35.6% of patients. Thus, the proportion of patients with a maintained or 
reduced overall number of active acromegaly symptoms at the end of the run-in phase compared to 
baseline was 66.4% (95% CI: 58.8, 74.1). 
Overall, 74.5% of patients in the octreotide capsules group and 70.3% of patients in the SRL injections 
group maintained or reduced their overall number of active acromegaly symptoms at the end of the 
RCT phase compared to Week 26 (adjusted treatment difference: 4.6%; 95% CI -13.6, 23.9).

Mean Acromegaly Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire ACRO-TSQ scales during RCT phase were 
generally comparable between the 2 treatment groups. However, numerical changes in Emotional 
Reaction, Treatment Convenience, and Treatment Satisfaction consistently favoured octreotide 
capsules. A significant difference between treatment groups was seen for Treatment Convenience, 
where a significantly greater deterioration was found in the SRL injections group for the average effect 
during the RCT phase (p = 0.040; Figure 3.3.4.2.8.)

WPAI:SHP domain scores were generally comparable between the 2 treatment groups at the end of the 
RCT phase; none of the differences was statistically significant. 
Study OOC-ACM-303 
The primary efficacy endpoint of study OOC-ACM-303 was the proportion of patients who maintained 
their biochemical response at the end of the DPC phase. Maintaining biochemical response was defined 
as having an average IGF-1 ≤1 x ULN. 
Overall, 58.2% of the patients in the octreotide capsules group vs 19.4% of the patients in the placebo 
group maintained their biochemical response at the end of the DPC phase; the difference between the 
2 groups was statistically significant (p = 0.0079), with an odds ratio of 5.77 in favour of octreotide 
capsules.

1  Patients who discontinued study drug during the DPC phase for any reason were classified as non-responders. 
2  Adjusted proportions and odds ratios were obtained from an exact logistic regression model including covariates 
for treatment  
group,  baseline  SRL  dose  (low  versus  medium  or  high)  and  baseline  IGF-1  level  (<  median,  ≥ 
median). CI for difference in adjusted proportions used Newcombe method. 
The applicant was asked to discuss reasons for differences in the percentage of patients who 
maintained their biochemical response between studies 302 and 303. The applicant responded that 
generally, maintenance of response in patients responding to octreotide capsules as well as initial 
response to octreotide capsules following switch from iSRLs were comparable between studies OOC-
ACM-302 and OOC-ACM-303. Observed differences were mainly related to the differences in numbers 
of discontinuations from both studies. The applicant’s response is acceptable. 
Study CH-ACM-01 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of responders (IGF-1 <1.3 × ULN and GH <2.5 ng/mL) 
at  the  end  of  the  core  treatment  phase.  Of  the  151  patients  in  the  mITT  population,  64.9%  were 
responders at the end of the core treatment phase. See Table 3.3.2.6.3.)

Primary analysis of pivotal studies show that the capsules exert certain efficacy in maintaining 
biochemical control in some ACM patients and for those, in whom maintenance is achieved this can 
have a non-inferior effect to the injectable formulation.  
The individual test results for primary endpoints of the pivotal study could not be retrieved from 
submission dossier. The applicant did not comply with the advice from CHMP to use full normalisation 
of IGF-1 for primary endpoint analysis. The applicant was asked to present all test results for primary 
and co-primary analyses for Study 302. The applicant has provided the requested data. The applicant 
did not perform additional analysis that would duplicate the already conducted analyses. The applicant 
conducted an analysis to show the results under full normalisation of IGF-1. This was considered 
acceptable.  
Unjustified robustness of statistical significance of NI. NI of 20% was shown with 95% CI (M&N) 
of (-19.9, 0.5), Table 21 of Study 302 CSR, p. 112. Three patients were withdrawn from RCT – one in 
Mycapssa arm (due to ADR) and two in SRL arm (patient decision on Day 379 and Day 253). The 
individual primary efficacy data are not retrieved from the application. The applicant was asked: 
a) To provide case report forms for all three withdrawn patients from both Mycapssa and SRL arms.  
b) To provide individual primary endpoint related test results for all participated in RCT phase in excel 
format;  
c) To reanalyze primary endpoint considering three scenarios and two cut-off values: (1) SRL arm 
adjusted for both excluded patients from SRL arm to be treated as responders (using BOCF analysis) 
and Mycapssa arm remains as it is; (2) Mycapssa arm adjusted for excluded patient form Mycapssa 
arm (due to ADR) to be treated based on LOCF analysis and SRL arm remains as it is; and (3) both 
arms are adjusted in the same manner as it is proposed in (1) and (2). These calculations were 
performed, and these issues were addressed by the applicant and are considered resolved. 
•  Ancillary analyses 
Study OOC-ACM-302 
The results of the sensitivity analyses in Week 26 responders, PP, FAS (ET-TF) populations assessed 
the robustness of the primary analysis to show similar non-inferiority of primary endpoint (above -
20%).

GH response 
OOC-ACM-303 Phase 3 
Proportion of patients who maintained GH response (ie, GH < 2.5 ng/mL) at week 36, out of those who were responders (ie, GH < 2.5 ng/mL) on 
SRL injections at screening.  
Seventy-eight percent (77.7%) of patients treated with octreotide capsules maintained their GH levels below 2.5 ng/mL at the end of the DPC 
period vs 30.4% on placebo (p = 0.0007)  
Time to loss of response, IGF-1 > 1 times ULN.  
The time to loss of response (IGF-1 > 1 times ULN) was significantly greater in the octreotide capsule group (median > 36 weeks) vs the placebo 
group (median = 16 weeks) (p < 0.0001).

Change in IGF-1. 
The time to loss of response (IGF-1 ≥ 1.3 times ULN) was significantly greater in the octreotide capsule group (median > 36 weeks) vs the 
placebo group (median = 16 weeks) (p < 0.0001). 
Proportion of patients who began rescue treatment prior to and including week 36.  
Seventy-five percent (75%) of patients treated with octreotide capsules did not require rescue medication with injectable SRLs (octreotide LAR or 
lanreotide depot) anytime throughout the core study vs 32.1% of patients treated with placebo (p = 0.0029). 
Change from Baseline (screening assessment) to end of treatment in mean GH.  
The observed mean change from Baseline (Screening assessment) in GH level, including data on rescue medications, was -0.03 ng/mL in the 
octreotide capsule group and 0.18 ng/mL in the placebo group. The median change in both groups was zero from Screening to end of study. The 
mean GH of all patients treated with octreotide capsules (both responders and non-responders) at the end of treatment was maintained below 1 
ng/mL (mean = 0.60 ng/mL) while it was > 2.5 ng/mL in the placebo group (mean = 2.57 ng/mL).  
Change from Baseline (average of 2 assessments within 2 weeks prior to randomisation) to end of treatment in IGF-1.   
The observed IGF-1 mean change from Baseline to the end of study, including data on rescue medications, was 0.13 times ULN in the octreotide 
capsule group and 0.13 times ULN in the placebo group. The median change from Baseline to end of study in the octreotide capsule group and 
placebo group was 0.0 and 0.1 times ULN, respectively.

2.10.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
Designated clinical studies were not conducted in special populations. 
Efficacy in subpopulations of study OOC-ACM-302 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary efficacy endpoint (proportion of patients who were 
biochemically controlled throughout the RCT phase) based on the patient’s age, gender, region, RCT 
baseline IGF-1, and RCT baseline response. The primary endpoint results were similar in subgroups 
based on gender, region, and age (Figure 3.3.4.4.1.). Note that no patients 75 years of age or older 
were enrolled into the RCT phase.

The applicant performed efficacy assessments in male/females and several different age groups. These 
analyses did not reveal essential differences in efficacy. There is no proposal for special dosage in the 
elderly population. The SmPC of Sandostatin states that “There is no evidence of reduced tolerability or 
altered dosage requirements in elderly patients treated with Sandostatin.” The applicability of this 
recommendation to Mycapssa was confirmed by the applicant during the procedure.

Maintenance of response in phase 3 studies was presented in Table 3.3.4.6.  
No pooled analyses or meta-analysis as performed, assumingly due to differences in the definition of 
the efficacy endpoints. This was considered acceptable. 
2.10.5.6.  Supportive studies 
OOC-ACM-302 additional sub studies. 
Study Extension Phase. 34 of the 54 patients who completed the RCT phase (63.0%) from the 
octreotide capsule group elected to continue into the Study Extension phase for an additional 12 
months. Of the 35 patients who completed the RCT phase after switching from injectable SRLs to 
octreotide capsules on Baseline and then switching back to injectable SRLs at the beginning of the 
RCT, 18 patients (51.4%) elected to switch again from injectable SRLs to octreotide capsules and 
entered the Study Extension phase.  
Combination Phase Sub-study. Cabergoline (up to 3.5 mg/week per a fixed titration algorithm) was 
co-administered with octreotide capsules 80 mg in the Combination phase sub-study. All 8 patients 
(100%) who completed the Combination phase maintained or improved their IGF-1 category from 
Combination Phase Baseline to the end of the Combination phase. 
OOC-ACM-303 OLE Study 
This clinical study report addendum summarises the data from the first 48 weeks of the open-label 
extension (OLE) of study OOC-ACM-303. Forty patients (20 from each treatment group in the double-
blind, placebo-controlled [DPC] period) were enrolled into the OLE. As of the 12 May 2020 data cut-off 
date, all ongoing patients completed 48 weeks of the OLE. 
• 90% of patients enrolled into the OLE who were treated with octreotide capsules during the DPC 
period (n = 20) completed 48 weeks in the OLE.  
• Patients who completed the DPC period on octreotide capsules maintained their insulin-like growth 
factor 1 (IGF-1) level at the end of the 48 weeks OLE (0.91 times upper limit of normal [ULN] at 
baseline and 0.90 times ULN at 48 weeks).

FU study CH-ACM-01 
This study was a follow-up, retrospective, non-interventional study in patients with acromegaly who 
previously participated in and completed the Chiasma CH-ACM-01 study. No study drug was 
administered. 
Two groups were recruited: (1) patients who had not restarted acromegaly therapy and patients whose 
data are missing regarding treatment initiation at the end of the 2- week follow-up period; (2) all 
MYCAPSSA responders who restarted acromegaly therapy after completing the CH-ACM-01 study. Of 
the 155 patients who participated in CH-ACM-01, 149 patients (96.2%) have restarted acromegaly 
treatment, 3 patients (1.9%) have not re-initiated treatment, and no data are available for the 
remaining 3 patients (1.9%): 2 patients died, and 1 patient refused to sign an informed consent. 
Analysis of retained follow-up serum samples Twenty-four of the 51 patients (with evaluable samples, 
who had not re-initiated medical treatment with SRLs before the follow-up serum sample was 
collected), had IGF-1 ≥ 1.3 times ULN from the retained serum sample collected during the 
approximate 2-week follow-up period. Thus, overall, 36 (24+2+10) of 51 patients (70.6%) lost IGF-1 
control within 2 weeks following cessation of treatment 
2.10.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical efficacy data was collected from 3 trials: (1) OOC-ACM-302 a Phase 3 Randomised, open-
label, active-controlled, preceded by a run-in phase, followed by an OLE phase trial, (2) OOC-ACM-303 
a Phase 3 Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, followed by an OLE phase, and (3) CH-ACM-
01 Phase 3 Single-arm, baseline-controlled, followed by an OLE phase. The design of the studies was 
adequate and the populations were adequately selected. The active control trial used an appropriate 
comparator, i.e. the same active substance administered s/c that can be regarded as standard of care. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The main issue during the assessment that constituted an overarching major objection was connected 
to the points noted in the clinical pharmacology section and in the efficacy section: the applicant 
proposes a novel oral formulation of octreotide that has similar bioavailability as described for 
subcutaneously injectable somatostatin analogue (2 mg of octreotide orally administered was 
comparable to subcutaneous injection of 50 micrograms [20 mg would be comparable to 0.5 mg sc] 
while the proposed octreotide capsule 20 mg was comparable to 0.1 mg octreotide sc in systemic 
exposure [AUC]). Due to quite variable bioavailability the octreotide does not seem constantly reaching 
therapeutical values in all populations and that is why a substantial number of switched ACM patients 
do not maintain efficacy and withdraw due to failure. Due to possibly too low comparative efficacy 
likely related to high withdrawal rate during switch (run-in) period, one major objection was raised. 
This major objection was addressed by the applicant and is currently considered to be resolved (see 
below).  
Mycapssa showed NI against standard of care (SRL inj) by primary Biochemical control in 50/55 
[90,9%] vs 37/37 [100%] of patients with a difference [95%CI] of -9.1% [-19.9, 0.5], measured by 
IGF-1 <1.3xULN TWA during the RCT phase in Study 302. This primary effect was supported by a 
number of secondary endpoints: Proportion of ACM patients with Clinical control (measured by AIS 
score) as well as with co-secondary Clinical and Biochemical control effects with difference [95%CI] 
between Mycapssa and SRL inj of 5.4% [-13.2, 25.2] and -6.8% [-25.3, 13.2], respectively. The 
primary efficacy analysis was supported also by clinical superiority effect over placebo shown in 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 104/130 
 
 
 
 
another pivotal Study 303 in measuring responder analyses maintaining average IGF-1 1xULN with 
difference [95%CI] of 38.74% [10.68, 59.90]. 
The primary effect observed in Study 302 was considered as clinically relevant, because the NI with 
margin of 20% was not exceeded. 
Major issues raised was the risk of possibly too low comparative efficacy due to high withdrawal rate 
during switch (run-in) period.  
It was noted that 30-40% of patients switching from SRL to Mycapssa do not benefit from the switch. 
The applicant was requested to provide the reasons for discontinuation or decision not to randomise 
these patients (AEs, loss of effect) and to justify the acceptability of the observed responder rate and 
demographics and complementing characteristics.  
The applicant clarified that the majority of patients responded to octreotide capsules at the end of the 
Run-in phase (64-78%) and only 5.5% discontinued treatment during the Run-in phase due to loss of 
efficacy (treatment failure). The applicant also believes that: a) the observed response rate is in line 
with maintenance of response rates in prior clinical trials with injectable somatostatin analogues; b) 
patients that respond to octreotide capsules maintain their response for long term.  
The provided data show that Mycapssa can be beneficial for patients that respond to octreotide 
capsules and reduce the need for injections and associated inconveniences. The patients that fail the 
oral therapy trial can be reverted to injectable treatment options.

2.10.7.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
During the assessment a major objection was raised due to limited efficacy: it was noted that 30-40% 
of patients switching from SRL to Mycapssa do not benefit from the switch. The applicant was 
requested to provide the reasons for discontinuation or decision not to randomise these patients (AEs, 
loss of effect) and to justify the acceptability of the observed responder rate and demographics and 
complementing characteristics. The provided data show that Mycapssa can be beneficial for patients 
that respond to octreotide capsules and reduce the need for injections and associated inconveniences. 
The patients that fail the oral therapy trial can be reverted to injectable treatment options. 
2.10.8.  Clinical safety 
2.10.8.1.  Patient exposure 
During the clinical development programme, 571 human subjects received at least 1 dose of octreotide 
capsules. In the 11 clinical pharmacology studies, a total of 214 subjects were exposed to octreotide 
capsules for 1 to 6 days.  
In the 3 Phase 3 studies, a total of 349 patients with acromegaly were exposed to octreotide capsules 
(146 in study OOC-ACM-302, 48 in study OOC-ACM-303, and 155 in study CH-ACM-01). The overall 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 105/130 
 
 
 
 
exposure to octreotide capsules monotherapy in these studies was 390.2 patient years (192.7 patient 
years in study OOC-ACM-302, 71.6 patient years in study OOC-ACM-303, and 125.9 patient years in 
study CH-ACM-01).  
Overall, 154 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 137 patients for between 1 and 2 years, and 58 
patients for more than 2 years. 
Extent of exposure in the clinical pharmacology studies 
For the 214 subjects who were exposed in the 11 clinical pharmacology studies (184 healthy 
volunteers, 18 subjects with hepatic impairment, 6 subjects with severe renal impairment, and 6 
subjects with end-stage renal disease [ESRD] on dialysis), drug exposure was typically 1 day and not 
more than 6 days.

Overall, 154 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 137 patients for between 1 and 2 years, and 58 
patients for more than 2 years.  
Across all the 3 Phase 3 studies of octreotide, subjects have been exposed to octreotide at total daily 
doses ranging from 40 to 80 mg, which is consistent with the applied octreotide capsules doses. 
The demographic characteristics were very similar across the Phase 3 studies. Patients were 
predominantly White/Caucasian (only few subjects were Asian and Black) with a mean age of 54 years, 
about 20% were elderly, and about 60% were females. The demographic data were well balanced 
between the octreotide capsules and control groups.  
The acromegaly baseline characteristics of patients were similar across the Phase 3 studies. About half 
of the enrolled patients had an acromegaly duration of <10 years. Mean baseline IGF-1 levels were 0.8 
- 0.9 x upper limit of normal (ULN); mean baseline GH levels ranged between 0.7 and 0.9 ng/mL. 
For the 214 subjects who were exposed in the 11 clinical pharmacology studies (184 healthy 
volunteers, 18 subjects with hepatic impairment, 6 subjects with severe renal impairment, and 6 
subjects with end-stage renal disease [ESRD] on dialysis), drug exposure period was very short: it was 
typically 1 day and not more than 6 days. 
The safety size was considered sufficient for long-term exposure assessment. 
2.10.8.2.  Adverse events 
Adverse events in the Phase 3 studies 
The applicant presented the data that the most commonly reported AEs across the 3 Phase 3 studies 
with octreotide capsules were belonged to the System Organ Class (SOC) gastrointestinal disorders, 
nervous system disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, general disorders and 
administration site conditions, infections and infestations, skin and subcutaneous disorders, and 
investigations.  
RCT Phase of Study OOC-ACM-302 
19 patients (34.5%) in the octreotide capsule group and 15 patients (40.5%) in the SRL injection 
group experienced a TEAE that was considered related to study drug. Five patients (9.1%) in the 
octreotide capsule group and 4 patients (10.8%) in the SRL injection group experienced 1 or more 
severe TEAEs. The incidence of the following common TEAEs (reported by ≥ 3% of patients in either 
treatment group) was higher in the octreotide capsule group than in the SRL injection group: flatulence

Adverse events by dose level 
The applicant presented data that no dose-dependent safety signals were noted for octreotide capsules 
in the Phase 3 studies. 
In the run-in phase of study OOC-ACM-302, AEs were reported for 64.2%, 85.3%, and 72.9% of 
patients receiving 40 mg, 60 mg, or 80 mg as final dose, respectively. Treatment-related AES were 
reported for 50.9%, 67.6%, and 49.2% of patients, respectively.  
During the study OOC-ACM-302 run-in phase 72.6% of patients experienced at least 1 AE, 54.1% of 
patients have treatment related AEs. The most commonly (46.6%) reported TEAEs were belonged to 
the SOC gastrointestinal (GIT) disorders: nausea, diarrhoea, flatulence, abdominal pain, abdominal 
upper pain, diarrhoea and dyspepsia have been reported. 
In the RCT phase, AEs were reported for 69.6%, 84.6%, and 63.2% of patients in the octreotide 
capsules group at the 40 mg, 60 mg, or 80 mg dose levels, respectively; drug-related AEs were 
reported for 26.1%, 53.8%, and 31.6% of patients. In the SRL injections group, AEs were reported for 
55.6%, 64.3%, and 85.7% of patients treated with low, middle, and high doses, respectively; drug-
related AEs were reported for 22.2%, 28.6%, and 64.3% of patients with low, middle, and high doses, 
respectively. 
The applicant presented safety profiling in SmPC section 4.8 of octreotide capsules where the spectrum 
and frequency of AEs for Mycapssa and sc Sandostatin AEs are mostly comparable.  
In study OOC-ACM-303, the AE incidence was 100% for all octreotide capsules dose levels (40 mg, 60 
mg, and 80 mg) and 96.4% for placebo. Treatment-related AEs were reported for 28.6%, 100.0%, and 
73.7% of patients receiving octreotide capsules 40 mg, 60 mg, or 80 mg, respectively, while 53.6% of 
patients in the placebo-group were reported with drug-related AEs. 
In the core treatment phase of study CH-ACM-01, the incidences of AEs in patients treated with 
octreotide capsules at 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg were 74.8%, 67.8%, and 66.7%, respectively. Drug-
related AEs were reported for 45.8%, 33.3%, and 31.6% of patients, respectively. No dose-related AE 
patterns were noted. 
Conclusions regarding adverse events  
From the data provided it seems that rates of patients experienced AEs/ADRs in general are 
comparable to SRL inj (70.9% / 34.5% vs 70.3% / 40.5% for Mycapssa AEs/ADRs vs SRL inj 
AEs/ADRs, respectively) and comparable to SRL inj ADRs in the enriched population (34.5 .1% vs 
40.5% for Mycapssa vs SRL inj) and only 2x numerically higher proportions of patients experienced 
ADRs over placebo (7.1% vs 3.6% for Mycapssa vs Pbo, respectively.

TEAE were comparable between the octreotide capsules group and the SRL injection group and also 
between the octreotide capsules group and the placebo group. 
In all Phase 3 studies, the most frequently reported AEs were GI events and headache. The 
argumentation of the applicant, that the spectrum and frequency of GI AEs for oral octreotide and 
iSRLs are mostly comparable, was considered acceptable. The argumentation of the applicant, that 
manifestation of headache in patients using oral octreotide and iSRL is comparable, was also 
considered acceptable.  
2.10.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study OOC-ACM-302 
The applicant states that the serious adverse event (SAE) pattern in the Phase 3 studies was in line 
with the disease characteristics of acromegaly and with the known safety profile of octreotide. In the 
RCT phase of study OOC-ACM-302, the SAE incidence was similar in the octreotide capsules and SRL 
injection groups (5.5% vs. 8.1%). 
None of the individual PTs was reported for more than 1 patient, and none was considered related to 
study drug by the investigator. 
In the core treatment phase of study OOC-ACM-303, 2 patients (7.1%) in the octreotide capsules 
group and 1 patient (3.6%) in the placebo group reported SAEs. In the OLE phase, 6 patients (15.0%) 
reported SAEs. None of these events was considered to be related to the study drug by the 
investigator. 
Malignancies. The reported malignancies during treatment with octreotide capsules are in line with 
published information the disease burden of patients with acromegaly. 
Deaths  
A total of 4 deaths were reported in the clinical study programme of octreotide capsules. Two of the 
deaths were reported in study OOC-ACM-302. None of the deaths were considered related to study 
drug. 
Relationship of adverse events to dose and treatment duration 
In all Phase 3 studies, treatment with octreotide capsules was started at 40 mg daily and escalated to 
60 mg or 80 mg, as needed to obtain biochemical control. No dose-dependent safety signals were 
noted. 
The serious adverse event (SAE) pattern in the Phase 3 studies was in line with the disease 
characteristics of acromegaly and with the known safety profile of octreotide. In the run-in and OLE 
phases of Phase 3 studies hepatobiliary SAEs (acute cholescystitis, post cholecystectomy syndrome, 
bile duct obstruction, cholelithiasis, transaminase increased) and acute pancreatitis were SAEs 
considered related to study drug. All these AEs have been included in SmPC. The applicant states that 
other SAEs were not considered related to study drug. 
The applicant was presented information that cardiac SAEs (bradycardia, acute myocardial infarction, 
cardiac failure) are not related to octreotide. Cardiac SAEs have been reconsidered and bradycardia as 
AE was included in SmPC section 4.8. 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022

The applicant states that there was no suggestion of an increased risk of AEs over time with octreotide 
capsules and no dose-dependent safety signals were noted. The mentioned applicant’s conclusion is 
acceptable.  
The reported low number cases of malignancies during treatment with octreotide capsules are in line 
with published information the disease burden of patients with acromegaly. The applicant’s conclusion 
on the deaths cases to be not related to study drug octreotide were considered acceptable. 
2.10.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory evaluations during studies of octreotide included haematology, chemistry, urinalysis. 
Glucose dysregulation tests 
Glucose-associated AEs reported during the run-in phase of Study OOC-ACM-302 were hyperglycaemia 
(3.4% of patients), hypoglycaemia (1.4%), diabetes mellitus (0.7%), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (0.7%), 
and blood glucose increased (0.7%). 
In the core treatment phase of study OOC-ACM-303, an AE of blood glucose increased was reported for 
10.7% of patients in the octreotide capsules group, and diabetes mellitus and hypoglycaemia were 
reported for 3.6% each. In the placebo group, AEs of hyperglycaemia and HbA1c increased were 
reported for 3.6% of patients each. None of these events was serious. Regarded as related to study 
drug were 1 event of blood glucose increased and 1 event of diabetes mellitus in the octreotide 
capsules group. 
Thyroid dysfunction tests 
Hypothyroidism and thyroid disorder (e.g. decreased thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH], decreased 
total thyroxin [T4], and decreased free T4) are commonly reported adverse reactions of sc Sandostatin 
IR. 
During study OOC-ACM-302 one patient (1.8%) in the octreotide capsules group experienced a 
thyroid-associated AE (secondary hypothyroidism), which was assessed by the investigator as mild in 
intensity and unrelated to study drug. In study OOC-ACM-303, biochemical hypothyroidism was not 
reported. In study CH-ACM-01, in the core treatment phase, the following AEs were reported for 
1 patient (0.6%) each: hypothyroidism, thyroid neoplasm, blood TSH increased, blood TSH decreased, 
free T4 increased, and free T4 decreased. 
Haematological tests 
There were no significant differences in haematologic shifts between treatment groups (CSR OOC-ACM-
302). 
The applicant states that the findings of the laboratory evaluations in the Phase 3 studies were in line 
with the safety profile of octreotide and the disease burden of acromegaly. This is acceptable.  
Hypoglycaemia. Because of its inhibitory action on growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin, octreotide 
may affect glucose regulation. The applicant states that the serious hypoglycaemia event in the core 
treatment phase of study CH-ACM-01 was considered not related to study drug. The applicant agrees 
that hypoglycaemia may be associated with SRLs, and it is listed as an ADR in the SmPC of Mycapssa.

2.10.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Elderly 
The percentages of patients by age group who experienced AEs in each category were generally 
similar, except for Musculoskeletal pain (9% in patients ≥65 years vs. 2% in patients <65 years), 
Nervous system disorders (41.5% in patients ≥65 years vs. 34.5% in patients <65 years); Sum of 
postural hypotension, falls, black outs, syncope, dizziness, ataxia, fractures (20.0% in patients ≥65 
years vs. 11.3% in patients <65 years). These AEs can be explained as an effect of concomitant 
diseases. Only one patient >75 years of age was enrolled in the octreotide capsules programme with 
multiple AEs. The investigator considered all of the events to be grade 1 and not related to the study 
drug. 
Gender 
There were no meaningful differences in the proportions of male and female patients with AEs, SAEs, 
and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation. The AE patterns were consistent for male and female 
patients. 
Race 
Most patients in the Phase 3 studies (about 90% in all studies) were Caucasian. The low number of 
patients of other races did not allow to perform a meaningful assessment of the AE profile of octreotide 
capsules by race.  
Renal impairment 
Study CHI-007 investigated PK and safety of octreotide capsules in subjects with severe renal 
impairment (SRI defined as eGFR 15 – 29 mL/min/1.73 m2), subjects with ESRD on dialysis, and 
matched healthy controls. The study showed that the safety profile of octreotide capsules was similar 
between renally impaired subjects and healthy controls, and that octreotide capsules were safe and 
well tolerated in subjects with renal impairment.  
The applicant states, that that octreotide capsules were safe and well tolerated in subjects with renal 
impairment. The applicant states, that no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, 
moderate, or severe renal impairment. There is a significant increase in octreotide exposure in patients 
with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Therefore, applicant proposes different posology 
recommendations only for patients with ESRD. They should start taking MYCAPSSA 20 mg daily.  
Hepatic impairment 
PK and safety of octreotide capsules were also investigated in subjects with stable cirrhosis and portal 
hypertension (Child Pugh A or B; study CH-PHT-01). Both octreotide doses tested (10 mg and 20 mg) 
appeared to be safe and well tolerated.  
The applicant states, that octreotide capsules were safe and well tolerated in subjects with stable 
cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Patients with Child Pugh C have not been studied; careful monitoring 
of these patients initiating treatment with MYCAPSSA is recommended.  
The Study CH-PHT-01 was performed only with single dose octreotide capsules and limited number 
(18) of participants. It should be taken into account. On the other hand, SmPC section 4.2 states that 
in patients with Child Pugh A or B; the MYCAPSSA dose should be up-titrated based on clinical 
response.  
The conclusions of the applicant were endorsed by the CHMP.

Pregnancy and lactation 
No pregnant or breastfeeding women have been exposed to octreotide capsules in the clinical 
development programme. 
2.10.8.6.  Immunological events 
Not applicable. 
2.10.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Study CHI-002: Food effect 
Systemic exposure to octreotide was substantially reduced following fed as compared to fasted 
administration of octreotide capsules. Adverse events were reported for 76.0% of the subjects who 
received octreotide capsules while fed, 70.8% of the subjects who received octreotide capsules while 
fasted. The AEs considered related to study treatment were consistent with the known safety profile of 
octreotide and were independent of fasting status. 
Study OCT-01: Food effect 
Oral administration of octreotide capsules 20 mg with food resulted in decreases in the extent of 
exposure, regardless of meal size or timing. The incidence of AEs was slightly higher with octreotide 
capsules 20 mg given 1 hour after full test meal (8 subjects reported AEs) and octreotide capsules 20 
mg in fasted condition (7 subjects) than with the other test conditions (octreotide capsules given 1 h 
prior to full test meal or 30 mg prior to light test meal; 2-5 subjects). There were no observable AE 
patterns attributable to type of diet or timing of octreotide capsules intake. 
Study CH-005: PPI (esomeprazole) 
The safety profile of octreotide capsules plus esomeprazole was acceptable and was comparable to that 
following octreotide capsules alone, although there were more drug-related AEs following co-
administration of both drugs. 
Study CH-006: Warfarin, HCTZ, metformin, oestradiol 
Octreotide capsules plus the probe substrates had higher numbers of subjects reporting AEs than 
placebo plus the probe substrates. The AEs tending to be more frequent with octreotide capsules plus 
levonorgestrel/ethinyl oestradiol versus placebo plus levonorgestrel/ethinyl oestradiol were dizziness 
and headache. The AEs tending to be more frequent with octreotide capsules plus warfarin, HCTZ, and 
metformin versus placebo plus warfarin, HCTZ, and metformin were headache, nausea, dizziness, 
vomiting, and abdominal pain. Overall, co-administration of octreotide capsules and the probe 
substrates was well tolerated. 
Study OCT-03: Metoclopramide and loperamide 
The number of subjects with AEs was similar across the test conditions in this study. Octreotide 
capsules 40 mg were safe and well tolerated, regardless of administration with metoclopramide or 
loperamide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 117/130 
 
 
 
 
Study OCT-02: Digoxin and lisinopril 
The proportion of subjects with AEs was similar for octreotide capsules plus digoxin and lisinopril 
(52.9%) and placebo plus digoxin and lisinopril (47.1%). Co-administration of octreotide capsules with 
digoxin and lisinopril was safe and well tolerated.  
Study OCT-04: Cyclosporine 
The proportion of subjects experiencing an AE was substantially higher with placebo plus cyclosporin 
than for octreotide capsules plus cyclosporin (47.1% vs. 18.8%). Co-administration of octreotide 
capsules and oral cyclosporine was safe and well tolerated. 
Several food effect and DDI studies were conducted with octreotide capsules due to their novel 
formulation and route of administration. In these studies, the AE profile of octreotide capsules co-
administered with warfarin, HCTZ, metformin, levonorgestrel/ ethinyl oestradiol or digoxin and 
lisinopril was consistent with the known safety profile of octreotide or each of the probe drugs, and 
the safety profile of octreotide capsules co-administered with PPI was well tolerated.  
The DDI safety information presented in the SmPC of octreotide capsules is in line with the reference 
medicinal product Sandostatin.  
Risk of changes in absorption of concomitant medicinal products. The effects of this oral octreotide 
formulation on the absorption of other co-medicated medicines, varying from a 3-fold decrease in 
bioavailability of ciclosporin to a 1.4-fold increase in absorption of lisinoprol, is of concern. The 
interactions could be due to octreotide, effects on the gastrointestinal tract and the excipients. The 
applicant was requested to discuss the effects of this octreotide formulation on the absorption of 
other co-administered medicines and the mechanism behind these interactions and to discuss which 
medicines (e.g., good soluble poor permeable compounds, poor aqueous soluble compounds with 
high and low permeability, compounds with special formulations to improve the absorption etc,) are 
most prone for absorption related interactions with this octreotide formulation. The applicant 
presented the argumentation and this issue is currently considered to be resolved.  
2.10.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The pattern of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation in the Phase 3 studies was consistent with the 
overall safety profile of octreotide and the disease burden of acromegaly; the study drug was most 
frequently discontinued due to GI events.

study drug discontinuation. Nausea was the most frequent mentioned AE (5 patients, 3.4%). MedDRA 
SOC with the most frequent AEs was GIT disorders: 10 patients (6.8%) experienced 15 GIT disorders. 
Thus,  GIT disorders were the most frequently AEs of octreotide capsules leading to study 
discontinuation.  
In the RCT phase, 1 patient (1.8%) in the octreotide capsules group reported an AE leading to 
discontinuation. This patient died following accidental drug poisoning (coded as PT “toxicity to various 
agents”); the event was regarded as not related to study drug by the investigator. In the OLE phase, 1 
patient reported an SAE leading to discontinuation (acute cholecystitis), which was assessed by the 
investigator as related to study drug. 
In the core treatment phase of study OOC-ACM-303, 2 patients (7.1%) in the octreotide capsules 
group and 1 patient (3.6%) in the placebo group experienced at least 1 AE that led to study drug 
discontinuation. In the OLE phase, 1 patient discontinued study drug due to an AE. Except for 
headache, all AEs leading to discontinuation were GI events. 
In study CH-ACM-01, 22 patients (14.2%) in the core treatment phase and 1 patient (1.1%) in the 
OLE phase reported at least 1 AE leading to study drug discontinuation. Except for pyrexia, all AEs that 
led to discontinuation in 2 or more patients were GI events. 
2.10.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
Octreotide capsules were approved in the US in June 2020. Post-marketing information from 2 Periodic 
Adverse Drug Experience Reports (PADERs) is summarised below. 
PADER 1 (reporting period 26 June – 25 September 2020) 
•  42 patients were treated during the reporting period  
•  No serious events were reported. 
•  A total of 12 non-serious events were reported. Of those:

o  4 events were unexpected (cardiac disorder, chest pain, product administration error, 
and product dose omission) 
o  8 events were expected (abdominal discomfort, abdominal distension [2 events], 
flatulence, nausea, vomiting, headache, and hypertension) 
PADER 2 (reporting period 26 September – 25 December 2020) 
•  118 patients were treated during the reporting period. 
• 
There were 2 serious, unexpected events (major depression and pneumothorax) and 1 serious, 
expected event (gastrointestinal disorder). The causality of the major depression event was 
not assessable by the sponsor, because no further details were provided. For the 
pneumothorax event, a possible relationship to octreotide capsules could not be excluded due 
to the temporal relationship; however, information such as medical history and clinical details 
was lacking. 
•  A total of 16 non-serious events were reported. Of those: 
o  6 events were unexpected (product dose omission issue, weight abnormal, limb 
deformity, memory impairment, alopecia, and hot flush) 
o  10 events were expected (diarrhoea, gastrointestinal disorder [2 events], nausea, drug 
ineffective for unapproved indication, pain [2 events], unevaluable event, and 
headache [2 events]) 
Post-marketing data of the reference medicinal product 
The following ADRs of the reference medicinal product were derived from spontaneous reports:  
•  Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Thrombocytopenia

2.10.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary clinical safety information on octreotide capsules is derived from the Phase 3 studies in 
patients with acromegaly. Supportive safety information is available from 11 clinical pharmacology 
studies, of which 9 were performed in healthy subjects, 1 in subjects with renal impairment, and 1 in 
subjects with hepatic impairment. In addition, safety information on the reference medicinal product sc 
Sandostatin IR is available.  
During the clinical development programme, 571 human subjects received at least 1 dose of octreotide 
capsules. In the 3 Phase 3 studies, a total of 349 patients with acromegaly were exposed to octreotide 
capsules.  
During the study OOC-ACM-302 run-in phase 72.6% of patients experienced at least 1 AE, 54.1% of 
patients had treatment related AEs. The most commonly (46.6%) reported TEAEs were belonged to 
the SOC gastrointestinal (GIT) disorders: nausea, diarrhoea, flatulence, abdominal pain and dyspepsia 
have been reported. During the RCT phase of this study GIT AEs nausea, dyspepsia and flatulence 
were the more commonly reported with octreotide capsules vs sc Sandostatin. Taking in to account 
that 9.6% patients with GIT AEs discontinued study due to AEs, it can be stated that abdominal 
distension, abdominal pain, abdominal upper pain were also more commonly reported in octreotide 
capsules group vs sc Sandostatin group. One of the GIT AEs (acute pancreatitis) was reported as an 
SAE; it was assessed by the investigator as related to study drug and led to study drug 
discontinuation. 1 patient reported an SAE related to study drug leading to discontinuation (acute 
cholecystitis). Except for headache, all AEs leading to discontinuation were GIT events. The detailed 
analysis of GI AEs presented by the applicant and toxicological study with cynomolgus monkeys show 
that oral octreotide does not produce an additional risk of GI ADRs compared to iSRL. The 
argumentation of the applicant was considered acceptable.  
No differences in the degree of TPE-induced permeation were reported after 12 consecutive days 
repeated dosing of the octreotide-TPE formulation in rats. The safety in humans related to long-term 
exposure of TPE was discussed. It was concluded that long term exposure to TPE would not be 
expected to lead to an increase in adverse events, including infections or GI events. 
The nervous system (NS) disorders were more frequently detected in octreotide capsules group. Even 
though headache is a symptom of acromegaly, this AE was more frequently detected in octreotide 
capsules group and was accepted as treatment related AE only in octreotide capsules group. 
In the OLE phase, during long use of octreotide capsules, the proportions of patients with AEs and with 
treatment-related AEs were considerably lower than in the previous phases.  
During the placebo controlled study OOC-ACM-303, the most frequent AEs that were reported in a 
greater proportion of patients in the octreotide capsules group vs placebo group were gastrointestinal 
events (diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspepsia), cholelithiasis, headache, blood 
glucose increased. In the OLE phase of study OOC-ACM-303, the most frequent TEAEs were nausea, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, dizziness and blood glucose increased.  
In the core treatment phase of study CH-ACM-01, the most frequent AEs were headache, nausea, 
arthralgia, asthenia, hyperhidrosis, diarrhoea, and peripheral swelling. In the OLE phase, headache, 
arthralgia, asthenia, and hyperhidrosis were reported in >10% of patients. 
The serious adverse event (SAE) pattern in the Phase 3 studies was in line with the disease 
characteristics of acromegaly and with the known safety profile of octreotide. In the run-in and OLE 
phases of Phase 3 studies hepatobiliary SAEs (acute cholescystitis, post cholecystectomy syndrome, 
bile duct obstruction, cholelithiasis, transaminase increased) and acute pancreatitis were SAEs 
considered related to study drug. All these AEs have been included in SmPC. The applicant states that 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 121/130 
 
 
 
other SAEs were not considered related to study drug. However, cardiac SAEs have been reconsidered 
and bradycardia as AE was included in SmPC section 4.8.  
A total of 4 deaths were reported in the clinical study programme of octreotide capsules. None of the 
deaths were considered related to study drug.  
Because of its inhibitory action on growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin, octreotide may affect 
glucose regulation. The applicant states that the serious hypoglycaemia event in the core treatment 
phase of study CH-ACM-01 was considered not related to study drug. However, the applicant agrees 
that hypoglycaemia may be associated with SRLs, and it is listed as an ADR in the approved SmPC of 
MYCAPSSA.  
The applicant stated that octreotide capsules were safe and well tolerated in subjects with renal 
impairment and that no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal 
impairment. There is a significant increase in octreotide exposure in patients with end stage renal 
disease (ESRD). Therefore applicant proposed different posology recommendations only for patients 
with ESRD. It was agreed that these patients should start taking MYCAPSSA 20 mg daily.  
The applicant stated that octreotide capsules were safe and well tolerated in subjects with stable 
cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Patients with Child Pugh C have not been studied; careful monitoring 
of these patients initiating treatment with MYCAPSSA is recommended. However, study CH-PHT-01 
was performed only with single dose octreotide capsules and limited number (18) of participants. On 
the other hand SmPC section 4.2 states that in patients with Child Pugh A or B; the MYCAPSSA dose 
should be up-titrated based on clinical response. This was considered acceptable.  
The DDI safety information presented in the SmPC of octreotide capsules is in line with reference 
medicinal product Sandostatin. No other safety issues were noted in the presented DDI studies with 
octreotide capsules.

2.10.10.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
During the assessment it was concluded that clinical safety of Mycapssa required further confirmation 
and several other concerns addressing uncertainties for safety were raised (unknown comparative 
rates of ADRs and severities for both TEAE and ADRs, uncertain safety profiling in the SmPC, including 
profiling of risks of cardiotoxicity, hypoglycaemia, in elderlies, renal and liver impairments and risks 
stemming from post-marketing). The applicant has provided the requested information. The provided 
data show that the spectrum and frequency of GI and nervous system AEs for oral octreotide and 
injectable Sandostatin are mostly comparable. It was concluded that safety profile of Mycapssa is 
acceptable.

2.11.1.1.  Conclusions on the safety specification  
Having considered the data in the safety specification the CHMP agreed that the absence of safety 
concerns as listed by the applicant is appropriate. 
2.11.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan  
No additional pharmacovigilance activities are considered necessary for Mycapssa. Routine  
pharmacovigilance is sufficient to further characterise the safety concerns associated with the product. 
2.11.3.  Risk minimisation measures 
No important identified or potential risks or missing information are included in the list of safety 
concerns in this RMP. According to the applicant routine risk minimisation activities as described in 
Section V.1 are considered sufficient to manage the safety concerns of the medicinal product. 
2.11.3.1.  Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The PRAC having considered the data submitted was of the opinion that: 
the proposed routine risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in 
the proposed indication(s). 
2.11.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.3 is acceptable.

2.12.  Pharmacovigilance  
2.12.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.12.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Based on the novel oral formulation of octreotide, the PRAC is of the opinion that a separate entry in 
the EURD list for Mycapssa is needed, as it cannot follow the already existing entry for octreotide. The 
requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request the alignment of the new PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 26.062020. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.13.  Product information 
2.13.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The target indication applied for by the applicant is for the long-term maintenance treatment in 
patients with acromegaly (ACM) who have responded to and tolerated treatment with somatostatin 
analogues. This is a hybrid application for part of the indications authorised for Sandostatin s/c in 
patients with ACM and that is: “Symptomatic control and reduction of growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1 
plasma levels in patients with acromegaly who are inadequately controlled by surgery or radiotherapy.” 
ACM is a serious and life-threatening rare disease usually caused by a GH-secreting pituitary adenoma. 
It is a chronic condition with significant morbidity and mortality. The definition of ACM is based on a 
set of biochemical and clinical criteria. ACM mortality determinants include GH >2.5 ng/mL and 
elevated IGF-1, hypertension, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, requirement for 
glucocorticoid replacement, and prior pituitary radiation.  
The CHMP approved modified indication for Mycapssa in line with the SmPC Guideline: “for 
maintenance treatment in adult patients with acromegaly who have responded to and tolerated 
treatment with somatostatin analogues”. 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 124/130 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment options for acromegaly include surgical resection of the pituitary adenoma, radiotherapy, 
and drug therapy to reduce GH and IGF-1 levels to normal values. Transsphenoidal surgery has been 
recommended as the primary therapy in most patients. Use of a somatostatin receptor ligand (SRL) as 
primary therapy has been recommended for patients who cannot be cured by surgery, have extensive 
cavernous sinus invasion, do not have chiasmal compression, or are poor surgical candidates. 
Currently, there are 3 drug classes available for the treatment of acromegaly: SRLs or somatostatin 
analogues (SSAs; octreotide, lanreotide, and pasireotide), dopamine agonists (bromocriptine and 
cabergoline), and a GH receptor antagonist (pegvisomant). At present, SRLs are the most widely used 
drugs to control acromegaly. Current injectable therapies for acromegaly are suboptimal for multiple 
reasons. One of these is that the injections are poorly tolerated. Patients experience long-term 
sequelae associated with their injection, including persistent pain (lasting up to days), nodules, 
haemorrhage, inflammation, and scarring. Hence, there is a need of an efficacious oral octreotide 
treatment. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is from three clinical Phase 3 studies in patients with 
acromegaly evaluating the efficacy of octreotide capsules: OOC-ACM-302, a randomised, open-label, 
active-controlled (RCT phase: n=92; Octreotide capsules: n=55; SRL injections: n=37), preceded by a 
run-in phase, followed by an OLE phase study; OOC-ACM-303, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled (DPC phase: n=56; Octreotide capsules: 28; placebo: 28), followed by an OLE phase, and 
CH-ACM-01 a single-arm, baseline-controlled (Core treatment phase: n=155), followed by an OLE 
phase. Thus, the applicant performed two concurrently controlled (one with active control and one with 
placebo control) and one baseline controlled pivotal studies. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In one of the main phase 3 studies (Study 302), the proportion of patients with biochemical control 
(primary endpoint) and differences between Mycapssa and SRL inj were 50/55 [90,9%] vs 37/37 
[100%], difference [95%CI] is -9.1 [-19.9, 0.5] which meets the statistical NI margin of 20%. The 
maintenance of biochemical control after switch from SoC in Study 302 was assessed in an enriched 
population as time weighted average (TWA) of IGF-1 <1.3xULN during the randomised clinical trial 
(RCT) phase (average of week 62 and week 58, starting RCT phase from Week 26).  
In the second pivotal study (study 303), the proportion of patients with biochemical control (primary 
endpoint) and differences between Mycapssa and PBO were 16/28 [57,1%] vs 5/28 [17.9%], 
difference [95%CI] is 38.74 [10.68, 59.90] which meets statistical and clinical superiority. The 
maintenance of biochemical control after switch from SoC in Study 303 was assessed as average of 
IGF-1 <1xULN during the double-blind placebo control (DPC) phase (measuring the last 2 available 
assessments between weeks 34 and 36 in the DPC period). 
In the third pivotal study ACM-01 the proportion of patients with biochemical control (primary 
endpoint) [95%CI] was 98/151 [64.9%; 58.4, 74.2] which meets statistical and clinical superiority. 
The maintenance of biochemical control after switch for SoC in Study ACM-01 was assessed as average 
of IGF-1 <1.3xULN at the end of core treatment period (at least 7 Months). 
Additionally, in pivotal Study 302 the proportion of patients with maintenance of clinical and clinical + 
biochemical control after switch from SoC (secondary and co-secondary endpoint) and differences 
between Mycapssa and SRL inj were 40/55 [72.7%] vs 25/37 [67.6%] and 36/55 [65.5%] vs 27/37 
[73%], differences [95%CI] are 5.4% [-13.2, 25.2] and -6.8% [-25.3, 13.2] for clinical and clinical + 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 125/130 
 
 
 
 
biochemical controls, respectively.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The pivotal Study 302 was designed as an enrichment study with a run-in phase during which a 
substantial proportion of patients withdrew after the switch from SoC due to different reasons and this 
questions generalizability of study results for the targeted population. 
The biochemical control in Study 302 was settled as time weighted average (TWA) of IGF-1 <1.3xULN 
during the RCT phase. Similarly, Study ACM-01 used the same IGF-1 <1.3xULN cut-off value. This 
definition of control represents partial biochemical control only, not full control which would be IGF-1 
<1xULN (e.g., TWA).  
The fitting into noninferiority (NI) margin is very close to lower boundary and this questions robustness 
of study results however the applicant argued the acceptability of the NI margin satisfactorily during 
the procedure.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In general, TEAE/ADRs were observed in 70.9/34.5% and 70.3/40.5% of Mycapssa and SRL patients in 
Study 302, respectively and comparable or only numerically different between Mycapssa and Pbo in 
Study 303 (in 100/7.1% and 96/3.6%, respectively).  
The most important unfavourable effects were gastrointestinal (GI) TEAE, that were leading to 
withdrawal during switch period from SRL in pivotal study 302 (leading to 9,6% withdrawal from the 
run-in phase), headache during RCT phase (in 4.8% and 1.8% of Mycapssa and SRL inj patients in 
Study 302, respectively) and pancreatitis in 0.7/1.8% and 0% of Mycapssa and SRL patients in Study 
302. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
During the assessment the applicant was requested to provide details increasing granularity of TEAE or 
ADRs, observed, i.e.:  
-  ADR rates vs rates of patients with at least 1 ADR 
-  Comparative severity rates of both TEAE and ADRs per PT/SOC 
-  Comparative duration and reversibility of TEAE and ADRs 
-  Qualitative characteristics of GI, headache and pancreatitis at least for the MoA of GI ADR (the 
local effect of enhancer is not addressed) and ability to predict, monitor, treat and prevent al 
other main risks. 
The required information has been provided during the procedure. TEAE were comparable between the 
octreotide capsules group and the SRL injection group and also between the octreotide capsules group 
and the placebo group.

Notes: 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important effects observed are (in order of importance), a maintenance of biochemical 
control after switch from SoC in enriched population (primary endpoint) and differences between 
Mycapssa and SRL inj which were 50/55 [90,9%] vs 37/37 [100%] with a difference [95%CI] of -9.1 
[-19.9, 0.5] which meets the statistical noninferiority (NI) margin of 20%.  
This is supported by the (1) maintenance of Biochemical control after switch from SoC (primary 
endpoint) between Mycapssa and PBO and were 16/28 [57,1%] vs 5/28 [17.9%] with difference 
[95%CI] of 38.74 [10.68, 59.90] and (2) as compared to BL 98/151 [64.9%; 58.4, 74.2] which meets 
statistical and clinical superiority. 
Moreover, maintenance of biochemical control after the switch is supported by the maintenance of 
clinical and clinical + biochemical control after switch from SoC (secondary and co-secondary endpoint) 
and differences between Mycapssa and SRL inj and were 40/55 [72.7%] vs 25/37 [67.6%] and 36/55 
[65.5%] vs 27/37 [73%], differences [95%CI] are 5.4% [-13.2, 25.2] and -6.8% [-25.3, 13.2] for 
clinical and clinical + biochemical controls, respectively. 
The maintenances of biochemical and clinical controls are considered clinically reasonable endpoints, 
the effect size of NI in enriched population is considered clinically meaningful and the supportive data 
Assessment report  
EMA/796198/2022 
Page 128/130 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are in concordance with primary effect in Study 302. 
The TEAE/ADRs were observed either in comparable rates between Mycapssa and active control SRL inj 
(70.9/34.5% and 70.3/40.5% of Mycapssa and SRL patients in Study 302, respectively) or only 
numerically different rates between Mycapssa and Pbo in Study 303 (in 100/7,1% and 96/3,6%, 
respectively). 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit/risk balance of Mycapssa for the proposed indication is positive.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit /risk balance of Mycapssa is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Mycapssa is not similar to Signifor within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000.  
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Mycapssa is favourable in the following indication: 
“Mycapssa is indicated for maintenance treatment in adult patients with acromegaly who have 
responded to and tolerated treatment with somatostatin analogues.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

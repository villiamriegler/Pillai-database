1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Merck Sharp & Dohme B.V. submitted on 11 March 2019 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Ervebo, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the 
centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 23 June 2016. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: “Ervebo is indicated for active immunization of at-risk 
individuals 18 years of age and older to protect against Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) caused by Zaire Ebola 
virus. See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support this indication”. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, quality data, complete non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0095/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0095/2017 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Applicant’s requests for consideration 
Conditional marketing authorisation  
During the assessment certain limitations with regards to the comprehensiveness of the available 
pharmaceutical data were identified, therefore in light of the emergency situation a Conditional marketing 
authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was considered. 
Accelerated Assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus strain Indiana with 
a deletion of the VSV envelope glycoprotein replaced with the Zaire Ebola Virus Kikwit 1995 strain surface 
glycoprotein contained in the above medicinal product to be considered as a new active substance, as the 
applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

PRIME support 
Ervebo was granted eligibility to PRIME on 23 June 2016 in the following indication:  Active immunization 
of at-risk individuals 18 years and older in reactive use situations to protect against Ebola Virus Disease 
(EVD) caused by Zaire Ebola virus. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time based on the following: 
• 
In view of the very high case-fatality rate of EVD and of the fact that no approved method to 
prevent or treat EVD currently exists, it was agreed that prevention of EVD is currently an unmet 
medical need. 
•  Based on the presented data (supportive non-clinical profile, antibody response to the product 
shown by ELISA and virus neutralization assays in phase 1 studies, interim analysis of the phase 
3 ring vaccination trial, preliminary safety data collected in the clinical studies conducted to date), 
CHMP agreed that V920 has the potential to address the identified unmet need. 
•  Despite the late stage of development, additional discussions between the EU regulators and 
WHO are foreseen (e.g. in the area of clinical trial design for future outbreaks, aspects regarding 
correlates of protection, immunobridging).  
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, the Rapporteur was appointed by the CHMP. 
A kick-off meeting was subsequently organised with the EMA, Rapporteur and assessors from relevant 
scientific committees. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the development programme and 
regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to address the following key issues 
through relevant regulatory procedures: limitations in the manufacturing process, clarification needed for 
assay validation and immunogenicity data (including correlation of protection), clarification on proposed 
indication wording and pre/post-exposure prophylaxis, long-term duration of efficacy, studies in special 
populations, paediatric investigation plan, risk management plan and planning of post-authorisation 
submissions. 
Scientific advice 
The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 23 April 2015 (EMEA/H/SA/3078/1/2015/III) 
and 24 September 2015 (EMEA/H/SA/3078/1/FU/1/2015/III). These were rapid advices in the context of 
the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak. The Scientific advice pertained to the following quality, non-clinical, and 
clinical aspects: 
•  Starting material 
•  Assay validation and PPQ data 
•  Analytical comparability to support changes in manufacturing 
•  Stability studies 
•  Minimum quality requirements in case of an urgent need of the vaccine 
• 
•

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a serious illness that originated in Africa. The first Ebola disease outbreaks 
were reported back in 1976. Since then more than 30 outbreaks have occurred in Africa with more than 
30,000 people affected by the disease and almost 15,000 deaths. The first EVD outbreaks occurred in 
remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa 
involved major urban areas as well as rural ones and was declared a public health emergency of 
international concern (PHEIC) by WHO. The causative agent of the disease is the Ebola virus, a 
negative-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Filoviridae family. Ebola virus infection causes an acute 
often serious illness with variable -but usually high- case fatality rate. The average EVD case fatality rate 
is around 50% but rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks depending on the virus species 
involved. The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population 
through human-to-human transmission. 
On 01 August 2018 the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) declared a new 
outbreak of EVD in North Kivu Province, which is currently ongoing. As of 17 October 2019, 3,228 cases 
of disease have been reported with a death toll of 2,157 cases.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Since the initial identification of Ebola viruses in 1976, more than 20 outbreaks of Ebola disease have 
been reported in sub-Saharan Africa, mostly in Sudan, Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo and 
Gabon. Most of these outbreaks have occurred in isolated rural areas, but the outbreak in Gulu in 2000 
was in a semi-urban area of Uganda. It is conceivable that smaller outbreaks might not have been 
detected. The largest Ebola outbreak to date occurred in 2014–16 in West Africa, predominantly affecting 
both rural and urban areas in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia with very high incidence and mortality 
(>28 000 cases with >11 000 deaths). Due to potential under-reporting the true burden of disease might 
have been even higher. In this outbreak, the overall mean case fatality rate in confirmed cases with 
recorded clinical outcomes was 62.9%. The epidemic peaked in August through October 2014. In March 
2016, the WHO declared the end of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Sierra 
Leone was declared free of Ebola transmission in March 2016. After a few sporadic cases in Liberia and 
Guinea in March/April 2016, these two countries were also declared free of Ebola transmission in June 
2016. 
During the evaluation procedure, the World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak in DRC a 
Public Health Emergency of International Concern. 
So far EVD outbreaks have been restricted to African countries. However, there is a risk that the disease 
could spread to other continents due to e.g. international travel or secondary infection from patients 
coming from African countries (cases were reported in Spain and the US). Unfamiliarity with EVD outside 
of endemic areas can lead to delayed diagnosis of imported cases. 
Beyond the direct morbidity and mortality due to EVD, large outbreaks of the disease have indirect effects 
on population health based on the diversion of resources from programmes aimed at controlling other 
diseases of major importance.  
Ebola virus disease is not an airborne disease and only symptomatic patients are contagious. As 
transmission requires direct contact with bodily fluids, the risk of infection is considered very low if 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019  
Page 11/117 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
precautions are strictly followed. The probability that EU/EEA citizens living in or travelling to 
EVD-affected areas of the DRC will be exposed to the virus is low, provided they adhere to the 
recommended precautionary measures. Nosocomial transmission can occur. Healthcare workers can be 
infected through close contact with infected patients. However, health worker infections are preventable, 
and the risk for infection can be significantly reduced through the appropriate use of infection control 
precautions and adequate barrier procedures. 
A preventive vaccine for EVD could be used to protect individuals at high risk in advance of exposure and 
also to interrupt transmission during an epidemic. Since the monovalent V920 vaccine elicits rapid 
immunity after a single dose, it has the potential for use as prophylactic vaccine to protect against EVD 
caused by Ebola Zaire virus. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Aetiology 
Ebolaviruses (EBOV) belong to the genus Ebolavirus of the Filoviridae family in the order 
Mononegavirales.  All members of this order possess a non-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome of 
19 kb with seven open reading frames, which is encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein (NP). The NP–
RNA complex acts as the template for genome replication and assembles into a helical nucleocapsid (NC) 
along with accessory proteins. EBOV has a striking, filamentous structure of about 800 nm in length and 
80 nm in diameter. The helical nucleocapsid acquires an envelope by budding from the plasma 
membrane. The viral envelope contains spikes consisting of the glycoprotein (GP) trimer. This GP 
molecule achieves the combined functions of attachment to host cells, endosomal entry, and membrane 
fusion.  
The genus Ebolavirus of the Filoviridae family includes five species: Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Reston 
ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, and Zaire ebolavirus. Among them, the Zaire 
ebolavirus, usually called Ebola virus (EBOV), is the main causative agent of human Ebola virus disease 
(EVD) outbreaks. EBOV persists in the environment in a still unidentified animal reservoir, most likely fruit 
bats, which maintain the virus in an enzootic cycle. Human infection represents a sporadic event taking 
place in the context of a human-animal interface. Transmission is mainly due to contact with blood or 
body fluids from infected humans or animals.  
Pathogenesis 
The major route of infection is through the mucosa or skin from where the virus reaches macrophages, 
monocytes, and dendritic cells, leading to spread to regional lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Macrophages 
and monocytes stimulated by EBOV release a “cytokine storm”, which in turn is responsible for damage to 
tissues and blood vessels. Death occurs due to blood loss and/or coagulation. Coagulopathy occurs due to 
thrombocytopenia, loss of anticoagulant protein C, destruction of clotting factors, and also due to 
destruction of fibrin. Damage to blood vessels causes disseminated intravascular coagulation as well as 
renal failure. Antibodies developed against EBOV bind with the complement C1q and reach the binding 
sites on dendritic cells and macrophages, leading to damage of these cells. Lesions related to EVD include 
extensive haemorrhages of the mucosa, necrosis of different organs like liver, kidney, testes, and ovaries. 
Necrotic foci with inflammatory cells can be found in hepatic lobules, and there may be multinucleated 
syncytia formation in the hepatic cells. Necrosis of red pulp and fibrin deposition are the characteristic 
lesions seen in the spleen. Gastrointestinal tract shows mononuclear infiltration into the submucosa and 
lamina propria. Mild emphysema, oedema in the terminal alveoli, and stasis of blood can be noticed in the 
lung parenchyma. It has also been shown that macrophages in the chambers of the eye, brain, and 
epididymis are sites of viral persistence (sanctuary sites).

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stages/prognosis 
Clinical presentation 
Ebola disease is a viral haemorrhagic fever affecting humans and other primates that is caused by 
infection with ebolaviruses. Following an incubation period of 2–21 days, Ebola disease typically starts as 
a non-specific viral syndrome with abrupt onset. At this stage the most frequent symptoms are high fever, 
malaise, fatigue, and body aches (early febrile or mild stage, 0-3 days). These symptoms usually develop 
after a few days into gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea 
(gastrointestinal involvement stage, 3-10 days). These manifestations can range from mild-to-severe, 
with body fluid loss of up to 5–10 L/day. Other, rarer, symptoms are cough and dyspnoea, conjunctival 
injection, hiccups, or localised pain of chest, abdomen, muscles, or joints.  
Part of the patients may recover from this stage; others however will enter into deterioration of 
symptoms, ultimately going into shock, possibly due to hypovolaemia and a systemic inflammatory 
response. At this stage (complicated stage, 7-12 days), patients can present haemorrhagic events, such 
as conjunctival bleeding, petechiae, gastrointestinal bleeding, mucosal haemorrhage. Neurological 
events are rare and include confusion, delirium, and convulsions. Cases of Ebola disease-related 
encephalitis have been reported. Other late symptoms include dysphagia, throat pain, and oral ulcers. A 
maculopapular rash has been described. Exceptionally, sudden death can occur in recovering patients, 
possibly due to cardiac arrhythmias. If patients survive the stage of shock, gradual recovery can occur.  
Irrespective of the severity of the acute disease, Ebola virus tends to persist, specifically in sites where 
immune response is less effective (e.g. the eye, central nervous system, and testis). Persistence is 
associated with clinical sequelae, disease reactivation, long-term virus shedding, and virus transmission. 
Virus found in the seminal fluid can still be infectious and be sexually transmitted for more than a year 
after disease onset. Cases of women transmitting the virus via breastfeeding have been reported, 
although the duration of infectivity by this route is unknown. Reports suggest that other reservoirs and 
other human-to-human transmission routes of persisting virus in humans could still be uncovered.  
Laboratory features include variable degrees of anaemia and thrombocytopenia as well as changes in 
number and type of white blood cells. Renal dysfunction (in up to 50% of case) and substantial increases 
in liver enzymes are common. Likewise, creatine phosphokinase and amylase concentrations can be 
increased. Electrolyte abnormalities are common, especially hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, and 
hypocalcaemia. Clotting tests can indicate a varying degree of intravascular coagulation. Metabolic 
acidosis can occur, particularly in cases of shock and renal failure. 
High viral loads, combined with severe muscle breakdown and renal impairment, have consistently been 
predictive of death. Differences in severity of clinical events and outcome might exist between young 
children, young adults, and older people. Pregnant women face higher mortality and risk of miscarriage 
and stillbirth. Clinical presentation can be aggravated by concurrent comorbidities and infections, such as 
malaria and bacterial sepsis. Clinical signs and symptoms have varied across the different Ebola 
outbreaks reported during the last decades. This variation is at least partly due to the specific outbreak 
context and the ebolavirus species involved. For example, haemorrhagic events were highly prevalent in 
the 1976 outbreak in Yambuku, but less so in many other outbreaks, including the 2013-2016 West 
African one in which haemorrhage was uncommon. Furthermore, during the West African outbreak, fever 
was absent in at least 10% of the cases. 
Diagnosis 
Diagnosis of EVD on the basis of clinical symptoms can be difficult as clinical manifestations are similar to 
those of other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis. Confirmation that 
symptoms are caused by EBOV infection are made using diagnostic laboratory methods:

antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  
antigen-capture detection tests 
serum neutralization test 
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay 
electron microscopy 
virus isolation by cell culture 
RT-PCR tests were the cornerstone of the laboratory response during the 2014–16 West African outbreak. 
However, for many years the main methods for detection of filoviruses has been virus isolation in cell 
culture from patient specimens.  
Viral load peaks 3–7 days after the onset of symptoms. When patients with EVD present at a hospital, 
typically 3–6 days after the onset of the symptoms, the viral load is already high and detectable in the 
patient’s blood by RT-PCR in most cases. In fatal cases, viremia is usually 10–100 folds higher than in 
survivors. IgG and IgM humoral responses develop in survivors but not in all fatal cases thus, diagnosing 
of EVD using serology is only possible in a fraction of symptomatic patients and requires seroconversion 
or a substantial increase in antibody titre in paired serum samples. However, serology is the method of 
choice to diagnose asymptomatic Ebola virus infections, which are characterised by extremely low viremia 
and development of IgG and IgM about 3 weeks after infection. Another technique also used for 
post-mortem diagnosis is antigen detection by immunohistochemistry on a skin biopsy.   
During the acute phase of the disease and convalescence, viral RNA can be detected by RT-PCR in other 
body fluids, such as saliva, tears, sweat, breast milk, urine, CSF, ocular fluid, amniotic fluid, vaginal fluid, 
and seminal fluid. Viral RNA can remain detectable in these fluids after the RT-PCR on blood becomes 
negative.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Therapeutics 
No specific treatment for EVD is currently available. Most investigational therapies for Ebola virus disease 
aim at the reduction of viral replication to limit the inflammatory storm triggered by viral expansion. Some 
of these investigational treatments were tested during the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, but 
clinical trials failed to confirm efficacy of any treatment. Nevertheless, promising experimental 
interventions were identified. Therapeutics under investigation include ZMapp (Mapp 
Biopharmaceuticals), a drug comprised of 3 chimeric monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) manufactured in 
Nicotiana benthamiana, the nucleoside analogue inhibitors remdesivir (GS-5734; Gilead Sciences) and 
BCX4430 (BioCryst Pharmaceuticals), the selective RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor favipiravir 
(MediVector), the mAb cocktail REGN3470-3471-3479 (REGNEB3; Regeneron Biopharma), and 
single-therapy mAb, VRC-EBOMAB092-00-AB (mAb114; Vaccine Research Centre, NIH). Recently 
interim analysis information was released regarding the PALM trial in DRC, which is a randomized 
controlled trial of four investigational agents (ZMapp, remdesivir, mAb114 and REGN-EB3), based on 
which RGN-EB3 and mAb114 seem more promising. 
In addition, effective drugs that pass the blood–brain barrier are needed for the management of clinical 
recurrence of Ebola virus disease and to penetrate immunologically and anatomically preserved sites and 
reservoirs in survivors beyond the acute phase of the disease.  
Currently, management of EVD patients consists on supportive and critical care. Supportive care, i.e. 
rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids and treatment of specific symptoms, improves survival. In 
Assessment report

addition, symptomatic treatment for concurrent infections is provided, tailored to the needs of individual 
patients. 
Prophylaxis 
No vaccine against EVD is currently authorised in Europe. Two Ebola vaccines (based on adenovirus 
constructs) were recently approved in Russia and China, but data seem limited.  
In addition to this application for Ervebo, the adenovirus 26 vector EBOV glycoprotein / MVA-BN 
(Ad26.ZEBOV/ MVA-BN) vaccine regimen developed by Janssen represents another candidate vaccine 
that has recently been recommended by WHO SAGE after assessment of available data for use in the 
ongoing DRC outbreak in lower risk populations and with informed consent.  
There is an urgent unmet medical need for efficacious and safe preventive vaccines. 
About the product 
Ervebo (or V920 vaccine as this report will refer to) is a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) 
whose gene encoding for the VSV glycoprotein G has been replaced by the gene encoding for the Zaire 
Ebola virus (Kikwit strain) glycoprotein (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP). The vaccine is a genetically engineered, 
replication-competent, attenuated live vaccine that induces immune responses after a single dose. The 
relative contributions of innate, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to protection from Zaire 
Ebola virus are unknown. 
The pharmacotherapeutic group is viral vaccines (ATC Code J07BX02).  
The vaccine is manufactured in serum-free Vero cell cultures. The virus is harvested from the cell culture 
medium, purified, and frozen to produce the Bulk Drug Substance (BDS). The vaccine Drug Product is a 
solution for injection manufactured by aseptic addition of the BDS to the Drug Product Stabilizer Solution, 
which contains 2.5 mg/mL rice derived recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) and 10 mM Tris buffer. 
This vaccine contains a trace amount of rice protein. The vaccine must be transported and stored frozen 
at -80°C to -60ºC. 
The proposed indication for V920 is for active immunization of at-risk individuals 18 years of age and older 
to protect against Ebola virus disease caused by Zaire Ebola virus. 
The proposed posology is 1 mL of ≥72 million plaque forming units (pfu) administered as a solution for 
injection through intramuscular administration.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered 
to be of major public health interest. This was based on i) the severity and mortality of the disease to be 
prevented, ii) the unmet medical need due to lack of authorised vaccines or therapeutics for EVD, iii) the 
V920 efficacy and safety data, which indicated that the vaccine was immunogenic, protective and 
generally well tolerated. Although certain challenges with maintenance of an accelerated assessment 
were identified in the pre-submission stage (e.g. generation of certain pharmaceutical data, a new 
manufacturing site requiring conduct of an inspection during the assessment, and the suitability of batch 
control testing sites), these limitations were accepted in the context of the urgent high unmet medical 
need and promising clinical data. 
During the assessment, the possibility of a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in accordance with Article 
14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 was considered, taking into account the nature of the target 
condition, emergency situation and applicant’s position on the following criteria:

The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. The applicant provided an 
exhaustive plan to generate the final process validation and comparability data for V920 Drug 
Substance and Drug Product, which would enable through the fulfilment of the SOs to submit an 
application to convert the CMA into a full registration by October 2020. The applicant´s ability to 
provide a comprehensive quality dossier is also supported by the two GMP inspections carried out 
at Burgwedel Biotech GmbH (Burgwedel) in March 2019 and July 2019 by the local health 
authority GAA, which led to the issuance of GMP certificates and MIA for the site in question. The 
Applicant considers that the final process validation and comparability reports will confirm the 
positive benefit-risk assessment of V920 and define a comprehensive quality dossier for the 
medicinal product. The Specific Obligations proposed by the applicant in Annex II of the SmPC 
(Section E) define stringent regulatory oversight to ensure submission of emerging CMC 
information in a specific timeframe. Moreover, the applicant will continue to maintain the EMA and 
all other stakeholders updated about any acceleration of the manufacturing schedule in 
consideration of the ongoing EVD emergency. 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as V920 has shown to have high protective efficacy and 
effectiveness in the prevention of EVD, and the data submitted in the framework of the MAA 
procedure demonstrate that the vaccine has the potential to fulfil unmet medical needs both in 
endemic and non-endemic regions. In addition V920 was generally well tolerated and had a 
favourable safety profile.  
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required. Ebola virus is a serious pathogen responsible for an unprecedented 
epidemic in West Africa in 2014-2016, which led to a case fatality rate of approximately 40%. 
Recently, the WHO declared a PHEIC in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC – North Kivu) due to 
the ongoing outbreak of EVD in that region. The CMA would ensure expedited EU approval, and this 
will translate into an accelerated WHO prequalification step and consequent early collaborative 
registration by AVAREF countries. It would also ensure earlier availability of licensed supplies to 
African countries on the grounds that an expedited approval of the artwork will allow faster ramp-up 
of manufacturing activities and supply of licensed doses. Use of a licensed product will remove the 
requirements for GCP training and informed consent, which will accelerate the public health 
response. Furthermore, use of a licensed product will support vaccination of European health care 
workers who are being deployed to support the African outbreak currently ongoing under emergency 
frameworks in some European countries. The applicant is ensuring that V920 is consistently 
produced and controlled according to quality standards and is minimizing the risks involved in 
pharmaceutical production that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product. The adoption 
of the CMA, together with the current accelerated review timetable, will translate into a significant 
benefit from a public health perspective, which is supported by the overall evidence generated.

envelope glycoprotein (G) replaced with the Zaire Ebola Virus (ZEBOV) Kikwit 1995 strain surface 
glycoprotein (GP) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: recombinant human serum albumin, trometamol (Tris) buffer and water for 
injection. Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide are used for pH-adjustment. 
The product is available in a single-dose vial (type I glass) with a stopper (chlorobutyl) and a flip-off 
plastic cap with aluminium seal. The product is available in a pack size of 10 vials. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance (AS) (also referred to as the bulk active substance-BAS), (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP, live 
attenuated) is a live, recombinant viral vaccine. 
The  Ebola  Zaire  Vaccine  (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP,  live  attenuated)  is  a  recombinant  virus  consisting  of  a 
single  recombinant  VSV  isolate  (11481  nt,  strain  Indiana)  with  the  gene  for  the  Zaire  Ebolavirus  GP 
(ZEBOV-GP), Kikwit strain replacing the gene for the VSV-GP, which has been deleted. This results in a 
VSV backbone with the ZEBOV-GP constituting the envelope of the virus. As for similar chimeric vaccines, 
substitution of the native virus GP with a heterologous GP leads to significant attenuation of the virus. 
The active substance of Ervebo has never been registered in the European Union and is qualified as a new 
active substance.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The sites responsible for manufacturing, testing and storage of the master/working cell banks and master 
virus  seed  and  BAS  are  provided.  The  manufacturing  site  for  AS  commercial  production  (MSD 
Site-Burgwedel  Biotech  GmbH,  Im  Langen  Felde  5,  30938  Burgwedel,  Germany)  has  a  valid 
Manufacturing and Importation Authorisation (MIA) and GMP certificate.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacture of the BAS consists of two main parts, the upstream process, which produces the virus, 
and  the  downstream  process,  which  purifies  the  virus.  The  BAS  manufacturing  process  starts  with 
thawing of a vial of the Vero Working Cell bank (WCB). Vero cells are expanded (first steps in flasks, then 
in roller bottles) via several passaging steps. When a sufficiently high number of cells have been achieved, 
cells are infected with the Master Virus Seed (MVS). After incubation, the supernatant fluid (containing 
the  recombinant  virus)  is  harvested.  The  harvest  is  clarified  using  depth  filtration.  Subsequently,  the 
clarified  harvest  is  treated  with  benzonase  (enzyme  to  digest  residual  Vero  cell  DNA).  The  resulting 
intermediate  is  called  the  reacted  viral  harvest,  which  is  further  purified  and  concentrated  via 
ultrafiltration/diafiltration. The ultrafiltered product (UFP) is then formulated into BAS by addition of Tris 
(trometamol) buffer and recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA). After mixing, the BAS is filled in

specified bags, frozen and stored between -80°C and -60°C. No reprocessing is performed. In-process 
controls are adequately set to control the process. Details of the container-closure system are provided. 
Control of materials 
All  raw  materials,  culture  media  and  reagent  solutions  used  in  the  BAS  manufacturing  process  are 
described. All raw materials are tested to standards appropriate for their intended use.  The qualitative 
composition  of  the  media  used  during  manufacturing  is  provided.  Irradiated  bovine  serum 
(BSE/TSE-free) was used for development and cryopreservation of the MCB. 
No materials of primary human or animal origin are used in the manufacture of BAS. Two raw materials, 
VP-SFM 1X and benzonase, utilise animal-derived components in their manufacturing processes. Based 
on  the  manufacturing  processes  and  the  testing,  the  risk  for  viral  contamination  is  considered  to  be 
negligible. 
VP-SFM 1X medium contains recombinant human insulin which is derived through yeast (Pichia pastoris) 
fermentation.  During  purification  of  insulin,  porcine  pancrease  trypsin  is  used.  The  porcine  trypsin  is 
obtained  from  USDA  licensed  facilities  sourced  from  healthy  animals  of  USA  origin.  Porcine  trypsin 
undergoes a low pH hold step employed for viral inactivation purposes and does not incorporate the use 
of bovine lactose. 
Benzonase is an enzyme derived from E. coli fermentation. The medium used for E. coli fermentation 
contains casamino acids derived from bovine milk sourced from healthy animals in Australia and New 
Zealand. Casamino acids are isolated using low pH conditions at elevated temperature for an extended 
period of time followed by oven drying at high heat for an additional extended time. Furthermore, the 
medium containing the casamino acids is sterilised-in-place using elevated temperature and pressure. 
Quality of the raw materials was adequately described (compliant with Ph.Eur. or controlled by in-house 
specifications). 
The master cell bank (MCB) was manufactured by IDT Biologika GmbH using the WHO reference cell bank 
as  starting  material.  Cells  are  stored  frozen  and  kept  in  cryopreservation  medium  containing  30% 
irradiated fetal bovine serum and 10% DMSO. The MCB was extensively tested for qualification.  
The working cell bank (WCB) was manufactured by Merck, West Point, USA using the IDT MCB as starting 
material. Cells are stored frozen in serum-free medium containing 20% DMSO in the vapour phase of 
liquid  nitrogen.  The  WCB  was  extensively  tested  for  qualification.  Some  further  testing  to  complete 
qualification is required (see list of specific obligations). The testing plan for the WCB included in the CTD 
is deemed sufficient. 
The  cloning  of  the  rVSV  ZEBOV-GP  virus  consists  of  reverse  genetics  placing  the  ZEBOV  envelope 
glycoprotein  gene  into  the  genome  of  the  Indiana  strain  of  vesicular  stomatitis  virus  (VSV)  as  a 
substitution  for  the  fusogenic  VSV–G  envelope  glycoprotein.  One  clone  was  selected  to  become  the 
premaster virus and was tested and then amplified with cells from the Vero MCB to create the pre-master 
virus seed. Vero cells sourced from the master cell bank were expanded (in serum-free medium) and used 
to  manufacture  the  master  virus  seed  (MVS)  which  is  stored  frozen  at  -80  to  -60  °C.  The  MSV  was 
extensively tested for qualification. Genetic stability was demonstrated from master virus seed to one 
viral passage beyond GMP manufacturing level. A WVS has been established. This WVS will be qualified 
and implemented via a variation procedure post approval in order to have a two-tiered virus seed system 
but in the meantime, it is acceptable to initiate the manufacturing process directly from the MSV. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) are defined as process parameters that must be controlled and/or 
monitored within an established range to ensure quality attributes are met. A critical quality attribute 
Assessment report

(CQA) is a physical, chemical, biological or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within 
an  appropriate  limit,  range,  or  distribution  to  ensure  the  desired  product  quality.  CPPs  for  BAS 
manufacturing  arise  in  unit  operations  describing  cell  passage,  virus  harvest,  ultrafiltration  and 
formulation.  
CQAs are tested as a part of BAS release. Control cells and harvested control fluid, harvested viral fluid, 
and bulk BAS are also sampled and tested. Overall, acceptable information has been provided on the 
control system in place to monitor and control the active substance manufacturing process with regard to 
critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. 
Process validation 
AS process validation-PV (or process performance qualification- PPQ) results are only partially available. 
Process  validation  for  AS  is  still  ongoing.  Data  from  1  representative  AS  lot  and  1  engineering  batch 
(which may be considered as representative) were provided. For these lots, the process operated within 
acceptable  limits  and  the  QC  test  results  were  within  the  acceptance  criteria  and  compliant  with  the 
specifications. The Burgwedel commercial process is identical to the West Point clinical lot process (also 
produced  at  the  same  scale).  As  such,  if  controlled  according  to  the  described  control  strategy,  the 
process is expected to yield AS of the same quality as at the West Point site. West point material produced 
thus  far  has  been  shown  to  be  of  adequate  and  consistent  quality.  Taken  together,  these  data  are 
considered to be sufficient to support granting of a conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) at this point 
in  time.  Additional  AS  PPQ  data  are  requested  to  be  provided  post-approval  to  complete  the  process 
validation dataset for the active substance as a specific obligation to the marketing authorisation (See 
discussion section for more detail). 
Results from container-closure integrity and extractable/ leachable studies have been provided and are 
considered to be adequate.  
Manufacturing process development 
The bulk active substance (BAS) manufacturing process was developed in three stages. 
The BAS manufacturing process was initially developed at IDT Biologika, Germany. At IDT Biologika, a 
total of thirteen BAS lots and ten finished product lots (FP) were manufactured. Five of the FP lots were 
utilised in clinical trials, including the ring vaccination trial conducted in Guinea during the 2014-2016 
outbreaks. 
The BAS process was slightly modified, upscaled and transferred to Merck West Point (PA, US). Additional 
clinical batches were manufactured at Merck West Point. The BAS manufacturing campaign included four 
lots,  which  were  manufactured  with  a  modified  process  from  IDT  Biologika.  Analysis  of  BAS  lots 
manufactured  by  IDT  Biologika  and  Merck  West  Point  indicated  that  both  processes  generated 
comparable BAS. The manufacturing process developed at IDT Biologika involved cell culture utilising a 
Vero  MCB  and  infection  using  a  MVS,  both  manufactured  by  IDT  Biologika.  However,  Merck  West 
Point-EUAL lots utilised a Working Cell Bank (WCB) that was manufactured at Merck West Point which was 
derived from the IDT Biologika MCB. Merck emergency use assessment and listing (EUAL) lots utilised the 
MVS manufactured by IDT Biologika. 
The active substance for the commercial product will be manufactured at the Burgwedel site (Germany). 
Only minor modifications were introduced in the Burgwedel process (same scale as Merck West Point 
process). 
Although FP lots that comply with the specifications (formulated using within-specification AS lots) are 
expected to behave similarly in terms of potency as the clinical batches, comparability between clinical 
material and commercial BAS/FP from Burgwedel needs to be formally demonstrated. These data are 
requested to be provided post-approval as a specific obligation to the Marketing Authorisation.

IDT Biologika developed a potency assay (plaque assay), which was used to release clinical materials. A 
different version of the plaque assay has since been validated at Eurofins Lancaster Laboratories, Inc. 
(ELLI, Lancaster, PA) and will be used for commercial release testing and all future stability studies. The 
ELLI potency method was developed by MSD based on the initial plaque assay used at IDT Biologika with 
several changes. Both methods have been validated. Although both methods generate reportable results 
using PFU/mL as the unit of measure, the two methods are independent of each other and differ in a 
variety  of  parameters  such  as  test  vessel,  cell  incubation  time  and  incubation  time  post  inoculation. 
Furthermore,  there  is  no  reference  standard  to  which  results  are  adjusted,  thus  differences  due  to 
multiple factors may result in different reportable potencies. According to the company, the urgent timing 
associated with the development of this product to support the manufacture of emergency use material 
did not allow for a complete bridging study powered to support commercial manufacture. The estimated 
difference between the two methods was calculated and indicating that the ELLI results are overall slightly 
higher than the IDT Biologika results. This estimated difference was calculated based on data obtained for 
3 AS batches. In order to generate potency specifications that are linked to clinical efficacy and safety, 
clinical batches released using the IDT potency assay were retested using the validated ELLI potency 
assay. Since long term stability studies to date have shown no loss in potency, the geometric mean of all 
of the time points has been calculated for the IDT assay results. The values obtained through the retest 
at  ELLI  in  comparison  with  the  long-term  stability  data  from  IDT  Biologika  are  consistent  with  the 
difference calculated between the methods. The difference between the two methods was slightly larger 
than  initially  observed  when  comparing  3  AS  lots.  However,  this  difference  can  be  considered  a 
consequence  of  the  assay  variability  and  is  therefore  not  unexpected.  Overall,  therefore  use  of  the 
validated ELLI potency method for commercial testing is justified.  
The applicant has provided the individual batch data (including results for CQAs, total protein, host cell 
protein, host cell DNA, Tryple activity (residual medium), residual benzonase and aggregate analysis, 
when available) of all AS batches produced by IDT Biologika and by Merck West Point. It was indicated 
which batches have been used in the clinical trials (that were found to meet the clinical parameters for 
safety and efficacy), as well as which batches have been used in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It was 
also clearly indicated which potency assay was used for each of these batches. Batches met specifications 
in force at the time. 
Characterisation 
Two distinct genetic stability assessments have been performed. Virus produced at 3 consecutive viral 
passage levels was sequenced. No consensus nucleotide changes were observed. The applicant provided 
a detailed description of the genetic stability analysis of the recombinant virus.  
The amount of free Ebola glycoprotein was evaluated as a possible CQA. It is suggested that free Ebola GP 
(shed GP, sGP) could result in some of the pathogenic effects of Ebola infection. When examining the 
vaccine sequence, it was determined that the coding region is predicted to preferentially translate the full 
GP  and  not  the  sGP  construct.  Furthermore,  the  downstream  purification  will  significantly  reduce  any 
free/soluble protein such as the free-GP in the final BAS. Since other markers of protein clearance have 
been evaluated during  analytical  comparability  between  the IDT  Biologika  manufacturing  process  and 
MSD Site-Burgwedel Biotech GmbH manufacturing process, it was concluded that the free Ebola-GP itself 
is not considered a CQA. 
Particle  distribution  and  aggregation  have  been  assessed.  Flow  cytometry-based  analysis  shows  no 
observable aggregation. The results also show no apparent change in the viral particle size or distribution 
after storage at 37°C for 24 hours, while the plaque assay shows a significant decrease in the infectivity 
of this material.

A comparison of the genome quantification data and genome particles/plaque forming units (pfu) ratios 
was  performed.  The  genome  copy:PFU  ratio  appears  consistent  across  different  lots  manufactured  at 
different facilities and different scales. 
Potency  was  assessed  on  various  BAS  lots  at  different  stages  during  production  (harvest,  clarified 
harvest, reacted harvest, bulk active substance). Potency was shown to be consistent between different 
lots for all stages. 
Harvested virus fluid samples from the PPQ campaign were subjected to next generation sequencing to 
provide evidence of virus identity and genetic stability. 
Measurement  of  process  residuals  and  host  cell  impurities  (HCP)  during  process  development  has 
demonstrated sufficient removal of impurities during the BAS process. The consistency of benzonase and 
host  cell  protein  (HCP)  clearance  through  the  ultrafiltration  process  was  shown.  HCP  clearance  was 
determined to be >93%, thus reducing HCP to clearly acceptable levels in the ng/mL range. Furthermore, 
benzonase clearance (>99%) may be an appropriate surrogate for HCP clearance, given the consistent 
patterns observed for the two markers. The following residuals and host cell impurities are assumed to be 
cleared  similarly  to  benzonase  (~30  kDa),  a  surrogate  for  similar  and  smaller  molecular  weight 
impurities: TrypLE, EDTA and trypsin inhibitor. Stated impurities have been present in product used in 
clinical trials. 
Characterisation has been performed for AS material from IDT Biologika and/or Merck West Point. The 
active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological state-of-the-art 
methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure.

The  AS  release  specifications  are  presented.  Release  tests  include  testing  on  control  cells  and  the 
harvested control fluids (cell culture), on the harvest and on the bulk active substance.  
Host cell DNA and residual benzonase content are considered important quality attributes of the active 
substance that should at least be determined until enough evidence has been generated to conclude on 
the robust and reliable reduction of these impurities below an acceptable limit. The applicant has included 
testing for host cell DNA and residual benzonase as an in-process control (IPC) with acceptance criteria. 
Upon demonstration of consistency on a sufficiently high number of batches, these routine tests may be 
removed. 
As regards host cell protein, the applicant will monitor HCP via total protein analysis at the level of the 
ultrafiltration product. Upon qualification, this method will be implemented post-approval as an IPC in the 
relevant  sections  of  the  CTD  (see  list  of  specific  obligations).  The  applicant  will  retroactively  test 
previously manufactured AS PPQ lots (AS PPQ lots 1, 2, 4, and 5). The applicant will also mention IPC 
results  of  impurity  testing  on  the  release  certificates  and  on  the  information  provided  to  the  Official 
Medicines  Control  Laboratory  (OMCL).  Given  that  benzonase  clearance  may  be  indicative  for  HCP 
clearance, the applicant’s approach to temporarily release AS lots without result for total protein at UF 
product is acceptable, provided the residual benzonase levels are within the acceptance limits. 
Analytical methods 
Descriptions  were  provided  for  the  analytical  methods  used  for  AS  release  testing.  All  methods  were 
properly validated or qualified (see separate discussion on identity assay below). The following methods 
were performed as described by Ph.Eur.: haemadsorption, sterility, mycoplasma (PCR, indicator cell line 
and  broth  and  agar),  mycobacteria,  pH  and  appearance.  Non-compendial  methods  included  cell  line 
identity by cytochrome oxidase testing, adventitious agents in vitro, adventitious agents in vivo, reverse 
transcriptase activity, identity and potency.

Potency assay: The potency of the BAS is obtained using a plaque assay. The plaque assay is a test in 
which a dilute solution of virus is applied to a tissue culture dish containing a layer of host cells. After 
incubation, cells are stained for visualisation and the plaques are counted. The number of infective virus 
particles in the original solution is estimated based on the number of plaques.  
Identity assay: For the identity assay, a plaque assay (similar to the potency assay) is performed which 
is followed by an immunostaining. 100% of the plaques must be positive by immunostaining to confirm 
the identity of the sample as Ebola Zaire BAS. Because of the criticality of the polyclonal antibody (used 
for  identity  release  test),  additional  data  is  required  to  complete  the  qualification.  As  part  of  the 
qualification of the polyclonal antibody therefore, to demonstrate the specificity of the polyclonal antibody, 
the  company  should  also  include  a  negative  control  with  Vero  cells  infected  with  wild  type  vesicular 
stomatitis virus: these should also yield a negative result (see list of specific obligations). 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch data of the AS PPQ batches were not yet available at the time of MAA submission. These have been 
requested to be provided post-approval as a specific obligations to the Marketing Authorisation. However, 
an appropriate number of BAS lots have been produced (at IDT Biologika, Germany, and Merck West Point 
(PA, US)) of which some have been used to manufacture several FP used in clinical studies. The active 
substance for the commercial product will be manufactured at the Burgwedel site (Germany). Only minor 
modifications were introduced in the Burgwedel process (same scale as Merck West Point process) and 
the specifications are similar. Therefore, the submission of AS PPQ batch data post-approval is justified. 
Reference materials 
No reference standards are used in testing of the BAS. However appropriate positive controls (which need 
to be within established acceptance criteria) are used to verify validity of the potency assay in order to 
confirm the correctness of the potency results. 
Container closure system 
BAS is stored frozen at -70°C +/-10°C in single-use specified bags. The bags comply with compendial 
criteria.  Suitability  and  compatibility  of  the  bags  was  demonstrated.  Extractables  testing  has  been 
performed; the outcome of a study to define the need for them indicated that no leachables testing was 
required.  
Stability 
The applicant proposes a specified AS shelf life when stored at -70±10°C.  
An expiry extension is planned to be filed when real time stability data from three or more historical lots 
become available. 
The applicant has provided some stability data for the IDT Biologika lots and Merck West Point lots.  
Real time stability data (below -60°C) are available for specified IDT Biologika lots and for Merck West 
Point lots. All results comply with the specifications. No decrease or trend is observed for potency (also 
not at specified accelerated conditions). These batches are considered to be representative enough for 
the commercial site and can therefore be considered to support the claimed shelf life until additional data 
are available. Stability data for AS from the commercial Burgwedel site will be provided post-approval.

Current data support the proposed shelf life. However, the applicant is requested to complete the package 
of supporting stability data by fully demonstrating the comparability of Burgwedel PPQ batches with the 
clinical batches as a specific obligation to the Marketing Authorisation. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The vaccine finished product is a solution for injection manufactured by aseptic addition of the BAS to the 
finished  product  stabiliser  solution,  which  consists  of  recombinant  human  serum  albumin  (rHSA), 
Trometamol, and Water for Injection. The vaccine is filled at a volume of 1 ml into single-dose vials. The 
glass vial is stoppered and capped with flip-off plastic caps and aluminium overseals. The FP appears as 
a colourless to slightly brownish yellow liquid with no particulates visible. The composition of the final FP 
is provided in table 1 below. There are no overages. The current FP formulation has the same composition 
and pharmaceutical form as that used in historical clinical trials where safety and efficacy was established.

The  recombinant  human  serum  albumin  is  considered  a  novel  excipient.  Detailed  information  was 
provided  on  the  structure;  general  properties,  manufacturer,  manufacturing  process  and  controls, 
characterisation, specifications, analytical methods, batch data, container and stability of the rHSA. The 
lyophilised rHSA is manufactured and released by a third company in compliance with a defined set of 
specifications (including purity), and this product has a limited shelf life. The stabiliser solution contains 
rHSA,  Tris  buffer  and  WFI  (Tris  and  WFI  comply  with  Ph.Eur.),  and  has  a  specified  shelf  life.  The 
specifications of the stabiliser solution were provided. Information on the manufacture of the stabiliser 
solution (including process controls) is described in the MAA. The buffer is purchased from a qualified 
supplier.

The FP has been manufactured at the following facilities: 1) IDT Biologika GmbH, Germany; 2) Merck 
West Point, Pennsylvania; 3) MSD Site-Burgwedel Biotech GmbH, Germany. 
There have been no major changes during the manufacturing process development. For the first batches, 
different  stopper  material  and  already  sterilised  buffer  has  been  used.  There  are  small  differences 
between the manufacturing processes in West Point and Burgwedel, which are considered to be marginal. 
In  addition,  there  have  been  no  changes  in  the  product  composition  or  pharmaceutical  form  during 
development. A risk assessment approach was used throughout the development of the FP manufacturing 
process. The purpose of the process risk assessments were as follows: 1) Identify parameters that are 
most likely to impact product quality and process performance to guide and prioritise the focus of process 
development and Process Performance Qualification readiness activities; 2) Understand and document 
the  relationship  between  product  and  process  attributes  and  process  parameters  and  materials;  3) 
Identify process failure modes and mitigation plans to support the process control strategy.  Development 
studies were identified and executed based on the initial risk assessment.   
As already stated, IDT Biologika developed the potency assay (plaque assay), which was used to release 
clinical  materials  and  a  different  version  of  the  plaque  assay  was  validated  at  Eurofins  Lancaster 
Laboratories, Inc. (ELLI, Lancaster, PA) to be used for commercial release testing and all future stability 
studies. The ELLI potency method was developed by MSD based on the initial plaque assay used at IDT 
Biologika with several changes to ensure a robust method. Both methods have been validated. The results 
obtained by the ELLI method are slightly higher than those obtained by the IDT method (but still within 
method variability). This is acceptable. 
The  FP  container  closure  system  consists  of  a  2R  Type-1  class  B  borosilicate  clear  glass  tubing  vial 
(compliant  with  Ph.Eur),  a  13  mm  chlorobutyl  stopper  (compliant  with  Ph.Eur)  and  a  13  mm  flip-off 
aluminium seal. Extractables testing of the vials and the stoppers has been performed.  
Ervebo is provided in single-dose vials without preservative. The FP is manufactured by aseptic addition 
of sterile BAS and FP stabiliser solution. The formulated bulk is aseptically filled into vials. Sterility testing 
is included as part of release testing. Process simulations verify the robustness of the aseptic processing 
steps. Additional integrity of the filled vials is provided by container closure integrity (CCI) validation.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Product specification 
The FP release and stability specifications are provided and include appropriate specifications for identity, 
potency,  purity  and  physico-chemical  attributes.  The  proposed  specifications  are  considered  to  be 
properly justified. Identity testing (which is considered as complementary to the plaque assay to assess 
potency) will also be performed on 3 FP lots during stability testing.  
The  currently  proposed  batch  control  testing  sites  are  located  in  the  US.  The  finished  product 
manufacturing site is currently unable to place a unique identifier on the FP. See discussion below. 
Analytical methods 
Descriptions  were  provided  for  the  analytical  methods  used  for  FP  release  testing.  All  methods  were 
properly validated or qualified. Specified methods were performed as described by Ph.Eur. 
The potency assay and the identity assay are the same as the ones used for the active substance. AS and 
FP have the same matrix (only the virus titre is different).

Batch analysis 
The applicant has provided the individual batch data from a number of FP batches produced thus far (from 
IDT and  from West Point), including batches used in the clinical trials (that were found to meet the clinical 
parameters for safety and efficacy), as well as batches that have been used in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo. Batch data complied with specifications in force at that time. It was also clearly indicated which 
potency assay was used for each of these batches. The applicant should provide the FP batch analysis 
data of the PPQ batches (Burgwedel site) (see list of specific obligations). 
Regarding impurities, residual host cell DNA and residual benzonase tests are performed on BAS but the 
acceptance criteria are applied to the final filled container by calculation. The potential risks related to 
elemental  impurities  have  been  suitably  evaluated.  No  additional  impurities  are  introduced  in  the 
formulation and filling process of Ervebo. 
Reference materials 
No reference standards are used in testing of the FP. However appropriate positive controls (which need 
to be within established acceptance criteria) are used to verify validity of the potency assay in order to 
confirm the correctness of the potency results. 
Stability of the product 
A FP shelf life of is 36 months for finished product stored at -70±10°C is proposed.  
An expiry extension to up to 60 months is planned to be filed when real time stability data from three or 
more historical lots become available. 
The applicant has provided stability data for the IDT Biologika lots and Merck West Point lots. Stability 
data for FP from the commercial Burgwedel site will be provided post-approval. For the stability testing of 
the 3 FP PPQ lots from Burgwedel, the applicant will also include identity testing. The identity assay does 
not  only  serve  to  confirm  correct  identity  but  also  to  complement  the  potency  assay.  The  PFU  assay 
(proposed  potency  assay)  only  measures  the  titre  of  the  recombinant  virus  but  does  not  provide 
information about the expression of the GP. As such, a combination of the potency assay (PFU assay) and 
identity assay (GP immunostaining) is considered necessary to properly assess potency during shelf life 
(stability testing). 
Real time stability data (below -60°C) are available up to 48 months for 8 IDT Biologika lots and 3 Merck 
West Point lots. All results comply with the specifications. No decrease or trend is observed for potency 
(also not at accelerated conditions, i.e. at -40°C).  
Preliminary  evaluation  indicated  that  the  vaccine  product  may  be  sensitive  to  light  exposure.  The 
secondary packaging (market box) is expected to protect vaccine vials from light. Samples from full scale 
batches will be subjected to a confirmatory photo-stability study and to demonstrate that the secondary 
packaging (market box) protects the FP from light exposure. The SmPC states that the vial should be kept 
in the outer carton in order to protect from light.  
The SmPC also states ‘After thawing, the vaccine should be used immediately; however, in-use stability 
data have demonstrated that once thawed, the vaccine can be stored for up to 14 days at 2°C to 8°C prior 
to use. At the end of 14 days, the vaccine should be used or discarded. Upon removal from the freezer, 
the product should be marked with both the date that it was taken out of the freezer and also a new 
discard date (in place of the labelled expiry date). Once thawed, the vaccine cannot be re-frozen.’ 
Confirmatory studies will be performed to support post-thaw product exposure to elevated temperature 
and exposure times. A total of 2 weeks at 2–8°C and 4 hours at up to 25°C are supported by the potency

specification  assessment.  Stability  testing,  after  samples  are  exposed  to  the  elevated  temperature  / 
times, will be performed to further support the allowance time period.  
The stability data support the proposed shelf life of 3 years. A shelf life of 3 years for the commercial FP 
is  therefore  acceptable.  Comparability  must  however  be  comprehensively  demonstrated  between 
Burgwedel  batches  and  AS/FP  material  from  IDT  and  West  Point.  These  data  are  requested 
post-authorisation as a specific obligation to the Marketing Authorisation. 
Adventitious agents 
Cell substrates, virus seeds, and raw materials used during manufacture of Ervebo are rigorously tested, 
using validated methods, to provide high confidence that extraneous agents are not present in the FP. The 
seed viruses are derived from Vero cell systems under conditions similar to those used in the vaccine bulk 
production.  Two  raw  materials,  namely  VP-SFM  1X  (which  contains  recombinant  human insulin  which 
itself uses porcine trypsin in its manufacture and also used for cell bank establishment) and benzonase 
(produced  using  bovine  milk  fit  for  human  consumption),  utilise  animal-derived  components  in  their 
respective  manufacturing  processes.  VP-SFM  1X  is  used  during  cell  bank  and  active  substance 
manufacture and benzonase only in AS manufacture. The master virus seed and the cell bank system 
were properly tested. No animal-derived materials are used in the manufacturing processes of AS and FP. 
Risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) contamination is negligible. Irradiated bovine serum 
was used for development and cryopreservation of the MCB.  
During AS/FP production, various routine testing is performed to guarantee the absence of adventitious 
agents. BAS is tested for sterility; the virus harvest is tested for sterility, mycoplasma, mycobacteria, 
retrovirus and adventitious agents (in vitro tests); control cells (from virus culture) are tested for sterility, 
mycoplasma and adventitious agents (in vitro and in vivo tests). FP is tested for sterility and endotoxin.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
During  the  procedure,  a  number  of  deficiencies  were  highlighted  relating  to:  the  Manufacturing  and 
Importation Authorisation (MIA) and GMP certificate for the active substance (AS) and finished product 
(FP)  manufacturing  site,  process  validation  for  AS  and  FP  and  comparability  data;  impurity  testing; 
completion  of  viral  safety  testing  of  the  master  cell  bank  (MCB)  and  working  cell  bank  (WCB)  and 
additional qualification of a reagent used in the identity assay. These deficiencies were classified as Major 
Objections  (MOs)  in  order  to  ensure  completion  of  the  data  set  by  the  applicant  at  appropriate  time 
points, e.g. as specific obligations, see below. As a result, the marketing authorisation is conditional on 
the applicant providing responses to the requested data. 
The GMP / MIA for the AS/FP site was subsequently granted and this MO was therefore resolved.  
Data have been submitted by the company during the procedure in relation to the other MOs and CHMP 
has considered that these data would support grant of a conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) on 
quality grounds, taking into account the public health emergency of international concern declared by 
WHO. However, a number of specific obligations (SOs) are needed in order to complete the manufacturing 
process details. 
A  summary  of  the  status of  the  information,  including  the  specific  obligations  and  their  rationale  and 
additional recommendations for further development are discussed below.    
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019

Specific Obligations 
Stability data were provided for clinical AS and FP lots. The currently available stability data support an AS 
shelf life of 36 months and a FP shelf life of 36 months. However, these stability data were derived from 
IDT and West Point batches (clinical batches). In the framework of a conditional marketing authorisation, 
a shelf life of 36 months can be granted for the commercial product (AS and FP). However, it is expected 
that  comparability  is  comprehensively  demonstrated  post-approval  between  commercial  and  clinical 
batches  (see  list  of  specific  obligations)  in  order  to  confirm  the  shelf  life  of  the  commercial  product. 
Furthermore,  given  the  limited  experience  of  the  Burgwedel  site  with  the  manufacturing  process,  the 
applicant  is  also  requested  to  provide  the  AS  and  FP  stability  data  from  the  Burgwedel  AS  process 
performance qualification (PPQ) batches when the stability studies have been finished (post-approval) 
(see list of recommendations). Any out-of-specification (OOS) results or trends should be communicated 
to the authorities as soon as possible. In addition, to confirm the stability of the vaccine during a short 
time exposure to elevated temperatures, also the results of the post-thaw FP stability data from the 36 
month  time  point  should  be  provided  (post-approval)  when  these  are  available  (see  list  of 
recommendations). 
Process validation (or process performance qualification) for both AS and FP is still ongoing. Data from 1 
representative AS lot and 1 representative FP lot were provided. For these lots, the process operated 
within acceptable limits and the QC test results were within the acceptance criteria and compliant with the 
specifications and support grant of a conditional Marketing Authorisation. Unexpected issues arose during 
AS PPQ , delaying the availability of complete AS PPQ data. However, the root cause of the problem has 
been identified and proper measures have been taken to avoid similar problems in the future. This was 
discussed during the GMP inspection and the measures were deemed acceptable by the GMP inspectors.  
The Burgwedel commercial process is identical to the West Point clinical lot process (also produced at the 
same scale). As such, with the described control strategy in place, the process is expected to yield AS of 
the same quality as at the West Point site. West point material produced thus far has been shown to be 
of adequate and consistent quality. However, CHMP is of the view that two further active substance lots 
(AS  PPQ  4  and  5)  are  required  to  complete  the  information  by  providing  sufficient  comprehensive 
evidence  that  the  process,  operated  within  established  parameters,  can  perform  effectively  and 
reproducibly  to  produce  the  medicinal  product,  meeting  its  predetermined  specifications  and  quality 
attributes.  In  the  framework  of  a  conditional  marketing  authorisation  therefore,  additional  process 
validation data for AS and FP has been requested post-approval to confirm the validated status of the 
process as a specific obligation to the Marketing Authorisation.  
The proposed sites for batch control testing are located in the US and the applicant has submitted a plan 
to transfer FP release testing to a site in EU by July 2022 (latest date for the last test to be transferred). 
The identified required steps and timelines in the plan are considered appropriate. In view of the Public 
Health Emergency of International Concern declared by the WHO and in order to ensure early supply of 
this medicinal product in the context of this emergency, granting of an exemption for batch control testing 
in a third country is supported, in line with the submitted plan for transfer of testing. Annual reports on 
progress on transfer of testing are requested.  
The Burgwedel manufacturing site is currently unable to place a unique identifier on the FP. However, the 
applicant is seeking exemptions from competent authorities of Member States that would be willing to 
accept this product on their market without the unique identifier, in light of the public health emergency. 
In the absence of any such exemption, the unique identifier is still required, therefore the manufacturer 
should implement serialisation at the earliest opportunity to allow placing of the product on the market 
upon expiry of exemptions. 
Although FP lots that comply with the specifications (formulated using within-specification AS lots) are 
expected to behave similarly in terms of potency as the clinical batches, comparability between clinical

material and the commercial product manufactured at the Burgwedel site must be demonstrated. This is 
to justify that the commercial product is representative of the clinical product (and thus that the clinical 
data and conclusions are also applicable for the commercial product). In the framework of a conditional 
marketing authorisation, comparability between clinical material and the commercial product will need to 
be demonstrated post-approval as a specific obligation to the marketing authorisation. 
In the framework of the conditional marketing authorisation therefore, to complete the manufacturing 
process details, the applicant should fulfil, post-approval, the following specific obligations (SOs). 
SO1: The MAH should provide additional data to confirm that the active substance (AS) process is 
properly validated. Process and batch data from at least 3 representative AS batches should be 
provided. 
SO2: The MAH should provide additional data to confirm that the finished product (FP) process is 
properly validated. Process and batch data from at least 3 representative FP batches should be 
provided. 
SO3: The MAH should provide comprehensive comparability data confirming that the commercial 
product manufactured at the Burgwedel site is representative of the material used in the clinical trials. 
SO4: The MAH should complete master cell banks (MCB)/working cell bank (WCB) qualification to 
include also tests for specified viruses. 
SO5: The MAH should provide additional qualification data for the critical reagent used in the identity 
test (quality control release test for AS and FP). 
SO6: The MAH should develop and introduce an active substance in-process control for total protein 
with appropriate acceptance criteria.  
As regards SO1, SO2 and SO3, the following data is requested to be provided in order to complete the 
information on the adequate validation of the AS process and the FP process and to demonstrate 
comparability between the commercial product and the clinical material. 
a) The process validation data for the PPQ AS batches (Burgwedel site) are requested to be provided. 
These should not be limited to critical quality attributes (CQA) and critical process parameter (CPP) 
results but should also include results of all process operating conditions mentioned in the tables in 
section S.2.2. of the dossier. Given the issues observed during AS PPQ2 and AS PPQ3, two further 
representative active substance lots (AS PPQ 4 and 5) will be required to provide sufficient 
comprehensive evidence that the process, operated within established parameters, can perform 
effectively and reproducibly to produce the medicinal product, meeting its predetermined 
specifications and quality attributes. Batch data from at least 3 representative and compliant AS 
batches, in total, should be provided and included in section S.4.4 of the CTD. 
b) The applicant is requested to submit process validation data for the PPQ FP batches (Burgwedel 
site). These should not be limited to CQA and CPP results but should also include results of relevant 
process parameters (e.g. AS thaw time, mixing time of final formulated bulk- FFB,…). CQAs should 
also include the FP identity, since the plaque assay (potency) does not provide information about the 
expression of the GP. As such, a combination of the potency assay (PFU assay) and identity assay (GP 
immunostaining) is considered necessary to properly assess potency. Also results of hold times, 
time-out-of-refrigeration (TOR) and total processing time should be provided. It is expected that limits 
for these parameters will be challenged in the FP process validation studies. Batch data from at least 
3 representative and compliant FP batches, in total, should be provided and included in section P.5.4 
of the CTD.

c) The applicant is requested to submit comparability analysis data for the Burgwedel site 
demonstrating that AS/FP from Burgwedel is representative of the AS/FP used in the clinical trials. As 
regards the comparability analysis, the applicant should provide all relevant process/batch data 
(intermediates, AS and FP) from batches produced at IDT and at West Point. 
d) As part of the AS characterisation and process validation, the applicant is requested to provide 
results of genome quantitation and aggregate formation (analysed by dynamic light scattering- DLS) 
of the Burgwedel AS PPQ lots. Particle size testing by DLS should also be performed on 3 AS PPQ lots 
and 3 FP PPQ lots during stability testing. 
e) As part of the FP characterisation and process validation, the applicant is expected to perform an 
identity test (which is considered as part of the potency test) during stability testing on three Finished 
Product PPQ batches.  
f) As part of the FP process validation, to validate the option of using more than 1 AS lot for FP 
formulation, at least one of the FP PPQ lots should be formulated from at least 2 AS lots. In addition, 
one FP PPQ batch should challenge the maximum batch size. 
g) Because of the heat sensitivity of the active substance, additional process controls should be 
implemented to sufficiently control the manufacturing process and in particular possible exposure of 
the vaccine virus to elevated temperatures. Therefore, when additional process experience has been 
gained and additional process data are available, the following should be implemented: 
(1) The applicant is requested to set a proper and reasonable upper limit for the thawing time of 
master virus seed (MVS) and working virus seed (WVS), avoiding exposure of the virus to high 
temperature longer than needed.  
(2) To properly control the AS process and to limit the time out of refrigerator of the virus to a 
minimum, it is strongly recommended to implement an upper limit for the total time of AS 
exposed to room temperature during downstream purification (from harvest to freezing of AS). 
Furthermore, since virus degradation is known to occur more rapidly at higher temperatures, the 
company should introduce a separate process parameter for exposure time to 37°C during the 
benzonase reaction.  
h) The applicant states that the active substance opalescence can span from the specification limit to 
above the highest standard employed in the compendial method. It appears that this wide range is due 
to the limited manufacturing experience so far. The applicant is requested to adequately tighten the 
physical assessment limits with increasing numbers of batches produced and tested. The applicant is 
reminded that specifications are important measures of batch to batch consistency within a defined 
and acceptable range and that the current specification does not allow for any relevant control of 
vaccine appearance.  
i) A post-thaw stability study (at 25°C) should be performed (to support post-thaw finished product 
exposure to elevated temperature exposure times) on the FP as described in section P.8.1.2.2. Since 
it will take quite some time before the 36 month time point results from this post-thaw stability study 
will be available, it is deemed sufficient that for the specific obligation of the CMA only the data from 
the “0” month time point are needed from this post-thaw study. The 36 month results should also be 
provided (when available), but these data only will not postpone a possible conversion from a CMA to 
a normal MA. So, whereas the “0” month time point data will be required for the SO, the 36 m data will 
be requested in the final report as a recommendation. 
As regards SO4 (The MAH should complete master cell banks (MCB)/working cell bank (WCB) qualification 
to include also tests for specified viruses.), the applicant is asked to address the following. Whereas the 
metagenomics analysis is considered a useful tool to screen for other possible viral contaminants, 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019  
Page 29/117 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
known/relevant potential viruses should preferentially be screened using more reliable and robust 
methods that are easier to qualify.  
As regards SO5 (the critical reagent for the identity test (QC release test) should be properly qualified), 
because of the criticality of the polyclonal antibody (used for identity release test), additional qualification 
is required. As part of the initial qualification of the polyclonal antibody, to demonstrate the specificity of 
the polyclonal antibody, the company is expected to include a negative control with Vero cells infected 
with wild type vesicular stomatitis virus: these should also yield a negative result (no immunostaining 
observed). 
As regards SO6, it is noted that routine testing for host cell protein in AS has not been included yet in the 
CTD. The applicant has proposed to monitor HCP via total protein analysis at the level of the ultrafiltration 
product. Upon qualification, this method will be implemented post-approval as an IPC in the relevant 
sections of the CTD. The applicant is asked to provide data from tests of previously manufactured AS PPQ 
lots (AS PPQ lots 1, 2, 4, and 5). Given that benzonase clearance may be indicative for HCP clearance, the 
applicant’s approach to temporarily release AS lots without result for total protein at UF product is 
acceptable, provided the residual benzonase levels are within the acceptance limits. However, given the 
limited experience with the Burgwedel process, proper control of HCP (via total protein analysis) is 
deemed essential and should be implemented as soon as possible as an IPC with acceptance criteria in the 
relevant sections of module 3 of the CTD. It is also expected that the results of the impurity testing will be 
mentioned on the release certificates and on the information sent to the OMCL. 
Rationale for the specific obligations: 
SO1 and SO2: The Burgwedel commercial process is identical to the West Point clinical lot process (also 
produced at the same scale). As such, if properly controlled, the process is expected to yield AS of the 
same quality as at the West Point site. West point material produced thus far has been shown to be of 
adequate and consistent quality. Burgwedel manufacturing is therefore conditionally accepted on the 
basis that the technology has been transferred and a GMP certificate has been granted. However, the 
available process validation data for AS and FP do not allow a final conclusion on the validated status of 
the manufacturing process to be made. The MAH is requested to provide additional PPQ data to confirm 
that the AS and FP processes are properly validated. Process and batch data from 3 representative 
batches of both AS and FP are requested. 
SO3: Currently, comparability between clinical material and the commercial product manufactured at the 
Burgwedel site has not been comprehensively demonstrated. Although FP lots that comply with the 
specifications (formulated using within-specification AS lots) are expected to behave similarly in terms of 
potency as the clinical batches, demonstration of comparability is required to justify that the commercial 
product is representative of the clinical product (and thus that the clinical data and conclusions are also 
applicable for the commercial product). The AS shelf life and FP shelf life (36 months) are based on 
stability data derived from IDT and West Point batches (clinical batches). Comparability between clinical 
material and the commercial product must be comprehensively demonstrated. 
S04: Although the applicant has provided reassurance on the viral safety of the cell bank system using a 
combination of specific tests and metagenomics analysis, additional testing should be performed on the 
MCB (or WCB) using a robust, reliable and qualified method (e.g. classic PCR). It is currently very difficult 
(if not impossible) to qualify metagenomics approaches with regard to sensitivity, specificity and limit of 
detection. Therefore, given the potential viral contaminants of Vero cells, properly qualified methods are 
requested and should be implemented to confirm the absence of these viruses from the MCB or WCB 
(which is in line with current standards and GMP for qualification of cell bank systems). 
S05: Since the potency assay only quantifies the amount of infectious virus without making distinction 
between the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and any possible wild type VSV, the identity

assay is the only assay which confirms the correct identity of the recombinant vaccine virus. As such, 
proper qualification of the critical reagents used in this assay is of importance. Initial qualification of the 
polyclonal antibody used in the identity test included as negative controls only uninfected Vero cells, 
damaged Vero cells, and MRC-5 cells infected with varicella zoster virus. However, to demonstrate the 
specificity of the polyclonal antibody, the company is asked to include as part of the initial qualification of 
the polyclonal antibody also a negative control with Vero cells infected with wild type vesicular stomatitis 
virus: these should also yield a negative result (no immunostaining observed). Without this qualification, 
it cannot be concluded that the release testing panel for AS/FP is capable of discriminating between the 
recombinant vaccine virus and possible wild type VSV.  
As regards SO6, it is noted that routine testing for host cell protein in AS has not been included yet in the 
CTD. The applicant has proposed to monitor HCP via total protein analysis at the level of the ultrafiltration 
product. Upon qualification, this method will be implemented post-approval as an IPC in the relevant 
sections of the CTD. The applicant has committed to retroactively test previously manufactured AS PPQ 
lots (AS PPQ lots 1, 2, 4, and 5). Given that benzonase clearance may be indicative for HCP clearance, the 
applicant’s approach to temporarily release AS lots without result for total protein at UF product is 
acceptable, provided the residual benzonase levels are within the acceptance limits. However, given the 
limited experience with the Burgwedel process, proper control of HCP (via total protein analysis) is 
deemed essential and should be implemented as soon as possible as an IPC with acceptance criteria in the 
relevant sections of module 3 of the CTD. It is also expected that the results of the impurity testing will be 
mentioned on the release certificates and on the information sent to the OMCL. 
In conclusion, the quality part of the current dossier may be approved as a conditional MA with a list of 
specific obligations that need to be fulfilled to complete the manufacturing process details. In addition, 
the applicant is also requested to take into account the list of recommendations. 
Recommendations 
The applicant has provided detailed descriptions of the manufacturing process, the control of materials, 
the process controls (including critical process parameters (CPPs)) and the process development, for both 
the AS and the FP. The cell bank system and virus seed system were adequately qualified. To ensure 
sufficient vaccine supply in the future from the current virus seed system (which only contains a master 
virus seed), the applicant is recommended to establish a 2-tiered virus seed system by implementing also 
a working virus seed (WVS). Use of the WVS can be submitted post approval via a variation procedure 
(see section- Recommendation(s) for future quality development).  
AS and FP specifications were provided as well as detailed information on the analytical methods, which 
were properly validated or qualified. Container closure systems for AS and FP were described. To confirm 
the quality and suitability of the finished product containers, the applicant is requested to determine the 
identity of the two unknown leachables as observed in the leachables studies, and report results when 
available (see section- Recommendation(s) for future quality development).  
Routine testing of residual benzonase and host cell DNA impurities has been included as an in-process 
control (IPC) with acceptance criteria. As regards host cell protein (HCP), the applicant will monitor HCP 
via total protein analysis at the level of the ultrafiltration (UF) product. Upon qualification, this method will 
be  implemented  post-approval  as  an  IPC  in  the  relevant  sections  of  the  CTD  (see  list  of  specific 
obligations). The applicant will retroactively test previously manufactured AS PPQ lots (AS PPQ lots 1, 2, 
4, and 5). The applicant will also mention IPC results of impurity testing on the release certificates and on 
the  information  provided  to  the  Official  Medicines  Control  Laboratory  (OMCL).  Given  that  benzonase 
clearance may be indicative for HCP clearance, the applicant’s approach to temporarily release AS lots 
without result for total protein at UF product is acceptable, provided the residual benzonase levels are 
within the acceptance limits.

Host  cell  protein  has  been  evaluated  in  clinical  IDT  lots.  As  the  Burgwedel  site  has  currently  limited 
experience with the manufacturing process, UF total protein results of batches tested retroactively should 
be provided when available in order to demonstrate consistency and confirm adequate quality of these 
batches (see list of recommendations). In addition, the currently proposed acceptance limits for residual 
benzonase and host cell DNA IPC are acceptable for the time being, but when sufficient batch data are 
available,  the  applicant  should  re-evaluate  the  acceptance  limits  for  impurities  (DNA,  benzonase  and 
HCP). Based on the results, revision/tightening of these limits should be considered and proposed in a 
post-authorisation procedure (see section- Recommendation(s) for future quality development).  
Both the AS and the novel excipient recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) have been characterised 
in detail. Whereas additional testing that was used for characterisation is not required for routine testing, 
it is important that these methods remain available as characterisation tests to be used in the future in 
case  of  relevant  changes/variations  (for  comparability  analyses).  In  particular,  for  AS,  the  tests  for 
residual impurities (benzonase, HCP, Tryple activity, etc.) should be maintained, whereas for the rHSA 
excipient the tests for aggregates (SEC-HPLC), water content and host-cell protein (HCP) should be kept 
as characterisation tests (see section- Recommendation(s) for future quality development).  
Although  suitable  information  about  the  rHSA  excipient  has  been  provided,  which  is  considered  an 
important component of the final finished product, the applicant is requested to provide supplemental 
validation data for accuracy, linearity and range for both the Tris and rHSA assays  (for QC testing of 
excipient) (see section- Recommendation(s) for future quality development).  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
During the procedure, several MOs were raised relating to: the MIA and GMP certificate for the active 
substance  -AS  and  finished  product  -FP  manufacturing  site,  process  validation  for  AS  and  FP  and 
comparability data; impurity testing; completion of viral safety testing of the MCB and WCB and additional 
qualification of a reagent used in the identity assay. The GMP / MIA for the AS/FP site was subsequently 
granted  and  this  MO  was  therefore  resolved.  Data  have  been  submitted  by  the  company  during  the 
procedure in relation to the other MOs and CHMP has considered that these data would support granting 
of  a  conditional  Marketing  Authorisation  on  quality  grounds  taking  into  account  the  public  health 
emergency  of  international  concern  declared  by  WHO.  In  conclusion,  the  quality  part  of  the  current 
dossier may be approved as a conditional MA with a list of specific obligations that need to be fulfilled, as 
detailed in the assessment report (see discussion section). In addition, the applicant is also requested to 
take into account the list of recommendations for future development. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  As  soon  as  the  total  protein  assay  (to  monitor  host  cell  proteins-  HCP)  is  qualified,  active 
substance (AS) lots that have been released without quality control results for total protein at 
ultrafiltration (UF) product should be tested retroactively and results should be communicated to 
the Agency and the Rapporteurs. 
2.  When sufficient batch data are available, the applicant should re-evaluate the acceptance limits 
for impurities (DNA, benzonase and HCP). Based on the results, revision/tightening of these limits 
should be considered. 
3.  With  regard  to  the  finished  product  (FP)  leachables  studies,  the  applicant  is  requested  to 
determine the identity of the two unknown leachables and report results when available. 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019

4.  The  applicant  is  requested  to  provide  supplemental validation data  for  accuracy,  linearity  and 
range  for  both  the  Tris  and  recombinant  human  serum  albumin  (rHSA)  assays  (control  of 
excipient). 
5.  The  applicant  is  requested  to  provide  the  remaining  AS  stability  data  from  the  Burgwedel  AS 
process performance qualification (PPQ) batches when the stability studies have been finished 
(post-approval). Any out-of-specification OOS results or trends should be communicated to the 
authorities as soon as possible. 
6.  The applicant is requested to provide the remaining FP stability data from the Burgwedel FP PPQ 
batches when the stability studies have been finished (post-approval). Any OOS results or trends 
should be communicated to the authorities as soon as possible. 
7.  The applicant is requested to provide the post-thaw FP stability data from the 36 month time point 
when these are available.  
8.  The applicant is recommended to establish a 2-tiered virus seed system by implementing also a 
working  virus  seed-  WVS.  Use  of  the  WVS  can  be  submitted  post  approval  via  a  variation 
procedure. 
9.  The applicant should keep the tests for residual impurities (benzonase, HCP, host cell DNA and 
Tryple  activity)  as  characterisation  tests  for  relevant  future  variations  (for  comparability 
analyses: to demonstrate that impurity levels are still within acceptable limits). 
10. The tests for aggregates (SEC-HPLC), water content and host-cell protein (HCP) should be kept as 
characterisation  tests  for  rHSA  to  be  used  in  case  of  relevant  future  changes  in  the  rHSA 
manufacturing process. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical evaluation comprises a series of pharmacological studies and a toxicological testing 
program which covers local tolerance and general toxicity in repeat-dose toxicity studies, and a 
developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) study. Other studies were also conducted, such as in 
vivo biodistribution and persistence study and an exploratory neurovirulence study.  
Pivotal toxicology studies including repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice and cynomolgus macaques, the 
DART study in rats, and the biodistribution study in cynomolgus macaques are claimed to be 
GLP-compliant. Primary pharmacodynamics studies, an exploratory neurovirulence test and an 
exploratory immunogenicity and viremia study were non-GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The primary pharmacodynamic properties of V920 were evaluated in multiple non-GLP immunogenicity 
and prophylactic efficacy studies in rodents and in non-human primates (NHP) as summarized in the list 
below: 
• 
Published evaluations of prophylactic efficacy of V920 and the durability of protective immunity as 
well as the immune correlates 
•  Study of the immunogenicity of V920 in NHP for up to 1-year post vaccination [PD003]

•  Studies of the immunogenicity and efficacy of V920 in NHP conducted at the United States Army 
Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) [PD001, PD002, PD004] 
•  Study of the immunogenicity of a low dose of V920 [PD006] 
Two additional studies were conducted to support the environmental risk assessment: 
•  Assessment of the ability of V920 to replicate in arthropod cell cultures of relevant vector species 
and in relevant vector species [PD007] 
• 
Evaluation of the infectivity and potential for transmission of V920 in swine [PD008] 
Vaccine lots used were assigned a potency value in plaque forming units (pfu) using the same 
non-validated potency assay that was used for release of clinical supplies. Clinical lots were used for most 
studies.

Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacodynamics properties of V920 were evaluated in several non-GLP immunogenicity 
and efficacy studies in NHP for which study reports were submitted, and further supported by literature 
data that, besides NHP, also concern rodents.  
In studies conducted at USAMRIID and MSD, intramuscular administration of V920 vaccine was well 
tolerated and highly immunogenic in cynomolgus macaques across a wide dose range (3×101 to 1×108 
pfu). These studies support immunogenicity of the vaccine, with ZEBOV-GP-specific IgG detectable in 
most animals 14 days after a single immunization with all animals seroconverting within 28 days. 
Protective efficacy against EVD was demonstrated, with 95 to 100% protection against mortality following 
a lethal intramuscular ZEBOV challenge 42 days after immunization. 
Previously published studies demonstrated that a single immunization with V920 is highly immunogenic 
and effective in protection against disease and death by the lethal IM ZEBOV challenge in the NHP animal 
model. Notably, complete protection in NHP was observed as early as 7 days after a single vaccination, 
and partial protection at 3 days post vaccination, demonstrating a rapidly acquired protective immunity, 
which is of interest in the context of the use of V920 in outbreak settings.  
Current NHP challenge models are more stringent than EVD in humans: a challenge dose of 1,000 pfu 
results in 100% lethality in unvaccinated cynomolgus macaques, and is generally thought to represent 
100 to 1,000-fold Lethal Dose. In these conditions, and with survival as the most important endpoint, it 
can be concluded that V920 has shown to be protective in this model. 
However, the high vaccine efficacy has hampered the identification of a potential correlate of protection. 
The aim of the studies to identify immune parameters that correlate with protection was not reached. On 
the other hand, many of the data of the planned assessment of the immune response were not available 
at the start of the procedure. These include the assessment of binding and neutralizing antibody titres in 
the qualified ELISA and PRNT60 assays but also experimental parameters such as T and B cell EliSpots, 
ICS, ADCC assay, Fc effector function assay etc. In addition, immune responses were sometimes only 
assessed for a selection of animals. In this regard, the currently ongoing efforts to obtain these data are 
strongly supported and are expected to provide some new insight into the immune correlate of protection. 
During review of the MAA, 3 study reports were submitted on the assessment of binding and neutralizing 
antibody titres in the qualified ELISA and PRNT assays. The Applicant clarified that the experimental 
parameters as identified above are no longer seen as a priority. Focus is currently on the assessment of 
Fc effector functions. In addition, outcomes other than survival will also be evaluated (viremia, clinical 
signs). Submission of these upcoming data for review is considered important in the post-authorisation 
phase.   
The important role of humoral immune response in protection has been substantiated by depletion 
studies in NHP as described in the literature. It has been demonstrated that absence of antibodies (due to 
depletion of CD4 T cells at the time of vaccination) leads to death after challenge, whereas animals 
survive when CD4 T cells are depleted at the time of challenge, as do animals depleted of CD8 cells at the 
time of vaccination. Altogether these data show the importance of a humoral immune response upon 
vaccination. CD4 T cells also play an important role in protection, as indicated by depletion assays as well 
as outcome of SHIV infected animals, but rather to provide help to B cells than via CD4 T cell effector 
functions. Still, confirmatory data with respect to the exact role of T-cell immunity vs. antibodies are 
missing.   
Assessment of endpoints other than mortality could provide additional information from the performed 
studies. So far, these studies indicate that no sterile immunity is obtained by vaccination. Indeed, a 
number of vaccinated animals that survived had detectable viremia after challenge, and some also had 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019

clinical signs indicative of infection (although no histologic lesions of Ebola viral infection were observed). 
Viremia after challenge was higher in the durability study (PD004), as compared to previous challenge 
studies performed by USAMRIID, and animal source (Mauritian versus Cambodian) or external factors like 
stress related to long transportation may have influenced this parameter. Viremia could be an interesting 
parameter as alternative to survival for assessment of correlates of protection. The Applicant will further 
evaluate long term protection in an ongoing and planned durability study to be submitted 
post-authorisation. 
To date, the exact duration of protection after a single dose of V920 is not fully understood. In the 
durability study in NHP (PD004), robust antibody titres but only partial protection against IM challenge 
were observed at three months (33% survival) and 1 year (43% survival) after a single vaccination. 
Some caveats in this study make it difficult to determine the meaning of these data, including the 
different origin of the cynomolgus macaques compared to previous NHP studies (Mauritian versus 
Cambodian origin) and that the animals underwent long-distance transportation one week prior to 
challenge. Also for this study immunogenicity assessment with validated assays and additional immune 
parameters is ongoing. Overall, data on duration of protection are considered limited at this time, as 
corresponding human data are not available either.  
In any case, the fact that protection long term is reduced despite the presence of circulating antibodies 
raises concerns on what could be the best biomarker for determining long term protection. The adequacy 
of the current stringent NHP model for long term protection may deserve discussion as well. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology study has been conducted, in the light of results of the nonclinical 
general toxicity studies and clinical safety, as per the applicable regulatory guidelines. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No pharmacokinetics studies have been conducted for V920. This is consistent with WHO Guidelines on 
nonclinical evaluation of vaccines (2005) which indicates that pharmacokinetic studies (e.g. for 
determining serum or tissue concentrations of vaccine components) are not needed for vaccines. Results 
of distribution, persistence and shedding studies are discussed in the toxicology section.   
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Several exploratory efficacy and/or immunogenicity studies conducted with V920 in BALB/c mouse, 
Sprague Dawley rat and cynomolgus macaque demonstrated robust immunogenicity following single or 
multiple intramuscular injections supporting the use of these species for the pivotal toxicity studies. All 
toxicity studies were GLP compliant except for the exploratory immunogenicity and viremia study in rats 
and the neurovirulence study. Clinical drug product was used in all these studies except for the 
neurovirulence study, which was performed with research grade material. 
The V920 vaccine virus showed approximately 33% slower growth kinetics than wild-type VSV in Vero cell 
cultures, contributing to attenuation. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose toxicity studies were conducted in two species, mice and monkeys. Animals received 2 doses 
of the vaccine, one more than the clinical dose regimen (single dose). Doses up to 2×107 pfu in mice or 
1×108 pfu in cynomolgus macaques were found to be safe and well-tolerated. Findings are in line with 
what can be expected from an immunogenic vaccine, with immune stimulation (lymphoid expansion in

local lymph nodes and spleen) and mild local irritation and inflammation. The NOAELs are agreed to be 
the highest dose tested, corresponding to a dose in the same order of magnitude as a clinical dose. Study 
design including species selection, number of doses, dose, assessment of recovery was in line with 
relevant guidelines and is considered acceptable.  
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
The absence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies is considered acceptable based on current 
guidelines and given the type of product and its posology. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
The developmental and reproductive toxicology study in Sprague Dawley rats was designed taking into 
account the recommendations of the WHO guidelines on nonclinical evaluations of vaccines, regarding 
pre-mating treatment to ensure exposure and induction of immune response leading to antibody transfer 
(5.28 x 107 pfu, given 28 and 7 days prior to cohabitation, on gestation day 6 and on lactation day 7), and 
a second group to evaluate viremia (single dose of 5.28 x 107 pfu  on GD6), a dose comparable to a full 
human dose, same route of administration as intended for human use, evaluated endpoints and division 
in subgroups (caesarean / postnatal follow-up). Although the classical way for calculation of safety 
margins may not be that relevant for a live vaccine, large body weight based safety margins, together 
with observed immune response and viremia in the immunogenicity and viremia group respectively, 
support the Applicant’s conclusion that vaccination before and during gestation is well tolerated under the 
conditions of this study, with no effect on mating or pre- and post-natal development and no teratogenic 
potential. When V920 was administered to female rats, antibodies against ZEBOV GP were detected in 
foetuses and offspring, likely due to trans-placental transfer during gestation and with the acquisition of 
maternal antibodies during lactation, respectively. 
Toxicokinetic data 
V920 is a live attenuated vaccine and as such, its distribution, persistence and shedding were evaluated 
in cynomolgus monkeys after IM administration. The biodistribution study showed persistence of V920 
viral RNA (by qRT-PCR) in lymphoid tissues but no evidence for persistence of infectious virus (by plaque 
assay). Viral RNA after Day 7 was generally confined to tissues lacking potential for shedding in excretions 
or secretions and showed no evidence of distribution to the brain or spinal cord at any time point. It should 
be noted that in clinical trials, positive saliva samples were detected and in repeat dose toxicity studies, 
urine samples were positive for some animals (mice and NHP). Dissemination to the environment or 
transmission from vaccinees to close contacts can therefore not be excluded. As samples were only 
assessed for presence of infectious virus vaccine at limited timepoints, it is not known how long the 
infectious virus was present for. At day one, several samples were positive and at day 56, all were 
negative but no intermediate timepoints were assessed. The Applicant hypothesized that the vaccine RNA 
detected in lymphoid tissues beyond d56 results from viral genomic RNA within macrophages trafficked to 
the lymphoid tissues, which is supported by literature (Simon et al., 2007, 2010). The lack of detectable 
long-term VSV vaccine vector replication in vivo minimizes concerns about accumulation of mutations in 
live-attenuated vectors that could potentially lead to increased vector virulence. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed in the repeat dose toxicity studies in line with the current guidelines.

Other toxicity studies 
An exploratory neurovirulence study was conducted with V920 in cynomolgus macaques demonstrating 
no evidence of neurovirulence following intrathalamic administration (Mire et al, 2012). These results, 
together with the results of the biodistribution study described above showing absence of vaccine genetic 
material in CNS tissues, show that there is no tropism for the CNS, and even if the vaccine virus is 
introduced intrathalamically in the CNS of NHP, no neurological symptoms are observed. Hence, these 
data support the use of the vaccine in the proposed indication and population.  
rd-rHSA is a novel excipient, and should, as such, be subject to a specific safety assessment, and 
toxicology and PK should be investigated. The applicant provided a justification as to why additional 
nonclinical studies are not needed. Rice-derived recombinant and plasma-derived HSA are identical, and 
considering pd-HSA is a qualified excipient, the only potential safety concern consists in the fact that rice 
host cell proteins might theoretically induce a risk of allergic reactions. However additional nonclinical 
studies would not be able to fully exclude this theoretical risk. Therefore, it is agreed that no additional 
nonclinical studies are warranted to validate the excipient in the proposed formulation and use. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
V920 is a live attenuated vaccine carrying a single-stranded negative sense RNA genome. The vaccine 
consists of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) in which the gene encoding the VSV 
glycoprotein G has been replaced with the Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein (GP).   
Data collected from clinical trials with V920 show that viremia (measured by the detection of 
rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP RNA in the blood) was common among vaccine recipients, with a maximum viremia 
value observed of 2.9x104 copies/mL. Viremia resolved in most subjects by 1 week (see also section 2.6 
page 106). Shedding of the V920 virus (measured by the detection of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP RNA in saliva, 
urine, and fluid from skin vesicles) was rare in adults. Adolescents and children presented a higher 
magnitude of vaccine viremia and a greater degree of vaccine viral shedding in the saliva and urine 
compared to adults (maximum shedding observed was 7x104 copies/mL in adolescent saliva).  
Person-to-person transmission of the V920 virus has not been documented. Because shedding data 
indicate the presence of V920 in bodily fluids and in vesicular lesions and because the cell tropism of 
rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP show features consistent with both VSV and ZEBOV, the dissemination of V920 in 
human population by vaccinees cannot be ruled out. V920 seems generally well tolerated though 
systemic and local adverse effects have been reported, with amongst others the possibility for vesicular 
rash or cutaneous vasculitis following vaccination by means of which exposure to V920 is possible. Very 
limited information is available on the safety of V920 in vulnerable populations such as immune 
compromised, pregnant or lactating women or children below 1 year of age.  
Because this vaccine is based on VSV, a known pathogen in livestock (e.g. horses, cattle, pigs), the risk 
assessment included species that are relevant for the wild type VSV backbone of this vaccine. Virulence 
or replication of V920 has been investigated in rodents, pigs, swine, arthropods and non-human primates. 
In pigs, viremia and clinical signs consistent with wt-VSV were observed, albeit with delayed appearance 
compared to the wild-type VSV infection. No transmission to control animals was detected. The possibility 
of recombination events between the vaccine vector and wt-VSV was evaluated and is considered very 
low.  
Upon request, the applicant provided additional information for vaccine recipients and medical centre to 
ensure optimal and effective implementation of the proposed risk management measures. As a 
precaution, vaccinees should attempt to avoid exposure of livestock to blood and bodily fluids for at least 
6 weeks following vaccination to avoid the theoretical risk of spread of the V920 vaccine virus. People who 
develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. Cover the

vaccination site with an adequate bandage (e.g. any adhesive bandage or gauze and tape) that provides 
a physical barrier to protect against direct contact with vesicle fluid. The bandage may be removed when 
there is no visible fluid leakage. To avoid unintended exposure to livestock, ensure medical waste and 
other cleaning materials do not come in contact with livestock.  
Based on limited shedding in adults, the results of a toxicity study in non-human primates, and lack of 
horizontal transmission in pigs, the overall risk of Ervebo to human health and the environment is 
considered negligible.  
In any case, any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed in compliance with the institutional 
guidelines for genetically modified organisms or biohazardous waste, as appropriate.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects  
The results from pharmacology studies conducted with V920 by USAMRIID and MSD, and supported by 
literature data, demonstrate immunogenicity of the vaccine and protective efficacy against EVD following 
intramuscular ZEBOV challenge 42 days after immunization. Still less well understood is how long the 
protection conferred by a single IM dose of V920 can last and what the specific mechanism for protection 
would be. No major objections were identified, and no additional studies are required. Overall, antibody 
responses upon vaccination are robust but it is not possible that a threshold of antibody titre predicting 
survival or time of death can be identified at the present time. This conclusion is supported by the final 
analysis of the immunogenicity data from study PD001, PD002, PD003 and PD004, as the missing 
long-term immunogenicity data on animals that were vaccinated but not selected for challenge were 
submitted during the procedure (PD003-PD004). Immune correlates of protection will be further 
explored, including assessment of antibody titre correlates to outcomes other than survival, such as EBOV 
titre and clinical score post challenge, and time to death in the durability study where survival was much 
less than 100%. These results will be provided post-authorisation. 
Besides efforts to explore correlation of available immune response parameters, ELISA and PRNT titres, to 
outcomes other than survival, data will also be generated on other antibody features than titre and 
neutralisation, including Fc effector function, isotype and antibody specificity. These data will be explored 
in the durability study, PD004, which is appropriate as some vaccinated animals succumbed in this study 
and other parameters (viremia after challenge, clinical score, time to death) can be assessed as well. 
Depending on the outcome of this analysis, it will be considered if conducting similar analysis for the other 
studies is relevant. The assessment of those parameters that are identified in the protocols as 
experimental parameters, including T and B cell Elispots, ICS, and ADCC assay have not been done, and 
are not planned in the near future. This can be considered acceptable in view of ongoing efforts to explore 
other immune correlates as indicated above. 
Durability data are considered limited, as human durability data are not available either. Further 
assessment of the immune response in the durability study is ongoing, and to better interpret the data 
regarding duration of protection, submission for review of these data post-authorisation is considered 
important. In addition, following this 1-year durability study and the difficulties encountered for 
interpretation of the data, the Applicant is in the process of generating more durability data in an ongoing 
(4 month) and planned (1 year) durability study. Current data show however reduced protection.  
Pharmacokinetic studies are normally not required for a vaccine. The applicant provides a distribution, 
persistence and shedding study in monkeys but no other toxicokinetics studies were performed with V920 
vaccine, which is acceptable. 
All pivotal toxicology studies have been conducted according to GLP requirements and the relevant EMA 
and WHO guidelines. Safety has been assessed in repeat dose toxicity studies in mice and non-human 
primates, in a reproductive and developmental toxicity study in rats, and an exploratory neurovirulence 
Assessment report

study in non-human primates.  Overall the pivotal toxicity studies have adequate design and conduct, and 
results do not raise any safety signal of concern.  
In addition, the neurovirulence study with V920 was non-GLP, which was undesirable. However, at this 
stage, this is a non-issue because the clinical safety database gathered to date does not show signals of 
major safety concern, and a GLP-compliant biodistribution study in NHP did not show evidence of V920 
distribution to the brain. Accordingly, re-testing of neurovirulence for V920 under the GLP conditions is 
deemed unnecessary.   
The GMO ERA concludes that the overall risk linked to the intended use of V920 for both humans and the 
environment is considered negligible.  
Overall, the nonclinical safety data demonstrate that V920 has an acceptable safety profile. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Collectively, the results from pharmacology studies conducted with V920 by USAMRIID and MSD, and 
supported by literature data, demonstrate protection after challenge and induction of a robust immune 
response. Also considering the clinical data indicative of vaccine efficacy, the provided nonclinical 
pharmacology data are considered sufficient to support the use of V920 in individuals at high risk of 
exposure in the short term, e.g. in an outbreak setting.  
Data originated from distribution, persistence and shedding studies in monkeys showed no major 
concerns.  
The toxicity profile of V920 has been thoroughly evaluated and the nonclinical data support the acceptable 
safety profile of V920 as a vaccine that could be used for active immunization of at-risk individuals to 
protect against Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) caused by Zaire Ebola virus. 
From a non-clinical point of view, this marketing authorisation application is approvable.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No clinical pharmacology studies describing the pharmacokinetic properties of V920 were conducted in 
support of this application. This is acceptable because pharmacokinetic studies are generally not required 
for vaccines because the kinetic properties of antigens do not provide useful information for determining 
dose recommendations according to the “Note for guidance on the clinical evaluation of vaccines” 
CHMP/VWP/164653/2005.  
The main characteristics of the in vivo behaviour of the live V920 vaccine virus have been evaluated 
through assessment of vaccine viremia and shedding. Vaccine viremia (defined as the presence of vaccine 
viruses in the blood stream) and shedding were investigated as a safety parameter, but also as a measure 
of the bioavailability and replicative ability of the vaccine virus. Virus shedding was determined by the 
presence of the vaccine viruses in secretion or excretion products, and it was assessed in urine and saliva 
(phase I trials) but also in liquid of vesicles and in synovial fluids (phase II and III studies).  
Viremia and shedding were measured using a RT-PCR assay in the 8 Phase I studies at different time 
points (from Day 1 to Day 84 depending on the study) and occasionally in the Phase 2/3 studies.  
Vaccine viremia  
Vaccine viremia was evaluated in 771 adult subjects vaccinated with V920 dose levels ranging from 3x103 
to 1x108 pfu. 186 adult subjects were vaccinated with the selected dose of 2x107 pfu (n=110) or higher 
(n=76). 
V920 vaccine virus was detectable in the plasma of most adult subjects vaccinated with vaccine doses ≥ 
1x105 pfu and mainly from Day 1 to Day 7. At the following time point, by Day 14, viremia was no longer 
detected except for one subject (although it was not tested for all subjects).  
School-age children and adolescents vaccinated with the dose level of 2x107 pfu were viremic from Day 1 
to Day 7 and copy numbers/ml were in the same range as those of adults. Vaccine viremia has not been 
investigated more than 7 days post-vaccination in this paediatric population. 
Viral shedding 
Shedding was detected by PCR in urine or saliva in 23 adult subjects out of 299 vaccinated subjects who 
had samples collected and tested. Shedding in urine was observed from Day 1 through Day 7. Shedding 
in saliva was observed from Day 1 through Day 14 after any dose level. 
Vaccine virus was also detected in skin vesicles of 4 adult subjects out of 10 subjects tested in the 
V920-005 trial. Virus RNA was detected in a skin vesicle at 12 days postvaccination in one of the four 
subjects.  
Virus shedding was detected in a higher proportion of school-age children and adolescents (28/39) 
(V920-007 study) compared to adults. At Day 7, V920 RNA was detectable in saliva in 35% of school-age 
children and in 88% of adolescents, and in a urine sample from 1 school-age child.

Discussion and conclusion on viremia and viral shedding 
Vaccine virus RNA was found in blood, saliva and urine of vaccinated adults, although at low incidence and 
low copy number using RT-PCR. V920 RNA was detected in liquids of vesicles. Since WT EBOV RNA has 
been detected in other biological fluids than urine and saliva such as the semen, vaginal fluids, aqueous 
humour, breast milk, faeces, sweat, amniotic fluid and placenta, V920 virus might also be present in such 
fluids although it is unknown for which duration.  
No infectious assays were performed to distinguish between circulating or shed virus and infectious 
particles. Therefore, it remains difficult to clearly define the risk associated to viremia and shedding. 
The kinetics of viral clearance also remains uncertain. It is however unlikely that live viruses persist in the 
blood or bodily fluids of a vaccinated adult more than 28 days post-vaccination. 
Based on the results discussed there is a theoretical risk of transmission of V920 from human-to-human 
and a potential related safety issue, particularly for high-risk individuals.  
The risk of transmission to high-risk individuals is addressed in the section 4.4 of the SmPC. Vaccine 
recipients should avoid close association with and exposure of high-risk individuals to blood and bodily 
fluids for at least 6 weeks following vaccination. Blood donation should be avoided for at least 6 weeks 
post-vaccination. Individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the 
vesicles until they heal to minimize the risk of possible transmission of the vaccine virus through open 
vesicles. The theoretical possible transmission of V920 to livestock is also mentioned in section 4.4 for this 
reason. 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Ervebo during pregnancy. The benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of vaccination for the mother should be balanced. 
A warning that the ‘use of other Ebola control measures’ should not be interrupted after vaccination was 
included in the section 4.4 of the SmPC as well as ‘Standard precautions when caring for patients with 
known or suspected Ebola disease’. Warnings and precautions on how to protect themselves and how to 
avoid spread of germs were also implemented in the PL.   
Vaccine viremia and shedding were more pronounced in school-age children and adolescents. The 
duration of viremia and shedding in children and adolescent is not known. No data on viremia and 
shedding were presented for HIV-seropositive subjects, pregnant woman or elderly subjects (>65 YOA). 
Viral shedding will be further characterized in ongoing V920-015 ACHIV and V920-016 PREVAC studies, 
respectively investigating HIV-infected adults and adolescent and healthy adults and children.  
Finally, since the release specifications are based on the vaccine lots used in the clinical trials, the 
commercial lots are expected to have similar viremia and shedding. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics (Immunogenicity data) 
Mechanism of action 
V920 consists of a live, attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based vector expressing the 
envelope glycoprotein gene of Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP). Protective immunity against Ebola 
virus is not well understood and continues to be explored in animal models and clinical trials. Ebola virus 
GP is the major antigen in the vaccine and has been shown to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies as well 
as non-neutralizing antibodies.  
There is currently no established immunological correlate of protection against ZEBOV. The relative 
contributions of innate, humoral and cell-mediated immunity to protection from Zaire Ebola virus are 
unknown.

Clinical Immunogenicity 
The pharmacodynamic profile for the V920 Ebola vaccine is the interaction with the immune system 
aiming at the induction of an immune response. Thus, the immunogenicity of V920 Ebola vaccine is 
described in this section. 
The clinical development program of V920 consists of 12 clinical trials with immunogenicity data available 
for 11 of them. No immunogenicity data are available for the efficacy part of the pivotal V920-010 trial.  A 
total of 15,997 adult subjects were vaccinated with V920 in these clinical trials; 15,399 of these subjects 
received 2 × 107 plaque forming units (pfu)/dose or higher of V920. The trials also included 
approximately 536 adults ≥65 years of age, 234 children 6 to 17 years of age, 278 women who were 
incidentally found to be pregnant during the clinical trials, and 22 HIV-positive individuals (in the 
V920-009 trial only). 
Assays used to evaluate immunogenicity 
Immune responses to V920 were evaluated by 2 types of assays in the program, GP-ELISA and virus 
neutralization assays (Pseudovirion neutralization assay [PsVNA] and Plaque Reduction Neutralization 
Test [PRNT]).  
The GP-ELISA measures total IgG binding antibodies against the Ebola GP. It is an indirect ELISA which 
utilizes a purified recombinant GP as the coating antigen and an enzyme-conjugated anti-human IgG 
secondary antibody as the reporter or signal system. Testing was conducted at different laboratories 
during development. The PsVNA and PRNT detect the virus neutralizing antibody levels from human sera 
following the administration of the V920 vaccine. 
In the 8 Phase 1 trials, non-validated GP-ELISA, PsVNA, and PRNT assays were utilized to assess 
immunogenicity. Testing was done in different laboratories. Validated GP-ELISA (FANG human ZEBOV-GP 
ELISA) and PRNT results were presented for the Phase 2 and 3 studies V920-009, V920-011, and 
V920-012. Virus neutralization was measured by PsVNA in 7 of the Phase 1 trials; the exception was 
V920-004, in which, virus neutralization was measured by PRNT. The validation reports for the GP-ELISA 
assay and PRNT were approved by the FDA in February 2017. Validation protocol and reports, including 
the performance of the ELISA, particularly in term of reproducibility, sensitivity and specificity, were 
evaluated and deemed acceptable. To enhance the analysis, a serostatus cut-off (SSCO) is applied which 
is endorsed (see also below).  
ELISA titres were expressed in Units/ml, endpoint titres or EC90 in the initial Phase 1 studies; 
subsequently the ZEBOV-GP ELISA titres expressed in ELISA Units (EU)/ml were further defined as the 
primary immunologic endpoint for the V920 program. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 58.84.  
The immunogenicity analyses included the assessment of the geometric mean titre (GMT), geometric 
mean fold rise (GMFR), and seroresponse in the GP-ELISA and the PRNT assays. Seroresponse definitions 
were different for the Phase 1 studies compared to the Phase 2 and 3 studies because the cut-off of 
seropositivity and the seroresponse criteria were determined after having obtained the immunogenicity 
results of the Phase 1 and the PREVAIL studies. The rationale for the choice of the selected serostatus 
cut-off of 200 EU/ml was to decrease the proportion of pre-vaccination positive subjects compared to the 
use of the assay LLOQ in a non-endemic population. The choice of the cut-off is endorsed. An assessment 
of immunogenicity based on the baseline Ab status is being conducted and the applicant will provide the 
data and the results of the immunogenicity evaluation post-authorisation. 
Similarly, seroconversion/seroresponse criteria were arbitrarily defined. Seroconversion was defined as a 
post-vaccination ELISA titre ≥200 EU/mL that was also at least a 4-fold increase in ZEBOV IgG compared 
with baseline (Phase 1, primary endpoint and Phase 2/3, secondary endpoint) and seroresponse was

defined as a post-vaccination ELISA titre ≥ 200 EU/mL that was also at least a 2-fold increase in ZEBOV 
IgG compared with baseline (Phase 2/3, primary endpoint). Results were described in term of 
seroconversion rate (SCR), proportion of subjects meeting seroresponse criteria at specific timepoints, 
and geometric mean concentration (GMT). 
The PsVNA and PRNT are both neutralization assays to determine the virus neutralizing antibody levels 
from human sera after vaccination. However, PsVNA differs from the PRNT in that the in vitro 
pseudovirion can infect cells but cannot replicate. The PsVNA was replaced by the PRNT assay in the Phase 
2 and 3 studies because of lack of validation due to technical limitations including variability of reagents. 
As mentioned above, the PRNT assay was further qualified and validated before its use in the Phase 2 and 
3 studies. The PRNT validation results confirm the performance characteristics of the PRNT assay and 
demonstrate that the assay is suitable for its intended use.  
PRNT based on 60% reduction in viral plaque was selected to measure Ab neutralization capacities. Data 
indicating whether Ab detected as neutralizing V920 are able to neutralize WT EBOV became available 
during the procedure (a panel of 7 samples from NIBSC has been tested at Focus Diagnostics and the Ab 
titres generated in the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP-based PRNT were compared with a wild-type neutralization 
assay). Results support the fact that Ab detected as neutralizing V920 are able to neutralize WT EBOV in 
vitro.  
The clinical relevance of the PRNT assay is not known; considerations should be given as to whether virus 
neutralizing activity detected in an in vitro assay is predictive of EBOV neutralizing activity in vivo. To help 
further clarifying the clinical relevance of the immune response, the Applicant will provide analyses of 
immune correlates of protection post-authorisation. 
Characterization of adaptive cellular response to vaccine antigen or peptides (B- and T-cell responses) 
was planned to be explored in various Phase 1 trials (V920 -001, -002, -003, -005, -006, -007) using 
various techniques such as EliSpot, flow cytometry or mass spectrometry. Vaccine-induced innate 
responses were also planned to be investigated. The results of the exploratory assays are not essential for 
defining the benefit/risk of V920 and thus it is acceptable that they will be provided by the Applicant as 
soon as available in the post-authorisation phase. 
Some limited preliminary data on cross reacting binding or neutralizing antibody responses against 
related haemorrhagic fever viruses (e.g. Sudan ebolavirus) were presented by the Applicant; however, no 
conclusion could be drawn.  
Gamma irradiation 
The blood samples collected in the V920-009 and V920-011 trials (conducted in West Africa in the context 
of an ongoing Ebola outbreak) were gamma irradiated at the target dose of 50 kilograys (kGy) to 
inactivate Ebola virus, if present. After irradiation, these samples were tested in the validated GP-ELISA 
and PRNT. The blood samples collected in the V920-012 trial were not gamma-irradiated prior to testing 
in the validated assays because there was no risk that the specimens contained Ebola virus as the trial 
was conducted outside of the outbreak setting.  
A gamma irradiation study was performed utilizing 60 samples from the American phase I trial (Protocol 
V920-004) and various control samples, which spanned the dynamic range of both the validated ELISA 
and qualified PRNT. In this study, gamma irradiation has been demonstrated to result in an approximate 
20% elevation in measured antibody response for negative clinical samples. Conversely, gamma 
irradiation resulted in an approximate 20% reduction in post vaccination antibody response (1.21-fold 
decrease with 95% [CI = 1.15, 1.27-fold]) in the GP-ELISA. Reference standard (RS) and quality controls 
(QC) were not gamma irradiated. The effect of gamma irradiation was not consistently observed for the 
PRNT.

As consequence of the elevation in Day 0 and reduction in Day 56 concentration, the fold-change in 
response to vaccination (Day 56/Day 0) for the gamma irradiated samples as compared to the 
non-gamma irradiated samples correspond to a 42% reduction on average in the ELISA, meaning that the 
percentage of subjects achieving a 4-fold rise in response to vaccination could be reduced. 
Gamma-irradiation was only one of the factors that influenced the choice of seroresponse criteria. As 
mentioned previously, the choice of the seroresponse criteria was mainly based on the Liberian PREVAIL 
study as representative of the target population. 
A potential explanation for the effects of gamma irradiation is that irradiation partially denatures 
antibodies, causing nonspecific binding pre-vaccination in the GP-ELISA as well as decreased specific 
binding in the GP ELISA post-vaccination. Gamma irradiation was applied to the specimens from 
V920-009 and V920-011 clinical trials where lower GMTs for all time points have been observed. 
Dose-response studies 
Eight Phase I trials (V920-001 to V920-008) were conducted in the US and Canada, Europe (Switzerland 
and Germany), and regions of Africa not affected by the outbreak (Gabon and Kenya, V920-007 and 
V920-008) to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the V920 vaccine and to establish the final dose.  
The Phase I dose finding program included 795 adult subjects who received V920 as a single dose ranging 
from 3×103 pfu/dose to 1×108 pfu/dose. The Phase I trials included 197 adult subjects who received a 
single dose of 2×107 pfu or higher of V920. The dose level of 2x107 pfu was evaluated in 40 children and 
adolescents (V920-007). Overall, 135 subjects received placebo in the Phase I blinded trials. All the trials 
administered a single IM dose of V920, except the V920-002 trial in which 2 doses were administered 
(prime-boost regimen). Immunogenicity was assessed at different time points (from Day 0 up to Day 
365). Not all time points were evaluated in all phase I trials. Non-validated ELISA, PsVNA or PRNT were 
used to assess the immunogenicity of V920.  
GMTs, GMFRs and seroconversion rates (SCRs) were evaluated. In all phase I trials, for ELISA antibody 
titres the seroconversion was defined as a post-vaccination ELISA titre ≥200 EU/mL that was also at least 
a 4-fold increase in ZEBOV IgG compared to baseline.  
The results of the phase I trials allowed to assess the anti-GP antibody kinetics after vaccination. GMTs, 
GMFR, and SCRs were higher at all time points in the vaccine groups compared with the placebo groups, 
were no response was observed. No immune response was observed for any dose group on day 7 
(EBOV-naïve subjects, studies V920-001 to V920-004). Antibody titres increased from day 7 and were 
measurable to a different extent in all dosing groups on day 14.  
A dose response was observed with higher GMTs, GMFRs, and SCRs in the higher dose groups at the 
earlier time points (i.e. on day 14 and to a less extent on day 28) vs. later time points because antibody 
titres in the high dose groups (2x107 pfu and 1x108 pfu) tended to peak on day 28 and plateaued 
afterwards with a slight to moderate decrease from day 180 to day 360; instead in the lower dosing 
groups titres tended to continuously increase from day 28 to 180/360.  
Though no correlate of protection is currently known for the V920 vaccine, and immunogenicity cannot 
directly be related to efficacy, the notably higher immune response at early time points favours the higher 
doses for a vaccine intended for emergency use in an outbreak situation. Between the doses 2x107 and 
1x108 no notably difference in immune response could be observed (and confirmed in study V920-012). 
As long as a correlate of protection or a threshold is unknown, GMTs are considered a more robust value 
than seroconversion rates with an arbitrary threshold of 200 EU/ml. The phase I immunogenicity data do 
overall indicate an immune response sustainable through day 360.

Main studies 
The immunogenicity of V920 was evaluated using validated assays in the V920-009, V920-011, and 
V920-012 trials. The immunogenicity endpoints included binding antibodies measured by GP-ELISA and 
neutralizing antibodies measured by PRNT at baseline, Day 28/Month 1, Day 180/Month 6, and Months 9 
to 12/Month 12 post-vaccination. Immunogenicity was also assessed at Month 24 post-vaccination in the 
V920-012 trial. 
For the V920-009, V920-011, and V920-012 trials, the immunogenicity analyses included assessment of 
the GMT, GMFR, and seroresponse in the GP-ELISA and the PRNT assays. In all phase 2 trials, for ELISA 
antibody titres, seroresponse was defined as a post-vaccination ELISA titre ≥200 EU/mL that was also at 
least a 2-fold increase in ZEBOV IgG compared with baseline (primary endpoint), or at least a 4-fold 
increase (secondary endpoint). 
V920-009 (PREVAIL)  
The V920-009 “PREVAIL” trial was originally designed as a Phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled safety and efficacy trial of 2 leading Ebola vaccine candidates (V920, provided by MSD, 
and ChAd3-EBO Z, provided by GlaxoSmithKline) in adults 18 years of age or older in Liberia. Due to low 
EVD incidence, the V920-009 protocol was amended to enlarge the immunogenicity portion of the 
sub-study and to cancel the Phase 3 efficacy portion of the trial. The initial target of recruiting 600 adults 
to the Phase 2 immunogenicity part of the trial was achieved in March 2015 and subsequently expanded 
to recruit a total of 1500 subjects with follow-up for 12 months in order to obtain more safety and 
immunogenicity data. Group A [n=500] received ChAd3-EBO Z, Group B [n=500] received V920, and 
Group C [n=500] placebo. Even though the efficacy part of the study was cancelled, the protocol was 
further amended to include a ring vaccination strategy following three new EVD cases observed in 
November 2015 near Monrovia (Liberia), and to extend safety and immunogenicity follow-up to 2 or 3 
years post-vaccination. Ring vaccination data were collected and published (Gschell 2017, Bolay 2019), 
and reportedly do not add important safety information to the database. Since V920-009 is a supportive 
Phase 2 trial, the limited number of vaccinated subjects (n=444), the absence of identification of SAE 
through a passive follow-up and the obtention of immunogenicity data with a non-validated assay, these 
data are not considered critical for the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy assessment.   
Study population and design 
A total of 500 subjects were randomized and received V920. A majority of subjects were male (62.6%), 
and all subjects were Black or African. The median age was 29.0 years (range: 18 to 75 years). 
Twenty-two subjects (4.4%) who received V920 were HIV-positive based on HIV antibody testing at the 
vaccination visit. However, the serum taken for HIV testing at the vaccination visit was only tested after 
the vaccination was completed for the V920-009 trial. Therefore, no criteria for CD4 count or 
antiretroviral therapy could be applied for patients’ selection. Additional data is expected from on ongoing 
trial in HIV-positive subjects (V920-015). 
The trial design is acceptable, allowing to assess immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity compared to 
saline placebo (0.9% NaCl). As there was no known licensed vaccine to prevent EVD, the placebo group 
was also acceptable.  
Immunogenicity analysis population 
The FAS population served as the primary population for the analysis of immunogenicity and included 477 
subjects who had complete specimen sets available for immunogenicity testing in the validated GP-ELISA 
and PRNT through Month 12 post-vaccination. Some subjects were excluded from the analysis due to 
unevaluable serology sample or a missing assay result (for GP-ELISA, n=13 and for PRNT, n=49).

Immunogenicity analyses were not conducted for the PP population since only 1 protocol deviation was 
identified. 
Immunogenicity results 
The V920-009 report presented immunogenicity data for the vaccine group but not for the placebo group, 
as only the samples of the vaccine group were analysed with the validated assays, whereas the placebo 
samples were analysed earlier with the non-validated assays. The immunogenicity data of the placebo 
group were referenced through a publication (Kennedy et al. NEJM 2015). The number of subjects 
included in the placebo group decreased from 471 at Week 1, to 468 at Month 1, to 458 at Months 6 and 
12. 
Ninety-seven (20.9%) of 464 subjects tested had a baseline GP-ELISA ≥200 EU/ml. GP-ELISA GMTs for 
the V920 overall FAS population were higher than baseline at Month 1, Month 6, and Month 12, with a 
peak occurring at Month 1. GMTs constantly declined from 994.7 EU/mL [95% CI 915.0, 1,081.3] at 
Month 1 to 661.4 EU/mL [95% CI 613.2, 713.4] at Month 12. GMTs were higher at baseline for males 
(140.8 EU/mL [95% CI 127.2, 156.0]) compared with females (87.6 EU/mL [95% CI 75.1, 102.2]), but 
tended to be higher at all post vaccination time points for females (1,112.6 EU/mL [95% CI 964.9, 
1,282.9], 871.3 EU/mL [95% CI 756.7, 1,003.3], 818.2 EU/mL [95% CI 710.3, 942.6]) compared with 
males (930.6 EU/mL [95% CI 839.8, 1,031.3], 631.7 EU/mL [ 95% CI 578.6, 689.5], 582.2 EU/mL [95% 
CI 535.5, 633.0]). 
GP-ELISA titres increased in the overall FAS population from baseline by approximately 8-fold at Month 1 
and remained elevated (>5-fold) through Month 12.

93.8% of subjects had a seroresponse defined as a ≥2-fold increase from baseline and 200 EU/mL at any 
time post vaccination for the GP-ELISA. 82.3% of subjects had a seroresponse defined as a ≥4-fold 
increase from baseline at any time post vaccination. Overall, 90.0% [95% CI 86.9%, 92.6%] of subjects 
in the FAS population had seroconverted (defined as a ≥2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 EU/mL) 
at Month 1. The proportion only slightly decreased to 80.1% [95% CI 76.2%, 83.7%] at Month 12. 
Overall, 76.8% of subjects [95% CI 72.7%, 80.6%] had a seroresponse, defined as a ≥4-fold increase

65.6%] at Month 12. 
The trend for PRNT GMTs is comparable to what was observed for the ELISA GMTs. Like for the ELISA 
GMTs, also PRNT GMTs were higher than at baseline for all time points after vaccination and peaked in 
month 1. GMTs declined from 116.8 [95% CI 106.0, 128.8] at Month 1 to 76.8 [95% CI 69.9, 84.4] at 
Month 6 and raised again to 100.4 [95% CI 91.4, 110.3] at Month 12.

The immunogenicity data indicate an immune response at Month 1 sustainable through Month 12. The 
V920-009 trial is currently ongoing as a 5-year extension to evaluate immunogenicity at Months 24, 36, 
48, and 60 post-vaccination. In addition, studies V920-015 and V920-016 will evaluate the boosterability 
of V920 after a second dose (2 months after dose 1). Since pregnancy was an exclusion criterion, few data 
are available in this vulnerable population. 
V920-011 (STRIVE) 
V920-011 was a Phase 2/3 randomized, open-label trial conducted in Sierra Leone to evaluate the safety 
and efficacy of V920 in a population of at-risk healthcare workers and Ebola front-line workers. However, 
like V920-009, V920-011 could not collect efficacy data due to the declining incidence of EVD at the time

of conduct. After the trial was launched at multiple vaccination clinics, an immunogenicity sub-study of 
approximately 500 participants was added to the protocol as amendment 3 (27 April 2015) and initiated. 
Immunogenicity analyses were performed pre vaccination and at Months 1, 6, and 9-12. 
Study population and design 
The study population included adults 18 years of age and older who were at high risk of exposure to Ebola 
infection through their work in the study districts. This included 1) personnel working in healthcare 
facilities where care was provided for Ebola patients; 2) personnel working in non-Ebola healthcare 
facilities who may have been exposed to undiagnosed Ebola-infected individuals; and 3) personnel 
working in one of the following front-line job categories: surveillance team, ambulance team, burial 
workers, or workers responsible for swabbing deceased persons. Subjects with HIV were excluded from 
the trial. 
A total of 528 subjects were randomized. Of the 508 subjects who were vaccinated and provided samples 
for the assessment of immunogenicity, 506 subjects had at least one GP-ELISA result for immunogenicity 
samples collected within the allowed time windows and were included in the GP-ELISA FAS population. A 
total of 504 subjects had at least one PRNT result for immunogenicity samples collected within the allowed 
time windows and were included in the PRNT FAS Population. The ratio of male to female in vaccinated 
participants (58% versus 42%) was balanced. The mean age was 34.4 years of age. 100% of participants 
were black.  
There was no separate randomization process for the subjects in the immunogenicity sub-study, which is 
acceptable. 
The trial design included two vaccine arms (immediate or delayed) but no placebo arm. For the 
immunogenicity analysis, the data of both groups (immediate or delayed) were pooled, hence an 
assessment of immune responses against V920 compared to placebo cannot be made. 
Immunogenicity analysis population 
The (Full Analysis Set) FAS population served as the primary population for the analysis of 
immunogenicity and the PP population as the secondary. The FAS population included subjects who had 
at least one GP-ELISA result for immunogenicity samples collected within the allowed time windows. The 
Per Protocol (PP) population consisted of all randomized and vaccinated subjects with a serology 
assessment collected within the allowed time window. The PP population excluded subjects having 
baseline GP-ELISA assay results ≥200 EU/ml, violation of certain inclusion/exclusion criteria, and having 
a missing, unevaluable, or out-of-day-range serology result or sample at a particular time-point. A total 
of 424 subjects were included in the GP-ELISA PP population and 423 subjects were included in the PRNT 
PP population. The exclusion of subjects from the data analysis sets, for both the FAS and PP population 
as well as for the PRNT analysis was assessed and deemed acceptable. 
Immunogenicity results 
Seventy-six (15.0%) of the 506 subjects tested at baseline had a baseline GP-ELISA ≥200 EU/ml. 
Values for GP-ELISA GMTs for the FAS population were higher than baseline (92.7 Eu/mL  95% CI [85.3, 
100.9]) at Month 1 (964.3 Eu/mL [95% CI 878.7, 1,058.3]), Month 6 (751.8 EU/mL [95% CI 690.6, 
818.4]), and Month 9-12 (760.8 EU/mL [95% CI 697.6, 829.8) with a peak at Month 1 (table 5 above). 
GMTs plateaued thereafter from Month 6 through to Month 9-12.  
Like in study V920-009, GP-ELISA GMTs in females were lower (76.8 EU/mL [95% CI 67.6, 87.2]) pre 
vaccination compared to males (106.3 EU/mL [95% CI 95.3, 118.6]), but higher at all time points post 
vaccination (1,057.9 EU/mL [95% CI 907.8, 1,232.7], 904.9 EU/mL [95% CI 787.1, 1,040.4], 972.9

EU/mL [95% CI 849.3, 1,114.4]) compared to males (903.4 EU/mL [95% CI 804.1, 1,015.0], 655.3 
EU/mL [95% CI 591.2, 726.4], 631.2 EU/mL [95% CI 567.1, 702.5]).   
Overall, GP-ELISA titres increased from baseline by approximately 11-fold at Month 1 and remained 
elevated (>8-fold) at subsequent time points. 
Overall, 94.1% of subjects had a seroresponse defined as a ≥2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 
EU/mL at any time post vaccination for the GP-ELISA. Overall, 90% (95 CI 86.8%, 92.7%) of subjects had 
this seroresponse at Month 1. The seroresponse rate only slightly decreased to 87.8% [84.1%, 90.9%] at 
Month 9-12. 
A seroresponse defined as a ≥4-fold increase from baseline was overall observed for 79.8% (95% CI 
75.8%, 83.5%) of subjects at Month 1. The seroresponse rate only slightly decreased to 74.3% of 
subjects (95% CI 69.7%, 78.6%) through Month 9-12. A seroresponse defined as a ≥4-fold increase from 
baseline at any time was observed in 87.3% (95% CI 84.0%, 90.2%) of subjects. 
PRNT GMTs were almost comparable at Month 1 (116.0 [95% CI 105.7, 127.4]), Month 2 (95.3 [95% CI 
86.3, 105.3]), and Month 9-12 (119.9 [95% CI 107.9, 133.2]) (see table 6 above). Overall, 81.5% of 
subjects had a seroresponse defined as a ≥4-fold increase from baseline at any time post vaccination for 
the PRNT. Like for study V920-009 a positive correlation between GP-ELISA and PRNT results could be 
observed.  
Gamma irradiation in studies V920-009 and V920-011 
Gamma irradiation was performed for sera of V920-009 and V920-011 trial participants to eliminate the 
theoretical risk of Ebola infection for laboratory personnel processing specimens from at-risk populations. 
Lower GMTs, GMFRs, and seroresponses have been observed in the V920-009 and V920-011 trials 
conducted in Sierra Leone and Liberia compared to the V920-012 trial conducted in the US, Spain and 
Canada. GMTs were 995, 712, and 661 in study V920-009 on Month 1, Month 6, and Month 12, and 964, 
752, and 761, respectively for the same time points in study V920-011. GMTs in study V920-012 were 
higher at 1262, 1113, and 1078, respectively. 
Whether this is due to the gamma irradiation or to the studied population is difficult to conclude. In 
addition, the potential clinical implication of this finding is unknown in lack of a correlate of protection. 
Study V920-012 
V920-012 was a Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of three consistency lots and a high dose lot of V920 compared to normal saline placebo 
in healthy eligible subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 years. The rationale for the study was to 
demonstrate lot consistency and obtain additional safety data. Subjects were randomized to 2:2:2:2:1 to 
receive a single 1mL intramuscular injection of ≥2x107 pfu lot A (n=266), ≥2x107 pfu lot B (n=265), 
≥2x107 pfu lot C (n=267), ≥1x108 pfu “high dose lot” (n=266), or placebo (n=133). 
The trial was conducted at 42 trial centres: 40 in the United States; 1 in Canada; and 1 in Spain. The 
immune response was assessed pre vaccination, at 28 days and 6 months post vaccination for all 
subjects. At the Month 6 post vaccination visit (the last visit in the base study), a target population of 600 
subjects was asked to continue in a trial extension through Month 24 post vaccination to evaluate the 
durability of the V920 immune response. Additional blood samples were obtained at Months 12, 18, and 
24 post-vaccination for the evaluation of immunogenicity by GP-ELISA and PRNT (PRNT60). 
Study population 
Healthy, eligible subjects between 18 and 65 years of age were randomised and vaccinated in the 
V920-012 trial. A total of 1197 subjects were randomized and 1194 (99.7%) subjects were vaccinated. 
Assessment report

Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
1138 (96.9%) subjects completed the Month 6 post vaccination visit. Of these, 566 (48.2%) subjects 
entered the trial extension through Month 24 post vaccination. During the trial extension 55 of the 566 
subjects (9.7%) discontinued.  
Overall, 1039 subjects were included in the PP immunogenicity population on Day 1. 
Of the 1197 randomized subjects, 53.2% were female, 67.9% were White, and 85.2% were not Hispanic 
or Latino. The median age was 42.0 years (range: 18.0 to 65.0 years). The majority (94.7%) of subjects 
were enrolled in the US. The baseline characteristics for subjects who enrolled in the extension were 
generally consistent with those of the overall subject population in the base study. The majority of the 
subjects who entered the extension were female (55.1%), White (72.4%), and not Hispanic or Latino 
(85.9%). The median age was 42.0 years (range: 18 to 65 years). 
Immunogenicity analysis population 
The PP population served as the primary population for the analysis of immunogenicity data in this study. 
Subjects who were seropositive at baseline were excluded from the PP population. No analyses were 
performed on the FAS population because <10% of the subjects were seropositive at baseline. 
Immunogenicity objectives 
Two formal hypotheses were tested. 
Primary immunogenicity objective: 
1.  To determine whether vaccination with V920 from 3 separate consistency lots results in 
equivalent immunogenicity. 
Hypothesis: The GMT of anti-ZEBOV glycoprotein antibody measured by GP-ELISA at 28 days 
post vaccination will be equivalent across 3 consistency lots. The statistical success criterion for 
lot consistency requires the 2-sided 95% confidence interval on the pairwise lot-to-lot 
comparison of the GP-ELISA GMT ratio to be greater than 0.5-fold but no more than 2.0-fold. 
Secondary immunogenicity objectives: 
1.  To estimate the anti-ZEBOV GP-ELISA GMTs measured at 28 days post vaccination in the 3 
Consistency Lot groups (Lots A, B, and C combined) and the High Dose group. 
No formal hypotheses were tested. 
2.  To estimate the GMTs of neutralizing antibodies measured by plaque reduction neutralization test 
(PRNT 60) at 28 days post vaccination in the 3 Consistency Lot groups (A, B, and C combined) and 
the High Dose group. 
No formal hypotheses were tested. 
3.  To determine whether vaccination with V920 from 3 separate consistency lots results in 
equivalent immunogenicity. 
Hypothesis: The geometric mean titre of anti-ZEBOV glycoprotein antibody measured by ELISA 
(GP-ELISA) at 28 days post vaccination will be equivalent across 3 consistency lots. The statistical 
success criterion for lot consistency requires the 2-sided 95% confidence interval on the pairwise 
lot-to-lot comparison of the GP-ELISA GMT ratio to be greater than 0.67- fold but no more than 
1.50-fold. 
Immunogenicity results 
The primary and secondary objective to show lot-to-lot consistency between 3 manufacturing lots of V920 
in respect to immunogenicity was met. Equivalence between the 3 manufacturing lots has been shown in

the primary and the secondary analysis. The lot-to-lot consistency in terms of immunogenicity between 
the 3 manufacturing lots of V920 at Day 28 post vaccination in the primary analysis was demonstrated for 
the PP cohort as the lower bound of the 95% CI of the GMT ratio between the groups being compared was 
greater than 0.5 and the upper bound was less than 2.0. Also, in all 3 pairwise comparisons in the 
secondary analysis lot-to-lot consistency could be shown, as the lower bound of the 95% CI of GMT ratio 
between the comparison lots was greater than 0.67 and the upper bound was less than 1.5 as requested. 
Thirty-one (2.6%) of the 1197 subjects tested had a baseline GP ELISA ≥200 EU/ml. 
GP-ELISA GMTs were comparable between the 3 manufacturing lots for all time points post vaccination, 
i.e. from Day 28 through month 24. GMTs for all 3 lots were highest at Day 28 and constantly declined 
through month 24. The decline was approximately 25% from day 28 to month 24. Values for the 
combined lots group were 1,262.0 [95% CI 1,168.9 to 1,362.6] on day 28 and 920.3 [95% CI 820.4 to 
1,032.3] at Month 24. No meaningful difference between GP-ELISA GMTs of the 3 manufacturing lots 
group and the high dose group could be observed. The GMTs for the placebo group were less than the 
LLOQ of the GP-ELISA at all time points. Results of the GP-ELISA GMTs are provided in table 7 below and 
summarised in table 5 together with results from Protocols 009 and 011 (see Study V920-009). 
Table 7.  Summary of Geometric Mean Titres by Vaccination Group (Day 1 to Month 24) (GP-ELISA 
Per-Protocol Immunogenicity Population), V920-012 
GMFRs were comparable between the 3 manufacturing lots for all time points post vaccination. Titres for 
the V920 groups increased from baseline approximately 64-fold at Day 28 post vaccination and remained 
elevated approximately 48-fold from baseline at Month 24 post vaccination. No meaningful difference in 
GMFR between the combined manufacturing lots group and the high dose group could be observed. No 
GMFR was observed in the placebo group. 
The proportions of subjects with a seroresponse defined as ≥2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 
EU/mL at any time post vaccination ranged from 97.8% to 99.1% for the three V920 manufacturing lots 
groups and was 99.5% for the high dose group. The proportions of subjects with a seroresponse were 
generally comparable across the three V920 manufacturing lot groups across all time points post 
vaccination. No meaningful differences could be observed between the 3 manufacturing lots and the high 
dose group. Seroresponse rates are presented in table 8 below.

Table 8.  Summary of Seroresponse Rates (≥2-fold and ≥200 EU/mL) by Vaccination Group (Day 28 to 
Month 24) (GP-ELISA Per-Protocol Immunogenicity Population), study V920-012 
The proportions of subjects with a seroresponse defined as ≥4-fold increase from baseline at any time 
post vaccination ranged from 98.7% to 99.2% for the three V920 manufacturing lots groups and was 
99.5% in the high dose group. The proportions of subjects with a seroresponse were generally 
comparable across the three V920 manufacturing lot groups across all time points post vaccination. No 
meaningful differences could be observed between the 3 manufacturing lots and the high dose group. 
PRNT GMTs for the three V920 lot groups were generally comparable. No meaningful difference between 
the 3 manufacturing lots groups and the high dose group could be observed. The PRNT GMTs tended to 
slightly increase from Day 28 to Month 12/18 (see table 6 under Study V920-009) and were slightly lower 
at month 24 (267.6 [95% CI 239.4, 299.2] for the combined lots; 342.5 [95% CI 283.4, 414.0] for the 
high dose group; < 35 [95% CI <35, <35] for the placebo group). This was the same for the final dose 
and the high dose groups. The PRNT GMT pattern did not notably differ from the ELISA GMT pattern.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The final nominal dose of 2x107 pfu was selected based on protection in NHP challenge model and clinical 
immunogenicity data that were collected within a phase 1 dose-finding program including 8 clinical trials. 
The clinical dose-finding program is considered comprehensive and the dose selection of a nominal dose 
of 2x107 is justified. 
During the phase 1 clinical trials V920 has been administered across a broad spectrum of dose levels 
ranging from 3×103 pfu to 1×108 pfu to a total of 795 subjects. Immunogenicity was evaluated in Europe, 
US, Canada, and in non-epidemic African countries. The Phase 1 trials included 197 adult subjects who 
received a single dose of 2×107 pfu or higher of V920. Overall, 135 subjects received placebo in the Phase 
1 blinded trials. Based on the commercial release potency range, the nominal doses of ≥2x107 pfu used 
in the clinical trials were representative of the commercial dose (i.e. ≥7.2 x 107 pfu). It has to be noted 
that the vaccine dose of ≥2x107 pfu, designated for clinical trials, was assigned using a non-validated 
potency assay. During development, a modified potency assay was designed and validated at a new 
laboratory. The clinical supplies were retested in this validated assay and resulted in a reassignment of 
the potency value to 7.2 x 107 pfu/dose.  
To quantify total IgG binding antibodies against the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP, an indirect ELISA was used and 
the PsVNA or the PRNT assays to determine the virus neutralizing antibody levels. PsVNA was used in 7 
out of the 8 Phase 1 studies but it was not possible to further validate it because of technical limitations. 
nAb were detected with this assay (as with the PRNT assay) but a difference between the PRNT and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019

PsVNA with respect to nAb titres at the late time points was observed. PRNT assay was used in 1 out of the 
8 studies (study V920-004). Both ELISA and PRNT assays were only validated for the phase 2/3 clinical 
development program.  
The immunogenicity analyses in the clinical development program included GMTs, GMFRs, and 
seroconversion rates. Seroconversion was defined as a post-vaccination ELISA titre ≥200 EU/mL that was 
also at least a 4-fold increase in ZEBOV IgG compared with baseline in all phase 1 studies. In the phase 
2/3 trials seroresponse defined as a post-vaccination ELISA titre ≥200 EU/mL that was also at least a 
2-fold increase has been additionally evaluated (primary endpoint). Some subjects included in various 
Phase 1 studies were classified as seropositive at baseline. Baseline seropositivity could be due to 
previous EBOV exposure but might also be misclassified due to cross-reactivity to other viruses or to the 
performance of the technique.  Gamma-irradiation may also interfere.  
The applicant appropriately clarified the choice of the 200 EU/mL cut-off and the use of a dual criterion to 
determine a seroresponse. It cannot be excluded that the detection of ZEBOV GP-Ab at baseline in a 
certain proportion of samples could be due to cross-reactivity, however the definition of the seroresponse 
helps to minimize false-positive results. This is supported by the fact that the proportion of subjects 
seropositive at baseline in the V920-012 study was comparable to the proportion found in the V920-004 
study conducted in the US and represent a minority of the study population (n=31/1197, 2.6%). 
Similarly, undetectable previous infection (no circulating EBOV-GP Ab) or interference with other antigens 
might cause false-negative results. CMV antigen has been shown to inhibit detection of EBOV-GP specific 
Ab. It is not known if this inhibitory capacity is restricted to CMV antigen or if other antigen non-related to 
EBOV may interfere with the performance of the test.  
In the absence of Ab determination before vaccination or adequate identification of previously infected 
subjects at baseline, the role of any pre-existing immunity in the protection against EBOV infection cannot 
be strictly determined. Both the integrated summary of immunogenicity and correlates of protection 
reports may help to better understand the relevance of the immunogenicity data to predict protection and 
will be submitted post-authorisation. 
The results of the phase 1 trials allowed to assess the anti GP antibody kinetics after vaccination. GMTs, 
GMFRs, and seroconversion rates were higher at all time points after Day 14 in the vaccine groups 
compared with the placebo groups, where overall no immune response was observed. No immune 
response was observed for any dose of EBOV-naïve group on Day 7. The immunogenicity of V920 was not 
evaluated at Day 7 in a population with pre-existing EBOV-specific Ab. 
Antibody titres were measurable to a different extent in all dosing groups on Day 14. A dose response was 
observed with higher GMTs, GMFRs, and seroconversion rates in the higher dose groups, at the earlier 
time points (i.e. on Day 14, and less evident on Day 28). The difference in GMTs and seroconversion 
between lower and higher dose groups was smaller at later time points since antibody titres tended to 
continuously increase from Day 28 to 180/360 in the lower dosing groups whereas titres in the high dose 
groups (2x107 pfu and 1x108 pfu) tended to peak earlier (on Day 28) and plateaued afterwards with slight 
to moderate decrease from Day 180 to Day 360. Between the doses 2x107 and 1x108 no notably 
difference in immune response could be observed. This was confirmed in the Phase 3 trial V920-012.  
The results from the phase 1 trials were confirmed in the 3 phase 2/3 trials conducted during the time of 
the 2014 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in at-risk populations in Liberia (V920-009) and Sierra Leone 
(V920-011), as well as a population not at risk (V920-012) in US, Canada and Spain. V920 elicited a 
sustainable immune response through Month 24 which was the longest follow up time in the phase 2/3 
clinical development program during licensure (V920-012). Antibody peaked on Day 28 and more or less 
plateaued through Month 24 with only moderate decrease.

Immunogenicity was evaluated in Europe, Canada, and the US, as well as in African countries at risk or 
not at risk for Ebola. Lower GMTs, GMFRs, and seroresponse rates have been observed in the V920-009 
and V920-011 trials conducted in Liberia and Sierra Leone compared to those observed in the V920-012 
study conducted in the US, Canada and Spain. GMTs were 995, 712, 661 in V920-009 study on Month 1, 
Month 6, and Month 12, and 964, 752, and 761, respectively in study V920-011. GMTs in study V920-012 
were 1262, 1113, and 1078, respectively for the same time points.  Whether this is due to the gamma 
irradiation or to the population is difficult to conclude. In addition, the clinical relevance is unclear since a 
correlate of protection is not defined. Lot-to-lot consistency between three manufacturing lots containing 
the nominal final dose of 2x107 pfu was demonstrated in study V920-012.  
The trend for PRNT GMTs is overall comparable to what was observed for the ELISA GMTs. PRNT GMTs 
peaked at Day 28 (V920-009 and V920-011 studies) or at Month 18 (V920-012 study) and plateau 
afterwards through Month 12 (V920-009 and V920-011 studies) or Month 24 (V920-012 study).  
In study V920-009 and study V920-011 a higher immune response was observed in females compared 
with males. A sex-based difference in immune response is known from literature. Higher immune 
responses (ELISA GMTs) was also observed in subjects with pre-existing immunity, and in HIV-negative 
individuals compared with HIV-positive subjects. These findings are also known from other vaccines. The 
nAb titres (PRNT) were similar, regardless of pre-existing immunity. The clinical relevance of these 
findings with regard to clinical protection is currently unknown.  
Immunogenicity was evaluated in 40 younger individuals 6 to 17 years of age. These limited data do not 
indicate a diminished immunogenicity in the paediatric population of that age. 
A correlate of protection/protective titre associated with V920 is currently not known. In the efficacy ring 
trial V920-010 no immunogenicity was evaluated to directly estimate a protecting threshold on individual 
level. More data may become available post-authorisation.  
The antibody kinetic in the phase 1 and phase 2/3 trials suggests a sustainable immune response with 
slight to moderate but continuous decline of antibodies through 6 to 24 months. This is more evident in 
the ELISA results than in the PRNT results. Long-term efficacy and immunogenicity of V920 are unknown. 
Without a correlate of protection or knowledge about a protective titre for V920, sustained long-term 
efficacy cannot be directly inferred from persisting antibody titres by ELISA for the time being.  
The need (and optimal time point) for a booster dose are unknown. The V920-009 trial is currently 
ongoing in a 5-year extension to evaluate immunogenicity at Months 24, 36, 48, and 60 post-vaccination.  
Pre-existing immunity to the VSV vector was explored in two Phase 1 studies. Based on the limited 
available data, there is currently no indication that pre−existing immunity to VSV would impact 
V920-induced immunogenicity. In addition, given that VSV is not endemic or epidemic in the EU or Africa, 
it is not anticipated that there will be significant pre-existing anti-VSV immunity present in the areas most 
at risk of future Ebola outbreaks. 
Finally, adaptive (B- and T-cell) and innate responses were to be explored using various techniques such 
as EliSpot, flow cytometry or mass spectrometry. Results of the exploratory assays will be reviewed and 
submitted together with the related publications post-approval.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Protective immunity against Ebola virus infection and disease is not well understood. It seems to be 
mediated by both humoral and cellular immune responses (both innate and adaptive immunity). The 
quantity but also the quality of Ab (isotype, subclass, epitopes, functionality, etc) are thought to be 
important for protection and may depend on the cellular immune responses.  
Assessment report

Currently, there is no identified immune correlate of protection able to predict efficacy in humans and no 
immune correlate derived from bridging animal challenge data to humans. 
The aggregated immunogenicity data in human, i.e. results of both GP-specific Ab and 
ZEBOV-neutralizing Ab, support the finally selected dose of ≥2x107 pfu. The data indicate a robust and 
sustainable immune response induced by V920 at a dose level of ≥2x107 pfu. GP-specific antibody titres 
were measurable on Day 14 and peaked on Day 28. A slight to moderate decline of antibodies through 12 
to 24 months of follow up, in healthy adults from EU, US, Canada and African countries was observed 
thereafter. Like for the ELISA GMTs, PRNT GMTs were measurable from Day 14 through Month 12 to 24. 
The duration of immunogenicity after two years and the need for a booster are currently not known. 
Without a correlate of protection or knowledge about a protective titre for V920, (sustained) efficacy 
cannot certainly be inferred from the (persisting) antibody titres. The search for statistical correlates of 
protection that is ongoing might help to demonstrate the clinical relevance of the immune responses. This 
emphasizes the critical need of effectiveness data to further confirm or document the protective effect of 
this vaccine.  
Lot-to lot consistency in terms of immunogenicity was demonstrated.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Main study 
V920-010; the Guinea ring vaccination, open-label, cluster-randomized trial; 
Ebola Ça Suffit!  
V920-010 was a field-based, open-label, cluster-randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate the 
efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of a single administration of V920 at a nominal dose of the 2 x 107 pfu 
in the prevention of EVD when implemented as ring vaccination during an outbreak. This section covers 
Part A of the study, i.e. the ring vaccination trial. 
The trial was sponsored and implemented by the WHO.

Methods 
Study Participants  
The trial was based in Guinea, during the 2014–2016 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa. This 
area was chosen as EVD cases were confirmed in this country at the time of trial start. 
In this ring vaccination trial, a person newly diagnosed with EVD was assigned the index case, around 
whom an epidemiologically defined ring was formed. A cluster (ring) consisted of a list of contacts and 
contacts of contacts (CCCs) of the index case, regardless of their eligibility for V920 vaccination in the 
trial. From the complete cluster list, preliminary inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied to generate a list 
of all potential eligible CCCs to be approached for consent. 
Eligible CCCs were all ring participants aged ≥18 years, who did not have either of: 
•  history of EVD 
•  anaphylaxis to vaccine component 
• 
severe illness 
•  history of clinically important immunodeficiency 
•  pregnancy or breast-feeding, or 
• 
receipt of other investigational products in the previous 28 days 
After protocol Amendment V0.4 (dated 08-JUL-2015), the age limit was lowered down to 6-17 years. 
Treatments 
Subjects were assigned to either immediate vaccination or delayed vaccination (see also the following 
sections). At the Day 0 Visit, inclusion/exclusion criteria were checked, and after obtaining informed 
consent, eligible subjects assigned to immediate vaccination were given a single IM dose of 2 x 107 pfu 
V920 at the initial study visit (i.e. Day 0 from randomization), while those assigned to delayed vaccination 
received V920 vaccine 21 days after randomization (i.e. Day 21).  
Objectives 
This trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of V920 in the prevention of EVD 
when implemented as ring vaccination during an outbreak. 
Primary Objective: 
To evaluate the efficacy of the vaccination against laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus diseases (EVD) by 
conducting a clinical trial that compares the immediate and delayed ring vaccination. 
Secondary Objectives: 
a)  To assess the overall effectiveness of the vaccine (cumulative incidence) in the prevention of 
laboratory-confirmed EVD within the ring after 84 days of follow-up. 
b)  To assess the efficacy of the vaccine against death by laboratory-confirmed EVD. 
c)  To assess the efficacy of the vaccine against probable and suspected EVDs. 
d)  To evaluate the safety of the vaccine by assessing the SAEs for 84 days.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was confirmed EVD, defined as: 
•  any probable or suspected case from whom a blood sample taken was laboratory confirmed as 
positive for EVD; or 
•  any deceased individual with probable EVD, from whom a post-mortem sample taken within 48 
hours after death was laboratory confirmed as positive for EVD 
Laboratory confirmation is obtained by real-time (RT) validated reverse transcription PCR test for Ebola 
viral nucleic acid. Confirmed cases were thus defined per WHO guidelines as any suspected or probable 
case with a positive laboratory result.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints were probable EVD and suspected EVD, and safety outcomes. 
Probable EVD: Any suspected case evaluated by a clinician OR any person who died from “suspected EVD” 
and had an epidemiological link to a confirmed case but was not tested and did not have laboratory 
confirmation of the disease. 
Suspected EVD: Any person, alive or dead, who has (or had) sudden onset of high fever and had contact 
with a suspected, probable or confirmed Ebola case (EVD), or a dead or sick animal OR any person with 
sudden onset of high fever and at least three of the following symptoms: headache, vomiting, 
anorexia/loss of appetite, diarrhoea, lethargy, stomach pain, aching muscles or joints, difficulty 
swallowing, breathing difficulties, or hiccups; OR any person with unexplained bleeding OR any sudden, 
unexplained death. 
Ring participants were followed for EVD until the outbreak ended. The mechanisms put in place to monitor 
EVD and safety included: 
•  The national Ministry of Health (MoH) surveillance team, which was independent of the trial teams 
and conducted follow-up of the contacts for the first 21 days following the confirmation of the 
index cases (contact tracing); 
•  The study team, which performed follow-up of the contacts-of-contacts via study visits on Days 3, 
14, 21, 42, 63 and 84 post-vaccination scheduled for AEs and SAEs;  
•  The community ring representatives, which reported EVD cases via phone calls;  
•  New cases of EVD admitted to the Ebola Treatment Centres (ETC) were reported by the 
MoH/WHO centre. EVD cases were confirmed by PCR. 
Sample size 
Pre-specified sample size calculations assumed that each cluster would contain an average of 50 
consenting participants. 90% power was required to reject the null hypothesis of no vaccine efficacy, with 
the probability of a type I error (i.e. α level) set at 5%, for a two-sided test of significance. 
To account for the clustering (i.e. the design effect), an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.05 was 
assumed.  
Sample sizes were calculated by varying the percentage of contacts becoming infected and developing 
Ebola virus disease (i.e. the illness rate) between 1% and 5%. The potential vaccine efficacy was also 
varied from 50% to 90%. For example, if the vaccine efficacy was 70% and the infection rate 2%, then a 
total of 190 clusters would be needed (95 in each arm). However, if the vaccine efficacy was 90%, with 
a 2% infection rate, then a total of 98 clusters would be needed (49 in each arm).

The trial was done in an adaptive manner, for which a two-sided symmetric O’Brien-Fleming alpha 
spending strategy truncated at an absolute value of 3.00 was used (the O’Brien-Fleming threshold for the 
interim analysis was 0.0027).  
This trial was designed in an adaptive fashion with the most likely target being about 100 randomized 
rings to either immediate or delayed vaccination at the interim analysis and 190 rings at the final analysis. 
No boundary for futility or low conditional power was pre-specified, although the trial could have been 
expanded in an adaptive fashion if the observed event rate was lower than expected. The data and safety 
monitoring board could decide whether to continue or stop the trial, according to success, failure, or 
insufficient evidence. 
Thus, the exact timing of the interim analyses was not pre-planned and depended on various factors, 
including, but not limited to, the total number of EVD events observed in the trial. In particular, the timing 
could have been modified if the observed EVD rate was higher or lower than the assumed value of 2% 
during the trial period. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was at the level of cluster, not at the individual level. Randomization took place only when 
the numeration of CCCs for a ring was closed. The ring randomization was in a 1:1 ratio to either 
immediate vaccination or delayed vaccination with a single dose of V920. 
Eligible subjects cluster-randomized to immediate vaccination had only one opportunity to give their 
informed consent (Day 0), while eligible subjects assigned to the delayed clusters had 2 opportunities to 
consent, on Day 0 and on Day 21. 
Due to the identified consenting issues in 363 individuals (documented in monitoring reports), a 
re-consenting effort was implemented by the trained trial team for all individuals in rings 1 to 90 who had 
not yet completed their last visit as a means to ensure that the consent was documented appropriately. 
The rate of subjects consenting on Day 0 is around 20% higher in the immediate vaccination arm 
(2151/3232 = 66.6%) than in the delayed vaccination arm (1435/3096 = 46.4%). This might suggest 
that randomization results were known to a large extent prior to consenting. The impact of this potential 
selection bias is not known. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label, so blinding of participants and investigators/field teams was not possible. 
The vaccine vials had the manufacturer’s labelling and were not designed for a specific subject. 
The Guinea national Ebola surveillance team and the trial team were independent of each other; the trial 
team did not communicate any specific information regarding any of the listed contacts and contacts of 
contacts to the surveillance teams and associated laboratories. For example, it did not provide 
information with regards to which EVD index cases were used to form a new ring or which people would 
be included in a given cluster or ring. Surveillance laboratory staff was therefore blinded to the 
randomization to the immediate or delayed vaccination or vaccination status of any suspected case 
sample being tested. 
Information about the allocation to immediate or delayed vaccination was made available for a given ring 
only after the enumeration of the ring members was completed and registering the ring with the DMC at 
CTU Bern. To conceal randomization until all informed consents had been obtained for a given ring, the 
file(s) containing information about allocation were not opened by any person involved in recruiting 
participants and other trial personnel (including the statistician responsible for the data analysis) until the 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019  
Page 63/117 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
primary analysis was completed. If such file(s) were opened, a signed and dated note-to-file was stored 
in the respective subfolder of the CTU Bern trial file indicating the name of the person who opened it, 
responsible person who authorized the opening, and reason for the opening. 
Statistical methods 
The incidence of EVD was compared between the 2 arms over defined time periods measured from the 
time of randomization of each ring. Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness were estimated as the overall 
reduction in the EVD incidence in rings that were randomized to immediate vaccination compared to those 
randomized to delayed vaccination. VE was defined as 1- the hazard ratio for EVD (i.e., the estimated 
hazard of EVD for individuals in a ring that receives immediate vaccination over the estimated hazard of 
EVD for individuals in a ring that receives delayed vaccination). 
The operational definition of per protocol analysis period censored events of EVD occurring <D days after 
vaccination (immediate arm) or after enrolment (delayed arm). In practice, D was later set at 10 days. 
Thus, by default, only confirmed EVD cases occurring ≥10 days post-randomization were valid endpoints 
for the trial to account for the incubation and vaccine response periods.  
In the delayed vaccination arm, participants were administratively censored 10 days after vaccination. 
Participants in the immediate vaccination arm were administratively censored on the same date as the 
last participant censored in the delayed vaccination arm or at 84 days (end of follow-up period), 
whichever comes first. Any individual who is lost to follow-up was censored at the last known date of 
observation.  
Vaccine efficacy or vaccine effectiveness against EVD was assessed across 9 different populations (see 
table 9 below). Many of these analyses were suggested in published commentary or based on feedback 
from regulatory agencies. In addition, 8 out of these 9 populations described in table 9 (except population 
#2) were used to assess vaccine efficacy against the EVD death endpoint. 
The primary analysis (not pre-specified) compared subjects vaccinated at Day 0 in the immediate arm vs. 
subjects who consented on Day 0 in the delayed arm for the estimation of vaccine efficacy. 
Table 9.  V920-010: Study populations for primary and secondary analyses 
Of note, the primary analysis in published literatures compared all vaccinated in immediate arm versus all 
eligible subjects assigned to delayed vaccination arm (Population #3). Based on relative clarity regarding 
Assessment report

timing of consent on Day 0, subjects labelled in the database as consented at Day 0 were proposed to be 
utilized as the final primary efficacy analysis population in this submitted CSR (Population #1). 
Vaccine effectiveness calculations were based on an estimation of the overall reduction in EVD in rings 
including vaccinated and non-vaccinated subjects. The estimation of transmission parameters was not 
completed at the time of the evaluation procedure. 
Finally, the applicant included an analysis to compare the incidence of EVD with onset before the 10-day 
post-vaccination cut-off in the immediate versus the delayed vaccination clusters. This analysis served to 
respond to a regulatory agency comment on interim results of the trial. 
DSMB recommendation 
An independent DSMB was incorporated in the protocol to review efficacy and safety data on a monthly 
basis. On 3 July 2015, an interim analysis was performed based on 48 clusters in the immediate arm and 
42 clusters in the delayed arm. The primary analysis compared all vaccinated individuals from the 
immediate arm with all eligible individuals in the delayed arm. At 10 days or more post-randomisation, no 
cases of confirmed EVD occurred in the immediate arm compared with 16 cases (from 7 rings) in the 
delayed arm. Results showed 100% efficacy, but p-value did not cross the interim stopping threshold of 
0.0027 for efficacy (p-value 0.0036 according to Fisher’s exact test comparing the proportions of clusters 
with one or more eligible case).  
Due to the low likelihood of being able to recruit substantial numbers of additional rings, the DSMB 
decided to stop randomization and to immediately vaccinate all eligible subjects in any newly identified 
rings. In addition, the trial was extended to areas of Sierra Leone adjoining the border of Guinea and was 
amended to include children 6 to 17 years of age. 
Results 
Subject disposition and baseline demographic characteristics 
A total of 476 confirmed EVD cases were identified. Of these, 361 cases were excluded and rings were not 
defined around them. The majority (76%) of excluded cases were due to distance, delayed reporting, or 
inadequate study team capacity. Therefore, rings were defined for the remaining 115 cases in Guinea and 
for 2 additional cases from Sierra-Leone, resulting in a total of 117 rings comprising a total of 11,841 
CCCs. 
Among 11,841 subjects enrolled into the trial, 9,096 subjects were from 98 randomized clusters, 
comprising of 4,539 CCCs (51 clusters) in immediate vaccination arm and 4,557 CCCs (47 clusters) in 
delayed vaccination arm.  
Of 19 non-randomized clusters (2,745 CCCs), 3 rings were constituted before randomization was initiated 
(i.e. pilot phase of trial) and 16 constituted after randomization discontinuation as per the DSMB 
recommendation. Only immediate vaccination was available for subjects in the non-randomized clusters. 
The proportion of CCCs eligible for vaccination with V920 was 71% (3,232/4,539) in the immediate arm 
and 68% (3,096/4,557) in the delayed arm. The proportion of CCCs who were eligible and provided 
consent is lower for the subjects randomized to immediate (47%) vs. delayed vaccination arms (56%) 
(respectively 2151 and 2539 including 1435 consenting on Day 0). Overall, the vaccination rate was 66% 
(2,119/3,232) in the immediate arm and 66% (2,041/3,096) among the eligible subjects of the delayed 
arm who gave consent either on Day 0 or Day 21. 
The median age for 117 index cases was 35 years in both the immediate and delayed randomized rings 
and 23 years in the non-randomized rings. Overall, females comprised 59.8% of the index cases.

Approximately 77% of the clusters in the randomized arms were located in rural areas, compared to 47% 
of clusters in the non-randomized group (Table 10). 
Table 10.  V910-010 – Baseline Characteristics of Index Cases and Clusters  
The index cases and clusters randomly allocated to immediate vaccination vs. delayed vaccination were 
generally comparable at baseline, including age of index cases, the time from symptom onset to 
hospitalization/isolation of index cases or inclusion of clusters, and location of clusters (Table 10). 
The proportion of index cases that were dead at the time of randomization was slightly higher in the 
delayed arm compared to the immediate arm, which did not appear to result in more high-risk contacts in 
delayed arm (Table 11 below). The average cluster size in delayed vaccination arm was 30.5 compared to 
42.2 in immediate vaccination arm, when the primary analysis is restricted to eligible subjects who 
consented on Day 0 only. 
The majority of eligible CCCs were male, with females comprising 30% to 37% of consented subjects in 
the randomized rings and 35% in the non-randomized group (Table 11 below). The mean age of 
consenting CCCs was 35 years. There were 536 eligible, consented subjects ≥65 years of age, and 194 
children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age were enrolled in nonrandomized group and vaccinated 
(Table 11 below). 
The baseline characteristics of the eligible CCCs with consenting status in the immediate versus the 
delayed arms are presented in Table 11 below. The two arms are largely comparable. 
Notably, more than 80% of consenting CCCs were the contacts of contacts of the index cases (Table 11). 
The proportion of contacts classified as high-risk was slightly higher in the immediate vaccination arm 
(15%), compared with subjects in the delayed vaccination arm who consented on Day 0 (12%) and 
subjects who consented on Day 21 (5%).

Recruitment 
The trial was conducted in the region of Basse-Guinée, a coastal area of Guinea, West Africa, and 
comprised the capital Conakry and surrounding prefectures in Guinea (Figure 1). There were 9 
prefectures in Guinea represented in the trial. This area was chosen because it was the only area of 
Guinea in which cases of EVD were confirmed at the time of the start of the study. As the epidemic was 
still active in Sierra Leone, it was proposed to extend the Ring vaccination to two prefectures in Sierra 
Leone adjoining the borders of Guinea (Kambia and Bombali) as per protocol V0.5.

Figure 2.  Study Area of the Ring Vaccination Trial 
Recruitment in the pilot phase occurred from March 23 to April 1, 2015. The randomization occurred over 
17 weeks, from April 1 to July 21, 2015. After July 27, all consenting subjects received the vaccine 
immediately. The last subject was enrolled in November 2015. Last subject last visit (LSLV) was on 20 
January 2016. The study lasted (from first enrolled subject to Day 84 visit of the last subject followed) 303 
days (~10 months). 
Conduct of the study 
World Health Organization (WHO) was the study sponsor and MSD/NewLink is the V920 vaccine 
manufacturer. 
The trial’s steering committee coordinated the project. The Guinean health authorities, WHO, and MSF 
were part of the trial’s Steering Committee, presided over by National Institute of Public Health (INSP), 
Norway. 
MSF led the trial operations within the country, in close collaboration with Guinean authorities, the WHO 
as well as other partners on the field. Guinean health authorities contributed to the implementation of this 
trial, most specifically by providing medical advice, communication methods, and ownership of federal 
land.  
WHO oversaw data management, statistical analysis and activity modelling. Moreover, WHO coordinated 
all GCP training and monitoring operations, the Data Safety Monitoring Board, as well as the independent 
trial audit. WHO provided assistance during implementation of the trial on the field, where necessary. 
The University of Bern, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), the University of 
Florida and Public Health England contributed to the development of the protocol, prepared the statistical 
analysis plan, contributed to epidemiological methods and analysis, provided trial expertise ensured data 
management, ensured statistical analysis of trial results, and mathematical modelling. 
The Centre for Vaccine Development Mali and University of Maryland provided the trial team with GCP 
training and ensured clinical trial control.

The trial team headquarters was located at a single centre in the region of Basse-Guinée (Guinea) in 
Conakry from which this trial was conducted under the responsibility of the PIs. The trial’s field teams 
travelled from the single centre headquarters to the temporary trial ring sites (place of residence of the 
newly laboratory confirmed EVD case), once they were identified, and conducted all visits at the ring sites 
until the last visit (Day 84) was completed and the rings were considered closed. 
Protocol amendments: 
This clinical trial was implemented according to V0.3 of the protocol and its subsequent amended 
versions, V0.4 (written after the interim analysis) and V0.5. 
There were changes in the inclusion/exclusion criteria in Protocol V0.3, V0.4 and V0.5. 
Protocol V0.4 (dated 08 July 2015) was implemented following the DSMB meeting of 03 July 2015 (see 
above).  
In addition to clarifications and wording corrections, the other principal changes from V0.3 to V0.4 were: 
• 
Included the decision of the DSMB meeting of 03-Jul-2015 to allow enrolment of adolescents (12 
to 18-year-old) and to stop allocation into the delayed arm. 
• 
Included the decision to allow enrolment of children 6-12 years (dependent on safety results, 
expected 4 weeks later).  
Fifty-five protocol deviation reports were completed, which enumerated impact to 819 subjects. Eighteen 
of the 55 reports also described deviations impacting multiple subjects but did not identify the exact 
subjects impacted (6 of which described conventions for capturing data in source or CRF, which were 
applied generally throughout the trial, but did not necessarily impact all subjects). 
Seven reports were identified as presenting risk to the subject (or another person’s) safety, rights, or 
privacy.  
Trial Monitoring: 
Regular monitoring visits at study sites were performed according to ICH GCP by AARSH, an independent 
Contract Research Organization (CRO) from Senegal, under contract to the Centre for Vaccines 
Development (CVD) in Mali.  
An independent audit (performed by external contractor) was organized by the sponsor (WHO) in Guinea 
(audit and follow up visit in August 2015 and November 12, 2015) as well as in WHO headquarters, 
Geneva, Switzerland (23 September 2015). 
The scope of the audit was as follows: (i) Sponsor’s organization, facilities, equipment, operating 
procedures, in Guinea; (ii) On site investigations (vaccination and follow-up); (iii) Coordination and 
synergy with the National Ebola response program; (iv) Data verification, consistency between CRFs and 
electronic data-base; (v) e-Trial Master File and Investigator Site File. 
The objectives of this audit were: GCP compliance of the trial-related activities, with review of provisions 
regarding: (i) Safety, rights and well-being of participants; (ii) Reliability and credibility of the trial data. 
The CSR states that no critical observations were reported and no instances that would cause concern 
regarding patient safety or the integrity of the trial data were evident.

The primary efficacy analysis (analysis 1(P)) included all subjects vaccinated in the immediate arm versus 
all subjects who were eligible and consented on Day 0 in the delayed arm. The secondary analyses 
compared the following populations’ subsets: 
•  All vaccinated in immediate versus all eligible in delayed (secondary analysis 1(S1)). 
•  All eligible in immediate versus all eligible delayed (secondary analysis 2(S2)). 
•  All CCCs in immediate versus all CCCs in delayed (secondary analysis 3(S3)). 
Vaccine effectiveness was an estimation of the overall reduction in EVD in rings that were randomized to 
immediate vaccination compared to those randomized to delayed vaccination.

*4 EVD cases occurred ≥10 days after randomization in vaccinated CCCs from the delayed clusters, all occurred <10 
days of vaccination. 
Table 13 above also presents the numerators. Endpoints were laboratory confirmed EVD cases in the 
treatment or control groups. Since EVD cases were confirmed through the Cellule de la Coordination 
Nationale de Lutte contre la Maladie a Virus Ebola, Republic of Guinea MOH, information on EVD outcome 
was available for all subjects who had appropriate EVD testing, regardless of their informed consent 
status.  
A total of 105 cases of confirmed EVD were identified during the pilot and main study phases (36 in the 
immediate clusters, 50 in the delayed clusters, and 19 in the non-randomized clusters).  
A total of 71 cases of confirmed EVD less than 10 days after randomization were identified (26 in the 
immediate clusters, 28 in the delayed clusters, and 17 in the non-randomized clusters).  
A total of 34 cases of confirmed EVD occurring 10 days or more after randomization were identified (10 in 
the immediate clusters, 22 in the delayed clusters, and 2 in the non-randomized clusters).  
Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness primary and secondary analyses were performed on populations whose 
early endpoints (subjects reporting EVD with onset <10 days from randomization) were removed.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Attack rates 
A total of 105 cases of confirmed EVD were identified during the pilot and post-randomization phase 
(n=19) and the main study phase (n=86).  
The attack rates for the time period <10 days after randomization vary between 0.5% and 0.8% 
depending on the population subset. These rates were similar in the immediate vs. delayed vaccination 
arms, and for those vaccinated vs. not vaccinated. Attack rates were also similar for the comparison of the 
primary populations’ subsets (vaccinated immediate vs. consented Day 0 delayed, respectively 0.5% vs. 
0.4%). Thus, there was no effect of vaccination on EVD cases that occurred <10 days of randomization.  
In contrast, no EVD cases occurred ≥10 days of randomization in those vaccinated immediately, while 10 
cases occurred in the delayed arm consenting on Day 0 subjects. For this primary comparison, attack 
rates were respectively 0.0% and 0.7% (vaccinated immediate vs. consented Day 0 delayed). Attack 
rates were similar for subjects assigned to the delayed vaccination group (0.5%) or not vaccinated in the 
immediate groups (0.6%). 
Clustering of the cases 
The 20 and 21 cases of EVD that occurred <10 days of randomization among eligible CCCs involved 9 and 
14 clusters, respectively in the immediate and delayed arm. The 7 and 16 cases of EVD that occurred ≥10 
days of randomization among eligible CCCs involved 4 and 7 clusters, respectively in the immediate and 
delayed arm. The 10 cases involved in the primary analysis only involved 4 clusters. 
Occurrence of EVD in contacts vs. contacts-of-contacts: 
There were 27 cases (<10 days or ≥10 days of randomization) in the population used for the primary 
analysis (vaccinated immediate vs. consented day 0 delayed). 
•  Of the 11 cases that occurred <10 days of randomization in subjects vaccinated in the immediate 
arm, 1/11 was a contact-of-contacts, and 10/11 were contacts (all high-risk contacts).  
•  Of the 6 cases that occurred <10 days of randomization in the consenting on Day 0 in the delayed 
arm, none was contact-of-contacts, and 6/6 were contacts (of which 5 high-risk contacts).  
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019  
Page 71/117

•  No case occurred ≥10 days of randomization in subjects vaccinated in the immediate arm.  
•  Of the 10 cases that occurred ≥10 days in the subjects consenting on Day 0 in the delayed arm, 
3/10 were contact-of-contacts, and 7/10 were contacts (of which 1 high-risk contact). 
Of the study population, 20% were contacts and 80% were contacts-of-contacts. In contrast, of all the 27 
EVD cases that occurred in the primary analysis population, nearly all (n=23) were contacts (mainly 
[n=16] high-risk contacts), and only 4 were contacts-of-contacts (3 of them occurred ≥10 days). The 
over-representation of high-risk contacts was even more marked in for the EVD cases that occurred <10 
days after randomization (of 17 cases, 15 high-risk contacts). 
Vaccine efficacy against EVD 
Ten confirmed EVD cases were observed among 1,429 eligible subjects in the delayed vaccination arm 
who consented on Day 0, compared to 0 cases among 2,108 eligible subjects in the immediate 
vaccination arm. Efficacy with V920 was 100%, with 95% CI ranging from 63.5% to 100%; p=0.0471 
(Fisher’s exact test comparing rings) (Column 1 of the table below). 
Table 14.   Vaccine effect on EVD cases for different comparisons of study population in the V920-010 
trial 
To supplement this primary analysis, an additional analysis was performed in all eligible subjects of the 
delayed vaccination arm who consented at any time. The vaccine effect was 100% (95% CI: 60.1% to 
100%); p=0.0226 (Column 2 of Table above). 
The V920-010 study was designed to enrol 190 rings. The Interim Analysis (IA) was conducted on 90 
rings. Although the interim analysis results did not reach the prespecified criterion, randomization in the 
trial was stopped because it was determined that it would be difficult to define new rings. The decision was 
made by the DSMB to vaccinate all subsequent subjects immediately. Therefore, the final analysis was 
conducted on 98 rings following the recommendation of the DSMB to stop random assignment into 
immediate and delayed vaccination. Thus, the Applicant regards the analysis including only consented 
subjects based on 98 rings (corresponding to a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI: 63.5% to 100%)) to 
Assessment report

represent a final analysis and not an interim analysis. In addition, the population (only consented 
subjects) utilized in this final analysis differed from that used at the interim analysis (eligible subjects) 
based on a request from the FDA and reflects a more conservative analysis. Even though a different 
population was used for the primary vs. the interim analysis, from a statistical perspective multiplicity 
should be accounted for. Therefore during the procedure the Applicant was asked to provide confidence 
intervals adjusted for multiplicity leading to a vaccine efficacy of 100% (unadjusted 95% CI: 63.5% to 
100%; 95% CI adjusted for multiplicity: 14.4% to 100%) (0 cases in the immediate arm; 10 cases in 4 
rings in the delayed arm).  
Additional efficacy and effectiveness analyses on EVD 
Planned secondary analyses that assess vaccine effectiveness against confirmed EVD and efficacy against 
death from laboratory-confirmed EVD supported the primary analysis. 
Comparing all vaccinated subjects randomly assigned to immediate vaccination versus all eligible 
subjects assigned to delayed vaccination – the primary analysis in medical literature, demonstrated a 
vaccine effect of 100% (95% CI: 68.9% to 100%); p=0.0045 (Column 3 of table above). 
Other analyses including vaccine effectiveness using a variety of populations, such as all randomized 
subjects regardless of vaccination status or all clusters irrespective of randomization, suggested trends of 
a benefit of vaccination (Columns 4-5, 8-9 of table above). It is notable that all cases of EVD among 
subjects randomized to the immediate arm occurred in the unvaccinated subjects. Furthermore, no 
subject who received the V920 vaccine developed Ebola disease 10 or more days after vaccination. 
Vaccine efficacy for preventing death 
The secondary efficacy analyses for preventing EVD deaths are presented in table 15 below. A key 
comparison was between all vaccinated subjects in immediate arm versus all eligible subjects in delayed 
arm who consented on Day 0, yielding a vaccine effect of 100% (95% CI: 64.3% to 100%); p=0.0471. 
Results from other populations were consistent with analyses on EVD endpoint.

Other efficacy analysis 
The incidence of EVD before the 10-day post-vaccination cut-off, in the immediate arm versus the 
delayed arm, is presented in table 16 below. This data is based on the final primary efficacy analysis 
population.

Table 16.  V920-010: EVD incidence after vaccination before and after the 10-day post-vaccination 
cut-off: all vaccinated in immediate vs. all eligible in delayed (primary analysis) 
During Days 0-9 post-vaccination, 11 EVD cases occurred in the immediate arm and 3 in the delayed arm 
(symptom onset on Days 0, 6, or 6 post-vaccination), and 10 cases in the non-randomized group. 
From randomization to Day 21 in the delayed arm, 13 cases were reported, 6 cases with onset from 
randomization to Day 9, and 7 cases with onset from Day 10 to Day 21 following randomization. 
Kaplan-Meier curves 
Kaplan-Meier curves show that the incidence of EVD cases in the first 10 days following vaccination or 
enrolment was similar in the immediate, delayed, and nonrandomized clusters (Figure 2 below). 
However, no EVD cases occurred ≥10 days post-vaccination in any group. 
No EVD cases after 32 days post-randomization were identified in randomized and non-randomized 
clusters in vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals, suggesting that V920 might have contributed to 
the interruption of Ebola transmission. 
Overall, the assessment of the durability of protection in this design is limited. Aligning the interval of 
efficacy assessment in both immediate and delayed vaccination arms allows for the conclusion that 
duration of protection is of at least 31 days.

Ebola Ça Suffit! 
Design 
Field-based, Phase 3, open-label, cluster-randomized, controlled ring 
vaccination trial, designed to evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of 
1 dose of V920 in the prevention of EVD when implemented as ring 
vaccination. A cluster (ring) consisted of all contacts and contacts-of-contacts 
(CCCs) of the index case (new case of a laboratory-confirmed EVD in the trial 
area). Clusters were randomized to the immediate arm or to the delayed 
(control) arm in a 1:1 ratio.  
The trial was conducted in Guinea, during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola 
outbreak.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
V920-010 is a field-based, Phase 3, open-label, cluster-randomized, controlled, ring vaccination trial, 
designed to evaluate the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of 1 dose of V920 in the prevention of EVD 
when implemented as ring vaccination. The study sponsor was WHO. The study was conducted in Guinea 
during the 2014–2016 outbreak of EVD in West Africa. A cluster (ring) consisted of all contacts and 
contacts-of-contacts (CCCs) of the index case (new case of a laboratory-confirmed EVD in the trial area). 
Clusters were randomized to immediate arm (vaccination 1-2 days after randomization) or delayed 
(control) arm (vaccination 21 days later) in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects were followed from the constitution of 
the ring up to 84 days after the vaccination through study visits by the trial’s team. The MoH/WHO 
surveillance team visited the subjects up to 21 days after the contact (contact tracing). New cases of EVD 
admitted to the Ebola Treatment Centres (ETC) were reported by the MoH/WHO centre. EVD cases were 
confirmed by PCR. 
The ring vaccination design is an innovative alternative in an outbreak setting to allow for a pragmatic 
conduct. Although more prone to biases compared to an individually randomised trial, this design was 
much more likely to yield robust data on the efficacy of the vaccine despite the low and declining 
incidence. 
Overall, the definitions of contacts and contact-of-contacts and eligibility criteria are endorsed. A new 
cluster was defined if at least 60% of the CCCs were not enumerated in a previous cluster. The 
Assessment report

geographical distribution of the rings suggest that important overlaps may have occurred in the largest 
prefectures, however individuals geographically located in several rings were assigned to and vaccinated 
as part of the first ring in which they were included. As there is no data to quantify the extent of 
geographical overlap between clusters, biases due to this overlap cannot be excluded. For example, it is 
questioned whether the proportion of subjects who were exposed to 2 or more index cases was 
comparable between the immediate and the delayed arms. The impact of potential bias remains uncertain 
as no sensitivity analyses accounting for overlapping clusters could be performed. 
Objectives and endpoints 
The aim of the study was to assess efficacy (primary analysis) over a defined period of time of 21 days and 
effectiveness over a broader period of 84 days after randomisation.  
Asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic cases were described during the West African outbreak. However, 
the study was designed to detect cases of EVD using the standard WHO case definition, with fever as key 
symptom, and not to detect possible subclinical cases of EVD. The use of confirmed EVD as primary 
efficacy endpoint is consistent with WHO guidelines. For this trial, only RT-PCR assay was used for 
laboratory confirmation of Ebola infection. 
Blinding 
The V920-010 trial is open-label. The EVD case detection in the field was not blinded to the subject’s 
allocation status. The direction and magnitude of any resulting bias is unknown. The group allocation 
information was not communicated to the national surveillance lab staff.  
Statistical analyses 
The incidence of EVD was compared between the 2 arms over defined time periods measured from the 
date of first vaccination within the ring for subjects in the immediate arm, and the date of first enrolment 
within the ring for subjects in the delayed vaccination arm. 
Cases of Ebola occurring <10 days after randomization/enrolment were censored. The time after which 
the vaccine is perceived to provide full protection in the vaccinees was selected by default to be at least 
10 days after randomization, taking account of both the incubation time and the putative 
vaccine-response period. The 10-day censoring period was specified prior to the conduct of the efficacy 
analyses with the intention to minimize the post-exposure effect in the efficacy analyses. A protective 
effect of V920 against EVD cases was expected in contacts-of-contacts. In practice, the effect was mainly 
seen in contacts, which could include post-exposure effect. 
The populations compared for the primary efficacy analyses were not pre-specified. The primary efficacy 
interim analysis compared all subjects vaccinated in the immediate arm versus all subjects eligible in the 
delayed arm. After that analysis was published, the FDA requested that the primary efficacy analysis 
focus on all subjects vaccinated in the immediate arm compared to all subjects who consented on the Day 
0 visit in the delayed arm. This approach is considered appropriate as the subset consenting on Day 21 is 
highly biased in particular because it discards subjects who presented EVD during the relevant period (i.e. 
0 to 21 days). The secondary analysis estimating the overall ring vaccination effectiveness in protecting 
all CCCs was pre-specified. It is considered as the intention-to-treat analysis and the less susceptible to 
selection bias, hence the most valid.  
Statistical methods were only very briefly defined in the protocol and SAP. Furthermore, the methods 
used to derive the results for the primary endpoint were not pre-specified in the protocol and SAP, 
however the applied test is considered to be a conservative approach.  
The Sponsor planned to conduct an interim analysis after approximately 100 clusters. The interim 
analysis results were not significant based on the pre-planned multiplicity adjustment, but randomization

in the trial was stopped by the DSMB because of the low probability of being able to recruit substantial 
numbers of additional rings (given the declining number of cases of Ebola virus disease in the country). 
The Applicant presented these data in the CSR without multiplicity adjustment and conducted one 
post-hoc analysis, i.e. the interim analysis, which was used as primary analysis using the full alpha. Using 
the full alpha at interim after stopping the trial is not considered a suitable approach as it would always 
allow rejecting the null hypothesis at the full alpha level at interim. This approach is hence not considered 
sufficient to control the type 1 error rate. The study is considered to have failed to meet its primary 
endpoint; an adjusted confidence interval was therefore also provided in the SmPC. 
All analyses were done at the cluster level, and hence the high intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was 
included in the analyses. A Bayesian model with Beta prior for probability of EVD and treatment effect as 
only covariate was used. The underlying assumptions and consequences of the Bayesian model are 
uncertain. Stratification factors were not taken into account in any of the analysis. As using stratification 
factors in the analysis model usually helps to reduce heterogeneity, the approach taken is considered to 
be conservative and is hence acceptable. 
Conduct of the study 
The trial was conducted in the region of Basse-Guinée, a coastal area of Guinea, and comprised 7 
prefectures in Guinea (including Conakry). This area was the only area of Guinea in which cases of EVD 
were confirmed at the time of the start of the study. Two prefectures in Sierra Leone were added during 
the non-randomised phase. After the randomisation phase, the Protocol was amended to include children 
and adolescents from 6 years of age. 
The trial team headquarters was located in Conakry. The trial’s field teams travelled from the 
headquarters to the temporary trial ring sites to conduct the visits. This trial was performed in particularly 
challenging logistical circumstances.  
Several concerns about GCP potential compliance issues which may impact on data accuracy were raised 
during the assessment: (i) Inconsistencies between protocol, CSR, published papers; (ii) Monitoring was 
regularly performed at the Sponsor's Coordination Center in Conakry, but study sites were not monitored; 
(iii) One independent audit organized by the Sponsor in August 2015 (after most subjects completed the 
randomisation phase) raises several major GCP concerns. In particular: operations of the activity of the 
sponsor and the investigator are not described in a consolidated manner in the study procedures, 
inconsistencies were found between the database and the source documents including with respect to 
SAEs.  
Considering the limitations of the trial given the specific circumstances in which it was conducted (i.e. in 
Africa during an Ebola outbreak), the lack of study sites available for an inspection, the unmet medical 
need for a prophylactic intervention against EVD, and given the context of the ongoing WHO-declared 
Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 
the request for a GCP inspection has been waived.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study randomised 4539 CCCs (3232 eligible) in 51 clusters, 4557 CCCs (3096 eligible) in 47 clusters 
over approximately 4 months while the epidemic was ending.  
Baseline data 
Both arms were roughly distributed in a balanced way over time although a slightly higher proportion of 
the immediate clusters was recruited during the first third of the period as compared to the delayed 
clusters (41% vs. 36%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019  
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
Page 81/117 
 
 
 
The median size of the clusters was similar in both arms (80 CCCs in immediate vaccination groups and 
81 CCCs in delayed vaccination groups). However, the cluster size was not balanced across arms for the 
primary analysis (average ring size in terms of participants who consented prospectively was 42.2 and 
30.5 respectively in the immediate and delayed arms). This may bias the cluster-level analysis but not in 
favour of the vaccine. 
The proportion of eligible CCCs was approximately 70% for both arms, the main reason for non-eligibility 
being age below the lower limit (6 years). Eligible CCCs who were cluster-randomized to delayed clusters 
had two opportunities to consent. In this arm, 31% of CCCs consented on Day 0 (versus 47% in the 
immediate arm), and 24% of the CCCs consented on day 21.  
Demographic data for the subsets of eligible subjects who consented on Day 0 is comparable across arms, 
and the same applies for the proportion of contacts-of-contacts (80%) vs. contacts (20%), supporting the 
primary analysis. The proportion of high-risk contacts was however slightly different (15% vs 12% 
respectively in the immediate and delayed arms. The subsets used for the (primary) analyses could differ 
with respect to other important characteristics predicting the EVD, such as the time interval between the 
onset of symptoms in the index case and the context, and the nature and frequency of the contacts. 
Numbers analysed and attack rates of EVD cases 
A total of 105 cases of confirmed EVD were identified during the pilot and post-randomization phase 
(n=19) and the main study phase (n=86, of which 36 pertained to the immediate clusters and 50 to the 
delayed clusters). All confirmed EVD cases used for the main outcome were reaffirmed by repeat testing 
at the European Mobile Laboratory (EML).  
During the randomization phase, most cases of confirmed EVD occurred <10 days after randomization1 
(70% and 50% in the immediate and delayed arms), reflecting the fact that nearly all cases occurred in 
(high-risk2) contacts who were likely already exposed to infection before randomization. There was no 
effect of vaccination on EVD cases that occurred <10 days after randomization (attack rates 0.4-0.8% 
whatever the subset). In contrast, no EVD case occurred ≥10 days after randomization in those 
vaccinated immediately, while 10 cases occurred in the delayed arm in those consenting on Day 0. For 
this primary comparison, attack rates were respectively 0.0% and 0.7%. Attack rates were similar for 
subjects assigned to the delayed vaccination rings (0.5%) or not vaccinated in the immediate rings 
(0.6%).  
Of the study population, 20% were contacts and 80% were contacts-of-contacts. In contrast, of all the 27 
EVD cases (10 cases that occurred <10 days and 17 cases that occurred ≥10 days) which occurred in the 
population used for the primary analysis, nearly all (n=23) were contacts (of these, 16 were high-risk 
contacts), and only 4 were contacts-of-contacts (3 of them occurred ≥10 days). Thus, as expected, there 
was an overrepresentation of (high-risk) contacts amongst EVD cases, especially in EVD case that 
occurred <10 days from randomisation.  
There was no EVD case that occurred ≥10 days post-vaccination (i.e. ≥31 days after randomisation in the 
controls) among the 5,837 subjects who received the V920 vaccine in all 117 rings, both randomized 
(immediate, delayed) and non-randomized. In the delayed arm, 4 cases of EVD ≥10 days 
post-randomization were reported in vaccinees, but all occurred within 10 days of vaccination.  
Efficacy results 
1 for the delayed arm, vaccination is 21 days after randomisation. Thus, when it is referred to <10 after randomisation, the 
delayed (control) arm was not yet vaccinated. 
2 high risk contacts were defined as individuals in close contact with a patient

The V920 vaccine demonstrated to be efficacious after a single IM administration at the intended dose of 
2 x 107 pfu, in preventing EVD in the studied population. The primary analysis shows a VE of 100% 
(95%CI: 63.5 to 100% and p-value 0.0471 without multiplicity adjustment; adjusted 95%CI: 14.4 to 
100% based on 0 cases in the immediate arm and 10 cases in 4 rings in the delayed arm). Randomization 
was stopped after an interim analysis with a p=0.0036 that did not meet the pre-specified alpha level of 
0.0027. The final analysis was conducted on 98 clusters and the interim analysis on 90 clusters, thus 
formally only confidence intervals and p-values adjusted using the pre-planned alpha-spending approach 
should be reported.   
As the estimation of VE was based on only 4 clusters with 10 confirmed EVD cases ≥10 days after 
randomization, the result is formally not statistically significant and confidence intervals are very wide. 
This adds uncertainty regarding the actual level of protection induced by the vaccine.  
A secondary analysis to include all eligible subjects in the delayed arm yielded consistent results, except 
the 95%CI lower bound changed to 68.9%. Furthermore, preplanned secondary analyses on EVD death 
are consistent with the primary analysis.  
The secondary vaccine effectiveness analyses comparing all CCCs (i.e., including non-eligible and 
non-vaccinated subjects, ITT analysis) or comparing all eligible subjects indicates trends of vaccine 
benefit but was statistically inconclusive. In this particular trial, the ITT analysis leads to the overall 
vaccine effectiveness, by comparing the cluster-level incidence in immediately vaccinated clusters 
(including all CCCs who did not receive the vaccine) versus delayed clusters. The overall vaccine 
effectiveness is a valuable public health measure reflecting the overall utility of the strategy.  
Efficacy was found in a population mixing contacts and contacts-of-contacts. Of the 10 cases included in 
the primary analysis after the censored period of 10 days post-vaccination, 7 were contacts and 3 were 
contacts-of-contacts. 
Whilst it is considered that vaccine efficacy is demonstrated despite the limitations, it is difficult to 
differentiate any effect of pre-exposure vs. post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) because the trial was not 
designed to assess this. The robustness of the data in favour of a ‘pure’ pre-exposure effect is hampered 
by the limited number of cases that occurred in contacts-of-contacts (3 cases vs. 7 cases in contacts) of 
the yet-to-be-vaccinated delayed (control) arm. However, these data are consistent with the 
demonstration of protection that was shown in the NHP model. 
Median time from symptom onset to hospitalization/isolation in the index cases was approximately 4 days 
in both arms, which is consistent with the literature, and median time from symptoms onset in the index 
case to randomization was 10-11 days. At randomisation, 59% and 68% of the index cases had died 
(immediate and delayed respectively). This shows that contacts, especially those at high-risk, were likely 
already exposed since several days when vaccinated, and thus may already have contracted the infection 
when vaccinated (average incubation period for Ebola is 8-10 days [min-max 2–21 days]). As underlined 
in the CSR, EVD cases in contacts may not have been fully averted unless there was a post-exposure 
prophylactic effect from the vaccine. However, since vaccination had an effect on EVD with onset >10 
days post-randomization period and not before, the vaccine may have no effect when administered late 
after exposure.  
Data for PEP in the context of laboratory and health-care workers in Europe/US is very limited. Seven 
cases were reported by the Applicant, with varied potential exposures to Ebola, and they were given V920 
around 2 days after the accident. None developed evidence of Ebola virus infection or disease. The 
nominal dose used was ranging from 5x107 pfu/mL to ≥1×108 pfu/mL, thus in the range of the doses 
used in the trials. In contrast with preventive protection, there are very limited NC data on post exposure 
effects. Only a small NC challenge study in rhesus macaques suggests post-exposure efficacy.  
Duration of protection

Given the trial’s design, efficacy/effectiveness was studied only over a short period of approximately three 
weeks (10 to 31 days post-randomization). The duration of the vaccine’s protective effect in the 
prevention of EVD is thus unknown. In addition, data from NHP challenge studies on the potential 
durability of V920 in protecting against EBOV are considered limited at this time (see section 2.3). Data 
from a NHP study showed only partial protection (<50%) at Month 3 after a single IM dose of V920, and 
interestingly unprotected vaccinated animals still had substantial amounts of antibodies measured by 
ELISA and PRNT50. Given the existing NHP data, and especially the current unknowns about both the 
specific mechanism of protection against EVD and a protective antibody titre, caution needs to be 
exercised to infer the V920 vaccine protection duration based on the immunogenicity data. It is important 
that more data is collected in order to understand duration of protection and need for booster doses in the 
context of the ongoing and future Ebola outbreaks.  
Limitations of the ring vaccination trial data  
Many sources of biases are present, which are an integral part of the uncertainties around the results: 
informed consent given based on the knowledge of the assigned group; potential failures in contact 
tracing; lack of clarity or inconsistencies in case detection and matching processes; potential differences 
in exposure to study teams during the primary endpoint ascertainment period with a possible impact on 
the knowledge and behaviour. The impact and direction of potential biases is not known.  
The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was unexpectedly high due to the clustering of 6 confirmed 
endpoint EVD cases in one of the rings. This shows that specific transmission pathways occurred at the 
local level. The impact of the lack of independency of EVD events is a loss of power, but also possible 
biases due to imbalance between arms as specific chains of transmission may have occurred at the level 
of a few rings.  
Although it is currently not known which epitopes are responsible for the immune protective responses, 
no data suggest that V920 is not efficacious against all strains of Zaire ebolavirus. Immunogenicity of 
V920 suggests that the immune responses are at least as robust in subjects living in non-endemic regions 
as in endemic regions. It is unlikely that V920-induced immune response will be impaired by pre-existing 
anti-VSV immunity. Based on limited data, pre-existing immunity to Ebola virus defined by the selected 
cut-off does not appear to have a negative impact on the immunogenicity of V920. Thus, there is a priori 
no rationale to anticipate lower vaccine efficacy in EU subjects (non-endemic) compared to African 
subjects from endemic countries.  
Limitations remain in terms of the extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in a ring vaccination context to 
a prophylactic vaccination context. 
Given the important limitations of the currently available efficacy data, and in the absence of a correlate 
of protection, there is a need to generate additional data to further confirm the vaccine’s clinical effect. It 
will not be possible to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of V920 in EU subjects in a future randomized 
clinical trial. Thus, coordinated efforts to generate vaccine effectiveness data from contexts with 
long-lasting or recurrent outbreaks are essential. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In combination with non-clinical data, the results of the pivotal V920-010 ring vaccination trial “Ebola Ça 
Suffit” provided evidence that a single IM dose of the V920 vaccine at a concentration of 2 x 107 pfu is 
efficacious to prevent EVD in adults at risk of infection during an outbreak setting. 
However, uncertainties remain as to the actual level of protection, the duration of protection and the type 
of protection (pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis) given the methodological limitations and the 
exceptional circumstances experienced during a declining Ebola epidemic as discussed above.

The findings present many important limitations in terms of internal validity and precision of the efficacy 
estimate. In addition, data may lack the reliability usually expected from a pivotal randomised 
placebo-controlled trial, which however was unavoidable given the exceptional circumstances in which 
the trial was conducted and its alternative design.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the limitations related to efficacy data: 
• 
there is limited data in HIV-infected individuals. Immunogenicity will be further investigated in 
these subjects in study V920-015 (ACHIV); 
• 
there is limited data on duration of protection and on long term follow up data. Duration of 
immunogenicity will be addressed in study V920-016 (PREVAC), in study V920-009 (PREVAIL) 
and in study V920-005 (Geneva). 
•  effectiveness data obtained by partners in future outbreaks should be submitted as they become 
available post-authorisation. 
Recommendations for future clinical development 
• 
• 
The final study report for study V920-013 should be submitted as soon as available. 
The final study reports for study V920-018 (efficacy and safety in frontline workers in Guinea, 
part B of the efficacy trial V920-010) should be submitted as soon as available. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The clinical development program to assess safety consisted of 12 trials mostly blinded, but also open 
label trials. 8 Phase I trials and 4 Phase II and III trials were conducted. These trials were designed and 
conducted independently by a number of different sponsors in the same timeframe in response to the 
Ebola outbreak in 2014.  
A total of 15,997 adult subjects were vaccinated with V920 in the 12 clinical trials (see table below); 
15,399 of these subjects received 2 × 107 plaque forming units (pfu)/dose or higher of V920. Safety was 
evaluated in all trials. The trials also included approximately 536 eligible, consented adults ≥65 years of 
age, 234 children 6 to 17 years of age, as well as 278 women who were incidentally found to be pregnant 
during the clinical trials and 22 HIV-positive individuals. 
The phase 2/3 placebo-controlled randomized trials (Protocol 009 and Protocol 012) comprised 500 
African subjects of Liberia and 1061 subjects of US, Spain and Canada.

The trials were conducted in different geographical regions (e.g., Africa only vs Europe/North America 
only) and under different circumstances (e.g., outbreak vs non-outbreak, community vs clinical settings), 
and used varying methods for data collection (e.g., phone contact with subjects vs in-person visits). The 
trials were not designed or conducted by the various sponsors with the final objective of data integration 
among them. Consequently, the datasets could not be properly harmonized and integrated to provide a 
meaningful and interpretable integrated dataset. It was feasible to integrate SAE data from blinded trials 
because of the more uniform collection methods for SAEs across trials. SAE data from open-label trials 
were not included in this integration, as unblinded safety assessments are potentially subject to bias. 
Data from the 2 large, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 and 3 trials, V920-009 
and V920-012, provide the basis of the primary safety assessment for V920. Data from the 2 large 
open-label trials, V920-010 and V920- 011, as well as the 8 Phase 1 trials, provide supportive safety 
information. 
The majority of subjects who received V920 in each of the Phase 1 blinded trials experienced solicited 
injection-site AEs (43.1% to 86.7%, V920 Combined Dose groups) and systemic AEs (59.6% to 98.3%, 
V920 Combined Dose groups) through 14 days post-vaccination, and the proportions of V920 recipients 
who reported AEs were higher compared with subjects who received placebo ([10.6% to 33.3%] and 
[33.3 to 100%], respectively). Within the V920-groups in the different trials a heterogeneous reporting 
rate from 15% to 50% for arthralgia was observed. Myalgia, objective fever, and subjective fever were 
reported with a higher incidence in the V920 groups compared to placebo groups. Objective fever was 
generally reported as mild in intensity in the V920 Phase I blinded trials, but 3 subjects experienced 
severe objective fever. 
In each of the V920 Phase 1 open-label trials, the most commonly reported solicited injection-site AE 
through 14 days post-vaccination in the 2 × 107 pfu/dose V920 group was injection-site pain. The 
majority of solicited injection-site AEs was reported within the first day (≤24 hours) following vaccination. 
The median durations of injection-site pain, redness/erythema, and swelling reported for the 2 × 107 
pfu/dose V920 group ranged from 1.5 to 3.0 days, 1.0 to 3.0 days, and 1.0 to 8.0 days, respectively. 
In each of the V920 Phase 1 open-label trials, the most commonly reported solicited systemic AEs in the 
2 × 107 pfu/dose V920 group through 14 days post-vaccination were headache (50.0% to 60.0%), fever 
(V920-006; reported as pyrexia in V920-007 and objective fever in V920-008) (30.0% to 56.3%), fatigue 
(10.0% to 55.0%), myalgia (12.5% to 70.0%), and arthralgia (10.0% to 25.0%). 
Unsolicited systemic AEs associated with lab abnormalities that were reported in the V920 Phase 1 blinded 
trials were generally not reported in the open-label trials. Only 1 adult subject in the 2 × 107 pfu/dose

V920 group of the V920-007 trial reported an AE of abnormal hepatic function. The majority of 
vaccine-related unsolicited systemic AEs were mild to moderate in intensity. The only severe 
vaccine-related unsolicited systemic AEs reported for subjects in the 2 × 107 pfu/dose V920 group was 
malaise and muscle tightness (in the Phase I trial V920-006). 
Phase 2/3 trials 
 Injection-site reactions 
The main studies to evaluate non-serious AEs are the field-based study V920-009 and the 
Applicant-sponsored study V920-012, both double-blinded and placebo-controlled and respectively 
comprised 498 African subjects of Liberia and 798 subjects in US, Spain and Canada. 
In the V920-009 trial, subjects were prompted at each safety follow-up visit to report injection-site 
reactions, which were defined as a composite term of injection-site pain/tenderness or local reaction 
(defined as erythema or swelling, with severity grades: mild – moderate –blistering – 
ulceration/necrosis/potentially life threatening). All subjects who experienced injection-site reaction 
reported injection-site pain, and few reported local reactions at any time point (30 minutes, Week 1, or 
Month 1). Injection-site pain was reported for 34.0% and 11.2% of subjects in the V920 and placebo 
groups, respectively, at any time point, and was most prevalent at the Week 1 visit (30.7% and 6.8% of 
subjects in the V920 and placebo groups, respectively). The maximum intensities for AEs of injection-site 
pain and local reaction at any time point were mild or moderate.  
In the V920-012 trial, subjects were prompted to report the injection-site AEs of erythema, pain, and 
swelling on the vaccination report card (VRC) on Days 1 to 5 post vaccination. A majority (72.3% to 
70.4%, respectively) of subjects in the V920 Combined Lots (2x107 pfu/dose) and High Dose (1x108 
pfu/dose) groups reported VRC-prompted injection-site AEs during the first 5 days post vaccination, 
compared with 14.3% of subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently reported injection-site AEs in 
each group were injection-site pain, followed by injection-site swelling, and injection-site erythema, with 
no evident dose dependency. The majority of injection-site AEs were mild to moderate in intensity, with 
a median duration of 1 to 3 days. 
 Systemic Adverse Events 
The frequency of the following systemic AEs was reported in a higher proportion of vaccinated subjects 
compared with subjects who received placebo or were unvaccinated: headache, pyrexia, fatigue, 
myalgia, arthralgia, arthritis, chills, sweats (hyperhidrosis), nausea, abdominal pain, and rash. These 
systemic AEs were usually reported during the first 7 days post vaccination; the majority were of mild to 
moderate intensity and of short duration (less than 1 week). 
In the V920-009 trial, solicited systemic AEs were reported for a higher proportion of subjects in the V920 
(61.6%) group compared with subjects in the placebo group (43.3%) at any time point. The most 
frequently (≥10%) reported systemic AEs in the V920 and placebo groups were headache, pyrexia, 
myalgia, and fatigue. Other solicited systemic AEs reported more commonly reported in the V920 group 
compared with the placebo group included nausea, arthralgia, and hyperhidrosis. The incidences of other 
systemic AEs including arthropathy, joint stiffness, and joint swelling were comparable between the V920 
and placebo groups (Table 19). 
In the V920-012 trial, solicited and unsolicited systemic (non-injection-site) AEs were reported for 62.3% 
of subjects in the Combined Lots group, 68.5% of subjects in the High Dose group, and 33.8% of subjects 
in the placebo group from Days 1 to 42. The most frequently (≥10%) reported systemic AEs in the 
Combined Lots, High Dose, and placebo groups were pyrexia, headache, arthralgia, pain, and chills. Other 
systemic AEs reported more commonly in any V920 group compared with the placebo group included 
nausea, fatigue, influenza-like illness, and myalgia (Table 19). The majority of these AEs were mild to

moderate in intensity, with a median duration of 1 to 3 days. Arthritis was reported at a rate <5%, 
however this was at a higher frequency in the vaccinated subjects than placebo subjects and is discussed 
further below. The most frequently reported systemic AEs as assessed by the investigator as 
vaccine-related (>5% in one or more vaccination group) from Days 1 to 42 post vaccination were pyrexia, 
headache, arthralgia, chills, and fatigue. The majority of vaccine-related systemic AEs were mild or 
moderate in intensity, with a median duration of 1 day. 
An additional systemic AE of abdominal pain was reported in a higher proportion of subjects in the 
Immediate Vaccination group (17.1% [including 1 severe event]) compared to the Deferred Vaccination 
control group (7.3%) in the V920-011 trial.

 Subjects were solicited for events of joint pain, joint swelling, rash, and blisters on the Vaccination 
Report Card (VRC). The investigator then reviewed the totality of the symptoms and provided the 
adverse event terms provided in the table (e.g., arthritis, arthralgia). 
The reference table of ADRs within the 4 Phase 2/3 studies has been amended by the key methodological 
differences in data collection methods, explaining much of the frequency variations among the different 
studies. This allows a good comparison to the frequency indications in the SmPC. It has been noted that 
the rash and chills frequency occurring in the V920-011 study is slightly higher than the SmPC indications, 
but this is acceptable, since this was an open-label study less considered by the applicant for AE frequency 
determination; rash is considered  borderline (between common and very common) and chills an outlier 
compared to the other studies.

Table 21.  Subjects with Injection-Site and Systemic Adverse Events in V920 Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials 
Conducted in African and Non-African regions 
Intrinsic factors including demographic characteristics of age, gender, and race were evaluated in the 
V920-012 trial. Regional differences were examined as extrinsic factors by evaluating solicited AEs in the 
V920 clinical trials (V920-009, -010, and -011) conducted in the African regions during the 2014-2016

epidemic and the V920-012 clinical trial that was conducted in non-African region. The safety profile of 
V920 was generally consistent across gender, age, race, and geographic region with the aforementioned 
higher risk of arthritis in females.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Within the clinical development of Phase 1 studies, 14 subjects reported SAEs, and only one  SAE resulted 
in death after a motor vehicle accident. All SAEs in the Phase 1 studies were not considered to be related 
to study vaccine. Regarding serious adverse events in general, data from all blinded, placebo-controlled 
clinical trials (V920-001 to -005 as well as -009 and -012) were integrated and compared with placebo. 
There was a low overall incidence of SAEs across all trials. In the integrated analysis of blinded trials, SAEs 
occurred in 3.4% of all vaccine recipients and 7.8% of placebo recipients through 1 year post vaccination. 
The constellation of SAEs in the blinded trials was consistent with conditions commonly observed in the 
trial population. Few SAEs were considered related to vaccination by investigators in the blinded studies. 
No V920 recipients discontinued due to SAEs.  
In Phase 2/3 studies, regarding deaths, there was no striking incidence of events with a fatal outcome. 
Deaths were generally balanced among vaccine and placebo recipients. None of the deaths were 
considered vaccine-related by the investigators.  
In the V920-009 trial, 11 subjects (1.1%) experienced an AE that resulted in death. Overall, the nature 
and type of fatal AEs reported in the V920 group are consistent with events anticipated in the population 
or a specific demographic, and do not suggest increased risk due to vaccination. 
In the V920-012 trial, 3 subjects experienced 1 SAE each that resulted in death. The events included 
craniocerebral injury due to a fall, hepatic failure due to alcoholism, and road traffic accident. All of these 
events, due to extrinsic factors, do not indicate increased risk due to vaccine. 
In the V920-010 trial, 18 (0.3%) adult vaccinated subjects experienced an SAE that resulted in death. 
EVD was the most frequently reported reason for death. It is important to note, however, that all cases of 
EVD reported for subjects randomized to the Immediate Vaccination group occurred in unvaccinated 
subjects or in vaccinated subjects prior to 10 days postvaccination. No subject who received study 
vaccine developed EVD 10 or more days following vaccination. None of the deaths in this trial was 
considered by the investigator to be related to the study vaccine. 
In trial V920-011, 19 of 25 subjects (=0.2% of study population) who died had received V920. The 
proportions of subjects who died were comparable in each vaccination group with 8 deaths in the 
Immediate Vaccination group, 6 deaths (including a post-6-month postpartum haemorrhage) in the 
Deferred Vaccination group (prior to vaccination), and 11 deaths in the Deferred-Crossover group (after 
vaccination), all but one event occurred during the 6-months follow-up each. None of the SAEs and deaths 
was considered to be related to study vaccine by the investigator. One subject experienced an event of 
severe abdominal pain on Day 10 postvaccination and died from an unspecified aetiology 8 days later.  
Regarding other Serious Adverse Events, in the integrated analysis of the blinded Phase 1/2/3 studies, 
the most commonly reported SAE from Days 1 to 365 for subjects in the V920 group was malaria (1.5% 
of subjects in the V920 group and 5.6% subjects in the placebo group); all of the SAEs of malaria were 
reported in the V920-009 trial. In addition to the V920-009 trial, SAEs of malaria were reported in the 
V920-010 trial in Guinea and V920-011 trial in Sierra Leone. In the V920-011 trial, more subjects in the 
Immediate Vaccination group reported SAEs of malaria than subjects in the Deferred Vaccination and 
Deferred-Crossover groups (12 subjects versus 2 subjects in the Deferred Vaccination group and 3 
subjects in the Deferred-Crossover group). The basis for this difference is not clear. However, Sierra 
Leone has one of the highest rates of malaria in the world and the diagnosis is frequently made clinically 
rather than by laboratory confirmation. In the cases of malaria diagnosed without a conclusive diagnostic 
Assessment report

laboratory test, it is unclear whether febrile reactions postvaccination may have been given the clinical 
diagnosis of malaria. In addition, the seasonality of malaria and the different seasons that subjects were 
vaccinated in the Immediate and Deferred-Crossover groups may partly account for the differences in 
numbers of cases among the groups. 
Since the time of integration of the SAE data described above, SAE data from Months 6 to 24 post 
vaccination, the longest time period for SAEs collected to date in the V920 program, have become 
available for the V920-012 trial. Of the 65 total SAEs reported from Day 1 to Month 24 post vaccination, 
39 SAEs were reported for 27 subjects from Month 6 to Month 24 post vaccination. Most of these SAEs 
were reported as single events by one subject each. Three SAEs with fatal outcome were reported from 
Day 1 to Month 24 post vaccination. None of the SAEs were considered related to study vaccine by the 
investigator. The integrated SAE data were not updated to include the additional SAE data from the 
V920-012 trial as only 7 subjects experienced SAEs from Months 6 to 12 post vaccination. 
In the V920-010 trial, 80 subjects experienced SAEs, including 65 vaccinated subjects (61 adults and 4 
children). The most common diagnosis was EVD in 39 (48.7%) of 80 subjects. One SAE of febrile reaction 
in one subject and one SAE of anaphylaxis in another subject, which resolved without sequelae, were 
judged by the investigator and Sponsor (the WHO) to be related to vaccination, and one SAE of 
influenza-like illness, which also recovered without sequelae, was considered possibly-related. 
Evaluation of Arthritis Adverse Events 
Joint-related AEs occurred more commonly in V920 recipients compared with placebo recipients across 
the V920 clinical program. Adverse events of arthralgia were reported for 10% to 50% of subjects, and 
arthritis was less commonly reported (<5% in most trials but up to 24% in the V920-005 trial). The 
majority of joint events were mild to moderate in intensity. Arthralgia was generally reported in the first 
few days following vaccination and resolved within one week after onset, whereas arthritis was generally 
reported within the first few weeks following vaccination and resolved within several days to weeks after 
onset. Some subjects experienced severe events or recurrent or prolonged joint symptoms lasting up to 
2 years following vaccination, the longest follow-up to date. In a small number of subjects, vaccine virus 
was recovered from joint effusion samples as a possible hint for a virally mediated process. Arthralgia, as 
described for systemic AEs in the V920-012 trial, was very commonly observed in the first few days 
following vaccination, whereas arthritis was observed less commonly in most trials. 
In the V920-009 trial, the verbatim term “arthritis” was not solicited and “arthritis” was not reported as 
an unsolicited AE. However, the terms arthropathy, joint stiffness, and joint swelling which align with the 
definitions of arthritis applied in the V920-004 and V920-005 trials were captured. Joint complaints other 
than arthralgia were reported for a few subjects in the V920-009 trial and the events were comparable in 
the V920 and placebo groups: arthropathy (3 subjects in the V920 group, 1 subject in the placebo group), 
joint stiffness (2 subjects in the V920 group, 1 subject in the placebo group), and joint swelling (2 
subjects in the V920 group, 2 subjects in the placebo group).  
In the V920-012 trial, arthritis was solicited based upon the early results from V920-005. The incidences 
of arthritis (composite term: including MedDRA preferred terms (PT) of arthritis, monoarthritis, 
polyarthritis, osteoarthritis, joint swelling, or joint effusion) from Days 5 to 42 were 3.7% and 3.1% for 
subjects in the Combined Lots and High Dose groups, respectively. No subjects in the placebo group 
experienced arthritis. The following MedDRA PT events constituted the composite arthritis events:   
•  Arthritis: 1.0% and 0.4% in the Combined Lots and High Dose groups, respectively 
• 
• 
Joint effusion: 0.4% in the High Dose group 
Joint swelling: 2.5% and 2.7% in the Combined Lots High Dose groups, respectively 
•  Osteoarthritis: 0.1% in the Combined Lots group 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019  
Page 92/117 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
•  Polyarthritis: 0.1% in the Combined Lots group 
In the V920-012 trial, a post-hoc multivariate logistic regression analysis that controlled for covariates 
demonstrated that female sex and a positive medical history of arthritis were independent baseline 
variables that are associated with a 2.2- to 2.8-higher risk of developing post vaccination arthritis, 
respectively, with 95% CI lower bounds of 1.1 and 1.3, respectively.  
In contrast with other trials, arthritis was reported by a higher (23.5%) proportion of V920 recipients in 
the V920-P005 trial for reasons that have not been elucidated. Half of the subjects with arthritis among 
vaccinees reported Grade 3 severity of symptoms, and 6 subjects reported recurrent or persistent joint 
symptoms up to 2 years post vaccination. 
Evaluation of Skin and Mucosal Adverse Events 
In the V920 clinical program, certain skin- and mucosal-related AEs were observed in subjects following 
vaccination. These events generally occurred at a low incidence, were mild to moderate in intensity, and 
were self-limited. Across the V920 program, vesicular lesions of the skin (blisters) appearing in the first 
few weeks after vaccination were reported in some of subjects. In addition, some subjects vaccinated 
with V920 experienced oral ulcers. A small number of rashes including vesicular lesions of the skin were 
positive for V920 vaccine virus by RT-PCR testing, suggesting that both post vaccination rash and vesicles 
may be virally mediated. The assessment of vaccine virus in oral ulcers by RT-PCR was not conducted. 
The majority of data for the analyses of skin and mucosal events for the Phase 1 clinical program are from 
the V920-004 and V920-005 trials, as these trials have the most comprehensive and representative data 
pertaining to these events.  
In the V920-004 analysis, a comprehensive analysis of temporally-associated post-vaccination dermatitis 
was performed; this term was defined as a solicited AE preferred term of mucosal lesions or skin lesions, 
or unsolicited AE preferred term of dermatitis, petechiae, rash (including generalized, macular, papular, 
or vesicular rash), skin lesion, skin mass, or skin ulcer with onset within 56 days of vaccination; however, 
symptoms of dermatitis were captured differently across cohorts. In the V920-005 trial, skin- and 
mucosal-related AEs were defined by the solicited term of skin lesions and unsolicited terms of rash 
(including erythematous, generalized, macular, maculo-papular, papular, and vesicular rash), mouth 
ulceration, papule, and cutaneous vasculitis. 
In addition to the V920-004 and V920-005 analyses, a comprehensive analysis for rash AEs was 
presented for the V920-012 trial. In order to capture all possible cases of rash in the V920 012 trial, the 
following preferred terms were defined before database lock based on review of blinded safety data and 
included in the composite term for rash: petechiae, purpura, rash, rash generalized, rash macular, rash 
papular and rash vesicular. 
In the V920-009 trial, rash was a solicited AE, and was reported in 3.6% of V920 recipients and 3.2% of 
placebo recipients. Mouth ulceration was reported for 2.6% of subjects in both the V920 and placebo 
groups. 
In the V920-012 trial, rash and vesicular lesions were solicited AEs. The proportions of subjects with rash 
(composite term: MedDRA PT petechiae, purpura, rash, rash generalized, rash macular, rash papular, and 
rash vesicular) from Days 1 to 42 post vaccination were low – for the Combined Lots (3.8%), High Dose 
(3.8%), and placebo (1.5%) groups. The proportions of subjects with vesicular lesions from Days 1 to 42 
post vaccination similarly were low – for the Combined Lots (1.5%), High Dose (1.5%), and placebo 
(0.0%) groups. An assessment algorithm for subjects who reported AEs of rash and vesicular lesions 
involved referrals to a dermatologist for skin events and/or biopsy/fluid sampling to identify V920 via 
RT-PCR, if feasible. However in this trial, of 6 subjects with skin AEs, RT-PCR results identified V920 from 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019

a biopsy in only 1 subject with an AE of dermatitis. RT-PCR results were positive for V920 in the vesicular 
fluid of 1 subject with blisters tested. 
In the V920-005 trial, there is a heterogeneous picture regarding rash and vesical events in vaccinated 
and placebo subjects: 29.4% of all V920 recipients and 30.8% of placebo subjects experienced skin- and 
mucosal-related AEs. The most frequently reported skin- and mucosal-related AE was mouth ulceration, 
with 15.7% of subjects in the V920 group compared with 23.1% of subjects in the placebo group. Rash 
was reported for 4.9% of V920 recipients and 7.7% of placebo recipients. Two subjects experienced AEs 
assessed by the investigator to be cutaneous vasculitis. Review of clinical and histologic evidence in each 
case of reported cutaneous vasculitis by external experts determined that a systemic vasculitis process is 
not favoured. In both cases, the evidence suggested hypersensitivity reaction, and in one, post-viral 
exanthem. 
Hypersensitivity Events 
Only one subject had an SAE of anaphylaxis, in the V920-010 trial, that was considered to be 
vaccine-related by the investigator and trial Sponsor. This subject developed generalized pruritus, 
urticaria, and oedema of the face and lips approximately 12 hours after vaccination. The subject 
presented the following day, was treated with steroids, and improved without hospitalization. 
Overdose 
There were no reports of overdose in the V920 trials. All V920 trials administered a single dose of V920, 
except for the V920 002 trial in which 2 doses were administered. The majority of subjects enrolled in the 
V920 trials received a single dose with the exception of 6 subjects in the V920-011 trial who were 
unintentionally vaccinated twice after attempting to enrol multiple times at several trial locations. The 
median time between vaccinations was 48 days (range: 27 to 98 days). All 6 subjects were followed for 
6 months following the second dose of V920 and no vaccine-related SAEs were reported. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory assessments were routinely collected in the Phase 1 and the V920-009 trials. Decreases in 
white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte, and neutrophil count were reported in a higher proportion of V920 
recipients compared with placebo recipients. Decreases in white blood cell, lymphocyte, and neutrophil 
count were reported commonly after vaccination with a viral vaccine. 
The events were transient, occurring a few days following vaccinations and were in toxicity grades 1-2. 
There were no associated infections reported for subjects who experienced AEs associated with 
hematologic abnormalities, and these events were not considered clinically significant, although 
theoretically can be associated with a higher risk of infection during the period of depletion. 
 In the V920-012 trial, a total of 72 subjects who experienced arthritis, arthralgia, or rash had occasional 
laboratory testing conducted. Mild elevations of C-reactive protein (CRP) were noted in 17 out of 54 
subjects. Mild to moderate elevations of ALT were also noted in 6 subjects out of 39 subjects who had 
additional CRP testing, both hinting to a mild inflammatory sign. 
Vaccine Viremia and Viral Shedding 
Vaccine viremia evaluation and viral shedding was investigated in the context of the ERA. V920 vaccine is 
a live, attenuated vaccine that is replication competent.  Shedding of V920 has been observed in urine 
and saliva of <10% adult subjects and identified in vesicles. Transmission of V920 through close personal 
contact is considered as a theoretical possibility. 
In the Phase 1 clinical program, subjects in the blinded and open-label trials were assessed for vaccine 
viremia (detection of the V920 in the blood) and viral shedding of V920 post-vaccination using real-time 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019

reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The time points for PCR testing varied 
by trial. The assay methodology is described in the efficacy section. 
The qualitative results (positive or negative for vaccine viremia) were presented for subjects who received 
2 × 107 pfu/dose V920 or higher for the Phase 1 trials, with the limitation that the sensitivities of the 
assays for detection of vaccine viremia are different and cannot be compared. The RT-PCR assay methods 
were not standardized across the trials and used different qualitative and quantitative definitions for 
detection of vaccine viremia.  
All subjects who received 2 × 107 pfu/dose of V920 or higher in the V920-001, V920-002, and V920-005 
trials had detectable vaccine viremia at some time point following vaccination. The proportions of subjects 
with vaccine viremia decreased over time, and all vaccine viremia resolved by Day 14 post-vaccination in 
the V920-001 and V920-005 trials. For the V920-002 trial, 3 subjects (30.0%) each in the 2 × 107 
pfu/dose and 1 × 108 pfu/dose V920 groups still had detectable vaccine viremia at Day 7 
post-vaccination, with no other time points tested in this trial. The V920-004 trial had the highest number 
of subjects (n = 408) tested for vaccine viremia, and of these subjects, 80 (20%) had detectable viremia 
at 1 or more time points following vaccination. In this trial, a similar number of subjects had RT-PCR 
testing performed in both the 2 × 107 pfu/dose and 1 × 108 pfu/dose V920 groups, but a higher proportion 
of subjects (62.2%) who received the 1 × 108 pfu/dose V920 had vaccine viremia compared with subjects 
(21.7%) who received the 2 × 107 pfu dose. In 2 × 107 pfu/dose and 1 × 108 pfu/dose V920 groups, the 
incidence of viremia peaked on Days 1 and 2 post-vaccination respectively; all vaccine viremia for 
subjects in these V920 dose groups resolved by Day 28 post-vaccination.  
In the V920 Phase 1 open-label trials, all adult subjects in the 2 × 107 pfu/dose V920 group of the Phase 
1 open-label trials had detectable vaccine viremia at some time. On Day 1, the proportions of subjects 
with vaccine viremia were 90.0%, 100.0%, and 86.7% in the V920-006, V920-007, and V920-008 trials, 
respectively. By Day 3 post-vaccination in the V920-006 and V920-008 trials, all subjects had detectable 
vaccine viremia. The proportions of subjects in the 2 × 107 pfu/dose V920 group with vaccine viremia 
decreased over time; all cases of subjects in this group resolved by Day 6 and Day 7 post-vaccination in 
the V920-006 and V920-008 trials. For the V920-007 trial, 3 adult subjects (18.8%) in the 2 × 107 
pfu/dose V920 group still had detectable vaccine viremia at Day 7 post-vaccination, with no later time 
points tested in this trial. 
In summary, vaccine viremia was commonly observed among adults vaccinated with V920, but generally 
resolved by Day 14 post-vaccination. The V920 Phase 2 and 3 trials did not assess vaccine viremia and 
viral shedding. 
Viral shedding (identification of the V920 virus in saliva and urine) was seen in a few adult subjects at low 
copy number. Shedding might also possibly occur via other body fluids than saliva or urine, such as 
semen, sweat, vesicular liquid, breastmilk, aerosol, vomit. In trial V920-012, RT-PCR evaluation on 
vesicular lesions for 2 subjects was negative, and on blisters for 1 subject was positive (687,160 
copies/mL). A viral shedding assessment was not performed for all subjects in the V920-005 trial. Per 
protocol, the shedding assessment was stopped after the first 10 subjects because all results were 
negative. Although transmission of the virus through close personal contact is a theoretical possibility, it 
is considered low risk, because of the low magnitude of shedding observed.  
Secondary transmission of V920 was not evaluated in the V920 program. 
Safety in paediatric population 
In the V920-007 trial, 20 school-age children and 20 adolescents were enrolled and vaccinated. Two 
adolescents (5.0%) withdrew early from the trial; one of the adolescents withdrew consent within 14 days 
Assessment report

following vaccination. The mean age of school-age children was 9.2 years (range: 7 to 11 years) and of 
adolescents was 14.7 years (range: 13 to 17 years). 
In the first 14 days following vaccination, solicited local AEs were reported in 7 school-age children (35%) 
and in 5 adolescents (25%); these incidence rates were comparable to those in adult subjects who 
received 2×107 pfu (9 subjects, 56%). Solicited systemic AEs were reported in 17 school-age children 
(85%) and in 19 adolescents (95%); in comparison, solicited systemic AEs were reported in 13 (81%) 
adult subjects who received 2×107 pfu. 
The majority of the solicited local TEAEs had an early onset, i.e. in the first day following vaccination, and 
all solicited TEAEs were assessed as Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity. 
Most solicited local and systemic AEs abated within 3 days (median duration ≤3 days), but the median 
duration for decreased appetite was 4.5 days. One school-age child had diarrhoea for 6 days, and 1 
adolescent had injection site swelling that lasted 9 days. Arthralgia was the only solicited TEAE that lasted 
≥14 days, with a maximum duration of 16 days in 1 adolescent. 
In the non-randomized arm of the V920-010 ring vaccination trial, there have also 194 children between 
6 - 17 years been Regarding included children in the non-randomized arm, overall, 38.2% of 194 
vaccinated children reported a solicited AE from Days 0 to 14 following vaccination. Solicited injection-site 
pain was reported for 5% of these subjects. The most commonly reported solicited systemic AEs were 
headache, fatigue, muscle pain, myalgia, and arthralgia. Most of the solicited AEs reported for children 
were mild in intensity.  
Two children had temperatures ≥38oC, and AEs of fever were reported accordingly; however, the 
intensity of these events was not assessed. 
Overall, the median duration of solicited AEs with any intensity (mild, moderate, severe) reported for 
children was 2 days (IQR: 1 to 3 days). Only one child reported a severe AE of fatigue, which had a 
duration of 4 days. 
An amendment to Expanded Access Protocol 5 (EAP5; a compassionate ring vaccination study to evaluate 
the safety of the Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) to include pregnant women (after 
the first trimester) and infants ≥6 months was approved in June 2019, and vaccinations in these 
populations began on 13 June 2019. Under this protocol amendment, vaccinated pregnant women and 
children (6 to 11 months of age) will be actively monitored for AEs by the trial sponsor through 21 days 
post-vaccination. Vaccinated pregnant women will also be followed until the end of pregnancy to assess 
the clinical status of the newborn. Once the outbreak has concluded and the database for EAP5 is cleaned 
and locked, an analysis of the impact of V920 in this outbreak will be prepared, which will include an 
evaluation of safety and efficacy. The Applicant is requested to share the safety data once the trial is 
completed and all data has been made available by the sponsor conducting EAP5 (the WHO and DRC 
Ministry of Health). As the EAP is being conducted during an active and ongoing outbreak, completion 
dates cannot be predicted at this time. 
Laboratory findings 
In school-age children and adolescents, mean changes from baseline to the end of trial in ALT, AST, and 
creatinine were small and remained within normal ranges for most subjects for the duration of the trial. 
Shifts in toxicity grade for these serum chemistry parameters were from Grade 0 at baseline to Grade 1 
or 2 post vaccination. 
Serious Adverse Events in Children 
One school-aged child and 1 adolescent  experienced Grade 2 malaria during the trial; these SAEs were 
considered by the investigator not to be related to vaccination.

Viremia and shedding 
Vaccine viremia and shedding were more pronounced in school-age children and adolescents vs. adults. 
All school-age children and adolescents were viraemic on Day 1. At Day 7, V920 RNA was detectable in 
saliva in 7 school-age children (35%) and in 14 adolescents (88%), and in a urine sample from 1 
school-age child (11%).  The shedding in saliva did not correlate with an increased incidence of oral 
symptoms. 
Overall results 
V920-007 was the first trial, which evaluated safety in school-children and adolescents. Vaccination with 
V920 was tolerated well in both age groups with comparable AE reporting and the incidences of solicited 
symptoms were comparable to the frequencies adults reported in the Phase I trials. The most frequently 
reported solicited local AE across school-age children and adolescents was injection site pain and the most 
frequently reported systemic AEs included headache, fatigue, and pyrexia. Arthralgia was reported by 18 
% of subjects and one adolescent reported with 16 days duration. Shedding in salvia and urine up to 7 
days were reported only in children that long. 
Safety in Special Populations 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded from V920 trials; however, several women were 
incidentally found to be pregnant after vaccination and the pregnancy outcomes were reported. Among 
the trials with available data, the majority of pregnancies occurred in the V920-011 trial. Pregnancies 
reported with onset within 2 months after enrolment or vaccinations were followed to resolution. A total 
of 261 pregnancies were reported during the trial. Of these pregnancies, 107 pregnancies were reported 
as occurring within 2 months after enrolment or vaccination: 58 resulted in live births (55 full term and 3 
pre-term), 30 early pregnancy losses, and 9 still births ≥20 weeks of gestation. 
Regarding early pregnancy losses, their rate has been shown 3-fold higher in the V920 vaccinees 
compared to the deferred control group. Data are not sufficient to draw any conclusion at this stage. Lack 
of reliable data on background rates of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in the affected regions also 
makes a contextual assessment of the data challenging.  
No data is available for subjects who were breastfeeding in the V920 clinical program. 
Immunocompromised subjects 
The safety of V920 has not been assessed in severely immunocompromised individuals. In individuals 
with a defect in innate or adaptive immunity, the live-replicating vaccine could theoretically produce a 
more active or long-lasting infection with the vaccine virus than normal, the outcome of which could be a 
severe illness. It is not known what effects V920 may have on individuals with the following conditions: 
•  Severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g., severe combined 
immunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia and AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection. A CD4+ 
T-lymphocyte count threshold for use in asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals has not been 
established.  
•  Current immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. This does not 
include individuals who are receiving topical or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids (e.g., for 
asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy). 
•  Blood dyscrasias, leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the 
hematopoietic and lymphatic systems. 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019  
Page 97/117 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
• 
Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of 
the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated. 
Immunocompromised individuals may also not respond as well as immunocompetent individuals to V920 
and could be more likely to develop EVD than immunocompetent individuals in case of exposure to Zaire 
Ebola virus despite appropriate vaccine administration. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies have been conducted. As there are no data on co-administration of Ervebo with 
other vaccines, the concomitant use of Ervebo with other vaccines is not recommended and an interval of 
at least 4 weeks should be respected between the 2 administrations of live-virus vaccines.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
None of the discontinuations due to an AE or death were considered to be related to study vaccine by the 
investigator. 
Post marketing experience 
V920 is not currently authorised or marketed in any country. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Phase I trials 
Eight Phase 1 trials were conducted (V920-001, -002, -003, -004, -005, -06, -007, and -008) in the US 
and Canada, Europe (Switzerland and Germany), and regions of Africa not affected by the outbreak 
(Gabon and Kenya). The Phase 1 program included 795 adult subjects who received V920 as a single dose 
ranging from 3 × 103 pfu/dose to 1 × 108 pfu/dose, whereas 197 adult subjects who received a single 
dose of 2 × 107 pfu or higher of V920. 30 subjects received dosages 3x106 pfu, 1x107 pfu, or 1x108 pfu 
compared to placebo twice. 135 subjects received placebo in the Phase 1 blinded trials. 
The incidence of reported solicited AEs was higher in the V920 dose groups compared to placebo. Solicited 
local AEs were reported more frequently with increasing dosages. After the second dosage, less AEs were 
reported compared to the first administration. Unsolicited AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities 
were more often reported from subjects vaccinated with V920 compared to placebo. 
Within the blinded Phase I trials a heterogeneous reporting rate of 15% to 50% for arthralgia was 
observed. Reporting of arthralgia was not dosage dependent but occurred more frequently in V920 
recipients as compared to placebo recipients. Because of this reporting the event of arthralgia should be 
followed up in the PSUR. 
Myalgia, objective fever, and subjective fever were reported with a higher incidence in the V920 groups 
compared to placebo groups but showing no clear dose-dependent trend.  
Solicited injection-site AE was most commonly reported in all Phase I trials. Solicited and unsolicited AE 
were mostly considered as Grade 1 or Grade 2 and were abated within 3 days. 
The majority of data for the analyses of skin and mucosal events for the Phase 1 clinical program are from 
the V920-004 and V920-005 trials, as these trials have the most comprehensive and representative data 
pertaining to these events.  
Rash was characterized in a variety of ways including generalized rash (2.3%), vesicular rash (0.5%), 
dermatitis (0.3%), or cutaneous vasculitis (0.01%) in clinical trials. In 6 out of 18 subjects tested, V920 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019  
Page 98/117 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
virus was detected in rashes (described as dermatitis, vesicles or cutaneous vasculitis lesions) suggesting 
a virally mediated process post-vaccination.  
Vaccine viremia (based upon RNA detection) was commonly observed among adults vaccinated in the 
Phase 1 trials but generally resolved by Day 14 post-vaccination. The V920 Phase 2 and 3 trials did not 
assess vaccine viremia and viral shedding. Viremia was more often detected after administration of both 
higher dose groups, i.e.  2x107pfu and 1x108pfu compared to 3x106 pfu and in children compared to 
adults. It appears to be less common after Day 3 post-vaccination and is rarely found at 7 or 14 days. 
Shedding of V920 has been observed in urine and saliva at low incidence and low copy number in adult 
subjects (<1000 copies/mL) and identified in vesicles in 4 out of 10 adult patients. Viral shedding was of 
higher magnitude and more frequent in children and adolescents compared to adults. Transmission risk is 
considered very low. This theoretical safety concern has been adequately addressed in the section 4.4 of 
the SmPC. As a precaution, subject should avoid close association with and exposure of high-risk 
individuals to blood and bodily fluids for up to 6 weeks following vaccination. Individuals who develop 
vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. 
Transient decreases in in counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white blood cells have also been 
observed, but no increased risk of infection has been reported. Those events could be theoretically 
associated to a higher risk of infection during the period of depletion. The mechanism leading to this 
variation in the white blood count is poorly understood. The Applicant is requested to follow up in PSURs 
on any additional data will be collected from completed and ongoing trials to document and/or explain the 
transient decreases in counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white blood cells after vaccination and 
their repercussions for the safety of vaccinees.  
V920-007 was the first trial to evaluated safety in 20 schoolchildren and 20 adolescents. Vaccination with 
V920 was tolerated well in both age groups with comparable AE reporting and the incidences of solicited 
symptoms were comparable to the frequencies reported by adults in the Phase I trials. 
Phase 2/3 clinical trials 
The total number of adult subjects vaccinated with V920 in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials was 
2,171 and in open label trials was 13,826. A total of 15,398 subjects received the ≥2×107 pfu dose and 
15,050 participants had the exact dose of2x107 pfu; the blinded placebo-controlled studies incorporated 
1,712 vaccinated with ≥2x107 pfu. Of these, 1,397 adults had the intended dose of 2x107 pfu. The phase 
2/3 placebo-controlled randomized trials (Protocol 009 and Protocol 012) included 498 African subjects of 
Liberia and 1,061 subjects in US, Spain and Canada.  
The frequencies listed in the SmPC are based on the higher frequency reported in either of the Phase 2/3 
placebo-controlled randomized trials, Protocol 009 and Protocol 012.  
The most commonly reported solicited systemic AEs in all the Phase 2 and 3 trials were headache, 
pyrexia, fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia and these types of AEs were also consistent with those 
commonly reported (≥4 subjects in one or more vaccination groups) in the V920-012 trial, which was 
conducted in North-America and Europe. The increased frequency of the reports of headache, pyrexia, 
fatigue, and myalgia in the V920-009 trial compared with the V920-012 trial may be explained by the 
events being solicited in the former trial only. Arthralgia (or joint pain), which was solicited in both trials, 
was more frequently reported in V920-012 than V920-009. The extremely low report of pyrexia in the 
V920-010 trial is likely confounded by the provision of antipyretics to the subjects in this trial. Subjects 
were provided acetaminophen or ibuprofen at the time of vaccination. The increased frequency of 
reporting of all the solicited AEs in the V920-011 trial may be due to the open-label nature of the trial 
(compared with V920-009 and V920-012), and perhaps increased reporting of these events among 
subjects who were not affected by the Ebola outbreak compared with subjects in V920-010. The 
V920-011 trial also provided a diary card to subjects for the recording of post-vaccination events.

The V920 trials were designed and conducted by various sponsors, which led to heterogeneous study 
designs that did not prove conducive for integrating AE data. As a result of the differences, the AE 
datasets could not be properly harmonized and integrated to provide a meaningful and interpretable 
integrated dataset, which is acceptable given the context. An assessment of AEs or SAEs from the 
double-blind trials versus the open-label trials is not meaningful because the study vaccine that the 
subject received in the open-label trials was known by all and therefore, the assessment of AEs and SAEs 
in the open-label trials lacks objectivity due to reporting bias. Therefore, to preserve the integrity of the 
SAE analysis for V920 administered at the 2 × 107 pfu dose, only the SAEs from the double-blind trials 
were integrated. For a comprehensive evaluation of SAEs in the V920 clinical program, SAEs from all 
trials, including the open-label trials, were also summarized and the results are clinically meaningful 
without data integration. 
Arthritis is an AE of special interest and therefore, events of arthritis were assessed in all Phase 2 and 3 
clinical trials. The proportions of subjects who reported arthritis in the V920-009 and V920-010 trials were 
very low (only 2 subjects [0.4%] in V920-009 and none in V920-010). As noted, arthritis was not solicited 
in the V920-010 trial, and only a subset of subjects (201) were interviewed regarding joint symptoms at 
Week 2 post-vaccination in the V920-009 trial. Both factors may have impacted the reporting of arthritis 
AEs. In the V920-011 and V920-012 trials, in which arthritis was a solicited systemic AE, the proportions 
of subjects who reported this event were comparable (3.2% and 3.7%, respectively). Oligo-arthritis and 
rash appearing in the second week occur at a low incidence and are most of the times mild-moderate in 
severity and self-limited. Less than 5% of subjects in most trials (including pivotal Phase 3 safety study 
012 with specific surveillance for joint and skin adverse events) experienced arthritis and/or rash, which 
in some cases may be vesicular or purpuric. In some cases, viral RNA has been identified by 
immunohistochemistry and/or RT-PCR in the joints or skin/vesicles. In one Phase 1 study the incidence of 
oligoarthritis was as high as 22%. The reason for this difference is not well understood. In an open label 
safety study in Sierra Leone (011-STRIVE), 17% complained of joint pains in the interval 5-28 days after 
vaccination. The arthritis and skin events appear to reflect direct viral injury and inflammation and do not 
have an immunopathological basis which could suggest an autoimmune disease. A subset of subjects in 
005 and 012 continued to have persistent joint symptoms at the completion of the study (follow-up was 
up to 2 years). The 005 also reported several subjects with recurrent joint events following initial 
resolution of the events. This current study did not specifically analyse recurrences of joint events.  
The risk of shedding via fluids in vesicles is considered very low in healthy people in line with the results 
from phase I studies but has not been investigated in immunocompromised patients. The risk of shedding 
via saliva or urine is considered low. Transmission of V920 through close personal contact is accepted as 
a theoretical possibility. As a precaution, vaccine recipients should avoid close contact with and exposure 
of high-risk individuals to blood and bodily fluids for at least 6 weeks following vaccination. High-risk 
individuals include: 
• 
Immunocompromised individuals and individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy (see 
section above),  
•  Pregnant or breast-feeding women (see section 4.6), 
•  Children <1 year of age. 
Individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal 
to minimize the risk of possible transmission of V920 through open vesicles. For the same reason, 
individuals administered V920 should not donate blood for at least 6 weeks post-vaccination. 
As there are no data on co-administration of V920 with other vaccines, the concomitant use of V920 with 
other vaccines is not recommended.  
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019

Non-intramuscular administration errors can lead to adverse events and delayed absorption in general as 
the subcutaneous space is less vascular. Administration of V920 is intended for intramuscular 
administration; there is no data on subcutaneous administration and subcutaneous administration is not 
recommended.  
There is currently limited evidence related to the safety of V920 during pregnancy in humans. Pregnant 
women were excluded from clinical trials. However, a total of 261 women were incidentally found to be 
pregnant after vaccination. Although administration of V920 (5.28 x 107 pfu/animal) showed no effect in 
rats studies on mating, fertility, or foetal development following either single or multiple doses, the risk of 
adverse effects from administering the live virus vaccine to pregnant women remains unknown given the 
limited amount of clinical data available. Lack of reliable data on background rates of pregnancy and 
neonatal outcomes in the affected regions also makes a contextual assessment of the data challenging. 
However, more data will be available post-authorisation from the ring vaccination trial that is ongoing in 
DRC at the moment. 
Severely immunocompromised subjects were excluded from V920 clinical trials. The largest number of 
HIV-positive individuals (with unknown immune compromise status) were enrolled in the V920-009 trial 
and exposed to V920. These subjects had a consistent safety profile compared with HIV-negative 
individuals, although the small numbers limit the conclusions that may be drawn. 
The following safety topics should be considered as risk of the product to be discussed in the PSUR: 
•  Arthritis: The frequency of arthritis in vaccinees may vary according to factors such as gender, age, 
and  personal  and/or  family  history  of  this  condition.  The  frequency  of  long-lasting  arthritis  after 
vaccination is poorly known as well as the frequency of disabilities associated with the condition. New 
data related to arthritis should be discussed through the PSURs. 
• 
• 
 ‘Hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis)’ is considered a rare but severe adverse reaction following 
vaccination.  
‘Risk  of  infection  due  to  transient  decreases  in  counts  of  lymphocytes,  neutrophils  and  total  white 
blood  cells’:  those  are  theoretically  associated  to  a  higher  risk  of  infection  during  the  period  of 
depletion.  The  mechanism  leading  to  this  variation  in  the  white  blood  count  is  poorly  understood. 
Based  on  a  limited  number  of  observations,  no  increased  incidence  of  infectious  episodes  was 
observed after vaccination. Yet, more evidence is required to fully characterise the risk.  
•  Behavioural  changes  regarding  usage  of  other  preventative  Ebola  preventative  measures:  This 
concern  in  addressed  in  the  SmPC  and  PL,  section  4.4.  However,  any  indication  of  preventable 
exposure should be explored when reviewing breakthrough cases. Any relevant publication should be 
discussed.   
•  Safety and reduced efficacy in immunocompromised hosts: Information is missing for this group which 
was not part of the clinical development plan. 
•  Cases of Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): Given the nature of the vaccine and the contexts of its use, 
it is likely that the vaccine will be used in PEP. The knowledge on the use of the vaccine in PEP is very 
limited and any new data should be discussed in the PSURs.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Two trials in the V920 clinical program, V920-007 and V920-010, enrolled and vaccinated 234 paediatric 
subjects 6 to <18 years of age. Based on the limited safety database the safety profile of V920 was similar

for children-adolescents 6 to 17 years of age compared to adults except for vaccine viremia and viral 
shedding, which were higher in children.   
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety  
The safety of Ervebo was assessed based on data collected in 15.398 healthy adults receiving ≥2x107 pfu 
in 8 phase 1 studies and 4 phase 2/3 studies. The chosen dosage of 2 x 107 pfu V920 was well tolerated 
by the enrolled subjects. The trials were not designed or conducted by the various sponsors with the final 
objective of data integration among them. The datasets could not be properly harmonized and integrated 
to provide a meaningful and interpretable integrated dataset. The integrated safety database consists of 
only serious adverse events (SAEs) data from 7 double-blinded studies (Phase 1 studies V920-001, 
V920-002, V920-003, V920-004, V920-005 phase 2/3 studies, V920-009, and V920-012). SAEs data 
across the randomized blinded trials were more uniformly collected and thus data integration was 
feasible.  
A review of disposition and demographic data for subjects who received V920 at a dose of 2 × 107 pfu or 
higher demonstrated a comparable profile from all V920 doses combined except for the AESIs discussed 
(e.g. arthritis and rash). 
The most common injection-site adverse reactions were injection-site pain (70.3%), swelling (16.7%) 
and erythema (13.7%). The most common systemic adverse reactions reported following vaccination 
with Ervebo were headache (36.9%), pyrexia (34.3%), myalgia (32.5%), fatigue (18.5%), arthralgia 
(17.1%), nausea (8.0%), chills (6.3%), arthritis (3.7%), rash (3.6%), hyperhidrosis (3.2%), and 
abdominal pain (1.4%). In general, these reactions were reported within 7 days after vaccination, were 
mild to moderate in intensity, and had short duration (less than 1 week). Arthralgia was generally 
reported in the first few days following vaccination, was mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved within 
one week after onset. 
In 2015, a safety signal was reported in a phase 1 study regarding AEs Arthritis and joint problems and 
skin rashes. Arthritis (arthritis, joint effusion, joint swelling, osteoarthritis, monoarthritis or polyarthritis) 
was generally reported within the first few weeks following vaccination. Occurrence of Arthritis in 
V920-005 was 24/102 (23.5%: Very common) as compared to V920-012 results of 29/791 (3.7%: 
Common). The majority of arthritis reactions were mild to moderate and generally resolved within several 
days to weeks after onset. Few subjects experienced severe reactions or recurrent or prolonged joint 
symptoms lasting up to 2 years following vaccination, the longest follow-up period. In a small number of 
subjects, the vaccine virus was recovered from joint effusion samples, suggestive of a virally mediated 
process post-vaccination. The results of phase 3 study V920-012 show that female sex and a positive 
medical history of arthritis have statistically significant associations in multivariate analyses of composite 
arthritis terms with a 2.2- to 2.8-fold higher risk of post-vaccination arthritis and 95% confidence interval 
(CI) lower bounds of 1.1 and 1.3, respectively. 
Rash was characterized in a variety of ways including generalized rash, dermatitis, vesicular rash or 
cutaneous vasculitis. In a small number of subjects, the vaccine virus was detected in rashes (described 
as dermatitis, vesicles or cutaneous vasculitis lesions) suggesting a virally mediated process 
post-vaccination. There was no evidence of systemic vasculitis. 
In the Clinical Development Plan, the safety of Ervebo has not been established in pregnant or 
breastfeeding women, in newborns, in immunocompromised patients and in HIV+ patients.  
A total of 261 women were incidentally found to be pregnant after vaccination but this data is too limited 
to be able to draw clinically meaningful conclusions. Even though animal studies do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity, as a precautionary measure, it is preferable 
to avoid the use of Ervebo during pregnancy and pregnancy should be avoided for 2 months following 
Assessment report

vaccination. Nevertheless, considering the severity of EVD, vaccination should not be withheld when there 
is a clear risk of exposure to Ebola infection.  
It is unknown whether Ervebo is secreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants from 
breast-feeding by vaccinated mothers cannot be excluded.  
A total of 234 children and adolescents 6 to <18 years of age were enrolled and received the clinical dose, 
showing a similar tolerability profile as adults.  
536 (8.4%) of eligible, consented subjects were ≥65 years of age in the V920-010 trial, making the safety 
dataset in this population limited. Although it is not expected that the safety will differ in subject >65 
years of age compared to younger subjects, as a precaution this limitation of the trials has been reflected 
as a warning in the SmPC. 
The following safety topics should be followed up in post-marketing setting and reported in the PSUR: 
•  Risk of infection due to transient decreases in counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white 
blood cells.  
•  Arthritis 
•  Safety and reduced efficacy in immunocompromised hosts 
•  Hypersensitivity (including anaphylaxis) 
•  Behavioural changes regarding usage of other Ebola preventive measures 
•  Cases of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context 
of a MA: 
•  HIV-infected individuals will be further evaluated in study V920-015 (ACHIV); 
•  vaccine viremia and shedding will be further evaluated in different trials post-authorisation (study 
V920-015 (ACHIV), study V920-016 (PREVAC)); 
• 
safety in pregnant and lactating women will be further evaluated in the ongoing Compassionate 
ring vaccination study to evaluate the safety of the Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD) because the product is not yet licensed in any country, hence the 
EBD will be the IBD. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine the forthcoming 
Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
Ebola Zaire Vaccine (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP, live attenuated) is a live recombinant replication-competent 
viral vaccine produced using Vero cells. The virus consists of a Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) backbone 
(Indiana strain) with a deletion of the VSV-G envelope glycoprotein replaced with the surface glycoprotein 
of the Zaire Ebolavirus (ZEBOV) Kikwit 1995 strain. The envelope glycoprotein is the immunogen that 
confers immunity against Ebolavirus. The vaccine virus is produced in Vero cells. The harvested virus 
from the cell-culture is purified and stabilized by resuspending in 10 mM Tris pH 7.2 and rice-derived 
recombinant human serum albumin 2.5 g/L. 
The applicant declared that recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus strain Indiana with a deletion of the 
VSV envelope glycoprotein replaced with the Zaire Ebola Virus Kikwit 1995 strain surface glycoprotein has 
not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the European Union.   
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers the active substance recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis 
Virus strain Indiana with a deletion of the VSV envelope glycoprotein replaced with the Zaire Ebola Virus 
Kikwit 1995 strain surface glycoprotein included in Ervebo to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ervebo (Ebola Zaire Vaccine 
(rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP, live)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active 
substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU and 
since it is to be approved under a conditional marketing authorisation. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is an acute systemic febrile syndrome caused by Ebola filovirus with case 
fatality ranging from 30% to 90% and an incubation period of 2 to 21 days. The disease-to-infection ratio 
is generally described as being 1:1 but some EVD asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic infections are 
increasingly described. The highest case fatality has historically been observed with Zaire Ebola virus 
(70%), the virus causing the 2014 outbreak in West Africa.  
The pathogenesis of EVD is characterized by an intense inflammatory process, impaired haemostasis and 
capillary leaks, with mortality resulting from septic shock and multi-organ system failure. Initial signs and 
symptoms are nonspecific (fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue) and may mimic other more common 
conditions such as malaria. After one week, haemorrhagic manifestations can appear in more than half of 
the patients. EVD progresses with gastrointestinal symptoms, internal and external bleeding, and in some 
cases, rash and neurologic involvement. The varying spectrum of Ebola virus disease severity, and the 
presence of asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases, is increasingly acknowledged.  
Fruit bats, often hunted for food such as Hypsignatus genus, are considered the reservoir for Ebola and 
Marburg filoviruses. However, this could only be confirmed for Marburg and the precise reservoir for Ebola 
virus remains unknown. Close contact with infected animals in the rainforest, often used as ‘bushmeat’ 
such as antelope or monkeys, is a likely route of transmission. Twenty-five EVD outbreaks have been 
recorded so far. The largest outbreak before the 2014 outbreak was in Uganda in 2000 to 2001, with 425 
cases. In more than half of outbreaks, the animal origin of the virus could not be shown.  
Pregnant women face high mortality and a high risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. 
Ebola virus disease (EVD) is caused by infection with a filovirus of the Ebolavirus genus which includes five 
distinct species. Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo and Taï Forest ebolaviruses occur in Africa and cause serious 
illness in humans. Reston ebolavirus occurs in the Philippines and only causes asymptomatic illness in 
human. The first three, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Zaire ebolavirus, and Sudan ebolavirus have been 
associated with large outbreaks in Africa. The virus causing the 2014–2016 West African outbreak 
belongs to the Zaire ebolavirus species. Although the ebolavirus species associated with the current 
outbreak in the DRC is the same species that caused the earlier outbreak (Zaire ebolavirus), genetic 
differences between the viruses suggest the two outbreaks are not linked. 
Ebola viruses are highly transmissible by direct contact of a healthy person’s broken skin or mucous 
membranes with organs, blood or other bodily fluids (e.g. urine, saliva, sweat, faeces, vomit, breast milk, 
and semen) of living or dead infected persons, any soiled material (e.g. soiled clothing, bed linen, gloves, 
protective equipment and medical waste), or semen from men who recovered from EVD. Most cases are 
caused by human to human transmission. The risk of transmission from contaminated surfaces is low and 
can be reduced even further by appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures.  
The virus can persist in immunologically privileged sites such as semen, breast milk, ocular (eye) fluid, 
and spinal column fluid of recovered patients. The exact duration of persistence and the magnitude of risk 
of transmission through survivors is currently unknown, but some body fluids have tested positive by 
RT-PCR for longer than 9 months.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
No treatment or vaccine is currently authorised for Ebola virus disease in the EU, but several 
investigational vaccines and treatments based on blood, immunological or antiviral therapies are in 
clinical development or recommended for emergency use. 
The additional most promising vaccine under development is the 2-dose Ad26-ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo 
heterologous vaccine regimen developed by Janssen. Two Ebola vaccines were authorised for national use 
only in Russia and China in 2017, but limited information is available on clinical data. 
Regarding therapeutics, preliminary data from the ongoing PALM trial in DRC showed that RGN-EB3 and 
mAb114 seem more promising among four investigational agents (ZMapp, remdesivir, mAb114 and 
REGN-EB3). For details of other investigative products see section 2.1.5. 
Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival, however based on 
limited data available from 27 patients treated in US and EU hospital still almost 20% of them died.  
Prevention of EVD is currently accomplished through education on avoidance of risk factors, quarantine of 
infected individuals and the use of personnel protective equipment (PPE). 
Given the lack of specific treatment currently available and the fact that EVD is a highly infectious disease 
associated with a high mortality rate (25 to 90%), there is clearly an urgent unmet medical need.   
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is a single phase III multicentre, cluster-randomized, open-label 
study comparing 1 dose (≥2x107 PFU) of V920 administered in immediate (D0) vaccination (n=4539, 51 
clusters) vs. V920 administered in delayed (D21) vaccination (n=4557, 47 clusters) in adults defined as 
contacts or contacts-of-contacts around a confirmed Ebola index case, as well as children ≥6YOA enrolled 
in later stages of the trial. The trial was conducted in Guinea and Sierra Leone between March 2015 and 
January 2016 towards the end of the outbreak. 
The objective of the trial was to assess the efficacy in the prevention of EVD caused by Ebola Zaire virus 
by comparing immediate versus delayed ring vaccination. 
The ring vaccination strategy increased the possibility of the study to yield robust data on the efficacy of 
the vaccine despite the low and declining incidence of EVD by involving small pockets of high-risk 
individuals with high EVD incidence. It has also proven to be effective in outbreak management of 
infectious diseases with relatively low reproduction number (R0, i.e. the number of cases one case 
generates on average over the course of its infectious period, in an otherwise uninfected population), as 
is the case for Ebola Zaire (R0 of 1.5-2.5, compared to R0 of 2-5 for HIV and R0 of 12-18 for measles). 
The main evidence of immunogenicity submitted is derived from eight Phase 1 dose-finding studies, and 
from two Phase 2 and 3 trials conducted during the time of the 2014 to 2016 Ebola outbreak in at-risk 
populations in Liberia (V920-009) and Sierra Leone (V920-011) as well as in populations not at risk in US, 
Canada and Spain (V920-012). In all 3 trials, immune responses after a single nominal dose of 2 × 107 pfu 
V920 were measured up until Month 12 (V920-009 and V920-011) or Month 24 (V920-012) 
post-vaccination in terms of anti-GP antibodies (GP-ELISA) and neutralizing antibodies (PRNT) with 
validated assays. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary analysis to estimate vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed EVD among all vaccinated 
subjects in the immediate vaccination arm after 10 days from vaccination compared to all subjects who 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019  
Page 108/117 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
were eligible and consented on the Day 0 visit in the delayed vaccination arm resulted in a vaccine efficacy 
estimate of 100% (unadjusted 95% CI: 63.5% to 100%; adjusted 95% CI: 14.4% to 100%). This VE 
estimate is based on 10 EVD cases (in 4 rings) identified prior to vaccination in 1,429 subjects of the 
delayed arm (46 rings) compared to 0 cases in 2,108 vaccinated subjects in the immediate arm (51 
rings). The secondary analysis to estimate vaccine efficacy against laboratory-confirmed EVD among all 
CCCs in the immediate vaccination arm versus all CCCs in the delayed vaccination arm resulted in a 
vaccine efficacy estimate of 64.6% (95% CI: -44.2% to 91.3%) p=0.3761.  
After vaccination, there were no EVD cases amongst the 5,837 vaccinated individuals in all 117 rings, 10 
days or more post-vaccination, both randomized (immediate, delayed) and non-randomized, during the 
study period of 84 days. Analysis to assess vaccine efficacy against death from laboratory confirmed EVD 
supports the primary analysis. 
The seroresponse rate defined as a 2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 EU/mL for GP-ELISA (primary 
endpoint) in a non-endemic population of adults 18-65 years of age was 98.6% (95% CI: 97.4%–99.3%) 
at any time point and 92.1% (95% CI: 88.4%–94.9%) at Month 24. GP-ELISA GMT peaked at Day 28 
post-vaccination with 1262 EU/mL (95% CI: 1168.9–1362.6) and declined by approximately 25% at 
Month 24 post-vaccination to 920.3 EU/mL (95% CI: 820.4–1032.3). PRNT GMT peaked at Month 18 
post-vaccination with 276.9 (95% CI: 248.3–308.9) and remained stable through Month 24 
post-vaccination (V920-012 trial conducted in US, Canada, EU). 
Sustained but lower seroresponse rate and GMT were observed in endemic populations. The seroresponse 
rate defined as a 2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 EU/mL for GP-ELISA (primary endpoint) in an 
endemic population of adults 18-65 YOA was 93.8% (95% CI: 91.1%–95.8.3%) at any time point and 
80.1% (95% CI: 76.2%–83.7%) at Month 12. GP-ELISA GMT peaked at Day 28 post-vaccination with 
994.7 EU/mL (95% CI: 915.0–1081.3) and declined by approximately 33% at Month 12 post-vaccination 
to 661.4 EU/mL (95% CI: 613.2–712.4). PRNT GMT peaked at Day 28 post-vaccination with 116.8 (95% 
CI: 106.0–128.8) and remained stable through Month 12 post-vaccination (V920-009 trial conducted in 
Liberia). 
The immunogenicity data indicate a robust and sustainable immune response in healthy adults at risk and 
not at risk of infection through to two years post-vaccination. Overall, non-clinical primary 
pharmacodynamic studies provided adequate evidence that V920 induces robust immune responses upon 
vaccination with a single dose and provides protection after EBOV challenge in NHP. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Uncertainties remain as to the actual level of protection, the duration of protection and the type of 
protection (pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis) given the methodological peculiarities of the ring 
vaccination design and the exceptional circumstances experienced during a declining Ebola epidemic. 
Formally, from a statistical perspective the trial was not successful at interim but randomized enrolment 
was stopped thereafter. As the primary analysis is based on the interim data, the trial hence overall could 
not demonstrate a statistically significant VE. VE estimates may lack precision as they are based on few 
cases from a limited number of clusters and the time window for case ascertainment was short. Bias on 
various levels, including possible imbalance between arms with respect to detection, reporting and 
transmission control measures as well as selection bias at enrolment due to possible unblinding on a 
larger scale, cannot be excluded. The impact and direction of potential biases cannot be assessed. 
However, no cases of EVD were observed in any subject ≥ 10 days after vaccination, and the clear-cut 
outcome of the study somehow mitigate potential uncertainties. More data is expected during the 
post-authorisation phase also from the current ongoing outbreak in DRC where the vaccine was deployed.   
Assessment report

The exact duration of protection by a single IM administration of Ervebo in humans is currently not known. 
The ring trial had only a study period of 84 days. Loss of protection in the longer term after vaccination 
was suggested by a NHP study. Given the gap of knowledge about specific mechanism of protection and 
protective titres, it is uncertain whether the duration of protection associated with V920 can be deduced 
from immunogenicity data only. Need for and timing of a booster dose is currently not known. 
Considering the Ebola incubation time of up to 21 days (even if most infections become symptomatic in 
8-10 days), ring vaccination by design might have included both pre-and post-exposure vaccination. It 
might well be that the VE data have been gathered in a mixed population of pre- or post-exposed 
individuals. The data thus might represent a combined pre-and post-exposure effect of the vaccine.  
It is unknown from breakthrough cases whether the vaccine would prevent mortality/morbidity and/or 
viral persistence in sanctuary sites such as the eye or brain. 
There is limited data to conclude on the use in pregnant women and in immunocompromised individuals.   
There are no data on co-administration with other vaccines, hence co-administration is not 
recommended.  
It is uncertain whether the vaccine would protect against genetic variants of the Zaire Ebolavirus as it is 
currently not known which epitopes are responsible for the immune responses. Also, within the same 
species of Zaire ebolavirus, genetic differences between viruses have been reported. Nevertheless, while 
the vaccine construct is based on the Zaire Kikwit strain, it was shown that V920 was effective against the 
Zaire Makona strain that circulated in West Africa in 2014-2016, and preliminary data suggest efficacy 
against the strain currently circulating in the DRC. 
A correlate of protection is currently not known. The immunogenicity data indicate a sustainable humoral 
immune response induced by Ervebo through two years (V920-012 study). Antibodies measured by 
ELISA tend to decline slight to moderate, but continuously through two years. This effect is less visible in 
antibodies measured by PRNT. In lack of an immune correlate or of a biomarker for protection, sustained 
long-term efficacy cannot be directly inferred from the persisting antibody titres. Long-term 
immunogenicity and the need/optimal time point for a booster dose are currently unknown.  
The evaluation of immunogenicity was based on Ebola-GP-specific IgG antibodies measured by ELISA and 
neutralizing antibodies by PRNT assay. No conclusive analysis of CMI responses after vaccination is 
currently available. See section 3.7.2 for uncertainties with respect to manufacturing process details. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety of V920 was assessed based on data collected in 15.398 healthy adults receiving ≥2x107 pfu 
in 8 phase 1 studies and 4 phase 2/3 studies. The trials were conducted in different geographical regions 
(e.g., Africa only vs Europe/North America only) and under different circumstances (e.g., outbreak vs 
non-outbreak, community vs clinical settings), and used varying methods for data collection (e.g., phone 
contact with subjects vs in-person visits). A total of 234 children and adolescents 6 to <18 years of age 
were enrolled and received the clinical dose. Also, 536 (8.4%) of eligible, consented subjects were ≥65 
years of age in the V920-010 trial. A total of 261 women were incidentally found to be pregnant after 
vaccination.  
The most common injection-site adverse reactions were injection-site pain (70.3%), swelling (16.7%) 
and erythema (13.7%). The most common systemic adverse reactions reported following vaccination 
with V920 were headache (36.9%), pyrexia (34.3%), myalgia (32.5%), fatigue (18.5%), arthralgia 
(17.1%), nausea (8.0%), chills (6.3%), arthritis (3.7%), rash (3.6%), hyperhidrosis (3.2%), and 
abdominal pain (1.4%). In general, these reactions were reported within 7 days after vaccination, were 
mild to moderate in intensity, and had short duration (less than 1 week). Arthralgia was generally 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019  
Page 110/117 
Classified as public by the European Medicines Agency 
 
 
 
reported in the first few days following vaccination, was mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved within 
one week after onset. 
In the Phase I studies as well in the Phase II/III studies arthritis and arthralgia were recorded with a 
reporting rate of 15% to 50%. Partially these events were recorded up to 62 days or even left unresolved 
after the end of the trial. 
Rash was characterized in a variety of ways including generalized rash, dermatitis, vesicular rash or 
cutaneous vasculitis. In a small number of subjects, the V920 vaccine virus was detected in rashes 
(described as dermatitis, vesicles or cutaneous vasculitis lesions) suggesting a virally mediated process 
post-vaccination. There was no evidence of systemic vasculitis. 
Transient decreases in counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white blood cells in the first 3 days 
following vaccination have been observed very commonly in Phase 1 studies. These events generally 
resolved after the first week post-vaccination. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The trials were not designed or conducted by the various sponsors with the final objective of data 
integration among them. The integrated safety database consists of only serious adverse events (SAEs) 
data from 7 double-blinded studies (Phase 1 studies V920-001, V920-002, V920-003, V920-004, 
V920-005 phase 2/3 studies, V920-009, and V920-012). SAEs data across the randomized blinded trials 
were more uniformly collected and thus data integration was feasible.  
The precise magnitude and duration of viremia and shedding remain unknown. Transmission of vaccine 
virus was not evaluated in clinical trials. A theoretical possibility of transmission of the vaccine virus 
through contacts of vaccinated persons exists. Therefore, a minimum 6-weeks period is currently 
recommended as the time required for vaccinees to avoid blood donation and contact with blood and 
bodily fluids as well as at risk individuals.  
Safety in pregnant/breastfeeding women is not established. Some data is available but is not sufficient to 
draw conclusions; therefore, vaccination should be avoided during pregnancy and pregnancy should be 
avoided for 2 months after vaccination. More information should become available from the expanded 
access protocol in DRC. Nevertheless, considering the severity of EVD, vaccination should not be withheld 
when there is a clear risk of exposure to Ebola infection.  
The safety of Ervebo has not been assessed in severely immunocompromised individuals. In individuals 
with a defect in innate or adaptive immunity, the live-replicating vaccine could theoretically produce a 
more active or long-lasting infection with the vaccine virus, the outcome of which could be a severe 
illness. More data is expected post-authorisation from planned studies.  
Vaccine virus RNA was found in blood, saliva and urine, synovial fluid (in 3 subjects who had arthritis 
TEAEs) and vesicles (n=4/10) of vaccinated adults, although at low incidence and low copy number in 
most adult subjects. Transmission through close personal contact is a theoretical possibility but is 
considered to be low risk because of the low magnitude of shedding. Transmission of vaccine virus was 
not evaluated in clinical trials. See section 3.7.2 for uncertainties with respect to manufacturing process 
details.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The proposed indication for Ervebo is for active immunization of individuals 18 years of age or older to 
protect against Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) caused by Zaire Ebola virus. 
The observed vaccine effect against EVD and EVD death is representing a true clinical benefit. The 
evidence for vaccine efficacy is adequate, based on the comprehensive analysis sets and the fact that 
none of the 5,837 vaccinated subjects developed EVD 10 days or more post-vaccination, regardless of the 
allocated groups. As EVD has an incubation time of 2-21 days (mainly 8-10 days), vaccination could occur 
during the incubation time and these EVD cases could be included in the primary efficacy analysis despite 
the 10-day censor period. Thus, the efficacy data may cover both pre-and post-exposure prophylactic 
effect of the vaccine. V920 induces robust immune responses upon vaccination with a single dose, and 
provides protection after EBOV challenge in NHP. Together with the demonstration of immunogenicity in 
human, these NC data suggest that Ab might be important in the prophylactic protection in humans. Since 
the viruses that cause EVD are located mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, the use of Ervebo within the 
European context is considered to be very specific, and is understood to be mainly aimed for health care 
workers deploying to an Ebola outbreak region (who would be vaccinated prior to embarking on such 
mission) or for ring vaccination around an ‘imported’ EVD case (where people at risk of being infected 
would need to be identified).  
Vaccination was generally associated with a reactogenicity profile common to most vaccines. However, 
several forms of arthritis were commonly observed, most of which resolved within days or weeks of onset, 
but some became chronic (lasting up to 2 years following vaccination, the longest follow-up period) and 
it is currently unclear if or when they will resolve.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The documented protective efficacy of Ervebo against EVD and EVD death is considered to be of high 
clinical benefit, but the exact magnitude and duration of vaccine-induced protection is currently still not 
fully known. Thus, it remains of utmost importance that vaccinees continue to adhere to Ebola control 
measures. The protection observed within a ring vaccination context in an outbreak region might also be 
less robust as compared to a blinded, placebo controlled trial, mostly because efficacy could only be 
evaluated in a short time window, therefore until new data is assessed it is important that the vaccine is 
considered for used in individuals at immediate risk of infection.  
Based on the available safety data it can be concluded, that there is no safety concern related to the use 
of V920 in the target population (adults >18 YOA at risk of infection). The occurrence of chronic arthritis 
in a limited number of subjects was considered to be clinically relevant and the occurrence of mild to 
moderate reactogenicity was considered of limited clinical relevance. Only limited safety data were 
collected in pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. This does not allow final conclusion 
on the safe use in this special populations.

The occurrence of binding and neutralizing antibodies against the Ebola Zaire GP-protein is considered to 
be relevant from an immunological point of view, but the clinical relevance in terms of magnitude and 
duration of protection is uncertain, as there is no immune correlate of protection. Nevertheless, the 
immunogenicity data indicate a sustained humoral immune response induced by Ervebo through two 
years post-vaccination.  
No clinical data on long term protection are available.  
Conditional marketing authorisation 
Data on certain manufacturing process details are incomplete at time of opinion, specifically on the 
confirmation of the validated status of the active substance (AS) and finished product (FP) manufacturing 
process. In addition, comprehensive comparability data demonstrating that the commercial product 
manufactured at the Burgwedel site has not yet been completed to confirm the representativeness of the 
material used in the clinical trials. Additional AS and FP process validation/process performance 
qualification (PPQ) data and a comparability assessment will be provided post-approval. Furthermore, 
data are expected post-approval to: complete qualification of the master/working cell banks substrate 
used for production to include also tests for specified viruses; provide additional qualification data for the 
critical reagent used in the identity test (quality control release test for AS and FP) and introduce an 
additional in-process test for residual host cell protein, which will provide an additional control of 
impurities in the absence of a fully validated process.  
As the above requested data on product manufacture are not available at the time of opinion, a 
conditional marketing authorisation was proposed by the CHMP during the assessment, after having 
consulted the applicant. 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning conditional 
marketing authorisations, as it aims at the prevention of a life-threatening disease. Ebola Virus Disease 
(EVD) is an acute systemic febrile syndrome caused by Ebola filovirus with case fatality ranging from 30% 
to 90%. In addition, the product is to be used in emergency situations in response to public health threats 
duly recognised by the World Health Organisation. Currently an Ebola outbreak is ongoing in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been recognised by WHO as a PHEIC in August 2019, and 
Ervebo is being deployed in the region in the context of an expanded access protocol in collaboration with 
WHO.  
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. Studies are underway to 
complete the manufacturing process details. Detailed plans have been submitted in the dossier 
regarding scheduling of process validation data and the feasibility of completion of all proposed 
specific obligations has been assessed by the CHMP based upon the applicant’s justification. Based 
on the applicant’s plans and documentation, it is expected that data to fulfil all SOs will be 
submitted by end October 2020. 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as the data available indicate that Ervebo is highly 
efficacious in preventing EVD. There are no vaccines or therapeutics currently authorised for 
prevention or treatment of EVD.   
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required. The current data set indicate but do not permit a definitive 
conclusion that: the AS process is sufficiently validated to be capable of producing AS batches of 
Assessment report  
EMA/606159/2019

adequate and consistent quality;  that the commercial product is fully comparable to the clinical 
batches used in the trials (produced at IDT Biologika and West Point); that the viral safety testing 
conducted on the master cell/ working cell substrates used for production is complete for two 
specified viruses and that a critical reagent used in the identity test has been fully qualified. 
Specific obligations to collect these data have been set accordingly. Since for biological products 
a combination of specifications and process control/validation is per definition deemed essential to 
guarantee product quality, it cannot be excluded that high variability of AS lots (due to insufficient 
process control) may result in differences in impurities or other properties or characteristics such 
as vaccine stability. However, additional routine testing (for two key specified impurities) in order 
to have an acceptable level of quality control of commercial product has been introduced and a 
test for a third key impurity, residual host cell protein is expected to be implemented shortly 
post-approval (specific obligation). With respect to viral safety testing of the cell banks substrates 
used for production, the applicant has provided reassurance on the viral safety of the cell bank 
system using a combination of specific tests and metagenomics analysis, however additional 
testing is required to complete the testing. Similarly, additional qualification data are required to 
complete the information on the critical reagent used for the identity assay to fully confirm the 
absence of any false-positive results.   
Regarding vaccine potency however, any final product lots that comply with the currently 
proposed FP specifications, and that are formulated using AS lots that comply with the AS 
specifications, are expected to behave similarly in terms of potency as the clinical batches. Despite 
the potential risks described above with respect to manufacturing, the commercial process is 
identical to the clinical lot process (also with respect to scale) and as such, when executed in line 
with the described control strategy, the process is expected to yield AS of the same quality. All 
clinical lot material produced thus far has been shown to be of adequate and consistent quality. 
The current specifications (including potency) and acceptance limits proposed for the MAA are 
deemed appropriate and sufficiently justified (taking into account results from clinical batches).  
The additional data on the manufacturing process details of Ervebo are expected to be submitted 
by the end of October 2020. Based on all the above it would not be considered appropriate to 
withhold a highly beneficial vaccine considering the severity of EVD and the international context 
of the ongoing PHEIC, since the demonstrated benefits in the current emergency setting clearly 
outweigh the risks related to the limitations of the available data concerning manufacture of this 
product.     
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Ervebo is positive provided that the conditions and obligations identified in the 
recommendation section are complied with. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Ervebo is favourable in the following indication: 
“Ervebo is indicated for active immunization of individuals 18 years of age or older to protect against 
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) caused by Zaire Ebola virus (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). The use of Ervebo 
should be in accordance with official recommendations.”  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Oral suspension. 
The suspension is pink to brown in colour. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Xaluprine is indicated for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in adults, adolescents 
and children.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Xaluprine treatment should be supervised by a physician or other healthcare professionals experienced 
in the management of patients with ALL. 
Posology 
The dose is governed by cautiously monitored haematotoxicity and the dose should be carefully 
adjusted to suit the individual patient in accordance with the employed treatment protocol. Depending 
on phase of treatment, starting or target doses generally vary between 25-75 mg/m2 body surface area 
(BSA) per day, but should be lower in patients with reduced or absent Thiopurine Methyl Transferase 
(TPMT) enzyme activity (see section 4.4).

6-mercaptopurine is metabolised by the polymorphic TPMT enzyme. Patients with little or no 
inherited TPMT activity are at increased risk for severe toxicity from conventional doses of 
mercaptopurine and generally require substantial dose reduction. TPMT genotyping or phenotyping 
can be used to identify patients with absent or reduced TPMT activity. TPMT testing cannot substitute 
for haematological monitoring in patients receiving Xaluprine. The optimal starting dose for 
homozygous deficient patients has not been established (see section 4.4).

Special populations 
Elderly 
No specific studies have been carried out in the elderly. However, it is advisable to monitor renal and 
hepatic function in these patients, and if there is any impairment, consideration should be given to 
reducing the Xaluprine dose. 
Renal impairment 
Since 6-mercaptopurine pharmacokinetics has not been formally studied in renal impairment, no 
specific dose recommendations can be given. Since impaired renal function may result in slower 
elimination of mercaptopurine and its metabolites and therefore a greater cumulative effect, 
consideration should be given to reduced starting doses in patients with impaired renal function. 
Patients should be closely monitored for dose related adverse reactions. 
Hepatic impairment 
Since 6-mercaptopurine pharmacokinetics has not been formally studied in hepatic impairment, no 
specific dose recommendations can be given. Since there is a potential for reduced elimination of 
mercaptopurine, consideration should be given to reduced starting doses in patients with impaired 
hepatic function. Patients should be closely monitored for dose related adverse reactions (see 
section 4.4). 
Switching between tablet and oral suspension and vice versa 
A tablet form of 6-mercaptopurine is also available. The 6-mecaptopurine oral suspension and tablet 
are not bioequivalent with respect to peak plasma concentration, and therefore intensified 
haematological monitoring of the patient is advised on switching formulations (see section 5.2). 
Combination with xanthine oxidase inhibitors 
Allopurinol and other xanthine oxidase inhibitors decrease the rate of catabolism of 6-mercaptopurine.  
When allopurinol and 6-mercaptopurine are administered concomitantly it is essential that only a 
quarter of the usual dose of 6-mercaptopurine is given. Other xanthine oxidase inhibitors should be 
avoided (see section 4.5).  
Patients with NUDT15 variant 
Patients with inherited mutated NUDT15 gene are at increased risk for severe 6-mercaptopurine 
toxicity, (see 4.4). These patients generally require dose reduction; particularly those being NUDT15 
variant homozygotes (see 4.4). Genotypic testing of NUDT15 variants may be considered before 
initiating 6-mercaptopurine therapy. In any case, close monitoring of blood counts is necessary. 
Method of administration 
Xaluprine is for oral use and requires redispersing (by shaking vigorously at least for 30 seconds) prior 
to dosing. 
Two dosing syringes (a 1 ml and a 5 ml) are provided for accurate measurement of the prescribed dose 
of the oral suspension. It is recommended that the healthcare professional advises the patient or carer 
which syringe to use to ensure that the correct volume is administered. 
Xaluprine may be taken with food or on an empty stomach, but patients should standardise the method 
of administration. The dose should not be taken with milk or dairy products (see section 4.5).  
Xaluprine should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after milk or dairy products. 
6-mercaptopurine displays diurnal variation in pharmacokinetics and efficacy. Administration in the 
evening compared to morning administration may lower the risk of relapse. Therefore the daily dose 
of Xaluprine should be taken in the evening. 
To assist accurate and consistent dose delivery to the stomach water should be taken after each dose of 
Xaluprine.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Concomitant use with yellow fever vaccine (see section 4.5) 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Cytotoxicity and haematological monitoring 
Treatment with 6-mercaptopurine causes bone marrow suppression leading to leucopenia and 
thrombocytopenia and, less frequently, to anaemia. Careful monitoring of haematological parameters 
should be conducted during therapy. The leucocyte and platelet counts continue to fall after treatment 
is stopped, so at the first sign of an abnormally large fall in the counts, treatment should be interrupted 
immediately. Bone marrow suppression is reversible if 6-mercaptopurine is withdrawn early enough. 
There are individuals with an inherited deficiency of the TPMT enzyme activity who are very 
sensitive to the myelosuppresive effect of 6-mercaptopurine and prone to developing rapid bone 
marrow depression following the initiation of treatment with 6-mercaptopurine. This problem could be 
exacerbated by coadministration with active substances that inhibit TPMT, such as olsalazine, 
mesalazine or sulfasalazine. Some laboratories offer testing for TPMT deficiency, although these tests 
have not been shown to identify all patients at risk of severe toxicity. Therefore close monitoring of 
blood counts is necessary. Substantial dose reductions are generally required for homozygous-TPMT 
deficiency patients to avoid the development of life threatening bone marrow suppression. 
A possible association between decreased TPMT activity and secondary leukaemias and 
myelodysplasia has been reported in individuals receiving 6-mercaptopurine in combination with other 
cytotoxics (see section 4.8). 
Immunosuppression 
Immunisation using a live organism vaccine has the potential to cause infection in 
immunocompromised hosts. Therefore, immunisations with live organism vaccines are not 
recommended. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Xaluprine is hepatotoxic and liver function tests should be monitored weekly during treatment. More 
frequent monitoring may be advisable in those with pre-existing liver disease or receiving other 
potentially hepatotoxic therapy. The patient should be instructed to discontinue Xaluprine immediately 
if jaundice becomes apparent (see section 4.8).  
Renal toxicity 
During remission induction when rapid cell lysis is occurring, uric acid levels in blood and urine 
should be monitored as hyperuricaemia and/or hyperuricosuria may develop, with the risk of uric acid 
nephropathy. Hydration and urine alkalinisation may minimize potential renal complications. 
Pancreatitis in off-label treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease 
Pancreatitis has been reported to occur at a frequency of ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10 (“common”) in patients 
treated for the unlicensed indication inflammatory bowel disease.  
Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including mercaptopurine, are at an increased risk of 
developing lymphoproliferative disorders and other malignancies, notably skin cancers (melanoma 
and non-melanoma), sarcomas (Kaposi's and non-Kaposi's) and uterine cervical cancer in situ. The 
increased risk appears to be related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression. It has been 
reported that discontinuation of immunosuppression may provide partial regression of the 
lymphoproliferative disorder. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A treatment regimen containing multiple immunosuppressants (including thiopurines) should therefore 
be used with caution as this could lead to lymphoproliferative disorders, some with reported fatalities. 
A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the risk of 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. 
Increases in chromosomal aberrations were observed in the peripheral lymphocytes of leukaemic 
patients, in a renal cell carcinoma patient who received an unstated dose of 6-mercaptopurine and in 
patients with chronic renal disease treated at doses of 0.4 – 1.0 mg/kg/day.  
In view of its action on cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 6-mercaptopurine is potentially 
carcinogenic and consideration should be given to the theoretical risk of carcinogenesis with this 
treatment.  
Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma has been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease* 
treated with azathioprine (the prodrug to 6-mercaptopurine) or 6-mercaptopurine, either with or 
without concomitant treatment with anti-TNF alpha antibody. This rare type of T cell lymphoma has 
an aggressive disease course and is usually fatal (see also section 4.8). 
*inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an unlicensed indication 
Macrophage activation syndrome 
Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a known, life-threatening disorder that may develop in 
patients with autoimmune conditions, in particular with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (unlicensed 
indication), and there could potentially be an increased susceptibility for developing the condition with 
the use of mercaptopurine. If MAS occurs, or is suspected, evaluation and treatment should be started 
as early as possible, and treatment with mercaptopurine should be discontinued. Physicians should be 
attentive to symptoms of infection such as EBV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), as these are known 
triggers for MAS. 
Infections 
Patients treated with 6-mercaptopurine alone or in combination with other immunosuppressive agents, 
including corticosteroids, have shown increased susceptibility to viral, fungal and bacterial infections, 
including severe or atypical infection, and viral reactivation. The infectious disease and complications 
may be more severe in these patients than in non-treated patients. 
Prior exposure to or infection with varicella zoster virus should be taken into consideration prior to 
starting treatment. Local guidelines may be considered, including prophylactic therapy if necessary. 
Serologic testing prior to starting treatment should be considered with respect to hepatitis B. Local 
guidelines may be considered, including prophylactic therapy for cases which have been confirmed 
positive by serologic testing. Cases of neutropenic sepsis have been reported in patients receiving 
6-mercaptopurine for ALL. 
Patients with NUDT15 variant 
Patients with inherited mutated NUDT15 gene are at increased risk for severe 6-mercaptopurine 
toxicity, such as early leukopenia and alopecia, from conventional doses of thiopurine therapy. They 
generally require dose reduction, particularly those being NUDT15 variant homozygotes (see 4.2). 
The frequency of NUDT15 c.415C>T has an ethnic variability of approximately 10 % in East Asians, 
4 % in Hispanics, 0.2 % in Europeans and 0 % in Africans. In any case, close monitoring of blood 
counts is necessary. 
Paediatric population 
Cases of symptomatic hypoglycaemia have been reported in children with ALL receiving 
6-mercaptopurine (see section 4.8). The majority of reported cases were in children under the age of 
six or with a low body mass index. 
Interactions 
When oral anticoagulants are coadministered with 6-mercaptopurine, a reinforced monitoring of INR 
(International Normalised Ratio) is recommended (see section 4.5). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Excipients  
This medicinal product contains aspartame (E951), a source of phenylalanine. May be harmful for 
people with phenylketonuria. Neither non-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess aspartame 
use in infants below 12 weeks of age. 
It also contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate and sodium ethyl parahydroxybenzoate which 
may cause allergic reaction (possibly delayed). 
This medicine contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, 
glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine. 
Long term use increases the risk of dental caries and it is essential that adequate dental hygiene is 
maintained. 
Safe handling of the suspension  
Parents and care givers should avoid Xaluprine contact with skin or mucous membrane. If the 
suspension comes into contact with skin or mucosa, it should be washed immediately and thoroughly 
with soap and water (see section 6.6). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
The administration of 6-mercaptopurine with food may decrease systemic exposure slightly but this is 
unlikely to be of clinical significance. Therefore, Xaluprine may be taken with food or on an empty 
stomach, but patients should standardise the method of administration. The dose should not be taken 
with milk or dairy products since they contain xanthine oxidase, an enzyme which metabolises 6–
mercaptopurine and might therefore lead to reduced plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine. 
Effects of mercaptopurine on other medicinal products 
Concomitant administration of yellow fever vaccine is contraindicated, due to the risk of fatal disease 
in immunocompromised patients (see section 4.3). 
Vaccinations with other live organism vaccines are not recommended in immunocompromised 
individuals (see section 4.4).  
Inhibition of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, when given with 6-mercaptopurine, has been 
reported. Monitoring of the INR (International Normalised Ratio) value is recommended during 
concomitant administration with oral anticoagulants. 
Cytotoxic agents may decrease the intestinal absorption of phenytoin. Careful monitoring of the 
phenytoin serum levels is recommended. It is possible that the levels of other anti-epileptic medicinal 
products may also be altered. Serum antiepileptic levels should be closely monitored during treatment 
with Xaluprine, making dose adjustments as necessary. 
Effects of other medicinal products on mercaptopurine 
When allopurinol and Xaluprine are administered concomitantly it is essential that only a quarter of 
the usual dose of Xaluprine is given since allopurinol decreases the rate of metabolism of 
6-mercaptopurine  via xanthine oxidase. Also other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as febuxostat, 
may decrease the metabolism of mercaptopurine and concomitant administration is not recommended 
as data are insufficient to determine an adequate dose reduction. 
As there is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (eg. olsalazine, mesalazine or 
sulfazalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme, which metabolises 6-mercaptopurine, they should be 
administered with caution to patients receiving concurrent Xaluprine therapy (see section 4.4).

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Contraception in males and females 
Evidence of the teratogenicity of 6-mercaptopurine in humans is equivocal. Both sexually active men 
and women should use effective methods of contraception during treatment and for at least three 
months after receiving the last dose. Animal studies indicate embryotoxic and embryolethal effects 
(see section 5.3). 
Pregnancy 
Xaluprine should not be given to patients who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant without 
careful assessment of risk versus benefit. 
There have been reports of premature birth and low birth weight following maternal exposure to 
6-mercaptopurine. There have also been reports of congenital abnormalities and spontaneous abortion 
following either maternal or paternal exposure. Multiple congenital abnormalities have been reported 
following maternal 6-mercatopurine treatment in combination with other chemotherapy agents. 
A more recent epidemiological report suggests that there is no increased risk of preterm births, low 
birth weight at term, or congenital abnormalities in women exposed to mercaptopurine during 
pregnancy. 
It is recommended that newborns of women exposed to mercaptopurine during pregnancy are 
monitored for haematological and immune system disturbances. 
Breast-feeding 
6-mercaptopurine has been identified in the colostrum and breast-milk of women receiving 
azathioprine treatment and thus women receiving Xaluprine should not breast-feed. 
Fertility 
The effect of 6-mercaptopurine therapy on human fertility is unknown but there are reports of 
successful fatherhood/motherhood after receiving treatment during childhood or adolescence. 
Transient profound oligospermia has been reported following exposure to 6-mercaptopurine in 
combination with corticosteroids. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. A detrimental 
effect on these activities cannot be predicted from the pharmacology of the active substance. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The main adverse reaction of treatment with 6-mercaptopurine is bone marrow suppression leading to 
leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. 
For mercaptopurine there is a lack of modern clinical documentation which can serve as support for 
accurately determining the frequency of adverse reactions. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following events have been identified as adverse reactions. The adverse reactions are displayed by 
system organ class and frequency: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon 
(≥1/1000 to < 1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to < 1/1000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be 
estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented 
in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
6-mercaptopurine is hepatotoxic in animals and man. The histological findings in man have shown 
hepatic necrosis and biliary stasis  
The incidence of hepatotoxicity varies considerably and can occur with any dose but more frequently 
when the recommended dose is exceeded.  
Monitoring of liver function tests may allow early detection of hepatotoxicity. This is usually 
reversible if 6-mercaptopurine therapy is stopped soon enough but fatal liver damage has occurred.  
9 
 
 
 
 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms and signs 
Gastrointestinal effects, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea and anorexia may be early 
symptoms of overdose having occurred. The principal toxic effect is on the bone marrow, resulting in 
myelosuppression. Haematological toxicity is likely to be more profound with chronic overdose than 
with a single ingestion of Xaluprine. Liver dysfunction and gastroenteritis may also occur.  
The risk of overdose is also increased when xanthine oxidase inhibitors is being given concomitantly 
with 6-mercaptopurine (see section 4.5).  
Management 
As there is no known antidote the blood picture should be closely monitored and general supportive 
measures, together with appropriate blood transfusion, instituted if necessary. Active measures (such 
as the use of activated charcoal or gastric lavage) may not be effective in the event of 
6-mercaptopurine overdose unless the procedure can be undertaken within 60 minutes of ingestion.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antineoplastic agents, antimetabolites, purine analogues, ATC 
code: L01BB02 
Mechanism of action 
6-mercaptopurine is an inactive pro-drug which acts as a purine antagonist but requires cellular uptake 
and intracellular anabolism to thioguanine nucleotides for cytotoxicity. The 6-mercaptopurine 
metabolites inhibit de novo purine synthesis and purine nucleotide interconversions. The thioguanine 
nucleotides are also incorporated into nucleic acids and this contributes to the cytotoxic effects of the 
active substance. 
Cross-resistance usually exists between 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The bioavailability of oral 6-mercaptopurine shows considerable inter-individual variability, which 
probably results from its first-pass metabolism. When administered orally at a dosage of 75 mg/m2 
to 7 paediatric patients, the bioavailability averaged 16% of the administered dose, with a range of 5 to 
37%.  
In a comparative bioavailability study in healthy adult volunteers (n=60), 50mg of Xaluprine oral 
suspension was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the reference 50mg tablet for AUC, but not Cmax. 
The mean (90% CI) Cmax with the oral suspension was 39% (22% - 58%) higher than the tablet 
although there was less between-subject variability (%C.V) with the oral suspension (46%) than the 
tablet (69%). 
Biotransformation 
The intracellular anabolism of 6-merpactopurine is catalysed by several enzymes to eventually form 
6-thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs), but a variety of intermediary TGNs are formed en route to the 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
TGNs. The first step is catalysed by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase yielding 
thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP). 6-mercaptopurine  is also subject to S-methylation by the enzyme 
thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), yielding methylmercaptopurine, which is inactive. However, 
TPMT also catalyses the S-methylation of the principle nucleotide metabolite, TIMP, to form 
methylthioinosine monophosphate (mTIMP). Both TIMP and mTIMP are inhibitors of phosphoribosyl 
pyrophosphate amidotransferase, an enzyme which is important in de novo purine synthesis. Xanthine 
oxidase is the main catabolic enzyme and it converts the 6-mercaptopurine into the inactive 
metabolite, 6-thiouric acid. This is excreted in the urine. Approximately 7% of an oral dose is excreted 
as unchanged 6-mercaptopurine within 12 hours after administration. 
Elimination 
The elimination half-life of 6-mercaptopurine is 90 ± 30 minutes, but the active metabolites have a 
longer half-life (approximately 5 hours) than the parent compound. The apparent body clearance is 
4832 ± 2562 ml/min/m2. There is low entry of 6-mercaptopurine into the cerebrospinal fluid.  
The main route of elimination for 6-mercaptopurine is by metabolism. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Genotoxicity 
6-mercaptopurine, in common with other antimetabolites, is mutagenic and causes chromosomal 
aberrations in vitro and in vivo in mice and rats.  
Carcinogenicity 
Given its genotoxic potential, 6-mercaptopurine is potentially carcinogenic. 
Teratogenicity  
6-mercaptopurine causes embryolethality and severe teratogenic effects in the mouse, rat, hamster and 
rabbit at doses that are non-toxic to the mother. In all species, the degree of embryotoxicity and the 
type of malformations are dependent on the dose and stage of the gestation at the time of 
administration.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Xaluprine is and what it is used for 
Xaluprine contains mercaptopurine. This belongs to a group of medicines called cytotoxics (also 
called chemotherapy). 
Xaluprine is used for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (also called acute lymphocytic leukaemia or 
ALL). This is a fast-growing disease which increases the number of new white blood cells.  These new 
white blood cells are immature (not fully formed) and unable to grow and work properly.  They 
therefore cannot fight infections and may cause bleeding. 
Ask your doctor if you would like more explanation about this disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Xaluprine 
- 
- 
Do not take Xaluprine if you are allergic to mercaptopurine or any of the other ingredients of 
this medicine (listed in section 6). 
Do not get vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine whilst you are taking Xaluprine because it 
may be fatal. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Xaluprine 
if you have been vaccinated with yellow fever vaccine 
- 
if you have kidney or liver problems, as your doctor will need to check that they are working 
- 
properly. 
if you have a condition where your body produces too little of the enzyme called TPMT 
(thiopurine methyltransferase), as your doctor may need to adjust the dose.  
if you are planning to have a baby.  This applies to both men and women.  Xaluprine may harm 
your sperm or eggs (see ‘Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility’ below).   
- 
- 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, taking Xaluprine could put you at greater risk of: 
- 
tumours, including skin cancer. Therefore, when taking Xaluprine, avoid excessive exposure to 
sunlight, wear protective clothing and use protective sunscreen with a high protection factor 
lymphoproliferative disorders 
- 
o 
o 
treatment with Xaluprine increases your risk of getting a type of cancer called 
lymphoproliferative disorder. With treatment regimen containing multiple 
immunosuppressants (including thiopurines), this may lead to death. 
A combination of multiple immunosuppressants, given concomitantly increases the 
risk of disorders of the lymph system due to a viral infection (Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders). 
Taking Xaluprine could put you at greater risk of: 
- 
developing a serious condition called Macrophage Activation Syndrome (excessive activation 
of white blood cells associated with inflammation), which usually occurs in people who have 
certain types of arthritis. 
Some patients with inflammatory bowel disease who have received 6-mercaptopurine have developed 
a rare and aggressive type of cancer called Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (see section 4, Possible 
side effects).  
Infections 
When you are treated with Xaluprine the risk of viral, fungal and bacterial infections is increased and 
the infections may be more serious. See also section 4. 
Tell your doctor before starting treatment whether or not you have had chickenpox, shingles or 
hepatitis B (a liver disease caused by a virus). 
NUDT15-gene mutation 
If you have an inherited mutation in the NUDT15-gene (a gene which is involved in the break-down 
of Xaluprine in the body), you have a higher risk of infections and hair loss and your doctor may in 
this case give you a lower dose. 
Avoid contact of Xaluprine with your skin, eyes or nose. If you accidentally get some in your eyes or 
nose, flush the area with water. 
If you are not sure if any of the above applies to you, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking 
Xaluprine. 
Children and adolescents 
Low blood sugar has sometimes been seen in children, mainly in children under the age of six or with 
a low body mass index. Talk to your child´s doctor if this happens. 
Other medicines and Xaluprine 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
In particular, tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
other cytotoxic medicines (chemotherapy) - when used with Xaluprine there is a greater chance 
of side effects, such as anaemia 
allopurinol or febuxostat (used to treat gout) 
oral anticoagulants (used to thin the blood) 
olsalazine or mesalazine (used for a bowel disorder called ulcerative colitis) 
sulfasalazine (used for rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis). 
anti-epileptic medicines such as phenytoin, carbamazepine. Blood levels of anti-epileptic 
medicines may need to be monitored and doses adjusted if necessary. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Having vaccines while you are taking Xaluprine 
If you are going to have a vaccination it is important to speak to your doctor or nurse before you have 
it.  Vaccination with live vaccines (like polio, measles, mumps and rubella) is not recommended, as 
these vaccines may give you an infection if you have them whilst you are taking Xaluprine.  
Xaluprine with food and drink 
Xaluprine may be taken with food or on an empty stomach. However, the choice of method should be 
consistent from day to day.  
Do not take Xaluprine at the same time as milk or dairy products, as they can make the medicine less 
effective.  Xaluprine should be taken at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after milk or dairy products. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Do not take Xaluprine if you are planning to have a baby without first speaking to your doctor for 
advice.  This applies to both men and women.  Xaluprine may harm your sperm or eggs.  Reliable 
contraception must be used to avoid pregnancy whilst you or your partner are taking Xaluprine.  Both 
men and women should continue to use effective contraception for at least 3 months after stopping 
treatment.  If you are already pregnant, you must talk to your doctor before taking Xaluprine.  
Xaluprine should not be handled by women who are or planning to be pregnant or breast-feeding. 
Do not breast-feed while taking Xaluprine.  Ask your doctor, pharmacist or midwife for advice. 
Driving and using machines 
It is not expected that Xaluprine will affect your ability to drive or use machines but no studies have 
been done to confirm this. 
Xaluprine contains aspartame, sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219), sodium ethyl 
parahydroxybenzoate (E215) and sucrose 
This medicine contains 3 mg aspartame (E951) in each 1 ml. Aspartame is a source of phenylalanine. 
It may be harmful if you have phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder in which phenylalanine 
builds up because the body cannot remove it properly.  
Xaluprine also contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) and sodium ethyl 
parahydroxybenzoate (E215) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).  
Xaluprine contains sucrose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some 
sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. May be harmful to the teeth. 
3. 
How to take Xaluprine 
Xaluprine should only be given to you by a specialist doctor who is experienced in treating blood 
problems.  
- 
- 
- 
When you take Xaluprine your doctor will take regular blood tests. This is to check the number 
and type of cells in your blood and to ensure your liver is working correctly. 
Your doctor may also ask for other blood and urine tests to monitor your uric acid levels. Uric 
acid is a natural body chemical, levels of which can rise while taking Xaluprine. 
Your doctor may sometimes change your dose of Xaluprine as a result of these tests. 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. The usual starting dose for adults, adolescents and children is 
between 25-75 mg/m2 body surface area each day. Your doctor will prescribe the correct dose for you. 
Sometimes the doctor may change your dose of Xaluprine for example as a result of different tests. If 
you are not sure how much medicine to take, always ask your doctor or nurse. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is important to take Xaluprine in the evening to make the medicine more effective. 
You can take your medicine with food or on an empty stomach but the choice of method should be 
consistent from day to day. You should take your medicine at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after 
having milk or dairy products. 
Your pack of Xaluprine contains a bottle of medicine, a cap, a bottle adaptor and two dosing syringes 
(a 1 ml syringe and a 5 ml syringe). Always use the syringes provided to take your medicine. 
It is important that you use the correct dosing syringe for your medicine. Your doctor or pharmacist 
will advise which syringe to use depending on the dose that has been prescribed.  
The smaller 1 ml syringe, marked from 0.1 ml to 1 ml, is for measuring doses of less than or equal to 
1 ml. You should use this one if the total amount you have to take is less than or equal to 1 ml (each 
graduation of 0.1 ml contains 2 mg of mercaptopurine).  
The larger 5 ml syringe, marked 1 ml to 5 ml, is for measuring doses of more than 1 ml. You should 
use this one if the total amount you have to take is more than 1 ml (each graduation of 0.2 ml contains 
4 mg of mercaptopurine). 
If you are a parent or care giver administering the medicine, wash your hands before and after 
administering a dose. Wipe up spillages immediately. To decrease the risk of exposure disposable 
gloves should be used when handling Xaluprine. 
If Xaluprine comes into contact with skin, eyes or nose, it should be washed immediately and 
thoroughly with soap and water. 
When you use the medicine follow the instructions below: 
1. Put on disposable hand gloves before handling Xaluprine. 
2. Shake the bottle vigorously for at least 30 seconds to ensure the medicine is well mixed 
(figure 1). 
3. Remove the bottle cap (figure 2) and push the adaptor firmly into the top of the bottle and leave in 
place for future doses (figure 3).  
4. Push the tip of the dosing syringe into the hole in the adaptor (figure 4). Your doctor or 
pharmacist will advise you of the correct syringe to use, either the 1 ml or the 5 ml  in order to 
give the correct dose.  
5. Turn the bottle upside down (figure 5).  
6. Pull the plunger of the syringe back so that the medicine is drawn from the bottle into the syringe. 
Pull the plunger back to the point on the scale that corresponds to the dose prescribed (figure 5). If 
you are not sure about how much medicine to draw into the syringe, always ask your doctor or nurse 
for advice.  
7. Turn the bottle back the right way up and carefully remove the syringe from the adaptor, holding it 
by the barrel rather than the plunger.  
8. Gently put the tip of the syringe into your mouth and to the inside of your cheek.  
9. Slowly and gently push the plunger down to gently squirt the medicine into the inside of your cheek 
and swallow it. DO NOT forcefully push down the plunger, or squirt the medicine to the back of your 
mouth or throat, as you may choke.  
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10. Remove the syringe from your mouth.  
11. Swallow the dose of oral suspension then drink some water, making sure no medicine is left in 
your mouth. 
12. Put the cap back on the bottle with the adaptor left in place.  Ensure that the cap is tightly closed. 
13. Wash the syringe with warm water and rinse well. Hold the syringe under water and move the 
plunger up and down several times to make sure the inside of the syringe is clean. Let the syringe air 
dry completely before you use that syringe again for dosing. Do not wipe dry. Store the syringe in a 
hygienic place with the medicine. 
Repeat the above for each dose as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist.  
If you take more Xaluprine than you should 
If you take more Xaluprine than you should, tell your doctor or go to a hospital immediately.  You 
may feel sick, vomit or have diarrhoea. Take the medicine pack and this leaflet with you. 
If you forget to take Xaluprine 
Tell your doctor.  Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop taking Xaluprine 
Do not stop taking your medicine unless your doctor tells you to or you may get a relapse of your 
condition. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

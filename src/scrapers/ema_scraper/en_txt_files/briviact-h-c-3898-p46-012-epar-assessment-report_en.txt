1.  Introduction 
BRIVIACT is currently approved in the EU for use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial 
onset seizures (POS) with or without secondary generalization in adults, adolescents, and children ≥2 
years of age with epilepsy. 
On 8 December 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for brivaracetam (Briviact), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of a post-authorisation measure. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
The MAH is of the opinion that no change is deemed necessary to the Briviact Product Information in 
view of the data submitted in this application. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that the study title and the number is: “A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-
Controlled, Multicenter, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Adjunctive 
Brivaracetam in Subjects (≥16 to 80 Years of Age) with Partial Seizures with or without Secondary 
Generalization, EP0083. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
T Brivaracetam was supplied as oral film-coated tablets of BRV 25mg and BRV 50mg. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH is providing a report of the final results of EP0083. EP0083 was a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy of 2 doses of brivaracetam (50mg/day 
and 200mg/day) compared with placebo as adjunctive treatment in study participants (≥16 to 80 years 
of age) with partial seizures with or without secondary generalization despite current treatment with 1 
or 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated. Participants 
completed an 8-week prospective Baseline Period, followed by a 12-week Treatment Period. After the 
Treatment Period, participants had the option to continue brivaracetam treatment in EP0085. 
Of a total of 449 randomized participants, 425 participants (94.7%) completed the study. Of these 425 
participants, 20 were <18 years of age at the start of the study: 6 in the placebo group 14 in the BRV 
treatment groups. A total of 13 participants in the BRV treatment groups completed the study. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
EP0083: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter, Parallel-Group Study 
to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Adjunctive Brivaracetam in Subjects (≥16 to 80 Years 
of Age) with Partial Seizures with or without Secondary Generalization.

Methods 
Study participants 
This was a multicenter study that included 94 enrolling sites in 7 countries.  
To be eligible to participate in this study, participants must have been between 16 to 80 years of age 
at Visit 1 with a well-characterized focal epilepsy/epileptic syndrome according to the 1989 
International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification.  
Participants must have had an electroencephalogram reading compatible with the clinical diagnosis of 
focal epilepsy within the last 5 years and a brain magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography 
scan performed within the last 2 years.  
Participants must have had at least 8 partial seizures during the 8-week Baseline Period with at least 2 
partial seizures during each 4-week interval of the Baseline Period, and at least 2 partial seizures, 
whether or not secondary generalization, per month during the 3 months preceding Visit 1.  
Additionally, the participant’s condition must have been uncontrolled while treated by 1 or 2 permitted 
concomitant AED(s).  
Participants were not eligible if they had experienced simple partial seizure nonmotor as the only 
seizure type, had exclusively experienced febrile seizures, or were being concurrently treated with LEV 
(or had taken LEV within 90 days prior to Visit 1).  
Participants were also not eligible if their seizures could not be reliably counted on a regular basis due 
to their fast and repetitive occurrence (clusters or flurries) or they had a history or presence of status 
epilepticus during the year preceding Visit 1 or during Baseline.  
Participants who had prior LEV use were enrolled during the study in such a way that a maximum of 
30% of prior LEV users in the study population was preserved over the duration of the study.  
Treatments 
The total duration of the study per study participant was 26 weeks with a maximum 16-weeks 
exposure to BRV consisting of the following study periods:  
•  Baseline Period (8 weeks)  
•  Treatment Period (12 weeks)  
•  Down-Titration Period (4 weeks)  
•  Study Drug-Free Period (2 weeks) 
• 
Transition Period (2 weeks) (required for participants participating in the LTFU study [EP0085] 
or MAP);  
Some participants were eligible for conversion to a long-term follow-up (LTFU) study (EP0085) or 
managed access program (MAP) upon completion of the Treatment Period and a 2-week Transition 
Period. In order to ensure uninterrupted treatment, BRV was provided to study participants who would 
be entering into the MAP in an open-label temporary study period. If BRV was commercially available 
upon completion of the Treatment Period and T Transition Period, the participants received BRV 
directly without entering the LTFU study (EP0085) or MAP. 
The 4-week Down-Titration Period followed by a 2-week Study Drug-Free Period served participants 
not entering the LTFU study (EP0085) or MAP.

Objective(s) 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of BRV compared with placebo (PBO) as adjunctive 
treatment in study participants (≥16 years to 80 years of age) with partial seizures with or without 
secondary generalization despite current treatment with 1 or 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). 
The secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of BRV in study participants ≥16 
years to 80 years of age. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy 
The primary efficacy variable was the partial seizure frequency per 28 days during the 12-week 
Treatment Period. 
Secondary efficacy variables were as follows:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The 50% responder rate based on percent reduction in partial seizure frequency per 28 
days from Baseline to the 12-week Treatment Period  
Percent reduction in partial seizure frequency per 28 days from Baseline to the 12-week 
Treatment Period  
Categorized percent reduction in partial seizure frequency per 28 days from Baseline to the 
12-week Treatment Period  
All seizure frequency (partial, generalized, and unclassified epileptic seizures) per 28 days 
during the 12-week Treatment Period. Due to the few participants <18 years of age in each 
treatment group (6, 9, and 4 participants in the PBO, BRV 50mg/day, and BRV 200mg/day 
groups, respectively) this analysis was not possible. There were no participants with 
generalized seizure and only 1 participant with unclassified seizure at Baseline (Table 
4.5.P); therefore, the seizure frequency results for all seizures would have been nearly the 
same as the results for partial seizures. 
Seizure freedom (partial, all epileptic seizure) during the 12-week Treatment Period  
Time to nth (n=1, 5, 10) partial seizure during the 12-week Treatment Period. Due to the 
few participants <18 years of age in each treatment group (6, 9, and 4 participants in the 
PBO, BRV 50mg/day, and BRV 200mg/day groups, respectively), the data would have been 
too sparse for a Kaplan-Meier analysis for this endpoint. 
Safety 
The primary safety variables were: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
Incidence of TEAEs leading to study withdrawal 
Incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) 
The other safety variables were: 
Changes in clinical laboratory tests parameters (blood chemistry [biochemistry], 
hematology, urinalysis)  
Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters and findings

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Changes in vital signs (systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP], and 
pulse rate) 
Changes in body weight 
Physical examination  
Neurological examination  
Mental status  
Psychiatric status  
The safety variable during the open-label temporary period was the incidence of TEAEs, as reported 
spontaneously by the study participant or observed during the temporary period for providing BRV. 
Sample size 
A total of 569 study participants between 16 to 80 years were screened and there were 122 screen 
failures. Of the 449 randomized participants, 425 participants (94.7%) completed the study.  
Overall, 20 participants <18 years of age started the study: 6 in the PBO group, 10 in the BRV 
50mg/day group, and 4 in the BRV 200mg/day group. A total of 17 participants (85.0%) completed 
the study and 3 participants (15.0%) discontinued the study: 2 participants (33.3%) in the PBO group 
(due to adverse event [AE] and lost to follow up) and 1 participant (10.0%) in the BRV 50mg/day 
group (due to “other”) (Table 2‒1).  
Of the 20 participants who started the Treatment Period, 18 participants (90.0%) completed the 
Treatment Period and 17 of these completers (85.0%) entered and completed the Transition Period. 
Neither of the 2 study participants who discontinued the Treatment Period entered the Down-Titration 
Period. 
Disposition and discontinuation for study participants <18 years of age comprising the RS during the 
Double-blind Period, is summarized in Table 2‒1.

Results 
Recruitment 
First study participant enrolled: 22 Aug 2017. Last study participant completed: 30 June 2022 
Baseline data 
Overall, the mean age of participants comprising this paediatric subset was 16.5 years (range: 16 to 
17 years) and half of the participants (10 participants [52.6%]) were in the <17 years age category. 
The mean age of participants in the PBO group was 16.8 years; the mean age of participants in BRV 
treatment groups was 16.3 years.  
All 19 study participants <18 years of age were Asian and the majority (18 participants [94.7%]) were 
not of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.  
Overall, the mean duration of epilepsy for participants at Baseline was 9.03 years (range: 0.4 to 16.5 
years), and the mean age at onset of the first seizure was 7.90 years (range: 0.2 to 16.7 years), both 
of which were similar for the BRV 50mg/day and 200mg/day treatment groups; however, the mean 
duration of epilepsy was shorter in the PBO group (6.93 years vs 9.79 and 10.48 years for the BRV 
50mg/day and 200mg/day treatment groups, respectively) and the mean age at time of first seizure 
was older in the PBO group (10.24 years vs 7.15 and 6.08 years for the BRV 50mg/day and 
200mg/day treatment groups, respectively).  
All 19 participants exhibited localization related epileptic syndrome, with the majority (13 participants 
[68.4%]) in the symptomatic category, a trend which was consistent with the placebo and BRV 
50mg/day treatment groups; however, in the BRV 200mg/day group, 2 of the 4 participants (50.0%) 
were in the cryptogenic category. Overall, 3 participants (15.8%) had epileptic syndrome further 
classified as generalized, all of which were idiopathic. All participants had POS, as required by the 
inclusion criteria for this study.  
Some participants had more than 1 type of POS seizure: overall, 12 participants (63.2%) experienced 
complex partial seizures, and 9 participants each (47.4% each) experienced partial evolving to 
secondary generalized seizures and simple partial. Of those who experienced simple partial seizures, 
the majority (8 participants [42.1%]) exhibited motor symptoms. Two participants (10.5%) also 
experienced generalized seizures. 
All 19 participants <18 years of age were taking at least 1 AED at study entry, most commonly 
valproate (7 participants [36.8%]), carbamazepine (6 participants [31.6%]), and phenobarbital (4 
study participants [21.1%]). There were no notable differences between the PBO and BRV all groups. 
Efficacy results 
The MAH provided descriptive summary tables for the subset of participants <18 years of age: 
• 
The primary efficacy variable was the partial seizure frequency per 28 days during the 12-
week Treatment Period. The percent reduction in the 28-day adjusted POS frequency over 
PBO was 35.2% and 59.8% in the BRV 50mg/day and BRV 200mg/day groups, 
respectively (Table 2-2).

• 
• 
• 
• 
For the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the 50% responder rate for POS frequency in the 
PBO group was lower (16.7%) compared with the BRV 50mg/day group and the BRV 
200mg/day group (44.4% and 75.0%, respectively), (Table 2-3). 
For another key secondary efficacy endpoint, the median percent reduction in POS 
frequency from Baseline to the Treatment Period was lower in the PBO group (12.2%) 
compared with the BRV 50mg/day and BRV 200mg/day groups (49.5% and 68.3%, 
respectively) (Table 2-4). 
For categorized reductions in POS frequency from Baseline, larger proportions of 
participants in the BRV 50mg/day and BRV 200mg/day groups showed 75% to <100%, 
50% to 75%, and 25% to <50% reductions compared with the PBO group (Table 2-5). 
All participants in the BRV treatment groups and 5 participants (83.3%) in the PBO group 
completed the Treatment Period; no participant achieved seizure freedom (from all 
seizures or from POS) during the Treatment Period.

Safety results 
• 
Overall, 3 study participants (50.0%) in the PBO group and 8 participants (61.5%) in the 
BRV all group reported at least 1 TEAE (Table 2-5). One participant each (16.7% each) in 
the PBO group reported TEAEs that led to discontinuation and permanent withdrawal of 
IMP. Overall, 1 participant (16.7%) in the PBO group and 6 participants (46.2%) in the 
BRV all group reported TEAEs considered by the Investigator to be related to the IMP 
(Table 2-6). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
There were no serious TEAEs, severe TEAEs, TEAEs requiring a dose change, or deaths in 
participants <18 years of age during the study. 
In the BRV all group, the most commonly reported TEAEs were somnolence and weight 
decreased (each 3 participants [23.1%]), followed by pyrexia, malaise, and sinus 
arrhythmia (each 2 participants [15.4%]); all other PTs were reported by 1 participant 
each. In the PBO group, each PT was only reported by 1 study participant. 
The majority of TEAEs were mild in intensity. 
In the PBO group, 1 participant (16.7%) reported a total of 3 TEAEs (GGT increased, ALT 
increased, and weight increased) that were considered related to IMP by the Investigator. 
In the BRV all group, 6 participants (46.2%) reported a total of 13 TEAEs considered 
related to IMP by the Investigator, most commonly somnolence (3 participants [23.1%]) in 
the BRV all group. All other TEAEs considered related to IMP by the Investigator were 
reported by no more than 1 study participant in either BRV treatment group. 
One participant in the PBO group reported TEAEs of ocular hyperemia and epilepsy that led 
to permanent discontinuation of IMP and the study; there were no discontinuations in the 
BRV treatment groups. 
No clinically relevant differences between treatment groups were observed for any changes 
from Baseline in hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, or ECGs. No potential 
drug-induced liver injury events were reported during the study. No safety signals were 
identified.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted a report of the results of Study EP0083: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-
Controlled, Multicenter, Parallel-Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Adjunctive 
Brivaracetam in Subjects (≥16 to 80 Years of Age) with Partial Seizures with or without Secondary 
Generalization. 
Twenty participants were between 16-18 years of age at the start of the study: 6 in the placebo group 
14 in the BRV treatment groups. A total of 13 participants in the BRV treatment groups completed the 
study. 
The safety profile of the 13 study participants <18 years of age who received BRV treatment and 
completed the EP0083 study was consistent with the established safety profile of BRV. No new safety 
concerns were identified in these participants.  
The PK data were not summarized for participants <18 years of age due to the small size of the BRV 
treatment groups (9 and 4 participants in BRV 50mg/day and BRV 200mg/day groups, respectively). 
According to the MAH, the PK results for participants <18 years of age were consistent with those 
observed in BRV studies with participants >18 years of age.

The MAH is of the opinion that no change is deemed necessary to the Briviact Product Information in 
view of the data submitted. This is agreed. The descriptive results of the current study do not impact 
the current benefit-risk balance of BRV and no evidence of new safety concerns was found. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
The results of EP0083 are being submitted in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 
1901/2006 (The Paediatric Regulation). The results of the current study do not impact the current 
benefit-risk balance of BRV and no evidence of new safety concerns was found. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

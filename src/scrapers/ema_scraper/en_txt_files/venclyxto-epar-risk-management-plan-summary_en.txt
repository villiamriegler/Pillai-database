Part VI  Summary of the Risk Management Plan
Summary of risk management plan for Venclyxto (venetoclax)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Venclyxto.  The RMP 
details important risks of Venclyxto, how these risks can be minimized, and how 
more information will be obtained about Venclyxto's risks and uncertainties 
(missing information).
Venclyxto's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Venclyxto 
should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Venclyxto should be read in the context of all this 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-
language summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report 
(EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Venclyxto's RMP.
I  The Medicine and What it Is Used For
Venclyxto is authorized for the treatment of
CLL:
 Patients with previously untreated CLL in combination with obinutuzumab.
 CLL in combination with rituximab in adult patients who have received at
least one prior therapy.
 CLL in the presence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who
are unsuitable for or have failed a B cell receptor pathway inhibitor; or
 CLL in the absence of 17p deletion or TP53 mutation in adult patients who
have failed both chemoimmunotherapy and a B cell receptor pathway
inhibitor.
(See SmPC for the full indication)

AML
 Adult patients with newly-diagnosed AML in combination with a
hypomethylating agent who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.
It contains venetoclax as the active substance and it is given by mouth.
Further information about the evaluation of Venclyxto's benefits can be found in 
Venclyxto's EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine's webpage.

II  Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or 
Further Characterize the Risks
Important risks of Venclyxto, together with measures to minimize such risks and 
the proposed studies for learning more about Venclyxto's risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals;
Important advice on the medicine's packaging;

 The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine's legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary.  These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Venclyxto is not yet 
available, it is listed under "missing information" below.
II.A  List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Venclyxto are risks that need risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
taken.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Venclyxto.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet 
and needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected 
(e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B  Summary of Important Risks
The SmPC was used for the CLL and AML indications.  Only major differences 
between the CLL and AML risk minimization measures are pointed out in the 
table below.  Otherwise, only sections of the SmPC are presented.
Important identified risk:  Tumor lysis syndrome
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Because CLL cells are essentially 'addicted' to 
BCL-2 for survival and are exquisitely sensitive to 
venetoclax, an on-target pharmacological effect 
can cause rapid reduction in size of tumor 
(debulk) and may pose a risk of TLS.  TLS could 
also be a risk in AML, as primary AML cells have 
also been shown in preclinical studies to be 
highly sensitive to venetoclax, either alone or in 
combination with azacitidine.
The risk is more among subjects who have high 
tumor burden.  Also, subjects with renal 
dysfunction or splenomegaly may be at added 
risk.  These risk factors are not unique to 
venetoclax.  They are consistent with that 
reported in literature, e.g., patients with bulky 
disease (including elevated white blood cell 
[WBC] count in patients with CLL), renal 
dysfunction, and baseline elevations in uric acid

Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities
are at higher risk (Blum 2011).
In a study involving 772 chemotherapy treated 
patients with AML, factors significantly associated 
with increased risk of clinical and laboratory TLS 
included elevated WBC (≥ 25 - 75 × 109/L), uric 
acid (> 7.5 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (≥ 1 -
4 × ULN) and creatinine (> 1.4 mg/dL) 
(Montesinos 2008).
Routine risk minimization measures:
Posology and method of administration, including 
prophylactic measures for TLS, are described in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC (CLL and AML).
Warnings and precautions for TLS are listed in 
section 4.4 of the SmPC (CLL and AML).
Interaction with other medicinal products is 
described in section 4.5 of the SmPC (CLL and 
AML).
TLS is described in section 4.8 of the SmPC (CLL 
and AML).
Other routine risk minimization measures:
 Prescription only medicine
 Use of treatment should be initiated and 
supervised by specialists
 Packaging design and language to facilitate 
adherence to the dose titration schedule
 Pack size and package leaflet
Additional risk minimization measures:
 Distribution of DHPC in European countries 
(CLL only)
 Distribution of patient card in European 
countries (CLL only)
Additional pharmacovigilance activities
Study P22-907:  Cross-sectional health care 
provider survey study to evaluate effectiveness of 
the revised SmPC and DHPC (CLL only).
Study P22-905:  Cross-sectional survey study to 
evaluate effectiveness of the patient card (CLL 
only).
Important identified risk:  Neutropenia
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine
Risk is based on suspected BCL-2 mechanism-
based toxicity with a BCL-2 inhibitor (venetoclax) 
(Leverson 2015).
Risk factors and risk 
groups
Risk minimization
measures
In CLL, risk factors for neutropenia include older 
age, poor performance status, advanced disease, 
low baseline blood cell counts, low nutritional 
status, and prior treatment with 
myelosuppressive chemotherapies (Lyman 2005).  
The population included in venetoclax studies has 
risk factors consistent with that described in 
literature.
In AML, the target population, in general, has a 
high risk for neutropenia.  In AML studies, the 
average age of patients are above 70 years of 
age.  In these patients, there are no particular 
risk factors or groups that contribute further to 
the risk of neutropenia.
Routine risk minimization measures:
Posology and method of administration are 
described in section 4.2 of the SmPC (CLL and 
AML).
Warnings and precautions for neutropenia are 
listed in section 4.4 of the SmPC (CLL and AML).
Neutropenia is listed as a very common adverse 
reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC (CLL and 
AML).
Other routine risk minimization measures:
 Prescription only medicine.
 Use of treatment should be initiated and 
supervised by specialist
 Package leaflet
Important identified risk:  Serious infection

risk to the medicine
Risk factors and risk 
groups

measures
CLL:
Lymphopenia and neutropenia are on-target 
effects of venetoclax.  Although their role in the 
pathogenesis of serious infections cannot be 
ruled out, to date attribution of serious infections 
to cytopenia has not been established.
AML:
AML patients have a high background rate of 
neutropenia and are more susceptible to 
infections.
Risk factors for the development of serious 
infection in CLL patients include age, decreased 
immunoglobulin levels, neutropenia, treatment 
with more than one line of chemotherapy, clinical 
stage at diagnosis, IgVH mutation status, high 
serum creatinine concentration, advanced 
disease stage, previous anti-neoplastic therapy, 
refractoriness to fludarabine-based therapy, high 
serum β2-microglobulin level, low serum albumin 
level and a low granulocyte count (Anaissie 1998, 
Molteni 2005, Francis 2006).  All patients with 
AML are at risk of infection and patients with 
poor-prognosis cytogenetics and low hemoglobin 
(< 10) and platelet count (< 20,000 cells/µL) at 
presentation have been reported to amongst the 
most high risk (Merkel 2013).  The population 
studied in the venetoclax development 
programme is consistent with that described in 
literature.
Routine risk minimization measures:
Posology and method of administration are 
described in section 4.2 of the SmPC (CLL and 
AML).
Supportive measures for infections associated 
with neutropenia are described in section 4.4 of 
the SmPC (CLL and AML).
Observed infections and infestations are 
tabulated in section 4.8 (CLL and AML).
Other routine risk minimization measures:
 Prescription only medicine
 Use of treatment should be initiated and 
supervised by specialist
 Package leaflet

groups
Risk minimization
measures
The pro-apoptotic mechanism of action for 
venetoclax is consistent with anticipated 
embryotoxicity.  The wide distribution of Bcl-2 in 
the developing embryo (pre- and post-
implantation) suggests that many immature cells 
require a death repressor protein, and 
pharmacological perturbation of these anti-
apoptotic proteins (with drugs such as 
venetoclax), can alter embryo development.  This 
is evidenced by studies that have demonstrated 
that knockout or knock down of Bcl-2 family 
proteins can adversely affect embryo growth and 
development (LeBrun 1993, Novack 1994, 
Boumela 2011).

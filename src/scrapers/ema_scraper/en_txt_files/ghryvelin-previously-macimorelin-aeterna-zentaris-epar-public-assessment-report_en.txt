2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is a product for the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults. 
2.1.1.  Epidemiology  
In Europe, data on incidence rates are scarce in GH deficiency (GHD).  
The estimated average incidence rate for AGHD in Denmark (Stochholm et al., 2006) was 1.90 (95%CI, 
1.77–2.04) in males, and 1.42 (95%CI, 1.31–1.54) in females, both per 100,000, and with an average of 
1.65 (95%CI, 1.57–1.75) per 100,000 for the whole population. 
This is slightly higher than the published incidence rates for France (1.2 per 100,000) (Sassolas et al., 
1999), and data published by The Growth Hormone Research Society (1.0 per 100,000) (Carroll et al., 
1998).  
2.1.2.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The most common causes of AGHD include a history of childhood-onset growth hormone deficiency, 
hypothalamic/pituitary diseases, tumors (e.g. pituitary adenoma, carniopharyngioma, non-pituitary 
intracranial tumors), head trauma, pituitary haemorrhage/ infection, surgery or irradiation to the 
hypothalamic/pituitary areas. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
GHD in adult life is associated with increased fat mass, particularly distributed in the truncal region, 
reduced lean mass, osteopenia, an adverse lipid profile, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, impaired 
fibrinolysis, altered cardiac structure and function, reduced exercise capacity, and reduced quality of life 
Current published guidelines recommend that evaluation of AGHD be based on clinical findings, medical 
history and using an appropriate GH stimulation test (GHST) for biochemical confirmation (Ho et.al, 
2007). The exception is with patients with ≥ 3 pituitary hormone deficiencies and low serum IGF-I levels 
< -2 standard deviation scores (SDS) in the appropriate clinical context or in patients with 
congenital/genetic GHD, where the diagnosis of AGHD can be made without requiring stimulatory GH 
testing. Otherwise, 2 independent GHST are recommended before making this rare diagnosis. The 
presence of a low IGF-I increases the likelihood that the diagnosis is correct. However, normal IGF-I does 
not exclude GHD. 
All GH stimulation tests are based on the concept that a pharmacological agent stimulates pituitary GH 
secretion, with peak GH levels detectable by timed frequent serum sampling after administration of the 
stimulus. The insulin tolerance test, the combined arginine-GH-releasing hormone (ARG-GHRH) test, and 
the glucagon test are validated GHST in the adult.  
The insulin tolerance test (ITT) is currently considered the “gold standard” test for evaluation of AGHD, 
but requires adequate hypoglycaemia (blood glucose <40 mg/dL) for interpretability of the results. In 
patients in whom an ITT cannot be performed (contraindicated in patients with ischemic heart disease or 
seizures, and in the elderly), the glucagon stimulation test (GST) is a safe alternative and has been 
assessed against the ITT in evaluating GH reserve. The ARG-GHRH test is essentially the arginine test 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 8/89 
 
 
 
 
 
with improved diagnostic accuracy by combining it with a potent priming agent (a GHRH analogue) in one 
test, but GHRH is not widely available.  
All GHST have limitations with regard to performance characteristic (sensitivity, specificity and/or 
reproducibility) (Molitch et.al, 2011). Dependency of results on aging, BMI and/or gender may also be an 
issue. Testing for confirmation of AGHD should only be performed if there is a high pre-test probability, 
and with the intention to treat if the diagnosis is confirmed.  
2.1.4.  Management 
Once  the  diagnosis  of  AGHD  is  established,  GH  replacement  therapy  (subcutaneous  injection  of 
somatropin/ recombinant human growth hormone) is usually initiated by an experienced endocrinologist, 
in particular in patients with severe GHD.   
About the product 
Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is a potent, orally active growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) that is 
intended for AGHD testing, by measuring the stimulated GH level after an oral dose. 
The claimed indication for Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris was for evaluating the pituitary gland secretion of 
growth hormone (GH) in response to an oral dose of the product in adults. 
The indication approved by the CHMP was for the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults. 
The recommended single dose of the reconstituted suspension is 500 micrograms macimorelin per kg 
body weight.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant sought scientific advice from the CHMP in 2015. This was a follow-up to advice that was 
given to the original sponsor of the product in 2007. 
The advice related to quality, non-clinical development and clinical issues including design of the pivotal 
study, cut-off points for the growth hormone stimulation tests and statistical acceptance criteria. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as granules for oral suspension in sachets containing 60 mg of 
macimorelin (as acetate) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: lactose monohydrate, colloidal anhydrous silica, crospovidone type A, saccharin 
sodium dihydrate and sodium stearyl fumarate. 
The product is available in LDPE/Alu/LDPE/paper sachets as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of macimorelin acetate is 
2-amino-N-[(2R)-1-[[(1R)-1-formamido-2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]amino]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1-oxopropan-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 9/89 
 
 
 
 
 
2-yl]-2-methylpropanamide-acetate corresponding to the molecular formula C28H34N6O5. It has a 
molecular mass of 534.6 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure. The ratio of the free base to acetate is in the range of 0.8 
– 1.1 equivalents. 
The chemical structure of macimorelin acetate was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS), two dimensional exchange 
spectroscopy (2D-EXSY), elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and 
ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. 
The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning 
Electron Microscopy (SEM) and a wet dispersion method for determination of particle size distribution. 
The active substance is an off-white to pale yellow, hygroscopic, amorphous powder. Macimorelin acetate 
is highly soluble in buffered aqueous solutions at different pH values (pH 1 – pH 8). 
Macimorelin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of two chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by specific optical rotation and capillary electrophoresis. The stereoisomerism of the 
active substance originates from the starting materials in which the minor enantiomer is controlled by 
specification. 
Polymorphism has not been observed for macimorelin acetate as it is amorphous. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Macimorelin acetate is synthesized in nine main steps which include solution peptide synthesis in six 
steps, followed by HPLC purification, salt exchange and lyophilisation. Two commercially available well 
defined starting materials with acceptable specifications are used. Two manufacturers are involved in the 
manufacture of the active substance. The first is responsible for manufacturing steps 1-5 and the second 
for steps 6-9. 
The nine-step manufacturing process starts from D-tryptophan and 2-aminoisobutyric acid synthesis. 
During the assessment, additional information was requested regarding the synthesis of D-tryptophan 
which the applicant had difficulty obtaining due to confidentiality issues. As this information does not 
impact he positive risk-benefit ratio of the product, it is recommended to provide further details of the 
synthesis of D-tryptophan (incl. the host microorganism) in order to understand the likely impurities 
present once it is obtained from the suppliers. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 10/89 
 
 
 
 
 
  
At several stages of the synthesis, reprocessing is optionally performed. Whenever the specified purity 
levels of the in process controls (IPCs), which mostly involve testing the intermediates by HPLC, are not 
met, the respective isolation and workup strategy is repeated. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. During the manufacture of 
macimorelin acetate, two intermediates are isolated and characterized. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance has been changed during development 
and the minor changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: description, identity (HPLC, 1H-NMR, specific optical 
rotation), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (USP), related 
substances (HPLC), chiral purity (capillary electrophoresis), assay, content of acetate (HPLC) and 
microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
The omission of a routine test for one residual solvent in the active substance has been adequately 
justified based on the available batch analysis data. A scale-up of the batch size is under development at 
the time of the MAA with one batch manufactured and 2 additional batches planned for manufacturing. 
The applicant commits to evaluate the specification limits after the production of three batches with the 
increased batch size in order to tighten the specification limits where supported by batch data. 
The finished product manufacturer, based on the risk assessment considering the risk of water uptake of 
the active substance during sampling for identity testing, does not test the active substance prior to 
finished product manufacture. The testing is omitted as the finished product manufacturer is currently 
unable to close the active substance bottles under argon as provided by the active substance 
manufacturer. The tests are performed during quality control, where an assay of macimorelin content is 
performed routinely. This approach was accepted with a recommendation to submit the active substance 
specification issued by the finished product manufacturer within one year after the approval of this 
marketing authorisation. 
Acceptance limits for content of acetate form part of the active substance specification. Under 
consideration of batch-to-batch variability and variability of the analytical method, a range has been 
implemented. 
Batch analysis data from 14 pilot to production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 11/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability data from 2 primary stability and 5 supportive batches of active substance manufactured at 
commercial scale and approximately a third of the commercial scale, respectively, from the proposed 
manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long term conditions 
(2-8 ºC), up to 48 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, up to 12 months at 30 ºC / 65% RH and up to 6 months 
at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The parameters tested were: appearance, the content of acetate and macimorelin by HPLC, the 
identification of related substances by HPLC, the water content and examination of the microbial purity 
(TAMC and TYMC) and the limits are the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same 
as for release and were stability indicating 
The proposed retest period is regarded as justified for macimorelin acetate. 
None of the other samples demonstrated an increase in water content.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Exposure to light 
showed degradation, demonstrating that the active substance is sensitive to light. 
Further studies of the degradation pathway have been carried out (storage in the open container at 60 °C 
/ 75% RH for 3 weeks, light exposure equating to double the dose of that requested by ICH Q1B, acidic 
hydrolysis in 0.1 mol/L HCl for 6 hours, basic hydrolysis in 0.1 mol/L NaOH for 6 hours and oxidation 
stressed condition in 3% H2O2 for 24 hours. The results showed an increase in impurities of up to 8.5 % 
under all investigated conditions. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months at 2-8 ºC in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as granules for oral suspension in sachets containing 60 mg of 
macimorelin (as acetate) as active substance. The granules are white to off-white and following 
dissolution in water prior to administration, the final oral suspension can be described as a “slightly turbid 
suspension”.  
The goal of formulation development was to develop a powder formulation for oral administration 
containing macimorelin acetate indicated for the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in adults. The 
medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. The dosing is weight-based and the recommended single 
dose of the reconstituted suspension is 500 micrograms of macimorelin per kg body weight. Macimorelin 
Aeterna Zentaris granules are to be reconstituted with water and must be used within 30 minutes of 
preparation. 
The acetate salt was chosen as a counter ion for macimorelin during pharmaceutical development in order 
to enhance the solubility of the active substance while providing good tolerability and safety. The 
solubility of the active substance was shown not to be a critical parameter in the reconstitution medium 
(water) or in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Macimorelin acetate has a peptide-like structure and is lyophilized after HPLC purification leading to an 
amorphous compound. The manufacturing process of the active substance results in a narrow range of 
particle sizes. The influence of particle size distribution of the active substance on the content uniformity 
of the finished product was not found to be significant.

All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Compatibility of macimorelin acetate with each of the excipients was investigated in 1:1 physical mixtures 
under accelerated conditions (60 °C for 1 week). For crospovidone (type A), colloidal silicon dioxide and 
sodium stearyl fumarate, no changes in the purity profile compared to the active pharmaceutical 
ingredient (API) alone were observed. In the presence of saccharin sodium, the amount of unidentified 
degradation products increases, indicating a chemical reaction under these conditions. However, as the 
saccharin sodium in the finished product is low, this finding is considered not relevant, which was 
confirmed by stability data obtained with the finished product under the intended storage conditions. 
Macimorelin acetate is a hygroscopic compound and the impact of the water content was evaluated. The 
formation of the impurities was well controlled  
An overfill has been justified to compensate for the incomplete emptying of the sachet, as well as the 
adsorption of the active substance to water-insoluble sodium stearyl fumarate. The amount of 
macimorelin per sachet and the quantity of added macimorelin acetate in the batch formula is adjusted to 
compensate for the stoichiometry, i.e. the macimorelin content of the actual macimorelin acetate active 
substance batch based on the results of assay testing. 
The compatibility of macimorelin with reconstitution containers was demonstrated. It was sufficiently 
justified that a reproducible and accurate dose of the product is delivered under testing conditions which 
simulate how the product is intended to be used in practice. 
In-use stability testing after reconstitution supports the SmPC statement “the suspension must be used 
within 30 minutes after preparation”. 
During clinical development, different formulations and procedures for the preparation of the macimorelin 
suspension have been used: ‘Formulation 1’, ‘Formulation 2’ and ‘Formulation 3’. The formulation used 
during Phase III clinical studies (Formulation 3) is the same as that intended for marketing. 
Manufacturing process development was initially aimed at finding a formulation which could be filled as a 
powder mixture into sachets. Early trials established that a homogeneous filling of the powder mixture 
was not possible due to separation of the components (Formulation 1). To overcome this problem roller 
compaction and dry granulation steps were introduced in the manufacture of ‘Formulation 2’ and 
‘Formulation 3’. Relative bioavailability studies were used to successfully bridge between different clinical 
formulations. 
The  primary  packaging  is  LDPE/Alu/LDPE/paper  sachets.  The  materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements. Due to the hygroscopicity of the API and the potential impact on product stability, a tightly 
sealed primary package was required. Sachets were evaluated as possible primary package and found to 
be  suitable  since  they  are  hermetically  sealed.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  five  main  steps:  powder  mixing,  compaction,  dry  granulation, 
mixing of the granules and filling of granules into sachets. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process. Critical steps are controlled using an IPC.  
A process validation report for 3 consecutive commercial scale batches has been provided. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended

quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  IPCs  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process  and 
pharmaceutical form. 
The omission of a test for water content as an IPC or release test of the finished product was justified by 
presenting values for the water content of the finished product and with the presented control strategy for 
avoiding a significant increase of water content in the active substance and in the finished product and 
was considered acceptable. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
description of the sachet, content of the sachet and reconstituted suspension (visual), identity (HPLC, 
UV),  average  filling  quantity  (weighing),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  uniformity  of 
dosage units (Ph. Eur.), concentration after reconstitution (HPLC) and microbiological examination (Ph. 
Eur.). 
The omission of a test for water as release test of the finished product was appropriately justified. 
In developing a control strategy for elemental impurities in macimorelin granules for oral solution a risk 
assessment according to guideline ICH Q3D was performed. For one finished product unit, the predicted 
level of each investigated elemental impurity relative to the permitted daily exposure (PDE) of the 
elemental impurity is clearly expected below the 30% control threshold, defined by ICH Q3D. This 
conclusion is verified by analysing three representative finished product batches. The test results support 
the omission of elemental impurity testing in the finished product specification. 
Experimental results showing that a stirring time of 2 minutes is necessary for sufficient reconstitution of 
the finished product were provided. The analytical method for determination of total amount of 
macimorelin in the drinking suspension (undissolved and dissolved) was changed during the procedure 
from “Average concentration of macimorelin in drinking suspension” to “Average total API amount in 
drinking suspension” at the request of CHMP. Since it wasn’t possible to fully validate this method during 
the procedure, the applicant committed to do so post-approval.  
The applicant also commits to implement a stirring time of 2 minutes in the new analytical method for 
determination of the total API amount in drinking suspension. The applicant confirmed that the 
implementation of this parameter would take place as soon as the corresponding analytical method had 
been validated. 
Based on this justification and the commitment of the applicant, the parameter “reconstitution time” in 
the release and shelf-life specification of the finished product is omitted. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and 
impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for 8 batches manufactured at approximately half the size of the 
commercial scale confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture 
to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 14/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability data from seven batches manufactured at approximately half the size of the commercial scale of 
the finished product stored for up to 48 months under long term conditions (2-8 ºC), for up to 12 months 
at 25 ºC / 60% RH, for up to 12 months at 30 ºC / 65% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal 
product are identical or representative (differing in fill weight) to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  identity  of  macimorelin  (HPLC  and  UV),  degradation  products 
(HPLC) and content of macimorelin (HPLC). Microbial tests were performed annually and a single batch 
was tested for content after reconstitution (HPLC) as well. The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating. 
No significant changes were observed for batches of the product stored at 2-8 °C for a period of 48 
months. 
Storage at accelerated conditions showed out of specification result at latter time-points. 
The observed out of specification results do not pose any concern as the product will be stored under 
refrigeration. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. Compared to the dark control, the light exposed sample demonstrate 
that the finished product is slightly photosensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 48 months stored in a refrigerator (2 °C - 8 °C 
in the original package in order to protect from light and moisture as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The instability of the hygroscopic active substance and 
incompatibility with the excipient lactose in the presence of elevated water content has been addressed 
during development, resulting in a product which is sufficiently stable. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on TSE safety.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
Description of post-authorisation measure(s) 
1.  Quality: A scale-up of the drug substance batch size is under development. It is recommended to 
evaluate the specification limits after the production of three batches with the increased batch size. 
2.  Quality: It is recommended to provide information about further details regarding one of the starting 
materials. 
3.  Quality:  It  is  recommended  to  submit  within  one  year  after  the  approval  of  this  marketing 
authorisation the active substance specification issued by the finished product manufacturer. 
4.  Quality: It is recommended to implement a new parameter “Average total API amount in drinking 
suspension” into release and shelf life specification of the drug product, which replaces the parameter 
“Average concentration of macimorelin in drinking suspension”.  
5.  Quality: It is recommended to implement a stirring time of 2 minutes into the new analytical method 
for  determination  of  the  total  API  amount  in  drinking  suspension  as  soon  as  the  corresponding 
analytical method had been validated.  
6.  Quality:  It  is  recommended  to  perform  post-approval  validation  of  the  analytical  method  for 
determination of the total API amount in drinking suspension. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Macimorelin acetate (hereafter referred to as macimorelin) is an orally-available ghrelin receptor agonist 
with growth hormone secretagogue (GHS) activity, which was developed for the diagnosis of adult growth 
hormone deficiency (AGHD) by evaluating the pituitary gland secretion of growth hormone (GH) in 
response to a single oral dose of the product.  
The pharmacological and physiological properties of ghrelin have been described in the scientific literature 
(van der Lely et al. 2004). Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide, is mainly produced by the stomach and has 
GH-releasing activity mediated through binding to the GHS receptor type 1a (GHS-R 1a, a 
G-protein-coupled receptor. Binding of ghrelin to the GHS-R 1a activates the phospholipase C signaling 
pathway, leading to increased inositol phosphate turnover and protein kinase C activation, followed by 
Ca2+ release from intracellular stores; GHS-R 1a activation also inhibits K+ channels leading to an opening 
of L-type Ca2+ channels.  
Ghrelin secretion can be stimulated by fasting, by insulin-induced hypoglycemia, by leptin administration, 
and it can be inhibited by glucose. Ghrelin has activities including hypothalamic effects that result in 
stimulation of prolactin (PRL), ACTH, GH and AVP secretion and inhibition of gonadotropin secretion, 
inhibitory influence on the pituitary gonadal axis, increase of appetite and body weight (orexigenic action, 
positive energy balance), influence on sleep and behavior (anxiogenic activity), stimulation of gastric 
motility and acid secretion, inhibition of pancreatic exocrine function, inhibition of insulin secretion from 
pancreatic ß-cells thereby increasing plasma glucose concentration, a role in adipogenesis, 
cardio-protective effects (improving myocardial contractility and inducing vasorelaxation), and 
modulation of proliferation of neoplastic cells as well as of the immune system (anti-proliferative effects).

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In-vitro 
The binding affinity of macimorelin to the human GHS-receptor, was determined in competition binding 
assays. Membranes containing the GHS-receptor were prepared from human pituitary gland and 
hypothalamus and based on their ability to displace 125I-labeled ghrelin from the binding sites, the 
following IC50 values were obtained (in nM): human ghrelin 10.2, hexarelin 12.3, and macimorelin 15.6, 
(Broglio et al. 2002). 
The IC50 values for binding of macimorelin were 22.9 nM for the human pituitary GHS receptor and 123 
nM for the cloned hGHS-R 1a receptor transiently expressed in LLC PK-1 cells (Guerlavais et al. 2003). 
Binding and functional activity for the human, rat and mouse ghrelin receptors, Study 8100_2010_807 
This study aimed at confirming the affinity binding of macimorelin to human GHS-R1A and to demonstrate 
its functional ghrelin agonistic activity in various cell based assay systems (calcium release, induction of 
CRE-dependent reporter gene expression (CRE/Luc), ß-arrestin recruitment and IP-3 generation). 
Data were calculated in % efficacy according to cells treated with saturating concentrations of ghrelin as 
positive, and non-treated cells as negative control. EC50 values are reported in Table 1.

Single EC50 or mean EC50 values +/- SEM are shown of up to three independent experiments performed 
in quadruplicate measurements. All assay systems employed make use of recombinant cell lines stably 
overexpressing the human, rat or mouse ghrelin receptor. Competitive binding and different functional 
assays have been conducted, i.e. calcium release (calcium release), CRE-dependent luciferase reporter 
gene expression (CRE/Luc), ß-Arrestin recruitment (ß-Arrestin) and IP-3 generation (IP-One). 
In vitro activity studies of macimorelin synthesis by products, impurities, stereosimers and degradation 
products, Study 8100_2014_997 
The potential agonistic ghrelin activity of macimorelin synthesis by products, impurities, stereoisomers 
and degradation products were investigated in two functional assays, the CRE/Luc induction test and the 
calcium release assay. All data were calculated in % efficacy according to cells treated with saturating 
concentrations of ghrelin as positive, and non-treated cells as negative control.  
To exclude potential antagonistic activities, the reporter cell line was stimulated with 10 nM Ghrelin for 
four hours together with the test compounds in the presence of Rolipram, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. 
Neither  macimorelin,  nor  any  of  the  assessed  byproducts,  impurities,  stereoisomers  and  degradation 
values  could  not  be  determined,  since  the 
products  showed  significant  antagonistic  activity.  The  EC
50 
maximum effect at the highest test concentration of 31.6 μM was below 50%.

In-vivo 
In rats, s.c. administration of 300 µg/kg macimorelin or 300 µg/kg hexarelin increased GH plasma 
concentrations to a similar extent (Broglio et al. 2002). 
In dogs, macimorelin, ibutamoren (MK-677, reference compound) and hexarelin were orally administered 
each at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Whereas hexarelin was ineffective, both macimorelin and ibutamoren 
stimulated GH secretion to a comparable extent (Guerlavais et al. 2003). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Potential  off-targets  of  macimorelin  were  investigated  in  an  in  vitro  study  using  the  commercially 
available  Cerep  Eurofins  Diversity  Profile.  Macimorelin  was  tested  at  a  concentration  of  10  μM 
(representing approx. 500-fold of the clinical total Cmax) in duplicate. 
Among  the  96  targets  tested,  only  4  targets  showed  a  mean  inhibition  >25%.  Follow-up  studies  to 
determine the IC50 values for these targets are currently ongoing.

In order to assess whether macimorelin exerts delayed effects on the cardiac ion channels hERG and 
Nav1.5, the in vitro effect of macimorelin on these channels in HEK293 cells was assessed after 5 minutes 
and 4 hours treatment (Study 180527.BFA).  For this purpose, cells were either loaded directly into wells 
of the Population Patch ClampTM (PPC) planar electrode and incubated for 5 min with the test items, or 
preincubated for 4 h on an orbital shaker and the loaded into the wells of the PPC planar electrode.. For 
hNav1.5 two voltage test pulses TP1 (tonic inhibition) and TP2 (inactivated state inhibition) were applied.  
The effects of macimorelin and of the reference compound anamorelin were tested over a concentration 
range of 0.1 – 300 μM. The positive controls for the hNav1.5 assay were Lidocaine (1 – 3000 μM) and 
Amiodarone (0.01 – 30 μM) for the 5 min exposure and Lidocaine (150 μM) as well as Amiodarone (0.01 
– 10 μM) for the 4 h exposure. For the hERG assay the positive controls were Cisapride (0.001 – 3 μM) and 
Amiodarone (0.01 - 30 μM) for the 5 min exposure and Cisapride (0.5 μM) as well as Amiodarone (0.01 
– 10 μM) for the 4 h exposure.  
The IC50 values of hERG and Nav1.5 channel inhibition with the test article and the reference compounds

The bi-directional permeability of macimorelin was investigated in Caco-2 cells over a concentration range 
of 2.5 – 1000 µM (Study 8100_2013_950). The apparent permeability (Papp) values for macimorelin 
were similar across the concentration range and the mean values were 1.33 ± 0.19 cm/s x10-6 for the 
ab direction, and 2.37 ± 0.36 cm/s x10-6 for the ba direction.  
Single dose studies 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  macimorelin  after  oral  or  iv  administration  of  a  single  dose  was 
investigated 3 studies in Han Wistar rats (Table 4).

Metabolism and Excretion 
In vitro liver metabolism 
The in vitro phase I metabolism of macimorelin was investigated using pooled male and pooled female 
human, rat, mouse and dog liver microsomes (Study 2012-01). 
Macimorelin was quickly metabolized by hepatic microsomal CYPs in a NADPH dependent manner with 
18.0 % of macimorelin remaining after one hour of incubation at 37 °C in mouse liver microsomes. In 
microsomes of other species macimorelin was determined to be more stable with 47.2 % (human), 50.7 
%  (rat)  and  61.6  %  (dog)  remaining,  respectively,  clearly  showing  species  dependency  of  Phase  I 
metabolism.  
Phase II metabolism was investigated in vitro in mixed-gender human S9 fractions in the presence and 
absence of cofactors required for cytochrome P450 enzymes (NADPH) or transferases (UDPGA, GSH, 
PAPS) (Study 2012-01). No evidence of contribution of Phase II enzymes to the overall metabolism of 
macimorelin was found. 
CYP identification of macimorelin metabolism was performed using two independent methods, chemical 
inhibition in human liver microsomes and recombinant human CYPs enzymes (Study 2012-01). Both 
experiments demonstrated that macimorelin is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4. 
Excretion  
No excretion studies with macimorelin were submitted. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro Cytochrome P450 Induction 
The ability of macimorelin to induce increases in the mRNA levels of the P450 isozymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6 
and CYP3A4/5 was assessed using primary cultures of cryopreserved human hepatocytes. At 
concentrations of > 10 µM, macimorelin showed concentration-dependent induction of both CYP2B6 and 
CYP3A4 (up to 4.4 and 3.7  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018

induction values). However, these values were low compared to the prototypical inducers (phenobarbital 
for CYP2B6, rifampicin for CYP3A4), and no clear induction was observed at a concentration of 3.16 μM 
macimorelin, which is >100-fold the mean Cmax values for macimorelin observed at clinically relevant 
doses in humans. Macimorelin did not induce CYP1A2.   
Pgp inhibition in vitro 
The ability of macimorelin to inhibit the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) was assessed using Pgp 
over-expressing SF9 cell membrane preparations in the presence of ATP and the Pgp substrate verapamil. 
Macimorelin at test concentrations of up to 88.8 µM did not inhibit Pgp ATPase activity. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
One single dose toxicity study following intravenous administration of macimorelin was performed in CD 
rats (Study R14810).  
There was no mortality observed in any dose group. The first clinical changes were sedation and shallow 
breathing observed in animals treated at the high dose (60 mg/kg) immediately after injection, followed 
by hypoactivity, piloerection, hunched posture and blood in urine. Animals treated at 45 mg/kg showed 
sedation immediately after dosing and later hypoactivity and piloerection. Recovery was achieved in the 
animals within one week of treatment. At necropsy, no noteworthy macroscopic changes were observed 
in any dose group. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Study R14828 
Macimorelin was administered once per day for two consecutive weeks intravenously (IV) to Spargue 
Dawley rats (4/sex/group) at doses of 0, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg.  
There was no mortality at any dose group. The main clinical symptoms were sedation/hypoactivity, ear 
redness and blood in the urine of animals dosed at 10 and 30 mg/kg and tachypnea in the 30 mg/kg group 
only. At necropsy, a slight increase in mean pituitary weight was observed at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg 
without histopathological findings. The NOAEL was 3 mg/kg.  
Study 2732/008 
Macimorelin  was  given  by  oral  gavage  at  doses  of  50,  250  and  1000  mg/kg  to  Han  Wistar  rats 
(3/sex/group). Macimorelin was well tolerated and produced no signs of systemic toxicity. Toxicokinetic 
evaluation demonstrated dose-dependent exposure.  
Study AA32387 
Macimorelin was given by oral gavage at doses of 10, 50 and 150 mg/kg to Wistar rats (5/sex/group) for 
14  consecutive  days.    6M  and  6F  per  dose  group  served  as  satellite  animals  for  toxicokinetics.  No 
mortality occurred during the study. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed. Toxicokinetic evaluation 
confirmed rapid absorption with dose-dependent exposure.  
Study 1502-002 
Macimorelin was given by oral gavage at doses of 0, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg to CD rats (10/sex/group) 
for at least 27 consecutive days. During week 1, one animal at 500 mg.kg/day died following dose

administration. However, the incident was considered not to be associated with the test article. All other 
animals survived until the scheduled termination interval. The toxicology evaluation did not identify any 
test article-related findings. Therefore, the NOAEL was determined to be greater than or equal to 1000 
mg/kg/day. 
Toxikokinetic results from this study are presented in Table 8.  
Study AA32386 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) by iv, was investigated in beagles dogs in this study in two phases. 
In phase 1, single ascending doses were administered up to 60 mg/kg. In phase 2, animals were treated 
for 7 days at the dose level of 40 mg/kg. The observed clinical signs were mainly hypersalivation, redness 
of mucosa, vomiting and head shaking during and/or after injection. At the higher doses, unsteady gait or 
poor motor coordination, tremors, stiffness of hindlimbs, abdominal breathing, subdued behaviour and 
vomiting were observed in a dose-related manner. 
Macimorelin was also given by oral gavage at escalating doses of 5, 20, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg to 1 male 
beagle  dog.  Each  dose  was  administered  on  2  consecutive  days  for  a  total  of  10  days  of  treatment. 
Macimorelin  was  well  tolerated  and  produced  no  signs  of  systemic  toxicity.    Toxicokinetic  evaluation 
demonstrated dose-related exposure.  
Study 2732/007 
Macimorelin was given for a total of 5 days by oral gavage at daily escalating doses of 50, 100, 250, 500 
and 1000 mg/kg to 2 male and 2 female beagle dogs/dose level.  
 Administration  up  to  1000  mg/kg/day  was  well  tolerated  except  for  vomiting  which  was  observed 
immediately or 0.25 up to 1 hour post-dose.  
Systemic exposure generally increased with the dose.  
Study 2732/009 
One beagle dog per sex and group received 0, 50, 250 or 1000 mg/kg macimorelin for five days. 
Systemic exposure of macimorelin was dose related, being generally sub-proportional upon initial dosing 
and becoming supra-proportional upon repeated dosing. Macimorelin administration resulted in a 
treatment related increase in growth hormone levels in the dog, although the response seen at 1000 
mg/kg/day was less than that seen at 50 mg/kg/day. Maximal growth hormone response occurred within 
1 hour of dosing, and levels were similar to the control group by 8 hours post-dose in most animals 
receiving macimorelin. 
Sporadic incidences of emesis (mostly immediately post-dose on Day 1) were seen in animals given 250 
or 1000 mg/kg/day and soft/liquid or pale faeces were seen in animals given 50, 250 or 1000 mg/kg/day. 
Study 1502-001 
Macimorelin was given by oral gavage for 28 consecutive days at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg to 4 male 
and 4 female beagle dogs/ dose level.  
All animals survived until the schedule termination interval. The toxicology evaluation did not identify any 
test article-related findings. All doses were well tolerated, and the NOAEL was determined to be greater 
than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The binding affinity of macimorelin towards the human pituitary GHS receptor (IC50: 13.3 - 22.9 nM) and 
the cloned hGHS-R1a receptor transiently expressed in LLC PK-1 cells (IC50: 123 nM) was similar to that 
of the natural ligand ghrelin. Lower EC50 values for macimorelin (0.9 – 8.4 nM) were obtained in 3 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 27/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
functional assays (calcium release, induction of CRE-dependent reporter gene expression and ß-arrestin 
recruitment) in GHS-R 1a-expressing cell lines. These differences in the EC50 values are similar to those 
that have been observed in a study for ghrelin and several ghrelin agonists in different assays for the 
ghrelin receptor (Holst et al., 2005). In that study, the ghrelin receptor agonists binding affinity did not 
correlate to potency in functional assays, nor was there a trend that the EC50 values in functional assays 
were lower than the Kd for the binding assay. Therefore there is no evidence that the GSHR1a has a 
receptor reserve. 
Ghrelin has lower efficacy to activate the ghrelin receptor than the synthetic ligands (like macimorelin) 
and, therefore, ghrelin is a partial agonist (Bennett et al. 2009). The binding sites of the endogenous 
agonist ghrelin overlap with those of the growth hormone secretagogues and growth hormone-releasing 
peptides. The ghrelin receptor functions as a homo-dimer, where ghrelin binding occurs only in 1 subunit. 
Both  growth  hormone-releasing  peptides  and  small-molecule  growth  hormone  secretagogues  act  as 
agonists  at  the  ghrelin  receptor  and  are  “ago-allosteric”  ligands  at  the  ghrelin  receptor  because,  in 
addition to producing direct activation of the receptor, when co-administered with ghrelin such ligands 
increase the maximum efficacy of ghrelin (Holst et al. 2005). 
In comparison to macimorelin, synthesis by-products, impurities, stereoisomers and degradation 
products show reduced or no agonistic activity in mouse LTK-cells overexpressing the human ghrelin 
receptor.  
In secondary pharmacodynamic studies, macimorelin showed only limited inhibitory activity for 4 out of 
the 96 targets investigated at a concentration much higher (approx. 500-fold) than the clinical Cmax and 
therefore these observed effects are unlikely to be relevant for the proposed indication  
In safety pharmacology studies performed in vitro, macimorelin did not inhibit hERG or Nav1.5 currents 
at  micro-molar  concentrations.  In  anaesthetized  dogs  after  i.v.  administration  of  macimorelin  ECG 
parameters (especially QT intervals) were not markedly affected by macimorelin. This is in contrast with 
findings in  humans (see clinical section). At an  IV dose of 30 mg/kg macimorelin, cardiovascular and 
respiratory  effects  were  observed.  The  exposure  of  the  animals  after  IV  administration  is  very  high 
compared  to  the  oral  route  (due  to  the  low  oral  bioavailability)  so  these  findings  are  most  likely  not 
relevant for human use of macimorelin.  
Since QT prolongation was observed in patients with a temporal delay compared to Cmax, the Applicant 
submitted another in-vitro study to evaluate longer-term effects of macimorelin on human cardiac ion 
channels. In this study, both short term (5 min) and long term (4 hour) treatments with macimorelin had 
no  significant  effect  on  hERG  and  Nav1.5  channel  currents.  Positive  controls  produced  concentration 
dependent inhibition of hERG and Nav1.5 channel currents with more than 50% inhibition at the highest 
test concentrations.  
In the in vitro permeability assays the efflux ratio of Papp values (efflux/influx) of 1.8 ± 0.3 indicates only 
moderate efflux. 
In study AA33729 pharmacokinetics and absolute bioavailability of macimorelin was assessed in rats 
(n=9 per sex) following single oral administration at doses of 0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg or intravenous (bolus) 
administration at a dose of 50 mg/kg. In parallel, stimulation of GH release was assessed following oral 
and intravenous administration in comparison to basal levels at day -1.  
Macimorelin is quickly absorbed after oral administration but the oral bioavailability is low, below 1% in 
rats and around 0.5 to 2.5% in dogs.

In rats and dogs, protein binding did not change significantly with the concentration. The mean plasma 
protein binding over the tested concentration range was 58% in rats and 68% in dogs, corresponding to 
an unbound fraction of 42% and 32%, respectively. 
Although  sufficient  exposure  in  the  toxicology  studies  was  demonstrated  by  toxicokinetic  data,  no 
pharmacodynamic  effects  were  observed  in  the  rat  studies.  Macimorelin  is  a  ghrelin  agonist,  and  in 
humans  ghrelin  affects  appetite  and  body  composition  and  leads  to  growth  hormone  (GH)  release. 
Increasing plasma GH levels were not observed in rats and macimorelin did not affect body weight and 
food consumption. It is possible that the handling of the animals as well as the blood sampling procedure 
under anesthesia on day -1 and day 0 most likely induced suppression of growth hormone release and /or 
induction of erratic release of GH at individual time points. Anesthetics as well as stress are known to 
influence GH secretion in rats (and in other species) (Grealy and O’Donnell, 1991; Takahashi et al., 1971; 
Terry et al., 1976). Further, it should be noted that the animals were not fasted. Since food intake has a 
direct  effect  on  GH  levels,  it  is  conceivable  that  this  also  had  an  impact  on  the  pharmacodynamic 
assessment. 
At very high exposure, achieved with IV administration, transient central nervous system effects became 
obvious.  Similar  effects  were  also  observed  in  the  IV  PK/PD  studies  and  consisted  among  others  of 
sedation/hypoactivity,  subdued  behaviour  and  tachypnoea/hyperventilation  in  both  species  (rats  and 
dogs). In a rat PK/PD  study unscheduled deaths occurred at high exposure after IV administration of 
macimorelin. The applicant explained that these most likely were related to procedures or anaesthesia 
but most likely not to macimorelin. 
The lack of metabolism and excretion studies was considered acceptable, as macimorelin is a tri-peptide 
and therefore its metabolic pathways are generally understood.  
Macimorelin is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 as determined by both chemical inhibition and recombinant 
CYP studies. Therefore, strong CYP3A4 inhibitors might have the potential to inhibit the metabolism of 
macimorelin  thereby  increasing  its  plasma  concentration.  Macimorelin  is  not  a  clinically  significant 
inhibitor of Pgp nor an inducer or inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 and, therefore, the risk for 
drug-drug-interactions via these CYP isozymes is negligible. 
In the repeat dose toxicity studies, a high exposure margin compared to the diagnostic human exposure 
becomes obvious in respect to AUC and Cmax. 
No carcinogenicity studies were submitted and this was considered acceptable as macimorelin is intended 
for single-use only. 
Macimorelin  was  negative  in  an  in  vitro  genotoxic  test  battery  and  no  pharmacokinetic  effects  are 
expected in vivo which could impact the genotoxic potential of macimorelin. In addition, macimorelin will 
only  be  applied  as  a  single  dose  resulting  in  low  human  exposure.  Therefore,  the  lack  of  in  vivo 
genotoxicity testing was considered acceptable. 
Reproductive toxicity testing, as well as placental transfer and excretion into milk of macimorelin were not 
performed. However, in the repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 4 wk in rats no effects on reproductive 
organs by assessment of organ weight, macroscopic and microscopic evaluation were observed.  
As there are no data for the use of macimorelin in pregnant women and studies in animals are insufficient 
with respect to reproductive toxicity the potential risk for humans is unknown.  Macimorelin is therefore 
not recommended during pregnancy and women of childbearing potential must use adequate 
contraceptive methods at the time when macimorelin will be administered. Furthermore, as it is unknown 
whether macimorelin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk a risk to the suckling child cannot be 
excluded and the decision on whether to discontinue breast feeding or to abstain from macimorelin,

should take into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of the test for the 
woman.   
Based on the environmental risk assessment macimorelin is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Considering that macimorelin is intended for single-use, the submitted non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmaco- kinetic and toxicology studies are considered sufficient.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Seven clinical trials contributed clinical pharmacology data to the clinical development of macimorelin 
(also referred to as AEZS-130), including the two phase 3 trials AEZS-130- 047 and -052. In most cases, 
PK and PD were addressed in the same study. PD was measured as increase in serum growth hormone 
(GH) level. 
Data were not systematically pooled for PK evaluations because of different formulations  and sampling 
schedules used in different studies. Although no relevant differences in the systemic uptake between the 
different formulations were noted, it is important to mention the most recent studies AEZS-130-052, 
-054, and -055, that provide the pivotal safety and efficacy data for the use of the product in the target 
indication, used the formulation intended for marketing. 
Absorption  
No  PK  study  for  determining  bioavailability  was  performed.  The  applicant  presented  a  report  from 
published literature (Broglio et al., 2002) in which the PD effect of macimorelin, i.e. serum GH increase 
was determined after oral vs. intravenous administration. An IV dose of 1 µg/kg elicited a similar serum 
GH increase as did 0.25 mg/kg orally, indication that roughly 1/250 (i.e. 0.4%) of the oral dose reached 
the circulation. See also the Pharmacodynamic section of this report. 
• 
Influence of food 
The  influence  of  food  on  PK  and  PD  of  oral  macimorelin  were  studied  in  the  food  effect  trial 
ARD-0705-003.  
A total of 16 healthy subjects (8 males and 8 females) were included in a cross-over design, receiving 0.5 
mg/kg macimorelin with food on Day 1 and without food on Day 4 or vice versa. All 16 subjects completed 
the study. 
Oral  administration  of  macimorelin  took  place  on  study  Day  1  either  in  fasting  condition  or  with  a 
concomitant standard liquid meal. Time zero was defined as the time of oral administration of the study 
drug.  On  study  Day  4  subjects  who  received  macimorelin  in  fasting  condition on  Day  1  now  received 
macimorelin with a concomitant meal while subjects who received macimorelin with a concomitant meal 
on Day 1 now received macimorelin in fasting condition.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The  objective  of  study  AEZS-130-IIT-1  was  to  evaluate  the  pharmacological  profile  and  the  growth 
hormone releasing activity of increasing single oral doses of macimorelin acetate in healthy volunteers.

The study was conducted as a randomized, placebo-and positive-controlled, dose escalating study. Two 
treatments were given in 36 healthy male subjects; one treatment consisted of one oral dose of either 
macimorelin or placebo while the second treatment consisted of a GHRH stimulation test. The following 
doses of macimorelin were tested: 0.005, 0.05, and 0.5 mg/kg. A subgroup of subjects received in a 
randomized fashion two additional oral doses of macimorelin (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg). The time course of 
macimorelin  plasma  levels  is  shown  in  Figure  3,  and  the  calculated  PK  parameters  are  presented  in

Phase 3 study AEZS-130-052 
The  administered  dose  of  macimorelin  was  0.5  mg/kg  as  oral  solution.  The  mean  maximal  observed 
macimorelin plasma concentration (Cmax) of 10.63 ng/mL was reached at mean tmax = 48.5 minutes 
(n=138);  median  Cmax  was  9.38  ng/mL  and  median  tmax  was  45.0  minutes.  Highest  values  for 
mean/median macimorelin plasma concentrations per scheduled time point were determined at 45 and 
60 minutes post dose with 8.8 ng/mL/7.4 ng/mL and 8.5 ng/mL/7.1 ng/mL. These were the same time 
points when highest total GH concentrations were measured (see Clinical Efficacy section of this report).

Phase 3 study AEZS-130-047 
Pharmacokinetic evaluations were only performed on a small subset of subjects enrolled in this trial when 
it was resumed by the current applicant as the previously obtained samples were out of stability. The 
mean maximal observed concentration (Cmax) was 10.25 ng/mL in AGHD patients (n = 10) and 11.50 
ng/mL in matched controls (n = 38). The mean time to reach maximal observed concentration (tmax) 
was 1.2 hours after oral administration in AGHD patients and 0.82 hours in normal controls. The terminal 
half-life was 3.56 hours in AGHD patients and 2.77 hours in normal controls. 
AEZS-130-054 
This  was  a  single-dose,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind  study  to  evaluate  the  safety, 
tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of  three  ascending  oral  doses  of 
macimorelin in healthy male and female subjects. Overall, 28 subjects were planned to be included: 6 
subjects  each  in  the  first  two  dosing  groups  (0.5  and  1.0  mg/kg  macimorelin)  and  9  subjects  in  the

Time dependency 
Repeated  administration  was  not  tested  in  humans  so  no  information  on  time-dependency  of  PK  in 
humans is available. Accumulation of macimorelin was observed after repeated administration in animals 
(female rats, see non-clinical section of this Report). 
Special populations 
No data are available in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, elderly or paediatric patients. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
PK in patients with (suspected) GH deficiency was (partly) determined in the phase 3 trials 047 and 052. 
No relevant differences in GH deficiency patients as compared to healthy control subjects were observed. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No pharmacokinetic studies in humans were submitted. Macimorelin is metabolised by CYP3A4 according 
to in vitro data (see non-clinical section of this Report).

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Macimorelin (macimorelin acetate) is a small molecule peptidomimetic ghrelin agonist that stimulates the 
release of growth hormone and is intended to be used for stimulating GH release in a diagnostic test in GH 
deficiency. 
GH concentrations in blood can be determined by different types of assays (e.g., immunoassays with 
fluorescence,  chemiluminescence  or  radio  detection)  using  different  calibration  standards.  During  the 
conduct of the clinical studies with macimorelin, different GH assays were used. 
In  study  AEZS-130-047,  an  immunochemiluminometric  assay  was  employed.  As  this  assay  was  no 
longer available when multi-centre study 052 started, as an alternative, the IDS-iSYS Human Growth 
Hormone  assay  (Immunodiagnostic  Systems  Ltd.,  UK)  was  used.  This  assay,  used  in  phase  3  study 
AEZS-130-052, is standardized to the recombinant growth hormone calibration standard WHO 98/574, 
and complies with recommendations on assay standardization as outlined by Clemmons 2011.  
In Study AEZS-130-IIT-1, which was conducted at a university hospital, GH and other hormones were 
determined in the central laboratory of the hospital by radio-immuno assay (RIA).  
For  Study  AEZS-130-054,  the  Cobas  601hGH  assay  was  chosen.  This  assay  is  a  validated  two-step 
immunoassay using the ElectroChemiLuminescence (ECL) technology.  
The  design  of  studies  AEZS-130-047,  AEZS-130-IIT-1  and  AEZS-130-054  are  described  in  the 
pharmacokinetics  section  of  this  report  above.  Results  from  the  phase  3  studies,  AEZS-130-047  and 
AEZS-130-052 are presented in the clinical efficacy section of this report. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The first administration of macimorelin in man occurred in the study by Broglio et al., 2002 and involved 
2 young healthy male subjects. 
Both subjects received IV ghrelin (1 μg/kg), IV macimorelin (1 μg/kg), IV placebo and incremental doses 
of oral macimorelin (0.06, 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg). The IV and oral administration was at least 10 
days apart. The highest oral macimorelin dose (0.5 mg/kg) was repeated on two consecutive days. No 
details on the assay used for determining GH in serum were provided. 
A marked and prompt increase in GH levels was observed after IV macimorelin administered at a low dose 
of 1.0 μg/kg as illustrated in the figure below. Cmax of GH was around 100 µg/L (ng/mL) for one subject 
and around 40 µg/L for the other volunteer (mean around 70 ng/mL). 
Oral  macimorelin  dose-dependently  induced  a  marked  increase  in  serum  GH  levels  lasting  for 
approximately  180  minutes.  The  Cmax  of  GH  following  0.25  mg/kg  macimorelin  PO  was  around  70 
ng/mL, i.e. in the same order of magnitude as with 1 µg/kg macimorelin IV.  
ARD-0705-003 
Pre-dose values of GH were similar before the with food administration (mean ± SD = 2.4 ± 5.6 ng/mL) 
and the without food administration (mean ± SD = 2.6 ± 3.5 ng/mL). 
The highest concentration of GH (mean ± SD = 29.8 ± 23.6 ng/mL) was observed at 45 minutes after 
dosing in the without food group. The highest concentration of GH with food administration (mean ± SD 
= 7.0 ± 15.3 ng/mL) was achieved at 60 minutes. Thus, the food effect on GH Cmax was larger than on

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant determined the PK profile (exposure, Cmax, Tmax, t1/2) of macimorelin after a single dose. 
The increase in exposure was approximately linear with dose in the dose range tested. More extensive PK 
data, covering bioavailability, metabolites, excretion routes, interactions and PK in special populations 
were  not  provided.  Considering  that  the  intended  use  of  macimorelin  is  for  a  single  dose  only,  the 
provided data are considered sufficient to characterise the pharmacokinetic profile of the product. 
Macimorelin was absorbed rapidly and the maximum plasma macimorelin concentrations (Cmax) were 
observed  approximately  30  minutes  to  1  hour  and  10  minutes  after oral  administration  of  0.5  mg/kg 
macimorelin after fasting for at least 8 hours. A liquid meal decreased the macimorelin Cmax and AUC by 
0.42 and 0.5 fold, respectively. Hence, the macimorelin test should be conducted in the fasting state as 
recommended in the SmPC. 
In line with findings in animals, the oral availability appeared to be low (Broglio et.al, 2012). However, the 
reliability and robustness of this finding is limited sine only two subjects were tested, the macimorelin 
formulation used is not known and the assay used for serum GH determination was not described.

Macimorelin is moderately bound to plasma proteins. Plasma protein binding decreases with increasing 
concentrations from 78% at 0.1 μM to 62% at 10 μM. At the clinically relevant concentration of 0.1 μM 
(clinical Cmax = 11.2 ng/ml = approx. 0.02 μM), the unbound fraction of macimorelin in human plasma 
is 22%. 
According to in vitro data macimorelin is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4.  First-pass metabolism by this 
enzyme could lead to PK interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers. However, it is not known to 
which  extent  macimorelin  plasma  level  increase  in  the  presence  of  CYP3A4  inhibitors.    Whilst  it  is 
acknowledged  that  patients  treated  with  (weak)  CYP  inhibitors  in  the  pivotal  study  052  (see  Clinical 
efficacy section of this report) did not show a significantly different GH response, the number of those 
subjects  was  low  and  thus  firm  conclusions  cannot  be  reached.  Therefore,  and  in  the  absence  of 
confirmative data, concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors should be discouraged when performing the test. 
This is reflected in the product information which states, that co-administration of a CYP3A4 inhibitor may 
increase the macimorelin plasma concentration, and this, in turn, could yield higher plasma GH levels. 
Increased GH levels due to CYP inhibition may decrease sensitivity of the assay (leading to increased 
number of false negatives, by raising the GH level above the cut-off). Based on current understanding, 
this is unlikely to decrease specificity of the test. 
The lack of studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of macimorelin in paediatric patients is acceptable as 
the product is intended for use in adult patients only and the product information states that the safety 
and diagnostic efficacy of macimorelin in children and adolescents below 18 years has not yet been 
established.   
There are no data available on the extent of macimorelin excretion via liver or kidney. In clinical studies, 
patients were excluded from macimorelin intake in case of elevation of laboratory parameters indicating 
hepatic or renal dysfunction or damage (ASAT, ALAT, GGT > 2.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN); 
creatinine or bilirubin > 1.5 x ULN). Therefore, no dose adjustment recommendations in case of renal 
and/or hepatic impairment can be given. 
Only limited pharmacokinetic data are available in the elderly. As growth hormone secretion normally 
decreases with age the efficacy of macimorelin in patients aged over 65 years has not yet been 
established.  
PD studies were conducted to address the effect relevant for the intended diagnostic use, increase of 
plasma GH level. All other physiological effects of ghrelin agonists were not studied. This is acceptable 
since most of these effects, such as regulation of appetite and body composition, are not expected to be 
affected after a single dose of macimorelin administration. 
Exposure (AUC) and Cmax increased proportionally with dose in the dose range tested (0 to 0.5 mg/kg 
PO)  in  Study  AEZS-130-IIT-1.  Plasma  drug  concentrations  after  oral  administration  peaked  (Cmax) 
between 50 and 75 minutes with the shortest time observed after the highest dose of macimorelin. Dose 
proportionality was shown by linear regression analysis: a significant linear correlation was seen, both for 
AUC (P < 0.001, R = 0.986) and for Cmax (P < 0.05; R = 0.977). t½ ranged from 1.8 to 2.1 hours with 
no statistically significance difference between dose groups (p = 0.5430). Maximal GH release has been 
observed at macimorelin plasma concentrations of ≥ 7 ng/ml.  
Other  studies  with  PK  data  yielded  similar  results.  The  only  exception  was  the  AUC  at  0.5  mg/kg  of 
macimorelin in Study AEZS-130-054, which was quite high and similar to the AUC at 1 mg/kg; on the 
other hand, the AUC at 2 mg/kg was about twice the AUC at 1 mg/kg as expected.  
No studies were performed to address potential PD interactions although several compounds are known 
to affect GH secretion or GH levels. Concomitant use of macimorelin therefore should be avoided with

medicinal products that directly affect the pituitary secretion of growth hormone, or transiently elevate 
growth  hormone  concentrations  or  that  may  blunt  the  growth  hormone  response  to  macimorelin. 
Sufficient washout time (five elimination half-lives) of these medicinal products prior to administration of 
macimorelin  is  recommended.  Growth  hormone  medicinal  products  should  be  discontinued  at  least  1 
month before administering macimorelin. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Macimorelin has been adequately characterised from a clinical pharmacology perspective despite the lack 
of information on bioavailability, metabolites, excretion routes, interactions and PK properties in special 
populations, as the intended use of the product is limited to single administration for diagnostic purposes.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No formal dose response studies were submitted. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study  No.  AEZS-130-052:    Confirmatory Validation of Oral Macimorelin as a Growth Hormone (GH) 
Stimulation Test (ST) for the Diagnosis of Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (AGHD) in Comparison with 
the Insulin Tolerance Test (ITT) 
Methods 
The performance of the macimorelin GHST (‘MAC’) and the ITT was compared in this open-label, 
randomized, single dose, 2-way crossover study.  
Study subjects were assigned to groups of descending likelihood of having AGHD (Group A: high 
likelihood of GHD, Group D: healthy controls).  
The sequential order of the GHSTs for the suspected AGHD subjects was determined by stratified 
randomization; healthy control subjects (Group D) were tested in the same sequence as the matched 
Group A subjects. The two GHSTs were performed 7 days to 1 month apart. An additional MAC (Test 3) 
was performed in a subset of Group A, B, and C patients within 8 to 28 days following the second GHST 
of the core study to provide information on the repeatability of the macimorelin testy. 
Study Participants 
Study subjects were assigned to three groups (A, B, C) of descending likelihood of having AGHD and to a 
control group of healthy subjects matching Group A subjects (D).  
With regard to likelihood of AGHD, the following definitions were used: 
Group A: High likelihood of GHD (approx. 25% of the study population) 
•  Structural hypothalamic or pituitary lesions and low IGF-1, and/or 
•  Three or more pituitary hormone deficiencies (PHD) and low IGF-1, or 
•  Childhood onset GHD with structural lesions and low IGF-1. 
Group B: Intermediate likelihood of GHD: 
•    Eligible subjects not qualifying for either high or low likelihood (Group A/C) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 39/89 
 
 
 
 
 
Group C: Low likelihood of GHD (approx. 25% of the study population) 
•  One risk factor for GHD only, such as history of distant traumatic brain injury (TBI) or one PHD 
only with otherwise normal pituitary function, or 
•  Isolated idiopathic childhood onset GHD without additional pituitary deficits. 
Group D: Healthy control. Healthy subjects matching Group A subjects by sex, age, body mass index 
(BMI), and oestrogen status (females only). 
Healthy controls were included after the successful completion of both GHSTs (adjudication by the DRC) 
in a subject that had been registered with ‘high likelihood AGHD’ criteria, irrespective of the actual ITT 
outcome in that subject. Matching criteria were as follows: Sex, age +/- 5 years, BMI +/- 2 kg/m2  
Inclusion criteria 
Groups A, B and C 
•  Male or female, aged between 18 and 65 years. 
•  Suspected growth hormone deficiency (GHD), based on either of the following (Group A-C): 
• structural hypothalamic or pituitary disease, or 
• surgery or irradiation in these areas, or 
• head trauma as an adult, or 
• evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies, or 
• idiopathic childhood onset GHD (without known hypothalamic or pituitary lesion or injury). 
OR (recruitment at a dedicated Phase I Unit only) 
Group D: Healthy control 
Subject matching a Group A subject by:  
• Sex, age (± 5 years), BMI (± 2 kg/m2), and oestrogen status** (women only);  
* ‘Healthy’ comprising:  
• History of normal growth and development,  
• Serum prolactin concentration within normal range limits,  
• History of regular, age-appropriate menses in females  
• Serum testosterone concentration within normal range limits for males.  
** Matching for ‘oestrogen status’:  
• Group A subjects below 50 years and on oral oestrogen therapy will be matched to control subjects 
who are also taking oestrogen (as an oral contraceptive or for replacement); the route of oestrogen 
administration (e.g. oral versus transdermal) must also be matched.  
• Group A subjects 50 years or older and with untreated oestrogen deficiency will be matched to 
female control subjects who are not receiving oestrogen

Prior and concomitant therapy 
As macimorelin is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4, concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inducers 
was prohibited during the study. 
Patients were also excluded in case of concomitant treatment with any drugs that might prolong QT/QTc.  
Treatments 
Macimorelin oral solution was prepared by study personnel and dosed according to the following general 
instruction:  
• Weigh the patient and determine the number of pouches/sachets needed. (one pouch was required for 
a patient equal or less than (≤) 120 kg, a second pouch was required if the patient weighted more than 
(>) 120 kg).  
• Dissolve the entire contents of each pouch in 120 mL of water in a suitable transparent container and stir 
gently for about 2 to 3 minutes. (a small amount of un-dissolved particles will remain).  
• Based on the dose of 0.5 mg/kg (included per CSP 2.0), determine the required volume of the solution, 
which corresponds to the patient body weight, i.e., 1 mL/kg. (for example, a 70 kg patient will require 70 
mL of the prepared solution).  
• Measure the required volume for the subject by using a graduated 50 mL syringe and transfer it to a 
drinking glass.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 41/89 
 
 
 
 
 
• The solution must be used within 30 minutes after preparation.  
Regular human insulin was administered intravenously (i.v.) as one or two injections on the day of the 
ITT. The recommended standard dose was 0.10 U/kg for the first injection (0.15 U/kg in subjects with a 
BMI > 30 kg/m2). The second injection as an additional insulin bolus of 0.05 U/kg was administered if 
glucose did not show a value of less than 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) AND symptomatic hypoglycaemia (e.g., 
diaphoresis, confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness, or fatigue) had not been achieved within 45 
minutes after the initial insulin dose. At the investigator’s discretion, individual adaptions with lower and 
higher doses were allowed as clinically indicated. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was: 
• 
to validate the use of single dose oral macimorelin for the diagnosis of AGHD, using the insulin 
tolerance test (ITT) as comparator (non-reference standard) GHST. 
The secondary objective of this study was:  
• 
to characterize the safety profile of single dose oral macimorelin in suspected AGHD subjects. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
There were two co-primary efficacy variables in this study: 
• Percent of Negative Agreement; 
• Percent of Positive Agreement. 
The following cut-off values for stimulated GH levels were used: 
•Macimorelin-GHST: GH: 2.8 ng/mL 
•ITT: GH: 5.1 ng/mL 
A peak GH value below the cut-off value (i.e., < 2.8 or < 5.1, respectively) was considered ‘test 
positive’, a value above the cut-off ‘test negative’. 
The key secondary variables were: 
• 
• 
Percent of overall agreement 
Estimated sensitivity and specificity, of both GHSTs (macimorelin and ITT) when using predefined 
cut-off points of both GHSTs, and derived based on the subjects with high likelihood of having the 
disease and their matching healthy subjects.  
•  Receiver Operator Characteristics ROC based on item 2 above.  
The secondary diagnostic accuracy measure was ‘percent overall agreement’. The accuracy

Safety endpoints: 
Safety endpoints include the following: 
• 
Incidence of TEAEs 
•  Clinical laboratory test results 
•  Vital sign measurements 
• 
Physical examination findings 
Sample size 
At least 55 ‘ITT-positive’ and 55 ‘ITT-negative’ subjects were to complete the crossover. Since it was 
unlikely that the number of ITT-positive and the number of ITT-negative would be equal among the first 
110 subjects with valid tests outcomes, the actual number of subjects needed to complete the study was 
likely to be greater than 110. Among these, about 25% subjects with high likelihood to have the disease 
were to be included as well as matching healthy subjects. 
Randomisation 
The study followed a cross-over design. Subjects were assigned to their respective group bases on risk 
factors for AGHD as described above. Within this procedure, the sequence for the performance of the first 
MAC and the ITT in Group A/B/C subjects was assigned by stratified randomisation. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
There  were  two  primary  efficacy  variables  in  this  study:  'Percent  Negative  Agreement'  and  'Percent 
Positive  Agreement',  using  the  ITT  as  the  comparator  (non-reference  standard).  The  estimated 
percentages of the agreements and the exact two-sided 95% confidence interval (or one-sided 97.5% 
confidence interval) of the percent agreement based on Clopper-Pearson were presented.  
With the planned sample size of 55, the lower bound of the two-sided 95% Clopper-Pearson exact 
confidence interval (or the lower bound of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval) based on an 
observed agreement of 82% would be approximately 70% (69.3%). Based on the above consideration, 
the performance of the GHST with Macimorelin was considered to be acceptable if the lower bound of the 
two-sided 95% confidence interval (or lower bound of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval) for the 
primary efficacy variables was 75% or higher for ‘percent negative agreement’, and 70% or higher for the 
‘percent positive agreement’. 
Estimated  sensitivity  and  specificity,  derived  based  on  the  subjects  with  high  likelihood of  having  the 
disease and their matching healthy subjects. The sensitivity and specificity were estimated treating the 
subjects  with  high  likelihood  of  having  AGHD  as  “true”  diseased  subjects  and  the  matching  healthy 
subjects as “true” non-diseased subjects. Sensitivity, specificity, and two-sided 95% confidence intervals 
of sensitivity and specificity were presented.

Based on the mITT population the primary efficacy and the key secondary efficacy measures (percent 
negative and percent positive agreement) were analyzed by a hierarchical testing procedure with regard 
to the sampling time for the macimorelin test:  
1. Peak GH among all post baseline samples; 
2. Highest GH among 60 and 45 minutes post dose; 
3. GH at 60 minutes post dose; 
4. GH at 45 minutes post dose. 
To control for overall Type I error rate, sufficient agreements for a method can be claimed only when 
sufficient agreements can be claimed for all prior methods, if any. 
The repeatability analysis was based on the mITT population as determined in the core study part, but 
restricted to only those patients/subjects with both macimorelin tests performed.  
The primary efficacy variable for repeatability analysis (difference of the peak GH level following the two 
macimorelin treatments (peak value from the assay repetition [Test 3] – peak value from the first assay 
[Test 1 /Test 2] in the randomized core study part) was summarized by macimorelin test positive and 
negative outcome groups in the core study part and overall. The two-sided 95% confidence intervals of 
the difference were presented. 
Post-hoc analyses 
In January 2017, the results of the planned analyses of the study showed that one of the two co-primary 
endpoints, i.e., positive agreement between the macimorelin GHST (MAC) and the comparator (insulin 
tolerance test; ITT),  was  not met. After  careful review of the study data, the sponsor concluded that 
supplementary analyses of the data could demonstrate that the MAC is a feasible, robust, safe, and highly 
reproducible test to diagnose AGHD, with the potential of being a better means for evaluating a patient 
with suspected AGHD than the ITT.  
Exploratory analyses would also include the hierarchical testing to assess the performance of the assay at 
the recommended GH cut-off point for the different sparse sampling scheme options. The rationale and 
general concept for the different exploratory analyses of the original study data is outlined below. 
The following criteria need to be considered when defining an optimal GH cut-off point for the MAC based 
on the available data:  
•  Percent negative agreement of MAC with ITT should have a lower CI limit above 75%. 
•  Percent positive agreement of MAC with ITT should have a lower CI limit above 70% 
•  Repeatability of the MAC outcome in the core study and in the repeatability study should be 
high. 
•  Sensitivity and specificity of the MAC, as derived from GHST outcome in Group A and Group D 
subjects in the core study should be high. 
•  Due to the exploratory nature of the post-hoc analyses and the overall limited size of the data 
pool,  sensitivity  analyses  should  be  performed  that  exclude  data  from  subjects  in  the  mITT 
population whose data – based on additional information – are very likely invalid and that might 
bias  conclusions  if  not  excluded.  (Data  from  only  one  subject  (RS01-06)  with  apparent 
non-compliance or dosing error in the MAC of the core study were excluded from such analyses) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 44/89 
 
 
 
 
 
•  As the performance characteristics of the MAC assay will depend on the recommended number 
and timing of blood samples for measuring GH serum concentrations, all above criteria should 
also be subjected to the planned hierarchical testing evaluating the different 'sparse sampling' 
scheme options. 
Orientating analyses: In a first part, the performance characteristics of the MAC were calculated for GH 
cut-off points that corresponded to an observed peak GH in a MAC of the core study. For practical reasons, 
the  lower  end  of  the  GH  cut-off  points  was  selected  at  2.21  ng/mL  (the  highest  value  below  the 
pre-defined value of 2.8 ng/mL), and the upper end was selected at 8.31 (an arbitrary value reflecting the 
higher peak GH in the MAC than in the ITT). 
Exploratory analyses: In a second part, the same set of analyses was performed for selected GH cut-off 
points including the pre-defined value of 2.8 ng/mL and evenly spaced values in a 'range of potential 
interest' ranging from 4.6 to 8.1 ng/mL, i.e., 2.80, 4.60, 5.10, 5.60, 6.10, 6.60, 7.10, 7.60, and 8.10 
ng/mL, that includes 5.10 ng/mL as the pre-defined cut-off point for the ITT and 7.10 ng/mL as a value 
reflecting the 1.4-fold higher mean peak GH levels in MACs compared with ITTs. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Out of a total of 238 subjects screened, altogether 166 subjects were enrolled in a total of 25 study 
centres in nine countries (20 centres in Europe and 5 centres in the USA). The safety population (SAF) 
consisted of 157 subjects, who had received at least 1 dose of study drug. Out of these 157 subjects, 17 
subjects did not fulfill the criterion for being included in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, 
i.e., not both GHSTs of the cross-over were evaluable or performed. Thus, 140 subjects formed the mITT: 
38 (27.1%) in Group A, 37 (26.4%) in Group B, 40 (28.6%) in Group C, and 25 (17.9%) in Group D (see 
Figure 1). 34 patients from the mITT were included in the repeatability extension (Amendment no. 1) and 
underwent a repeated MAC (‘Test 3’). 
14 (8.9%) subjects of the SAF prematurely terminated the study, i.e., 2 subjects had withdrawn their 
consent and 12 for other reasons, either because the first ITT was non-evaluable and no test repetition 
was performed or the subjects were not available for the EOS visit. 
Participant flow is presented in Figure 7.

Conduct of the study 
The following major protocol deviations were reported in more than on subject: 
- Informed consent procedures (8 subjects); 
-  Failure  to  take  IGF  –  sample  (1  subject),  Samples  not  shipped  to  the  Lab  and  other  Lab  protocol 
violations (4 subjects); 
- Deviations from controlled samples storage conditions at -20° (6 subjects) ;

Amendments to the study protocol: 
Two versions of the clinical study protocol and two general Amendments to the clinical study protocol 
(Amendment no. 1 (repeatability extension), Amendment no. 2) were implemented. During the study 
approval process, two local Amendments were prepared to comply with requests from the Regulatory 
Authority in France and in Italy, respectively. Amendment no. 2 and country-specific Amendments were 
mainly  related  to  administrative  changes  or  clarification  of  protocol  texts  and  did  not  require  any 
modification of the analyses or the exclusion of data obtained prior to implementation of an Amendment.

Amendment no 1 had been issued for selected sites in Europe to obtain exploratory data on the 
repeatability of the MAC in a subset of subjects that had completed the core study. 
Additional exploratory subgroup analyses were performed to determine if there is a need for different 
cut-off points when considering the following subgroups: 
• Obesity class I: BMI (30.0 - 34.9) 
• Obesity class II: BMI (35.0 – 39.9) 
• Age group 18 to 25 years 
• Gender (male, female).

Numbers analysed 
A total of 140 subjects formed the mITT population and thus were included in the efficacy analysis: 38 
(27.1%) in Group A, 37 (26.4%) in Group B, 40 (28.6%) in Group C, and 25 (17.9%) in Group D. 34 
patients from the mITT were included in the repeatability extension (Amendment no. 1) and experienced 
a repeated MAC (‘Test 3’), i.e., 13 (%) in Group A, 12 (%) in Group B, 9 in Group C (Table 19).

Outcomes and estimation 
Performance of the tests  
Performance of the ITT: In 27 of 157 (17%) subjects, the first performance of the ITT did not provide an 
evaluable result, commonly due to the lack of a confirmed hypoglycemia in venous blood. In 17 of these 
27 (63%) subjects, the ITT was actually repeated, and the outcome of the repeated test was evaluable in 
13 subjects, but was non-evaluable for a second time in 4 of the 17 (24%). Thus, 14 of 27 (52%) of the 
subjects with a non-evaluable first ITT could finally not be included in the mITT due to test performance 
issues with the ITT. In summary, 143 subjects had an evaluable ITT, of whom 3 withdrew before having 
their MAC performed, so that eventually 140 subjects could be included in the mITT. 
Performance of the MAC: Only one of 154 (0.65%) MACs in the core study was non-evaluable and had to 
be repeated. In this case, the site had only collected blood samples for PK but not for GH measurements 
at the initial GHST. 
In the repeatability extension, all 34 MACs were evaluable upon first performance. 
Primary endpoint 
Evaluation of ‘Step 1 - Peak GH level among all post baseline samples’ was the first analysis performed 
according to the hierarchical testing procedure (Table 20). Results are based on samples obtained 30 
minutes after the test was performed. 
Table 20. Peak GH levels in Study AEZS-130-052 (mITT) 
Based on the assessments (positive/negative) for MAC and ITT, the negative agreement was 93.94% and 
the positive agreement was 74.32%, and corresponding 95% Confidence intervals are presented in Table 
21.

Table 21. 95% confidence intervals for negative and positive agreement in Study AEZS-130-052 (mITT) 
One of the two co-primary endpoints did not show sufficient agreement and the target endpoint of this 
study based on the pre-defined cut-off point for macimorelin was not achieved. Consecutively, no 95% 
confidence limits are presented for the other steps of the hierarchical testing procedure. 
Results  were  almost  identical  if  for  the  MAC  the  highest  GH  level  among  45  and  60  min  values  was 
evaluated (data not shown) which was step 2 in hierarchical testing.  
Overall, mean/median peak GH levels correlated well with the likelihood of having AGHD as the highest 
GH values were determined in healthy subjects and patients of Group C, and the lowest GH levels were 
analysed in Group A (Figure 8).

Secondary endpoints 
The percent of overall agreement between MAC and ITT based on the pre-defined macimorelin cut-off 
point is presented below. Since one of the primary endpoints failed to meet the predefined range, these 
calculated confidence intervals are provided for information only. 
Step 1 - Peak GH level among all post baseline samples

Step 2 - Highest GH-level among 60 and 45 minutes post dose 
Step 3 - GH-level at 60 minutes post dose 
Step 4 - GH-level at 45 minutes post dose 
Sensitivity and specificity 
Sensitivity and specificity for both GHSTs were estimated, assuming all high likelihood AGHD subjects of 
Group A as ‘true’ AGHD subjects and all healthy matching subjects of Group D as ‘true’ AGHD negative 
subjects and using the pre-defined cut-off points of 2.8 ng/mL for the MAC and 5.1 ng/mL for the ITT 
(Table 23).  
Table 23. Sensitivity and specificity for MAC and ITT in Group A (n=38) and Group D (n=25) with 95% 
CI in in Study AEZS-130-052 (mITT) 
Results were similar when subjects were excluded from not matched Group A subjects. When using the 
pre-defined  cut-off  points  of  2.8  ng/mL  for  the  MAC  and  5.1  ng/mL  for  the  ITT,  point  estimates  for 
sensitivity ranged from 0.87 to 0.90 for the MAC and from 0.97 to 1.0 for the ITT, depending on the 
inclusion  or  exclusion  of  data  from  not  matched  Group  A  subjects,  respectively.  For  both  GHSTs,  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 52/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
estimated specificity was 0.96, irrespective of the in/exclusion data from not matched Group A subjects. 
All lower 95% confidence limits were in the range of 0.72 to 0.80 for the MAC and in the range of 0.79 to 
0.88 for the ITT. 
Based on the assumptions regarding the “true” disease status, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) 
curves were established to illustrate the dependence of the sensitivity and specificity of both assays as the 
cut-off points of the assays are changed. ROC curves were prepared for the MAC (Figure 10) and the ITT 
and show the results for growth hormone for all subjects of Group A and Group D and for all subjects of 
Group A and matching Group D subjects.

The effect of varying the GH cut-off point for the MAC on the point estimates and lower 95% confidence 
intervals of the estimated sensitivity and specificity is illustrated in Figures 11 and 12 respectively.

The comparison of MAC performance in the sub-population with a BMI > 35 kg/m2 (N=15), the sub- 
population with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 (N=41) and the mITT (N=139) is presented in Table 28.

* One subject was excluded due to a compliance error 
Ancillary analyses 
Exploratory analyses based on post hoc changes in the definition of the cut-off point 
The  performance  characteristics  of  the  MAC  calculated  for  GH  cut-off  points  that  corresponded  to  an 
observed peak GH in a MAC of the core study are summarised in Table 29.  
For practical reasons, the lower end of the GH cut-off points was selected at 2.21 ng/mL (the highest 
value below the pre-defined value of 2.8 ng/mL), and the upper end was selected at 8.31 (an arbitrary 
value reflecting the higher peak GH in the MAC than in the ITT).  
These results are based on the complete modified intention-to-treat (mITT) data set, but exclude data 
from one subject in whom no macimorelin levels were found after dosing. Since formally being a valid 
data set, this subject was included in the mITT analysis of Study 052 (N=140), but was excluded as a 
blatant compliance error in the present exploratory analysis (N=139).

The bolded frame in the table indicates the range of GH cut-off points in  which multiple performance 
characteristics match the favorable criteria for the exploratory analyses as defined above (methods, post 
hoc amendments).  
Another exploratory analysis on the performance of the MAC cut-off point of 2.8 ng/mL (as pre-defined in 
Study 052) based on an INTT cut-off point of 3.0 ng/mL as recommended by The European consensus 
guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with GH deficiency II (Ho et al, 2007) is presented in 
Table 30.

Table 30. Agreement, repeatability, and sensitivity and specificity explored for INTT GH cut-off points 
“3.0 ng/mL” based on peak GH values in MAC 
The results for agreement between MAC and ITT in the group of patients with intermediate likelihood of 
having disease for the two different cut-off points is shown in Table 31. 
A patient based analysis for discrepant results was also provided by the applicant.  In 3 cases with 
discrepant test outcome, the disagreement between both GHSTs can be attributed with high likelihood to 
a failure of either test. When taking the subjects' medical background into account, an ITT failure 
appeared as a reasonable alternative among other potential reasons for the disagreement in 4 additional 
cases.  
In 6 cases, the increase in the cut-off point from 2.8 to 5.1 ng/mL leads to 'positive agreement', i.e., to 
the agreement of the MAC in an ITT-positive subject, and the new agreement would be (more) consistent 
with the clinical background. In one ITT-negative subject, the revised cut-off point would convert the 
previously negative agreement into negative disagreement. Considering the clinical background in this 
subject with an a priori low likelihood of having AGHD, it is unlikely that a MAC positive classification at a 
GH peak of 4.88 ng/mL would be considered as a strong argument to start or continue GH replacement 
treatment solely based on this test result. 
It should be noted that in 10 ITT-positive subjects with test-negative macimorelin GHST, the peak GH in 
the ITT ranged between 3 ng/mL and 5.1 ng/mL, i.e. the peak GH release was above the previously used 
GH cut-off point for the ITT of 3 ng/mL (e.g., Ho 2007). In other words, these subjects had a residual 
release of GH that would often be referred to as GH Insufficiency (GHI).

Table 31. Estimated sensitivity (= positive agreement with ITT) and estimated specificity (= negative 
agreement with ITT) of MAC in AGHD likelihood Groups B and C for GH cut-off points of 2.8 ng/mL and 5.1 
ng/mL 
Among the subjects in whom the 'superior' stimulation in the MAC resulted in higher peak GH levels, one 
subject  experienced , up to 10-fold higher peak GH values in the MAC which could be explained by the 
subject's medical history: idiopathic forms of childhood onset GHD are suspected often to be caused by a 
hypothalamic  dysfunction,  so  that  the  GH  response  to  MAC  seems  to  indicate  the  'normal'  pituitary 
function. 
Discordant results between INTT and GHRH induced growth hormone secretion have been observed in the 
literature in about 50% of cases among hyperprolactinemic patients (Beentjes 1996). 
From the mITT population of Study 052, altogether nine patients showed a hyperprolactinemia in their 
medical history, and for six of those the disease was reported as ongoing. When reviewing the INTT and 
MAC outcomes, only one case was found with a positive INTT outcome versus a negative MAC outcome. 
Three other patients were identified with positive agreement between INTT and MAC, and four further 
patients were observed with negative agreement between INTT and MAC. 
Furthermore, six patients were identified in the Study 052 mITT population with elevated prolactin levels 
at study baseline. Using an INTT cut-off point of 3.0 ng/mL and a MAC cut-off point of 2.8 ng/mL, five 
patients were found with positive agreement between INTT and MAC.

Endpoints and 
definitions 
Co-Primary 
endpoints 
There were two co-primary efficacy variables 
in this study: 
• Percent of Negative Agreement; 
• Percent of Positive Agreement. 
The following cut-off values for stimulated GH 
levels were used: 
•Macimorelin-GHST: GH: 2.8 ng/mL 
•ITT: GH: 5.1 ng/mL 
The primary efficacy measures (negative and 
positive 
agreement, 
respectively)  were 
analyzed  by  a  hierarchical  testing  procedure 
with  regard  to  the  sampling  time  for  the 
macimorelin test: 
1. Peak GH among all post baseline samples 
2. Highest GH among 60 and 45 minutes post 
dose 
3. GH at 60 minutes post dose 
4. GH at 45 minutes post dose 
Per  Amendment  no.  1,  the  primary  efficacy 
variable for the repeatability extension was the 
comparison  of  peak  GH  levels  following 
repeated treatments with macimorelin 
The secondary diagnostic accuracy measure 
was ‘percent overall agreement’.

Notes 
Results were almost identical if for the MAC the highes GH level among 
45 and 60 min values was evaluated (step 2 in hierarchical testing). 
Due to the failure to achieve the predefined non-inferiority margin for 
positive agreement, step 2 – 4 of the hierarchical testing procedure 
regarding time points of assessment for MAC was not performed.

Repeatability assessment for MAC GHST 
Mean results were overall about 0.5. – 1.0 ng/mL lower in the second test, 
whereas median levels tended to be slightly higher.  No significant differences 
were found between peak GH and GH concentrations measured in the core 
study and in the repeatability extension. There was 100% negative agreement 
(79.41; 100.00), positive agreement was lower: 88.89 (65.29; 98.62).

Clinical studies in special populations 
No specific trials were presented in special populations e.g. with renal failure, hepatic failure or the 
elderly. In Study AEZS-130-047 (see Supportive study below), 19% of the subjects were aged >65 years 
and 6% were aged >75 years. In the pivotal Study AEZS-130-052, 2% were aged between 65 and 70 
years. 
Supportive study 
Study  AEZS-130-047:    A multi-centre study investigating a new, oral growth hormone secretagogue 
(GHS) (Macimorelin acetate) as a growth hormone (GH) stimulation test in terms of safety and efficacy. 
The study was originally designed as an open label, multicentre, randomized, two-way, crossover study (
≥ 1 week washout) in subjects with: 
•  Confirmed AGHD, diagnosed by GHRH-ARG (peak GH < 4.1 μg/L) in adulthood 
OR 
•  Multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies in ≥ 3 hormones (from thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH], 
adrenocorticotropic  hormone  [ACTH],  gonadotrophin  releasing  hormone  [GnRH],  or  arginine 
vasopressin  [AVP])  and  low  IGF-1  concentration  (below  limit  of  normal,  using  age  and 
sex-adjusted normal ranges) 
•  Normal  controls,  matched  for  age,  gender,  body  mass  index  (BMI)  and  estrogen  status  for 
females 
Each subject was to receive the following, in random order while fasting, at least 1 week apart: 
•  GHRH (Geref Diagnostic, Serono) intravenous (IV) bolus of 1 μg/kg + L-ARG (Ar-Gine®, Pfizer) 
IV infusion of 30 g over 30 minutes 
•  Macimorelin 0.5 mg/kg, given in oral solution of 0.5 mg/mL 
The original protocol called for exposure to both GHRH-ARG and macimorelin for 40 AGHD patients and 40 
matched (age, gender, BMI, oestrogen status) normal controls. At the time of the study termination by 
the initial sponsor, 42 AGHD patients and 10 matched controls had completed the crossover treatments. 
When the study was resumed, it was a Phase III, multi-center, open-label study of approximately 100 
subjects. Geref (GHRH) was withdrawn from the US market in 2008 and therefore, no comparative agent 
was available. 
Thirty (30) normal control subjects matching the AGHD patients who completed the original protocol were 
to be enrolled under the amended protocol as well as 20 additional subjects (10 AGHD patients and 10 
matched, normal control subjects). Newly enrolled AGHD patients had GH deficiency confirmed using one 
of the following stimulation tests and with the following cut-points: 
• 
• 
L-ARG + GHRH (cut-point 4.1 μg/L)  
ITT (cut-point 5.0 μg/L)  
•  Glucagon (cut-point 3.0 μg/L)  
•  Arginine (cut-point 0.4 μg/L) OR  
•  Multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (MPHD) with deficiencies in ≥ 3 hormones (including TSH, 
ACTH, GnRH, and/or AVP).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 64/89 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients who qualified for the study based on MPHD criteria must also have had low IGF-1 (defined as 
below the lower limit of normal for age and sex-adjusted normal range for IGF-1). 
Fasting patients and matched control subjects were treated with a single dose of macimorelin 0.5 mg/kg, 
given in an oral solution of 0.35 mg/mL in the morning. Subjects enrolled under Amendment No. 3 and 
thereafter  received  only  macimorelin  because  L-ARG+GHRH  was  no  longer  available;  therefore,  the 
crossover aspect of the design and randomization were not applicable. 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the mITT analysis set. The mITT analysis set consisted of all 
intent-to-treat subjects that received macimorelin and had at least one GH measurement between 45 and 
75 minutes posttreatment. 
The per protocol set (PPS) included all patients from the mITT without major protocol violations. 
The safety population (safety analysis set) included all subjects who received at least one dose of study 
medication and for whom any safety information was available. 
- The primary efficacy variable was the peak GH concentration for each subject following treatment with 
macimorelin. The GH concentrations were determined by ICMA assay. 
The diagnostic accuracy of macimorelin was established if the ROC AUC was greater than 0.85. This was 
tested with α=0.01 using the one sided hypotheses: 
H0: AUC ≤ 0.85 vs, HA: AUC > 0.85 
The null hypothesis was rejected in favour of the alternative if the lower bound of the one-sided 99 % 
confidence interval (CI) on the AUC was greater than 0.85. 
The basis for truth for the ROC analysis was the patient or control status of the subject. By definition, the 
patients were proven AGHD subjects by meeting entry criteria. Patients without confirmed AGHD were 
identified as having a major protocol deviation and excluded from the PPS. The ROC curve was created by 
plotting  the  true  positive  fraction  (TPF  or  sensitivity)  versus  the  false  positive  fraction  (FPF  or 
1-specificity) determined by moving the cut-point value along the peak GH concentration range. 
Overall,  53  AGHD  patients  and  48  matched  control  subjects  were  enrolled  and  all  subjects,  with  the 
exception  of  1  AGHD  patient,  received  macimorelin  and  completed the  study.  The  AGHD  patient  who 
discontinued did so due to collapsed veins. This patient received L-ARG + GHRH before discontinuing. 
Among the 52 AGHD patients, 46 (88.5 %) had matched control subjects based on all three criteria (age, 
BMI,  sex/estrogen  status).  Additionally,  2  patient-matched  control  pairs  were  matched  on  two  of  the 
three  criteria  (age  and  sex/estrogen  status).  Thus,  overall,  there  were  48  complete  AGHD/control 
matched pairs. Four AGHD patients (7.7 %) had no matched control subject. Two AGHD subjects who 
were major protocol deviations, i.e. did not meet entry criteria for confirmed AGHD, were not matched. 
The other two AGHD patients who were not matched had high BMI (34.8 and 55.7 kg/m2), were of a 
young age, and on estrogen therapy (one oral, one transdermal). 
A summary of the demographic and baseline characteristics for all subjects is presented in Table 33.

Table 34. Mean peak growth hormone concentration (ng/mL) following macimorelin administration in in

The diagnostic accuracy of macimorelin was considered to be established if the lower bound of the 1-sided 
99 % CI for the ROC AUC, as found by bootstrapping the data with 10,000 samples, was greater than 
0.85. This criterion was met in the per protocol analysis set since the lower bound of the 1-sided 99 % CI 
was 0.8502. The lower bound of the 1-sided 99 % CI was 0.835 in the mITT analysis set and did not meet 
the pre-established ROC AUC criterion.

was  81% in the mITT and 82 % in the PPS and specificity 92 % in both analysis sets.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Results from two studies were submitted to support the application. 
Study  047 was a multicentre (U.S. only) open label study that was originally designed (by the initial 
sponsor) as a cross-over trial of oral macimorelin (0.5 mg/kg) vs. GHRH (Geref Diagnostic, Serono) IV 
bolus (1 μg/kg) + arginine (Ar-Gine, Pfizer) IV infusion (30 g) over 30 minutes in AGHD patients and in 
matched controls. After 43 AGHD patients and 10 matched controls had been enrolled (of which 42 AGHD 
patients and 10 matched controls had received macimorelin), Geref Diagnostic was withdrawn worldwide

in 2008. Subsequently, Aeterna Zentaris as the new sponsor had to revise the design of the study. The 
study was completed by testing 10 more AGHD patients and 38 matched controls with macimorelin alone.  
The primary analysis as defined when the study design had to be changed was the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (ROC) analysis that is based on a reliable knowledge regarding the disease state of 
the subjects. However, some subjects were included despite not meeting the inclusion criteria, or had 
been misclassified. Furthermore, the disease status could not be verified in all of the subjects since source 
data were not available and patients were categorized as having disease based on one test.  For patients 
at an intermediate baseline probability of having AGHD this is not in line with current practice, where two 
tests  are  recommended  as  part  of  the  clinical  assessment.  Taken  these  issues  together,  there  is 
considerable doubt that the ROC analyses could yield reliable results.  
Study  052  is  considered the  pivotal  Phase  III  study.  It  was  an  open-label,  randomized,  multicentre, 
multinational, 2-way crossover study. The primary objective was to validate the use of single dose oral 
macimorelin (0.5 mg/kg) as growth hormone stimulation test (GHST) for the diagnosis of AGHD, using 
the insulin tolerance test (ITT) as comparator GHST.  
166 subjects were enrolled in a total of 25 study centres in nine countries in order to include at least 55 
‘ITT-positive’  and  55  ‘ITT-negative’  test  outcomes.  In  addition  to  subjects  with  different  likelihood  of 
having  AGHD  (Group  A:  high;  Group  B:  intermediate,  and  Group  C:  low),  20-25  healthy  subjects 
matching  a  Group  A  subject  were  to  be  included  (Group  D).  Following  an  amendment  to  the  study 
protocol, which was implemented as an extension to the core study in selected European sites only, the 
repeatability of the MAC in a sub-set of about 30 suspected AGHD subjects was also investigated. 
The safety population (SAF) consisted of 157 subjects, who had received at least 1 dose of study drug. Of 
these 143 had an evaluable ITT, but as 3 subjects withdrew before having their MAC performed, the mITT 
was comprised of 140 subjects: 38 (27.1%) in Group A, 37 (26.4%) in Group B, 40 (28.6%) in Group C, 
and 25 (17.9%) in Group D. 34 patients from the mITT were included in the repeatability extension 
For  the  evaluation  of  the  GHST,  blood  samples  were  collected  pre-dose,  30,  45,  60,  and  90  minutes 
post-dose. Cut-off values for the macimorelin stimulation test (MAC) were derived from the results of 
study 047. The ITT a cut-off point of 5.1 ng/mL was also predefined and had been accepted by the CMHP 
during  a  scientific  advice  procedure,  even  though  it  is  higher  than  the  cut-off  point  proposed  by  a 
consensus guideline (3.0 ng/mL Ho et al., 2007).  
Overall, the size, design and cut-off values for the MAC were considered appropriate to evaluate the use 
of single dose oral macimorelin as a GHST for the diagnosis of AGHD. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 047 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  based  on  the  mITT.  The  diagnostic  accuracy  of  macimorelin  was 
considered to be established if the lower bound of the 1-sided 99% CI for the ROC AUC was greater than 
0.85. The lower bound of the 1-sided 99% CI was 0.835 in the mITT analysis set and did not meet the 
predefined ROC AUC criterion. Therefore, the study failed its primary goal. The criterion however was met 
in  the  per  protocol  analysis  (99%  CI  0.8502).  Moreover  due  to  classification  issues  for  some  of  the 
patients, the data from this study cannot be considered robust. However, as data for GH stimulation were 
compared to disease status of the patients, the CHMP considered that the results of the study could be 
used as a hypothesis generating database for further investigations.

Based on this study, the applicant defined a cut-off value of 2.8 ng/mL for the MAC for the pivotal trial 
052.  Based  on  information  on  the  comparability  of  the  assays  used  for  determination  of  GH  plasma 
concentration in both studies, use of this cut-off value in the pivotal study was considered acceptable. 
Study 052 
The lower limit of the 95% CIs for the negative agreement was 85.20% and thus conformed to the pre-set 
criterion of 75% for this parameter. Positive agreement of MAC with ITT was 74.32%, with a lower limit 
of 62.84% for the 95% CIs, which did not match the predefined criterion of ≥ 70 % for this parameter. 
Results  were  almost  identical  if  for  the  MAC  the  highest  GH  level  among  45  and  60  min  values  was 
evaluated (step 2 in the hierarchical testing). 
Since one of the co-primary endpoints failed to achieve the pre-defined margins, the study formally is a 
failed study. Not achieving the goal for positive agreement indicates that the MAC, using the pre-defined 
cut-point of 2.8 ng/mL, is more conservative in diagnosing disease and highly specific and thus avoids 
unnecessary treatment of patients with a wrong positive test result. As stated by the CHMP during the 
scientific  advice  procedure  for  this  product,  this  is  the  key  attribute  that  is  expected  from  a  GHST. 
Therefore, failing in the positive agreement with the ITT is a direct consequence of a test designed to 
confirm AGHD.  
Negative  and  positive  agreement  between  MAC  and  the  ITT  in  subjects  with  intermediate  or  low  risk 
(Groups  B  and  C)  were  93%  and  61%  with  lower  95%  confidence  interval  bounds  80%  and  43%, 
respectively.  These  results  were  based  on  peak  GH  values  (maximum  GH  concentrations  across  all 
measurement time-points). Peak GH levels were inversely related to the likelihood of having AGHD, i.e., 
the subjects assigned to the intermediate likelihood (Group B) had lower GH levels than subjects assigned 
to the low likelihood (Group C). This observation is consistent with published data showing that peak GH 
levels are inversely related to the number of pituitary deficiencies (Lisset 1999, Hartman 2002). 
Overall agreement was 83.57 % (76.38: 89.29, 95% CI) when the peak GH level was used with similar 
results for Step 2 and 3 (Highest GH-level among 60 and 45 minutes/ 60 minutes post dose respectively) 
and slightly lower overall agreement was observed for step 4  (GH-level at 45 minutes post dose). 
Sensitivity and specificity were defined as follows: Sensitivity: Probability that the test result is positive 
given the subject has the disease. Specificity: Probability that the test result is negative given the subject 
does not have the disease. 
Sensitivity and specificity for both GHSTs were estimated, assuming all high likelihood AGHD subjects of 
Group A as ‘true’ AGHD subjects and all healthy matching subjects of Group D as ‘true’ AGHD negative 
subjects:  
For MAC the result for sensitivity was 0.87 (0.72; 0.96) and for specificity 0.96 (0.80; 1.00), both of which 
are considered acceptable for a diagnostic tool, especially in the absence of a real standard of truth. 
Repeatability assessment (MAC Test 3) was performed in a subgroup of 34 subjects of the mITT. Only in 
2 of the 34 subjects discrepant results were observed using the predefined cut-off point of 2.8 ng/mL. 
Although there was no statistically significant difference, the mean results were at almost all time points 
about 0.5. – 1.0 ng/mL lower in the MAC Test 3 whereas median levels tended to be slightly higher. The 
results  support  the  conclusion  that  the  test  using  the  predefined  cut-offs  is  quite  robust  and 
intra-individual variability is not an issue of concern.

The CHMP recommended that the proposed indication by the applicnat for the evlaution of the pituitary 
gland secretion of growth hormone should be modified to: diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) 
in adults to better reflect the ability of the test to confirm AGHD. 
At higher cut-off levels (4.74 – 5.20 and 4.74 – 5.90 for peak GH values with/without one subject with a 
compliance  issue)  there  was  a  mild  decrease  in  negative  agreement,  an  improvement  in  positive 
agreement, a mild improvement in overall agreement and a mild decrease in overall agreement in the 
repeatability assessment, when comparing MAC and ITT. Based on these analyses the applicant proposed 
to use a post-hoc defined cut-off of 5.1 ng/m. This was not considered to be appropriate. It is unclear, 
whether such post-hoc defined cut-offs remain valid in a prospective trial. Furthermore, data indicate that 
in the MAC repeatability study the overall agreement tends to be slightly better with the predefined cut-off 
value  than  with  the  post-hoc  proposed  range.  With  higher  cut-off  values  more  patients  will  receive 
treatment. In particular in group B and C with intermediate and low risk for disease respectively, it was 
not obvious that a change in the classification based on post hoc cut-offs was in fact a change to the 
better, when analysing the data on an individual basis. Furthermore, it is conceivable that when using a 
lower cut-off for the ITT possibly positive agreement might have been higher. This was confirmed in an 
exploratory  analysis  using  a  cut-point  of  3  ng/mL  (as  recommended  by  the  European  Society  of 
Endocrinology),  which  yielded  results  for  the  two  primary  efficacy  endpoints  that  met  the  predefined 
margins for positive and negative agreement. The estimates for negative and positive agreement were 
95% and 86% with lower 95% confidence interval bounds 87% and 75%, respectively. Repeatability was 
97%.  Point  estimates  for  sensitivity  and  specificity  were  87%  and  96%  from  not  matched  Group  A 
subjects, respectively. 
Instead of changing the cut-off value for MAC based on post hoc analyses, the CHMP considered that the 
predefined value should be maintained in order to avoid overtreatment as results from this study have 
established that a maximally stimulated serum GH level of less than 2.8 ng/mL (at the 45, 60 and 90 
minutes timepoints) following macimorelin administration confirms a diagnosis of adult growth hormone 
deficiency. As with all GH stimulation tests, also the macimorelin test results should always be interpreted 
in the context if the  outcome of all examinations within the diagnostic work-up for a patient.  
Published literature and pathophysiological considerations suggest that discordant results between the 
two  GHST  in  patients  with  hyperprolactinemia  may  arise  due  to  their  different  mode/site  of  actions. 
However,  this  was  not  confirmed  in  study  052.  Only  one  out  of  9  patients  with  a  history  of 
hyperprolactinemia and one out of 6 patients with elevated prolactin levels at study baseline in study 052 
had discordant results with the two tests. However, since the information from study 052 on this issue is 
limited  and  cannot  definitely  rule  out  the  possibility  of  discrepant  results  in  some  patients  with 
hyperprolactinemia,  the  applicant  should  continue  to  gather  information  from  publications  or  other 
reports and be prepared to revise the section on discrepant results in case new evidence accumulates 
suggesting that hyperprolactinemia may differentially affect MAC and ITT. 
Analyses of patients included in study 052 with a BMI between 35 and 40 kg/m2 showed consistently 
negative test results for ITT and MAC in patients with a low pre-Test probability for disease, consistently 
positive results for patients with very high pre-test probability and a discrepant result in only one of the 
patients  with  intermediate  pre  Test  probability  for  disease.  Whereas  these  data  suggest  that  the  test 
performance of MAC and ITT in these patients is largely similar this does not entirely exclude a higher risk 
for false positive test results in obese subjects since stimulated GH release is generally lower in patients 
with higher BMI. No patients with a BMI >40 kg/m2 had been included in the pivotal trial and therefore a 
statement has been included in the SmPC that the safety and diagnostic performance of macimorelin have 
not been established for patients with BMI > 40 kg/m2 
Assessment report

Based  on  the  exclusion  criteria  in  study  052  and  recommendations  in  European  Guidelines  on  the 
diagnosis  and  treatment  of  AGHD,    patients  on  replacement  therapy  with  growth  hormone  (GH, 
somatotropin) or on medicinal products directly affecting the pituitary secretion of somatotropin (e.g. 
somatostatin analogues, clonidine, levopoda and dopamine agonists) should be advised to discontinue 
such treatment at least 1 month before receiving a test dose of macimorelin. Exogenous GH or medicinal 
products directly affecting the pituitary gland could influence the somatotropic function of the pituitary 
gland and lead to unreliable GH stimulation results.   
In addition, patients with a deficiency affecting hormones other than GH (e.g. adrenal, thyroidal and/or 
gonadal insufficiency, diabetes insipidus) should be adequately replaced with the other deficient 
hormones before any testing for a deficiency of GH stimulation is performed, to exclude a stimulation 
failure. 
Finally, as hypercortisolism has a significant impact on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the 
diagnostic performance of the test may by affected in patients with Cushing’s disease or on 
supra-physiologic glucocorticoid therapy (e.g. systemic administration of doses of hydrocortisone (or its 
equivalent) in excess of 15 mg/m2/day) and lead to false positive test results.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The totality of data indicates that MAC at the proposed dose is a valuable diagnostic tool for adult patients 
suspected to have AGHD, even if one of the pre-defined criteria of acceptability for the performance of the 
GHST with macimorelin was not met in the pivotal trial. When using a GH cut-off of 2.8 ng/mL, as derived 
from study 047 the macimorelin test can reliably confirm a diagnosis of AGHD. The choice of this cut-off 
point  was  further  supported  by  a  post-hoc  analysis  that  used  a  cut-point  for  the  ITT  of  3.0  ng/mL. 
Avoiding unnecessary therapy with GH is a key goal of a diagnostic method in AGHD, which is information 
that can be derived from the MAC. 
The CHMP recommended that since there is at least a theoretical concern of a differential influence of 
hyperprolactinemia on the ITT compared to the MAC which cannot be entirely excluded by the available 
data  the  applicant  should  continue  to  monitor  this  issue  (e.g.  based  on  publications  or  spontaneous 
reports) and update the product information if needed in the future. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
During the clinical development, a total of 377 subjects have been exposed to macimorelin summarised 
in Table 35.  
Table 35. Exposure to macimorelin in clinical trials 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 71/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of  the  399  subjects  included  into  the  safety  analysis,  22  did  not  receive  macimorelin,    (9  from 
AEZS-130-IIT, 7 from Study AEZS-130-054 and 1 from Study AEZS-130-055 received only placebo, 3 
from Study AEZS-130-052 withdrew after the insulin tolerance test without receiving macimorelin, and 2 
subjects from Study AEZS-130-055 received only moxifloxacin).  
The  safety  of  macimorelin  in  the  proposed  indication  is  based  on  two  clinical  efficacy  studies 
(AEZS-130-047 and AEZS-130-052), comprising a total of 254 subjects exposed to an oral dose of 0.5 
mg/kg. Among the subjects in the diagnostic studies, 70% were enrolled as (suspected) AGHD patients, 
30%  as  healthy  control  subjects;  60%  of  the  population  were  male  and  the  82%  were  Caucasians 
(“white”); mean age was 45.5 years and mean BMI 29.4 kg/m2. 
Adverse events 
In the Phase 3 studies (047 and 052), 126 AEs occurred in 27% of subjects following the Macimorelin GH 
stimulation test compared with 761 AEs in 96.2% of subjects following insulin tolerance test (ITT). 
For the Macimorelin GH stimulation test, dysgeusia was the most frequent adverse event with a total 
incidence of 7%. This high rate of dysgeusia was mainly due to a high reporting rate during the first part 
of Study 047. After changing to a taste masking formulation a lower incidence of dysgeusia was observed 
during the second part of Study 047 and in Study 052. All other adverse events for macimorelin, including 
dizziness, headache, fatigue, hunger, diarrhea and nausea, were reported at incidences of 3% or lower. 
Table 36 summarizes the reported adverse events of the Macimorelin GH Stimulation Test vs. ITT based 
on the reporter's classification of the causal relationship as possible, likely/ probable or certain.

No deaths were reported during clinical studies with macimorelin. 
Serious adverse events 
One patient from Study AEZS-130-047 experienced two AEs that were classified as serious., ECG T wave 
abnormalities and ECG QT interval prolongation observed simultaneously in a 38-year-old male and were 
judged as likely related to macimorelin.  
In Study AEZS-130-052 one subject was hospitalized due to a broken arm (PT: Upper limb fracture). This 
SAE was regarded to not be caused by the study medication or any concomitant medication.  
Other significant adverse events 
ECG related parameters 
ECG related adverse events occurred in 7 of 254 subjects (2.76%) exposed to an oral macimorelin dose 
of 0.5 mg/kg during the clinical studies 047 and 052 (including the patient who experienced the serious 
ECG abnormalities see Table 37).

trials. 
The  effects of oral macimorelin on cardiac safety was also evaluated in a study AEZS-130-055. 
AEZS-130-055 
AEZS-130-055 was a thorough QT study to evaluate the effects of oral macimorelin on cardiac safety 
parameters in healthy male and female subjects. It was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 
three-period crossover study with moxifloxacin as positive control. 
60 healthy non-smoking, volunteers were included (36 males, 24 females); ECGs were evaluated from 57 
subjects (33 males, 24 females). Subjects were hospitalized from Day -1 until after completion of the 
24-hour assessments (morning of Day 2) if there were no safety issues. From 1 hour prior to dosing until 
24 hours after dosing a continuous Holter ECG was recorded from which the 12 lead standard ECGs were 
extracted. 
Each subject received a single oral dose of 2 mg/kg macimorelin as an oral solution, a 400 mg tablet 
moxifloxacin and placebo solution in randomized order. 
Primary  parameter  was  QTcF  (heart  rate  corrected  QT  interval  using  Fridericia’s  formula)  which  was 
measured  from  standard  10  second  12  lead  digital  electrocardiograms  extracted  in  triplicates  from 
continuous Holter ECG recordings. The time points for the 10 second 12-lead ECG extractions matched

those of the blood sampling for determination of PK parameters. Other parameters included the intervals 
PR, QRS, RR as well as HR and ECG morphological variables. PK parameters were also assessed.

dose (0.5 mg/kg), at its maximum plasma exposure (9.24 ng/mL), is only 3.7 ms (mean upper 95% CI: 
5.5 ms).   
An analysis, investigating changes in the T wave segments JTpc and TpTe, showed a borderline effect on 
the baseline and placebo corrected JTpc at 3 hours post-dose (mean effect 8.35 ms, upper 95% CI 10.43 
ms). 
None of the ECGs in this study exhibited Type 1 or Type 2 Brugada patterns.  A Brugada Type 3 ECG 
pattern was reported in one subject, in all ECGs including pre-dose ECG, and is therefore unlikely to be 
macimorelin related.  
Results of cardiologist evaluation 
A  cardiologist  interpreted  one  randomly  selected  ECG  at  each  time  point.  The  ECGs  were  presented 
one-by-one  blinded  to  treatment.  The  ECGs  additionally  were  presented  in  random  order  to  the 
cardiologist and with no comparison to baseline. Findings from this evaluation are presented in Table 39.

9 subjects were reported to present Brugada Type 3 ECG pattern at multiple study time points, 4 of which 
were already present at baseline. The observed rates of Brugada Type 3 ECG pattern were similar 
between the macimorelin, moxifloxacin and placebo groups (4, 7 and 7, respectively). 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory changes observed in hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis parameters during clinical 
studies were not considered clinically meaningful or related to macimorelin. 
The effects of macimorelin on various hormones during the clinical studies were as follow: 
•   ARD-0705-003: The highest mean concentrations of IGF-1 were observed at the latest measured 
time point (24 hours post-dose) and followed the same pattern as GH, i.e., higher concentrations of 
IGF-1  were  observed  after  administration  of  macimorelin  without  food  than  when  administered 
with food. 
•   AEZS-130-IIT-1: The AUC, Cmax and tmax were compared for the effect of placebo, IV GHRH or 
0.5 mg/kg oral macimorelin on plasma levels of the following hormones: ACTH, cortisol, ghrelin, 
glucose, insulin and prolactin. Macimorelin marginally increased circulating levels of ACTH, cortisol 
and prolactin but this increase was not statistically significant. No effects on blood levels of ghrelin, 
glucose and insulin were observed. 
•   AEZS-130-047: There was a slight, but not clinically meaningful, decrease in mean IGF-1 in both 
AGHD patients and matched controls following macimorelin oral administration. 
•   AEZS-130-052: The effects of macimorelin on other hormones than GH were not assessed. 
•   AEZS-130-054:  No  systematic  changes  in  TSH,  ACTH,  cortisol  or  prolactin  have  been  observed 
following dosing with macimorelin. 
•  AEZS-130-055: The effects of macimorelin on hormones were not assessed.

Safety in special populations 
In clinical studies, macimorelin has not been administered to children or subjects with renal or hepatic 
impairment. 
In Study AEZS-130-047, 19% of the subjects were aged >65 years and 6% were aged >75 years. 
In Study AEZS-130-052, 2% were aged between 65 and 70 years (see Table 16).  
No  overall  differences  in  safety  were  observed  between  these  subjects  and  younger  subjects  when 
administered oral macimorelin at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No clinical data are available as drug-drug interaction studies with macimorelin have not been conducted.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No adverse events suspected to be related to macimorelin were reported leading to study (or study drug) 
discontinuation or dose reduction.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of macimorelin in the proposed indication is mostly based on two phase 3 studies in which 
dysgeusia was reported as the most frequent adverse event with a total incidence of 7% followed by 
headache (3%), diarrhea (3%) and hunger, fatigue, dizziness and nausea (each 2%). Most of these AEs 
were of mild or moderate intensity.  
ECG related adverse events occurred in 7 of 254 subjects (2.76%) exposed to an oral macimorelin dose 
of 0.5 mg/kg during the clinical studies AEZS-130-047 and AEZS-130-052.  
There  were  two  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  in  study  AEZS-130-047  judged  as  likely  related  to 
macimorelin, reported simultaneously in one subject. They consisted of ECG related parameters, namely 
T wave abnormalities and QT prolongation.  
A  thorough  QT  (TQT)  study  was  conducted  with  a  4-fold  supra-diagnostic  dose  of  macimorelin. 
Furthermore,  ECG  was  recorded  after  dosing  in  a  PK/PD  study.    Results  from  these  studies  were 
consistent. In the TQT study, a QTC interval prolongation was observed peaking between 3 and 4 hours 
after dosing and steadily declining thereafter. The peak QTc prolongation was around 10 ms on average 
with 2.0 mg/kg macimorelin; the same effect was observed in Study 054 at the intended diagnostic dose 
of 0.5 mg/kg. The peak of QTc prolongation ((≈3.5 h) did not coincide with Tmax of macimorelin (≈1 h). 
This  suggests  that  macimorelin  may  need  time  to  penetrate  into  the  heart  and/or  that  macimorelin’s 
effect  on  QTc  prolongation  depends  on  accumulation  of  the  drug  in  cardiac  tissue,  reaching  higher 
concentrations with time than in plasma. 
No relationship was demonstrated between macimorelin administration and Brugada ECG patterns. None 
of the ECGs in Study 054 and Study 055 exhibited Type 1 or Type 2 Brugada patterns.  The observed rates 
of Brugada Type 3 ECG patterns were similar in the macimorelin group compared with the active 
(moxifloxacin) and placebo control groups in the TQT study. Only Type 1 Brugada ECG pattern has been 
associated with malignant cardiac arrhythmia and risk of sudden cardiac death (Benito 2009). Type 2 and 
Assessment report

3 ECG patterns are not considered to be diagnostic of the Brugada syndrome (Antzelevitch 2005) and 
Type 3 pattern can easily be confused with other normal variants (e.g., early repolarisation and 
incomplete right bundle brunch block).  
In vitro studies were also performed to address potential inhibition of cardiac hERG and Nav1.5 channels 
both after short and prolonged administration of macimorelin (see Non-clinical section of this report). 
Macimorelin did not inhibit these channels at micro-molar concentrations and therefore it is unlikely to 
have a torsadogenic effect or to be able to induce Brugada-like arrhythmias. 
The mechanism of action for the clinically observed ECG changes however remains unclear. Macimorelin 
metabolites  which  have  not  been  characterized  or  indirect  effects  (e.g.  crosstalk/coupling  of  the 
intracellular signalling pathway of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor with cardiac ion 
channels) could have a role on these effects.  The applicant is therefore recommended to further explore 
the  mechanism  for  the  delayed  QTc-prolonging  effect  of  macimorelin,  e.  g.  by  performing  studies  of 
macimorelin metabolites on hERG and Nav1.5 currents or by investigating indirect effects of macimorelin 
on these currents. 
Overall, however the cardiac safety of a single dose administration of oral macimorelin (0.5 mg/kg) 
performed in patients not at particular risk in an in- or outpatient setting appears acceptable. On the other 
hand concomitant use with medicinal products that are known to induce torsades de pointes 
(antipsychotic medicinal products e.g. chlorpromazine, haloperidol, antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin, 
erythromycin, clarithromycin), anti-arrhythmics Class Ia (e.g. quinidine), and Class III (e.g. 
amiodarone, procainamide, sotalol) should be avoided.  
Macimorelin should also be used with caution in patients with pro-arrhythmic condition (e.g., history of 
myocardial infarction, heart failure or prolonged ECG QTc interval, as defined as QTc > 500 ms). For such 
patients, ECG controls may be indicated prior to the administration of macimorelin and 1 hour, 2 hours, 
4 hours and 6 hours after administration of macimorelin. Finally, in patients with known congenital or 
acquired long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of torsades de pointes, the use of macimorelin 
may only be considered in a cardiovascular clinical unit. 
Torsades de pointes has also been included in the Risk Management Plan of macimorelin as an important 
potential risk and will be monitored in the post-authorisation setting through routine pharmacovigilance 
activities.  
No significant effects were found for 0.5 mg/kg oral macimorelin on any other laboratory parameters 
measured  including  clinical  chemistry,  haematology  and  hormones  such  as  TSH,  ACTH,  cortisol  or 
prolactin. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The overall safety database and safety profile of macimorelin is considered acceptable.  
The main concern identified through the submitted studies is a QTC interval prolongation of 
approximately 10ms. Considering that respective warnings have been included in the product 
information, the product is intended for single use and that the test is performed or supervised by an 
endocrinologist, this issue is considered to be adequately manageable.   
As the mechanism underlying the QT prolongation induced by macimorelin remains unknown, it is 
recommended that the applicant further investigates possible mechanism for the observed effect.

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.4  is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 21.12.2017. The new EURD list entry will therefore use 
the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of macimorelin acetate with active substances contained in 
authorised medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, 
isomer, mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers macimorelin acetate to be a new active substance as it 
is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris is the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency 
(GHD) in adults.   
GHD is a heterogeneous disorder that may develop during childhood or adult life, resulting from a variety 
of  causes  including  structural  lesions,  genetic  abnormalities,  trauma,  infiltrative  diseases,  surgery  or 
irradiation to the pituitary gland and/or hypothalamus. In adult patients, no single sign or symptom of 
so-called  Adult  GHD  (AGHD)  is  pathognomonic  but  it  is  recognized  that  AGHD  leads  to  increased 
morbidity (metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, muscle wasting, and impaired quality of life) and increased 
incidence of cardiovascular events, a main cause of the increased mortality observed in this population.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current published guidelines recommend that evaluation of AGHD be based on clinical findings, medical 
history and using an appropriate GH stimulation test (GHST) for biochemical confirmation. In patients 
with ≥ 3 pituitary hormone deficiencies and low serum IGF-I levels and patients with congenital/genetic 
GHD, the diagnosis of AGHD can be made without requiring stimulatory GH testing.  
The biochemical diagnosis of severe GHD is straightforward. Partial GHD is at present not a well-defined 
clinical entity in adults. Because in the absence of suggestive clinical circumstances there is a significant 
false-positive error rate in the response to a single GH stimulation test (GHST), 2 independent GHST are 
recommended before making this rare diagnosis. The presence of a low IGF-I increases the likelihood that 
the diagnosis is correct. However, normal IGF-I does not exclude GHD. 
The insulin tolerance test (ITT) is currently considered the “gold standard” test for evaluation of AGHD, 
but requires adequate hypoglycaemia (blood glucose <40 mg/dL) for interpretability of the results. In 
patients in whom an ITT cannot be performed (patients with ischemic heart disease or seizures, and in the 
elderly), the glucagon stimulation test (GST) is a safe alternative and has been assessed against the ITT 
in evaluating GH reserve. The L-ARG+GHRH test is essentially the arginine test with improved diagnostic 
accuracy  by  combining  it  with  a  potent  priming  agent  (a  GHRH  analogue)  in  one  test.  Unfortunately, 
GHRH is not widely available.  
Due to the potential safety issues associated with hypoglycemia, a subject undergoing the ITT requires 
close medical supervision over 3 to 4 hours until recovery of normal blood glucose levels. Moreover, it is 
reported to be an unpleasant and uncomfortable experience by most of the tested subjects. 
All GH stimulation tests (GHST) have limitations with regard to performance characteristic (sensitivity, 
specificity and/or reproducibility). Testing for confirmation of AGHD should only be performed if there is 
a high pretest probability, and with the intention to treat if the diagnosis is confirmed.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study 052 was the pivotal Phase III study. It was an open-label, randomized, multicentre, multinational, 
2-way crossover study. The primary objective was to validate the use of single dose oral macimorelin (0.5 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 82/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mg/kg) as growth hormone stimulation test (GHST) for the diagnosis of AGHD, using the insulin tolerance 
test (INTT) as comparator GHST.   
Study  subjects  were  assigned  to  4  groups  of  descending  likelihood  of  having  AGHD  (Group  A:  high 
likelihood of GHD, Group B: intermediate likelihood, Group C: low likelihood, Group D: healthy controls). 
The co-primary endpoints were 1) Percent of Negative Agreement and 2) Percent of Positive Agreement. 
Overall agreement was a key secondary endpoint. 
The  predefined  evaluation  was  based  on  a  cut-off  value  of  peak  serum  GH  of  2.8  ng/mL  for  the 
macimorelin stimulation test (MAC) that was derived from the results of study 047. For the ITT, a cut-off 
point of 5.1 ng/mL was predefined and agreed by the CMHP during a scientific advice procedure. A peak 
GH value below the cut-point was considered ‘test positive’, a value above the cut-off ‘test negative’. 
The performance of the GHST with macimorelin (MAC) was considered to be acceptable if the lower bound 
of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (or lower bound of the one-sided 97.5% confidence interval) for 
the primary efficacy variables was 75% or higher for ‘percent negative agreement’, and 70% or higher for 
the ‘percent positive agreement’. 
Serum GH concentrations were determined 30, 45, 60 and 90 min post-dose. 
Two tests were performed in a part of the subjects in order to assess repeatability. 
The primary efficacy analysis set of study 052 comprises 140 subjects. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Macimorelin at a single oral dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight increased GH serum concentrations with a 
peak between 45 and 60 min post-dose. The increase was inversely related to the likelihood of having 
AGHD. Macimorelin induced approximately 1.4-fold higher GH concentrations than were obtained with 
the ITT.  
At  the  predefined  cut-off  values  for  peak  serum  GH  of  2.8  ng/mL  for  MAC  and  5.1  ng/mL  for  ITT, 
respectively, the negative agreement between MAC and ITT was within the predefined margins (lower; 
upper  95%  CI):  93.94  (85.20;  98.32)  (one  of  two  co-primary  endpoints  successful)  and  overall 
agreement was 83.57 % (76.38; 89.29).  
Highly  consistent  effects  were  observed  in  the  repeatability  assessment.  In  34  subjects  there  was  a 
positive  agreement  in  16,  a  negative  agreement  in  16  and  discrepant  results  in  2  subjects  when  the 
predefined cut-off points of GH were used. 
Additional analyses indicated that it is generally sufficient to take samples at 45 and 60 min post-dose. In 
order to detect also rare late responders, an additional 90 min post-dose time point is recommended. 
Based on patients with high likelihood of disease and healthy controls, sensitivity and specificity were 
0.87 % (0.72; 0.96) and 0.96 % (0.80; 1.00) respectively. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  second  co-primary  endpoint,    i.e.  positive  agreement,    did  not  meet  the  predefined  acceptance 
margins. At the predefined cut-off of 2.8 ng/mL the positive agreement between MAC and ITT was (lower; 
upper 95% CI): 74.32 (62.84; 83.78). This was mainly due to the  fact that  some of the ITT positive 
subjects  were  not  categorized  as  positive  by  the  MAC.  Therefore,  the  MAC  appears  to  be  more 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/845216/2018  
Page 83/89 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conservative in diagnosing AGHD by reducing the risk of false positive results and unnecessary treatment. 
This is the key expectation for a GHST.  
The cut-off of the ITT had been predefined at 5.1 ng/mL, which is higher than the cut-off of 3.0 ng/mL as 
proposed by a consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with GH deficiency (Ho KKY 
et al, 2007). When using the lower cut-off point for ITT, post-hoc calculations provided by the applicant 
showed that the CIs for positive and negative agreement were within the ranges that were predefined for 
the primary endpoints, indicating that the study might have been positive if this cut-off point would have 
been used for the ITT. 
The cut-off of 2.8 ng/mL was based on calculations derived from study 047. The transferability of the 
results to study 052 was not established since different GH assays were used in both trials. 
Stimulated  GH  concentrations  are  known  to  be  reduced  with  obesity.  This  was  also  confirmed  in  the 
dataset provided by the applicant. No subjects with BMI >40 kg/m2 were included in the pivotal study 
052. Thus, diagnostic performance of the MAC in subjects with BMI >40 kg/m2 has not been established.  
During the transition period from late puberty to full adult maturation, cut-off values of 5-6 ng/mL for ITT 
are suggested by guidelines. The data from study 052 do not allow determination of a valid cut point for 
the MAC during the transition period but MAC and ITT showed similar performance in subjects between 18 
and 25 years 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A total of 377 subjects were treated with the MAC during clinical development studies, which included a 
total of 254 subjects in two studies (047 and 052) investigating the diagnostic use for AGHD.  
The  most  common  adverse  reactions  associated  with  the  MAC  (greater  than  1%  incidence  in  all 
macimorelin-treated subjects in two diagnostic studies were dysgeusia (7%) and headache, diarrhoea, 
nausea, and fatigue (each 2%). The rate of dysgeusia was lower after a taste masking formulation was 
used. 
ECG related adverse events occurred in 7 of 254 subjects (2.76%) exposed to an oral macimorelin dose 
of 0.5 mg/kg during studies AEZS-130-047 and AEZS-130-052.  
The thorough QT study and PK/PD study 054 revealed that macimorelin elicits a prolongation of the QTc 
interval in the ECG of around 10ms. The effect was highest at three to four hours after dosing and was 
seen at all macimorelin doses including the dose intended for diagnostic use. 
When comparing Adverse Events (AEs) of the Macimorelin test with the insulin tolerance test (ITT) based 
on the Phase 3 studies 047 and 052, 126 AEs occurred in 27% of subjects following the Macimorelin GH 
stimulation test compared with 761 AEs in 96.2% of subjects following insulin tolerance test (ITT). 
The  Insulin  Tolerance  test  (ITT)  was  associated  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  symptoms  related  to 
hypoglycaemia  including  hyperhidrosis  (67%),  somnolence  (36%),  hunger  (29%),  feeling  hot  (28%), 
dizziness  (27%),  fatigue  (27%),  asthenia  (19%),  tremor  (16%),  nausea  (13%),  cardiac  palpitations 
(11%),  headache  (10%),  tachycardia  (9%),  dry  mouth  (8%)  and  thirst  (8%)  as  the  most  frequent 
adverse events. 
It is concluded that the Macimorelin GH stimulation test was associated with significantly less side effects 
when compared with the Insulin Tolerance test (ITT).

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The mechanism by which QT-prolongation occurs following macimorelin administration is unknown. 
According to the summary as provided in the documentation in vitro studies did not reveal acute or 
delayed effects of macimorelin on hERG channels or Nav1.5 currents. It is possible that macimorelin 
metabolites and indirect effects (e.g. crosstalk/coupling of the intracellular signaling pathway of the 
ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor with cardiac ion channels) could be involved but further 
studies would be required to elucidate this mechanism.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Patients with a high likelihood of having disease based on patients´ history and clinical diagnostic work-up 
often don´t need a GHST. For those with an intermediate likelihood of having disease that are considered 
for treatment usually two tests are performed. Currently, the ITT is the preferred test despite tolerability 
and safety issues associated with its use, and reports of false positive results. Avoiding over-diagnosing 
is a key expectation for a test for ADGH since unnecessary treatment should be avoided. When using the 
proposed cut-point of 2.8 ng/mL, the MAC fulfils this expectation. 
Based on the results from the submitted pivotal trial, MAC has a sufficiently high negative agreement rate 
with the INTT, indicating high reliability that a MAC positive patient has indeed GH deficiency but also that 
the MAC is helpful in avoiding unnecessary treatment.  
The main concern with macimorelin relates to cardiac safety. ECG related adverse events were observed 
in  the  two  clinical  trials.  The  thorough  QT  study  revealed  a  time-dependent  prolongation  of  the  QTc 
interval in the ECG occurring approximately four hours after macimorelin administration. Considering that 
respective warnings have been included in the product information, the product is intended for single use 
and the test is performed or supervised by an endocrinologist, this issue is considered to be adequately 
manageable.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the context of an overall workup for suspected AGHD, macimorelin can be used to reliably confirm 
AGHD and thus enable initiation of treatment with GH replacement therapy which is known to have 
significant beneficial effects on body composition, physical performance and psychological well-being in 
these patients.  By using a cut point of 2.8 ng/mL for peak GH concentrations, the MAC will prevent 
unnecessary exposure to GH.  
The benefit to patients in both cases outweighs the risk of a small prolongation of the QT interval, 
especially as the product will be used once and under medical supervision. Appropriate labelling is in place 
to further minimize the risk. 
When compared with the ITT there were advantages of the MAC regarding tolerability and the 
requirement for re-testing of patients. The number of tests evaluable at first try was higher with MAC (153 
out of 154) than with the ITT (130 out of 157).  MAC was associated with a lower rate of AEs and there was 
a clear patient preference for the MAC. The vast majority of subjects would choose the MAC if they would 
need to undergo another GHST in the future.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Macimorelin Aeterna Zentaris for the diagnosis of AGHD is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome

diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that macimorelin acetate is a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
GlaxoSmithKline Trading Services Limited submitted on 14 September 2018 an extension of the marketing 
authorisation as follows:  
Extension application to introduce a new pharmaceutical form, solution for injection (in pre-filled syringe or in 
pre-filled pen). 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) applied for the following indication for the new pharmaceutical form:  
Nucala is indicated as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 6 years and older (see section 5.1). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008,  (2) 
point(s)  (d) - Extensions of marketing authorisations 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision P/0239/2017 
covering the application on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0239/2017 covering the application was completed. 
In addition, the PIP P/0239/2017 eligible for the reward was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0239/2017 eligible for the reward. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The  MAH  did  seek  Scientific  advice  at  the  CHMP.  The  scientific  advice  specific  to  the  development  of  liquid 
formulations was provided by EMA/CHMP document references EMA/CHMP/SAWP/271080/2016.

2.1.  Problem statement 
Mepolizumab is already approved as a lyophilised powder in a vial. 
This line extension is to introduce a liquid form of mepolizumab drug product in a pre-filled syringe or pre-filled 
pen/autoinjector. The currently marketed drug product is supplied as a 100 mg single-dose vial containing a 
sterile, preservative-free, lyophilized powder for reconstitution and subcutaneous injection. The MAH submitted 
this application to obtain marketing approval for a new drug form (mepolizumab injection, liquid drug product) 
of mepolizumab in the same and future indications currently registered for the Nucala lyophilised drug product 
(mepolizumab for injection).

2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by airway hyper-responsiveness, acute 
and chronic bronchoconstriction, airway oedema, and mucus plugging. The inflammatory component of asthma 
involves many cell types, including mast cells, eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, and epithelial cells and 
their biological products. 
The poor response of some patients with asthma to the standard regimen of controller and reliever therapies 
may  reflect  the  number  of  cellular  and  molecular  mechanisms  operative  in  asthma.  Recent  therapeutic 
approaches  in  asthma  have  been  focused  on  trying  to  control  the  Type  2/  T-helper  cell-2  (Th2)  response. 
Up-regulation  of  the  Th2  cell-derived  cytokines  interleukin-4  (IL-4)  and  interleukin-13  (IL-13)  has  been 
implicated as an important inflammatory component of asthma disease progression. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Asthma is a chronic airway disease affecting approximately 334 million people worldwide and is responsible for 
approximately 250,000 premature deaths each year. 
Asthma prevalence varies by geographical region. Accurate assessment of the prevalence of asthma has been 
hindered  by  varying  definitions  of  asthma  and  methods  of  data  collection,  each  combining  to  make  data 
comparison across studies difficult. 
Risk factors include sex (gender influence varies with age), airway hyper reactivity, atopy, allergens, infections, 
tobacco smoke, obesity, and perinatal factors. 
Asthma is common in adolescents but is frequently undiagnosed because of under-reporting of symptoms. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The  disease  is  characterized  by  airway  inflammation  with  oedema,  cellular  infiltration  and  mucus  plugging, 
bronchial  smooth  muscle  hypertrophy  which  results  in  variable  airway  obstruction  and  bronchial 
hyper-responsiveness. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
There  is  no  single  diagnostic  test  for  asthma,  the  diagnosis  is  a  clinical  one.  The  absence  of  consistent 
gold-standard  diagnostic  criteria  means  that  it  is  not  possible  to  make  unequivocal  evidence-based 
recommendations on how to make a diagnosis of asthma. The diagnosis of asthma in children and adults is 
based on the recognition of a characteristic pattern of respiratory symptoms, signs and test results and the 
absence of any alternative explanation for these. 
Typical symptoms of asthma include periodic wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and cough, all of 
which worsen at night. Patients with asthma experience exacerbations of these symptoms which acutely worsen 
in response to various triggers such as allergens, microbes, and pollutants, resulting in significant reductions in 
expiratory flow as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1second (FEV). 
Symptoms and signs of asthma in adolescents are no different from those of other age groups. 
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 11/63 
  
  
2.1.5.  Management 
The  goals  of  chronic  asthma  management  may  be  divided  into  two  domains:  reduction  in  impairment  and 
reduction of risk. 
Complete control of asthma is defined as (British Thoracic Society/SIGN guideline):  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
no daytime symptoms  
no night-time awakening due to asthma  
no need for rescue medication  
no asthma attacks  
no limitations on activity including exercise  
normal lung function (in practical terms FEV1 and/or PEF>80% predicted or best)  
•  minimal side effects from medication. 
In clinical practice patients may have different goals and may wish to balance the aims of asthma management 
against the potential side effects or inconvenience of taking medication necessary to achieve perfect control. 
Effective  asthma  management  requires  a  proactive,  preventive  approach,  similar  to  the  treatment  of 
hypertension  or  diabetes.  Routine  follow-up  visits  for  patients  with  active  asthma  are  recommended,  at  a 
frequency of every one to six months, depending upon the severity of asthma. These visits should be used to 
assess multiple aspects of the patient's asthma and to discuss steps that patients can take to intervene early in 
asthma exacerbations (an asthma "action plan"). The aspects of the patient's asthma that should be assessed at 
each  visit  include  the  following:  signs  and  symptoms,  pulmonary  function,  quality  of  life,  exacerbations, 
adherence with treatment, medication side effects, and patient satisfaction with care.  
Pharmacologic treatment is the mainstay of management in most patients with asthma. The stepwise approach 
to pharmacotherapy is based on increasing medications until asthma is controlled, and decreasing medications 
when possible to minimize side effects. Adjustment of the patient's management should be considered at every 
visit. 
The first step in determining appropriate therapy for patients who are not already on a controller medication is 
classifying the severity of the patient's asthma. For patients already taking one or more controller medications, 
treatment options are guided by an assessment of asthma control rather than asthma severity. 
Specific evidence about the pharmacological management of adolescents with asthma is limited and is usually 
extrapolated from paediatric and adult studies. 
Decreasing  therapy  once  asthma  is  controlled  is  recommended,  but  often  not  implemented  leaving  some 
patients over-treated. 
About the product 
Mepolizumab  (SB-240563)  is  a  humanised  monoclonal  antibody  (IgG1,  kappa)  directed  against  the  human 
cytokine interleukin-5 (hIL-5), the major cytokine responsible for the growth and differentiation, recruitment, 
activation and survival, of eosinophils. Mepolizumab binds to human IL-5, preventing IL-5 from binding to the 
alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibiting signalling. 
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 12/63 
  
  
Neutralisation of IL-5 leads to a reduction in the production rate and survival of eosinophils which is expected to 
provide therapeutic benefit in hypereosinophilic conditions.  
NUCALA (mepolizumab) 100 mg powder for solution for injection was approved on 2nd December 2015 for use 
as add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adult patients.  
The  currently  marketed  drug  product  is  supplied  as  a  100  mg  single-dose  vial  containing  a  sterile, 
preservative-free, lyophilized powder for reconstitution and subcutaneous injection. The MAH submitted this 
application to obtain marketing approval for a new drug form (mepolizumab injection, liquid drug product) of 
mepolizumab in the same and future indications currently registered for the Nucala lyophilised drug product 
(mepolizumab for injection).  
The  mepolizumab  liquid  clinical  development  program  consisted  of  three  clinical  studies  designed  to 
demonstrate: 
•  Comparable  pharmacokinetic  systemic  exposure  between  the  liquid  drug  product  and  the  approved 
lyophilized drug product (Study 204958) 
•  Real-world  usability  of  the  safety  syringe  and  autoinjector  devices,  along  with  the  IFU,  to  allow  for 
patient self-administration or administration by a caregiver (Studies 205667 and 204959) 
•  Comparable safety profile between the liquid drug product and the approved lyophilized drug product 
(Studies 204958, 205667, and 204959) 
In addition Mepolizumab is under development for the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD), Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA; also known as Churg-Strauss Syndrome), 
and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Additional development programs are under consideration based on the 
mechanism of action of mepolizumab and its effects on eosinophils.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Mepolizumab is currently approved as a 100 mg lyophilised powder for solution for injection in a vial. This line 
extension seeks to introduce a liquid formulation:  
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 13/63 
  
  
- 1 mL solution containing 100 mg mepolizumab in a Type 1 glass syringe with a fixed needle and passive safety 
needle guard (also referred to as safety syringe); 
- 1 mL solution containing 100 mg mepolizumab in a Type 1 glass syringe with a fixed needle in a pre-filled pen 
(also referred to as auto-injector). 
The liquid formulation will be marketed as one pre-filled syringe (PFS) or one pre-filled pen (PFP) and multipacks 
comprising 3 (3 packs of 1) PFS or PFP. 
Mepolizumab  is  formulated  with  sucrose,  sodium  phosphate  dibasic  heptahydrate,  citric  acid  monohydrate, 
polysorbate 80, EDTA disodium dihydrate and water for injections.  
The manufacture of active substance for the liquid formulation duplicates the same process steps used for the 
previously authorised lyophilised formulation, from vial thaw and cell culture through harvest, purification and 
virus  clearance  (Stages  1 through  10).  At  the  Tangential  Flow  Ultrafiltration  step  (Stage 11),  the  processes 
diverge to accommodate buffer exchange into separate formulations. 
A  substantial  amount  of  active  substance  CMC  information  is  therefore  harmonised  for  the  manufacturing 
processes for the lyophilised and liquid formulations due to their shared manufacturing steps. Where information 
supportive of the liquid formulation was previously provided in the application for the lyophilised product, the 
information is included in this application for the liquid product by cross-reference to the approved application. 
To assist with the cross-referencing strategy, a nomenclature has been developed to identify the processes at 
each facility: 
•  MDS2 is the historical code for the approved active substance process for the lyophilised formulation at 
GSK, Conshohocken. 
•  MDS2_LYO_RKV refers to the process for the lyophilised formulation at HGS, Rockville. This process was 
recently introduced by a Type 1B variation implementing a previously approved post approval change 
management protocol. 
•  MDS2_LIQ_RKV refers to the active substance process for the liquid formulation at HGS, Rockville 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Mepolizumab  is  a  recombinant  humanised  monoclonal  antibody  specific  for  human  IL-5.  The  heavy  chain 
contains 449 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 49 kDa. The light chain contains 
220 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of approximately 24 kDa.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Mepolizumab  is  produced in  CHO  cells  using  a  manufacturing  process  at  the Human  Genome  Sciences,  Inc, 
Large  Scale  Manufacturing  (LSM)  facility.  The  upstream  manufacturing  process  includes  vial  thaw,  seed 
expansion, growth of cells and harvest by centrifugation and depth filtration. Downstream processing includes a 
series of chromatography, ultrafiltration and viral inactivation and filtration steps.  
The manufacturing process registered with this line extension is designated as MDS2 LIQ RKV (mepolizumab 
active  substance  process  2,  liquid,  Rockville).  The  Rockville  active  substance  manufacturing  process  for  the 
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 14/63 
 
  
  
currently approved lyophilised finished product is designated MDS2 LYO RKV. MDS2 LIQ RKV is primarily the 
same as MDS2 LYO RKV, with only minor changes to the purification processes. Minor changes have been made 
to the registered process parameters.  
Control of materials 
The  cell  banks  and  most  of  the  raw  materials  are  identical  to  those  used  in  manufacture  of  the  currently 
approved active substance. Details of the raw materials used for the revised Stages 11 and 12 are provided in 
the dossier along with reference to the relevant pharmacopoeias. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical  process  parameters  (CPPs),  acceptable  ranges,  and  associated  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs)  for 
stages  11  and  12  of  the  purification  process  are  presented  in  the  dossier.  The  controls  include  tests  for 
concentration, bioburden, endotoxin, container closure torque and filter integrity test. The proposed controls are 
acceptable. 
Process validation 
Stages 1-10 have been validated as part of the currently approved process. Validation data is presented from 
process performance qualification (PPQ) batches for Stages 11 and 12 and includes relevant data from process 
parameters, CPPs, and in-process controls (IPCs). The results from all PPQ batches were within the relevant 
acceptance criteria for each control parameter. Impurity clearance data show sufficient clearance of relevant 
impurities. The data provided demonstrate that Stages 11 and 12 for the MDS2 LIQ RKV process have been 
successfully  validated.  A  verification  protocol  has  been  provided.  Hold  times  are  registered  throughout  the 
manufacturing process and have been supported by relevant process validation data.  
Manufacturing process development 
A comparability study was presented to justify that the MDS2 LIQ RKV process can be considered comparable to 
the MDS2 / MDS2 LYO KRV process. The comparability studies included in-process data from MDS2 batches, 
MDS2  LIQ  RKV  batches  and  MDS2  LYO  RKV  batches.  During  the  assessment  of  the  Type  1B  variation  to 
introduce process MDS2 LYO RKV, it was concluded that MDS2 LYO RKV and MDS2 are comparable.  Overall, 
considering the totality of the comparability data provided in this line extension application, comparability of 
Stages 1-10 is considered demonstrated. 
Process  data  from  Stages  11  and  12  along  with  impurity  clearance  data  support  the  comparability  claim. 
Comparability was also demonstrated using side-by-side testing of batches of MDS2 and batches of MDS2 LIQ 
RKV. The data from these tests support the claim of comparability. A comparison of batch release also supported 
the comparability claim. 
The  control  strategy  is  essentially  the  same  as  for  the  approved  active  substance.  Differences  have  been 
supported by small-scale studies.   
Characterisation 
The  active  substance  has  previously  been  characterised  in  the  approved  marketing  authorisation. 
Process-related  impurity  clearance  data  has  been  provided  from  MDS2  LIQ  RKV  batches  and  shows  an 
acceptable level of clearance, which is comparable to the approved active substance.

Specification,  analytical  procedures,  reference  standards,  batch  analysis,  and 
container closure 
Specifications 
The  proposed  specifications  include  control  of  identity,  purity,  potency  and  other  general  tests.  They  are 
generally consistent with those seen for monoclonal antibodies; they are in accordance with ICH Q6B and are 
accepted.  The  majority  of  acceptance  criteria  are  identical  to  those  approved  for  the  MDS2  LYO  RKV  active 
substance. The limit for host cell proteins (HCP) is wider than the available batch data; however as part of the 
ongoing process verification HCP levels in the bulk active substance are monitored to an interim control limit. 
Analytical procedures 
Analytical methods which are common to the previously authorised Nucala lyophilised powder formulation are 
cross-referenced to that dossier. This approach is acceptable as it is confirmed that the methods are identical for 
both  products.  Pharmacopoeial  methods  contain  reference  to  their  specific  monograph  which  is  acceptable, 
while  non-pharmacopoeial  methods  are  described  in  the  dossier.  In  general,  the  level  of  description  is 
acceptable. Overall, the applicant has provided detailed validation reports for new methods and supplementary 
validation reports for methods previously used for lyophilised active substance. All analytical procedures were 
validated in accordance with ICH Q2. 
Batch analysis 
The applicant has provided batch data for six PPQ batches manufactured according to the proposed commercial 
process  as  well  as  four  clinical  batches.  Results  are  comparable  between  batches  and  meet  all  specification 
limits. 
Reference standards 
The  approach  to  reference  standards  has  not  changed  from  the  approved  dossier.  The  current  reference 
standards were assessed during the initial marketing authorisation and continue to be acceptable. 
Container closure system 
The primary container closure system was assessed during the initial marketing authorisation and is acceptable. 
Stability 
The real-time stability data generated for MDS2 LIQ RKV active substance indicate that the active substance is 
physically,  chemically  and  biologically  stable  when  stored  at  the  recommended  storage  conditions.  A 
comprehensive stability protocol has been provided, which tests the main quality attributes at all time-points. 
Stability reports demonstrate that all quality attributes remained within specification during shelf life. In addition 
accelerated studies support the stability of the active substance. Photo-stability studies indicate that the active 
substance is sensitive to degradation upon exposure to light, and therefore should be stored protected from 
light. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the 
European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to 
the Rapporteur and EMA.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
The product is presented as a single-use, sterile liquid finished product in a clear glass pre-filled syringe (PFS) 
intended to deliver 100 mg of mepolizumab for subcutaneous use. It is referred to as MDP3 to differentiate it 
from the currently approved MDP2 finished product. The primary container and closure consists of a 1 mL long 
Type 1 glass siliconised barrel with a staked 29G thin wall x 12.7 mm stainless steel needle with a thermoplastic 
elastomer  needle  shield  covered  by  rigid  plastic  shield  sealed  with  a  fluororesin  coated  bromobutyl  rubber 
plunger stopper. The PFS is assembled into either an auto-injector or a safety syringe device. A minimum fill 
volume of 1.01 mL is provided in the PFS to ensure the required 1.0 mL volume is delivered. The finished product 
composition includes 100 mg of active substance, sucrose, sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, citric acid 
monohydrate, polysorbate 80 and EDTA disodium dihydrate. 
Sufficient details of the formulation development have been provided. Several formulations were tested which 
included  different buffers  as  well  as  different  concentrations  of  sucrose  and  polysorbate  80.  The  differences 
between the liquid and currently registered lyophilised presentation include a lower amount of sucrose, sodium 
phosphate dibasic heptahydrate and polysorbate 80, and the addition of citric acid monohydrate and EDTA. 
Small  scale  process  characterisation  studies  were  carried  out  to  identify  the  CPPs  and  define  the  proven 
acceptable ranged (PARs). A mixing study was performed at worst case conditions and confirmed that the shear 
stress does not negatively impact on quality. A filtration study showed no impact on quality. Sufficient data on 
compatibility has been presented.  
The CQAs for the finished product have been listed and were defined based on regulatory requirements and risk 
assessment. Further details of this risk assessment have been requested. The panel of CQAs cover all relevant 
aspects of purity, potency and safety.  
Comparability studies have been provided to support the comparability of MDP2 and MDP3 finished product. 
Batches of MDP2  were compared to Batches of MDP3. In addition, a comparison of MDP3 batch data to the 
historical range of MDP2 batches supported the comparability claim. Extensive forced degradation studies were 
also carried out which supported comparability.  
The primary container closure is a PFS, which is assembled into an auto-injector or safety syringe. Details of 
design  verification  and  design  validation  studies  have  been  provided.  The  technical  dossier  was  provided  in 
3.2.R. Details of functional performance testing have been provided and include cap removal force, injection 
actuation force, needle extension, delivered volume, and needle safe distance. In addition, the auto-injector was 
tested for injection time, audible click, and needle cover over-ride; and the safety syringe was tested for needle 
guard actuation force, needle guard over-ride force, and needle guard lockout. The testing is in accordance with 
relevant ISOs 11608 and 11404. Biocompatibility testing has been performed in accordance with ISO 10993-1. 
Formative and summative human factors studies and real-world use studies have also been performed. The 
device performance was also evaluated during the PK trial. Overall, the level of detail provided for the PFS, 
auto-injector and safety syringe is considered acceptable. Extractables and leachables have been sufficiently 
addressed and are concluded to pose no risk.  
Container closure 
The primary container closure system is a PFS, which is assembled into an auto-injector or a safety syringe 
device.  The  syringe  glass  conforms  to  Ph.  Eur.  requirements  for  glass  and  the  proposed  specifications  are 
acceptable. They cover relevant tests for visual defects, quality of material, microbial testing and performance

testing. A specification for silicone is included for the PFS. It has been confirmed that the silicone oil used in the 
syringes is in conformance with Ph. Eur. 3.1.8 Silicone oil used as a lubricant. The rubber stoppers conform to 
Ph. Eur. 3.2.9 and the specifications cover visual defects, identity, sterility and dimensional requirements and 
are  acceptable.  The  names  of  the  PFS  and  rubber  stopper  manufacturers  have  been  supplied  including  the 
address of the sites responsible for sterilisation. The syringes are sterilised by the supplier using ethylene oxide, 
and a specification for residual ethylene oxide is included. 
Sufficient details and acceptable specifications have been provided for the safety syringe. The auto-injector is 
manufactured by Ypsomed and is a single-use disposable device, which is not exposed to the finished product. 
The  specifications  include  visual  tests  performed  by  the  MAH  and  functional  tests  performed  by  Ypsomed. 
Relevant functional tests are registered in the specifications (Table 4). A technical dossier for the auto-injector 
is provided which includes details of conformance with the General Safety and Performance Requirements of the 
Medical Device Directive. Human factors study reports are also provided. Overall, the level of detail registered 
for safety syringe and auto-injector is considered acceptable. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
The manufacturing process is standard for a monoclonal antibody finished product and has been sufficiently well 
described in the dossier. Frozen active substance is thawed, pooled and diluted to the target concentration. 
Formulation buffer and bulk active substance are mixed and then filtered into a holding bag, followed by sterile 
filtration and filling into PFSs. The PFSs are assembled into an auto-injector or safety syringe.   
Process controls 
IPCs are listed throughout the manufacturing. The level of control is considered appropriate for this type of 
manufacturing process.   
Process validation 
Data is provided for five PPQ batches. For manufacture of the formulation buffer and dilution/mixing of the bulk 
active  substance,  two  samples  were  taken.  For  the  filling  process,  six  samples  were  taken.  The  acceptance 
criteria for the PPQ campaign were based on the finished product release specifications.  Data are provided on 
relevant CQAs, CPPs and IPCs throughout the manufacturing process. The assembly into auto-injector or safety 
syringe was successfully validated and included a sufficient number of functional performance tests. Shipping 
validation data has also been provided and is acceptable. 
Sterile filtration has been sufficiently validated. A microbial retention study was carried out at the maximum flow 
rate.  Media  fills  have  been  performed  under  worst-case  conditions  and  successfully  passed.  Routine 
environmental monitoring is also performed. Details of the filter extractable study were provided and the levels 
identified were below the reporting threshold of daily patient exposure. 
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
Specifications 
The panel of tests included in the finished product specifications are in accordance with ICH Q6B and cover the 
relevant  aspects  of  identity,  purity  and  impurities,  potency  and  other  general  tests.  The  testing  panel  is 
generally consistent with the approved Nucala marketing authorisation. The proposed specifications for device 
functionality include tests for delivered volume, needle guard lock-out and container closure integrity. Stability

studies  have  confirmed  acceptable  break-loose  force  and  extrusion  force  over  the  shelf  life  of  the  PFS.  The 
applicant has justified the proposed acceptance criteria for the finished product on the basis that they are the 
same as the approved lyophilised product, are compendial, or are the same as the clinical acceptance criteria.  
Analytical procedures  
There are three finished product specific methods; bioassay, container closure integrity and post-use needle 
guard lock-out. The other analytical procedures are either compendial, or the same as for the active substance. 
The descriptions and validation of the analytical methods are acceptable.  
Batch analysis 
Batch  data  has  been  presented  from  MDP3  clinical  and  PPQ  batches.  The  finished  product  batches  were  all 
manufactured  from  active  substance  batches.  From  these  active  substance  batches,  PFS  batches  were 
manufactured. These PFS batches were used to manufacture safety syringe batches and seven auto-injector 
batches, for which data is provided. All release data were well within specification and demonstrate that the 
process is capable of producing finished product batches of consistent quality. In addition to the release tests, 
the functional testing of the MDP3 PFS batches included maximum break loose force, maximum peak extrusion 
force and maximum average extrusion force. These tests are for information only and have not been included in 
the proposed commercial release specifications. This is acceptable. 
Reference standard 
The reference standard is described in the active substance section. 
Stability 
The proposed shelf life of the finished product is 24 months at 2-80C, plus 1 week at room temperature (up to 
30°C/35% residual humidity (RH)) is acceptable. The shelf life specifications are the same as for release, apart 
from SEC and cIEF. The stability data includes batches from the PFS, auto-injector and safety syringe which are 
the intended commercial container closure system. The data included storage in the horizontal, upright and 
vertical  positions.  The  real  time  stability  data  show  no  significant  changes  in  quality  parameters.  At  the 
accelerated storage condition of 30°C/35%RH, the finished product was out of specification after 3 months. 
Photostability studies have shown that the finished product is sensitive to light and an appropriate warning is 
included in Section 6.4 of the SmPC. The product must be administered within 8 hours once the pack is opened.  
Stability data from functional assays have been submitted to support the functionality of the PFS across the shelf 
life. Data are provided for maximum break-loose force, maximum peak extrusion force and maximum average 
extrusion force. To address the functional performance of the auto-injector during storage, stability data was 
provided  for  cap  removal  force,  actuation  force,  needle  cover  lockout,  needle  extension,  force  to  overcome 
lockout, delivery time, and needle safe distance. 
Up to 24 months stability data has been provided which covers the claimed shelf life. The storage conditions also 
include the possibility of storage for 1 week at 300C. Data has been provided where the finished product was 
stored for 2 weeks at 30°C/35%RH, followed by 12 months’ storage at 2-80C. This stability study is ongoing. In 
accordance  with  EU  GMP  guidelines  (6.32  of  Vol.  4  Part  I  of  the  Rules  Governing  Medicinal  products  in  the 
European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to 
the Rapporteur and EMA.

None  of  the  steps  which  impact  viral  clearance  is  changed  compared  with  the  approved  process  and  no 
additional possible sources of viral contamination are introduced.   
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance manufacturing process is identical to the currently approved mepolizumab active 
substance manufacturing process apart from the final two manufacturing steps. Comparability to the currently 
approved process has been shown. The finished product includes a new formulation and a new presentation in 
a PFS or PFP. Comparability to the currently approved finished product has been demonstrated. The 
manufacturing process is well under control and the batch data are consistent and the finished product 
manufacturing process has been validated. Sufficient details have been provided regarding the pre-filled syringe 
and pre-filled pen, which conform to current legislation and guidance.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, CHMP considers that this line extension 
application is approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects

2.4.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
• 
Introduction 
The purpose of this application is to obtain marketing approval for mepolizumab liquid drug product, delivered 
via a prefilled safety syringe or an autoinjector device, in the same and future indications currently registered for 
Nucala lyophilised drug product. 
Three  clinical  studies  of  mepolizumab  liquid  drug  product  support  this  application;  a  pharmacokinetic  (PK) 
comparability study in healthy subjects (Study 204958), and two Real-World Use studies in subjects with severe 
eosinophilic asthma, one with the autoinjector (Study 204959) and one with the safety syringe (Study 205667). 
•  Methods 
Analytical methods 
The same bioanalytical methods used in support of the currently approved lyophilised presentation were used in 
support  of  the  current  submission  to  evaluate  Mepolizumab  plasma  concentrations  and  presence  of 
Mepolizumab ADA and NAbs. This approach is acceptable.   
The applicant has provided data that shows the assay runs used to analyse samples from the clinical studies met 
pre-defined acceptance criteria. The data from these runs was therefore valid.   
For  evaluation  of  ADAs  in  the  current  submission,  the  method  was  transferred  to  a  new  laboratory.  The 
validation status of the method has been summarised. This  has been performed in accordance with current 
guidelines. The method remains in a valid state.  
Updated sample stability data has also been provided.   
Pharmacokinetic data analysis

Mepolizumab  PK  parameters  were  derived  from  the  plasma  concentration-time  data  for  each  subject  by 
standard non-compartmental methods using Phoenix WinNonlin Version 6.3.  
Statistical methods 
In  the  PK  comparability  study  (204958),  the  primary  statistical  analysis  was  to  compare  the  primary  PK 
parameters [Cmax, AUC(0-t) and  AUC(0-∞)]  for each test treatment (liquid drug product in autoinjector or 
safety syringe) with the reference treatment (reconstituted lyophilised drug product from a vial). The primary PK 
parameters  were  loge  transformed  and  analysed  separately  using  a  fixed  effects  analysis  of  covariance 
(ANCOVA)  model,  including  treatment  group,  injection  site  and  baseline  body  weight  as  covariates.  Point 
estimates and associated two-sided 90% CIs were constructed for the ratio of the geometric mean of each test 
treatment to the geometric mean of the reference treatment (obtained by back-transforming estimates and 
90% CIs for the treatment differences from the statistical model on the loge scale). The sample size for this 
study  was  based  on  the  number  of  subjects  needed  to  demonstrate  a  2-sided  90%  CI  for  the  ratio  of  the 
geometric mean of each test treatment to the geometric mean of the reference treatment, within the guide 
range of 0.80-1.25, for primary PK parameters. 
In the two real-world use studies (204959 and 205667), statistical analyses were descriptive only and no formal 
sample size calculations were performed. 
In all three studies, analyses were performed on all available data and no imputation was performed for missing 
data.  
•  Bioequivalence  
Study  204958 was an open label, randomised, three arm, single dose, multicentre, parallel group study in 
healthy subjects to compare the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous mepolizumab when delivered as a liquid 
drug product in a safety syringe or an autoinjector with a reconstituted lyophilised drug product from a vial.  
244 healthy subjects received mepolizumab treatment and provided PK samples for analysis. The demographics 
and baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment arms. The plasma concentration-time profiles 
following a single SC dose of mepolizumab 100 mg from the lyophilised drug product or from the liquid drug 
product, delivered by an autoinjector or a safety syringe, were similar (Figure 3).  
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 22/63 
  
  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  a  single  mepolizumab  100  mg  SC  dose,  administered  as  liquid  drug  product  using 
either autoinjector or safety syringe, was shown to be statistically comparable to the pharmacokinetics of the 
commercialized  lyophilized  drug  product.  All  90%  CIs  for  the  treatment  ratios  (liquid  drug  product  in 
autoinjector vs. lyophilized drug product and liquid drug product in safety syringe vs. lyophilized drug product) 
of mepolizumab Cmax, AUC(0-∞) and AUC(0-t) were contained within the conventional bioequivalence bounds 
of 0.80, 1.25 (Table 1).  
The similarity of secondary PK parameters (tmax, apparent clearance, terminal phase half-life) across the 3 
treatment arms provide further support for the comparability of the 2 test treatments and the reference (Table 
10).  The  geometric  mean  extrapolated  portion  of  AUC(0-∞)  was  7  to  8%  (range  for  individual  values 
0.5-19.9%).  PK  parameters  were  consistent  with  those  observed  in  a  previous  study  conducted  in  healthy 
subjects with the lyophilised drug product (Study SB-240563/018).

Overall, the site of injection (abdomen, thigh, or arm) did not markedly influence mepolizumab PK, irrespective 
of drug product or device used. 
The post-baseline incidence of positive ADA results in this study was low and was similar across the treatment 
groups (4%, 6% and 4% for the lyophilised drug product, liquid drug product in autoinjector and liquid drug 
product in safety syringe, respectively). Titres were generally low, with a maximum titre of 320 (in 1 subject in 
the safety syringe group at Day 29), and decreasing or remaining stable over time. In the 11 subjects with 
positive  post  baseline  ADA  results,  there  was  no  evidence  of  mepolizumab  plasma  concentrations  or  blood 
eosinophil  counts  being  affected  by  the  presence  of  ADAs.  There  was  no  discernible  impact  of  ADAs  on 
mepolizumab plasma concentrations or blood eosinophils. No subjects tested positive for neutralising antibodies 
to mepolizumab. 
•  Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
In subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma, two repeat dose Real-World Use studies of 100 mg SC every 4 
weeks  for  12  weeks  using  liquid  drug  product  in  autoinjector  (Study  204959)  or  safety  syringe  (Study 
205667)  were  conducted.  Both  studies  were  open-label,  single  arm,  repeat  dose,  multi-centre  studies,  to 
evaluate the use of an autoinjector or a safety syringe for the subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab in 
subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. In these studies, the PK of mepolizumab was assessed by measuring 
mepolizumab plasma trough concentrations. 
159 subjects and 56 subjects had samples collected for PK assessment in Study 204959 and Study 205667, 
respectively.  In  each  study,  the  mean  mepolizumab  plasma  trough  concentration  increased  following  each 
self-administration,  and  at  the  End  of  Study  Visit  the  mean  mepolizumab  plasma  trough  concentration  was 
similar to that observed in subjects already receiving mepolizumab at Screening (Figure 3 [204959] and Figure 
3 [205667]). Mepolizumab plasma trough concentrations were consistent between studies, and were indicative 
of correct self-administration by the subjects themselves (or their caregivers) using the autoinjector and safety 
syringe devices.

When assessed by the site of injection (abdomen, thigh, or arm), the mean mepolizumab concentration-time 
plots were overall similar across the three sites, irrespective of the device used. However, there is insufficient 
evidence to conclude no difference in the upper arm site of injection compared to the abdomen or thigh, with 
only 5 subjects in Study 204959 and 4 subjects in Study 205667 using the upper arm as a site of injection. 
Consistent with Study 204958, the post-Baseline incidence of mepolizumab antidrug antibodies in both studies 
was low and no subjects tested positive for neutralising antibodies to mepolizumab. There was no evidence of 
mepolizumab  plasma  trough  concentrations  and  blood  eosinophil  counts  being  affected  by  the  presence  of 
ADAs. 
•  Conclusion 
Overall,  the  PK  of  mepolizumab  was  studied  and  characterised  sufficiently  for  this  application.  In  healthy 
subjects, the PK of a single mepolizumab 100 mg SC dose, administered as liquid drug product using either 
autoinjector  or  safety  syringe,  was  shown  to  be  statistically  comparable  to  the  PK  of  the  commercialised 
lyophilized drug product. In subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma, two repeat dose Real-World Use studies 
of 100 mg SC mepolizumab every 4  weeks  for 12  weeks  using liquid drug product in autoinjector or safety 
syringe,  showed  consistent  mepolizumab  plasma  trough  concentrations.  In  all  studies,  the  post-Baseline 
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation

incidence of mepolizumab antidrug antibodies was low and no subjects tested positive for neutralising antibodies 
to mepolizumab. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
• 
Introduction 
The pharmacodynamics (PD) of mepolizumab were investigated in three clinical studies. Study 204958 was a 
comparative  PK  study  conducted  in  healthy  volunteers,  which  included  an  exploratory  PD  analysis.  Studies 
204959 and 205667 were real-world use studies of mepolizumab in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma, 
which included assessments of the PD effect of mepolizumab via an autoinjector (Study 204959) and via a safety 
syringe (Study 205667). 
•  Mechanism of action 
Mepolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody which interacts with interleukin-5 (IL-5) to inhibit its binding 
to and signalling via the cell-surface IL-5 receptor complex expressed on eosinophil cells. IL-5 promotes the 
proliferation of eosinophils, and the antagonistic action of mepolizumab results in reduced blood, sputum, and 
tissue eosinophils. 
•  Primary pharmacology 
Mepolizumab produces a reduction of blood eosinophil levels and has shown clinical benefit in the treatment of 
severe eosinophilic asthma.  
Study  204958  was  a  comparative  PK  study  in  healthy  volunteers.  This  study  included  an  exploratory  PD 
analysis, to evaluate mepolizumab PD effects on blood eosinophil count following a single 100 mg SC dose of 
liquid  drug  product,  in  safety  syringe  or  autoinjector,  in  comparison  with  the  reconstituted  lyophilised  drug 
product.  
In all treatment groups, a single dose of mepolizumab produced a decrease in eosinophil counts up to Day 29, 
which then started to return towards baseline. The reductions in blood eosinophil counts observed using the 
liquid drug product in autoinjector or safety syringe were comparable, and comparable with the lyophilized drug 
product. 
Geometric mean ratios to baseline blood eosinophils over time (adjusted for baseline blood eosinophil count 
[loge scale], injection site [arm, abdomen, thigh] and baseline weight [loge scale]) were similar across the 3 
treatment groups with a value of 0.335, 0.344 and 0.311 (a reduction from baseline of 67%, 66% and 69%) at 
Day 29 for the lyophilised drug product, liquid drug product in autoinjector and liquid drug product in safety 
syringe, respectively. 
In the comparisons of the liquid drug product in autoinjector and the liquid drug product in safety syringe with 
the lyophilised drug product, the geometric mean ratios of blood eosinophil counts for both comparisons were 
approximately 1 (range 1.029 to 1.147 for the liquid drug product in autoinjector vs lyophilised drug product 
comparison  and  0.929  to  1.123  for  the  liquid  drug  product  in  safety  syringe  vs  lyophilised  drug  product 
comparison). This suggests that both test treatments (liquid drug product in autoinjector or safety syringe) had 
similar effects on blood eosinophils as the lyophilised drug product. 
Studies 204959 and 205667 were real-world use studies of mepolizumab in subjects with severe eosinophilic 
asthma, which included assessments of the PD effect of mepolizumab. The PD profile of mepolizumab liquid drug

product in an autoinjector or safety syringe was assessed by measuring blood eosinophils. 158 subjects and 56 
subjects had samples collected for PD assessment in studies 204959 and 205667, respectively. 
In subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma, 100 mg SC every 4 weeks for 12 weeks using liquid drug product 
in autoinjector (Study 204959) or safety syringe (Study 205667), resulted in a sustained reduction in blood 
eosinophil  counts.  The  reductions  in  blood  eosinophil  counts  observed  using  the  liquid  drug  product  in 
autoinjector or safety syringe were comparable (Figure 4 Study 204959 and Figure 4 Study 205667). Blood 
eosinophil counts were indicative of correct self-administration by the subjects (or their caregivers) using the 
autoinjector and safety syringe devices.

Overall,  in  subjects  with  severe  eosinophilic  asthma,  the  site  of  injection  (abdomen,  thigh,  or  arm)  did  not 
appear to influence the effect of mepolizumab on blood eosinophils, irrespective of the device used, although 
there were too few subjects using the upper arm site in either study to be able to conclude no difference. 
•  Conclusion 
The PD of mepolizumab was studied and characterised sufficiently for this application. In healthy subjects, a 
single 100 mg SC dose of mepolizumab produced a decrease in eosinophil counts up to Day 29. The reductions 
in  blood  eosinophil  counts  observed  using  the  liquid  drug  product  in  autoinjector  or  safety  syringe  were 
comparable, and comparable with the lyophilized drug product. 
In subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma, 100 mg mepolizumab SC every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, using liquid 
drug product in autoinjector or safety syringe, resulted in a sustained reduction in blood eosinophil counts. The 
reductions in blood eosinophil counts observed using the liquid drug product in autoinjector or safety syringe 
were comparable. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
To support the development of the liquid formulation administered via a safety syringe or an autoinjector, three 
clinical studies were conducted; a PK comparability study in healthy subjects (204958), and two Real-World Use 
studies in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma, one with the autoinjector (204958) and one with the safety 
syringe (205667). 
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy subjects

Page 31/63 
 
  
  
In  the  PK  comparability  study  (Study  204958),  244  healthy  subjects  were  administered  a  single  dose  of 
mepolizumab 100 mg SC by a health care professional. The primary PK endpoints were Cmax, AUC(0-∞), and 
AUC(0-t). 
The design of this study is considered acceptable. The parallel group design was appropriate given the long 
half-life  of  mepolizumab  and  the  potential  influence  of  immunogenicity  with  a  cross-over  design.  The 
demographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 3 treatment arms. The sampling 
time  points  were  adequate  for  characterisation  of  the  whole  mepolizumab  PK  profile,  including  the  late 
elimination phase. The collection of samples up to Day 85 ensured that the extrapolated portion of AUC(0-∞) 
was less than 20% in all subjects.  
The results provide evidence for statistical PK comparability between the liquid drug product, in a safety syringe 
or an autoinjector, and the lyophilised drug product. All 90% CIs of the geometric mean ratios of primary PK 
parameters  were  contained  well  within  the  predefined  equivalence  margin  (0.80  to  1.25).  The  similarity  of 
secondary  PK  parameters  (tmax,  apparent  clearance,  terminal  phase  half-life)  across  the  3  treatment  arms 
further supports the comparability of the liquid drug product (autoinjector or safety syringe) and the lyophilized 
drug product.  
In the exploratory PD component of this study, the geometric mean ratios of blood eosinophil counts for the 
comparisons of the liquid drug product in autoinjector and in safety syringe with the lyophilized drug product 
were approximately unity at the various time-points, with the 95% CIs for the ratios falling within bounds of 
0.70,  1.43  (±30%).  This  suggests  that  both  test  treatments  (liquid  drug  product  in  autoinjector  or  safety 
syringe) and lyophilized drug product had similar effects on blood eosinophils, although these wider confidence 
bounds were not defined or justified in the study protocol. 
Overall, the site of injection (abdomen, thigh, or arm) did not appear to markedly influence mepolizumab PK, 
nor the effect of mepolizumab on blood eosinophils, irrespective of drug product or device used. 
A number of other concerns were raised for this study, as follows: 
1.  At pre-dose, 11 subjects had measurable plasma mepolizumab concentrations, with 2 of these subjects 
having  pre-dose  concentrations  >5%  of  their  respective  Cmax.  In  line  with  the  EMA  bioequivalence 
guideline,  subjects  with  non-zero  baseline  concentrations  >5%  of  Cmax  should  be  excluded  from 
bioequivalence calculations. The applicant was asked to justify the non-exclusion of these 2 subjects 
from the statistical analysis. The applicant was also asked to provide an explanation for subjects having 
measurable mepolizumab concentrations before receiving the first dose. 
In response to this concern, the applicant conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding the 2 subjects with 
pre-dose concentration >5% of Cmax and the results showed that the exclusion of these 2 subjects had 
no impact on the interpretation of the study results. The applicant also provided confirmation that the 
method  used  for  sample  analysis  was  validated  for  being  accurate,  precise,  selective,  sensitive  and 
reproducible. This issue was concluded to be resolved. 
2.  The applicant reported performing a database unfreeze to allow for the reanalysis of PK samples with 
measurable  concentrations  prior  to  administration  of  mepolizumab  as  well  as  2  unexpectedly  high 
concentrations  (post-dosing),  and  to  investigate  a  potential  swapping  of  samples.  Derivation  of  PK 
parameters  and  statistical  analysis  had  not  been  completed  at  that  stage.  This  reanalysis  of  the  PK 
samples  resulted  in  final  PK  concentrations  for  15  samples  in  14  subjects  being  updated.  However, 
reanalysis of samples did not appear to be addressed in the study protocol. Therefore, in terms of the 
reanalysed  samples,  the  applicant  was  asked  to:  (i)  identify  and  provide  the  initial  value  of  the 
reanalysed  samples;  (ii)  provide  the  reason  for  reanalysis;  (iii)  provide  the  values  obtained  in  the 
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 32/63 
  
  
reanalysis; (iv) provide the finally accepted value; and (v) provide a justification for the acceptance of 
this value. 
In response to this concern, the applicant identified the samples and provided the rationale for their 
re-analysis. The initial value of the reanalysed samples, the values obtained in the re-analysis and the 
final  accepted  values  were  provided.  A  justification  for  the  acceptance  of  the  final  value  was  also 
provided. Given the low number of samples re-analysed, this was considered acceptable and the issue 
was concluded to be resolved. 
3.  The applicant was asked to clarify how data below the lower limit of quantification were handled. 
In response to this concern, the applicant provided an adequate clarification of how data below the LLOQ 
was handled and the matter was concluded to be resolved. 
4.  Pharmacokinetic data source Table 7.1 (Summary of Plasma Mepolizumab Concentration-Time Data by 
Treatment)  showed  that  data  were  imputed  at  pre-dose,  2  hours  and  8  hours  post-dose,  and  at 
follow-up time points. The study report stated that analyses were performed on all available data and 
that  no  imputation  was  performed  for  missing  data.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  explain  these 
imputations. 
In  response  to  this  concern,  the  applicant  explained  that  the  imputation  relates  to  BLQ  data  and 
confirmed that there was no imputation of missing data. The matter was concluded to be resolved. 
5.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  provide  the  following  (per  EMA  bioequivalence  guideline):  (i)  individual 
concentration data and PK parameters listed by drug product; (ii) the number of points on the terminal 
log-linear phase used to estimate the terminal rate constant for each subject; and (iii) the analysis of 
covariance tables, including the appropriate statistical tests of all effects in the model. 
In response to this concern, the applicant provided individual concentration data and PK parameters 
listed by drug product. In all subjects, the number of points on the terminal log-linear phase used to 
estimate the terminal rate constant for each subject was greater than three. The analysis of covariance 
tables, including the appropriate statistical tests of all effects in the model were provided and discussed. 
The matter was concluded to be resolved. 
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in severe eosinophilic asthma subjects 
In subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma, two repeat-dose Real-World Use studies of 100 mg SC every 4 
weeks for 12 weeks using liquid drug product in autoinjector (Study 204959) or safety syringe (Study 205667), 
showed consistent mepolizumab plasma trough concentrations and blood eosinophil counts.  
159 subjects and 56 subjects had samples collected for PK and PD assessment in  Study 204959 and Study 
205667, respectively. In each study, the mean mepolizumab plasma trough concentration increased following 
each self-administration, and at the End of Study Visit the mean mepolizumab plasma trough concentration was 
similar to that observed in subjects already receiving mepolizumab at Screening. Mean mepolizumab plasma 
trough concentrations were comparable in subjects using the liquid product in autoinjector or safety syringe. 
Mepolizumab 100 mg SC every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, using liquid drug product in autoinjector or safety syringe, 
resulted in a sustained reduction in blood eosinophil counts. The reductions observed in blood eosinophil counts 
using the liquid drug product in autoinjector or safety syringe were comparable. 
Plasma trough concentrations and blood eosinophil counts observed in these studies were indicative of correct 
self-administration by the subjects themselves (or their caregivers) using the autoinjector and safety syringe 
devices.

Overall, the site of injection (abdomen, thigh or arm) did not appear to markedly influence mepolizumab PK, nor 
the  effect  of  mepolizumab  on  blood  eosinophils,  irrespective  of  device  used.  However,  there  is  insufficient 
evidence to conclude no difference in the upper arm site of injection compared to the abdomen or thigh, with 
only 5 subjects in Study 204959 and 4 subjects in Study 205667 using the upper arm as a site of injection. 
Further discussion to support the recommendation of the 3 injection sites (upper arm, thigh and abdomen as per 
the proposed SmPC) is requested to be provided. 
In  response  to  this  concern,  the  applicant  explained  that  the  principal  data  supporting  the  similarity  of 
mepolizumab  between  the  three  sites  of  injection  (abdomen,  thigh  and  upper  arm)  comes  from  the  PK 
comparability study 204958, rather than from studies 204959 and 205667 which were real world use studies 
where the upper arm was only permitted as an injection site if the injection was administered by a caregiver. In 
the parallel group study 204958, injection site was randomised 1:1:1 to the abdomen, arm and thigh arm and 
80,  80  and  84  subjects  received  injections,  respectively.  For  each  of  the  three  PK  parameters  (AUC(0-∞), 
AUC(0-t) and Cmax) and three injection sites, the 90% confidence interval for eight out of the nine pairwise 
comparisons is contained within the 0.8, 1.25 bounds required to demonstrate PK comparability. The single 
exception; Cmax for arm vs. thigh, has a lower 90% confidence interval bound of 0.78, which is sufficiently close 
to 0.8 to be unremarkable. 
The explanation was considered adequate to support the conclusion of no difference in the upper arm site of 
injection compared to the abdomen or thigh. The matter was concluded to be resolved. 
Impact of immunogenicity on PK and PD of mepolizumab 
The post-baseline incidence of mepolizumab ADAs was consistently low across the three clinical studies, and 
there was no discernible impact of ADAs on mepolizumab plasma concentrations or blood eosinophil counts. No 
subjects tested positive for neutralising antibodies. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall,  the  PK  and  PD  of  mepolizumab  were  studied  and  characterised  sufficiently  for  this  application.  The 
applicant’s conclusions are generally supported. In healthy subjects, the PK of a single mepolizumab 100 mg SC 
dose,  administered  as  liquid  drug  product  using  either  autoinjector  or  safety  syringe,  was  shown  to  be 
statistically  comparable  to  the  PK  of  the  commercialized  lyophilized  drug  product.  In  subjects  with  severe 
eosinophilic asthma, two repeat dose Real-World Use studies of 100 mg SC mepolizumab every 4 weeks for 12 
weeks  using  liquid  drug  product  in  autoinjector  or  safety  syringe,  showed  consistent  mepolizumab  plasma 
trough  concentrations.  The  reductions  in  blood  eosinophil  counts  observed  using  the  liquid  drug  product  in 
autoinjector or safety syringe were comparable, and comparable with the lyophilized drug product. 
No major objections were raised with the PK or PD analyses. Some other concerns were raised to which the 
applicant responded adequately. All of these issues were concluded to be resolved. 
2.4.5.  Clinical efficacy 
GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  is  submitting  this  application  to  obtain  marketing  approval  for  a  new  drug  form 
(mepolizumab  injection,  liquid  drug  product)  of  mepolizumab  in  the  same  and  future  indications  currently 
registered for the Nucala lyophilised drug product (mepolizumab for injection). 
Only limited efficacy data were provided as part of this application.

The mepolizumab liquid drug product clinical development programme consisted of 3 studies which support this 
application:  1  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  comparability  study  in  healthy  volunteers  and  2  Real-World-Use  (RWU) 
studies in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. All 3 studies assessed the safety profile of the mepolizumab 
liquid drug product.  
2 Real-World-Use (RWU) studies are discussed in the PK, efficacy and safety section of this assessment report.  
The  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  comparability  study  is  discussed  in  the  PK  and  safety  section  of  this  assessment 
report.  
In addition the applicant performed Human Factors studies on the instructions for use in the Nucala leaflet. They 
are discussed in the efficacy section as well.  
2.4.6.  Dose response study 
Not applicable. 
2.4.7.  Main study 
There are no main studies in this application, only supportive studies described below. 
Supportive studies 
Real-world use studies 204959 and 205667 
Two separate open-label, single-arm, multi-dose, multi-center, 12-week studies were conducted to investigate 
the real-world use of an autoinjector (204959) and a safety syringe (205667) in subjects ≥12 years of age with 
severe eosinophilic asthma. In study 204959, two autoinjector device labels were used: standard device label + 
pictogram and standard device label. 
The  objective  of  these  studies  was  to  assess  the  correct  real-world  use  of  the  devices  for  the  repeat 
self-administration (or caregiver administration) of mepolizumab 100 mg SC by determining the proportion of 
subjects who were successfully able to self-administer a dose. Three doses of mepolizumab were administered: 
the first and third injections (Week 0 and Week 8) were self-administered under observation in the clinic; the 
second injection (Week 4) was self-administered at home. Training on the study treatment, device handling and 
administration techniques, including a review of the instructions for use (IFU), was provided by the investigator 
or  qualified  site  staff  immediately  prior  to  self-administration  of  the  first  dose  at  Week  0.  Quantitative  and 
qualitative subject feedback regarding the device use and the IFU were obtained at the end of each study. The 
primary endpoint for both studies was the proportion of subjects who were successfully able to self-administer 
their third observed dose at Week 8. 
For  each  self-administration  (or  caregiver  administration),  injection  success  was  determined  by  the 
investigator/site  staff,  by  reviewing  the  steps  required  to  successfully  administer  the  injection  against  a 
checklist (i.e., Observer Checklist for in-clinic administrations or the At-Home Checklist for injections outside the 
clinic)  alongside  findings  from  the  visual  inspection  of  the  device  following  the  injection  (in-clinic 
administrations) or when returned to the site. 
At the end of the study, the individual who performed the injections (subject or caregiver) completed a Device 
Usability/Functionality Questionnaire which captured the individual’s perception of the training provided by the 
investigator/site staff for use of the device, the IFU supplied, and the usability and convenience of the device.

Exit Interviews were conducted in a subset of subjects at selected sites within 6 weeks following the final visit to 
qualitatively assess their experience with mepolizumab liquid drug product in an autoinjector (with either device 
label) or safety syringe. Exit Interviews were conducted over the telephone in a semi-structured format by a 
trained interviewer and analysed by a third-party provider. 
Results 
159 subjects were enrolled in the autoinjector study (104 using the standard device label + pictogram and 55 
using the standard device label) and 56 subjects were enrolled in the safety  syringe study. The majority of 
subjects (73% in Study 204959 and 71% in Study 205667) had no prior self-injection experience. 
Nearly  all  subjects  (≥98%)  completed  the  studies.  Three  subjects  discontinued  prematurely.  None  of  the 
withdrawals were considered related to study treatment by the investigator.  
Autoinjector assessment (Study 204959) 
Assessment of injection success 
•  Autoinjector with Standard Device Label + Pictogram 
For  the  primary  endpoint,  all  but  one  subject  (>99%)  successfully  self-administered  the  third  dose  of 
mepolizumab on the first attempt at Week 8 using the standard device label + pictogram autoinjector (Table 
11).  The  one  subject  who  had  an  unsuccessful  injection  made  a  per-protocol  error  of  selecting  an  incorrect 
injection site (upper arm), but received the dose of study treatment. 
Over  the  course  of  the  study,  injection  success  rate  was  high  with  95%  of  subjects  able  to 
self-administer/caregivers administer all three doses of mepolizumab on the first attempt using the standard 
device label + pictogram autoinjector. Five subjects (5%) had an unsuccessful injection due to one or more user 
errors, 3 due to selecting the incorrect injection site per-protocol (upper arm intended for caregiver only), one 
due to pulling the autoinjector away before the end of the injection on the first dose, and one due to a reported 
device error (unsubstantiated following root-cause analysis) prior to the second dose. Four of the 5 subjects 
corrected  their  errors  at  subsequent  injections;  the  5th  subject  selected  the  incorrect  injection  site  for  the 
injection of two doses.

•  Autoinjector with Standard Device Label 
For  the  primary  endpoint,  all  but  one  subject  (98%)  successfully  self-administered  the  third  dose  of 
mepolizumab on the first attempt at Week 8 using the standard device label autoinjector (Table 12). The one 
subject  who  had  an  unsuccessful  injection  made  a  per  protocol  error  of  selecting  an  incorrect  injection  site 
(upper arm), but received the dose of study treatment. 
Over the course of the study, injection success rate was high with 89% of subjects able to self-administer (or 
caregivers  administer)  all  three  doses  of  mepolizumab  (Weeks  0,  4  and  8)  on  the  first  attempt  using  the 
standard device label autoinjector. Six subjects (11%) had an unsuccessful injection each due to one or more 
user errors: 4 due to pulling the autoinjector away before the end of the injection (2 on the first dose and 2 on 
the  second  dose),  one  due  to  a  reported  device  error  on  the  first  dose  (leakage  from  injection  site  when 
removing the autoinjector), which was unsubstantiated following root-cause analysis, and one due to selecting 
the  incorrect  injection  site  (upper  arm).  All  subjects  corrected  their  errors  at  subsequent  injections,  as 
applicable.

Device usability and functionality 
Responses from the usability/functionality questionnaire revealed an overall positive experience from subjects 
(or their caregivers) regarding the training provided by the investigator/site staff, clarity of the IFU, and the 
usability of the standard device label + pictogram autoinjector or the standard device label autoinjector (Table 
13). 
Subjects/caregivers felt comfortable with the in-clinic training provided on the autoinjector, and only a small 
percentage  of  subjects  (11%  to  12%)  requested  additional  guidance  (review  of  the  IFU  and/or  answering 
questions related to the IFU) prior to the unobserved, at home injection. Most subjects/caregivers found the IFU 
steps to be clear and understandable. 
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 39/63 
 
  
  
Most subjects/caregivers felt confident using the autoinjector based on the IFU and their ability, and found it 
easy  and  convenient  to  use.  Nearly  all  of  the  153  subjects  questioned  (99%)  expressed  that  they  would 
recommend  the  mepolizumab  liquid  drug  product  in  an  autoinjector  to  other  patients  with  asthma.  Of  the 
subjects  previously  receiving  mepolizumab  administered  by  a  HCP  (n=72),  almost  all  (96%)  expressed  a 
preference for receiving mepolizumab using an autoinjector at home rather than an injection administered by a 
HCP. 
Exit interviews 
Reponses from the Exit Interviews conducted in a subset of 25 subjects at selected sites who used either the 
standard device label + pictogram autoinjector (n=11) or the standard device label autoinjector (n=14), were 
consistent with the positive findings from the device usability/functionality questionnaire. During the interviews, 
subjects generally expressed that feelings of anxiety or concern associated with autoinjector use decreased after 
the first administration. All subjects reported that the ease and convenience of self-administering mepolizumab 
using the autoinjector underpinned their positive impressions and all interviewed subjects saw no problems in 
incorporating the self-injection using the autoinjector into their lifestyles. Around half (48%) of subjects stated 
that they felt pain when using the autoinjector, but stated that it was mild and localised to the injection site. 
Reliability 
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 40/63 
 
 
  
  
No  substantiated  device  failures  occurred  with  the  autoinjector  during  the  Real-World  Use  clinical  study. 
Additionally,  when  100  of  the  returned  autoinjectors  used  by  subjects/caregivers  in  Study  204959  were 
inspected as a representative sample of used autoinjectors, no undetected malfunctions were found. 
Safety syringe assessment (Study 205667) 
Assessment of injection success 
In the Real-World Use study, a 100% injection success rate was reported across all injection endpoints with the 
safety syringe (Table 9). All subjects/caregivers were reported by the investigator/site staff to have successfully 
self-administered their first, second, and third dose of mepolizumab liquid drug product using the safety syringe. 
Device usability and functionality 
Responses from the usability/functionality questionnaire revealed an overall positive experience from subjects 
(or their caregivers) regarding the training provided by the investigator/site staff, the IFU, and the usability of 
the safety syringe (Table 10). 
Most subjects/caregivers were comfortable with the training provided on the safety syringe and only a small 
number  of  subjects  (6  subjects,  11%)  requested  additional  guidance  (review  of  the  IFU  and/or  answering 
questions related to the IFU) prior to the unobserved, at home injection. Most subjects/caregivers found the IFU 
steps to be clear and understandable. 
Most subjects/caregivers felt confident using the safety syringe based on the IFU and their ability, and found it 
easy  and  convenient  to  use.  All  but  one  of  the  56  subjects  questioned  (98%)  expressed  that  they  would 
recommend  the  mepolizumab  liquid  drug  product  in  a  safety  syringe  to  other  patients  with  asthma.  Of  the 
subjects  previously  receiving  mepolizumab  administered  by  a  HCP  (n=23),  all  but  one  (96%)  expressed  a 
preference for receiving mepolizumab using a safety syringe at home rather than an injection administered by 
a HCP.

Exit interviews 
Responses from the Exit Interviews conducted in a subset of subjects at selected sites (n=7) were consistent 
with the positive findings from the device usability/functionality questionnaire. During the interviews, subjects 
expressed that the text and pictures on the IFU were detailed and easy to understand, that feelings of anxiety 
associated with safety syringe use decreased and their confidence increased as they became more familiar with 
the device, and minimal to no discomfort was associated with use of the safety syringe. 
Reliability 
No device failures were reported with the safety syringe device during the Real-World Use clinical study. 
Overall conclusions 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The device assessment results have shown that: 
The autoinjector and safety syringe can be correctly used by a representative population to successfully 
perform a self-injection procedure. 
The representative patient population and their caregivers can comprehend, learn from, and utilize the 
IFU to successfully administer a dose of medication.  
The IFU are understood by HCPs and are sufficient to utilize for any training that is required for their 
patients.  
Patients are confident with self-administration outside of the clinical setting. 
The autoinjector and safety syringe are reliable; no device failures occurred.

Summary and evaluation of Human Factors studies on the instructions for use in the Nucala leaflet. 
A product-line extension for Nucala 100 mg solution for subcutaneous injection in pre-filled pen or pre-filled 
syringe. This medicine is administered, by 4-weekly subcutaneous (SC) injection; it may be self-administered by 
the patient, or administered by a caregiver, if their healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate and 
the patient or caregiver is trained in injection techniques. 
The package leaflet (PL) for Nucala 100 mg solution for injection is supplied in a multi-part assembly, with a 
separate, detachable leaflet for each language. Sections 1 to 6 of the PL are printed on one side of the leaflet; 
on  the  other  side  are  the  Instructions  for  Use  (IFU)  of  the  device  used  for  injection—the  pre-filled  pen  or 
pre-filled syringe. 
Development and testing of the US IFU 
The IFU were originally developed in the US, where—together with the relevant injection device — they were 
subject to usability testing, in the form of two comprehensive Human Factors Validation studies carried out and 
completed in April 2018. Testing was conducted in an environment designed to simulate that of a medical clinic 
or a home, as applicable to the participant group. 
For the pre-filled pen, the study was conducted with a total of 75 participants (see below for an explanation 
of ‘trained’ and ‘untrained’): 
◆ 15 adult asthma patients—‘untrained’ 
◆ 15 juvenile asthma patients—‘trained’ 
◆ 15 adult COPD patients—‘trained’ 
◆ 15 adult family caregivers—‘untrained’ 
◆ 15 healthcare providers (HCPs)—‘untrained’ 
For the pre-filled syringe, the study was conducted with a total of 90 participants: 
◆ 15 adult asthma patients—‘untrained’ 
◆ 30 juvenile asthma patients—15 ‘trained’; 15 ‘untrained’ 
◆ 30 adult COPD patients — 15 ‘trained’; 15 ‘untrained’ 
◆ 15 adult caregivers—‘untrained’’ 
No participant had prior experience of the IFU being tested. A minority had previously used a pre-filled pen or 
pre-filled syringe for injecting other products. 
Participants  were  selected  across  a  wide  demographic  range,  in  terms  of  age,  education  and  other 
ability-affecting conditions such as visual, motor or neurological impairment. 
The family caregivers were people with experience of caring for someone with any medical condition. 
The  HCPs  were  selected  to  represent  those  who  might  treat  patients  with  asthma  or  COPD  and  might  be 
responsible for training them to use the pre-filled pen or pre-filled syringe. 
The study was designed to reflect as accurately as possible the circumstances in which Nucala will be used. All 
injections  performed  were  simulated  into  an  injection  pad  placed  over  the  injection  site  assigned  to  the 
participant, or placed onto a manikin for caregivers and HCPs.

Caregivers and HCPs were all assigned the upper arm as injection site; other participants were assigned the 
abdomen or thigh, in equal numbers. 
‘Trained’ participants (juvenile asthma patients and adult COPD patients) attended one training session, during 
which  they  reviewed  the  IFU  and  were  given  a  verbal  description  of  the  injection  procedure  (but  no  actual 
demonstration). At the end of this first session, they performed one supervised injection. Approximately one 
week  later,  they  attended  a  second  session,  when  they  performed  one  unaided  injection,  answered 
comprehension and knowledge probe questions, and gave feedback on the IFU. 
All  other  participants  (‘untrained’)  attended  a  single  session,  at  which  they  were  given  time  to  familiarise 
themselves  with  the  IFU  and  device,  then  performed  one  unaided  injection,  answered  comprehension  and 
knowledge probe questions, and gave feedback on the IFU. 
Performance 
For the pre-filled pen, 73 of the 75 participants (97%) were successful in injecting to achieve a full dose of 
Nucala.  Two  participants  lifted  the  pen  from  the  skin  early,  which  would  have  resulted  in  an  incomplete 
dose—one ‘trained’ patient was not referring to the IFU when she carried out the injection, thinking she could do 
it from memory; one ‘untrained’ caregiver did not thoroughly read the IFU before injecting. Neither failure could 
therefore be attributed to inadequacies in the IFU. 
For the pre-filled syringe, all 90 participants (100%) successfully carried out the full injection procedure to 
achieve a full dose of Nucala. 
There was no significant difference in performance between ‘trained’ and ‘untrained’ participants. 
Knowledge and comprehension 
For  the  pre-filled  pen,  there  was  a  99.7%  success  rate  for  correctly  answering  specific  knowledge  probe 
questions, demonstrating that users could correctly identify and interpret information in the IFU regarding: 
◆ storage of the pen before use 
◆ leaving the pen for 30 minutes to come to room temperature before injecting 
◆ how to dispose of a used pen (US-specific) 
There  was  a  100%  success  rate  for  comprehension  of  information  about  all  stages  of  the  preinjection  and 
injection procedure. 
For the pre-filled syringe, there was a 99.7% success rate for correctly answering specific knowledge probe 
questions, demonstrating that users could correctly identify and interpret information in the IFU regarding: 
◆ storage of the pen before use 
◆ how to inspect the solution in the pen before use 
◆ the need to wait 30 minutes for the solution to reach room temperature 
◆ the allowable injection sites 
◆ how to dispose of a used pen (US-specific) 
There  was  a  99.8%  success  rate  for  comprehension  of  information  about  all  stages  of  the  preinjection  and 
injection procedure.

Subjective feedback 
Asked for general feedback on the quality of the IFU, all participants stated that they found it easy to read, 
understand and follow. 
Modification of the IFU for EU markets 
Some relatively minor amendments were made to the IFU for the EU PL, while preserving the essential elements 
of structure, design, layout and wording of the US version. This is acceptable for the CHMP. 
Conclusions and recommendations 
The MAH conducted two human factor studies for the prefilled syringe and the prefilled pen. The studies enrolled 
adult and juvenile patients, caregivers and healthcare professional and consisted of both trained and untrained 
cohorts.  
For the pre-filled pen, enrolled 75 patients of which 73 participants (97%) were successful in injecting to achieve 
a  full  dose  of  Nucala.    There  was  a  99.7%  success  rate  for  correctly  answering  specific  knowledge  probe 
questions, demonstrating that users could correctly identify and interpret information 
For the pre-filled syringe, enrolled 90 patients, all 90 (100%) successfully carried out the full injection procedure 
to achieve a full dose of Nucala. 
There was no significant difference in performance between ‘trained’ and ‘untrained’ participants. 
There  was  a  99.8%  success  rate  for  comprehension  of  information  about  all  stages  of  the  preinjection  and 
injection procedure. 
To further reduce risk of incorrect administration the SPC currently states Nucala may be self-administered by 
the patient or administered by a caregiver if their healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate and 
the patient or caregiver are trained in injection techniques. 
2.4.8.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The  methodology  of  the  two  real-world  use  studies  (204959  and  205667)  is  acceptable.  The  applicant’s 
conclusions are supported. These studies demonstrated the usability of the auto-injector and safety syringe, 
including self-administration outside of the clinic, in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. The efficacy data 
are limited in this application however this is acceptable as it pertains to the approval of a new formulation. No 
major objections or other concerns are raised. 
The two human factor studies were well designed and competently conducted. The results constitute sufficient 
validation that the Instructions For Use in the EU PL are readable, comprehensible and usable by the target user 
population.  
2.4.9.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The two real-world use studies (204959 and 205667) demonstrated the usability of the auto-injector and safety 
syringe,  including  self-administration  outside  of  the  clinic,  in  patients  with  severe  eosinophilic  asthma.  The 
results of the two human factor studies can be taken to constitute sufficient validation that the IFU in the EU PL 
are readable, comprehensible and usable by the target user population. No further testing of the IFU for the EU 
PL is recommended.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Mepolizumab is currently authorized as a lyophilised powder (100 mg single-dose vial), reconstituted in 1 mL of 
sterile  water  for  injection  prior  to  subcutaneous  (SC)  injection.  GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  has  developed 
mepolizumab as a liquid drug product which will be provided as a solution (100 mg/mL) in a prefilled syringe 
assembled into either a safety syringe or an autoinjector device. In this section the safety data available for 
liquid formulations are being discussed.  A total of 196 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma received ≥1 dose 
of mepolizumab 100 mg SC in real-world use (RWU) studies. The majority of subjects in the RWU Studies (71%) 
participated in only the autoinjector Study 204959 and represented a maximum of 3 months exposure. Nineteen 
subjects (10%) enrolled and received mepolizumab liquid drug product in both studies (Study 205667 followed 
by  Study  204959)  and  represented  a  maximum  of  6  months  exposure.  Demographic  and  baseline 
characteristics of patients enrolled to RWU studies was similar to those enrolled into the pivotal studies e.g. 60 
% of subjects were females, the mean age was around 50, the majority of patients were white.  
Table  1  -  Subjects  Treated  with  Mepolizumab  100  mg  SC  (RWU  Studies,  Safety  Population)
Table 2 - Mepolizumab Exposure (RWU Studies, Safety Population) 
In addition 244 healthy adult subjects received a single dose of mepolizumab 100 mg SC in study 204958 e.g 85 
subjects  received lyophilised drug product, 80 subjects received  liquid drug product in a safety syringe, and 79 
subjects liquid drug product in an autoinjector.

Finally 245 subjects with nasal polyposis are being treated with Mepolizumab liquid drug product or placebo in 
ongoing phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  
The Applicant confirmed that there is no post-marketing data are available for liquid formulations. 
Adverse events 
1. 2 real-world use studies: 205667- safety syringe and 204959- autoinjector 
A total of 71 subjects (36%), including 5/11 adolescents enrolled, reported on-treatment AEs, and 6 subjects 
(3%) reported events considered related to mepolizumab by the investigator. 
Two subjects (1%) had events which led to treatment discontinuation and study withdrawal (1 subject due to an 
SAE of asthma and 1 subject due to 6 SAEs associated +with a road traffic accident). On-treatment SAEs were 
reported for 7 subjects (4%), none of which were fatal. 
Table 3 - Adverse Event Summary (RWU Studies, Safety Population)
AEs  in  the  Infections  and  infestations  SOC  were  the  most  commonly  (≥3%)  reported  during  the  treatment 
period in the RWU Studies (20% of subjects). AEs in the Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders SOC 
were the next most frequently reported (8% of subjects).

Safety in healthy subjects — study 204958 
In total, 34% of subjects reported an on-treatment AE (29%, 34%, and 38% for the lyophilised drug product, 
liquid drug product in an autoinjector, and liquid drug product in a safety syringe, respectively). Headache (9%), 
viral upper respiratory tract infection (5%) and fatigue (3%) were the most frequently reported AEs across the 
treatment groups. 
Twenty two percent of subjects had AEs that were considered related to mepolizumab by the investigator (20%, 
22%, and 25% for the lyophilised drug product, liquid drug product in an autoinjector, and liquid drug product 
in  a  safety  syringe,  respectively)  with  headache  (7%)  and  fatigue  (4%)  reported  most  frequently.  No 
on-treatment SAEs or fatal SAEs were reported during the study.

Table 6 - Adverse Event Summary (Study 204958, Safety Population) 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
In the RWU Studies twelve on-treatment non-fatal SAEs were reported for 7 subjects however none of these 
SAEs were considered related to mepolizumab by the investigator. No deaths were reported. 
No on-treatment SAEs or fatal SAEs were reported during study 204958 in healthy subjects.  
Laboratory findings 
There were no apparent treatment effects on clinical chemistry, liver function tests or haematology values were 
seen in the RWU Studies. 
Safety in special populations 
No apparent differences in the safety profile in special populations enrolled to the RWU studies were noted. Only 
11 subjects in the 12-17-year subgroup participated in the RWU studies. 5 out 11 subjects reported any AE. The 
AEs  (PTs)  reported  by  the  12-17-year  subgroup  were  similar  to  the  other  subgroups  and  to  the  overall 
population. The overall incidence of on-treatment AEs was 40% in females and 31% in males, and overall AE 
profiles were similar for males and females. The white racial group comprised most of the population (161/196

subjects) and the profile of AEs by SOC in this subgroup was similar to the overall population.  All other racial 
groups had few subjects. 
Immunological events 
1.  Real-world use studies: 205667- safety syringe and 204959- autoinjector 
ADA assessments were conducted for all 196 subjects at Baseline and 192 subjects at Week 12/EW Visit (as 
applicable). Positive ADA results were reported for a total of 7 subjects (4%) at Baseline and 4 subjects (2%) at 
the  Week  12/EW  Visit.  Of  the  subjects  with  a  positive  ADA  result  at  Baseline  all  but  2  were  receiving 
mepolizumab  at  Screening.  Of  the  subjects  with  a  positive  ADA  result  at  Week  12,  1  was  receiving  current 
treatment with mepolizumab at Screening. There were 2 subjects who had positive ADA results at both Baseline 
and Week 12. 1 was receiving mepolizumab at Screening and the other was not. No subject positive for ADAs 
tested  positive  for  neutralising  antibodies.  None  of  the  19  subjects  who  participated  in  both  studies  tested 
positive for ADAs.  
One subject who was not receiving mepolizumab at Screening, tested positive at both Baseline and at the Week 
12 visit, and had an increase in titre value from 16 at Baseline to 5120 at Week 12. This 40 year old female had 
not participated in any other mepolizumab clinical trials prior to Study 204959. 
The  reported  current  medical  conditions  at  baseline  were  eosinophilic  asthma,  nasal  polyps,  sinusitis,  and 
hypercholesterolemia. The 1 AE reported for this subject was a non-serious event of injection site haemorrhage, 
of  mild  intensity  that  resolved  within  10  days.  This  subject  completed  the  study.  For  this  subject,  the 
mepolizumab  plasma  trough  concentration  values  remained  similar  during  the  treatment  period  with  no 
evidence of accumulation of drug despite repeat dosing following mepolizumab treatment initiation (204959 
CSR Listing 20). There was no evidence of mepolizumab PD (blood eosinophil counts) being affected by the 
presence of ADAs (204959 CSR Listing 41).

Table 7 - Summary of Baseline and Post-Baseline Binding ADA Assay Results (RWU Studies, Safety 
Population)
Among the 4 subjects with positive ADA results at the Week 12, 2 subjects reported on-treatment AEs during the 
study.  On  subject  a  44  year  old  female  reported  4  AEs:  dyspepsia,  tachycardia,  fatigue  (all  of  moderate 
intensity), and wheezing (severe intensity); none considered related to mepolizumab by the investigator. All 
events occurred after the first dose, were non-serious, resolved with continued study treatment, and the subject 
completed the study. 
2. Safety in healthy subjects — study 204958 
ADA assessments were conducted at 5 visits during the study, Screening, Day 1 (Baseline), Day 29, Day 43, and 
Follow-up. 
Positive ADA results were reported for 11 subjects (5%) post-Baseline: 4%, 4%, and 6% for the lyophilised drug 
product,  liquid  drug  product  in  safety  syringe,  and  liquid  drug  product  in  autoinjector  respectively.  None  of 
whom tested positive for neutralising antibodies.  
ADA measurements for 9 subjects were classified as persistent positive. 
Titres were generally low, with a maximum titre of 320 observed at Study Day 29 in 1 subject treated with the 
liquid drug product in a safety syringe. 
None of the 9 subjects with persistent positive post-Baseline ADA results reported on-treatment AEs. One of the 
2 subjects  who had a transient positive ADA result on Study Day 29 (titre value: 16), reported non-serious AEs 
of oropharyngeal discomfort at Study Day 2 and an event of systemic reaction (hypersensitivity) with symptom 
of pruritus at Study Day 13 categorised as other systemic reaction by the investigator.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted. No new data were provided.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
Two subjects (1%) were discontinued from treatment and withdrawn from the RWU Studies for the reason of 
AEs 1 subject due to an asthma exacerbation and 1 subject due to 6 SAEs associated with a road traffic accident.  
No subject was withdrawn due to AES from study 204958 in healthy subjects.  
Post marketing experience 
There is no post-marketing data are available for liquid formulations. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A  total  of  196  patients  with  severe  eosinophilic  asthma  received  ≥1  dose  of  mepolizumab  100  mg  SC  in 
real-world  use  (RWU)  studies.  The  majority  of  subjects  in  the  RWU  Studies  (71%)  participated  in  only  the 
autoinjector  Study  204959  and  represented  a  maximum  of  3  months  exposure.  Nineteen  subjects  (10%) 
enrolled  and  received  mepolizumab  liquid  drug  product  in  both  studies  (Study  205667  followed  by  Study 
204959)  and  represented  a  maximum  of  6  months  exposure.  Demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  of 
patients enrolled to RWU studies was similar to those enrolled into the pivotal studies e.g. 60 % of subjects were 
females, the mean age was around 50, the majority of patients were white.  
In addition 244 healthy adult subjects received a single dose of mepolizumab 100 mg SC in study 204958 e.g 85 
subjects received lyophilised drug product, 80 subjects received liquid drug product in a safety syringe, and 79 
subjects liquid drug product in an autoinjector.  
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 52/63 
 
  
  
Finally 245 subjects with nasal polyposis are being treated with Mepolizumab liquid drug product or placebo in 
ongoing phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  
In real-world use (RWU) studies a total of 71 subjects (36%), including 5/11 adolescents enrolled, reported 
on-treatment AEs, and 6 subjects (3%) reported events considered related to mepolizumab by the investigator. 
The types of common adverse events reported during the RWU Studies were similar to those reported in the 
pivotal studies. The most commonly (≥3%) reported on-treatment AEs in the RWU Studies were nasopharyngitis 
(5%), headache (4%), upper respiratory tract infection (4%), and urinary tract infection (3%). However the 
data is very limited in duration and in terms of adolescents therefore longer term safety is not well documented 
and comparative safety to adults cannot be concluded however is not anticipated to be different.  
In the RWU Studies twelve on-treatment non-fatal SAEs were reported for 7 subjects however none of these 
SAEs were considered related to mepolizumab by the investigator. No deaths were reported. 
In a single dose study in healthy subjects on-treatment AEs were reported in 34% of subjects (29%, 34%, and 
38% for the lyophilised drug product, liquid drug product in an autoinjector, and liquid drug product in a safety 
syringe, respectively). The type and frequency of reported AEs do not raise concern. No on-treatment SAEs or 
fatal SAEs were reported during this study. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) that were prospectively identified in the severe asthma programme 
and remained AESIs throughout the mepolizumab clinical programme include: 
-systemic (allergic [type I hypersensitivity] and other systemic) reactions,   
-local injection site reactions,  
-infections, including serious and opportunistic, malignancies, 
-serious cardiac, vascular, and thromboembolic (CVT) events. 
Anaphylaxis  or  allergic/Type  I  hypersensitivity  was  not  reported  in  the  RWU  studies  nor  in  healthy  subject 
studies. Other type systemic reactions were reported for 12 subjects (1 in the RWU studies and 11 in healthy 
subject studies). All but 1 were of mild or moderate intensity. One subject who received mepolizumab liquid drug 
product reported the non-serious AE of drug hypersensitivity with an intensity of severe 6 days after dosing. 
Symptoms included fatigue, pharyngeal discomfort, swallowing difficulties, acute diarrhoea and submandibular 
swelling. The event had a duration of 4 days and was reported as recovered/resolved. The SmPC includes the 
following  statement:  Acute  and  delayed  systemic  reactions,  including  hypersensitivity  reactions  (e.g. 
anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hypotension), have occurred following administration 
of Nucala. 
In the RWU studies 9 local injection site reactions were reported for 5 subjects (3%) including 2 adolescents. 
One subject, an adolescent who participated in both Study 205667 and Study 204959, reported 5 injection site 
reactions (3 injection site erythema and 2 injection site reaction), 2 of mild intensity and 3 of moderate. 
In the heathy subjects study, events of local injection site reaction were reported for 4 subjects (2%): 1 subject 
in the lyophilised drug product group, 1 subject in the liquid drug product autoinjector and 2 subjects in the 
liquid drug product safety syringe group. 
The following information is present in the SmPC for Nucala in relation to local injection site reactions: In 2 
placebo-controlled studies the incidence of local injection site reactions with mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneous 
and placebo was 8% and 3%, respectively. These events were all non-serious, mild to moderate in intensity and 
the majority resolved within a few days. Local injection site reactions occurred mainly at the start of treatment 
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 53/63 
  
  
and within the first 3 injections with fewer reports on subsequent injections. The most common manifestations 
reported with these events included pain, erythema, swelling, itching, and burning sensation. 
No serious infections, malignancy, or serious CVT events were reported. 
The currently available data from the severe asthma studies indicating that mepolizumab has low immunogenic 
potential. In the context of the current procedure the ADA responses were investigated in the two real-world use 
studies where patients were treated with new liquid formulations only (205667- safety syringe and 204959- 
autoinjector). In addition the ADA responses were investigated in study 204958 in healthy subjects where the 
currently approved lyophilised drug product as well as new liquid drug products were tested.  
In the RWU studies the applicant investigated the antibody response at baseline and at week 12 (at end of trial 
visit). No assessment of ADA response at follow up was performed in the RWU studies. 
In these studies the positive ADA results were reported for a total of 7 subjects (4%) at Baseline and 4 subjects 
(2%)  at  the  Week  12/EW  Visit.  No  subject  positive  for  ADAs  tested  positive  for  neutralising  antibodies.  In 
general in the RWU studies the ADA response seems to be not greater than the ADA response observed in the 
originally  submitted  pivotal  studies  although  the  comparison  between  these  studies  is  difficult  e.g.  a  short 
duration of the RWU studies and the lack of the  follow-up assessment is likely to underestimate the overall 
antibody occurrence.  
One subject who was not receiving mepolizumab at Screening, tested positive at both Baseline and at the Week 
12 visit, and had an increase in titre value from 16 at Baseline to 5120 at Week 12. 1 AE reported for this subject 
was  a  non-serious  event  of  injection  site  haemorrhage,  of  mild  intensity  that  resolved  within  10  days.  As 
indicated by the applicant no changes in PK profile of mepolizumab in this subject was reported. Such high titre 
value was not reported in any subject in three pivotal studies. One additional subject with the ADA positive 
response  reported  4  AEs:  dyspepsia,  tachycardia,  fatigue  (all  of  moderate  intensity),  and  wheezing  (severe 
intensity). 
In study healthy subjects (study 204958) ADA assessments were conducted at 5 visits during the study e.g. at 
Screening, Day 1 (Baseline), Day 29, Day 43, and Follow-up. In this study positive ADA results were reported for 
11 subjects (5%) post-Baseline: 4%, 4%, and 6% for the lyophilised drug product, liquid drug product in safety 
syringe,  and  liquid  drug  product  in  autoinjector  respectively.  None  of  whom  tested  positive  for  neutralising 
antibodies.  ADA  measurements  for  9  subjects  were  classified  as  persistent  positive.  One  subject  with  the 
positive ADA response reported non-serious AEs of oropharyngeal discomfort at Study Day 2 and an event of 
systemic reaction (hypersensitivity) with symptom of pruritus at Study Day 13. 
Based on the provided data, no apparent differences in the ADA response between lyophilised drug product and 
liquid drug products were noted.  
AEs were reported in single patients with the positive ADA response e.g 2 subjects in the RWS and 1 subject in 
study 204958. 
No apparent differences in the safety profile in special populations enrolled to the RWU studies were noted, 
although the data is quite limited. Only 11 subjects in the 12-17-year subgroup participated in the RWU studies. 
5 out 11 subjects reported any AE. The AEs (PTs) reported by the 12-17-year subgroup were similar to the other 
subgroups and to the overall population. The overall incidence of on-treatment AEs was 40% in females and 
31% in males, and overall AE profiles were similar for males and females. The White racial group comprised 
most of the population (161/196 subjects) and the profile of AEs by SOC in this subgroup was similar to the 
overall population.  All other racial groups had few subjects.

The above safety data collated in the PK comparability study 204958 and Real World Use studies 204959 and 
205667 with the liquid drug product give reassurance regarding the safety profile of new liquid formulation . 
Comparable in-vitro biochemical and biophysical properties, together with  the same drug product specifications 
for the liquid and lyophilized products and comparable systemic exposure between the liquid and lyophilized 
drug products in the pharmacokinetic study (PK comparability study 204958) concur to provide bridge between 
the  formulations.  Overall  no  new  safety  findings  were  observed  with  the  new  formulation  compared  to  the 
current approved lyophilized product. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No major safety issues were identified in the clinical data provided with the new formulation. The safety profile 
is considered comparable to the safety profile observed with the current formulation.

2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: There is no need to submit 
a user testing for the proposed changes. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nucala (mepolizumab) is already included in  the 
additional monitoring list. 
Therefore  the  summary  of  product  characteristics  and  the  package  leaflet  includes  a  statement  that  this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Asthma is a chronic airway disease affecting approximately 334 million people worldwide and is responsible for 
approximately 250,000 premature deaths each year. 
Asthma prevalence varies by geographical region. Accurate assessment of the prevalence of asthma has been 
hindered  by  varying  definitions  of  asthma  and  methods  of  data  collection,  each  combining  to  make  data 
comparison across studies difficult. 
Risk factors include sex (gender influence varies with age), airway hyper reactivity, atopy, allergens, infections, 
tobacco smoke, obesity, and perinatal factors. 
Asthma is common in adolescents but is frequently undiagnosed because of under-reporting of symptoms. 
There  is  no  single  diagnostic  test  for  asthma,  the  diagnosis  is  a  clinical  one.  The  absence  of  consistent 
gold-standard  diagnostic  criteria  means  that  it  is  not  possible  to  make  unequivocal  evidence-based 
recommendations on how to make a diagnosis of asthma. The diagnosis of asthma in children and adults is 
based on the recognition of a characteristic pattern of respiratory symptoms, signs and test results and the 
absence of any alternative explanation for these. 
Typical symptoms of asthma include periodic wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and cough, all of 
which worsen at night. Patients with asthma experience exacerbations of these symptoms which acutely worsen 
in response to various triggers such as allergens, microbes, and pollutants, resulting in significant reductions in 
expiratory flow as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1second (FEV). 
Symptoms and signs of asthma in adolescents are no different from those of other age groups. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The  goals  of  chronic  asthma  management  may  be  divided  into  two  domains:  reduction  in  impairment  and 
reduction of risk. 
Complete control of asthma is defined as:  
•  no daytime symptoms  
•  no night-time awakening due to asthma  
•  no need for rescue medication  
•  no asthma attacks  
•  no limitations on activity including exercise  
•  normal lung function (in practical terms FEV1 and/or PEF>80% predicted or best)  
•  minimal side effects from medication. 
In clinical practice patients may have different goals and may wish to balance the aims of asthma management 
against the potential side effects or inconvenience of taking medication necessary to achieve perfect control. 
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 58/63 
  
  
Effective  asthma  management  requires  a  proactive,  preventative  approach,  similar  to  the  treatment  of 
hypertension  or  diabetes.  Routine  follow-up  visits  for  patients  with  active  asthma  are  recommended,  at  a 
frequency of every one to six months, depending upon the severity of asthma. These visits should be used to 
assess multiple aspects of the patient's asthma and to discuss steps that patients can take to intervene early in 
asthma exacerbations (an asthma "action plan"). The aspects of the patient's asthma that should be assessed at 
each  visit  include  the  following:  signs  and  symptoms,  pulmonary  function,  quality  of  life,  exacerbations, 
adherence with treatment, medication side effects, and patient satisfaction with care.  
Pharmacologic treatment is the mainstay of management in most patients with asthma. The stepwise approach 
to pharmacotherapy is based on increasing medications until asthma is controlled, and decreasing medications 
when possible to minimize side effects. Adjustment of the patient's management should be considered at every 
visit. 
The first step in determining appropriate therapy for patients who are not already on a controller medication is 
classifying the severity of the patient's asthma. For patients already taking one or more controller medications, 
treatment options are guided by an assessment of asthma control rather than asthma severity. 
Specific evidence about the pharmacological management of adolescents with asthma is limited and is usually 
extrapolated from paediatric and adult studies. 
Decreasing  therapy  once  asthma  is  controlled  is  recommended,  but  often  not  implemented  leaving  some 
patients over-treated. 
The purpose of this line extension related to a new formulation was to seek approval for the prefilled syringe and 
auto injector in order to improve administration of this medicinal product. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The MAH is submitting this application to obtain marketing approval for a new drug form of a prefilled pen or 
syringe (mepolizumab injection, liquid drug product) of mepolizumab.  The indications currently registered for 
the Nucala lyophilised drug product (mepolizumab for injection) remain. 
The main supportive data is obtained from the pharmacokinetic study which demonstrated bioequivalence of 
both new formulations to the already authorised powder for solution. Only limited efficacy data were provided as 
part of this application which is acceptable as it pertains to introduction of a new pharmaceutical form. 
The mepolizumab liquid drug product clinical development programme consisted of 3 studies which support this 
application:  1  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  comparability  study  in  healthy  volunteers  and  2  Real-World-Use  (RWU) 
studies in subjects with severe eosinophilic asthma. All 3 studies assessed the safety profile of the mepolizumab 
liquid drug product. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The PK of mepolizumab, administered subcutaneously as liquid drug product using either autoinjector or safety 
syringe,  was  shown  to  be  statistically  comparable  to  the  PK  of  the  commercially  available  lyophilized  drug 
product. 
The two real-world use studies demonstrated the usability of the auto-injector and safety syringe, including 
self-administration outside of the clinic, in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. 
Assessment report on extension(s) of marketing authorisation  
EMA/341490/2019 
Page 59/63 
  
  
The results of the two human factor studies can be taken to constitute sufficient validation that the Instructions 
For Use in the EU Package Leaflet are readable, comprehensible and usable by the target user population. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There  are  no  major  uncertainties.  Overall,  the  site  of  injection  (abdomen,  thigh  or  arm)  did  not  appear  to 
markedly influence mepolizumab PK, nor the effect of mepolizumab on blood eosinophils, irrespective of device 
used. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether there is no difference in the upper arm site of 
injection compared to the abdomen or thigh, since only 5 subjects in Study 204959 and 4 subjects in Study 
205667 using the upper arm as a site of injection. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In real-world use (RWU) studies a total of 71 subjects (36%), including 5/11 adolescents enrolled, reported 
on-treatment AEs, and 6 subjects (3%) reported events considered related to mepolizumab by the investigator. 
The types of common adverse events reported during the RWU Studies were similar to those reported in the 
pivotal studies. The most commonly (≥3%) reported on-treatment AEs in the RWU Studies were nasopharyngitis 
(5%), headache (4%), upper respiratory tract infection (4%), and urinary tract infection (3%). 
In the RWU Studies twelve on-treatment non-fatal SAEs were reported for 7 subjects however none of these 
SAEs were considered related to mepolizumab by the investigator. 
Asthma (verbatim text: asthma exacerbation) was the only SAE reported for >1 subject (including 1 adolescent 
subject). 
Six SAEs were reported for 1 subject due to a road traffic accident. None of the SAEs were considered related to 
mepolizumab by the investigator. 
In a single dose study in healthy subjects on-treatment AEs were reported in 34% of subjects (29%, 34%, and 
38% for the lyophilised drug product, liquid drug product in an autoinjector, and liquid drug product in a safety 
syringe, respectively). 
In the RWU Studies a positive ADA results were reported for a total of 7 subjects (4%) at Baseline and 4 subjects 
(2%) at the Week 12/EW Visit. No subject positive for ADAs tested positive for neutralising antibodies. 
In this study positive ADA results were reported for 11 subjects (5%) post-Baseline: 4%, 4%, and 6% for the 
lyophilised  drug  product,  liquid  drug  product  in  safety  syringe,  and  liquid  drug  product  in  autoinjector 
respectively. None of whom tested positive for neutralising antibodies. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The types of common adverse reactions reported during the RWU Studies (mepolizumab injection, liquid drug 
product) are similar to those reported in the pivotal studies. However as the safety data are limited with the new 
formulation no final conclusion can be made at present and this will be monitored in the post approval setting via 
routine pharmacovigilance. However no differences with the known safety profile of the existing pharmaceutical 
form would be expected. 
There was no direct comparison between the new liquid formulations tested the RWU Studies and lyophilised 
formulation therefor only indirect comparisons could be made. This is acceptable by the CHMP.

3.6.  Effects Table 
An effect table is not appropriate in view of the clinical data submitted in this application.  
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The PK of mepolizumab, administered subcutaneously as liquid drug product using either prefilled pen or 
prefilled syringe was shown to be statistically comparable to the PK of the commercially available lyophilized 
drug product. 
The two real-world use studies demonstrated the usability of both formulations, including self-administration 
outside of the clinic, in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. 
Based on the data available no major differences in relation to the safety profile between the approved 
lyophilised formulation and new liquid formulations formation were noted.  The types of Treatment Emergent 
Adverse Events reported were similar to those reported in the pivotal studies.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The balance of the benefit and risks is positive for this new pharmaceutical form. The liquid formulation will add 
a new option in comparison with the powder for injection currently available.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  NA.Conclusions 
The overall Benefit/Risk of Nucala solution for injection in pre-filled pen and syringe is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Nucala new pharmaceutical form is favourable in the following indication: 
Nucala is indicated as an add-on treatment for severe refractory eosinophilic asthma in adults, adolescents and 
children aged 6 years and older (see section 5.1). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Nucala subject to the 
following conditions:

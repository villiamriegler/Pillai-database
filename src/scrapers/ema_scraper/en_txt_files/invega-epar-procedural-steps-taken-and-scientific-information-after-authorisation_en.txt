paliperidone and risperidone with psychostimulants 
(in line with the CMDh recommendations for 
risperidone) and of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add 
catatonia as a new side-effect categorised as ‘Rare’. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. The MAH 
took also the occasion to include editorial changes in 
the PI and to update the local representative for 
Ireland in the Package leaflet for Trevicta, Invega

Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to add a 
new post-marketing adverse drug reaction of 
‘intraoperative floppy iris syndrome’ (IFIS) and a 
related warning for risperidone and paliperidone 
containing medicinal products. Sections 2 and 4 of

C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
including the scientific literature revealed six case reports, 
including two with a timely relationship, of IFIS, a 
syndrome of eye problems during cataract surgery, in 
patients taking risperidone. While no reports were received 
for paliperidone, there is a biological plausibility that IFIS 
can occur also in paliperidone treated patients, as 
paliperidone is a derivative of risperidone and since both 
agents bind and block α1 adrenergic receptors, a known 
mechanism for this adverse drug reaction. Therefore, the 
CHMP agreed to add IFIS as an adverse drug reaction and 
to include a related warning in the product information of

follows: 
SmpC: Neonates exposed to antipsychotics (including 
paliperidone) during the third trimester of pregnancy are at 
risk of adverse reactions including extrapyramidal and/or 
withdrawal symptoms that may vary in severity and 
duration following delivery. There have been reports of 
agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, 
respiratory distress, or feeding disorder. 
PL: The following symptoms may occur in newborn babies, 
of mothers that have used paliperidone in the last trimester 
(last three months of their pregnancy): shaking, muscle 
stiffness and/or weakness, sleepiness, agitation, breathing 
problems, and difficulty in feeding. If your baby develops

recommended that Torsade de Pointes should be 
mentioned in section 4.9 of the SPC in the list of 
pharmacologically expected reactions of overdose 
(following one reported case) and that the section 4.8 is 
reformatted according to the SPC guideline. In line with 
these recommendations, the MAH updated section 4.9 to 
include that torsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation 
have been reported in association with overdose. Section 
4.8 was reformatted to reflect the ADRs into one single 
table and a statement ("Paliperidone is the active 
metabolite of risperidone. The safety profile of risperidone 
may be pertinent") was added to highlight the link between 
paliperidone and risperidone.

The Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) considered 
Product Characteristics (SPC) in relation to a class-
labelling on risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
associated with antipsychotics at the CHMP request. 
Relevant sections of the Package Leaflet (PL) were 
amended accordingly.

a national review from a Member State on spontaneous 
reporting data and world-wide published literature on 
antipsychotics and the risk of venous thromboembolic 
events (VTE). Despite the limitations of both sources of 
information (data from literature is limited by the lack of 
randomised controlled trial data and the heterogeneity of 
completed published studies; post marketing data is limited 
by potential confounding factors such as sedation and 
weight gain which are commonly present in antipsychotic

users), the PhVWP concluded that an association between 
VTE and antipsychotics cannot be excluded. The PhVWP 
concluded that it was not possible to distinguish risk 
between different drugs and therefore there was no 
justification for warnings for VTE just for a few drugs. 
Following the PhVWP conclusions, the CHMP recommended 
the inclusion of the proposed PhVWP class labelling into the 
Invega SPC/PL. The class effects section  was updated to 
add venous thromboembolism including cases of  
pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (frequency 
unknown) and the following new warning was included in 
the SPC: 
- 
Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have 
been reported with antipsychotic drugs. Since patients 
treated with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk 
factors for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be 
identified before and during treatment with INVEGA and 
preventive measures undertaken.

priapism were reported in the clinical trials with 
paliperidone. However, cumulatively, 4 cases of priapism 
have been reported during postmarketing surveillance, 
including one case suggestive of a drug-event relationship 
in a patient who previously experienced priapism with 
risperidone. On this basis, the CHMP considered it 
acceptable to reflect the information on priapism into the 
SPC and PL of paliperidone including a warning that 
patients should be informed to seek urgent medical care in 
case that priapism has not been resolved within 3-4 hours.

Administration) for the currently approved strengths of 
INVEGA (3, 6, 9 and 12 mg) was updated with information 
regarding the dosing recommendations in patients with 
renal impairment and a new recommendation for dose 
titration. The variation is in accordance with a line 
extension for INVEGA (EMEA/H/C/746/X/03) to include an 
additional dosage strength of 1.5 mg, in order to meet the 
needs for dose adjustment in patients with renal 
impairment. 
The amendments include an upper limit dose of 6 mg once 
daily for patients with mild renal impairment and an update 
to the dosage recommendation for patients with moderate 
to severe renal impairment (from a creatinine clearance of 
10 ml/min) to 1.5 mg (new strength) every day instead of 
3 mg every other day. The PL was updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, details of the local representatives in Malta 
and Estonia have also been updated in the PL.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of the interaction study between 
Characteristics (SPC) to reflect the results of a drug 
Labelling and 
paliperidone and carbamazepine, the SPC was amended to 
interaction study (R076477-BIM-1001) between 
paliperidone and carbamazepine. Editorial changes 
were made in sections 4.3 and 5.2 of the SPC and in 
the labelling. The details for some of the local 
representatives were also updated in the Package 
Leaflet.

include the following: 
- Co-administration of INVEGA once daily with 
carbamazepine 200 mg twice daily caused a decrease of 
approximately 37% in the mean steady-state Cmax and 
AUC of paliperidone; this decrease is caused, to a 
substantial degree, by a 35% increase in renal clearance of 
paliperidone likely as a result of induction of renal P-gp by 
carbamazepine.  
- A minor decrease in the amount of drug excreted 
unchanged in the urine suggested that there was little 
effect on the CYP metabolism or bioavailability of 
paliperidone during carbamazepine co-administration.  
- Larger decreases in plasma concentrations of paliperidone 
could occur with higher doses of carbamazepine.  
- On initiation of carbamazepine, the dose of INVEGA 
should be re-evaluated and increased if necessary. 
Conversely, on discontinuation of carbamazepine, the dose 
of INVEGA should be re-evaluated and decreased if 
necessary. 
- It takes 2-3 weeks for full induction to be achieved and 
upon discontinuation of the inducer the effect wears off 
over a similar time period.

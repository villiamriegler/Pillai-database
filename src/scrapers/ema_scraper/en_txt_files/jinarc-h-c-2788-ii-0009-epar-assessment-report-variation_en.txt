Tolvaptan is a vasopressin receptor antagonist and was approved in 2015 for the orphan indication: 
treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Of note, tolvaptan tablets 15 and 
30 mg also have a separate MA under a different brand name (Samsca, EU/1/09/539/001-004) 
authorised on 3 August 2009 for the treatment of adult patients with hyponatraemia secondary to 
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. 
The pivotal trial in ADPKD [TEMPO 3:4] was a 3 year randomised, placebo controlled trial comparing long-
term safety and efficacy of oral split dose tolvaptan regimens (titrated between 60 mg/day and 120 
Assessment report  
EMA/508732/2018 
Page 4/34 
 
  
  
 
 
mg/day) to placebo, in 1445 adults with ADPKD.  The primary objective was to evaluate the long-term 
efficacy using change in total kidney volume (TKV). The rate of TKV increase over 3 years was 
significantly less for tolvaptan-treated subjects than for subjects receiving placebo: 2.80% per year vs 
5.51% per year, respectively.  The key secondary composite endpoint (ADPKD progression) was time to 
multiple clinical progression events of:  
•  worsening kidney function - defined as a persistent [reproduced over at least 2 weeks] 25% 
reduction in reciprocal serum creatinine during treatment [from end of titration to last on-drug 
visit] 
•  medically significant kidney pain - defined as requiring prescribed leave, last-resort analgesics, 
narcotic and anti-nociceptive, radiologic or surgical interventions 
•  worsening hypertension  
•  worsening albuminuria. 
The relative rate of ADPKD-related events was decreased by 13.5% in tolvaptan-treated patients, (HR, 
0.87; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.97; p=0.0095). The result of the key secondary composite endpoint was 
primarily attributed to effects on worsening kidney function and medically significant kidney pain. The 
renal function events were 61.4% less likely for tolvaptan compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.39; 
95% CI, 0.26 to 0.57; nominal p=0.007). In contrast, there was no effect of tolvaptan on either 
progression of hypertension or albuminuria. The efficacy assessment and extrapolation to long term 
outcomes was largely based on the surrogate parameter TKV.  Furthermore, the study population in the 
pivotal trial had a relatively large renal volume consistent with rapid cystic growth, but at least 50% 
preservation of renal function.  
Patients with early, but rapidly progressive disease, were hoped to benefit from therapy and to have a 
prognosis for observable changes or outcomes during a 3-year trial. More extensive long term data and 
data on patients in later stages of the disease were therefore needed to confirm efficacy assumption 
based on hard clinical outcomes. This was reflected in two post-authorisation efficacy studies at the time 
of Jinarc’s approval. 
The first was study 156-08-271 [TEMPO 4:4], which was assessed in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002788/II/0006. This 2 year open-label extension to the pivotal trial [total of 5 years] showed 
tolvaptan continued to have an effect on the rate of  renal function decline over several more years.  
Longer term data are not currently available to show whether long-term therapy with tolvaptan continues 
to slow the rate of renal function decline and affect clinical outcomes of ADPKD, including delay in the 
onset of end-stage renal disease. 
The second post-marketing commitment aimed to further define the efficacy of tolvaptan in patients with 
more advanced renal dysfunction, on a primary endpoint related to estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) rather than TKV.  The company was required to submit the final report of study 156-13-210 by 
February 2018. This is the subject of the current variation assessment.  The results have been published 
[Torres et al, N Engl J Med 2017; 377:1930-1942, REPRISE study].

2.4.1.  Main study 
Title of Study 
Clinical trial 156-13-210: Phase 3b, Multi-centre, Randomized-withdrawal, Placebo-controlled, Double-
blind, Parallel-group Trial to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Tolvaptan (45 to 120 mg/day, Split-dose) 
in Subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease Between Late Stage 2 to Early Stage 4 Due to Autosomal 
Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease. 
Methods 
The design and objectives of study 156-13-21- were noted already during the initial MAA for Jinarc. The 
study was a Phase 3b, multi-centre, randomized-withdrawal, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-
group trial to compare the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan (45 to 120 mg/day, Split-dose) in subjects 
with chronic kidney disease between late stage 2 to early stage 4 due to ADPKD. The trial employed a 
pre-randomization phase comprising placebo run-in, tolvaptan treatment titration, and tolvaptan run-in 
periods. The titration and run-in periods were designed to test tolerability, exclude subjects unlikely to 
tolerate tolvaptan’s aquaretic effects prior to the randomization period, minimize post-randomization 
withdrawal, and enrich the trial population with patients who might benefit from long-term treatment. 
The placebo run-in period was used to establish a pre-randomization baseline of eGFR for each treatment 
assignment and facilitate straightforward calculation of eGFR slope for all subjects, the key secondary 
endpoint. After randomisation there was a 1 year double-blind treatment phase, with subjects then

eligible for an open-label extension phase. Tolvaptan, or matching placebo, was administered at 60/30 or 
90/30 mg, as split doses, with down-titrations to 45/15 and 30/15 mg as needed for tolerability

Objectives 
This trial was conducted to extend the understanding of the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan treatment in 
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) subjects with late Stage 2 to early Stage 4 
chronic kidney disease (CKD). Focusing on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by 
the CKD-Epidemiology (CKD EPI) formula (hereafter referred to as “eGFR”), this trial was expected to 
Assessment report  
EMA/508732/2018 
Page 7/34 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
provide kidney function data that were complementary to the data demonstrating the benefits previously 
observed primarily in ADPKD subjects with earlier stages of disease. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective was the treatment difference in the change of eGFR, as calculated using Chronic 
Kidney Disease-Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) formula, from pre-treatment baseline to post-treatment follow-
up, divided by each subject’s trial duration. The pre and post treatment eGFR results were each 
calculated from the mean of 3 serum creatinine measurements. The secondary efficacy endpoint was the 
treatment difference in annualized slope of eGFR calculated for individual subjects using eGFR data 
observed in the placebo run-in, tolvaptan run-in (not including tolvaptan titration), double-blind 
treatment, and post-treatment follow-up (not including data collected in the first week after the last IMP 
dose) periods. 
Sample size 
Based on a Mixed Model Repeated Measurements analysis of the non-Japanese CKD stage 3 subjects 
from trial 156-04-251, the treatment difference in renal function at Month 12 was 1.07. Expected intra-
subject variance was 14.2 and inter-subject variance 28.05 at Month 12. With 3 repeated measures at 
pre-treatment baseline and post-treatment follow-up, respectively, the power calculation estimated that, 
for a 2-sided alpha set at 0.05 for a power of 90%, and with an assumption of 10% dropout rate in the 
trial, a total sample size of approximately 1300 subjects was needed.  
Randomisation 
Randomization was 1:1, tolvaptan to placebo, and utilised an interactive voice response system to ensure 
appropriate stratification. Subjects were be stratified by their baseline eGFR at a threshold of ≤  45 or > 
45 mL/min/1.73m2 and by age (≤ 55 or > 55 years old). Subjects were also stratified by three TKV 
criteria (≤ 2000 mL, > 2000 mL, or unknown). 
Blinding (masking) 
Placebo was administered in a form identical to the corresponding dose of tolvaptan tablets.  Following 
the screening period, there followed a placebo run-in period (1 week), a tolvaptan titration period (2 
weeks), and a tolvaptan run-in period (3 weeks). Subjects were aware they would receive placebo or 
active treatment during the treatment phase, but they would not know which. The subjects were not told 
that there was a separate run-in phase and randomization phase, and were not told when formal 
randomization would occur.   
Statistical methods 
The end points of the trial were ordered hierarchically and tested sequentially with gatekeeping 
procedures; if the primary end point was found to be significant, analysis of the secondary end point 
would be justified. A modified intention-to-treat population or full analysis set was used for the analysis of 
the primary end point. All patients with any data to inform the primary or secondary end points or safety 
were included in the modified intention-to-treat and safety populations. The primary end point was 
analysed by means of a weighted analysis of covariance with trial group and randomization stratification 
factors as factor and baseline covariates.  The key secondary end point was also assessed in the modified 
Assessment report

intention-to-treat population and was analysed with the use of a linear mixed-effect model with effects of 
time (as a continuous variable), trial group, interaction of time and trial group, acute hemodynamic 
effect, stratification factors at randomization, and baseline covariate (of the primary end point) to fit the 
estimated GFR data. This trial’s estimand was the difference in outcome improvement if all subjects 
tolerated and adhered to their treatment.   Data missing at random (MAR) was assumed in the primary 
analysis. A sensitivity analysis was provided to address the concern of data missing not at random 
(MNAR).

Recruitment 
A total of 2292 subjects were screened. After 2 weeks of screening, 1519 subjects entered the 6-week 
single-blind pre-randomization phase, and subsequently 1370 subjects were randomized and treated 
during the 12-month double-blind period. Subjects who were randomized, took IMP up to Month 12 (-
7/+2 days), and completed some or all of their required trial visits/assessments to the end of the trial 
(including the Month 12 visit and at least 1 follow-up serum creatinine assessment) were defined as “On-
treatment completers.”  
Subjects who needed to discontinue treatment prior to Day 358 (or never began treatment), and 
completed some or all of their required trial visits/assessments to the end of the trial (including the Month 
12 visit and at least 1 follow-up serum creatinine assessment) were defined as “Off-treatment 
completers.” Subjects who were randomized, took IMP (or never began treatment), but did not complete 
the Month 12 visit and at least 1 end-of-treatment follow-up serum creatinine assessment were defined 
as “Non-completers.” The percentage of on-treatment completers (i.e., randomized subjects who received 
IMP up to Month 12 and completed some or all of their required trial assessments to the end of the trial, 
including the Month 12 visit and ≥ 1 follow-up serum creatinine assessment) was 84.6% in the tolvaptan 
arm and 92.7% in the placebo arm. The percentage of “off-treatment completers” (i.e., randomized 
subjects who took IMP, but discontinued treatment prior to Day 358 or never began treatment, and 
completed some or all assessments to the end of the trial, including the Month 12 visit and ≥ 1 follow-up 
serum creatinine assessment) was 11.1% in the tolvaptan arm and 3.2% in the placebo arm. Based on 
these data, 96% of patients in both groups were considered to complete the study; approximately 4% in 
each treatment group were non-completers.  
The difference between groups in time to discontinuation from the IMP was statistically significant (p < 
0.0001). Among the 6.3% of subjects who chose to discontinue the IMP prior to Month 12, the reason 
was most frequently that the IMP was not tolerable (8.3% in the tolvaptan group; 0.9% in the placebo 
group). For the 4.5% of subjects for whom the physician decided to withdraw IMP treatment, the reason 
was most frequently due to hepatic AEs (3.7% in the tolvaptan arm; 0.6% in the placebo arm). In both 
treatment arms, the percent of subjects lost to follow-up was low (0.1% in the tolvaptan arm; 0.6% in 
the placebo arm). 
Conduct of the study 
Note that the country-specific amendment for France added the following as an exclusion criterion: 
Tolvaptan is contraindicated in patients who are known to have hypersensitivity to tolvaptan or 1 of the 
excipients, are hypovolemic (volume depletion), and cannot perceive thirst. Additionally, subjects with 
baseline screening abnormalities of serum sodium concentrations (hyponatremia or hypernatremia) could 
not be enrolled in the trial until these abnormalities resolved, and then the subjects were required to be 
monitored accordingly. 
Baseline data 
Baseline demographics and CKD characteristics are shown in the table below, for the randomised 
population.  Subjects were most frequently in CKD Stage 3b (45.1%), followed by Stage 3a (30.0%), 
Stage 4 (19.5%), and Stage 2 (5.2%). The majority of subjects (64.2%) had eGFR (CKD-EPI) ≤ 45 
mL/min/1.73 m2 . For most subjects (80.4%) the TKV was not known.

Numbers analysed 
A total of 2292 subjects were screened. After 2 weeks of screening, 1519 subjects entered the 6-week 
single-blind pre-randomization phase, and subsequently 1370 subjects were randomized and treated 
during the 12-month double-blind period. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the treatment difference in the change of eGFR from pre-treatment 
baseline to post-treatment follow-up, annualized (divided) by each subject’s trial duration. The primary 
endpoint results demonstrate a statistically significant difference (p < 0.0001) in favour of tolvaptan of 
1.271 mL/min/1.73 m2 /year (95% CI 0.859 to 1.684).  
The LS mean change in eGFR was −2.339 mL/min/1.73 m2 /year for tolvaptan vs. −3.610 mL/min/1.73 
m2 /year for placebo, which corresponds to a difference of ~ 35%

treatment Follow-up (mL/min/1.73 m2 /year) - Primary Endpoint, Efficacy Population 
Figure 3 shows the changes in GFR over the 1 year study duration.  As in previous data, there is an initial 
drop in GFR, presumed to be a haemodynamic effect of the drug, which reverses on drug cessation.

The primary endpoint results according to key subgroups are shown in figure 5 below. The subgroup 
analysis of the primary endpoints by CKD stage (table 3) demonstrated significant treatment effects for 
subjects in Stages 3a, 3b, and 4 at baseline – however the result was driven by benefits in those with

stage 3a disease. Patients who were non-white, aged over 55y or with stage 2 CKD at baseline did not 
seem to benefit from tolvaptan, although there were small numbers of patients in these subgroups.

A pre-specified subgroup analysis suggested that tolvaptan had less of an effect in patients older than 55 
years of age, which correlated with a slower rate of decline of CKD in this subgroup. 
Secondary endpoints 
The key secondary endpoint was the linear mixed effect model of annualized eGFR change slope. This 
showed a statistically significant difference of 1.011 mL/min/1.73 m2 /year (p < 0.0001) in favour of 
tolvaptan.  The subgroup analysis of the secondary endpoints by CKD stage demonstrated significant 
treatment effects for subjects in Stages 3a, 3b, and 4 at baseline. The exploratory ANCOVA of the 
primary endpoint by modal dose showed statistically significant dose-response analysis of modal doses of 
60, 90, and 120 mg (with 30 and 45 mg doses pooled to 60 mg due to sample sizes of 1 and 6 
respectively) (p = 0.0225 for the dose trend). 
Ancillary analyses 
Not applicable. 
Summary of main study 
For Trial 156-13-210, statistical significance for both the primary and key secondary endpoints were met 
at p < 0.05 (p < 0.0001), which provides confirmatory evidence for the efficacy of tolvaptan in slowing 
renal function decline and extends the understanding of the effects of tolvaptan to later stages of the 
disease. All pre-specified sensitivity analyses were also positive (all p < 0.0001, except 1 with p = 
0.0005). Missing data sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robust treatment effect of tolvaptan in 
slowing eGFR decline against the data MNAR assumption. Subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint 
demonstrated consistent treatment effects of tolvaptan for subjects in CKD Stages 2, 3a, 3b, and 4, with 
the latter 3 subgroups showing p-values ≤ 0.02. Similar results were observed for the key secondary 
endpoint. For both endpoints, significant treatment effects in favour of tolvaptan were observed across 
most other subgroup categories; for some subgroup categories (e.g., CKD Stage 2), the non-significant 
results may be partially attributable to low subject numbers. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The key differences from the previous pivotal trial are the enrolment of subjects with later stages of CKD, 
and the use of GFR as primary endpoint rather than total kidney volume. For comparison, in the pivotal 
study the mean pre-titration eGFR was around 80. There are no significant issues with the overall design, 
conduct and analysis of the trial. The key endpoints have been discussed in previous Jinarc assessments.   
Overall, characteristics of patients at baseline were balanced between the two groups. Most patients 
assigned to the tolvaptan group, and who completed the trial, were taking 90 mg morning and 30 mg 
afternoon doses daily. 
Statistical significance for both the primary and key secondary endpoints were met, according to the 
applicant’s pre-specified analyses.  In the primary endpoint, the LS mean change in eGFR was −2.339 
mL/min/1.73 m2 /year for tolvaptan vs. −3.610 mL/min/1.73 m2 /year for placebo, which corresponds to 
Assessment report

Page 16/34 
 
  
  
 
 
a decline of ~ 35%. This corresponds to a treatment effect of 1.271 mL/min/1.73 m2 /year (95% CI 
0.859 to 1.684, p < 0.0001).  This is very similar to the effect size in the pivotal trial.  
To put the eGFR results into context, rapid progression of renal impairment is generally defined in CKD as 
a sustained decline in eGFR of more than 5 ml/min/1.73 m2/year. Once eGFR decreases below 30 
mL/min, there is a progressive impact of complications related to renal impairment. Although primarily 
dependent on symptoms, the need for renal replacement therapy often occurs in a GFR range between 5 
and 10 ml/min/1.73 m2. 
In the trial, the baseline estimated GFR was 41.1 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 and declined over a 1-year 
period by 4.17 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 with placebo. The authors note that if this effect were 
maintained, the time to chronic kidney disease of stage 5 would be extended from 6.2 years to 9.0 years. 
Such a delay could buy time for pre-emptive transplant. A larger benefit might be expected if treatment 
were started earlier, but this assumes that patients would tolerate long-term tolvaptan.   
The key secondary endpoint was the linear mixed effect model of annualized eGFR change slope. This 
showed a statistically significant difference of 1.011 mL/min/1.73 m2 /year (p < 0.0001) in favour of 
tolvaptan.  This endpoint requires modelling assumptions to adjust for the estimated hemodynamic 
effects of tolvaptan.  
To minimize withdrawal resulting from adverse drug effects, only patients who had an acceptable burden 
of side effects from tolvaptan during a pre-randomization period that included sequential placebo and 
tolvaptan phases underwent randomization. Therefore these results are specifically for a subset of 
patients who could take the treatment without an unacceptable level of side effects. Despite selection 
based upon ability to tolerate the drug, the trial still had a 9.5% dropout rate for tolvaptan, and this 
would be higher in unselected patients. Several approaches were used to account for the impact of 
missing data. Although the applicant provided sensitivity analyses of the key endpoints giving results that 
are in line with primary analyses, the sensitivity analysis do not address a treatment policy estimand and 
these were requested. However, since the primary results are highly statistically significant, the statistical 
conclusions of the trial are unlikely to alter. The requested analysis generates very similar results to those 
seen in the original primary analysis, demonstrating the robustness of the trial results to the method of 
handling missing data. 
The subgroup analysis of the primary endpoints by CKD stage demonstrated significant treatment effects 
for subjects in Stages 3a, 3b, and 4 at baseline.  There were 262 patients in the efficacy population with 
severe CKD (stage 4, eGFR 15- mL/min/1.73 m2) at baseline – in this subgroup- the  LS mean change in 
eGFR was −3.797 mL/min/1.73 m2 /year for tolvaptan vs. −4.602 mL/min/1.73 m2 /year for placebo. 
Patients over 55 were required to have an estimated GFR of 25 to 44 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 and 
historical evidence of a decline in the estimated GFR that exceeded 2.0 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 per 
year.  This presumably followed recommendations of the European Renal Association/European Dialysis 
and Transplant association, which argue against treating patients aged >50 years who still have an eGFR 
>45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (CKD stages 1–3a), because these patients have a high probability of slowly 
progressive disease.  Despite the more stringent entry criteria for older patients, tolvaptan had less of an 
effect in patients older than 55 years of age, which correlated with a slower rate of decline of CKD in this 
subgroup.  
The overall risks versus benefits will need to be carefully considered before starting tolvaptan in patients 
with late-stage ADPKD. In particular, the speed of ADPKD progression should be weighed against the risk 
of intolerability and of compliance with monitoring aimed at reducing the risk of hepatic adverse events. 
However, in selected patients with stage 4 CKD, treatment with tolvaptan would seem to have benefit. 
The current SmPC already restricts the indication to rapidly progressing disease, and notes that treatment 
must be initiated and monitored under the supervision of physicians with expertise in managing ADPKD

and a full understanding of the risks of tolvaptan therapy, including hepatic toxicity and monitoring 
requirements.  
This was a 1 year study, and further the effectiveness of treatment with tolvaptan over the long term 
remains to be determined. There remains no clinical rationale for the use of tolvaptan in ADPKD patients 
with end-stage renal failure, and the SmPC states that the treatment should be discontinued if the stage 
of renal insufficiency progresses to CKD stage 5. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The key differences between the previous pivotal trial and the current one are the enrolment of subjects 
with later stages of CKD, and the use of GFR as primary endpoint rather than total kidney volume. 
Statistical significance for both the primary and key secondary endpoints was met, according to the 
applicant’s pre-specified analyses. The LS mean change in eGFR was very similar to the effect size in the 
pivotal trial, and would be considered clinically relevant.   
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The pharmacodynamically predictable and most commonly reported adverse reactions are thirst, polyuria, 
nocturia, and pollakiuria (frequent urination) – with the resulting risk of fluid and electrolyte 
abnormalities. An increase in serum uric acid is also well documented, and a small reversible reduction in 
GFR has been observed in ADPKD trials at the initiation of tolvaptan treatment. Furthermore, tolvaptan 
has been associated with idiosyncratic elevations of blood alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT 
and AST) with infrequent cases of concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. 
In the pivotal ADPKD trial, elevation (> 3 × upper limit of normal [ULN]) of ALT was observed in 4.4 % 
(42/958) of patients on tolvaptan and 1.0 % (5/484) of patients on placebo, while elevation (> 3 × ULN) 
of AST was observed in 3.1 % (30/958) of patients on tolvaptan and 0.8 % (4/484) patients on placebo. 
Two (2/957, 0.2 %) of these tolvaptan treated-patients, as well as a third patient from an extension open 
label trial, exhibited increases in hepatic enzymes (> 3 × ULN) with concomitant elevations in BT (> 2 × 
ULN). The period of onset of hepatocellular injury (by ALT elevations > 3 × ULN) was within 3 to 14 
months after initiating treatment and these increases were reversible, with ALT returning to < 3 × ULN 
within 1 to 4 month.  In the pivotal trial, the incidence of elevated transaminase levels for tolvaptan 
subjects (> 3 × ULN) was approximately 3 to 4-fold higher than for placebo subjects. No association with 
tolvaptan dose or exposure was found at MAA for hepatic events. 
In post-marketing experience, anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock and rash generalised) has been 
reported very rarely following administration of tolvaptan. 
Patient exposure 
Cumulative exposure is shown in table 4 below. Through Month 12 inclusive, the cumulative percentage 
of subjects continuing on IMP, decreased to 84.5% and 92.6% for the tolvaptan and placebo arms, 
respectively. At Month 12, the average daily dose was 108.2 mg and 111.8 mg for the tolvaptan and 
placebo arms, respectively.

Adverse events 
For the single, blind, tolvaptan run-in period, any AE reported after a subject had received the first dose 
of tolvaptan was considered a TEAE. During this period, of the 1491 subjects treated, 1051 (70.5%) 
subjects experienced a TEAE – the most frequently reported TEAEs were polyuria (31.9%), thirst 
(28.8%), and nocturia (20.7%). One subject died; serious TEAEs were reported for 43 (2.9%) subjects. 
Discontinuations of IMP due to an AE were reported for 101 (6.8%) subjects. 
During the double-blind treatment period, TEAEs were reported for 85.3% and 82.3% of subjects in the 
tolvaptan and placebo groups, respectively.  The most frequently occurring TEAEs (tolvaptan vs. placebo) 
were renal pain (16.6% vs. 19.0%), hypertension (10.7% vs. 11.5%), viral upper respiratory tract 
infection (10.6% vs. 12.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (8.7% vs. 8.5%), diarrhoea (6.9% vs. 
3.4%), fatigue (6.8% vs. 3.5%), polyuria (5.3% vs. 1.6%); urinary tract infection (5.7% vs. 8.0%), and 
peripheral oedema (4.4% vs. 6.6%). 
Overall, 1 subject died (placebo group); 12.5% and 8.8% of subjects in the tolvaptan and placebo 
groups, respectively, experienced serious TEAEs; and 9.5% and 2.2% of subjects in the tolvaptan and 
placebo groups, respectively, experienced IMP discontinuation due to AEs. An overview of AEs is given in 
table 5 below.

Table 5: Overview of Adverse Events (All Causalities), Primary and Secondary Safety Populations, Single- 
and Double-blind Treatment Periods 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths in the study considered to be related to IMP. One subject died from a Pulmonary 
Embolism during the tolvaptan titration and run-in period and another subject died from a Road Traffic 
Accident during the double-blind treatment period (assigned to placebo) 
During the single-blind treatment period, 43 (2.9%) subjects experienced ≥ 1 serious TEAE. The majority 
of the serious TEAEs were reported by 1 subject. The most frequently reported serious TEAEs in 
descending order were alanine aminotransferase increased (4 subjects, 0.3%), polyuria (4 subjects, 
0.3%), and nocturia (3 subjects, 0.2%). The majority of these serious TEAEs were assessed as severe in 
intensity.  
During the double-blind treatment period, serious TEAEs were reported for 85 (12.5%) subjects in the 
tolvaptan group vs. 60 (8.8%) subjects in the placebo group. The most frequently reported serious TEAEs 
were (in descending overall order, tolvaptan vs. placebo): hepatic enzyme increased (1.6% vs. 0.1%), 
alanine aminotransferase increased (1.2% vs. 0.0%), liver function test increased (0.6% vs. 0.3%), renal 
cyst haemorrhage (0.4% vs. 0.3%), and renal impairment (0.3% vs. 0.4%). The majority of the serious 
TEAEs were reported for 1 or 2 subjects overall (0.1% overall). Most serious TEAEs were considered to be 
severe in intensity.

Adverse events of particular interest 
Hepatic toxicity: Treatment emergent AEs related to liver injury in the double-blind treatment period were 
reported for 10.9% and 5.3% of subjects in the tolvaptan and placebo groups, respectively. The most 
frequently reported were increased alanine aminotransferase (3.7% vs. 1.3%), increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (2.2% vs. 1.6%), increased hepatic enzymes (2.5% vs. 0.4%), and increased 
transaminases (1.5% vs. 0.7%). Serious TEAEs were reported for 31 (4.6%) and 4 (0.6%) subjects in 
the tolvaptan group and placebo groups, respectively. The most frequently reported TEAEs overall were 
(tolvaptan vs. placebo): 11 subjects with hepatic enzyme increased (1.6% vs. 0.1%) and 8 subjects with 
alanine aminotransferase increased (1.2% vs. 0.0%). However, no subject during the trial had concurrent 
transaminase and bilirubin elevations that met Hy’s Law laboratory criteria (i.e., no subject had peak 
transaminase > 3 x ULN plus peak bilirubin > 2 x ULN). 
For the 29 subjects in the tolvaptan group who discontinued the IMP after reporting a potential clinically 
significant increased ALT (> 3 x ULN), the values returned toward normal after the IMP was discontinued.  
For the 9 subjects in the tolvaptan group who did not discontinue the IMP after reporting a potential 
clinically significant increased ALT (> 3 x ULN), the ALT values returned toward normal for all except for 1 
subject - that subject had 4 serious TEAEs of liver function test increased, the last of which resulted in 
discontinuation of the IMP; the subject recovered from all 4 serious TEAEs. 
It is noted that monthly monitoring of LFTs was done in this study, more frequent that the majority of 
patients in the previous pivotal study.  However the frequency is in line with the current SmPC, which 
requires  monitoring of liver function tests on a monthly basis during the first 18 months of treatment and 
3 monthly thereafter. 
Hyperuricaemia: There were 7 TEAE of increased blood uric acid in the tolvaptan group (1%) in the 
double-blind treatment period, compared to no cases in the placebo group.  The corresponding figures for 
the AE of gout were 12 (1.8%) vs 5 (0.7%). 
Skin neoplasm: A possible signal of skin neoplasm was noted at the time of initial MAA. In study 156-13-
210, tolvaptan conversely had a smaller incidence in skin neoplasm compared with placebo, although 
numbers were small.    
Glaucoma: A possible signal of glaucoma was noted at the time of initial MAA. There were no observed 
cases of with glaucoma in study 156-13-210. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The titration and run-in periods in the clinical trial were designed to test tolerability, exclude subjects 
unlikely to tolerate tolvaptan’s aquaretic effects prior to the randomization period, minimize post-
randomization withdrawal.  The adverse event profile is being reviewed with this in mind.   
Generally, the reported adverse events were in line with those established in the pivotal trial and there 
are no new signals of concern. In the pivotal trial, the most notable safety issue associated with chronic 
tolvaptan use in ADPKD was the potential for idiosyncratic hepatic toxicity. At the time of granting the 
initial marketing authorisation, the risk was considered manageable in the context of the RMP and SmPC 
restrictions (including contra-indications, monitoring and stopping rules). 
In the currently submitted trial 156-13-210, TEAEs related to liver injury in the double-blind treatment 
period were reported for 10.9% and 5.3% of subjects in the tolvaptan and placebo groups, respectively. 
However, no subject during the trial had concurrent transaminase and bilirubin elevations that met Hy’s 
Law laboratory criteria (i.e., no subject had peak transaminase > 3 x ULN plus peak bilirubin > 2 x ULN) 
Assessment report  
EMA/508732/2018 
Page 21/34 
 
  
  
and all cases were reversible.  One caveat is that the currently estimated “window of susceptibility” for 
hepatic AEs was estimated at around 18 months, whilst the submitted trial ran for 1 year.  
It is noted that monthly monitoring of LFTs was performed in this study, more frequent that the majority 
of patients in the previous pivotal study.  However the frequency is in line with the current SmPC 
recommendations, which requires monitoring of liver function tests on a monthly basis during the first 18 
months of treatment and 3 monthly thereafter. 
It is known that at the initiation of tolvaptan therapy, there is a small and reversible reduction in GFR, the 
mechanism for this is not fully defined. Data at the time of initial MAA suggested that the absolute 
decrease was lower in patients with more severe renal impairment, although the numbers of such 
patients are limited. Even if the decline is small, in patients with more severe renal impairment it can 
become more significant as a percentage of residual renal function. The CHMP requested further data on 
the initial change in GFR when starting therapy with tolvaptan overall and analysed by baseline CKD 
stage.  The applicant explained that in the pivotal AKPD trials, a reversible haemodynamic reduction in 
GFR was observed at the initiation of tolvaptan treatment, and this is also stated in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC.  In these new data, a similar effect was seen.  There is a trend for a lower initial decrease with 
worsening baseline renal function and this was also seen in the pivotal AKPD trials.  A greater effect was 
seen in some individuals, but, there were no subjects in CKD Stages 3a, 3b, and 4 that crossed their CKD 
stage boundary due to the initial change in eGFR, and this initial drop in eGFR recovered once a subject 
stopped taking tolvaptan. 
There was a small difference in the TEAE of abdominal pain versus placebo and this is reflected in the 
SmPC.   
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Generally, the reported adverse events were in line with those established in the pivotal trial and there 
are no new signals of concern.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 13.3 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu.

of tolvaptan. In a double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial of patients with ADPKD, 
potentially clinically significant increased 
uric acid (greater than 10 mg/dL) was 
reported at a higher rate in tolvaptan-
patients (6.2%) compared to placebo-
treated patients (1.7%). Adverse 
reactions of gout were reported more 
frequently in tolvaptan-treated patients 
(28/961, 2.9%) than in patients receiving 
placebo (7/483, 1.4%). In addition, 
increased use of allopurinol and other 
drugs used to manage gout were 
observed in the double-blind, Placebo-
controlled trial. Effects on serum uric acid 
are attributable to the reversible renal 
hemodynamic changes that occur in 
response to tolvaptan’s effects on urine 
osmolality and may be clinically relevant. 
However, events of increased uric acid 
and/or gout were not serious and did not 
cause discontinuation of therapy in the 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Uric 
acid concentrations are to be evaluated 
prior to initiation of Jinarc therapy, and as 
indicated during treatment based on 
symptoms.

plasma concentrations have been 
decreased by up to 87% (AUC) after the 
administration of CYP3A4 inducers. 
Caution should be exercised in co-
administering CYP3A4 inducers (eg, 
rifampicin, barbiturates) with tolvaptan. 
In healthy subjects, tolvaptan, a CYP3A4 
substrate, had no effect on the plasma 
concentrations of some other CYP3A4 
substrates (eg, warfarin or amiodarone). 
Tolvaptan increased plasma levels of 
lovastatin by 1.3 to 1.5-fold. Even though 
this increase has no clinical relevance, it 
indicates tolvaptan can potentially 
increase exposure to CYP3A4 substrates.

•  Section 4.5 In addition to its renal 
aquaretic effect, tolvaptan is capable of 
blocking vascular vasopressin V2 
receptors involved in the release of 
coagulation factors (eg, von Willebrand 
factor) from endothelial cells. Therefore, 
the effect of vasopressin analogues such 
as desmopressin may be attenuated in 
patients using such analogues to prevent 
or control bleeding when co-administered 
with tolvaptan.

•  Section 4.5 Diuretics: Tolvaptan has not 
been extensively studied in ADPKD in 
combination with diuretics. While there 
does not appear to be a synergistic or 
additive effect of concomitant use of 
tolvaptan with loop and thiazide diuretics, 
each class of agent has the potential to 
lead to severe dehydration, which 
constitutes a risk factor for renal 
dysfunction. If dehydration or renal 
dysfunction becomes evident, appropriate 
action must be taken which may include 
the need to interrupt or reduce doses of 
tolvaptan and/or diuretics and increased 
fluid intake. Other potential causes of 
renal dysfunction or dehydration must be 
evaluated and addressed. 
Jinarc SmPC 
•  Section 4.4, Warning and Precautions for 
Use, contains language that includes the 
need for monthly liver function test 
monitoring in the first 18 months of 
Jinarc use and every 3 months thereafter,

•  Section 4.8 undesirable effects 
(anaphylactic shock and rash generalized) 
and a warning statement in SmPC 
Section 4.4 In post-marketing 
experience, anaphylaxis (including 
anaphylactic shock and rash generalised) 
has been reported very rarely following 
administration of tolvaptan. This type of 
reaction occurred after the first 
administration of tolvaptan. If an 
anaphylactic reaction or other serious 
allergic reactions occur, administration of 
tolvaptan must be discontinued 
immediately and appropriate therapy 
initiated. Since hypersensitivity is a 
contraindication (see section 4.3) 
treatment must never be restarted after 
an anaphylactic reaction or other serious 
allergic reactions.

•  Section 5.3 states: Teratogenicity was 
noted in rabbits given 1000 mg/kg/day 
(15 times the exposure from the 
recommended human dose on an AUC 
basis). No teratogenic effects were seen 
in rabbits at 300 mg/kg/day (about 2.5 to 
5.3 times the exposure in humans at the 
recommended dose, based on AUC). In a 
peri- and post-natal study in rats, 
delayed ossification and reduced pup 
bodyweight were seen at the high dose of 
1000 mg/kg/day. The toxic potential of 
tolvaptan was also investigated in 
juvenile rats by 6-week repeated oral 
administration starting from 25 days of 
age (4 days after weaning). Tolvaptan 
was orally administered by gavage at 
doses of 30, 100, and 1000 mg/kg/day. 
No animal died and, overall, treatment-
related changes were generally 
qualitatively comparable to those 
observed in adult rat toxicity studies of 
tolvaptan. 
•  Section 4.3 contraindication: Tolvaptan 
shall not be used during pregnancy. One 
pregnancy in an ADPKD trial resulted in 
spontaneous abortion. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see 
section 5.3). The potential risk for 
humans is unknown.

with severe hepatic impairment the 
benefits and risks of treatment with Jinarc 
must be evaluated carefully. Patients 
must be managed carefully and liver 
enzymes must be monitored regularly 
(see section 4.4). Jinarc is 
contraindicated in patients with elevated 
liver enzymes and/or signs or symptoms 
of liver injury prior to initiation of 
treatment that meet the requirements for 
permanent discontinuation of tolvaptan 
(see sections 4.3 and 4.4). No dose

•  Section 5.1 of the SmPC states Data are 
not currently available to show whether 
long-term therapy with Jinarc continues 
to slow the rate of renal function decline 
and affect clinical outcomes of ADPKD, 
including delay in the onset of end-stage 
renal disease. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of the data submitted in support of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC have been updated.  
Section 4.1 now specifies that Jinarc is indicated in adults with CKD stage 1 to 4 at initiation of treatment, 
as follows: “Jinarc is indicated to slow the progression of cyst development and renal insufficiency of 
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in adults with CKD stage 1 to 3 4 at initiation of 
treatment with evidence of rapidly progressing disease (see section 5.1).” 
Section 4.8 now lists ‘abdominal pain’ in the table of adverse events and presents the data in line with 
QRD recommendations. 
Section 5.1 now includes a description of Study 156-13-210 and its results. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Reference to the obligation to carry out Condition ‘ANX 006’ has been deleted from the Annex II for 
Jinarc. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, which were 
reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do 
not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Clinical trial 156-13-210 was a Phase 3b, Multi-centre, Randomized-withdrawal, Placebo-controlled, 
Double-blind, Parallel-group Trial to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of tolvaptan (45 to 120 mg/day, 
Split-dose) in Subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease Between Late Stage 2 to Early Stage 4 Due to 
Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease. 
This is a completed Post-Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES) as mandated by the CHMP at the time of 
initial approval of tolvaptan for the use in adults to treat autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. 
The study design was acceptable and the characteristics of patients at baseline were balanced between 
the two groups. Statistical significance for both the primary and key secondary endpoints was met, 
according to the MAH’s pre-specified analyses. The safety analysis did not reveal any new adverse events.  
Assessment report  
EMA/508732/2018 
Page 32/34 
 
  
  
 
 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the efficacy and safety of Jinarc in patients with CKD stage 4 is not 
different from that in the already treated patients with stage 1-3 and agreed on the proposed extension 
of indication.    
The overall B/R of Jinarc is positive. 
4.  Recommendations

Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Extension of Indications to the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) in 
adults with CKD stage 4, based on the results of a completed Post Authorisation Efficacy Study (PAES, 
Trial 156-13-210). Trial 156-13-210 is a Phase 3b, Multi-centre, Randomized-withdrawal, Placebo-
controlled, Double-blind, Parallel-group Trial to Compare the Efficacy and Safety of Tolvaptan (45 to 120 
mg/day, Split-dose) in Subjects with Chronic Kidney Disease between Late Stage 2 to Early Stage 4 Due 
to Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.  Submission of these results fulfils the corresponding 
condition mandated by Annex II of the Product Information for tolvaptan (ANX 006). 
Sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and the package leaflet were updated accordingly. Changes in line 
with QRD template and other minor additional editorial changes were also carried out. 
Version 13.3 of the RMP, updated to reflect the study results, was approved. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the following obligation has been fulfilled, and therefore recommends its 
deletion from the Annex II: 
“Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to further define the efficacy of tolvaptan in patients 
with more advanced renal dysfunction on a primary endpoint related to GFR rather than TKV the MAH 
should submit the Final study report of Study 156-13-210 by: Feb-2018.”

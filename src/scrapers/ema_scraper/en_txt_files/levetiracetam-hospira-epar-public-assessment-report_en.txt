2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The Marketing Authorization Application of Levetiracetam Hospira 100 mg/ml concentrate for 
solution for infusion is a generic of the centrally authorised product Keppra which exists as 
film-coated tablets of 250 mg, 500 mg, 750 mg and 1000 mg as oral solution (100 mg/ml) 
and as concentrate for solution for infusion (100 mg/ml).  
The mechanism of action of levetiracetam still remains to be fully elucidated but appears to be 
different from the mechanisms of current antiepileptic medicinal products. In vitro and in vivo 
experiments suggest that levetiracetam does not alter basic cell characteristics and normal 
neurotransmission. 
Levetiracetam is indicated for the treatment of Epilepsy. 
The efficacy and safety of levetiracetam has been demonstrated in several well-controlled 
studies. A summary of these studies can be found in the EPAR of the reference product 
Keppra. 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Levetiracetam Hospira was provided 
and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and 
additional clinical studies were not considered necessary.  
Bioequivalence testing with the reference product was not required under the provisions of the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1: 
“Bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the test product is to be administered as 
an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently 
approved product.” 
The therapeutic indication of Levetiracetam Hospira is: 
Levetiracetam Hospira is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures 
with or without secondary generalisation in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age with 
newly diagnosed epilepsy. 
Levetiracetam Hospira is indicated as adjunctive therapy 
• 
• 
• 
in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in 
adults, adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. 
in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age 
with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. 
in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents 
from 12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy. 
Levetiracetam Hospira concentrate for solution for infusion is an alternative for patients when 
oral administration is temporarily not feasible. This generic application has one more pack size 
than the reference product, which is consistent with the posology and treatment duration as 
approved in the SmPC.

2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is available as a 100 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion of 
levetiracetam as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: sodium acetate trihydrate, glacial acetic acid, sodium chloride and 
water for injections. 
The product is available in 5 ml glass vial (type I) with bromobutyl rubber stoppers and an 
aluminium flip-off seal as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
Levetiracetam is a white to off-white crystalline powder soluble in methanol, acetonitrile and 
water. It presents one single asymmetric centre being the S-enantiomer the active one. 
According to the synthetic process described in this application the active substance is 
consistently obtained as the S-enantiomer and is routinely controlled by a chiral purity test. 
From the presented literature and patents, it is evident that there is no designated 
polymorphic form described for Levetiracetam.  
The specification of the active substance and finished product are in accordance with the 
European Pharmacopoeia. 
The chemical name of Levetiracetam is (S)-2-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)butanamide and has the

Manufacture 
The active substance is synthesised in three steps using commercially available and well 
defined starting materials. The final active substance is purified by crystallisation. 
The designation of the starting materials for the synthesis of the active substance has been 
justified with respect to their impurity profiles, their potential for a carry-over into the final 
active substance, their structural complexity and with respect to their proximity to the final 
intermediate and the drug substance, respectively.  
Information provided describes adequately the manufacturing including reactions conditions, 
quantities of raw materials and yields.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origins and characterised. The carry-over of impurities, 
reagents, solvents and catalysts from the starting material into the final active substance has 
been also discussed.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediates, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The active substance is packaged in double polyethylene bag and sealed. The materials in 
contact with the active substance comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility, identification 
(specific optical rotation, IR; HPLC), assay (HPLC appearance of solution, enatiomeric purity 
(HPLC), impurities (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph Eur), water content (Ph Eur), sulphated ash (Ph 
Eur), residual solvents (GC), microbiological quality (Ph Eur). 
A detailed description for all analytical methods was provided. Full method validation data was 
also provided for the in-house analytical methods in accordance with the relevant ICH 
Guidelines. The analytical methods proposed are suitable to control the quality of the active 
substance. The impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of 
safety.  
Batch analysis data are provided on three production batches produced by the proposed 
synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the active ingredient can be 
manufactured reproducibly. All results are within the specifications and consistent from batch 
to batch. 
Stability 
Three  production  scale  batches  of  the  active  substance  packed  in  the  intended  commercial 
packaging  from  the  proposed  manufacturers  were  put  on  stability  testing  as  per  ICH 
conditions: under long term (25°C/60%RH) for up 48 months and accelerated (40°C/75%RH) 
for up 6 months. The active substance used in the primary stability studies was manufactured 
according to the commercial process.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440524/2013 
Page 8/16 
 
  
  
 
The  following  parameters  were  tested:  appearance,  loss  on  drying,  impurities  (HPLC),  assay 
(HPLC ) and chiral purity (HPLC). 
Forced degradation studies were conducted by exposing the active substance to u.v radiation, 
high  temperature,  aqueous  hydrolysis,  acid,  base  and  oxidative  conditions.  Based  on  these 
studies  it  is  observed  that  Levetiracetam  is  sensitive  to  acidic,  basic,  oxidation  and  aqueous 
conditions. 
Photostability testing following ICH guidelines Q1B was performed on one batch of the active 
substance. The results showed that there are no significant changes for any of the evaluated 
parameters established for the stability studies. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is stable at controlled room 
temperature. The results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The concentrate for solution for infusion has been developed with the objective of developing a 
pharmaceutical form similar to the innovator’s product Keppra concentrate for solution for 
infusion. The formulation development was based on the reference medicinal product, and 
Levetiracetam Hospira contains the same excipients (qualitatively) as in Keppra parenteral 
formulation. 
The excipients used in the manufacturing of Levetiracetam Hospira are commonly used in this 
type of pharmaceutical medicinal products and especially in solutions for infusion. All 
excipients are described in the European Pharmacopoeia and its specifications and analytical 
procedures are also in accordance with the European Pharmacopoeia standards. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Based on the results of the compatibility studies between the active substance and the 
different excipients, it was concluded that there are no compatibility issues.  
Levetiracetam Hospira is administered intravenously and is 100% bioavailable. Therefore, a 
bioequivalence study versus the reference product Keppra was not required. In order to 
demonstrate equivalence between Levetiracetam Hospira and the reference product (Keppra) 
a pharmaceutical equivalence testing was conducted. This Testing included evaluation of 
appearance, identification, pH, assay of Levetiracetam, impurities and enatiomeric purity. 
Based on the results, the Applicant demonstrated that both formulations are equivalent. 
Physical and chemical in-use stability studies for diluted solutions stored in PVC bags were 
conducted during the drug development. Based on the results it was concluded that the 
diluted solution is stable when stored up to 24 hours at 30°C. 
The primary packaging is described as stated in the SmPC. The material complies with Ph.Eur. 
and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by 
stability data. This container was selected on the basis of compatibility and container-closure 
integrity studies and is adequate for the intended use of the medicinal product.

Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of the following main steps: weighing of raw materials and 
volumetric determination of water for injection, preparation of the Levetiracetam solution, 
aseptic filtration, filling, sealing of the vials, final sterilization and packaging. Satisfactory flow-
chart with in-Process Controls of the manufacturing process has been included. 
Terminal  sterilisation  process  by  autoclave  is  used  with  validated  parameters  to  achieve 
overkill cycle.  Validation data concerning product terminal sterilisation (heat distribution and 
penetration) and sterility of bulk solution (microbial efficacy of the cycle) is provided.  
The validation of the manufacturing process has been evaluated on three consecutive 
production scale batches. The quality of the production batches was evaluated through the 
results of in process testing as well as the results of finished product testing. The validation 
protocol was enclosed in the dossier. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form: appearance (visual), identification (specific optical rotation and HPLC), pH (Ph Eur), 
extractable volume (Ph Eur), particulate contamination (Ph Eur ), sterility (Ph Eur), bacterial 
endotoxins (Ph Eur), assay (HPLC ), impurities (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), residual 
solvents (GC) and Osmolality (Ph Eur). 
Batch analysis data of three scale batches of the finished product are provided. The results 
confirm the consistency of the process and its ability to manufacture a product complying with 
the product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 
twenty four months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to six months under accelerated conditions 
at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal 
product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for:  appearance (visual), pH (Ph Eur), particulate contamination (Ph 
Eur), bacterial endotoxins (Ph Eur), sterility, assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC) and 
enantiomeric purity (HPLC). 
One batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. In addition stress stability studies were performed on one 
fully representative batch under various extreme conditions including acid, base, heat and 
oxidation. The data demonstrate that the medicinal product is not affected by light and is 
susceptible to degradation under acid, base, and oxidative conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440524/2013 
Page 10/16 
 
  
  
 
Based on the available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the 
SmPC are acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Levetiracetam is described in the European Pharmacopoeia. Where applicable, specifications 
applied by both the active substance and the finished product manufacturers are in-line with 
the monograph.  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The manufacturing flow-chart was 
provided with suitable in-process controls. The manufacturing process is adequately validated 
at full scale at the proposed manufacturing site and a validation protocol has been presented. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
Based on the data provided the quality of this medicinal product is considered to be 
acceptable. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
None 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been 
provided, which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview 
justified why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC were in line with 
the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies were required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Levetiracetam Hospira is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all levetiracetam containing products and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/440524/2013 
Page 11/16 
 
  
  
 
 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the environmental risk was 
expected to remain unchanged and not to increase. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered the absence of non-clinical data adequately justified considering that the 
pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of levetiracetam are well 
known in light of the experience gained over more than 10 years of marketing of 
levetiracetam containing medicinal products in the EU/EEA.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for a concentrate for solution for infusion containing levetiracetam in an 
aqueous solution in the same amount as the reference product Keppra (100mg/ml). The 
intended use and route of administration is also identical to the reference product.  
In line with the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev.1 in its current version, bioequivalence studies are generally not required for parenteral 
solutions if the test product is to be administered as an aqueous intravenous solution 
containing the same active substance as the currently approved product. Hence, the applicant 
has not conducted any bioequivalence studies in support of this application. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics  
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented by the applicant and no such studies are 
required for this application. However, the applicant provided a clinical overview in support of 
this application, including references to scientific literature on the pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic properties of levetiracetam injectable formulations. 
2.4.3.  Clinical efficacy and safety 
The applicant provided an overview of the scientific literature with regards to the clinical safety 
and efficacy of levetiracetam. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any 
country. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered the lack of additional clinical data adequately justified by the applicant. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview based on up-to-date scientific literature, which was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP.

This application concerns a generic version of levetiracetam concentrate for solution for 
infusion. The reference product Keppra 100 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is 
indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary 
generalisation in patients from 16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy. 
Keppra 100 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion is also indicated as adjunctive therapy: 
• in the treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, 
adolescents and children from 4 years of age with epilepsy. 
• in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with 
Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. 
• in the treatment of primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 
12 years of age with Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy. 
Keppra concentrate is an alternative for patients when oral administration is temporarily not 
feasible. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered 
sufficient.  
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active 
substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information 
from published literature was considered sufficient. 
Bioequivalence testing with the reference product is not required under the provisions of the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1: 
“Bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the test product is to be administered as 
an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently 
approved product.” 
The overall benefit-risk assessment is considered to be positive, since no new indication or 
population is claimed and reference is made to the innovator product for the benefits and risks 
of levetiracetam. Levetiracetam is considered an antiepileptic drug with well known safety and 
efficacy profile for the treatment of various forms of epilepsy, this being supported by 
experience with marketed levetiracetam in a large number of patients.  
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the 
chosen reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation 
activities are required beyond those included in the product information. The CHMP 
furthermore considered that there is sufficient support for concluding on a benefit/risk ratio 
comparable to the reference product.

4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Levetiracetam Hospira as a monotherapy in the 
treatment of partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in patients from 
16 years of age with newly diagnosed epilepsy; as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of 
partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults, adolescents and 
children from 4 years of age with epilepsy, in the treatment of myoclonic seizures in adults 
and adolescents from 12 years of age with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy, in the treatment of 
primary generalised tonic-clonic seizures in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with 
Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsy is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the

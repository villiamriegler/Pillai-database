4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended target dose is 20 mg finerenone once daily. 
The maximum recommended dose is 20 mg finerenone once daily. 
Initiation of treatment 
Serum potassium and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) have to be measured to determine if 
finerenone treatment can be initiated and to determine the starting dose. 
If serum potassium ≤ 4.8 mmol/L, finerenone treatment can be initiated. For monitoring of serum 
potassium, see below ‘Continuation of treatment.’ 
If serum potassium > 4.8 to 5.0 mmol/L, initiation of finerenone treatment may be considered with 
additional serum potassium monitoring within the first 4 weeks based on patient characteristics and 
serum potassium levels (see section 4.4). 
If serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L, finerenone treatment should not be initiated (see section 4.4). 
The recommended starting dose of finerenone is based on eGFR and is presented in table 1.

Continuation of treatment 
Serum potassium and eGFR have to be remeasured 4 weeks after initiation or re-start of finerenone 
treatment or increase in dose (see table 2 to determine continuation of finerenone treatment and dose 
adjustment). 
Thereafter, serum potassium has to be remeasured periodically and as needed based on patient 
characteristics and serum potassium levels. 
See sections 4.4 and 4.5 for more information.

Renal impairment 
Initiation of treatment 
In patients with eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m2, finerenone treatment should not be initiated due to 
limited clinical data (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Continuation of treatment 
In patients with eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, finerenone treatment can be continued with dose 
adjustment based on serum potassium. eGFR should be measured 4 weeks after initiation to determine 
whether the starting dose can be increased to the recommended daily dose of 20 mg (see ‘Posology, 
Continuation of treatment’ and table 2). 
Due to limited clinical data, finerenone treatment should be discontinued in patients who have 
progressed to end-stage renal disease (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2) (see section 4.4). 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with 
- 
severe hepatic impairment: 
Finerenone should not be initiated (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). No data are available. 
- 
- 
moderate hepatic impairment: 
No initial dose adjustment is required. Consider additional serum potassium monitoring and 
adapt monitoring according to patient characteristics (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
mild hepatic impairment: 
No initial dose adjustment is required. 
Concomitant medication 
In patients taking finerenone concomitantly with moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, potassium 
supplements, trimethoprim, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, additional serum potassium monitoring 
and adaptation of monitoring according to patient characteristics should be considered (see 
section 4.4). Finerenone treatment decisions should be made as directed in table 2 (‘Posology, 
Continuation of treatment’). 
Temporary discontinuation of finerenone may be necessary, when patients have to take trimethoprim, 
or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. See sections 4.4 and 4.5 for more information. 
Body weight 
No dose adjustment is necessary based on body weight (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of finerenone in children and adolescents aged under 18 years have not yet 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use 
Tablets may be taken with a glass of water and with or without food (see section 5.2). 
Tablets should not be taken with grapefruit or grapefruit juice (see section 4.5). 
Crushing of tablets 
For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Kerendia tablets may be crushed and mixed 
with water or soft foods, such as apple sauce, directly before oral use (see section 5.2).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hyperkalaemia 
Hyperkalaemia has been observed in patients treated with finerenone (see section 4.8). 
Some patients are at a higher risk to develop hyperkalaemia. 
Risk factors include low eGFR, higher serum potassium and previous episodes of hyperkalaemia. In 
these patients more frequent monitoring has to be considered. 
Initiation and continuation of treatment (see section 4.2) 
If serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L, finerenone treatment should not be initiated. 
If serum potassium > 4.8 to 5.0 mmol/L, initiation of finerenone treatment may be considered with 
additional serum potassium monitoring within the first 4 weeks based on patient characteristics and 
serum potassium levels. 
If serum potassium > 5.5 mmol/L, finerenone treatment has to be withheld. Local guidelines for the 
management of hyperkalaemia have to be followed. 
Once serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, finerenone treatment can be restarted at 10 mg once daily. 
Monitoring 
Serum potassium and eGFR have to be remeasured in all patients 4 weeks after initiation, re-start or 
increase in dose of finerenone. Thereafter, serum potassium has to be assessed periodically and as 
needed based on patient characteristics and serum potassium levels (see section 4.2). 
Concomitant medications 
The risk of hyperkalaemia also may increase with the intake of concomitant medications that may 
increase serum potassium (see section 4.5.). See also ‘Concomitant use of substances that affect 
finerenone exposure’. 
Finerenone should not be given concomitantly with 
- 
- 
potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., amiloride, triamterene) and 
other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), e.g., eplerenone, esaxerenone, 
spironolactone, canrenone. 
Finerenone should be used with caution and serum potassium should be monitored when taken 
concomitantly with 
- 
- 
potassium supplements. 
trimethoprim, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Temporary discontinuation of finerenone may 
be necessary. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
The risk of hyperkalaemia increases with decreasing renal function. Ongoing monitoring of renal 
function should be performed as needed according to standard practice (see section 4.2). 
Initiation of treatment 
Finerenone treatment should not be initiated in patients with eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 as clinical 
data are limited (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Continuation of treatment 
Due to limited clinical data, finerenone treatment should be discontinued in patients who have 
progressed to end-stage renal disease (eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Finerenone treatment should not be initiated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.2). These patients have not been studied (see section 5.2) but a significant increase in 
finerenone exposure is expected. 
The use of finerenone in patients with moderate hepatic impairment may require additional monitoring 
due to an increase in finerenone exposure. Additional serum potassium monitoring and adaptation of 
monitoring have to be considered according to patient characteristics (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Heart failure 
Patients with diagnosed heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and New York Heart 
Association II-IV were excluded from the phase III clinical studies (see section 5.1). 
Concomitant use of substances that affect finerenone exposure 
Moderate and weak CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Serum potassium should be monitored during concomitant use of finerenone with moderate or weak 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers 
Finerenone should not be used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers (see 
section 4.5). 
Grapefruit 
Grapefruit or grapefruit juice should not be consumed during finerenone treatment (see sections 4.2 
and 4.5). 
Embryo-foetal toxicity 
Finerenone should not be used during pregnancy unless there has been careful consideration of the 
benefit for the mother and the risk to the foetus. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking 
finerenone, she should be informed of potential risks to the foetus. 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment 
with finerenone. 
Women should be advised not to breast-feed during treatment with finerenone. 
See sections 4.6 and 5.3 for more information.

Information about excipients 
Kerendia contains lactose 
Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or 
glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
Kerendia contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Finerenone is cleared almost exclusively via cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated oxidative metabolism 
(mainly CYP3A4 [90%] with a small contribution of CYP2C8 [10%]). 
Concomitant use contraindicated 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant use of Kerendia with itraconazole, clarithromycin and other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
(e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, cobicistat, telithromycin or nefazodone) is contraindicated 
(see section 4.3), since a marked increase in finerenone exposure is expected.  
Concomitant use not recommended 
Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers 
Kerendia should not be used concomitantly with rifampicin and other strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., 
carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, St John’s Wort) or with efavirenz and other moderate 
CYP3A4 inducers. These CYP3A4 inducers are expected to markedly decrease finerenone plasma 
concentration and result in reduced therapeutic effect (see section 4.4). 
Certain medicinal products that increase serum potassium 
Kerendia should not be used concomitantly with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., amiloride, 
triamterene) and other MRAs (e.g., eplerenone, esaxerenone, spironolactone, canrenone). It is 
anticipated that these medicinal products increase the risk for hyperkalaemia (see section 4.4) 
Grapefruit 
Grapefruit or grapefruit juice should not be consumed during finerenone treatment, as it is expected to 
increase the plasma concentrations of finerenone through inhibition of CYP3A4 (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4). 
Concomitant use with precautions 
Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In a clinical study, concomitant use of erythromycin (500 mg three times a day) led to a 3.5-fold 
increase in finerenone AUC and 1.9-fold increase in its Cₘₐₓ. In another clinical study, verapamil 
(240 mg controlled-release tablet once daily) led to a 2.7- and 2.2-fold increase in finerenone AUC 
and Cₘₐₓ, respectively. 
Serum potassium may increase, and therefore, monitoring of serum potassium is recommended, 
especially during initiation or changes to dosing of finerenone or the CYP3A4 inhibitor (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Weak CYP3A4 inhibitors 
The physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) simulations suggest that fluvoxamine (100 mg 
twice daily), increases finerenone AUC (1.6-fold) and Cₘₐₓ (1.4-fold). 
Serum potassium may increase, and therefore, monitoring of serum potassium is recommended, 
especially during initiation or changes to dosing of finerenone or the CYP3A4 inhibitor (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Certain medicinal products that increase serum potassium (see section 4.4) 
Concomitant use of Kerendia with potassium supplements and trimethoprim, or 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is anticipated to increase the risk of hyperkalaemia. Monitoring of 
serum potassium is required. 
Temporary discontinuation of Kerendia during trimethoprim, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
treatment may be necessary. 
Antihypertensive medicinal products 
The risk for hypotension increases with concomitant use of multiple other antihypertensive medicinal 
products. In these patients, blood pressure monitoring is recommended. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Contraception in females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during finerenone treatment (see 
section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of finerenone in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
Kerendia should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with finerenone. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking finerenone, she should be 
informed of potential risks to the foetus (see section 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether finerenone/metabolites are excreted in human milk. 
Available pharmacokinetic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of finerenone and its 
metabolites in milk. Rat pups exposed via this route showed adverse reactions (see section 5.3). 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
Kerendia therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman (see section 4.4). 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effect of finerenone on human fertility. 
Animal studies have shown impaired female fertility at exposures considered in excess to the maximum 
human exposure, indicating low clinical relevance (see section 5.3).  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Kerendia has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently reported adverse reaction under treatment with finerenone was hyperkalaemia 
(14.0%). See ‘Description of selected adverse reactions, Hyperkalaemia’ below and section 4.4. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The safety of finerenone in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) was 
evaluated in 2 pivotal phase III studies, FIDELIO-DKD (diabetic kidney disease) and FIGARO-DKD. 
In the FIDELIO-DKD study 2,827 patients received finerenone (10 or 20 mg once daily) with a mean 
duration of treatment of 2.2 years. In the FIGARO-DKD study, 3,683 patients received finerenone 
(10 or 20 mg once daily) with a mean duration of treatment of 2.9 years. 
The adverse reactions observed are listed in table 3. They are classified according to MedDRA`s 
system organ class database and frequency convention. 
Adverse reactions are grouped according to their frequencies in the order of decreasing seriousness. 
Frequencies are defined, as follows: 
Very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hyperkalaemia 
In the pooled data of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies, hyperkalaemia events were reported 
in 14.0% of finerenone-treated patients compared with 6.9% of placebo-treated patients. An increase 
from baseline in mean serum potassium in the first month of treatment of 0.17 mmol/L was observed 
in the finerenone group compared to placebo, which remained stable thereafter. The majority of 
hyperkalaemia events were mild to moderate and resolved in patients treated with finerenone. Serious 
events of hyperkalaemia were reported more frequently for finerenone (1.1%) than for placebo (0.2%). 
Serum potassium concentrations > 5.5 mmol/L and > 6.0 mmol/L were reported in 16.8% and 3.3% of 
finerenone-treated patients and in 7.4% and 1.2% of placebo-treated patients, respectively. 
Hyperkalaemia leading to permanent discontinuation in patients who received finerenone was 1.7% 
versus 0.6% in the placebo group. Hospitalisation due to hyperkalaemia in the finerenone group was 
0.9% versus 0.2% in the placebo group.  
For specific recommendations, refer to sections 4.2 and 4.4. 
Hypotension 
In the pooled data of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies, hypotension events were reported in 
4.6% of finerenone-treated patients compared with 3.0% of placebo-treated patients. In 3 patients 
(< 0.1%), finerenone treatment was permanently discontinued due to hypotension. Hospitalisation due 
to hypotension was the same in patients receiving finerenone or placebo (< 0.1%). 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The majority of hypotension events were mild or moderate and resolved in patients treated with 
finerenone. The mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 2-4 mm Hg and the mean diastolic blood 
pressure decreased by 1-2 mm Hg at month 1, remaining stable thereafter. 
Hyperuricaemia 
In the pooled data of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies, hyperuricaemia events were 
reported in 5.1% of finerenone-treated patients compared with 3.9% of placebo-treated patients. All 
events were non-serious and did not result in permanent discontinuation in patients who received 
finerenone. An increase from baseline in mean serum uric acid of 0.3 mg/dL was seen in the 
finerenone group compared to placebo up to month 16, which attenuated over time. No difference 
between the finerenone group and the placebo group was observed for reported events of gout (3.0%). 
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decreased 
In the pooled data of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies, GFR decreased events were 
reported in 5.3% of finerenone-treated patients compared with 4.2% of placebo-treated patients. GFR 
decreased events leading to permanent discontinuation were the same in patients receiving finerenone 
or placebo (0.2%). Hospitalisation due to decreased GFR was the same in patients receiving 
finerenone or placebo (< 0.1%). The majority of GFR decreased events were mild or moderate and 
resolved in patients treated with finerenone. Patients on finerenone experienced an initial decrease in 
eGFR (mean 2 mL/min/1.73 m2) that attenuated over time compared to placebo. This decrease 
appeared to be reversible during continuous treatment. 
Haemoglobin decreased 
In the pooled data of FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies, finerenone was associated with a 
placebo-corrected absolute decrease in mean haemoglobin of 0.15 g/dL and mean haematocrit of 0.5% 
after 4 months of treatment. Anaemia reporting was comparable in finerenone-treated patients (6.5%) 
and placebo-treated patients (6.1%). The frequency of serious events of anaemia was low in both the 
finerenone-treated and placebo-treated patients (0.5%). Changes in haemoglobin and haematocrit were 
transient and reached comparable levels to those observed in the placebo-treated group after about 
24-32 months. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The most likely manifestation of overdose is anticipated to be hyperkalaemia. If hyperkalaemia 
develops, standard treatment should be initiated. 
Finerenone is unlikely to be efficiently removed by haemodialysis given its fraction bound to plasma 
proteins of about 90%.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, ATC code: C03DA05 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Finerenone is a nonsteroidal, selective antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) which is 
activated by aldosterone and cortisol and regulates gene transcription. Its binding to the MR leads to a 
specific receptor-ligand complex that blocks recruitment of transcriptional coactivators implicated in 
the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre 
phase III studies in adult patients with CKD and T2D, the placebo-corrected relative reduction in 
urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in patients randomised to finerenone was 31% and 32%, 
respectively at month 4 and UACR remained reduced throughout both studies. 
In ARTS-DN, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase IIb study in adult 
patients with CKD and T2D, the placebo-corrected relative reduction in UACR at Day 90 was 25% 
and 38% in patients treated with finerenone 10 mg and 20 mg once daily, respectively. 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
A dedicated QT study in 57 healthy participants showed that finerenone has no effect on cardiac 
repolarisation. There was no indication of a QT/QTc prolonging effect of finerenone after single doses 
of 20 mg (therapeutic) or 80 mg (supratherapeutic). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies investigated the effect of finerenone compared to 
placebo on kidney and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in adult patients with CKD and T2D. 
Patients were required to be receiving standard of care, including a maximum tolerated labelled dose 
of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). 
Patients with diagnosed heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and New York Heart Association 
II-IV were excluded due to the class 1A recommendation for MRA therapy. 
In the FIDELIO-DKD study patients were eligible based on evidence of persistent albuminuria 
(> 30 mg/g to 5,000 mg/g), an eGFR of 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium ≤ 4.8 mmol/L 
at screening. 
The primary endpoint was a composite of time to first occurrence of kidney failure (defined as chronic 
dialysis or kidney transplantation, or a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 over at 
least 4 weeks), a sustained decline in eGFR of 40% or more compared to baseline over at least 
4 weeks, or renal death. The key secondary endpoint was a composite of time to first occurrence of 
CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke or hospitalisation for heart failure. 
A total of 5,674 patients were randomised to receive either finerenone (N = 2,833) or placebo 
(N = 2,841) and included in the analyses. The median follow-up was 2.6 years. The dose of finerenone 
or placebo could be adjusted between 10 mg and 20 mg once daily during the course of the study, 
based mainly on serum potassium concentration. At month 24, of the subjects treated with finerenone, 
67% were treated with 20 mg once daily, 30% with 10 mg once daily and 3% were on a treatment 
interruption. 
After the end of study, vital status was obtained for 99.7% of patients. The study population was 63% 
White, 25% Asian and 5% Black. The mean age at enrolment was 66 years and 70% of patients were 
male. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 44.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, with 55% of patients having an 
eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, median UACR was 852 mg/g, and mean HbA1c was 7.7%, 46% had a 
history of atherosclerotic CV disease, 30% a history of coronary artery disease, 8% a history of cardiac 
failure, and the mean blood pressure was 138/76 mm Hg. The mean duration of T2D at baseline was 
16.6 years and a history of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic neuropathy was reported in 47% and 26% 
of patients, respectively. At baseline, almost all patients were on ACEi (34%) or ARB (66%), and 97% 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of patients used one or more antidiabetic medications (insulin [64%], biguanides [44%], glucagon-like 
peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists [7%], sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors [5%]). 
The other most frequent medications taken at baseline were statins (74%) and calcium channel 
blockers (63%). 
A statistically significant difference in favour of finerenone was shown for the primary composite 
endpoint and the key secondary composite endpoint (see figure 1/table 4 below). The treatment effect 
for the primary and key secondary endpoints was generally consistent across subgroups, including 
region, eGFR, UACR, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and HbA1c at baseline. 
In the FIGARO-DKD study patients were eligible, based on evidence of persistent albuminuria having 
an UACR of ≥ 30 mg/g to < 300 mg/g and an eGFR of 25 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, or an UACR 
≥ 300 mg/g and an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening. Patients were required to have a serum 
potassium of ≤ 4.8 mmol/L at screening. 
The primary endpoint was a composite of time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal 
stroke or hospitalisation for heart failure. The secondary endpoint was a composite of time to kidney 
failure, a sustained decline in eGFR of 40% or more compared to baseline over at least 4 weeks, or 
renal death. 
A total of 7,352 patients were randomised to receive either finerenone (N = 3,686), or placebo 
(N = 3,666) and included in the analyses. The median follow-up was 3.4 years. The dose of finerenone 
or placebo could be adjusted between 10 mg and 20 mg once daily during the course of the study, 
based mainly on serum potassium concentration. At month 24, of the subjects treated with finerenone, 
82% were treated with 20 mg once daily, 15% with 10 mg once daily and 3% were on a treatment 
interruption. After the end of study, vital status was obtained for 99.8% of patients. The study 
population was 72% White, 20% Asian and 4% Black. The mean age at enrolment was 64 years and 
69% of patients were male. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 67.8 mL/min/1.73 m2, with 62% of 
patients having an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, median UACR was 308 mg/g, and mean HbA1c was 
7.7%, 45% of patients had a history of atherosclerotic CV disease, 8% had a history of cardiac failure, 
and the mean blood pressure was 136/77 mm Hg. The mean duration of T2D at baseline was 
14.5 years and a history of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic neuropathy was reported in 31% and 28% 
of patients, respectively. At baseline, almost all patients were on ACEi (43%) or ARB (57%), and 98% 
of patients used one or more antidiabetic medications (insulin [54%], biguanides [69%], GLP-1 
receptor agonists [7%], SGLT2 inhibitors [8%]). The other most frequent medication taken at baseline 
was statins (71%). 
A statistically significant difference in favour of finerenone was shown for the CV primary composite 
endpoint (see figure 2/table 5 below). The treatment effect for the primary endpoint was consistent 
across subgroups, including region, eGFR, UACR, SBP and HbA1c at baseline.  
A lower incidence rate of the secondary composite outcome of kidney failure, sustained eGFR decline 
of 40% or more or renal death was observed in the finerenone group compared to placebo, however 
this difference did not achieve statistical significance (see table 5 below). The treatment effect for the 
kidney secondary composite endpoint was consistent across subgroups of eGFR at baseline, but for the 
subgroup of patients with UACR < 300 mg/g the HR was 1.16 (95% CI 0.91; 1.47) and for the 
subgroup of patients with UACR ≥ 300 mg/g the HR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.62; 0.90). 
Additional prespecified secondary time-to-event endpoints are included in table 5.

Figure 2: Time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or 
hospitalisation for heart failure in the FIGARO-DKD study 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Kerendia in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of chronic kidney disease 
(see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Finerenone is almost completely absorbed after oral administration. Absorption is rapid with 
maximum plasma concentrations (Cₘₐₓ) appearing between 0.5 and 1.25 hours after tablet intake in the 
fasted state. The absolute bioavailability of finerenone is 43.5% due to first-pass metabolism in the 
gut-wall and liver. Finerenone is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein in vitro, which is 
however not considered relevant for its absorption in vivo due to the high permeability of finerenone. 
Effect of food 
Intake with high fat, high calorie food increased finerenone AUC by 21%, reduced Cₘₐₓ by 19% and 
prolonged the time to reach Cₘₐₓ to 2.5 hours. Since this is not considered as clinically relevant, 
finerenone can be taken with or without food. 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution at steady state (Vₛₛ) of finerenone is 52.6 L. The human plasma protein 
binding of finerenone in vitro is 91.7%, with serum albumin being the main binding protein. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biotransformation 
Approximately 90% of finerenone metabolism is mediated by CYP3A4 and 10% by CYP2C8. Four 
major metabolites were found in plasma. All metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. 
Elimination 
The elimination of finerenone from plasma is rapid with an elimination half-life (t½) of about 2 to 
3 hours. Systemic blood clearance of finerenone is about 25 L/h. About 80% of the administered dose 
was excreted via urine and approximately 20% of the dose was excreted via faeces. Excretion was 
almost exclusively in the form of metabolites, while excretion of unchanged finerenone represents a 
minor route (< 1% of dose in the urine due to glomerular filtration, < 0.2% in the faeces). 
Linearity 
Finerenone pharmacokinetics are linear across the investigated dose range from 1.25 to 80 mg given as 
single dose tablets. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
Of the 2,827 patients who received finerenone in the FIDELIO-DKD study, 58% of patients were 
65 years and older, and 15% were 75 years and older. Of the 3,683 patients who received finerenone 
in the FIGARO-DKD study, 52% of patients were 65 years and older, and 13% were 75 years and 
older. 
In both studies, no overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and 
younger patients. 
In a phase I study (N = 48) elderly healthy participants (≥ 65 years of age) exhibited higher finerenone 
plasma concentrations than younger healthy participants (≤ 45 years of age), with mean AUC and Cₘₐₓ 
values being 34% and 51% higher in the elderly (see section 4.2). Population-pharmacokinetic 
analyses did not identify age as a covariate for finerenone AUC or Cₘₐₓ. 
Renal impairment 
Mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CLCR] 60 to < 90 mL/min) did not affect finerenone 
AUC and Cₘₐₓ. 
Compared to patients with normal renal function (CLCR ≥ 90 mL/min), the effect of moderate 
(CLCR 30 to < 60 mL/min) or severe (CLCR < 30 mL/min) renal impairment on AUC of finerenone was 
similar with increases by 34-36%. Moderate or severe renal impairment had no effect on Cₘₐₓ (see 
section 4.2). 
Due to the high plasma protein binding, finerenone is not expected to be dialysable. 
Hepatic impairment 
There was no change in finerenone exposure in cirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.2). 
In cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic impairment, finerenone total and unbound AUC were 
increased by 38% and 55%, respectively, while no change in Cₘₐₓ was observed compared to healthy 
control participants (see section 4.2). 
There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
Body weight 
Population-pharmacokinetic analyses identified body weight as a covariate for finerenone Cₘₐₓ. The 
Cₘₐₓ of a subject with a body weight of 50 kg was estimated to be 38% to 51% higher compared to a 
subject of 100 kg. Dose adaptation based on body weight is not warranted (see section 4.2). 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships 
The concentration-effect relationship over time for UACR was characterised by a maximum effect 
model indicating saturation at high exposures. The model-predicted time to reach the full (99%) 
steady-state drug effect on UACR was 138 days. The pharmacokinetic (PK) half-life was 2-3 hours 
and PK steady state was achieved after 2 days, indicating an indirect and delayed effect on 
pharmacodynamic responses. 
Clinical studies with no relevant drug-drug interactions 
Concomitant use of gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily), a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8, increased 
finerenone mean AUC and Cₘₐₓ 1.1-fold and 1.2-fold, respectively. This is not considered as clinically 
relevant. 
Pre- and co-treatment with the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (40 mg once daily) had no effect on 
finerenone mean AUC and mean Cₘₐₓ. 
Concomitant use of antacid aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide (70 mVal) had no effect 
on finerenone mean AUC and reduced its mean Cₘₐₓ by 19%. This is not considered as clinically 
relevant. 
In vivo a multiple-dose regimen of 20 mg finerenone given once daily for 10 days had no relevant 
effect on the AUC of the CYP3A4 probe substrate midazolam. Therefore, a clinically relevant 
inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 by finerenone can be excluded. 
A single dose of 20 mg finerenone also had no clinically relevant effect on AUC and Cₘₐₓ of the 
CYP2C8 probe substrate repaglinide. Thus, finerenone does not inhibit CYP2C8. 
Lack of mutual pharmacokinetic interaction was demonstrated between finerenone and the CYP2C9 
substrate warfarin and between finerenone and the P-gp substrate digoxin. 
Multiple doses of 40 mg finerenone once daily had no clinically relevant effect on AUC and Cₘₐₓ of 
the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP) 
substrate rosuvastatin. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single dose toxicity, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, phototoxicity, carcinogenic 
potential and male and female fertility. 
Repeated dose toxicity 
In dogs, a reduced prostate weight and size was found at an AUCunbound of about 10 to 60 times that in 
humans. The dose free of findings provides a safety margin of about 2. 
Carcinogenic potential 
In 2-year carcinogenicity studies, finerenone did not show carcinogenic potential in male and female 
rats or female mice. In male mice, finerenone resulted in an increase in Leydig cell adenoma at doses 
representing 26 times the AUCunbound in humans. A dose representing 17 times the AUCunbound in 
humans did not cause any tumours. Based on the known sensitivity of rodents to develop these 
tumours and the pharmacology-based mechanism at supratherapeutic doses as well as adequate safety 
margins, the increase in Leydig cell tumours in male mice is not clinically relevant. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Toxicity to development 
In the embryo-foetal toxicity study in rats, finerenone resulted in reduced placental weights and signs 
of foetal toxicity, including reduced foetal weights and retarded ossification at the maternal toxic dose 
of 10 mg/kg/day corresponding to an AUCunbound of 19 times that in humans. At 30 mg/kg/day, the 
incidence of visceral and skeletal variations was increased (slight oedema, shortened umbilical cord, 
slightly enlarged fontanelle) and one foetus showed complex malformations including a rare 
malformation (double aortic arch) at an AUCunbound of about 25 times that in humans. The doses free of 
any findings (low dose in rats, high dose in rabbits) provided safety margins of 10 to 13 times for 
AUCunbound. Therefore, the findings in rats do not indicate an increased concern for foetal harm. 
When rats were exposed during pregnancy and lactation in the pre- and postnatal developmental 
toxicity study, increased pup mortality and other adverse effects (lower pup weight, delayed pinna 
unfolding) were observed at about 4 times the AUCunbound expected in humans. In addition, the 
offspring showed slightly increased locomotor activity, but no other neurobehavioural changes starting 
at about 4 times the AUCunbound expected in humans. The dose free of findings provided a safety 
margin of about 2 for AUCunbound. The increased locomotor activity in offspring may indicate a 
potential risk for the foetus. In addition, because of the findings in pups, a risk for the nursing 
newborn/infant cannot be excluded. 
Female fertility 
Finerenone caused reduced female fertility (decreased number of corpora lutea and implantation sites) 
as well as signs of early embryonic toxicity (increased post-implantational loss and decreased number 
of viable foetuses) at about 21 times the human AUCunbound. In addition, reduced ovarian weights were 
found at about 17 times the human AUCunbound. No effects on female fertility and early embryonic 
development were found at 10 times the human AUCunbound. Therefore, the findings in female rats are 
of little clinical relevance (see section 4.6).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Kerendia is and what it is used for 
Kerendia contains the active substance finerenone. Finerenone works by blocking the action of certain 
hormones (mineralocorticoids) that can damage your kidneys and heart. 
Kerendia is used for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease (with abnormal presence of 
the protein albumin in the urine) associated with type 2 diabetes.  
Chronic kidney disease is a long-term condition. Your kidneys keep getting worse at removing waste 
and fluids from your blood. 
Type 2 diabetes is when your body cannot keep your blood sugar levels normal. Your body does not 
produce enough of the hormone insulin or cannot use the insulin properly. This leads to a high level of 
sugar in your blood. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Kerendia 
Do not take Kerendia if you 
- 
- 
are allergic to finerenone or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
are taking medicines that belong to the group of ‘strong CYP3A4 inhibitors’, for example 
- 
- 
- 
- 
have Addison’s disease (when your body does not produce enough of the hormones ‘cortisol’ 
and ‘aldosterone’). 
itraconazole or ketoconazole (to treat fungal infections) 
ritonavir, nelfinavir, or cobicistat (to treat HIV infection) 
clarithromycin, telithromycin (to treat bacterial infections) 
nefazodone (to treat depression). 
- 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Kerendia if you have 
ever been told you had a high level of potassium in your blood. 
- 
severe loss of kidney function or kidney failure. 
- 
moderate or severe liver problems. 
- 
mild, moderate or severe heart failure. This is when your heart does not pump blood as well as it 
- 
should. It does not pump enough blood out of the heart in one beat. 
Blood tests 
These tests check your potassium level and how your kidneys are working. 
Using the results of your blood tests, your doctor decides whether you can start to take Kerendia. 
After 4 weeks of taking Kerendia, you will have more blood tests. 
Your doctor may test your blood at other times, for example while you are taking certain medicines. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents under 18 years because it is not known yet 
whether it is safe and effective in this age group. 
Other medicines and Kerendia 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Your doctor will tell you which medicines you can take. Your doctor may need to test your 
blood to make sure. 
You must not take medicines that belong to the group of ‘strong CYP3A4 inhibitors,’ while taking 
Kerendia (see section 2 “Do not take Kerendia…”). 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines while taking Kerendia,

COMP opinion (adoption via written

procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
2.1.  Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2001 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
“Whereas the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), having examined the application, 
concluded: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
based on the submitted evidence the rationale for the use of the product in Type A disease has not 
been substantiated. Therefore, the condition has been limited to include only patients with Type B 
disease (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.04 in 10,000 persons in the Community, at 
the time the application was made; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to the deleterious effects on the 
respiratory system and the liver and due to the significant reduction in life expectancy; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory treatment that has been authorised in the Community for 
patients affected by the condition. 
the COMP recommends the designation this medicinal product, containing Recombinant human acid 
sphingomyelinase (rhASM), as an orphan medicinal product for the orphan indication: treatment of 
Niemann-Pick Disease type B.” 
2.2.  Amendment of an existing orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the amendment of the orphan medicinal product designation 
in 2016 was based on the following grounds: 
“Genzyme Europe BV, the sponsor of the orphan designation of a medicinal product containing 
recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase for treatment of Niemann-Pick disease, type B submitted 
on 20 July 2016 an application for amendment of the existing designation. The proposed amended 
indication is: treatment of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency. The application was submitted on the 
basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
For the purpose of amendment of an existing designation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) considered that the amended condition proposed by the sponsor should be renamed 
as “Niemann-Pick disease” (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”). 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the amended condition with the medicinal product containing recombinant 
human acid sphingomyelinase was considered justified based on preliminary clinical data 
demonstrating that treatment improved spleen volume, liver volume and pulmonary function in 
patients affected by the condition; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to severe early onset neurological 
symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, infiltrative lung disease, atherogenic lipid

profile, osteoporosis, osteopenia, and cardiovascular disease leading to a significant reduction in 
life expectancy; 
• 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made. 
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal 
product containing recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase will be of significant benefit to those 
affected by the condition. There is one product authorised for Niemann-Pick disease type C, and no 
authorised products for Niemann-Pick disease type A and B. The proposed product is an enzyme 
replacement therapy for the treatment of patients affected by patients that can be categorised as 
Niemann-Pick type A and B patients. This is supported by clinical data that demonstrate that the 
treatment improved spleen volume, liver volume and pulmonary function in Niemann-Pick disease type 
B patients. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the amendment 
of the designation as follows: the medicinal product containing recombinant human acid 
sphingomyelinase for the orphan indication: treatment of Niemann-Pick disease”. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Niemann-Pick Disease (NPD) comprises a group of autosomal recessive inherited lysosomal storage 
disorders. These disorders have in common the deficient and/or very low activity of the lysosomal 
hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase. Two such groups of patients are described in the literature, the first 
characterised by a deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM; “types A & B”, caused by mutations in 
the SMPD1 gene), and the second is due to defective function in cholesterol transport (“type C” caused 
by mutations in NPC1 in approximately 95% of cases or NPC2 gene) (Schuchman and Desnick, Mol 
Genet Metab. 2017 Jan - Feb). Type A is characterised by early hepatosplenomegaly and profound CNS 
manifestations, while type B only rarely exhibit CNS manifestations. Type C patients also manifest 
organomegaly and neurodegeneration (Patterson and Walkley, Mol Genet Metab. 2017 Jan - Feb). 
Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is a lysosomal phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 
sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphocholine (Schuman and Desnick, 7th Ed NY, 1995). ASM activity 
is deficient in Niemann-Pick disease Types A and B.

NPC exhibits phenotypic heterogeneity, comprising systemic, neurological, and psychiatric features. 
Neonatal NPC patients frequently have an increase in bile acid concentration in the liver, and 10% of 
these patients die of liver failure before six months of age. The symptoms of NPC patients who survive 
infancy are dominated by progressive neurodegeneration, characterised by features such as cerebellar 
ataxia, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, dysphagia, gait disorder with falls and dementia. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Xenpozyme is indicated as an enzyme replacement therapy for 
the treatment of non-Central Nervous System (CNS) manifestations of Acid Sphingomyelinase 
Deficiency (ASMD) in paediatric and adult patients with type A/B or type B.” falls within the scope of 
the designated orphan condition “Treatment of Niemann-Pick disease”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
At the time of initial designation and review at initial marketing authorisation, the COMP agreed that 
the condition was chronically debilitating and life-threatening. 
At the time of this review Niemann-Pick Disease is presented to the COMP to remain chronically 
debilitating and life-threatening disease. However, the signs and symptoms depend on the type and 
severity of the condition.  The clinical presentation and course of NPD Type A is relatively uniform. 
Typically, in the first few months of life the spleen and liver will enlarge. Moderate lymphadenopathy is 
present and by bone marrow examination the Niemann-Pick foam cells are revealed. Early neurologic 
manifestations include hypotonia and muscular weakness. By 6 months of age the psychomotor 
retardation becomes evident, and as the infant becomes progressively weaker and hypotonic, 
retrogression of developmental milestones is noted. With advancing of age the loss of motor function 
and the deterioration of intellectual capabilities are progressively debilitating. Followed in later stages 
by spasticity and rigidity. Patients generally succumb before 3 years of age, due to the gradual 
progression of neurological symptoms (Besley and Elleder, J Inherit Metab Dis, 1986, Schuman and 
Desnick, 7th Ed NY, 1995). 
The onset and clinical course of Type B NPD is highly variable.  In the most severely affected Type B 
NPD patients the disease is diagnosed early in childhood by organomegaly and minor decreased 
pulmonary involvement which progresses with age.  Severely affected individuals may experience 
significant pulmonary involvement by 15-20 years of age as well as liver involvement leading to life-
threatening cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and ascites.  Other heavily involved organ systems include 
bone and spleen with lesser involvement in the lymph nodes, heart, and eyes.  In general, Type B 
patients do not have neurologic involvement and are intellectually normal. The primary cause of death 
is related to pulmonary complications (Besley and Elleder, J Inherit Metab Dis, 1986, Schuman and 
Desnick, 7th Ed NY, 1995Crocker and Farber S., Medicine 1958). 
The COMP concluded that the condition remains chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to 
severe early onset neurological symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, infiltrative lung 
disease, atherogenic lipid profile, osteoporosis, osteopenia and cardiovascular disease leading to a 
significant reduction in life expectancy. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation, the prevalence (P) was agreed to be less than 0.5 per 10,000. 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000072975  
Page 6/10 
 
 
 
For this review the prevalence was presented to the COMP to remain less than 5 per 10,000 and was 
estimated to be 0.047 per 10,000. 
For the calculation of the prevalence the sponsor calculated the sum of the prevalence for ASMD and 
for NPD type C. 
The prevalence calculation for ASMD provided is based on the highest estimate of 0.6 per 100,000 
birth prevalence seen in the epidemiology birth prevalence literature including patients across the 
ASMD spectrum (see Table 1). The studies have rates ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 per 100,000. The lowest 
(approximately 0.3/100,000) is seen in a study in the Czech Republic. The highest rate (0.6/100,000) 
is found in a study in Portugal. Given the limitations of the epidemiological literature, both in 
estimation of prevalence and distinction of subgroups at the extreme ends of the ASMD spectrum, the 
most conservative rate of 0.6 per 100,000 was used for the whole, combined population.

NPD A = infantile neurovisceral end of the ASMD spectrum;  
NPD B = chronic visceral end of the ASMD spectrum;   
NPD A+B = ASMD disease across the spectrum; 
NPD C = type C disease 
The duration of disease (D) used for the calculation will be 65 years based on the data described by 
McGovern and colleagues (McGovern et al., Genet Med. 2013) and the surviving population ages 
described by Hollak (Hollak et al., Mol Gen Metab. 2012) 
Using the conservative number of 0.06/10,000 for the birth prevalence and the conservative life 
expectancy of 65 years from epidemiological studies, the expected total number of individuals with 
ASMD is 0.037 per 10,000. This calculation is here-below:  
P = I x D= (4.2M births x 0.06/10,000 births) x 65 / 448M = 0.037 per 10,000 persons for the ASMD. 
Since the orphan condition also entails NPD type C, the sponsor also calculated the prevalence of the 
NPD type C. For NPD type C, based on a recent study (in US), and birth incidence data from France, 
UK and Germany (1988-2002, Vanier MT, Millat G: Niemann-Pick disease type C. Clin Genet. 2003, 64: 
269-281.)  The prevalence of diagnosed NPD type C has been estimated at about 1 per million 
inhabitants (=0.01 per 10,000 persons). However, the sponsor’s prevalence estimate might be 
underestimated, as these data were based on prevalence/incidence at birth and involve early onset 
NPD type C, thereby excluding late-onset patients. Moreover, based on the same European data, the 
COMP previously estimated the prevalence at approximately 0.1 /10,000 for NPD type C.  With the 
availability of miglustat for the treatment of NPD-C the proportion of adolescent/adult-onset NP-C 
cases diagnosed in France increased 2.5-fold since 2009 compared with the 2000-2008 period due to 
improved awareness. (Y. Nadjar, Orphanet J Rare Dis 2018; 13(1):175)  
Altogether, the COMP considered a prevalence estimate of approximately 0.1 would be in line with 
most recent orphan designations for the total Nieman Pick disease population in the EU including all 
disease types.     
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
There is currently no “standard of care” treatment for the disease, and symptoms are managed with 
supportive measures.  Splenectomy is occasionally performed for thrombocytopenia, but removal of 
the spleen has been known to exacerbate lung involvement.  Liver transplantation is rarely performed, 
and bone marrow transplantation is associated with high morbidity and mortality.  Palliative treatment 
with lipid-lowering drugs, antibiotics, and supplemental oxygen (O2) has limited benefit. 
Zavesca is currently authorised for the treatment of patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C, which 
is an entirely different target population than patients with Niemann-Pick disease type A and B. The 
proposed product Xenpozyme is able to treat patients of Niemann-Pick subtypes A/B and B, for whom 
currently no authorised products exist. 
The COMP concluded that there is no approved treatment that qualifies as a satisfactory treatment for 
the purpose of the examination of the significant benefit vis-à-vis Xenpozyme, as the authorised 
treatment options do not cover the patient population for which Xenpozyme is intended.   
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000072975  
Page 8/10 
 
 
 
Significant benefit 
Xenpozyme is intended for a patient population for whom no other satisfactory method is available 
(see above). No justification of significant benefit is therefore required.

5.  COMP position adopted on 23 May 2022 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of Niemann-Pick disease (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated 
to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be approximately 0.1 in 10,000 persons in the 
European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life threatening due to severe early onset neurological 
symptoms in type A, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, interstitial lung disease, atherogenic 
lipid profile, osteoporosis, osteopenia, and cardiovascular disease leading to a significant reduction 
in life expectancy; 
there is, at present, no satisfactory method for the treatment of the entirety of patients covered by 
the therapeutic indication of Xenpozyme. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Xenpozyme, recombinant human 
acid sphingomyelinase, olipudase alfa for treatment of Niemann-Pick disease (EU/3/01/056) is not 
removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

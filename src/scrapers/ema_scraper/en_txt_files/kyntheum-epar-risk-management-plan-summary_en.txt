Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan  
Summary of risk management plan for Kyntheum® (brodalumab) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Kyntheum®. The RMP details important 
risks of Kyntheum®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Kyntheum®’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Kyntheum®’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Kyntheum® should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Kyntheum® should be read in the context of all this information, 
including the assessment report of the evaluation, and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Kyntheum®’s 
RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Kyntheum® is authorised for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients 
who are candidates for systemic therapy (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains brodalumab 
as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Kyntheum’s benefits can be found in Kyntheum’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/kyntheum. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the 
risks 
Important risks of Kyntheum®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Kyntheum®'s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and is 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Kyntheum® is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Kyntheum® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Kyntheum®. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

Important identified risk - Infections

risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
In the clinical trials, patients were more likely to 
develop infections while taking brodalumab. Most 
infections were mild or moderate and could be easily 
managed. 
Concomitant treatment with immunosuppressants such 
as methotrexate or corticosteroids may increase the risk 
of infections.

groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Patients with psoriasis are known to be at an increased 
risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour compared with 
the general population. This is partially because risk 
factors for suicidality, such as anxiety and depression, 
are more common in patients with psoriasis than in 
those without psoriasis. Some patients in clinical trials 
for brodalumab experienced suicidal thoughts and 
behaviour, including a small number who committed 
suicide. Many of these patients had a history of 
depression and/or suicidal thoughts or behaviour. A 
causal relationship between brodalumab treatment and 
suicidal thoughts and behaviour has not been 
established.  Doctors should inform patients receiving 
brodalumab to tell their doctor if they experience new or 
worsening depression, suicidal thoughts, or mood 
changes. 
History of suicidality is a well-recognised predictor of 
subsequent suicide thoughts or behaviour and was 
demonstrated in the psoriasis programme, where 
subjects with a known history of suicidality who 
reported an event of suicide thoughts or behaviour had a 
30-fold higher rate of suicide thoughts or behaviour 
compared with subjects with no history of suicidality 
(5.05 per 100 subject-years versus 0.16 per 100 subject-
years, respectively).

Important potential risk – Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (serious heart 
problems)

risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Patients with psoriasis are often at increased risk of 
serious heart problems because they are more likely to 
have known risk factors, including increased levels of 
fat and sugar in the blood, obesity, and high blood 
pressure. It is not yet known if brodalumab increases 
further the likelihood of heart or circulation problems in 
patients with psoriasis. 
Subjects for whom a major cardiac event was reported 
had one or more of the following major cardiovascular 
risk factors and additional confounding diseases: 
obesity, diabetes, tobacco use, increased blood pressure, 
abnormal amount of lipids in the blood (dyslipidemia), 
previous cardiac medical history e.g. arrythmia and 
hearth failure. 
No specific measures are required for patients receiving 
brodalumab; standard of care is adequate.

Additional 
pharmacovigilance 
activities 
Brodalumab is a targeted immunomodulatory agent but 
is not considered a general immunosuppressant. 
Humans with genetic mutation (changes in genetic 
information) of IL-17F or IL-17RA are not reported to 
have an enhanced malignancy risk. The potential for 
carcinogenic risk of brodalumab is considered low and 
the evidence from non-clinical and clinical experience 
support that there is no increased risk of malignancy.   
A recent meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies 
assessing the association between psoriasis and 
malignancy found that there is a modest suggestion of 
an elevated risk of solid malignancies with psoriasis; 
however, it is possible that alcohol and tobacco 
consumption may account for at least some of this 
increased risk. Although there is no clear elevated risk 
of melanoma with psoriasis, non-melanoma skin cancer 
is elevated and may be due in part to PUVA therapy, as 
well as use of systemic immunosuppressants 
cyclosporine and methotrexate. 
No specific measures are required for patients receiving 
brodalumab; standard of care is adequate.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a haematological malignancy resulting from the uncontrolled proliferation of 
monoclonal plasma cells, which leads to production of monoclonal immunoglobulin (known as M-protein) 
with substantial immunosuppression and end-organ damage.  MM is an incurable disease and accounts 
for 10% of all haematological malignancies. The incidence in Europe is 4.5-6/100.000/year with a median 
age at diagnosis between 65 and 70 years. The mortality is 4.1/100.000/year. Almost all patients with MM 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 6/110 
 
 
 
 
 
evolve from an asymptomatic premalignant stage termed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined 
significance (MGUS). In some patients, an intermediate asymptomatic but more advanced pre-malignant 
stage termed smouldering (or indolent) MM can be recognised. 
The course of MM is highly variable, and the clinical behaviour is heterogeneous. Prognostic factors that 
have been identified to be capable of predicting this heterogeneity in survival are: serum 
ß2-microglobulin, albumin, C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase. The International Staging 
System (ISS) relies on the combination of the level of serum ß2-microglobulin and albumin in 3 different 
stages. ISS 3 is associated with the poorest outcome. 
Cytogenetics is also a major prognostic factor. The two genetic abnormalities t(4;14) and deletion(17p) 
are mostly associated with a poorer outcome. Chromosome 1 abnormalities and t(14;16) are also 
adverse prognostic factors. 
Although therapy has improved in the last decade, most patients with MM will ultimately relapse. After the 
introduction of chemotherapy, prognosis improved with a median survival of 24 to 30 months and a 
10-year survival rate of 3%. Although second and later remissions can be achieved with further therapy, 
myeloma typically reappears more aggressively after each relapse, leading to decreased duration of 
response and culminating in treatment-refractory disease with short survival times. With the introduction 
of newer therapies in recent times, median survival has been reported to improve further to 45 to 60 
months from the diagnosis of the disease (National Cancer Institute 2013). 
Treatment should be initiated in patients with active myeloma fulfilling the CRAB criteria, i.e. 
hyperCalcaemia (>11.0 mg/dl), Renal failure (creatinine >2.0 mg/ml), Anaemia (Hb <10 g/dl), and 
active Bone lesions). Other indications for treatment include symptomatic hyperviscosity, recurrent 
bacterial infections, and amyloidosis with organ involvement (McCarthy, Hahn, Hematology, 2013). 
First line treatment options contain at least one of the novel therapies, i.e. proteasome inhibitors and/or 
immunostimulatory drugs, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), if indicated. Depth of 
response after autologous transplantation appears to correlate with the duration of disease control before 
disease progression occurs with the need for salvage therapy.  In Europe, bortezomib, thalidomide (as 
first line treatment) and lenalidomide are approved in combination regimens for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma.   
Relapsed and/or refractory patients typically receive salvage therapy (if possible, this could include a 
(2nd) autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) until relapse or toxicity and then 
go onto the next salvage option. In this setting, bortezomib- and lenalidomide-based regimens are the 
most commonly used in combination with corticosteroids, to which sometimes also an alkylator or an 
anthracycline is added. Despite improvement in PFS and OS for patients with early relapsed MM with 
these agents, 40-60% of patients do not respond to therapy and nearly all relapse after one of these 
regimens. In this setting, for patients who have received at least 2 prior therapies, including bortezomib 
and an IMiD, and have shown relapsed or refractory disease, pomalidomide (in combination with 
dexamethasone) and panobinostat (in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone) are approved 
agents in the EU. The proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone was approved in the EU for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who 
have received at least one prior therapy.  
Elotuzumab is an immunostimulatory humanised, IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the 
human SLAMF7 (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family member 7) protein. SLAMF7 is highly 
expressed on multiple myeloma cells independent of cytogenetic abnormalities. SLAMF7 is also expressed 
on natural killer cells, normal plasma cells, and other immune cells including some T cell subsets, 
Assessment report

Page 7/110 
 
 
 
 
 
monocytes, B cells, and pDCs (plasmacytoid dendritic cells), but is not detected on normal solid tissues or 
haematopoietic stem cells (SmPC, section 5.1). 
Elotuzumab directly activates natural killer cells through both the SLAMF7 pathway and Fc receptors 
enhancing anti-myeloma activity in vitro. Elotuzumab also targets SLAMF7 on myeloma cells and 
facilitates the interaction with natural killer cells to mediate the killing of myeloma cells through 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In nonclinical xenograft models, elotuzumab has 
demonstrated synergistic activity when combined with lenalidomide or bortezomib (SmPC, section 5.1). 
The applicant requested the approval for the following indication: Empliciti is indicated as combination 
therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received one or more prior 
therapies (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is:  
Empliciti is indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
The recommended dose of Empliciti is 10 mg/kg administered intravenously every week (28-day cycle), 
on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for the first two cycles and every 2 weeks thereafter on days 1 and 15. Treatment 
should continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (SmPC, section 4.2). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Elotuzumab is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody, produced in a NS0 mouse myeloma-based cell 
line. It targets Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family 7 (SLAMF7, also known as CS1), a cell 
surface glycoprotein. 
Empliciti is presented as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion consisting of elotuzumab (300 
mg and 400 mg strengths) formulated with a citrate buffer, sucrose and polysorbate 80. The product is 
presented in a Type I glass vial and is administered after reconstitution with water for injections followed 
by dilution with either sodium chloride 0.9% or 5% glucose injection. After reconstitution, each mL of 
concentrate contains 25 mg elotuzumab. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Elotuzumab consists of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the mouse antibody, 
MuLuc63, grafted onto human IgG1 heavy and kappa light chain framework regions.  
The elotuzumab molecule consists of two identical heavy chain subunits and two identical light chain 
subunits. Based on the primary sequence, the intramolecular disulfide linkages of the heavy chain are 
between cysteine residues 22 and 96, 146 and 202, 263 and 323, and 369 and 427. The intramolecular 
disulfide linkages of the light chain are between cysteine residues 23 and 88, and 134 and 194. The heavy 
chain and light chain subunits have a disulfide linkage between heavy chain cysteine residue 222 and light 
chain cysteine residue 214. The two heavy chain subunits have one disulfide linkage between cysteine 
residue 228 of each chain and another disulfide linkage between cysteine residue 231 of each chain. 
Elotuzumab has a consensus site for N-linked glycosylation at asparagine residue 299 of the heavy chain. 
Elotuzumab glycans consist predominantly of complex, core-fucosylated, biantennary structures. 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 8/110 
 
 
 
 
 
Charge variant forms of the elotuzumab heavy chain exist with and without the C-terminal lysine residue. 
The heavy chain lacks a C-terminal lysine, glycine is the terminal residue. 
The predominant molecular isoform has a heavy chain without C-terminal lysine and with the G0F/G0F 
glycoform.  
The relative molecular mass of the predominant molecular isoform of elotuzumab (calculated mass) is 
148.1 kDa (Light chain: 23.4 kDa; Heavy chain: 50.6 kDa). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, 6000 Thomson Road, East Syracuse, New York 13057, USA is responsible for 
manufacturing of the active substance. 
Cell banking 
A two-tiered cell banking system of MCB and WCB was established. Up to now an MCB, two WCBs and an 
end-of-production cell bank (EPCB) have been prepared. Acceptable characterisation results of MCB, WCB 
and end-of-production cell bank were provided. Cell bank testing is performed in accordance with current 
ICH guidelines and sufficient information was provided. A protocol for qualification of future WCBs was 
included in the CTD. 
Viral testing of MCB, WCB and EPCB revealed Type A and Type C retrovirus-like particles detectable by 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, testing of the EPCB with three virus assays showed 
evidence of the presence of xenotropic, amphotropic or mink cell focus (MCF) retrovirus. In accordance 
with ICH Q5A, the Applicant provided results of three unpurified (pre-harvest) and three purified bulk 
(unformulated active substance) lots tested for retrovirus. The pre-harvest lots tested positive for 
retrovirus-like particles, however all three purified lots tested negative.  
Manufacture 
The upstream steps of the elotuzumab manufacturing process are initiated with the thaw of a WCB vial. 
The culture is expanded in a series of shake flasks and a cell bag. A seed bioreactoris inoculated with the 
cell bag bioreactor content which is subsequently expanded. The bioreactor is harvested based on culture 
duration and cell viability, to ensure consistency for downstream processing.  Each bioreactor inoculation 
is a closed operation. 
The primary recovery steps remove cells and cell debris from the production bioreactor contents and 
contribute to the viral inactivation (VI) capacity of the process. Following the neutralisation step a 
detergent VI step is performed to inactivate potential adventitious and endogenous viral agents. 
The detergent-treated viral-inactivated clarified bulk (VI-CB) is transferred to purification for downstream 
processing. 
The VI-CB is processed across a series of chromatography columns. The resulting product pool from the 
final chromatography step is processed through a viral filter to remove potential endogenous and/or 
adventitious viral agents. 
The virus-filtered (VF) product pool is concentrated and buffer exchanged to generate the unformulated 
active substance (UDS). The UDS is diluted to a final protein concentration and formulated with a 
polysorbate 80 solution and filtered into bioprocess containers to make the formulated active substance 
(FDS).  
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 9/110 
 
 
 
 
 
The FDS in bioprocess containers is stored refrigerated until it can be frozen using a liquid nitrogen blast 
freezer for long-term frozen storage. The FDS is shipped frozen to the finished product manufacturing 
facility. 
Process evaluation/validation 
The manufacturing process has been adequately established based on small-scale studies, full scale 
manufacturing lots, and ongoing process verification.  The approach, including decision criteria, have 
been clearly described.  
Impurity clearance studies at small scale and manufacturing scale showed clearance of process and 
product-related impurities.  
Satisfactory process qualification data were submitted for manufacturing scale lots.  
Sufficient validation data were provided regarding sanitisation of columns and filters. 
Manufacturing process development 
The current process is labelled Process D. It differs from process C1 mainly with regard to addition of a 
detergent viral inactivation step at the end of the upstream process and two reprocessing steps at the end 
of the downstream process. Material from four subsequent processes has been used in two comparability 
exercises: process B and C material was compared to Process C1 material, and Process C1 material to 
Process D material. Process B and C material was manufactured in a different facility than the process C1 
and D material (current facility). In addition, there are scale other differences between the different 
processes. Clinical studies relevant for the current marketing authorisation application have used 
predominantly Process C and C1 material. Analytical comparability was shown for active substance 
manufactured with the four different processes.  
Extensive manufacturing process development data were provided, including a number of multivariate 
studies (Design of Experiments (DoE) studies, response surface models (RSM)). Origin of in-process 
controls (IPCs) from these and other studies is sufficiently explained. In general the multivariate studies 
did not detect significant risks to the Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs), probably due to pre-existing 
knowledge with regard to optimal manufacturing conditions. Sufficient information was provided 
regarding the use of DoE and to justify proposed critical IPCs based on a conventional assessment 
approach.  
Control System 
Proposed critical IPCs are clearly reviewed and justified by data presented in the developmental and other 
studies. 
Characterisation 
Active substance from the process performance qualification campaign was used in the characterisation 
studies. Data were provided regarding physicochemical properties, primary structure, secondary 
structure, higher order structure, biological activity, and post-translational modifications.   
The primary structure of elotuzumab is consistent with that predicted by the cDNA. Variants in primary 
structure were detected on both the heavy and light chains. Higher order structural characterisation 
indicates the presence of low levels of HMW and trace level of low-molecular weight (LMW). 
The structural modifications that affect the overall charge profile of elotuzumab  have been adequately 
characterised. Correlations between biological activity and specific charge variants were established by 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 10/110 
 
 
 
 
 
analysis of variants isolated. Results demonstrated an understanding of species that have reduced or 
increased activity.  
The predominant glycosylation forms have been identified and characterised.. Two glycans account for 
the majority of glycoforms present within elotuzumab. Minor glycoform species were suitably identified. 
Sufficient characterisation data were provided to substantiate an understanding of the species that have 
decreased biological activities.  
Forced degradation studies revealed the major degradation pathways for elotuzumab.  
Reference standards  
Three different research reference standards were used during development and the current primary 
reference standard (PRS) and working reference standard (WRS) have been  described. Preparation, 
storage conditions, acceptance criteria for qualification of PRS and WRS are described and comparative 
testing results of all reference standards are reported. Stability testing is also described. Criteria for 
qualification of future reference standards have been provided. 
Container Closure system 
Container closure integrity testing studies were provided, with satisfactory results. 
Extractables/leachables studies identified no extractables or leachables at levels which could represent a 
hazard to the patient.  
Specification 
The release and shelf life specification for elotuzumab active substance is considered acceptable. 
It is noted that most analytical methods and associated quantitative limits also apply to the finished 
product.  
The Applicant submitted extensive method descriptions, which are fairly complete and allow independent 
assessment. The proposed analytical methods were supported by adequate validation data. 
In general, the Applicant proposes a fairly straightforward set of tests, which is commonly accepted for 
monoclonal antibodies. Deletion of tests for potential process-related impurities (which were performed 
during development) was sufficiently justified.  
Justifications for the proposed specification were provided and are based on a sufficient number of 
batches. A statistical approach (tolerance intervals) was used to define the acceptable ranges. 
Stability 
Registration stability studies were conducted on three batches of elotuzumab active substance in 
accordance with ICH stability guidance, and were aimed to demonstrate that the active substance is 
stable up to 36 months when stored at the recommended condition of <-35°C (-40°C ±5°C). All batches 
were made at the intended commercial manufacturing facility, at the intended commercial manufacturing 
scale, and are representative of the quality of material used in clinical and non-clinical studies. These 
three batches were manufactured according to the commercial manufacturing process . In addition, 
stability studies have been conducted on supportive batches of elotuzumab active substance, 
demonstrating the stability of the active substance at -40°C. Samples were stored in containers 
representative of the commercial storage bioprocess containers, and were assessed by the acceptance 
criteria in the proposed active substance specification. 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 11/110 
 
 
 
 
 
In the real time methods no detectable degradation occurs, which is not surprising in view of the frozen 
storage condition. At accelerated and stressed conditions, minor changes could be discerned.  
Accelerated (5°C) stability studies were conducted through 6 months. Under the stress storage condition 
at 25°C/40%RH or 25°C/60%RH, similar but greater changes were observed, consistent with what is 
expected for a therapeutic protein. Room temperature/room light studies showed elotuzumab is 
susceptible to degradation from exposure to ambient light, and should be protected from light. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
The Applicant presented a summary of the quality characteristics for elotuzumab for injection that were 
considered to guide the commercial formulation and process development work. 
Empliciti is presented as powder for concentrate for solution for infusion consisting of elotuzumab 
formulated with a citrate buffer, sucrose and polysorbate 80. The product is presented in a Type I glass 
vial and is administered after reconstitution with water for injections followed by dilution with either 
sodium chloride 0.9% or 5% glucose injection. After reconstitution, each mL of concentrate contains 25 
mg elotuzumab. Two strengths of lyophilised finished product, 400 mg/vial and 300 mg/vial, have been 
developed for commercialisation. The pack size for each strength is one vial. 
The entire Empliciti infusion should be administered with an infusion set and a sterile, non-pyrogenic, 
low-protein-binding filter (with a pore size of 0.2-1.2 µm) using an automated infusion pump. 
The container closure system was chosen based on protection, compatibility, safety, and performance to 
ensure the quality of the finished product throughout its shelf life. Elotuzumab for injection, 300 mg and 
400 mg presentations, are packaged in a 20-cc Type I flint glass vial, stoppered with a 20-mm film-coated 
butyl lyophilisation rubber stopper, and sealed with a 20-mm aluminum crimp seal with Flip-Off button. In 
addition to the primary package, the commercial packaging system for both presentations includes a 
paperboard folding carton. 
Evolution of the finished product formulation during development was adequately described in the 
dossier. The 300 and 400 mg presentations are identical.  
The Applicant studied compatibility of elotuzumab/Empliciti with a number of common infusion materials 
(including in-line filters). In the same study design, stability after reconstitution/dilution was studied.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Bristol-Myers Squibb S.r.l., Loc. Fontana del Ceraso, Frosinone, 03012, Anagni, Italy is the manufacturer 
responsible for EU batch release. 
The manufacturing process for elotuzumab for injection includes conventional steps for aseptic filling, 
lyophilisation and stoppering and has been deemed acceptable. 
The commercial manufacturing process was adequately validated. 
Product specification 
The release and shelf life specification for the finished product have been deemed acceptable. The only 
difference between the 300 mg and 400 strength presentations is the fill volume, so the acceptance 
criteria differ only for the “Drug Content” method. 
Non-compendial methods for use in release and/or stability testing of elotuzumab finished product are the 
same as those for the active substance; reference is made to the active substance section for description 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 12/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and validation of these methods. The omission of tests has been adequately justified for parameters that 
will not change due to formulation-fill-freeze-drying.  
Furthermore, appropriate pharmaceutical tests were included (e.g. particulate matter; water content). 
The choice of tests is deemed sufficiently justified.  
The limits/acceptance criteria of the  tests are compendial or otherwise sufficiently justified. 
Stability of the product 
The shelf life for the finished product (unopened vial) is 3 years at 2-8°C protected from light. 
Appropriate batches from the commercial process were included in the stability studies, and this is 
deemed acceptable. 
Although the amount of available data for the 300 mg/vial presentation is limited, it is agreed that the 
shelf life for the 400 mg/vial can be extrapolated to the 300 mg/vial, based on the identical formulation 
and strength, and based on the accelerated data. 
In addition, data from photostability and freeze-thaw studies were provided and do not give rise to 
specific comments or concerns.  
Chemical and physical in-use stability of the reconstituted and diluted solution has been demonstrated for 
24 hours at 2-8°C and protected from light. 
From a microbiological point of view, the solution for infusion should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would 
normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2-8°C protected from light. The reconstituted or diluted solution 
should not be frozen. The solution for infusion may be stored for a maximum of 8 hours of the total 24 
hours at 20-25°C and room light. This 8 hour period should be inclusive of the product administration 
period. 
Adventitious agents 
The elotuzumab active substance manufacturing process includes measures to prevent introduction of 
potential adventitious agents:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Procedures and controls for the sourcing and quality of cell culture and purification raw materials; 
Testing of cell banks (MCB, WCB, EPCB) for sterility, mycoplasma, MVM, and endogenous and 
potential adventitious viral agents; 
Testing for bioburden, endotoxin, Mycoplasma, and in vitro adventitious viral agents of the 
pre-harvest samples from each production batch;  
Inclusion of orthogonal viral clearance steps in the manufacturing process. 
In order to minimise the risk of BSE/TSE, no raw materials of animal origin are used in the 
Elotuzumab manufacturing process, which includes all steps and processing beginning from the 
designated master cell bank. 
Retroviral like particles (type A and C) were detected in three batches of unprocessed (pre-harvest) bulk. 
Three batches of purified bulk material (unformulated active substance) were shown to test negative for 
retroviruses, in accordance with ICH Q5A.  
Four orthogonal steps of the Elotuzumab manufacturing process were evaluated for their ability to 
remove or inactivate model viruses: 
- Viral inactivation by detergent; 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 13/110 
 
 
 
 
 
- Viral inactivation by low pH; 
- Anion exchange (AEX) chromatography; 
- Viral filtration;  
The viral clearance studies were performed using a panel of model viruses with a wide range of 
physicochemical characteristics. In response to questions, full study reports were provided, confirming 
these conclusions.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
No major issue was identified during the procedure. Some of the concerns addressed by the Applicant are 
described below. 
Active substance 
A summary of the WCB manufacturing process and characterisation tests for qualification of future WCBs 
is provided. However, no protocol with description of manufacture and testing acceptance criteria for 
replacement of WCB was initially provided. In response to a question, a protocol for qualification of future 
WCBs was included. 
In response to a question about conflicting results from a reverse transcriptase (RT) assay in relation to 
C-type retroviruses, the Applicant committed to evaluate alternate assays that may provide greater 
specificity and/or to provide additional data to support continued use of the fluorescent PCR-based RT 
(F-PBRT) assay. The Applicant is recommended to provide an update on the outcome of this evaluation 
once additional data and information are available. 
Proposed critical in-process controls (IPCs) for the active substance are clearly reviewed and justified by 
data present in the developmental and other studies. However, the control strategy initially proposed was 
not considered acceptable, since the relevance and the purpose of multivariate design of experiments 
(DoE) studies was not fully clear, and since ranges studied in the DoEs were narrow. Therefore, the 
robustness of these steps could not be assessed and sufficient control of the downstream process was 
therefore not substantiated. 
In addition, for two CQAs no critical IPCs or active substance release limits have been defined. It was 
proposed to upgrade non-critical IPCs for these CQAs to critical IPCs.  
The Applicant was asked to address several points regarding qualification of scale-down models, 
management of DoE studies and process parameter criticality definition. Sufficient information was 
provided to resolve uncertainties regarding the use of DoE and to justify proposed critical IPCs based on 
a conventional assessment approach. Questions about the control system were sufficiently addressed by 
including a number of additional critical IPCs. 
For a potential process-related impurities eluting from two chromatography resins, insufficient data was 
provided to substantiate how safe levels are guaranteed. In their responses, the Applicant provided 
adequate data to address these issues. The Applicant is recommended to implement a new IPC for this 
process-related impurity. 
The Applicant was asked to provide sanitisation validation for columns and filters. This issue was 
sufficiently resolved by data provided in response to this question in combination with sanitisation data 
presented in vendor studies and viral sanitisation data presented in the viral clearance studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 14/110 
 
 
 
 
 
The facility design and operating procedures in place are adequate for the control of bioburden and 
endotoxin in the active substance was considered justified. Nevertheless, it is recommended that at the 
first future routine GMP inspection, control of bioburden is specifically inspected. 
Criteria for qualification of future reference standards were provided.  
In general, the Applicant submitted extensive method descriptions, which are fairly complete and allow 
independent assessment. A number of deficiencies were identified in relation to the method descriptions, 
system suitability criteria, validations, and the associated specification limits. These issues were 
appropriately addressed. 
The stability studies and data sufficiently support the claimed shelf life of 36 months at ≤ -35°C, and 
protected from light.  
The cell-based potency assay was not performed for all time points in accelerated and stressed stability 
studies and for the final time points (24 to 36 months) for the long-term stability study. The Applicant is 
recommended to put under long-term stability the first three commercial batches of the active substance. 
The initial time point should correspond to the release time, and all the assays should be performed 
according the stability plan and in compliance to the frequency of testing indicated by the ICH Q1A-R2 
guideline. Since the same approach was also adopted for the finished product, the same commitment 
applies for the finished product long-term stability study. Any out-of-specification should be reported to 
the competent Authority. 
Finished product 
In relation to the manufacturing process of the finished product, an appropriate overview of the defined 
critical steps, intermediates, CPPs, IPCs, and hold times was given. Appropriate justification was provided 
based on the manufacturing process development.  
The Applicant studied compatibility of elotuzumab/Empliciti with a number of common infusion materials 
(including in-line filters). In the same study design, stability after reconstitution/dilution was studied. 
Although the study suffered from limitations due to the bracketing/matrixing design which tries to 
address several real-life factors concomitantly, the Applicant further explained the approach and justified 
that although the order of conditions in the study is different compared to the SmPC advice, all conditions 
have been studied. Therefore, the provided data and additional justification sufficiently support the SmPC 
claim. It was considered that there was little gain in requesting additional studies.  
In relation to the use of an in-line filter for administration of the product, the Applicant explained that 
although there is no compelling product quality consideration requiring the mandatory use of an in-line 
filter at the point of patient administration, the use of an in-line filter should be stated in the SmPC for the 
following reasons: 
- All clinical administration of elotuzumab infusions have been conducted using an in-line filter at the point 
of patient administration; 
- To mitigate the potential risk of patient exposure from extraneous particles and fibers that may be 
introduced during handling and infusion preparation with the lyophile, an in-line filter with a pore size of 
0.2 μm to 1.2 μm should be used. 
The Applicant’s justification that the use of an in-line filter for administration of the product is necessary 
was accepted.

Adventitious agents safety 
The Applicant was asked to provide the full reports of the virus clearance studies summarised in module 
3.2.A.2.2 in order to allow an independent assessment. The studies were provided, allowing full 
assessment of viral safety issues.  
According to ICH Q5A absence of detectable virus should be confirmed in at least 3 lots of purified bulk. 
In response to questions, the Applicant provided viral testing results of three batches of unprocessed 
(pre-harvest) bulk and of three batches of purified bulk material (unformulated active substance). No 
detectable virus was found in the purified bulk lots. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Empliciti is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved monoclonal 
antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological documentation comply 
with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance are adequately 
described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard to its 
physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described 
and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
The overall Quality of Empliciti is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. However, several quality Recommendations on Quality aspects, have been made. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended several points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Due to the lack of species-specific cross-reactivity, no relevant animal species or valid transgenic mouse 
models were identified in which to conduct the nonclinical toxicology studies. Given this limitation, the 
nonclinical safety program consisted primarily of in vitro safety studies utilizing human cells and tissues 
(a study of haemolytic potential in human blood, and a human tissue cross-reactivity study with a 
comprehensive panel of human tissues) and limited in vivo animal studies (including a local tolerance 
study in rabbits in compliance with GLP regulations). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Elotuzumab (HuLuc63) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human SLAMF7, a signalling 
molecule abundantly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma (MM) cells. The ability of Elotuzumab 
to bind SLAMF7 was assessed in comparison with the originator mouse monoclonal antibody Luc63 by 
plasmon resonance (Study Report RTR5). Both antibodies were immobilized on chips and challenged by 
BIAcore to analyse the binding with solutions containing two different dimeric forms of human SLAMF7-Fc 
at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 512 nM. The originator and humanized antibody showed a very 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 16/110 
 
 
 
 
 
similar binding profile with a Kd of 42.4 and 43.7 nM for the murine and human antibody, respectively, 
using as binding moiety the chimeric form with human Fc and 28.5 nM and 28.9 nM using that with mouse 
Fc. 
The binding of HuLuc63 and MuLuc63 to peripheral blood leukocyte subsets was assessed by flow 
cytometry (Study Report RTR8). The humanized antibody, assessed at saturating concentration of 
10µg/mL, bound almost all NK and NKT cells and a high percentage of CD8+ T cells. A smaller and variable 
percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD14+ monocytes was also recognized whereas binding to B 
lymphocytes (CD20+/HLA DR+) and granulocytes was negligible. 
Evaluation of HuLuc63 binding to peripheral blood and bone marrow cells from 7 MM patients by flow 
cytometry showed that the antibody stained most of plasma cells, NK, NKT and CD8+T cells and at a lower 
extent CD4+ T cells. The antibody did not bind to hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+) obtained by 
cytoapheresis in 3 MM and 7 lymphoma patients with the exception of one lymphoma patient who had 
been repeatedly stimulated with G-CSF due to resistance to peripheralization of stem cells (Study Report 
RTR9).  
A cross-reactivity study with nonhuman primate whole blood was conducted to evaluate the binding of 
elotuzumab to various leukocytes in blood samples from healthy chimpanzees and cynomolgus and 
rhesus monkeys (Study RTR21). Elotuzumab exhibited no binding to NK, NKT, CD8+ T cells, or 
monocytes in blood samples from chimpanzees, rhesus, or cynomolgus monkeys; no binding to CD4+ T 
cells from chimpanzees was observed (binding to CD4+ T cells was not conducted in rhesus or 
cynomolgus monkeys). Binding of elotuzumab to B cells was detected in blood samples from cynomolgus 
and rhesus monkeys, but not from chimpanzee. The observed binding of elotuzumab to cynomolgus and 
rhesus monkey B cells was highly variable between animals and was likely nonspecific, as elotuzumab 
does not bind directly to recombinant SLAMF7 from either of these species when expressed in 
heterologous cell transfectants.  
A cross-reactivity study with recombinant SLAMF7 protein was conducted to determine the 
cross-reactivity of elotuzumab for nonhuman primate SLAMF7 including chimpanzee, cynomolgus, and 
rhesus monkey (Study RTR18). The study results indicated that elotuzumab specifically bound only to 
human SLAMF7 and did not recognize recombinant SLAMF7 from any of the nonhuman primate species 
evaluated, as assessed by binding either to purified Fc fusion proteins in an ELISA or to full-length SLAMF7 
on the surface of living cells (e.g. transfected cell lines) using flow cytometry.  
The binding of the originator murine antibody MuLuc63 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (Study 
Report RTR10) using normal human tissues (heart, liver, lung, kidney, colon, duodenum, ileum, stomach, 
lymph node, spleen, tonsil, cerebrum, cerebellum, spinal cord, trigeminal ganglion, dorsal root ganglion, 
vagus nerve, aorta, adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, parathyroid, cervix, ovary, uterus, mammary 
gland, testes, prostate, ureter, bladder and urethra). In most cases the antibody stained leukocytes that 
were also positive for CD138, a plasma cell marker. In some organs such as liver and nervous ganglia a 
positive staining for CD138-negative leukocytes was observed. Binding to plasmacytoma cells was 
showed by immunohistochemistry with the same murine antibody in tissue sample of MM patients (Study 
Report RTR11). A cross-reactivity study in human and nonhuman tissues was conducted using 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Study RTR12).  The nonhuman species that were evaluated included the 
cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys, mini-pig, dog, rabbit, rat, and mouse. Overall, no elotuzumab staining 
was detected in any of the nonhuman tissues tested (mainly spleen, tonsil, colon and brain). These data 
indicated the lack of cross-species reactivity of elotuzumab for nonhuman species and that none of the 
species examined were relevant for toxicology evaluation. Elotuzumab-specific cell-surface staining was 
observed in the mononuclear cells of human tonsil, spleen, lymph node, colon and trigeminal ganglion. No 
staining was detected in the human cerebrum, cerebellum, spinal cord, or the dorsal root ganglion.

Efficacy in inducing an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was assessed by measuring the 
release of LDH in co-cultures of L-363 cells, the human plasma-cell line positive for SLAM7 used as the 
target, with peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from either 11 healthy donors or 23 multiple 
myeloma patients in the presence of HuLuc63 at concentrations ranging from 1 ng/mL to 10 µg/mL 
(Study Report RTR16). In all the samples a dose-dependent increase of LDH-release was observed with 
HuLuc63 as compared to a control antibody. Healthy and myeloma subjects did not significantly differ 
when the effects were compared to a single concentration (1 µg/mL). No correlation was found between 
magnitude of cytotoxicity and the frequency of NK cells in the sample. 
Similarly HuLuc63 mediated  ADCC in a 51chromium release assay performed using L363 and OPM2 
plasmacytoma cells  as targets and healthy donor PBMC as effectors (Study Report RTR13). 
SLAM7-negative epithelial cell lines, were not sensitive to by HuLuc63 and PBMC exposure until 
transfection with human SLAM7, thus showing the specificity of antibody-mediated killing. Depleting 
PBMC of B, T lymphocytes or monocytes did not reduce antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, whereas 
depletion of NK cells significantly reduced either ADCC or antibody-independent cellular cytotoxicity. No 
complement-mediated cytotoxicity was observed up to 100 µg/mL. 
After comparison of two anti-SLAM7 mouse antibodies for in vivo anti-tumour activity against neoplastic 
plasma cells, MuLuc63 was selected for further development being significantly more potent than b 
MuLuc90 in a subcutaneous xenograft model in immunodeficient mice inoculated with L363 cells when 
administered by i.p. at 10 mg/kg thrice a week for three weeks, with 5 out of 8 animals showing no 
tumour at the end of the experiment.  Different doses with the same schedule, 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 10 
mg/kg of MuLuc63 were tested in the same model and whereas the highest dose induced tumour 
eradication in 8 out of 9 mice the other two doses were less effective with 5 and 1 out of 9 animals free 
of tumour at the end of the experiment with 5 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. Similar results were obtained 
when OPM2 cells were used to induce subcutaneous tumours, however in this case the lower dose (5 
mg/kg) caused regression of the tumour in all the animals, whereas 10 mg/kg in 6 out of 9. The efficacy 
of the humanized antibody was also compared with the originator antibody in vivo in the two animal 
models precedently used. The antibodies were administered i.p. at 10 mg/kg twice a week for 7 doses. 
Data obtained from the L363 model revealed that MuLuc63 was significantly more potent than HuLuc63 
in reducing tumour growth, whereas in the OPM2 model both antibodies showed similar efficacy in terms 
of tumour growth in responding mice, even if MuLuc63 eradicated the tumour in 8 out of 9 animals and 
HuLuc63 in 5 out of nine. 
Higher doses of HuLuc63, 15 and 20 mg/kg, did not increase efficacy in the L363 model. Since these 
antibodies showed a similar affinity for the ligand, the different potency has been attributed to the 
difference in the Fc portion which is murine IgG2a for MuLuc63 and human IgG1 for HuLuc63 (Study 
Report RTR14).  
A PK/PD study using the OPM2 model assessed the effect of increasing doses (0.1, 0.5, 1.5 and 10 mg/kg) 
of HuLuc63 i.p. administered every 3 days for a total of 7 administrations(Study Report RTR15).Serum 
levels of the antibody were assessed by a validated ELISA assay. A dose-dependent inhibition of tumour 
growth was observed, with the exception of 0.1 mg/kg dose. Antibody serum levels revealed no antitumor 
effect with concentration below 2 µg/mL, whereas the highest dose showed antibody serum concentration 
in the range 70-430 µg/mL. 
HuLuc63 was also tested in combination with other anti-tumour agents. Using the OPM2 model, HuLuc63 
at a suboptimal dose (1 mg/kg twice a week for 5 weeks) in combination with bortezomib, a proteosome 
inhibitor widely used in the treatment of MM, showed to be more efficacious as compared to HuLuc63 and 
bortezomib used alone (Study Report RTR26). 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 18/110 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, using the same model, HuLuc63 at 0.5 mg/kg dose given twice a week for 7 administrations, 
enhanced the effect of pomalidomide at 5 mg/kg, a dose inducing about 60% inhibition of tumour growth 
in single treatment. Elotuzumab in combination with both pomalidomide and dexamethasone increased 
the efficacy compared to single treatments. In addition, the combination of elotuzumab with 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone (5 mg/kg) showed a greater efficacy as compared to the single use or 
the combination of elotuzumab and pomalidomide or dexamethasone (Study Report IO00047). 
Study DP-5348 evaluated the effect of elotuzumab in combination with lilirumab, an anti-human natural 
killer cell inhibitory receptors KIR2DL monoclonal antibody, in a MM xenograft model induced in 
immunodeficient RAG-1KO mice transgenic for human KIR2DL3. OPM-2 cells were injected 
subcutaneously in matrigel, starting from 10 days after cell injection, when the tumour reached about 50 
mm3 elotuzumab was administered by i.p. at 0.5 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg twice a week for 7 administrations. 
The highest dose induced a decrease of tumour volume in 7 out of 9 mice whereas the lower in 3 out of 
8. Also survival of the mice was increased compared to controls. In combination with lilirumab (i.v. at day 
11 and 24), the frequency of response increased to 7 out of 10 and also survival was prolonged supporting 
the involvement  of NK cells, conserved in RAG-1KO mice, however in an experiment with NK cell 
depletion the antitumour effect of elotuzuamb was only partially reduced. When the treatment was 
started later (day 17 from cell inoculation) tumour growth was only reduced, with a higher efficacy when 
used in combination with lilirumab; consistently also survival was prolonged.  
The antitumour activity in the OPM2 model of HuLuc63 given as a single administration at a dose from 
about 0.5 to 5 mg/kg was enhanced by the combination with an anti-mouse CD137 activating antibody, 
which is able to increase NK-mediated ADCC and is not active per se in this model. In particular doses of 
about 0.5 and 5 mg/kg induced complete regression of the tumour in 7 out of 8 and 6 out of 8 mice, 
respectively (Study Report OPM-2). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
To support the pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies, ELISA methods were used to quantify 
elotuzumab in SCID mouse and rhesus monkey serum (non-GLP studies). Serum ELISA methods for both 
matrices were developed at PDL Biopharma, Inc (Fremont, California). A validated ELISA method was 
used for the analysis of SCID mouse serum, while a qualified ELISA method was used to analyze rhesus 
monkey serum. The results for the standard curve (well fitted to the regression model) and the analytical 
QCs indicated that the assay methods were precise and accurate for the analysis of elotuzumab in these 
studies. Analysis for ADA was not performed for these studies.  
The pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab was studied following repeat-dose IP administration in an OPM2 
xenograft mouse model as part of a dose-ranging study to examine the relationship between circulating 
drug concentrations and biological activity (study TR06011). Following IP administration once every 3 
days for a total of 7 doses, a dose-response relationship was shown as average serum concentrations of 
elotuzumab increased as dose increased from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. Maximal anti-tumor activity was reached 
at mean elotuzumab serum concentrations of 70 to 430 µg/mL (low to high concentration range at the 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 19/110 
 
 
 
 
 
10-mg/kg dose) and minimal biological activity was seen at 2 to 13 µg/mL (low to high concentration 
range at the 0.5-mg/kg dose). 
In study RTR15 mice bearing OPM2 tumors were randomized to different treatment groups when their 
tumors reached an average size of 83 mm3 (range: 45–146 mm3); the treatment groups consisted of 
treatment with HuLuc63  at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg. The control group received isotype 
control antibody (HuPr1_SB1161_98071) at 10 mg/kg. Dosing was once every 3 days for a total of 7 
doses. Blood was collected at 8 hours after the first dose (C1 max), immediately before the second dose 
(C1 min), immediately before the 7th dose (C6 min), 8 hours after the last dose (C7 max), and one 
dose-interval after the last dose (terminal bleed).  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
An exploratory single-dose IV infusion toxicokinetic and tolerability study of elotuzumab was conducted to 
evaluate potential off-target toxicity in rhesus monkeys (Study TR07150) for a period of 45 days.

In this study, elotuzumab was administered via continuous IV infusion over 30 minutes to 3 groups of 
rhesus monkeys (1 monkey/sex/group) at doses of 0, 30, or 100 mg/kg. Single IV administration of 
elotuzumab at dose levels of 30 or 100 mg/kg (≤ AUC[INF] range of 335 to 447 mg•h/mL) were well 
tolerated. All monkeys survived to scheduled sacrifice. There were no elotuzumab-related effects on 
clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, clinical pathology, immunophenotyping, organ 
weights, or macroscopic and microscopic evaluations. Systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) to elotuzumab 
increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner, with no sex-related differences. The high dose 
of 100 mg/kg corresponds to exposures of approximately 8× above that observed in humans at the 
recommended dose of 10 mg/kg (AUC[INF] of 49,482 µg•h/mL after the first dose).

Toxicokinetic parameters were analysed in an exploratory nonGLP single-dose study in rhesus monkeys 
(Study TR07150 described under single toxicology section). Following a single IV dose in rhesus monkeys, 
the increase in systemic exposure to elotuzumab was dose proportional between 30 and 100 mg/kg, and 
was similar in males and females. The area under the serum concentration-time curve extrapolated to 
infinity [AUC(INF)] was 118 and 194 mg•h/mL at 30 mg/kg, and 335 and 447 mg•h/mL at 100 mg/kg. 
The initial volume of distribution after a single dose of elotuzumab in rhesus monkeys was low (46.3 to 
61.5 mL/kg). Also, consistent with the slow clearance of antibodies, total serum clearance ranged from 
0.155 to 0.299 mL/h/kg and the apparent elimination half-life (T-HALF) was 8 to 14.8 days. Analysis for 
ADA was not performed. 
Local Tolerance 
The local tolerance of elotuzumab was assessed in a single-dose IV study in rabbits (Study TR06050). 
Elotuzumab was administered at 5 mg/mL into the right marginal ear vein, with an injection rate of 1 
mL/minute. No irritation or local tolerance issues were observed at this concentration and injection rate 
that were comparable to those recommended for human use (maximum concentration of 6.6 mg/mL and 
infusion rate ≤ 2 mL/minute). Additionally, there were no unscheduled deaths and all animals appeared 
clinically normal at all observation periods. Evaluation of body weight and food consumption, and 
macroscopic and microscopic assessments did not reveal any elotuzumab-related effects. 
Other toxicity studies 
A methods qualification study using normal human tissues, chimpanzee and rhesus monkey tissues was 
conducted to qualify assay conditions for tissue cross-reactivity studies with elotuzumab (Study 
TR06052). A precomplexing method was shown to be specific, sensitive, and reproducible for 
immunohistochemical staining with HuLuc63 in human cross-reactivity studies. Appropriate positive and 
negative control tissues were identified. Two concentrations (10 and 3 µg/mL) of elotuzumab were 
selected for staining in a subsequent human tissue crossreactivity study with a comprehensive panel of 
human tissues. 
A definitive cross-reactivity study of elotuzumab with normal human tissues was conducted to evaluate a 
comprehensive panel of approximately 36 tissues from 3 different donors for elotuzumab reactivity 
(Study TR06051). Elotuzumab showed reactivity with cell membranes and/or cytoplasm of variable 
numbers of plasma cells and/or immunoblasts (B-lineage cells in the process of differentiating into 
plasma cells) in multiple tissues including bone marrow, breast, gastrointestinal tract (colon [large 
intestine], esophagus, small intestine, stomach), liver, lymph node, fallopian tube (oviduct), pancreas, 
salivary gland, spleen, thymus, thyroid, tonsil, ureter, uterus (body [endometrium], cervix). Staining of 
the plasma cells and immunoblasts was expected as the epitope (SLAMF7) recognized by elotuzumab is 
expressed on these cells. There was no specific cross-reactivity with any other tissue element in any of 
the human tissues examined. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA was submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The primary pharmacodynamics of elotuzumab has been extensively studied. The mode of action of 
elotuzumab specifically related to its capacity of binding to SLAMF7, and the physiological diversity of the 
effects of SLAMF7 governs the diversity of the pharmacodynamic effects of elotuzumab. Elotuzumab was 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015

developed as a humanized mAb (IgG1) that targets SLAMF7, a cell surface glycoprotein for which 
expression is restricted to malignant myeloma cells and subsets of normal leukocytes in humans (NK 
cells, NKT cells, a subset of CD8+ T cells, and plasma cells). The primary mechanism of action of 
elotuzumab is NK-mediated ADCC of Malignant Myeloma cells. Elotuzumab mediated ADCC was both NK 
cell- and CD16-dependent. SLAMF7 is also a regulator of NK cell function. Binding of elotuzumab to 
SLAMF7 on NK cells directly activates these immune cells and enhances their anti-myeloma activity in 
vitro. Elotuzumab is inhibitory to lymphocytes because of other downstream molecules i.e. SHIP-1 and 
the protein phosphatase receptor CD45. 
Lack of SLAMF7 in cells prevented to observe any effect of elotuzumab, which is an important observation 
in respect to species selection for safety testing.  
The antitumour activity of elotuzumab has been clearly shown in vitro and in vivo. In vivo elotuzumab 
induced eradication of tumours in a number of mice, indicating its usefulness in this respect. Remarkably 
that this is true for mouse studies with human xenografts, indicating that the SLAMF7-mediated 
stimulation of NK-cell activity (not possible with mouse NK-cells) is not essential for the full activity of 
elotuzumab. 
No secondary pharmacodynamic and pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted due to 
the absence of adequate animal models.  SLAMF7 is a protein important for cell-cell interaction in the 
lymphoid system.  
Binding to SLAMF7 by elotuzumab is therefore not expected to have effects on CNS parameters or 
cardiovascular functioning. The absence of specific safety pharmacology studies is therefore acceptable. 
A repeat-dose range-finding study in OPM2 tumor-bearing SCID mice receiving elotuzumab once every 3 
days for a total of 7 doses showed that, in general, mean serum elotuzumab concentrations increased 
with repeated dosing, indicating accumulation of elotuzumab over the dosing period. In addition, average 
serum concentrations of elotuzumab increased as dose increased from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg. The 
relationship between circulating drug concentrations and biological activity of elotuzumab in the OPM2 
xenograft mouse model suggests that maximal anti-tumor activity is reached at mean elotuzumab serum 
concentrations of 70 to 430 µg/mL (range of serum concentrations at the 10-mg/kg dose) and minimal 
biological activity is seen at 2 to 13 µg/mL (range of serum concentrations at the 0.5-mg/kg dose). The 
applicant gives high weight to this study, and applies this range of serum concentrations also to the 
human situation. From another study in mice, however, it is clear that the Fc-binding and ADCC properties 
cannot be translated quantitatively to the human situation.  
A series of comparative species qualification (binding) studies was conducted to support species selection 
for toxicology studies. Interestingly, although the amino acid sequence of the SLAMF7 protein is highly 
conserved among primate species (human sequence is 98%, 90%, and 89% identical to that of 
chimpanzee, cynomolgus, and rhesus monkey, respectively), the comprehensive binding analyses 
revealed that elotuzumab does not bind SLAMF7 of nonhuman primates, or other nonclinical species 
including mouse, rat, rabbit, mini-pig, and dog.  The applicant has tried to overcome the lack of an animal 
species by making a transgenic mouse with SLAMF7. Therefore transgenic mice expressing human 
SLAMF7 were generated to explore an alternative approach for the nonclinical safety evaluation of 
elotuzumab. However, the mouse characterization results indicated that the human SLAMF7 transgenic 
mouse was not a valid alternative animal model for toxicology testing due to a lack of human SLAMF7 
expression in both resting and activated T cells in this mouse model as compared to humans. 
As in clinical practice elotuzumab will be given in addition to small molecules such as immunomodulatory 
drugs or proteasome inhibitors, combination studies was an important contribution in the primary

pharmacodynamics. With respect to bortezomib and lenalidomide, a synergy with elotuzumab has been 
shown.  
Despite the knowledge that rhesus monkeys are not a responsive animal species, the applicant has 
conducted a pharmacokinetic study in rhesus monkeys. Following an IV infusion in these monkeys, the 
single-dose toxicokinetic was characterized by a low initial volume of distribution and clearance and a long 
T-1/2. Increases in systemic exposure to elotuzumab in rhesus monkeys were dose proportional between 
30 and 100 mg/kg, and exposure was similar between males and females. Although these results have a 
potential value for the interpretation of this toxicity study, they are not relevant for humans.  
ADAs were not analyzed in either the mouse study or the monkey study, as it was not deemed pertinent 
to the interpretation of the results.  
In accordance with relevant guideline (Guidance for Industry, S6(R1): Addendum to preclinical safety 
evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals) no metabolism, tissue distribution, or excretion 
studies with elotuzumab have been conducted in animals. The expected in vivo degradation of mAbs is to 
small peptides and amino acids via biochemical pathways that are independent of drug metabolizing 
enzymes, such as CYP enzymes, so no drug-drug interactions are anticipated. 
Elotuzumab only recognizes human SLAMF7 protein. Because elotuzumab does not recognize non-human 
forms of SLAMF7 protein, in vivo safety data from animal studies are irrelevant. In the same line, no 
carcinogenicity data are available for elotuzumab in animals, nor were fertility and embryo foetal toxicity 
studies performed. Non clinical safety information primarily consists of limited in vitro human cell/tissue 
studies where no safety findings were identified. (SmPC section 5.3). 
As elotuzumab is an IgG1 mAb and this subtype is known to be transported across the human placental 
barrier through interactions with the FcRn receptor, elotuzumab does have the potential for direct fetal 
exposure, especially at late stages of pregnancy. Although the potential impact of elotuzumab on fetal 
development has not been evaluated, the lack of notable developmental effects in SLAMF7-deficient mice 
suggested that inhibition of SLAMF7 via elotuzumab may not result in developmental toxicity. 
There is no human experience with elotuzumab during pregnancy. Elotuzumab will be given in 
combination with lenalidomide, which is contraindicated during pregnancy. No animal data are present 
regarding the effect on reproductive toxicity because of the lack of an adequate animal model. Empliciti 
should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential, unless the clinical condition 
of the woman requires treatment with elotuzumab. Women of childbearing potential should use effective 
contraception (SmPC section 4.6). 
Male patients must use effective contraception measures during and for 180 days following treatment if 
their partner is pregnant or of childbearing potential and not using effective contraception (SmPC section 
4.6). 
The Summary of Product Characteristics for all medicinal products used in combination with Empliciti 
must be consulted before starting therapy. When Empliciti is used with lenalidomide there is a risk of 
foetal harm, including severe life-threatening human birth defects associated with these agents and the 
need to follow requirements regarding pregnancy avoidance, including testing and contraception. 
Lenalidomide is present in the blood and sperm of patients receiving the medicine. Refer to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics for requirements regarding contraception due to presence and transmission in 
sperm and for additional detail. Patients receiving Empliciti in combination with lenalidomide should 
adhere to the pregnancy prevention programme of lenalidomide (SmPC section 4.6).

Elotuzumab is not expected to be excreted into human milk. Elotuzumab will be given in combination with 
lenalidomide and breast feeding should be stopped because of the use of lenalidomide (SmPC section 
4.6). 
Studies to evaluate the effect of elotuzumab on fertility have not been performed. Thus, the effect of 
elotuzumab on male and female fertility is unknown (SmPC section 4.6). 
An exploratory single-dose IV infusion toxicokinetic and tolerability study of elotuzumab in rhesus 
monkeys provided evidence that there is no potential off-target toxicity in monkeys. As expected, there 
were no elotuzumab-related effects in monkeys at IV doses ≤ 100 mg/kg (AUC range of 335 to 447 
mg•h/mL), indicating the absence of elotuzumab-related off-target effects. 
The data using human tissue indicated that binding of elotuzumab is restricted to expected sites based 
upon presence of SLAMF7. Elotuzumab showed reactivity with cell membranes and/or cytoplasm of 
variable numbers of plasma cells and/or immunoblasts in multiple human tissues.  
The justification provided by the Applicant for not performing environmental risk assessment studies was 
considered acceptable since elotuzumab is a protein composed of natural amino acids therefore, unlikely 
to result in significant risk to the environment. This is in accordance with the “Guideline on Environmental 
Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Elotuzumab has been well characterized in a series of nonclinical pharmacology studies, while 
pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic, and toxicologic studies were limited due to the binding properties to the 
SLAMF7 antigen which is strictly human specific and the non-feasibility of a transgenic animal model 
expressing this human antigen in T-cells. The relevant information has been included in the SmPC 
(sections 4.6, 5.1 and 5.3). Clinical trials data were therefore an important source of information to 
support the safety in patients.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of elotuzumab was studied in patients with multiple myeloma (SmPC, section 
5.2). Results of pharmacokinetics (PK) of elotuzumab are currently available for monotherapy, in 
combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, in combination with bortezomib (and dexamethasone if 
added at the end of Cycle 2 or 3), or in combination with bortezomib/dexamethasone (Table 3). Single 
dose pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab was investigated in 4 studies (HuLuc63-1701, HuLuc63-1702, 
CA204005 and CA204007) after the administration of the first IV infusion. Multiple-dose 
pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab was investigated for the dose regimen of every 10 days and every 14 
days. The effects of renal impairment on PK of elutuzumab was also investigated (CA204007).

PK data from clinical studies CA204004, CA204005, CA204007, and CA204011 were used for population 
pharmacokinetics (pop-pk) model. The model was refined with additional PK data from study CA204009.  
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of elotuzumab were mainly studied in clinical studies HuLuc63-1701 
and HuLuc63-1702 in terms of Cmax, AUC, Vss, CL and T1/2.

Absorption 
No bioavailability studies were performed.  
Elotuzumab is dosed via intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely bioavailable 
(SmPC, section 5.2). 
Distribution 
The Volume of distribution of elotuzumab has been estimated in MM patients in study HuLuc63-1701, 
HuLuc63-1702 and study CA204007 with a dose in range of 0.5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg.  
Mean volume of distribution of elotuzumab ranged from 36 mL/kg to 70 mL/kg (2.3-4.6 L for a typical 
patient) and was independent from the dose in a dose range of 0.5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg (SmPC, section 
5.2). 
The metabolic pathway of elotuzumab has not been characterized. As an IgG monoclonal antibody, 
elotuzumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways 
(SmPC, section 5.2). 
Elimination 
Elimination of elotuzumab was investigated following the first dose (single) in the first cycle of the 
treatment in study HuLuc63-1701, HuLuc63-1702 and CA204007.  
In study HuLuc63-1701, average of total clearance of elotuzumab decreased from 0.80 to 0.22 mL/h/kg 
with an increase in dose from 0.5 to 20 mg/kg. Terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2) appeared to increase 
from 2.1 to 7.8 days along with the increase of dose from 0.5 to 20 mg/kg.  
In study HuLuc63-1702, total clearance of elotuzumab decreased from 0.54 to 0.20 mL/h/kg with an 
increase in dose from 2.5 to 20 mg/kg. Terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2) appeared to increase from 4.1 
to 7.7 days along with the increase of dose from 2.5 to 20 mg/kg.  
Terminal half-life in Studies HuLuc63-1701 and HuLuc63-1702 (110 and 140 h [4.6 and 5.8 days], 
respectively) was shorter than in study CA204007 (204 h [8.5 days]) likely because the PK sampling 
period was shorter in studies HuLuc63-1701 and -1702, (336 h and 240 h, respectively) compared to 
study CA204007, where the sampling period was over 672 h.   
Following a single dose of 10 mg/kg, the elotuzumab clearance was 13.2 mL/day/kg. Elotuzumab exhibits 
nonlinear pharmacokinetics with clearance of elotuzumab decreasing from 17.5 to 5.8 mL/day/kg with an 
increase in dose from 0.5 to 20 mg/kg, suggesting target-mediated clearance, resulting in greater than 
proportional increases in Area under the Concentration time curve (AUC). Upon discontinuation of 
elotuzumab in the combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, concentrations of elotuzumab will 
decrease to approximately 3% (approximately 97% washout as estimated by 5 half-lives) of the 
population predicted steady state maximal serum concentration by 3 months (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab is nonlinear, due to binding to the target. Dose proportionality was 
investigated in study HuLuc63-1701 and HuLuc63-1702. In study HuLuc63-1701, following 
administration of the first dose, Cmax increased in a dose proportional manner across the dose range of 0.5 
to 20 mg/kg. Mean estimates of AUC(TAU) and AUC(INF) increased greater than proportionally with dose 
over the dose range of 0.5 to 20 mg/kg with estimated slopes of 1.277 (95% confidence interval of 1.159 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 30/110 
 
 
 
 
 
to 1.399) and 1.328 (95% confidence interval of 1.129 to 1.524), respectively. In study 1702, for both 
Cycle 1 and Cycle 4, the increase in Cmax and AUC appeared to be more than the increment in dose from 
2.5 to 20 mg/kg. . The more than dose-proportional increase in AUC was consistent with the 
dose-dependent decrease in total clearance (CLT) and increase in T-HALF values in the lower dose range. 
The decrease in total clearance is expected to be predominantly influenced by the saturation of 
target-mediated elimination of elotuzumab in lower doses. Under steady-state conditions, elotuzumab 
clearance was driven by elimination of elotuzumab only from the central compartment. Nevertheless, 
only dose of 10 mg/kg is proposed for elotuzumab, therefore dose proportionality is not relevant for 
efficacy and safety. 
In study HuLu63-1703 (concomitant with lenalidomide and dexamethasone), PK data was available from 
101 subjects (N = 3, 39, and 59 for the 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg dose groups, respectively). Elotuzumab was 
administered weekly for the first 8 weeks (2 cycles) followed by every two weeks administration.  Due to 
the different regimens applied in treatment cycles, Cmin of elotuzumab in combination with 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone increased in the initial 8 weeks (i.e. first 2 cycles, once weekly dose), and 
then decreased (Week 8 to Week 12) and reached steady state from Week 12 because elotuzumab is 
administered once for every two weeks after the first 2 cycles. Over the study periods, no notable increase 
in Cmin was observed.  
The effect of disease status on pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab has been investigated in PPK analysis. PK 
of elotuzumab was not influenced by ECOG score, LDH or albumin. The PPK analysis showed that for 
patients in the highest quartile of baseline serum M-protein concentrations (3.2-7.7 g/dL), CavgSS, 
CmaxSS, and CminSS were > 30% lower (CminSS = 46% decrease) than the corresponding exposure 
values for patients in the lowest quartile of serum M-protein. 
Special populations 
Based on a population PK analysis using data from 375 patients, the clearance of elotuzumab increased 
with increasing body weight supporting a weight-based dose. The population PK analysis suggested that 
the following factors had no clinically important effect on the clearance of elotuzumab: age (37 to 88 
years), gender, race, baseline LDH, albumin, renal impairment, and mild hepatic impairment (SmPC 
section 5.2). ). No study in children has been conducted, as multiple myeloma is not expected to occur in 
children.   
An open-label study (Study CA204007) evaluated the pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab in combination 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma with varying degrees of renal 
impairment (classified using the CrCL values). The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of 
elotuzumab was evaluated in patients with normal renal function (CrCl > 90 mL/min; n = 8), severe renal 
impairment not requiring dialysis (CrCl <30 mL/min; n = 9), or end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis 
(CrCl < 30 mL/min; n = 9). No clinically important differences in the pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab 
were found between patients with severe renal impairment (with and without dialysis) and patients with 
normal renal function (SmPC sections 4.2, 5.2). 
Empliciti is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, which is principally cleared by catabolism. Thus, hepatic 
functional impairment is not likely to alter its clearance. The effect of hepatic impairment on the clearance 
of Empliciti was evaluated by population PK analyses in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin [TB] ≤ the upper limit of normal [ULN] and AST > ULN or TB < 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST; 
n = 33). No clinically important differences in the clearance of Empliciti were found between patients with 
mild hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function. Elotuzumab has not been studied in 
patients with moderate (TB > 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST) or severe hepatic impairment (TB > 3 
times ULN and any AST) (SmPC sections 4.2, 5.2).

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No in vitro or in vivo studies on pharmacokinetic drug interactions have been submitted. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Regarding immunogenicity, elotuzumab exposure in ADA positive patients was lower and is likely 
confounded by baseline M-protein levels.  Development of antibodies started early in elotuzumab 
treatment was transient and resolved by 2 to 4 months. Clearance appeared to return to baseline at later 
time points when ADAs were no longer detected. The causal relationship between higher M-protein level 
and it’s impact on efficacy and safety of elotuzumab could not be fully established. Further data regarding 
immunogenicity is in the Pharmacodynamics section.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of elotuzumab shows that NK cell-mediated ADCC (antibody dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity) is a major component to the activity observed in vitro. 
Elotuzumab directly activates natural killer cells through both the SLAMF7 pathway and Fc receptors 
enhancing anti-myeloma activity in vitro. Elotuzumab also targets SLAMF7 on myeloma cells and 
facilitates the interaction with natural killer cells to mediate the killing of myeloma cells through 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No clinical pharmacodynamic studies were submitted and clinical PD data were obtained from clinical 
efficacy and safety studies performed in patients with multiple myeloma (studies HuLuc63-1701;  
HuLuc63-1702; HuLuc63-1703; CA204004; CA204004; CA204011). 
Pharmacodynamic assessments included percent saturation (receptor occupancy, RO) of SLAMF7, 
temporal changes in SLAMF7 expression in peripheral blood and bone marrow, temporal changes in T, B, 
and NK cells during the first course of treatment, temporal changes in cytokines/chemokines/ growth 
factors, baseline soluble SLAMF7 (sSLAMF7), and association of cell counts for major immune subsets and 
SLAMF7 expression in relation to clinical response as defined by EBMT criteria. 
SLAMF7 receptor occupancy  
The relationships between serum concentrations of elotuzumab and SLAMF7 RO on peripheral blood NK 
cells and bone marrow NK cells, as well as antigen rich CD45dim CD38+ and CD45dim CD138+ plasma 
cells was analysed in phase 1 elotuzumab monotherapy study HuLuc63-1701. In addition, the percentage 
RO of SLAMF7 by elotuzumab on CD38+ plasma cells versus elotuzumab serum concentrations is 
analysed in phase 1 study HuLuc63-1702 (elotuzumab + bortezomib) and phase 2 study HuLuc63-1703 
(elotuzumab + lenalidomide/dexamethasone). All three clinical studies showed that more than 80% of 
SLAMF7 receptors were occupied when serum concentrations of elotuzumab reached between 10 to 100 
μg/mL. In Study HuLuc63-1701, it was shown that at day 56 after a dose of 10.0 mg/kg, 100% 
occupation of SLAMF7 binding sites on peripheral blood NK cells and bone marrow NK cells, as well as on 
antigen rich CD45dimCD38+ and CD45dimCD138+ plasma cells was reached in all except one 
measurement in one individual. 
Temporal changes in NK, T, B and SLAMF7+ NK Cells and Total Lymphocytes 
In Study HuLuc63-1701 a transient decrease in natural killer (NK) cells, CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, B cells, 
total lymphocytes, and SLAMF7+ NK cells was observed following the first dose of elotuzumab; whereas 
changes post fourth dose on Day 42 by comparison were modest. Results in studies HuLuc63-1702 and 
HuLuc63-1703 were similar to Study HuLuc63-1701. Changes in NK cell subsets were also observed on 
Day 22 (C2D1) and Day 29 (C2D1) in Study CA204011; however, no further assessment was conducted 
beyond Day 29. In study CA204009 (E-Bd), there was a general decline in total NK cells after initial doses 
of therapy observed at C2D1 for both groups. NK cells recovered to near baseline levels by the end of 
therapy in Study CA204009. The transient reduction in cell counts after the initial dose was associated 
with a transient increase in IP-10, a chemokine that stimulates migration of activated T cells and NK cells. 
There was no evidence of lymphocyte decreases associated with repeated dosing of elotuzumab in vivo.

Temporal changes in cytokines, chemokines and growth factors 
In vitro: of the 22 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors evaluated, only two, monocyte chemotactic 
protein 1 (MCP-1) and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), were significantly elevated by 
elotuzumab treatment in the majority of the donor samples. Eight additional cytokines, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, 
IL-12(p40), IFNγ, MIP-1α, RANTES, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), were statistically increased 
by elotuzumab treatment; however these elevations were observed in a minority of donors tested and/or 
the concentration increases were relatively low (less than 100 pg/mL) in the elotuzumab-treated 
samples. Nine cytokines, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-3, IL-4, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, eotaxin, and GM-CSF, were 
not impacted by elotuzumab in the whole blood assay, and three cytokines, IL-5, IL-7, and IL-10, were 
not detected in any sample. 
Since elotuzumab has the propensity to cause the release of cytokines in whole blood cultures in vitro, 
temporal changes in cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were investigated in 3 phase 1 studies in 
vivo (HuLuc63-1701, HuLuc63-1702 and HuLuc63-1703). Most individuals showed an increase in three 
analytes: TNF-α, IP-10, and MCP-1 after initial elotuzumab administration and there was a trend for levels 
to return to baseline by Day 7. After subsequent elotuzumab doses, only some individuals showed an 
increase in the level of these cytokines, with the magnitude of response generally lower than that 
observed after the first dose. 
Other analytes, interleukin 1α (IL-1α), IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, Fractalkine, granulocyte/macrophage 
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP- 1α), and MIP-1ß, 
showed a similar pattern to what was observed for TNF-α, IP-10, and MCP-1. Results in studies 
HuLuc63-17024 and HuLuc63-17033 were similar to Study HuLuc63-170184. 
Soluble serum protein assessments 
Phase 1 studies HuLuc63-1701 and HuLuc63-1702 showed that a majority of patients (>67%) had 
measurable sSLAMF7 in serum at baseline. In Phase 2 study HuLuc63-1703 no relationship was observed 
between sSLAMF7 levels in serum at baseline and a patient’s best overall response/PFS/tumor stage/ MM 
risk assessment as determined by individual cytogenetic analysis/ or serum M-protein levels at study 
entry. In Phase 2 study CA204011 both cohorts (10 and 20 mg/kg) showed similar and significant relative 
increase in total sSLAMF7 at C2D1, with Cohort 2 (10 mg/kg) showing a greater absolute increase in 
absolute sSLAMF7. 
Association of cell count/ cell function and clinical response 
In Phase 1 study HuLuc63-1701, no association was observed between baseline lymphocyte cell counts 
and subsequent diagnosis of “Stable Disease” at any visit up to nominal Day 56 of the first treatment 
cycle. Likewise, a relationship between Stable Disease and elotuzumab monotherapy treatment was not 
observed for NK, CD4+ T, B, monocytes, and CD8+ T cell counts, although this phase 1 dose escalation 
study was not powered to determine efficacy. 
In study HuLuc63-1702, there was no meaningful correlation between cytotoxicity of the PBMC samples 
and clinical response. 
In Phase 2 study CA204011, there was no meaningful association between the percentage of baseline 
CD56dim cells in bone marrow and objective response (minor [minimal] response or better) based on an 
analysis on all treated subjects. The results were not consistent, when examining the association between 
objective response and CD56dim cells in bone marrow for Cohort 1 (20 mg/kg; parameter estimate of 
0.166) or Cohort 2 (10 mg/kg; parameter estimate of - 0.109) thereby making interpretation 
inconclusive.

Association of SLAMF7 expression and clinical response 
In study HuLuc63-1701 individual patients were ranked according to the percentage of plasma cells that 
stained positive for SLAMF7 expression in bone marrow at baseline and subsequent best clinical response 
in the first treatment cycle (between Days 0 and 56). The median percentage SLAMF7 expression was 
81% (n=17) in patients with stable disease, and 80% (n=15) with progressive disease, although ranges 
were very wide in both groups.  
In study HuLuc63-1703 no relationship between SLAMF7 expression on plasma cells present in bone 
marrow aspirates at baseline and clinical response as defined by IMWG criteria or PFS was observed. 
In vitro ADCC and Lymphocyte Subsets Depletion Studies 
In order to confirm that elotuzumab would show anti-tumor activity at the concentrations identified in in 
vitro SLAMF7 receptor occupancy studies, ADCC of elotuzumab was investigated in several studies. In one 
study, the results showed that elotuzumab (10 µg/mL) induced specific myeloma-cell lysis in multiple 
assays using purified NK cells from healthy allogeneic donors or autologous NK cells from multiple 
myeloma donors as effectors. Similar results were obtained in another study using peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) as effectors. In this study, maximum lysis of tumor cells was observed at 0.1 
µg /mL. However, some patient MM cells required elotuzumab concentrations as high as 100 µg /mL to 
inhibit proliferation and survival in the presence of BMSCs. 
Depletion studies were carried out using whole blood samples from healthy donors. Samples were tested 
for depletion of T, NK, B, and memory B cells at elotuzumab concentration of 100 or 200 µg /mL. The 
results indicated no apparent effect of elotuzumab on total lymphocytes, T-, and B-cell counts and a 
modest effect on NK cells (20% decrease).  
On in vitro challenge with elotuzumab in whole blood cultures from healthy donors, the increase in some 
cytokines may be lower or absent compared to that seen in the blood of subjects who have received 
elotuzumab. 
Integrated analyses of the elotuzumab assessments for immunogenicity were performed for studies 
CA204004, CA204005, CA204007, and CA204009. Out of 390 elotuzumab-treated subjects across these 
studies, 9 subjects (2.3%) were ADA-positive at baseline, 72 subjects (18.5%) were ADA-positive 
on-study, and 318 subjects (81.5%) were ADA-negative. Of the 72 ADA-positive subjects, 2 subjects 
developed persistent ADA response (both were also neutralizing). NAbs were only characterized in Study 
CA204004 and it was found that 19 of 299 subjects in CA204004 trial had NAbs.  Neutralizing antibodies 
for majority of the 19 subjects in study CA204004 developed during their 1st ADA assessment post 
elotuzumab administration, and were resolved by the 2nd ADA assessment. Also, only 3 of these 19 
subjects were NAb-positive at more than 1 visit beyond their 2nd ADA assessment visit. Progression for 
most of these subjects occurred much later relative to the detection of ADA or NAbs.  
In study CA204004, infusion reactions or hypersensitivity reactions following elotuzumab treatment were 
assessed. One-hundred and sixteen (116) subjects, when treated with E-Ld, with baseline and at least 
one post-baseline ADA assessment, experienced hypersensitivity or infusion reactions and 21 (18.1%) 
and 95 (81.9%) of these subjects were ADA-positive and ADA-negative, respectively. Of these 116 
subjects with infusion or hypersensitivity reactions, 10 were NAb-positive subjects. In comparison, 88 
subjects in the control arm experienced hypersensitivity. None of the subjects in the control arm had 
infusion reactions. ADAs in these subjects, and in general for IgGs don’t occur until Day 21-28 after the 
administration of first dose of IgG, therefore a clear temporal or causal relationship to occurrence of ADAs 
and IRs cannot be established based on this limited data.

No clear association can be established between presence of ADA and loss of efficacy. The ORR in 
NAb-positive subjects was 78.9% (15 out of 19 subjects) compared to the overall ORR for the study, 
78.5% (252 out of 321 subjects). In addition, the effect of immunogenicity on PFS was tested by adding 
categorical covariate ADA (equal to 1 for subjects with at least one positive ADA observation including 
baseline and equal to 0 otherwise) to the final E-R PFS model. Immunogenicity was found to not be 
statistically significant on the risk for disease progression. 
In CA204009, of the 77 randomized subjects, 72 elotuzumab-treated subjects had evaluable ADA data at 
baseline and post baseline. Two subjects (2.8%) were ADA-positive at baseline, 20 subjects (27.8%) 
were ADA-positive on-study, and 52 subjects (72.2%) were ADA negative. Of the 20 ADA-positive 
subjects, 0 subjects developed persistent ADA.  
In study CA204011 elotuzumab monotherapy, 29 subjects had evaluable data but samples were not 
assayed for NAb. In the 20 mg/kg cohort, 7 of 14 subjects had positive immunogenicity samples of which 
2 were ADA persistent. In the 10 mg/kg cohort, 5 out of 15 subjects had on study positive immunogenicity 
samples and 1 of the 5 had ADA persistent response. The safety profiles of the 3 persistent positive 
subjects were not clinically different than those seen in ADA negative subjects. There were no acute 
infusion reactions, hypersensitivity events, new or additional AEs observed in these 3 subjects. Some of 
the subjects with an ADA-positive response had lower measured elotuzumab Cmin concentrations on 
days with ADA positive response. The ADA titers decreased and cleared in all but 4 subjects. There were 
no safety concerns among subjects with positive immunogenicity responses.  
Overview of Effect of Elotuzumab on ECG Parameters 
The effects of elotuzumab treatment on the ECG parameters, as well as AEs potentially related to ECG 
intervals, was assessed in elotuzumab-treated subjects from Phase 2 Study CA204011, which was a 
monotherapy study, and Phase 3 Study CA204004, which was in combination with 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone, who consented to participate in the ECG sub-study. 
Results of the ECG analysis indicate that elotuzumab, at both dose levels of 10 and 20 mg/kg, does not 
have a clinically meaningful effect on ECG intervals, including QTc interval.  
Study CA204011 (elotuzumab monotherapy) 
QTcF interval 
In study CA204011, no subject had a QTcF interval >480 msec or a ΔQTcF >60 msec across both dose 
levels. Few subjects had QTcF intervals or ΔQTcF intervals that exceeded the pre-specified ranges (QTcF 
> 450 msec; ΔQTcF > 30 msec) considered borderline or prolonged. Five subjects (2 in Cohort 1 [20 
mg/kg] and 3 in Cohort 2 [10 mg/kg]) had a QTcF between > 450 to ≤ 480 msec. Three subjects in Cohort 
2 had a ΔQTcF between > 30 to ≤ 60 msec. 
PR interval: Four subjects in Cohort 1 (20 mg/kg) had values between > 200 to ≤ 220 msec and 3 subjects 
(2 subjects in  Cohort 1 and 1 subject in Cohort 2 [10 mg/kg]), had a PR interval >220 msec.  
PR interval change from baseline ≥ 25% was seen in 1 subject in Cohort 1. 
QRS interval: Six subjects (2 subjects in Cohort 1 [20 mg/kg] and 4 subjects in Cohort 2 [10 mg/kg]) had 
QRS values >110 msec. One subject in Cohort 2 had a QRS interval change from baseline ≥ 25%. 
Heart rate: 14 subjects (6 in Cohort 1, 8 in Cohort 2) had values ≥ 90 bpm and none had a HR ≤ 50 bpm. 
Concentration - Response Relationship 
There was no significant relationship between QTcF change from baseline and elotuzumab concentration. 
Moreover, the upper limit of the 90% CI for mean change in QTcF was less than 10 msec over the range 
of observed elotuzumab concentrations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 36/110 
 
 
 
 
 
Three subjects had AEs that could potentially be related to ECG findings. One subject each had an AE of 
palpitation, tachycardia or syncope after treatment with 20 mg/kg elotuzumab. 
Study CA204004 
The effects of elotuzumab on ECG parameters, including QTc intervals were evaluated in 
elotuzumab-treated subjects who consented to participate in the ECG sub-study in Study CA204004. 
The change in QTcF and ΔQTcF intervals post-infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Day 22 of Cycle 2 was < 
10 msec compared to pre-dose values. On these Days, ΔQTcF intervals were associated with a large 
degree of variability (range -22.3 to 56.0 msec). Both QTcF and ΔQTcF values at predose (prior to 
elotuzumab infusion) on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1, Day 22 of Cycle 2, and Day 1 of Cycle 3 were somewhat 
prolonged compared to the -1.0 Hour (prior to pre-medication) or baseline value. However, elotuzumab 
infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Day 22 of Cycle 2 did not appreciably prolong the QTc interval further. 
The PR and QRS intervals were largely unchanged during the study, as was HR. 
A formal categorical analysis was not done for this ECG sub-study due to the small number of participating 
subjects. Overall, no subject had a QTcF interval > 480 msec and no subject had a ΔQTcF > 60 msec 
during the study. Five subjects had ΔQTcF values ≥30 msec. Few subjects had a PR interval > 200 msec 
or a QRS interval > 110 msec during the study. No subject had a ΔPR or ΔQRS > 25% compared to 
baseline. 
No subject that participated in the ECG sub-study had an AE that was thought to be potentially related to 
an abnormal ECG finding. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab is quite comparable with other monoclonal antibodies. The 
volume of distribution of elotuzumab approximately equals vascular space (3-6 L for a typical patient), 
consistent with the expected low distribution of mAbs. Also the observed clearance (13.2 mL/day/kg) and 
long elimination half-life (6-8 days) of elotuzumab were comparable with other chimeric IgG antibodies. 
The pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab is nonlinear due to binding of elotuzumab to the target. Due to 
depletion of the target upon treatment, steady-state clearance was driven by elimination of elotuzumab 
only from the central compartment. Only dose regimen of 10 mg/kg is proposed for the treatment of 
elotuzumab, thus dose proportionality is not relevant for efficacy and safety.  
A reduction of 10% (from 100% to 90%) of patients reaching the target level after 8 weeks of treatment 
of elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone was due to the switching of dosing 
regimen from elotuzumab 10 mg/kg every week (QW) in Cycles 1 and 2 to every 2 weeks (Q2W) after 
Cycle 2. The 70 µg/ml target concentration was based on preclinical xenograft multiple myeloma mouse 
model, and it is more appropriate to discuss the clinical consequence of the 10% based on the 
exposure-response analysis for PFS. The justification for the absence of a causal relationship between 
elotuzumab exposure and efficacy (i.e. the risk of disease progression is confounded by baseline serum 
M-protein levels) by the applicant is acceptable. 
For patients in the highest quartile of baseline serum M-protein concentrations (3.2-7.7 g/dL), CavgSS, 
CmaxSS, and CminSS were > 30% lower (CminSS = 46% decrease) than the corresponding exposure 
values for patients in the lowest quartile of serum M-protein. As PFS decreased along with the increase of 
M protein level and similar decrease of PFS was also observed in control group (without Empliciti), it is 
agreed that the clinical outcome (e.g. PFS) of the treatment of elotuzumab in combination with 
lenalidomide is largely dependent on the disease status (e.g. baseline M-protein). Therefore, an impact of 
a decrease in CminSS on efficacy cannot be concluded. In addition, increasing dose of elotuzumab (from 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 37/110 
 
 
 
 
 
10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg) did not improve the PFS in Study HuLuc63-1703.  Drug exposure level in patients 
with the body weight > 99.8 kg did not differ from patients with lower body weight. Further, the safety 
profile (Study HuLuc63-1703) in patients treated with elotuzumab 20 mg/kg was similar with the patient 
with elotuzumab dose of 10 mg/kg, indicating that elotuzumab appears tolerable at doubled exposures. 
Therefore, risk of overexposure in obese patients was not anticipated.   
Empliciti may be detected in the serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum immunofixation assays 
of myeloma patients and could interfere with correct assessment of the response classification. The 
presence of elotuzumab in patient's serum may cause a small peak in the early gamma region on SPEP 
that is IgGƙ on serum immunofixation. This interference can impact the determination of complete 
response and possibly relapse from complete response in patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein. In 
case of detection of additional peaks on serum immunofixation, the possibility of a biclonal gammopathy 
should be excluded. (SmPC section 4.5). 
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity to Empliciti. Of 390 patients 
across four clinical studies who were treated with Empliciti and evaluable for the presence of anti-product 
antibodies, 72 patients (18.5%) tested positive for treatment-emergent anti product antibodies by an 
electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 19 of 299 patients in 
study CA204004. In the majority of patients, immunogenicity occurred early in treatment and was 
transient resolving by 2 to 4 months. There was no clear causal evidence of altered pharmacokinetic, 
efficacy, or toxicity profiles with anti-product antibody development based on the population 
pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses (SmPC section 4.8). 
There was no elotuzumab dose or concentration-related effects on ECG intervals, including QTc interval, 
over the concentrations resulting from the investigated elotuzumab doses. In Study CA204011 
(elotuzumab monotherapy) one subject each had an AE of palpitation, tachycardia or syncope after 
treatment with 20 mg/kg elotuzumab. Of the AEs in three subjects that might potentially be related to 
ECG findings, a causal relationship seems unlikely as a temporal relationship between the AE and ECG 
changes was not apparent. No subjects that participated in the Study CA204004 ECG sub-study had an AE 
that was thought to be potentially related to an abnormal ECG finding. 
No effect of elotuzumab in combination with Ld or as a single agent was seen on QTc prolongation or AEs 
potentially related to ECG intervals. No data is available on changes of QTc interval or changes in ECGs for 
patients treated with E-Bd. 
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of elotuzumab has been investigated to a 
reasonable extent. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Dose finding 
Clinical dose finding was performed in study HuLuc63-1703 for the combination E-Ld and in study  
HuLuc63-1702 for the combination E-Bd. The proposed dose of 10mg/kg as intravenous infusion until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity is based on these two studies.

Study HuLuc63-1703: Elotuzumab + Ld 
Study HuLuc63-1703 was a phase 1b/2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study. Objectives of this 
study were to identify the MTD of elotuzumab (phase 1 part) and to investigate its safety and efficacy 
when combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed MM (phase 2 part). 
In study HuLuc63 1703 (phase 1 part) elotuzumab was administered IV using escalating dose of 5, 10, or 
20 mg/kg in combination with Ld. Elotuzumab schedule was modified from Q2W, as used in the previous 
monotherapy study, to a more intensive weekly administration for the first two 28-day cycles, in order to 
rapidly reach SLAMF7 saturation and targeted minimum elotuzumab concentration. The E-Ld combination 
was generally well tolerated and showed durable response rates. No MTD was observed up to the 
maximum dose of 20 mg/kg and the objective response rate (ORR) was 82%. 
In the Phase 2 part of study HuLuc63-1703, subjects were randomized to receive elotuzumab 10 mg/kg 
or 20 mg/kg in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone. The E-Ld administration schedule was 
similar to the Phase 1 part of the study. E-Ld confirmed to be generally well tolerated and no apparent 
differences in the safety profile were observed between the 2 dose groups. A retrospective statistical 
analysis indicated no statistical evidence of treatment differences between the 10 mg/kg vs 20 mg/kg 
regimen in terms of ORR and progression-free survival (PFS). Furthermore, based on exposure-response 
(E-R) analyses, no definite conclusion could be drawn that higher steady-state exposure leads to a 
reduction in hazard for disease progression, indicating that both 10 and 20 mg/kg doses achieved 
maximum possible efficacy. Since both efficacy and safety were generally comparable be-tween the 2 
doses, the 10 mg/kg dose was carried forward to the phase 3 study and proposed for the E-Ld 
combination. 
Table 5. Efficacy Parameters in Phase 2 Study HuLuc63-1703 (Phase 2 part) 
Study HuLuc63-1702: Elotuzumab + Bd 
Study HuLuc63-1702 was a phase 1/2, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study investigating the 
MTD of elotuzumab and its safety and efficacy when combined with bortezomib. 
Phase 1 study HuLuc63-1702 tested IV elotuzumab in combination with bortezomib. Subjects with 
relapsed/refractory MM were treated with escalating dose of 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg of elotuzumab on 
Days 1 and 11 in 21-day. The combination of elotuzumab and bortezomib was generally well tolerated: 
MTD was not reached up to the maximum planned dose of 20 mg/kg and the safety profile did not appear 
to be dose dependent. While data were limited, subjects dosed with 10 or 20 mg/kg showed ≥ 80% 
saturation of SLAMF7 receptors when corresponding target drug levels were ≥ 100 μg/mL. From the 
efficacy point of view, all efficacy parameters were numerically higher for the 10 mg/kg dose compared to 
the other doses. The 10 mg/Kg dose was therefore chosen for the phase II study CA204009 which 
investigated the combination of elotuzumab with the standard of care regimen of 
bortezomib/dexamethasone (E-Bd) in subjects with relapsed MM. The selected elotuzumab 
administration schedule was based on the schedule previously used in the phase 1 Study HuLuc63-1702, 
modified in order to more closely match the schedule employed with E-Ld in phase 3 Study CA204004 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 39/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(i.e. elotuzumab weekly administration in cycles 1 and 2). The combination E-Bd was overall well 
tolerated and no meaningful increase in AEs was observed. Therefore, the 10mg/kg dose and the 
administration schedule used in study CA204009 was proposed for the E-Bd combination. 
Table 6Efficacy Parameters in Study HuLuc63-1702 
Across the dose response studies, dose escalation up to 20 mg/kg (range: 2.5-20 mg/kg) was achieved 
without reaching a maximum tolerated dose. Efficacy at an elotuzumab dose of 20 mg/kg appears to be 
less than with 10 mg/kg. Based on saturation of SLAMF7, PK of elotuzumab, the safety/efficacy profile, 
and FDA feedback, the 10 mg/kg elotuzumab dose was selected for further clinical development. 
Saturation of elotuzumab binding may explain lack of increasing efficacy with increasing dose, but 
especially for the combination E-Bd this must be interpreted with caution as there were only 3 subjects in 
each of the other dose cohorts and 18 subjects in the 20 mg/kg cohort. Overall, these data do support not 
using an elotuzumab dose higher than 10 mg/kg. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study CA204004 
This was a phase 3, randomized, open-label trial investigating the combination of elotuzumab with 
lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone (E-Ld) versus lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone 
alone (Ld) in subjects with previously treated relapsed or refractory MM.

Figure 1. Study Schema (Study CA204004) 
Elotuzumab was administered intravenously (IV) at a dose of 10 mg/kg weekly (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of 
a 4-week cycle) of the first 2 cycles and every 2 weeks (Day 1 and Day 15) thereafter. No dose reduction 
was allowed for elotuzumab. 
Lenalidomide was administered daily at a dose of 25 mg PO on Days 1-21 at least 2 hours after completion 
of elotuzumab. Lenalidomide dose adjustments were handled according to current medical practice. 
Dexamethasone was administered weekly at a dose of 40 mg PO. During weeks of elotuzumab 
administration, dexamethasone was administered as a split dose of 28 mg PO + 8 mg IV 3 to 24 hours and 
at least 45 minutes, respectively, prior to elotuzumab infusion. IV dexamethasone was increased to 10 
mg in case of previous grade 2 infusion reactions during the administration of elotuzumab, or 18 mg for 
subjects with grade 3 or recurrent grade 2 infusion reactions. To prevent imbalance in dexamethasone 
exposure between the two arms in the study, on the weeks that subjects received premedication with 18 
mg IV dexamethasone, they only received a total of 16 mg oral dexamethasone.  
In addition to IV dexamethasone, to prevent infusion reactions (IR) the following premedication regimen 
was administered 30 - 90 minutes prior to any elotuzumab dose: 
• H1 blocker: diphenhydramine (25 - 50 mg PO or IV) or equivalent 
• H2 blocker: ranitidine (50 mg IV) or equivalent 
• acetaminophen (650 - 1000 mg PO). 
If prior infusion reactions occurred, subjects received H1, H2 blockers and acetaminophen at maximum 
doses specified (i.e., 50 mg diphenhydramine, 50 mg ranitidine, and 1000 mg acetaminophen).

Subjects were also required to receive thromboembolic prophylaxis (e.g., aspirin, low molecular weight 
heparin, and vitamin K antagonists), per institutional guidelines. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the progression free survival (PFS) and objective 
response rate (ORR) of E- Ld versus Ld alone. 
Secondary objectives included the comparison of overall survival (OS) between the two treatment arms 
and the evaluation of the change from baseline of the mean score of pain severity and pain interference 
using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) of E-Ld versus Ld. 
Exploratory objectives included the assessment of safety in each arm; Time to tumour response (TTR) 
and duration of response (DOR); PFS rates at 1, 2 and 3 years; OS rates at 3, 4, 5 and 6 years; Health 
related quality of life (HrQoL) outcomes (EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-MY20 and BPI-SF, the 
measurement of serum concentrations of elotuzumab in the presence of lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone and the evaluation of the immunogenicity of elotuzumab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first 
documented tumour progression or death due to any cause as determined by independent review 
committee (IRC) using EBMT criteria.  
The co-primary endpoint was ORR defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who have either 
partial response or complete response as determined by IRC using the EBMT criteria. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
- Overall survival defined as the time from randomization to the date of death from any cause.  
- Brief Pain Inventory Short Form, as a patient reported outcome assessed at screening, on day 1 of each 
cycle and at the end of treatment. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints 
- Time to tumour response, defined as the time from randomization to the first objective documentation 
of PR or better.  
- Duration of response, as measured from the time that the criteria for objective response are first met 
until the date of a progression event/death. 
- Progression free survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years. 
- Overall survival rates at 3, 4, 5 and 6 years. 
- European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life Questionnaire (EORTC 
QLQ-C30), European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life myeloma-specific 
module (EORTC-QLQ-MY20) and the Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form (BPI-SF).  
Sample size 
Approximately 640 patients were planned to be randomized. Overall alpha (0.05 two-sided) was split over 
the two primary endpoints as 0.005 for ORR and 0.045 for PFS. 
With 640 subjects the test for the ORR would have 88.5% power at the 2-sided alpha level of 0.5% when 
the true odds ratio of the experimental to the control arm is 2 (i.e. when the response rate in the control 
arm is 60% and 75% in the experimental). 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015

In total 466 PFS events were planned for the primary efficacy analysis of PFS to ensure that a 2-sided test 
procedure at significance level 0.045 within 1 interim analysis will have 88.7% power if the median PFS 
times in the control and experimental arms are 11.1 and 15 months, respectively, i.e., if the hazard ratio 
of the experimental arm to control arm is 0.74. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomized to either E-Ld or Ld alone in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive voice response 
system (IVRS). The randomization was stratified by the following factors: β2 microglobulin (< 3.5 versus 
≥ 3.5 mg/L); Number of prior lines of therapy (1 versus 2 or 3) and Prior IMiD (no vs prior thalidomide 
only vs other) 
No more than 10% of subjects with prior lenalidomide therapy were allowed to be enrolled and this 
restriction was implemented using the IVRS. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The ORR (per IRC) and PFS (per IRC) were selected as co-primary endpoints. If either of these two 
analyses achieved the level of significance (2-sided 0.5% for ORR or 2-sided 4.5% for PFS to preserve the 
overall type-I error for the study at the 5% level), the corresponding primary objective could be declared 
statistically significant. 
No interim analysis of ORR was planned.  A PFS interim analysis was planned when 70 % of the events 
would have been observed (i.e. 326 events of the planned 466 events) and after a minimum follow-up of 
2 years from LPFV.  
Crossover was not permitted at any time during the study. The number of events and power for PFS were 
calculated assuming an exponential distribution for each arm. The alpha level for PFS was adjusted for the 
planned interim analysis (IA) using Lan-DeMets α spending function with the O’Brien-Fleming type of 
boundary and is calculated based on the actual number of events observed at the time of analysis. If there 
were exactly 326 events, the DMC could recommend stopping the study for superior PFS if the two-sided 
p-value is ≤ 0.0128. An observed hazard ratio of 0.7581 or less would result in a statistically significant 
difference at the IA. A hazard ratio of 0.7581 would translate to a 3.5 months improvement in median PFS 
(11.1 vs. 14.6 months). In case the study was stopped at the PFS IA because of superior PFS, randomized 
subjects would continue to be followed until the survival data were mature.  
The nominal significance level for the final look, after 466 progression events, would be 0.0411. An 
observed hazard ratio of 0.8269 or less at the final analysis would result in a statistically significant 
difference and it would translate to a 2.3 months improvement in median PFS.  
At database lock, 384 PFS events, corresponding to 82.4% of the 466 required events, were achieved, 
based on which the adjusted alpha level is 0.0239 (obtained using the Lan-DeMets α spending function 
with the O’Brien-Fleming type of boundary). 
Primary analysis of PFS was per IRC based EBMT criteria with the following (censoring) scheme: 
•  Clinical deterioration is not considered progression. 
•  Subsequent systemic anti-myeloma therapy prior to documented progression is censored (at last 
tumor assessment before or on initiation of therapy 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 44/110 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Subjects with event (death or progression) > 10 weeks (2 missed visits) after previou adequate 
tumor assessment  will be censored on that last adequate tumor assessment 
•  Subjects with no post-baseline tumor assessments and not die within 10 weeks after 
randomisation will be censored at date of randomisation 
Supportive analyses for PFS included: ITT analysis per IRC of PFS; PFS per investigator using primary 
censoring scheme; PFS per investigator using ITT censoring scheme; A multivariate analysis 
(stratification factors and age, gender, ECOG, prior stem transplantation, high risk myeloma, time from 
diagnosis, creatine clearance, LDH; unstratified log rank test; and stratified analysis according to baseline 
CRF instead of IVRS. 
Supportive and sensitivity analyses for ORR included: ORR by IRC using only data on randomized 
treatment (i.e., not counting best response during subsequent therapies); ORR using investigator 
assessment of best response; idem with not counting best response during subsequent therapies and 
ORR with 95%-CI using Clopper-Pearson methods

Subgroups: Key Efficacy Data by Lines of Therapy and Prior Therapy- CA204004 
In order to have better understanding of which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment with the 
combination of elotuzumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, the absolute values of key parameters 
such as PFS, ORR, OS were provided for subgroups pre-defined according to the number of prior regimens 
and type of agents with which patients have previously been treated. 
The numbers of patients per subgroup and the key parameters are shown in the tables below.

Exploratory endpoints 
The median time to first response per IRC was 1.87 months in both treatment groups, and this was 
comparable to the investigator assessment (1.9 months in both arms). The median time to best response 
per IRC was 2.8 months for both treatment arms (3.8 months per investigator) (data not shown). 
The median duration of response per IRC was 20.7 months in the E-Ld group and 16.6 months in the Ld 
group (data not shown). 
No statistically significant changes from baseline were observed between the treatment groups in terms 
of the quality of life exploratory endpoints endpoints (Tables 21 and 22).

Ancillary analyses 
Time to next therapy (TTNT) 
In study CA204004, subjects who discontinued therapy were followed for PFS and/or OS. As part of this 
assessment, the subsequent systemic therapy for treating MM was collected. Time to next therapy 
defined as the time from randomization to earliest start date of subsequent myeloma systemic therapy. 
Based on these results, the HR for TTNT is 0.62 (CI: 0.49, 0.78). KM curves for TTNT early diverged and 
further separated after approximately 1 year (median TTNT is NE with E-Ld [95%CI 28.3, NE] and 21.22 
months with Ld [95%CI 18.07; 23.20]).

Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 60/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 19. Treatment Schedule (Study CA204009) 
Elotuzumab was administered weekly at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV. Dose reductions were not permitted. In 
cycle 3 and beyond, elotuzumab dosing could be delayed by up to 1 week as clinically indicated. 
Bortezomib was administered at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 as IV bolus or SQ injection. The treatment schedule 
is different between cycles (Table 18). 
Dexamethasone was administered at a dose of 20 mg p.o on days without elotuzumab infusion. On days 
of elotuzumab infusion, dexamethasone was administered at a split dose of 8 mg p.o (3-24 hours before 
the start of infusion), and 8 mg IV (at least 45 minutes prior to elotuzumab infusion).  
Co-medication included: 
-  Oral anti-viral therapy (acyclovir or equivalent)  
- 
Patients were required to receive pre-medication 30-90 minutes prior to each dose of 
elotuzumab: 
o  H1 blocker: diphenhydramine (25-50 mg PO or IV) or equivalent 
o  H2 blocker: ranitidine (50 mg IV) or equivalent 
o  Acetaminophen (650-1000 mg PO) 
Treatment with study drug continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare the progression free survival (PFS) of E-Bd versus Bd alone. 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 61/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary objectives included the comparison of response rates between arms in the overall population 
and between arms in the subgroup of subjects with at least one FcγRIIIa V allele. Estimation of the PFS 
hazard ratio in the subgroup of subjects with at least one FcγRIIIa V allele was also a secondary objective.  
Exploratory objectives included the evaluation of: safety of elotuzumab in combination with bortezomib 
and dexamethasone, to estimate PFS HR and difference in response rates between arms in the subgroup 
of subjects with no FcγRIIIa V allele; to estimate overall survival, time to tumour response (TTR) and 
duration of response (DOR) in the overall population and the FcγRIIIa V allele subgroups; to estimate the 
interaction between treatment and the presence of at least one FcγRIIIa V allele on PFS; to characterise 
PK of elotuzumab and explore exposure-response relationships with respect to safety, efficacy, and 
biomarkers; to identify and evaluate potential pharmacodynamic and/or predictive biomarkers of activity 
of elotuzumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone;   to evaluate immunogenicity of 
elotuzumab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was PFS defined as PFS is the time from randomization to the date of the first 
documented tumour progression or death due to any cause. 
The secondary endpoints was ORR defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who achieve a best 
response of complete response (CR), stringent complete response (sCR), very good partial response 
(VGPR), or partial response (PR) using the modified IMWG criteria as per investigator’s assessment). 
Exploratory endpoints included TTR (defined as the time from randomization to the first objective 
documentation of PR or better), DOR (time that the criteria for objective response are first met until the 
date of a progression event), OS (time from randomization to the date of death from any cause). 
Sample size 
The planned sample size was 150 patients. The comparison of PFS between treatment arms was planned 
to be made at the one-sided, 0.15, significance level because this is a proof-of-concept trial, rather than 
a confirmatory trial. The study would require at least 103 progression events (documented progressions 
or deaths) to complete. This number of events ensured that a one-sided, 0.15 level log-rank test will have 
80% power if the median PFS times in the control and investigational arms are 10 months and 14.5 
months, respectively, ie, if the hazard ratio of the investigational arm to the control arm is 0.69. Assuming 
an accrual rate of 10 subjects per month, the study would take approximately 28 months for final PFS 
evaluation. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized to receive either elotzumab + Bd or Bd with a ratio of 1:1 and stratified based 
on: Prior proteasome inhibitor exposure (yes vs. no); Presence of at least one FcγRIIIa V allele (yes vs. 
no) and Number of prior lines of therapy (1 vs. 2 or 3). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses (PFS, ORR and OS) were conducted on the population of all randomized subjects (all 
subjects who gave signed informed consent and who were entered in the IVRS). 
The Kaplan-Meier (KM) product limit method was used to estimate the distribution and median of each 
time-to-event endpoint in which censoring is involved. Breslow method was used for handling ties. The 
Assessment report

median along with CIs were estimated based on Brookmeyer and Crowley methodology (using log-log 
transformation for constructing the CIs). A stratified (by IVRS stratification factors and treatment as the 
sole covariate) Cox proportional hazards model was used to compute an estimate and CI for the hazard 
ratio of E-Bd to Bd. Rates at fixed time points (i.e. PFS at 1 year) were derived from the K-M estimate 
along with their corresponding log-log transformed 95% CIs.  
An analysis of PFS was also performed using an unstratified multivariate Cox regression model to 
estimate the treatment effect after adjustment for possible imbalances in pre-specified potential 
prognostic factors. This model consisted of the following baseline covariates, in addition to the treatment 
arm as randomized: prior proteasome use (yes versus no); presence of at least one FcγRIIIa V allele (yes 
versus no); number of prior lines of therapy (1 versus 2 or 3); age (<65 versus ≥ 65 years); ECOG PS ( 
0-1 versus 2); Prior stem cell transplantation (yes versus no); Best response to last therapy ( PR or better 
versus minimal response or below); Creatinine clearance (< 60 ml/min vs ≥60 ml/min); LDH (<300 IU/L, 
≥300 IU/L). The influence of baseline and demographic characteristics on the treatment effect on the PFS 
by primary definition was explored via subset analyses. In order to summarize the PFS distribution in each 
arm in each of the subsets, there should have been at least 10% (ie, 12 PFS events) of the events in each 
level of the subset. 
The level of the covariate normally associated with the worst prognosis was coded as the reference level. 
All the specified analyses of PFS were repeated using the secondary definitions of ATA. 
Beyond the analyses in the overall study population, subset analyses of PFS and ORR were also performed 
by baseline and demographic characteristics.

Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled from 31 January 2012 through 15 April 2013. The last patient visit (for the primary 
endpoint) was on 30 May 2014. Subjects were enrolled at 53 sites in 4 countries. Subjects were accrued 
from France (13.8%), Italy (43.4%), Spain (11.2%) and the United Sates (31.6%).  
Conduct of the study 
Study protocol amendments 
The original study protocol was dated 20 July 2011 and was subsequently amended 2 times. The major 
changes were as follows: 
Protocol amendment 20 April 2012 
-  Addition of entry criterion to exclude patients previously exposed to elotuzumab 
-  Response Criteria Modified from IMWG was revised to agree with criteria appropriate for use with 
the study population 
-  Additional clarification provided on the objectives of the second interim analysis, to not only 
evaluate safety, but also look at preliminary efficacy data in order to make early program level 
decisions. 
Protocol amendment 25 October 2012  
-  Modifications to the inclusion criteria include  
o  broadening the number of lines of prior therapy from 1 - 2 lines to 1 – 3 lines of therapy 
and  
o  Allowing up to 15% of patients to have had prior non-bortezomib proteasome inhibitor 
therapy 
-  Broadening of the stratification criteria to adapt to these changes, ie, stratification of subjects 
during randomization will be based on subjects have 1 versus 2 or 3 lines of therapy, instead of 
1 versus 2 lines of therapy, and subjects being proteasome inhibitor naive versus having had prior 
proteasome inhibitor exposure, instead of bortezomib naive versus prior bortezomib exposure 
-  Removal of the exclusion criteria describing subjects with uncontrolled diabetes defined as an 
HbA1c ≥ 8.0 and decreasing the disease-free interval for subjects with other prior malignancy 
from 5 years to 3 years 
-  Clarification that once subjects reach cycle 5 without any Grade ≥2 infusion reactions, the 
infusion rate at C5D1 should be increased by 1 mL per minute in a stepwise fashion in each cycle 
up to a maximum of 5 mL per minute. 
Protocol compliance 
Relevant protocol deviations were defined as a deviation from the protocol which could be programmed 
using the database and which could potentially affect the interpretability of the study results. In the E-Bd 
arm 4 patients had at least one relevant protocol deviation, in the Bd arm 8 patients. The type of protocol 
deviations was equally divided in both arms: half of the deviations were caused by eligibility deviations 
(non-measurable disease) and half of the deviations were on-treatment (continuous study therapy 4 
weeks after progression per investigator, i.e. 8 weeks after first date of documented progression).

Figure 5. Kaplan-Meier Plot of primary PFS (Primary ATA) – All Randomized Patients (Study 
CA204009) 
Supportive PFS analyses 
In the secondary PFS analysis based on primary ATA definition, the median PFS was 9.7 months in the 
E-Bd arm (95% CI: 6.57, 15.51), compared to 6.6 months in the Bd arm (95% CI: 5.03, 8.84). The HR 
was 0.66 (96% CI 0.42, 1.03; 70% CI: 0.52, 0.83; p=0.0645) (data not shown). 
Sensitivity analysis PFS 
A sensitivity analysis using a multivariate Cox model, adjusting for possible imbalances in pre- specified 
prognostic factors, yielded an estimated PFS HR of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.81; p=0.0039). Only one 
factor, baseline LDH, significantly influenced PFS, with a PFS HR (LDH < 300 U/L compared to LDH ≥300 
U/L) of 0.42 (0.27, 0.65; p=0.0001) (data not shown). 
Secondary endpoint 
Objective response rate 
Best overall response (BOR) in the E-BD arm was 64.9% (95% CI: 53.2, 75.5) compared to 62.7% (95% 
CI: 50.7, 73.6) in the Bd arm. The 95% CI for the difference in ORR (-13.2, 17.8) included 0, indicating 
there was no significant difference between the two arms. 
For E-Bd and Bd, respectively, 31.2% and 36.0% of patients achieved a PR, 29.9% and 22.7% of patients 
achieved a VGPR, 3.9% and 2.7% of patients achieved a CR, and 0 and 1.3% of patients  achieved a sCR. 
There was no difference between treatment groups in BOR for patients with or without at least 1 FcγRIIIα 
V allele, or other subsets of patients (data not shown). 
Exploratory endpoints 
Time to tumour response 
The median time to response was 1.43 months for the 50 responder patients in the E-Bd arm compared 
to 1.51 months for the 47 responder patients in the Bd arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 69/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For patients with at least one FcγRIIIa V allele the median time to tumour response was 1.35 months in 
the E-Bd arm compared to 1.45 months in the Bd arm (33 responder patients in each arm). For patients 
without at least one FcγRIIIa V allele, the median duration of response was 1.45 months in the E-BD arm 
(17 responder patients) compared to 2.18 months in the Bd arm (14 responder patients) (data not 
shown). 
Duration of response 
The median duration of response was 10.35 months (95% CI: 8.54, 14.75) in the E-Bd arm compared to 
9.26 months in the Bd arm (95% CI: 5.59, 11.73). 
For patients with at least one FcγRIIIa V allele the median duration of response was 11.37 months in the 
E-Bd arm compared to 10.35 months in the Bd arm. For patients without at least one FcγRIIIa V allele, the 
median duration of response was 9.41 months in the E-BD arm compared to 6.21 months in the Bd arm 
(data not shown). 
Overall survival 
Preliminary OS data were provided with 40 reported deaths (17 patients (22.1%) on E-Bd, and 23 
patients (30.7%) on Bd) and a median follow up of approximately 18 months in both arms. The 1-year OS 
rate (95% CI) was 0.85 (0.75, 0.92) for the E-Bd group and 0.74 (0.62, 0.83) for the Bd group.  
At 28 months of follow-up, deaths in the empliciti combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone study 
arm and the bortezomib and dexamethasone study arm were 28 [36%]) and 32 [43%], respectively 
(data not shown).

Supportive studies 
The results from pivotal studies CA204004 and CA204009 were supported by phase 2 study 
HuLuc63-1703 (E-Ld) and phase 1 study HuLuc63-1702 (E-Bd), described under ‘‘section 2.5.1. Dose 
response studies’’. A summary of the efficacy results in comparison with the pivotal trials is provided in 
Table 33 and Table 34.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Both pivotal studies were open-label studies which might have influenced efficacy evaluation, although an 
independent review committee (IRC) was assigned in study CA204004 reviewing all tumour assessment 
data to determine the best response and date of progression. In contrast, the primary endpoint PFS in 
study CA204009 was investigator-based, and no IRC was assigned, lowering reliability of the obtained 
Assessment report

Page 75/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
study results. Reliability of efficacy results could also be considered lower compared to study CA204004 
due to the much lower number of included patients in study CA204009 (646 vs. 152). 
As the median number of prior treatments was 2 in the population in which the E-Ld combination was 
investigated and only one prior treatment in the E-Bd study, the E-Ld population is considered more 
representative of a population who have received one or more prior treatments as in the claimed 
indication. 
The dosage for each combination has been adequately justified and is based on lack of increase of efficacy 
and even decreased efficacy,  at a dose of 20 mg/kg compared to 10 mg/kg possibly due to saturation of 
elotuzumab binding to SLAMF7. 
In study CA204004 demographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced between treatment 
arms.  A limitation of the data on the E-Ld combination is that only 6% of subjects in study CA204004 had 
received prior lenalidomide therapy and no lenalidomide refractory patients were included. These 
limitations have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For the E-Ld regimen, according to the ITT analysis, a statistically significant 4.2 months (18.5 vs. 14.3) 
improvement in PFS was observed compared with Ld alone ( HR=0.68, 95% CI 0.56, 0.83, p=0.0001). 
The co-primary endpoint ORR showed benefit for the E-Ld combination as well: 78.5% E-Ld vs 65.5% Ld, 
with a common odds ratio of 1.94. A higher frequency of complete responses was observed within the Ld 
arm (1.6% E-Ld vs. 5.8% Ld) which is likely due to cross-interference detection of elotuzumab in the 
SPEP (serum protein electrophoresis) and SIFE (serum immunofixation electrophoresis) assays testing M 
protein levels. 
Efficacy of E-Ld was maintained in patients with up to 3 prior lines of therapy, the population studied in 
study CA204004. In patients treated with E-Ld, the median PFS was similar in patients with 1, 2 or 3 prior 
lines of therapy. Median overall survival was similar in patients with 1 or 2 prior lines of therapy and 
somewhat lower in those with 3 prior lines. Importantly, the benefit in PFS and in OS compared to Ld 
increased in those with 3 prior lines, justifying it’s use in those with more advanced disease. Also in 
patients with refractory disease, there was clear median PFS benefit of approximately 6 months. In 
patients with lower risk disease, specifically patients not refractory to prior treatment and those in IMWG 
standard risk category, PFS benefit was also evident.  
Improvements observed in PFS were consistent across subsets regardless of age (< 65 versus ≥ 65), risk 
status, presence or absence of cytogenetic categories del 17p or t(4;14), ISS stage, number of prior 
therapies, prior immunomodulatory exposure, prior bortezomib exposure, relapsed or refractory status  
or renal function (SmPC section 5.1). 
For the number of prior lines of therapy, the HR for (PFS ITT definition) for E-Ld vs Ld is similar at 0.71 
(0.54, 0.94) and 0.72 (0.51, 1.00) for one or 2 prior lines respectively and is similar to that in the overall 
population. The PFS benefit (HR) with E-Ld vs Ld for those with 3 prior lines is more favourable at 0.53 
(0.33, 0.83) although it should be noted that there were only approximately 50 patients (15%)  in each 
arm with 3 prior therapies compared to approximately 116 in each arm with 2 prior therapies and 150 
with one prior therapy. 
Noticeably, the HR for OS at 0.92 (0.66,1.29) and also the course of the K-M curves, suggest no benefit 
for E-Ld compared to Ld  for those with only one prior line of therapy. 
For those with 2 prior lines, HR for E-LD-vs Ld was 0.73 (0.49, 1.10), and similar to that in the overall 
population. As for PFS, benefit as reflected in the HR is greater for those with 3 prior lines of therapy (HR 
0.56; 95%b CI 0.34, 0.92). 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 76/110 
 
 
 
 
 
For both study arms, the ORR is fairly similar in those with 1, 2 or 3 prior therapy lines. It was 
approximately 78% in the E-Ld arm and 66% in the Ld arm for those with 1 or 2 prior lines and for those 
with 3 prior lines of therapy it was 70 % and 60% in the E-Ld and ld arms respectively 
The results of an updated OS analysis (cut-off date of 29 October 2015) with a minimum follow up of 35.4 
months showed a similar trend to the initial analysis: A 23% reduction in the risk of death (HR 0.77, 95% 
CI: 0.61 0.97; p=-0.0257) was observed. Median OS was 43.7 months (95% CI: 40.3, NE) for E-Ld arm 
versus 39.6 months (95% CI: 33.3, NE) for Ld arm. 
The 1-, 2- and 3-year rates of overall survival for Empliciti in combination with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone treatment were 91%, 73%, and 60% respectively, compared with 83%, 69%, and 53% 
respectively, for lenalidomide and dexamethasone treatment (SmPC section 5.1).Compared to the overall 
population, median PFS and OS in the Prior Systemic Therapy subgroups, each of which represents a 
separate agent, are not less favourable than in the overall population, except that as only approximately 
6% of patients in each arm had received prior lenalidomide no conclusions for that subgroup can be made. 
According to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, no data on the efficacy of E-Ld in patients with known 
refractoriness to lenalidomide could be provided.   
Unfortunately, except for “no prior IMiD” the PFS and OS data for the subgroups representing patients 
who had not previously been treated with a particular therapy have not been provided.  
With regard to prior SCT, for PFS the HR 0.64 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.85) is somewhat more favourable for 
those who have not had a prior SCT compared to 0.72 (0.56, 0.93) for those who did have a SCT. For OS 
there is little difference between prior SCT or not with a HR 0.75 (0.54, 1.05) for those who have not had 
a prior SCT compared to 0.80 (0.58, 1.09) for those who did have a prior SCT. These hazard ratios are 
comparable to that in the overall population (HR 0.77 (0.61, 0.97)). For both study arms the ORR is fairly 
similar in those who did or did not have prior SCT. In a Cox proportional hazards model analysis 
conducted to evaluate possible confounding factors on PFS, prior stem cell transplantation was indeed 
one of the statistically significant factors (HR, no prior SCT versus prior SCT= 0.67, P= 0.0032). Rueff et 
al., (2014) have shown a positive correlation between NK cell count at 1 month after ASCT and PFS, and 
NK cells are known to play a relevant role in the mechanism of action of Elotuzumab. It is therefore 
possible that NK cell count at baseline may also have an impact on clinical response to Elotuzumab, and 
that patients with prior ASCT may have impaired NK cell counts or functionality. The CHMP recommended 
the applicant to further investigate the association between baseline NK cell counts and PD/clinical 
endpoints. In particular, a small sub-study in the CA204006 trial in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
patients with elotuzumab in combination withlenalidomide/dexamethasone is currently ongoing and new 
data will be provided.   
These data on subgroups pre-defined according to the number of prior regimens and type of agents with 
which patients have previously been treated provide reassurance that ORR and PFS benefit of E-Ld 
compared to Ld in all the subgroups analysed is similar to that seen in the overall population, not 
forgetting that only approximately 6% of patients in each arm had received prior lenalidomide precluding 
conclusions on this small subgroup.  
For OS, the case is different as, despite a PFS benefit similar to that in the overall population, there is no 
apparent OS benefit in the large subgroup of those who have had only one prior therapy, representing 
approximately 50% of the study population. This lack of survival benefit calls into question the ultimate 
benefit of adding elotuzumab to lenalidomide / dexamethasone in these patients. However, most patients 
who have had only one prior line of therapy are still at a relatively early stage in their disease and a benefit 
in OS is less likely to be apparent. Furthermore, the effect of therapies subsequent to E-Ld or Ld will be a 
major influence on the OS.  
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 77/110 
 
 
 
 
 
The approach of accepting a PFS benefit if there is no detrimental effect on OS was agreed in scientific 
advice for elotuzumab. As patients with only one prior line of treatment have an expected survival of 
several years, it can be accepted that for these patients no OS benefit of E-Ld compared to Ld has yet 
been observed.  
Concerning prior systemic therapies, except for IMiDs, it is not possible to evaluate whether receiving a 
particular prior therapy or not, is associated with a differential response to E-Ld or Ld. 
The median PFS advantage with E-Ld in some lower risk subgroups was reduced compared to that 
observed in the overall population, in particular in: not refractory patients (ITT-PFS advantage over Ld: 
2.8 months), patients with no prior treatment with IMiDs (median ITT-PFS advantage: 1.4 months) and 
IMWG standard risk patients (median ITT-PFS advantage: 3 months). 
Apart from the the subgroup of patients who have received no prior IMiD (thalidomide), PFS benefit with 
E-Ld compared to Ld  is evident to varying degrees in the subgroups  although it should be taken into 
consideration that some of these subgroups are very small.  
The pattern in the subgroup prior lenalidomide seems similar to that seen with prior thalidomide.i.e. 
larger PFS benefit than in the overall population, but the prior lenalidomide subgroup was only 
approximately 6% of the population, meaning that estimations of medians and HR are uncertain. 
For the subgroups prior IMiD (thalidomide) vs no prior IMiD there is a large difference between the 
subgroups in the benefit in median PFS. 
In patients who had not had prior IMiD therapy (no lenalidomide or thalidomide) the PFS benefit of E-Ld 
compared to Ld (approximately 1.4 months) was lower than in the overall population and was higher in 
patients who had received prior thalidomide therapy (approximately 6 months). However, the 
thalidomide-exposed population is likely to be very heterogeneous and characteristics of the patients who 
did or did not have prior thalidomide e.g.  number of prior therapy lines,  prior SCT, risk category, 
refractory status, number of prior thalidomide regimens, whether prior thalidomide was received in a SCT 
regimen, possibly refractory to thalidomide are not known. It is not clear if the difference in PFS is related 
to prior thalidomide therapy yes/no or to some other factor or a combination of factors.The extent of 
exposure to thalidomide in these different settings is also likely to be variable and it cannot be excluded 
that the higher efficacy observed in the IMiD exposed population might have been driven by patients with 
long-term exposure or who have become refractory to thalidomide.  Additional subgroup analyses 
according to the extent of actual exposure to thalidomide are not expected to provide valuable 
information. Information has been included in SmPC Section 5.1 on the PFS and HR in the subgroups of 
those who had prior IMiD (Thal) and no prior IMiD, refractory and not refractory patients, and those with 
high risk and standard risk MM.  
During the assessment the CHMP raised a major objection on the indication regarding the E-Bd 
combination. In study CA204009 the evidence of a clinically relevant benefit is considered insufficient. In 
addition, the trial population was limited in number and two thirds of the patients had had only one prior 
therapy. The indication has now been revised by the applicant and restricted to elotuzumab in 
combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult 
patients who have received one prior therapy.   
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal study CA204004 demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for elotuzumab in 
combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients who have received at 
least one prior therapy in terms of the primary endpoint PFS. Progression free survvival improvement was 
supported by ORR benefit. Updated OS data confirmed the trend to OS benefit and the benefit in PFS and 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 78/110 
 
 
 
 
 
in OS compared to Ld increased in those with 3 prior lines, justifying the use of elotuzumab in patients 
with more advanced disease. In patients with lower risk disease, specifically patients not refractory to 
prior treatment and those in IMWG standard risk category, PFS benefit was also evident.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The clinical studies supporting safety of elotuzumab are reported and described in details in Table 35.

Patient exposure 
The majority of the safety results are derived from the 10 mg/kg elotuzumab dose, based on the  
percentage of subjects treated at that dose. Data on the overall elotuzumab exposure are reported in

Adverse events of special interest 
Infusion reactions 
All ongoing elotuzumab studies were amended in 2010, after the Grade 3 infusion AEs were observed in 
the Phase 1 program with studies HuLuc63-1701, HuLuc63-1702, and Phase 1b portion of Huluc63-1703, 
to ensure that all subjects received premedication with IV corticosteroids, oral or IV diphenhydramine, 
and oral acetaminophen prior to each elotuzumab infusion. Hence, all subjects treated in the Phase 2 
portion of HuLuc63-1703 received this amended premedication regimen. 
In CA204004 study, infusion reactions were reported in approximately 10% of premedicated patients 
treated with Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (N = 318) (see section 4.4). The 
rate of mild to moderate infusion reactions was > 50% in patients who were not premedicated. All reports 
of infusion reaction were ≤ Grade 3. Grade 3 infusion reactions occurred in 1% of patients. The most 
common symptoms of an infusion reaction included fever, chills, and hypertension. Five percent (5%) of 
patients required interruption of the administration of Empliciti for a median of 25 minutes due to infusion 
reaction, and 1% of patients discontinued due to infusion reactions. Of the patients who experienced an 
infusion reaction, 70% (23/33) had the reaction during the first dose (SmPC section 4.8). 
In the submitted elotuzumab trials, an infusion rate escalation plan was implemented (in combination 
with guidelines for the safety management of IRs and premedication administration) to shorten the 
infusion time of elotuzumab from 2 1/2 hours (0.5 mL/minute every 30 minutes to a maximum of 2 
mL/min) to approximately 1 hour (up to 5 mL/min).  
The results of the faster infusion rate are presented for 2 randomized trials (HuLuc63-1703 and 
CA204009 and 1 ongoing trial (CA204112).  In study CA204004, only very few infusions were given at a 
faster rate (of 12,581 infusions there were 40 infusions at >2ml/min, of which 11 ≥ 5 mL/min)  and they 
did not lead to new or additional IR events. 
-  HuLuc63-1703 (E-Ld): 31 patients in the phase 2 portion had an infusion rate escalated up to 5 
mL/min. Only 1 patient experienced a grade 1 event of nausea at the highest infusion rate, which 
was considered an IR. The faster 5 mL/min infusion rate appeared as safe as the 2 mL/min 
infusion rate with no increase in IRs at 5 mL/min. 
-  CA204009 (E-Bd): No infusion reactions were reported among the 36% of patients in the E-Bd 
treatment group who had infusions administered at a faster rate of 5 mL/min. 
-  CA204112 (E-Ld): Preliminary data of this ongoing study (using a similar escalation strategy as 
proposed in the elotuzumab SmPC) showed one grade 2 IR of the 69 patients treated for at least 
2 months or more. This grade 2 IR led to study drug interruption. 
Second primary malignancies 
In CA204004 study, invasive SPMs have been observed in 6.9% of patients treated with Empliciti 
combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (N = 318) and 4.1% of patients treated with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (N = 317). The rate of haematologic malignancies was the same 
between the two treatment arms (1.6%). Solid tumours were reported in 2.5% and 1.9% of Empliciti 
combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone and lenalidomide and dexamethasone treated patients, 
respectively. Non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in 3.1% and 1.6% of patients treated with 
Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone and lenalidomide and dexamethasone, 
respectively (SmPC section 4.8).

Table 39. Second Primary Malignancies – All Treated Patients Study CA204004 
In study CA204009 2.7% (n=2: breast cancer and basal cell carcinoma) had a SPM in the E-Bd arm, vs. 
1.3% (n=1: squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) in the Bd arm. 
Infections 
In study CA204004, infections were reported in 81.4% of patients in the Empliciti combined with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone arm (N=318) and 74.4% in lenalidomide and dexamethasone arm (N = 
317). Grade 3-4 infections were noted in 28% and 24.3% of Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone and lenalidomide and dexamethasone treated patients, respectively. Fatal infections 
were infrequent and were reported in 2.5% of Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
and 2.2% of lenalidomide and dexamethasone treated patients. The incidence of pneumonia was higher 
in the Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone arm compared to lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone arm reported at 15.1% vs. 11.7% with a fatal outcome at 0.6% vs. 0%, respectively 
(SmPC section 4.8). 
The median absolute lymphocyte count at time of infection was 0.7 (Grade 1) in the E-Ld arm, and 
1.0x109/L in the Ld arm.  Median time to first infection of any grade was similar in both treatment groups 
(2.3 months with E-Ld and 2.7 with Ld). The median duration was similar as well (13 and 12.5 days, 
respectively). 
For patients with prior stem cell transplant, a higher frequency of infections was observed in the E-Ld arm 
(87.4%) compared to the Ld arm (75.8%). There was no difference in Grade 3-4 lymphopenia between 
E-Ld patients with or without prior SCT (78% and 75%, respectively). For patients without prior stem cell 
transplantation, the frequency of infections was similar between treatment groups (74.8% E-Ld  and 72.7% 
Ld).  
The total number of deaths due to infection within 60 days of last study drug, regardless of relationship to 
study therapy, was 10 patients in the E-Ld group and 7 in the Ld group. This included the categories 
infection, study drug toxicity, disease and other. 
Assessment report

Of the 10 patients in the E-Ld arm, 7 were included in the category of infection, 2 within study drug 
toxicity, and 1 in the category of disease: The types of infection AEs reported were: purulent meningitis, 
sepsis, right pneumopathy, septic shock, Pseudomonas aerouginosa sepsis, disease progression and 
complications due to infection, influenza virus B infection, lower respiratory tract infection related to IV 
dexamethasone (1 subject for each event), and pneumonia (2 subjects). 
Of the 7 patients in the Ld arm, 2 subjects were included in the category of infection, 4 within study drug 
toxicity, and 1 in the category of other (bronchopneumonia, fatal): The types of infection AEs reported 
were: sepsis (3 subjects), fatal bronchopneumonia, Pneumocystitis pneumonia, acute peritonitis, and 
possible septic shock (1 subject for each event). 
A summary of Infections and Infestations reported in study CA204004 is presented in Table 45. 
Table 40. Summary of Infections and Infestations – All Treated Patients (CA204004) 
In study CA204009, AEs of infection of any grade occurred more frequently in the E-Ld arm (65.3% E-Bd 
vs 53.3% Bd). SAEs of any grade in 21.3% vs 16.0%. The most common Grade 3-4 infection was 
pneumonia, occurring in a similar percentage of both arms (6.7%). 
Deep vein thrombosis 
In Study CA204004, deep vein thromboses were reported in 7.2% of patients treated with Empliciti 
combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (N = 318) and 3.8% of patients treated with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone (N = 317). Among, patients treated with aspirin, deep vein thromboses 
were reported in 4.1% of patients treated with Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone

(E Ld) and 1.4% of patients treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Ld). The rates of deep vein 
thromboses observed between treatment arms were similar for patients given prophylaxis with low 
molecular weight heparin (2.2% in both treatment arms), and for patients given vitamin K antagonists 
the rates were 0% for patients treated with E Ld and 6.7% for patients treated with Ld (SmPC section 
4.8).

Deaths 
In study CA204004, with deaths reported as of database cut- off (29-Oct-2014) 29.6% (n=94) of patients 
in the E-Ld group and 36.6% (n=116) in the Ld group died. The majority of all deaths were due to disease 
progression in both treatment groups (18.9%, n=60 in the E-Ld group and 24.6%, n=78 in the Ld group). 
Other primary causes of death in the E-Ld and Ld groups included infection (5.0% vs. 2.8%), 
cardiovascular disease (0.9% vs. 2.2%), and study drug toxicity (1.6% and 1.9%, respectively). 
In the pooled E-Ld population the required time period for reporting of death varied between the studies. 
In total 22% (n=99) of the patients had died, of which 13.3% due to disease progression. The other 
primary causes were similar to study CA204004, but with different frequencies: infection (3.5%), 
cardiovascular disease (0.7%) and study drug toxicity (1.1%).

5%) and hyperglycaemia (17% vs 10.2%). Hyper-/hyponatremia, and hypercalcemia occurred in similar 
frequencies in both treatment arms (0.3%, ~10.4% and ~2.5%, respectively). No pooled E-Ld data were 
provided.  
CA204009 -E-Bd combination 
In study CA204009, Grade 3-4 chemistry laboratory results occurring more frequently in the E-Bd arm 
were: hyperkalemia (5.5% E-Bd vs. 1.4% Bd), hypokalemia (8.2% vs. 4.1%) and hyperglycaemia (17.8%

Electrocardiograms 
The effects of elotuzumab treatment on the QT/QTc interval, as well as AEs potentially related to ECG 
intervals, was assessed in elotuzumab-treated subjects from Studies CA204004 and CA204011 who 
consented to participate in the ECG sub-studies. Overall, elotuzumab treatment was not associated with 
meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval and no safety concerns were evident based on ECG results for 
subjects treated with elotuzumab across the clinical development program. An assessment of the clinical 
database did not uncover any AEs (e.g., seizure/convulsion, syncope/presyncope, ventricular 
arrhythmias) that were considered potentially related to ECG findings.

Renal impairment 
In study CA204004 and CA204009, no patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl<30 mL/min) were 
included. Phase 1 study CA204007 evaluated the safety of elotuzumab in newly diagnosed and R/R MM 
subjects with and without renal impairment. Eight patients with a normal renal function (NRF; CrCl ≥90 
mL/min),  9 patients with severe renal disease (SRI; CrCl<30 mL/min) not requiring dialysis, and 9 
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD; requiring hemodialysis) were included and treated with 
E-Ld. 
The percentage of AEs and Grade 3-4 AEs were balanced between the three subgroups (Table 54). 
However, the frequency of SAEs was higher for SRI and ESRD patients (55.6% and 77.8%, respectively) 
compared with patients with normal renal function (37.5%). Four patients had AEs leading to 
discontinuation: n=3 (33.3%) in the SRI group and n=1 (12.5%) in the NRF group. In addition, more 
infusion reactions were reported for the ESRD arm (22.2% vs 12.5% NRF). The numbers analysed are 
however small, hampering interpretation of safety results.

Hepatic impairment 
No patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment have been included in elotuzumab studies. This 
information is included in SmPC section 4.2. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific safety issues related to possible drug-drug interaction were identified (see also discussion on 
clinical pharmacology). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
CA204004 -E-Ld combination 
In study CA204004, AEs leading to discontinuation (1 or more study drugs) occurred in 26.1 % of subjects 
in the E-Ld group and 26.8 in the Ld group. The type of events was also similar, with the most frequent 
occurring event (≥ 2%) of any grade in both treatment groups being disease progression (3.1% and 
1.3%). The proportion of subjects with Grade 3-4 was similar in both treatment groups (16.0% in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 96/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
E-Ld group and 15.8% in Ld group). Infections represented 3.5% in the E-Ld group and 4.1% in the Ld 
group of all AEs leading to discontinuation. Overall, there was no difference between treatment groups in 
the grade or type of infection leading to discontinuation.  
A similar pattern was observed in the E-Ld pooled population. 
CA204009 -E-Bd combination 
In study CA204009, 28% (n=21) of patients discontinued 1 or more study drugs due to AEs in the E-Bd 
group compared to 34.7% (n=26) in the Bd group. The most common grade 3-4 AEs leading to 
discontinuation (i.e., in ≥2 patients) in the E-Bd group were thrombocytopenia (2.7%, n=2) and diarrhoea 
(2.7%, n=2). In the Bd group these were pneumonia (4%, n=3), peripheral neuropathy (4%, n=3), 
paraesthesia (4%, n=3), and orthostatic hypotension (2.7%, n=2). A similar percentage of patients 
discontinued 1 or more study drugs to infections of any grade in the E-Bd and Bd groups (5.3%, n=4).

Not applicable. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety data of elotuzumab have been assessed from a total of 554 patients with multiple myeloma 
treated with elotuzumab in combination with lenaolidomide and dexamethasone (451 patients) or 
bortezomib and dexamethasone (103 patients) pooled across 6 clinical trials. The majority of adverse 
reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2)(SmPC section 4.8). 
Across the 2 randomized, controlled trials CA204004 and CA204009, the median duration of therapy was 
approximately 5 months longer in the elotuzumab arm compared with the control arms (19 cycles E-Ld vs 
14 cycles Ld; and 12 cycles E-Bd vs. 7 cycles Bd). In the E-Ld study, a similar relative dose intensity was 
observed for lenalidomide and dexamethasone in both treatment arms. In the E-Bd study, slightly less 
patients received ≥90% of the planned dexamethasone dose in the E-Bd arm (41.3% E-Bd vs 52% Bd), 
and similarly more dexamethasone dose modifications were observed (82.7% E-Bd vs. 68% Bd). The 
bortezomib dose intensity was similar between treatment arms, although more bortezomib dose 
reductions were observed in the E-Bd arm (48.6% vs. 39.2% Bd). 
In both pivotal studies, the frequency of discontinuation due to study drug toxicity (all study drugs) was 
similar between the elotuzumab and control arms, or even lower with elotuzumab (E-Bd setting). In study 
CA204004 (E-Ld) 2 patients discontinued study therapy with elotuzumab due to an infusion reaction and 
in study CA204009 (E-Bd) none did. In study CA204004, discontinuation of either one of the three 
products of the E-Ld therapy was low (overall 2%), similarly divided over the three treatments and were 
mostly the result of adverse events and are not considered to bias the results.  
In the first two cycles treatment was administered weekly and in subsequent cycles the time interval 
between doses was longer. Adverse events do accumulate over time, as would be expected to occur in a 
myeloma population, as seen in the Ld and Bd arms of the CA204004 and CA204009 studies, 
respectively. Overall, there is a steady accumulation of AEs over time in all arms of the studies presented, 
however, no added cumulative treatment effect can be demonstrated with elotuzumab. 
Adverse Events 
Almost all patients in the two pivotal trials experienced an AE. As expected, higher frequencies of grade 
3-4 AEs (78% E-Ld vs 66% Ld; 68% E-Bd vs 60% Bd) , and SAEs (65% E-Ld vs. 56% Ld; 47% E-Bd vs. 
41% Bd) were observed with the addition of elotuzumab to Ld or Bd. In the E-Ld regimen, haematological 
grade 3-4 AEs were most prominent (primarily lymphopenia and leukopenia), whereas in the E-Bd 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 97/110 
 
 
 
 
 
regimen non-hematological grade 3-4 AEs occurred with the highest frequency (mostly hyperglycaemia 
and diarrhoea).  
The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moderate (Grade 1 or 2). The most common adverse 
reactions (occurring in > 10% of patients) with elotuzumab treatment were cough, herpes zoster, 
nasopharyngitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection and weight decreased.  
With both regimens Grade 3-4 SAEs were observed >10% more frequent in the elotuzumab arm 
compared with Ld or Bd alone (48.1% E-Ld vs 36.6% Ld; and 37.3% E-Bd vs. 26.7% Bd). The most 
serious adverse reaction that may occur during elotuzumab treatment is pneumonia (SmPC section 4.8). 
For both Study CA204004 and CA204009, the majority of the most prevalent AEs and SAEs resolved. The 
median durations of events were generally similar between the arms.  
In study CA204004, more patients died in the control arm compared to the elotuzumab  arm, which is 
reassuring. However the signal for pulmonary infection observed with the grade 3-4 SAEs is also found in 
causes of death. In the E-Ld study, more patients died due to infection in the E-Ld arm compared with the 
Ld arm (2.2%, n=7 E-Ld vs. 0.6%, n=2 Ld). Of these infections, 4 in the E-Ld arm, and none in the Ld arm 
were related to the pulmonary tract. Overall, in study CA204004, among the deaths identified as “study 
drug toxicity”-related, infection was the most frequently reported cause; pulmonary embolism was 
reported as “study drug toxicity”-related cause of death with a similar proportion in the treatment groups. 
Of note, one case of death due to gastrointestinal tumour in the E-Ld group was classified under the term 
‘‘study drug toxicity”. 
Infections 
Multiple myeloma is associated with immune dysfunction, and elotuzumab may inhibit cellular 
components of the immune system, which both may increase the risk for infection. Apart from an increase 
in SAEs of infection (31% vs 25%) and deaths (n=7 vs n=2) due to infection in the E-Ld arm, a higher 
frequency of infection AEs (81% vs. 74%) and grade 3-4 AEs (28% vs. 24%) were observed. The 
imbalance in infection rate was most prominent in patients with prior stem cell transplant (87.4% E-Ld 
compared to 75.8% Ld: 12% difference), independent of the frequency of lymphopenia.  
These safety data indicated that infection is an important identified risk of elotuzumab treatment, which 
might be life-threatening. No measurable factor or characteristic was identified in the elotuzumab-treated 
population that could predict susceptibility to an infection. Most of the measurable factors were similar 
between the two study cohorts.  
A lower proportion of subjects with neutropenia were observed when elotuzumab was added to both Ld 
and Bd regimen compared to Ld and Bd groups (E-Ld vs. Ld: 33.6% vs. 43.7%; E-Bd vs. Bd: 4 subjects 
[5.5%] vs. 11 subjects [14.9%]). The similar rate of infections observed with elotuzumab in the 
exposure-adjusted analysis may have thus been driven by the unexplained higher rates of neutropenia in 
the control groups, but this remains unclear. 
Patients with prophylactic therapy had a lower frequency of infection than those without prophylactic 
anti-infective in both treatment arms, although the differences are small. There was also a reduction in 
the frequency of Grade 3-4 infections in both arms. No difference is seen in the time to first infection, and 
the duration of infection, across all arms, regardless of the presence of prophylaxis or treatment arm. It 
is acknowledged that these data could be confounded given that prophylaxis was not mandatory, and 
subjects at highest risk for infection were given antibacterial and/or antivirals. 
Patients should be monitored and infections should be managed with standard treatment (SmPC, section 
4.4). Infections have been classified as an important identified risk in the Risk Management Plan.

Infusion Reactions 
Nearly all mAbs including elotuzumab share a risk for standard infusion reactions (IRs). With the use of 
premedication, IRs occurred in approximately 10% of elotuzumab treated patients. They were usually 
mild to moderate and manageable using recommended guidelines for premedication. A faster infusion 
rate (up to 5 mL/min in subjects tolerating elotuzumab at 2 mL/min) did not affect the incidence of IRs or 
introduce new safety concerns. With the use of pre-medication no clinically meaningful immunogenicity to 
elotuzumab was observed with E-Ld and E-Bd treatment. 
Premedication consisting of dexamethasone, H1 blocker, H2 blocker, and paracetamol must be 
administered prior to Empliciti infusion (SmPC section 4.2). The rate of infusion reactions was much 
higher in patients who were not premedicated. In case of a Grade ≥ 2 infusion reaction, Empliciti infusion 
must be interrupted and appropriate medical and supportive measures instituted. Vital signs should be 
monitored every 30 minutes for 2 hours after the end of the Empliciti infusion. Once the reaction has 
resolved (≤ Grade 1) Empliciti can be restarted at the initial infusion rate of 0.5 mL per minute. If 
symptoms do not recur, the infusion rate may be gradually escalated every 30 minutes to a maximum of 
5 mL per minute (SmPC section 4.4). 
Anti-drug antibodies 
No safety concerns seem to arise from immunogenicity data. In CA204004 study the incidence of infusion 
reactions (IRs) among subjects with anti drug antibodies (ADA) (16% of 45 ADA positive subjects) is 
higher than in ADA negative subjects (9% of 254 ADA negative subjects  but were similar in the 
CA204009 study (5% of 20 ADA positive subjects vs 6% of 52 ADA negative subjects). A clear temporal 
or causal relationship to occurrence of ADAs and IRs cannot be established based on the limited data.  
Infusion reactions have been classified as an important identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Second Primary Malignancies 
The addition of elotuzumab to lenalidomide did slightly increase the occurrence of SPMs (6.9% E-Ld vs 
4.1% Ld), even when corrected for exposure duration. The imbalance was mostly caused by the 
occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, and for other SPMs no clear pattern in type was 
observed. Slightly more patients in the E-Ld arm were diagnosed with a SPM at study entry or had 
received prior melphalan treatment compared with the Ld arm, which might explain the imbalance. It is 
reassuring that the frequency of SPMs is in line with that observed in historical lenalidomide studies 
(7-8%). 
Second Primary Malignancies are known to be associated with lenalidomide exposure which was extended 
in patients treated with Empliciti combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone vs. lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone. The rate of haematologic malignancies was the same between the two treatment arms. 
Patients should be monitored for the development of SPMs (SmPC section 4.4). Second Primary 
Malignancies have been classified as an important identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reaction 
Across all the completed elotuzumab studies a total of 2 subjects have been reported with the AE of 
anaphylaxis/anaphylactic reaction. In study CA204004, 9 subjects in the E-Ld arm reported an AE of 
hypersensitivity, and 4 subjects in the Ld arm reported an AE of hypersensitivity. 
Cases of anaphylaxis were reported before the introduction of pre-medication. As anaphylaxis has a 
different underlying mechanism to what are known as standard infusion reactions, hypersensitivity and 
anaphylactic reaction have been classified as an important potential risk. 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 99/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Age 
In general, the safety profile of elotuzumab was similar between different age groups <65; ≥65 and <75; 
and ≥75 years of age in the E-Ld study, except for a higher frequency of SPMs in patients ≥65 years 
(n=18) compared with patients <65 (n=4) in the E-Ld arm. This imbalance was not observed in the LD 
arm, and might be caused by an imbalance in prior melphalan-containing regimens.  Apart from one 
patient treated with E-Ld in study CA204004, there are no data on patients aged ≥85 years. 
Renal Impairment 
In renal impairment study CA204007, the frequency of SAEs and IRs was higher for SRI (n=9) and ESRD 
(n=9) patients compared to patients with a normal renal function and the percentage of AEs and Grade 
3-4 AEs were balanced between the three subgroups. It can be taken into consideration that patients with 
severe  renal disease are likely to have more advanced myeloma and may be more likely to suffer adverse 
events. Also the numbers are small, hampering interpretation of safety results. No clinically important 
differences in the pharmacokinetics of elotuzumab were found between patients with severe renal 
impairment (with and without dialysis) and patients with normal renal function (SmPC section 5.2) and no 
dose adjustment of Empliciti is required for patients with mild (CrCl = 60   89 mL/min), moderate (CrCl = 
30   59 mL/min), severe (CrCl < 30 mL/min) renal impairment or end stage renal disease requiring 
dialysis (SmPC section 4.2). 
Hepatic Impairment 
No patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment have been included in elotuzumab studies. Thus, 
data about safety in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment is missing. This has been 
adequately reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.2, and 5.2) and is reflected in the Risk Management Plan. 
Safety in patients of Asian race 
In study CA204004, approximately 10% of subjects were of Asian race. Although safety by race subgroup 
analysis did not reveal any clinically meaningful differences by race, the number of subjects with Asian 
race was low and therefore safety in patients of Asian race has been added as missing information to the 
Risk Management Plan. More data on safety of administration in Asian population is expected after market 
authorization of Empliciti. 
Long term safety data 
No new safety concerns were identified in patients treated with E-Ld for > 24 months. However, updated 
safety data was requested and provided by the Applicant for studies CA204004 (additional 6 months of 
data since the initial MAA; database lock date 15 May 2015) and CA204009 (additional 7 months of data 
since the initial MAA) to better characterize the long-term safety profile of E-Ld. Based on this data, 
despite a longer duration of treatment and follow-up, AE frequencies remained substantially similar 
compared to those presented in the initial MAA. 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
On the basis of reported adverse reactions, Empliciti is not expected to influence the ability to drive or use 
machines. Patients experiencing infusion reactions should be advised not to drive and use machines until 
symptoms abate (SmPC section 4.7). 
Overdose 
One patient was reported to be overdosed with 23.3 mg/kg of elotuzumab in combination with 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone. The patient had no symptoms, did not require any treatment for the 
overdose, and was able to continue on elotuzumab therapy. In clinical studies, approximately 78 patients 
were evaluated with elotuzumab at 20 mg/kg without apparent toxic effects. In case of overdose, patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015

should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic 
treatment instituted (SmPC section 4.9). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC, section 4.8). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of elotuzumab when administered in the proposed therapeutic dose in combination with 
the Ld regimen does not appear to diverge from what expected based on the mechanism of action of the 
mAb and is generally manageable.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Empliciti (ELOTUZUMAB) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
To support the current application, two pivotal efficacy trials have been submitted. One was a phase 3, 
randomized, open-label study (CA204004) investigating the use of elotuzumab in combination with 
lenalidomide, (n=321), compared to Ld alone (n=325). The other was a Phase 2, open-label, randomized 
study (CA204009) of elotuzumab with bortezomib (n=77), compared to Bd alone (n=75), planned as a 
proof-of-concept study. The Applicant originally sought marketing authorization for the treatment of 
multiple myeloma (MM) as combination therapy in patients who have received one or more prior 
therapies but has modified this to limit the indication to the combination with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone in the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one 
prior therapy.  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The results of the CA204004 study, showed a statistically significant improvement in the co-primary 
endpoint of PFS for elotuzumab plus lenalidomide compared with lenalidomide alone(HR 0.68, 97.61% CI 
0.55, 0.83, p=0.0001) with a gain in median PFS of 4.2 months in favour of elotuzumab (18.5 months 
E-Ld vs. 14.3 months Ld). The PFS results were consistent across the majority of subgroups analysed with 
patients who were lenalidomide-experienced, had del17p or t(4;14) high risk cytogenetics at baseline, 
and patients ≥65 years of age demonstrating PFS improvement with elotuzumab. An objective response 
rate (co-primary endpoint) of 78.5% E-Ld vs 65.5% in the  Ld group, with a common odds ratio of 1.94 
supported the PFS results. 
Regarding the secondary variables the use of the combination of elotuzumab provides a positive benefit 
in terms of OS (43.7 months for E-Ld versus 39.6 months for Ld), median duration of response  (20.7 
months  for E-Ld versus 16.6 months for Ld group) and median TTNT (HR 0.62, 95%CI 0.49; 0.78). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Only one patient with >3 prior treatment lines was included in the study CA204004 which remains an 
uncertainty in the knowledge of the population who are likely to benefit from Empliciti.  Only 6% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015 
Page 103/110 
 
 
 
 
 
patients in study CA204004 had received prior lenalidomide treatment and no patients were refractory to 
lenalidomide and these uncertainties related to prior lenalidomide are mentioned in SmPC section 5.1. 
The benefit in ORR with E-Ld treatment was mostly obtained by a higher frequency of partial responses 
and very good partial responses. However, surprisingly, the number of complete responses was higher in 
the Ld arm (1.6% E-Ld vs. 5.8 Ld). This may be due to cross-interference detection of in the SPEP (serum 
protein electrophoresis) and SIFE (serum immunofixation electrophoresis) assays testing M protein 
levels. It is most relevant where a qualitative assessment of an M-protein peak using serum 
immunofixation electrophoresis (SIFE) is involved in the response assessment and could potentially have 
affected a minority of subjects (15%) in E-Ld study CA204004. This has been adequately reflected in the 
SmPC (see section 4.5). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Almost all patients in elotuzumab and control arm experienced an adverse event (AE). Higher frequencies 
of grade 3-4 AEs (78% E-Ld vs 66% Ld) , and serious AEs (65% E-Ld vs. 56% Ld;) were observed with 
the addition of elotuzumab to Ld. 
The frequency of discontinuation due to study drug toxicity (all study drugs) was similar between the 
elotuzumab and control arm. Two patients discontinued study therapy with elotuzumab due to an infusion 
reaction.  
In the E-Ld arm, similar relative dose intensity was observed for lenalidomide and dexamethasone in both 
treatment arms. Haematological grade 3-4 AEs were most prominent (primarily lymphopenia and 
leukopenia). 
A higher rate of Any Grade and Grade 3-4 deep vein thrombosis was observed in E-Ld group compared 
with Ld group (Any Grade: 7.2% vs. 3.8%; Grade 3-4: 5.7% vs. 2.2%). Grade 3-4 SAEs were 
observed >10% more frequent in the elotuzumab arm compared with Ld (48.1% E-Ld vs 36.6% Ld). With 
pneumonia being the most frequent reported Grade 3-4 SAE.  
Overall, more deaths (mostly due to disease progression) were observed in the control arm compared 
with the elotuzumab arm. However, more patients died due to infection in the E-Ld arm compared with 
the Ld arm (2.2%, n=7 E-Ld vs. 0.6%, n=2 Ld). Of these infections, 4 in the E-Ld arm, and none in the 
Ld arm were related to the pulmonary tract. Apart from an increase in deaths due to infection in the E-Ld 
arm, a higher frequency of infection AEs (81% vs. 74%), grade 3-4 AEs (28% vs. 24%) and SAEs of 
infection (31% vs 25%) was observed compared with the Ld arm.  
Infusion reactions (IRs) occurred in approximately 10% of elotuzumab treated patients. They were 
usually mild to moderate and manageable using recommended guidelines for premedication. 
The addition of elotuzumab to lenalidomide did slightly increase the occurrence of  secondary primary 
malignancies (SPMs; 6.9% E-Ld vs 4.1% Ld), even when corrected for exposure duration. 
In general, the safety profile of elotuzumab was similar between different age groups <65; ≥65 and <75; 
and ≥75 years of age in the E-Ld study, except for a higher frequency of SPMs in patients ≥65 years 
(n=18) compared with patients <65 (n=4) in the E-Ld arm. 
In renal impairment study CA204007, the frequency of SAEs and IRs was higher for patients with severe 
renal impairment (SRI) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to patients with a normal renal 
function. 
Assessment report  
EMA/129497/2015

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A higher frequency of AEs, SAEs and deaths due to infection was observed in the E-Ld arm of study 
Ca204004 compared to the Ld arm, indicating that infection is an important, and potentially fatal, 
identified risk. Despite a higher frequency of grade 3-4 lymphopenia detected with elotuzumab treatment 
(12-28% more frequent compared to control arms), this did not translate into a higher rate of infections.  
However, no measurable factor or characteristic was identified in the elotuzumab-treated population that 
could predict susceptibility to an infection.  Most of the measurable factors were similar between the two 
study cohorts.  
With the exception of Herpes zoster, the rates of opportunistic infections were similar between E-Ld and 
Ld. Additional data showed that subjects with prophylactic therapy had a lower frequency of infection than 
those without prophylactic anti-infective therapy in both treatment arms, although the differences are 
small. There was also a reduction in the frequency of Grade 3-4 infections in both arms. It is 
acknowledged that these data could be confounded given that prophylaxis was not mandatory, and 
subjects at highest risk for infection were given antibacterial and/or antivirals. This safety concern is 
addressed in section 4.4 of the SmPC and infections have been classified as an important identified risk in 
the Risk Management Plan. 
Data on the efficacy and safety of Elotuzumab in patients ≥ 85 years of age are very limited. This has 
been reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Although no safety concerns seem to arise from immunogenicity data, considering that IRs are a 
recognized risk with Elotuzumab, and may be related with ADAs, more data were  submitted. These data 
showed that, overall, the incidence of IRs among subjects with on-study ADA and persistent ADA is higher 
in the CA204004 study. It is acknowledged that the small numbers prevent from drawing definite 
conclusions on the interpretation of the relationship between IR and ADA. No substantial subset of 
patients with a higher risk of IR could be identified in study CA204004.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Most of the population investigated had had one or two prior therapies, and would be expected to still 
have other treatment options. However, the availability of a new treatment with a new mechanism of 
action and manageable adverse event profile is of importance in the treatment of MM which is 
characterised by relapse to successive therapies with an unmet medical need. 
In the pivotal E-Ld study a median PFS benefit of 4.2 months has been demonstrated for E-Ld (18.5 
months E-Ld vs. 14.3 months Ld)  in the ITT analysis. A PFS improvement of this size is of clinical 
relevance in these previously treated patients of whom 36% and 16% had had 2 or 3 prior lines of therapy 
respectively and of whom 35% were refractory to their last prior therapy. This was supported by 
favourable Time To Next Treatment data (HR 0.62, 95%CI 0.49; 0.78) and by an ORR benefit for the E-Ld 
combination with a rate of 78.5% for E-Ld compared to 65.5% for Ld, also of clinical relevance. However, 
the pain score and QoL endpoints in the E-Ld study did not show a difference between the two treatment 
arms. 
There appears to be a trend towards improved OS for E-Ld with higher survival rates compared to  Ld  at 
1 and 2 years, but survival data are immature and a benefit in OS cannot be concluded. 
The safety profile of elotuzumab when administered in the proposed therapeutic dose in combination with 
the Ld regimen does not appear to diverge from what expected based on the mechanism of action of the 
mAb. The safety profile of the E-Bd combination does not seem to differ significantly, in terms of type of 
AEs, from that observed for the combination of elotuzumab with Ld. Generally the adverse event profile, 
including infusion reactions, was manageable for both combinations and did not require support with 
growth factors or platelet / erythrocyte  transfusions. Although adverse events did lead to discontinuation 
of study treatments in approximately 25% to 30% of patients, in the pivotal studies for both E-Ld and 
E-Bd  the rate of these discontinuations was not higher in the elotuzumab arms compared to the 
comparator arms. 
Benefit-risk balance 
For the E-Ld combination a relevant improvement in PFS is considered to be present, supported by 
(preliminary) OS data and improvement in ORR.  
Safety appears manageable, although in particular infections remain a point of concern. In view of the 
effect in terms of PFS and ORR, the coherent evidence from secondary efficacy endpoints and the lack of 
significant uncertainty in terms of efficacy or safety, the toxicity profile is considered acceptable. 
The benefit-risk balance for elotuzumab for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have 
received at least one prior therapy is considered positive.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Efficacy of E-Ld was maintained in patients with up to 3 prior lines of therapy, the population studied in 
study CA204004. In patients treated with E-Ld, the median PFS was similar in patients with 1, 2 or 3 prior 
lines of therapy. Median overall survival was similar in patients with 1 or 2 prior lines of therapy and 
somewhat lower in those with 3 prior lines. Importantly, the benefit in PFS and in OS compared to Ld 
increased in those with 3 prior lines, justifying it’s use in those with more advanced disease. Also in 
patients with refractory disease, there was clear median PFS benefit of approximately 6 months.

In patients with lower risk disease, specifically patients not refactory to prior treatment and those in 
IMWG standard risk category, PFS benefit was also evident. The median PFS benefit of E-Ld compared to 
Ld was approximately 3 months, approximately 1 month less than in the overall population. 
In patients who had not had prior IMiD therapy (no lenalidomide or thalidomide) the PFS benefit of E-Ld 
compared to Ld (approximately 1.4 months) was lower than in the overall population and was higher in 
patients who had received prior thalidomide therapy (approximately 6 months). However, the 
thalidomide-exposed population, which represented approximately 50% of included patients,  is likely to 
be very heterogeneous with regard to the nature and extent of the prior thalidomide therapy. It cannot be 
excluded that the higher efficacy observed in the IMiD exposed population (principally thalidomide 
exposed as only 6% of patients had prior lenalidomide exposure) might have been driven by patients with 
long-term exposure or who have become refractory to thalidomide. 
Information is included in SmPC Section 5.1 on the PFS and HR in the subgroups of those who had prior 
IMiD (Thal) and no prior IMiD, refractory and not refractory patients, and those with high risk and 
standard risk MM.   
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Empliciti is not similar to Thalidomide Celgene, Revlimid, 
Imnovid, Farydak and Kyprolis within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
847/200 (see Appendix 1). 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Empliciti indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone for 
the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy is 
favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:  
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP considers 
that elotuzumab is qualified as a new active substance.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Medicinal product 
Clopidogrel belongs to the pharmacotherapeutic group of platelet aggregation inhibitors excluding 
heparin, ATC Code: B01AC-04.  Clopidogrel is a prodrug, which is converted to its active metabolite by 
CYP450 enzymes, mainly CYP2C19. The mode of action is through irreversible antagonism at the platelet 
P2Y12 receptor, blocking binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to the receptor and thereby inhibiting 
platelet aggregation 
Clopidogrel is approved for the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with non-ST-
segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial 
infarction who are to be managed medically. Clopidogrel should be administered in combination with

acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in these indications. In patients with established peripheral arterial disease or 
with a history of recent myocardial infarction or recent ischemic stroke, clopidogrel is indicated as 
monotherapy. 
Problem statement 
Stroke is clinically defined according to the World Health Organization as the sudden onset of focal 
neurological deficits of presumed vascular origin in patients with vascular risk factors that last more than 
24 hours. Brain imaging exams like a brain computerized tomography or Brain resonance imaging can 
help to the diagnosis and define the area of ischemic damage. Neurological deficits resulting from 
ischemic stroke can be quantified using a clinical score. The most used clinical score is the National 
Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Patients are usually considered to have a minor stroke when the 
NIHSS score is equal or less than 4.  
A transient ischemic attack (TIA) refers to the sudden onset of neurological deficits of presumed vascular 
origin that last less than 24 hours. It is a clinical diagnosis. There is currently some discussion regarding if 
patients that have symptoms that last less than 24 hours and have brain lesions in a brain imaging 
exams qualify as a TIA or minor stroke. This highlights the continuum between acute ischemic stroke 
(AIS) and TIA.  
Stroke constitutes a major health concern world-wide. According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 
Study 2016, the estimated global lifetime risk of stroke from the age of 25 years onward is approximately 
25% in both men and women, with ischemic stroke accounting for three quarters of this risk. Regionally, 
the highest estimated lifetime risks are seen in East Asia, Central Europe, and Eastern Europe. Patients 
who have suffered AIS or TIA are at increased risk of recurrent stroke. The risk of stroke of recurrence is 
highest within the first two weeks after a TIA or stroke. Estimates from historical cohorts found a risk of 
new stroke and other vascular events at 90 days of 12% to 20%. The TIA registry.org international 
collaboration estimated a 1-year risk of recurrent stroke of approximately 5% (Kaplan-Meier estimate), 
with the majority of the risk pertaining to the first 30-90 days after the initial event.  The lower event 
rates from more recent data may be explained by earlier implementation of secondary stroke prevention 
strategies (e.g., immediate initiation of antiplatelet drugs, oral anticoagulation if atrial fibrillation, urgent 
revascularization in patients with critical carotid stenosis, and other secondary prevention measures such 
as treatment with statins and blood pressure–lowering medicines).  
The ABCD2 score is usually used in clinical practice to help to calculate the risk of stroke recurrence in 
TIA patients. The ABCD2 score is a clinical score that is used to calculate the risk of stroke on the basis of 
age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of TIA, and presence or absence of diabetes, with scores 
ranging from 0 to 7. Patients with a score equal or higher than 4 are at highest risk of stroke recurrence 
and should be admitted to the hospital to rapidly undergo etiological investigation.  
Rationale for the use of clopidogrel in AIS and high-risk TIA 
There are different causes of ischemic stroke or TIA. The most common stroke etiological classification 
that is used in clinical practice is the TOAST classification. This classification divides stroke etiologies in 
five main subgroups: cardioembolic, large vessels disease, small vessels disease, other determined (i.e. 
dissections, vasculitis) and undetermined causes. When patients present with a cardioembolic stroke or 
TIA related to atrial fibrillation or mechanic heart valves, anticoagulants should be used for secondary

stroke prevention. Antiplatelets are used for prevention of stroke recurrence in the remaining stroke 
etiologies. The early administration of ASA, within 24 to 48 hours after onset of AIS, is recommended 
standard practice for patients with presumed non-cardioembolic stroke. 
The safety and benefit of ASA in patients with AIS were established by two placebo-controlled clinical trials 
administering daily doses between 160 and 300 mg/day. The findings were confirmed by a Cochrane review 
of ASA clinical trials. In patients with non-cardioembolic AIS, ASA is associated to an approximately 20% 
reduction in the rate of recurrent stroke. This value of efficacy is maintained across a wide range of doses. 
However, the risk of hemorrhage increases with higher doses of ASA. A low dose of 75-150 mg/day is 
therefore usually prescribed for chronic use in clinical practice. 
Alternative antiplatelet agents, in particular the P2Y12 receptor antagonists clopidogrel, prasugrel, and 
ticagrelor have been studied in patients with AIS. Clopidogrel was originally approved based on the 
results from the CAPRIE study. This study included patients with atherothrombosis as manifested by 
recent myocardial infarction, recent ischemic stroke or established peripheral arterial disease. Clopidogrel 
75 mg/day significantly reduced the incidence of the composite outcome, when compared to ASA 325 
mg/day. Benefit of clopidogrel versus ASA could not be shown specifically for the subgroup of patients 
with recent ischemic stroke. 
In the PRoFESS study, clopidogrel was tested versus low-dose ASA plus extended release dipyramidole in 
patients with non-cardioembolic stroke. Very similar stroke recurrence rates were observed in both 
treatment arms, but non-inferiority of clopidogrel as monotherapy could not be formally demonstrated.  
Dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) with ASA and a P2Y12 antagonist can confer synergistic efficacy on the 
inhibition of platelet aggregation. The benefit of DAPT versus ASA alone on the composite endpoint of 
cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke has been demonstrate in several clinical trials in 
patients with ACS. DAPT in ACS is part of the approved use of all marketed P2Y12 antagonists. 
Clopidogrel and ASA are used together after coronary, carotid, and intracranial stenting, and appear to be 
well tolerated. 
Clopidogrel has been studied in combination with aspirin in several trials of vascular disease, including 2 
that included patients with stroke or TIA. Although results from these trials have not supported long-term 
use of clopidogrel combined with aspirin after stroke/TIA, the drug has never been tested as an acute 
therapy in this population; and the trials support that it may be more beneficial and particularly safe after 
minor stroke or TIA.  
Early implementation of DAPT with clopidogrel plus ASA in selected patients with AIS or high-riskTIA may 
be beneficial for stroke prevention. Combination therapy with clopidogrel and ASA may provide greater 
protection against subsequent stroke than aspirin alone. This is an application for a type II variation, 
seeking to extend the indication for clopidogrel in combination with ASA, to patients with recent onset 
(within 24 hours) of minor NIHSS ≤3 AIS or high-risk ABCD2 score ≥4 TIA, to reduce the risk of 
recurrent stroke.

Phase I: Estimation of Exposure 
Screening for Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity 
A study to determine the octanol:water partition coefficient according to OECD TG 107, has been 
referenced. Log Kow = 3.76 and the ion-corrected log Dow was calculated on the range of 3.2 (pH=5), 
1.5 (pH=7) to -0.49 (pH=9).  
Regarding the PBT assessment Clopidogrel does not meet the B-trigger (BCF≥2000)  
Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) 
The PECSURFACEWATER was calculated using a DOSEai of 300 mg and the Fpen value of 1%:PEC = 
DOSEai x Fpen / WASTEWinhab x D x 100 = 0.515 μg/L. 
Environmental fate/effects estimation 
Phase II, Tier A 
The fate and effects studies were evaluated when the clopidogrel / acetylsalicylic acid fixed – dose 
combination was authorized (2010). It could be concluded that Clopidogrel is not biodegradable, 
reversibly bind to organic material is completely transformed in water layer / sediment extract on day 
104. The transformation product (>10%) of parent concentration is SR26334, a pharmacologically 
inactive metabolite likely to be a hydrolytic degradation product and carboxylic acid derivative of 
clopidogrel. The fish is the most sensitive species in the aquatic effect studies, it does not bio concentrate 
in fish organism and not demonstrate bacterial activity. The evaluation of BCF expressed on a 5% lipid 
content basis is calculated to be 358 mg/L for the whole fish. The BCF values do not indicate any 
likelihood of significant bioconcentration of clopidogrel in the environment. 
Phase II Tier B 
PEC calculation for sediment 
PECsediment, expressed on a dry weight basis (µg/kgdw) is calculated using equilibrium partitioning and 
REACH (EUSES) equations with characteristics for suspended matter. A Koc of 3020 L/kg was used as

well as a PECsurface water = 0.515 µg/L. The result is a PECsediment = 34.21 µg/kg. The PNECsediment 
was normalised to 10% organic carbon (o.c. sediment content of the test was 2.5%).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of clopidogrel are fully described in the approved product information [Plavix 
SmPC].  This  description  includes  information  on  the  impact  of  CYP2C19  metabolizer  status  on  the 
transformation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. The available data are considered fully applicable to 
the intended new target population, especially as clopidogrel for its currently approved use was investigated 
in populations that included a majority of elderly subjects with co-morbid cardiovascular conditions. No new 
PK data have been generated for this application. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657331/2020 
Page 12/71 
 
 
 
 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  activity  of  clopidogrel,  through  its  active  metabolite,  as  an  irreversible 
antagonist  at  the  platelet  P2Y12  ADP  receptor  is  adequately  summarized  in  the  approved  product 
information [Plavix SmPC]. No new PD data have been generated for this application. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
A maintenance dose of clopidogrel of 75 mg/day provides steady state levels of the active metabolite that 
result in an average inhibition of platelet aggregation between 40% and 60%. The 75 mg/day dose is the 
approved maintenance dose for all current indications [Plavix  SmPC]. It  was  also the maintenance dose 
investigated in the studies pertinent to the current application. 
In order to achieve faster onset of platelet aggregation inhibition, a loading dose of clopidogrel is used. A 
single 300 mg dose on the first day of treatment is currently recommended in the approved indications for 
clopidogrel when used as a component of DAPT. A number of clinical trials in patients within the spectrum 
of  ACS  have  investigated  a  higher  loading  dose  of  clopidogrel  of  600  mg  and  shown  that  this  may  be 
associated  with  increased  early  PD  effects  and  a  lower  risk  of  recurrent  cardiovascular  events,  without 
increasing the risk of haemorrhage. The higher loading dose is included as a treatment option in current 
consensus guidelines for the management of ACS. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No biopharmaceutical data specific to the intended new indication is being submitted. Marketed formulations 
of clopidogrel were used in the two clinical trials supporting this application [CHANCE (NCT00979589) and 
POINT  (NCT00991029)].  Furthermore,  no  new  pharmacokinetic  or  pharmacodynamic  data  have  been 
generated for this application. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK/PD information for clopidogrel is considered sufficient, and applicable to the intended new target 
population. The maintenance dose of 75 mg/day was used also in studies of patients with AIS or high-risk 
TIA, and is very well established regarding efficacy and safety for use within DAPT with concomitant ASA 
in patients with ACS. The clinical trials supporting this application variably used loading doses of 300 mg 
or 600 mg. The choice of loading dose is further discussed below (please refer to efficacy and safety 
evaluation).

Methods 
A Multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial to assess the effects of a 3-month regimen 
of clopidogrel initiated with a loading dose (LD) of 300 mg followed by 75 mg/day during the first 21 days 
versus a 3-month regimen of ASA 75 mg/day alone on reducing the 3-month risk of any new stroke (both 
ischemic and hemorrhagic, primary outcome) when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset in high-risk 
patients with TIA or minor stroke.

Treatments 
General study design 
The general study design is outlined in the figure 1 below:

Figure 1 – General study design for the CHANCE trial  
Study treatment and study dose 
The first dose of study medication was given within 24 hours of symptom onset. Patients were 
randomized into 2 groups: the first group received an oral 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel on the day 
of randomization, followed by oral clopidogrel 75 mg/day from day 2 to 3 months. Oral ASA was given in 
a total dose ranging between 75 and 300 mg (open label with dose determined by the treating physician) 
on the first day, followed by blinded 75 mg once a day from day 2 to 21. Between day-21 and 3-month 
visits, ASA 75 mg was replaced by a placebo of ASA 75 mg. The second group received open-label aspirin 
in a total dose ranging between 75 and 300 mg on the first day, followed by 75 mg once a day from day 
2 to 3 months. A placebo for clopidogrel was given from the day of randomization until the 3-month visit. 
Study visits were performed on the day of randomization, at day 21, and at day 90.  
Objectives 
Primary objective: assess the effects of the two treatment regimens on the incidence of stroke in the first 
90 days after acute minor stroke or high-risk TIA. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of patients with new stroke (ischemic or 
hemorrhage) at 3 months. 
The Secondary efficacy outcomes were: 
- Percentage of composite of any stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death within 3 months 
-  Percentage  of  patients  at  3  months  with  new  clinical  vascular  events  (ischemic  stroke/hemorrhagic 
stroke/TIA/myocardial infarction/vascular death) as a cluster and evaluated individually. 
- mRS score changes (continuous) and dichotomized at percentage with score 0 to 2 versus 3 to 6 at 3-
month follow-up; 
- Impairment (changes in NIHSS scores at 3-month follow-up). 
- EQ-5D. 
- Efficacy endpoint were also to be analyzed stratified by etiologic subtypes (nonintracranial artery 
diseases vs intracranial artery diseases), by time randomization (<12 vs ≥12 hours), by qualifying 
event (TIA vs minor stroke), and by age (<65 years and ≥65 years). 
The primary safety outcome was a moderate-to-severe bleeding event, according to the Global 
Utilization  of  Streptokinase  and  Tissue  Plasminogen  Activator  for  Occluded  Coronary  Arteries  (GUSTO) 
definition. Severe hemorrhage was defined as fatal or intracranial hemorrhage or other hemorrhage causing 
hemodynamic  compromise  that  required  blood  or  fluid  replacement,  inotropic  support,  or  surgical 
intervention. Moderate hemorrhage was defined as bleeding that required transfusion of blood but did not 
lead to hemodynamic compromise requiring intervention.

Sample size 
The minimum necessary sample size in the trial was established by the requirement to detect the 
smallest expected, clinically meaningful treatment difference comparing the treatment with placebo. Based 
on the pooled Northern California and Oxfordshire cohort study and FASTER trial, the 90-day risk of the 
stroke recurrence risk in placebo (ASA) group was 14% among high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score >4) or minor 
stroke patients treated with ASA within 24 hours of symptom onset. A relative risk reduction of 22% was 
the smallest difference that was attempted to detect.  
A sample size of 5100 patients, has got a have 90% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 22% with 
a 2-sided α of 0.05 and 5% dropouts (medication nonadherence).  
Randomisation 
Patients meeting the enrollment criteria were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups with 
the use of a double-blind, double-dummy design. 
Randomization was conducted by computer system (IVRS) and a randomization code was generated on 1st 
day after enrollment.  
The site investigator called into an automated system that randomly assigned a number corresponding to 
a medication kit stored at the study site, and the medication in the kit was administered to the patient. 
Blinding (masking) 
CHANCE was a double-blind, placebo controlled trial.  
75mg  clopidogrel  and  placebo  tablet  used  in  this  study  were  indistinguishable  (identical  on  size,  shape, 
color and appearance). 
25/50 mg ASA and placebo tablet used in this study were indistinguishable (identical on size, 
shape, color and appearance). 
The study staff, including the investigators, and patients were blinded to the study treatment. Unblinding 
by the investigator  was only to  occur if the  patient had a  serious adverse event  for which unblinding of 
study drug information was very important for treatment. In such a case, details of the unblinding were to 
be recorded in written form. 
Statistical methods 
The primary null hypothesis of this trial was: in patients with TIA or minor ischemic stroke treated with ASA 
75 mg/day, there was no difference in 90-day risk of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) in those treated 
with  a  3-month  regimen  of  clopidogrel  initiated  with  a  loading  dose  of  300  mg  followed  by  75  mg/day 
compared with placebo when therapy was initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset. 
The primary analysis was intention to treat, with inclusion determined by receipt of first study drug dose. 
Missing values were to remain missing, and patients were censored at their last follow-up assessment (time 
of clinical event, end of study, or last visit before loss to follow-up).  
Reports were planned of Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative risk of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) 
event during maximum 90-day follow-up, with hazards ratios and 95% CI calculated using Cox proportional

Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results: 
Primary endpoint: Stroke occurred in 212 patients (8.2%) in the clopidogrel-ASA group, as compared 
with 303 patients (11.7%) in the ASA group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 
0.81; P <0.001). Fatal or disabling stroke occurred in 135 patients (5.2%) in the clopidogrel-ASA group 
and in 177 (6.8%) in the ASA group (hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.94; P = 0.01).  
Secondary endpoint:  
The composite outcome of vascular events occurred in 216 patients (8.4%) in the clopidogrel-ASA group, 
as  compared  with  307  patients  (11.9%) in the  ASA  group  (HR:0.69;  95%  CI, 0.58  to  0.82;  P  <0.001), 
(Figure 3).  
Ischemic stroke occurred in 204 patients (7.9%) in the clopidogrel-ASA group and in 295 (11.4%) in the 
ASA group (HR:0.67; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.81; P <0.001).  
Hemorrhagic stroke occurred in 8 patients in each of the two study groups (0.3% of each group) (HR1.01; 
95%CI 0.38 to2.70; p=0.98). 
Death from any cause occurred in 0.4% of the patients in each group. Vascular death (including death from 
hemorrhagic stroke) occurred in 6 patients (0.2%) in the clopidogrel-ASA group and in 5 (0.2%) in the ASA 
group (HR: 1.16; 95% CI, 0.35 to 3.79; P=0.81). 
TIA  occurred  in  39  patients  (1.5%)  in  the  clopidogrel-ASA  group  and  in  47  (1.8%)  in  the  ASA  group 
(HR:0.82; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.26; P=0.36).

Methods 
Study participants 
Patients of 18 years of age or older with high-risk TIA (ABCD2≥4) or minor ischemic stroke (NIHSS ≤3) 
randomized within 12 hours of the time patients were last known to be free of new ischemic symptoms.  
Patients were enrolled from 350 sites in 10 countries (Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, 
New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, and the US). 82.8% were enrolled in the US. 
A certified, trained licensed physician investigator was required to confirm the diagnosis of TIA (traditional 
definition) or minor ischemic stroke and to calculate the ABCD2 score and NIHSS score.  
Inclusion criteria: 
•  Neurologic deficit (based on history or exam) attributed to focal brain ischemia and 
EITHER: 
- High risk TIA: complete resolution of the deficit at the time of randomization AND ABCD2 score ≥4, 
OR 
- Minor ischemic stroke: residual deficit with NIHSS ≤3 at the time of randomization. 
•  Ability to randomize within 12 hours of the time patients were last known to be free of new ischemic 
symptoms. 
•  Head CT or MRI ruling out hemorrhage or other pathology, such as vascular malformation, tumor, 
or abscess that could explain symptoms or contraindicate therapy. 
•  Ability to tolerate aspirin at a dose of 50 to 325 mg/day. 
Exclusion criteria 
•  Age <18 years. 
• 
• 
• 
TIA symptoms limited to isolated numbness, isolated visual changes, or isolated dizziness/vertigo.

Patients  who  met  the  enrolment  criteria  were  randomly  assigned  in  a  1:1  ratio  to  1  of  the  2 treatment 
groups (clopidogrel + ASA group or ASA alone group). Randomization was stratified according to clinical 
centre.  
The  clopidogrel  +  ASA  group  received  a  loading  dose  of  600  mg  clopidogrel,  followed  by  75 mg/day 
clopidogrel from Day 2 to Day 90. The ASA alone group received 8 placebo tablets followed by 1 placebo 
tablet daily from Day 2 to Day 90. Both groups were given open-label ASA 50 to 325 mg/day as per the 
investigator's discretion: a dose of 162 mg daily for 5 days followed by the recommended 81 mg daily dose 
that was suggested in the protocol. The first dose of study drug was given as soon after randomization as 
possible,  but  no  later  than  12  hours  from  symptom  onset.  Each  patient  was  followed  for  90  days  from 
randomization.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of POINT was to determine the effectiveness of clopidogrel (at a loading dose of 
600 mg followed by 75 mg/day orally) over placebo when initiated within 12 hours of time last known 
free of new ischemic symptoms in patients receiving ASA therapy at 50 to 325 mg/day. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy measure was the composite event of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), 
or ischemic vascular death within 90 days.  
The  primary  safety  outcome  was  major  hemorrhage.  This  variable  was  defined  as  symptomatic 
intracranial hemorrhage, intraocular bleeding causing vision loss, transfusion of 2 or more units of red cells 
or an equivalent amount of whole blood, hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, or 
death due to hemorrhage. 
The secondary outcomes for efficacy/net-benefit included: 
  Composite event of ischemic stroke, MI, or ischemic vascular death, or major hemorrhage 
 
 
Ischemic stroke 
Ischemic vascular death 
  Myocardial infarction 
  Composite event of ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke 
  Other secondary safety/tolerability outcomes included: 
  All-cause death 
  Hemorrhagic stroke 
  Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage 
  Other symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (subarachnoid hemorrhage [SAH], subdural 
 
hemorrhage [SDH], or intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH]) 
  Major hemorrhage other than intracranial hemorrhage 
 
 All minor hemorrhage (including asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage)

Sample size 
The minimum necessary sample size in the trial was established by the requirement to detect the 
smallest  expected,  clinically  meaningful,  treatment  difference  comparing  the  treatment  with  placebo.  A 
relative risk reduction (RRR) of 23% was the smallest difference felt to be of clinical importance. 
The  initially  defined  total  sample  size  for  the  study  was  4150  patients  (rounded  up  from  4142).  With  a 
sample size of 4150 patients, with 530 events, the study had 90% power to detect a RRR of 23% with a 
two-sided alpha of 0.05. The sample size was estimated based on a hazard ratio [HR] of 0.75 (equivalent 
to RRR of 23%) assuming an exponential survival distribution (assuming the proportion of patients with 
events in the placebo group was 0.1524 at 90 days), with inflation to account for two interim analysis for 
efficacy at equal intervals using O'Brien and Fleming stopping boundary using the Lan-Demets spending 
function and inflation for lost-to-follow-up and/or crossover. 
The  intention-to-treat  (ITT)  principle  was  applied  to  the  analysis  and  the  sample  size  was  inflated  to 
safeguard against lost-to-follow-up and/or crossover in the actual treatment received, which would dilute 
the effect size. From the FASTER (Fast Assessment of Stroke and Transient ischemic attack to prevent Early 
Recurrence) trial there were 12% crossovers and 2% losses to follow-up. Most events were expected to 
occur early in the follow-up period and hence a smaller fraction of events would be lost and a smaller total 
correction in sample size was required (5.0%).  
Based on the observed event rate in the placebo + ASA group at the first interim analysis, the sample was 
increased  to  5840  patients  to  provide  the  study  with  a  power  of  80%  with  other  variables  remaining 
unchanged in the calculation. 
Randomisation 
Randomization took place centrally and electronically via the WebDCU™ clinical trials management system 
housed at the POINT Statistics and Data Coordinating Center at MUSC. 
Patients were randomized 1:1 (clopidogrel + ASA : placebo + ASA), balanced within clinical centers using 
the blocked-urn method. The randomization computer program made the treatment assignment based on 
the current status of treatment group distribution within each clinical center as well as overall balance of 
treatment assignment. 
A  “Real-Time”  randomization  procedure  was  implemented  via  the  WebDCU™  system  where  the  clinical 
center  staff  entered  the  eligibility  information  of  a  subject  prior  to  enrollment.  If  the  subject’s  eligibility 
status  was  confirmed,  the  computer  program  on  the  WebDCU™  server  evaluated  the  treatment  arm 
distribution  and  generated  a  study  number  based  on  the  randomization  scheme.  The  study  number 
corresponded to a specific medication bottle already at the clinical center. 
Blinding (masking) 
The POINT study used a double-blind design. The 75-mg clopidogrel and placebo tablets used in this study 
were indistinguishable (identical taste, size, shape, color, and appearance). The study staff, including the 
investigators, and patients were blinded to the study treatment. Unblinding by the investigator was only to 
occur in an emergency need for unblinding. In such a case, details of the unblinding were to be recorded.

Statistical methods 
The primary null hypothesis was that, in patients with TIA or minor ischemic stroke treated with aspirin 50 
to 325 mg/day, there is no difference in the event-free survival at 90 days in those treated with clopidogrel 
(600 mg loading dose then 75 mg/day) compared with placebo when patients are randomized within 12 
hours of time last known free of new ischemic symptoms. 
The log-rank test was used to compare the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any given 
endpoint. A Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the HR and 95% CIs. There was no 
adjustment  for  baseline  covariates  or  for  the  ASA  dose  in  the  primary  efficacy  or  safety  analyses. 
Interactions between treatment assignment and pre-specified subgroups were evaluated in the Cox model. 
A P value<0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. A stratified Cox model was used according 
to  the  timepoint  to  perform  a  secondary  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  and  primary  safety  outcomes 
comparing the treatment effect during four time periods: Days 0 to 7 versus Days 8 to 90 and days 0 to 
30 versus Days 31 to 90. 
Secondary efficacy outcome analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons and are considered to be 
exploratory.  A  post  hoc  Bonferroni  calculation  was  made  for  reference  purposes  to  derive  an  adjusted 
threshold for P values to account for multiple comparisons of secondary outcomes. 
 Unplanned secondary analysis 
The absolute number of events was estimated using the life-table method for the following time periods: 
1st week, 2nd week, 3rd week, 4th week, 5th week, and 6th week to 90 days. The effective sample size 
for each time period was calculated as the sample size at the start of the time interval minus one half the 
number of patients censored in the time interval. The absolute difference in proportions (ASA alone minus 
clopidogrel-aspirin) was calculated for each time period. The HR was evaluated at the midpoint of the 7-
day intervals using the life-table method. Ischemic events with a binary treatment group indicator Z1 and 
a time-dependent indicator function in which Z2(t) = (Z1 if t > T and 0 if t ≤ T), where t is time in days 
and T is the cut point of the relative risk. To determine the optimal cut point for the piecewise proportional 
hazard model, a model with a cut point at every day from 7 to 45 days was used, and the optimal cut point 
was the day in which the partial log-likelihood was maximized. 
A  post  hoc,  exploratory  analysis  was  conducted  to  estimate  the  treatment  effect  modeling  a  range  of 
potential initiation times beyond 12 hours from symptom onset. All events through the optimal duration of 
treatment (21 days) were included in the analysis. By assuming that there was no accumulated benefit of 
antiplatelet effect, the treatment effect was modeled as follows: for each patient, the time from index event 
(TIA or minor stroke) onset to major ischemic events or censoring was derived. Beginning at 12 hours after 
onset, for every 6-hour period up to 168 hours (1 week), events and censoring time were left-truncated if 
the  event  or  censoring  occurred  before  the  given  time  period  by  removing  the  participant  from  the 
numerator (event count) and the denominator (number at risk set) before calculating the proportion for 
each group. The absolute difference in proportions of events was calculated for each treatment group along 
the 95% (Wald) confidence intervals. The same approach was used to model major hemorrhage. 
Interim analysis.  
Two  interimanalyses  were  planned.  Enrollment  in  the  POINT  study  was  prematurely  stopped  after 
approximately  83%  of  the  planned  number  of  patients  had  been  randomized.  Of  these  patients,  4782 
Assessment report

(98.0%) had been followed for at least 7 days, and 4557 (93.4%) had completed the 90-day trial visit or 
had died. The Data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) determined that the treatment effect observed 
had crossed the significance boundary for efficacy during an interim analysis.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 5 – Chart Flow of patients included in the POINT study 
Discontinuation of the study medication occurred in 29.6% of the patients in the group receiving clopidogrel 
+ aspirin and in 27.5% of those receiving placebo + aspirin. Rates of withdrawal from the study or loss to 
follow-up were 6.4% in the group receiving clopidogrel+ aspirin and 6.9% in the placebo + aspirin group. 
Recruitment 
Enrollment to the POINT study was prematurely stopped, as advised by the DSMB after approximately 83% 
of  the  planned  number  of  patients  had  been  randomized.  At  this  time  the  DSMB  recommended  halting 
enrollment because of confirmation of significant excess in the number of patients with major haemorrhage 
in the DAPT group. At the same time, a planned analysis determined that a treatment effect had crossed 
the significance boundary for efficacy.

Conduct of the study 
Time until primary analysis censoring data 
4782 patients (98.0%) were followed for at least 7 days, and 4557 (93.4%) completed the 90-day trial 
visit or died. 
Protocol deviations 
The frequency of protocol deviations per type is shown in Table 9.  
Table 9 – Protocol deviations per type in the POINT study 
In addition, data of 9 patients were removed from the clinical database due to the lack of documentation 
of informed consent. 
One patient was re-enrolled. Only the data associated with the first enrollment was used in the primary 
analysis. 
Five  patients  were  randomized  to  clopidogrel  and  received  placebo.  Four  patients  were  randomized  to 
placebo and received clopidogrel. 
Treatment compliance  
Compliance with the study medication was assessed via the Morisky questionnaire at Days 7 and 90, and 
event  phone  call  or  in-person  visit.  The  4-question  Morisky  scale  is  a  commonly  used  and  validated 
adherence measure. A patient was considered compliant with the study medication if he/she reported at 
least  medium  compliance  on  the  study  adherence  questionnaire.  The  Investigator  was  responsible  for 
monitoring patient adherence.  
In  addition,  compliance  with  the  study  drug  was  documented  at  the  90-day  visit.  Those  patients  taking 
Assessment report

more than 80% of tablets on Days 2 to 90 (ie, 71 or more tablets) were considered adherent as assessed 
by pill count and patient/care-giver report. Since the loading dose was observed by the study Investigator 
or other member of the study team, patients were considered to be in compliance with the loading dose. 
Therefore, a patient was adherent if he/she took at least 79 tablets (8 at loading dose + 71 on Days 2 to 
90). 
In the clopidogrel + aspirin group, 76.3% of the study drug was taken by an overall of 2140 patients, while 
77.8% of drug was taken in the placebo + aspirin group by an overall of 2164 patients. 
Protocol amendments 
The following changes were done to the planned analyses: 
Sample Size Increase: Following the first interim analysis, the maximum sample size was re-estimated 
to be 5840 patients. 
Trial  Discontinuation:  In  August  2017,  the  pre-specified  boundary  for  a  safety  signal  of  major 
hemorrhage was exceeded. It was decided to follow these events until a planned meeting of the DSMB in 
December  2017.  At  that  meeting,  the  board  recommended  halting  enrollment  to  the  trial  because  of 
confirmation  of  a  significant  excess  in  the  number  of  patients  with  major  hemorrhage  in  the  combined 
antiplatelet group, and a planned analysis determined that a treatment effect had crossed the significance 
boundary for efficacy.  
There were 5 amendments to the protocol, of which 1 was introduced before the inclusion of any patients. 
The changes introduced by these amendments applied to all patients.  
Baseline data 
Demographic and patient characteristics at baseline were generally similar between treatments 
Arms (Table 10). The median age was 65 years in both treatment groups, and 45.1% of patients 
were women in the clopidogrel + ASA group versus 44.8% in the placebo + ASA group.

Medical  history  was  similar  between  treatment  groups  (Table  11).  The  most  frequent  event  in  both 
treatment groups was hypertension (69.6% in the clopidogrel + aspirin group and 68.5% in the placebo + 
aspirin group).

Concomitant medication 
Patients not willing or able to discontinue prohibited concomitant medications were not eligible to enroll in 
the study.  However, if there was a clinical need that justified the added risk of these interventions in the 
setting of study drug use, they were employed at the discretion of the treating physician. 
•  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Cox-1 inhibitors. If absolutely necessary, NSAIDs 
•  were given for as short a time as possible but not sooner than 8 days after randomization 
•  Anticoagulants (both oral and parenteral) 
•  Open-label thienopyridines (eg, ticlopidine, clopidogrel) 
•  Dipyridamole 
•  Other antiplatelets 
• 
Thrombolytics (e.g., tPA) 
•  Vascular intervention (surgery and/or angioplasty of any vessel) 
If the intervention was absolutely necessary within the three months after randomization, the study drug 
was stopped 5 days prior to the intervention. The study treatment was then restarted unless the patient 
needed  to  take  open-label  clopidogrel  or  ASA.  In  this  case,  the  study  drug  was  restarted  only  when 
treatment with an open-label antiplatelet therapy other than ASA had been stopped. 
Concomitant  medication  use  was  similar  in  both  treatment  groups  (Table  12).  A  similar  proportion  of 
patients in the clopidogrel + ASA group (22.1%) and placebo + ASA group (22.9%) took any prohibited 
medication since last visit. The most frequent prohibited medication taken in both treatment groups was 
anticoagulants (both oral and parenteral) (12.6% in the clopidogrel + ASA group and 13.3% in the placebo 
+ ASA group).

Numbers analysed 
At  the  time  the  trial  was  stopped  because  of  a  significant  excess  in  the  number  of  patients  with  major 
hemorrhage  in  the  clopidogrel  +  ASA  group  was confirmed,  a  total  of  4881  patients  had  been  enrolled, 
which represented 83.6% of the anticipated number of patients. Of these patients, 4782 (98.0%) had been 
followed for at least 7 days, and 4557 (93.4%) had completed the 90-day trial visit or had died. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy outcome in a time-to-event analysis was the risk of a composite of ischemic stroke, 
MI, or death from an ischemic vascular event, at 90 days. In patients with high-risk TIA or minor ischemic 
stroke, treatment with clopidogrel + ASA resulted in a statistically significant risk reduction of subsequent 
ischemic  stroke,  MI,  or  death  from  ischemic  vascular  causes  (Figure  6).  The  composite  primary  efficacy 
outcome  occurred  in  121  patients  (5.0%)  receiving  clopidogrel  plus  ASA  and  in  160  patients  (6.5%) 
receiving placebo and ASA (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.59-0.95; P = 0.02).

Time course for benefit 
All enrolled patients were included in this analysis. In the ASA group, 160 (6.5%) major ischemic events 
occurred within 90 days, with most events occurring in the first week (Figure 7). In the clopidogrel-ASA 
group, 121 (5.0%) major ischemic events occurred within 90 days, with most events also occurring in the 
first week. Major ischemic events were less frequent in patients randomly assigned to daily clopidogrel-ASA 
versus aspirin in the first 3 weeks after enrollment but not in subsequent weeks (Figure 7).

With the use of a model-based approach, the optimal cut point of relative risk for major ischemic events 
was 21 days (Figure 8). The hazard ratio of the primary efficacy outcome at 21 days was 0.65 (95%CI 0-
50-0.85, p=0.0015) and at 22-90 days was 1.38 (95%CI 0.81-2.35,p=0.24).  
Figure 8 – Hazard rates by week after randomization 
 Secondary analyses 
The  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  included  each  component  of  the  primary  efficacy  outcome,  a 
composite of the primary efficacy outcome or major hemorrhage, and the total number of ischemic and 
hemorrhagic strokes. 
The secondary outcome of ischemic stroke occurred in 112 patients (4.6%) receiving clopidogrel + ASA, 
and in 155 patients (6.3%) receiving placebo + ASA (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.56-0.92; P = 0.01). Except for 
stroke,  there  were  no  significant  differences  between  treatment  groups  in  the  other  components  of  the 
composite primary efficacy outcome (Table 13). 
The risk of total ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke was lower with clopidogrel + ASA than with placebo + ASA 
(HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58-0.94; P = 0.01). A post hoc Bonferroni-corrected P value that incorporates five 
main secondary outcome comparisons is shown in Table 13.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
This analysis was based on individual patient data extracted directly from the databases of CHANCE and 
POINT, adhering to the ITT principle based on randomized treatment assignment. They included a total of 
10,051 patients (5,016 assigned to clopidogrel plus ASA and 5,035 assigned to ASA alone). 
The  primary  efficacy  outcome  in  the  pooled  analysis  was  a  new  major  ischemic  event  (ischemic  stroke, 
myocardial infarction, or death from ischemic vascular causes) at 90 days. The secondary efficacy outcomes 
were each component of the primary efficacy outcome, a composite of primary efficacy outcome and major 
hemorrhage, and stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). The primary safety outcome was major hemorrhage at 
90  days.  Secondary  safety  outcomes  were  hemorrhagic  stroke,  minor  hemorrhage,  major  or  minor 
hemorrhage, and death from any cause. 
The  analysis  included  fixed  effects  for  study  and treatment  assignment,  and  random effects  rather  than 
fixed  effects  for  study  site,  in  order  to  avoid  the  assumption  of  a  common  effect  size  between  the  two 
studies. If the interaction term was not significant, mixed effects Cox regression models were used with 
fixed effects for trial and treatment assignment, and random effects for study site to estimate the treatment

effects. 
Three models were developed. The first model adjusted only for trial. The second model further adjusted 
for  sex,  age,  race,  history  of  congestive  heart  failure,  known  atrial  fibrillation  or  flutter,  ischemic  heart 
disease,  hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  current  or  previous  smoking,  qualifying  event  type  (ischemic 
stroke  or  TIA),  and  time  to  randomization.  The  third  model  further  adjusted  for  lipid-lowering  and 
antihypertensive treatments (sensitivity analysis only, due to missing data on such treatments). 
Heterogeneity  of  treatment  effect  by  prespecified,  clinically-relevant  variables  was  tested  using  mixed 
effects  models  with  treatment-by-prespecified  variable  interaction  terms.  Prespecified  variables  included 
age,  sex,  race,  previous  ischemic  heart  disease,  hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  current  or  previous 
smoker, qualifying event, baseline NIHSS score, ABCD2 score, and time to randomization. All models were 
adjusted for the same covariates as the second model used for the primary analyses. 
Two-sided p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
Table 17 shows the baseline characteristics of the patients that were included in the pooled analysis.

In the pooled analysis, treatment with clopidogrel + ASA resulted in a statistically significant risk reduction 
of  the  composite  outcome  of  ischemic  stroke,  MI,  or  death  from  ischemic  vascular  causes  as  well  as 
individual  components  of  ischemic  stroke,  ischemic  or  hemorrhagic  stroke,  disabling  or  fatal  stroke 
(mRS>1), nondisabling stroke (mRS 0 or 1), and the composite of ischemic stroke, MI, death from ischemic 
vascular causes, or major hemorrhage (Table 18). A major ischemic event occurred in 328 patients (6.5%) 
receiving clopidogrel + ASA and in 458 patients (9.1%) receiving ASA alone at 90 days (adjusted HR: 0.70; 
95% CI: 0.61 to 0.81; P <0.0001). New stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) occurred in 328 patients (6.5%) 
receiving clopidogrel + ASA and in 459 patients (9.1%) receiving ASA alone at 90 days (adjusted HR: 0.70; 
95% CI: 0.61 to 0.80; P <0.0001). Further adjustment for lipid-lowing and antihypertensive treatments 
showed similar results. 
No interaction of trial-by-treatment was observed for the composite primary efficacy outcome (8.0% versus 
11.5% in CHANCE, 5.0% versus 6.5% in POINT; P = 0.45 for interaction) or for new stroke (8.2% versus 
11.7% in CHANCE, 4.8% versus 6.4% in POINT; P = 0.56 for interaction).

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Both the CHANCE and POINT studies were phase 3 clinical trials, multicentre, double blind and controlled 
with placebo. The study population was adequate to study of the proposed new indication.  Minor stroke 
and high risk TIA were defined according to the definitions more currently used in clinical practice (NIHSS<4 
and ABCD2>=4).  
The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  similar in both  studies.  Patients  with  cardioembolic  stroke that 
would need to be treated with anticoagulants were excluded.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657331/2020 
Page 48/71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In both studies, the mean age of included patients was 62  and 65 years respectively. This mean age is 
however relatively low taking into account that stroke is a disease with a prevalence that increased with 
advancing age.  
The CHANCE trial included only patients of Chinese origin and the POINT study included patients that were 
82.5% from the United States of America. Therefore, only a small portion of patients was from European 
origin. Clopidogrel is metabolized by CYP2C19. Some variants of CYP2C19 are associated with diminished 
platelet response to clopidogrel treatment and poorer cardiovascular outcomes.  
Notwithstanding  their  different  ethnic  origin,  CHANCE  and  POINT  included  patients  with  similar  vascular 
risk factors, a medical history of hypertension in 65-70%, diabetes mellitus in 21-28%, and ischemic heart 
disease in approximately 10% of patients. The qualifying event was AIS in 72% in CHANCE versus 57% in 
POINT, with a median NIHSS of 2. The remaining patients were diagnosed with TIA, with a median ABCD2 
score of 4-5. The mean time from symptom onset to randomization was 13h in CHANCE and 7.4h in POINT, 
which is consistent with their study protocols.  
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  the  CHANCE  trial  was  stroke  while  in  the  POINT  trial  was  a  composite 
outcome  of  ischemic  CV  death,  MI  or  stroke.  These  efficacy  endpoints  are  clinically  relevant  to  the 
population of patients under the proposed new indication. In the POINT trial the primary endpoint was a 
composite  endpoint  in  which  stroke  was  included  and  stroke  and  ischemic  stroke  and  ischemic  or 
haemorrhagic stroke were secondary endpoints. Both trials had an adequate sample size with statistical 
power to address the primary efficacy endpoint.  
The length of DAPT in the CHANCE study was 21 days and in the POINT study was 90 days. In both trials 
the length of follow-up was 90 days. This short length of follow-up in both studies is considerate appropriate 
for an accurate account of stroke events because there is data supporting that the recurrence of TIA/minor 
stroke is highest in the first two weeks following the qualifying events.  
The randomization process in both studies was sound and there was adequate masking.  
In both clinical trials it was done an intention to treat analysis of data.  
The POINT study was prematurely stopped because the DSMB determined that the treatment effect had 
crossed  the  significance  boundary  when  83%  of  the  planned  sample  of  randomized  patients  had  been 
included.  
Stroke recurrence depends not only on treatment with antiplatelets but also of control of other vascular 
risk  factors.  Data  regarding  anti-hypertensive  treatment  was  not  systematically  collected  in  the  POINT 
study and therefore it was not possible to adjust for it in the multivariable analysis. 
A pooled analysis based on individual patient data extracted directly from the databases of CHANCE and 
POINT, adhering to the ITT principle based on randomized treatment assignment was done. This analysis 
included a total of 10,051 patients.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the CHANCE study the primary endpoint was stroke, while in the POINT trial the primary endpoint was 
a composed endpoint of stroke, MI and CVD.  
In the CHANCE study there were less stroke events in the ASA + clopidogrel arm (212 (8.2%)) than in the 
ASA + placebo arm (303 (11.7%)), HR (95% CI) of 0.68 (0.57 – 0.81), p<0.001.   
In the POINT study there were less events related to the composite endpoint in the ASA + clopidogrel arm 
(121 (4.98%)) than in the ASA + placebo arm (160 (6.53%)), HR (95% CI) of 0.75 (0.59 – 0.95), p=0.02. 
The POINT study was prematurely stopped because the DSMB determined that the treatment effect had 
crossed the significance boundary.  
In the pooled analysis, treatment with clopidogrel + ASA compared to ASA alone resulted in a statistically 
significant  risk  reduction  of  ischemic  stroke  with  a  HR  of  0.69  (95%  CI  0.59  –  0.79),  p<0.0001.  The 
composite outcome of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or death from ischemic vascular causes was 
also lower in the clopidogrel + ASA group compared to ASA alone with a HR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.61 – 0.81), 
p<0.0001.  
In POINT, all enrolled patients were included in a time to benefit analysis. In the ASA group, 160 (6.5%) 
major  ischemic  events  occurred  within  90  days,  with  most  events  occurring  in  the  first  week.  In  the 
clopidogrel-ASA group, 121 (5.0%) major ischemic events occurred within 90 days, with most events also 
occurring in the first week. Major ischemic events were less frequent in patients randomly assigned to daily 
clopidogrel-ASA versus ASA in the first 3 weeks after enrollment but not in subsequent weeks. 
With the use of a model-based approach, the optimal cut-off point of relative risk for major ischemic events 
was 21 days. The hazard ratio of the primary efficacy outcome at 21 days was 0.65 (95%CI 0-50-0.85, 
p=0.0015) and at 22-90 days was 1.38 (95%CI 0.81-2.35,p=0.24).  
In the pooled analysis, the secondary outcome disabling or fatal stroke (mRS>1) had a HR of 0.74 (95% 
CI 0.62 – 0.87), p<0.001. The composite of ischemic or haemorrhagic was lower in the ASA + clopidogrel 
arm than in the ASA alone arm with a HR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.61 – 0.80), p<0.0001. Death from ischemic 
vascular disease was not statistically different in the two arms although with a trend towards higher number 
of events in the ASA + clopidogrel arm with a HR of 1.22 (95% CI 0.45 – 3.29), p=0.69. Regarding the 
pooled subgroup analysis, no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect was observed on major ischemic 
events across the prespecified subgroups.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Two phase 3 clinical trials showed that among patients with high-risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke who 
were initially seen within 24 hours after symptom onset, treatment with clopidogrel plus aspirin for 21 
days or 90 days, followed by clopidogrel alone for a total of 90 days, was superior to aspirin alone in 
reducing the risk of subsequent stroke events.  
Both the CHANCE and POINT studies showed statistically significant reductions in the risk of ischemic 
stroke over 90 days with the DAPT regimen studied, compared with antiplatelet monotherapy with ASA.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657331/2020 
Page 50/71 
 
 
 
 
In the Individual Patient Data Pooled Analysis, a HR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.60-0.80) was obtained. Efficacy 
was consistent in all the studied subgroups, including in patients with AIS or TIA as the qualifying event. 
The treatment effect of DAPT with clopidogrel plus ASA versus antiplatelet monotherapy was established 
early, and, essentially, in the first few weeks of therapy in both studies.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
There are several clinical studies describing the safety experience with clopidogrel, as monotherapy or in 
combination  with  ASA  in  other  indications.  The  most  common  adverse  reaction  is  bleeding.  Platelet 
aggregation inhibition with clopidogrel as monotherapy does not increase bleeding risk compared with ASA 
in a general population with atherothrombotic disease, while DAPT with clopidogrel plus ASA in approved 
ACS indications is associated with an increased bleeding risk, compared with ASA alone. Similar findings 
were made in a more general population of patients with cardiovascular disease.  
The safety profile of clopidogrel when used as a component of DAPT in patients with recent AIS or high-risk 
TIA is expects to be similar. Because patients with minor stroke or TIA generally have small areas of brain 
infarct or no evidence of infarct, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic infarcts is considered 
to be low.  
Patient exposure 
Extent of exposure in clinical trials 
The CHANCE study randomized 5170 patients to 21 days of DAPT with clopidogrel plus ASA followed by 
clopidogrel alone, or ASA for a follow-up treatment and observation period of 90 days. POINT enrolled 4881 
patients for a 90-day period, contrasting DAPT with clopidogrel plus ASA versus ASA alone for the duration 
of the treatment period.  
There are also individual Patient Data Pooled Analysis of the two studies. The MATCH, 
FASTER, and SPS3 studies, which altogether enrolled approximately 11,000 patients, also provide safety-
relevant information regarding the use of DAPT with clopidogrel plus ASA in patients with recent onset of 
symptomatic cerebral ischemic vascular disease. 
Adverse events 
Haemorrhages  
In CHANCE, bleeding events were defined according to the GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and 
Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries) criteria as:  
-  severe  bleeding  was  defined  as  fatal  or  intracranial  haemorrhage  or  other  haemorrhage  causing 
haemodynamic compromise that required blood or fluid replacement, inotropic support, 
or surgical intervention;  
-  moderate  bleeding  as  bleeding  that  required  transfusion  of  blood  but  did  not  lead  to  haemodynamic 
compromise requiring intervention;  
-  mild  bleeding  as  bleeding  not  requiring  transfusion  and not  causing  haemodynamic  compromise  (e.g., 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657331/2020 
Page 51/71 
 
 
 
 
subcutaneous bleeding, mild haematomas, and oozing from puncture sites). 
The primary safety outcome was a moderate-to-severe bleeding event, according to the  
GUSTO definition. 
Other Safety variables were: 
- Severe bleeding incidence (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries 
definition), including fatal bleeding and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage; 
- Incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhagic events at 3 months; 
- Moderate bleeding (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries definition); 
- Intracranial hemorrhage; 
- Total mortality; 
- Adverse events/severe adverse events reported by the investigators. 
- Physical examination including nervous system evaluation on visit of 1st day, 21st day, 3 month; 
- Adverse events collected in every visit; Lying position blood pressure and heart rhythm collected 
in every visit; ECG at baseline visit. 
In  POINT,  the  primary  safety  outcome  was  the  risk  of  major  haemorrhage,  which  was  defined  as 
symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, intraocular bleeding causing vision loss, transfusion of 2 or more 
units  of  red  cells  or  an  equivalent  amount  of  whole  blood,  hospitalization  or  prolongation  of  an  existing 
hospitalization, or death due to haemorrhage. 
Other secondary safety/tolerability outcomes included: 
•  All-cause death 
•  Hemorrhagic stroke 
•  Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage 
•  Other symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural 
• 
hemorrhage, or intraventricular hemorrhage) 
•  Major hemorrhage other than intracranial hemorrhage 
•  All minor hemorrhage (including asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage) 
Safety results: 
The haemorrhagic adverse events recorded in the two studies are shown in Table 19.

Table 19 – Bleeding events in the CHANCE and POINT studies 
In CHANCE, there was no statistical significant difference in the rate of bleeding including for moderate or 
severe bleeding between the two arms, with 7 patients (0.3%) in the clopidogrel + ASA group and in 8 
(0.3%) in the placebo + ASA group (p = 0.73) 
In the POINT study, major haemorrhage, as well as any extracranial bleeding events, occurred significantly 
more frequently in patients treated with DAPT with clopidogrel plus ASA, compared with ASA alone. Major 
hemorrhage occurred in 23 of 2432 patients (0.9%) receiving clopidogrel + ASA and in 10 of 2449 patients 
(0.4%) receiving placebo + ASA (HR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.10 to 4.87; p = 0.02). 
The POINT trials was prematurely stopped not only because the DSMB had determined that the treatment 
effect observed had crossed the significance boundary but also because the prespecified safety threshold 
for major haemorrhage had been crossed in the clopidogrel + ASA group in the interim analysis.  
This  difference  between  the  two  studies  could  have  been  due  to  the  increased  duration  of  DAPT  in  the 
POINT study (90 days) versus the CHANCE study (21 days). Also, the fact that the CHANCE only included 
Chinese patients, that have a higher prevalence of CYP2C19 non-function alleles may have contributed to 
Assessment report

this results. The majority of bleeding events in both studies was mainly extracranial.  
An analysis of the number of events in the POINT study distributed by time period was presented in Figure 
7. It shows that the risk of hemorrhage with clopidogrel plus ASA versus ASA alone was greater during the 
period from 8 to 90 days than during the first 7 days (P = 0.04 for days 8 to 90 and P = 0.34 for days 0 to 
7).  There  was  not  an  increases  risk  of  bleeding  in  the  first  days  of  treatment  in  which  the  loading  was 
administered.  
In the Individual Patient Data Pooled Analysis per time of CHANCE and POINT, major haemorrhages were 
more frequent in the clopidogrel + ASA group (0.6%) than in the placebo + ASA group (0.4%), but the 
difference was statistically nonsignificant (Table 20). There was not an increases risk of bleeding in the first 
days of treatment associated to the loading dose.  
Table 20 - Pooled analysis per time of bleeding events in the CHANCE and POINT studies 
In a pooled analysis of the two trials, with calculation of the hazard ratios of bleeding adjusted for different 
confounders in three different analysis, although patients with DAPT tended to have a higher risk of bleeding 
than patients with ASA alone, the difference was only statistically significant for minor haemorrhage and 
combined major or minor haemorrhage (Table 21).

In  CHANCE,  10  deaths  were  reported  in  each  treatment  group.  No  deaths  due  to  haemorrhage  were

In POINT, there were 19 deaths on clopidogrel plus ASA, compared with 12 deaths on ASA alone (HR: 1.51 
(95% CI: 0.73–3.13). Death from haemorrhagic vascular causes occurred in 3 patients receiving clopidogrel 
plus ASA and in 2 patients receiving ASA alone (0.1% in each group). All cause deaths per body system in 
the POINT study are shown in Table 23.

In the CHANCE study, the proportion of patients with SAEs was similar in both treatment groups (1.0% and 
0.8%  in  the  clopidogrel  +  ASA  and  placebo  +  ASA  groups,  respectively).  The  number  of  patients  with

Safety relationship with dose/regimen/treatment duration 
Bleeding is the main safety concern with clopidogrel when used with ASA as DAPT.  
Data from CHANCE and POINT shows that the overall bleeding risk during DAPT is associated to treatment 
duration (Figure 7). The loading dose of clopidogrel was not associated to a higher risk of bleeding during 
this period.  
Overdose 
There is no new information related to overdose.  
Dependence or abuse potential 
Not applicable 
Rebound  
There are no data to suggest a sudden rebound in the risk of thrombotic events upon discontinuation of 
clopidogrel.  This  is  consistent  with  the  action  of  clopidogrel  as  an  irreversible  antagonist  at  the  P2Y12 
receptor. 
Safety in special populations 
A review of special subgroup populations was not specifically assessed in the studies. A review is regularly 
performed as part of the Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports (PBRERs) for clopidogrel with or without 
aspirin. No concern has been identified up to the date of this report regarding intrinsic and extrinsic factors, 
overdose,  drug  abuse,  withdrawal,  or  rebound  in  the  current  marketed  indications,  including  clopidogrel 
monotherapy in recent stroke and DAPT (clopidogrel + aspirin) in the ACS indication. 
Drug  interactions  for  clopidogrel  and  aspirin  are  regularly  updated  and  reflected  in  the  Sanofi  Company 
Core Safety Information (CCSI) where the increase risk of bleeding related to additive effect of these drug 
acting on homeostasis is mentioned.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The CHANCE study was conducted in a Chinese population with an anticipated high prevalence of carriers 
of CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles. It is not known if this could be associated to a lower risk of bleeding. A 
published substudy did not indicate significant differences in bleeding risk between carriers and non-carriers 
of such alleles. 
POINT  included  mainly  US  subjects.  It  is  not  possible  to  conclude  whether  the  higher  bleeding  rates  on 
DAPT with clopidogrel plus ASA recorded in POINT may be related to the demographic composition of study 
participants. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Discontinuations due to AEs were not collected in the AE dataset in the CHANCE or POINT studies.

Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
Not applicable  
2.5.1.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
There are several clinical studies describing the safety experience with clopidogrel, as monotherapy or in 
combination with ASA in previous approved indications. The main safety concerning associated to use of 
clopidogrel is bleeding.  
Specifically,  the  major  safety  concern  of  the  new  indication  could  be  expected  to  be  haemorrhagic 
transformation  of  the  ischemic  infarct  in  the  first  days  after  TIA/minor  stroke.  There  was  no  previous 
evidence from clinical trials evaluating the use of loading doses of clopidogrel in patients with TIA/minor 
stroke. The CHANCE study used a loading dose of 300 mg and the POINT study a loading dose of 600 mg.  
The definitions used to identify and define bleeding events in both studies were in accordance with generally 
accepted definitions and therefore appropriate. Data from both the POINT and CHANCE studies showed that 
there was no increased risk of bleeding in the initial days. This suggests that the loading dose of clopidogrel 
was not associated with an increased risk of bleeding when compared to the entire length of DAPT. Also, 
overall  extracranial  bleeding  was  more  frequent  than  intracranial.  In  the  pooled  analysis,  there  was  no 
statistically  significant  difference  in  both  groups  regarding  haemorrhagic  stroke.  Eleven  patients  in  the 
placebo  +  ASA  group  (0.2%)  had  hemorrhagic  stroke  versus  thirteen  patients  in  the  clopidogrel  +  ASA 
group (0.3%).    
In the CHANCE study, although patients in the clopidogrel + ASA had overall higher frequency of bleeding 
events  than  patients  in  the  placebo  +  ASA  group,  this  difference  was  not  statistically  significant.  In  the 
POINT study, major haemorrhage occurred significantly more frequently in patients treated with clopidogrel 
+ ASA than in the placebo + ASA arm. Also, one the reasons why the POINT study was prematurely stopped 
was because the preespecified safety threshold for major haemorrhage had been crossed in the clopidogrel 
+ ASA arm in the interim analysis.  There are three possible explanations for this difference in bleeding in 
the two studies: a) The length of DAPT was 21 days in the CHANCE study and 90 days in the POINT study, 
c)  CHANCE  only  included  Chinese  patients  and  these  are  known  to  have  non-function  allelic  variants  of 
CYP2C19 that may decrease the risk of bleeding, c) There is no reference to the dose of ASA that was used 
by the majority of patients in the POINT trial.  The number of patients that had different dosages of ASA 
was not provided. The dose of ASA could be comprised according to protocol between 50-325 mg but there 
is  no  further  information.  Patients  using  the  highest  dose  of  ASA  in  combination  with  clopidogrel  could 
theoretically have a higher risk of bleeding. The dose of ASA that was used in the CHANCE trial was 75 mg. 
In  the  pooled  analysis,  no  subgroup  of  patients  was  identified  has  having  a  higher  bleeding  risk  in  the 
clopidogrel + ASA arm than in the placebo + ASA arm. Nevertheless, the median age of patients that were 
included  in  this  trial  is  lower  than  the  mean  age  of  stroke  in  the  general  population.  There  is  previous 
evidence that older patients are at higher risk of bleeding with antiplatelets.

The number of deaths and SAEs were similar in both arms in both the POINT and CHANCE study. In the 
pooled analysis there is reference to death due to ischemic stroke in 3 patients (2 in the placebo + ASA 
arm and 1 in the clopidogrel + ASA arm).  
The  CHANCE  and  POINT  studies  did  not  generate  any  other  safety  concerns  for  clopidogrel  not  already 
included in the approved product information.  
2.5.2.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan

 Risk minimisation measures 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the WSA and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The present application for a new indication of clopidogrel in adult patients with high risk Transient Ischemic 
Stroke (TIA) (ABCD2 score ≥4) or minor Ischemic Stroke (IS) (NIHSS ≤3) does not bring any significant 
change to Patient Information Leaflet tested for Plavix® / Iscover® film-coated tablets 75 mg and 300 mg. 
Therefore, no readability testing was performed. 
In view of the changes being introduced in the package leaflet as part of this new indication, the Applicant’s 
justification is considered acceptable and therefore no readability testing is required. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
After a transient ischemic attack or minor stroke, patients are at increased risk of recurrence of ischemic 
cerebral events. This risk  is highest in the first two  weeks after the qualifying event.   The ABCD2 score 
allows  a  stratification  of  stroke  risk  in  TIA  patients.  Patients  with  an  ABCD2>4  have  the  highest  risk  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/657331/2020 
Page 61/71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
stroke recurrence. Stroke is considered clinically as minor when the patient presents with small neurological 
deficits. Neurological deficits resulting from ischemic stroke are usually quantified using the NIHSS scale. 
Patients are considered to have a minor stroke when the NIHSS score is lower or equal to 4.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
When  considering  secondary  prevention  of  ischemic  cerebral  events  two  groups  of  patients  are  usually 
considered. The group of patients with a cardioembolic stroke etiology (atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart 
valves)  and  the  group  of  patients  with  non-cardioembolic  stroke  etiology.    Patients  with  cardioembolic 
stroke  etiologies  should  be  treated  with  anticoagulants  while  patients  with  non-cardioembolic  stroke 
etiologies are treated with antiplatelets. The only antiplatelet that was tested in acute ischemic stroke was 
ASA. Antiplatelet therapy with low-dose ASA is approved to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in the target 
population. Secondary prevention with ASA instituted within 24-48h post-event has been shown to reduce 
the risk of a recurrent ischemic event by approximately 20%, compared with placebo. A combination of two 
antiplatelets  that  act  by  different  mechanisms  could  theoretically  further  reduce  the  risk  of  recurrent 
ischemic stroke.  
Main clinical studies 
Two phase 3 clinical trials studied the proposed new indication. These studies were CHANCE and POINT. 
They investigated the benefits and risks of DAPT with clopidogrel plus ASA versus antiplatelet monotherapy. 
DAPT was initiated early after symptom onset, within 12h (POINT) to 24h (CHANCE), and continued for 21 
days (CHANCE) to 90 days (POINT). Both studies enrolled in total approximately 10,000 patients. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The main expected favourable effect was reduction in the risk of recurrent stroke during a follow-up period 
of 90 days.  
Both the CHANCE and POINT studies showed statistically significant reductions in the risk of ischemic stroke 
and stroke over 90 days with the DAPT regimen studied, compared with antiplatelet monotherapy with ASA.  
The CHANCE study obtained a HR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.81) and the POINT study a HR of 0.75 95% CI 
0.59-0.95) for stroke in DAPT versus ASA alone. Regarding the outcome ischemic stroke there were less 
events also in CHANCE and POINT in the DAPT arm compared to ASA alone with a HR of 0.67 (95%IC 0-
56 – 0.81) and HR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.56-0.92) respectively.   
In the Individual Patient Data Pooled Analysis for ischemic stroke recurrence, a HR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.59-
0.79) was obtained. Efficacy was consistent in all the studied subgroups, including in patients with AIS or 
TIA as the qualifying event. 
The treatment effect of DAPT with clopidogrel plus ASA versus antiplatelet monotherapy was established 
early, and, essentially, in the first few weeks of therapy in both studies.  
In the POINT study, with the use of a model-based approach, the optimal cut-off point of relative risk for 
major ischemic events was 21 days. The hazard ratio of the primary efficacy outcome at 21 days in DAPT 
compared to ASA alone was 0.65 (95%CI 0-50-0.85, p=0.0015) and at 22-90 days was 1.38 (95%CI 0.81-
2.35,p=0.24).

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the CHANCE study, DAPT was given during 21 days while in the POINT study DAPT was given during 90 
days. Based on the time-to-event curves and the analysis by time period in the pooled analysis of the two 
studies  a  duration  of  DAPT  of  up  to  a  maximum  of  21  days  after  symptom  onset,  as  done  in  CHANCE, 
appears reasonable from an efficacy perspective.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The main unfavourable effect was bleeding. Specifically, for this new indication it was important to evaluate 
if DAPT was associated with a higher risk of haemorrhagic transformation of the ischemic infarct.  
In the CHANCE study, although patients in the clopidogrel + ASA had overall higher frequency of bleeding 
events  than  patients  in  the  placebo  +  ASA  group,  this  difference  was  not  statistically  significant.  In  the 
POINT study, major haemorrhage occurred significantly more frequently in patients treated with clopidogrel 
+ ASA than in the placebo + ASA arm. Overall extracranial bleeding was more frequent than intracranial. 
In  the  pooled  analysis,  no  subgroup  of  patients  was  identified  has  having  a  higher  bleeding  risk  in  the 
clopidogrel + ASA arm than in the placebo + ASA arm.  
An analysis of the number of events in the POINT study distributed by time period showed that the risk of 
haemorrhage with clopidogrel plus ASA versus ASA alone was greater during the period from 8 to 90 days 
than during the first 7 days (P = 0.04 for days 8 to 90 and P = 0.34 for days 0 to 7). There was not an 
increases risk of bleeding in the first days of treatment in which the loading was administered.  
In the Individual Patient Data Pooled Analysis per time of CHANCE and POINT, major haemorrhages were 
more frequent in the clopidogrel + ASA group (0.6%) than in the placebo + ASA group (0.4%), but the 
difference was statistically nonsignificant. 
The number of deaths and SAEs were similar in both arms in both the POINT and CHANCE study.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, a higher bleeding risk was observed in POINT than in CHANCE.  
There are three possible explanations:  
a) DAPT was given during 21 days in CHANCE and during 90 days in POINT. POINT was prematurely stopped 
in an interim analysis due to the fact that the established threshold for bleeding had been crossed. A DAPT 
length of 21 days is considered to be the appropriate duration.  
b) The CHANCE study only included Chinese patients. Chinese patients have a higher frequency of non-
functional allelic variants of CYP2C19. This could contribute to a lower risk of bleeding in these patients 
when compared to patients included in the POINT trial that were mainly from US origin.  
c) There is no reference to the dose of ASA that was used by the majority of patients in the POINT trial.  
The  number  of  patients  that  had  different  dosages  of  ASA  is  not  provided.  The  dose  of  ASA  could  be 
comprised according to protocol between 50-325 mg but there is no further information. Patients using the 
highest dose of ASA in combination with clopidogrel could theoretically have a higher risk of bleeding. The 
dosage of ASA that was used in CHANCE was 75 mg. 
Also, stroke prevalence increases with increasing age. The mean age of patients included in CHANCE and 
POINT was 62-65 years.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The  current proposed new  indication is  prevention  of  stroke  recurrence in  patients  with high  risk  TIA  or 
minor stroke. Clinically relevant benefit of DAPT with clopidogrel plus low-dose ASA versus ASA alone in 
patients with recent symptom onset (within 24 hours) of minor AIS or high-risk TIA, to prevent recurrent 
ischemic stroke was demonstrated in the CHANCE and POINT studies. The efficacy benefit of DAPT  with 
clopidogrel plus ASA was established early. This is consistent with what had been reported of high risk of 
recurrent ischemic events in the first weeks after the qualifying event. 
The decrease in stroke recurrence was similar in the two studies. Extended use of DAPT in the POINT study 
for 90 days did not provide incremental benefit over the 21 days that were used in CHANCE.  
Bleeding is the main unfavourable effect associated with DAPT with clopidogrel plus low-dose ASA. In this 
specific  indication  it  was  also  important  to  consider  intracranial  bleeding  including  haemorrhagic 
transformation  of  ischemic  infarcts  and  haemorrhagic  stroke.  There  was  trend  to higher  bleeding  risk  in 
CHANCE  but  this  difference  was  not  statistically  significant.  In  the  POINT  study,  major  haemorrhage 
occurred significantly more frequently in patients treated with clopidogrel + ASA than in the placebo + ASA 
arm.  In  the  pooled  analysis  there  was  a  higher  statistically  significant  risk  of  combined  major  and 
haemorrhagic  bleeding  and  minor  bleeding  in  patients  with  DAPT.  However,  there  was  no  difference  in 
haemorrhagic  stroke.  Overall,  bleeding  risk  accumulated  over  time  of  treatment,  and  was  not  distinctly 
related to the loading dose of clopidogrel or associated with the period of highest risk of recurrent stroke 
and was manifested mainly by extracranial bleeds.  
In POINT, the hazard rate of major ischemic events was highest within the first several weeks, but then 
decreased (Figure 11). In contrast, the HR of major haemorrhage was low but constant over time for both 
treatment groups. By day 28, the rate for ischemic events no longer decreased and was constant for both 
treatment groups.

Figure 11 – Hazard rate of major ischemic events and major hemorrhages in the POINT study 
In the POINT study, with the use of a model-based approach, the optimal cut point of relative risk for 
major ischemic events was 21 days (Figure 8). The hazard ratio of the primary efficacy outcome at 21 
days was 0.65 (95%CI 0-50-0.85, p=0.0015) and at 22-90 days was 1.38 (95%CI 0.81-2.35, p=0.24).  
The time course analysis of pooled data from the two studies is summarized in Table 27 and shows the 
early increase of major ischemic events and the lower number of events of major haemorrhage. These 
numbers indicate an efficacy benefit for clopidogrel plus ASA up to 21 days of treatment when compared 
to ASA alone (Figure 12).  There was no initial peaking of haemorrhagic risk that could be related to the 
loading dose of clopidogrel.

The benefit/risk is favourable for a limited duration of DAPT with clopidogrel plus low-dose ASA in patients 
with  non-cardioembolic  stroke  with  recent  symptom  onset  of  minor  AIS  (NIHSS  0-3)  or  high-risk  TIA 
(ABCD2 score of at least 4).  
Treatment should be within 24h of symptom onset, with a loading dose of clopidogrel of 300 mg, followed 
by  75  mg/day  in  combination  with  low-dose  ASA.  DAPT  with  clopidogrel  plus  low-dose  ASA  should  be 
continued for up to of 21 days post-event and be followed by antiplatelet monotherapy with clopidogrel or 
ASA, as clinically indicated. 
Treatment should thus limit to the minimum period associated with efficacy benefit. In the absence of data 
to support efficacy benefit of the higher loading dose of 600 mg in the proposed target population, and 
given the favourable benefit and bleeding rate data from CHANCE, the standard loading dose of 300 mg 
appears preferable.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  benefit  risk  balance  is  positive  for  the  use  of  clopidogrel  plus  aspirin  for  the  prevention  of  stroke 
recurrence in a population of patients with moderate to high risk TIA or minor stroke of non-cardioembolic 
cause. 
The studies showed that among patients with high-risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke who were initially seen 
within  24  hours  after  symptom  onset,  treatment  with  clopidogrel  plus  aspirin  for  21  days,  followed  by 
clopidogrel alone for a total of 90 days, was superior to aspirin alone in reducing the risk of subsequent 
stroke events.  
The pooled analysis showed a higher risk of combined major or minor haemorrhage and minor haemorrhage 
in patients that were treated with clopidogrel plus aspirin than with aspirin alone. The bleeding risk was 
higher in the POINT study than in the CHANCE study. Although there was a trend for higher bleeding in 
CHANCE in patients in DAPT than in patients treated with ASA alone, there was no statistically significant 
difference.  Taking  into  account  that  both  studies  showed  similar  efficacy,  the  conditions  of  DAPT  in  the 
CHANCE study should be preferred. These included a loading dose of 300 of clopidogrel and a length of 
DAPT of 21 days.  
The MAH attributed the increased bleeding risk in the POINT trial to the increased length of DAPT (90 days 
versus 21 days in CHANCE). Also, the CHANCE study only included Chinese patients. Chinese patients have 
a higher frequency of non-functional allelic variants of CYP2C19. This could contribute to a lower risk of 
bleeding in these patients when compared to patients included in the POINT trial that were mainly from US 
origin. The MAH acknowledges that there may be some issues that influence the external validity of the 
CHANCE trial, including the higher frequency of carriers of CYP2C19 loss of function alleles in the Chinese 
population than in Europeans. Nevertheless, CHMP agree with the MAH that the CHANCE study contributes 
information  regarding  the  benefit/risk  of  short-term  treatment  with  DAPT  with  clopidogrel  plus  ASA  in 
patients with minor AIS/high-risk TIA that is also relevant also to a European population. 
In the POINT trial, patients could be treated with doses of ASA ranging from 50-325 mg + clopidogrel while 
in the CHANCE trial only doses of 75 mg of ASA were administered plus clopidogrel. The CHMP requested 
a  breakdown  in  the  number  of  patients  with  corresponding  bleeding  incidence  rates  in  the  POINT  trial 
treated with different doses of ASA. The great majority (at least 75%) of patients in the POINT trial were 
prescribed  ASA  at  a  maximum  daily  dose  of  100  mg.  There  are  no  data  to  support  augmented  efficacy 
benefit of ASA doses higher than 75-100 mg/day as a component of DAPT with clopidogrel and, while the 
analyses  from  the  POINT  study  do  not  indicate  an  increased  excess  of  bleeding  risk  with  DAPT  with 
clopidogrel plus doses of ASA >100 mg/day, such excess risk cannot be excluded. As such in  section 4.2 
of the SmPC the maintenance dosage of ASA is restricted  to 75-100 mg/daily as follows: “Adult patients 
with moderate to  high-risk TIA or minor IS: Adult patients with moderate to high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score 
≥4) or minor IS (NIHSS ≤3) should be given a loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg followed by clopidogrel 
75  mg  once  daily  and  ASA  (75  mg-100  mg  once  daily).  Treatment  with  clopidogrel  and  ASA  should  be

started within 24 hours of the event and be continued for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy.” 
At the request of CHMP the number of patients according to age category and the age range in the overall 
sample was presented using the dataset from the Individual Patient Data Pooled Analysis of CHANCE and 
POINT.  Patients ≥ 75 years represent 19% of the overall study population (close to 2000 patients, from 
which 980 received DPAT). The large majority of patients (75%) in the POINT were administered less than 
≤100  mg/day  of  ASA.  The  benefit  of  using  DPAT  for  secondary  prevention  of  TIA  or  minor  stroke  was 
demonstrated to be similar in patients ≥75 years old and <65 years old. The incidence of bleeding events 
in general was, has expected, higher in patients ≥75 years old than in younger patients, irrespective of 
treatment allocation. However, as stated by the MAH neither POINT nor CHANCE were dimensioned for this 
type of subgroup analysis. This new indication for DAPT compared to the previous approved carries a novel 
potential risk of increased intracranial hemorrhage. The number of intracranial hemorrhages was double in 
patients  with  ≥65  years  old  compared  with  younger  patients  with  a  slighter  higher  number  in  patients 
treated with DAPT than ASA alone.   
The benefit of using DAPT for the proposed indication in patients ≥75 years old was shown. However, it 
was  associated  to  a  higher  bleeding  risk  compared  to  younger  patients.  DAPT  should  be  used  in  these 
patients with a maintenance dose of ≤ 100 mg. The proposed indication compared to previous approved 
indications  of  DAPT  is  associated  to  an  increased  risk  of  intracranial  haemorrhage  in  older  patients. 
Therefore,  the  safety  concern  regarding  the  risk  of  major  bleeding  namely  intracranial  haemorrhage  in 
patients ≥75 years old should be followed in the next PSUR of clopidogrel as an important potential risk. 
Regarding subjects with severe renal impairment, it is noted that these subjects were excluded from both 
CHANCE and POINT; This is a population at increased bleeding risk. There is reference to renal impairment 
in the SmPC in sections 4.2 and 4.4 and the results of a study in subjects with severe renal impairment are 
detailed  in  SmPC  Section  5.2.  The  safety  profile  of  DAPT  in  the  proposed  indication  for  this  specific 
population is considered to be the same as in the current approved indications.  
Other important groups of patients for whom the risk of bleeding could be higher were excluded from 
participation in the CHANCE and POINT studies. These include in particular, patients with a history of 
(non-traumatic) intracranial haemorrhage and patients with a recent (within 3 months) gastro-intestinal 
bleed or major surgery. Section 4.4 of the SmPC was amended to reflect the lack of data regarding the 
benefit risk of using DAPT in adult patients with a past medical history of (non-traumatic) intracranial 
haemorrhage for moderate to high-risk TIA (ABCD2 score ≥4) or minor IS (NIHSS ≤3). Information was 
also added to the patient leaflet to the warning and precautions section: “If any of the situations 
mentioned below apply to you, you should tell your doctor before taking Plavix: 
•” if you had a past medical history of non traumatic intranial hemorrhage “

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The  overall  B/R  of  DAPT  with  clopidogrel  plus  aspirin  administered  with  a  loading  dose  of  300  mg  and 
maintenance with 75 mg of clopidogrel during 21 days in patients with minor stroke or moderate to high 
risk TIA is considered to be positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends  the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of indication in combination with aspirin to include adult patients with moderate to high risk 
Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) (ABCD2 score ≥4) or minor Ischemic Stroke (IS) (NIHSS ≤3) within 24 
hours of either the TIA or IS event for Iscover and Plavix. The new indication is based on the results of 
two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trials (studies POINT & CHANCE); as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated, the PL is  updated accordingly.  
Version 2.3 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
The worksharing procedure leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the worksharing procedure, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and 
to the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

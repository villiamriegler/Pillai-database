SmPC and PL 
The outcomes of the final study report from the MYCOS 
the safety information, based on the Final Mortality 
Report and the 30-day Reanalysis Report from the 
MYCOS Study. The MYCOS Study is a post-
authorisation commitment (MEA 013.7) to 
investigate the short and long-term safety of 
micafungin and other parenteral antifungal agents.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement a statement on a sodium excipient in the 
Package Leaflet, in accordance with the Annex of the 
study (an Observational database-assisted comparative 
cohort study to investigate the risk of hepatotoxicity and 
hepatocellular carcinoma - HCC) including the Final 
Mortality Report and the 30-day Reanalysis Report were 
reassuring with regards to the frequency of occurrence of 
renal or hepatic injuries.  The risk of re-hospitalisation for 
treatment of fungal infection was similar between all 
patient groups. The provided final mortality report is in line 
with the previous reports. Nevertheless, due to the limited 
duration of follow-up (because of high mortality in the

cohorts) and the low event rate, no definite conclusions 
regarding the potential risk of HCC mortality in clinical 
practice could be drawn. This supported a change to a 
statement on the potential relevance of preclinical hepatic 
findings. The SmPC section 4.4 has been updated to read 
as follows:  
“Hepatic effects: The development of foci of altered 
hepatocytes (FAH) and hepatocellular tumours after a 
treatment period of 3 months or longer were observed in 
rats. The assumed threshold for tumour development in 
rats is approximately in the range of clinical exposure. The 
clinical relevance of this finding is not known”.

checklist has been updated to focus on the specific 
important risks. The prescriber’s checklist is streamlined to 
contain information on hepatic events, haemolytic events, 
renal events and potential risk of liver tumour formation. 
The “Administration and Monitoring Guide”, designed as an 
educational tool to inform nurses is deleted asno additional 
benefit of this material is expected. The safety information 
is already covered in the Prescriber’s Checklist and 
displayed in the SmPC section 4.2; 4.4 and 6.6. The RMP

exposure for the treatment of CNS Candida infections. 
Micafungin dosed at 4 mg/kg in children less than 4 months 
approximates drug exposures achieved in adults receiving 
100 mg/day for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. If 
central nervous system (CNS) infection is suspected, a 
higher dosage (e.g. 10 mg/kg) should be used due to the 
dose-dependent penetration of micafungin into the CNS.  
Mean weight-adjusted clearance in children less than 4 
months of age is approximately 2.6-fold greater than older 
children (12-16 years) and 2.3-fold greater than in adults. 
The safety and efficacy in children (including neonates) less 
than 4 months of age of doses of 4 and 10 mg/kg for the 
treatment of invasive candidiasis with CNS involvement has 
not been adequately established in controlled clinical 
studies.

the contraindication 'hypersensitivity to other 
echinocandins' should be added to the European SmPC of 
Mycamine.  
In addition, following signal evaluation analysis of the 
cumulative safety data of micafungin as mentioned in the 
latest 5th PSUR, the MAH concluded that the adverse 
reactions disseminated intravascular coagulation, erythema 
multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic 
epidermal necrolysis should be added to the section 4.8 of 
SmPC. 
Based on the severity of the bullous skin reactions like TEN 
and SJS and in line with SmPC guideline and other EU 
SmPCs, an additional warning in section 4.4 is included. 
The Prescriber Checklist and Administration and Monitoring 
Guide, as well as the Annexes II and 127a, were updated in 
accordance.  
Although disseminated intravascular coagulation, erythema 
multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal 
necrolysis are serious adverse reactions, their incidence is 
very low. 
Provided that all the safety measures are taken into 
account as requested, the benefit-risk ratio of Mycamine 
remains favourable.

Section 4.5 of the SmPC already includes a statement in 
Package Leaflet 
As per CHMP request following the assessment of 
FU2 016.2, update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to 
include a statement relating to toxic adverse 
reactions due to the interaction with sirolimus, 
nifedipine or itraconazole. In addition, the term 
'anaphylactic' was added to the anaphylactoid 
reactions warning in section 4.4 and a minor editorial 
change in section 4.5 in the statement concerning 
co-administration of micafungin and amphotericin 
relation to concomitant use of micafungin with sirolimus, 
nifedipine and itraconazole and monitoring of toxicity. 
Following the CHMP request and in accordance with the 
Guideline on the SmPC, a warning statement to monitor the 
toxicity of sirolimus, nifedipine and itraconazole, and to 
reduced the dosage if necessary, when co-administrered 
with micafungin was added to the section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
The interaction section of the PL was updated accordingly.

Annex II and Package Leaflet

forms of interaction" of the SmPC to include the

intravenous micafungin and amphotericin B following 
repeated administration to healthy male subjects and the 
PK simulation results, it was suggested that concomitant 
treatment of amphotericin B and micafungin for 14 days 
would result in an increase of plasma amphotericin B

safety information for the interaction with 
amphotericin B, and of section 4.8 "Undesirable 
effects" to include toxic skin eruption. The Package 
Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
In addition the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the European Medicines Agency website address in 
the product information and the local representative 
contacts in Romania and Bulgaria in the Package 
Leaflet. The European Medicines Agency acronym 
was updated in the Annex II.

concentrations of about 33%. This is to be expected as 
amphotericin B accumulates to steady state.  
Therefore, due to the clinical significance of the increase of 
nephrotoxic amphotericin B concentration, the CHMP 
agreed that information of the co-administration should be 
added in section 4.5 of the SmPC, together with an 
additional statement in section 4.4. 
Concerning the serious skin adverse events, a review of 
safety data from micafungin clinical trials was performed. 
27.5% patients treated with micafungin had skin adverse 
events compared to 31.9% patients on the active control 
arm. Most of these adverse events were mild to moderate 
in severity  and there were 9 serious adverse events in the 
skin SOC reported with micafungin (0.2% of all adverse 
events reported). No reports of toxic epidermal necrolysis, 
Stevens Johnson syndrome, Lyell syndrome, DRESS, 
toxicoderma, bullae and erythema multiforme were noted. 
The review of the MAH safety database showed 59 events 
of skin adverse events. 22 of the events were serious and 
37 were non-serious. Of the 22 serious skin, 3 were 
Stevens Johnson syndrome, 5 were Toxic Epidermal 
Necrolysis, 4 were toxic skin eruption, 6 were drug 
eruption, and 4 were stomatitis. In all of these cases, there 
were other causative factors but the relationship between 
the events and micafungin could not be completely 
excluded. Consequently, the adverse reaction 'toxic skin 
eruption' was added to the SmPC with an "unknown 
frequency" and the bullous skin reactions will continue to 
be closely monitored and reported in the PSURs.

lower plasma concentrations of micafungin and higher

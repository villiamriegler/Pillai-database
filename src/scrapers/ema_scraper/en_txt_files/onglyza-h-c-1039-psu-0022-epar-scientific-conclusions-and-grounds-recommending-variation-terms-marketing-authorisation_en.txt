Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Onglyza, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
In the cumulative cases of patients with abdominal pain, there were 12 cases reporting a positive de- 
and rechallenge and in five of the cases a second positive de-challenge of abdominal pain was 
reported. The time to onset of the events was relatively short (hours to days). This was suggestive of a 
causal relationship. Of note, abdominal pain is listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC of another DPP-4 
inhibitor, sitagliptin. Overall, the cases discussed by the MAH pointed towards a causal relation 
between saxagliptin use and abdominal pain. Therefore, ‘abdominal pain’ should be included in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. However, at this time no frequency can be assigned based on the provided data in 
the PSUR and the MAH response. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Onglyza the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance saxagliptin is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms to the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

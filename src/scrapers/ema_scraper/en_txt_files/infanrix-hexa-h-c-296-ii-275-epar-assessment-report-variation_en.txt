1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, GlaxoSmithkline Biologicals SA 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 20 March 2020 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

C.I.4  
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new 
Type II

quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in relation to the frequency of adverse reactions 
somnolence and fatigue and to update the safety and immunogenicity information in infants and 
toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy; based on data generated from 
DTPA-048 and DTPA-049; these are phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multicentre studies aimed 
to provide immunological responses to Infanrix hexa in terms of seroprotection status for diphtheria 
(D), tetanus (T), HBs antigen, inactivated poliovirus (IPV) and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) 
antigens (PRP) and in terms of vaccine or booster responses to the pertussis antigens, 1 month after 
the last dose of the primary vaccination or the booster dose.  
The MAH took the opportunity to update the posology information in the package leaflet to align it with 
the SmPC. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet and to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The purpose of the present variation was to submit the Final Clinical Study Report (CSR) of studies 
DTPA-047, DTPA-048 and DTPA-049. These 3 Phase IV studies were part of a Maternal immunisation 
(MI) clinical development programme initiated by the MAH in 2013-2014. Results of DTPA-048 study 
related to pertussis immune response and their interpretation were discussed with the Belgian and the 
German Regulatory Authorities during a Scientific-Technical Advice meeting in June 2019. CSR of 
studies DTPA-048 and DTPA-049 were already assessed under Article 46 procedure 
(EMA/H/C/000296/P46/0131 and EMA/H/C/000296/P46/0132). Results of study DTPA-048 were also 
discussed at VWP (December 2019). Based on the study findings and previous assessments, the MAH 
proposes updates of section 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC. 
MI has proved its benefit in protecting neonates against (severe) pertussis disease during the first 
months of life. On the other hand, MI has been shown to interfere with immune responses of infants to 
their childhood vaccination. In consequence, the MAH has initiated a MI clinical development 
programme to gain further insights on the immunogenicity and safety of maternal vaccination with the 
dTpa vaccine Boostrix and the impact on infants’/toddlers’ immune responses after their primary and 
booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa. The first study, DTPA-047, was a randomized, placebo-
controlled, multicentre study that evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of Boostrix when 
administered to pregnant women aged 18–45 years during the third trimester of pregnancy. Both 
Assessment report  
EMA/496743/2020  
Page 4/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other studies, DTPA-048 and DTPA-049, were non-randomised, open label, multicentre studies that 
evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of Infanrix hexa given in the primary vaccination schedule 
(DTPA-048) or as a booster dose (DTPA-049) to infants and toddlers born to mothers participating in 
study DTPA-047. In DTPA-048, Infanrix hexa was administered with Prevenar 13 in a 2- or 3- dose 
schedule according to the country of enrolment. In DTPA-049, Infanrix hexa was co-administered with 
Prevenar 13.  
Immunogenicity assessment consisted in the measurement of specific antibodies (Ab). Only Ab specific 
to the 3 pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN) were assessed in cord blood samples (DTPA-047), whereas 
anti-D and anti-T Ab were measured before and after primary or booster infant’s vaccination in parallel 
to the pertussis-specific immune responses (DTPA-048 and DTPA-049). Humoral immune responses to 
all other components of the paediatric Infanrix hexa vaccine were assessed in infants and toddlers 
after the primary vaccination (DTPA-048) as well as before and after the booster vaccination (DTPA-
049). The clinical protections against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus 
influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections were defined by their serological correlates 
of protection (CoP). The seroprotection thresholds were ≥0.1 IU/mL for anti-D and anti-T Ab 
concentrations, ≥10 mIU/mL for anti-HBs Ab concentrations, ≥8 ED50 for anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 
and 3 Ab titres, ≥0.15 μg/mL for anti-PRP Ab concentrations and ≥ 0.35 µg/mL for anti-PnPS Ab 
concentrations. Since there is no CoP established for B. pertussis infection, results expression in term 
of GMC was deemed the most relevant. 
In line with the literature, MI was shown to interfere with the infants’ immune responses to the 
Infanrix hexa primary and boost vaccination. The blunting effect was specific to certain homologous 
and heterologous antigens. Whereas no immune interferences were observed, at any timepoint tested, 
for tetanus, Hepatitis B, poliovirus type 1, 2 and 3 and Haemophilus influenzae type b infections, 
blunting of the immune responses specific to diphtheria, Streptococcus pneumoniae or B. pertussis 
were observed. 
Lower GMC of Ab specific to diphtheria toxoid and to most of the serotypes of Streptococcus 
pneumoniae were observed post-primary and post-booster vaccination in the dTpa group when 
compared to the control group. However, the observed interference of MI on infant’s Ab concentration 
post-vaccination is not likely to be clinically relevant in the short term since, one month after the 
booster vaccination, (i) all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria and (ii) the percentages of 
subjects achieving the protective threshold of 0.35 µg/ml to the various serotypes of Streptococcus 
pneumoniae were generally high and comparable between groups, suggesting that the subjects of both 
groups are comparatively able to mount an anamnestic response. 
Results and interpretation of immune responses to pertussis antigens are more difficult to interpret 
since there is currently no established and validated correlate of vaccine protection. Lower GMC were 
observed at one month post-primary vaccination for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN Ab in the dTpa 
group when compared to the control group. One month post-boost, lower PT- and FHA- Ab responses 
were still observed in infants whose mothers did receive dTpa immunisation during pregnancy when 
compare to control infants. This is in line with the literature describing a blunting of pertussis-specific 
immune responses in different studies in which different vaccines were used for maternal and 
childhood immunisation. It therefore appears that the blunting effect is not product-specific. It also 
appears, based on the DTPA-049 post-boost response, that infants born to dTpa vaccinated mothers 
developed an immune memory against B. pertussis. It is however not known for which duration and if 
the quality of the recall responses would be unaffected in a longer term. Although current 
epidemiological data are reassuring regarding the absence of any clinical impact of the blunting of 
infants immune responses during and/or shortly after the primary vaccination, uncertainties yet 
remain for the long-term clinical protection.

Both Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 were well tolerated. The safety profile was similar in both groups, 
regardless of exposure/non-exposure of the mothers to Boostrix during pregnancy. The frequency of 
the reported solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were in line with the frequency described in 
the Infanrix hexa product information (PI). 
The MAH has  described the safety and immunogenicity in infants and toddlers born to mothers 
vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy in sections 4.8 and 5.1. The MAH has also updated the 
frequency of adverse reactions (ARs) following the reclassification of frequency for “Fatigue” (from 
very common to uncommon) and “Somnolence” (from uncommon to very common), which is 
supported.  
Based on the current epidemiological data following initiation of MI programs, the benefit-risk balance 
of Infanrix hexa remains positive.

Summary 
Maternal immunisation has proved its benefit in protecting neonates against (severe) pertussis disease 
during the first months of life. 
Based on data generated from DTPA-048 and DTPA-049, post-primary and post-booster vaccination, 
immunological data did not show clinically relevant interference of maternal vaccination with 
diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (dTpa) on the infant’s and toddler’s responses to diphtheria, 
tetanus, hepatitis B, inactivated poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b or pneumococcal antigens. 
Lower antibody concentrations against pertussis antigens post-primary (PT, FHA and PRN) and post-
booster (PT, FHA) vaccination were observed in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with 
dTpa during pregnancy. The fold-increases of anti-pertussis antibody concentrations from the pre-
booster to the 1-month post-booster time point were in the same range for infants and toddlers born 
to mothers vaccinated with dTpa or with placebo, demonstrating effective priming of the immune 
system. In the absence of correlates of protection for pertussis, the clinical relevance of these 
observations remains to be fully understood. However, current epidemiological data on pertussis 
disease following the implementation of dTpa maternal immunisation do not suggest any clinical 
relevance of this immune interference. 
The MAH also took the opportunity to update the frequency for “Fatigue” (from very common to 
uncommon) and “Somnolence” (from uncommon to very common) as a result of the reencoding 
“Drowsiness” under the MedDRA Preferred Term from “Fatigue” to “Somnolence”.

5.  Introduction 
Medicinal product 
Infanrix hexa is GSK’s combination diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, inactivated 
poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib). Infanrix 
hexa was authorised in Europe in October 2000 and is currently licensed in more than 90 countries 
worldwide. 
Infanrix hexa is indicated for primary and booster vaccination of infants and toddlers against 
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Hib disease. 
The primary vaccination schedule consists of 2 or 3 doses administered in the first year of life. The 
booster dose must be administered at least 6 months after the last dose of the primary vaccination 
and preferably between 11 and 13 months of age or before 18 months of age respectively after 
primary vaccination with 2 doses or 3 doses of Infanrix hexa. 
Rationale of the proposed changes 
In response to pertussis outbreaks that occurred in 2011–2013, several national health authorities 
worldwide issued recommendations for maternal immunisation (MI) with combined reduced-antigen 
content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (dTpa) vaccines with the aim of passively protecting the 
neonate and young infants from pertussis disease. Effectiveness of maternal immunization against 
pertussis disease in the first 3 months of life has been demonstrated (Amirthalingam 2016, Baxter 
2017, Bellido-Blasco 2017, Becker-Dreps 2018, Saul 2018). Consequently, vaccination during 
pregnancy is currently included in the therapeutic indication of dTpa vaccines. On the other hand, the 
MI with a dTpa vaccine results in immune interference with primary vaccination series in these infants, 
as compared with no dTpa vaccination during pregnancy. 
To gain further insights on the immunogenicity and safety of maternal vaccination with its dTpa 
booster vaccine Boostrix and the impact on infants’/toddlers’ immune responses after their primary 
and booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa, the MAH has initiated a MI clinical development 
programme, that included 3 Phase IV studies, i.e. studies DTPA-047, DTPA-048 and DTPA-049.  
Results of DTPA-048 study related to pertussis immune response and their interpretation were 
discussed with the Belgian and the German Regulatory Authorities during a Scientific-Technical Advice 
meeting in June 2019. DTPA-048 and DTPA-049 study complete results were further assessed under 
Article 46 procedure (EMA/H/C/296/P46 131 and EMA/H/C/000296/P46 132). Results of study DTPA-
048 were also discussed at VWP (December 2019) and recommendations on if and how data could be 
reflected in the PI were made.  
The MAH proposes an update of the section 4.8 and section 5.1 of the SmPC based on the clinical data 
generated in these studies. The MAH also takes the opportunity to make editorial changes to the PI. 
6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Three studies were included in the MI clinical development programme: 
✓  DTPA[BOOSTRIX]-047 (DTPA-047): randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre study that 
evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of Boostrix when administered to pregnant women aged 
18–45 years.  
This study provides data on the quantification of maternal pertussis antibodies transferred to the 
neonate as measured in the cord blood at birth. 
✓  DTPA [BOOSTRIX]-048 PRI (DTPA-048): non-randomised, open label, multicentre study that 
Assessment report  
EMA/496743/2020

evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of Infanrix hexa given in the primary vaccination 
schedule to infants born to mothers participating in study DTPA-047. 
✓  DTPA [BOOSTRIX]-049 BST 048 (DTPA-049): non-randomised, open label, multicentre study that 
evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of Infanrix hexa given as a booster dose to 
infants/toddlers born to mothers participating in study DTPA-047 and who completed their primary 
vaccination in study DTPA-048. 
Results of these studies that are relevant for the proposed changes are discussed below.

6.1.1.  Design features 
Study designs of studies DTPA -047, -048 and -049 are summarized in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
6.1.1.1.  Study DTPA-047 (pregnant women) 
Experimental design: Phase IV, observer-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-country, 
multicentre study with 2 cross-over groups. The study was conducted in Australia, Canada, Czechia, 
Finland, Italy and Spain. 
Population: Healthy pregnant women between, and including, 18-45 years of age at the time of 
screening and 270/7-366/7 weeks of gestation at the time of vaccination. 
Blinding: Data were collected in an observer-blind manner, meaning that the vaccine recipient and 
those responsible for the evaluation of any study endpoint were unaware of which vaccine was 
administered. Therefore, vaccine preparation and administration was done by authorised medical 
personnel who did not participate in any of the study clinical evaluation assays. GSK staff and other 
study staff, i.e., laboratory in charge of the laboratory testing, were also blinded to the treatment. 
Randomization: The randomisation of supplies within blocks was performed at GSK, using MATerial 
EXcellence (MATEX), a programme developed for use in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) [Cary, NC, 
United States] by GSK. 
Vaccination schedule: At Visit 1, all subjects received a single dose of Boostrix or placebo. 
Subjects who received Boostrix at Visit 1 received a dose of placebo postdelivery (Visit 3), while those 
who received placebo at Visit 1 received Boostrix post-delivery (Visit 3). 
Control vaccine: The placebo received by the Control Group during pregnancy and by the dTpa Group 
post-delivery consisted of 0.5 mL of 150 mM saline water supplied as pre-filled syringes. 
Treatment allocation: The subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups in a 1:1 ratio. The 
randomisation algorithm used a minimisation procedure accounting for centre, age (≥18-<25 years, 
≥25-<35 years and ≥35-≤45 years), gestational age (27-32 weeks and 33-36 weeks) and country. 
Study duration: It was approximately 5 months for each subject, starting at the Screening Visit (Days 
-14–0) and ending at Visit 4 (post-delivery Month 2). 
Immunological assessment: Comprised a blood sample prior to and 1 month after vaccination for 
determination of antibodies to all vaccine antigens. Additionally, an umbilical cord blood sample was 
collected from all subjects at delivery for determination of antibodies to the pertussis antigens. 
Methods and results expression are described in section 6.1.2 Immunogenicity. 
Safety assessment: Detail safety assessments performed in the study are provided in section 7. 
Clinical safety aspects. 
Data collection: Data were collected electronically and recorded in the individual subject Case Report 
Forms (eCRF).

Figure 1. Study DTPA-047 design 
6.1.1.2.  Studies DTPA -048 and -049 (infants and toddlers) 
Experimental design: Phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multi-country, multicentre study with 2 
parallel groups. The study was conducted in the same countries as study DTPA-47, i.e., Australia, 
Canada, Czechia, Finland, Italy and Spain. 
Population:  
Study DTPA-048: Healthy infants 6 to 14 weeks of age (including 6 weeks and up to and including 14 
weeks and 6 days of age) born to mothers vaccinated in the DTPA-047 study. 
Study DTPA-049:Healthy infants 9 months of age at enrolment (Visit 1), born to mothers vaccinated 
with Boostrix during pregnancy or post-delivery in study DTPA-047 and who completed their primary 
vaccination course with Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 in study DTPA-048. 
Blinding: The study was conducted in an open-label manner as the treatment was similar between the 
2 groups. However, the study personnel operating SBIR and the site staff remained blinded towards 
the treatment allocation of subjects in study DTPA-047. 
Randomization: There was no randomisation of subjects into groups in this study. The enrolled infants 
were allocated to the same groups and retained the same subject numbers as their mothers in study 
DTPA-047. 
Assessment report  
EMA/496743/2020  
Page 13/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vaccination schedule:  
Study DTPA-048: All subjects received either 3 doses of Infanrix hexa coadministered with Prevenar 13 
at 2, 4 and 6 months or 2, 3 and 4 months, or 2 doses of Infanrix hexa co-administered with Prevenar 
13 at 3 and 5 months or 2 and 4 months, depending on the immunisation schedule of the country. In 
some countries/regions with an Infanrix hexa 3-dose routine national immunisation schedule, Prevenar 
13 could be administered either as a 2-dose or 3-dose primary vaccination schedule (according to the 
routine national immunisation schedule). 
Study DTPA-049: All subjects received a booster dose of Infanrix hexa coadministered with Prevenar 
13 between 11-18 months of age according to the routine national/local immunization schedule. 
Treatment allocation: As there was no randomisation, treatment numbers were allocated by dose. 
Study duration: 
Study DTPA-048: Approximately 3 months, for subjects vaccinated according to the 2-dose schedules 
(at 2 and 4 months, or at 3 and 5 months), or the 2, 3 and 4-month schedule, and approximately 5 
months for those vaccinated according to 2, 4 and 6-month schedule. 
Study DTPA-049: Approximately 9 to 10 months, starting with Visit 1 (9 months of age) and ending at 
telephone contact or at Visit 3 (18 or 19 months of age), depending on the time of vaccination. 
Immunological assessment: Comprised a blood sample prior to the first and 1 month after the last 
dose of the primary vaccination course (Study DTPA-048) or of the booster dose (Study DTPA-049) for 
determination of antibodies to vaccine antigens. Methods and results expression are described in 
section 6.1.2 Immunogenicity. 
Safety assessment: Detailed safety assessments performed in each study are provided in section 7. 
Clinical safety aspects. 
Data collection: Data were collected electronically and recorded in the individual subject eCRFs.

6.1.2.2.  Results expression 
Response to the vaccines’ antigens was assessed in term of percentage of seroprotected or 
seropositive subjects. Vaccine responses to B. pertussis antigens were further defined by using 
arbitrary criteria. Results were also presented in term of Ab GMT. 
A seropositive (or seroresponder) subject was a subject whose antibody titre was greater than or equal 
to the assay cut-off defined in the study (Table 2). 
A seroprotected subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was greater than or equal to 
the level defining clinical protection. The following seroprotection thresholds were applicable: 
✓  Anti-D antibody concentrations ≥0.1 IU/mL. 
✓  Anti-T antibody concentrations ≥0.1 IU/mL. 
✓  Anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥10 mIU/mL. 
✓  Anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibody titres ≥8 ED50. 
✓  Anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥0.15 µg/mL. 
✓  Anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide antibody concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL. 
Response to the pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN) antigens, 
was defined as: 
✓  Studies DTPA-047 and DTPA-049: 
- for subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration below the assay cut-off, post-vaccination 
antibody concentration ≥4 times the assay cut-off, 
- for subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration between the assay cut-off and < 4 times the 
assay cut-off, post-vaccination antibody concentration ≥4 times the pre-vaccination antibody 
concentration, and 
- for subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration ≥4 times the assay cut-off, post-vaccination 
antibody concentration ≥2 times the pre-vaccination antibody concentration. 
✓  Study DTPA-048: 
- for subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration below the assay cut-off, post-vaccination 
antibody concentration equal or above the assay cut-off; 
- for subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration equal or above the assay cut-off, post-
vaccination antibody concentration equal or above the pre-vaccination antibody concentration. 
6.1.3.  Study objectives and endpoints 
6.1.3.1.  Study DTPA-047 
The primary objective of the DTPA-047 study was confirmatory: to demonstrate that the maternally 
transferred antibodies against pertussis in the dTpa Group were superior to those in the Control Group 
in terms of geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for the pertussis antibodies, in the cord blood 
sample. The primary endpoint related to this objective was the assessment of anti-PT, anti-FHA and 
anti-PRN antibody concentrations at delivery (in the cord blood sample). 
Key secondary objectives of the study were about further evaluation of the immune responses to 
Boostrix, through the following endpoints: 
Assessment report

✓  Anti-D, anti-T, anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN seroprotection/seropositivity status and 
antibody concentrations, 1-month post-vaccination. 
✓  Vaccine response to anti-D, anti-T, anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibodies, 1-month post 
vaccination. 
✓  Anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN seropositivity status, in the cord blood sample. 
6.1.3.2.  Studies DTPA -048 and -049 
The primary objective of the DTPA-048 study was descriptive: to assess the immunological response to 
all vaccine antigen components of Infanrix hexa 1 month after the last dose of the primary vaccination 
in infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery. 
The primary endpoint related to this objective included immunogenicity with respect to the antigen 
components of Infanrix hexa: 
✓  Anti-D, anti-T, anti-HBs, anti-poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 and anti-polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate 
(anti-PRP) seroprotection status, 1 month after the last dose of primary vaccination. 
✓  Vaccine response to PT, FHA and PRN antigens, 1 month after the last dose of primary 
vaccination. 
The primary objective of the DTPA-049 study was descriptive: to assess the immunological response to 
all vaccine antigen components of Infanrix hexa 1 month after the booster dose in infants born to 
mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery. The primary 
endpoint related to this objective included immunogenicity with respect to the antigen components of 
Infanrix hexa: 
✓  Anti-D, anti-T, anti-HBs, anti-poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 and anti-PRP seroprotection status, 1 
month after the booster dose. 
✓  Booster response to PT, FHA, and PRN antigens, 1 month after the booster dose. 
Key secondary objectives of the 2 studies were about further evaluation of the immune responses to 
each of the study vaccines. The secondary endpoints related to these objectives included: 
✓  Evaluation of the persistence of antibodies before the first dose of Infanrix hexa (study DTPA-048) 
in infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or post-delivery in study 
DTPA-047: 
(i) 
Anti-D, anti-T, anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN seroprotection/seropositivity status and 
antibody concentrations. 
✓  Evaluation of the immune response to Infanrix hexa (studies DTPA-048 and DTPA-049) at the 
post-primary, pre-booster and post-booster dose timepoints: 
(i) 
Anti-D, anti-T, anti-poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, anti-HBs, and anti-PRP antibody 
concentrations or titres, 1 month after the last dose of primary vaccination in study 
DTPA-048, before booster vaccination and 1 month after booster vaccination in study 
DTPA-049. In addition, seroprotection status to all the above-mentioned antigens were 
assessed before booster vaccination in study DTPA-049. 
(ii) 
Anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibody concentrations and seropositivity status, 1 
month after the last dose of primary vaccination in study DTPA-048, before and 1 
month after booster vaccination in study DTPA-049.

✓  Evaluation of the immune response to Prevenar 13 (studies DTPA-048 and DTPA-049) at the post-
primary, pre-booster and post-booster dose timepoints: 
(i) 
Anti-pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) 
antibody concentrations, 1 month after the last dose of primary vaccination in study 
DTPA-048, before booster vaccination and 1 month after the booster vaccination in 
study DTPA-049. In addition, seropositivity rates to all the above-mentioned antigens 
were also evaluated in study DTPA-049 before the administration of the booster dose. 
6.1.4.  Statistical evaluation 
6.1.4.1.  Study cohorts 
The According-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity was used for the analyses of immune 
response to Boostrix in study DTPA-047 and to Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 in studies DTPA-048 and 
DTPA-049. The ATP cohort for immunogenicity in each study included all eligible subjects who complied 
with all protocol-defined procedures and intervals, had not received a vaccine not specified or 
forbidden in the protocol and had data available for at least 1 study vaccine component after 
vaccination with Boostrix or Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13. 
Besides these, an additional criterion for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity in study DTPA-047 was 
cord blood collection. Additional criteria for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity in study DTPA-048 were 
full term birth (defined as ≥37 weeks of gestation) and no presentation with a medical condition 
leading to exclusion from an ATP analysis. An additional criterion for the ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity in study DTPA-049 was the receipt of all vaccine doses in study DTPA-048. The 
Adapted ATP cohort was used whenever different timepoints from the 3 studies are presented 
together, to denote that for each timepoint the corresponding ATP cohort for immunogenicity has been 
used. 
Since more than 5% of the subjects with available immunogenicity data were eliminated from analysis 
for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, an analysis based on the TVC was performed to complement 
the ATP analysis. The Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC) for each study included all vaccinated subjects for 
whom data were available. 
6.1.4.2.  Statistical methods 
Between group assessment (Study DTPA-047): The criterion to demonstrate superiority of the immune 
response in the dTpa group to that in the control group for the pertussis antigens, in the cord blood 
sample in study DTPA-047, was that the lower limit (LL) of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the 
GMC ratio (dTpa group divided by control group) for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibodies was 
≥1.5. The CI of the group GMC ratios was computed using a 2-sample t-test assuming heterogeneity 
of variance. 
Within groups assessment (all studies): Percentages of subjects with antibody titres/concentrations 
above threshold values with exact 95% CIs; GMCs/geometric mean titres (GMTs) with exact 95% CIs; 
and anti-D, anti-T, anti-PT, anti FHA and anti-PRN vaccine response or booster response, with exact 
95% CIs, were calculated, as applicable for each study. 
GMC/GMT calculations were performed by taking the anti-log of the mean of the log10 
titre/concentration transformations. Antibody titres/concentrations below the cut-off of the assay were 
given an arbitrary value of half the cut-off for the purpose of GMT/GMC calculation.

EMA/496743/2020  
Page 21/57 
 
 
 
 
Results expression is detailed in section 6.1.2.2. 
The descriptive analyses of the immune responses to Boostrix were also performed by sub-group of 
gestational age (27-32, 33-36 weeks of gestation of foetus) and age of the mother (18-24, 25-34, 35-
45 years), at dose 1. In studies DTPA-048 and DTPA-049, the descriptive analysis of the immune 
response elicited by the study vaccine was also performed by dose schedule (2-dose versus 3-dose 
schedule, depending on the country recommendations). Whereas the gestational age at vaccination 
does not seem to influence the magnitude of infant’s immune responses to their vaccination, 3 doses 
versus 2 doses seem better for limiting the blunting effect. These analyses are however to be 
interpreted with caution since they were not powered to generate statistically significant results. The 
limited sample size, particularly for the 2-dose schedule and the 18-24y age of the mother sub-group, 
does not allow to draw meaningful conclusions. Consequently, the data are not discussed in this 
report. Data were discussed in the previous PAM/FUM (EMA/H/C/296/P46 131 and 132). 
Assessor’s comment 
Methods are overall acceptable. 
Primary and secondary objectives and endpoints are relevant. The seroprotection thresholds proposed 
as associated with clinical protection against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, 
Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are appropriate.  
Since there is no established correlate of vaccine protection for B. pertussis, vaccine responses to 
pertussis antigens were arbitrary defined. Although the definition of vaccine response used in study 
DTPA-048 is less stringent than the one used in both other studies, vaccine seroresponse rate could be 
underestimated for infants born from dTpa vaccinated mothers compared to the group of infants born 
from unvaccinated mothers. A more appropriate way (than seroresponse rate) to study a potential 
effect of maternal immunization (MI) on infant’s vaccination is to compare the GMC induced by the 
primary and booster vaccination in the dTpa and in the control groups. Accordingly, only results 
expressed in term of GMC are presented in this AR to describe the pertussis specific immune 
responses. 
6.2.  Results 
6.2.1.  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of 687 pregnant women vaccinated during the study DTPA-047, 583 (84.9%) were included in the ATP 
cohort for immunogenicity (291 subjects in the dTpa Group and 292 subjects in the Control Group). 
In study DTPA-048, of the 601 vaccinated infants, 542 (90.2%) were included in the ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity (268 subjects in the dTpa Group and 274 subjects in the Control Group). 
In study DTPA-049, of the 540 vaccinated infants/toddlers, 479 (88.7%) were included in the ATP 
cohort for immunogenicity (229 subjects in the dTpa Group and 250 subjects in the Control Group). 
Tables 3, 4 and 5 summarize the number of subjects who were vaccinated, completed the study or 
were withdrawn for all 3 studies, including the reasons for withdrawal.

Assessor’s comment 
In all 3 studies, similar proportion of subjects were withdrawn from the ATP cohort for immunogenicity 
in both groups.  
For study DTPA-047, the ATP cohort for immunogenicity consists of 84.6 and 84.4% of the total 
vaccinated cohort for dTpa and control groups, respectively. 
For study DTPA-048, the ATP cohort for immunogenicity consists of 90.5 and 89.8% of the total 
vaccinated cohort for dTpa and control groups, respectively.  
For study DTPA-049, the ATP cohort for immunogenicity consists of 87.1 and 90.3% of the TVC for 
dTpa and control groups, respectively.  
This is acceptable.

6.2.2.  Demographics 
The demographic characteristics for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity were well balanced between 
groups across the 3 studies (Table 6). The geographic ancestry reflected the regions where the studies 
were conducted with more than 90% of subjects of White/Caucasian origin in all studies. 
In study DTPA-047, the mean age was 32.5 years (SD 4.5) in dTpa group and 32.6 years (SD 4.4) in 
the control group. The mean gestational age at vaccination and at delivery (in weeks) was comparable 
between both groups. 
In study DTPA-048, the average age of subjects was 8.8 months (±1.7). Of the 542 subjects, 47.2% 
were females. A total of 11.2% of subjects were given a 2-dose schedule, while majority of the 
subjects (88.7%) received the study vaccines as a 3-dose schedule. More than 50% of the subjects’ 
mothers received Boostrix during 27-32 gestational weeks of the foetus. 
In study DTPA-049, the average age of subjects was 14.9 months (±2.5). Of the 479 subjects, 45.1% 
were females. Percentages of subjects vaccinated with either a 2-dose or a 3-dose schedule were 
comparable with those observed in study DTPA-048.

6.2.3.  Immunogenicity results 
6.2.3.1.  Immune responses to Diphtheria and Tetanus toxoids (Table 7) 
Anti-D and anti-T Ab titers were not assessed in cord blood samples at birth. 
Before the first dose of Infanrix hexa in infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix or placebo in 
study DTPA-047, 82.6% of infants in the dTpa group and 43.7% in the control group were 
seroprotected against diphtheria; 99.2% of infants in the dTpa group and 88.9% in the control group 
were seroprotected against tetanus. Anti-D and anti-T Ab GMCs were higher in the dTpa group 
compared to the control group. 
One month after completion of the primary vaccination, seroprotection against diphtheria and tetanus 
reached 100% for infants in both groups. The anti-D Ab GMCs were lower in the dTpa group compared 
to the control group (0.423 versus 2.746). Consequently,  the percentage of subjects that had Ab titer 
≥ 1.0 IU/ml was lower in the dTpa group when compared to the control group (76.5% versus 92.3%). 
There was no significant difference observed in the GMC values for anti-T in both study groups. 
Before the booster dose, 81.2% of infants in the dTpa group and 90.2% in the control group were 
seroprotected against diphtheria. The GMC value for anti-D was lower in dTpa group (0.207) when 
compared to control group (0.322). Similar proportion of subjects (96.4% and 95.1%) were 
seroprotected against tetanus respectively in dTpa group and control group. No differences were 
observed in the GMCs between the 2 groups for anti-T. 
One month after the booster vaccination, seroprotection against diphtheria and tetanus reached 100% 
for infants in both groups. A trend for lower anti-D GMC value was still observed in the dTpa group 
(6.114) when compared to the control group (8.402). Anti-T Ab GMCs were within the same range 
when comparing the 2 study groups.

Table 7. Percentage of subjects with anti-D and anti-T antibody concentration ≥ 0.1 IU/mL 
and geometric mean concentrations, before and 1 month after vaccination (ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity) 
Assessor’s comment 
As expected, higher percentages of infants born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy were 
seroprotected (cut-off ≥ 0.1 IU/ml) against diphtheria and tetanus before the primary vaccination 
(dTpa group) when compared to the infants born to mothers vaccinated post-delivery (control group). 
These higher percentages were also observed when considering the threshold associated with long 
term protection (≥ 1.0 IU/ml, for both anti-D [28.5% and 4.0% for dTpa and control groups] and anti-
T [88.4% and 17.4% for dTpa and control groups] Ab). This is reflected by the difference in GMC 
between both groups.   
All subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria and tetanus 1 month after primary vaccination with 
Infanrix hexa.  
The percentage of infants achieving the anti-T Ab cut-off of 1.0 IU/ml and the anti-T GMT values post-
primary vaccination were similar between groups. This was not the case for the immune response to

diphtheria toxoid. A trend for lower percentage of infants achieving the anti-D Ab cut-off of 1.0 IU/ml 
and lower anti-D GMT values were observed in the dTpa group when compared to the control group.  
In line with these observations, the percentage of seroprotected subjects against diphtheria before the 
boost was lower for dTpa group. Around 20%, instead of 10%, of the infants born to mothers 
vaccinated during pregnancy would be susceptible to diphtheria infection during a certain laps of time 
between post-primary and booster vaccination. Lower anti-D GMT were also observed before the 
booster dose in infants born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy compared to infants whose 
mothers did not receive dTpa immunisation during pregnancy in studies described in Maertens 2016, in 
Zimmermann 2019 and in Barug 2020. Conversely, no difference in pre-boost anti-D titers were 
observed between similar groups in Munoz 2014. During the assessment of study DTPA-049, the MAH 
was invited to discuss the clinical and epidemiological relevance of these observations (see also 
6.2.3.6.  Immune responses to Prevenar 13) in the present submission. The discussion mainly relies on 
post-boost data. 
All subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria and tetanus 1 month after the booster vaccination 
with Infanrix hexa. Most of the dTpa and control subjects achieved the threshold of 1.0 IU/ml 
associated with long term protection, even if lower an anti-D GMC value was still observed in the dTpa 
group. Conversely, a trend for a lower anti-T GMC value was observed in the control group compared 
to the dTpa group. These data suggest that the primary vaccination induced adequate immune 
memory in both group, i.e. independently of MI. 
6.2.3.2.  Immune response to HBs antigen (Tables 8 and 9) 
Anti-HBs Ab titers were neither assessed in cord blood samples at birth nor in infant’s samples before 
the primary vaccination. 
One month post-primary vaccination, 99.2% of subjects in the dTpa group and 98.5% of subjects in 
the control group had seroprotective anti-HBs Ab concentrations (≥10 mIU/mL). anti-HBs Ab GMCs 
were within the same range in both groups. 
Before booster vaccination, 94.1% of subjects in the dTpa group and 94.2% of subjects in the control 
group were still seroprotected against hepatitis B. 
One month post-booster vaccination, seroprotection against hepatitis B was 99.5% in the dTpa group 
and 99.2% in the control group. Anti-HBs Ab GMCs were within the same range in both groups 
resulting in a similar proportion of subjects achieving anti-HBs Ab titers ≥100 mIU/mL.

Assessor’s comment 
Percentages of infants that were seroprotected (cut-off ≥ 10 mIU/ml) against Hepatitis B 1 month 
after primary vaccination, before and 1 month after the boost with Infanrix hexa were high. 
Percentages of subjects mounting an Ab response ≥ 100 mIU/ml (threshold considered as a measure 
of an especially robust immune response) and GMC were similar between groups suggesting that 
maternal immunization does not interfere with the infant’s vaccine induced-protection against Hepatitis 
B. 
6.2.3.3.  Immune responses to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (Tables 10 and 11) 
Anti-poliovirus Ab titers were neither assessed in cord blood samples at birth nor in infant’s samples 
before the primary vaccination. 
One month post-primary vaccination, the percentage of subjects seroprotected against poliovirus types 
1, 2 and 3 (anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 antibody titres ≥8 ED50) was >95% of subjects in both 
groups. Ab GMCs were within the same range for both the dTpa and control groups. 
Before the booster vaccination, ≥ 88 % of subjects in both groups were seroprotected against 
poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3. 
One month post-booster vaccination, the seroprotective threshold of 8 ED50 for antipoliovirus types 1, 
2 and 3 was reached by all subjects in both groups. There were no differences between the 2 groups in 
terms of anti-poliovirus GMTs.

Assessor’s comment 
Percentages of infants that were seroprotected (cut-off ≥ 8 ED50) against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 
at 1 month after primary vaccination with Infanrix hexa were high. All the children were seroprotected 
against the 3 types of poliovirus one month after the booster dose with Infanrix hexa. No difference 
between the 2 groups in terms of anti-poliovirus GMT was observed suggesting that the MI does not 
interfere with the infant’s vaccine responses specific to poliovirus. 
6.2.3.4.  Immune responses to Haemophilus influenzae type b PRP (Tables 12 and 13) 
Anti-PRP Ab titers were neither assessed in cord blood samples at birth nor in infant’s samples before 
the primary vaccination. 
One month post-primary vaccination, 95.9% of subjects in the dTpa group and 94.5% of subjects in 
the control group had seroprotective anti-PRP antibody concentrations. No significant difference was 
observed in the GMC values for anti-PRP in both groups.

Before booster vaccination, 72.5% of subjects in the dTpa group and 68.0% of subjects in the control 
group were seroprotected against Hib. A trend for slightly lower anti-PRP GMC values was observed in 
the control group compared to the dTpa group. 
One month post-booster vaccination, 100% of subjects in the dTpa group and 99.6% of subjects in the 
control group had seroprotective anti-PRP antibody concentrations. Moreover, 99.5% subjects in the 
dTpa group and 97.6% subjects in the control group had anti-PRP Ab levels ≥1.0 µg/mL, indicative of 
long term protection. The trend for slightly lower anti-PRP GMC values was still observed after the 
boost in the control group compared to the dTpa group.

Percentages of infants that were seroprotected (cut-off ≥0.15 µg/ml) against Haemophilus influenzae 
type b 1 month after primary vaccination as well as after the booster dose with Infanrix hexa were

6.2.3.5.  Immune responses to Bordetella pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN)(Tables 14 and

The primary objective of study DTPA-047, to demonstrate that the concentration of maternally 
transferred antibodies against pertussis in the dTpa group is superior to that in the control group in 
terms of GMCs for the pertussis Ab, as measured in the cord blood at birth, was demonstrated. The LL 
of the 95% CI of the GMC ratio between groups (dTpa group divided by the control group) for anti-PT, 
anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibodies was 7.02, 13.48 and 15.86, respectively, which is well above the 
pre-defined criterion of 1.5.

objectives of studies DTPA-048 and DTPA-049 were descriptive. 
As already mentioned above and extensively discussed with the Belgian and the German Regulatory 
Authorities during a Scientific-Technical Advice meeting that took place on 3 June 2019, the vaccine 
seroresponse rate could be underestimated for infants born from dTpa vaccinated mothers compared 
to the group of infants born from unvaccinated mothers. Since there is no correlate of protection (CoP) 
regarding the B. pertussis infection, it is considered that the most appropriate way to study a potential 
effect of maternal immunization (MI) on infant’s vaccination is to compare the GMC induced by the 
primary vaccination in the dTpa and in the control groups. Therefore, seropositive rates and booster 
responses were not considered. 
In the cord blood (study DTPA-047), the anti-pertussis antibody GMCs were higher in the dTpa group 
when compared to the control group for the 3 antigens. 
Before the first dose of Infanrix hexa primary vaccination, the maternal antibodies against pertussis 
antigens were found to be persistent in the subjects and it was observed that subjects in dTpa group 
had higher antibody concentrations when compared to the subjects in control group. Pre-vaccination 
GMC were always higher in the dTpa group. 
At 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Infanrix hexa, all subjects in dTpa group had 
detectable anti-pertussis Ab (i.e. above or equal to the assay cut-off) but lower GMC values were

observed in the dTpa group when compared to the control group for Ab against all 3 pertussis 
antigens. One infant in the control group was not seropositive for anti-PRN Ab. 
Before the booster dose of Infanrix hexa, the GMCs for the anti-pertussis antibodies were slightly lower 
in the dTpa group when compared to control group. 
At 1 month after the booster dose of Infanrix hexa, all subjects in both groups were seropositive 
(antibody concentration ≥ assay cut-off) against pertussis antigens, except for 1 subject in the dTpa 
group who did not reach seropositive antibody level for anti-PT. Lower GMCs values were observed in 
the dTpa group for anti-PT and anti-FHA when compared to the control group. However, lower GMC 
value in the dTpa group compared to the control group was not observed for anti-PRN. Large fold 
increases of the GMCs from the pre-booster to the 1-month after booster was observed in dTpa group 
(anti-PT: 11.9-fold, anti-FHA: 13.6-fold, anti-PRN: 48.4-fold), and this in similar ranges as observed in 
the control group (anti-PT: 12.7-fold, anti-FHA: 11.3-fold, anti-PRN: 27.3-fold).

Assessor’s comment 
As expected, higher concentrations of Ab specific to PT, FHA and PRN were detected in the cord blood 
sample of infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during the pregnancy when compared to 
those born to mothers vaccinated post-delivery. The primary objective of study DTPA-047 was met. 
The LL of the 95% CI of the GMC ratio between groups for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibodies 
was above the pre-defined criterion of 1.5. The maternal Ab specific to the pertussis antigens were still 
detectable before the infant’s primary vaccination and, in line with the cord blood’s findings, Ab GMC 
values were higher in the dTpa group when compared to the control group. 
Conversely, at one month post-primary vaccination, lower GMC were observed for anti-PT, anti-FHA 
and anti-PRN Ab in the dTpa group when compared to the control group. 95% CI were not overlapping 
for all three antigens.  
Although, the concentrations of circulating Ab before the boost were comparable (only slightly lower 
values were observed in the control group compare to the dTpa group) between dTpa and control 
groups and in the same range than the titers observed in cord blood of infants born to non-vaccinated 
mothers, a blunting of the PT- and FHA- Ab responses was still observed at 1 month post-boost. 95% 
CI were not overlapping. Conversely, anti-PRN titers were higher for the dTpa group when compared 
to the control group.  
Large fold increases of the GMC values from the pre-booster to the 1-month after booster was 
observed in both dTpa and control groups, suggesting that infants of both groups developed an 
immune memory against B. pertussis.  
Findings of both studies DTPA-048 and DTPA-049 are in line with those of other studies that have 
assessed the blunting of pertussis response after the primary and the booster vaccination administered 
around 12 months of age (Hardy-Fairbanks 2013, Munoz 2014, Maertens 2016, Halperin 2018, Barug 
2019). Overall, all these publications show a trend for lower GMC of pertussis antigens-specific Ab in 
infants born to dTpa vaccinated mothers during the pregnancy compared to infants born to 
unvaccinated or post-partum vaccinated mothers. This is true for post-primary vaccination and post-
boost vaccination. The blunting of the majority of the antigen-specific Ab responses observed post-
primary vaccination was still observed post-boost. None of these studies have assessed the vaccine 
efficacy of MI in protecting infants from pertussis disease in parallel.  
Several studies assessed the vaccine efficacy/effectiveness of MI in preventing pertussis in young 
infants. Overall, MI does protect infants from pertussis disease before primary vaccination 
(Amirthalingam 2016, Baxter 2017, Bellido-Blasco 2017, Becker-Dreps 2018, , Saul 2018). Although 
the duration of the (additional) protection of MI varies across studies, no deleterious effect of MI was 
evidenced during and/or shortly after the primary vaccination (up to 5-6 months of age). 
Nevertheless, in the absence of CoP, the observed blunting of the pertussis response is difficult to 
interpret in term of clinical relevance. 
6.2.3.6.  Immune responses to Prevenar 13 (Tables 16 and 17) 
Overall, at 1 month after the subjects received the last dose of Prevenar 13, all subjects in both groups 
developed anti-pneumococcal (anti-PnPS) antibodies for serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 
19A, 19F and 23F. In both groups, >74% of subjects presented Ab ≥0.35 µg/mL. A trend for lower 
SPR was however observed for 5 out of 13 serotypes (4, 5, 6B, 9V and 23F). GMTs induced in dTpa 
group were generally slightly lower than those induced in the control group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/496743/2020  
Page 37/57 
 
 
 
 
Before the booster dose of Prevenar 13, percentages of subjects with Ab titers against pneumococcal 
antigens ≥0.35 µg/mL were variable. Slightly lower seroprotection rates for 2 serotypes (4 and 18C) 
were observed in dTpa group when compared to control group. No differences were observed in the 
GMCs between the 2 groups for anti-pneumococcal Ab except for both serotypes 4 and 18C for which 
slightly lower GMCs were observed in dTpa group when compared to control group. 
At 1 month after the booster dose of Prevenar 13, >79% of subjects presented Ab ≥0.35 µg/mL in 
both groups for anti-pneumococcal Ab serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F. 
There were no differences between the 2 groups in terms of anti-pneumococcal Ab GMCs.

Assessor’s comment 
A trend for higher GMC of Ab specific to most of the serotypes was observed for the control group 
compared to the dTpa group, post primary vaccination. Percentages of subjects achieving the cut-off of 
0.35 µg/ml, considered as the protective threshold, were generally high but were slightly lower for 5 
out of 13 serotypes when compared to percentages observed in the control group. Difference in  
immune responses, post-primary vaccination, to various serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae in 
infants born to mothers dTpa vaccinated compared to infants born to unvaccinated mothers during 
pregnancy was also described in the literature (Zimmerman 2019, Barug 2020). 
Assessment report  
EMA/496743/2020  
Page 42/57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lower Streptococcus pneumoniae immunogenicity at pre-booster timepoint was observed for serotypes 
4 (13.4 vs 27.2%) and 18C (19.9 vs 34.2%) in dTpa subjects as compared to the control group. 
Around twofold of the infants born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy would therefore be 
susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection due to serotypes 4 and 18C during a certain 
(unknown) laps of time between post-primary and booster vaccination. Only few data are currently 
available in the literature. Lower anti-PnPS specific to several serotypes, including 4 and 18C, were 
also observed before the booster dose in infants born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy 
compared to infants whose mothers did not receive dTpa immunisation during pregnancy 
(Zimmermann 2019). Conversely, no difference in the level of pre-boost anti-PnPS specific to several 
serotypes was observed between similar groups in Barug 2020. During the assessment of study DTPA-
049, the MAH was invited to discuss the clinical and epidemiological relevance of these observations 
(see also 6.2.3.1.  Immune responses to Diphtheria and Tetanus toxoids) in the present submission. 
The MAH has now specified that these findings are not considered conclusive since the analyses were 
exploratory. 
One month post-boost, similar proportion of infants achieved the threshold associated with protection 
between groups. GMC values were in general slightly lower for infants in dTpa group when compared 
to infants in control group but CI 95% were always overlapping.  
Overall, post-boost results indicate that the MI did not impact the proportion of the infants achieving 
the seroprotection threshold for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes. 
6.3.  Discussion 
Maternal immunisation (MI) with combined reduced-antigen content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular 
pertussis (dTpa) vaccines is currently recommended by several national health authorities worldwide 
with the aim of passively protecting the neonates and young infants from pertussis disease. 
Effectiveness of MI against pertussis disease in the first months of life (before infant’s primary 
vaccination) has been described in the literature (Amirthalingam 2016, Baxter 2017, Bellido-Blasco 
2017, Becker-Dreps 2018, , Saul 2018). Consequently, vaccination during pregnancy is currently 
included in the therapeutic indication of dTpa vaccines.  
Nevertheless, growing evidences indicate that MI with a dTpa vaccine also results in immune 
interference with infant’s vaccination in these infants born to mothers dTpa-vaccinated during the 
pregnancy when compared to those born to dTpa- unvaccinated or post-partum vaccinated mothers. 
In 2013-2014, GSK has initiated a MI clinical development programme, that included 3 Phase IV 
studies, to gain further insights on the immunogenicity and safety of maternal vaccination with the 
dTpa vaccine Boostrix and the impact on infants’/toddlers’ immune responses after their primary and 
booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa. The first study, DTPA-047, was a randomized, placebo-
controlled, multicentre study that evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of Boostrix when 
administered to pregnant women aged 18–45 years during the third trimester of pregnancy. Both 
other studies, DTPA-048 and DTPA-049, were non-randomised, open label, multicentre studies that 
evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of Infanrix hexa given in the primary vaccination schedule 
(DTPA-048) or as a booster dose (DTPA-049) to infants and toddlers born to mothers participating in 
study DTPA-047. In DTPA-048, Infanrix hexa was administered with Prevenar 13 in a 2- or 3- dose 
schedule according to the country of enrolment. In DTPA-049, Infanrix hexa was co-administered with 
Prevenar 13. All the toddlers included in the study DTPA-049 completed their primary vaccination in 
study DTPA-048. 
Immunogenicity assessment consisted in the measurement of specific Ab. Only Ab specific to the 3 
pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN) were assessed in cord blood samples (DTPA-047), whereas anti-D 
and anti-T Ab were measured before and after primary or booster infant’s vaccination in parallel to the 
Assessment report

pertussis-specific immune responses (DTPA -048 and -049). Humoral immune responses to all other 
components of the paediatric Infanrix hexa vaccine were assessed in infants and toddlers after the 
primary vaccination (DTPA-048) as well as before and after the booster vaccination (DTPA-049). The 
clinical protections against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type 
b and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections were defined by their serological correlates of protection. 
The seroprotection thresholds were ≥0.1 IU/mL for anti-D and anti-T Ab concentrations, ≥10 mIU/mL 
for anti-HBs Ab concentrations, ≥8 ED50 for anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 Ab titres, ≥0.15 μg/mL 
for anti-PRP Ab concentrations and ≥ 0.35 µg/mL for anti-PnPS Ab concentrations. Regarding pertussis 
immune responses, criteria defining seroresponse as per protocol were not appropriate, particularly for 
infants with high level of specific Ab pre-vaccination. Since there is no correlate of protection (CoP) 
regarding the B. pertussis infection, results expression in term of GMC was deemed more relevant. 
The primary objective of study DTPA-047 was met. The concentration of maternally transferred Ab 
against the 3 pertussis antigens, as measured in the cord blood at birth, in the dTpa group was 
demonstrated to be superior to that in the control group. The LL of the 95% CI of the GMC ratio 
between groups for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN Ab was above the pre-defined criterion of 1.5. The 
maternal Ab against the pertussis antigens were found to be persistent, although at lower GMC, at 8-9 
weeks of age. These results confirm the reported active transplacental transport of Ab (Healy, 2016, 
Hardy-Fairbanks 2013, Munoz 2014, Maertens 2016, Villarreal Pérez 2017, Halperin 2018, Barug 2019, 
Perret 2020) and strongly suggest the involvement of the maternal Ab in the protection of the 
offspring against (severe) pertussis disease during the first months of life. The positive impact of the 
MI in protecting infants against infections was also demonstrated for diphtheria and tetanus diseases; 
percentages of seroprotected infants against both diseases were higher in the dTpa group when 
compared to the control group at 8-9 weeks of age. These high percentages in the dTpa group indicate 
that the neonates were protected from birth until the start of the primary vaccination.  
In line with the literature, MI was shown to interfere with the infants’ immune responses to the 
hexavalent primary and boost vaccination. The blunting effect was specific to certain homologous and 
heterologous antigens. Whereas no immune interferences were observed, at any timepoint tested, for 
tetanus, Hepatitis B, poliovirus type 1, 2 and 3 and Haemophilus influenzae type b infections, blunting 
of the immune responses specific to diphtheria, Streptococcus pneumoniae or B. pertussis were 
observed. 
Lower anti-D GMT were observed post-primary and post-booster vaccination in the dTpa group when 
compared to the control group. This lower anti-D GMC results in a lower percentage of infants 
achieving the cut-off associated with long term protection against diphtheria (≥ 1.0 IU/ml anti-D Ab) 
post-primary vaccination and a lower percentage of seroprotected subjects against diphtheria (≥ 0.1 
IU/ml anti-D Ab) before the boost in the dTpa group (81.2%) when compare to the control group 
(90.2%).  
Similarly, a trend for lower GMC of Ab specific to most of the serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae 
was observed for the dTpa group compared to the control group, both at post-primary and post-
booster vaccination timepoints. This trend translates into lower percentages of subjects achieving the 
cut-off of 0.35 µg/ml in the dTpa group for 5 out 13 serotypes when compared to the control group 
post-primary vaccination. Lower percentage of Streptococcus pneumoniae seroprotected subjects at 
pre-booster timepoint was observed for serotypes 4 (13.4 vs 27.2%) and 18C (19.9 vs 34.2%) in dTpa 
group as compared to the control group. These results should however be interpreted with caution 
since the analyses of the immune responses specific to Streptococcus pneumoniae were exploratory. 
Meanwhile, these results suggest that around twofold of the infants born to mothers vaccinated during 
pregnancy would therefore be susceptible to diphtheria and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection due to 
serotypes 4 and 18C during a certain (unknown) laps of time between post-primary and booster 
Assessment report

vaccination. Published clinical trials also reported lower level of anti-D (Maertens 2016, Zimmermann 
2019, Barug 2020) and lower level of anti-PnPs specific to several serotypes, including 4 and 18C, 
(Zimmermann 2019) before the booster dose in infants born to mothers vaccinated during pregnancy 
compared to infants whose mothers did not receive dTpa immunisation during pregnancy. Conversely, 
no difference in pre-boost anti-D titers or levels of anti-PnPs specific to several serotypes were 
observed between similar groups in Munoz 2014 and in Barug 2020 respectively. Differences in 
vaccine-induced immune response specific to pneumococcal serotypes that are evidenced in the 
literature and the present study might be due to the difference in carrier proteins included in the 
vaccines. Nevertheless, the duration of this potential window of susceptibility and the clinical 
consequences of these observations are not yet known. More data need to be accumulated. Because of 
these uncertainties, the study limitation and the overall scarcity of the data, these observations are not 
deemed to be reflected in the SmPC.  
In addition, although GMT of Ab specific to diphtheria and to various serotypes of Streptococcus 
pneumoniae tend to be lower in dTpa group compared to the control group at 1 month after the boost 
vaccination, all subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria and >99% of the subjects of dTpa 
group achieved the anti-D Ab threshold associated with long-term protection. The percentages of 
subjects achieving the protective threshold of 0.35 µg/ml to the various serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) of Streptococcus pneumoniae were generally high (ranging from 
79 to 100%) and comparable between groups, suggesting that the subjects of both groups are 
comparatively able to mount an anamnestic response. Thus, the observed (slight) interference of MI 
on infant’s Ab concentration post-vaccination is not likely to be clinically relevant in the short term. 
Results and interpretation of immune responses to pertussis antigens are more difficult to interpret 
since there is currently no correlate of vaccine protection. 
Lower GMC were observed at one month post-primary vaccination for anti-PT, anti-FHA and anti-PRN 
Ab in the dTpa group when compared to the control group. One month post-boost, lower PT- and FHA- 
Ab responses were still observed in infants whose mothers did receive dTpa immunisation during 
pregnancy when compare to control infants. Conversely, anti-PRN titers were higher for the dTpa 
group when compared to the control group. The observed results are in line with those of other studies 
that have assessed the induction of pertussis-specific immune response after the primary vaccination 
(Ladhani 2015, Villarreal Pérez 2017) or after both the primary and the booster vaccination 
administered around 12 months of age (Hardy-Fairbanks 2013, Munoz 2014, Maertens 2016, Halperin 
2018, Barug 2019) in infants born to dTpa vaccinated versus unvaccinated mothers during pregnancy. 
Overall, all these publications show a trend for lower GMC of pertussis antigens-specific Ab in infants 
born to dTpa vaccinated mothers during the pregnancy compared to in infants born to unvaccinated or 
post-partum vaccinated mothers. This is true for post-primary vaccination and post-boost vaccination. 
The blunting of the majority of the antigen-specific Ab responses observed post-primary vaccination 
was still observed post-boost. The blunting effect was observed with different vaccines used for 
maternal and childhood immunisation, suggesting that the blunting effect is not product-specific. This 
class effect is reviewed in Kandeil 2020. In the absence of CoP, the clinical relevance of these 
observations is not known. Similarly, it is not known whether it could also reflect an altered induction 
of immune memory and the ‘real’ (long-term) impact of MI for the infants can therefore not be 
determined. Comparable fold increases of the anti-pertussis antigens Ab GMC from the pre-booster to 
the 1-month after booster were observed in both dTpa and control groups of study DTPA-049, 
suggesting that infants of both groups developed an immune memory against B. pertussis. Yet, even if 
these data suggest that an immune memory was induced by the vaccination, it is not known for which 
duration and if the quality of the recall responses would be unaffected.  
Assessment report  
EMA/496743/2020  
Page 45/57 
 
 
 
 
Current epidemiological (UK and US) data are reassuring regarding the absence of any clinical impact 
of the blunting of infants immune responses during and/or shortly after the primary vaccination. 
Uncertainties yet remain for the long-term clinical protection (> 2 years following vaccination). 
Upcoming epidemiological data from countries where the vaccine coverage of pregnant women is high 
would help to further insight the potential impact on the protection against pertussis disease. A close 
monitoring of the epidemiology is warranted to better assess the impact of MI on the short and the 
long-term and, if needed, to adapt the vaccination strategies, i.e. choice of the vaccine and schedule 
(2 vs 3 doses, additional dose etc). As recommended by the VWP, the MAH should follow and report 
these data in PSURs. 
Implications for the SmPC: 
MI has proved its benefit in protecting neonates against (severe) pertussis disease during the first 
months of life. On the other hand, MI has been shown to interfere with immune responses of infants to 
their childhood vaccination. 
As previously discussed at VWP, these data could be reflected in the SmPC in section 5.1. Accordingly, 
the MAH proposes the following wording to be added in section 5.1: 
‘Immunogenicity in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy 
The immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa in infants and toddlers born to healthy mothers vaccinated with 
dTpa at 27-36 weeks of pregnancy was evaluated in two clinical studies. 
Infanrix hexa was co-administered with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to infants at 2, 4 
and 6 months or 2, 3 and 4 months in three-dose primary vaccination schedules (n=241), or at 3 and 
5 months or 2 and 4 months in two-dose primary vaccination schedules (n=27); and to the same 
infants/toddlers from 11 to 18 months as booster dose (n=229). 
Post-primary and post-booster vaccination, immunological data did not show clinically relevant 
interference of maternal vaccination with dTpa on the infant’s and toddler’s responses to diphtheria, 
tetanus, hepatitis B, inactivated poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b or pneumococcal antigens. 
Lower antibody concentrations against pertussis antigens post-primary (PT, FHA and PRN) and post-
booster (PT, FHA) vaccination were observed in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with 
dTpa during pregnancy. The fold-increases of anti-pertussis antibody concentrations from the pre-
booster to the 1-month post-booster time point were in the same range for infants and toddlers born 
to mothers vaccinated with dTpa or with placebo, demonstrating effective priming of the immune 
system. 
In the absence of correlates of protection for pertussis, the clinical relevance of these observations 
remains to be fully understood. However, current epidemiological data on pertussis disease following 
the implementation of dTpa maternal immunisation do not suggest any clinical relevance of this 
immune interference.’ 
The proposed wording is  deemed appropriate.

7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
7.1.1.  Safety objectives and endpoints 
The safety and reactogenicity of the study vaccines were evaluated as secondary objectives. The safety 
and reactogenicity of Boostrix are not in the scope of the current submission, therefore the safety 
endpoints that were followed in study DTPA-047 are not described in the present report. 
The safety objectives in studies DTPA-048 and DTPA-049 were evaluated based on the following 
endpoints: 
✓  Occurrence of solicited local and general adverse events (AEs) during the 4-day (Days 0–3) follow-
up period after each vaccination 
✓  Occurrence of unsolicited AEs during the 31-day (Days 0–30) follow-up period after each 
vaccination 
✓  Occurrence of serious AEs (SAEs) from first vaccination dose (study DTPA-048) or booster dose 
(study DTPA-049) to study end 
In addition to these safety endpoints, neurodevelopmental status was to be assessed at 9 and 18 
months of age adjusted for prematurity in study DTPA-049. The neurodevelopmental status was 
evaluated based on the following endpoints: 
✓  Proportion of infants with an Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 (ASQ-3) score in the black zone in 
any domain. 
✓  Proportion of infants with an ASQ-3 score in the black zone for gross motor skills. 
✓  Proportion of infants with an ASQ-3 score in the black zone for fine motor skills. 
✓  Proportion of infants with an ASQ-3 score in the black zone for communication. 
✓  Proportion of infants with an ASQ-3 score in the black zone for problem solving skills. 
✓  Proportion of infants with an ASQ-3 score in the black zone for personal-social skills. 
✓  Proportion of infants referred for formal neurodevelopmental evaluation using Bayley Scale for 
Infant Development, Version III (BSID-III). 
✓  Proportion of infants with at least 1 of the indicators of neurodevelopmental impairment using 
BSID-III. 
7.1.2.  Statistical analysis of safety endpoints 
7.1.2.1.  Study cohorts 
The primary analysis in both studies (DTPA-048 and DTPA-049) was performed on the TVC, defined as 
all subjects with at least 1 vaccine administration documented. In study DTPA-049, the 
neurodevelopmental delay analysis was performed on the Total enrolled cohort, which included all 
subjects enrolled in that study. The congenital anomalies analysis from study DTPA-049 was performed 
Assessment report  
EMA/496743/2020  
Page 47/57 
 
 
 
 
on the Total enrolled cohort infants, defined as delivered infants in study DTPA-047 followed up until 
the end of the booster study DTPA-049. 
7.1.2.2.  Statistical methods 
All safety objectives were descriptive. For each study, the following analyses were tabulated: 
✓  The percentage of doses and/or subjects reporting solicited local and general AEs within 4-day 
follow-up period with exact 95% CIs, unsolicited AEs and SAEs, including fatal SAEs classified by 
the MedDRA Preferred Terms with exact 95% CIs. 
✓  Neurodevelopmental status of the subjects was assessed in the context of Boostrix vaccination 
during pregnancy depending on the ASQ-3 score. The proportion of subjects in the black zone for 
any domain, for gross motor skills, fine motor skills, communication, problem solving skills and 
personal-social skills, was tabulated. The proportion of infants referred for a formal 
neurodevelopmental evaluation using BSID-III and those with at least 1 indicator of 
neurodevelopmental impairment using BSID-III was also tabulated. 
7.2.  Results - studies DTPA-048 and DTPA-049 
7.2.1.  Extent of exposure 
A total of 601 subjects were included in the TVC in study DTPA-048. Of these, 540 subjects were 
included in the TVC in study DTPA-049. The number of doses distributed as well as the number of 
subjects receiving 1, 2 or 3 doses of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 are summarised in Table below.

7.2.2.  Solicited AEs 
7.2.2.1.  Solicited local AEs 
In study DTPA-048, during the 4-day post-vaccination period following primary vaccination, redness 
was the most frequently reported solicited local AE at the Infanrix hexa injection site, with incidences 
of 62.9% in the dTpa Group and 61.1% in the Control Group (overall/subject). Pain and swelling were 
reported for 56.1% and 46.6% of subjects, respectively, in the dTpa Group and for 54.8% and 45.5% 
of subjects, respectively, in the Control Group (overall/subject). The most frequently reported solicited 
local AE following vaccination with Prevenar 13 was redness and was reported in 55.6% of subjects in 
the dTpa Group and 56.1% of subjects in the Control Group, respectively. Pain and swelling were 
reported for 53.9% and 38.9% of subjects, respectively, in the dTpa Group, and for 50.5% and 42.2% 
of subjects, respectively, in the Control Group (overall/subject). 
Grade 3 solicited local AEs at the Infanrix hexa injection site were reported by ≤3.4% of subjects in 
the dTpa Group and by ≤4.6% of subjects in the Control Group. At the Prevenar 13 injection site, 
grade 3 solicited local AEs were reported by ≤3.1% of subjects in the dTpa Group and by ≤3.6% of 
subjects in the Control Group. 
In study DTPA-049, during the 4-day post-vaccination period following booster vaccination, redness 
was the most frequently reported solicited local AE at the Infanrix hexa injection site, reported for 
49.0% and 53.5% of subjects in the dTpa and Control Groups, respectively. Pain and swelling were

reported for 46.3% and 40.1% of subjects, respectively, in the dTpa Group and for 49.8% and 38.5% 
of subjects, respectively in the Control Group. Redness was also the most frequently reported solicited 
AE at the Prevenar 13 injection site, reported for 46.7% and 48.2% of subjects in the dTpa and 
Control Groups, respectively. Pain and swelling were reported for 44.0% and 33.9% of subjects, 
respectively, in the dTpa Group, and for 45.3% and 31.4% of subjects, respectively, in the Control 
Group. 
Grade 3 solicited local AEs at the Infanrix hexa injection site were reported for no more than 8.2% and 
8.7% of subjects in the dTpa and Control Groups, respectively. Grade 3 solicited local AEs at the 
Prevenar 13 injection site were reported for no more than 5.4% and 5.8% of subjects in the dTpa and 
Control Groups, respectively. 
7.2.2.2.  Solicited general AEs 
In study DTPA-048, the most frequently reported solicited general AE during the 4-day period following 
primary vaccination was irritability/fussiness, reported for 86.7% of subjects in the dTpa Group and 
84.8% of subjects in the Control Group. Irritability/fussiness was also the most frequently reported 
grade 3 solicited general AE, reported for 12.2% of subjects in each group. Fever was reported at 
similar incidence in both groups (42.9% of subjects in the dTpa Group and 41.6% of subjects in the 
Control Group). Grade 3 fever was reported for 1.4% of subjects in the dTpa Group and 0.3% of 
subjects in the Control Group. Grade 3 solicited general AEs considered by the investigator as causally 
related to vaccination were reported for ≤10.9% of subjects in the dTpa Group and ≤11.6% of 
subjects in the Control Group. 
In study DTPA-049, the most frequently reported solicited general AE during the 4-day period following 
booster vaccination was irritability, reported for 63.2% and 68.4% of subjects in the dTpa and Control 
Groups, respectively. Irritability was also the most frequently reported grade 3 solicited general AE, 
reported for 5.0% and 10.2% of subjects in the dTpa and Control Groups, respectively. Fever was 
reported for 28.3% and 30.9% of subjects in the dTpa and Control Groups, respectively. Grade 3 fever 
was reported for no more than 2.7% of subjects across both groups. Grade 3 solicited general AEs 
considered by the investigator as causally related to vaccination were reported for no more than 4.3% 
and 9.5% of subjects in the dTpa and Control Groups, respectively. 
7.2.3.  Unsolicited AEs 
In study DTPA-048, during the 31-day period following each Infanrix hexa primary vaccination co-
administered with Prevenar 13: 
✓  at least 1 unsolicited AE was reported for 54.4% and 56.7% of subjects in the dTpa and Control 
Groups, respectively. The most frequently reported unsolicited AE was upper respiratory tract 
infection reported for 12.2% and 10.8% of subjects in the dTpa and Control Groups, respectively. 
✓  at least 1 grade 3 unsolicited AE was reported for 5.1% and 5.9% of subjects in the dTpa and

site bruising, injection site mass and increase in body temperature in the Control Group, reported 
each for 2 (0.2%) subjects. No grade 3 causally related unsolicited AEs were reported. 
In study DTPA-049, during the 31-day period following the booster dose of Infanrix hexa co-
administered with Prevenar 13: 
✓  at least 1 unsolicited AE was reported for 35.7% and 40.1% of subjects in the dTpa and Control 
Groups, respectively. The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs were pyrexia and 
nasopharyngitis in the dTpa Group, reported for 4.6% of subjects, and pyrexia in the Control 
Group, reported for 7.9% of subjects. 
✓  at least 1 grade 3 unsolicited AE was reported for 7.2% and 5.8% of subjects in the dTpa and 
Control Groups, respectively. The most frequently reported grade 3 unsolicited AEs were ear 
infection in the dTpa Group, reported for 2.3% of subjects, and pyrexia in the Control Group, 
reported for 1.4% of subjects. 
✓  at least 1 unsolicited AE considered as causally related to vaccination was reported for 3.8% and 
3.6% of subjects in the dTpa and Control Groups, respectively. The most commonly reported AEs 
were vomiting in the dTpa Group (1.5% of subjects) and injection site mass in the Control Group 
(0.7% of subjects). No grade 3 causally related unsolicited AEs were reported. 
7.2.4.  SAEs and fatal outcomes 
During study DTPA-048, a total of 9 SAEs were reported for 7 subjects (2.4%) in the dTpa Group and a 
total of 23 SAEs were reported for 17 subjects (5.6%) in the Control Group. None of the reported SAEs 
were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination, and no fatal cases were 
reported in this study. At the end of the study, all SAEs recovered/resolved or were 
recovering/resolving except for 5 SAEs (3 SAEs in the dTpa Group and 2 SAEs in the Control Group). 
Following booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa co-administered with Prevenar 13 in study DTPA-049, 
a total of 3 SAEs were reported for 3 subjects (1.1%) in the Control Group; no SAEs were reported in 
the dTpa Group. None of the reported SAEs were assessed by the investigator as causally related to 
vaccination. All SAEs had resolved/recovered by the end of the study. 
During the entire study period for study DTPA-049 (from Visit 1, at the age of 9 months of the subject, 
up to Visit 3 [1-month post-booster dose], at the age of 18-19 months, depending on the national 
recommendation for the administration of the booster dose), a total of 12 SAEs were reported for 3 
subjects in the dTpa Group and a total of 7 SAEs were reported for 5 subjects in the Control Group. 
Throughout the study period, 1 fatal case was reported in the dTpa Group for a 16 months-old male 
subject before the administration of the booster dose. The subject had a history of congenital 
cytomegalovirus infection who developed enterovirus gastroenteritis, encephalopathy, refractory 
shock, gastroenteritis astroviral, intracranial hypertension, dehydration and rhabdomyolysis 310 days 
after receiving the third dose of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 in study DTPA-048. The patient had 
enterovirus and astrovirus infections concurrently. 
Death occurred after 2 days. Given the long time to onset of events and the underlying infection, the 
case was assessed by the investigator as not related to the primary vaccination received in study 
DTPA-048. 
Except for the fatal case, all SAEs had recovered/resolved by the end of study DTPA-049 (2 of which 
recovered/resolved with sequelae). None of these SAEs nor the fatal case were considered by the 
investigator as causally related to vaccination.

7.2.5.  Other significant AEs 
7.2.5.1.  AEs leading to withdrawal 
In study DTPA-048, 1 subject in the dTpa Group was withdrawn from the study due to 2 SAEs 
(enterorrhagia and cow’s milk allergy, assessed by the investigator as not related to vaccination). No 
subjects withdrew from study DTPA-049 due to AEs/SAEs after the administration of the booster dose. 
7.2.5.2.  Medically attended visits 
In study DTPA-048, at least 1 unsolicited AE with medically attended visit was reported for 36.5% of 
subjects in the dTpa Group and 37.7% of subjects in the Control Group, respectively. In study DTPA-
049, at least 1 unsolicited AE with medically attended visit was reported for 22.8% of subjects in the 
dTpa Group and 25.6% of subjects in the Control Group. 
7.2.5.3.  Congenital anomalies 
Congenital anomalies were evaluated in the context of Boostrix vaccination of pregnant women. The 
analysis for the congenital anomalies was performed on the Total enrolled cohort infants (DTPA-047) 
and is reported from delivered infants in study DTPA-047 up to the end of the booster study DTPA-049. 
In the dTpa Group, at least 1 congenital anomaly in infants was reported for 35 subjects (10.4%), of 
which atrial septal defect (1.5%) and plagiocephaly (1.2%) were the most commonly reported. In the 
Control Group, at least 1 congenital anomaly in infants was reported for 44 subjects (12.9%), of which 
atrial septal defect (2.3%) and phimosis (1.5%) were the most commonly reported. 
7.2.6.  Neurodevelopmental status (study DTPA-049) 
Neurodevelopmental status was evaluated in the context of Boostrix vaccination of pregnant women, 
on the Total enrolled cohort (infants in study DTPA-049).  
At 9 or 18 months of age, 11.5% and 11.0% of subjects in the dTpa and Control Groups, respectively, 
reported a score in the black zone for at least 1 domain of ASQ-3. At 9 or 18 months of age, 4.61% 
and 5.84% of subjects in the dTpa and Control Groups, respectively, had at least 1 indicator of 
neurodevelopmental delay. 
Assessor’s comment 
In study DTPA-048, 601 infants (296 and 305 in the dTpa and control groups respectively) received 
both Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 vaccines and were evaluated for safety. A total of 1718 doses (849 
and 869 doses in dTpa and control groups respectively) of Infanrix hexa were administrated. A total of 
1643 doses (812 and 831 in dTpa and control groups respectively) of Prevenar 13 were administrated. 
In study DTPA-049, 540 infants (263 and 277 in the dTpa and control groups respectively) received 
both Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 vaccines and were evaluated for safety. A total of 540 doses (263 
and 277 doses in dTpa and control groups respectively) of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 were 
administrated.

Both vaccines were well tolerated. The safety profile was similar in both groups, regardless of 
exposure/non-exposure of the mothers to Boostrix during pregnancy. The frequency of the reported 
solicited and unsolicited AEs were in line with the frequency described in the Infanrix hexa PI. 
The neurodevelopmental evaluation performed in study DTPA-049 at 9 and 18 months of age showed 
similar results in both dTpa and control groups regardless of the vaccination status of the mothers. 
SAEs were reported with a similar incidence across groups in both studies, and none of them was 
considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. One fatal case was reported in the 
dTpa group for a 16 months-old male subject before the administration of the booster dose. The case 
was considered by the investigator as not related to the primary vaccination. This subject should not 
have been included in the study since he did not satisfy all the inclusion criteria at study entry. 
7.3.  Discussion 
Both vaccines were well tolerated. The safety profile was similar in both groups, regardless of 
exposure/non-exposure of the mothers to Boostrix during pregnancy. The frequency of the reported 
solicited and unsolicited AEs were in line with the frequency described in the Infanrix hexa PI. 
The neurodevelopmental evaluation performed in study DTPA-049 at 9 and 18 months of age showed 
similar results in both dTpa and control groups regardless of the vaccination status of the mothers. 
SAEs were reported with a similar incidence across groups in both studies, and none of them was 
considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. One fatal case was reported in the 
dTpa group for a 16 months-old male subject before the administration of the booster dose. The case 
was considered by the investigator as not related to the primary vaccination. 
Implications for the SmPC: 
The assessor agrees with the MAH which considers that there were no new identified AEs nor changes 
required in the frequency or severity of AEs listed in the Infanrix hexa PI. Moreover, the safety and 
reactogenicity profiles of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 are not influenced by the maternal vaccination 
with Boostrix. 
The MAH proposed the following wording to be added in the section 4.8:  
‘In two clinical studies, Infanrix hexa has been administered to more than 500 subjects born to 
mothers vaccinated with dTpa (n=341) or placebo (n=346) during the third trimester of pregnancy 
(see section 5.1). The safety profile of Infanrix hexa was similar regardless of exposure/non-exposure 
to dTpa during pregnancy..’ 
The MAH also took the opportunity to update of the Table summarizing the Adverse Reactions to 
reclassify the frequency for “Fatigue” and “Somnolence”. In the current PI, “Drowsiness” was encoded 
under the MedDRA Preferred Term “Fatigue”, a subjective feeling that cannot be reported by infants 
and toddlers. Conversely, “Somnolence” describe the observation of the infants’ and toddlers’ 
behaviours. Hence “Somnolence” is a more appropriate MedDRA Preferred Term for “Drowsiness” in 
this population. This recoding will also align the PI of Infanrix hexa with the PIs of GSK’s lower valent 
DTPa combination vaccines.

8.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to describe the safety  
and immunogenicity in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy. 
The  frequency  of  ARs  was  modified  following  the  reclassification  of  frequency  for  “Fatigue”  and 
“Somnolence”. 
The MAH was requested to propose a more appropriate wording for both statements in the sections 4.8 
and 5.1. Updated version of the PI is now deemed appropriate. 
Changes are also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template version 10.1. 
The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. The posology information in the PL was also updated 
to align it with the SmPC.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
The exact number of mothers vaccinated during pregnancy with dTpa or with placebo and the 
trimester of pregnancy during which women were vaccinated have been included in the proposed 
wording. The Company also proposes to add a cross-reference to the section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic 
properties as this section contains more information on the two clinical trials.  
Exact wording included in the PI: 
 In two clinical studies, Infanrix hexa has been administered to more than 500 subjects born to 
mothers vaccinated with dTpa (n=341) or placebo (n=346) during the third trimester of pregnancy 
(see section 5.1). The safety profile of Infanrix hexa was similar regardless of exposure/non-exposure 
to dTpa during pregnancy.’ 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Issue resolved 
B.  Section 5.1. Pharmacodynamic properties 
The proposed wording is not considered appropriate and specific enough. Clinical data 
should be replace by immunological data. Immunological data did show immune 
interference. The characteristics of the population should be better described. All 
characteristics that are relevant to appropriately assess the accuracy of the information 
Assessment report  
EMA/496743/2020

need to be included (such as exact number of infants and toddlers included in the studies, 
range of gestational weeks when MI, infant’s vaccination schedule, etc). Immune responses 
specific to the 3 pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN) should be described in term of GMCs, 
both post-primary and post-booster vaccination. It should also be indicated that the fold 
increases of the anti-pertussis antigens Ab GMC from the prebooster to the 1-month after 
booster were in the same range for both dTpa and control groups. It should be specified 
that, because internationally agreed correlates of protection are lacking, the clinical 
significance of blunting is not yet fully understood; The clinical relevance of these observed 
interference are currently unknown but current limited epidemiological data on pertussis 
disease do not suggest any clinical concern of this immune interference on the short term. 
The MAH is required to propose a revised wording of this section. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Company acknowledges the assessor’s comment regarding the appropriateness and specificity of 
the wording in the PI. As requested, the following edits and precisions have been made: 
• 
• 
• 
The term “Clinical data” has been replaced by “Immunological data”; 
The range of gestational weeks for pregnant women at the time of vaccination as well as the 
infant’s 2-dose or 3-dose vaccination schedule and the exact number of infants (per 
vaccination schedule) and toddlers in both clinical trials have been included to provide 
characteristics of the population; 
The lower antibody concentrations (GMCs) observed post-primary vaccination for all 3 
pertussis antigens (PT, FHA and PRN) and post-booster vaccination for PT and FHA, 
respectively, have been described in the PI. The fact that the fold increases of the anti-
pertussis antibody GMCs from the pre-booster to the 1-month post-booster time point were in 
the same range for both the dTpa and control groups has also been detailed. Finally, the 
statements on the clinical relevance of the observed interference of maternal antibodies on 
the infant’s and toddler’s anti-pertussis antibody responses requested by the assessor have 
been added in the PI. 
Exact wording included in the PI: 
‘Immunogenicity in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa during pregnancy 
The immunogenicity of Infanrix hexa in infants and toddlers born to healthy mothers vaccinated with 
dTpa at 27-36 weeks of pregnancy was evaluated in two clinical studies. 
Infanrix hexa was co-administered with a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to infants at 2, 4 
and 6 months or 2, 3 and 4 months in three-dose primary vaccination schedules (n=241), or at 3 and 
5 months or 2 and 4 months in two-dose primary vaccination schedules (n=27); and to the same 
infants/toddlers from 11 to 18 months as booster dose (n=229). 
Post-primary and post-booster vaccination, immunological data did not show clinically relevant 
interference of maternal vaccination with dTpa on the infant’s and toddler’s responses to diphtheria, 
tetanus, hepatitis B, inactivated poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b or pneumococcal antigens. 
Lower antibody concentrations against pertussis antigens post-primary (PT, FHA and PRN) and 
postbooster (PT, FHA) vaccination were observed in infants and toddlers born to mothers vaccinated 
with dTpa during pregnancy. The fold-increases of anti-pertussis antibody concentrations from the 
prebooster to the 1-month post-booster time point were in the same range for infants and toddlers 
born to mothers vaccinated with dTpa or with placebo, demonstrating effective priming of the immune 
system. 
In the absence of correlates of protection for pertussis, the clinical relevance of these observations 
remains to be fully understood. However, current epidemiological data on pertussis disease following 
the implementation of dTpa maternal immunisation do not suggest any clinical relevance of this 
immune interference.’

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Symtuza is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) infection in adults and 
adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg) (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with HIV, of which about 
35 million people have died. Globally, 36.7 million [34.0–39.8 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 
2015. An estimated 0.8% [0.7-0.9%] of adults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with HIV, although the 
burden of the epidemic continues to vary considerably between countries and regions. Sub-Saharan Africa 
remains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (4.4%) living with HIV and accounting for 
nearly 70% of the people living with HIV worldwide (WHO Global Health Observatory [GHO] data). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
HIV-1 infection results in chronic activation of the immune system and a subsequent gradual loss of CD4+ T cells 
eventually leading to a state of acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS). One of the predictors for HIV-1 disease 
progression is the level of HIV-1 RNA in the blood (viral load). The aim of treatment of HIV-1 infection is 
therefore to suppress the HIV-1 viral load to levels that are at least below 50 copies/mL of blood. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Acute HIV-1 infection is often missed, as it usually presents with nonspecific signs and symptoms, or goes 
without clinical symptoms. Diagnosis therefore most often occurs during chronic infection. Diagnostic tests for 
HIV-1 infection include assays for HIV-1 RNA, p24 antigen, and HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended in all adults with chronic HIV infection, irrespective of CD4 counts. 
For ART-naïve HIV-infected patients, treatment guidelines recommend that initial therapy consists of 2 N[t]RTIs 
and either a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), a boosted PI, or an integrase strand-transfer 
inhibitor (INSTI).  
The main goal of ART is to suppress viral replication to below detectable limits, increase CD4+ cell counts, and 
stop disease progression and prevent transmission. It is a life-long treatment, as the viral load will rebound as 
soon as an individual stops taking effective antiretroviral therapy. 
The available treatment options for HIV-1 infected individuals have greatly improved in the last two decades. 
Current treatment options are generally considered to be potent, with an overall acceptable toxicity profile. 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 10/106 
  
  
Mutations in the viral genome can however occur when the virus replicates, which can make the virus resistant 
to antiretroviral drugs or classes of drugs. Therefore, there is a need for development of new antiretroviral 
treatment options. 
About the product 
The Applicant has developed the  FDC tablet Symtuza, for oral once-daily use for the treatment of HIV-1 
infection. It contains the PI DRV (800 mg), the PK enhancer COBI (150 mg), the NRTI FTC (200 mg), and the 
NtRTI TFV prodrug TAF (10 mg) as active substances. Two FDCs of the components (DRV/COBI and F/TAF) are 
already approved in the European Union, respectively, as REZOLSTA and Descovy, for combined administration. 
The D/C/F/TAF FDC is the first complete protease inhibitor (PI)-based HIV-1 regimen in a single tablet to be 
taken once daily. 
The co-formulation with TAF, a prodrug of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) tenofovir (TFV), 
instead of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), offers an improved renal and bone safety profile compared to 
TDF, with similar efficacy. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film coated tablets, containing 800 mg darunavir (as ethanolate), 150 mg 
cobicistat, 200 mg emtricitabine and 10 mg of tenofovir alafenamide (as fumarate) in a fixed dose combination.  
Other ingredients of the tablets core are cellulose microcrystalline, croscarmellose sodium, silica colloidal 
anhydrous and magnesium stearate. The film coating comprises poly(vinyl alcohol)– partially hydrolysed, 
macrogol 4000, titanium dioxide, talc and yellow ferric oxide. 
The product is available in white, high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle, fitted with polypropylene (PP) child 
resistant closure with induction seal and a desiccant pouch, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Darunavir (as ethanolate) 
General information 
The chemical name of darunavir ethanolate is [(1S,2R)-3-[[(4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl](2-methylpropyl)amino]-2 
-hydroxy-1-(phenylmethyl) propyl]-carbamic acid (3R,3aS,6aR)-hexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furan-3-yl ester 
monoethanolate, corresponding to the molecular formula C 27H37N3O7S.C2H6O and has a relative molecular 
mass 593.73 g/mol and has the following chemical structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 11/106 
  
  
Figure 1.  Structure of darunavir ethanolate 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of IR spectroscopy, 1H- and 13C-NMR 
spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and XRD. Darunavir ethanolate is 
sufficiently characterised and its structure is adequately elucidated. 
Darunavir ethanolate is a white to off-white, hygroscopic, crystalline powder, very slightly soluble in aqueous 
solutions. Its solubility increases with decreasing pH, but remains very slightly soluble in the pH region between 
1 and 12.  
It exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of five chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely 
through the chiral identity and purity of the starting materials. The absence of interconversion during the 
manufacturing process and storage has been demonstrated. Darunavir ethanolate is presented in the solid state 
as a pseudo-polymorph (ethanolate solvate). Other solvates are also possible, but are not relevant as ethanol is 
the solvent used during the final manufacturing step in the chemical synthesis. An extensive polymorphism 
study was performed. Darunavir ethanolate was isolated either as a solvate crystalline material or as 
non-solvated amorphous material. A non-solvated crystalline form was not obtained. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Darunavir ethanolate is synthesized in 4 main steps using commercially available well defined starting materials 
with acceptable specifications. The manufacturing process is the same as described in Rezolsta MAA.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are satisfactory. 
The active substance is packed in one or two low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags (primary packaging material) 
placed into a hot-sealed aluminum polyethylene laminated bag (secondary functional), which is placed into a 
suitable container (secondary packaging). All components used as primary packaging material are food grade 
and comply with the requirements of Ph. Eur. and European Directive 10/2011 as amended.  
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 12/106 
  
  
 
Specification 
Darunavir specification includes tests for identification (IR, UPLC), physical description (visual), assay (HPLC), 
chromatographic purity (HPLC), ethanol (GC), residual solvent (GC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), water 
content (KF), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.) and particle size (laser diffraction). Specifications, analytical procedures 
and validation data are in accordance with those currently authorised in Rezolsta. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis data of 9 commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data of darunavir from the proposed manufacturer(s) stored in the intended commercial package for 36 
months at 5 °C (3 commercial scale batches), at 25 ºC / 60% RH for up to 36 months (3 commercial scale 
batches), at 30 °C / 65% RH for up 36 months (3 commercial scale batches) and up to 60 months (7 commercial 
scale batches) and at 40 ºC / 75% RH for up 6 months (10 commercial scale batches) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The parameters tested were physical description, assay, chromatographic purity, 
ethanol and heavy metals and the methods were stability indicating.  All results meet the acceptance criteria 
after storage at 5 °C, 25 °C /60% RH and 30 °C /65% RH for a period of 36 months, at 30 °C /65% RH for a 
period of  60 months and 40 °C /75% RH for a period of 6 months. No trends were observed.  
Results from a photostability study as per ICH guideline conditions show a decrease in ethanol content along 
with an increase in water content. These changes are due to the fact that the drug substance was removed from 
the hot-sealed aluminum laminated bag to be exposed to the light. No change in impurity profile was observed 
upon exposure to light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
Cobicistat on silicon dioxide  
General information 
The chemical name of cobicistat is 1,3-Thiazol-5-ylmethyl 
[(2R,5R)-5-{[(2S)-2-[(methyl{[2-(propan-2-yl)-1,3-thiazol-4-yl]methyl}carbamoyl)amino]-4-(morpholin-4-y
l)butanoyl]amino}-1,6-diphenylhexan-2-yl]carbamate (refer to cobicistat molecule), corresponding to the 
molecular formula C40H53N7O5S2 and has a relative molecular mass 776.0 g/mol and has the following chemical 
structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 13/106 
  
  
Figure 2.  Structure of cobicistat 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of IR spectroscopy, 1H- and 13C-NMR 
spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and XRD. Solid state properties were confirmed using X-ray 
powder diffraction (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and dynamic vapor sorption (DVS). 
Comparison of the IR, UV, DSC and DVS data for cobicistat reference standard and a sample of cobicistat on 
silicon dioxide were also discussed. Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is sufficiently characterised and its structure is 
adequately elucidated. 
Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is defined as the active substance. It is isolated by adsorption of cobicistat onto 
silicon dioxide to provide a stable solid form, which facilitates handling and is suitable for further finished product 
processing. 
Cobicistat exists as a white to pale yellow amorphous solid. Cobicistat on silicon dioxide is a white to pale yellow, 
hygroscopic powder. Amorphous cobicistat is practically insoluble in water. The solubility of both the amorphous 
and the adsorbed on silicon dioxide increases significantly in acidic pH, soluble/sparingly soluble respectively in 
0.1N HCl.  
Cobicistat exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres. It is produced as a single isomer. 
The stereochemical configurations at these chiral centres are controlled through the synthetic process and use 
of starting materials having suitably high chiral purities. One crystalline form has been identified for cobicistat 
free base. Cobicistat active substance is amorphous. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Cobicistat is synthesized in multiple convergent steps using well-defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. The manufacturing process is the same as described in Rezolsta MAA.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
Critical steps have been defined and discussed and adequate in-process controls are applied during the 
synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents 
have been presented.  
The active substance is packed in in double polyethylene bags. The bags are held in high-density polyethylene 
drums with lids (or other suitable secondary containment) and fitted with a tamper-evident security seal. All 
components used as primary packaging material are food grade and comply with the requirements of Ph. Eur. 
and European Directive 10/2011 as amended.

Specification 
Cobicistat on silicon dioxide specification, re-produced in Table 2, includes tests for appearance (visual), 
identification of silicon dioxide (chemical reaction), identification of cobicistat (IR, HPLC, UV), water content 
(KF), assay (HPLC), impurity content (HPLC), chiral purity (HPLC), residual solvent (GC), heavy metals (ICP-MS) 
and crystallinity (PXRD). Specifications, analytical procedures and validation data are in accordance with those 
currently authorised in Rezolsta. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis data of 20 representative batches of the active substance are provided (the crystalline content 
was tested in 3 batches). The results are within the specification and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 3 commercial scale and 2 pilot scale batches of cobicistat from the proposed manufacturers 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 60 months at 5 °C, for up 48 months at 25ºC/60% RH and 
for up to 12 months at 30°C/75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The parameters tested 
were appearance, assay, impurity content, chiral impurities and water content. The absence of crystalline form 
is monitored on long-term stability for one commercial scale batch (ongoing). The analytical methods used were 
the same as for release and were stability indicating. All stability attributes were well within the specified 
acceptance criteria and showed no discernible trends through 48 and 60 month time points. 
A photostability study was conducted on one batch in accordance with ICH Q1B Guideline. Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products Stress test studies were also conducted following the ICH Q1A (R2) 
Guideline, Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The data indicate that cobicistat on silicon 
dioxide is not sensitive to light. 
Stress study has also been conducted at 30 °C/75% RH, to assess the stability of cobicistat on silicon dioxide at 
higher temperatures such as those that may occur during shipping and handling. Tested parameters remain 
within specification and the results support exposure to elevated temperatures up to 30 °C for a 3 month 
cumulative duration that may arise during shipping and handling. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period and storage conditions in the proposed container. 
Emtricitabine 
General information 
The chemical name of emtricitabine is 4-amino-5-fluoro-1-[(2R,5S)-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan -5-yl]- 
1,2-dihydropyrimidin-2-one , corresponding to the molecular formula C8H10FN3O3S and has a relative 
molecular mass 247.24 g/mol and has the following chemical structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 15/106 
  
  
Figure 3.  Structure of emtricitabine 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, IR 
spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal x-ray determination.  
Emtricitabine appears as a white to off-white non-hygroscopic crystalline powder, freely soluble in methanol and 
water. Its pKa is 2.65 and the partition coefficient Log P is -0.43.  
It has 2 chiral centres at carbons 2 and 5 of the oxathiolane ring. Two enantiomeric pairs of diastereomers can 
exist: cis-(-)- emtricitabine and cis-(+)- emtricitabine, trans-(-)- emtricitabine and trans-(+)- emtricitabine. 
The synthetic route has been chosen to be stereoselective for the formation of the desired cis-(-) enantiomer, 
emtricitabine.  
Three polymorphs of emtricitabine have been observed. However, the most stable thermodynamically form at 
room temperature, is consistently produced. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Emtricitabine is manufactured by two possible synthetic routes sharing a common first step and followed by two 
options comprising either one or two extra steps. The active substance information is essentially the same as in 
the approved product Descovy. The synthesis was described in sufficient detail.  
The synthetic process results in the stereoselective formation of an intermediate and thus the formation of the 
desired emtricitabine enantiomer. Five manufacturing sites are involved. Adequate in-process controls (IPCs) 
are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting 
materials and reagents have been presented. The process has been shown to consistently produce emtricitabine 
that meets the required quality standards. The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in 
accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were 
well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in double polyethylene (PE) bags inside HDPE drums; the PE bags comply with 
EC Regulation 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
Emtricitabine specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, HPLC), clarity of solution, water 
content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), impurity content (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), organic volatile 
impurities (GC), heavy metals (ICP-MS), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) and particle size (laser scattering). The 
active substance specification is essentially the same as in the approved product Descovy. 
The testing and the proposed limits applied, conform to current ICH guidelines and are acceptable from a 
toxicological and clinical perspective. Non compendial analytical methods have been validated in accordance 
with ICH guidelines. 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 16/106 
  
  
 
Extended testing during development has demonstrated that only a single polymorphic form results from the 
synthetic process of emtricitabine. Therefore, as per ICH Q6A, testing for polymorphic form at release is not 
necessary. Development data demonstrate the absence of indicator organisms and therefore, as per ICH Q6A, 
microbial testing of the active substance is not required. Satisfactory information regarding the reference 
standards used for assay testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis data on 22 commercial scale batches of the active substance from all proposed manufacturers 
were provided. The results comply with the specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of the 
manufacturing process. 
Stability 
Thirteen commercial scale and additional pilot scale batches of emtricitabine manufactured using both synthetic 
routes and packaged in the proposed container were put on stability testing in accordance with the ICH Q1A (R2) 
Guideline under long-term conditions (25ºC/60% RH) for up to 36 months. Of the above batches, eight 
commercial scale and five pilot batches were stored under accelerated conditions (40ºC/75% RH) for up to 6 
months. In addition, another three batches were stored under intermediate conditions (30ºC/65% RH) for up to 
12 months. Samples were tested for appearance, impurities, assay, water content and enantiomeric purity by 
validated stability indicating methods. Stability data for emtricitabine manufactured by both synthetic routes 
was comparable. The majority of tested parameters remained within the specification limits throughout the 
study period for all three stability conditions. In one isolated batch, one degradation product exceeded the 
specification limit at the last time point (36 months). The same degradation product is observed in emtricitabine 
stored under accelerated conditions. Four batches stored under accelerated conditions exceeded the 
specification limit at 6 months. These data indicate that emtricitabine should not be exposed to elevated 
temperatures for extended periods of time.  
A photostability study was conducted on one commercial batch of emtricitabine. The results showed no 
significant changes in appearance, purity, and impurity content and indicate that emtricitabine is not sensitive 
to light. 
Based on the long-term stability data, the proposed re-test period and storage conditions when the active 
substance is packed in the proposed packaging materials is considered acceptable. 
Tenofovir alafenamide fumarate 
General information 
The chemical name of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF fumarate) is propan-2-yl 
N-[(S)-({[(2R)-1-(6-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)propan-2-yl]-oxy}methyl)(phenoxy)phosphoryl]-L-alaninate, 
(2E)-but-2-enedioate (2:1) corresponding to the molecular formula C 23H31O7N6P and has a relative molecular 
mass 534.5 g/mol and has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 17/106 
  
  
Figure 4.  Structure of tenofovir alafenamide fumarate. 
The chemical structure of TAF fumarate has been adequately demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy, nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 13C, and 31P), mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, ultraviolet 
absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography.  
The active substance is a white to off-white or tan, slightly hygroscopic powder. TAF fumarate has pH-dependent 
aqueous solubility decreasing with increasing pH. It is soluble at low pH (pH 2.0), sparingly soluble at pH 3.8, 
and slightly soluble at pH values up to 8.0. TAF fumarate is freely soluble in methanol, soluble in ethanol, 
sparingly soluble in isopropanol and slightly soluble in acetone. 
Tenofovir alafenamide exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of three chiral centres. The chiral centre at 
the propyloxy- side chain is in the R-configuration. The absolute stereo-configuration of the 
carbonylethylamino-substituent has the S-configuration at the alpha-carbon. The remaining stereocentre is 
located at the phosphorus atom and is in the S-configuration. Enantiomeric purity is monitored routinely by 
chiral HPLC. 
Polymorphism has been observed for TAF fumarate. A single form is consistently generated through the 
manufacturing process and this form has been adequately characterised and is consistently produced by the 
manufacturing process. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
TAF fumarate is obtained from two manufacturers using the same synthetic route. It is synthesized in multiple 
steps using well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
Adequate IPCs are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate 
products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities is in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. Critical process parameters were identified using a risk assessment approach. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. The 
quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be comparable 
with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in double-lined PE bags which comply with the EC Regulation 10/2011 as 
amended. The bags are held in HDPE drums (or other suitable secondary container) with lids of appropriate size 
and fitted with a security seal.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual examination), identification (IR, HPLC), 
identity of fumaric acid (HPLC), clarity of solution (visual examination), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC, HPLC-MS, GC), L-alanine isopropyl ester content (HPLC), fumaric acid content  (HPLC), 
residual solvents (GC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), and melting point (Ph. Eur.). The active substance 
specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
Impurities present at levels higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standard used 
for assay testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis data of 13 production and 3 pilot scale batches of the active substance, manufactured at both 
proposed manufacturing sites using the proposed commercial process were provided. Additional batch analysis 
data for development batches used in pre-clinical pharmacokinetics and toxicological studies are provided. The 
results are within the specification and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 6 commercial scale batches of active substance from both proposed manufacturers stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (5 ºC) and for up to 24 months 
under accelerated conditions (25 ºC/60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Results under 
stressed conditions for up to 6 months at 40 ºC/75% RH on 5 batches were provided. Additionally, results for 4 
days at 60 ºC / ambient RH, for 4 days at 50 ºC/ambient RH and for 4 days at -20 ºC were also provided on one 
batch. 
Samples were tested for appearance, impurities, assay, water content, and solid state characteristics (XRD and 
melting point). The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters remained within specification under long term and accelerated conditions. Degradation 
products increased under accelerated conditions but also remained within the specification. 
Photostability testing following ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one commercial sale batch, indicating that 
the active substance is not photosensitive. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the both proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period and storage conditions in the proposed 
container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  an  immediate  release  fixed-dose  combination  film-coated  tablet  intended  for  oral 
administration. The finished product contains 867.0 mg of darunavir (DRV) ethanolate (equivalent to 800 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 19/106 
  
  
darunavir free form), 288.5 mg of cobicistat (COBI) on silicon dioxide (equivalent to 150.0 mg cobicistat free 
form), 200 mg of emtricitabine (FTC), and 11.2 mg of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) fumarate (equivalent to 10.0 
mg tenofovir alafenamide free form).  The tablets are yellow to yellowish brown capsule shaped measuring 22 
mm x 10 mm, debossed with “8121” on one side and “JG” on the other side. 
Fixed dose combinations of the components (DRV/COBI and FTC/TAF) are already approved, respectively as 
Rezolsta and Descovy, and can be used in combination. 
The  main  objective  of  the  pharmaceutical  development  was  to  develop  a  single  tablet,  containing  all  active 
substances, taking into account their different physical and chemical properties and stability, while keeping the 
tablet mass to a minimum.  
The formulation development was based on prior experience with DRV tablets, the addition of the other active 
substances, and the need to minimize tablet weight.  
Darunavir (DRV) is very slightly soluble at all pH and presents pseudo-polymorphism. It is isolated as ethanol 
solvate, however, it converts into hydrate at ambient conditions.  The presence of darunavir hydrate in the 
finished product has no impact on clinical bioavailability because ethanolate and hydrate forms of DRV have the 
same comparative bioavailability as shown by a comparative bioavailability study (Study TMC114-C148). The 
specifications for DRV particle size distribution have been previously established during the development of the 
original darunavir 300 mg tablet submission. 
Cobicistat (COBI) is an amorphous solid with low glass transition temperature. For manufacturability and 
stability reasons, cobicistat is adsorbed on silicon dioxide. Cobicistat (non-adsorbed) is an amorphous solid 
which is dissolved in a solvent and loaded on silicon dioxide, thus the particle size of COBI is not relevant. 
Cobicistat on silicon dioxide has a pH dependent solubility (solubility increases as pH decreases). There is a 
pXRD test and acceptance criterion for the cobicistat drug substance as a control for solid state properties. 
Emtricitabine (FTC) is a crystalline solid and form I is the thermodynamically stable form. FTC is soluble and 
solubility increases as pH decreases.  The acceptance criteria for the FTC particle size distribution are approved 
for several emtricitabine-containing products. Due to the high solubility of emtricitabine across the physiological 
pH range, emtricitabine particle size is not expected to impact bioavailability. 
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is a prodrug of tenofovir. The form I (hemifumarate, referred as fumarate) is 
thermodynamically stable. TAF is soluble in water; solubility depends on pH (increases as pH decreases). The 
acceptance criterion for the TAF particle size is approved for other tenofovir alafenamide-containing products. 
Due to the solubility of tenofovir alafenamide across the physiological pH range, tenofovir alafenamide particle 
size is not expected to impact bioavailability. TAF is susceptible to hydrolysis therefore appropriate measures are 
employed to address TAF stability. The potential moisture contribution from the individual components of 
formulation was evaluated and as a result water content of COBI active substance and microcrystalline cellulose 
are considered critical material attributes. In addition water content of tablets is controlled at release and 
desiccant is added in the primary container. 
The formulations used in phase I, II and III studies and their differences were presented in sufficient detail. The 
final formula has been used since phase II clinical studies and it has been demonstrated bio-equivalent to 
currently approved products containing the same active substances (see clinical part). The excipients used in 
Symtuza are well-known, common excipients including microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, 
magnesium stearate, and film coating material. The quality of these excipients is compendial, except for film 
coating material for which internal specifications are applied.

The product is indicated for use in children from 12 years and older. The large tablet size may give rise to 
acceptability issues especially for children. It is noted that the rather large size of the Symtuza tablets (22 mm 
x 10 mm) is comparable to other antiretroviral products used in the same patient population. The company has 
acknowledged that the large tablet size may result in swallowing difficulties. Therefore, the possibility to crush 
or split the tablets has been further investigated in an ongoing relative bioavailability study. The results 
indicated that splitting does not result in differences versus intact tablets that are clinically relevant. However, 
the study is not considered sufficient to justify tablet splitting as it does not neither cover the variety in methods 
of tablet subdivision (hand, splitter, tool) nor the operator characteristics and does also not provide any data on 
loss of mass. Besides, there is no real evidence that patients who have difficulties swallowing the intact FDC 
tablet would be able to swallow the tablet following breaking and would also prefer this approach over the intake 
of the single component tablets. The acceptability of the intact tablets has been tested in another in vivo study. 
The swallowability of the intact FDC was found acceptable in the subjects who were enrolled in the later study 
but all subjects were treatment-experienced subjects. In view of the aforementioned, the CHMP recommended 
that a breakmark (scoreline) should be introduced, unless otherwise justified, to allow patients to easily break 
the tablet by hand without any relevant loss of mass prior to administration. In addition, the applicant is asked 
to investigate that the intake of a broken tablet eases swallowing in patients who cannot swallow the tablet 
intact. If not, alternative measures should be proposed.  
For a fixed dose combination tablet, a single dissolution method would be preferred. However, in the case of 
Symtuza, the four active substances have different solubility profiles and a wide dosage strength range, making 
difficult to have a single dissolution method with adequate discriminatory power. DRV is practically insoluble in 
the physiological pH range and it is present at a high dose; sink conditions could not be reached without a 
surfactant in the medium. The starting point for method development was prior knowledge with the dissolution 
method for the approved combination Rezolsta. It was demonstrated that the method used for DRV is not 
suitable for the other active substances, while the method used for COBI is not suitable for DRV. The method 
used for DRV is the same as the one used for Rezolsta. The method used for COBI, FTC, and TAF is the same as 
the one used for COBI single agent. 
DRV is practically insoluble in the physiological pH range therefore surfactant is used to achieve sink conditions. 
The selection of the dissolution method has been satisfactorily been justified.     
COBI, FTC, and TAF have solubility depending on pH. A common dissolution method is used for the three 
substances. The selection of the dissolution method has been satisfactorily justified.  
The discriminatory power of both methods has been discussed. The lack of the discriminative nature of the 
dissolution methods for some aspects (i.e. particle size, hardness, granulation parameters and composition) is 
considered acceptable, as those aspects are controlled at different stages.     
The four drug substances combined contribute a significant amount (88%) of the total tablet weight. Given the 
relatively poor flowability and compressibility of the individual drug substance powders, a dry granulation 
process is used to produce granules that contain the four active substances to provide a final blend for tablet 
compression that has suitable flow and compressibility characteristics. 
An overview of the manufacturing process equipment at the different scales has been presented. In vitro studies 
demonstrated that the process scale-up had no impact on the performance of the finished product. 
A systematic Quality by Design (QbD) approach was applied, based on prior knowledge and development 
studies a risk (criticality) assessment was conducted on the potential impact of each stage of the manufacturing 
process on the finished product CQAs. These were defined to be product appearance, identification, assay, 
uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, purity/degradants, water content and microbiological purity. The risk 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017

assessment has been described in sufficient detail in the dossier. The corresponding rationales have been given 
and the control strategy has been described. Design of experiments (DOE) studies have been performed for 
each step of the manufacturing process and all process parameters were designated as either critical process 
parameters (CPP) or non-CPP. Based on the results of the DOE studies (most studies were multivariate studies) 
PARs and/or target settings have been established for each of the process parameters (CPP as well as non-CPP) 
by demonstrating that operating within the tested ranges had no critical impact on the drug product CQAs. A 
design space is claimed for the roller compaction/milling, compression and film coating steps. The boundaries of 
the design space in terms of CPPs ranges have been explicitly laid down. The development studies have 
demonstrated the robustness of the manufacturing process and based on the results of the manufacturing 
process development studies, the finalized target settings and PARs for the manufacturing process are in 
general considered justified. 
The container closure system of Symtuza film-coated tablets is a white, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), 
120-mL bottle with child resistant (CR) polypropylene (PP) closure, with induction seal liner, containing a 3 g 
silica gel desiccant pouch. The materials comply with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. The 
necessary ISO certificate has been submitted with regard to the child resistant feature. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process comprises 8 main steps: initial blending without lubricant, initial blending with 
lubricant, roller compaction/milling, final blending, compression, preparation of the film-coating suspension, 
film-coating, packaging. 
Design spaces have been proposed for the following steps of the manufacturing process of the medicinal 
product: roller compaction/milling, compression and film coating steps. The design spaces have been developed 
at commercial scale. 
Holding times have been defined and justified. 
The process is considered a non-standard process as tenofovir alafenamide covers approx. 0.72% of the total 
tablet core weight which is considered critical with regards to homogeneity according to “Annex II to note for 
guidance on process validation for finished products EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1”. Process 
validation data on three full production batches have been submitted according to an acceptable validation 
protocol. Based on the provided process validation data it is concluded that the proposed manufacturing process 
is satisfactorily validated and suitable for commercial manufacturing. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications includes appropriate tests and limits for this kind of 
dosage form: appearance (visual), identification of the four active substances (UHPLC, UV), water content (Ph. 
Eur.), assay of the four active substances (HPLC), chromatographic purity of the four active substances 
(UHPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), dissolution, and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification is acceptable based on batch analysis results, stability results and in accordance with relevant 
European guidelines. Impurity levels are based on the active substance limits, development study results and 
toxicological studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 22/106 
  
  
The in-house analytical methods have in general been adequately described and validated. Sufficient 
information has been presented for the reference standards used. 
A single dissolution test method was suitable during development, but a more discriminatory test method was 
required and the commercial test methods were developed for commercial batches. Comparison of the 
dissolution methods and the dissolution profiles generated using the development test method and the proposed 
commercial test methods were provided in the dossier.  
A cross-over study was performed for the initial version of the assay/chromatographic purity test method used 
for batch release and for the updated method used as from the 12-month time point for the primary stability 
studies. The equivalence of the initial and updated versions of the test method was demonstrated. 
Batch analytical data from two commercial scale batches and 9 other smaller scale batches have been 
presented. The data demonstrates compliance with the proposed release specification.. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches stored under long term conditions 25 °C/60% RH and 30 °C/75% RH 
for up to 21 months and under accelerated conditions 40 °C/75% RH for 6 months has been provided, according 
to the ICH Stability Guidelines; the use of the harsher 30 °C/75% RH condition for intermediate testing is 
acceptable. Samples were tested for appearance, water content, assay, chromatographic purity, dissolution and 
microbial purity. The stability test methods are the same as the release test methods with one exception: an 
updated version of the assay/chromatographic purity test method was implemented at the 12-month time point.  
A cross-over study was performed and the equivalence of the initial and updated versions of the test method has 
been demonstrated. No meaningful change is observed in any attribute studied at long-term and accelerated 
storage condition. All data reported comply with the proposed specifications and there are no trends observed. 
A photostability study was conducted on one commercial scale batch the product, as per the ICH Q1B guideline. 
Despite a slight increase in some degradation products the change is considered not significant difference 
between protected and not protected samples. The finished product is therefore considered not sensitive to 
light. 
Results of an in-use stability study on a commercial scale batch demonstrate that the finished product is stable 
up to 6 weeks at both 25 ºC and 30 ºC after opening of the container thus justifying the proposed in-use stability 
(SmPC section 6.3). 
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 24 months in the original package with desiccant 
inside the bottle in order to protect the tablets from moisture as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) is 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
There are no materials of human or animal origin used in the manufacture of the finished product. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the four active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The product development was based on prior knowledge with other 
already authorised products containing the same active substances. The results of tests carried out indicate 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 23/106 
  
  
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion 
that from a quality perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and/or finished product and 
their manufacturing process. Design spaces have been proposed for several steps in the manufacture of the 
finished product. The design spaces have been adequately verified. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
-To introduce a breakmark on the tablet to allow patients to easily break the tablet by hand without any 
relevant loss of mass prior to administration. The company should investigate if tablet breaking will ease 
swallowing in patients who are unable to swallow the tablet intact. Otherwise, an alternative administration 
strategy should be proposed.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Symtuza is a fixed dose combination containing 800 mg of darunavir (as ethanolate), 150 mg of cobicistat, 200 
mg of emtricitabine, and 10 mg of tenofovir alafenamide (as fumarate). All active substances are known 
medicinal products. The combination darunavir / cobicistat was authorised as Rezolsta while emtricitabine / 
tenofovir alafenamide as Descovy. Symtuza (D/C/F/TAF FDC) is indicated as a complete regimen for the 
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years 
and older with body weight at least 40 kg). The recommended dose is one tablet once daily. 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted. The nonclinical development program of the D/C/F/TAF FDC is 
entirely based on the individual development programs of the four components. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Darunavir 
Darunavir is a protease inhibitor. The inhibitory constant (Ki) for darunavir was <0.09 nM, which is comparable 
to lopinavir and lower than for other protease inhibitors. Darunavir binds tightly to HIV-1 protease to form highly 
stable complex with both wild type (Kd 4.5 x 10-12 M) and mutant proteases.

In vitro antiviral activity was investigated in T-cell lines (MT4 and MT2 cells) infected with HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV 
and in HIV-1 infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and human monocytes/macrophages. 
In T-cell lines, EC50 of darunavir was 2.29 – 6.26 nM against HIV-1, 4.70 – 8.49 nM against HIV-2 and 9.28 nM 
against SIV. The EC50 values in HIV-1 infected human PBMCs and monocytes/macrophages were comparable to 
those observed in the T-cell lines. EC50 of darunavir increased by a median factor of 5.4 in the presence of 50% 
human serum. 
The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) was found to be greater than 100 μM. With a median EC50 of 3.8 nM 
using the MTT assay in MT4 cells, a selectivity index (SI=CC50/EC50) >26000 was determined. 
In vitro selection experiments with wild type HIV-1 isolates in the presence of increasing concentrations of 
darunavir revealed mutations at codons 37, 41, 55, 70, 71, 74, 77 and 85. From 7 in vitro selection experiments 
starting with wild type HIV-1 strains, 3 resulted in emerging viruses with a fold change > 4. Selection 
experiments with protease inhibitor-resistant HIV-1 revealed 22 mutations, of which 11 not yet reported to be 
associated with resistance to proteases (L11I, I15V, G16E, L23I, S37N, L63P, V82I, T91A, T91S, Q92R, and 
L76V). A minimum of eight of the darunavir in vitro selection mutations were required in the HIV-1 protease to 
render a virus resistant to darunavir (fold change >10), from which at least 2 were already present in the 
baseline virus. Eighteen of 20 protease inhibitor-resistant recombinant viruses were susceptible to darunavir 
(fold change ≤  4). Among 3309 recombinant HIV-1 isolates with decreased susceptibility to at least one 
protease inhibitor, EC50 values were ≤ 10 nM for 78% of the isolates and > 100 nM for 3% of the isolates. Eighty 
percent of the isolates exhibited a darunavir fold change of ≤  4 and 10% of >10. 
Cobicistat 
Cobicistat is a structurally modified analogue of the protease inhibitor ritonavir, which is devoid of anti-retroviral 
activity. Cobicistat has been shown to inhibit the activity of human CYP3A enzymes (IC50 values 0.03 to 0.15 
µM). Cobicistat or its metabolites M21, M26 and M31 did not have an inhibitory effect on HIV-1 protease at 
concentrations up to 30 µM. No antiviral activity was observed of cobicistat against two HIV-2 isolates.  
CC50 of cobicistat in MT2 lymphoblastoid T-cells and in HepG2 hepatoma cells was 89 µM and 44 µM 
respectively.  
Emtricitabine 
Emtricitabine is a synthetic analogue of the naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside, 2′-deoxycytidine. 
Intracellularly, emtricitabine is converted through 3 phosphorylation reactions to its active tri-phosphorylated 
anabolite emtricitabine triphosphate. 
Emtricitabine triphosphate inhibits viral polymerases by direct binding competition with the natural 
deoxyribonucleotide substrate (deoxycytidine triphosphate), and after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain 
termination. EC50 of emtricitabine against laboratory adapted strains of HIV-1 ranged from 0.001 to 0.62 μM 
depending on cell type and virus strain used in the assay. With clinical isolates of HIV-1, EC50 values ranged 
from 0.002 to 0.028 μM. 
In vivo animal studies have been completed with emtricitabine or emtricitabine in combination to demonstrate 
its activity against immune deficiency in the macaque monkey. Macaques were infected with the simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and 50 days post-inoculation animals were treated subcutaneously with either 
tenofovir (20 mg/kg) and emtricitabine (50 mg/kg) or were not given any drugs. The treated macaques 
achieved SIV levels that were below the limit of detection (ie, < 100 copies/mL of viral RNA), whereas only 1 of 
the non-treated macaques showed a decrease in SIV RNA. SIV levels remained low in all treated animals for up 
to 6 months.

In another study, monkeys were exposed to 14 weekly doses of SHIV (SIV/HIV chimeric virus). Rhesus 
macaques were injected subcutaneously with tenofovir/emtricitabine daily, at 2 hours before and 24 hours after 
the first virus exposure or at 2 hours before first virus exposure only. Twenty of the 21 control animals became 
infected, however all 6 of animals treated with tenofovir/emtricitabine daily or before and 24 hours after the first 
challenge were fully protected after 14 challenges. In the single-dose group, 1 of 6 animals was infected, 
confirming that multiple dose therapy was highly effective at protecting these animals against rectal 
transmission of HIV. 
Tenofovir alafenamide 
Tenofovir alafenamide is hydrolysed to tenofovir by the lysosomal carboxypeptidase, cathepsin A and is then 
metabolised to the active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate, which is an inhibitor of HIV-1, HIV-2 and HBV 
polymerases, and is an inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase that competes with deoxyadenosine 
triphosphate (dATP) for incorporation into nascent DNA and terminates the elongation of the viral DNA chain 
during the process of retroviral reverse transcription, thereby effectively blocking the replication and spread of 
infectious HIV. 
In vitro studies have shown that tenofovir alafenamide has anti-HIV activity in lymphoid T-cells, primary human 
PBMCs, and macrophages with EC50 values ranging from 3 to 14 nM. The in vitro activity of tenofovir 
alafenamide against HIV-1 is 100- to 600-fold greater than tenofovir and 4- to 6-fold greater than tenofovir 
diphosphate. 
In MT-2 cells, tenofovir alafenamide shows low cytotoxicity with a selectivity index (SI) of > 10,000). Based on 
data generated with the parent nucleotide tenofovir, tenofovir alafenamide is expected to be active against a 
wide range of HIV-1 subtypes and also against HIV-2. In addition, tenofovir alafenamide is a potent inhibitor of 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, exhibiting in vitro activity comparable to that of tenofovir diphosphate with 
an EC50 value of 18 nM. 
No in vivo work with tenofovir alafenamide was conducted however this has been completed with the active 
component of tenofovir alafenamide , tenofovir. Monkeys received a single dose of 30 mg/kg radiolabelled 
tenofovir subcutaneously, and the extent of tenofovir in plasma and levels of intracellular tenofovir and tenofovir 
metabolite concentrations were determined. The tenofovir concentration in plasma reached a maximum of 
approximately 50 μM and declined with a t1/2 of 5 to 7 hours. As was seen in the in vitro studies, tenofovir is 
efficiently taken up by PBMCs and is metabolised to tenofovir diphosphate, with the intracellular concentrations 
of the active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate reaching 0.9 μM. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Darunavir 
Darunavir did not significantly inhibit human angiotensin converting enzyme, caspase 3, caspase 7, cathepsin C, 
cathepsin D, cathepsin E, factor VIIa, factor Xa, matrix metalloproteinase-2, matrix metalloproteinase-9, 
metalloproteinase neutral endopeptidase, thrombin, and renin. 
Cobicistat 
Cobicistat showed significant binding to the benzothiazepine sensitive L-type calcium channel, hERG potassium 
channel and sodium channel, at a concentration of 10 μM, which is 105-fold higher than the proposed clinical 
Cmax (free). 
Emtricitabine 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 26/106 
  
  
For emtricitabine, no cytotoxicity was observed in vitro in human PBMC, MT-2, HepG2, CEM, MOLT-4, and Vero 
cells at concentrations up to 100 μM. Emtricitabine was also found to be nontoxic to human bone marrow 
progenitor cells in vitro. 
The potential for mitochondrial toxicity with emtricitabine was evaluated. Emtricitabine was incubated with 
HepG2 cells at concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 10 μM for 2 weeks, and MT-2 cells were incubated with 
emtricitabine at concentrations up to 100 μM for up to 8 weeks. Emtricitabine had no adverse effects on cell 
growth, mitochondrial DNA synthesis, or lactic acid production. Further studies confirmed this finding. 
The inhibition of mitochondrial DNA synthesis was also assessed in an in vitro cell culture assay using Molt-4 
cells (a T-lymphoblast cell line). Emtricitabine did not reduce the ratio of mitochondrial to cellular DNA when 
tested at concentrations of up to 100 μM after 7 days of continuous cell exposure. 
Emtricitabine had no significant binding affinity at 19 different receptors, has shown little or no direct effect on 
various isolated muscle preparations (cholinergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, and serotonergic), and had no 
major inhibitory effects on the contractile responses to acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, isoproterenol, 
arachidonic acid, histamine, bradykinin, and angiotensin II. 
Tenofovir alafenamide 
CC50 values for tenofovir alafenamide ranged from 6.8 μM in dividing PBMCs to 25.1 μM in resting PBMCs. 
Tenofovir alafenamide showed low cytotoxicity in resting and in dividing PBMCs. Tenofovir alafenamide showed 
low cytotoxicity in T-lymphoblastoid cells providing ≥  1997-fold increased selectivity relative to antiviral activity 
in T-lymphoblastoid cell lines. Similarly tenofovir alafenamide demonstrated low cytotoxicity to hepatic cells. 
Tenofovir alafenamide also showed little to no effect on erythroid and myeloid progenitor proliferation in vitro. 
The cytotoxicity of tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir was assessed in human HEK293T cells transiently 
expressing OAT1 and OAT3. Cells were incubated with serial dilutions of tenofovir or tenofovir alafenamide for 
4 days. Tenofovir alafenamide did not interact with the renal organic anion transporters 1 or 3 (OAT1 or OAT3), 
and tenofovir alafenamide exhibited no OAT-dependent cytotoxicity in human epithelial kidney cells transiently 
expressing these transporters. In addition, the selectivity index (considering CC50 in renal HEK293 cells 
expressing OAT1 or OAT3 relative to EC50 in primary CD4+ T lymphocytes) for tenofovir alafenamide (29,000 
and 4270, respectively) was much higher than for tenofovir (14 and 82, respectively). As a result tenofovir 
alafenamide is unlikely to accumulate in renal proximal tubules in an OAT-dependent manner, supporting the 
hypothesis that it has the potential for an improved renal safety profile. 
The potential for tenofovir alafenamide to induce mitochondrial DNA depletion was evaluated in HepG2 cells. 
HepG2 cells treated with tenofovir alafenamide (0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 μM) for 10 days exhibited no significant 
reduction in mitochondrial DNA compared with untreated cells. No effect of tenofovir was seen on the synthesis 
of mitochondrial DNA or lactic acid production in HepG2 human liver cells or in normal human skeletal muscle 
cells. The results confirm the low potential for tenofovir to interfere with mitochondrial functions. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Darunavir 
In vitro, hERG current was not inhibited (up to 10 μM, which is similar to 10-fold the human free maximum 
plasma level) and the cardiac action potential (sheep isolated cardiac Purkinje fibres) remained unaffected after 
10 μM darunavir. In conscious telemetered beagle dogs, darunavir did not affect cardio-haemodynamic and ECG 
parameters at Cmax slightly higher and AUC values slightly lower than clinical exposure. At oral dose up to 2000 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 27/106 
  
  
mg/kg in rats, darunavir did not show any effect on gastrointestinal transit time, neurobehavioral and motor 
activity, or respiration. Cmax was comparable to human exposure and AUC values were lower. 
Cobicistat 
No effects were observed on the central nervous system in the rat at Cmax approximately 4.2-fold higher than 
that observed clinically. At higher doses (≥ 150 mg/kg), salivation along with decreased arousal, locomotor 
activity, motor activity and a decrease in body temperature were noted. No effects were observed on the 
respiratory system in the rat at doses up to 500 mg/kg. 
Cobicistat inhibited the hERG potassium current and the hCav1.2 L-type calcium channel, but was a weak 
inhibitor of the hNav1.5 sodium channel (with IC50 values of 1.8-1.9 μM, 6 μM and 86.5 μM, respectively). In 
the rabbit Purkinje fibre assay, cobicistat caused a significant shortening of action potential duration at ≥ 1 µM 
(0.78 µg/mL, approximately 10-fold the clinical unbound exposure). In isolated rabbit heart, shortening of the 
monophasic action potential duration was also observed as well as an increase in coronary perfusion pressure 
and a decrease in ventricular function at concentrations ≥ 1-1.5 µM and decrease in the QT interval and increase 
in the PR and RR interval at ≥ 3 µM. In vivo, no significant effect on QT interval was observed in the dog, 
following single oral doses of up to 45 mg/kg. Increases in PR interval were noted at ≥ 15 mg/kg where the 
plasma levels were reported to be 3.2 to 4.9 fold higher than that observed clinically. 
Emtricitabine 
In vitro the effects of emtricitabine on cardiac preparations was evaluated using isolated cardiac muscle from 
rat, guinea pigs and cats. Results from these in vitro studies suggested that emtricitabine was free of negative 
cardiac effects at 1 μM. No effects on the cardiovascular system were reported in anesthetised dogs 
administered a cumulative dose of 38.5 mg/kg of emtricitabine intravenously over a 1-hour period. Rats given 
oral doses of up to 250 mg/kg emtricitabine showed no effect on heart rate or blood pressure. In addition, there 
were no abnormalities reported on the ECG data obtained from the repeated-dose toxicity studies in monkeys, 
where AUC exposures were up to 26-fold higher than in humans at 200 mg. 
A range of central nervous system effects were examined in a single study conducted with male ICR mice. Mice 
(10/dose) were given emtricitabine orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg as a single dose. 
Emtricitabine did not affect reflex, spontaneous locomotion, motor coordination, anticonvulsant activity, 
proconvulsant activity or analgesic activity at any dose tested. A further two studies in rats examined the effects 
of emtricitabine on reflexes, analgesic activity and conditioned avoidance. Emtricitabine had no effect on these 
parameters. 
Effects of emtricitabine on the respiratory system have been examined in mice, rats and dogs. In mice and rats, 
animals were exposed to up to 1000 mg/kg of oral emtricitabine with no effect on respiratory rate at any dose. 
Male beagle dogs were intravenously administered emtricitabine at 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg (cumulative 
dose = 38.5 mg/kg) over an hour. No changes were observed on respiratory function at any dose. 
Male ICR mice (10/dose) were given emtricitabine orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg, then given 
a charcoal suspension orally at 1 hour post-dose. Emtricitabine did not affect GI motility at any dose. 
Male Long Evans-derived rats were given emtricitabine orally at 0 (distilled water), 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg and 
urine was collected for 6 hours post-dose. Emtricitabine did not affect urine output, pH, or electrolyte excretion 
at any dose. 
Tenofovir alafenamide 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 28/106 
  
  
Tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated at concentrations of 1 and 10 μM, and hERG inhibition was not significant. 
The IC50 for the inhibitory effect of tenofovir alafenamide on hERG was estimated to be greater than 10 μM. Oral 
administration of tenofovir alafenamide to conscious instrumented male beagle dogs at doses of 30 or 100 
mg/kg (24 and 80 mg/kg free base equivalents) did not induce pharmacologic effects on heart rate, systemic 
blood pressure, or ECGs. However, in the 39-week repeated dose toxicity study in beagle dogs, a dose-related 
prolongation of the PR interval was observed at 6 and 18/12 mg/kg/day.  
The effect of tenofovir alafenamide on the central nervous system has been examined in male SD rats. Animals 
were treated with single oral doses of tenofovir alafenamide (as the monofumarate form) with doses of 0, 100 
or 1000 mg/kg (80 or 800 mg free base equivalents/kg). There was no evidence of any effect on the CNS at any 
dose tested up to 1000 mg/kg. 
SD rats were administered tenofovir alafenamide by oral gavage at doses of 0, 100 or 1000 mg/kg (0, 80 or 800 
mg free base equivalents/kg). At the highest dose the rate of gastric emptying was reduced, although this was 
not observed at 100 mg/kg. A dose of 100 mg/kg was considered to have had no effect on gastric emptying or 
intestinal motility.. 
The effect of tenofovir alafenamide on the renal system was evaluated in male SD rats following administration 
of single oral doses of 0, 100, or 1000 mg/kg (80 or 800 mg free base equivalents /kg). Urinary output of 
calcium was increased at 1000 mg/kg, however this was correlated with an increase in serum calcium 
concentration and indicated that the kidneys were functioning well in order to reduce the serum calcium load. 
The no-effect dose for a pharmacological effect on the renal system was 1000 mg/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Combinations of darunavir with current antiretrovirals were additive or modestly synergistic in an in vitro 
anti-HIV-1/IIIB MT4 cell-based assay. No significant changes were observed in the activity of selected 
antiretrovirals in the presence of cobicistat. PR interval prolongation by cobicistat in rabbit isolated heart 
appeared more pronounced in combination with atazanavir, but the differences were not considered clinically 
significant. Cathepsin A-mediated hydrolysis of tenofovir alafenamide was not inhibited by HIV protease 
inhibitors and several hepatitis C protease inhibitors. Telaprevir and boceprevir were identified as potent 
inhibitors of cathepsin A-mediated hydrolysis of tenofovir alafenamide. 
Non-clinically, potential for PR interval prolongation has been reported for cobicistat and tenofovir alafenamide. 
The combination cobicistat / tenofovir alafenamide has already been approved for Genvoya, where it was 
concluded that no additional investigation of the combination was necessary, since clinically, no cardiovascular 
signals were observed from cobicistat or tenofovir alafenamide. Therefore, no additional studies are necessary. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Darunavir absorption was rapid following oral administration in all species. The absolute oral bioavailability was 
37% to 58% in adult rats and 60 to 122% in dogs. After repeated administration, a decrease in systemic 
exposure was observed in rats, mainly due to induction of CYP3A iso-enzymes, but not in dogs. 
After oral dosing, bioavailability of cobicistat was low or low/moderate (33%, 11% and 7% in rat, dog and 
monkey resp.), likely due to high first-pass elimination. Auto-induction was observed in rats and mice, but not 
in dogs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 29/106 
  
  
Emtricitabine was rapidly and well absorbed with oral bioavailability ranging from 58% to 97% in mice, rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys. There were no significant differences in pharmacokinetics following single and multiple 
dosing. 
Tenofovir alafenamide was rapidly absorbed and rapidly converted into tenofovir in all investigated species 
(mice, rats, dogs and monkeys). PBMC concentrations were approximately 100-fold higher than corresponding 
plasma concentrations in dogs. Following repeated administration there was evidence of slight accumulation of 
tenofovir in rats and dogs, but not in monkeys. 
Distribution 
Plasma protein binding of darunavir was 63% in rabbits, 95% in rats and 75 – 94% in humans, with lower 
protein binding at higher concentrations. The tissue distribution in rats was extensive and rapid with the highest 
concentrations of radioactivity in liver and adrenal gland. No accumulation was observed except in the 
pigmented parts of the eye from which radioactivity decreased gradually. Darunavir crossed the placenta in 
pregnant rats. Darunavir exposure was much higher in juvenile rats (aged 12 or 26 days) than in adult rats. 
Protein binding of cobicistat was moderately high (93 – 95% in non-clinical species and 94% in humans). After 
oral administration to rats, radioactivity was rapidly and widely distributed to most tissues. The tissues showing 
the highest concentrations of radioactivity, excluding the gastro intestinal tract, included liver, adrenal, kidney, 
and pituitary. In rats, cobicistat was reversibly associated with melanin. 
The protein binding of emtricitabine was very low (< 5%) in mouse, rabbit, monkey, and human plasma. The 
tissue distribution in rats and monkeys was extensive and rapid. There was no sign of emtricitabine 
accumulation and elimination was rapid, no radioactivity was observed after 72 hours post-dose. 
Protein binding of tenofovir alafenamide was 48% and 47% in vitro in dog and human plasma respectively. Ex 
vivo protein binding in humans was 14 – 23%. Protein binding of tenofovir was very low (<1% in human 
plasma). The highest concentrations were found in kidneys and liver in mice and rats, and in mice also in gall 
bladder, urinary bladder and diaphragm. Tenofovir passed the placenta in pregnant monkeys. 
Metabolism 
The metabolism of darunavir following single oral administration was extensive and qualitatively similar in all 
species, including humans. No unique human metabolites were identified. In human liver, CYP3A was almost 
exclusively involved in the metabolism of darunavir. Darunavir inhibited CYP3A in human liver microsomes. In 
mice and rats, darunavir treatment induced hepatic microsomal CYP3A4. UDP-GT activity was additionally 
induced in rats. In dogs, no induction effects were observed. 
Cobicistat is a potent inhibitor of human CYP3A with inactivation kinetics similar to those of ritonavir. Inhibition 
of CYP3A is relatively specific as cobicistat did not inhibit human CYP1A2, CYP2C9, or CYP2C19, is a very weak 
to weak inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2D6 and of human hepatic microsomal UGT1A1 activity and a modest inhibitor 
of CYP2B6. 
Emtricitabine is not extensively metabolised and is eliminated primarily as unchanged drug by renal excretion in 
mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. Emtricitabine is subject to Phase I metabolism (oxidation to a 
diastereomeric sulfoxide) and to some direct conjugation (glucuronidation of hydroxymethyl group) as minor 
metabolic routes. 
Tenofovir alafenamide is subject to intracellular metabolism to tenofovir, which is further phosphorylated to 
tenofovir-monophosphate and tenofovir-diphosphate with tenofovir-diphosphate being the pharmacologically 
active form. Tenofovir alafenamide was not metabolised by CYP enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 30/106 
  
  
or CYP 2D6 and only slowly metabolised by CYP3A4. Intracellular metabolic activation of tenofovir alafenamide 
in PBMCs or other lymphatic tissues involves conversion to tenofovir by cathepsin A. In contrast to PBMCs, 
tenofovir alafenamide was primarily hydrolysed by carboxylesterase 1 in primary hepatocytes. 
Excretion 
Darunavir was excreted primarily via the feces with fecal excretion of 82 – 94% in rats, dogs and humans and 
urinary excretion of 4% in rats and dogs and 12% in humans. Darunavir was excreted in milk of rats. 
Cobicistat was excreted primarily in feces in mice, rats and dogs. In bile duct-cannulated rats and dogs 
respectively 69% and 64% of dosed radioactivity was found in bile. Cobicistat was excreted in milk of rats. 
Emtricitabine was excreted primarily via renal excretion and primarily as parent drug, in mice, rats and 
monkeys. 
Radio-labelled tenofovir alafenamide was excreted for 22 – 36% in urine and 37 – 72% in feces of mice, rats and 
dogs. After IV administration of radiolabelled tenofovir to bile duct-cannulated animals, in rats, excretion was 
93% in urine, 4% in feces and 2% in bile and in dogs, excretion was 27% in urine, 43% in feces and 14% in bile. 
Tenofovir was excreted in milk of monkeys. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single oral doses of ≤ 100 mg/kg darunavir in mice and ≤ 500 mg/kg in rats produced no mortality and were 
well tolerated. In dogs, the maximum tolerated dose was 75 mg/kg, with vomiting being the limiting adverse 
effect. 
The maximum tolerated dose of cobicistat was 100 mg/kg in mice (moribund euthanasia occurred at 300 
mg/kg), and the NOAEL was 500 mg/kg in rats. 
Single dose toxicity studies with emtricitabine were conducted in mice and rats, using oral dose levels ranging 
from 1050 to 4000 mg/kg and i.v. dose levels ranging from 200 to 700 mg/kg. There were neither deaths nor 
any overt signs of toxicity observed at any of the doses tested. 
In rats, oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg tenofovir alafenamide were well tolerated. In dogs, the NOAEL was 30 
mg/kg p.o. Renal tubular changes and thymic atrophy were observed from 90 mg/kg and salivation, vomiting, 
reduced activity, tremors, and incoordination at 270 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Darunavir induced an increase in the red blood cell turnover, prolonged APTT and liver and thyroid changes 
which were associated with liver enzyme induction and an enhanced metabolism of thyroid hormones in rats. 
Increases in liver transaminases and single cell necrosis in combination studies with ritonavir in rats were 
attributed to ritonavir toxicity. In dogs, a limited increase in alkaline phosphatase (up to 45%) was observed. 
The maximum achieved exposure to darunavir in animal studies was low. 
In repeated dose studies with cobicistat, liver changes were observed in rats and mice which were associated 
with enzyme induction. In rats, slightly decreased red blood cell parameters were observed. In dogs, emesis, 
decreases in body weight and food consumption and up to 2-fold increases in ALT and ALP were observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 31/106 
  
  
In repeated dose studies with emtricitabine in mice, rats and monkeys, changes in the red blood cell parameters 
were observed which were interpreted as mild, reversible anaemia. 
Target organs of tenofovir alafenamide were kidneys and bone, which are the known target organs of tenofovir. 
Effects on kidneys consisted of karyomegaly in rats and dogs and tubular degeneration / regeneration in dogs. 
Atrophy of metaphyseal cancellous bone was observed in rats and increased biochemical markers of bone 
turnover and decrease serum 1, 25-dihydroxy- and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in rats and dogs. In the 39-week 
study in dogs, minimal infiltration of histiocytes was present in some animals in eye, with posterior uveitis, lung 
and spleen. In-life ophthalmologic examinations were normal in this study and in other studies and other 
species. No microscopic changes were observed in ocular tissue in other animal species and in a 4-week dog 
study.  
Combination darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide 
Non-clinically, effects on red blood cell parameters were seen for darunavir, cobicistat and emtricitabine. For all 
three compounds these effects were mild or limited. Anaemia is included as adverse effect in the SmPC. There 
are no relevant other overlapping toxicities. Additional non-clinical studies to study potential interactions are 
considered not necessary. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
Darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide tested negative in standard packages of 
genotoxicity studies. 
In carcinogenicity studies with darunavir in rats and mice and with cobicistat in rats, increased tumours were 
found in liver and/or thyroid, which were considered associated with liver enzyme induction and not relevant for 
humans. No increased tumour incidence was observed in a carcinogenicity study with cobicistat in mice. In 
long-term carcinogenicity studies with emtricitabine, no drug-related increases in tumour incidence were found 
in rats and mice. No carcinogenicity studies were performed with tenofovir alafenamide. In a carcinogenicity 
study with tenofovir disoproxil in mice, duodenal neoplasms were observed at low incidence at 15 times the 
human therapeutic AUCss. A rat carcinogenicity study with tenofovir disoproxil was negative. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No effects on fertility and early embryonic development were observed for darunavir, cobicistat and tenofovir 
alafenamide in rats and for emtricitabine in mice and rats. 
No embryo-foetal toxicity was observed for darunavir in rats, rabbits and mice, but exposure was low. Cobicistat 
did not cause teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. In rats, cobicistat caused increases in post-implantation loss, 
skeletal variations and decreased fetal weights, which were associated with significant maternal toxicity. 
Emtricitabine did not cause embryo-foetal toxicity in mice and rabbits, despite the presence of maternal toxicity 
in rabbits. Tenofovir alafenamide did not cause teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. In rats, tenofovir alafenamide 
caused decreased foetal body weight and skeletal variations. 
No effects on the pre- and postnatal development were observed for cobicistat and emtricitabine in rats and 
mice respectively. Darunavir caused a reduction in pup body weight gain and a slight delay in the opening of 
eyes and ears in rats. No pre- and postnatal development study was performed with tenofovir alafenamide.

Tenofovir disoproxil caused reduced pup survival and animal weights and a slight delay in sexual maturation in 
rats.  
Juvenile toxicity studies were performed with darunavir and cobicistat in rats. Darunavir caused higher systemic 
exposure and toxicity (mortality, central nervous system effects) in pups younger than 23 days than in pups 
older than 23 days or in adults, probably due to immature metabolism and blood brain barrier. In young rats 
dosed from post-natal day 22 to 49 with cobicistat, no increased toxicity compared to adults was observed. 
Local tolerance and antigenicity 
Darunavir was not irritating to skin or eyes. Cobicistat was mildly irritating to skin and a non-severe irritant to 
eyes. Tenofovir alafenamide was not irritating to skin and a noncorrosive/non-severe irritant to eyes. No local 
tolerance studies were performed with emtricitabine. 
Darunavir, cobicistat and tenofovir alafenamide showed no potential for sensitization in the local lymph node 
assay in mice. No antigenicity studies were performed with emtricitabine. 
Immunotoxicity 
No immunotoxicity was observed in a T-cell dependent antibody assay with darunavir in rats. In a T-cell 
dependent antibody assay with cobicistat in rats, anti-KLH IgG titer was decreased in females. No significant 
effects were observed on anti-KLH IgG titer in males or on IgM titer. Emtricitabine did not affect the IgM 
antibody response in the rat to sheep red blood cells. No immunotoxicity studies were performed with tenofovir 
alafenamide or with tenofovir disoproxil.

Conclusions on studies for tenofovir 
Tenofovir is not PBT, nor vPvB. Considering the above data, tenofovir is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The data supporting this application was generated for the single components of the fixed dose combination 
(darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide) and as a consequence no new non-clinical 
studies were provided. 
Potential for PR interval prolongation has been reported for cobicistat and tenofovir alafenamide in non-clinical 
studies; however clinically,no cardiovascular signals were observed from cobicistat or tenofovir alafenamide. No 
additional investigation of the combination was considered necessary. 
Effects on red blood cell parameters were observed for darunavir, cobicistat and emtricitabine in non-clincial 
studies. For all three compounds these effects were mild or limited. Of note, anaemia is listed in the SmPC. 
There are no relevant other overlapping toxicities.  
Additional non-clinical studies to study potential interactions are not considered necessary. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections for the approval of the darunavir / cobicistat / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide 
fixed dose combination from a non-clinical point of view.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Darunavir (DRV; Prezista) is a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor (PI) currently 
indicated as a single agent for the treatment of HIV 1 infection. Darunavir needs to be administered with a 
pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer to increase its bioavailability, via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibition.  
Cobicistat (COBI) is a structural analogue of (low-dose) ritonavir and is a potent mechanism-based CYP3A 
inhibitor. Cobicistat has no anti-HIV-1 activity but is licensed as a PK enhancer of DRV 800 mg once daily. 
Cobicistat increases the systemic exposure of other co-administered drugs metabolized by CYP3A, including the 
HIV-1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor elvitegravir (EVG) as well as the HIV-1 PI DRV. Darunavir and COBI 
(DRV/COBI; Rezolsta) as a FDC tablet (800 mg/150 mg) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral 
medicinal products for the treatment of HIV 1 infection. Cobicistat 150 mg once daily is also approved as part of 
a fixed-dose combination (FDC) drug containing elvitegravir (EVG), emtricitabine (FTC, Emtriva), tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate (TDF, Viread) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and COBI (Stribild/Genvoya) for the 
treatment of HIV 1 infection in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. 
Emtricitabine is an approved nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), indicated in combination with 
other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children aged at least 4 
months.

Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide analogue that inhibits HIV-1 reverse transcription. The active form of TFV is 
intracellular tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP). Tenofovir needs to be administered as a prodrug to improve its 
oral absorption. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is an oral prodrug of TFV and remains the preferred nucleotide 
analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor. However, nephrotoxicity and reduced bone mineral density may occur, 
including elevated risks of reduced kidney function, proteinuria and proximal tubular dysfunction in some 
patients. 
Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) is an oral prodrug of TFV that is more stable in plasma than TDF and is 
predominantly hydrolyzed to TFV intracellularly by cathepsin A, resulting in higher intracellular levels of the 
active phosphorylated metabolite TFV-DP and much lower circulating plasma levels of TFV relative to TDF. This 
distinct metabolism of TAF is intended to both maximize antiviral potency and improve clinical safety compared 
with TDF. 
The combination of FTC and TAF (F/TAF, Descovy) is licensed as a combination tablet indicated for the treatment 
of HIV-1 in combination with other antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents 12 years and older. When 
used in combination with an antiretroviral therapy (ART) requiring a PK enhancer, including boosted DRV, the 
recommended dose of F/TAF is 200/10 mg. 
Once daily combined ART regimens are aimed at reducing the pill burden for patients with HIV 1. There remains 
a need for simplified PI-based ART that combines potent and sustained efficacy, favourable tolerability, and 
minimal long-term toxicity, with practical, convenient dosing. To reduce the pill burden for DRV-containing 
antiretroviral regimens, the Applicant and Gilead Sciences have co-formulated TAF with DRV, COBI, and FTC to 
form the first PI based FDC single-tablet option. The D/C/F/TAF FDC is intended to be marketed for use in the 
same populations of HIV-1 infected subjects for which DRV/COBI 800/150 mg in combination with other 
antiretrovirals once daily is authorised and extended to the adolescent population. 
The development program for the D/C/F/TAF FDC tablet combining four components into a single tablet focused 
on bridging the PK for each of the components in their approved dose for co-administration between the FDC 
tablet and combination of formulations of the separate agents. Three biopharmaceutics studies evaluated the 
relative bioavailability or bioequivalence of DRV, COBI, FTC, and TAF co-administered as single agents, or as the 
D/C/F/TAF FDC tablet, in healthy subjects. This PK bridging also allows the extrapolation of historical safety and 
efficacy data for DRV, COBI and FTC/TAF to the D/C/F/TAF FDC. In addition, one study evaluated the PK, efficacy 
and safety of the D/C/F/TAF FDC in HIV-1 infected ART-naïve subjects. The PK and/or PD properties of 
D/C/F/TAF as a fixed dose combination were studied in 423 subjects (72 subjects in TMC114FD2HTX1002, 96 
subjects in TMC114FD2HTX1001, 102 subjects in GS-US-299-0101 and 153 subjects in GS-US-299-0102). 
Overview of the development of the single components  
The development program of the D/C/F/TAF FDC tablet has additionally been built on the information accrued 
from the development program for DRV/COBI and on the development program for F/TAF.  
DRV/COBI 
The data that supported the registration of the DRV/COBI 800/150 mg FDC were two relative oral bioavailability 
studies (bridging DRV/COBI with established data from single agent DRV boosted with low-dose ritonavir), one 
bioequivalence study, and one Phase 3b, open-label study: 
Study GS-US-216-0115 compared darunavir/low-dose ritonavir (DRV/rtv) 800/100 mg co-administered as 
single agents to DRV/COBI 800/150 mg co-administered as single agents in healthy subjects following repeated 
once daily dosing under fed conditions.

Study TMC114IFD1001 compared DRV/COBI 800/150 mg FDC tablet formulations to DRV/rtv 800/100 mg 
co-administered as single agents in healthy subjects following repeated once daily dosing under fed conditions.  
Study TMC114IFD1003 established bioequivalence of the DRV/COBI FDC to combined administration of 
formulations of the separate agents, and evaluated the food effect for the DRV/COBI FDC.  
Study GS-US-216-0130 assessed the safety and efficacy of the combined use of DRV and COBI, co-administered 
as separate agents in HIV-1 infected subjects and contained an intensive PK substudy (N=60) and sparse PK 
sampling for population PK purposes.

Extensive population PK analyses were not performed as part of the clinical program for the D/C/F/TAF FDC. 
Population PK data for TAF are available for a limited number of subjects in the GS-US-299-0102 study and is 
discussed under pharmacokinetics in the target population.  
Statistical methods 
PK parameters were summarized by descriptive statistics. Pairwise comparisons between two treatments for 
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values 
were based on log-transformed data. Ratios and 90% confidence intervals (CI) represent the ratio of point 
estimates of the geometric mean or least square (LS) mean and associated CIs, except for study 
TMC114FD2HTX1001 where 90.14% CIs were derived because of the intermediate sample size re-estimation. 
Bioequivalence between treatments or absence of food effect or absence of drug-drug interaction was concluded 
if the 90% CI of area under the plasma concentration-time curve measured from time zero and extrapolated to 
infinity (AUC∞) and Cmax treatment ratios were within established limits of 80.00% to 125.00%. For TAF PK, 
given its higher within-subject variability, broader limits of 70.00% to 143.00% were sometimes used, as 
indicated in the clinical study report provided. 
Overview of the development of the fixed dose combination 
Formulation development 
The target product profile was a once daily immediate release oral solid dosage form incorporating 800 mg 
equivalent (eq.) of DRV (free form), 150 mg eq. of COBI (non-adsorbed form), 200 mg of FTC, and 10 mg eq. 
of TAF (free form), while maintaining a maximum core tablet weight of approximately 1,600 mg. The 
formulation development was based on prior formulation experience with DRV in the Prezista product line and 
with DRV/COBI in the Rezolsta product line, the inclusion of FTC and TAF and the need to minimize tablet size 
while combining four drug substances in a FDC product. 
Both monolayer and bilayer tablet formulation concepts were evaluated. The bilayer tablet was evaluated to 
mitigate potential chemical instability of TAF. For all formulations, DRV, COBI, and FTC were used at 800, 150, 
and 200 mg eq., respectively. For TAF, a dose range of the drug product was initially based on relevant clinical 
data with the separate agent (8 to 40 mg). D/C/F/TAF concept formulations containing TAF 25 mg or TAF 10 mg 
were evaluated clinically. Each formulation concept required different formulation and processing approaches. 
Two different monolayer tablet formulations (A and B) were developed using a co-dry granulation formulation 
concept and used for further clinical evaluation, that are only differentiated by the quantity of TAF present in 
each formulation (25 mg eq. and 10 mg eq., respectively, tablet weight 1597 mg).  
In the bilayer formulation, layer 1 contained DRV and layer 2 contained COBI, FTC and TAF, according to a 
concept with a fluid bed/dry granulation process using HPC as a binder for DRV. 
The monolayer and bilayer tablet formulations described above were evaluated in a relative bioavailability study 
GS-US-299-0101, which is described below. The monolayer formulation containing 10 mg TAF (monolayer A 
[denoted as Formulation 3 in the GS-US-299-0101 study]) was selected as the Phase 2 formulation. 
The Phase 2 formulation was used in study GS-US-299-0102 in HIV-1 infected subjects. The manufactured 
Phase 2 drug product batches all met the proposed release specifications. During the manufacture of Phase 2 
formulation batches, minor processing issues related to poor powder flow during tablet compression were 
encountered. To facilitate processing, the extragranular quantity of croscarmellose sodium and microcrystalline 
cellulose were moved to the intragranular phase and the formulation was designated G001 (intended 
Assessment report

Page 43/106 
  
  
commercial formulation). The overall quantity of each component in the core tablets is identical between the 
Phase 2 and G001 formulations. 
In the manufacture of the commercial G001 formulation, the non-functional film coating agent was changed 
from Opadry II White 85F18422 to Opadry II Yellow 85F120020. This is not expected to alter the relative 
bioavailability of the D/C/F/TAF FDC G001 formulation. 
The intended commercial formulation (G001) of the D/C/F/TAF FDC was used in the pivotal bioequivalence study 
(TMC114FD2HTX1001) as well as in study TMC114FD2HTX1002. An overview of the biopharmaceutics studies, 
including the used formulations, is provided in Table 11. The PK and/or PD properties of D/C/F/TAF as a fixed 
dose combination were studied in 423 subjects.

Relative bioavailability study GS-US-299-0101 
This was a Phase 1, adaptive-design, randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, 3-part, multiple-cohort, 
single-center study. 102 subjects were enrolled (N=30 in Part 1, N=36 in Part 2, and N=36 in Part 3). Clinical 
study report was dated November 30, 2012. 
Study GS-US-299-0101 compared three candidate D/C/F/TAF FDC tablet formulations after repeated dosing in 
order to select a formulation for Phase 2; and subsequently the PK and bioavailability of DRV, COBI, FTC, TAF, 
and TFV when administered as the selected Phase 2 D/C/F/TAF FDC relative to the administration of the 
individual components: DRV plus COBI or FTC plus TAF.  
Part 1 evaluated the PK of DRV, COBI, FTC, TAF, and TFV when administered as 3 FDC formulations of D/C/F/TAF 
(including 2 TAF doses) in order to select the Phase 2 TAF dose and formulation. The treatments were given

according to a parallel design once daily in the morning for 21 days with food. PK of TAF and TFV was compared 
on Days 1, 6, 12 and 21; PK of DRV, COBI and FTC was compared on Day 12. The following treatments were 
compared: treatment A FDC Formulation 1 monolayer (DRV 800 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg), 
treatment B FDC Formulation 2 bilayer (DRV 800 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 25 mg) and treatment C 
FDC Formulation 3 monolayer (DRV 800 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 10 mg). 
Tenofovir alafenamide and TFV single- and multiple-dose exposures were comparable between the higher TAF 
dose formulations (Formulations 1 and 2; 25 mg TAF), while administration of lower TAF dose formulation 
(Formulation 3; 10 mg TAF) led to proportionally lower exposures of TAF and TFV. The resulting TFV plasma 
levels from the FDC with 10 mg TAF were approximately 90% lower than levels following administration of a FDC 
containing E/C/F/TDF or following administration of TDF with boosted PIs. 
Tenofovir exposures from each formulation were consistent across Day 12 and Day 21, indicating achievement 
of steady state. Following multiple doses of each FDC formulation, the TAF exposure parameters AUClast and 
Cmax were lower (approximately 30% to 50%), as compared with exposures following a single dose, consistent 
with a mixed inhibitory/inductive effect on TAF absorption. The TAF exposures were in a range associated with 
antiviral activity, for all formulations (i.e. similar to those observed in a previous proof-of-concept study 
[GS-US-120-0104]). 
Darunavir, COBI and FTC exposures were comparable across formulations; formal statistical testing showed 
that 90% CIs for LS mean ratio of Cmax and AUC were generally within the 80% to 125% bounds. Systemic 
exposures of DRV, COBI, and FTC were consistent with historical data, for all formulations. 
Subsequently, Formulation 3 was chosen for Part 3 of this study and for further development. 
Part 3 evaluated the PK and bioavailability of DRV, COBI, FTC, TAF, and TFV when administered as the proposed 
Phase 2 D/C/F/TAF FDC relative to the administration of DRV 800 mg + COBI 150 mg alone (in cohort 1, N=19) 
or to FTC 200 mg + TAF 25 mg alone (in cohort 2, N=16). This part of the study confirmed that no major 
drug-drug interaction occurs between DRV/COBI and FTC, when administered as D/C/F/TAF(10 mg) FDC 
relative to either the administration of DRV/COBI or F/TAF(25 mg) alone. Based on Cmax and AUC, single-dose 
TAF exposures were lower and TFV exposures were similar following administration of D/C/F/TAF FDC (TAF 10 
mg) compared with FTC + TAF (25 mg). 
Part 2 of study GS-US-299-0101 study confirmed that no major drug-drug interaction occurs between 
DRV/COBI, FTC and TDF (i.e. TFV), when administered as COBI-boosted DRV (DRV 800 mg + COBI 150 mg) 
plus F/TDF (FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg) FDC relative to either the administration of DRV/COBI or F/TDF FDC 
alone. 
The monolayer formulation containing 10 mg TAF (monolayer A [denoted as Formulation 3 in the 
GS-US-299-0101 study]) was selected as the Phase 2 formulation. The Phase 2 formulation was subsequently 
used in study GS-US-299-0102 in HIV-1 infected subjects. During the manufacture of Phase 2 formulation 
batches, minor changes were made to the formulation and the new formulation was designated G001 (intended 
commercial formulation). The overall quantity of each component in the core tablets is identical between the 
Phase 2 and G001 formulations. The intended commercial formulation (G001) of the D/C/F/TAF FDC was used 
in the pivotal bioequivalence study TMC114FD2HTX1001 as well as in the food effect study 
TMC114FD2HTX1002.  
As the overall quantity of each component in the core tablets and each excipient is identical between the Phase 
2 and G001 formulations, no major differences in absorption and thus PK exposures between both formulations 
are expected. However this cannot be confirmed by clinical PK data as the available PK data from studies

TMC114FD2HTX1001/1002 refer to single-dose data and the available PK data from studies 
GS-US-299-0101/0102 refer to multiple-dose data and therefore PK data cannot be compared directly.  
Pivotal bioequivalence study TMC114FD2HTX1001 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the single-dose PK and pivotal bioequivalence of the D/C/F/TAF FDC 
relative to the separate agents (DRV 800 mg tablet formulation and F/TAF 200/10 mg FDC in the presence of 
150 mg COBI), under fed conditions (standardized regular-fat breakfast, in healthy subjects). 
The study population comprised 96 healthy adult subjects, with a blinded (for treatment) sample size 
re-estimation when 96 subjects had been dosed (because of uncertainty around the within-subject variability in 
TAF PK. The results of this sample size re-estimation indicated no additional subjects were to be recruited, and 
recruitment was halted at 96 subjects. 
A summary of the PK parameters is presented in Table 5. The D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10-mg FDC tablet is 
bioequivalent to combined administration of the separate agents DRV, the F/TAF FDC, and COBI, with respect to 
both rate and extent of absorption of the four components involved. The 90% CIs of the LS mean ratios of all 
main PK parameters for all four compounds (DRV, COBI, FTC, TAF) were within the 80.00% to 125.00% 
acceptance range. 
The comparison of the D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10-mg FDC tablet to the separate agents DRV, the F/TAF FDC, 
and COBI is acceptable for assessment of bioequivalence, as all of these agents are authorised separately, in 
various combination products and based on full dossiers. Furthermore, fixed dose combinations of the 
components (DRV/COBI and F/TAF) are already approved, respectively as REZOLSTA and DESCOVY, and can be 
used in combination.

Food effect study TMC114FD2HTX1002 
In study TMC114FD2HTX1002, the effect of concomitant food intake (standardized high calorie/high-fat 
breakfast, 56 g fat) on the oral bioavailability of DRV, COBI, FTC and TAF following oral administration of 
D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg as 1 x FDC tablet was investigated. 
This was a Phase 1, randomized, 3-panel, open-label, 2-way crossover study in healthy subjects. In each panel, 
during 2 subsequent sessions, each subject received 2 treatments as a single dose, randomized (within panel) 
according to a classical 2-sequence, 2-period Williams design. The study population comprised 72 healthy 
volunteers (24 subjects in each panel).  
The results of panel 3 of the food-effect FDC study show that mean Cmax of FTC and TAF were 1.26- and 
1.82-fold higher, respectively, after administration of the D/C/F/TAF FDC under fasted compared to fed 
conditions, and mean AUClast for both FTC and TAF were comparable for both conditions. Mean Cmax and AUC 
values were lower under fasted compared to fed condition for both DRV (30% to 45% lower) and COBI (16% to 
29% lower). 
The impact of food on the PK of COBI, FTC and TAF is not considered to be clinically relevant by the applicant, 
which can be agreed to. Based on the improved absorption of DRV in fed condition and in line with other DRV 
containing formulations, it is recommended that the D/C/F/TAF FDC tablet be taken with food. The type of food 
does not affect the exposure of DRV. Intake with food was also recommended for subjects in studies with the 
D/C/F/TAF FDC (except when evaluating the food effect) or studies with other DRV-containing regimens. This 
advice is also in agreement with the advice in the Rezolsta (DRV/COBI) SmPC, which states that the FDC tablet 
should be taken with food and the Descovy (F/TAF) SmPC, which states that the FDC tablet may be taken with 
or without food. 
In summary, the CHMP agreed with the strict intake with food and is reflected in the SmPC. 
Panel 1 of study TMC114FD2HTX1002 evaluated the relative oral bioavailability of TAF and FTC after single-dose 
administration of D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg FDC compared to E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg FDC under 
fed (regular-fat standard breakfast, 21 g fat) conditions. The results of this panel show that no major differences 
were observed regarding the PK of FTC for both FDC tablets and exposure to TAF was 30% lower for D/C/F/TAF 
versus E/C/F/TAF, but these results are less relevant for this application. 
Panel 2 of study TMC114FD2HTX1002evaluated the relative oral bioavailability of DRV, COBI, FTC, and TAF after 
single-dose administration of D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg FDC compared to the separate agents (DRV as 1

x 800 mg tablet, F/TAF as 1 x 200/10 mg tablet and COBI as 1 x 150 mg tablet) under fed (regular-fat standard 
breakfast, 21 g fat) conditions. The design of this panel of the study was similar to the design of the pivotal 
bioequivalence study TMC114FD2HTX1001, but this panel preceded the pivotal bioequivalence study and used 
a smaller sample size (24 subjects versus 96 subjects). The PK parameters for DRV, COBI and FTC all showed 
bioequivalence with respect to the usual 80 to 125% acceptance interval. For TAF AUC bioequivalence was also 
demonstrated, but for TAF Cmax the lower confidence limit (72%) was below the 80 to 125% acceptance interval. 
The point estimate of 91% does not exclude bioequivalence however and the smaller size of this study and the 
large variation in TAF plasma exposures need to be taken into account. The median t max and terminal half-life 
(t 1/2) were comparable between treatments for all components. In general, it can be concluded that the results 
of this panel are in agreement with the results of the fully powered pivotal bioequivalence study. 
Phase 2 Study GS-US-299-0101 in HIV-1 infected subjects 
The non-compartmental PK of DRV, COBI, FTC, TAF and TFV following multiple-dose administration of the 
D/C/F/TAF FDC in HIV-1 infected subjects were assessed in a PK substudy of Phase 2 study GS-US-299-0102 
and compared to those for DRV+COBI+F/TDF, which has been assessed previously as part of the Descovy 
dossier. Overall, the plasma exposures of TAF, DRV, COBI, and FTC in this study were consistent with historical 
data for these agents, both in healthy and HIV-1 infected subjects.  
Multiple-dose DRV, COBI and FTC PK parameters in study GS US 299 0102 (target population) were consistent 
with those observed in GS-US-299-0101 (healthy population), when D/C/F/TAF was administered as the FDC. 
For TAF, the median (Q1, Q3) plasma half-life was 0.45 (0.38, 0.66) hours, no drug was detectable 8 hours after 
administration, and the mean AUClast (130.5 ng.h/mL) was consistent with historical data for subjects receiving 
the D/C/F/TAF FDC or TAF 25 mg single agent in the TAF proof-of-concept study (mean AUClast 115.2 ng.h/mL, 
study GS-US-120-0104). 
The TFV plasma concentrations following the D/C/F/TAF FDC were markedly lower, as anticipated, compared 
with those following DRV + COBI + F/TDF. Administration of the D/C/F/TAF FDC led to substantially lower 
(~90%) mean [%CV] systemic exposure (AUCtau, 339 [37.1%] ng.h/mL) versus administration of DRV plus 
COBI plus F/TDF (3737 [26.8%] ng.h/mL). 
These data showed that there no major differences in pharmacokinetics of DRV, COBI, FTC and TAF (TFV) 
between healthy subjects and HIV-1 infected subjects. This was confirmed for TAF and TFV by additional 
population PK modelling. 
Key pharmacokinetics aspects 
Absorption  
Darunavir, COBI, FTC and TAF are all orally available when co-administered as the D/C/F/TAF FDC tablet. 
Darunavir has an absolute bioavailability of 82% when co-administered with the PK enhancer rtv, and 37% 
when administered without rtv. The absolute bioavailability of DRV when administered with COBI is unknown. 
The mean absolute bioavailability of FTC (administered as 200 mg capsule) is estimated to be 93%. The 
absolute bioavailability of TAF is unknown.  
Darunavir exposure is enhanced by co-administration with COBI, such that DRV exposures (AUC24h and C max) 
comparable to DRV co-administered with rtv are achieved. 
The D/C/F/TAF FDC is bioequivalent to co-administration of formulations of the separate agents DRV, COBI, and 
F/TAF.  
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 48/106 
  
  
The D/C/F/TAF FDC should be taken with food, in line with the advice in the Rezolsta (DRV/COBI) SmPC, which 
states that the FDC tablet should be taken with food and the Descovy (F/TAF) SmPC, which states that the FDC 
tablet may be taken with or without food. The food-effect study with the FDC showed that mean Cmax of FTC and 
TAF were 1.26- and 1.82-fold higher, respectively, after administration of the D/C/F/TAF FDC under fasted 
compared to fed conditions, and mean AUClast for both FTC and TAF were comparable for both conditions. Mean 
Cmax and AUC values were lower under fasted compared to fed condition for both DRV (30% to 45% lower) and 
COBI (16% to 29% lower). The impact of food on the PK of COBI, FTC and TAF is agreed to be not clinically 
relevant. Based on the improved absorption of DRV in fed condition and in line with other DRV containing 
formulations, it is recommended that the D/C/F/TAF FDC tablet be taken with food. The type of food does not 
affect the exposure of DRV. 
The mean DRV, COBI, FTC, and TAF exposures following multiple-dose administration of D/C/F/TAF 
800/150/200/10 mg once daily in healthy subjects were generally comparable to the exposures following 
administration of the D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg FDC once daily in HIV-1 infected subjects.  
In an additional relative bioavailability study (TMC114FD2HTX1004), the administration of the whole D/C/F/TAF 
FDC tablet was compared to administration of a split tablet and of a crushed tablet (mixed in applesauce), under 
fed conditions in healthy adult subjects. Intake of the D/C/F/TAF FDC as a split tablet compared to as a whole 
tablet did not impact the relative bioavailability (AUC and Cmax) of the different components (DRV, COBI, FTC 
and TAF), except for an 11% decrease in TAF Cmax. The latter is not considered clinically relevant. Intake of the 
D/C/F/TAF FDC as a crushed tablet compared to as a whole tablet decreased the relative bioavailability of TAF 
by 29% for Cmax and 19% for AUC and did not impact the relative bioavailability of DRV, COBI and FTC (except 
for a 17% decrease in FTC Cmax). These results show that the D/C/F/TAF tablet can be split prior to intake 
without impact on the bioavailability of the components. 
Distribution 
Darunavir is approximately 95% bound to plasma protein. Darunavir binds primarily to plasma α1-acid 
glycoprotein. 
Cobicistat is 97% to 98% bound to human plasma proteins and the mean plasma to blood-drug concentration 
ratio was approximately 2. 
In vitro binding of emtricitabine to human plasma proteins was < 4%, independent of concentration (over the 
range of 0.02-200 mcg/mL). At peak plasma concentration, the mean plasma to blood drug concentration ratio 
was approximately 1.0. 
Ex vivo binding of tenofovir alafenamide to human plasma proteins in samples collected during clinical studies 
was approximately 80%. In vitro binding of tenofovir to human plasma proteins is < 0.7%, independent of 
concentration (over the range of 0.01-25 mcg/mL).  
Elimination 
Darunavir and COBI are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Cobicistat is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A 
and increases the DRV exposure such that DRV exposures (AUC24h and Cmax) comparable to DRV 
co-administered with rtv are achieved. Darunavir is predominantly excreted in feces, with minimal renal 
excretion. The renal excretion of COBI is also low. 
Emtricitabine is primarily eliminated from the plasma via renal excretion as unchanged drug (approximately 
65% of an oral dose and approximately 73% of an intravenous dose). Emtricitabine undergoes little 
metabolism; therefore, metabolism is a minor route of FTC elimination.

Inside cells, tenofovir alafenamide is converted by intracellular enzymes to TFV and subsequently 
phosphorylated to the pharmacologically active TFV-DP. Due to increased plasma stability and activation by 
cathepsin A, as compared with TDF, TAF is more efficiently loaded into peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) (including lymphocytes and other HIV target cells) and macro¬phages, which results in greater 
concentrations of TFV-DP in PBMCs and lower exposure of TFV in the systemic circulation (approximately 90% 
lower). Tenofovir alafenamide is thus extensively metabolized, and predominantly excreted as TFV. There is 
very minimal renal excretion for TAF. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Based on the clinical studies with individual components, it is concluded that DRV administered with booster rtv 
increased somewhat less than dose proportionally, COBI increased supra-proportionally and both FTC and TAF 
behaved dose proportionally across the range of doses studied. 
DRV in plasma in combination with COBI tends to exhibit time dependent pharmacokinetics and despite a mean 
elimination half-life of 6 hours does accumulate over time upon once daily dosing, approximately 30% increased 
based on a cross-study comparison. This is probably related to the non-linear boosting effect of COBI. 
COBI in plasma shows time (and dose) dependent pharmacokinetics and exhibits a 1.5- to 1.7-fold increase in 
exposure following once daily dosing relative to single-dose administration (mean elimination half-life 3-4 
hours). Being a mechanism based inhibitor of CYP3A, COBI exhibits both dose/concentration- and 
time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A. Its ability to effectively DRV as a CYP3A substrate is dependent on the 
concentrations that are achieved pre-systemically and/or systemically. 
FTC in plasma tends to follow linear, first-order pharmacokinetics, with steady-state plasma FTC 
concentration-time profiles (upon once daily dosing) predictable from single dose data with approximately 20% 
accumulation (mean elimination half-life 17 hours). 
Following once daily dosing of each FDC formulation, the TAF exposure parameters AUCtau and Cmax were 
lower (approx. 30% and 25%), as compared with exposures following a single dose, consistent with a mixed 
inhibitory/inductive effect on TAF absorption, indicative of non-linear pharmacokinetics of TAF in time. The 
decrease in TAF levels following multiple doses of the FDC formulation containing 10 mg TAF, relative to 
single-dose administration, may be due to an inductive effect of DRV on P-gp. 
In contrast, there was a 2- to 3-fold increase in plasma TFV after once daily dosing compared to single dose 
administration (in line with a mean elimination half-life around 30 hours). 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Based on the data from the clinical studies with the new FDC combination administered after multiple dosing 
under fed conditions, the between-subject variability in DRV exposure and in COBI exposure was in the range of 
25-45%, in FTC exposure in the range of 15-35% and in TAF exposure in the range of 25-35%. The 
between-subject variability in exposure tended to be higher for HIV-1 infected subjects as compared to healthy 
subjects for all analytes. 
Specifically for TAF, the between-subject variability in the absorption phase of the first single dose was 
significantly higher, but variability of Cmax after multiple dosing was also in the range of 25-50%. 
Furthermore, for DRV and COBI between-subject variability in exposure under fasted conditions tended to be 
higher than under fed conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 50/106 
  
  
Within-subject variability estimates as derived from the pivotal bioequivalence trial were all ≤  16% for AUC and 
Cmax of DRV, COBI and FTC; for TAF Cmax and TAF AUC within-subject variability was 36% and 21%, 
respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The non-compartmental PK of DRV, COBI, FTC, TAF and TFV following multiple-dose administration of the 
D/C/F/TAF FDC in HIV-1 infected subjects were assessed in a PK substudy of Phase 2 study GS-US-299-0102 
and compared to those for DRV+COBI+F/TDF.  
Study GS-US-299-0102 
Study GS-US-299-0102 was a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 
D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg FDC versus COBI-boosted DRV (DRV 800 mg plus COBI 150 mg) plus F/TDF 
200/300 mg (Truvada) in HIV-1 infected ART-naïve adult subjects. The PK of the components was also 
assessed. Subjects were randomized 2:1 (D/C/F/TAF FDC: DRV plus COBI plus F/TDF). Both treatments were 
administered once daily for 48 weeks. Overall, 153 subjects (103 subjects in the D/C/F/TAF FDC group and 50 
subjects in the DRV plus COBI plus F/TDF group) were enrolled, of which 21 and 11, respectively, participated 
in the PK substudy: on or between the Week 4 and 8 visit, blood sampling for intensive PK profiling in plasma 
and/or PBMCs was conducted at selected study sites (blood samples collected at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours post-dose). At Week 8, 24, and 48 visits, for all subjects PK trough samples were taken.  
Steady-state PK parameters for DRV, COBI, FTC, TAF, TFV and TFV-DP (PBMCs) were determined under fed 
conditions following administration of the D/C/F/TAF FDC for subjects who participated in the intensive PK 
substudy (n=21, visit at Week 4 or 8); 14 subjects were included in the PBMC substudy analysis set. 
Steady-state plasma PK parameters for TFV and TFV-DP (PBMCs) were determined under fed conditions 
following administration of DRV plus COBI plus F/TDF for subjects who participated in the intensive PK substudy 
(n=11); 8 subjects were included in the PBMC substudy analysis set. In addition, TAF population PK parameters 
(sparse sampling) are available for 52 subjects in the D/C/F/TAF treatment arm. 
The plasma PK parameters for DRV, COBI, FTC and TAF are shown in Table 6. The plasma exposures of DRV, 
COBI, and FTC were consistent with historical data for these agents. For TAF, the median (Q1, Q3) plasma 
half-life was 0.45 (0.38, 0.66) hours, no drug was detectable 8 hours after administration, and the mean AUClast 
(130.5 ng.h/mL) was consistent with historical data for subjects receiving the D/C/F/TAF FDC or TAF 25 mg 
single agent in the TAF proof-of-concept study (mean AUClast 115.2 ng.h/mL, study GS-US-120-0104). 
The TFV plasma concentrations following the D/C/F/TAF FDC were markedly lower, as anticipated, compared 
with those following DRV + COBI + F/TDF (Figure 5 and Table 7). Administration of the D/C/F/TAF FDC led to 
substantially  lower  (~90%)  mean  [%CV]  systemic  exposure  (AUCtau,  339  [37.1%]  ng.h/mL)  versus 
administration of DRV plus COBI plus F/TDF (3737 [26.8%] ng.h/mL). 
The PBMC intracellular TFV-DP AUCtau was markedly higher in the D/C/F/TAF FDC group than in the DRV plus 
COBI  plus  F/TDF  group.  The  TFV-DP  AUCtau  LS  mean  ratio  (TAF  vs  TDF)  of  652%  was  consistent  with  the 
approximate 5- to 7-fold increase in TFV-DP exposure observed following administration of TAF 25 mg versus 
TDF 300 mg in study GS-US-120-0104.

arm. The mean (%CV) TAF AUCtau was 101.7 ng.h/mL (49.8%) and the mean (%CV) TAF Cmax was 94.1 
ng/mL (53.3%) based on the population PK model. 
There are no data from population PK analyses for the other FDC components from studies with the D/C/F/TAF 
FDC. 
Comparison of healthy subjects and patients 
Overall, the plasma exposures of TAF, DRV, COBI, and FTC in the D/C/F/TAF FDC study in HIV-1 infected 
subjects (study GS-US-299-0102) were consistent with historical data for these agents, both in healthy and 
HIV-1 infected subjects.  
Multiple-dose DRV, COBI and FTC PK parameters in study GS US 299 0102 (target population) were consistent 
with those observed in GS-US-299-0101 (healthy population), when D/C/F/TAF was administered as the FDC.  
In the D/C/F/TAF Phase 2 study GS-US-299-0102, the median (Q1, Q3) plasma half-life for TAF was 0.45 (0.38, 
0.66) hours, no drug was detectable 8 hours after administration, and the mean (%CV) AUClast was 130.5 (34.1) 
ng.h/mL, which is consistent with historical data for TAF in healthy subjects receiving D/C/F/TAF or HIV-1 
infected subjects receiving TAF 25 mg single agent in the proof-of-concept study GS-US-120-0104 (mean 
AUCtau 115.2 ng.h/mL). The TAF PK parameters for D/C/F/TAF (TAF 10 mg) from study GS-US-299-0101 were 
also consistent with these historical data from study GS-US-120-0104 with TAF 25 mg single agent.

Special populations 
The information and guidance for special populations for the D/C/F/TAF FDC is derived from that for the separate 
agents, DRV, COBI, and F/TAF. 
Elderly 
Age was not a significant covariate for the PK of any of the components of the D/C/F/TAF FDC in the age range 
≤65 years. Limited PK information is available in the population of elderly (age ≥65 years) for the D/C/F/TAF 
FDC as well as its individual components. 
Paediatric population 
Adult doses for DRV, COBI, and F/TAF have shown to provide systemic exposures in paediatric subjects aged 
≥12 and <18 years that is comparable to that in adults. 
Gender and race 
Sex was not a significant covariate for the PK of any of the components of the D/C/F/TAF FDC. 
No clinically relevant differences due to race or ethnicity were identified for the PK of any of the components of 
the D/C/F/TAF FDC. 
Hepatic impairment 
Pharmacokinetic data and relevant safety data support administration of the D/C/F/TAF FDC once daily without 
dose adjustment in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The effect of severe hepatic impairment 
has not been evaluated. 
Renal impairment 
Pharmacokinetic data and relevant safety data support administration of the D/C/F/TAF FDC once daily without 
dose adjustment in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
calculated using Cockcroft Gault equation [eGFR] ≥ 30 mL/min). The D/C/F/TAF FDC should not be initiated in 
patients who have an eGFR <30 ml/min. 
Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C Virus Coinfection 
There were insufficient pharmacokinetic data in the clinical trials to determine the effect of hepatitis B and/or C 
virus infection on the pharmacokinetics of darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The drug interaction profile of the D/C/F/TAF FDC is primarily driven by the drug interaction profile of DRV/COBI.  
Darunavir and COBI are both mainly inhibitors of CYP3A, CYP2D6 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Co-administration 
with drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A, CYP2D6 and/or P-gp may result in increased plasma concentrations 
of those drugs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 55/106 
  
  
Because DRV and COBI are metabolized by CYP3A, drugs that induce CYP3A activity are expected to increase 
the apparent clearance (CL/F) of DRV and COBI, resulting in decreased plasma concentrations of DRV and/or 
COBI. Co-administration with other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may decrease the CL/F of DRV and COBI and may 
result in increased plasma concentrations of DRV and/or COBI. 
Emtricitabine has a low potential for drug interactions, both as a substrate or as a perpetrator. Emtricitabine is 
not an inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes and the potential for CYP mediated interactions involving FTC with other 
medicinal products is low. 
Emtricitabine is primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular 
secretion. No drug interactions due to competition for renal excretion have been observed. 
Tenofovir alafenamide has a low potential for drug interactions as a perpetrator. Tenofovir alafenamide is not an 
inhibitor of CYP450 enzymes. 
Tenofovir alafenamide is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-gp. Drugs that induce P-gp activity are expected 
to decrease the absorption of TAF, resulting in decreased plasma concentrations of TAF. Co-administration of 
TAF with drugs that inhibit P-gp may increase the absorption and plasma concentrations of TAF. 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed using the D/C/F/TAF FDC. The drug-drug interaction 
potential of the D/C/F/TAF FDC has been evaluated on the basis of interactions observed with each of the single 
components and, in the case of DRV, also when co-administered with rtv. All these studies have been assessed 
as part of the previous dossiers. 
The overview of drug interactions (based on observed data with single agents or predicted) and dosing 
recommendations has been directly combined for all (non-ARV) concomitant medications from the currently 
approved prescribing information for DRV/COBI and for FTC/TAF. 
An overview of drug interactions (based on observed data with single agents or predicted) and dosing 
recommendations are summarised in SmPC Section 4.5. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Darunavir is an inhibitor of the dimerisation and of the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease (dissociation 
constant [Kd] of 4.5x10-12 M). It selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV-encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in 
virus-infected cells, thereby preventing the formation of mature infectious virus particles. 
Cobicistat has no antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV-1 and does not antagonize the antiviral activity of 
DRV. Cobicistat is a pharmacoenhancer that is used to boost DRV exposures. 
Emtricitabine is a nucleoside analogue of 2’-deoxycytidine, which is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to 
form FTC triphosphate. Emtricitabine triphosphate inhibits HIV-1 replication through incorporation into viral 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by the HIV-1 RT, which results in DNA chain termination. Emtricitabine is specific to 
HIV-1 and HIV-2 and HBV. Intracellularly, FTC is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form the active 
metabolite, FTC 5’-triphosphate, which competitively inhibits the HIV-1 RT, resulting in DNA chain termination. 
Emtricitabine 5’-triphosphate is a very weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerase α, β, ε, and mitochondrial 
DNA polymerase γ, and there is no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in vitro and in vivo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 56/106 
  
  
Tenofovir alafenamide is a phosphonamidate prodrug of TFV (2’-deoxyadenosine monophosphate analogue). 
Tenofovir alafenamide is permeable to cells and due to increased plasma stability and intracellular activation 
through hydrolysis by CatA, TAF is more efficient than TDF in loading TFV into PBMCs (including lymphocytes 
and other HIV-1 target cells) and macrophages. Following its release from the TAF prodrug, intracellular TFV is 
subsequently phosphorylated to the pharmacologically active metabolite TFV diphosphate. Tenofovir 
diphosphate inhibits HIV-1 replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV-1 RT, which results in 
DNA chain termination, thereby effectively blocking the replication and spread of infectious HIV-1. 
Tenofovir is specific to HIV-1, HIV-2 and HBV. In vitro studies have shown that both FTC and TFV can be fully 
phosphorylated when combined in cells. Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA 
polymerases that include mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ, and there is no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria 
in vitro. 
Primary pharmacology 
Integrated virology analyses 
In the comparative Phase 2 study GS-US-299-0102 in HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve patients, no patient 
developed any DRV or primary PR mutations through Week 48. One patient, receiving D/C/F/TAF, had an 
NRTI-resistance mutation emerging after Week 48 (K65K/R and M184M/I). These mutations are associated with 
resistance to TDF/TAF and FTC, respectively. However, phenotypic susceptibilities to both FTC and TDF were in 
the sensitive range despite the presence of those mutations. These data are in line with the low level of 
development of resistance to DRV, FTC/TDF or TAF observed in earlier studies. 
Based on data of DRV/r 600/100mg twice daily in highly treatment-experienced patients, ‘development of drug 
resistance’ was initially classified as an important potential risk and later classified as an identified risk based on 
the Week-48 data from the trial TMC114-C212, in treatment-experienced paediatric subjects (from 6 to < 18 
years of age) evaluating the twice daily dosing regimen of DRV/rtv. Cumulative numbers on the development of 
drug resistance (including any genotype and/or phenotype data) were collected and discussed in the Periodic 
Safety Update Reports. It has been demonstrated that the risk of developing drug resistance is very low in 
treatment naïve and treatment-experienced patients with 0 DRV RAMs who take DRV/rtv 800/100 mg once 
daily. This evaluation is based on the TMC114-C211 (Week 48 up to Week 192 data) and the TMC114-C229 
(Week 48 data) and post-marketing data presented in the PSUR; development of genotypic/phenotypic 
resistance to DRV or other PIs and to NRTIs in the backbone (including FTC/TDF) is rarely observed. 
As expected, similar low level of resistance development was seen in virologic failures on DRV/COBI FDC 
(GS-US-216-0130 Week 48 up to Week 192 data). However, the risk of development of drug resistance was 
retained.  
‘Development of drug resistance’ has not been classified as a risk for FTC/TDF. There is no evidence to suggest 
that the substitution of TDF with TAF in the FDC will increase the risk of resistance development. 
Although there seems to be low levels of resistance development, the risk still exists and remains a safety 
concern. 
Secondary pharmacology 
No specific studies with D/C/F/TAF (as FDC or coadministered as single agents) have been conducted to 
investigate potential effects on the QT interval. In GS-US-299-0102 in ART-naïve subjects, there were no 
clinically relevant ECG findings that would suggest a potential effect of D/C/F/TAF on the QT interval. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 57/106 
  
  
potential effects on QT interval, has been investigated for the separate components and no clinically relevant 
effects were observed.  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
There was no apparent exposure-response relationship for virologic response and safety parameters. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical development program for the D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg FDC tablet is based on the clinical 
development programs for the DRV, COBI, FTC and TAF single agents and combinations thereof 
(darunavir/cobicistat [DRV/COBI, Rezolsta] and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide [F/TAF, Descovy]). A PK 
bridging clinical development program formed the basis for the application of this FDC tablet combining the four 
components in one tablet (D/C/F/TAF FDC). 
The objective of the pivotal bioequivalence study TMC114FD2HTX1001 was to evaluate the single-dose PK and 
pivotal bioequivalence of the D/C/F/TAF FDC relative to the separate agents (DRV 800 mg tablet formulation and 
F/TAF 200/10 mg FDC in the presence of 150 mg COBI), under fed conditions (standardized regular-fat 
breakfast, in 96 healthy subjects.  
The study showed that the D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10-mg FDC tablet is bioequivalent to combined 
administration of the separate agents DRV, the F/TAF FDC, and COBI, with respect to both rate and extent of 
absorption of the four components involved. The 90% CIs of the LS mean ratios of all main PK parameters for 
all four compounds (DRV, COBI, FTC, TAF) were within the 80.00% to 125.00% acceptance range. 
The comparison of the D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10-mg FDC tablet to the separate agents DRV, the F/TAF FDC, 
and COBI is acceptable for assessment of bioequivalence. Of note, the fixed dose combinations of the 
components DRV/COBI and F/TAF are authorised as REZOLSTA and DESCOVY, respectively and can be used in 
combination to construct an antiretroviral regimen. 
Furthermore, in study TMC114FD2HTX1002, the effect of concomitant food intake (standardized high 
calorie/high-fat breakfast, 56 g fat) on the oral bioavailability of DRV, COBI, FTC and TAF following oral 
administration of D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg as 1 x FDC tablet was investigated. The impact of food on the 
PK of COBI, FTC and TAF is not considered to be clinically relevant. Based on the improved absorption of DRV in 
fed condition and in line with other DRV containing formulations, it is recommended that the D/C/F/TAF FDC 
tablet be taken with food. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
In another panel of this study the relative oral bioavailability of DRV, COBI, FTC, and TAF after single-dose 
administration of D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg FDC was compared to the separate agents (DRV as 1 x 800 mg 
tablet, F/TAF as 1 x 200/10 mg tablet and COBI as 1 x 150 mg tablet) under fed (regular-fat standard breakfast, 
21 g fat) conditions. The study design was similar to the design of the pivotal bioequivalence study 
TMC114FD2HTX1001, but preceded the pivotal bioequivalence study and used a smaller sample size (24 
subjects versus 96 subjects). It could be concluded that the results of this panel are in agreement with the 
results of the fully powered pivotal bioequivalence study. 
An integrated virology analyses was provided which included the Phase 2 study (GS-US-299-0102 in HIV-1 
infected treatment-naïve patients), as well as results reported from studies with the individual components. 
Although development of drug resistance mutations is rare, this safety concern is reflected in the RMP.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The comparable exposure (i.e. AUC and Cmax) for DRV, COBI, FTC, and TAF when administered as single agents 
or as the D/C/F/TAF FDC in healthy subjects and HIV-1 infected ART-naïve subjects as compared with historical 
data, allows the extrapolation of safety and efficacy data from either darunavir/low-dose ritonavir (DRV/rtv) 
800/100 mg once daily, DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily or F/TAF 200/10 mg once daily to D/C/F/TAF 
800/150/200/10 mg once daily. 
The pivotal bioequivalence study showed that the D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10-mg FDC tablet is bioequivalent to 
combined administration of the separate agents DRV, the F/TAF FDC, and COBI. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies and main clinical studies 
For D/C/F/TAF, the efficacy, resistance, and safety profile is derived from the DRV/COBI and F/TAF development 
programs, supported by the Phase 2 double-blind Study GS-US-299-0102 (N=153; 103 subjects on 
D/C/F/TAF). An overview of relevant Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies supporting the DRV/COBI, the F/TAF and 
hence the D/C/F/TAF efficacy, resistance, and safety profile is presented in Table 10.

Study GS-US-299-0102 is the only clinical study submitted that has evaluated the proposed FDC containing 
D/C/F/TAF.  
Dose response studies 
The to be marketed fixed dose combination tablet consists of DRV 800 mg, COBI 150 mg, FTC 200 mg and TAF 
10 mg.  The 800 mg dose of DRV is approved for treatment-naive subjects and treatment-experienced subjects 
with no DRV-resistance-associated mutations. 
Cobicistat is a pharmacoenhancer that is used to boost DRV exposures, and the 150 mg dose was shown to 
boost DRV levels similarly to 100 mg ritonavir (Norvir®) in a Phase 1, multiple dose study to evaluate the 
relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of DRV once daily when coadministered with COBI or ritonavir once 
daily (GS-US-216-0115). Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated that DRV trough concentrations were 
consistently maintained above protein-adjusted EC50 for wild-type virus with COBI coadministration. 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017

The 200 mg dose of FTC represents the marketed dose for this drug. This dose of FTC is also part of the approved 
FDC products Truvada® (emtricitabine/tenofovir DF), Atripla® (efavirenz/emtricitabine/ tenofovir DF), and 
Genvoya (E/C/F/TAF), Descovy (F/TAF) and Odefsey (F/R/TAF), all indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 
infection. 
The 10 mg dose of TAF was selected based on the results of 3 Phase 1 or 1/2 studies, including the 
proof-of-concept Study GS-120-0104 and the 2 drug combination Studies GS-US-299-0101 and 
GS-US-311-0101. The proof-of-concept study, GS-US-120-0104, demonstrated that 3 doses of TAF 
monotherapy had potent antiviral activity in HIV-1 patients compared with TDF, with mean (± SD) change from 
baseline in HIV-1 RNA of -0.95 ± 0.45, -1.53 ± 0.40, -1.7 ± 0.22 and -0.81± 0.66 log10 copies/mL at the 8, 25, 
and 40 mg doses of TAF, and 300 mg dose of TDF, respectively. 
Preliminary results from Studies GS-US299-0101 and GS-US-311-0101 of TAF in various combination drug 
formulations, indicated that TAF exposure associated with potent antiviral activity were achieved with the 
D/C/F/TAF 10 mg (monolayer formulation) and TFV exposures with this formulation were in the range of 
historical data with TAF 25 mg dosed alone or with another combination product, elvitegravir (EVG)/C/F/TAF 10 
mg. Moreover, administration of D/C/F/TAF 10 mg resulted in ~90% lower steady-state TFV exposure versus 
DRV/co plus F/TDF. Exposures of DRV/COBI and FTC were comparable when administered as an FDC or as 
individual components. Study GS-US-299-0101 also showed that the relative bioavailability of DRV, COBI, FTC, 
and TFV when administered as DRV/co plus F/TDF was similar relative to that when administered as individual 
components.  
The proposed indication for the D/C/F/TAF FDC is for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
(HIV 1) infection in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg).

Subjects were treated for 48 weeks. After Week 48, subjects continued to take blinded study drug and attend 
visits every 12 weeks until treatment assignments were unblinded, at which point all subjects returned for an 
Unblinding Visit, when the current study was terminated. If still receiving study drug at that point, subjects were

given the option to participate in the open-label rollover extension phase of Study GS-US-292-0102 and to 
receive the E/C/F/TAF FDC until it becomes commercially available, or until Gilead Sciences elects to terminate 
the development of the E/C/F/TAF FDC. Subjects who completed the study and did not wish to participate in or 
were ineligible for the Study GS-US-292-0102 open-label rollover extension were required to return to the clinic 
30 days after the completion of study drugs for a 30-day Follow-up Visit. 
a Screening window was extended to 42 days for subjects who required repeat testing of HIV-1 genotype. 
b Following the Baseline visit, subjects returned for study visits at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and then every 8 weeks through Week 48. 
c An external Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) reviewed the progress, efficacy, and safety profile of the study regimens while the study was ongoing. 
The committee convened after the last subjects enrolled completed Week 12 of the study. 
d Subjects continued to attend visits every 12 weeks following Week 48 until treatment assignment was unblinded. 
e Once Gilead Sciences provided unblinded treatment assignments to the Investigators, all subjects returned to the clinic within 30 days (+6 days) for an Unblinding 
Visit. At the Unblinding Visit all subjects discontinued blinded study drugs and were given an option to participate in the Study GS-US-292-0102 open-label rollover 
extension. Subjects who did not wish to participate in the open-label rollover extension discontinued blinded study drugs and returned for a 30-day Follow-up visit 
following the Unblinding Visit. 
f Subjects who discontinued study drug prior to the Unblinding Visit were not eligible for the open label rollover extension; these subjects discontinued the study after 
the Unblinding Visit. 
Figure 6.  Study schema 
Study Participants  
Subjects enrolled were ART-naïve, HIV-1 infected adult subjects (>18 years of age) who had plasma HIV-1 RNA 
≥5,000 copies/mL, a CD4+ cell count >50 cells/µL, an HIV-1 genotype showing sensitivity to DRV, TDF and FTC, 
and an eGFRCG of ≥70 mL/min. Subjects were excluded if they were hepatitis B or C co-infected, had a new 
AIDS-defining condition within 30 days of screening, or were pregnant. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the following 2 treatment arms: 
• 
• 
Treatment Arm 1: FDC tablet of DRV 800 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 10 mg + placebos to match 
DRV 800 mg (400mg tablet x 2) and COBI 150 mg tablet and FDC tablet FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg once 
daily (5 tablets in total) 
Treatment Arm 2: DRV 800 mg (400 mg tablet x 2) + COBI 150 mg tablet + FDC tablet FTC 200 mg/TDF 
300 mg + placebos to match an FDC tablet of DRV 800 mg/COBI 150 mg/FTC 200 mg/TAF 10 mg once 
daily (5 tablets in total) 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017

Randomization was stratified by HIV-1 RNA level (≤ 100,000 or > 100,000 copies/mL) and race (black or 
non-black) at screening. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was: 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of a regimen containing D/C/F/TAF versus DRV+COBI+TVD in HIV-1 infected, 
ART-naive adult subjects, as determined by the achievement of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24. 
The secondary objectives of this study were as follows: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the efficacy of a regimen containing D/C/F/TAF versus DRV+COBI+TVD in HIV-1 infected, 
ART-naive adult subjects, as determined by the achievement of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48. 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the 2 treatment regimens through 48 weeks of treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 24 
as defined by the FDA snapshot analysis algorithm. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percentage of 
subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 as defined by the snapshot analysis algorithm, the change 
from baseline in log10 HIV-1 RNA and in CD4+ cell count at Weeks 24 and 48. 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAF, tenofovir (TFV), DRV, COBI, and FTC was assessed for all subjects who 
participated in an intensive PK substudy, which included a subset of subjects who were randomized in the 
double-blind phase, received at least 1 dose of study drug, and for whom steady-state PK parameters of any of 
the 5 analytes were evaluable. Additionally, at substudy sites that could perform peripheral blood mononuclear 
cell (PBMC) processing, the PK of tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP) was assessed. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
estimated in the substudy included Cmax, Tmax, Ctau, AUCtau, and t½. For all subjects, a single trough (pre-dose) 
PK blood sample was to be collected 20-24 hours following an observed (in-clinic) dose of 
DRV/COBI/FTC/GS-7340 STR or DRV+COBI+FTC/TDF at Weeks 8, 24, and 48. In addition, a single PK blood 
sample was collected at Weeks 2, 4, 12, 16, 32, and 40. Concentrations of study drugs were determined. 
Safety endpoints were Adverse events (AEs) and clinical laboratory tests, including bone mineral density (BMD) 
using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bone biomarkers (C-type collagen sequence [CTx] and 
procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide [P1NP]), serum creatinine, eGFR by 3 formulae (eGFRCG, Chronic 
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] creatinine [eGFRCKD-EPI, creatinine] and cystatin C 
[eGFRCKD-EPI, cysC]), and renal biomarkers (urine retinol-binding protein [RBP], beta-2-microglobulin, RBP to 
creatinine ratio, beta-2-microglobulin to creatinine ratio, urine protein to creatinine ratio [UPCR], and urine 
albumin to creatinine ratio [UACR]) were performed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment 
regimens. 
Sample size 
A sample size of 100 subjects in the single-tablet regimen (D/C/F/TAF) group was chosen to estimate the 
response rate of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 for the regimen to allow for the planning of Phase 3 
studies. A total sample size of 150 subjects had 56% power to evaluate non-inferiority with respect to the 
response rate of HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 if a response rate of 88% for both groups and a 
non-inferiority margin of 0.12 were assumed. 
The total sample size of 150 subjects provided 43% power to observe a smaller decrease of 1% with a standard 
deviation (SD) of 3.2% in hip BMD in the D/C/F/TAF group relative to the DRV+COBI+TVD group.

EMA/496527/2017 
Page 63/106 
  
  
Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified by HIV 1 RNA level (≤ 100,000 or > 100,000 copies/mL) at screening and race 
(black or non-black) based on data submitted in the IVRS/IWRS by the Investigator. 
Blinding  
The IVRS/IWRS assigned blinded study drug bottle numbers at each study visit. Study drugs were dispensed to 
the subject in a blinded fashion. All baseline tests and procedures were completed prior to the administration of 
the first dose of study drug. Initiation of treatment with the study drugs took place within 24 hours after the 
baseline visit. 
In the event of a medical emergency where breaking of the blind was being considered by the treating physician, 
the Investigator could request unblinding by contacting the Gilead Medical Monitor. The treatment assignment 
was not unblinded if unblinding would not have affected the way the subject would be treated. If the Gilead 
Medical Monitor granted the unblinding, then any broken blinding code was clearly justified and explained by a 
comment in the source documentation and on the electronic case report form, along with the date on which the 
code was broken and the identity of the person authorizing the unblinding. 
Gilead Sciences Drug Safety Public Health (DSPH) could independently unblind cases for expedited reporting of 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs). In addition to the above stated prespecified 
situations requiring unblinding, an unplanned, inadvertent unblinding of all study sites occurred on 13 June 
2013, after the Week 24 interim analyses and before the planned Week 48 analyses and the Unblinding Visit. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieved HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 24 
as defined by the FDA snapshot analysis algorithm. Virologic outcome was categorized as virologic success, 
virologic failure, or no virologic data in the Week 24 analysis window. The number and percentage of subjects 
having virologic success, virologic failure, and the reasons for no virologic data at Week 24 were summarized. 
The analysis purpose of the primary efficacy endpoint was to assess the non-inferiority of the treatment with 
D/C/F/TAF relative to the treatment with DRV+COBI+TVD. Non-inferiority was assessed using a conventional 
95% CI approach, with a non-inferiority margin of 12%. Non-inferiority was concluded if the lower bound of the 
2-sided 95% CI of the difference (D/C/F/TAF - DRV+COBI+TVD) in the response rate was > -12%. The primary 
analysis used the FAS and a secondary analysis used the PP analysis set. 
The baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum (≤ 100,000 or >100,000 copies/mL) - and race stratum (black or nonblack) - 
weighted difference in the response rate (P1 –  P2) and its 95% CI was calculated based on stratum-adjusted 
Mantel-Haenszel proportion. 
If non-inferiority of D/C/F/TAF versus DRV+COBI+TVD was established, the same 95% CI used in evaluating 
non-inferiority was to be used to evaluate superiority. If the lower bound of the 95% CI was greater than 0, then 
superiority of D/C/F/TAF over DRV+COBI+TVD would be established. The baseline HIV-1 RNA and race stratum 
stratified 2-sided CMH test would also be used to assess superiority as a secondary assessment. The FAS would 
be used for the superiority evaluation. 
The analyses for all the secondary efficacy endpoints were conducted using the FAS and the endpoint related to 
the virologic response at Week 48 was also analysed using the PP analysis set. The same statistical method 
applied for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was used for the analysis of all the secondary endpoints 
involving percentages. Alpha level of 0.05 was used to construct the 95% CIs.

Conduct of the study 
The original study protocol (dated 27 February 2012) was amended once (dated 06 June 2012) and 6 
administrative letters (dated between 29 February 2012 and 02 December 2013) were issued; all except the 
first 2 administrative letters were issued after subject screening was initiated. 
In addition, an inadvertent study unblinding occurred on 13 June 2013, after the study had reached the Week 24 
primary efficacy endpoint and analyses had already been conducted but before the planned Week 48 analyses 
and the Unblinding Visit. The unblinding event and subsequent actions are described in an accidental study site 
unblinding letter to investigators on 17 June 2013. Finally, the study was terminated following the Unblinding 
Visit (or 30-day Follow-up Visit, if applicable). Instead of participation in the current study’s open-label rollover 
extension phase, subjects were given the option to participate in the open-label rollover extension phase of 
Study GS-US-292-0102 to receive the FDC tablet E/C/F/TAF. This change in study procedures was described in 
a study termination letter and accompanying documentation to investigators on 10 October 2013. 
Important changes to the study design implemented in Amendment 1 were: 
• 
Specific and additional information pertaining to the disallowed/discouraged medications was provided. 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 66/106 
  
  
 
 
• 
• 
Protocol and DXA visit windows at Weeks 24 and 48 were expanded. 
Adverse event/reaction reporting requirements were updated in accordance with the European Union 
CT3 regulation. 
A total of 52 important protocol deviations occurred in 35 subjects during the study. Of those 35 subjects with 
important protocol deviations reported, 21 subjects were in the D/C/F/TAF group and 14 subjects were in the 
DRV+COBI+TVD group. 
The most common important protocol deviations were associated with incorrect dispensing or dosing of study 
drug. None of these important deviations affected the overall interpretation of the study data. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and general baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups (Table 12). The 
majority of subjects were male (92.8%), and the mean age was 35 years (range, 18 to 68 years). The most 
common races were white (60.1%) or black (34.6%) and the most common ethnicity was not Hispanic/Latino 
(79.1%). The mean (SD) value for BMI at baseline was 26.2 (4.81) kg/m2.

Baseline disease characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups (Table 13). The mean (SD) 
baseline HIV-1 RNA value was 4.68 (0.515) log10 copies/mL, CD4 count was 417 (205.7) cells/µL, and CD4% 
was 23.7 (8.81). Overall, 80.4% of the subjects had baseline HIV 1 RNA ≤ 100,000 copies/mL, 14.4% had > 
100,000 to ≤ 400,000 copies/mL, and 5.2% had > 400,000 copies/mL. The most common HIV risk factor 
category was homosexual sex (84.3% of subjects). The majority of subjects (89.5%) had asymptomatic HIV-1 
infection; 7.2% of subjects had symptomatic HIV-1 infection, and 3.3% of subjects were diagnosed with AIDS. 
Values for eGFR (as measured by CG) were similar between the 2 treatment groups. Most subjects (90.2%) had 
no or trace proteinuria (Grade 0 by dipstick) on urinalysis.

The denominator for percentages is based on the number of subjects in the safety analysis set. 
For categorical data, p-value was from the CMH test (general association statistic was used for nominal data, row mean scores differ statistics was used for ordinal data). 
For continuous data, p-value was from the 2-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
A subject may fit more than 1 HIV risk factor category; therefore, percentages may add to more than 100. 
Numbers analysed 
Overall, 153 subjects (D/C/F/TAF: 103 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD: 50 subjects) who were randomized and 
received at least 1 dose of treatment were included in the safety analysis set and FAS. A total of 21 subjects 
(D/C/F/TAF: 17 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD: 4 subjects) were excluded from the Week 48 PP analysis set for 
reasons other than lack of efficacy and 3 subjects were excluded from the Week 48 PP analysis set due to poor 
adherence (Table 14). 
A total of 133 subjects (D/C/F/TAF: 85 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD: 48 subjects) were included in the hip DXA 
analysis set and 134 subjects (D/C/F/TAF: 86 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD: 48 subjects) were included in the 
spine DXA analysis set. 
Overall, 32 subjects (D/C/F/TAF: 21 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD: 11 subjects) were included in the analysis set 
for the intensive PK substudy.

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 24 using 
the FDA-defined snapshot algorithm. 
Virologic outcomes at Week 24 were similar between the 2 treatment groups for the primary endpoint analysis 
for the FAS (Table 15). Virologic success rates were as follows: D/C/F/TAF 74.8%, DRV+COBI+TVD 74.0%; 
difference in percentages: 3.3%, 95% CI -11.4% to 18.1%. Because the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI of 
the difference in the response rate (D/C/F/TAF – DRV+COBI+TVD) was greater than the pre-specified –12% 
non-inferiority margin, D/C/F/TAF was determined to be non-inferior to DRV+COBI+TVD. 
Percentages of subjects with virologic failure at Week 24 (and reasons for failure) were similar for the 2 
treatment groups (D/C/F/TAF 20.4%, DRV+COBI+TVD 24.0%). 
Virologic success rates at Week 24 were similar between treatment groups using the Week 24 PP analysis set, 
as follows: D/C/F/TAF 84.6%, 77 of 91 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 78.7%, 37 of 47 subjects; difference in 
percentages: 8.3%, 95% CI: -5.3% to 22.0%.

a P-value for the superiority test comparing the percentages of virologic success was from the CMH test stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA and race strata. 
b Difference in percentages of virologic success and its 95% CI were calculated based on baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum-adjusted MH proportion. 
c Week 24 window was between Day 140 and 195 (inclusive). 
d Discontinuation due to other reasons included subjects who discontinued study drug due to investigator's discretion, withdrew consent, lost to follow-up, subject 
noncompliance, protocol violation, pregnancy, and study discontinued by sponsor. 
In contrast, the virologic success rates through Week 48 were lower for D/C/F/TAF vs. DRV+COBI+TVD (Table 
16), which reflected numbers that discontinued study drug and had a last available HIV-1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL 
(D/C/F/TAF: 8.7%, 9 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD: 4.0%, 2 subjects). Percentages with documented virologic 
failure at Week 48 were more comparable (6.8% vs. 8%).

a P-value for the superiority test comparing the percentages of virologic success was from the CMH test stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA and race strata. 
b Difference in percentages of virologic success and its 95% CI were calculated based on baseline HIV-1 RNA stratum-adjusted MH proportion. 
c Week 48 window was between Day 308 and 337 (inclusive). 
d Discontinuation due to other reasons included subjects who discontinued study drug due to investigator's discretion, withdrew consent, lost to follow-up, subject 
noncompliance, protocol violation, pregnancy, and study discontinued by sponsor. 
In the Week 48 PP analysis set the virologic success rates were D/C/F/TAF 92.9% (79/85) vs. DRV+COBI+TVD 
91.3% (42/46); difference 2.4%, 95% CI: -8.8% to 13.7%. Other approaches to analysis of the FAS gave 
generally similar results to the primary analysis and also applied to the PP sets. 
A pure virologic response (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL on 2 consecutive visits) through Week 48 was observed 
for D/C/F/TAF 81.6% (84/103) vs. DRV+COBI+TVD 86.0% (43/50). Similar percentages in each treatment 
group did not achieve confirmed suppression (15% vs. 12%). At Week 48, the KM estimates for the percentages 
with pure virologic failure (PVF) were 18% in the D/C/F/TAF group and 14% in the DRV+COBI+TVD group 
(overall p-value = 0.89). 
CD4 cell counts increased for each treatment group with mean increases through Week 24 (observed data) 
using the FAS of D/C/F/TAF 186 (137.9) cells/μL vs. DRV+COBI+TVD 139 (185.8) cells/μL.  
CD4 cell counts increased for each treatment group with mean increases through Week 48 (observed data) 
using the FAS of D/C/F/TAF 231 (141.9) cells/μL vs. DRV+COBI+TVD 212 (151.5) cells/μL. The CD4% also 
increased in each treatment group with mean increases from baseline at Week 48 of D/C/F/TAF 8.2% vs. 
DRV+COBI+TVD 9.3%.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No specific clinical study was performed with the D/C/F/TAF FDC in special populations, all available data derives 
from data generated with the separate components. 
Subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment 
The use of D/C/F/TAF in subjects with renal impairment is similar to what is recommended for Genvoya, which 
is No dose adjustment of […] is required in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the 
Cockcroft-Gault formula (eGFRCG) ≥ 30 mL/min, and mainly relies on data from Studies GS-US-236-0118 and 
GS-US-292-0112. Data available from these studies indicate that the overall efficacy profile in subjects with mild 
to moderate renal impairment was similar to that observed in the adult population with normal renal function. 
Although the additional POPPK data in study GS-US-292-0112 demonstrated a difference in FTC AUCs for 
patients with eGFR CG, >50 vs. < 50 mL/min, the available safety data supported the use of E/C/F/TAF down to 
CrCL 30 mL/min. 
Subjects with hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the PK of DRV, COBI, FTC and TAF when coadministered as the D/C/F/TAF 
FDC has not been evaluated. The information provided in the current application is based on data derived during 
the development programs of the individual components. Based on the PK, efficacy and safety data for the 
individual components, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate 
(Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. However, D/C/F/TAF should be used with caution in these patients due 
to the increase in unbound DRV plasma concentrations. The D/C/F/TAF FDC or its components have not been 
studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), therefore, the D/C/F/TAF FDC must not 
be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
Adolescents 
The proposed use of the D/C/F/TAF FDC in adolescents is based on the results of studies TMC114-C230 and 
GS-US-292-0106, in which the D/C/F/TAF components studied showed similar exposures in adolescents and 
adults, the boosting effect of COBI was shown to be the same in adolescents and adults, and regimens were 
shown to be safe and efficacious in adolescents. As such, doses of DRV 800 mg, COBI 150 mg, FTC 200 mg and 
TAF 10 mg are each approved for use in adolescents, in different combinations. Therefore, the D/C/F/TAF FDC, 
combining these components at their respective doses approved for use in adolescents, is considered to be 
appropriate for use in adolescents, aged ≥12 years and weighing at least 40 kg.

Elderly 
Use in Elderly patients is listed as missing information in the RMP as there is hardly any data available in patients 
>65 years of age, and no data at all in patients >68 years of age. 
HIV and HBV/HCV co-infection 
No specific clinical study was performed with the D/C/F/TAF FDC in subjects co-infected with HIV and HBV 
and/or HCV and HIV/HBV-co-infected subjects were excluded from the Phase 2 study with the D/C/F/TAF FDC 
(GS-US-299-0102). The applicant submitted a Phase 3b open-label F/TAF study (GS-US-292-1249) 
investigating the efficacy and safety of Genvoya in HIV-1/HBV co-infected adult subjects. Virological outcome 
data from Cohort 2 (enrolling HIV/HBV co-infected adults who were HIV suppressed (with or without 
suppression of HBV DNA)) for both HIV and HBV, seem to be in line with previous results in mono-infected 
patients. As it is a non-comparative study, no firm conclusions can - be drawn. The SmPC states in section 4.4 
that Tenofovir alafenamide is active against hepatitis B virus (HBV). 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Based on PK bridging, clinical evidence to support the efficacy and resistance profile of D/C/F/TAF is provided by 
ten Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies with DRV/COBI, F/TAF (either as E/C/F/TAF FDC or as F/TAF FDC+3rd agent) 
or D/C/F/TAF and are presented in this summary. For DRV/COBI, the efficacy and resistance profile is bridged to 
DRV/rtv, based on the similar PK of DRV using rtv or COBI as pharmacoenhancer. For F/TAF, pooled data of the 
Phase 3 pivotal studies with E/C/F/TAF in ART-naïve subjects are discussed. Key efficacy results across studies 
are provided in Table 17.

Supportive studies  
Efficacy of DRV/COBI 
Information on the efficacy of DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily in combination with other ARVs in HIV-1 
infected adults is provided by the results of Study GS-US-216-0130. This was a Phase 3b, open-label, 
single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a regimen of DRV 800 mg and COBI 150 mg 
once daily, together with 2 fully active NRTIs in HIV-1 infected (plasma HIV-1 RNA levels ≥1,000 copies/mL at 
screening), ART-naïve (no prior use of ARV drugs for any length of time) or ART-experienced (stable ARV 
treatment for at least 12 weeks prior to screening) adult subjects with no DRV RAMs. 
Overall, virologic success at Week 24 and at Week 48 (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL, FDA defined snapshot 
analysis algorithm) was achieved in 82.4% (258 of 313 subjects) and 80.8% (253 of 313 subjects), 
respectively, and virologic failure was reported in 11.5% (36 of 313 subjects) and 10.5% (33 of 313 subjects), 
respectively. 
In the ART-naïve cohort, virologic success at Week 24 (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL, FDA-defined snapshot 
analysis algorithm) was achieved in 83.7% (247 of 295 subjects), and virologic failure was reported in 9.8% (29 
of 295 subjects). In the ART-experienced cohort, virologic success at Week 24 was achieved in 61.1% (11 of 18 
subjects), and virologic failure was reported for 38.9% (7 of 18 subjects). 
In the ART-naïve cohort, virologic success at Week 48 (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL, FDA-defined snapshot 
analysis algorithm) was achieved in 82.7% (244 of 295 subjects), virologic failure was reported in 8.1% (24 of 
295 subjects). In the ART-experienced cohort, virologic success at Week 48 was achieved in 50.0% (9 of 18 
subjects), and virologic failure was reported for 50.0% (9 of 18 subjects). 
No subgroup analysis, besides analysis of viral outcomes by baseline viral load, was performed in Study 
GS-US-216-0130. No differences in virologic success were observed by baseline viral load.

Overall,  the  response  to  DRV/cobi  can  be  considered  comparable  to  DRV/rtv,  however  such  cross-study 
comparisons should always be viewed with caution. 
Efficacy of F/TAF 
In two Phase 3 studies in ART-naïve subjects (GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111), E/C/F/TAF was 
shown to be non-inferior to E/C/F/TDF (92% vs 90% for pooled data). At Week 48, the difference (95% CI) in 
virologic response (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) between E/C/F/TAF and the control group was 2.0% (-0.7 to 4.7) 
in a model adjusted for baseline factors. The PK/PD analysis of these pooled studies indicated that virologic 
response was uniformly high across TAF AUCtau quartiles (96.3%, 92.6%, 94.8% and 91.9% in Q1 through Q4) 
with no trends in exposure response relationship across the wide range of TAF exposures observed.  
In virologically suppressed subjects who switched from an F/TDF-containing regimen to a regimen containing 
the F/TAF FDC plus a third agent (Study GS-US-311-1089), F/TAF was non-inferior to F/TDF. At Week 48, the 
difference (95% CI) in virologic response (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) between F/TAF and the control group was 
1.3% (-2.5 to 5.1). Virologic response rates were similar across the range of third agents used and did not 
suggest any clinically relevant differences. The results of the PK/PD analysis for Study GS-US-311-1089 are in 
line with observations in the E/C/F/TAF studies and show that virologic response rates were similar across the 
AUCtau quartiles (93.2%, 95.9%, 97.3% and 95.9% in Q1 through Q4), with no trends in exposure-response 
relationship across the wide range of TAF exposures observed. This again indicates an absence of PK/PD 
relationship for TAF, as was demonstrated in the E/C/F/TAF Phase 3 studies. 
The overall conclusion was that E/C/F/TAF has been shown to achieve high virologic suppression rates in 
ART-naïve patients and supports maintenance of suppression after switching from successful regimens. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The development program for the D/C/F/TAF FDC is primarily based on a pharmacokinetic bridging program. 
This is acceptable for a dossier submitted in accordance with article 10 (b) of Directive 2001/83/EC. In addition, 
a single Phase 2 Study (GS-US-299-0102) that investigated efficacy and safety of the to be marketed 
formulation, was provided. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The Phase 2 Study GS-US-299-0102 in ART naïve subjects was an exploratory study to estimate the relative 
efficacy and safety without the objective to demonstrate non-inferiority. According to the applicant, the sample 
size for study GS-US-299-0102 was initially chosen to estimate the response rate in order to subsequently plan 
for Phase 3 studies. This resulted in a low power to evaluate non-inferiority, which is unfortunate (but not 
considered an issue, due to the PK bridging) as it is the only clinical efficacy data provided. Of note, Phase 3 
studies are ongoing and primary analyses of both studies, ie, when all subjects have been treated for 48 weeks 
(or discontinued earlier), were planned for Q2 2017. While these studies will provide additional information 
regarding the D/C/F/TAF regimen (including adherence information), the Applicant did not consider these 
studies to be pivotal for this application, given the approved indication for F/TAF, which includes use in 
combination with DRV/COBI. The CHMP considered this approach acceptable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 153 subjects were enrolled in the study, 103 of which were treated with D/C/F/TAF. There were only 
few females included, and hardly any elderly patients. Elderly patients is considered missing information. Only 
limited numbers of subjects with baseline viral load >100.000 copies/mL were included (19.6%), with only few 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 80/106 
  
  
subjects having baseline viral load >400.000 copies/mL (5.2%). The far majority of subjects (97.4 %, 149 of 
153) had HIV-1 subtype B.  
Based on the primary analysis it was concluded that D/C/F/TAF is non-inferior to DRV+COBI+TVD. However, the 
analysis of the Week 48 data seems to indicate a lower overall virologic success rate for D/C/F/TAF vs. 
DRV+COBI+TVD. This was already noted during the MAA procedure for F/TAF (Descovy) where Study 
GS-US-299-0102 was also part of the application. It was concluded that “this relatively small study was not 
powered for inferential testing […] and the findings of this study are currently unexplained.”  
The main reason is that the difference was due to an imbalance in the fraction of subjects that discontinued the 
study due to reasons other than lack of efficacy (who were excluded from the PP analysis set between the 
groups), with 20/103 (19.4%) subjects excluded in the D/C/F/TAF arm vs 4/50 (8%) in the DRV+COBI+TVD 
arm. The applicant claimed that, given the randomized and double-blinded study nature, there are no 
indications that there was a systematic non-safety drug-related reason for the higher discontinuation rate in the 
D/C/F/TAF group.  
Special populations 
No specific clinical study was performed with the D/C/F/TAF FDC in subjects with mild to moderate or severe 
renal impairment. However, data available for the components of D/C/F/TAF indicate that the overall efficacy 
profile in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment was similar to that observed in the adult population 
with normal renal function. The SmPC states that no dose adjustment is required in patients with eGFRCG ≥ 30 
mL/min.  
The single agents are each approved for use in adolescents aged ≥12 years and weighing at least 40 kg. It is 
therefore accepted that the FDC is indicated for use in adolescents aged ≥12 years and weighing at least 40 kg 
and adults. 
No specific clinical study was performed with the D/C/F/TAF FDC in subjects co-infected with HIV and HBV 
and/or HCV and HIV/HBV-co-infected subjects were excluded from the Phase 2 study with the D/C/F/TAF FDC 
(GS-US-299-0102). The applicant submitted a Phase 3b open-label F/TAF study (GS-US-292-1249) 
investigating the efficacy and safety of Genvoya in HIV-1/HBV co-infected adult subjects. Virological outcome 
data in this study, for both HIV and HBV, seems to be in line with previous results in mono-infected patients.  
Integrated virology analyses 
Development of resistance-associated mutations seems to occur quite rarely when treated with the combined 
use of the single agents. Although resistance is rare, the RMP adequately reflect this concern. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
There are no major objections based on the efficacy data. The separate components of the D/C/F/TAF fixed dose 
combination are already approved, also for use with specific combination. Bioequivalence of the FDC to the 
separate components has been established. A non-inferior efficacy of D/C/F/TAF vs DRV+COBI+TVD has been 
shown in the phase 2 study, although a higher than expected discontinuation rate was observed in the 
D/C/F/TAF group. Preliminary results from the ongoing phase 3 studies are reassuring in this respect.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The main focus of this section will be on the description of the safety as reported in Study GS-US-299-0102, as 
this is the only study in the target population with the to be marketed formulation of the medicinal product and 
the main basis for section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
The D/C/F/TAF Phase 1 studies involving 270 healthy subjects (of which 231 subjects received the D/C/F/TAF 
FDC; Studies TMC114FD2HTX1001, TMC114FD2HTX1002, and GS-US-299-0101) provide further supportive 
evidence of the safety profile of D/C/F/TAF. In addition, two Phase 3 studies with the D/C/F/TAF FDC in 725 
ART-naïve (TMC114FD2HTX3001) and in 1,149 virologically suppressed (TMC114IFD3013) HIV-1 infected 
subjects are ongoing (primary analyses for both trials read, i.e., when all subjects have been treated for 48 
weeks or discontinued earlier). 
Patient exposure 
Study GS-US-299-0102 was a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of the D/C/F/TAF FDC vs COBI-boosted DRV (DRV+COBI) +F/TDF FDC in 153 
HIV-1 infected treatment-naïve adult subjects (103 subjects in the D/C/F/TAF FDC group; 50 subjects in the 
DRV+COBI+F/TDF group). The median duration of study drug exposure was 68.0 weeks. 
The relevant clinical studies supporting the DRV/COBI, the F/TAF and hence the D/C/F/TAF efficacy, safety, and 
resistance profile in total enrolled or randomized 3,674 subjects, of whom: 
•  335 adult subjects received at least 1 dose of DRV/COBI, 
•  1,797 adult subjects and 50 adolescents received at least 1 dose of E/C/F/TAF. 
•  103 adult subjects received at least 1 dose of D/C/F/TAF. 
Adverse events 
A summary of AEs observed in Study GS-US-299-0102 is provided in Table 19. No subjects died during the 
study. Similar percentages of subjects in each group had any AE (D/C/F/TAF: 92.2%, 95 subjects; 
DRV+COBI+TVD: 94.0%, 47 subjects) or any AE considered by the investigator to be related to study drug 
(D/C/F/TAF 41.7%, 43 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 38.0%, 19 subjects). Any Grade 3 or 4 AE was reported for 
6.8% of subjects (n = 7) in the D/C/F/TAF group, and 8.0% of subjects (n = 4) in the DRV+COBI+TVD group. 
Any SAE was reported for 4.9% of subjects (n = 5) in the D/C/F/TAF group and 4.0% of subjects (n = 2) in the 
DRV+COBI+TVD group. 
Any Grade 2, 3, or 4 AE was reported for 55.3% of subjects (n = 57) in the D/C/F/TAF group, and 48.0% of 
subjects (n = 24) in the DRV+COBI+TVD group. Any Grade 2, 3, or 4 AE considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug was reported for 9.7% of subjects (n = 10) in the D/C/F/TAF group and 6.0% of subjects 
(n = 3) in the DRV+COBI+TVD group. 
One subject in each treatment group had a Grade 3 or 4 AE considered by the investigator to be related to study 
drug. Two subjects (1.9%) in the D/C/F/TAF group and 2 subjects (4.0%) in the DRV+COBI+TVD group had any 
AE leading to premature study drug discontinuation. In the D/C/F/TAF group, 1 subject discontinued study drug 
due to an SAE of substance abuse, and the other discontinued study drug due to a study drug-related SAE of 
hypersensitivity and a study drug-related non-serious AE of rash. In the DRV+COBI+TVD group, 1 subject 
Assessment report

discontinued study drug due to an SAE of renal tubular disorder (reported as proximal renal tubulopathy [PRT]), 
and the other subject discontinued study drug due to a study drug-related non-serious AE of worsening of 
diarrhoea. Two subjects in the D/C/F/TAF group had Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Class C AIDS-defining 
events; one non-serious Kaposi’s sarcoma and one non-serious HIV wasting syndrome. One subject in the 
DRV+COBI+TVD group had a CDC Class C AIDS-defining event of non-serious Kaposi’s sarcoma.

Adverse events that occurred in ≥5% of subjects are presented in Table 20. Common AEs were consistent with 
those expected in the subject population and the known safety profiles of the study drugs. The AEs by PT 
reported for ≥10% of subjects in either treatment group were as follows: 
•  D/C/F/TAF group — diarrhoea (21.4%, 22 subjects); upper respiratory tract infection (15.5%, 16 
subjects); fatigue (13.6%, 14 subjects); nausea (12.6%, 13 subjects); and rash (11.7%, 12 subjects) 
•  DRV+COBI+TVD group — diarrhoea (26.0%, 13 subjects); fatigue (18.0%, 9 subjects); upper 
respiratory tract infection (14.0%, 7 subjects); flatulence (12.0%, 6 subjects); and nausea, pain in 
extremity, vitamin D deficiency, and vomiting (each in 10.0%, 5 subjects)

Similar percentages of subjects in each group had any AE considered by the investigator to be related to study 
drug (D/C/F/TAF 41.7%, 43 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 38.0%, 19 subjects). The most commonly reported AEs 
considered related to the study drugs by the investigator by PT were as follows: diarrhoea (D/C/F/TAF 13.6%, 
14 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 14.0%, 7 subjects), flatulence (D/C/F/TAF 3.9%, 4 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 
10.0%, 5 subjects), nausea (D/C/F/TAF 9.7%, 10 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 6.0%, 3 subjects), and fatigue

Table 22.  Events and Parameters of Special Interest for D/C/F/TAF – Study GS-US-299-0102 
Renal safety 
D/C/F/TAF showed a better renal safety profile compared to subjects who received DRV+COBI+F/TDF, as 
evidenced by significantly less reduction in eGFR (Figure 9) and less tubular proteinuria was observed. There 
were no cases of PRT (including Fanconi syndrome) reported in HIV-1 infected subjects receiving D/C/F/TAF; 1 
case was reported in the DRV+COBI+F/TDF group. Increases from baseline in mean values for serum creatinine 
were smaller in the D/C/F/TAF group compared with the DRV+COBI+F/TDF group. Cobicistat increases serum 
creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function as 
assessed, for instance, by using cystatin C as filtration marker. In the Phase 2 Study GS-US-299-0102 in 
treatment-naïve subjects, increases in serum creatinine and concomitant changes in eGFRC occurred by Week 
2 of treatment and remained stable through 48 weeks. Changes from baseline with D/C/F/TAF were smaller than

with DRV+COBI+F/TDF. No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 treatment groups 
in median percentage change from baseline in UPCR or UACR at Week 48. There were statistically significant 
differences between the treatment groups, favouring D/C/F/TAF, in change from baseline in RBP to creatinine 
and β2-microglobulin to creatinine ratios.

Bone safety 
At Week 48, subjects receiving D/C/F/TAF experienced less decline in BMD than those receiving 
DRV+COBI+F/TDF. A smaller proportion of subjects in the D/C/F/TAF group compared with those of the 
DRV+COBI+F/TDF group had a clinically significant (>3%) decrease from baseline in hip BMD (18.3% vs 
61.7%) and in spine BMD (32.5% vs 55.3%). Increases from baseline in the bone turnover biomarkers type I 
collagen C-telopeptide (a bone resorption biomarker) and P1NP (a bone formation biomarker), as well as PTH (a 
hormone involved in bone metabolism) were smaller in the D/C/F/TAF group compared with the 
DRV+COBI+F/TDF group at both Weeks 24 and 48.

Fasting lipid parameters 
Increases (median) from baseline were observed in both the TAF- and TDF-containing treatment groups for the 
fasting lipid parameters total cholesterol, direct LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides at Weeks 24 and 48, 
with the exception of a decrease in fasting triglycerides at Week 48 for the DRV+COBI+F/TDF group. The 
median increase from baseline was greater in the D/C/F/TAF group compared with the DRV+COBI+F/TDF group 
at both Week 24 and Week 48. Statistically significant differences between the 2 groups in change from baseline 
were seen for fasting total cholesterol and fasting direct LDL cholesterol at Week 24 (p=0.014 for the difference 
between treatment groups for total cholesterol, p=0.004 for direct LDL cholesterol, p=0.35 for HDL cholesterol, 
and p=0.13 for triglycerides), and for all 4 lipid parameters at Week 48 (p<0.001 for the difference between 
treatment groups for total cholesterol and direct LDL cholesterol, p=0.009 for HDL cholesterol, and p=0.007 for 
triglycerides). There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline for either treatment group or statistically 
significant differences in changes from baseline between treatment groups for median fasting total cholesterol 
to HDL ratio. Lipid abnormalities is listed as an identified risk in the EU-RMP for D/C/F/TAF, which is supported. 
The company was requested to further discuss the impact of TAF vs TDF use may have on cardiovascular risk 
especially in adolescents, taking into account that receiving PI therapy in the age range of 10 to 15 years (the 
years of pubertal development) already seems to be significantly associated with the development of 
dyslipidaemia (Taylor et al., Pediatrics. 2004; 114: e235-242). The applicant argued that the TC/HDL ratio is 
providing the most relevant information and concluded, based on studies GS-US-292-0104, GS-US-292-0111, 
GS-US-292-0106, and TMC114-C230, that the changes in TC/HDL ratio are minimal in both adults and 
adolescents. The Applicant “expects that the changes in individual fasting lipid parameters and TC/HDL after 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 89/106 
  
  
 
 
administration of D/C/F/TAF in adolescents will lie between the changes observed in study TMC114-C230 (as a 
proxy for the effects of DRV in the absence of the lipid-protective effects of TDF) and in study GS-US-292-0106 
(as a proxy for the effects in the presence of TAF, having less lipid-protective effects than TDF).” This 
expectation is reasonable. The effect of D/C/F/TAF on lipids is reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC to enable the 
prescriber to take this effect into consideration while considering the available treatment options, and the 
revised EU-RMP for D/C/F/TAF has been updated regarding current knowledge on this topic. 
Other observations related to safety 
Six subjects (5.8%) receiving D/C/F/TAF had non serious AEs in the Eye Disorders SOC compared with none of 
the subjects in the DRV+COBI+F/TDF group; preferred term (PT) included dry eye, ocular hyperaemia, eye 
irritation, lacrimation increased, eye pruritus, and photophobia. No AEs of uveitis were reported during the 
study. One (1.0%) subject in the D/C/F/TAF group presented a photophobia. The event, considered related to 
the study drug by the investigator, was non serious. No eye disorder resulted in discontinuation of study drugs. 
There were no clinically significant ECG findings reported for any subjects during the study and there were no 
clinically relevant changes from baseline within groups or between treatment groups in median values for body 
weight in either group. 
Special situations including medication error, misuse, overdose, and product complaints with associated AEs 
were collected during the study; no new safety concerns were identified from evaluation of reports of special 
situation events. 
Subjects co-infected with hepatitis B or C were not allowed to participate in Study GS-US-299-0109, therefore 
no relevant safety information is available from this study on the HIV-1/HBV or HCV co-infected population. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Similar percentages of subjects in each treatment group had SAEs (D/C/F/TAF 4.9%, 5 subjects; 
DRV+COBI+TVD 4.0%, 2 subjects). The rate of SAEs is as can be expected in this patient population. No SAEs 
were reported for > 1 subject. There was 1 SAE that was considered related to study drug by the investigator. 
Subject 0302-3149 in the D/C/F/TAF group had an SAE of Grade 3 hypersensitivity (allergic reaction) starting on 
Study Day 1 and non-serious AE of Grade 3 rash (body rash) starting on Study Day 8, both of which were 
considered related to study drug. Study drug was discontinued due to the events; the last dose was 
administered on Study Day 8. Both events resolved on Study Day 16. Overall, no specific safety concern was 
identified. No subjects died during the study.  
Laboratory findings 
The majority of subjects had at least 1 laboratory abnormality reported (D/C/F/TAF 96.1%, 98 subjects; 
DRV+COBI+TVD 94.0%, 47 subjects). The majority of laboratory abnormalities were Grade 1 or Grade 2. 
Similar percentages of subjects in both treatment groups had Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities (D/C/F/TAF 
27.5%, DRV+COBI+TVD 28.0%). The most commonly reported Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormality was 
creatine kinase (D/C/F/TAF 8.8%, 9 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 12.0%, 6 subjects). 
As Pancreatitis is listed as an important identified risk for Rezolsta (DRV+COBI), the applicant was requested to 
provide further details for all subjects in study GS-US-299-0102 that reported either amylase and/or lipase ≥ 3 
times the upper limit of normal in order to identify potential cases of pancreatitis. In study GS-US-299-0102, 
there was 1 transient isolated asymptomatic treatment-emergent increase of amylase levels ≥ 3xULN (1 in the 
D/C/F/TAF FDC group (1%), 0 in the DRV+COBI+F/TDF control group), and no subjects with lipase levels 
≥3xULN (lipase testing was only performed if subjects had total amylase >1.5xULN). The increased amylase 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 90/106 
  
  
levels were not associated with signs or symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis. There was no prior history of 
pancreatitis or alcohol use or abuse.  
There was an increased rate of lipid abnormalities in the D/C/F/TAF group, which is known to occur and is 
considered related to the fact that subjects receiving D/C/F/TAF have lower plasma concentrations of TVF for 
which a lipid-lowering effect has effectively been reported in literature.  
Safety in special populations 
Designated studies with the D/C/F/TAF FDC in special populations have not been performed, and the effects of 
intrinsic/extrinsic factors or special situations on the safety of D/C/F/TAF cannot be determined from the phase 
2 study GS-US-299-0102. As such, these effects are derived from data for the individual components. 
Paediatric patients 
The safety assessment of DRV once daily in paediatric subjects is based on the 48-week analysis of safety data 
from the Phase 2 Study TMC114-C230 in 12 ART-naïve HIV-1 infected paediatric subjects aged from 12 to 17 
years and weighing at least 40 kg. These data supported the approval of DRV 800 mg once daily for use in 
adolescents weighing at least 40 kg.  
The safety of COBI and F/TAF were evaluated in a single-arm clinical study (Study GS-US-292-0106) in which 
HIV-1 infected, treatment-naïve paediatric subjects aged 12 to <18 years received EVG, COBI, FTC and TAF as 
an FDC tablet. Results from this study show that the E/C/F/TAF FDC is well tolerated in adolescents, with a low 
incidence of study drug-related SAEs and the absence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug. There 
were no notable changes from baseline in height-age adjusted spine and TBLH BMD Z-scores after 48 weeks of 
treatment, indicating that subjects mineralized bone at rates consistent with those of the reference population. 
Few subjects experienced a clinically relevant decrease from baseline in BMD. These data supported the 
approval of E/C/F/TAF with a COBI dose of 150 mg and an F/TAF dose of 200/10 mg once daily for use in 
adolescents weighing at least 35 kg.  
Although there are no clinical data available with the D/C/F/TAF FDC in paediatric patients, the single agents are 
approved for use in this population. No specific safety concerns are noted from the 2 studies described above. 
There is however a difference in the weight restriction approved for other TAF-containing products, which all are 
approved for use from 35 kg onwards, and the restriction in weight of at least 40 kg for use of Darunavir 800 mg 
tablet (Prezista). The indication for the D/C/F/TAF FDC covers adolescents weighing at least 40 kg.  
Elderly 
As the oldest subject included in Study GS-US-299-0102 was 68 years old, very limited information is available 
in this population. Therefore, the D/C/F/TAF FDC is to be used with caution in patients above 65 years of age, 
due to the greater frequency of decreased hepatic function, concomitant disease(s), and/or polypharmacy.  
Renal impairment 
There are no data regarding the use of the D/C/F/TAF FDC, or its components DRV and COBI in patients with 
severe renal insufficiency. There was 1 study with TAF in severe renal impairment (GS-US-120-0108) which 
showed that plasma TAF exposure was less than 2-fold higher in subjects with severe renal impairment, 
compared with healthy subjects. Available data for the components of D/C/F/TAF (derived from Study 
GS-US-236-0118 and Study GS-US-292-0112) indicate that the overall safety profile in subjects with mild to 
moderate renal impairment was similar to that observed in the adult population. The final (safety) results from 
Study GS-US-236-0118 were recently assessed (procedure EMEA/H/C/002819/II/0007). The main conclusion 
was that overall the findings of the study do not alter the known safety profile of cobicistat containing medicinal 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 91/106 
  
  
products with regards to renal effects. In subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment treated with a 
cobicistat containing therapy for 96 weeks, the creatinine based eGFR endpoints showed a moderate decrease 
in eGFR values which remained stable from week 2 through week 96. This decrease seems not to be related to 
the occurrence of major renal events. Few discontinuations due to renal dysfunction were observed and few 
renal SAEs were described. 
Hepatic impairment 
Based on the PK, efficacy and safety data for the individual components, no dose adjustment is required in 
patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. However, 
D/C/F/TAF should be used with caution in these patients due to the increase in unbound DRV plasma 
concentrations. The D/C/F/TAF FDC or its components have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), therefore, the D/C/F/TAF FDC must not be used in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment. 
Coinfection with HIV-1 and Hepatitis B/C 
Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C treated with ART are at an increased risk for severe and potentially fatal 
hepatic adverse reactions. The safety and efficacy of D/C/F/TAF in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HCV have 
not been established. No specific clinical study was performed with the D/C/F/TAF FDC in subjects co-infected 
with HIV and HBV and/or HCV. Subjects were excluded from the Phase 2 study with the D/C/F/TAF FDC (Study 
GS-US-99-0102) and from the F/TAF Phase 2 and 3 studies. There is limited experience with DRV (boosted with 
rtv) in subjects co-infected with HIV and HBV and/or HCV. Among the 1,986 treatment-experienced subjects 
receiving DRV/rtv 600/100 mg twice daily, 236 were co-infected with hepatitis B or C. Co-infected subjects were 
more likely to have baseline and treatment-emergent hepatic transaminase elevations than those without 
chronic viral hepatitis. The safety of F/TAF in combination with EVG and COBI as an FDC was evaluated in 
approximately 70 HIV/HBV co-infected subjects treated for HIV in an open-label clinical study 
(GS-US-292-1249). Based on this experience, the safety profile of F/TAF in subjects with HIV/HBV coinfection 
appears to be similar to that in subjects with HIV-1 mono-infection. It can reasonably be concluded that the 
safety profile will be similar for the D/C/F/TAF FDC. Tenofovir alafenamide is active against HBV. Discontinuation 
of D/C/F/TAF therapy in patients co-infected with HIV and HBV may be associated with severe acute 
exacerbations of hepatitis due to the F/TAF components of D/C/F/TAF. Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV 
who discontinue D/C/F/TAF should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least 
several months after stopping treatment. D/C/F/TAF should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal 
products containing tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate), lamivudine, or adefovir dipivoxil used for the treatment 
of HBV infection. 
Pregnancy, lactation and fertility 
No adequate and well-controlled studies of D/C/F/TAF or its components have been conducted in pregnant 
women. The safety of the use of DRV, COBI, and FTC during pregnancy or breast-feeding is reflected in the 
respective approved drug labels. These products should only be used in pregnancy if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk. Because of both the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse 
reactions in breast fed infants, mothers should be instructed not to breast feed while using D/C/F/TAF. No 
human data on the effect of darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, or tenofovir alafenamide on fertility are 
available. There was no effect on mating or fertility in animals.  
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 92/106 
  
  
Overdose 
Human experience of acute overdose with the administration of D/C/F/TAF is not available. No study with 
administration of supratherapeutic doses of D/C/F/TAF has been conducted. Limited clinical experience is 
available with the components of the D/C/F/TAF FDC at doses higher than the therapeutic doses.  Increases in 
exposure when administering the D/C/F/TAF FDC with rtv or COBI are anticipated to be minimal as the inhibition 
of CYP3A is already near maximal for D/C/F/TAF. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies with the D/C/F/TAF FDC have been conducted. The drug-drug interaction 
profile of the D/C/F/TAF FDC is based on the interactions observed with the single agents, and is mostly driven 
by DRV/COBI as FTC and TAF have a low potential for drug-drug interactions. 
Based on the effect of DRV/COBI, co-administration of D/C/F/TAF is contraindicated with drugs that are highly 
dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious 
and/or life-threatening events (narrow therapeutic index). 
Discontinuation due to AEs 
Two subjects in each treatment group (D/C/F/TAF 1.9%; DRV+COBI+TVD 4.0%) discontinued from the study 
due to the following AEs: 
•  One subject in the D/C/F/TAF group discontinued study drug due to an SAE of hypersensitivity and a 
non-serious AE of rash.  
•  One subject in the D/C/F/TAF group discontinued study drug due to an SAE of substance abuse, which 
started on Study Day 233. The subject had experienced a previous SAE of substance abuse from Study 
Days 140 to 164. The subject was hospitalized for both events. The last dose of study drug was 
administered on Study Day 234, and the event was resolved on Study Day 283. The investigator 
considered the SAE of substance abuse resulting in study drug discontinuation not to be related to study 
drug.  
•  One subject in the DRV+COBI+TVD group discontinued study drug due to an SAE of Grade 2 renal 
tubular disorder (reported as PRT).  
•  One subject in the DRV+COBI+TVD group discontinued study drug due to a non-serious AE of Grade 3 
worsening of diarrhoea that was considered related to study drug. The event started on Study Day 373, 
and the last dose of study drug was administered on Study Day 382. Treatment included medication, 
and the event was reported as resolved on Study Day 389. 
Post marketing experience 
No data is available with the D/C/F/TAF fixed dose combination. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 93/106 
  
  
The safety of the D/C/F/TAF FDC is based on the well-established safety profile of the individual components 
DRV/COBI and F/TAF, further supported by the Phase 2 double-blind Study GS-US-299-0102. Actual exposure 
to the to be marketed FDC tablet is limited to 103 adult subjects who received at least 1 dose of D/C/F/TAF.  
Based on the results of study GS-US-299-0102, treatment with the D/C/F/TAF FDC seems to have an acceptable 
tolerability. The percentage of subjects reporting adverse events (92.2%) was comparable to the comparator 
arm receiving DRV+COBI+TVD (94.0%). The proportion of subjects with drug related adverse events varied 
from 38% (DRV+COBI+TVD) to 41.7% (D/C/F/TAF), and discontinuations due to drug related adverse events 
were infrequent (2 subjects in each arm). SAEs were reported in <5% in both treatment arms. 
Analysis of adverse events 
The most frequently reported adverse events in the D/C/F/TAF arm in study GS-US-299-0102 were diarrhoea 
(21.4%, 22 subjects); upper respiratory tract infection (15.5%, 16 subjects); fatigue (13.6%, 14 subjects); 
nausea (12.6%, 13 subjects); and rash (11.7%, 12 subjects). In the DRV+COBI+TVD arm these were diarrhoea 
(26.0%, 13 subjects); fatigue (18.0%, 9 subjects); upper respiratory tract infection (14.0%, 7 subjects); 
flatulence (12.0%, 6 subjects); and nausea, pain in extremity, vitamin D deficiency, and vomiting (each in 
10.0%, 5 subjects). 
The most commonly reported AEs considered related to the study drugs by the investigator by PT were: 
diarrhoea (D/C/F/TAF 13.6%, 14 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 14.0%, 7 subjects), flatulence (D/C/F/TAF 3.9%, 4 
subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 10.0%, 5 subjects), nausea (D/C/F/TAF 9.7%, 10 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 6.0%, 
3 subjects), and fatigue (D/C/F/TAF 8.7%, 9 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 8.0%, 4 subjects). Arthralgia was 
reported for at least 5% more subjects in the D/C/F/TAF group compared with the DRV+COBI+TVD group 
(D/C/F/TAF 8.7%, 9 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 0 subjects), however there was no evidence for a clear 
relationship.  
There was 1 SAE (Grade 3 hypersensitivity (allergic reaction)) that was considered related to study drug by the 
investigator (D/C/F/TAF group). No subjects died. Two subjects in each treatment group discontinued from the 
study due to the following AEs: hypersensitivity (considered related to study drug by the investigator), and 
substance abuse (considered not related) in the D/C/F/TAF group; and Grade 2 renal tubular disorder 
(considered not related), and Grade 3 worsening of diarrhoea (considered related) in the DRV+COBI+TVD 
group.   
AEs of special interest 
D/C/F/TAF showed, as expected, a better renal and bone safety profile compared to the DRV+COBI+TVD 
combination. There was an increased rate of lipid abnormalities in the D/C/F/TAF arm, which was expected to 
occur and is considered due to the fact that subjects receiving D/C/F/TAF have lower plasma concentrations of 
TVF for which a lipid-lowering effect has been reported in literature. The applicant argued that the changes in 
individual fasting lipid parameters and TC/HDL after administration of D/C/F/TAF in adolescents will be limited 
as these are expected to lie between the changes observed in study TMC114-C230 (effects of DRV in the 
absence of the lipid-protective effects of TDF) and in study GS-US-292-0106 (effects of TAF, known to have less 
lipid-protective effects than TDF).  
As Pancreatitis is listed as an important identified risk for Rezolsta (DRV+COBI), the applicant was requested to 
provide further details for all subjects in study GS-US-299-0102 that reported either amylase and/or lipase ≥ 3 
times the upper limit of normal in order to identify potential cases of pancreatitis. The observation of one 
transient isolated asymptomatic treatment-emergent increase of amylase levels ≥3xULN with D/C/F/TAF FDC 
was reassuring.

Missing data 
No specific clinical study was performed with the D/C/F/TAF FDC in the following special populations: paediatric 
subjects, elderly subjects, subjects with renal insufficiency, hepatic impairment, or in subjects co-infected with 
hepatitis B or C. No adequate and well-controlled studies of D/C/F/TAF or its components have been conducted 
in pregnant women. No human experience of acute overdose with the administration of D/C/F/TAF is available. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions 
Co-administration of D/C/F/TAF is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance 
and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events 
(narrow therapeutic index). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of the D/C/F/TAF FDC is largely based on the well-established safety profile of the individual 
components. The safety profile of D/C/F/TAF FDC is supported by the results from the phase 2 study and as well 
by the preliminary results from the ongoing phase 3 studies. The observed safety profile is in line with 
expectations and did not raise additional concerns.

2.9.  New Active Substance 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers that darunavir / cobicistat / emtricitabine / tenofovir 
alafenamide are not new active substances, as they are constituent of medicinal products previously authorised 
within the European Union. Darunavir/ cobicistat are contained in the marketing authorisation Rezolsta which 
was authorised in the Union on 19 November 2014 and emtricitabine/ tenofovir alafenamide are contained in the 
marketing authorisation Descovy which was authorised in the Union on 21 April 2016. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable.  
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Symtuza (darunavir / cobicistat / emtricitabine / 
tenofovir alafenamide) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, 
on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The fixed dose combination (FDC) of Darunavir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (D/C/F/TAF) 
has been developed for the treatment of HIV infected individuals.  
The following indication is claimed for D/C/F/TAF: 
TRADENAME is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) infection in adults 
and adolescents (aged 12 years and older with body weight at least 40 kg) (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
HIV-1 infection results in chronic immune activation and a subsequent gradual loss of CD4+ T cells eventually 
leading to a state of acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS). One of the predictors for HIV-1 disease progression is 
the level of HIV-1 RNA in the blood (i.g. viral load). The aim of treatment of HIV-1 infection is therefore to 
suppress the HIV-1 viral load to levels that are at least below 50 copies/mL of blood. It is a life-long treatment, 
as the viral load will rebound as soon as an individual stops taking effective antiretroviral therapy.

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The available treatment options for HIV-1 infected individuals have greatly improved in the last two decades. 
Current treatment options are generally considered to be potent, with an overall acceptable safety profile. 
Although rare, resistance can occur potentially leading to resistance to antiretroviral drugs or classes. Therefore, 
there is a continuous need for development of new antiretroviral treatment options as well as simple 
antiretroviral regimen to enhance adherence which is paramount for HIV treatment.  
The current application for the D/C/F/TAF FDC is a combination of 3 known active substances with antiviral 
activity, combined with a PK enhancer. As such, it is not considered a new treatment option, but has rather been 
developed to further simplify HIV-1 treatment with a reduced pill-burden. The D/C/F/TAF FDC is the first 
complete protease inhibitor (PI)-based HIV-1 regimen in a single tablet to be taken once daily. 
The co-formulation with TAF, a prodrug of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) tenofovir (TFV), 
instead of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), offers an improved renal and bone safety profile compared to 
TDF, with similar efficacy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is based on Phase 1 studies bridging to the clinical development programs for DRV, COBI, FTC, 
and TAF as single agents (DRV and COBI) and combinations thereof (DRV/COBI and F/TAF). The pivotal 
bioequivalence study is Study TMC114FD2HTX1001, further supported by the relative bioavailability studies 
TMC114FD2HTX1002 and GS-US-299-0101.  
The clinical efficacy, resistance, and safety data are mainly extrapolated from previous studies with DRV/rtv and 
E/C/F/TAF and further supported by clinical data from one Phase 2 study with D/C/F/TAF (Study 
GS-US-299-0102). 
Study TMC114FD2HTX1001 was a randomized, two-way, cross-over study to evaluate the single-dose PK and 
pivotal bioequivalence of the D/C/F/TAF FDC compared to the separate agents (DRV 800 mg tablet formulation 
and F/TAF 200/10 mg FDC in the presence of 150 mg COBI), under fed conditions (standardized regular-fat 
breakfast, in healthy subjects. 
Study TMC114FD2HTX1002 investigated the effect of concomitant food intake (standardized high 
calorie/high-fat breakfast, 56 g fat) on the oral bioavailability of DRV, COBI, FTC and TAF following oral 
administration of D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg as 1 x FDC tablet was investigated in a Phase 1, randomized, 
3-panel, open-label, 2-way crossover study in healthy subjects.  
Study GS-US-299-0101 was a Phase 1, adaptive-design, randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, 3-part, 
multiple-cohort, single-center study and compared three candidate D/C/F/TAF FDC tablet formulations after 
repeated dosing in order to select a formulation for Phase 2; and subsequently the PK and bioavailability of DRV, 
COBI, FTC, TAF, and TFV when administered as the selected Phase 2 D/C/F/TAF FDC relative to the 
administration of the individual components: DRV plus COBI or FTC plus TAF. 
Study GS-US-299-0102 was a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, active controlled study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of D/C/F/TAF FDC vs DRV+COBI+TVD in 153 subjects (N=103 and N=50, 
respectively).

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Studies TMC114FD2HTX1001, TMC114FD2HTX1002 and GS-US-299-0101 demonstrated comparable exposure 
(i.e. AUC and Cmax) for DRV, COBI, FTC, and TAF when administered as single agents or as the D/C/F/TAF FDC 
in healthy subjects and HIV-1 infected ART-naïve subjects as compared with historical data, allowing the 
extrapolation of safety and efficacy data from either darunavir/low-dose ritonavir (DRV/rtv) 800/100 mg once 
daily, DRV/COBI 800/150 mg once daily or F/TAF 200/10 mg once daily to D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10 mg once 
daily. 
The pivotal bioequivalence study TMC114FD2HTX1001 showed that the D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10-mg FDC 
tablet is bioequivalent to combined administration of the separate agents DRV, the F/TAF FDC, and COBI.  
Study GS-US-299-0102 showed that the D/C/F/TAF FDC was non-inferior to DRV+COBI+TVD. Virologic success 
rates in the FAS at Week 24 were 77/103 (74.8%) for D/C/F/TAF, and 37/50 (74.0%) for DRV+COBI+TVD 
(difference in percentages (adjusted for baseline HIV RNA stratum and race stratum): 3.3%, 95% CI -11.4% to 
18.1%). At week 48, virologic success rates were 79/103 (76.7%) and 42/50 (84.0%) for D/C/F/TAF FDC and 
DRV+COBI+TVD, respectively (difference in percentages: -6.2%, 95% CI -19.9% to 7.4%). 
Virologic success rates in the PP analysis set were 77/91 (84.6%) for D/C/F/TAF and 37/47 (78.7%) for 
DRV+COBI+TVD (difference in percentages: 8.3%, 95% CI: -5.3% to 22.0%), at week 24, and 79/85 (92.9%) 
D/C/F/TAF vs. 42/46 (91.3%) DRV+COBI+TVD (difference 2.4%, 95% CI: -8.8% to 13.7%) at week 48. 
CD4 cell counts increased for each treatment group with mean increases (SD) through Week 48 of 231 (141.9) 
cells/μL for D/C/F/TAF vs. 212 (151.5) cells/μL for DRV+COBI+TVD. The CD4% also increased in each 
treatment group with mean increases from baseline at Week 48 of 8.2% vs. 9.3% for D/C/F/TAF and 
DRV+COBI+TVD, respectively.  
Subgroups analyses did not identify a subgroup clearly yielding more or less treatment benefit. 
Mean (SD) percentage changes from baseline to week 48 in hip bone mineral density (BMD) were  -0.84% 
(2.582) for D/C/F/TAF, and -3.82% (2.651) for DRV+COBI+TVD. Mean (SD) percentage changes from baseline 
to week 48 in spine BMD were -1.57% (3.920) for D/C/F/TAF, and -3.62% (3.128) DRV+COBI+TVD. Mean (SD) 
increases from baseline at Week 48 in serum creatinine were 0.06 (0.101) mg/dL for D/C/F/TAF, and 0.09 
(0.161) mg/dL for DRV+COBI+TVD. Mean (SD) changes from baseline at Week 48 in estimated GFR were -2.9 
(13.43) mL/min for D/C/F/TAF, and -9.2 (15.81) mL/min for DRV+COBI+TVD.   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
External validity of trial results 
The Phase 2 study GS-US-299-0102 enrolled patients aged 18-68 years, who were mainly male. The lack of data 
in patients older than 68 years does not allow characterizing the efficacy and safety of D/C/F/TAF in this 
population. Screening failures occurred in 34% of subjects screened (79/232). The trial population however 
does seem to be fully representative of the broad patient population with HIV-1 infection. 
Assay sensitivity observations 
Efficacy and safety of the to be marketed FDC has been tested in a single, exploratory, phase 2 study 
(GS-US-299-0102), set up with the aim to estimate the relative efficacy and safety. With the planned sample 
size of 150 subjects, the power to evaluate non-inferiority was 56% (with an assumed response rate of 88% for 
both groups and a non-inferiority margin of 0.12).  
Assessment report  
EMA/496527/2017 
Page 103/106 
  
  
Internal consistency 
Based on the primary analysis conducted at week 24 non-inferiority of D/C/F/TAF FDC vs. DRV+COBI+TVD 
could be concluded (albeit marginally). However, week 48 data showed a lower virological success rate in the 
D/C/F/TAF group vs. the DRV+COBI+TVD group. This was due to an imbalance in subjects who discontinued 
study drug for reason other than lack of efficacy. In conclusions, there were no indications for a systematic 
non-safety drug-related reason for the higher discontinuation rate in the D/C/F/TAF group. 
Quality observations 
As different formulations were used in the main clinical studies, additional justifications were provided stating 
the used formulations were representative for the commercial product. 
Pharmacokinetic observations 
The pivotal bioequivalence study showed that the D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10-mg FDC tablet is bioequivalent to 
combined administration of the separate agents DRV, the F/TAF FDC, and COBI. The acceptability of the 
outcome of this study was dependent on the resolution of objections related to the bioanalysis (lack of proper QC 
coverage of the calibration curves of the clinical study samples). Extra revalidation experiments using an 
additional QC sample were carried out, which results met the usual bioanalysis acceptance criteria. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The main adverse events reported in study GS-US-299-0102 were diarrhoea (21.4%, 22 subjects); upper 
respiratory tract infection (15.5%, 16 subjects); fatigue (13.6%, 14 subjects); nausea (12.6%, 13 subjects); 
and rash (11.7%, 12 subjects) in the D/C/F/TAF group, and diarrhoea (26.0%, 13 subjects); fatigue (18.0%, 9 
subjects); upper respiratory tract infection (14.0%, 7 subjects); flatulence (12.0%, 6 subjects); and nausea, 
pain in extremity, vitamin D deficiency, and vomiting (each in 10.0%, 5 subjects) in the DRV+COBI+TVD group.  
The percentages of subjects in each group with any AE considered by the investigator to be related to study drug 
were 41.7%, 43 subjects in the D/C/F/TAF group, and 38.0%, 19 subjects in the DRV+COBI+TVD group. The 
most commonly reported AEs considered related to the study drugs by the investigator by PT which formed the 
basis for identification of adverse drug reactions were as follows: diarrhoea (D/C/F/TAF 13.6%, 14 subjects; 
DRV+COBI+TVD 14.0%, 7 subjects), flatulence (D/C/F/TAF 3.9%, 4 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 10.0%, 5 
subjects), nausea (D/C/F/TAF 9.7%, 10 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 6.0%, 3 subjects), and fatigue (D/C/F/TAF 
8.7%, 9 subjects; DRV+COBI+TVD 8.0%, 4 subjects).  
Changes from baseline at week 48 were observed in total cholesterol (40 mg/dL with D/C/F/TAF and 5 mg/dL 
with D/C/F/TDF, p<0.001), direct LDL cholesterol (26 mg/dL with D/C/F/TAF vs 4 mg/dL with 
DRV+COBI+F/TDF, p<0.001) HDL cholesterol (7 mg/dL with D/C/F/TAF vs 3 mg/dL with DRV+COBI+F/TDF, 
p=0.009), and triglycerides (29 mg/dL with D/C/F/TAF vs -5 mg/dL with DRV+COBI+F/TDF, p=0.007). 
SAEs were reported in <5% of subjects with similar percentages in each treatment group. There was 1 SAE 
(Grade 3 hypersensitivity (allergic reaction)) that was considered related to study drug by the investigator 
(D/C/F/TAF group). No subjects died.  
Two subjects in each treatment group (D/C/F/TAF 1.9%; DRV+COBI+TVD 4.0%) discontinued from the study 
due to the following AEs: hypersensitivity (considered related to study drug by the investigator), and substance 
abuse (considered not related) in the D/C/F/TAF group; and Grade 2 renal tubular disorder (considered not 
related), and Grade 3 worsening of diarrhoea (considered related) in the DRV+COBI+TVD group.

Page 104/106 
  
  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
D/C/F/TAF FDC has been evaluated in a limited data set of 103 HIV-1 infected subjects (Phase 2 study 
GS-US-299-0102) with a median duration of study drug exposure of 68.0 weeks. Additional 231 healthy 
subjects received the D/C/F/TAF FDC in Phase 1 studies. Long-term data is missing, however phase 3 studies 
are ongoing and will provide additional and longer-term data. 
No specific clinical study was performed with the D/C/F/TAF FDC in adolescent subjects, elderly subjects, and 
subjects with renal insufficiency or hepatic impairment, or subjects co-infected with HIV-1 and hepatitis B or C. 
No adequate and well-controlled studies of D/C/F/TAF or its components have been conducted in pregnant 
women. No human experience of acute overdose with the administration of D/C/F/TAF is available. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The pivotal bioequivalence study showed that the D/C/F/TAF 800/150/200/10-mg FDC tablet is bioequivalent to 
combined administration of the separate agents DRV, the F/TAF FDC, and COBI.  
The D/C/F/TAF FDC is the first complete protease inhibitor (PI)-based HIV-1 regimen in a single tablet to be 
taken once daily, and thereby adds to further simplify HIV-1 treatment with a reduced pill-burden. 
The viral success rates observed in the phase 2 study GS-US-299-0102 are somewhat lower than those 
previously observed in studies of similar design. Non-inferiority of the D/C/F/TAF FDC vs. DRV+COBI+TVD could 
be established based on the week 24 efficacy data of study GS-US-299-0102. Results after 48 weeks of 
treatment suggested lower virologic response for D/C/F/TAF vs. the single components. This seems to be caused 
by a disproportionally greater frequency of subjects in the D/C/F/TAF group who discontinued for other reasons 
than lack of efficacy. There were no indications for a systematic non-safety drug-related reason for the higher 
discontinuation rate in the D/C/F/TAF group. Efficacy results from the PP analysis at week 48 (excluding those 
subjects who discontinued the study prematurely) is more in line with expected virologic response and similar to 
what observed with other FDC (e.g: Genvoya phase 2 study with 95% and 90.7%, for E/C/F/TAF and Stribild, 
respectively).  
The safety of the D/C/F/TAF FDC is based on the well-established safety profile of the single components and 
further supported by the phase 2 study results and preliminary Phase 3 study results with D/C/F/TAF. In 
conclusion, the safety profile however is in line with expectations and did not raise additional concerns. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Bioequivalence of the FDC to the separate components has been established. Non-inferiority of D/C/F/TAF vs 
DRV+COBI+TVD has been shown in the phase 2 study. The safety of D/C/F/TAF FDC is in line with the one 
known for the single components.  
3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Symtuza is positive.

presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.

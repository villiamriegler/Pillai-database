2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Golimumab is a human monoclonal IgG antibody.  Golimumab binds to both soluble and 
transmembrane forms of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and inhibits TNFα bioactivity.  Other 
members of this therapeutic class include infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol. 
Simponi is currently approved for use in the adult therapeutic indications RA, PsA, AS, nr-AxSpA, and 
UC.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) refers to arthritis of at least 6 weeks duration of unknown aetiology 
that begins in children less than 16 years old. JIA has an annual incidence of 0.008-0.226 per 1000 
children and a prevalence of 0.07-4.01 per 1000 children. Children of all age groups may be affected 
although onset during the first year of life is rare and restricted predominantly to systemic JIA. 
Rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA), and PsA are diseases in adults that correspond 
most closely to individual categories of JIA with similar clinical manifestations and underlying 
immunologic mechanisms (ie, polyarticular JIA, enthesitis related arthritis [ERA], and juvenile psoriatic 
arthritis [JPsA], respectively). 
The Applicant has conducted a Phase 3 clinical study (CNTO148JIA3001 [GO-KIDS]; EudraCT No: 
2009-015019-42) to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of 
golimumab in paediatric subjects ≥2 to <18 years of age with polyarticular JIA.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant did not submit any environmental risk assessment (ERA) studies in accordance with the 
CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) which states that proteins are unlikely to result in significant risk to the 
environment.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In study CNTO148JIA3001 (see Section 2.4.1 for detailed description of the study), samples for the 
measurement of serum golimumab concentrations were collected at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 48, 
72, 96, 120, and 144. For the first 30 subjects in the study, additional PK samples were drawn at Day 
4 and Day 15.   
Interim PK analyses including population PK analyses were performed after 30 subjects reached Week 
8 (with a pause in enrolment for confirmation of dosing strategy after the 30th subject was enrolled) 
and after 121 subjects reached Week 16 to evaluate the PK and develop the population PK model. 
The Week 8 population PK analysis demonstrated that paediatric subjects had similar mean serum 
trough golimumab concentrations (ranging from 0.99 to 1.10 µg/mL across 3 age subgroups [2 to 6, 
≥6 to 12, ≥12 years] at Week 8). Furthermore, these concentrations in subjects with JIA were also 
similar to the mean concentrations (0.82 µg/mL at Week 76; 1.17 µg/mL at Week 104) observed in an 
adult RA population of MTX-inadequate responders who received golimumab 50 mg SC q4w + MTX in 
the study C0524T06 where the same MSD ECLIA method was used at Weeks 76 and 104 for the 
measurement of serum golimumab concentrations (results from this study were evaluated during 
EMEA/H/C/II/0009).   
Another interim PK analysis was performed with data from 121 subjects that had completed their Week 
16 visit. Serum golimumab concentrations that were observed through Week 8 were maintained 
through Week 16 and were similar across the age groups as well as across the BMI quartiles.  
Median trough golimumab concentrations through Week 48 for the two groups of JIA subjects who 
were randomized at Week 16 to receive either placebo or golimumab (30 mg/m2 q4w) after the 16-
week open-label treatment with golimumab (30 mg/m2 q4w) are presented in Figure 1.

Immunogenicity Evaluation 
Samples for antibody to golimumab assessment were collected at baseline (Week 0), Week 4, Week 
12, Week 24, Week 48, Week 72, Week 96, Week 120, and Week 144 and evaluated with a drug-
tolerant EIA method. Subjects who were positive for antibodies to golimumab were further tested for 
NAbs. 
Antibodies to golimumab were detected in 69 (40.1%) of 172 golimumab treated subjects with 
appropriate samples through Week 48. The majority of the antibody positive subjects had low titers, 
38 of 69 subjects had a titer lower than 1:100 and 61 of 69 subjects had a titer lower than 1:1000. 
The highest titer was 1:3072.  
The effect of immunogenicity on PK, efficacy and safety was further evaluated by titer groups.  It was 
found that subjects with positive anti-golimumab antibody status and golimumab titers >1:100 had 
decreased steady-state trough golimumab levels; however, an apparent reduction in efficacy was not 
seen until the titers of antibodies to golimumab were >1:1000. In addition, there was no association 
between positive status for antibodies to golimumab and injection site reactions. 
Overall, of the subjects positive for antibodies to golimumab, 25 (38.5%) were positive for NAbs. 
2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Population PK model 
Population pharmacokinetic modelling was performed with the First Order Conditional Estimation 
method. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption parameterised in terms of apparent 
clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (V/F) and the absorption rate constant (ka) was used 
to describe the time course of serum golimumab concentrations. The inter-individual random effects on 
the parameters were modelled. 
Potential covariate effects evaluated using the Stepwise Covariate Method (SCM) were (i) body weight, 
age, white blood cell count, serum albumin, C-reactive protein, creatinine clearance, sex and immune 
response on clearance, and (ii) body weight on volume of distribution. 
PK samples for serum golimumab concentration were collected from all subjects in study 
CNTO148JIA3001 at visits at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 48. An additional PK sample was 
collected from all subjects at any time between Weeks 0 and 12 other than the time of the Week 0, 
Week 4, and Week 8 visits and collected at least 24 hours before or after a study agent injection. For 
the first 30 subjects in the study, additional PK and CRP samples were obtained on Day 4 and Day 15. 
From the 1478 pharmacokinetic observations included in the dataset, 17 (1.15%) duplicate records, 1 
(0.07%) pre-dose record, and 358 (24.2%) records below the quantifiable limit (BQL) were excluded 
from the analysis. After exclusions of the unusable data, there were a total of 1102 pharmacokinetic 
observations from 169 subjects that were included in the population PK analysis. 
Final model parameter estimates and covariate effects are included in Table 2 (see below). All fixed 
effect parameters were estimated with good precision, with the %RSE less than 19%, except for the 
estimate of additive residual error which was 54%. Inter-individual random effects were also estimated 
with good precision, with %RSE less than 25%, with the exception of ka, which was 48.2%. Although 
the shrinkage for ka, was relatively high (63.2%), it was not found to be an issue since no covariates 
were evaluated on that parameter.

Table 1. Parameter estimates form the population PL model for golimumab 
Based on the estimated parameters of the final model, a subject with body weight corresponding to 
the 10th percentile (16 kg) of the population in the PK analysis would be expected to have CL/F and 
V/F values that are 39% and 32%, respectively, than those of a subject with median body weight of 46 
kg. Conversely, CL/F and V/F in a subject with body weight at the 90th percentile (67 kg) are predicted 
to be 39% and 51% higher than that of a subject with median body weight, respectively. 
Exposure-response model 
An analysis of Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS) response in paediatric patients with 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis receiving 30 mg/m2 SC golimumab q4w was performed using an indirect 
response population PK/PD model. Data for this analysis were obtained from study CNTO148JIA3001, 
which was a randomized withdrawal study in children aged 2 to less than 18 years. The individual PK 
parameters obtained from the final population PK model were then used to describe each subject’s full 
PK profile, which was used as a driver for the JADAS PK/PD model. The natural log of the raw JADAS 
scores was the dependent variable for the analysis. 
The semi-mechanistic PK/PD model used to characterize the time course of log-transformed JADAS 
scores is illustrated in the figure below. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404217/2016  
Page 10/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The final PK/PD model for log-transformed JADAS had between-subject variability terms on Kout, 
Pmax, and IC50. No covariate effects were found to be statistically significant during testing. 
Visual predictive checks were in good agreement with the observed data for all treatment groups with 
the exception of the non-responders that withdrew after Week 16. The VPCs of the non-responders at 
Week 16 were based on a small number of subjects (19 out of 173 subjects, 11%), which makes the 
interpretation of VPC quality difficult in the group of non-responders. 
From the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS) PK/PD analysis using the M3 model for the 
PK characterization, the golimumab concentration required for a typical individual to reach EC50 was 
0.412 ug/mL. The calculated EC80 and EC90 for a typical individual were 1.648 ug/mL and 3.708 
ug/mL. 
The percentage of patients with a steady state average plasma concentration (Css,av) above EC50, 
EC80 and EC90 was derived from the PKPD model of JADAS. Approximately 91% of the patients <40 
kg (receiving BSA-based dose) and 76% of the patients ≥ 40 kg (receiving a fixed 50 mg dose) had a 
Css,av > EC80. The corresponding percentages for Css,av > EC90 were approximately 22% and 12% 
for the <40 kg and ≥ 40 kg groups, respectively. The difference is likely to be a result of individualized 
dosing (BSA based) vs. fixed dosing rather than an effect of the actual body weight. 
Exposure simulations 
The final population PK model was used to perform simulations in order to evaluate steady-state area-
under-the-curve (AUCss) and minimum golimumab concentration (Cmin,ss) in paediatric subjects 
resulting from the proposed golimumab dose regimens of: 
•  30 mg/m2 q4wk in children weighing < 40 kg. 
•  50 mg q4w in children weighing ≥ 40 kg. 
The impacts of age, weight, and dose rounding on exposure were explored by simulating the following 
paediatric populations: 
•  Age: 2-5 years, 6-11 years, 12-17 years, and all pediatrics. 
•  Weight: <40 kg, ≥40 kg, and all pediatrics. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404217/2016  
Page 11/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For purposes of comparison, exposures in lighter weight adults receiving golimumab 50 mg q4w were 
also simulated for the following populations: weight <60 kg and weight <80 kg. 
All simulation cohorts (scenarios) were comprised of 1000 simulated subjects. Height and weight 
values for simulated paediatric subjects were sampled from CDC growth chart data using the following 
scheme: 
•  Age records within the growth chart tables were sampled with replacement. 
•  Within each age record, height and weight values were sampled from a normal distribution with 
mean equal to the median reported in the table and standard deviation (SD) imputed from table 
values for median and 75th percentile (Q75) using the following formula: SD = (Q75 – 
median)/Z75, where Z75 is the 75th percentile of a standard normal distribution. 
Values for serum albumin in simulated pediatric subjects were sampled with replacement from the 
baseline values from all 173 pediatric subjects who participated in Study CNTO148JIA3001. 
This approach was deemed appropriate following exploration of the available paediatric demographic 
data, which did not reveal any appreciable correlation between albumin and other covariates of 
interest. All demographic data for simulated adult subjects was sampled with replacement from the 
demographic data from Studies C0524T05 and C0524T06 (initially submitted and evaluated through 
EMEA/H/C/000992/II/0055), which were contributed by a total of 279 subjects. Originally only 
demographic data from C0524T06 were planned; however, C0524T05 was included to increase the 
numbers of adults with lower body weights for comparison to the paediatric population. Body weight 
data from studies C0524T05 and C0524T06 were used to compare the exposure of paediatrics and 
adults with body weight <60kg as well as <80kg. The body weight distributions of the paediatrics and 
adults used in the simulations are shown in (Figure 2). 
Figure 2. A histogram of body weight distributions of the paediatrics (CNTO148JIA3001) and adults 
(C0524T05 and C0524T06) 
Individual values for AUCss were computed from the simulation output using the individual dose and 
clearance values for each simulated subject (AUCss = Dose/CL). Simulated trough concentrations at 
Week 48 were used as estimates of Cmin,ss. These derived PK parameters were then displayed as 
side-by-side box-and-whisker plots for all simulation scenarios (Figures 3 and 4). Bold lines are

drawn at data medians. Box edges are drawn at the medians of the upper and lower halves of the 
data. Whiskers are drawn at the most extreme observations to fall within 1.5x the interquartile range.

Due to the large number of pharmacokinetic observations below the quantification limit and in order to 
minimise the risk of BQL-induced bias in parameter estimates and facilitate evaluation of non-linear 
PK, the Applicant submitted an updated model in which the M3 method (Bergstrand et al., 2009) was 
applied handle the BQL data. Boxplots from this updated model are presented in Figures 5, 6, 7 and 
8.

To further support the weight cut-off selection with historical adult data for the dosing posology of 
golimumab in pJIA, PK simulations to evaluate the effect of various weight cut-offs were performed, 
which were then compared with historical adult exposures from study C0524T06 to optimize the weight 
cut-off selection.

For the historical adult exposure, the previously established adult RA population PK model could not be 
used for comparison with the pJIA data since golimumab concentrations through Week 24 for the 
corresponding adult RA study (C0524T06) were evaluated with a different assay platform compared to 
that used in study CNTO148JIA3001. Therefore, observed trough concentrations from study C0524T06 
at Week 76 and Week 104 were used because these concentrations were measured using the same 
platform as in study CNTO148JIA3001. The data at Week 76 and Week 104 were combined since both 
values were at steady-state. In addition, the data from the 50 mg q4w and 100 mg q4w treatment 
arms were included in order to increase the pool of observed historical adult trough concentrations 
with body weight <50 kg and <60 kg. Since golimumab PK is approximately dose proportional, the 
exposure from the 100 mg q4w was divided in half for combination with data from the 50 mg q4w 
treatment group. Of note, the sample size from the adult historical data was low (<50kg: n = 13; 
<60kg: n = 49). 
Target exposure distributions were evaluated by comparing the resulting overall paediatric steady-
state trough serum golimumab concentrations of 10,000 paediatric virtual subjects by various weight 
cut-off values with the distribution of the historical adult target exposures (Figure 9).

golimumab concentrations at Week 12, Week 24, and Week 48 were 1.16, 1.12, and 0.95 µg/mL 
respectively. Steady-state trough golimumab levels in JIA subjects at 30 mg/m2 q4w SC were similar 
across different age groups (2 to 6, ≥6 to 12, ≥12 years), body weight quartiles, BMI quartiles and 
body weight categories and were also similar to or slightly higher than those seen in adult subjects 
who received 50 mg SC golimumab q4w. 
Median trough on active treatment golimumab concentrations were maintained over time for subjects 
who continued on active treatment. Conversely for subjects who were randomized to placebo at Week

16 these quickly dropped to low concentrations. Since placebo subjects switched to golimumab upon 
disease flare, detectable low golimumab concentration at Weeks 24 and 48 were expected in this 
group of subjects.    
The population PK analysis at Week 8 confirmed that the dosing strategy was adequate and enrolment 
in the study recommenced. The Week 16 population PK analysis was considered appropriate for 
characterizing the population PK and confirming the dosing strategy for SC golimumab in JIA. 
To further support the rationale of selecting of 40 kg as the body weight cut-off for children to 
transition from BSA based dosing to the adult fixed dose of 50 mg every 4 weeks the MAH also 
provided a comparison of simulated exposure for different values for the body weight cut-off (35 kg to 
60 kg in steps of 5 kg). Regardless of weight cut-off, the medians and range were very similar or 
slightly higher than the historical observed adult data and were well within the observed paediatric 
data seen in study CNTO148JIA3001. Comparison of the medians and difference from the adults for 
the 40 and 45 kg weight cuts showed that the 40 kg cut-off would have a 34% difference from the 
historical adult data while the 45 kg weight cut-off would have a 30% difference. However, the 
precision of these estimations is limited due to the small sample size for the historical adult target 
exposure distributions. 
Exposure data in adults was considered to be comparable to that in children, especially as this 
comparison was based on historical PK data in adult patients which were generated with the same 
bioassay as the paediatric data. However, as a presentation that can be dosed per body area is not yet 
available, use of the product in pJIA will be limited to the population that can use the currently 
available formulation i.e. children with a body weight of at least 40 kg. 
The PKPD analysis of ACR was not considered sufficient to draw conclusions about exposure-response. 
Instead, the PKPD model of Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS) constitutes the support 
for claims of efficacy and dosing regimen in children with pJIA weighing at least 40 kg. The posology is 
considered adequate based on simulations of the proportion of patients that achieve mean exposure 
above the modeled EC50. 
Higher incidences of antibodies to golimumab were expected with the new drug-tolerant EIA method 
compared to the previous EIA method due to the high sensitivity and improved drug tolerance of the 
new method. This was also observed in the adult RA C0524T06 study where results from the original 
EIA and the drug-tolerant EIA methods were compared. 
The overall incidence of antibodies to golimumab in JIA subjects was 40.1% (69 of 172 subjects) when 
using a newly developed drug-tolerant immunoassay which was highly sensitive in detecting low 
titer/weak immunogenic responses. Positive antibody to golimumab status decreased steady-state 
trough levels when titer levels were >1:100; however, the effect of ADA on efficacy was less sensitive 
requiring titers >1:1000 in order to show apparent efficacy reduction. Due to the low numbers of 
subjects with high titers, there was no overall effect of antibodies to golimumab on efficacy or safety 
and therefore does not represent any new safety signal. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The results indicate that the PK profile of golimumab in adult patients is similar to that in children with 
JIA. Considering the effect of weigh on exposure, the proposed used of golimumab in children with a 
body weight of 40 kg or more is considered appropriate.

Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the clinical efficacy of SC administration of 
golimumab in paediatric subjects (ages 2 to less than 18 years) with JIA manifested by ≥5 joints with 
active arthritis despite MTX therapy for ≥3 months. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to evaluate golimumab in paediatric subjects with JIA with 
respect to: 
Physical function 
•  Safety 
• 
•  Quality of life 
•  Disease activity status over time 
• 
• 
Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects who were American College of Rheumatology 
Paediatric (ACR Ped) 30 responders at Week 16 and did not experience a flare of disease between 
Week 16 and Week 48.

ACR Ped response and flare of disease are composite endpoints measured by the 6 paediatric ACR 
categories. These are as follows: 
Physicians global assessment of disease, (Visual Analogue Scale, 0-100mm) 
• 
•  Subject/parent global assessment of overall wellbeing, (Visual Analogue Scale, 0-100 mm) 
•  Number of active joints (defined as either swelling, or in absence of swelling, limited range of 
motion associated with pain on motion or tenderness), (0-73) 
•  Number of joints with limited range of motion, (0-69) 
• 
• 
Physical function by Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ, 0-3) 
Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR, performed at site), (unit = mm/h) 
ACR Ped 30 response is defined as ≥30% improvement from baseline in at least 3 of the 6 components 
with worsening of 30% or more in no more than 1 of the above noted components. 
ACR Ped 50, 70 and 90 responses are also defined as 50%, 70%, and 90% improvement respectively 
in a minimum of three core set criteria with worsening of one variable by no more than 30%. 
ACR Ped 30, 50, 70 and 90 were also assessed throughout the open-label phase of the study. 
Flare of Disease 
Flare according to the JIA paediatric criteria for flare (all criteria must be met): 
•  ≥30% worsening in at least 3 of the 6 ACR PED components and ≥30% improvement in not 
more than 1 of the 6 ACR response components from Week 16. 
• 
• 
• 
If the Physician or Subject/Parent Global Assessment is one of the 3 ACR response components 
used to define flare, worsening of ≥20 mm from Week 16 must be present, 
If the number of active joints or joints with limitation of motion is one of the 3 ACR response 
components used to define flare, worsening in ≥2 joints from Week 16 must be present. 
If ESR was used in flare definition, the worsening in ESR had to be to a level above the upper 
limit of normal (ULN, 20 mm/h). If CRP was used in flare definition, the worsening in CRP had 
to be to a level above the ULN, 1.0 mg/dL or 10 mg/L. 
Flare was assessed at each visit or reported at an unscheduled visit. Therefore, it was possible for a 
subject to have multiple flares over time. For flare of JIA disease determination prior to Week 16 study 
agent administration, the baseline was the value measured at Week 0. After Week 16 study agent 
administration, the baseline for flare of disease calculation was the measurement at Week 16. Baseline 
for observed ACR Ped response calculations were the component measurements at Week 0. 
A subject was considered to have a flare of disease if there was at least one occurrence of flare of 
disease (as defined above) anytime between Week 16 and Week 48. 
There were 3 major secondary endpoints. The major secondary analyses in order of importance are as 
follows: 
• 
• 
• 
The proportion of ACR Ped 30 responders at Week 16 with ACR Ped 30 response at Week 48. 
The proportion of subjects who were ACR Ped 30 responders at Week 16 and had inactive 
disease at Week 48. 
The proportion of subjects who were ACR Ped 30 responders at Week 16 and were in protocol-
defined clinical remission while on medication for JIA at Week 48. 
Inactive disease

Inactive disease was defined as the presence of all of the following: 
1. No joints with active arthritis; 
2. No fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy attributable 
to JIA; 
3. No active uveitis; 
4. Normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ie, <20 mm/hour[h]) or CRP (<1.0 mg/dL or <10 mg/L), 
5. Physician Global Assessment of disease activity indicating no active disease (≤5 mm on the VAS). 
6. Duration of morning stiffness <15 minutes. 
Sample size 
Power calculations were performed using a chi-squared test with flare of JIA disease as the response 
variable and treatment group as the dependent variable. Assuming 65% and 37% of subjects 
experienced a flare of disease from Week 16 through Week 48 for the placebo + MTX, and 30 mg/m2 
+ MTX treatment groups respectively, 134 subjects who were responders at Week 16 (67 subjects 
from each treatment group) would be required to enter the randomized withdrawal portion of the 
study to obtain 90% power to detect a significant difference between treatment groups. These 
percentages of disease flares were observed in the adalimumab study in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 
(JRA). 
In addition, the power arising from different randomization ratios of subjects entering the randomized 
withdrawal portion of the study was also examined. There was no marked difference in power based on 
the results observed.  
Assuming an 85% response rate at Week 16, the 95% confidence interval for the response rate would 
be (79%, 91%). Using the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval, 170 subjects were required to 
be initiated into the study at Week 0. 
Recruitment was stopped when 30 subjects were enrolled. When these 30 subjects reached Week 8, 
interim analyses for PK (including the population PK analyses), efficacy and safety were performed; if 
more than 8 of the first 30 subjects enrolled in the study were ACR Ped 30 responders at Week 8 and 
the PK analyses confirmed the dosing strategy, the study was permitted to continue.  
After approximately 120 subjects completed the Week 16 visit, another interim analysis was 
performed. The response rate of subjects at Week 16 was evaluated to ensure the likelihood that at 
least 134 subjects would participate in the randomized withdrawal portion of the study. To qualify for 
randomized withdrawal, subjects had to be ACR Ped 30 responders at Week 16. Subjects with a 
transient worsening of clinical status between Weeks 0 and 16 and not requiring changes in their 
concomitant medications could still qualify for randomization at Week 16 if they were ACR Ped 30 
responders at Week 16 
Randomisation and blinding 
At Week 16, subjects who achieved an ACR Ped 30 response were randomized in a 1:1 ratio in a

blinded fashion to 1 of 2 treatment groups: 
Golimumab:  Subjects received golimumab 30 mg/m2 SC injection (maximum 50 mg) at Week 16, 
and q4w thereafter through Week 48. Subjects also received commercial MTX weekly 
at the same numerical (mg/week of MTX) dose as at the time of study entry. 
Placebo: 
Subjects received placebo as a SC injection at Week 16 and q4w thereafter through 
Week 48 unless they experienced a flare of disease at which time golimumab 30 
mg/m2 SC injections (maximum 50 mg) were resumed. Subjects also continued to 
receive commercial MTX weekly at the same numerical (mg/week of MTX) dose as at 
the time of study entry. 
For subjects receiving placebo at the time of a flare of disease, treatment with golimumab 30 mg/m2 
q4w was reinitiated at the next scheduled visit. For subjects receiving golimumab 30 mg/m2 at the 
time of a flare of disease, the golimumab dose did not change. 
Subjects were planned to continue active treatment after Week 48 in the LTE until Week 248, with 
follow-up through Week 256. At Week 48, subjects who received placebo + MTX who were not in 
clinical remission while on medication for JIA were to begin receiving golimumab 30 mg/m2 SC in a 
blinded fashion. After the Week 48 DBL and site unblinding, investigators were to begin administering 
golimumab 30 mg/m2 SC to subjects receiving SC placebo who were not in clinical remission. After the 
Week 48 DBL and site unblinding, subjects who were still receiving SC placebo and who were in clinical 
remission while on medication for JIA, were to be discontinued from the study. 
Statistical methods 
All efficacy analyses were based on an intent-to-treat (ITT) principle.  Therefore, the efficacy data for 
each subject were analysed according to the assigned treatment regardless of the actual treatment 
received.  To maintain the Type I error rate among the primary and major secondary endpoints, the 
endpoints were tested sequentially. 
The data handling rules for the ITT population include LOCF (last observation carried forward) of partial 
data, non-responder imputation of completely missing data, and treatment failure rules. 
For subjects who were terminated due to the Applicant decision, no data imputation was performed 
after the termination date. 
In addition to the ITT analyses, after the Week 48 DBL, selected efficacy data was also summarized 
using observed data alone, without any data manipulation. No imputation was performed when data 
was missing. 
Safety, PK and immunogenicity data were summarized for all subjects who received at least one (full 
or partial) administration of study agent.

Results 
Participant flow  
At Week 0, 173 subjects enrolled and received golimumab + MTX, and by Week 16, 19 subjects 
discontinued the study. Of the 154 remaining subjects, 78 subjects were randomized to golimumab + 
MTX, and 76 subjects were randomized to placebo + MTX at Week 16 (Table 2).

Per protocol, subjects who experienced a flare of disease while receiving placebo could resume 
golimumab 30 mg/m2 SC injections (maximum 50 mg), and of the 76 subjects in the placebo + MTX 
group, 44 (57.9%) remained on placebo + MTX and 32 (42.1%) received golimumab + MTX for flare. 
One subject in the placebo + MTX group received golimumab 30 mg/m2 + MTX, but never flared.

Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 33 sites globally and enrolled 173 subjects. For this report, data were 
locked at Week 48. 
The study was planned to continue to Week 256; however, the primary and major secondary efficacy 
endpoints at Week 48 were not met, and the applicant decided to discontinue the study prematurely. 
The last dose of study agent was administered on 31 Mar 2014, and the last subject last visit was 27 
May 2014. Of the 154 subjects randomized at Week 16, 121 (78.6%) remained in the study until it 
was prematurely discontinued by the Applicant on 31 Mar 2014.  At the time of study discontinuation, 
129 subjects had completed through Week 96, 1 subject had completed through Week 168, and no 
subjects completed the final Week 256 assessment. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 9 amendments to the protocol. None of these protocol amendments impacted the validity 
of the study results. 
97 subjects had protocol deviations, categorized as follows: 
• 
Entered study, but study entry criteria not met: 18 (10.4%) 
•  Met study withdrawal criteria, but not withdrawn: 1 (0.6%) 
•  Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose: 9 (5.2%) 
•  Received disallowed concomitant treatment: 3 (1.7%) 
•  Other: 85 (49.1%) 
The number of deviations was balanced across the combined placebo + MTX and golimumab + MTX 
groups (data not shown). 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics of enrolled subjects at baseline are presented in Table 3.

Table 3. Summary of demographics at baseline in study CNTO148JIA3001 
Baseline clinical disease characteristics are summarised in Table 4. 
The enrolled subjects who did not respond had a higher median number of joints with a limited range 
of motion (11.0) and a higher CHAQ (1.38) than those subjects who were ACR 30 responders at Week 
16. Additionally, all treatment groups had median ESR levels in the normal range, <20 mm/h, and 
median CRP levels in the normal range, <1.0 mg/dL. By the ILAR classification, the majority (52.0%) 
of enrolled subjects had polyarticular RF-negative JIA, and 15 (8.7%) subjects had JPsA. 
All enrolled subjects had joints with active arthritis, and 52.6% to 64.5% of the subjects across the 
treatment groups had morning stiffness greater than 15 minutes. 
Across treatment groups, 85.7% to 100% of subjects had received prior corticosteroid injections and 
14.3% to 17.4% of subjects had undergone prior arthrocentesis. 
Baseline CHQ subscale scores indicated that enrolled subjects with JIA showed impaired health-related 
quality of life with values below the mean of generally healthy populations in CHQ scale scores, 
especially in the general health, bodily pain/discomfort, parent impact - emotional and parent impact – 
time scales.

randomised subjects 
A medication or therapy was considered concomitant at baseline if it had been used both prior to and 
after the first study agent administration. The proportions of subjects at baseline taking oral 
corticosteroids or NSAIDs specifically for JIA were generally similar in both randomised groups 
The median dose of prednisone was the same in all groups (data not shown). 
Numbers analysed 
Through Week 16, all subjects received golimumab 30 mg/m2 + MTX. At Week 16, subjects were 
randomised 1:1 to receive golimumab 30 mg/m2 + MTX or placebo + MTX. Efficacy analyses for the 
primary and major secondary endpoints are based on the intent-to-treat population and are reported 
for the 2 randomized treatment groups, golimumab + MTX and placebo + MTX. Subjects remained on 
placebo unless they experienced a flare of disease at which time golimumab administrations were 
resumed. Of the 76 subjects randomized to placebo, 33 (43.4%) subjects received golimumab 30 
mg/m2 + MTX. The subjects were treated as ACR Ped non-responders for analysis purposes and, thus, 
could not be deemed to have inactive disease or qualify for clinical remission while on medication.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who were ACR Ped 30 responders at Week 16 and 
did not experience a flare of disease between Week 16 and Week 48, and these results are 
summarised in Table 5. 
Table 5. Number of subjects who did not flare from Week 16 through Week 48 in study 
CNTO148JIA3001; randomised subjects 
Major Secondary Endpoints 
The proportion of randomised subjects who achieved an ACR Ped 30 response at Week 16 with ACR 
Ped 30 response at Week 48 was 52.6% (41) subjects in the golimumab group compared with the 
placebo group 55.3% (41; p = 0.751). In addition, 51%, 47%, and 39% of patients in the golimumab 
+ MTX group were, ACR Ped 50, ACR Ped 70, and ACR Ped 90 responders, respectively 
The proportion of randomised subjects who achieved an ACR Ped 30 response at Week 16 and had 
inactive disease at Week 48 was 39.7% (31) subjects in the golimumab group compared with the 
placebo group 27.6% (21; p = 0.119). 
The proportion of randomised subjects who achieved an ACR Ped 30 response at Week 16 and were in 
clinical remission while on medication for JIA at Week 48 was 12.8% (10) subjects in the golimumab 
group compared with the placebo group 11.8% (n=9, p = 0.848). 
Subgroup analysis by CRP levels 
The median baseline (Week 0) CRP in the CNTO148JIA3001 study (0.17 mg/dL) was low and within 
the normal range of the assay used (≤1.0 mg/dL). Pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary 
endpoint by baseline CRP (≥1 mg/dL vs <1 mg/dL) demonstrated higher flare rates in placebo + MTX 
vs golimumab + MTX treated subjects among subjects with baseline CRP ≥1 mg/dL (87% vs 40%, 
p=0.0068). 
Additional post-hoc analysis was performed to evaluate the primary and secondary endpoints in 
subgroups of patients by baseline CRP levels (≥0.02 to ≥ 1.0 mg/dL). Results from this analysis are 
presented in Table 6 and Figures 11 and 12 for all randomised subjects, those with ACR Ped 30 
response at week 48 and those with inactive disease at week 48 respectively.

Comparison of golimumab with other biologics authorised for pJIA 
Of the TNF-inhibitors, Enbrel and Humira are approved for the pJIA indication. The studies supporting 
this indication had generally the same design as the Simponi study. Baseline characteristics in those 
trials and main results are presented in Tables 10 and 11.

Efficacy and Antibodies to golimumab 
In study CNTO148JIA3001, subjects were evaluated for having a positive or negative status for 
antibodies to golimumab with the drug-tolerant enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method.  
When immunogenicity was evaluated at the time of flare, 33.3% of subjects on placebo + MTX and 
25.0% of subjects on golimumab 30 mg/m2 + MTX had antibodies to golimumab. The range of titers 
between the 2 groups was also similar. Additionally, the incidence of antibodies of golimumab in those 
who continued on golimumab and flared (28.1%; 9/32) was similar to those who continued golimumab 
and did not flare (32.6%; 15/46). 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Golimumab 30 mg/m2 SC q4w was evaluated in a single, randomized-withdrawal, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study (CNTO148JIA3001) to determine its efficacy and safety in treating paediatric 
subjects (2 to 17 years of age) with pJIA. 
The study consisted of a 16-week open label portion with golimumab administration q4w + MTX 
administered weekly for 12 weeks followed by a randomized withdrawal portion comparing placebo + 
MTX administered weekly and golimumab administration q4w + MTX administered weekly for 32 
weeks. The demographic characteristics of the study population at Week 0 and at Week 16 were well 
balanced across treatment groups. The baseline characteristics of this population were consistent with 
moderate to severe disease activity in subjects with pJIA with a median joint count of 12 joints with 
active arthritis, a median joint count of 8 joints with limited range of motion and visual analogue 
scores ranging from 4.5 to 5.4 cm. Subjects had mild to moderate disability as reflected in the median 
CHAQ score at baseline of 0.94. Baseline levels of inflammation by ESR (median 16 mm/h; normal <20 
mm/h) and CRP (median 0.17 mg/dL; normal <1.0 mg/dL) were within the normal range. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Responses in the open label period 
After 16 weeks of open label golimumab treatment, the proportions of subjects achieving ACR Ped 30, 
50, 70, and 90 responses were robust (ACR Ped 30: 87.3%, ACR Ped 50: 79.2%, ACR Ped 70: 65.9%, 
ACR Ped 90: 36.4%) as was the proportion of subjects with inactive disease (37.7%). These results 
indicate a positive effect of golimumab on active pJIA and are comparable to what has been reported 
for other TNF inhibitors (74-94% ACR Ped 30). 
In addition, evaluation of the individual ACR Ped components for all enrolled subjects demonstrated 
clinically important changes, particularly for the number of joints with active arthritis, the number of 
joints with limited range of motion, and physician’s global assessment of disease activity (VAS 0-10 
cm). 
The proportions of treated subjects with inactive disease also increased over time and at Week 16 was 
34% of all the enrolled subjects. Improvements in physical function and health related quality of life, 
as measured by the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) and the Child Health 
Questionnaire (CHQ), respectively, were also observed during the open label period A decrease of 
0.188 in CHAQ score has been determined to be a meaningful improvement. At Week 16, median 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404217/2016  
Page 35/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
improvement in CHAQ score was 0.38 in all enrolled subjects. 
Randomised withdrawal phase 
The randomized withdrawal portion of the study did not demonstrate a difference in flare rates 
between subjects randomized to the golimumab + MTX group (59.0%) and the placebo + MTX group 
(52.6%, p=0.414). There are several potential reasons which could explain this lack of differentiation 
between the different arms in this trial.  
Neither inadequate serum trough concentrations nor immunogenicity seem to have been important 
contributing factors to the lack of statistical significance between the 2 randomised groups for the 
primary and major secondary endpoints. 
The most plausible explanation is an inadequate inflammatory burden in subjects randomised in the 
study at baseline. The median baseline (Week 0) CRP in study CNTO148JIA3001 (0.17 mg/dL) was low 
and within the normal range of the assay used. This was in contrast to baseline values in studies 
performed over the past 10 years in JRA and JIA with different anti TNFα and non-anti-TNFα biologics 
in which the median baseline CRP levels were higher than observed in the current study.  
Pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint by baseline CRP (≥1 mg/dL vs <1 mg/dL) 
demonstrated higher flare rates in placebo + MTX vs golimumab + MTX treated subjects among 
subjects with baseline CRP ≥1 mg/dL (87% vs 40%). Additionally, post-hoc analyses evaluated flare 
rates based upon Week 0 CRP levels ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mg/dL. These analyses demonstrated 
that, in general, among subjects with baseline CRP levels >0.1 mg/dL, subjects who received 
continued golimumab + MTX therapy had significantly fewer flare episodes than subjects who were 
randomized to placebo + MTX at Week 16. 
Among golimumab-treated subjects with CRP >0.7 mg/dL, 35% in the golimumab group and 80% in 
the placebo group experienced a flare from week 16 through week 48 (p=0.004). This is in line with a 
previous adalimumab in pJIA study, where median CRP at baseline was 0.7-0.8 mg/dL, and the flare 
rates were 37% and 65% respectively. The flare rate in the placebo group in the adalimumab study 
was in turn lower than for etanercept, which included subjects with higher baseline median CRP than 
adalimumab (3.2mg/dL vs 0.7-0.8mg/dL). The average number of active joints at baseline was also 
considerably higher in the etanercept study. These figures support the hypothesis that higher 
inflammatory activity at baseline concurred with a higher flare rate in the placebo group, although they 
should be interpreted with caution, since these are comparisons between studies.  
Another possible explanation is that the level of disease suppression achieved in the first 16 weeks of 
open label drug administration may have led to prolonged suppression of disease that might not have 
been fully elucidated in a 32-week randomized withdrawal period. This is supported to some extent by 
literature reports (Lovell DJ et al, Pediatric Rheumatology 2014) which have shown that anti-TNFs have 
a prolonged therapeutic effect on JIA control that lasts beyond their pharmacological half-life. Even 
though for the agents included in this study an effect was seen within the time period of the 
randomised withdrawal phase in study CNTO148JIA3001, it cannot be excluded that the level of 
suppression of the disease by golimumab may require an even longer time period before a negative 
effect of the treatment withdrawal can be demonstrated. 
The median percent improvements from baseline in ACR Ped components at Week 48 continued to 
show pronounced improvement in disease activity in both randomized treatment groups. At Week 48, 
53%, 51%, 47%, and 39% of patients in the golimumab + MTX group were ACR Ped 30, ACR Ped 50, 
ACR Ped 70, and ACR Ped 90 responders, respectively), and 40% achieved inactive disease.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404217/2016  
Page 36/65 
 
 
 
 
 
Consistent results were also observed in the major secondary endpoints, when analysed by baseline 
CRP as a greater proportion of subjects achieved ACR Ped 30 response, as well as inactive disease, in 
the golimumab + MTX group compared with the placebo + MTX group in subjects with higher baseline 
CRP. 
After Week 48 through the final DBL, with a median follow-up of approximately 2 years, efficacy 
responses were generally similar over time in subjects continuing golimumab. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The totality of the data from study CNTO148JIA3001 support that golimumab in combination with MTX 
is efficacious in the treatment of pJIA. ACR Ped 30, 50, 70, and 90 responses at Week 16 were high 
and demonstrated that clinically meaningful improvements in disease activity were experienced by 
subjects during the open-label period. 
The subgroup analyses demonstrating that for a subpopulation with elevated CRP at baseline, more 
similar to the population studied for the successful studies of etanercept and adalimumab, the primary 
endpoint was met, further supports this conclusion. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 173 subjects were enrolled at Week 0 and received at least 1 dose of golimumab. One 
hundred fifty-four (154) of the 173 subjects entered the randomized withdrawal period at Week 16. 
The summaries of safety data presented are based on the 154 randomized subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of study agent during this study. The average duration of follow-up for all randomized 
patients was 107 weeks or 26 administrations of golimumab and the average exposure to golimumab 
was 22 administrations of golimumab. The total subject-years of follow-up was 318. For all randomized 
subjects through the final DBL, the median cumulative dose of golimumab was 821.50 mg (range: 
142.0-2045.0 mg. 
Data sets were analysed for the following treatment groups:  
  Placebo + MTX: Subjects who were treated with golimumab from Week 0 to Week 12, and who 
received placebo + MTX at Week 16 and continued on placebo + MTX. 
  Placebo + MTX → Golimumab 30 mg/m2 + MTX prior to W48: Subjects who were treated with 
golimumab from Week 0 to Week 12, and who received placebo + MTX at Week 16 and 
switched to golimumab 30 mg/m2 + MTX prior to Week 48 and remained on golimumab 
through the end of study. 
  Placebo + MTX → Golimumab 30 mg/m2 + MTX at or after W48: Subjects who were treated 
with golimumab from Week 0 to Week 12, and who received placebo + MTX at Week 16 and 
switched to golimumab 30 mg/m2 + MTX at or after Week 48 and remained on golimumab 
through end of study.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
From Week 0 through the final DBL, the proportion of randomized subjects experiencing at least 1 SAE 
was comparable among the treatment groups. 
•  All randomized subjects: 22.7% 
•  Golimumab 30 mg/m2 + MTX: 23.1% 
•  Combined placebo + MTX: 22.4% 
The SOCs with the highest incidence of SAEs for all randomized subjects through the final DBL were 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (12.3%) and Infections and infestations (5.8%). 
The most common SAEs were: 
• 
JIA: 15 (9.7%) subjects in the all randomized subjects groups, 8 (10.3%) subjects in the 
golimumab 30 mg/m2 + MTX group and 7 (9.2%) subjects in the combined placebo + MTX

subject in the golimumab 30 mg/m2 + MTX group and 1 (1.3%) subject in the combined 
placebo + MTX group. 
All other SAEs were singular events, including an event of demyelination, which was reported through 
the final DBL. There was also clinically important hepatobiliary event (hepatitis toxic) through the final 
DBL which resolved while the subject continued golimumab treatment. 
There were no malignancies, active tuberculosis infections, or opportunistic infections observed in the 
CNTO148JIA3001 pJIA study through the final DBL. 
The incidence of SAEs per hundred subject-years of follow-up through the final DBL was 20.44 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 15.77, 26.05) for all randomized subjects. 
No deaths were reported through the final DBL.

Comparison of safety data between adult patients and children with JIA exposed to 
golimumab 
Five Phase 3 pivotal studies formed the basis for approval of Simponi in the rheumatologic indications. 
Three studies were conducted in subjects with RA (C0524T05, C0524T06, and C0524T11), 1 in 
subjects with PsA (C0524T08), and 1 in subjects with AS (C0524T09). Safety displays through Week 
16 represent the longest common placebo-controlled period prior to early escape for the 5 adult 
rheumatologic Phase 3 studies. At Week 16 in 4 of the 5 studies (C0524T06, C0524T11, C0524T08, 
and C0524T09), placebo subjects were allowed to “escape” to active treatment with golimumab 50 mg 
q4w, and golimumab 50 mg subjects were allowed to escape to treatment with golimumab 100 mg 
q4w (in study C0524T05, the early escape was available at Week 28). All placebo subjects who did not 
enter early escape at Week 16 crossed over to active golimumab treatment at Week 24 in studies 
C0524T06, C0524T08, C0524T09, and C0524T11, and most placebo subjects crossed over to 
golimumab at Week 52 in study C0524T05. 
Safety analyses included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 administration of study 
agent, and were summarized by actual treatment received: 
• 
Placebo: Subjects treated with placebo at Week 0 through Week 16. 
•  Golimumab 50 mg: Subjects treated with golimumab 50 mg at Week 0 through Week 16. 
•  Golimumab 100 mg: Subjects treated with golimumab 100 mg at Week 0 through Week 16. 
•  Combined (golimumab): All subjects treated with golimumab (50 mg and 100 mg) at Week 0 
through Week 16.

In general, the frequency, type, and severity of the adverse reactions seen in children in pJIA study 
CNTO148JIA3001 were comparable to those observed in adults in the RA and rheumatology studies 
and no new safety events were observed in CNTO148JIA3001.  
Through Week 16 of the studies, 68.2% of subjects in the pJIA study (all enrolled subjects) and 67.7% 
in the adult RA studies (50 mg group) and 67.9% of the adult rheumatologic studies (50 mg group) 
experienced at least 1 AE. (Table 13).

The nature of infections between paediatric and adult subjects was different, with respiratory tract 
infection, tonsillitis, gastroenteritis, otitis media, pyrexia, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and influenza-like 
illness the most commonly type of infections reported in the pJIA study. Pneumonia and urinary tract 
infection were more commonly reported in the adult RA studies (data not shown). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Of the 173 subjects who were enrolled in the pJIA study at Week 0 and received at least 1 dose of 
golimumab, 154 entered the randomized withdrawal period at Week 16.  
The majority (68%) of the enrolled subjects experienced at least 1 AE during the first 16 weeks, and 
most (92%) experienced at least 1 AE through the end of the study. This was in line with previously 
conducted adult RA studies with golimumab.  
During the open label part of the study, 39% of the subjects experienced an infection however the 
paediatric population is known to be particularly susceptible to infections. In addition, infections are a 
known identified risk for golimumab as described in the Risk Management Plan. Other SOCs with high 
proportions of AEs during the first 16 weeks were gastrointestinal disorders (20%), general disorders 
and administration site conditions (12%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (12%) and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (11%). The reported PTs within these groups were 
also in line with the known safety profile of golimumab. 
The same pattern of events to the open label phase of the study was reported through the DBL.  
Of the serious adverse events reported, other than infections and events related to the treated 
condition in the study, there was 1 case of demyelination which is a known ADR for golimumab. A case 
of toxic hepatitis was also reported, which resolved during treatment, thus a correlation with 
golimumab was considered to be unlikely. 
The higher incidence of all AEs in children appears to be largely driven by the higher incidence of 
infections in children. Children are known to have generally increased susceptibility to infections 
compared to adults. A key reason for this is limited previous exposure to diseases, resulting in no 
developed immunity to these diseases whilst environmental issues can also play a role. Children in day 
care and school circulate infections and take them home to siblings. This, combined with  higher  
potential  for  poor  hygiene  practices,  increases  exposure  and  susceptibility  to infections. The 
types of infections most commonly reported in the trials for children was different to those in adults 
and representative of typical infections in this population. Importantly however, incidences  of serious 
infections between the paediatric and adult populations were similar. 
The SmPC contains extensive warnings in relation to Sections 4.4 and 4.8 from the information 
available from the adult population and these are considered applicable and sufficient to minimise the 
risk in the paediatric population as well. Furthermore, as there are limited data on the response to 
vaccination with live vaccines or on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404217/2016  
Page 44/65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
receiving anti-TNF therapy it is recommended in the SmPC that prior to initiating golimumab therapy, 
paediatric patients, are brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with current 
immunisation guidelines. In addition, monitoring of the long-term safety of golimumab in the 
treatment of JIA will be done through a registry included in the Risk Management Plan, focusing 
especially on serious infections including opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, lymphoma 
(excluding HSTCL), autoimmune processes, skin cancer and malignancies. 
Overall, the safety profile of golimumab in combination with MTX in the JIA population, including the 
type and frequency of the adverse reactions seen, was consistent with the known safety profile of 
golimumab in the studied RA, PsA, and AS adult populations. Even if indirect comparisons between 
different studies and populations included are difficult to interpret, the incidence of the adverse events 
of interest appear to support a similar safety profile for golimumab between paediatric and adult 
patients.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of golimumab is well characterised through a number of clinical trials in the adult 
population. The study in children with JIA did not reveal any new safety concerns to those which had 
been previously identified from studies with adults. Warnings in the SmPC and studies included in the 
RMP are considered adequate to minimise the known risks and further characterise the use of 
golimumab in paediatric patients.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The PSUR cycle for the medicinal product should follow a 3-yearly cycle until otherwise agreed by the 
CHMP. 
The next data lock point will be 07 April 2017.  
The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 13.3 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice with some minor amendments on the safety concerns which will be 
addressed through the JIA Registry.   
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by CHMP.

A separate SmPC for each strength 
is available. 
The Applicant has minimised this 
potential for medication error by 
developing a packaging design that 
clearly differentiates the 2 strengths 
(50 mg and 100 mg). This will serve 
to ensure that the different 
presentations are distinct enough for 
healthcare professionals and patients 
to distinguish between and reduce 
any potential medication errors 
related to the injection of the wrong 
strength.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Clinically meaningful efficacy was observed with golimumab + MTX treatment in all disease parameters 
during the open-label phase of the study through Week 16. This included ACR Ped responses which 
were observed as early as Week 4 and the proportions of treated subjects with ACR Ped 30, 50, 70, 
and 90 responses increased over time through Week 16. The proportion of subjects who were ACR Ped 
responders at Week 16 were high (ACR Ped 30: 87.3%, ACR Ped 50: 79.2%, ACR Ped 70: 65.9%, ACR 
Ped 90: 36.4%)  
In ACR Ped components through Week 16 there were substantial clinically important improvements. 
Median percent improvements were 92% in number of active joints; 80% in number of joints with 
limited range of motion; 88% in physician global assessment of disease; 67% in parent assessment of 
overall well-being; 50% in physical function by CHAQ; and 33% in ESR. 
The proportions of treated subjects with inactive disease increased over time and at Week 16 was 34% 
in all enrolled subjects.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The primary and major secondary endpoints were not met; however analyses showed that the 
unexpectedly low inflammatory burden of the enrolled population (in comparison to studies performed 
over the past 10 years in JIA with different anti-TNFα) could potentially explains these findings. 
This is supported by a differentiation in non-flare rates between subjects continuing treatment with 
golimumab + MTX versus placebo + MTX from Week 16 through Week 48 in the pre-specified 
subgroup analysis of subjects with baseline CRP of at least 1.0 mg/dL and post-hoc subgroup analyses 
among subjects with CRP levels >0.1 mg/dL at baseline. Placebo subjects in the higher CRP subsets 
experienced more flares compared with the placebo subjects in the entire population, with placebo 
flare rates in the higher CRP subsets more consistent with those observed in previous pJIA studies. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile of golimumab which is known for studies in other rheumatological conditions 
in adults such as RA, PsA, and AS were also confirmed in the pJIA population. Through Week 48, the 
proportion of subjects experiencing at least 1 AE was comparable in the treatment groups, 84.6% in 
the Golimumab + MTX group and 93.4% in the combined Placebo group. . Adverse events that 
occurred in ≥5% of all subjects included URTI (23.1%), nasopharyngitis (16.2%), JIA (15.0%), 
pyrexia (12.1%), headache (11.6%), nausea (9.2%), abdominal pain (8.7%), oropharyngeal pain and 
vomiting (6.9% each), abdominal pain upper, diarrhea, gastroenteritis, and respiratory tract infection 
(6.4% each), and urticaria (5.2%). There were no meaningful differences noted between treatment 
arms. 
Comparisons to safety results in earlier Adult RA studies showed that paediatric incidences were similar 
to adult incidences for serious infections. Paediatric incidences were lower than adult incidences for AEs 
leading to discontinuation and for injections with injection-site reactions. Paediatric incidences were 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/404217/2016  
Page 62/65 
 
 
 
 
 
higher than adults for AEs, serious adverse events (SAE), and infections. The higher incidence of all 
AEs in children appears to be largely driven by the higher incidence of infections in children.  Given 
that children have an increased susceptibility to infections compared to adults, the higher infection rate 
in the paediatric population is not unexpected. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Exposure to golimumab in paediatric patients with pJIA is limited, and therefore the long term safety 
effects of golimumab in this population are not extensively characterised. This will be addressed 
through a registry which will allow the collection of further long term data through evaluation of the 
risk of serious infections, malignancies and autoimmune disorders in this population and which has 
been included in the Risk Management Plan of Simponi.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Clinically relevant short-term efficacy of golimumab in the treatment of pJIA has been shown. The 
most relevant safety concerns of identified so far are related to infections. Appropriate measures to 
minimise this risk are included in the SmPC and further information on this issue will be collected as 
described in the RMP. Additional evidence of efficacy and safety can be extrapolated from relevant data

in adult patients. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The evolution of knowledge of pJIA has established that there is sufficient similarity between adult 
rheumatoid arthritis and paediatric pJIA in terms of disease progression and response to anti-TNFα 
agents. In this context, the open-label efficacy data from study CNTO148JIA3001 are considered 
sufficient to demonstrate the significant benefit of golimumab in pJIA. In addition, drug exposure in 
children using the proposed dosing appears to be similar to adults treated with Simponi 50mg q4w and 
PK-modelling indicates a dose response relationship. Given that disease progression and response to 
anti-TNFα therapy are believed to be similar between children and adults, the pharmacokinetic data, 
exposure-response modelling, and clinical efficacy through Week 16 would be considered sufficient 
evidence of benefit in the framework of extrapolation. 
No new safety signals have emerged from the study in pJIA.  The safety profile of golimumab in 
paediatric patients appears consistent with that in adults. 
The totality of available data from study CNTO148JIA3001, together with the reasonable extrapolation 
of efficacy, PK and safety from the adult to the paediatric population confirms the positive benefit-risk 
balance for golimumab in pJIA in children with a body weight of at least 40 kg, who have responded 
inadequately to previous therapy with MTX. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.4  
C.I.4 - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of 
Type II 
I, IIIA and

approved one 
Extension of indication to add a new indication for Simponi in the treatment of polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis in combination with methotrexate in children with a body weight of at least 40 kg, 
who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with methotrexate; consequently, SmPC 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 have been revised to include new efficacy, PK and safety 
information. The Package Leaflet and RMP have been updated accordingly. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

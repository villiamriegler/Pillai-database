1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Janssen-Cilag  International  N.V.  submitted  on  22  June  2012  an  application  for 
Marketing  Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMA)  for  Invokana,  through  the 
centralised procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 17 
November 2011. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Invokana is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as: 
Monotherapy 
When diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom 
the use of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications. 
Add-on therapy 
Add-on therapy with other anti-hyperglycaemic agents including insulin, when these, together 
with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5, and 5.1 
for available data on different add-on therapies). 
The legal basis for this application refers to Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and 
independent application. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, 
non-clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic 
literature substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/164/2011 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/164/2011 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The prevalence of diabetes worldwide is rising rapidly and is estimated to reach 4.4% of the world’s 
population or approximately 366 million people by 2030. The long-term manifestations of diabetes 
contribute to its status as a leading cause of premature illness and mortality worldwide. 
There are currently agents from a number of different classes that are available for the treatment 
of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
. Most patients with T2DM are initially managed with single-agent therapy, usually metformin. 
Despite initial monotherapy, many patients have progressive loss of glycaemic control, requiring 
combinations of agents, and often eventually insulin therapy. Underlying this progressive 
deterioration in glycaemic control is a gradual loss of beta-cell function. 
Many of the current T2DM treatments are associated with safety or tolerability issues, including 
hypoglycemia, edema, or gastrointestinal adverse experiences which can limit dose and hence 
therapeutic benefit. Further, some of the current anti-hyperglycaemic agents (AHAs) are associated 
with weight gain, which is particularly problematic as over 85% of patients with T2DM are 
overweight and obese. Additional weight gain can increase insulin resistance, an underlying 
pathophysiologic mechanism of T2DM. Only few AHAs (eg, metformin and glucagon-like peptide-1 
[GLP-1] analogues) lead to weight loss. 
There is a need for novel treatment options for T2DM, due to the increasing global prevalence of 
the disease, its progressive nature which eventually requires combination therapy in most patients 
as well as the undesirable effects of currently available therapies. 
2.2. Quality aspects

Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013  
Page 14/115 
 
 
 
 
2.2.2. Active Substance 
The chemical name of canagliflozin hemihydrate is (1S)-1,5-anhydro-1-[3-[[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-
thienyl]-methyl]-4-methylphenyl]-D-glucitol hemihydrate  and has the following structure: 
Canagliflozin hemihydrate is a white to off-white powder, practically insoluble in water and freely 
soluble in ethanol and non-hygroscopic. The particle size distribution is controlled to ensure a 
consistent finished product manufacturing process; studies showed that the particle size has no 
impact to the performance in vivo.  
Canagliflozin exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of five chiral centres. The 
diastereomeric purity of the drug substance is controlled by an achiral assay/purity HPLC method. 
Polymorphism has been observed for canagliflozin: the manufactured form I is a hemihydrate, and 
an unstable amorphous Form II. Form I is consistently produced by the proposed commercial 
synthesis process. As the manufacturing process consists of several recrystallization steps and 
polymorphic form II is amorphous it is accepted not to implement XRD test to the specification of 
the active substance. 
Manufacture 
Canagliflozin is manufactured by one source and is synthesized in four main synthetic steps plus 
two purification steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
The five isolations by crystallization in combination with the design of the manufacturing process 
result in a process with a high purifying capability. As a result, the early steps of the synthesis 
outside GMP control are not anticipated to impact on the quality of the active substance. 
Process validation on three consecutive batches has been completed successfully. The validation 
batches were tested with the validated analytical methods used for batch release. The analytical 
results demonstrate that all validation batches meet the proposed specification limits. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The manufacturing process yields one diastereoisomer of the active substance. It is not necessary 
to perform a test for chiral purity on canagliflozin as the impurity is controlled by the general 
analytical method for impurities.

Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identity (IR, UV), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), heavy metals (Ph.Eur.), residue on 
ignition (Ph. Eur.), and particle size distribution. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data on nine commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on six commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package in a container closure system representative of that 
intended for the market were provided for the following time/ICH conditions: 9 months under long 
term conditions at 25 ºC / 60 % RH, 9 months under intermediate conditions at 30 ºC / 75 % RH 
and up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75 % RH.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed. Results on stress conditions 
(including high temperature, acid, alkaline, oxidising) were also provided. The active substance is 
stable at high temperature and humidity and degrades moderately under basic and peroxide 
conditions. Canagliflozin is unstable under photolytic and radical oxidation conditions.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, chromatographic purity, water content 
and particle size. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating. No trends were observed. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3. Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is 100 mg or 300 mg film-coated tablets manufactured by fluid-bed 
granulation. Both strengths are manufactured from a common granulation blend. The film-coated 
tablets are capsule-shaped, film-coated with different colours for each strength and debossed for 
identification. The product is packed in PVC/Al blisters. The compositions of the Opadry mixes were 
presented. 
A satisfactory formulation development is provided. The development began with an oral 
suspension and progressed to wet fluid bed granulation. Results from high shear granulation as 
well as fluid bed are included. The aim was to use a dose proportional formulation that could be 
compressed as multiple strengths. A high active substance load was necessary to avoid large 
tablets. Design of experiments was used to evaluate the influence of particle size, filler ratio, 
disintegrant level and binder level, as well as lubricant level and blend time. No design space was 
claimed. 
There are no major differences between the manufacturing process used for the clinical trials 
batches and that proposed for marketing. To note that the manufacturing process and formulation 
of batches used for Phase 3 Trials and Stability testing are the same as those proposed for 
marketing. A dissolution bridging study was conducted to bridge results from the manufacturer of 
clinical batches (Spring House, Pennsylvania) and commercial manufacturer (Gurabo, Puerto Rico).

Dissolution was tested by the regulatory dissolution method. The discriminatory power of the 
dissolution method was sufficiently demonstrated. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The primary packaging is PVC blisters backed with push-through aluminium foil. The material 
complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
Lactose anhydrous is the single excipient of animal origin use in canagliflozin tablets and is certified 
by the supplier not to contain calf rennet. Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. An acceptable 
BSE/TSE Statement is provided. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of eight main steps: preparation of dry ingredients, 
preparation of the binder solution, preparation of the granulation, sieving and final blending, 
compression, preparation of the film-coating suspension, film-coating of the tablets and packaging.  
The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
A satisfactory process validation scheme to be completed prior to commercial launch was 
submitted.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
identification (IR, UV), appearance, assay (UPLC/HPLC), impurities (UPLC/HPLC and LC-MS/MS), 
dissolution, uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.).   
Batch analysis results are provided for eight 100 mg batches and eighteen 300 mg batches from 
the proposed manufacturing site (commercial scale) confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of three commercial scale batches of each strength of finished product stored under 
long term conditions for 18 months at 25 ºC / 60 % RH, intermediate conditions for 18 months at 
30 ºC / 75 % RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, dissolution, assay, impurities, water content and 
microbiological purity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, photostability studies performed as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products demonstrate that the medicinal product is not 
photosensitive. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life with no special storage conditions as stated in the 
SmPC are acceptable.

2.2.4. Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion 
that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Canagliflozin is an orally active inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2). The low-
affinity/high capacity SGLT2 transporter in the proximal renal tubule reabsorbs the majority of 
glucose filtered by the renal glomerulus. Pharmacological inhibition of SGLT2 is expected to 
decrease renal glucose re-absorption, and thereby increase urinary glucose excretion (UGE) and 
lower plasma glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Canagliflozin has been characterised in a battery of in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic, 
pharmacokinetic, and toxicologic studies. 
A non-clinical testing strategy was followed consistent with the proposed clinical indication, route of 
administration, and dosing regimen (100 and 300 mg QD). The non-clinical development program 
adhered to regulatory guidance for non-clinical development of drugs. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Non-clinical pharmacology studies of canagliflozin have been conducted both in cell-based assays 
and in animal experiments using normal and diabetic animal models. In addition, pivotal studies on 
cardiovascular and pulmonary safety in conscious dogs and neurobehavioral safety in rats were 
conducted, according to GLP, to address the safety pharmacological profile of canagliflozin. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The Applicant has demonstrated the pharmacological activity of canagliflozin in vitro and in animal 
models, normal animals, diabetic (db/db mice and Zucker Diabetic fa/fa (ZDF) rats) and obese 
animals. In vitro studies performed in rat and human demonstrated that canagliflozin has a high 
affinity for human SGLT2 vs SGLT1 (IC50 4.2 nM vs 663 nM). It is agreed that there is a high 
degree of sequence homology between human and rodents and that these used animals are 
relevant models to study canagliflozin. Furthermore, canagliflozin has similar affinity to ratSGLT2 
compared to dapagliflozin, other SGLT2 inhibitor (IC50 3.7 nM and 3.0 nM for canagliflozin and 
dapagliflozin, respectively). However, dapagliflozin has a higher affinity to humanSGLT2 than 
canagliflozin (IC50 1.1 nM compared to 4.2 nM). Regarding SLGT1, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin 
have similar affinity to ratSLGT1 (IC50 555 nM and 620 nM for canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, 
respectively) and around 2x higher affinity for human SGLT1 compared to dapagliflozin (IC50 663 
nM and 1391 nM for canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, respectively).

The primary pharmacological studies in all animal models, including diabetics (db/db mice and ZDF 
rats) and obese mice, showed a dose-dependent (up to 30 mg/kg single dose) increase of UGE and 
reduction of blood glucose levels after a canagliflozin treatment.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies in mice and rats (mildly hyperglycaemic) demonstrated a 
reduction in body weight (or a decrease in weight gain) following repeated administration of 
canagliflozin (2-4 weeks). In one study with older hyperglycaemic, diabetic rats weight gain was 
increased. In general, food intake was not altered during canagliflozin treatment. These findings 
were coupled with improved glucose handling during an OGTT and increases in plasma insulin 
levels and lowering in HbA1c values (hyperglycaemic fa/fa rats). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies were performed to assess the potential effect of canagliflozin 
treatment on the cardiovascular system, CNS and the respiratory system.  
In in vitro safety pharmacology studies canagliflozin showed no effect on the cardiovascular system 
(inhibition of hERG currents, isolated Langendorff perfused rabbit heart) in concentrations up to 1 
µM. Calculated Cmax exposure safety margins for the in vivo cardiovascular and pulmonary assays 
in conscious dogs were 61-times using the 100 mg once daily human dose, and 14-times for the 
300 mg once daily human dose. Canagliflozin did not cause any neurobehavioral changes in rats at 
oral doses up to 1000 mg/kg, and AUC exposure safety margins at the high dose were 214-times 
and 57-times for the 100 and 300 mg once daily clinical doses, respectively (human data taken 
from studies DIA1007 and DIA1023). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Oral administration of canagliflozin resulted in good absorption in mice, dogs, and monkeys. 
However, absorption was markedly reduced in rat. C max was reached rapidly in all species following 
oral administration, with T max values ranging between 1 hour (mouse) and 3.5 hours (monkeys). 
Due to the prolonged oral absorption in rats, Tmax values ranged from 4 to 7 hours following single 
and repeated dosing. The absolute bioavailability was highest in mouse (>100%), probably caused 
by enterohepatic circulation, followed by dog (up to 68%), monkey (49%), and rat (35%). For 
humans absolute bioavailability was 65%. Elimination half-life of canagliflozin was most rapid in 
mice (4 to 5 hours) and slow in rats, dogs, and monkeys (6 to 8 hours). The volume of distribution 
(Vd) of canagliflozin was approximately similar (1.6 to 2.4 l/kg) in the mouse, rat, and monkey, 
and smaller (0.6 to 0.8 l/kg) in the dog (higher than total body water).  
Distribution 
Canagliflozin showed a high protein binding (> 98%) at concentrations below (0.45 µM) and above 
(45 µM) human exposure at the anticipated 100 mg (Cmax of 0.98 µg/ml, 2.2 µM) and 300 mg 
(Cmax of 4.1 µg/ml, 9.3 µM) daily doses throughout species. HSA is likely responsible for the 
majority of canagliflozin protein binding. 
Blood to plasma ratios were highest for rat (0.78 to 1.0), intermediate for human (0.66 to 0.71), 
and lowest for dog (0.51 to 0.61) indicating no distribution of canagliflozin into blood cells. 
Canagliflozin

In distribution studies with 14C-canagliflozin, canagliflozin was found in blood, plasma, and most 
tissues (including eye and skin). Highest concentrations were observed in kidney, liver and 
glandular tissues especially in the renal cortex and the harderian gland. Canagliflozin and its 
metabolites were hardly distributed into brain, bone and white fat. Maximum total radioactivity 
concentrations for blood, plasma, eye, and pigmented skin were 1.30, 1.53, 1.25, and 1.56 µg/g or 
ml at the low dose or 17.8, 22.6, 12.6, and 24.7 µg/g or ml at the high dose, respectively. No 
accumulation in tissues were observed in relevant plasma concentrations, radioactivity levels in 
skin and eye were comparable to those in plasma. This is in particular of interest as a 
photosensitizing potential was claimed for canagliflozin in in vitro and in vivo assays. 
Metabolism  
Twenty metabolites (M1-20) of canagliflozin were detected in in vitro and in vivo metabolism 
studies. All human metabolites were also present in at least one animal species. In vitro studies 
showed that unchanged drug was the major component in human liver microsomes, and in mouse, 
rat, dog, rabbit, and human hepatocytes. M7 O-glucuronide was the major metabolite in mice (27-
46%) and humans (28%) and was also present in the other species. M6 carboxy metabolite was 
formed in hepatocytes of all species and was the main metabolite in male rats (42%) and dogs 
(13%). It was also present in human hepatocytes (2%) but was not formed in human liver 
microsomes. In in vivo studies, unchanged drug was the major component in plasma of all species 
after 24 hours. In human plasma the remaining drug-related products were O-glucoronides M5 and 
M7 and hydroxylated drug metabolite M9 up to 12 hours but not after 24 hours. In dog and rat no 
metabolites were detected in plasma, in mice M7 and M9 were present at lower amounts as 
compared to humans. However, in the toxicity studies with high doses in mice, rats and dogs M5 
and M7 were detected in plasma, liver and kidney. At low doses metabolites M5 and M7 were not 
found in rat plasma faeces and urine but are found as major metabolites in humans in plasma and 
urine (>10% of parent). M7 was the major metabolite found in rat bile, M5 was also present but to 
a lesser extent. Furthermore M7 was formed in rat hepatocytes. M5 and M7 undergo hydrolisation 
in faeces and are therefore not detectable.  
Excretion 
About 90% to 94% of the administered dose was excreted excreted in animal (mouse, rat, and 
dog) faeces. About 2% to 7% of the administered dose was recovered in animal urine. Biliary 
excretion was furthermore tested in mice and rats.  
Taken together, in humans the primary metabolic clearance pathway of canagliflozin is through its 
direct glucuronidation in liver whereas in animal species oxidation is the major metabolic pathway, 
yielding various metabolites not present in humans in vivo (e.g. M1, M2, M4, M6, M8). Human 
plasma levels of O-glucuronides M5 and M7 approached a peak of ~30% of the sample 
radioactivity  
Canagliflozin or its metabolites M5 and M7 did not induce nor inhibit CYPs at clinically relevant 
concentrations (IC50 canagliflozin for the inhibition of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 = 16 and 75 µM, 
respectively; IC50 M5 = 55 and 64 µM, respectively; IC50 canagliflozin for the inhibition of CYP2C9 
= 80 µM and CYP3A4/testosterone = 27 µM). Canagliflozin was not found to be a substrate or 
inhibitor of SLCs or URAT1 but was found to be a substrate for transporters MDR1 and MRP2. 
Canagliflozin crossed the placental barrier. Foetal systemic exposure was approximately the same 
as maternal blood exposure. 
Canagliflozin and its metabolites passed into milk with milk to plasma ratios of 1.05 to 1.55.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
 Single dose toxicity 
Canagliflozin was well tolerated after a single dose in mice (oral gavage and i.p.) and rats (oral 
gavage). The maximum non-lethal oral dose of canagliflozin was 2000 mg/kg (high dose) in mice 
(both sexes) and male rats, and 1000 mg/kg in female rats. The maximum non-lethal i.p. dose of 
canagliflozin was 500 mg/kg in mice and female rats, and 125 mg/kg in male rats. 
 Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity was evaluated in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs dosed for up to 3 months, 6 
months, 5 days, and 1 year, respectively. Generally, various finding were noted in the repeat-
dose toxicity studies within or across species. Most of the observed effects in mice, rats and dogs 
studies were considered to be secondary to the pharmacological action of the substance. The 
Applicant submitted further mechanistic studies to discuss the findings related to hyperostosis, 
renal safety, and stomach erosions in fasted rats.  
In mouse, canagliflozin was well tolerated at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day after 3-month oral 
administration. Effects related to the pharmacological properties of the substance as distention 
cecum and increase glycogen accumulation were observed at doses 25x higher than the human 
exposure.  
In rat, the kidney was a potential target organ for toxicity. Urinalysis changes observed in the 3- 
and 6-month studies were relate to mineralization. An increase in trabecular bone volume 
(hyperostosis) was seen after repeated dose administration to young animals (6 o 8 weeks old at 
the initiation of dosing). When hyperostosis was investigated in mature rats and compared to 
young, hyperostosis was more pronounced in young rats indicating that these findings occurred in 
young actively growing rats. These effects, not observed in any other species, were reversible in 
the 3-month rat study after an 8-week recovery period. Analysis performed in the 3- and 6-month 
rat study did not show change in bone mineral density at any dose or abnormal bone architecture 
(DXA, Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, scanning). Investigation on hyperostosis in rats with 
low calcium diet showed an increase on canagliflozin AUC value from 357 µg.h/ml to 538 µg.h/ml 
compared to rats fed with normal calcium diet and an inhibition of canagliflozin treatment-related 
hyperostosis. A reduction in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calciotin 
were observed in serum as a possible consequence of increases in intestinal calcium absorption. 
The overall conclusion from the mechanistic studies suggested that canagliflozin-mediated 
hyperostosis in rats was related to carbohydrate malabsorption and its sequelae and should not 
be considered of relevance to human safety.  
In dog, the treatment with canagliflozin was well tolerated and a NOAEL of 30 mg/kg/day (more 
than 16x of clinical exposure) was determined based on mortality, clinical observations, renal 
changes associated with urinalysis changes.  
 Genotoxicity 
A standard battery of genotoxicity tests was performed with canagliflozin. Canagliflozin was tested 
in vitro in AMES and mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo in rat bone marrow micronucleus and 
liver Comet assays with no biologically relevant adverse observations.

 Carcinogenicity 
Two GLP-conform carcinogenicity studies were performed in CD-1 mice and SD rats. 
In the mouse study, no treatment related neoplasms nor palpable masses were observed. 
Furthermore, no canagliflozin-mediated effects on mortality, body weight, or body weight gain 
were observed. There was an increase in urinary tract obstruction which was considered to be a 
mouse urologic syndrome which is a relatively common genito-urinary disease of male mice of 
various strains, and is reported to be of multifactorial pathogenesis that frequently causes death 
in male mice on long-term toxicology studies. Therefore, the NOAEL for this study was set at 100 
mg/kg/day. Safety margins at the NOEL of 100 mg/kg/day of 28x and 7.4x for males and 51x and 
14x for females were calculated towards AUC exposure levels at the clinical dose of 100 mg and 
300 mg, respectively. 
In the rat study, in males and females a significantly increased incidence of benign 
pheochromocytomas in both sexes at 100 mg/kg/day was observed. In males there was also a 
treatment related effect for the incidence of malignant pheochromocytomas at the high dose. 
Survival-adjusted analysis of pheochromocytoma (benign and malignant) tumour rates were 
10%, 8%, 13%, and 57% in males at 0, 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, showing the 
absence of a treatment-related effect at 30 mg/kg/day. Furthermore, survival was significantly 
increased in the 30 mg/kg/day dose groups. Therefore, the NOEL for pheochromocytomas was set 
at 30 mg/kg/day. 
Furthermore, in high dose animals of both sexes an increased incidence of renal tubular tumours 
(RTT) was observed. One of these tumours was of the amphophilic-vacuolar phenotype, all others 
were basophilic. In the mid dose two tumours of the amphophilic-vacuolar phenotype were found 
in male rats. These three amphiphilic–vacuolar tumours are considered to be spontaneous and 
not treatment-related. Furthermore, there was no dose-dependency. This was also confirmed by a 
pathology working group which conducted a blinded review of the renal histological findings. The 
NOEL for renal tubular tumours was set at 30 mg/kg/day. Safety margins for pheochromocytomas 
and RTT of 17x and 4.5x for males and 27x and 7.2x for females were calculated towards AUC 
exposure levels at the clinical dose of 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively. 
Benign Leydig cell tumours (LCTs) were detected at an increased incidence relative to controls 
across all dose groups in male rats. A NOEL could not be set based upon the observed incidence 
of tumours. Occurrence of LCTs might be due to decreases in testosterone levels and subsequent 
increases in LH levels upon canagliflozin treatment. The outcome of the conducted toxicity studies 
where LH and testosterone levels were measured are controversial and do not give a final 
mechanistic explanation of incidences of LCTs in the rat. 
All tumour findings in the rat carcinogenicity study are summarized in the following table.

Statistically significant tumour findings are shown in bold (Fisher’s Exact Test).  
To further understand the occurrence of pheochromocytomas and RTT in the high dose, an 
extensive programme of mechanistic studies was conducted (complemented by mechanistic 
studies on hyperostosis). It was assumed that rat-specific carbohydrate malabsorption (due to 
SGLT1 inhibition in the gut) and its consequences such as decreased luminal pH, increased 
intestinal calcium absorption and consecutively increased urinary calcium excretion caused these 
tumour findings. 
In a first set of experiments it was shown that carbohydrate malabsorption was present in male 
rats at canagliflozin treatment. Canagliflozin caused a profound reduction (>90%) in 
3-O-methyl glucose (3-OMG) plasma levels indicating inhibition of glucose/galactose absorption 
relative to vehicle control. In a further study a significant increase in cecal glucose content was 
observed with 100 mg/kg/day canagliflozin treatment relative to vehicle control. Additionally, 
canagliflozin lead to a decrease in the jejunal/ileal pH a sign for increased carbohydrate 
fermentation. 
Feeding the rats with a glucose- and galactose-free diet (both sugars are a substrate of SGLT1) 
for 6 months prevented decrease in luminal pH, increased calcium excretion and hyperostosis. 
Hence, the interconnection between intestinal SGLT1 inhibition and increased calcium 
excretion/hyperostosis could be established (note that the organism has two possibilities to 
handle calcium that is absorbed in surplus, excreting it via kidney or storing it in bones; both 
options obviously were used). In this mechanistic study renal changes (hyperplasia, calcification 
and inflammation) were also markedly reduced. Adrenal changes (in particular hyperplasia) were 
also strongly reduced in the rats on glucose- and galactose-free diet. Hence, it can be expected 
that the pheochromocytomas observed in this species were also dependent on SGLT1 inhibition, 
although the pathophysiological link is less clear in this case. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
A fertility study in rats, embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits and a pre-postnatal 
development study in rats were conducted with oral application of canagliflozin. An additional 
study on embryo-foetal development was performed using the combination of canagliflozin and 
metformin. Canagliflozin showed no effects on fertility and early embryonic development up to the 
highest dose of 100 mg/kg/day (safety margin of 73x or 19x to human therapeutic exposure at a 
dose of 100 mg or 300 mg).  
In the embryo-foetal development study in rats with canagliflozin alone, skeletal anomalies 
associated with the state of ossification were observed in foetuses of the high dose canagliflozin 
group. The applicant contributed these findings towards maternal toxicity. However, maternal 
toxicity did not result in a decrease in foetal body weights, which would have been expected as a 
prerequisite for developmental delays in foetuses. Therefore, other effects of canagliflozin like 
changes in calcium homeostasis might be responsible for skeletal ossification delays in foetuses. 
Ossifications delays were also observed in the embryo-foetal development study with canagliflozin 
plus metformin. Reductions in ossifications were more pronounced for canagliflozin plus 
metformin than for metformin alone. 
No effects of canagliflozin were observed on embryo-foetal development in the rabbit. The NOAEL 
was thus established at the highest dose of 100 mg/kg/day (safety margin of 70x or 19x to 
human therapeutic exposure at a dose of 100 mg or 300 mg). 
In the study on pre-/postnatal development, the NOAEL was established at 100 mg/kg/day 
(safety margin of 73x or 19x to human therapeutic exposure at a dose of 100 mg or 300 mg; see 
table above). Effects on offspring functional development and litter parameters in F1-dams were

noticed at this dose, however, a correlation could be shown towards low absolute body weights in 
offspring and F1-dams. 
A study on juvenile toxicity in rats which was still on-going at submission was provided with the 
answers to the D120 list of questions. Findings in the juvenile toxicity study in rats were in 
general consistent with effects seen in repeat-dose toxicity studies in adult rats. Changes in urine 
parameters, increases in kidney weights and hyperostosis were observed. These findings were 
reversible. Because of partial reversibility of pelvic dilatation in juvenile male rats, the NOAEL was 
established at 4 mg/kg/day corresponding to AUC values up to 2.4x and 0.6x the AUC for the 100 
and 300 mg doses in humans, respectively.   
Local Tolerance  
The Applicant has provided two studies assessing the eye irritation and skin sensitization potential 
of canagliflozin to support the development of safe handling procedures during the manufacturing 
process.  
In an eye irritation bovine corneal opacity-permeability assay, canagliflozin was classified as a 
borderline non to mild eye irritant. Results from a skin sensitization murine local lymph node 
assay indicated that canagliflozin was not a contact sensitizer. 
 Other toxicity studies 
 Phototoxicity 
In vitro and in vivo phototoxicity studies were performed because canagliflozin shows UV 
absorption with an absorption peak at 291 nm. In a photo-Ames test canagliflozin was not 
considered to be photomutagenic. 
In an in vitro neutral red uptake assay canagliflozin was considered to be photosensitizing in vitro. 
The photosensitizing potential of canagliflozin was further tested in pigmented rats following oral 
administration. Canagliflozin did not cause ocular photosensitization at any dose level in the same 
study. The NOAEL for photosensitization in pigmented rats was set at 5 mg/kg/day. Canagliflozin 
induced skin photosensitization (mild to moderate erythema and edema) at ≥ 50 mg/kg/day after 
UV-A and UV-B light exposure. At 500 mg/kg/day skin reactions were consistent with 
phototoxicity (1/5 M and 3/5 F).  
 Studies on Impurities 
Canagliflozin hydroperoxide is formed during storage. Based on the analyses of batches so far the 
Applicant proposed a specification limit of 220 ppm equivalent to a maximum daily intake (DI) of 
66µg/d based on the proposed maximum therapeutic daily dose. The DI was considered justified 
by occupational data (endogenous peroxide production and PDE calculation derived from repeated 
dose toxicology studies with hydrogen peroxide). Considering that the limit for hydrogen peroxide 
in drinking water is 100µg/l and hydrogen peroxide is also naturally occurring in fruits and 
vegetables up to mg-amounts/kg the additional peroxide exposure from canagliflozin 
hydroperoxide is minimal and considered acceptable.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Phase I:  
The applicant submitted an OECD 117 study on the n-octanol/water partition coefficient. The log 
Kow is 1.95.   
The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of canagliflozin in surface water (PECsurfacewater) 
was calculated to be 1.5 µg/L and revised to 0.163 μg/L. 
The predicted environmental concentration of canagliflozin in groundwater (PECgroundwater) was 
calculated to be 0.041 μg/L. 
The predicted environmental concentration of canagliflozin in sediment (PECsed) was calculated to 
be 0.000309 mg/kg. 
Canagliflozin PEC surface water, groundwater and microorganism values are below the action limits 
and canagliflozin is not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5.  
Phase II: 
The applicant submitted OECD 121, OECD 301, and OECD 308. As more than 10 % (65.2/58.1 % 
at day 14) of the active ingredient shift to sediment, risk assessment for the sediment 
compartment was performed by the applicant. No terrestrial assessment is required. 
 The applicant submitted OECD 209 (activated sludge respiration inhibition test), OECD 201 (algal 
growth inhibition test), OECD 211 (daphnia reproduction test), OECD 210 (fish early life stage 
test), and OECD 218 (sediment dweller toxicity test). In addition, short term tests on daphnia and 
fish were submitted (OECD 202 and 203). All tests are valid and plausible.

2.3.6. Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
2.3.6.1 Pharmacology 
Sufficient pharmacodynamic activity of canagliflozin on SGLT2 could be demonstrated in rat and 
human in vitro models and in several in vivo models of mice, rats, and dogs. 
No functional or binding assays were performed showing an inhibitory effect of canagliflozin on 
SGLT2 and SGLT1 of other species (mouse, rabbit, and dog) which were also used in the 
toxicology programme. However, primary and/or pharmacodynamic activity of canagliflozin has 
been sufficiently shown in all species included. Therefore, it is not deemed necessary to 
investigate canagliflozin’s action on SGLT2 from these species in vitro. 
In in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies canagliflozin showed no effects on the 
cardiovascular and respiratory system and did not induce neurobehavioral changes. Safety 
margins are sufficient. 
2.3.6.2. Pharmacokinetics 
In humans the primary metabolic clearance pathway of canagliflozin is through its direct 
glucuronidation in liver whereas in animal species oxidation is the major metabolic pathway, 
yielding various metabolites not present in humans in vivo (e.g. M1, M2, M4, M6, M8). Human 
plasma levels of O-glucuronides M5 and M7 approached a peak of ~30% of the sample 
radioactivity. These two metabolites, M5 and M7, were not found in rat plasma at low doses. M7 
was the major metabolite found in rat bile, while M5 was also present but to a lesser extent, 
independent of the dose. Furthermore M7 was formed in rat hepatocytes. In conclusion, rats are 
forming M5 and M7 and are expected to be exposed to these metabolites to a low extent although 
they cannot be detected in plasma by the methods used. As these metabolites are O-glucuronides

and showed no pharmacological activity and showed no activity against CYPs and other 
transporters, they are not considered as a toxicological concern. 
2.3.6.3. Toxicology 
In general, canagliflozin was well tolerated after repeated dosing in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs. 
Mostly, toxicity findings could be attributed to an exaggerated pharmacological effect of 
canagliflozin (increased urinary glucose and electrolyte excretion and urine volume reduced serum 
glucose, reduced body weight and body weight gain). Increases in kidney weights and tubular 
dilatation were primarily observed in rats already at low doses and in the high doses in mice and 
dogs in the 3-month study (200 mg/kg/day, which was later reduced to 100 mg/kg/day). No 
increase in kidney weights was observed in the one year dog study (high dose 100 mg/kg/day). 
In the rat the limiting toxicity was hyperostosis.  
The applicant hypothesised that rat-specific carbohydrate malabsorption caused by intestinal 
SGLT1 inhibitory activity of canagliflozin and subsequent increases in calcium absorption in the 
gut are causes for the observed hyperostosis. In the rat canagliflozin is absorbed slowly (Cmax at 
4-7 hours) with a low bioavailabilty (35%), which might lead to high canagliflozin concentrations 
in the gut lumen and a consecutive inhibition of SGLT1. As a consequence, glucose and galactose 
are malabsorbed which can result in increased intestinal calcium absorption due to pH lowering in 
the intestine caused by carbohydrate fermentation. Since increased intestinal calcium absorption 
was also regarded as the reason for the neoplastic findings in rat, various mechanistic studies 
have been performed by the applicant to verify these hypotheses. These mechanistic studies 
provide sufficient evidence and sound explanations of the causes of hyperostosis and increased 
urinary calcium excretion. As hyperostosis was not observed in other animal species and changes 
in bone markers and calcium excretion were not observed in clinical trials, hyperostosis is not 
expected to occur in humans. 
In the rabbit, the primary PD effect of canagliflozin, increased urinary glucose excretion was not 
demonstrated. Simultaneously, in vitro studies on the rabbit SGLT2 are lacking. Thus, the 
suitability of this species (in respect to responsiveness to the study drug) for studying toxicology 
was not directly shown. On the other hand, there were clear signs of toxicity observed in the 
study which are in line with SGLT2 inhibition, in particular weight loss, increases in serum 
creatinine and decrease in serum sodium. Thus, it is likely that canagliflozin is effective in rabbits. 
From combination studies in rats it can be concluded that that the combination of canagliflozin 
and metformin are well tolerated and no toxicities can be expected due to drug-drug interactions.  
The observed incidences of renal tubular tumours (RTT) and pheochromocytomas were addressed 
by the Applicant in various mechanistic studies e.g. monitoring carbohydrate malabsorption or 
feeding glucose- and-galactose free diets. These studies demonstrated that renal changes 
(hyperplasia, calcification and inflammation) were most likely (as already expected from 
physiological considerations) a consequence of the need for the kidney to excrete unusual high 
amounts of calcium. This strongly supports the assumption that renal tumours that developed on 
the basis of the mentioned renal alterations were rat-specific and dependent on carbohydrate 
malabsorption that was not observed in humans. Furthermore, related side effects of glucose 
malabsorption such as flatulence or diarrhoea were not present in phase III studies, further 
demonstrating that this is a rat specific phenomenon.  
Concerning pheochromocytomas it can be assumed that carbohydrate malabsorption, which 
among others may lead to shortage of glucose in the organism, along with the probably energy-
dependent need of excreting high amounts of calcium induces a high adrenergic tone in the 
animal. This could lead to the observed adrenal hyperplasia. But even if this speculative 
Canagliflozin  
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013  
Page 27/115 
 
 
 
mechanism is not true, it is reassuring that the link between adrenal hyperplasia and rat-specific 
carbohydrate malabsorption could be confirmed.  
Nevertheless,  the  provided  hypothesis  relies  on  the  fact  that  canagliflozin  is  poorly  absorbed  in 
the rat, with a bioavailability of 35%, leading to increased local concentrations in the gut capable 
of  inhibiting  SGLT1.  The  Applicant  provided  a  theoretical  estimate  of  the  local  concentrations  of 
canagliflozin  in  the  gut,  arriving  at  a  12-fold  higher  concentration  in  rats  at  100  mg/kg  (dose 
which  resulted  in  pheochromocytoma  and  RTT),  as  compared  to  humans  treated  with  300  mg 
(the  highest  clinical  dose).  Considering  the  differences  in  pharmacokinetics  between  rats  and 
humans, the actual ratio is likely to be higher.  
The  exact  concentration  needed  to  inhibit  intestinal  SGLT1  is  difficult  to  estimate,  given  that 
canagliflozin is a competitive SGLT inhibitor and that local glucose as well as drug concentrations 
are  likely  to  vary  depending  on  meal  intakes.  Referring  to  data  from  one  clinical  and  one  rat 
study, the Applicant argued that the results clearly demonstrate the difference between rats and 
humans,  showing  glucose  malabsorption  in  rats  at  100  mg/kg  but  not  in  humans  at  300  mg.  It 
was  possible  to  demonstrate  inhibition  of  a  SGLT1  substrate  in  rats,  further  strengthening  the 
hypothesis  of  low  oral  bioavailability  in  the  rat,  leading  to  a  longer  intestinal  dwelling  time  with 
consequently higher local concentration of canagliflozin. 
In conclusion, the Applicant’s line of argument in support for a rat-specific inhibitory effect on 
intestinal SGLT1 is convincing and acceptable as a plausible mechanism behind the disturbed 
calcium homeostasis and associated tumourigenic effect in the rat carcinogenicity study. 
Occurrence of LCTs might be due to decreases in testosterone levels and subsequent increases in 
LH levels upon canagliflozin treatment. The outcome of the conducted toxicity studies were LH 
and testosterone levels were measured are controversial and do not give a final mechanistic 
explanation of incidences of LCTs in the rat. Nevertheless, the rat has been shown to be 
susceptible to develop LCTs in other carcinogenicity studies by various non-genotoxic agents. 
Furthermore, LCTs found in rats after canagliflozin treatment were mostly benign. It can be 
concluded, that occurrence of LCTs is most likely species specific. 
In the study on fertility and early embryonic development in SD rats, canagliflozin showed no 
effects on male and female fertility and reproductive performance   
Skeletal anomalies associated with the state of ossification (reduced ossification of metatarsal 
bones) were observed in foetuses of the high dose canagliflozin alone group in the embryo-foetal 
development study in rats. The applicant considered the skeletal findings to be related to the 
reduced maternal body weight gain and thus to maternal toxicity. However, maternal toxicity did 
not result in a decrease in foetal body weights, which would first have been expected as a sign of 
developmental delay and would then result in skeletal anomalies. It was also not possible to 
correlate those dams showing clear effects on body weights with foetuses showing skeletal 
anomalies. Ossifications delays were also observed in the embryo-foetal development study with 
canagliflozin plus metformin. Reductions in ossifications were more pronounced for canagliflozin 
plus metformin than for metformin alone. Skeletal findings might be attributed to disturbances in 
calcium homeostasis.  
The NOAEL for offspring functional development and reproductive performance was at the high 
dose of 100 mg/kg/day, as effects observed on development in high dose pups (air righting 
response, sexual maturation) and on pregnancy parameters of high dose F1-dams correlated with 
low absolute body weights of offspring and dams.

Canagliflozin was considered to be photosensitizing in vitro and showed skin photosensitization in 
pigmented rats. However, clinical data (see clinical section for detailed discussion) indicated that 
phototoxicity would play only a role at light intensities beyond bright daylight. 
 2.3.6.4. Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Canagliflozin PEC surface water, groundwater and microorganism values are below the action 
limits and canagliflozin is not a PBT substance as log Kow does not exceed 4.5.  
Considering the available data, canagliflozin is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.7. Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP was of the view that the PD activity of canagliflozin has sufficiently been demonstrated 
in in vitro and in vivo models.  
In non-clinical animal species canagliflozin has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and 
toxicity findings are generally related to an exaggerated pharmacological effect of canagliflozin. 
Hyperostosis, renal and tumour findings are considered to be a rat specific phenomenon. Rat 
skeletal findings might be attributed to disturbances in calcium homeostasis. These findings are 
considered to have no consequence to humans.  
Observed phototoxicity in vitro and in rats is not considered to be clinically relevant. 
With regards to the ERA, the data submitted so far do not indicate a risk for the environment.

Total 
Number of subjects refers to those subjects who received at least 1 dose of canagliflozin, and only 
subjects from the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies that were included in the population PK analysis.

Absolute oral bioavailability was investigated in study DIA 1021. In vivo metabolism of 14C-
canagliflozin was studied in feces, urine, and plasma collected from healthy male subjects after a 
single oral dose of 192 mg 14C-canagliflozin in a mass-balance study (study NAP1006).  
Single dose PK was investigated in healthy subjects in study NAP1001, DIA 1001 and DIA 1015, 
multiple dose PK in Study NAP1008, DIA1030, and DIA 1032. In subjects with T2DM single and 
multiple dose PK was investigated in study NAP1002, DIA 1007, and DIA 1023, and in addition 
(supportive) in study TA-7284-02. In addition to the Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies, PK 
and/or PD assessments of canagliflozin from 2 Phase 2 studies and 3 Phase 3 studies were included 
in population PK analyses.  
Analytical methods were validated and appropriately described for the determination of 
canagliflozin by LC-MS/MS, for the metabolites M5 and M7 (LC-MS/MS methods), the α-anamer

and the drugs determined in the interactions studies. Specific issues are discussed in the context of 
the respective studies. PK data and statistical analyses were appropriate. 
Major findings related to GCP were reported by the applicant for some studies and the PK data for 
canagliflozin from these studies (NAP1001, NAP1002, NAP1004, NAP1005, NAP1006, and 
NAP1008) were not considered reliable and therefore were not presented. Only PK data from 
metabolites and PD data were reported from these studies. 
The bridging strategy between different formulations used in the clinical development included 
preclinical considerations, cross study PK comparisons, PD comparisons, gastro plus simulations, 
the investigation of physicochemical characteristics and two relative bioequivalence studies 
(DIA1017 and (supportive) TA-7284-03). All data obtained with the different formulations used 
during the clinical program (oral suspension, tablets with high-shear granulation (HSG), fluid-bed 
granulation (FBG), non-particle-engineered and particle-engineered (NPE, PE), without and with 
film-coating) are considered transferable to the to-be-marketed formulation. 
An overview over the PK parameters across studies is provided below as a summary of pooled 
analyses in Table 5 (single dose PK across studies) and in Table 6 (multiple dose PK across

Absorption  
Canagliflozin was rapidly absorbed. Tmax was approximately 1 to 2 hours and was independent of 
the dose. In-vitro investigations in colon carcinoma-derived (Caco)-2 cells suggested an 
intermediate permeability and the involvement of the efflux pump P-gp in the human intestine. 
The oral bioavailability was about 65%.  
There was no effect of food on PK as demonstrated in a single dose study (DIA 1043) with 300 
mg tablets. Similarly there was no food effect on PD parameters (Study NAP1001, part 2)). 
Canagliflozin  
Assessment report

Canagliflozin may therefore be taken with or without food. Considering that doses at about 300 
mg may delay glucose absorption (see below) it is advised to take canagliflozin before breakfast.  
Distribution 
The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) of canagliflozin following a single 
i.v. infusion in healthy subjects was 119 L. This suggests an extensive tissue distribution. There 
was no relevant redistribution to blood cells. In vitro plasma protein binding of canagliflozin was 
98.3% to 98.5%, predominantly to human serum albumin (97.3%) 
Elimination 
In plasma, mainly unchanged canaglifglozin was measured (about 57% of the plasma exposure). 
Among the metabolites the inactive o-glucuronides M5 and M7 were most important, accounting 
for 1.9 – 30% and 16 – 29% of the plasma exposure, respectively, depending on the time point. 
In vitro, other metabolic pathways in human hepatocytes were carboxylation (M6, 2%) and 
monooxygenation (M9, 1%). Metabolite M9 was also found in human liver microsomes. It 
accounts for 2.4% to 3.7% of the total drug-related components in human plasma. Metabolites 
M7 (17% of a radioactively labelled dose) and M5 (13%) were found in urine, M9 (7.0%) and M7 
(3.2%), but not M5 were detected in faeces. Anomerisation of the β-anomer to the α-anomer did 
not occur to a clinically relevant amount. 
The clearance of canagliflozin was about 12.2 L/h indicating a low clearance drug. Mean t1/2 was 
dose independent and was between 10.6 and 13.1 hours over the clinical studies for doses 
between 100 and 300 mg qd. Oral doses were excreted by approximately 60% via faeces and by 
about 33% by the kidneys. Across studies, renal excretion of unchanged canaglifozin was below 
1%, and of M5 and M7 13.3 and 17.2%, respectively. To the contrary, in the feces unchanged 
canagliflozin accounted for 40% and the metabolites M9 and M7 were detected only in low 
concentrations (7.0 and 3.2%, respectively). De-glucuronidation in the faeces may be a possible 
explanation for the absence of M5 in faeces. Although no human data on biliary excretion of 
unchanged drug are available, most likely glucuronidation is the major elimination pathway, and 
biliary excretion of unchanged canagliflozin is not a major route of elimination. The potential for a 
clinically relevant interaction based on hepatic transporter inhibition is considered low. No 
enterohepatic pathway of clinical relevance was observed.  
No inhibition or inhibition only at high concentrations was observed for several UGTs studied in an 
in vitro study (UGT1A4, UGT1A9, UGT1A1, UGT1A6 and UGT2B7). Based on the expected in vivo 
concentrations no interaction is foreseen at therapeutic systemic levels. 
Whereas the role of genetic polymorphisms for UGT2B4 remains to be determined, there was a 
robust finding of increased exposure in the range of about 26 - 54% of canagliflozin carrying 
UGT1A9*3 alleles, trough concentrations were 81% higher for carriers of the UGT1A9*3 allele. 
Since the individual values were within the overall observed range dose adaption in patients with 
known UGT1A9 and UGT2B4 alleles is not considered necessary.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Cmax and AUC values increased dose proportional (50 – 300mg qd) after single dose and multiple 
dose administration. There was no time dependent accumulation when canagliflozin was 
administered at multiple doses. The exposure was about 36% higher at steady state which was 
reached after about 4 days of qd dosing with 50 to 300 mg canagliflozin. The exposure (AUC) was 
not different between qd and bid administration.  
Special populations 
There were no relevant differences in the PK of canagliflozin between healthy subjects and 
patients with T2DM.

Patients with severe hepatic failure with a Child-Pugh-Score >9 were not investigated. In patients 
with mild to moderate hepatic failure, only mild changes were observed, i.e. Cmax and AUC values 
increased by less than 11%. Oral clearance was unchanged and the differences in volume of 
distribution (approx. 14% greater and approx. 20% lower in subjects with mild and moderate 
hepatic impairment as compared to subjects with normal hepatic function) and t1/2 (14.8h, 17.6h, 
and 13.1h in subjects with normal hepatic function and mild and moderate hepatic impairment, 
respectively) are not considered of clinical relevance. In conclusion, dose adaption is not 
considered necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment for PK reasons.  
In subjects with renal failure there was an increase in exposure that could not be explained by 
changes in renal clearance per se since renal clearance of unchanged canagliflozin is <1%. AUC 
was higher in subjects with a CLCR 50 to <80 mL/min by about 17%, with CLCR 30 to <50 
mL/min by about 63%, and with a CLCR <30 mL/min by about 50%. No change was observed in 
patients with end-stage renal disease requiring haemodialysis. It is unclear to which extent 
baseline differences not related to renal function or indirect effects have contributed to the result. 
Dose normalized AUC values were 22% higher in females. This is not considered of clinical 
relevance in the absence of other factors increasing exposure. 
There was no relevant difference in PK, dose proportionality and exposure between Western, 
Japanese and Indian subjects. The moderately higher exposure of 33% observed in subjects 
weighing <78.2 kg as compared to subjects weighing >95.2 kg is not considered of clinical 
relevance.  
However, in the elderly the observed increase in AUC values by about 29% could be relevant. 
Since in elderly subjects BP lowering effects may be more relevant for safety reasons, the 
recommended dose titration starting at 100 mg is appropriate. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In-vitro investigations indicated potential interactions at the level of P-gp, MDR1 and MRP2 
transporters. Canagliflozin does not appear to be a transported by NTCP, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1 
or OCT1. Neither does it seem to inhibit OATP1B1 OAT1, OAT3, NTCP, OCT1 and OCT2. P-gp 
appears to be inhibited at an intestinal level (IC50 19 uM in MDCK cells using digoxin as 
substrate) and possibly also to some extent systemically (in the kidney). 
Canagliflozin (10 μM [4,440 ng/mL]) did not induce CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 activity in human 
hepatocytes. In human liver microsomes canagliflozin and M7 were weak inhibitors of CYP2B6 and 
2C8. Probe specifically CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 was also weakly inhibited by canagliflozin, with 
testosterone (IC50 = 27 μM) as a substrate, but not with midazolam.  In-vitro investigations 
indicated potential interactions at the level of P-gp, MDR1 and MRP2 transporters, CYP3A4 and 
CYP2C9 to be addressed in clinical DDIs. Canagliflozin is primarily metabolized by glucuronidation. 
The isoenzyme CYP3A4 is involved in the formation of metabolite M9. Interactions studies are not 
considered necessary for CYP 3A4. Clinically relevant interactions were observed only for Rifampin 
and Digoxin. 
A clinically relevant interaction occurred at the level of UGTs involved in the formation of M5 and 
M7. Rifampin mediated enzyme induction decreased plasma Cmax of canagliflozin by 30% and 
AUC by 52%, respectively. The nonspecific inhibitor of UGTs probenecid, on the other hand, 
increased plasma Cmax,ss and AUCτ,ss values for canagliflozin by about 13% and 21%, 
respectively. In addition, cyclosporine, a potent inhibitor of P-gp increased AUC values by 23%.  
HCTZ increased canagliflozin AUC by about 8 – 12%. More importantly, there was a numerical 
increase in orthostatic hypotension, when both drugs were coadministered. There was a moderate 
Canagliflozin

increase in AEs related to volume depletion in patients pre-treated with HCTZ. This is covered in 
the SPC in section 4.4 and 4.5. 
Canagliflozin increased Cmax of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel by 22%, but did not change 
the overall exposure. Cmax and AUCinf of simvastatin and of simvastatin acid were slightly 
increased by canagliflozin by numerically 9 – 12% (simvastatin) and 18 – 26% (simvastatin acid), 
respectively. No relevant PK interactions were observed at the level of CYP2C9 for Gliburide and 
Warfarin INF values were also not affected. Canagliflozin did not change the PK of Metformin by a 
clinically relevant amount. Co-administration of canagliflozin increased the Cmax of digoxin by 
about 36% and AUC levels by about 20%. Since Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic range this 
interaction should be mentioned in the SmPC. The assumed mechansim, an inhibition at the level 
of P-gp is also relevant for other digitalis glycosides.  
A DDI with dabigatran has not been performed. Based on the data provided, the likelihood of co-
administration in the relevant patient population seems to be low and a clinical DDI is not 
considered necessary. The theoretical potential for a PK interaction is included in the SmPC. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Canagliflozin is an orally active, reversible inhibitor of SGLT2 (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] 
of 4.2 nM [1.86 ng/mL]) that is being developed as an oral anti-hyperglycaemic agent. In 
addition, canagliflozin also possesses intrinsic, albeit substantially less potent, SGLT1 inhibitory 
activity. The low-affinity/high-capacity SGLT2 transporter in the early proximal convoluted renal 
tubule reabsorbs most of the filtered glucose. A relatively small amount of glucose is reabsorbed 
by SGLT1, a high-affinity/low-capacity glucose transporter. By inhibiting SGLT2, the transporter 
responsible for the majority of renal glucose reabsorption, canagliflozin lowers the renal threshold 
for glucose excretion (RTG), thereby leading to increased UGE and decreased plasma glucose 
concentrations in hyperglycaemic subjects. The increased UGE with SGLT2 inhibition also 
translates to a loss of calories and weight loss.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
Canagliflozin inhibits SGLT2 and with considerably lower affinity SGLT1. 
In healthy subjects, canagliflozin increased mean 24-hour urinary glucose excretion (UGE24h) 
by up to 60 – 70 g. The maximal effect was achieved at doses ≥200 mg qd. The 24-hour mean 
renal threshold of glucose excretion (RTG) decreased dose-dependently with single- and multiple-
dose administration of canagliflozin. A maximal decrease to about 50 – 60 mg/dL could be 
achieved. No relevant differences were observed after single dose or multiple dose administration 
and between qd and bid dosing of 100 mg and of 300 mg at steady state.  
In patients with T2DM, the effect of canagliflozin on UGE was more pronounced (≥ 100 g/day 
at doses > 100 g/day). This can be explained by the fact that UGE is influenced by both glucose 
plasma concentrations and GFR. The maximal effect on UGE24h was seen at doses ≥ 200 mg qd 
or even at lower doses. As expected, (pretreatment) RTG baseline values were generally higher in 
the patients with T2DM than the commonly reported values of 180 to 200 mg/dL for healthy 
subjects. RTG was related to 24h mean plasma glucose (MPG). Canagliflozin decreased 24-hour 
mean RTG in a dose-dependent manner. A maximal decrease to about 70 to 90 mg/dL was 
achieved with doses ≥ 200 mg qd.  
Canagliflozin  
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013  
Page 36/115 
 
 
 
 
 
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations, post prandial glucose concentrations and 24-hour 
mean plasma glucose (MPG24h) decreased in a dose-dependent manner in subjects with T2DM. A 
mean decrease of FPG by ≥40 mg/dL and of MPG24h by ≥30 mg/dL was achieved with doses of 
100 mg qd and higher. 
Over the whole period of 4 weeks in the clinical pharmacology program the effect on UGE, RTG 
and reductions in FPG and MPG24h was sustained. 
Based on the PD results, a maximum daily dose of 300 mg of canagliflozin appears justified. 
A delay in post prandial glucose absorption with decreased post prandial glucose excursions was 
observed with 300 mg canagliflozin in healthy subjects and patients with T2DM that was 
independent from the effect on UGE. This effect was not explained by delayed gastric emptying 
and may possibly be due to inhibition of intestinal SGLT1 by high intestinal concentrations of 
canagliflozin after oral intake. 
Placebo-adjusted decreases in body weight by approximately 1.3 – 2.2 kg in healthy volunteers 
and by 1 - 1.5 kg in subjects with T2DM, respectively, were observed during 2 to 4 weeks of 
canagliflozin administration. This was not due to changes in appetite and satiety, as assessed by 
VAS in different studies. Both nutrient loss due to renal glucose excretion and osmotic diuresis 
may contribute to this effect. 
The data for insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic dose range were not conclusive. At 
supratherapeutic doses (400 mg qd and 300 mg bid) improvements in insulin sensitivity were 
observed after 2 weeks. For lower doses no significant effects were seen over 2 weeks in the 
pharmacology program. In the clinical program there were trends toward an improvement but no 
statistically significant effects. 
As an indicator of beta cell function, insulin secretion rate increased by more than 50 % with 
canagliflozin 100 mg qd.  
Secondary pharmacology 
The Applicant conducted a thorough QT/QTc study in 60 healthy subjects as a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacine 400 mg), double-dummy, 4-way 
crossover, single-center trial of oral CANA at therapeutic (300 mg) and supratherapeutic (1,200 
mg) doses, administered as single doses. QT intervals were extracted from continuous 12-lead 
ECG Holter recordings and corrected according to Fridericia (QTcF), Bazett (QTcB) and study-
specific power (QTcP) correction methods. 
Moxifloxacin, the positive control, yielded the expected results (QTc prolongation by 5 to 10 ms). 
Neither visual inspection of the results nor formal statistical analysis gave any hint that CANA 
could prolong the QT interval in a relevant way. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
No PD interactions were observed between canagliflozin and simvastatin, or warfarin. Co-
administration with HCTZ was associated with a small increase in RTG and mean plasma glucose 
leves and slightly lower UGE. Co-administration of canagliflozin 300 mg qd with metformin 2000 
mg qd was associated with a slight decreased in UGE24h, a slight increase in RTG and no effect 
on plasma glucose levels as compared to canagliflozin alone. Co-administration with gliburide was 
not associated with synergistic or additive effects. Cmax of plasma glucose were similar, when 
canagliflozin was administered alone or in combination with gliburide, AUC 0-4 and AUC0-10 was 
slightly lower in the combination group AUC0-24 was even slightly above the value for 
canagliflozin alone.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of canagliflozin have been 
adequately characterised. Time dose and time dependency were investigated in healthy subjects 
and in patients with T2DM patients. In subjects with T2DM PK was comparable to healthy subjects 
and there were no relevant differences attributable to race. 
Transferability of the data of the clinical program to the marketing formulation has been 
demonstrated. The final formulation has been used sufficiently in phase III studies.  
Albeit canagliflozin is sensitive to light, the applicant has demonstrated that this was not relevant 
in the clinical program. 
The effect of food on Cmax and Tmax in one study (TA-7284- part 2) can possibly be attributed to 
the formulation (oral suspension). It still remains to be determined to which extent unabsorbed 
drug, biliary excreted drug or, potentially, excreted hydrolysed (unstable during analysis 
procedures) glucuronide contribute to unchanged canagliflozin in faeces. The UGT2B4 contribution 
has not been confirmed in vivo, but a clinically meaningful drug-drug interaction at this level is 
unlikely. 
Mild to moderate differences in exposure relating to gender, body weight and mild to moderate 
hepatic failure are not considered of clinical relevance per se but exposure may possibly be more 
pronounced in case these conditions coincide. Since patients with severe hepatic failure were 
excluded from the pharmacological and clinical development program, use of canagliflozin is not 
recommended in these patients.  
The increase in exposure in elderly subjects by 29% could be of relevance with respect to 
dehydration-related AEs such as a decrease in BP. Therefore, initial dose titration as 
recommended (starting with 100 mg qd) is considered appropriate.  
In patients with renal failure there was an increase in exposure related to the degree of renal 
failure by up to 63% in patients not on haemodialysis. In patients with end stage renal failure on 
haemodialysis, exposure was unchanged. Canagliflozin cannot be eliminated by haemodialysis. 
Due to efficacy and safety considerations, a reduced dose of 100 mg/d of canagliflozin is 
recommended in patients with eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73m2 and canagliflozin should not be 
used in patients with an eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73m2 
PK simulations indicated that factors like body weight, BMI, renal function, age, gender, and 
UGT1A9 carrier status, when combined, may lead to an increased exposure by 52 – 78% for 
Cmax and 63 – 125% for AUC in worst case scenarios. The decision for a dose escalation in these 
patients should mainly be based on tolerability considerations. This is adequately described in the 
product information. 
In the pharmacogenomic-exposure analysis using data from phase I, phase II, and phase III 
studies mean plasma canagliflozin trough concentrations were 81% higher for carriers of the 
UGT1A9*3 allele (21 carriers and 711 non-carriers). As pooled analysis may dilute the PGx effect, 
the applicant discussed whether the size of the effect was as expected based on the in vitro and 
in vivo data and the scientific literature. The effects are reflected in the SmPC.  
The interaction profile has been well characterized addressing the metabolic pathways and 
clinically relevant co-administered drugs. Substrate activity of M5 and M7 for human OAT3 and 
MRP2 was not assessed, which is not considered of clinical relevance. It was questioned whether 
the interaction with digoxin is sufficiently representative for a possible interaction with dabigatran 
but the applicant has provided data that substantiated that the likelihood of coadministration is 
low and therefore no clinical DDI study is required. 
Canagliflozin

A new in vitro study was provided to address the inhibitory potential of canagliflozin on BCRP and 
OATP1B3 and whether it is a substrate. Canagliflozin was found to be a substrate for BCRP but 
not for OATP1B3. Since BCRP inhibition by canagliflozin in the GI tract may not be excluded, this 
is adequately addressed in the labelling. Canagliflozin showed some inhibition of OATP1B3 but, 
based on comparisons with estimated hepatic inlet concentrations, in vivo inhibition of OATP1B3 
can be excluded. 
The applicant has performed two in vitro induction studies. Neither of them included high enough 
concentrations for intestinal 3A4 induction to be investigated. However, this may not be possible 
due to cell toxicity. Shorter incubation times than usual were applied. This was appropriate for 
mRNA measurements. A single dose of cyclosporine, a potent inhibitor of P-gp, increased AUC 
values by 23%. The applicant has performed a “simulation” of the effect of cyclosporine at steady 
state in comparison with a single dose. In the present SmPC cyclosporine is listed among drugs 
not affecting canagliflozin exposure. This is considered appropriate as the small additional effect is 
not considered to be a problem from a safety perspective. 
There is no interaction study with cholestyramine. HCTZ increased canagliflozin AUC by about 8 – 
12%. Canagliflozin increased Cmax of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel by 22%, but did not 
change the overall exposure. Cmax and AUCinf of simvastatin and of simvastatin acid were slightly 
increased by canagliflozin by numerically 9 – 12% (simvastatin) and 18 – 26% (simvastatin acid), 
respectively. No relevant PK interactions were observed at the level of CYP2C9 for Gliburide and 
Warfarin INF values were also not affected. Canagliflozin did not change the PK of Metformin by a 
clinically relevant amount. Co-administration of canagliflozin increased the Cmax of digoxin by 
about 36% and AUC levels by about 20%. Since Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic range this 
interaction is included in the SmPC. The assumed mechanism, an inhibition at the level of P-gp, is 
also relevant for other digitalis glycosides.  
Taken together the PK characteristics of canagliflozin are well characterized for healthy subjects 
and subjects with T2DM. The differences in exposure in the a.m. subgroups and the relevant 
interactions have been sufficiently addressed in the SmPC. 
The PD effect on UGE was more pronounced in patients with T2DM than in healthy subjects. There 
was a ceiling effect on RTG with daily doses ≥200 mg indicating a low potential of hypoglycaemia 
induced by canagliflozin even in case of overdosage. The exposure response relationship indicated 
that the EC50 values based on free (unbound) canagliflozin concentrations were 0.21 to 0.32 
ng/mL (0.5 to 0.7 nM). Considering the excretion of canagliflozin (<1%) , the concentrations of 
canagliflozin in the lumen of the proximal tubule was estimated to be similar to the unbound 
concentrations in plasma, which is about 6 to 8 times lower as compared to the estimated in vitro 
IC50 value of 4.2 nM. The applicant has pointed out that the low dissociation rate of canagliflozin 
from SGLT2 may provide an explanation for the difference between in vitro IC 50 values and 
estimated concentrations. 
In subjects with renal failure the effect on UGE was inversely related to renal function. In addition 
to the higher exposure in these patients the results in non-diabetic subjects suggested that, 
below a CLCR of 40 – 50 ml/min, a relevant clinical efficacy may not be expected. This is further 
discussed in the context of efficacy and safety in the clinical studies in patients with T2DM.  
Data on urinary output in response to canagliflozin has been presented in response by the 
Applicant. Urinary volume was moderately increased with a trend to a dose-response relationship, 
consistent with an osmotic diuresis. Serum creatinine and BUN increased moderately, transient 
mild increases in serum Mg and phosphate were observed, as well as transient increases in 
urinary excretion of sodium.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant performed several clinical pharmacology studies to investigate the relevant 
pharmacological aspects of canagliflozin. Overall, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were 
sufficiently investigated. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
Three Phase 2 studies and 9 Phase 3 studies have been submitted in support of the current 
application. The 9 Phase 3 studies, apart from providing support for the sought indication, also 
include one study in elderly and one study in patients with moderate renal impairment. 
The Phase 2 studies DIA2001 and TA-7284-04 were dose-finding studies. Study OBE2001 
investigated the effect of canagliflozin on body weight in non-diabetic subjects. This study is not 
considered relevant for the current application and will not be further discussed. 
Across the Phase 3 clinical studies, a total of 7,803 subjects were randomized and received at 
least 1 dose of study drug. This included 4,994 subjects treated with canagliflozin (100 mg or 300 
mg), 1,583 treated with placebo, and 1,226 treated with an active comparator (744 sitagliptin, 
482 glimepiride). 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study DIA2001 was a placebo-controlled dose-finding study for canagliflozin in T2DM subjects 
whose glycaemia was not optimally controlled with maximally (or near maximal) effective doses of 
metformin. A total of 451 subjects, randomized to 1 of 7 treatment groups (65 placebo, 64 
canagliflozin 50 mg qd, 64 canagliflozin 100 mg qd, 65 canagliflozin 200 mg qd, 64 canagliflozin 
300 mg qd, 64 canagliflozin 300 mg bid, 65 sitagliptin 100 mg qd), comprised the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) analysis set.  
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced across the treatment groups. 
Across all subjects, the mean baseline HbA1c value was 7.7%, the mean baseline BMI was 
31.5 kg/m2, and the median age was 54 years. Almost all subjects (96%) were receiving a daily 
dose of 1,500 mg metformin. A high proportion of subjects (89%) completed the 12-week 
treatment period. 
The results for the analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline in HbA1c to 
Week 12) and 2 major secondary endpoints (change from baseline in FPG and percent change from 
baseline in body weight at Week 12) are summarized for the placebo and canagliflozin dose groups 
in the table below.

Table 7: 
LOCF (Study DIA2001: Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set) 
 Summary of Primary and Major Secondary Efficacy Endpoints at Week 12 
A dose-response with regards to HbA1c was observed for the doses 50 to 300 mg canagliflozin, 
with no additional effect for the 300 mg bid dose. A less apparent dose-response was observed for 
FPG. The responder analysis supports the HbA1c data. The proportion of subjects with HbA1c 
values <7.0% at Week 12 (LOCF analysis) was 42%, 53%, 61%, 72%, and 65% for canagliflozin 
50 mg qd, 100 mg qd, 200 mg qd, 300 mg qd, and 300 mg bid treatment groups, respectively, 
compared to 34% for the placebo group. A dose-response was also observed for body weight with 
no additional effect at the 300 mg bid dose. Efficacy results for sitagliptin were consistent with 
published results. The data support the choice of the doses 100 mg and 300 mg once daily. 
Study TA-7284-04 was a placebo-controlled, dose-finding study in adults from Japan with T2DM of 
canagliflozin (50, 100, 200, 300 mg qd) as monotherapy that was conducted by the sponsor’s 
development partner, MTPC.  
A total of 382 subjects, randomized to 1 of 5 treatment groups, received at least 1 dose of study 
drug, and had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy measurement (primary analysis population): 75 
placebo, 82 canagliflozin 50 mg, 74 canagliflozin 100 mg, 76 canagliflozin 200 mg, and 75 
canagliflozin 300 mg. The baseline demographic and diabetic characteristics were generally 
balanced across the treatment groups. Across all subjects, the mean baseline HbA1c value was 
7.7%, and the mean baseline BMI was 25.7 kg/m2. Slightly more than one-half of subjects (56%) 
had not received prior treatment with an AHA. Most subjects (94%) completed the 12-week 
treatment period. 
The LS mean differences, compared to the placebo group, in the change from baseline to Week 12 
in HbA1c were -0.72%, -0.90%, -0.90%, and -0.99% in the canagliflozin 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 
and 300 mg groups, respectively.  
In this monotherapy study, the response to canagliflozin was slightly higher than in study DIA2001. 
A rather weak dose-response with regards to HbA1c was observed with no apparent difference 
between the 100mg and 200 mg dose. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The Phase 3 program consists of 9 studies, all pivotal to the sought indication. The studies can be 
grouped according to specific uses of canagliflozin in patients with T2DM: 
Canagliflozin  
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013  
Page 41/115 
 
 
 
 
 
- Canagliflozin as monotherapy was studied in DIA3005.  
- Canagliflozin as add-on to AHA monotherapy was studied in DIA3006, DIA3009 and DIA3008 
(sulfonylurea substudy).  
- Canagliflozin as add-on to dual combination AHA therapy was studied in DIA3002, DIA3012 and 
DIA3015.  
- Canagliflozin as add-on to insulin was studied in DIA3008 (insulin substudy).  
Further to this, studies were performed in patients with renal impairment (DIA3004) and in elderly 
(DIA3010). The cardiovascular safety study (CANVAS) (DIA3008) is still ongoing. 
The overall design of the developmental Phase III program was adequate. 
There were similarities in the design features for the Phase 3 studies, which are presented 
together.  
Methods 
● 
Design 
The design of the phase III studies differs dependent on the requirement for specific background 
diabetic treatment: the CANA phase III studies in which specific background diabetic therapy was 
required only patients already treated with the protocol-specified background therapy could directly 
enter a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. The other patients entered a dose-adjustment/ 
dose stable run-in period (8 to 12 weeks) in which they received only the protocol-specified AHA 
regimen. Those with inadequate glycaemic control at the week -2 visit entered the single-blind 
placebo run in period and were eligible to be randomised at day 1, if they met the other enrolment 
criteria. 
Several studies (DIA3004, DIA3008, and DIA3010) did not require a particular diabetes regimen; 
in these studies, subjects with inadequate glycaemic control meeting other study enrolment criteria 
had CANA added to their ongoing, current, stable diabetes treatment regimen. 
The placebo controlled phase III studies DIA3002, DIA3004, DIA3005, DIA3006, DIA3010 and 
DIA3012 had a core double blind period for evaluation of the primary endpoint at 26 weeks. For the 
DIA3008 Insulin and SU substudies the primary efficacy evaluation was at 18 weeks. In the two 
active comparator non-inferiority studies (DIA3009 glimepiride, DIA3015 sitagliptin) the primary 
efficacy endpoint was at 52 weeks. Each of the phase III studies except DIA3015, the DIA3005 
high glycaemic substudy, and the DIA3008 substudies had long-term extension treatment periods 
of up to 78 additional weeks. 
● 
Study Participants 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
Inadequate glycaemic control was defined in most of the studies as an HbA1c level of HbA1c 
≥7.0% and ≤10.5%, except for the high glycaemic study (substudy of study 3005), where the 
HbA1c entry criterion was ≥10 to ≤12% and for study DIA3009 where subjects were to have an 
HbA1c between ≥7.0% and ≤9.5%. Only subjects with a diagnosis of T2DM were eligible for 
enrolment. The age range was ≥18 to ≤80 years of age across most phase III studies. In DIA3004, 
the age range was ≥25 years with no upper age limit, in DIA3008 the age range was ≥30 years 
(with CV history) or ≥50 years (with presence of cardiovascular risk factors) with no upper age 
limit, and in DIA3010 the age range was ≥55 to ≤80 years. Both men and woman were eligible for 
enrolment in all phase III studies. Women were required to be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, 
or practicing birth control and could not be pregnant or breast feeding.

Exclusion criteria common to the majority of phase III studies were repeated FPG>270 mg/dL 
during the pre-treatment phase despite optimal diet and exercise, history of diabetic ketoacidosis, 
T1DM, pancreas or beta-cell transplantation, or diabetes secondary to pancreatitis and 
pancreatectomy, severe renal impairment, cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, unstable 
angina, revascularisation procedure or cerebrovascular accident) and uncontrolled hypertension. In 
addition, elevations of aminotransferase levels and bilirubin indicative for hepatic impairment were 
defined as exclusion criteria. 
● 
Treatments 
All studies included both CANA doses (100 and 300 mg), with the exception of study DIA3015 
which included only the 300 mg dose. 
Criteria for rescue 
The pre-specified glycaemic targets (which became more stringent in the course of the trial) for 
rescue or withdrawal were largely the same in each of the phase III studies. Subjects continued in 
the study (with no change in protocol-specified procedures) after rescue therapy was initiated. In 
DIA3015, there was no rescue therapy, and subjects meeting pre-specified glycaemic targets were 
withdrawn. The specific rescue therapy for each study was selected to be complementary to the 
type of background AHA therapy and with local prescribing practises.

ITT analysis sets are summarized for each phase III study in the following tables:

● 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in each of the phase III studies was the change from baseline 
in HbA1c at the primary assessment timepoint (Week 18, Week 26, or Week 52, depending on 
the study). Key secondary endpoints (associated with hypothesis testing in most of the phase 
III studies), were changes from baseline in FPG, the proportion achieving a HbA1c target of 
<7.0% (and <6.5%), changes from baseline in body weight, SBP, and lipid parameters (for 
results please refer to safety section). Pharmacodynamic endpoints assessed (in selected phase 
III studies) included RTG, and specific beta-cell function/ insulin secretion PD endpoints. 
● 
Randomisation 
All phase III studies and the phase IIb dose range studies DIA2001 and OBE-2001 used 
randomized, double-blind designs. Several studies used stratified randomization and Study3008 
used stratification to include patients into substudies. 
● 
Blinding 
Core periods of all phase III studies and the phase IIb dose range studies were double-blind. 
● 
Statistical methods 
All phase III studies submitted in support of the efficacy of canagliflozin used similar statistical 
methods and were adequately powered. Seven studies were designed to show the superiority of 
canagliflozin to placebo on HbA1c in different add-on scenarios, the remaining two studies were 
designed to show non-inferiority of canagliflozin to an active comparator on HbA1c. The primary 
analysis was conducted on the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set (all randomized 
patients with at least one dose). Missing values were imputed using a last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) approach. For the individual studies, supportive analyses were also conducted on 
the per protocol (PP) analysis set (mITT subset at primary assessment timepoint without rescue 
therapy and no major protocol violations), and the completer’s analysis set (mITT subset at 
primary assessment timepoint without rescue therapy). Sensitivity analyses using Mixed Models 
for Repeated Measures were additionally conducted. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for the phase III studies was the change in HbA1c from baseline to 
Week 18, Week 26 or Week 52. The analysis of the change from baseline in HbA1c was 
performed using an ANCOVA model that included the factor treatment and randomization 
stratification factors as fixed effects and the baseline HbA1c value as a covariate (baseline eGFR 
as additional covariate for DIA3004). Treatment differences between each canagliflozin group 
and the comparator (placebo or active comparator) were estimated as least-squares (LS) means 
with two-sided 95% confidence intervals. P-values for testing superiority were calculated for 
comparisons of the LS means. A similar analysis approach was used for the analysis of 
continuous secondary efficacy endpoints. A logistic regression model with treatment and 
stratification factors as fixed factors and baseline HbA1c as covariate (baseline eGFR as 
additional covariate for DIA3004) was used to analyze the secondary categorical endpoint of the 
proportion of subjects with HbA1c <7.0%. In each Phase III study, a pre-specified sequential 
testing procedure (and incorporation of a Hochberg procedure to split type I error spent) was 
used for testing the treatment differences of the primary and major secondary efficacy endpoints 
which controls the family-wise type I error rate at 5%. A non-inferiority margin of 0.3% was 
used for comparisons of canagliflozin after 52 weeks of treatment in the non-inferiority studies.

In case non-inferiority was demonstrated, a step-down procedure to superiority assessment was 
foreseen. Assay sensitivity in these studies was established by examining the efficacy of the 
comparator over the double-blind treatment period. 
Summary of results of individual phase III studies 
Monotherapy study (DIA3005) 
Study DIA3005: this study evaluated the efficacy of canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg, 
administered as monotherapy in adults with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control on diet 
and exercise. The study included a main study in 584 subjects who had mild to moderate 
baseline hyperglycemia (HbA1c ≥7.0% to ≤10.0%) randomized to placebo or CANA (100mg or 
300mg), and a high glycaemic substudy that included 91 subjects with a baseline HbA1c of 
>10.0% to ≤12.0% randomized to active therapy with either CANA dose (100mg or 300 mg). In 
both study components, subjects were treated over a core double-blind period of 26 weeks. 
A high proportion of subjects (87%) in the DIA3005 main study completed 26 weeks of double 
blind treatment, with the rate of discontinuation higher in the placebo group (17%) than in either 
the canagliflozin 100 mg (12%) or 300 mg (11%) groups. 
Results for the main study showed clinically relevant, dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c at 
week 26 of -1.16% for canagliflozin 300 mg relative to placebo (p<0.001) and –0.91% for 
canagliflozin 100 mg relative to placebo (p<0.001). Results of the primary analysis were 
supported by results on secondary glycaemic parameters with dose-dependent reductions in FPG, 
proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c goals and body weight. The number of patients in need 
for rescue medication was below 3% in each CANA group (compared to 22.9% in the placebo 
group). Blood pressure was reduced in a dose-dependent and clinical relevant fashion: reductions 
in SBP from baseline to week 26 were -3.34mmHg and -5.04mmHg with CANA 100 mg and 300 
mg, compared to 0.38 mmHg with placebo. Modest reductions were seen for diastolic blood 
pressure in both CANA groups compared to placebo (-1.67mmHg and -2.14mmHg with CANA 
100 mg and 300 mg, compared to -0.10 with placebo). 
Key features and results of this study are summarised in the following table:

High glycaemic substudy: The 91 subjects comprising the mITT analysis set for the DIA3005 
high glycaemic substudy had a mean baseline HbA1c of 10.6% No hypothesis testing was planned 
for this substudy. Mean changes from baseline to week 26 in HbA1c (LOCF) were -2.13% and -
2.56% for canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively. Twelve% to 17% of subjects achieved 
target control (HbA1c <7.0%). The lower number of responders as compared to other phase III 
studies can be explained by a high baseline HbA1c above 10% in this study. Results on 
secondary endpoints supported the findings on HbA1c: descriptive summaries of primary and 
secondary endpoints are displayed in the following table:

Generally, this study supports the efficacy of CANA as monotherapy. 
Studies add-on to AHA monotherapy (DIA3006, DIA 3009) 
Study DIA3006: this study aimed at investigating the add-on use of CANA in subjects with 
inadequate glycaemic control on (sub)maximal doses of metformin. It included 1,284 subjects 
treated over the 26-week core double-blind period. A sitagliptin 100 mg treatment arm was also 
included, although no formal statistical testing was planned or performed for the 26-week 
double-blind period. 
A total of 87% of treated subjects completed 26 weeks of treatment, with the proportion of 
subjects discontinued prior to the Week 26 visit modestly higher in the placebo group (15%) 
compared to the canagliflozin 100mg (13%), canagliflozin 300mg (12%), and sitagliptin (13%) 
groups. 
The change from baseline in HbA1c at week 26 for CANA 300mg relative to placebo was –0.77% 
(p<0.001) and –0.62% (p<0.001) for CANA 100 mg. The placebo-subtracted HbA1c lowering 
response at week 26 for sitagliptin 100mg was -0.66%. Both doses of CANA also achieved 
statistical significance with respect to the secondary endpoints of FPG, proportion achieving HbA1c 
target, and 2-hour PPG (during a MMTT procedure). Body weight decreased modestly with the 
CANA groups compared to placebo (placebo-adjusted changes from baseline -2.5% and -2.9%). 
The effect of sitagliptin on body weight was neutral. Blood pressure was clinically relevantly 
influenced by both dose strengths of CANA (SBP: -3.84mmHg and -5.06mmHg with CANA 100 
mg and 300 mg, 1.52mmHg with placebo, -1.83mmHg with sitagliptin; DBP: -2.19 mmHg and 
3.09mmHg with CANA 100 mg and 300 mg, 0.28mmHg with placebo, -1.11 mmHg with 
sitagliptin). 
The improvement in fasting insulin secretion (numerically superior over sitagliptin) measured by 
HOMA2-%B is notable given the lack of any direct effect of CANA to stimulate beta-cell insulin 
secretion. The improvement in HOMA2-%B may be explained by the reversal of glucotoxicity 
leading to improved beta-cell function.

Study DIA3009: this study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of CANA 300 mg and 
100 mg compared to the SU, glimepiride, as add-on therapy in subjects with inadequate 
glycaemic control on (sub)maximal doses of metformin. The study included a 52-week core 
active-controlled double-blind treatment phase, followed by a 52-week extension active-
controlled, double-blind treatment period. 
A total of 1,452 subjects were randomised to CANA 100 mg, CANA 300 mg, placebo or 
glimepiride. The mean maximum dose achieved with glimepiride was 6 mg, and as such, the 
active comparator was sufficiently up-titrated. A non-inferiority margin of 0.3% was selected. 
At baseline, 95% of subjects had a metformin total daily dose at least 2,000 mg/day, and almost 
all (99%) subjects remained on stable doses of metformin during the double-blind period, as 
specified by the protocol.  
In the CANA 100mg and 300mg groups the mean changes from baseline in HbA1c at week 52 
showed a reduction of -0.78% and -0.89%, respectively, compared to a change of- 0.79% in the 
glimepiride group. The upper limits of both 95% CIs for the difference in HbA1c for each CANA 
dose comparison to glimepiride were less than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin of 0.3%. 
A step-down to an assessment of superiority was pre-specified; the upper limit of the 95% CI 
between CANA 300 mg and glimepiride was <0%, demonstrating superiority for CANA to 
glimepiride. The HbA1c lowering response to CANA 100 mg was not superior to that of 
glimepiride in this study. The absolute HbA1c reductions in the three treatment arms were about 
-0.7% and are considered to be clinically relevant, although the true effect cannot be assessed in 
the absence of a placebo arm. 
The results on the secondary glycaemic endpoints (FPG lowering, proportion of responders) 
generally supported those on HbA1c. Body weight decreased in the CANA groups compared to a 
small gain in the glimepiride group. A substudy investigating body composition showed that fat 
loss contributed significantly to body weight reduction. Glimepiride-substracted change in systolic 
blood pressure was -3.48mmHg and -4.76mmHg for the 100mg and 300 mg dose, respectively. 
Trends in favour of CANA as compared to glimepiride were also shown for measures of beta cell 
function (HOMA-2%B). Notably, the improvement in HOMA-2%B was numerically superior to 
glimepiride which acts directly at the beta cell. Reversal of of glucotoxicity leading to improved 
beta-cell function may play a role. 
With glimepiride the durability of HbA1c lowering was worse compared to both CANA doses which 
showed little change through week 52. The waning of effect is known for insulin secretagogues. 
Durability of the effect of CANA can be further assessed based on data of the long term extension 
study.

Overall, this study showed non-inferior efficacy and suggests better durability of the effect of 
both CANA doses compared to SU treatment when added to metformin. 
Glimepiride-substracted change in systolic blood pressure was -3.48mmHg and -4.76mmHg for 
the 100mg and 300 mg dose, respectively.

Studies add-on to dual combination AHA therapy (DIA3002, DIA3012, DIA3015) 
Study DIA3002: the aim of this study was to examine the add-on use of CANA compared to 
placebo in subjects with inadequate glycaemic control on (sub)maximal doses of metformin and 
SU. A total of 469 patients were randomised and 381 patients completed the 26 week double 
blind treatment. The percentage of patients who were discontinued prior to week 26 was 
modestly higher in the placebo group compared to the pooled canagliflozin group (21% vs. 
18%). At baseline, 90% of subjects were on a metformin total daily dose of at least 2,000 
mg/day, and 97% subjects received the minimum daily dose for a SU as required by the 
protocol. Through week 26, 99% and 96% of subjects remained on stable doses of metformin 
and of SU, respectively, as specified by the protocol. 
The mean change in HbA1c was statistically significantly higher in both CANA groups compared 
to placebo. The reductions at both doses (-0.92% and -0.71% for CANA 300 mg and 100mg, 
respectively, placebo-adjusted change from baseline at week 26) were clinically relevant. The 
results of the secondary glycaemic endpoints (FPG lowering, proportion of responders) generally 
supported those on HbA1c. Only a relatively small decrease in body weight with the CANA groups 
compared to placebo was observed in this study, likely due to the concomitant treatment with 
SUs (-2% and -2.6% in the CANA 100mg and 300mg groups, respectively, compared to a 
change of -0.6% in the placebo group). Trends in favour or CANA were shown for SBP, while the 
reduction of DBP was borderline clinically relevant (SBP: -4.89mmHg and -4.27mmHg with CANA 
100mg and 300mg and -2.65mmHg with placebo; DBP: -2.85mmHg and -2.25mmHg with CANA 
100mg and 300 mg and -1.72mmHg with placebo). 
Notably, the effect on HbA1c and FPG was achieved by week 12 for both doses of CANA. A small 
but inconsistent increase from week 12 to week 26 in HbA1c was observed with CANA 100 mg. 
The profile of FPG change from baseline to week 26 showed a nadir at week 6 in both CANA 
groups with a modest rise, more evident in the 100 mg group. Data of the ongoing double-blind

extension period of this study may provide further understanding of the course of HbA1c over 
time. However, comparisons of the durability of HbA1c lowering of CANA with active comparators 
(studies DIA3009 and 3015) showed superior durability of both CANA doses.  
Generally, this study supports the efficacy of both doses of CANA as add-on to a background 
therapy of metformin and SU.

Study 3012: the aim of this study was to examine the add-on use of CANA in subjects with 
inadequate glycaemic control on (sub)maximal doses of metformin and pioglitazone. 
Of the 342 randomized and dosed subjects, 87% completed 26 weeks of double-blind treatment, 
with the proportion of subjects who were discontinued prior to Week 26 higher in the placebo 
group versus the pooled canagliflozin group (21% vs 10%). At baseline, 91% of subjects had a 
metformin total daily dose at least 2,000mg/day; 68% of subjects were on pioglitazone 30 mg 
and 32% were on pioglitazone 45 mg. Through week 26, almost all subjects remained on stable 
doses of metformin and PIO, as specified by the protocol. 
Mean change in HbA1c was statistically significantly higher in both CANA groups compared to 
placebo. The reductions at both doses (-0.76% and -0.62% for CANA 300 mg and 100mg, 
respectively, placebo-substracted change from baseline at week 26) were clinically relevant. The 
results on the secondary glycaemic endpoints (FPG lowering, proportion of responders) generally 
supported those on HbA1c. Body weight decreased in both CANA groups compared to placebo. 
Clinical relevant improvements were shown for SBP and DBP: reductions from baseline to week 
26 were achieved in the 100mg and 300mg CANA groups compared to placebo (SBP: placebo -
1.67 mmHg, CANA 100mg -5.13 mmHg, CANA300 mg -4.62mmHg; DBP: placebo -1.18 mmHg, 
CANA 100mg -2.83 mmHg, CANA 300 mg -3.52 mmHg).  
Generally, this study supports the efficacy of both doses of CANA as add-on to a background 
therapy of metformin and pioglitazone.

Study DIA 3015: the aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of CANA 300 
mg compared to the DDP-inhibitor sitagliptin, both as add-on therapy to (sub)maximal doses of 
metformin and SU. It included 755 randomized and dosed subjects treated over the 52-week 
double-blind period. The proportion of subjects who completed 52 weeks of treatment was higher 
for the canagliflozin 300 mg group (67%) than for the sitagliptin group (56%), which was 
primarily due to a higher proportion of subjects in the sitagliptin group who were discontinued 
from the study due to meeting glycaemic withdrawal criteria (23% vs 11% for canagliflozin). 
(Note: in DIA3015, subjects meeting prespecified glycaemic targets were to be withdrawn from 
the study instead of being treated with rescue therapy, which contributed substantially to the 
lower completion rate in DIA3015 compared to the other phase III studies.) The remaining 
percentage of subjects who discontinued from this study from each treatment group (21% for 
sitagliptin and 22% for canagliflozin 300 mg) is consistent with the percentage seen in the other 
52-week canagliflozin phase III study (DIA3009).  
During the double-blind period, 98% and 90% of subjects remained on stable doses of 
metformin and of SU, respectively, as specified by the protocol. The lower percentage of subjects 
remaining on a stable dose of SU than metformin mainly reflects downtitration of the SU to avoid 
hypoglycemia; there was no difference between the canagliflozin and sitagliptin groups in the 
percentage of subjects having a decrease in SU dose (8% and 9%, respectively). 
The mean change in HbA1c showed clinically relevant improvements in both treatment arms with 
changes from baseline of -1.03% and -0.66%, respectively. Since the upper limit of the 95% CI 
for the difference in HbA1c between CANA and sitagliptin was less than 0 (-0.25%) even 
superiority of CANA could be demonstrated. Over the 52 week treatment period the response 
was attenuated to a greater extent with sitagliptin suggesting better durability of effect with 
CANA.

The results on the number of responders as well on FPG showed consistent results. Body weight 
was decreased by 2.5% with CANA 300 mg while sitagliptin showed a neutral effect.  
In addition, clinically relevant reductions of SBP and DBP were observed in the CANA group with 
little change of these parameters in the sitagliptin treated patients: Treatment with CANA led to a 
decrease in systolic blood pressure of -5.7 mmHg, compared to an increase of 0.7mmHg in the 
sitagliptin 100 mg dose. Diastolic blood pressure decreased with CANA 300 mg by -3.28 mmHg 
and by -0.32 mmHg with sitagliptin 100 mg. 
CANA 300 mg seems to improve beta-cell function (improvement of HOMA2%-B and by FS-MMTT 
derived measures of beta-cell function) compared to sitagliptin. 
This non-inferiority study did not investigate the CANA 100 mg dose applied for. However, there 
are data from other studies (DIA2001, DIA3006) investigating sitagliptin and CANA 100 mg, 
which show clinically relevant antihyperglycaemic efficacy in the same order of magnitude for 
both active treatments. Although no formal non-inferiority comparison was performed in these 
studies these data are considered to support an add-on claim of CANA 100 mg in patients pre-
treated with metformin and SU. 
Overall, this study demonstrates non-inferior and even superior efficacy of CANA compared to 
sitagliptin.

Cardiovascular assessment study with efficacy substudies (DIA3008 and substudies) 
Study DIA3008: CANVAS is a placebo-controlled, 3 parallel-group study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and CV risk with CANA plus standard of care relative to placebo plus standard of care 
in subjects with T2DM, on a wide range of current antihyperglycaemic agents (AHAs), who had 
either a history or high risk of CV disease. 
Subjects were randomized to treatment with CANA (100 mg or 300 mg) or placebo in a 1:1:1 
randomization ratio. CANVAS is an event-driven study, with the study duration based on the 
occurrence of sufficient events to evaluate the study hypothesis and objectives. It is planned to 
enrol approximately 4500 subjects in the study. The sample size was determined based upon a 
sufficient number of MACE plus hospitalised unstable angina events (assuming a per annum 
event rate of 2.25%) to support a planned meta-analysis of CV data from this study (and other 
CANA phase III studies).  
With the CANVAS study the Applicant addressed the requirement as set out in CPMP/ 
EWP/1080/00 Rev.1 that the development programme of drugs for the treatment of T2DM 
“provides sufficient information supporting the lack of a drug induced excess cardiovascular risk”. 
Cardiovascular high risk patients will be followed for a minimum of 4 years in this event driven 
study and blinded data will be monitored for MACE. Results of the interim safety analysis (data

results showed no meaningful differences in the incidence of death, with a lower frequency of 
death in the combined CANA groups (0.7%) relative to the placebo group (0.9%).

DIA3008 (Insulin substudy): the aim of this substudy was to investigate the add-on use of 
CANA to insulin in CV high risk subjects with inadequate glycaemic control, either as 
monotherapy or in combination with metformin or any other AHA(s). 
Most of the 1,718 randomized and dosed subjects (population 2 = subjects on insulin ≥30IE/day) 
completed the 18 week substudy (93%), and the proportion of subjects who were discontinued 
prior to week 18 was modestly higher in the placebo group (9%) than in the pooled canagliflozin 
group (7%). The overall mean insulin dose at baseline was 83 IU/day, and 70% of subjects were 
on a background of basal (ie, long-acting) plus bolus (short-acting) insulin prior to baseline, 
while 20% of subjects were on a background of basal insulin alone and 9% were on a 
background of bolus insulin alone (not specified for 1%). Approximately 90% of subjects 
remained on stable doses of insulin during the 18-week substudy, as specified by the protocol, 
unless down-titration was considered necessary to avoid hypoglycaemia, or if rescue criteria 
were met. 
Clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c at week 18 compared to placebo were observed with both 
doses of CANA (placebo-adjusted changes from baseline: -0.72% and -0.63% for CANA 300 mg 
and 100 mg, respectively, population 2). The other glycaemic endpoints tested (FPG lowering, 
proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7%) were statistically significantly superior to placebo 
for both CANA doses. Of note, albeit smaller compared to effects in other phase III studies, some

reductions of body weight were seen with both CANA doses in the presence of ongoing insulin 
therapy.  
Significant, dose-dependent reductions from baseline to week 26 were achieved in SBP with the 
100 mg and 300 mg CANA doses compared to placebo (SBP: -4.57mmHg and -6.94 mmHg with 
the 100 mg and 300 mg dose, respectively, placebo -2.47mmHg). Reductions in DBP were less 
pronounced: -1.86 mmHg and -2.95 mmHg with CANA 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively 
(placebo:-1.23mmHg). 
In the CANA groups background insulin dose could be decreased in a greater proportion of 
patients as compared to placebo (12% and 10% in the CANA 300 mg and 100 mg group, 
respectively, compared to 4% in the placebo group). Reduction of insulin requirements and 
alleviation of insulin induced weight gain are considered desirable effects of CANA in the 
frequently obese population of patients with T2M. Sustainability of the decrease in insulin 
requirements was, however, comparable between the CANA and the placebo groups. Glycaemic 
control (HbA1c) in the subgroup of patients who decreased their insulin dosage was comparable 
to the results of the primary analysis. Reduction of insulin requirements and alleviation ofinsulin 
induced weight gain are considered desirable effects of CANA in the frequently obese population 
of patients with T2M 
Overall, this study supports the efficacy of both doses of CANA in combination with insulin with or 
without other AHAs, predominantly metformin.

Study 3008 (SU substudy) the aim of this substudy was to investigate the add-on use of CANA 
in CV high risk subjects with inadequate glycaemic control in the subgroup of subjects receiving 
SU monotherapy at a protocol pre-specified dose. However, due to misstratification population 1 
was the pre-specified population of interest which is acceptable. For this study a total of 127 
patients in population 1 were randomised to CANA 100mg, 300 mg or placebo. About 7% of 
patient discontinued with the majority in the placebo group (patients in need for rescue therapy). 
Clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c at week 18 compared to placebo were observed with both 
doses of CANA (% changes from baseline compared to placebo -0.83% and -0.74% for CANA 
300 mg and 100 mg, respectively, population 1). The other glycaemic endpoints tested (FPG 
lowering, proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7%) generally supported the findings on 
HbA1c. Numerically superior effects on body weight were shown. As regards systolic blood 
pressure statistically non-significant, dose-dependent reductions from baseline to week 18 were 
achieved with the 100 mg and 300 mg CANA groups compared to placebo (SBP: -4.04mmHg and 
-4.22 mmHg with the 100 mg and 300 mg dose, respectively, placebo -3.70 mmHg). Reductions 
in DBP were as follows: -3.48 mmHg (baseline 82 mmHg) and -1.88 mmHg (baseline 76 mmHg) 
with CANA 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively (placebo:-0.9 mmHg). 
During the 18-week substudy, 100% and 98% of subjects in Population 1 and 2, respectively, 
remained on stable doses of the SU agent that they were on at randomization, as specified by 
the protocol. In population 2 there were 3 decreases in the combined CANA group and no 
decrease in the placebo group. 
Results on HbA1c in the subgroup of moderately renally impaired patients in population 1 were 
not presented in the study report and should be submitted by the Applicant. 
Overall, this study supports the efficacy of both doses of CANA as add-on to SU.

Clinical studies in special populations (DIA3004 and DIA3010) 
Study DIA3004: this study aimed to investigate the add-on use of canagliflozin in patients with 
T2DM with inadequate glycaemic control and having moderate renal impairment with an GFR of 
≥30 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 while either not receiving background therapy with an AHA or on 
a stable AHA regimen that could have included oral agents and/or insulin therapy. A high 
proportion of 269 randomized and dosed subjects (87%) completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 
the proportion that were discontinued prior to the week 26 visit was lower in the canagliflozin 
300 mg group (8%) than in the placebo (14%) or canagliflozin 100 mg (17%) groups. Most 
subjects (98%) were taking at least 1 AHA agent, and nearly 60% were on 2 or more classes of 
AHA agents; 74% of subjects were treated with insulin alone or in combination with another 
AHA. 
Concerning the primary efficacy endpoint mean change in HbA1c was statistically significantly 
higher in both CANA groups compared to placebo. The reductions at both doses were -0.30% 
and -0.40% for CANA 300 mg and 100mg, respectively, placebo-subtracted change from 
baseline at week 26). The smaller effect size on HbA1c in patients with lower baseline GFR is 
expected in view of CANA`s mechanism of action (rate of UGE linearly related to GFR).  
CANA treatment was associated by a greater proportion of subjects who achieved goal HbA1c 
<7% compared to placebo. Results on FPG were numerically in favour of CANA. The results for 
body weight are numerically in favour of CANA. Nearly the full effect on body weight was 
achieved at week 6 with only minimal further reduction observed for both CANA doses. As

regards systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions from baseline to week 26 were achieved 
with the 100 mg and 300 mg CANA groups compared to placebo. The reduction in SBP and DBP 
were more pronounced in the 300 mg relative to the 100 mg group (SBP: placebo -0.32mmHg, 
CANA 100 mg -6.05mmHg, CANA 300 mg -6.44mmHg; DBP: placebo -1.39mmHg, CANA 100mg 
-2.57mmHg, CANA 300 mg-3.46mmHg).

Study DIA3010: this study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in 
older subjects not adequately controlled on current glucose lowering therapy (HbA1c of ≥7.0 to 
≤10.0%), and to assess body composition and bone safety using DXA in a subset of subjects. The 
mITT analysis set was comprised of 714 subjects (median age of 63 years, range 55 to 80 years,

while a total of 211 subjects participated in the body composition substudy. A high proportion of 
subjects (89%) completed 26 weeks of double-blind treatment, and the proportion of subjects 
who were discontinued prior to week 26 was higher in the placebo group versus the pooled 
canagliflozin group (17% vs. 9%). The design of the study differs from most of the other phase 
III studies in that it examines the add-on use of CANA to existing diabetes treatment rather than 
add-on to a predefined AHA regimen. Almost all subjects (98%) were taking at least 1 AHA agent 
(49% on a SU and 33% on insulin), and 76% of subjects were on 2 or more classes of AHA 
agents. 
Overall, CANA showed statistically significant and clinically relevant as well as dose-dependent 
improvement in glycaemic control in patients with T2DM on various antidiabetic background 
therapies. The primary efficacy endpoint mean change in HbA1c was statistically significantly 
higher in both CANA groups compared to placebo (change from baseline in HbA1c at week 26 for 
CANA 300 mg relative to placebo -0.7% for 300 mg and -0.57% for 100 mg). Other 
antihyperglycaemic efficacy parameters (FPG, responder analysis) supported these results. 
Results of the subgroup analysis investigating the effect on HbA1c according to age group (<65 
years versus ≥65 years) showed a marked decrease in effect in the older patient group 
(reduction in HbA1c with 300 mg CANA -0.50% and with CANA 100 mg -0.45% compared to -
0.82% and -0.65% in the younger age group). This difference might be partly explained by a 
slightly lower baseline HbA1c in the older age group (7.8% vs 7.6%) and – to a greater extent – 
by a lower baseline GFR in this group. Age per se was not found to be a factor influencing 
efficacy of another SGLT2-inhibitor and also did not affect the efficacy of CANA (see section 3.6).  
The age distribution in this study does not differ markedly from the one in the other phase III 
studies and – despite the study’s goal to investigate the efficacy and safety of CANA in older 
patients with T2DM - less than 3% of patients were between 65 and 75 years of age, below 1% 
between 75 and 85 years and no patient was above 85 years. 
However, in the whole phase III population a sufficient number of older patients was included, 
and results on HbA1c reduction showed clinically relevant effects even in the patients above 75 
years of age (age group ≤75 years: CANA 100 mg -0.77%, CANA 300 mg -0.68%, placebo -
0.13%; age group<75 years CANA 100 mg -0.69%, CANA 300 mg -0.85%, placebo -0.15%, see 
section 3.6). 
Results of subgroup analyses on study DIA3010 investigating the effect on HbA1c according to 
baseline GFR values showed results comparable to those of study 3004: the antihyperglycaemic 
efficacy in moderately renally impaired patients was of borderline clinical significance. 
As regards systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions from baseline to week 26 were 
achieved with the 100 mg and 300 mg CANA groups compared to placebo. The reduction in SBP 
and DBP were more pronounced in the 300 mg relative to the 100 mg group (SBP change from 
baseline to week 26 [mmHg]: CANA 100 mg -3.96, CANA 300 mg -7.47, placebo 0.30; DBP 
change from baseline to week 26[mmHg] : CANA 100 mg -1.97, CANA 300 mg -3.48, placebo -
0.49). 
Body weight was significantly reduced with CANA in a dose dependent fashion. Body composition 
measurements performed in a subgroup of patients showed that fat mass loss accounted for 
approximately two-thirds of overall body mass reduction. This finding showed that, albeit a 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 64/115 
 
  
  
portion of the weight loss with CANA could be attributed to fluid loss (osmotic diuresis 
accompanying the increase in UGE), the majority of the total absolute weight loss was through 
loss of fat mass. The results are in line with those of study DIA 3009 and those observed for 
another SGLT2-inhibitor, and the relative reduction in fat and lean mass are similar to those 
achieved with dieting. 
Overall, this study supports the efficacy of CANA in combination with various background 
therapies but does not specifically contribute to the evaluation of efficacy and safety of CANA in 
older patients. However, the whole phase III program included enough older patients with results 
showing clinically relevant antihyperglycaemic efficacy of both doses of CANA.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
To assess how subgroup factors impact glycaemic responses to CANA subgroup analyses were 
performed: the overall pooled population of placebo-controlled studies for subgroup 
analyses of efficacy endpoints comprised 4158 subjects from the ITT analysis sets of DIA3005 
main study, DIA3006, DIA 3008 SU substudy, DIA3002, DIA3012, and DIA3008 insulin substudy. 
Baseline characteristics were generally similar across the pooled CANA 100 mg, CANA 300 mg 
group, and placebo treatment group. In each pooled treatment group, there was a slightly higher 
proportion of males compared with females. The median age was 60 years, a total of 1031 
(25%) patients was 65-<75 years of age, and a total of 183 subjects (4%) were 75 years or 
older, with one subject being ≥85 years of age. Approximately three-quarters of pooled 
population subjects were white, 4% black or African American, and 13% Asian; 18% of subjects 
were Hispanic-Latino. 
A total of 63% of subjects were obese, as indicated by a baseline BMI of ≥30 kg/m2. The mean 
HbA1c at baseline was 8.1% and the duration of diabetes was 10 years in each pooled treatment 
group. At baseline 12% of subjects had moderate renal impairment; the mean eGFR value in the 
pooled population was 82.1 mL/ min/ 1.73m2. No baseline imbalances occurred with respect to 
anthropometric and disease characteristics. 
Subgroup analyses of change in HbA1c 
The change from baseline in HbA1c within each of the predefined subgroups for the pooled 
population of placebo-controlled studies is presented in the following forest plot: 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 69/115 
 
  
  
 
Overall, the mean change from baseline in HbA1c at the primary assessment time point, relative 
to placebo, was -0.83% (95%CI: [-0.892;-0.771] for the 300 mg dose and -0.69% (95%CI:[-
0.749;-0.627] for the 100 mg dose. Hence, results in the pooled dataset are generally consistent 
with results of the individual studies. 
Results on body weight in the pooled dataset of placebo controlled studies 
In the pooled dataset of placebo controlled studies the mean percent change from baseline in 
body weight at the primary assessment timepoint, relative to placebo, was -2.7% (95% CI: [-
2.9;-2.4]) for the 300 mg dose and -2.0% (95% CI: [-2.3;-1.8]) for the 100 mg dose.

and 100 mg groups for the pooled population of placebo-controlled studies were -2.43 kg (95% 
CI: [-2.652;-2.199]) and -1.84 kg (95% CI: [-2.064;-1.611]), respectively. 
The treatment-by-subgroup interactions were not significant (p >0.10) for subgroups defined by 
sex, age, baseline BMI, ethnicity and region. Subgroup analyses of particular interest which 
demonstrated an impact on the magnitude of HbA1c lowering response to CANA were the 
subgroup analyses by baseline HbA1c and the subgroup analysis by baseline GFR. 
Subgroup analysis by baseline HbA1c: Unsurprisingly, there was a significant interaction 
observed with HbA1c baseline values: the most prominent effect occurred in patients with high 
baseline values. The effect (placebo substracted LS mean change) was -0.63% and -0.47% for 
CANA 300 mg and 100 mg, respectively, in the HbA1c <8% subgroup, -1.15% and -1.01%, 
respectively, in the HbA1c 8-9% subgroup, and -1.6% and -1.08% in the HbA1c ≥9% subgroup.  
Subgroup analysis by baseline GFR: Reductions in HbA1c were reduced in a stepwise manner 
with lower baseline GFR: -0.56% and -0.48% for the <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroup, -0.80% 
and -0.63%, for 60-<90 mL/min/1.73 m2 subgroup, and -1.01% and -0.87% for ≥90 
mL/min/1.73m2 subgroup, for CANA 300 mg and 100mg, respectively. The mean baseline GFR 
values at baseline were 50.6, 75.4, and 104.5 in the <60, 60 to <90, and ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2 
groups, respectively, of the overall pooled population of placebo controlled studies. The HbA1c 
reduction observed in pooled datasets were higher as compared to the results in study DIA3004 
(-0.3% and -0.4% placebo corrected change from baseline for CANA 100 mg and CANA 300 mg, 
respectively), which is likely due to the difference in baseline GFR values (39.4 mL/min/1.73m2 
in study DIA3004 and 50.6 mL/min/1.73m2 in the pooled population of placebo controlled 
studies). 
Efficacy of CANA was also evaluated in the pooled population of patients with moderate 
renal impairment (all subjects from placebo-controlled phase III studies with GFR ≥30 to<60 
mL/min/1.73 m2). This population comprised a total of 1085 treated subjects. Baseline 
characteristics were similar across treatment groups. In this population HbA1c decreased from 
baseline by -0.47% and -0.38% for CANA 300 mg and 100 mg, respectively, compared to 
placebo. 
Results were provided for 2 subgroup classifications defined by baseline GFR (<45 and ≥45 
mL/min/1.73 m2and <50 and ≥50 mL/min/1.73 m2). In this population the subgroup of patients 
with GFR< 45 mL/min/1.73m2 showed clinically questionable to insufficient HbA1c reductions of -
0.39% and -0.23% with CANA 300 mg and 100 mg, respectively. Results are given in the 
following table:

Results for HbA1c after completion of the 52-weeks extension periods (submitted on 
day 120) 
The Applicant submitted 52-week data for 4 of the phase 3 studies (DIA3005, DIA3006, 
DIA3002, DIA3004). Percent changes from baseline to week 52 in HbA1c, FPG, body weight, SBP 
and DBP, and fasting plasma lipids (including LDL-C, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, ratio 
of LDL-C to HDL-C, and triglycerides) for the mITT, extension mITT and the 52-week completer’s 
analysis sets were summarized with descriptive statistics. No treatment differences were 
estimated. Results for HbA1c change from baseline to week 52 for the mITT set are given in the 
following table:

In studies DIA 3005, DIA 3006, DIA 3002 durability of the anti-hyperglycaemic effect could be 
demonstrated for CANA over the 52 week period. Clinical relevant anti-hyperglycaemic effects 
were corroborated in the extension mITT analysis set (all patients in the mITT analysis set who 
did not receive rescue therapy) in each of the three studies (DIA 3005, DIA 3002, DIA3006): 
In study DIA 3005 in the extension mITT analysis set (166 patients on CANA 100 mg, 166 
patients on CANA 300 mg) the LS mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52 was -1.11% 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013

for the canagliflozin 300 mg group and -0.81% for the canagliflozin 100 mg group. In both 
treatment groups, decreases from baseline were most rapid through Week 12, and were more 
gradual through Week 34, with small changes subsequently observed. 
In study DIA 3002 in the extension mITT analysis set (125 patients on CANA 100 mg, 125 
patients on CANA 300 mg) the LS mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52 was -0.87% 
for the canagliflozin 300 mg group and -0.63% for the canagliflozin 100 mg group. 
In study DIA 3006 in the extension mITT analysis set (311 patients on CANA 100 mg, 320 
patients on CANA 300 mg, 295 patients on sitagliptin) the LS mean change from baseline in 
HbA1c at Week 52 was -0.93% for the canagliflozin 300 mg group, -0.77% for the canagliflozin 
100 mg group and -0.75% for sitagliptin. 
Effects on blood pressure, body weight and fasting plasma lipids were maintained through week 
52 in studies DIA3005, DIA 3006 and DIA 3002. 
In study DIA3004 (subpopulation of renally impaired subjects, mean baseline GFR 39.4 ml/ min/ 
1.73m2, range 24.0-61.0 ml/ min/ 1.73 m2) the antihyperglycaemic efficacy at week 26 was of 
borderline clinical relevance (-0.3% and -0.4% placebo corrected change from baseline for CANA 
100 mg and CANA 300 mg, respectively). The 52 week data showed no further decline in 
antihyperglycaemic efficacy (-0.27% and -0.41% placebo corrected change from baseline for 
CANA 100 mg and CANA 300 mg). The clinical relevant effects on SBP and DBP observed at week 
26 were maintained through week 52. Body weight reduction was about 1-2% for both doses at 
week 26 and did not change through week 52.

The antihyperglycaemic efficacy demonstrated for both CANA doses in studies DIA3002, DIA3005 
and DIA 3006 during the core study periods (26 week) is maintained through week 52. Likewise, 
effects in blood pressure, body weight and fasting plasma lipids were maintained. 
Antihyperglycaemic efficacy in study DIA3004 was of borderline clinical relevance at week 26. 
There was no further decline through week 52. 
Overall, durability of action of both CANA doses is not a concern.  
Clinical studies in special populations 
Placebo-controlled Study in Moderate Renal Impairment– DIA3004 
DIA3004 was designed to support the add-on use of canagliflozin in patients with T2DM with 
inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c of ≥7.0% to ≤10.5%) and having moderate renal 
impairment with an eGFR of ≥30 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2 while either not receiving 
background therapy with an AHA or on a stable AHA regimen that could have included oral 
agents and/or insulin therapy. A high proportion of 269 randomized and dosed subjects (87%) 
completed 26 weeks of treatment, and the proportion that were discontinued prior to the Week 
26 visit was lower in the canagliflozin 300 mg group (8%) than in the placebo (14%) or 
canagliflozin 100 mg (17%) groups. Thus, discontinuation rates in the study including patients 
with moderate renal impairment were low, indication that canagliflozin was well tolerated. 
Most subjects (98%) were taking at least 1 AHA agent, and nearly 60% were on 2 or more 
classes of AHA agents; 74% of subjects were treated with insulin alone or in combination with 
another AHA. 
The LS mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26 for canagliflozin 300 mg relative to 
placebo was –0.40% (p<0.001), and -0.30% for canagliflozin 100 mg relative to placebo 
(p=0.012). Thus the change in HbA1c from baseline was statistically significant but the clinical 
relevance of the effect is debatable. 
The 300 mg dose of canagliflozin did not achieve statistical significance with respect to the 
secondary endpoint related to FPG (p=0.070), although numerical improvement was observed 
with canagliflozin relative to placebo. Treatment with both doses of canagliflozin provided 
meaningful, albeit moderate, increases in the proportion of subjects achieving an HbA1c <7.0% 
at Week 26 relative to placebo (10 % and 15 % for the 100mg and 300 mg dose respectively, 
placebo adjusted). In addition to improvements in glucose control, weight loss and decreases in 
SBP were seen with canagliflozin 300 mg and 100 mg. Small increases in HDL-C were seen in 
both canagliflozin groups, but there were no notable changes from baseline in TG with 
canagliflozin relative to placebo in this population with moderate renal improvement.  
The lower efficacy of canagliflozin in this population is also reflected in a lower proportion 
achieving target as well as by the failure of achieving statistically significant outcomes with 
regards to the secondary endpoints. The need for rescue medication was lower in the 
canagliflozin groups compared to placebo. 
Older Adults – Placebo-controlled Study – DIA3010 
DIA3010 was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in older subjects not 
adequately controlled on current glucose lowering therapy (HbA1c of ≥7.0 to ≤10.0%), and to

assess body composition and bone safety using DXA in a subset of subjects. The mITT analysis 
set was comprised of 714 subjects (median age of 63 years), while a total of 211 subjects 
participated in the body composition substudy. This study included patients above the age of 55, 
with almost 40 % of patients being older than 65 years. The mean age was similar to that of the 
two CANVAS substudies and lower than observed in study DIA3004 (renal impairment). The 
study addition to the knowledge of the use of canagliflozin in elderly patients is therefore limited, 
especially the age group > 75 years of age.  
A high proportion of subjects (89%) completed 26 weeks of double-blind treatment, and the 
proportion of subjects who were discontinued prior to Week 26 was higher in the placebo group 
versus the pooled canagliflozin group (17% vs. 9%). Discontinuations rates were lower in the 
canagliflozin groups, indicating that canagliflozin was well tolerated.  
Almost all subjects (98%) were taking at least 1 AHA agent (49% on a SU and 33% on insulin), 
and 76% of subjects were on 2 or more classes of AHA agents. 
The change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 26 for canagliflozin 300 mg relative to placebo was 
-0.70% (p<0.001), and -0.57% for canagliflozin 100 mg relative to placebo (p<0.001). Both 
doses of canagliflozin achieved statistical significance with respect to the major secondary 
endpoints related to FPG, proportion with HbA1c <7.0% (20 % and 30 % for the 100 mg and 
300 mg dose respectively, placebo adjusted), body weight, SBP, HDL-C, and body FM. Statistical 
significance was not achieved for percent change from baseline in fasting TG for either dose of 
canagliflozin. The change in HbA1c from baseline was in the same range as observed in the 
overall population. The need for rescue medication was lower in the canagliflozin groups 
compared to placebo. 
Supportive study 
An independent clinical development programme was conducted by Misubishi Tanabe Pharma 
Cooperation (MTPC) in Japan. One dose-finding study from this development program is 
submitted with this application (Study TA-7284-04). This was a placebo-controlled study in 
adults with T2DM investigating a dose range of 50 to 300 mg CANA as monotherapy. The LS 
mean differences, compared to the placebo group, in the change from baseline to Week 12 in 
HbA1c were -0.72%, -0.90%, -0.90%, and -0.99%  the CANA 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 
mg groups, respectively. No phase III study from this programme has been submitted. 
The study results showed a dose response relationship, and as such supported the findings of 
study DIA2001. However, since it was stated that “methodologies used for collecting and 
analyzing key efficacy and safety endpoints in this study were different from those for the JRD-
sponsored studies”, this study is considered supportive only. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is supported by a comprehensive study program consisting of 9 phase III studies. 
The study program is in line with the adopted EMA Guideline “Note for Guidance on the Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products for the treatment of diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 76/115 
 
  
  
 
 
Rev.1)” and is generally in line with the CHMP Scientific Advice given. The phase III program for 
CANA evaluated CANA efficacy in a broad population of 10,285 T2DM subjects, including subjects 
who had: (1) inadequate glycaemic control while on diet and exercise (DIA3005[monotherapy]), 
(2) inadequate glycaemic control on a single oral AHA or dual oral AHA therapy (DIA3006 
[metformin], DIA3009 [metformin], DIA3008 [SU Substudy]), or a dual combination of AHAs 
(DIA3002 [metformin/SU], DIA3015 [metformin/SU], and DIA3012 [metformin/pioglitazone]), 
and (3) inadequate glycaemic control on treatment with insulin, alone or in combination with oral 
AHA therapy (in particular, in combination with metformin) (DIA3008 Insulin substudy). Other 
phase III studies examined add-on use of CANA in subjects with inadequate glycaemic control 
while remaining on their specific AHA background therapy (whether diet and exercise, or oral, or 
parenteral AHAs, alone or in combinations), including study DIA3004 in subjects with moderate 
renal impairment (with a GFR ≥30 to <50 mL/min/1.73m2) and DIA3010 in older adults (age 
>55 and <80 years). The DIA3008 substudies examined add-on use of CANA in subjects on 
insulin or on SU monotherapy in subjects with a history of or a high risk for CV disease. 
The placebo controlled phase III studies DIA3002, DIA3004, DIA3005, DIA3006, DIA3010 and 
DIA3012 had a core double blind period for the primary endpoint of 26 weeks. For the DIA3008 
Insulin and SU substudies, the primary efficacy evaluation was at 18 weeks. In the two active 
comparator non-inferiority studies (DIA3009 glimepiride, DIA3015 sitagliptin) the primary 
efficacy endpoint was at 52 weeks. Each of the phase III studies except DIA3015, the DIA3005 
high glycaemic substudy, and the DIA3008 substudies, had long-term extension treatment 
periods of up to 78 additional weeks. With this submission data were provided for the core 
double blind periods. 
HbA1c was chosen as the primary endpoint in all phase II/III studies, which is in line with “Note 
for Guidance on the Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products for the treatment of diabetes 
mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00)”. The range of doses for the phase III program (100 mg and 300 
mg CANA) was chosen based on the data from the phase I studies and the phase IIb study and is 
justified. 
The primary and secondary endpoints chosen for the phase III program were appropriate. 
Further to the evaluation of CANA on glycaemic endpoints, the effect of CANA on body weight, 
blood pressure and lipid parameters were investigated. Pharmacodynamic endpoints assessed in 
selected phase III studies to characterise the mechanism of action included RTG and beta-cell 
function/ insulin secretion PD endpoints. 
The patients included in the studies were representative for the target population. Patients with 
long-standing disease and diabetic complications such as (mild to moderate) renal impairment or 
CV disease were adequately represented in the study population. Inadequate glycaemic control 
was defined in most of the studies as an HbA1c level of ≥7.0 and ≤10.5%, which is appropriate. 
Of the 4994 subjects exposed to CANA across the phase III studies, 1390 were at least 65 years 
of age, including 1149 who were 65 to<75 years of age, 234 who were 75 to <85 years, and 7 
subjects who were ≥85 years. Hence, more than 100 geriatric patients were included in the 
phase III program and, as such, the requirement as outlined in EMA/ CHMP/ ICH/604661/2009 
(ICH topic E7 Studies in Support of special populations: Geriatrics Q and A) is met. 
All phase 3 studies were multicenter studies with European sites included and the majority of 
patients were white.  
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 77/115 
 
  
  
With this MAA no studies including patients below the age of 18 were submitted. Studies to be 
conducted in this population targeting at the indication treatment of T2DM in pediatric patients 
above 10 years of age were granted deferral. 
Although drug naïve (in addition to pretreated) subjects were included in the monotherapy study 
DIA3005 to support the restricted first line indication applied for, this is acceptable since the 
effect of CANA is not expected to be different in patients intolerant compared to those tolerant to 
metformin. The most frequent contraindication to metformin is relevant renal insufficiency 
(usually defined as creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Since patients may remain on 
treatment with CANA down to an eGFR of 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 (see section on benefit/risk), the 
inclusion of “contraindications to metformin” in the indication appears justified.   
Patients in the add-on studies were on adequate background therapy. Treatment failure was an 
inclusion criterion and adequately defined. The non-inferiority, active comparator studies were 
adequately designed, with almost all patients being treated with the target dose of both 
glimepiride and sitagliptin. The non-inferiority margin was selected with reference to values 
suggested by FDA guidance and to CHMP SA (EMEA/H/SA/1252/2008/III). 
The statistical methods used in the superiority and non-inferiority studies are well described and 
considered appropriate. ANCOVA with baseline covariate adjustment to analyse change from 
baseline for the primary and several secondary efficacy endpoints as used across the phase III 
studies is appropriate. Stratification factors were correctly implemented in the models. Primary 
analyses in all studies were supported by a number of sensitivity analyses. Control of family-wise 
type I error rate was adequately implemented in all phase III studies. Of note, test for 
superiority after establishing non-inferiority in the non-inferiority studies was not part of the 
hierarchical test sequence. A considerable impact of missing data on results is very unlikely and 
additional MMRM sensitivity analyses support this conclusion. 
Overall, 90% of subjects from the mITT analysis set for the pooled total CANA group completed 
the double-blind treatment period through the primary efficacy assessment, and this percentage 
was higher than that of the pooled placebo group (87%). The low number of discontinuations is 
reassuring. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the phase III studies, efficacy of CANA appeared generally dose-dependent. Results 
demonstrated the efficacy of CANA in reducing HbA1c on a range of different background AHA 
therapies. A clinically meaningful improvement in glycaemic control was seen when CANA was 
given as monotherapy and when given in dual combinations (add-on to metformin or to SUs), in 
triple oral AHA combinations (add-on to metformin plus a SU or metformin plus pioglitazone), in 
combinations with insulin (alone or in combination with other oral agents, especially metformin), 
or as an add-on to individual pre-existing diabetes therapy (any approved oral or parenteral 
therapy). 
Across the placebo-controlled phase III studies examining add-on combination uses, the efficacy 
of CANA in lowering HbA1c, relative to placebo, was generally consistent and ranged from -
0.70% to -0.92% with the 300 mg dose and from -0.57% to -0.74% with the 100 mg dose. 
Greater efficacy was observed when CANA was evaluated as monotherapy use, with HbA1c 
reductions of -1.16% and -0.91% (placebo-adjusted) for CANA 300 mg and 100 mg, 
respectively.  
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013

In a 52-week active comparator-controlled study, non-inferiority of CANA 300 mg and 100 mg to 
glimepiride (maximum dose, 6 to 8 mg/day) was demonstrated. Clinically relevant glycaemic 
improvements were observed with both CANA and glimepiride at week 52: the adjusted mean 
changes from baseline in HbA1c to Week 52 were -0.93% and -0.82% for the CANA 300 mg and 
100 mg groups, respectively, and -0.81% for the glimepiride group. A step-down to an 
assessment of superiority was pre-specified; the upper limit of 95% CI between CANA 300 mg 
and glimepiride was <0%, demonstrating superiority for CANA 300mg to glimepiride. The HbA1c-
lowering response to CANA 100 mg was not superior to that of glimepiride in this study. 
CANA 300 mg was also shown to have non-inferior efficacy compared to sitagliptin 100 mg. 
Clinically relevant glycaemic improvements were observed with both agents: the change from 
baseline in HbA1c to week 52 was -1.03% for the CANA 300 mg group and -0.66% for the 
sitagliptin group. A step-down to an assessment of superiority was pre-specified; the upper limit 
of 95% CI between CANA 300 mg and sitagliptin was <0%, demonstrating superiority of CANA 
300 mg to sitagliptin 100 mg. The 100 mg dose was not tested in this study. 
The favourable results on HbA1c were generally supported by the results on secondary glycaemic 
endpoints (FPG, postprandial glucose excursion for the two phase III studies that included a 
MMTT) and discontinuation rates due to rescue therapy. 
Considering the mechanism of action of CANA and the CANA-induced UGE being proportional to 
renal function, unsurprisingly, the efficacy of CANA was dependent upon baseline GFR. Therefore, 
the efficacy in renally impaired patients was of particular interest. Patients with mild renal 
impairment were generally included in the phase III program and, compared to patients with 
normal renal function, showed a slightly reduced but clearly clinically relevant effect with CANA. 
Patients with moderate renal impairment were investigated within a separate study (DIA 3004). 
This study demonstrated HbA1c reductions of borderline to insufficient clinical relevance in 
patients with GFR values of ≥30 to <50 mL/min/1.73m2: the change from baseline in HbA1c at 
week 26 relative to placebo was -0.4% and -0.3% for CANA 300 mg and 100 mg, respectively. 
The Applicant also performed an analysis in the pooled patient population with moderate renal 
impairment (N=1085) from all placebo-controlled studies. In the pooled analysis in moderately 
impaired renal patients overall HbA1c reductions compared to placebo were- 0.47% and -0.38% 
for CANA 300 mg and 100 mg, respectively. The small differences in results on HbA1c reduction 
between study DIA3004 and the pooled datasets may be explained by differences in baseline 
GFR, which were 39.4 mL/min/1.73m2 on average in study DIA3004 and 50.6 mL/min/1.73m2 in 
the pooled population of placebo controlled studies (since in most of the phase III studies a GFR 
<55 mL/min/1.73m2 was an exclusion criterion). 
The Applicant provided further subgroup analyses in patients with moderate renal impairment 
using eGFR cut-offs of 45 and 50 mL/min/1.73m2. In the subgroup of patients with GFR >45 to 
<60 mL/min/1.73m2, borderline clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c of -0.52% and – 0.47% 
with the 300 mg and 100 mg dose, respectively, were observed, while in the subgroup with eGFR 
<45 mL/min/1.73m2 insufficient HbA1c reductions of only -0.39% and -0.23%, respectively, 
were observed. The higher dose appears slightly more effective, however, is also associated with 
an increased rate of adverse events (e.g. related to water and electrolyte imbalance), especially 
in patients with an eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73m2 (see safety part). Therefore, the benefit/ risk 
profile of CANA is considered negative for patients with an eGFR ≤45ml/min/1.73m2.

As outlined above elderly patients were adequately represented in the phase III program. Of 
note, in study DIA3010, aiming at investigating the efficacy and safety of CANA in the elderly, 
the age distribution does not differ markedly from that in the other phase III studies with the 
majority of patients being below 65 years of age (55-65 years), less than 3% of patients were 
between 65 and 75 years of age, below 1% between 75 and 85 years and no patient was above 
85 years. In this study HbA1c response was more pronounced in subjects below 65 years of age 
compared to subjects above 65 years (which could be explained by a higher baseline GFR in the 
younger group). However, the glucose-lowering effect was clinically relevant in the elderly group. 
This was confirmed by the results of the pooled placebo-controlled population for subgroup 
analyses: across the subgroups, defined by a cut-off of either 65 and 75 years clinically relevant 
reductions in HbA1c could be observed for both doses of CANA (in the oldest subgroup, 
comprising 175 subjects, adjusted mean changes of -0.65% for CANA 100 mg and -0.55% for 
CANA 300 mg). Hence, efficacy seems to be maintained in the elderly. It is also known from 
another SGLT2-inhibitor that age per se does not influence efficacy.  
Overall, the effect of CANA appeared to be maintained over time. Although in some of the 
placebo-controlled phase III studies, the initial effect on HbA1c lowering appeared to slightly 
wane through the primary assessment timepoint, in other studies the effect was maintained or 
even appeared not to have been fully achieved at the time of the primary evaluation. 
Furthermore, examination of the slope of the HbA1c curve over time in the two non-inferiority 
studies from Week 26 to Week 52, referred to as the coefficient of durability, showed a markedly 
slower rate of rise for CANA relative to either SU or sitagliptin. Durability of effect seems not to 
be of concern based on the available data. Results of the extension periods of placebo controlled 
studies may further help to evaluate the sustainability of the glucose-lowering effect of CANA. 
Results of subgroup analyses performed in the pooled population of the placebo-controlled phase 
III studies found no important differences when comparing the effect of CANA in lowering HbA1c 
based on age, sex, race, and ethnicity, baseline BMI, or geographic region. As expected, greater 
reductions (significant interaction at an α=0.10 level) in HbA1c relative to placebo were observed 
with CANA among subjects with higher baseline HbA1c and higher GFR values compared to 
subjects with lower baseline values. A baseline HbA1c-dependent glucose-lowering effect is also 
known from other anti-hyperglycaemic agents.  
Treatment with CANA resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in total body weight relative to 
placebo. The effect was generally consistent across placebo-controlled phase III studies. In the 
pooled dataset of placebo controlled studies the mean percent change from baseline in body 
weight at the primary assessment timepoint, relative to placebo, was -2.7% (95% CI: [-2.9;-
2.4]) for the 300 mg dose and -2.0% (95% CI: [-2.3;-1.8]) for the 100 mg dose. 
Correspondingly, placebo-subtracted LS mean absolute reductions in body weight for the 300 mg 
and 100 mg groups for the pooled population of placebo-controlled studies were -2.43 kg (95% 
CI: [-2.652;-2.199]) and -1.84 kg (95% CI: [-2.064;-1.611]), respectively. Statistically 
significant reductions from baseline in percent change in body weight, relative to glimepiride 
(DIA3009, mean differences 5.2 to 5.7 kg), for both doses of CANA, and sitagliptin (DIA3015), 
for the CANA 300 mg dose, were observed (p<0.001 for all comparisons). Results of specialized 
body composition investigations using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 2 of the phase 
III studies (DIA3009, DIA3010) indicated that the body weight reduction with CANA was 
attributable to a greater decrease in body fat mass relative to lean body mass (with 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 80/115 
 
  
  
approximately 2/3 as fat mass loss). Hence, it was demonstrated that weight loss was 
predominantly due to loss of calories rather than dehydration. The effect on body weight and 
composition is likely to favourably influence CV risk in the frequently obese patients with T2DM.  
Across all phase III studies, clinically relevant lowering of SBP and DBP was observed, which is a 
desirable additional effect of CANA in the frequently hypertensive patients with T2DM. Since a 
BP-lowering effect is not usually expected for a glucose-lowering drug, appropriate labelling is 
warranted to create awareness among physicians and patients and to minimize risks in 
vulnerable patients (see safety section). 
Overall, by improving glycaemic control, reducing weight/fat mass and BP CANA treatment may 
favourably influence CV risk in patients with T2DM. However, longer term data (extension 
periods of ongoing studies, CANVAS study) will further help to elucidate the impact of CANA on 
CV risk (also see safety section). 
For all placebo controlled phase III studies, results of the core double blind period and 
subsequent extension periods were submitted. These data showed good durability of the 
antihyperglycaemic effect up to 52 weeks. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical program supports the efficacy of CANA as monotherapy in patients intolerant to 
metformin, and when given in dual combinations (add-on to metformin or to SUs), in triple 
oral AHA combinations (add-on to metformin plus a SU or metformin plus pioglitazone), in 
combinations with insulin (alone or in combination with other oral agents, especially 
metformin), or as an add-on to existing diabetes therapy (any approved oral or parenteral 
therapy). The effect size with the selected doses of 100 mg and 300 mg is considered clinically 
relevant and was consistent in all studies. In addition to the glycaemic improvement, weight 
reduction and a clinically relevant reduction in blood pressure was observed across the study 
program. These results support the benefit of CANA. 
Both a restricted monotherapy indication and the add-on indications were considered 
approvable from an efficacy point of view. The efficacy of CANA in patients with eGFR 45-60 
mL/min/1.73m2 is clearly reduced compared to patients with normal renal function but still 
clinically relevant. However, efficacy is clearly insufficient in patients with eGFR < 45 
mL/min/1.73m2. Due to the very small effect size and safety concerns (see safety section), 
the benefit-ratio ratio of CANA in patients with a GFR <45 mL/min/1.73m2, is considered 
negative. Therefore the recommendation to discontinue the treatment when eGFR is 
persistently below 45 mL/min/1.73m2 has been added to the product information. 
In the clinical program, both the 100 mg and 300 mg dose were shown to be efficient. The 
Applicant proposes that the higher dose should be used in patients who need tighter glycaemic 
control. The lower dose is proposed as the general starting dose with the option of up-titration 
when a higher dose is needed and tolerated; as a precautionary measure, 300 mg should not 
be used in patients with eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.  
Durability of antihyperglycaemic effect has been demonstrated following submission of the 
results of the extension periods for studies DIA 3002, 3004, 3005 and 3006.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
The general safety assessment is mainly based on the phase III trials. In all phase III trials two 
different doses of CANA were tested, 100 mg and 300 mg per day. Dose selection should be 
based on glycaemic control. The 300 mg dose can be used by all patients if tolerated and 
needed, no special restrictions are made; it is recommended to use 100 mg per day as starting 
dose. Hence, the observations made with the 300 mg dose will be most relevant for safety 
assessment; the 100 mg dose can reveal dose-dependency of an effect. Special safety aspects 
were investigated mechanistically in smaller trails. The phase III studies were performed in 
patients with different background therapies, were either placebo-controlled or using an active 
comparator (glimepride or sitagliptin). A large trial was performed in patients with increased CV 
risk (DIA3008). Smaller phase III (sub-)trials investigated the effects of CANA in patients with 
moderate renal impairment (DIA3004, eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73m2 at baseline) and 
in patients with poor glycaemic control (part of DIA3005). The larger phase II trials were for 
dose finding (DIA2001) and for investigating CANA in patients with obesity (no diabetics, 
OBE2001); in these studies also parameters relevant for bone safety were measured. 
For all of the phase III studies, safety evaluations included the collection of adverse events, 
safety laboratory tests (including hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), 12-lead 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate), body weight, physical 
examinations, self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG), and collection of potential hypoglycaemic 
episodes (e.g., from the subject diary provided to subjects). In study DIA3010, bone mineral 
density was assessed at the lumbar spine, hip, and forearm using dual-energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) technology. Serum collagen type 1 carboxy-telopeptide (CTx) and 
propeptide amino terminal of type I procollagen (P1NP) were measured in this study. 
Quantitative computed tomography (CT) of the spine and hip were used to assess trabecular and 
cortical bone density changes, geometric properties and material properties (using finite element 
analysis [FEA]) in a subset of subjects (approximately 50 per treatment group). 
Several safety monitoring committees were commissioned for the phase III program: 
•  An independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC) reviewed blinded data for selected 
adverse events, including major adverse cardiovascular events plus events of unstable 
angina (MACE-plus), hospitalized congestive heart failure, venous 
thromboembolism/pulmonary embolism, and all deaths. 
• 
Independent assessment committees reviewed blinded data for assessment of fracture 
(Fracture Adjudication Committee [FAC]), hepatic (Hepatic Events Assessment Committee 
[HEAC]), and renal events (Clinical Events Committee [CEC]). 
•  An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) reviewed unblinded serious adverse 
events and CV events. 
In total, four different safety data sets (DS1 - DS4) were created by compiling different patient 
populations, see table below. Phase II trials were not included in these data pools because the 
largest phase II trials were dose finding studies so that most patients received different CANA 
doses than in the phase III trials.

24-month exposure if his/her duration of treatment is greater or equal to 24 weeks, 50 weeks, 
76 weeks, and 102 weeks. 
Thus, up to 18 month the number of exposed patients is considered high enough to allow 
meaningful conclusions. 
Adverse events 
In DS4, the following (Table 41 below) incidences of AEs were observed in the different 
treatment group. In DS1 (placebo-controled pool) the absolute numbers of AE incidence were 
lower in all groups (obviously due to different baseline characteristics), but the overall picture 
was the same.

The overall rate of AEs is fairly balanced between the treatment groups. This is also true for 
serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation. Merely the number of AEs related to study drug 
(according to investigator) was dose-dependently increased in the CANA groups. But 
reassuringly, related serious AEs were again fairly balanced. 
The AEs considered related were often genital or urinary tract infections, a known side effect of 
SGLT2 inhibitors (see also section on discontinuation due to AEs below). 
Although the overall incidence in AEs was balanced between the treatment groups, some 
individual AEs or AEs in certain organ systems had markedly different incidences in DS4, see 
table below. Most salient and important findings are marked with incidences in bold.

Most of the imbalances displayed in the table above reflect the known physiological actions of 
CANA as an SGLT2 inhibitor or known side effects resulting from them. These comprise e.g. 
thirst, polyuria, hypotension (due to increased diuresis), weight decrease and all signs of 
urogenital infection. Also increased serum creatinine can be most likely explained by elevated 
diuresis (for detailed discussion, see section on changes on renal function below). Reduced 
incidence of increased blood pressure and hyperglvcaemia in the CANA groups can also be 
explained by SGLT2 inhibition. 
There is a small increase in AEs related to skin and subcutaneous tissue, most pronounced for 
erythema and skin ulcer. The reason for this finding (if true and not due to chance) is not 
obvious. Phototoxicity of CANA was observed in non-clinical studies but clear phototoxicity was 
not observed in dedicated studies of the Applicant (see below). 
All other imbalances are not considered meaningful, either because of being too small or because 
the absolute number of patients affected is very low. 
AEs of special interest: 
Hypoglycaemia was defined as an AE of special interest by the Applicant. In this analysis, only 
documented hypoglycaemias were included: Either by measured fingerstick glucose of ≤70 
mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or a severe episode requiring assistance or leading to consciousness. The 
observed incidences in patients without hypoglycaemic background therapy are displayed in the 
table below.

There is a small and dose-dependent increase in hypoglycaemic events in the CANA groups as 
compared to placebo. Reassuringly, severe hypoglycaemias were rare. 
In the presence of hypooglycaemic background therapy (i.e. insulin or SU) the incidence was 
increased by CANA. The table below provides the actual figures.

SU and insulin are known to have a rather high hypoglycaemic propensity themselves. CANA 
further increases the hypoglycaemia incidence of a hypoglycaemic background therapy which 
includes insulin or an insulin secretagogue. However, hypoglycaemic events were not 
meaningfully different for CANA + metformin +SU compared to sitagliptin + metformin + SU. 
Furthermore, no relevant imbalances (CANA vs. plac) were observed with severe 
hypoglycaemias. 
The incidence of urinary tract infections (UTI) hardly differed between CANA and placebo. 
Merely in the low-dose CANA group the incidence is somewhat higher for unknown reasons, see 
table below. Serious events were rare.

This picture is in line with other SGLT2 inhibitors. SGLT2 inhibitor intake more often leads to 
genital infection. The incidence of female genital infection is shown in the table below:

There was a clearly and highly increased incidence of female genital infection in both CANA 
groups, slightly dose-dependent, as compared to placebo. Most of these events were considered 
related to study drug by the investigator, most likely because this is an expected side effect of 
SGLT2 inhibition. Part of these events also led to discontinuation of study drug. Reassuringly, no 
serious AEs related to genital infection were observed. Many of the infections were caused by 
fungi. This may explain the different incidence pattern as compared to UTIs. The picture in males 
was similar although the absolute numbers of incidence were lower since genital infections in 
men are generally less frequent than in women. 
Regarding markers of renal function, there was a consistent decrease in eGFR associated with 
CANA use, caused by an increase in serum creatinine. This may either reflect decreased renal 
function and renal damage or may simply be a consequence of the haemoconcentration that is 
known to occur with SGT2 inhibitors. To exclude renal damage the Applicant collected post-
treatment data of eGFR from 371 patients who discontinued treatment, shown in the figure 
below.

Mean Percent Change (+/-SE) in eGFR For Subjects Who Discontinued and Have a Post 
Treatment Value (>5 to <60 Days After the Last Study Medication) – Regardless of Use 
of Rescue Medication (ISS Phase III Broad Dataset: Safety Analysis Set) 
Data from more than 100 patients per group of the broad dataset (including high CV risk 
patients) clearly show that eGFR returns to baseline values after cessation of CANA therapy. This 
observation largely excludes renal damage by CANA and strongly argues for dehydration as the 
cause for the observed decrease in eGFR during CANA therapy, at least in this data set (DS3). No 
information is available how many patients with renal impairment were included in this analysis. 
This special population is discussed in the respective section below. 
SGLT2 inhibition causes water and sodium loss because of glucose-induced osmotic diuresis and 
because SGLT2 is also a sodium carrier. Thus, signs of volume depletion and AEs related to 
volume depletion may be expected with CANA therapy. The following table lists the incidence of 
AEs related to dehydration in general as well as the most frequent individual events. Results 
from DS3 are shown; the picture was similar in DS1 (placebo-controlled studies).

CANA clearly increased the incidence in dehydration-related events in a dose-dependent manner 
to more than twofold the comparator level for the high dose group, most pronounced for 
hypotension. Nevertheless, the absolute number of events was still low and serious AEs were not 
increased with CANA. The influence of concomitant therapy with diuretics and antihypertensive 
drugs is presented in the section on interactions below. 
The first AEs related to volume depletion occurred early after start of treatment, mostly in the 
first 8 to 12 weeks (see Kaplan-Meier plot below). Thereafter, the tolerabilty of CANA in respect 
to volume depletion related AEs did remain essentially constant as identified by the nearly 
parallel curves of the CANA and placebo groups from week 12 onward.

A serious complication of dehydration and haemoconcentration is venous thrombosis. 
Therefore the Applicant summarised all relevant AEs that are related to venous thrombosis. The 
percentage of VTE was very low (0.2 to 0.3%) so that even the large dataset does not allow firm 
conclusions. It cannot be fully excluded that 300 mg CANA increase the risk of total VTE and 
serious VTE but the very low absolute number of events indicates that VTE is no major problem 
of CANA therapy. 
A meta-analysis for cardiovascular (CV) events of phase II and III canagliflozin studies in 
subjects with T2DM was performed in accordance with FDA Guidance Diabetes Mellitus - 
Evaluating Cardiovascular Risk in New Antidiabetic Therapies to Treat Type 2 Diabetes. 
Prospectively adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, including CV death, 
nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], and nonfatal stroke) and events of hospitalized unstable 
angina (collectively referred to as MACE-plus) are included in the meta-analysis. An independent 
Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC), composed of external specialists classified the outcome 
events while blinded to treatment assignment. The meta-analysis was based upon a pooled 
population of subjects with T2DM receiving at least one dose of CANA (mITT set) 100 or 300 mg 
in the well-controlled, randomized studies of at least 12 weeks in duration. Study DIA3015 is not 
included because of the later database lock.

In the meta-analysis performed, the CV events are fairly balanced between the treatment groups 
in both evaluations. The event rate for MACE was nearly identical between the All CANA and the 
comparator group and the upper limit of the 95% CI of the HR is rather low (1.37), reasonably 
excluding a relevant increase in cardiovascular risk of CANA. 
The Applicant provided a graphical overview (Forrest plot below) of the contribution of important 
subpopulations to the mean HR of MACE-plus (the latter is shown as the red dotted line).

The Applicant also summarised the incidence of AEs related to congestive heart failure. In the 
Non-CANA group of the broad, long-term DS4, 0.31% of patients presented with this diagnosis. 
There was a lower incidence in the two CANA groups, 0.13% and 0.16% for 100 and 300 mg 
CANA, respectively. 
Rather pronounced differences become obvious from the figure (Forrest plot) above between 
participants of the CV outcome study CANVAS (DIA3008) and participants of the other phase III 
trials. The confidence intervals are largely overlapping so that it is not clear whether these 
differences are true. Nevertheless, these currently limited data suggest that patients with lower 
CV risk (majority of patients included in the non-CANVAS studies) may potentially derive a CV 
benefit from treatment with CANA whereas this may not be the case for patients with known CV 
disease or a clearly increased risk thereof (CANVAS population). Importantly, the HR data do not 
indicate a detrimental effect of CANA in either population.

In order to obtain a broader database, a subpopulation of “high CV risk patients” was defined 
within the broad data set DS3, consiting of patients who meet the inclusion criteria for the CV 
outcome trial CANVAS (DIA3008). The results are tabulated below, for MACE and MACEPlus:

Kaplan-Meier Plot of Time to First Low Trauma Fracture Adverse Event (ISS Phase III 
Longer term Exposure Broad Dataset: Safety Analysis Set)  
The Kaplan-Meier plot indicates a questionable increase in low-trauma fractures with CANA (both 
doses). The difference became obvious very early in treatment (after around 6 weeks). Thus, it 
remains unclear whether this effect could be caused by CANA. Usually bone changes (e.g. 
noticeable decrease in bone density) need more time to develop. On the other hand, the increase 
in fractures (if true) may be due to increased falls related to CANA-induced dizziness or 
hypotension. A causal relationship cannot be excluded because most fractures that occured 
briefly after onset of CANA therapy were located in the upper extremity and were related to falls. 
At least in one case a temporal relationship between low blood pressure and fall could be 
established. 
Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by DXA up to 52 weeks in study DIA3010.The results

Hence, there is no hint for CANA-induced bone loss. 
Nonclinical studies and phase I/II trials demonstrated that CANA has phototoxic potential, 
although only at high light intensity which is considered clinically irrelevant. In phase III studies 
the incidence of all AEs potentially related to photosensitivity was numerically increased in the 
CANA groups than in the non-CANA group, see table below, but the absolute number of events 
was low so that no firm conclusions can be drawn.

Overall, phototoxicity is rare, even in the presence of CANA. This is in agreement with the 
findings of the phase I and phase II studies. There was a marked increase in the incidence of 
skin ulcer in the broad dataset DS3/DS4. However, these ulcers were located on leg and foot, 
and the imbalance in their incidence was most likely due to the observed imbalance in the 
baseline rate of microvascular disorders.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There was no increase in overall death rate or deaths considered related to study drug in the 
CANA groups as compared to control: 1 death in the placebo and one death (cardiac death) in 
the CANA 300 mg group were considered possibly related to study drug by the investigator in 
DS4.  
Serious AEs (SAEs) were overall balanced between the CANA and non-CANA groups. 
Furthermore, no individual SAE or organ system was markedly imbalanced between the groups. 
An exception could be the term “Reproductive System and Breast Disorders” with an SAE 
incidence of 0.1% in the non-CANA and 0.4% in the high-dose CANA group. However, no 
predominant entity of SAEs in this organ system could be identified and the absolute number of 
events is low. No such imbalance was observed in the other datasets (DS1 and DS2). Hence, this 
finding is most likely due to chance. 
In the non-clinical 2-year rat carcinogenesis study (see Non-Clinical AR for details) three types of 
neoplasms became obvious which were apparently related to CANA administration. These were 
phaeochromocytomas, Leydig cell tumours of the testis and renal tumours. Far the most of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 95/115 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
phaeochromocytomas and all Leydig cell tumours were benign. The kidney tumours were benign 
or malignant but were highly differentiated and displayed a histopathological picture that 
markedly differed from known spontaneous kidney tumours in rats (and also humans). In the 
mouse carcinogenicity study no CANA-related neoplasms became obvious. 
The Applicant conducted mechanistic studies in the rat strain which had revealed the tumours 
and concluded that SGLT1 inhibition by CANA at high doses in the small intestine with 
consecutive glucose malabsorption plays a crucial role. According to this hypothesis the reduced 
pH in the gut lumen leads to the absorption of higher than usual amounts of calcium from food. 
To keep the calcium serum level within the normal range the kidney has to excrete this 
excessively resorbed calcium. The need to excrete high amounts of calcium (nearly 10-fold the 
normal amount) could be responsible for the observed kidney changes (hyperplasia, 
inflammation, tumours). The inflammation may be caused by the observed mineralisation 
(probably calcium phosphate crystals) in the renal cortex. This mechanism appears plausible. It 
also appears irrelevant for humans since there are no hints for major carbohydrate 
malabsorption in humans as determined in the clinical trials DIA1007 and DIA1022. It should be 
noted that the oral bioavailability of CANA is markedly lower in rats than in humans (around 35% 
in rats compared to 65% in humans). Therefore, with a given CANA dose a markedly higher 
fraction remains in the gut in rats and is able to block SGLT1 transporters locally. Kidney changes 
were markedly reduced when the rats received a glucose-free diet which sharply reduced renal 
calcium excretion. Simultaneously, cell division and hypertrophy in the adrenal cortex were no 
longer observed with glucose-free diet, leading to the coclusion that the phaeochromocytomas 
were also caused by malabsorption (although the mechanism is not fully clear). 
Leydig cell tumours were explained by the Applicant by increased LH (luteinising hormone) levels 
caused by CANA in rats. The reason why CANA influenced LH (and testosterone) levels in rats is 
not clear, but no such changes were observed in humans as determined in the dedicated phase I 
trial DIA2001. 
In the most relevant long-term, broad data set 4, there was a slight imbalance in neoplasms 
(combined benign and malignant). 2.5%, 2.5% and 2.9% of the patients in the comparator, 
CANA 100 mg and CANA 300 mg group, respectively, had a finding of neoplasm. 
Phaeochromocytomas and Leydig cell tumours (as seen in the non-clinical carcinogenicity study) 
were not observed in the phase III programme. 
In the DS3 data set (shorter observation time), there was a slight imbalance in the overall 
neoplasm incidence, i.e., 2.17% (67/3085) neoplasms in the CANA 300 mg group vs. 1.68% 
(55/3262) in the non-CANA group (ratio 1.29). However, in the DS4 data set (longer observation 
time of the same patients), this imbalance was diminished, i.e., 2.92% (90/3085) neoplasms in 
the CANA 300 mg vs. 2.51% (82/3262) neoplasms in the CANA 300 vs. non-CANA group (ratio 
of 1.16). In the latest evaluation (cut-off date 31 Dec 2012) the ratio further dropped to 1.04 
(2.56% in the All CANA and 2.45% in the comparator group). The imbanlance in bladder tumours 
found with another SGLT-2 inhibitor was not observed for CANA. Thus, there is no hint from 
clinical data that the rat findings could be relevant for humans or that CANA is generally 
associated with an increased tumour risk. For further reassurance the Applicant also provided a 
Forrest Plot showing the hazard ratios (HRs) for individual tumour types: 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 96/115 
 
  
  
Hazard Ratio for AEs in the Primary SOC of Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and 
Unspecified (Pooled Dataset DS3, through a cut-off date of 31 December 2012) 
It can be derived from the figure that the HRs for the individual tumour types scatter around 
unity, with some types having HRs above (e.g. blood and skin tumours) and others revealing HRs 
below one (e.g. gastrointestinal and renal/urinary). There are no outliers and no tumour type has 
a HR which is different from 1 in a statistically significant way. Thus, this pattern fits the 
assumption of a random distribution with the mean (overall) HR of 1. 
Laboratory findings 
Decrease in blood pressure and slight and dose-dependent increases in haemoglobin (hb), 
haematocrit (hct)and serum electrolytes were observed with CANA and are apparently linked 
to its pharmacodynamic action (water and salt loss). The regularly observed hb and hct increase 
(Hb: mean increase -0.8, 6.9 and 7.6 g/L for placebo, CANA 100 and CANA 300 mg, 
respectively) did not lead to an increased incidence of hb or hct being above the upper limit of 
normal. Serum creatinine also increased with CANA treatment. The significance of this finding is 
discussed above in the section on renal function as AE of special interest.

No relevant changes in liver parameters were observed, and there was no hint that CANA induces 
liver injury. 
Apart from the PD-related laboratory findings outlined above CANA also induced small but 
consistent changes in serum lipids; most pronounced were increases in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) 
and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio remained essentially unchanged. A post-
hoc performed NMR-spectroscopy to assess LDL-C particle number showed that the increase in 
the total LDL-C particle number was driven primarily by a large increase in particle number of the 
large LDL-C subfraction with little or no change in the small LDL-C particle number, hence 
leading to an increase in the less atherogenic subfraction. The increase in serum lipoproteins 
could also be due to haemoconcentration. This would be in line with the finding that LDL-C and 
HDL-C increased to around the same amount.  
CANA also caused slight and dose-dependent mean changes in serum bicarbonate (decrease), 
serum magnesium (increase) and serum sodium (increase) which became obvious shortly after 
onset of treatment (within 6 weeks). The observed changes were small and the serum levels of 
these electrolytes usually remained within the normal range. They somewhat more frequently 
exceeded the normal range in patients with moderate renal impairment, especially with CANA 
300 mg (see section on special populations, renal impairment, below). 
Safety in special populations 
The following AE incidences, tabulated below, were observed in the patient population pool with 
moderate renal insufficiency (i.e. eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73m2).

Since clinically relevant efficacay was still observed in a subgroup of patiens with moderate renal 
impairment who had an eGFR of ≥45 mL/min/1.73m2 (see efficacy section), the Applicant 
provided a safety evaluation for this subgroup (patients with eGFR between 45 and 60 
mL/min/1.73m2). The incidence of AEs related to volume depletion and serum electrolyte 
imbalance was slightly increased as compared to patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73m2 but the 
incidence of severe or serious events did not increase and the type of events remained the same.

There is a numerical increase in fracture rate in renally impaired patients in the low-dose but not 
in the high-dose CANA group. The relevance of this observation is unclear. This could reflect 
random fluctuation due to the low number of events. Specific studies on bone turnover markers 
and calcium metabolism in renally impaired patients are not available. In study DIA3004 
(subjects with moderate renal impairment), relative to placebo, moderate percent reductions in 
PTH (-10.3% and -16.1%) were seen with canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg, respectively, which 
do not indicate an increased renal loss of calcium with CANA use. 
Renally impaired patients more often display alterations of eGFR (reduced), serum phosphate 
(increased), serum sodium (increased) and serum potassium (increased) in response to CANA 
than the overall study population, especially with 300 mg CANA. Hyperkalaemia may adversely 
affect cardiac function. 
Furthermore, the incidence of AEs related to dehydration and the incidence of vascular disorders 
(including hypotension) was markedly increased in this population. Taken together, this indicates 
that the effects of CANA on water and electrolyte balance are less well tolerated in patients with 
relevant renal impairment and that the renal safety of CANA in this patient population has not 
been clarified. 
In the older population (over 75 years) the incidence of AEs was rather high in all groups, 
probably because of background disease. Dehydration is in general more frequently observed in 
the older population, e.g. because of physiologically reduced thirst and often reduced water 
intake. In patients aged 75 or more, 2.6% in the Non-CANA vs. 4.9% in the 100 mg and 8.7% in 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 99/115 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
the 300 mg CANA group had AEs related to dehydration. Furthermore, the organism may have 
reduced ability to compensate for the changes in water and electrolyte balance induced by CANA. 
It is reassuring that serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were not increased with CANA 
as compared to control. It can be assumed that most diabetic patients over 75 years of age will 
have some degree of renal impairment. Thus, it is not known whether old age is a risk factor per 
se or if the imbalance is mainly due to the expected higher incidence of renal impairment. The 
Applicant is therefore asked to clarify how many of the older patients did have impaired renal 
function and whether this influenced the AE profile. 
Immunological events 
The adverse event of hypersensitivity was reported in 9 (0.3%) subjects in the canagliflozin 100 
mg (1 subject had 2 events), 6 (0.2%) subjects in the canagliflozin 300 mg and 1 (<0.1%) 
subject in the non-CANA groups. In 6 subjects in the combined canagliflozin group, reported 
terms suggested environmental allergies and in 9 subjects reported terms were non-specific 
hypersensitivity. The majority of the events were considered by the investigator as mild or 
moderate in severity and not related to the study drug. Two of 15 subjects in the combined 
canagliflozin group had events of hypersensitivity that led to discontinuation of study drug. In 
both subjects who discontinued, the events were considered by the investigator as related to 
study drug, and in 1 of the 2 subjects who discontinued the event was serious (Type I allergic 
reaction on Day 1, 1 hour after CANA intake). No other subjects had serious events of 
hypersensitivity or events that were considered related to study drug. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The most relevant interactions of CANA are expected with diuretics and blood pressure lowering 
agents. As shown in the table below, adverse events related to volume depletion were markedly 
increased with CANA 300 mg in patients with a background therapy of loop diuretics or 
antihypertensive drugs of the ACE/ARB class. The effect was less pronounced with other 
diuretics.

Other conditions that increased the risk for CANA to induce dehydration included low systolic 
blood pressure, diabetes duration, diabetes complications and, rather pronounced, age 75 or 
above. This indicates that poorer general health may decrease the tolerability of CANA.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There was some imbalance in the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation between CANA and 
control, most pronounced in the high-dose CANA group (3.7%, 4.2% and 5.6% for Non-CANA, 
CANA 100 mg and CANA 300 mg, respectively). This imbalance was largely due to various terms 
related to genital infection and polliakiuria, but no predominant single condition became obvious. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of CANA is largely consistent with the expected safety profile for an SGLT2 
inhibitor. This includes water and sodium loss which may lead to dehydration with all its sequels 
including hypotension and syncope in vulnerable patients. The mean arterial blood pressure 
decreased with CANA by around 7 mm Hg (systolic) and around 3 mm Hg (diastolic). The blood 
pressure lowering effect is a desirable effect in the frequently hypertensive, overweight patient 
with type 2 diabetes but such an effect is not usually expected for a glucose-lowering agent; 
therefore a warning has been included in the product information. Caution should be exercised in 
patients for whom a canagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could pose a risk, such as 
patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history 
of hypotension, elderly patients or patients with (intercurrent) conditions that may lead to 
volume depletion.  
Glucose in urine favours urogenital infections. As with other SGLT2 inhibitors, the most 
pronounced increase in AEs was observed for genital infections, mainly of mycotic origin. Severe, 
ascending urinary tract infections were rare and not apparently increased with the use of CANA. 
Urogenital infections are considered manageable if the patient and prescriber are aware of the 
risk. Therefore, these events are not regarded as a major safety concern. 
CANA was phototoxic in non-clinical tests. Dedicated phase I and phase II clinical trials revealed 
that acute or delayed photosensitivity reaction are unlikely at the light intensities of normal 
sunlight. However, the incidence of adverse events of skin and subcutaneous tissue was 
increased in CANA-treated patients, but this increase was due to probably diabetes-related skin 
ulcers located at the leg or foot and could be explained by a baseline imbalance in pre-existing 
microvascular disease.  
In the clinical Phase 3 program, an increased incidence of photosensitivity reactions occurred in 
the combined canagliflozin group (0.28%; 17/6177) and in comparison to the non-canagliflozin 
group (0.15%; 5 /3262). Of the events assessed as related to study medication by the 
investigator, photosensitivity reaction occurred in 10 (0.16%) subjects in the combined 
canagliflozin group and 2 (0.06%) subjects in the non-canagliflozin group. However, no event 
was serious or severe, and the number of events was low. Thus, photosensitivity is not 
considered as a clinically relevant concern. 
Bone fractures were slightly increased with CANA. The early occurrence, locations (upper 
extremity) and circumstances (most often falls) of the observed fractures suggest that CANA-
induced drop in blood pressure may have been the reason for the slightly increased fracture rate. 
In order to minimise the risk of hypotension and potential sequelae, a start of CANA therapy with 
the low dose (100 mg) is recommended in the product information. DXA measurements up to 52 
weeks of therapy reveal only very small and inconsistent changes in BMD with CANA compared 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 101/115 
 
  
  
 
to placebo. Serum markers of bone formation and turnover changed slightly with no clear net 
effect. Based on these data, there is currently no concern regarding bone safety of CANA. For 
further reassurance the 104-week BMD data should be submitted as soon as available.  
CANA caused hypoglycaemia (≤70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]) in rare cases, even in the absence of a 
hypoglycaemic background therapy, but the incidence of clinically more relevant hypoglycaemia 
(blood glucose below 56 mg/dL [3.1 mmol/L]) was not different from placebo. CANA markedly 
increased the incidence of documented hypoglycaemia if the background therapy included insulin 
or sulphonylureas. Thus, care should be taken when CANA is added to insulin or sulphonylureas 
and dose reduction of the latter medications may be considered, as recommended in the SmPC. 
Reassuringly, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was not increased with CANA, even in the 
presence of insulin or sulphonylurea background therapy.  
Analysing the safety data from patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR between 30 and 
60 mL/min/1.73m2) pooled from the whole phase III programme revealed some differences to 
the overall study population. In particular, hyperkalaemia and AEs related to dehydration and 
hypotension were more often induced by CANA in this special population, particularly with the 
higher dose and in patients with more severe renal insufficiency (i.e. eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 
m2). However, in the subgroup of patients with eGFR 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 (stage 3A 
chronic kidney disease, CKD) the incidence of adverse events was close to placebo level with 100 
mg CANA; 300 mg increased the incidence of volume depletion related AEs and serum electrolyte 
imbalances (mainly decreased bicarbonate and increased magnesium) in this group, but the 
events were not serious. Both types of AEs, volume depletion related and electrolyte imbalances, 
occurred early after onset of treatment so that treatment of patients with stage 3A CKD appears 
safe, at least in patients who are on stable treatment, initiated before the onset of moderate 
renal impairment. Since AE incidence was clearly lower with 100 mg than with 300 CANA mg and 
was nearly at comparator level in stage 3A CKD patients (patients with eGFR 45 to < 60 
mL/min/1.73m2), as a precautionary measure, the dose in this patient population should be 
limited to 100 mg/d. 
It should be noted that CANA, due to its induction of osmotic diuresis, could consecutively 
activate the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This could be a disadvantage because RAS 
activation may accelerate decrease of renal function. On the other hand, ACE inhibitors (or 
agiotensin receptor agonists) are recommended for renally impaired patients anyway to slow 
disease progression. Accordingly, strict blood pressure control is recommended in these patients 
and is achieved in practice often by use of thiazide diuretics. It is expected that the latter 
activate RAS to at least the same extent as CANA does but no renal adverse effects were noted 
to date. Hence, it is unlikely that CANA accelerates the progression of renal insufficiency. The 
finding of attenuation of the initial CANA-induced eGFR decrease over time and the complete 
reversibility upon treatment discontinuation, also in patients with moderate renal insufficiency, as 
well as the decrease in urinary albumin/creatinine ratio in patients with microalbuminuria and 
macroalbuminuria during CANA treatment provide further reassurance regarding renal safety of 
CANA.  
Adverse events were more pronounced in patients over 75 years of age. It can be assumed that 
most diabetic patients over 75 years of age will have some degree of renal impairment. A 
dedicated analysis revealed that CANA-related AEs relevantly increased in patients ≥75 years if 
they had moderate renal impairment but not in patients of this age group with normal or only 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 102/115 
 
  
  
mildly impaired renal function. Therefore, old age per se should not be a criterion to discourage 
use of CANA. With the general starting dose of 100 mg/day most of the relevant AEs (e.g. due to 
the initial drop in blood pressure) can be avoided.   
A pronounced effect of loop diuretics, 8.8% vs. 2.9% (i.e. increase by around factor 3) on 
dehydration- related adverse events with 300 mg CANA is obvious. Therefore, use of CANA in 
patients on loop diuretics is not recommended. 
In a CV meta analysis across trials there was no increased risk of CANA vs. comparator (active or 
placebo) for the combined CV endpoint MACE or MACE-plus (the latter including MACE and 
hospitalisation for CV events). The hazard ratio (HR) for MACE was close to unity with an 
acceptable upper limit of the 95% CI (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.70, 1.37). Remarkably, there was a 
rather pronounced numerical difference in HR of MACE and MACE-plus between patients with 
high CV risk (CANVAS CV outcome study inclusion criteria) and patients not meeting the CANVAS 
inclusion criteria. Nevertheless, even in the patients with high CV risk, the HR with CANA did not 
exceed 1. Therefore, no increased CV risk due to CANA is expected. Taken together, the data 
suggest that patients with lower CV risk may potentially derive a CV benefit from treatment with 
CANA, whereas this may not to be the case for patients with established CV disease or a clearly 
increased risk thereof (CANVAS population). The data also suggest that patients on CANA are at 
lower risk to develop congestive heart failure compared to patients on comparator, which may be 
explained by the diuretic effect of CANA.  
There was a slight trend for a higher risk for strokes, HR was 1.47 (95% CI: 0.83, 2.59). The 
majority were non-fatal ischemic strokes and occurred in both CANA groups (100 mg and 300 
mg). It is not yet clear whether this finding is due to chance. Thus, strokes will be further 
followed post-marketing in the CV outcome study CANVAS and in the PSURs. 
Carcinogenicity studies in animals revealed neoplastic findings in rats but not in mice. Benign and 
malignant tumours of the renal cortex and the adrenal medulla (phaechromcytomas) were 
observed as well as benign Leydig cell tumours of the testes. For the renal tumours the Applicant 
provided the following explanation, which was considered reasonable. CANA is not well absorbed 
in the gut of rats and therefore causes a rather high local inhibition of SGLT1 in the intestine. In 
consequence, less glucose but more calcium (because of reduced luminal pH) becomes absorbed. 
These high amounts of calcium have to be excreted by the kidney which in turn leads to 
hyperplasia, inflammation and tumours. A glucose-free diet could prevent these changes. 
Although the mechanism for the induction of phaeochromocytomas is unknown, this diet also 
prevented hypertrophy of the adrenal medulla. Since no relevant carbohydrate malabsorption 
with CANA was observed in humans, the rat findings are considered not relevant for humans.  
For further assurance the Applicant provided an analysis of the broadest data set with a late data 
cut-off (31 Dec 2012) and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) also for each type of tumour (according 
to the location in an organ system). This analysis revealed a HR of 1.00 for all neoplasms and 
showed that the HRs of the individual tumour types are randomly distributed around one, without 
outlier. Thus, the expected pattern of a random distribution resulted, strongly indicating that 
CANA is not associated with tumours. 
There was an increase in serum LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C). The LDL-
C/HDL-C ratio remained essentially unchanged. Reassuringly, the LDL-C increase was mainly 
driven by the less atherogenic subfraction of large particles. So far, there is no evidence for an 
Assessment report

increased CV risk associated with CANA. The CV outcome study is still ongoing and will provide 
further long-term data particularly on patients with high CV risk. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
CANA demonstrated largely a safety profile as expected of an SGLT2 inhibitor. Due to enhanced 
renal glucose and sodium excretion, CANA may lead to dehydration and its sequelae, to low 
blood sugar levels (mainly in combination with insulin or insulin secretatogues) and urogenital 
infections (particularly genital mycoses). In general, these safety issues appear manageable.  
Based on its mechanism of action, CANA decreases blood pressure which could be favourable in 
many type 2 diabetics. Because these effects are unexpected for a diabetes drug, caution should 
be taken in potentially vulnerable patients.  
Thus, some conditions exist in which a starting dose of 100 mg should be used for safety reasons 
since drop in blood pressure and volume depletion or its sequelae could be more pronounced 
upon onset of treatment. Therefore a starting dose of 100 mg is recommended for all patients as 
a precautionary measure and to simplify posology. 
The frequencies of AEs, especially those related to dehydration, were increased in patients with 
moderate renal impairment, particularly with the higher dose and in patients with more severe 
renal impairment. Simultaneously, efficacy depends on renal function and is therefore markedly 
decreased in patients with relevantly reduced eGFR. Due to insufficient efficacy and more 
pronounced safety concerns, the B/R ratio of CANA is considered unfavourable in patients with an 
eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73m2. In patients with eGFR ≥45 and <60 ml/min/1.73m2 there is 
also an increased reporting of adverse events related to water and electrolyte imbalance 
compared to comparator, predominantly with CANA 300 mg. However, no relevant differences in 
AE incidence or serum electrolyte imbalances were observed with 100 mg CANA in this patient 
population. Furthermore, AEs related to osmotic diuresis and drop in blood pressure usually 
occured within approximately the first eight weeks of commencement of treatment. Hence, as 
precautionary measures, CANA treatment should not be initiated in patients with eGFR <60 
mL/min/1.73m2or CrCl < 60 mL/min. However patients already under well-tolerated treatment 
may continue therapy with dose adjustment to 100 mg/d as long as eGFR remains at or above 
45 mL/min/1.73 m2; below this value efficacy becomes too low and AEs are expected to increase 
so that CANA should then be discontinued. 
CANA enhances diuresis which leads to volume reduction and to counter-regulatory effects, 
manifesting themselves as reduced albuminuria and reversible decrease in eGFR which does not 
reflect renal damage. Similar mechanisms are at work when these patients are treated with 
thiazide diuretics. It is established that tight blood pressure control retards spontaneous 
deterioration of the diabetic kidney disease in the long term, and this BP control is often achieved 
with diuretics (also in combination with other agents). This argues against the assumption that 
diuretics, or agents that act as diuretics such as CANA, accelerate progression of diabetic 
nephropathy. 
Based on currently available data, cardiac safety of CANA is reasonably well demonstrated. 
Further data from the CV outcome study are awaited post-marketing.

The slight imbalance in low-trauma bone fractures (not favouring CANA) cannot be explained by 
renal calcium loss or otherwise adverse effects of CANA on bone. Fractures were mainly due to 
falls which could have been a consequence of CANA-induced drop in blood pressure.  
Non-clinical data indicate phototoxicity of CANA but clinical data indicate that this would play only 
a role at artificially high light intensities. Phase III trials indicate that serious photosensitivity 
reactions are highly unlikely and are therefore not regarded as a relevant concern.  
In non-clinical studies malignant neoplasms (in the kidney and adrenal gland of rats) were 
observed which were most likely species-specific. In patients, there was no imbalance in the 
incidence of neoplasms in the CANA vs. comparator group in the latest safety evaluation. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils 
the legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 2.2, the PRAC considers by 
consensus decision that the risk management system for canagliflozin (Invokana) in the 
treatment of in adults aged 18 years and older with T2DM to improve glycaemic control is 
acceptable. The following points should be taken into account in the next update.  
The RMP needs revision with the next RMP update to include consistent wording about 
toxicology results of the juvenile rat study on pregnancy and lactation. However, the 
preliminary view is that the RMP is approvable as the requested revision concerns minor issues 
that do not require immediate action or would preclude RMP approval.

products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
CANA 100 mg and 300 mg, compared to placebo, provided consistent, statistically significant 
and clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control when given as monotherapy in 
patients intolerant or with contraindications to metformin or as add-on to other AHAs including 
insulin. 
CANA was shown to have non-inferior antihyperglycaemic efficacy compared to glimepiride and 
sitagliptin after 52 weeks of treatment with both active comparators titrated to a sufficiently 
high dose to achieve full glucose lowering potential. For CANA 300mg even superiority over 
both active comparators was demonstrated. 
Durability of effect of both CANA doses has convincingly been shown, especially based on the 
52-week data from the extension periods of studies DIA 3002, 3004, 3005, 3006 as well as 
data from the active controlled studies (DIA 3009 and 3015). Over the course of one year, 
CANA demonstrated better durability of effect than the active comparators glimepiride and 
sitagliptin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 110/115 
 
  
  
 
The effect of CANA strongly depends on renal function. The efficacy of CANA in patients with 
eGFR 45- 60 mL/min/1.73m2 is reduced but still considered clinically relevant, whereas in 
patients with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73m2 it is clearly insufficient. 
CANA was associated with a consistent decrease in body weight from baseline. This effect was 
especially evident in comparison to SU (difference in weight 5.2% and 5.7% for 100 mg and 
300 mg CANA, respectively). Body composition investigations indicated that the body weight 
reduction with CANA was attributable to a greater decrease in body fat mass relative to lean 
body mass (with approximately 2/3 as fat mass loss). The weight loss can be explained by the 
CANA-induced renal nutrient loss. Fluid loss appears to play only a minor role. 
Across all phase III studies clinically relevant lowering of SBP and DBP was observed, which is 
considered a beneficial additional effect of CANA in the frequently hypertensive patients with 
T2DM. This is addressed by appropriate labelling. 
CANA itself has low propensity to cause hypoglycaemia. This was especially evident in 
comparison to glimepiride (hypoglycaemia incidence 3.1 vs. 1.9 vs. 12.7% in the CANA 100 
mg, CANA 300 mg and glimepiride, respectively). 
CANA has also been shown to be efficacious in elderly patients, who were adequately 
represented in the study program. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
By decreasing serum glucose levels through renal glucose elimination, CANA lowers 
endogenous insulin requirements thereby decreasing the burden on beta cells and potentially 
slowing exhaustion of beta cells/diabetes progression.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
According to its mechanism of action, CANA leads to dose- and blood glucose-dependent 
osmotic diuresis with increased urine volume and glucosuria. Resulting adverse events 
observed in the clinical trials are genital infection, haemoconcentration/dehydration, electrolyte 
disturbances and arterial hypotension. These are established AEs for SGLT2 inhibitors. In line 
with the observed haemoconcentration increases in serum creatinine and, consequently, 
decreases in calculated eGFR are observed upon treatment initiation, which are in general 
attenuated with continued treatment and reversible after cessation of treatment and do not 
indicate renal damage. 
Older patients and patients with relevant impairment of their renal function appear more 
vulnerable to the effects of CANA on water and electrolyte balance, resulting in more frequent 
dehydration-related AEs, especially at the 300 mg dose. 
The risk of dehydration is markedly increased in patients concomitantly taking loop diuretics. 
Therefore, this combination is not recommended. A potential canagliflozin-induced drop in 
blood pressure could pose a risk in patients with known cardiovascular disease, patients on 
antihypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension, elderly patients or patients with 
(intercurrent) conditions that may lead to volume depletion. As a precautionary measure, a 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 111/115 
 
  
  
starting dose of 100 mg is recommended for all patients. In case of concomitantly taken 
antihypertensive agents, dose adjustments may be necessary. 
Genital infections, mainly fungal infections, are clearly increased with CANA use, especially in 
females. There was only a slight increase in UTIs and no imbalance in serious/severe urogenital 
infections.  
Similar to other glucose-lowering agents that have low hypoglycaemic potential themselves, 
CANA increases the frequency of hypoglycaemic events when given in combination with insulin 
or an insulin secretagogue. Even then, however, severe hypoglycaemic events were rare and of 
similar frequency as observed with placebo. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
CV safety of CANA has been reasonably well established (MACE events in the meta-analysis 
including all patients from the phase II/III trials: HR 0.98, upper limit of the 95%CI 1.37). 
However, there was a concern that haemodynamic changes as induced by CANA, especially 
upon treatment initiation, could be less well tolerated in patients with pre-existing CV disease. 
An additional meta-analysis including all patients with increased CV risk (i.e. meeting the 
CANVAS inclusion criteria) was provided showing that the HR (CANA vs. non-CANA group) did 
not exceed 1 with an acceptable upper limit of the 95% CI of around 1.4 for MACE and MACE-
plus, which is reassuring. Final data from the ongoing CV outcome study will be submitted post-
authorisation. 
There was a small, questionable increase in bone fractures, starting rather soon after 
commencement of CANA treatment. Measurements of BMD (52-week data), bone markers, 
urinary calcium and PTH do not indicate urinary calcium loss or an otherwise detrimental effect 
of CANA on bone.  Based on the information obtained, the small excess rate of fractures could 
be due to a higher frequency of falls related to CANA-induced decrease in blood pressure.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Favourable effects 
The most important effect of an antihyperglycaemic agent is its ability to improve glycaemic 
control. CANA, at the proposed dose of 100 mg and 300 mg has clearly been shown to 
effectively lower HbA1c when given alone or in combination with various AHAs including insulin 
with the effect being similar or even superior to that of glimepiride and sitagliptin. The effect of 
CANA appears to be maintained based on week 52 data in studies DIA 3006, 3002, 3005, 3004, 
3009 and 3015. However, due to its dependency on renal function, the effect is only clinically 
relevant in patients with eGFR values ≥ 45 ml/min/1.73 m2. 
The reduction in body weight is an additional benefit in the usually obese patients with T2DM. 
The majority of the weight loss appears to be due to loss of fat mass including visceral fat and 
is sustained over time. CANA was superior in reducing body weight as compared to glimepiride 
and sitagliptin.  
CANA appears to reduce insulin requirements by reducing glucose load. This is considered 
favourable since insulin-induced weight gain is alleviated. In addition, the reduced burden on 
Assessment report  
EMA/718531/2013 
Page 112/115 
 
  
  
 
beta cells may have long-term benefits with regard to beta-cell function/diabetes progression, 
which would, however, need to be further investigated and confirmed. 
The observed reduction in blood pressure is beneficial in the frequently hypertensive patients 
with T2DM as it may, together with weight loss, contribute to a reduction in CV risk.  
The low propensity of CANA to cause hypoglycaemia is considered a beneficial effect which may 
be particularly relevant in patients at increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Unfavourable effects 
The most important risk of CANA is dehydration and its potential sequelae in vulnerable 
patients. Since dehydration is not usually expected for a glucose-lowering agent, this has been 
appropriately labelled.  
The small excess rate in bone fractures are unlikely to reflect direct effects of CANA on bone but 
a causal relationship with CANA-induced drop in blood pressure cannot be excluded. As a 
precautionary measure, a starting dose of 100 mg/day is recommended in all patients. 
Efficacy and tolerability decrease with decreasing renal function. Therefore, patients with a 
certain degree of renal impairment (eGFR below 45 mL/min/1.73m2) should no longer receive 
CANA. 
Genital infections were usually not serious and were manageable. Thus, genital infections, 
although frequent and unpleasant, are no important risk. The same is true for urinary tract 
infections, the frequencies of which were nearly balanced between CANA and comparator. 
Benefit-risk balance 
CANA could be a valuable asset to the already existing treatment options for T2DM. The overall 
treatment effect is clinically relevant and can be achieved in monotherapy or in combination 
with other antihyperglycaemic agents of different product classes including insulin. Adverse 
events are in most cases a consequence of the pharmacologic action of CANA and appear in 
general manageable in the overall patient population. 
However, due to the mechanism of action of CANA, its efficacy declines with decreasing renal 
function. Due to decreasing efficacy and tolerability (especially regarding water and electrolyte 
imbalance) in patients with profound renal impairment, the benefit/risk balance of CANA is 
considered unfavourable in patients with a GFR < 45 mL/min/1.73m2. In patients with eGFR 
≥45 and <60 ml/min/1.73m2 the benefit is modest but still clinically relevant and similar for the 
100 and 300 mg dose (placebo-adjusted HbA1c reduction of approx. 0.5%). However, with 300 
mg there is also a clearly increased reporting of adverse events related to water and electrolyte 
imbalance compared to comparator. In contrast, with 100 mg, the AE incidence is close to 
comparator level so that use of this dose in patients who are already on well-tolerated CANA 
therapy and whose eGFR drops below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 appears be justified as long as eGFR 
remains above 45 mL/7min/1.73m2.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Invokana in the treatment of: 
adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as: 
Monotherapy 
When diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom 
the use of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications;  
Add-on therapy 
Add-on therapy with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including insulin, when these, 
together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control 
is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject

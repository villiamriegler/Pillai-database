Patients can experience increased urges, particularly for 
further information about the risk of impulse control 
disorders, and section 4.8 of the SmPC to include the 
new ADRs ‘impulse control disorders’, ‘binge eating’, 
’compulsive shopping’ and ‘poriomania’ and to delete 
gambling, and the inability to control these urges while 
taking aripiprazole. Other urges, reported, include: 
increased sexual urges, compulsive shopping, binge or 
compulsive eating, and other impulsive and compulsive

the ADR ‘hyperglycaemia’. The Package Leaflet has 
been updated accordingly. Further, the MAH has 
implemented minor editorial changes in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC, section 6 of the Package leaflet and module 
3.2.P.1 to include lactose as one of the components of 
the excipient vanilla flavour for Abilify orodispersible 
tablets. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
align the annexes with the product information of 
Abilify Maintena and the latest QRD template.

behaviours. It is important for prescribers to ask patients or 
their caregivers specifically about the development of new or 
increased gambling urges, sexual urges, compulsive 
shopping, binge or compulsive eating, or other urges while 
being treated with aripiprazole. It should be noted that 
impulse-control symptoms can be associated with the 
underlying disorder; however, in some cases, urges were 
reported to have stopped when the dose was reduced or the 
medication was discontinued. Impulse control disorders may 
result in harm to the patient and others if not recognised. 
Consider dose reduction or stopping the medication if a 
patient develops such urges while taking aripiprazole.

The efficacy of aripiprazole was studied in paediatric subjects 
Product Characteristics (SPC) to include information 
related to studies 31-12-293 and 031-KOA-0703  
conducted in patients (6-18 years) with Tourette's 
disorder (TD). 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
with Tourette’s disorder (aripiprazole: n = 99, placebo: n = 
44) in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 8 
week study using a fixed dose weight-based treatment group 
design over the dose range of 5 mg/day to 20 mg/day and a 
starting dose of 2 mg. Patients were 7   17 years of age and 
presented an average score of 30 on Total Tic Score on the 
Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (TTS-YGTSS) at baseline. 
Aripiprazole showed an improvement on TTS-YGTSS change 
from baseline to Week 8 of 13.35, for the low dose group (5 
mg or 10 mg) and 16.94 for the high dose group (10 mg or 
20 mg) as compared with an improvement of 7.09 in the 
placebo group. 
The efficacy of aripiprazole in paediatric subjects with 
Tourette’s syndrome (aripiprazole: n = 32, placebo: n = 29) 
was also evaluated over a flexible dose range of 2 mg/day to 
20 mg/day and a starting dose of 2 mg, in a 10 week, 
randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study 
conducted in Korea. Patients were 6   18 years and presented 
an average score of 29 on TTS-YGTSS at baseline. 
Aripiprazole group showed an improvement of 14.97 on 
TTS-YGTSS change from baseline to Week 10 as compared 
with an improvement of 9.62 in the placebo group.

Group of variations related to the introduction of a new 
manufacturing site for the finished product including 
the following changes: 
B.II.b.1.d – addition of an alternative site responsible 
for the manufacture and quality control testing of the 
bulk finished product (orodispersible tablets and oral 
solution) 
In both of these short term trials, the clinical relevance of the 
efficacy findings has not been established, considering the 
magnitude of treatment effect compared to the large placebo 
effect and the unclear effects regarding psycho-social 
functioning. No long term data are available with regard to 
the efficacy and the safety of aripiprazole in this fluctuating 
disorder. 
Overall, the safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and 
adolescents 6 to 18 years of age have not yet been 
established. No recommendation on a posology can be made. 
This updated information is based on the results of studies 
submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric

Based on review of the results from a clinical study

the results of the epidemiological study CN138598. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications of 
the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, 
clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
conducted in paediatric patients, the CHMP concluded that 
these data were insufficient to evaluate the risk of suicide 
with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics in 
patients below 18 years of age, but there is evidence that the 
risk persists beyond the first 4 weeks of treatment for 
atypical antipsychotics, including aripiprazole.

aripiprazole in combination with mood stabilizers (lithium

manic episodes in patients with Bipolar I Disorder, the CHMP 
recommended to update section 4.2 of the SPC clarifying that 
the therapy should continue at the same dose for preventing 
recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been 
receiving aripiprazole as monotherapy or combination 
therapy. In addition, results from study CN138-189 were 
reflected in section 5.1 as follows: 
Page 18/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a 52-week, placebo-controlled trial, in patients with a 
current manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder who 
achieved sustained remission (Y-MRS and MADRS total 
scores ? 12) on aripiprazole (10 mg/day to 30 mg/day) 
adjunctive to lithium or valproate for 12 consecutive weeks, 
adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over 
placebo with a 46% decreased risk (hazard ratio of 0.54) in 
preventing bipolar recurrence and a 65% decreased risk 
(hazard ratio of 0.35) in preventing recurrence into mania 
over adjunctive placebo but failed to demonstrate superiority 
over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression. 
Adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over 
placebo on the secondary outcome measure, CGI-BP 
Severity of Illness score (mania). 
In this trial, patients were assigned by investigators with 
either open-label lithium or valproate monotherapy to 
determine partial non-response. Patients were stabilised for 
at least 12 consecutive weeks with the combination of 
aripiprazole and the same mood stabilizer. 
Stabilized patients were then randomised to continue the 
same mood stabilizer with double-blind aripiprazole or 
placebo. Four mood stabilizer subgroups were assessed in 
the randomised phase: aripiprazole + lithium; aripiprazole + 
valproate; placebo + lithium; placebo + valproate.

On the basis of the submitted data, the CHMP recommended 
Product Characteristics (SPC) to include information 
related to studies CN138-178, CN138-179, and 
CN138-180 conducted in patients (6-17 years) with 
irritability associated with autistic disorder (IAD) 
following CHMP conclusions on article 46 of Paediatric 
Regulation (P46-FUM 054). 
C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and 
Veterinary Medicinal Products - Other variation 
to reflect the following information: 
Section 4.2: Irritability associated with autistic disorder: the 
safety and efficacy of ABILIFY in children and adolescents 
below 18 years of age have not yet been established in 
irritability associated with autistic disorder. Currently 
available data are described in section 5.1 but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Section 5.1: Irritability associated with autistic disorder in 
paediatric patients (see section 4.2): aripiprazole was 
studied in patients aged 6 to 17 years in two 8-week, 
placebo-controlled trials [one flexible-dose (2-15 mg/day) 
and one fixed-dose (5, 10, or 15 mg/day)] and in one 
52-week open-label trial. Dosing in these trials was initiated 
at 2 mg/day, increased to 5 mg/day after one week, and 
increased by 5 mg/day in weekly increments to the target 
dose. Over 75% of patients were less than 13 years of age. 
Aripiprazole demonstrated statistically superior efficacy 
compared to placebo on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist 
Irritability subscale. However, the clinical relevance of this 
finding has not been established. The safety profile included 
weight gain and changes in prolactin levels. The duration of 
the long-term safety study was limited to 52 weeks. In the 
pooled trials, the incidence of low serum prolactin levels in 
females (<3 ng/ml) and males (<2 ng/ml) in 
aripiprazole-treated patients was 27/46 (58.7%) and 
258/298 (86.6%), respectively. In the placebo-controlled 
trials, the mean weight gain was 0.4 kg for placebo and 1.6 
kg for aripiprazole.

"In the pooled adolescent schizophrenia population (13-17 
years) with exposure up to 2 years, incidence of low serum 
prolactin levels in females (<3 ng/ ml) and males (<2 ng/ ml) 
was 29.5% and 48.3%, respectively." 
Further, the MAH took the opportunity to update the Package 
Leaflet in Section 2 to highlight to patients the importance of 
informing physicians about any symptoms suggestive of 
diabetes (symptoms of high blood sugar). 
In addition, the EMA name and website were updated 
throughout the Product Information and Annex II was

reporting data and world-wide published literature on 
antipsychotics and the risk of venous thromboembolic events 
(VTE). Despite the limitations of both sources of information 
(data from literature is limited by the lack of randomised 
controlled trial data and the heterogeneity of completed 
published studies; post marketing data is limited by potential 
confounding factors such as sedation and weight gain which 
are commonly present in antipsychotic users), the PhVWP 
concluded that an association between VTE and 
antipsychotics cannot be excluded. The PhVWP concluded 
that it was not possible to distinguish risk between different 
drugs and therefore there was no justification for warnings 
for VTE just for a few drugs. Following the PhVWP

conclusions, the CHMP recommended the inclusion of the 
proposed PhVWP class labelling into the Abilify SPC/PL. The 
ADRs table was updated to replace thromboembolic events 
by venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary 
embolism and deep vein thrombosis) and the following new 
warning was included in the SPC: 
- 
Cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been 
reported with antipsychotic drugs. Since patients treated 
with antipsychotics often present with acquired risk factors 
for VTE, all possible risk factors for VTE should be identified 
before and during treatment with ABILIFY and preventive 
measures undertaken. 
Furthermore, the introductory paragraph in section 4.8 of the 
SPC was also updated to align it with the information 
reflected in the Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) table.

CHMP conclusions on the 9th PSUR, the MAH amended the 
Product Information to introduce the following: 
- Congenital anomalies have been reported; however, causal 
relationship with aripiprazole could not be established. 
- Dystonia: Class Effect: Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged 
abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in 
susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. 
Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, 
sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing 
difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the 
tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they 
occur more frequently and with greater severity with high 
potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic 
drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in 
males and younger age groups.

placebo. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
pharmacovigilance analysis of the post marketing safety data 
and the meta-analysis of completed, controlled clinical trials 
of aripiprazole, with respect to parameters relevant to the 
evaluation of dyslipidaemia, as proposed in the Risk 
Management Plan and following CHMP’s request. In the 
pooled analysis on lipid parameters from placebo controlled 
clinical trials in adults, aripiprazole has not been shown to 
induce clinically relevant alterations in levels of total 
cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and fasting LDL. The following 
was added to the SPC: 
-Total cholesterol: incidence of changes in levels from normal 
(<5.18 mmol/l) to high (? 6.22 mmol/l) was 2.5% for

baseline was -0.15 mmol/l 
(95% CI: -0.182, -0.115) for aripiprazole and -0.11 mmol/l 
(95% CI: -0.148, -0.066) for placebo. 
-Fasting triglycerides: incidence of changes in levels from 
normal (<1.69 mmol/l) to high (? 2.26 mmol/l) was 7.4% for 
aripiprazole and 7.0% for placebo and mean change from 
baseline was -0.11 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.182, -0.046) for 
aripiprazole and -0.07 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.148, 0.007) for 
placebo. 
-HDL: incidence of changes in levels from normal (? 1.04 
mmol/l) to low (<1.04 mmol/l) was 11.4% for aripiprazole 
and 12.5% for placebo and mean change from baseline was 
-0.03 mmol/l 
(95% CI: -0.046, -0.017) for aripiprazole and -0.04 mmol/l 
(95% CI: -0.056, -0.022) for placebo. 
-Fasting LDL: incidence of changes in levels from normal 
(<2.59 mmol/l) to high (? 4.14 mmol/l) was 0.6% for 
aripiprazole and 0.7% for placebo and mean change from 
baseline was -0.09 mmol/l 
(95% CI: -0.139, -0.047) for aripiprazole and -0.06 mmol/l 
(95% CI: -0.116, -0.012) for placebo. 
The above results showed that in studies available and as

20.69 per 1,000 person years in current aripiprazole users 
(n=2,751). Compared with current users of other atypical 
antipsychotics combined, current aripiprazole users did not 
have an increased risk of suicide events (adjusted HR= 0.69, 
95% CI, 0.42-1.14). Since study CN138-458 mainly included 
patients with Bipolar Disorder (i.e 85%), the CHMP 
recommended to reflect these results for this population.

the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to provide all data 
related to the risk of suicide and suicide-related events in 
connection with aripiprazole treatment. The CHMP concluded 
that the association of aripiprazole with a higher risk of 
suicidality is possible. However, the magnitude of the risk is 
not possible to establish and it is also not possible to 
establish if the risk is different from other antipsychotic 
drugs. The CHMP considered an update of sections 4.4 and 
4.8 of the SPC was necessary to reflect this information. 
Therefore, the MAH submitted a type II variation to update 
the SPC and also amend sections 2 and 4 of the PL. In

CHMP concluded that these studies were specifically done to 
assess such interactions and the medicines targeted were 
very relevant in the indication for which aripiprazole is 
approved. These studies have shown that aripiprazole had no 
significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of 
either valproate or lithium and the CHMP agreed to include 
these data into the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SPC). Therefore, the MAH submitted this type II variation to

of interaction when aripiprazole was administered 
concomitantly with either valproate or lithium. Additionally, 
the Product Information has been amended in accordance

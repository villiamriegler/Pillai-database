INTRODUCTION 
The MAH, Pfizer, submitted on December 12, 2008 one set of completed studies conducted in 
patients with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation (controlled plus open label 
extension; Study1008-034 and Study 1008-035, respectively) containing some paediatric data 
(12 to 17 years old), in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as 
amended on medicinal products for paediatric use. In addition and in response to EMEA’s letter 
dated March 2, 2009, a short critical expert overview (2 pages) was provided on April 2, 2009 to 
supplement the Article 45 submission. 
These studies will be discussed in detail under section II.3 Clinical aspects. 
The complete data analysis of Study 1008-034 and an interim analysis of Study 1008-035 were 
previously included and assessed as part of the initial marketing authorisation application which 
included the indication adjunctive therapy with partial seizures with or without secondary 
generalisation as well as peripheral neuropathic pain. An EU approval was granted in July 2004 
and the MAH agreed to undertake a pediatric clinical development plan as part of their post 
marketing commitment (follow-up measure).  
Pfizer stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Lyrica and 
that there is no a consequential regulatory action. 
In addition, Pfizer conveyed that the follow-up measure to conduct a paediatric development 
plan in epilepsy is currently on-going and consists of the following studies: 
•  Study A0081074: Pregabalin BID pharmacokinetics and tolerability study; randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled with dose escalation in one month to 16 years old 
children. (on-going) 
•  Study A0081075: Open-Label extension to Study A0081074. (on-going) 
•  Study A0081041: double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety in pediatric 
patients of 5-16 years old. (planned) 
•  Study A0081042: double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety in paediatric 
patients 1 month to 4 years old. (planned)

1.  Introduction 
Pregabalin is the active substance of Lyrica. Pregabalin is indicated in the EU for the treatment 
of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in adults, as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial 
seizures with or without secondary generalisation and for the treatment in adults of generalized 
anxiety disorder. The recommended dose range is 150 to 600 mg per day given in either two 
(BID) or three doses (TID). 
Pfizer submitted the following clinical studies for assessment in accordance with the Paediatric 
Work Sharing Procedure Article 45: 
•  Study 1008-034: Pregabalin BID add-on trial: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel group, multicenter study in patients with partial seizures (12 to 17 
years old, 25 out of 455 patients). 
•  Study 1008-035: Pregabalin BID open-label add-on trial: an open-label, multi-center 
follow-on study to determine long-term safety and efficacy in patients with partial seizures 
(12 to 17 years old, 21out of 623 patients). 
As previously mentioned, the complete data analysis of Study 1008-034 and interim analysis of 
Study 1008-035 were part of the clinical development program assessed in granting the initial 
marketing authorisation in the EU in 2004. For study 1008-034 it was concluded that the data 
had no significant relevance for the paediatric population due to the limited number of paediatric 
studies. Since no additional data was submitted, this conclusion is maintained. 
Hence in this application, only Study 1008-035 contains new data to be assessed. 
However, for a complete overview on paediatric data also the data for study 1008-034 is 
discussed. 
2.  Clinical study(ies) 
According to the Critical Expert Overview, 36 pediatric patients were included in the 2 submitted 
studies. The breakdown of the number of pediatric patients by age and gender in the two studies 
is as follows: 
- 12 years: 3 (1F/2M) 
- 13 years: 6 (3F/3M) 
- 14 years: 2 (0F/2M) 
- 15 years: 6 (2F/4M) 
- 16 years: 8 (3F/5M) 
- 17 years: 11 (4F/7M). 
Study 1008-034: Synopsis 
Title: Pregabalin BID Add-On Trial: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel 
Group, Multi-center Study in Patients With Partial Seizures 
Study dates: November 11 – September 17, 1999 
Study objectives: 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dosages of pregabalin administered BID as add-on 
treatment in patients with partial seizures. 
Study participants 
Patients (≥ 12 years of age) with partial seizures (simple partial, complex partial, and/or 
secondarily generalized tonic clonic), no adequate seizure control on standard (anti-epileptic

drugs) AEDs and and were receiving 1 to 3 standard AEDs at doses within an acceptable 
therapeutic range were recruited. 
Methodology: 
After an 8-week baseline period, 455 patients entered a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, 
parallel-group, placebo-controlled and multi-center study. Randomization was to either placebo, 
or to 1 of 4 pregabalin dose groups: 50, 150, 300, or 600 mg/day administered BID. No active 
comparator was used.   
Outcomes and end-points  
Responder rate (the percent of patients who had at least a 50% reduction in 28-day seizure 
frequency compared to baseline seizure frequency), response ratio, number and percent of 
patients seizure-free, among others, were measured. 
Safety was evaluated using frequency and intensity of adverse events; physical, opthalmological 
and neurological examinations; 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with a 2-minute cardiac 
rhythm strip; and laboratory tests including hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis during 
the trial period. Standard plasma/serum AED concentration and plasma pregabalin 
concentrations were assessed.

Patients in the 150, 300 and 600 mg/day pregabalin groups had significantly greater responder 
rates compared to placebo. Pregabalin showed a significant linear response (increase in 
responder rate) with increasing dose. Consistent results were observed in the response ratio. As 
to the number and percent of patients seizure-free, trends were seen favoring the 300 and 600 
mg/day doses of pregabalin compared to placebo at the 28- and 42-day seizure-free periods.

The majority of adverse events in the placebo and in all pregabalin groups were mild or 
moderate in intensity. The incidence of overall adverse events, and of withdrawals due to 
adverse events, showed a dose-related increase at the 300 and 600 mg/day doses relative to 
the control group. There was a dose-related increase in the incidence of CNS adverse events 
and weight gain at the 150, 300 and 600 mg/day doses. The incidence of serious adverse 
events was relatively low (ranging from 2% to 4% per group) and comparable in the placebo and 
pregabalin groups. There were no deaths. In the 600 mg/day pregabalin group, a greater 
percentage of patients had moderate or severe adverse events compared to the patients in the 
placebo group. 
There were no meaningful treatment-related differences in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), or the results of neurological, physical, or opthalmological 
examinations. 
MAH Conclusions 
Pregabalin administered BID at doses of 150, 300 and 600 mg/day is highly effective 
as add-on therapy when compared to placebo, exhibiting a clear dose response in the 
primary and secondary efficacy parameters. 
Pregabalin 50 mg/day is not an effective dose while 150 mg/day is the minimum effective 
dose. 
Pregabalin, with no initial titration, is well-tolerated at doses of 50, 150 and 300 mg/day and less 
but still tolerated by most at 600mg/day. 
RAPPORTEUR’S COMMENTS 
The different pediatric age groups were not represented. Only adolescents (12 -
17 years old) were included in the study and their number is very limited (25 out 
of 455 patients). No separate analysis for this age group was submitted. On the 
other hand, whatever efficacy and safety outcomes generated would have 
virtually no significant relevance for the whole pediatric target population due to 
the limited number of paediatric subjects.  
Study 1008-035: Synopsis 
Title: Pregabalin BID Open-Label Add-On Trial: An Open-Label, Multicenter Follow- 
On Study to Determine Long-Term Safety and Efficacy in Patients With Partial Seizures 
Study dates: January 27, 1999 – November 7, 2005 
Study objectives 
To obtain information on open-label long-term safety and tolerance of pregabalin administered 
as adjunctive therapy at doses from 100 to 600 mg/day administered BID in patients with partial 
seizures and to evaluate the long-term efficacy of pregabalin as adjunctive treatment with AEDs 
in patients with partial seizures. 
PATIENT POPULATION 
Patients included were those who completed or exited early the preceding double-blind study 
(Protocol 1008-034) as well as new patients (due to an amendment) ≥  4 partial seizures in the 2 
months prior to screening.

An open-label, uncontrolled, multi-center trial consisting of 2 study phases, 7 days at 400 
mg/day BID, followed by an extended open-label treatment phase during which the pregabalin 
dose may be adjusted for efficacy and tolerability according to clinical signs and symptoms from 
100 to 600 mg/day BID. 
TREATMENT  
All patients were introduced directly to a common dose of 400 mg/day BID of pregabalin open-
label treatment for 1 week. Following this transition phase, patients either continued 400 mg/day 
or had the dose adjusted between 100 and 600 mg/day. Open-label treatment continued for up 
to 338 weeks provided that therapeutic response and tolerability were maintained. 
EFFICACY PARAMETERS 
Responder rate (proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency 
during open-label treatment compared to baseline), response ratio and percent change in 28-
day seizure rate from baseline to open-label treatment, among others, were measured. 
SAFETY PARAMETERS  
Frequency and intensity of adverse events; physical, opthalmological, and neurological 
examinations; 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with a 2-minute cardiac rhythm strip; and 
laboratory tests including hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis during the trial period. 
Results 
Participants’ flow 
Patients’ exposure to pregabalin 
Four hundred ninety four (79%) of the patients received at least 24 weeks of pregabalin 
exposure, 381 (61%) received at least 52 weeks (1 year) of pregabalin exposure, 193 (31%) 
received at least 104 weeks (2 years) of  pregabalin exposure and 132 (21%) received at least 
156 weeks (3 years) of pregabalin exposure. 
Efficacy 
A responder rate of 37% and a median percent reduction from baseline in seizure frequency of 
38% were seen for the ITT population during the initial 84-day (12-week) period of open-label. 
For the cohort of patients followed for 2 years, the responder rate and median percent change at 
subsequent intervals were maintained over time. Consistent results were observed in the 
response ratio. A total of 8% of the ITT patients were seizure - free for the 6 months since the 
last observation.

Of the 623 patients who received pregabalin, 593 (95%) experienced at least 1 adverse event 
and from whom 504 (81%) were considered related to treatment. Most adverse events were mild 
or moderate in intensity. Severe adverse events occurred for 147 patients (24%) and from whom 
49 patients (7.9%) were considered treatment-related. A total of 75 (13%) withdrew due to 
adverse events and from whom 61 patients (10%) were considered related to treatment. Seven 
patients died and none of the deaths was considered associated with pregabalin treatment. The 
adverse event profile for the uncontrolled studies was similar to that seen in the controlled 
studies, with central nervous system adverse events, accidental injury, peripheral edema and 
weight gain being the most frequent. 
MAH Conclusions 
Pregabalin shows efficacy similar to that seen in the double-blind studies in terms of responder 
rate (37% of patients) and median percent reduction from baseline (38%) in the ITT patient 
population during the initial 84-day (12 week) period of open-label. 
Pregabalin appears to have a sustained anti-convulsant effect with long term use. For the cohort 
of patients followed for 2 years, the responder rate and median percent change were maintained 
over time. 
During the open-label studies, 8% of pregabalin patients in the ITT population were seizure-free 
for 6 months at the last observation. 
The adverse event profile for the uncontrolled studies is similar to that seen in the controlled 
studies, with central nervous system adverse events, accidental injury, peripheral edema and 
weight gain being the most frequent. 
Overall, the results of this study indicate that pregabalin is effective and generally well-tolerated 
in this patient population during long-term exposure. 
RAPPORTEUR’S COMMENTS 
This is an open-label designed study and as such, is of limited value for efficacy 
assessment.  
A very high percentage of the patients (31.9%) dropped-out mainly due to lack of 
efficacy in comparison with12% who withdrew due to adverse events. Based 
solely on this, no conclusion can be drawn on efficacy.  
The paediatric sample size is very small. No children were included and only 21 
adolescents (12 -17 years old) out of 623 patients were recruited in the study. A 
separate analysie of the data from the last mentioned pediatric age group was not 
presented. However, even if these would have been provided, the clinical 
relevance in the whole pediatric target population is questionable as the number 
is too small for an estimate of efficacy and safety.  
The reported common adverse events are what to be expected from the mode of 
action of pregabalin. CNS adverse events like dizziness, somnolence and 
headache as well as accidental injury, infection and weight gain are the most 
common ones. 
The frequencies of the most common adverse events are considerably higher in 
the long term safety study as compared to the short term efficacy study.  This 
might be due to the fact that the incidences accumulative.

More important these are dominantly data for adults, only 21out of 623 patients 
were between 12 to 17 years and no children are included. Hence in general, the 
MAH’s overall conclusion is accepted. 
IV. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
Based on the 2 studies submitted, the overall conclusions of the MAH are endorsed. Nothing 
new could be said about Study 1008-034 as this was assessed previously. The open-label 
extension Study 1008-035 contains some data not previously assessed but efficacy assessment 
is limited due to its open-label and uncontrolled design. Moreover and most important, the 
number of children and adolescent patients included in the studies is very limited and hence the 
concrete clinical relevance of the results to the paediatric population still remains to be 
confirmed.  
The overall safety profile of pregabalin in studies 1008 035/036 is what can be expected from 
the mode of action of the compound. However, the population is dominamt an adult population.  
Whether the efficacy and safety is the same for children and adolescents remains to be 
substantiated.  
In conclusion, the additional data submitted do not allow a benefit/risk assessment of Lyrica 
used in children and adolescents. The following wording in section 4.2 of the current SPC is still 
valid: 
“Use in children and adolescents 
Lyrica is not recommended for use in children below the age of 12 years and adolescents 
(12-17 years of age) due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.” 
Therefore, no changes in the SPC are required. 
  Recommendation  
No further regulatory action is required. The studies in children agreed with the MAH at the time 
of registration need to be awaited.

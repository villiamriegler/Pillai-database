2. Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic virus that first emerged as a human pathogen in China 
and has rapidly spread around the world by human-to-human transmission. In December 2019, a 
pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, it became clear 
that a novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was the underlying cause. In early January 2020, the genetic 
sequence of the 2019-nCoV became available to the World Health Organization (WHO) and public, and 
the virus was categorized in the Betacoronavirus subfamily. By sequence analysis, the phylogenetic 
tree revealed a closer relationship to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus isolates than to 
other coronaviruses that infect humans, including the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation

Page 7/8  
coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting disease COVID-19 have since then spread 
globally. On 11 March 2020 the WHO characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication and dosing administration for BNT162b2 (10 µg) are: 
•  Proposed indication: Active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by 
SARS-CoV-2 virus, in children aged 5 to 11 years.  
•  Dosing administration: single 10 µg (i.e.0.2-mL) intramuscular (IM) dose followed by a 
second 10 µg (i.e. 0.2-mL) dose 3 weeks later 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
All ages may present with the disease, but notably, case fatality rates (CFR) are elevated in persons 
>60 years of age. Comorbidities are also associated with increased CFR, including cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic respiratory disease. Healthcare workers are over-
represented among COVID-19 patients due to occupational exposure to infected patients.  
There are currently several vaccines approved for prevention of COVID-19 in adolescents, adults and 
elderly, but none for the use in children 5 to 11 years old. COVID-19 in children is mostly a mild 
disease although severe cases occur rarely, particularly in those with underlying, predisposing 
comorbidities.   
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus with four structural proteins. One of them, the Spike protein is a surface 
protein which binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) present on host cells. Therefore, the 
Spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development. It has been shown that 
antibodies against the Spike protein neutralise the virus and prevent infection. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The presentation of COVID-19 is generally with cough and fever, with chest radiography showing 
ground-glass opacities or patchy shadowing. However, many patients present without fever or 
radiographic changes, and infections may be asymptomatic which is relevant to controlling 
transmission. For symptomatic subjects, progression of disease may lead to acute respiratory distress 
syndrome requiring ventilation and subsequent multi-organ failure and death. 
Common symptoms in hospitalized patients (in order of highest to lowest frequency) include fever, dry 
cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, myalgias, nausea/vomiting or diarrhoea, headache, weakness, and 
rhinorrhoea. Anosmia (loss of smell) or ageusia (loss of taste) may be the sole presenting symptom in 
approximately 3% of individuals who have COVID-19.  
The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined COVID 19 symptoms as including 1 
or more of the following:  
• 
• 
• 
Fever 
New or increased cough 
New or increased shortness of breath

Chills
New or increased muscle pain
New loss of taste or smell
Sore throat
Diarrhoea
Vomiting
Fatigue
Headache
Nasal congestion or runny nose
Nausea
In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. The reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test methods targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA are 
the gold standard in vitro methods for diagnosing suspected cases of COVID-19. Samples to be tested 
are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. Molecular methods used to confirm an active 
infection are usually performed within a few days of exposure and around the time that symptoms may 
begin. 
2.2.  About the product 
A conditional marketing authorization was granted for Comirnaty 30 µg by the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) on 21 December 2020 for individuals ≥16 years of age and was later extended on 28 
May 2021 to include individuals ≥12 years of age. This application concerns use of Comirnaty 10 µg in 
children from 5 to <12 years of age and a new age appropriate strength (0.1 mg/ml). 
The vaccine is based on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) antigens encoded in RNA formulated in 
lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and is referred to as BNT162b2 (BioNTech code number BNT162, Pfizer code 
number PF-07302048). The structural elements of the vector backbones of BNT162 vaccines are 
optimized for prolonged and strong translation of the antigen-encoding RNA. The potency of RNA 
vaccines is further optimized by encapsulation of the RNA into LNPs, which protect the RNA from 
degradation by RNAses and enable transfection of host cells after IM delivery. 
The vaccine is presently indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 
virus, in individuals 12 years of age and older as 30 µg per dose. In the current application, the 
formulation for children at ages between 5 to 11 contains 10 µg per dose. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
Comirnaty is still authorised under a conditional marketing authorisation. 
Orphan designation 
Not Applicable.

Similarity with orphan medicinal products 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.  
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0396/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0396/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
Pfizer and BioNTech have developed the Comirnaty vaccine to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on SARS CoV-2 spike (S) 
glycoprotein antigens encoded in RNA and formulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). 
There are two approved formulations of Comirnaty vaccine: 
•
•
PBS/Sucrose finished product or Comirnaty, 30 microgram/dose, concentrate for dispersion for
injection which received a conditional approval 21 December 2020 (EMEA/H/C/005735)
Tris/Sucrose finished product or Comirnaty, 30 microgram/dose, dispersion for injection,
approved 3 November 2021 (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044)
The primarily difference is the buffer used for finished product formulation and requirement for dilution 
prior to administration. The Tris/Sucrose finished product (Comirnaty dispersion for injection) is 
formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in 10 mM Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, pH 7.4 and is filled into vials at 
2.25 mL fill volume, providing 6 doses of 30 μg RNA in 0.3 mL injection volume. 
This line extension supports a 10 μg dosage presentation of Tris/Sucrose finished product for 
immunization of children 5-11 years of age. The 10 μg dosage presentation differs from the already 
authorised 30 μg presentation only in the fill volume and requirement for dilution prior to 
administration: 
•
•
The 30 μg RNA dosage presentation is filled at 2.25 mL fill volume and is administered without
dilution, providing 6 doses, each a 30 μg RNA dose in 0.3 mL injection volume.
The 10 μg RNA dosage presentation is filled at 1.3 mL fill volume and requires dilution with 1.3
mL 0.9% sodium chloride prior to administration, providing 10 doses, each a 10 μg RNA dose
in 0.2 mL injection volume.
This submission details the manufacture and testing of one Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) lot 
at Puurs, formulated at  XX L batch scale and filled into vials at 1.3 mL (XX L) and 0.4 mL ( XX L) fill 
volumes supporting 10 μg and 3 μg doses. The 3 μg dosage presentation is planned for future line 
extension application with clinical data supporting a paediatric presentation for younger children.

EMA/719541/2021 
Page 10/11  
The finished product is supplied in a 2 mL glass vial sealed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and an 
aluminum seal with flip-off plastic cap. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance used to manufacture the Tris/Sucrose finished product is identical to that used for 
the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished product. Consequently, there are no changes to the active 
substance sections and full reference is made to the active substance data of Comirnaty, concentrate 
for dispersion for injection, (EMEA/H/C/005735). 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a preservative-free, sterile dispersion of RNA-containing lipid nanoparticles in 
an aqueous cryoprotectant buffer for intramuscular injection. There are two formulations of Comirnaty 
vaccine, one designated PBS/Sucrose or Comirnaty concentrate for dispersion for injection which 
received a conditional approval in December 2020 and one designated Tris/Sucrose or Comirnaty 
dispersion for injection which received an approval in November 2021 (line extension 
EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044). The primary difference is the buffer used for finished product formulation 
and requirement for dilution prior to administration. The Tris/Sucrose finished product (Comirnaty 
dispersion for injection) is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in 10 mM Tris buffer, 300 mM sucrose, pH 7.4 
and is filled into vials at 2.25 mL fill volume, providing 6 doses of 30 μg RNA in 0.3 mL injection 
volume. 
This line extension (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077) supports a 10 μg dosage presentation of Tris/Sucrose 
finished product for immunisation of children 5-11 years of age. 
There are two dosages of the Tris/Sucrose finished product – 30 and 10 μg RNA per dose. The two 
doses differ only in the fill volume and requirement for dilution prior to administration for the 10 µg 
RNA per dose: 
-
-
The 30 μg RNA dose is filled at 2.25 mL fill volume and is administered without dilution,
providing 6 doses, each a 30 μg RNA dose in 0.3 mL injection volume.
The 10 μg RNA dose is filled at 1.3 mL fill volume and requires dilution with 1.3 mL 0.9%
sodium chloride prior to administration, providing 10 doses, each a 10 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL
injection volume.
The composition of the finished product, including quality standard, function, concentration and 
amount per dose for the 30 and 10 μg doses are provided in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively.

well as in the Tris/Sucrose finished product. The buffer components Tris base (Trometamol) and Tris 
HCl (Trometamol hydrochloride) are commonly used excipients in several already approved parenteral 
finished products in the EU, including vaccines and products for paediatric use.  
At the time of initial authorisation, ALC-0315 and ALC-0159 were novel excipients. In order to confirm 
the purity profile and ensure comprehensive quality control and batch-to-batch consistency throughout 
the lifecycle of the finished product, additional information have been provided as requested in specific 
obligations (SO) for the PBS/Sucrose finished product. The data to fulfil SO4 and SO5 were submitted 
by end of July 2021 and in November 2021 and are currently under assessment via variation 
procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0054/G. 
The container closure system for the commercial BNT162b2 Tris/Sucrose finished product is a 2 mL 
Type I borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass vial and a 13 mm bromobutyl stopper.  
The processing aids used in the manufacture have been specified in the composition together with a 
foot note that they are essentially removed through the manufacturing process and are not considered 
as ingredients (excipients). 
This is found acceptable. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The major part of the content in section P.2 for the Tris/Sucrose finished product is contained in the 
dossier for the already approved Line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044. However, the section P.2 
has been updated in various parts in this specific Line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077. 
QTPP 
The QTPP that was developed for the Tris/Sucrose finished product and provided in the already 
approved Line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044, has been updated to include finished product 
filled at 1.3 mL fill volume. 
Finished product 
The approved Tris/Sucrose finished product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in Tris buffer and sucrose 
and is filled into vials at 2.25 mL fill volume, providing 6 doses of 30 μg RNA in 0.3 mL injection 
volume (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044).  
This specific line extension (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077) supports a presentation of Tris/Sucrose 
finished product filled into vials at 1.3 mL fill volume, providing (after dilution) 10 doses of 10 μg RNA 
in 0.2 mL injection volume, for immunization of children 5-11 years of age. The 10 μg presentation 
differs from the already authorised 30 μg presentation only in the fill volume and requirement for 
dilution prior to administration for the 10 µg RNA per dose. 
Acceptable results have been provided demonstrating that the target fill volume for the 10 μg finished 
product when diluted at the point of use with 0.9% sodium chloride is suitable for delivering 10 doses 
at 0.2 mL per multi-dose vial. This study includes assessment of hold-up volume and delivered dose 
volume for 10 μg dose vials after dilution with 0.9% sodium chloride. The provided results also show 
that the 2 mL vial can contain the total volume of 2.6 mL corresponding to 1.3 mL of finished product 
and 1.3 mL 0.9% sodium chloride. 
There are no formula overages in the finished product, only an overfill which has been acceptably 
justified. 
In summary, the section on finished product development has been acceptably updated to include 
finished product filled at 1.3 mL fill volume for 10 μg doses.

EMA/719541/2021 
Page 13/14  
Formulation development 
The formulation development of the Tris/Sucrose formulation was described in the already approved 
Line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044. The development of the Tris/Sucrose finished product 
showed quality attributes highly comparable and also within the clinical ranges of the current approved 
PBS/Sucrose finished product but with an improved stability profile in support of increased storage 
times at -20 °C and 2-8 °C that would simplify transport and administration. 
Lot genealogy 
Lot Genealogy for the Tris/Sucrose finished product has been provided for primary stability lots and for 
process performance qualification lots including both the 30 µg and 10 µg dose finished product 
(PPQ5). Batch Analyses data are provided. 
Manufacturing process development and characterization 
The section on manufacturing process development and characterisation has been updated with shear 
stress calculations as well as with thawing time data for vials filled at 1.3 mL fill volume. This section 
has also been updated with PPQ 5 that has been manufactured for filling of 1.3 mL and 0.4 mL fill 
volume, corresponding to 10 µg and 3 µg dose finished product. The 3 μg dose presentation is planned 
for a future registration with clinical trial data supporting a new paediatric indication but is not 
assessed in this report. The information provided is found sufficient. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system for the commercial Tris/Sucrose finished product is a 2 mL Type I 
borosilicate or aluminosilicate glass vial and 13 mm bromobutyl rubber stopper and these are 
compliant with the compendial requirements of the Ph. Eur. and are further addressed in section 
3.2.P.7. 
The dossier has been updated with satisfactory data from a study on penetrability, fragmentation and 
self-sealing capacity to support 11 punctures of the 10 µg dose vial. This section has also been 
updated for container closure integrity verification in support of freezing and shipping of finished 
product filled at the filling volume of 2.25 mL, considered as worst case condition of maximum filling 
volume. The development of container closure system is sufficiently presented and this is found 
acceptable. 
Microbiological attributes 
The dossier has been updated to add container closure integrity studies for vials filled at the filling line 
WSL10 at Pfizer, Puurs utilized for filling at 1.3 mL filling volume for 10 µg doses. 
The BNT162b2 Tris/Sucrose finished product container closure system has been evaluated by dye 
ingress, vacuum decay and headspace analysis testing methods. These studies have provided 
acceptable data and verified that the stopper/vial/cap combinations maintain integrity when capped 
with low and high spring force settings. Results shown provide evidence of container closure integrity 
for the BNT162b2 Tris/Sucrose finished product container closure system. 
Compatibility 
The administration simulation and compatibility studies performed for the Tris/Sucrose finished product 
for the 1.3 mL fill volume demonstrate physical and chemical stability of undiluted and diluted finished 
product (diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride) for up to 24 hours at ambient temperature in vials. These 
studies also demonstrate stability of both undiluted and diluted finished product in syringes for 12 
hours at ambient temperature or 24 hours at refrigerated temperature (2-8 °C). 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 14/15  
Microbial studies have been performed for Tris/Sucrose finished product and based on physicochemical 
stability and microbial in-use growth results, the Tris/Sucrose finished product vials (both 2.25 mL and 
1.3 mL fill volume) may be held at ambient temperatures for up to 24 hours, but once punctured, 
either for dilution or first use, may be held at 2°C to 25°C and should be used or discarded within 12 
hours. 
In summary, compatibility of the 1.3 mL fill volume Tris/sucrose finished product is acceptably 
demonstrated by compatibility studies provided on physicochemical stability and microbial in-use hold 
time.  
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing sites and the manufacturing process are the same as for the Tris/Sucrose finished 
product Comirnaty dispersion for injection 30 microgram/dose (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044) except for 
a different fill volume. 
The manufacturing process consists of four major manufacturing steps – LNP fabrication, bulk finished 
product formation, sterile filtration and aseptic filling.  
The commercial batch size is XX L of finished product solution corresponding to approximately XX vials 
at 1.3 mL fill volume. The manufacturing process is sufficiently described, and suitable in-process 
controls (IPCs) are applied. 
Process validation has been performed on one Process Performance Qualification batch at XX L 
manufactured at Pfizer Puurs. The batch is split into XX L at 1.3 mL fill volume (PPQ 5a) and XX L at 
0.4 mL fill volume (PPQ 5b). All data complies with the pre-specified criteria and sufficiently 
demonstrate that the manufacturing process is robust and provides a finished product with adequate 
quality. Since only the fill volume differs from the approved Tris/Sucrose finished product, the process 
validation for that product (2.25 ml fill volume) is considered as supportive, and a single PPQ batch 
(1.3 ml and 0.4 ml fill volume) is considered sufficient for process validation. In addition, Official EU 
batch release (for blood products and vaccines) will be performed by the OMCL. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product specifications at release and shelf life include tests for Appearance (Visual), 
Appearance (Visible Particulates), Subvisible Particles (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), Osmolality 
(Osmometry), LNP Size (Dynamic Light Scattering), LNP Polydispersity (Dynamic Light Scattering), 
RNA Encapsulation (Fluorescence assay), RNA content (Fluorescence assay), ALC-0315 content (HPLC-
CAD), ALC-0159 content (HPLC-CAD), DSPC content (HPLC-CAD), Cholesterol content (HPLC-CAD), 
vial content (volume) (USP), Lipid identities (HPLC-CAD), Identity of encoded RNA sequence (RT-PCR), 
Potency / in Vitro Expression (Cell-based flow cytometry), RNA Integrity (Capillary Gel 
Electrophoresis), Bacterial Endotoxin (Ph. Eur.), Sterility (Ph. Eur.) and Container Closure Integrity 
(Dye incursion). For all quality attributes tested on stability except for RNA integrity and LNP size, the 
acceptance criteria for release and stability testing throughout shelf life are the same. 
The specifications and justifications of specifications for the Tris/Sucrose finished product are based on 
the specifications as contained in the dossier for the already approved Line extension 
EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044. The acceptance criteria that differ between the specifications included in 
the approved Line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044 and this specific applied Line extension 
EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077 is only the vial content (volume), not less than 1.222 mL (for 1.3 mL fill 
volume). 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 15/16  
The vial content (volume) for the Tris/Sucrose finished product was determined to ensure that each 
1.3 mL filled vial can deliver ten 10 μg doses of 0.2 mL each, following the addition of 1.3 mL 0.9% 
sodium chloride. The provided justification for vial content (volume) of 1.3 mL fill volume is found 
acceptable. 
Validation of analytical procedure 
This section has been updated to add qualification data for the container content test. A bracketing 
approach was used to validate the method for all Tris/Sucrose finished product presentations, with the 
highest and lowest fill volumes selected, 2.25 mL and 0.4 mL, respectively. This approach is found 
acceptable. 
Batch analysis 
The section on batch analysis data have been updated with release data for PPQ5, filled at 1.3 and 0.4 
mL fill volume. This PPQ5 lot met all the release specifications of the Tris/Sucrose finished product  
specifications document. 
The manufacture of PPQ5 has been detailed and the lot genealogy is provided in the dossier. In 
addition, PPQ5 is included in the stability program and initial testing results have been provided in 
dossier section P.8. 
The specification, analytical procedures, and batch analysis are found acceptable, and no issues are 
raised. 
Reference standard 
Reference standards or material are identical to the approved Tris/Sucrose finished product Comirnaty 
dispersion for injection 30 microgram/dose (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044). 
Container closure system 
The container closure system is identical to the approved Tris/Sucrose finished product Comirnaty 
dispersion for injection 30 microgram/dose (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044). 
Tris/Sucrose finished product is filled in a Type I borosilicate glass vial or an aluminosilicate glass vial. 
The same stoppers and seals/caps are used as for the PBS/Sucrose finished product. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf-life for the 10 μg dosage presentation is 6 months at the long-term storage 
condition of -90 to -60 °C with an additional 10 weeks storage at 2-8 °C at the point of use.  
The major part of the content of stability section P.8 for the Tris/Sucrose finished product is contained 
in the dossier for already approved Line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044. However, the section 
P.8 has been updated in various parts in this Line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0077.
The approved initial shelf-life for the Tris/Sucrose 30 μg finished product is 6 months when stored at 
the recommended long-term storage condition of -90 to -60 °C. Additionally, 10 weeks storage at 2-8 
°C is approved at the point of use within the 6 months shelf-life. This 6 months shelf-life is based on 
the results provided in the recently approved line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/0044. 
In this specific applied line extension EMEA/H/C/005735/0077, sections P.5.4 and P.8 have been 
updated to include the initial release testing results for the PPQ5 lot filled at 1.3 mL and 0.4 mL fill 
volume. The results met all acceptance criteria in the finished product specifications document. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 16/17  
Based on the totality of stability data available for the Tris/Sucrose finished product (both 10 μg and 
30 μg dosage presentation) as well as the fact that the only difference between the PPQ5 lot of the 10 
μg dosage presentation and the other 30 μg dosage batches included in the stability program is the fill 
volume, 2.25 mL versus 1.3 mL, the proposed shelf-life of 6 months at the recommended long-term 
storage condition of -90 to -60 °C and the additional 10 weeks storage at 2-8 °C at the point of use, is 
agreed to for the 10 μg dosage presentation. 
This is found acceptable. However, it is expected that all the ongoing stability studies at long-term 
conditions will be continued until completion and that any results of out-of-trend or out-of-
specifications will be reported to the competent authorities. A clarification should be included in 
stability section P.8 in the closing sequence to confirm this. 
2.4.3.5.  Post approval change management protocol(s) 
Not applicable. 
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
The active substance used to manufacture the Tris/Sucrose finished products (30 micrograms/dose 
and 10 micrograms/dose) is identical to that used for the currently approved PBS/Sucrose finished 
product. Consequently, there are no changes to the active substance sections and full reference is 
made to the active substance data of Comirnaty, concentrate for dispersion for injection 
(EMEA/H/C/005735). Adequate testing for bioburden, endotoxins and sterility are also included at 
appropriate stages of the manufacturing process of the finished product. 
2.4.3.7.  GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The Tris/Sucrose finished product is formulated at 0.1 mg/mL RNA in 10 mM Tris buffer, 300 mM 
sucrose, pH 7.4. There are two dosages of the Tris/Sucrose finished product – 30 and 10 μg RNA per 
dose. The two doses differ only in the fill volume and requirement for dilution prior to administration: 
-
-
The 30 μg RNA dose is filled at 2.25 mL fill volume and is administered without dilution,
providing 6 doses, each a 30 μg RNA dose in 0.3 mL injection volume.
The 10 μg RNA dose is filled at 1.3 mL fill volume and requires dilution with 1.3 mL 0.9%
sodium chloride prior to administration, providing 10 doses, each a 10 μg RNA dose in 0.2 mL
injection volume.
The section on pharmaceutical development is found sufficiently comprehensive and acceptable. 
The manufacturing sites and the manufacturing process are the same as for the already approved 
Tris/Sucrose finished product, 30 μg/dose (EMEA/H/C/005735/X/0044) except for a different fill 
volume. The manufacturing process is sufficiently described, and suitable in-process controls (IPCs) 
are applied. 
Process validation has been satisfactorily performed on one Process Performance Qualification batch at 
XX L manufactured at Pfizer Puurs and this is found sufficient. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 17/18  
The specifications document for the Tris/Sucrose finished product includes a comprehensive set of 
relevant tests and the proposed acceptance criteria are found acceptable and adequately justified for 
all quality attributes included and no issues are raised. 
The proposed 6 months shelf-life at -90 to -60 °C and 10 weeks storage at 2-8 °C at the point of use 
within the 6 months shelf-life is agreed to. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the CHMP considers that this line 
extension application to register Comirnaty (10 micrograms/dose) concentrate for dispersion for 
injection is approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable 
by the CHMP.

2.6.2.1.  Dose response study 
Phase 1 part of paediatric Study C4591007 
Children from 5 to <12 years of age received escalating dose levels of BNT162b2 (10 µg, 20 µg, or 30 
µg) administered as a 2-dose series 21 days apart, with progression to higher dose levels based on 
recommendations from an IRC. Each dose level was planned to be administered to 16 participants, for 
a total of 48 vaccinated children 5 to <12 years of age. Due to reactogenicity, the 30 µg dose was only 
given as a first dose to 4 subjects, and the remainder of the subjects in this group received 10 µg 
instead. At Day 7 post-Dose 2, the GMTs were similar across the tested dose levels.   
The MAH concluded that BNT162b2 elicited robust SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers by 7 days after 
Dose 2 at both tested dose levels when administered to healthy children 5 to <12 years of age. The 10 
µg dose was selected for use in phase 2/3 of the study.

Recruitment 
The study started to recruit 24.03.2021 and is still ongoing. 
Conduct of the study 
The Phase 1/2/3 Study C4591007 was undertaken by Pfizer and BioNTech and conducted at a total of 
84 sites as of the data cut-off date (06 September 2021): 11 in Finland, 8 in Poland, 10 in Spain, and 
55 in the US. There were an additional 2 study centres in the US that received study drug but did not 
enter any participants. For Phase 1, participants were entered at US sites only. 
The study was conducted by investigators contracted by and under the direction of Pfizer. The 
investigators were responsible for adhering to the study procedures described in the protocol, for 
keeping records of the study intervention, and for ensuring accurate completion of the CRFs and DCTs 
supplied by the sponsor. 
No sites were terminated from the study as of the Phase 2/3 data cut-off date (06 September 2021). 
The paediatric investigational Plan has label EMEA-002861-PIP02. The original protocol from 5.02.2021 
has been amended 3 times: 5.03, 6.08 and 10.09. The last amendment did not affect the results 
included in current application. 
Objectives 
Only objectives included in the provided interim report related to phase 2/3 are shown below. 
Primary safety:  
To define the safety profile of prophylactic BNT162b2 at the selected dose level in all participants 
randomized in Phase 2/3 in each age group. 
Primary immunogenicity: 
To immunobridge the immune response elicited by prophylactic BNT162b2 between Phase 2/3 
participants at the dose selected in participants 5 to <12 years of age and participants 16 to 25 years 
of age from the C4591001 study without serological or virological evidence (up to 1 month after 
receipt of Dose 2) of past SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Secondary immunogenicity:  
To describe the immune responses elicited by prophylactic BNT162b2 at the dose level selected in each 
age group and persistence of immune response in Phase 2/3 participants without serological or 
virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Exploratory:  
To describe COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 cases in participants in the selected-dose portion of the 
study with and without serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
To describe MIS-C cases with and without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection in participants in the 
selected-dose portion of the study. 
Vaccine efficacy 
If success criteria for immunobridging were successful, the secondary endpoints for estimation of 
vaccine efficacy (VE) against confirmed COVID-19 in Phase 2/3 participants were evaluated. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 20/21  
Confirmed COVID-19 incidence from 7 days after Dose 2 per 1000 person-years of follow-up in 
evaluable participants without and with or without serological or virological evidence (prior to 7 days 
after receipt of Dose 2) of past SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
Sample size 
A detailed sample size calculation was provided in the protocol for the Phase 2/3 selected-dose portion 
of the study, including power for immunobridging, VE and probabilities to observe AEs. 
The Phase 2/3 selected-dose portion of the study was planned to randomize approximately 4500 
participants (randomization ratio of 2:1 so that 3000 receive active vaccine and 1500 receive placebo) 
for the ≥5 to <12 years age group. For the lower-dose evaluation portion of the study, Phase 2/3 will 
include approximately 300 participants for each age group that will receive active vaccine at the 
selected dose level, with a total of approximately 900 participants. 
In Phase 2/3, primary immunobridging assessments had an immunobridging subset sample size of 225 
evaluable participants in Study C4591007 (5 to <12 years of age) and corresponding randomly 
selected comparator group in Study C4591001 (16 to 25 years of age), providing 90.4% and 92.6% 
power to declare immunobridging success based on GMR and seroresponse difference, respectively.  
The initial enrolment into the 5 to <12 years of age group included N~2250 (1500 active and 750 
placebo). 
An additional N~2250 participants 5 to <12 years of age were enrolled and also randomized 2:1 (1500 
active and 750 placebo) as a safety expansion group in the Phase 2/3 part of Study C4591007, to 
obtain a larger safety database to support a future application for licensure for this age group, and an 
additional 750 participants 5 to <12 years of age are being enrolled and randomized 2:1 (500 active 
and 250 placebo) to obtain serum samples for potential troponin I testing which may help characterize 
subclinical myocarditis.  
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Participants were randomized 2:1 active: placebo. Allocation (randomization) of participants to vaccine 
groups proceeded through the use of an IRT system (IWR). 
The study staff receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the study interventions 
were unblinded. All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and 
participants, were to be blinded to study intervention assignments. In particular, the individuals who 
evaluate participant safety were to be blinded. Because BNT162b2 and placebo are different in physical 
appearance, the study intervention syringes was to be administered in a manner that prevents the 
study participants from identifying the study intervention type based on its appearance.

Estimand 1: 
GMR (geometric mean ratio) of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titers in participants ≥5 to <12 years of 
age to those in the 16- to 25-year age group in Study C4591001 for participants without evidence of 
past SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Analysis set: Evaluable immunogenicity population, all-available immunogenicity population (as 
applicable). 
Analysis time point: 1 Month after Dose 2. 
Analysis methodology: The GMRs and associated 2-sided 95% CIs will be derived by calculating 
differences in means and CIs on the natural log scale of the titers based on the Student’s t-distribution 
and then exponentiating the results. The difference in means on the natural log scale will be the 
younger age group minus the group 16 to 25 years of age. Immunobridging success will be declared if 
the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMR is greater than 0.67 and the point estimate of the 
GMR is ≥0.8. 
Intercurrent events and missing data: Serology data deemed unevaluable because of noncompliance 
with the key protocol criteria will be excluded. Missing data will not be imputed. Only participants with 
no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection will be included. Participants’ data 
will be excluded from the time point that the participant has a positive NAAT or positive N-binding 
result.  
•• Reporting results: The GMRs and associated 2-sided 95% CIs will be provided.
Estimand 2: 
The difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse in participants ≥5 to <12 years of age 
and the 16- to 25-year age group in Study C4591001 for participants without evidence of past SARS-
CoV-2 infection 
Analysis set: Evaluable immunogenicity population, all-available immunogenicity population (as 
applicable). 
Analysis time point: 1 Month after Dose 2. 
Analysis methodology: The differences in percentages of participants with seroresponse will be 
provided along with associated 2-sided 95% CIs calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen2 
method. Immunobridging success based on the seroresponse difference will be declared for an age 
group if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CIs for the seroresponse difference is greater than -10%. 
Intercurrent events and missing data: Serology data deemed unevaluable because of noncompliance 
with the key protocol criteria will be excluded. Missing data will not be imputed. Only participants with 
no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection will be included. Participants’ data 
will be excluded from the time point that the participant has a positive NAAT or positive N-binding 
result. 
Reporting results: Counts, percentages of participants with seroresponse, the difference in 
percentages, and the associated 2-sided 95% CIs will be provided. 
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints were also defined in the SAP.

years of blinded follow-up in participants without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection (prior to 7
days after receipt of Dose 2) for the active vaccine group to the placebo group for the ≥5 to <12-year
age group and for the ≥6-month to <2-year and ≥2- to <5-year age groups combined, or across all
age groups (if the required number of cases is not accrued in either of 2 individual age groups).
2) 100 × (1 - IRR) [ratio of confirmed COVID-19 illness from 7 days after Dose 2 per 1000 person-
years of blinded follow-up in participants with or without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection (prior
to 7 days after receipt of Dose 2) for the active vaccine group to the placebo group for the ≥5 to <12-
year age group and for the ≥6-month to <2-year and ≥2- to <5-year age groups combined, or across
all age groups (if the required number of cases is not accrued in either of 2 individual age groups)].
Analysis set: Evaluable efficacy and all-available efficacy populations. 
Analysis time point: End of the surveillance period (blinded follow-up). 
Analysis methodology: Assessment of VE will be performed for confirmed COVID-19 illness  from 7 
days after Dose 2, and will be estimated by 100 × (1 – IRR), where IRR is the calculated ratio of 
confirmed COVID-19 illness per 1000 person-years of blinded follow-up in the active vaccine group to 
the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group. The hypothesis test for the VE objective will be 
performed if at least 22 cases are accrued at the time of analyses. 
The assessment of VE was to be based on testing the following hypothesis: H0: VE ≤ 30% vs H1: VE 
>30% for VE1 and VE2, respectively.
Intercurrent events and missing data: Missing data will not be imputed. 
Reporting results: VE and the associated 2-sided 95% CI derived using the Clopper-Pearson method 
adjusted for surveillance time will be provided for the corresponding age groups. 
Supplemental Analyses: The same assessment of VE and the associated 2-sided 95% CI derived using 
the Clopper-Pearson method adjusted for surveillance time for the corresponding age groups will be 
performed for confirmed COVID-19 illness based on CDC-defined symptoms.

Analysis sets 
Efficacy analyses were conducted on the evaluable efficacy population (participants who received both 
doses within the protocol defined window and had no important protocol deviations prior to 7 days 
post-Dose 2), and the all-available efficacy (modified intent-to-treat [mITT] populations (all 
participants who received vaccination). 
The VE analyses were conducted among those without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
among those with or without evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
VE estimation for confirmed COVID-19 uses the first definition (per protocol criteria). A supplemental 
analysis using the same assessment of VE and associated Clopper-Pearson 95% CI was performed for 
confirmed COVID-19 illness using the second definition (CDC criteria). 
The comparator group of participants 16-25 years, used for immunobridging analysis, consisted of a 
random set of participants from the study C4591001. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses of efficacy endpoints were planned to be conducted based on demographics (sex, 
race, and ethnicity), country, SARS-CoV-2 status (positive or negative), and risk status (comorbidities 
that increase the risk for severe COVID-19 illness, categorized based on medical history terms 
previously reported with safety analyses).

Multiplicity 
For the immunogenicity objectives of immunobridging of BNT162b2 in each of the 5 age groups (16 to 
<30 years, 12 to <16 years, ≥5 to <12 years [selected-dose and lower-dose evaluation participants], 
≥2 to <5 years, and ≥6 months to <2 years of age) to the comparator group from Phase 2/3 of the 
C4591001 study, the hypothesis testing for each age group will be carried out separately. Each 
immunobridging analysis corresponds to a separate analysis of the respective age group, with a 
separate objective. The age groups are included in the same study to improve operational efficiency. 
Therefore, no type I error adjustments were applied in the immunogenicity assessments for the 5 age 
groups. 
Within each age group, except for the ≥5 to <12-year age group, immunobridging based on GMR and 
seroresponse difference will be assessed sequentially in the order as specified. Within the ≥5 to <12-
year age group, immunobridging based on GMR and seroresponse difference will be first assessed 
sequentially in participants from the selected-dose portion of the study, and then assessed sequentially 
in participants from the lower-dose evaluation portion of the study. 
In each of the 2 age groups (≥5 to <12 years, ≥6 months to <2 years and ≥2 to <5 years combined) 
in the selected-dose portion of the study, where immunobridging success is declared, if the required 
number (21) of confirmed COVID-19 cases is accrued, then the secondary VE objectives, VE1 and VE2, 
will be tested sequentially in the order as stated for each age group. 
Thus, this sequential testing strategy controls type I error at the desired level of 2.5% within each age 
group. Efficacy objectives for each of the 2 age groups will be assessed separately. No type I error 
adjustments will be applied in the efficacy assessments for the 2 age groups for the same reason 
described above for immunogenicity assessments. However, if the required number (21) of confirmed 
COVID-19 cases is not accrued in either of the 2 age groups where immunobridging success is 
declared, but 21 cases are accrued across all the age groups where immunobridging success is 
declared, then hypothesis testing will be conducted across the age groups with immunobridging 
success. 
The submitted analysis was performed after 19 cases were accrued. 
Immunogenicity Results 
Participant flow 
Immunogenicity Populations 
The Phase 2/3 evaluable immunogenicity population for participants 5 to <12 years of age included 
294 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 147 participants in the placebo group, and for Study 
C4591001 participants 16 to 25 years of age included 273 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 
47 participants in the placebo group. Exclusions from the evaluable immunogenicity population were 
generally balanced across vaccine groups, and the most common reason for exclusion was participants 
not having at least 1 valid and determinate immunogenicity result within 28-42 days after Dose 2. 
Disposition 
The disposition of Phase 2/3 pediatric participants 5 to <12 years of age in the immunobridging subset 
through 1 month after Dose 2 was similar to that of all randomized participants for the BNT162b2 and 
placebo groups. Most participants across both groups completed the visit at 1 month after Dose 2 
(≥97.7%). There were no meaningful differences in the discontinuation or withdrawal categories in this 
subset. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 25/26  
Within the immunobridging subset, most participants randomized in both age groups (≥99.1%) 
received Dose 1 and Dose 2. Most participants across age groups completed the visit at 1 month after 
Dose 2 (≥97.7%).

Outcomes and estimation 
Geometric Mean Ratio (GMR) of Neutralizing Titers 
Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, the 
ratio of the SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMT in children 5 to <12 years of age (who received the 
10-µg dose level) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age (who received the 30-µg dose level)
was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18) (Table 4).
The lower bound of the 2 sided 95% CI for GMR was >0.67 and the GMR point estimate was ≥0.8, 
which meets the prespecified 1.5-fold margin and success criteria. Therefore, immunobridging based 
on GMR was achieved. Note that the observed GMR point estimate meets the requested criterion from 
the FDA of ≥1.

Difference in Seroresponse Rate 
Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, high 
and equal proportions (99.2% each of children 5 to <12 years of age and young adults 16 to 25 years 
of age) achieved a seroresponse from before vaccination to 1 month after Dose 2. The difference in the 
proportions of participants who had seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adults) 
was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 2.2%) (Table 5). 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation

Since immunobridging based on GMR was achieved, hypothesis of immunobridging based on 
seroresponse rate was tested subsequently. The lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in 
seroresponse rate was -2.0%, which is greater than the prespecified margin of -10%. Therefore, 
immunobridging based on seroresponse rate was achieved.

Subgroup Analysis 
SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing titers (GMTs) were evaluated by demographic and baseline SARS-CoV-2 
status subgroups. Subgroups of paediatric participants 5 to <12 years of age and young adults 16 to 
25 years of age (with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2) 
had similar patterns of GMTs at before vaccination and 1 month after Dose 2 across the BNT162b2 and 
placebo groups when evaluated by sex, race, and ethnicity.  
Several subgroups included a limited number of participants, and their results should be interpreted 
with caution. There were no meaningful differences in the neutralizing titers on the basis of 
demographic subgroups within each age group, or between the age groups. Participants who were 
SARS-CoV-2 baseline status positive had higher GMTs at both before vaccination and 1 month after 
Dose 2 compared to those negative at baseline, in both age groups.  
Ancillary analyses 
The MAH submitted later on also a separate report (dated 15.10.2021) which provides supportive 
immunogenicity data to 1 month after Dose 2 from a random  subset of N~40 Study C4591007 Phase 
2/3 participants 5 to <12 years of age (35 active and 5 placebo) who were included in the successful 
immunobridging analyses. These supportive immunogenicity data are SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing 
titers against USA-WA1/2020 (reference) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant strains.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 28/29  
 
Endpoints 
A 50% plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) was used to determine SARS-CoV-2 serum 
neutralizing titers as described previously. The PRNT is distinct from the validated SARS-CoV-2 
neutralization assay used to determine titers for immunobridging analyses that were previously 
submitted. 
PRNT titers were assessed in sera before vaccination and 1 month after BNT162b2 Dose 2. PRNT titers 
were determined against the designated wild-type reference strain, recombinant USA-WA1/2020 
(clinical strain isolated in January 2020), and against B.1.617.2 (Delta), using a recombinant virus with 
the Delta variant full spike gene on the genetic background of USA-WA1/2020. Samples were tested at 
the same time for comparability. 
Disposition and Datasets Analysed 
PRNT titers were obtained from 38 children 5 to <12 years of age randomly selected from the evaluable 
immunogenicity population (N=34 BNT162b2 and N=4 placebo). 
The majority of participants were White (84.2%) with 7.9% Black or African American, 5.3% Asian, 
with and 2.6% multiracial participants. Hispanic/Latino participants made up 15.8% of the population. 
The median age of participants was 8.0 years of age, and 50.0% of participants were male. One 
participant, in the BNT162b2 group (2.9%), was obese. 
SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Response 
 Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) 
SARS-CoV-2 PRNT GMTs substantially increased for both the reference and Delta strains after two 
doses of 10 µg BNT162b2 (Table 6). 
At 1 month after Dose 2, the GMR of the PRNT titers against the Delta variant strain to PRNT titers 
against the reference strain was 0.81 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.65, 1.00).

Efficacy results 
Participant flow 
Among randomized participants, the Phase 2/3 evaluable efficacy population for children 5 to <12 
years of age included 1450 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 736 participants in the placebo 
group (Table 7), which reflects the 2:1 randomization. Exclusions from the evaluable efficacy 
population occurred for 5.1% of the BNT162b2 group and 2.8% of the placebo group, due to receipt of 
Dose 2 outside the protocol defined window of 19-42 days after Dose 1 (2.0% in BNT162b2 and 2.4% 
in placebo) or due to other important protocol deviations on or prior to 7 days after Dose 2 (3.1% in 
BNT162b2 and 0.5% in placebo), being primarily related to vaccine thawing, dilution, and/or 
administration issues that are not applicable to placebo.

Baseline data 
The demographics of Phase 2/3 paediatric participants 5 to <12 years of age were similar in the 
evaluable efficacy population of participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as  in 
the safety population for the BNT162b2 and placebo groups (see table below). 
In the evaluable efficacy population of participants with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection prior to 7 days after Dose 2, baseline positive status for prior evidence of SARS-COV-2 
infection was reported for 8.7% of the BNT162b2 group and 8.4% of the placebo group. 
The overall demographics of Phase 2/3 paediatric participants 5 to <12 years of age were similar 
for the BNT162b2 and placebo groups in the evaluable efficacy population of participants with or 
without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to 7 days after Dose 2, and in the  all-
available (mITT) efficacy populations.

Confirmed COVID-19 per Protocol Criteria (First Definition) 
The observed VE from at least 7 days after Dose 2 for BNT162b2 10 µg administered to children   5 to 
<12 years of age without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during the vaccination 
regimen, per protocol case criteria was 90.7% (2-sided 95% CI: 67.7%, 98.3%) based on 3 cases in 
the BNT162b2 group and 16 cases in the placebo group after adjusted for surveillance time ((noting the 
2:1 randomization of vaccine: placebo (Table 9)). 
No cases of COVID-19 were observed in either the vaccine group or the placebo group in participants 
with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, the observed VE from at least 7 days after Dose 2 
in evaluable participants in this age group with or without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
before or during the vaccination regimen was essentially the         same: 90.7% (2-sided 95% CI: 67.4%, 
98.3%) based on the same number of observed cases (3 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 16 cases in 
the placebo group). 
The earliest reported and confirmed COVID-19 case in this analysis was in July 2021, with most 
cases occurring in August and September 2021.

Dose 1 All-Available Efficacy Population 
The observed VE for BNT162b2 10 µg against any confirmed COVID-19  from Dose 1 onwards 
in the Dose 1 all-available (mITT) population (i.e., all randomized participants who received 
at least 1 dose of vaccination) of children 5 to <12 years of age was 91.4% (2-sided 95% CI: 
70.4%, 98.4%) based on 3 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 17 cases in the placebo group 
(noting the 2:1 randomization of vaccine: placebo), as of the data cut-off date (08 October 
2021) (Table 10). 
From Dose 1 to before receipt of Dose 2, the observed VE was 100%, noting that only 1 case  
was reported in the placebo group and none in the BNT162b2 group during this interval. 
No cases were reported from Dose 2 up to <7 days post-Dose 2. Starting from ≥7 days 
after Dose 2, the observed VE was 90.9% (2-sided 95% CI: 68.3%, 98.3%) based on 
accrual of all 3 cases reported in the BNT162b2 group and the remaining 16 cases in the 
placebo group. 
The Kaplan-Meier curve in 2 shows that cases accrued steadily in the placebo group, starting at 
approximately 3 weeks after the first dose and continuing to increase up to the data cut-off date 
(which represents approximately 4 months since Dose 1). In contrast, the 3 cases reported in 
the BNT162b2 group occurred at disparate and later times, with 1 case each reported at 
approximately 1.5 months, 3.5 months, and 4 months after Dose 1.  
All 3 cases in the BNT162b2 group occurred ≥7 days after Dose 2, noting that 2/3 cases 
occurred at distant time points post-Dose 2, during a period in Fall 2021 when children in this 
age group were back in school and/or other related congregant settings (e.g., sports teams, 
after school activities, etc.). None of the cases reported in the BNT162b2 group occurred in 
children with high-risk comorbidities.

Vaccine Efficacy Subgroup Analyses 
Vaccine efficacy was evaluated for subgroups of participants by sex, race, ethnicity, country, and 
at-risk status among participants without evidence of prior infection before and during the 
vaccination regimen. At-risk participants were those with at least one specified comorbidity or who 
were obese. Subgroup analyses were based on per protocol case criteria. 
All subgroups had observed VE >85%, taking into account that some subgroups contain very few 
participants with evaluable cases and the 2-sided 95% CIs were wide, limiting the precision of 
these estimates, and should be interpreted with caution. These data, nevertheless, do not provide 
evidence to suggest that any subgroup is disadvantaged with regard to efficacy based on 
demographics (sex, race, ethnicity), country (noting that cases were reported only in Spain and 
the US), and presence of baseline comorbidities. None of the cases in the BNT162b2 group 
occurred in children with reported baseline comorbidities. 
The observed VE results by subgroup were similar for participants with or without evidence of 
prior infection before and during the vaccination regimen. All participants with confirmed cases in 
this analysis had baseline negative status for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Results for the all-available efficacy populations were similar; with no clinically meaningful 
differences observed in VE on the basis of subgroups of these populations. 
Signs and Symptoms of COVID-19 – Phase 2/3 
In the evaluable efficacy population, confirmed cases occurring at least 7 days after Dose 2 
among  participants  in  the  evaluable  efficacy  population  without evidence  of  SARS -CoV-2 
infection before or during the vaccination regimen had signs and symptoms associated with 
3 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 16 cases in the placebo group.  
In  the  BNT162b2  group,  1  participant  each  (33.3%)  with  a  confirmed  COVID-19  case 
reported 2, 3, or 4 signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Fever was not reported in the children 
with confirmed COVID-19 who received BNT162b2.  
In the placebo group, the majority of participants (56.2%) with a confirmed COVID-19 case 
reported 4 or more signs and symptoms of COVID-19, including 8 participants each (50.0%) 
with 5 or more symptoms. 
Efficacy Against Severe COVID-19 and MIS-C – Phase 2/3 
No severe COVID-19 cases (per protocol definition or per CDC definition) were reported in 
children 5 to <12 years of age as of the data cut-off date (08 October 2021). No cases of MIS-C 
(per CDC definition) were reported as of the data cut-off date.

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is based on part of the ongoing paediatric phase 1/2/3 study C4591007 including 
children aged 5 to <12years. Overall, the study is in agreement with the approved PIP. 
Based upon review of safety and immunogenicity results from the Phase 1 portion of the study, the 
BNT162b2 dose level selected for further evaluation in Phase 2/3 was 10 µg for the 5 to <12 years age 
group. The selected dose is agreed based on the antibody response and safety results.  
In Phase 2/3, the efficacy of BNT162b2 was established by immunobridging of the SARS-CoV-2 
neutralizing antibody response in paediatric participants aged 5 to <12 years of age group in Study 
C4591007 to the response in young adult participants 16 to 25 years of age in Phase 2/3 efficacy study 
C4591001. This is the same approach which was used for the extension of the indication to for 12-15 
year olds (type II variation II30).  
A difference in this procedure, is a larger sample size and that the younger age group (5 to<12 years 
old) received a lower dose of vaccine. The design of the immunobridging exercise is endorsed and the 
use of the historical controls (16-25 years old) from study C4591001 are acceptable as these serology 
samples were analysed side by side with samples from 5 to<12 years old. The time shift between 
receipt of vaccine for study arms is expected to have no impact for immunogenicity. 
The Phase 2/3 evaluable immunogenicity population for participants 5 to <12 years of age included 
294 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 147 participants in the placebo group, and for Study 
C4591001 participants 16 to 25 years of age included 273 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 
47 participants in the placebo group. This part of the study was designed and powered for 
immunogenicity comparison between children 5 to 12 year and young adults (16-25 years). Children

with comorbidities, with a history of prior SARS-COV2-infection or with HIV were not excluded. A 
supplemental descriptive analysis of vaccine efficacy among cohort 1 of study C4591007 was also 
provided. 
The MAH also submitted supportive immunogenicity data for SARS-CoV-2 serum neutralizing titers 
against USA-WA1/2020 (reference) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant strains for 40 participants (35 in 
active and 5 in placebo arm). The sample size in this supportive analysis was small and the Delta 
neutralization assay not yet validated, therefore these data are considered supportive, but important in 
light of the Delta variant epidemiology. 
Assessment of VE was to be performed for confirmed COVID-19 illness from 7 days after Dose 2. A 
supportive vaccine efficacy analysis was planned to be conducted when at least 22 confirmed cases of 
COVID-19 had accrued in the 5 to <12 years of age group and if success criteria for immunobridging in 
this age group had first been met. The statistical methods for calculating Vaccine Efficacy are 
considered appropriate. An efficacy analysis was submitted during the assessment (dated 18.10.2021). 
The efficacy analysis was based on confirmed cases among the initially enrolled N~2250 participants in 
the 5 to <12 years of age group of Study C4591007.  
Among randomized participants, 1450 participants were included in the BNT162b2 group and 736 
participants in the placebo group. This part of the study was designed and powered for vaccine efficacy 
evaluation between active and placebo arm. The design and study protocol for the vaccine efficacy part 
is endorsed. The analysis was performed before the pre-defined number of cases had been accrued, at 
19 cases instead of 21. The MAH was asked to clarify this and has answered that the earlier than 
planned VE analysis was done due to a FDA request. Amended study protocols, and an amended 
analysis plan, have also been submitted. Analyses for the different age groups are performed and 
submitted when available. Also, updated efficacy analyses will be performed at end of the blinded 
follow-up period. As the presented data are preliminary, the final report with final analysis was 
requested when available and the MAH provided the requested timeline for the study report, as a SOB 
due July 2024. 
The blinding procedure appears appropriate. However, due to reactogenicity it seems likely that some 
of the study subjects and/or their guardians, may have guessed their treatment allocation. This is 
unlikely to impact immunogenicity or efficacy conclusions.  
No type I error control is applied between age groups. This is accepted since the age groups were 
included in the same study to improve operational efficiency. However, it should be noted that the 
hypotheses are not independent, and inconsistent results may affect the interpretation of the efficacy 
in other age groups. Within age groups immunobridging analyses are performed sequentially. If these 
were successful, secondary endpoints of vaccine efficacy were to be tested sequentially. The sequential 
multiple testing procedure is appropriate. In summary the statistical methods used are considered 
appropriate. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
There is currently no serological correlate of protection for COVID-19. However, the proposed 
mechanism of action for this vaccine, i.e. that neutralising antibodies are crucial for protection makes 
immunobridging to a population where efficacy has been demonstrated a reasonable strategy for 
ensuring efficacy in adolescents. Generally, children and adolescents have higher immune responses to 
vaccination compared to adults, which was shown to be the case also for this Covid-19 vaccine in the 
previous evaluation between 12-15- and 16–26-year-olds. In the current application, where children 
between ages 5 to 12 received a lower dose of Comirnaty (10 µg), the neutralizing antibody titer was 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 38/39  
non-inferior to the antibody titers among young adults 16-25 years old, who received standard 30 µg 
dose.  
Immunobridging 
Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, the 
ratio of the SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMT in children 5 to <12 years of age (who received the 
10-µg dose level) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age (who received the 30-µg dose level) 
was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). The lower bound of the 2 sided 95% CI for GMR was >0.67 
and the GMR point estimate was ≥0.8, which meets the prespecified 1.5-fold margin and success 
criteria. Therefore, immunobridging based on GMR was achieved. 
Interestingly, the GMTs from age group 16-25 years were reported as lower in  the immunobridging 
exercise  with 12-15 year-olds compared to what is now reported for the same procedure with 5-11 
year-olds. As the baseline characteristics and assay should be identical for this age group, the 
clarification for this discrepancy was requested. The MAH responded that the randomly selected 
individuals in control group were not the same in 6-12 and 5-11 years old applications and also the 
different batches of assay reagent virus were used. 
There was a similar magnitude of rise in the paediatric 5 to <12 years of age group (118.2) compared 
to the young adult 16 to 25 years of age group (111.4) for BNT162b2 group. High neutralizing titers 
were elicited to both the USA-WA1/2020 (reference) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) recombinant SARS-CoV-2 
strains at 1 month after Dose 2. 
High and equal proportions (99.2% each of children 5 to <12 years of age and young adults 16 to 25 
years of age) of participants achieved a seroresponse. The difference in the proportions of participants 
who had seroresponse between the two age groups (children – young adults) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% 
CI: -2.0%, 2.2%). The lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in seroresponse rate was -2.0%, 
which is greater than the prespecified margin of -10%. Therefore, immunobridging based on 
seroresponse rate was achieved. Subgroup analyses by demographic, baseline SARS-CoV-2 and 
obesity status did not show any meaningful differences in neutralizing immune response and 
seroresponse rate in the 5 to < 12 years group and 16-25 years group. 
In the light of the above, it can be concluded that neutralizing antibody responses in children 5-11 
years and in young adults are comparable. 
Efficacy 
Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during the vaccination 
regimen, the observed VE for BNT162b2 10 µg against any confirmed COVID-19  from at least 7 days 
after Dose 2 was 90.7% (2-sided 95% CI: 67.7%, 98.3%) which included 3 cases in the BNT162b2 
group and 16 cases in the placebo group. There were no cases among baseline SARS-CoV-2 positives. 
All cases occurred in children without prior history of infection. No virus sequence analyses to 
determine whether these cases were due to Delta variant was available at the time of submission. 
However, based on supportive analysis of Delta neutralizing immune responses from a subset of 
vaccinated/placebo sera from children 5-11 years, which showed significant neutralizing titers against 
the Delta variant, it can be inferred that vaccination with BNT162b2 10 μg in children 5-11 years is 
effective against Delta variant. Confirmatory case sequencing data for COVID-19 cases will be reported 
at a later time, when the sequencing analysis is completed.  
The same vaccine efficacy (90.7% (CI95% 67.4, 98.3) was observed in children 5-11 years with or 
without evidence of infection prior to 7 days post-dose 2. Comorbidities present at baseline that 
increase the risk of severe COVID-19 disease (including obesity, asthma, diabetes mellitus) were 
present in 20.6% of participants. However, some subgroups contain very few participants. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 39/40  
 
 
 
The VE analyses were to be performed when at least 22 cases were accrued. It was however not clear 
from the interim report what the number of cases were at the cut-off date. In the efficacy analyses 19 
cases are included, and 21 cases were included in the analyses using CDC defined symptoms. The MAH 
was asked to clarify. The MAH has responded that the earlier analysis was done due to the request 
from FDA. 
For COVID-19 cases confirmed from Dose 1 onwards in the Dose 1 all-available (mITT) population, the 
observed VE for BNT162b2 10 µg was 91.4% (2-sided 95% CI: 70.4, 98.4%) based on 3 cases in the 
BNT162b2 group and 17 cases in the placebo group. However, the observed VE in the relevant interval 
starting from 11 days post-dose 1 to before dose 2 was not provided, whereas it was available for 
adolescents 12-15 years. 
All subgroups had observed VE >85%, though these results should be interpreted with caution as 
some subgroups contain very few participants. 
No severe COVID-19 cases or MIS-C were reported in the 5 to <12 years of age group, per 
protocol definition or per CDC definition. 
Overall, BNT162b2 administered as a primary series of two doses of 10 µg given 3 weeks apart  to 
children 5 to <12 years of age is protective against symptomatic COVID-19. The efficacy against 
symptomatic  COVID-19  was  demonstrated  in  the  age  group  5  to  12  years.  The  effect  size  was 
similar to that seen in adults overall. As it might be anticipated, no severe cases occurred in the 
study. As the study is still ongoing, the MAH is requested to submit the final results of the study 
when available.  
Specific risk groups among children, including those immunosuppressed, or otherwise with risk of more 
severe disease, were not specifically studied. A study in immunocompromised children (IC) is included 
in the PIP. The MAH was asked to consider whether a third dose in the primary series is relevant for 
children with substantial immunosuppression, as has been agreed previously for adolescents and 
adults. The MAH responded that so far there is no information about the relevance of the third dose 
among IC children, but the study is ongoing with expected report timeline for end of 2022. The CHMP 
understands the MAH position, but as extrapolated data from adults was used also in age group 12-18, 
the SmPC should follow the same orientation as for adolescents. 
It is currently unknown if vaccination provides protection against asymptomatic infection, and to what 
extent vaccination prevents further transmission. The efficacy against transmission would be of great 
interest to predict the impact of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 circulation, particularly among the 
paediatric population. 
The duration of protection is unknown in children and adolescents, as well as among adults. 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The immunobridging results clearly demonstrate that 10 µg BNT162b2 given to children 5-11 years of 
age resulted in very similar neutralising antibody responses (GMTs, GMFR and seroresponses) 
compared to the efficacy population; that is, 16-25 year old subjects receiving 30 µg BNT162b2. Thus, 
efficacy may be inferred based on immunobridging.  
This is supported by clinical efficacy data. The efficacy of the BNT162b2 (2 doses 10 µg, separated by 
21 days) to prevent COVID-19 in children aged 5-11 years either with and without evidence of prior 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, occurring at least 7 days after the second dose was considered well-established. 
No severe cases were reported in children aged 5-11 years. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 40/41  
Taken together, efficacy and immunogenicity data support the use in children aged 5-11 years. 
Efficacy on asymptomatic infection was however not assessed. These data would be of great interest to 
understand the indirect impact of children vaccination to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional MA: 
Description 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of 
Comirnaty, the MAH should submit the final 
Clinical Study Report for the randomized, 
placebo-controlled, observer-blind study 
C4591007.  
Due Date 
July 2024 
2.6.4.  Clinical safety 
Study C4591007 is an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1/2/3 paediatric study in 
healthy children from 6 months to <12 years of age. Phase 1 was conducted in the US and the Phase 
2/3 is being conducted at sites in the US, Finland, Poland, and Spain (still ongoing).  
Local and systemic reactions were registered up to 7 days after each dose by using an E-diary. 
Adverse events (AEs) are collected from Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2 and serious AEs (SAEs)are 
collected from Dose 1 to 6 months after Dose 2. Deaths are recorded to the end of study. 
This interim report includes only study objectives, analyses, and data for children 5 to <12 years of 
age, as follows: 
•  C4591007 Phase 1 dose-finding among BNT162b2 dose levels of 10, 20, and 30 µg (N=16 per 
group), including data for safety and tolerability up to 1 month after Dose 2 and 
immunogenicity at 7 days after Dose 2. 
•  C4591007 Phase 2/3 at the selected dose of BNT162b2 10 µg (N ~2250, randomized 2:1 
BNT162b2 10 µg: placebo), including data for safety and tolerability up to 2 months after Dose 
2, immunobridging analyses at 1 month after Dose 2. The initial cut-off date was 6 September 
2021, however, additional data allowing for longer follow-up time of AEs, SAEs and death has 
been provided with the cut-off date of 08 October 2021. The participants are referred to “initial 
group”. 
•  Additional supportive safety data for newly recruited N~2250 Phase 2/3 C4591007 paediatric 
participants 5 to <12 years who began enrolment in August 2021 in US only. The subjects 
were randomized 2:1 (BNT162b2 10 µg: placebo). Data cut-off is 08 October 2021, which 
represents at least 1 week of follow-up after Dose 2 for 98.5% of the participants and at least 
2 weeks of follow-up after Dose 2 for most (>70%) participant. No reactogenicity data is 
available from these subjects. The participants are referred to “expansion group”. 
Sponsor and site personnel responsible for the ongoing conduct of Study C4591007 remain blinded to 
individual participants’ randomization. A participant in the 5 to <12 years of age group of C4591007 
could be unblinded to treatment assignment per protocol, if he or she turned 12 years of age and 
became eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine available under CMA in their country/region. Unblinded 
recipients originally randomized to placebo will be offered BNT162b2 vaccination and thereafter 
followed in an open-label manner.

2.6.4.1.  Patient exposure 
2.6.4.1.1.  Phase 1 (data cut-off date: 16 July 2021) 
In the Phase 1 study the protocol-defined age groups were studied separately, this application 
describes data concerning 5 to <12 years of age only. The study population includes male and female 
participants deemed healthy as determined by medical history, physical examination, and clinical 
judgment of the investigator to be eligible for inclusion in the study. Exclusions included screened 
individuals with clinically important prior medical or psychiatric illness or laboratory abnormalities, past 
diagnosis of MIS-C, serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or current SARS-CoV-2 infection 
as measured by PCR. Local reactions, systemic events, and antipyretic medication use was registered 
by participants/guardians in an e-diary for the 7 following days after each dose administration. Safety 
assessments in Phase 1 were to support dose level selection to proceed to Phase 2/3 evaluation. 
A total of 48 participants were included in the 10-μg, 20-μg, and 30 µg dose level groups (N=16 each) 
and received 2 doses of BNT162b2 and completed the 1-month post-Dose 2 visit. No participants were 
withdrawn from the study. Due to observed reactogenicity after dose 2 in the initial 4/16 participants 
of the 30-µg group the remaining 12 participants instead received 10 µg at Dose 2, and the 30-μg 
dose level was discontinued in the study. 
2.6.4.1.2.  Phase 2/3 Initial Group 
In total, 2,285 subjects were randomized 2:1 (n=1,528 BNT162b 10 µg; n=757 placebo). Most 
participants in either group (≥98.7%) received Dose 1 and Dose 2.  
Two participants (0.1%) in the BNT162b2 group and 2 participants (0.3%) in the placebo group 
discontinued from the vaccination period and were continuing in the study for safety follow-up. None of 
the discontinuations were reported as due to an AE. The safety population reflected the 2:1 
randomization in the BNT162b2 (N=1,518) and placebo (N=750) groups. Exclusions from the safety 
population were due to 17 participants (0.7%) not receiving study vaccine.

Demographics 
Demographic characteristics for the Phase 2/3 safety expansion group of children 5 to <12 years of 
age were similar in BNT162b2 and placebo groups (Table 17 below). The demographics for the safety 
expansion group are similar to the demographics for the initial safety group.

2.6.4.2.  Adverse events 
2.6.4.2.1.  Phase 1 
All local reactions were mild or moderate in severity and short-lived, except for 1 severe event of 
redness after Dose 2 in the 30/30-μg dose regimen (Figure 2). Systemic events were mostly mild to 
moderate and short-lived. Overall, reactogenicity tended to increase in a dose level- and dose number-
dependent manner regarding incidence and/or severity of local reactions. Four participants received 
both 30 µg doses, they developed fever up to 38.9 °C and fatigue after Dose 2. Headache was mild to 
moderate in 3/4 participants after Dose 1 and Dose 2. This systemic event profile in these first 4 
participants contributed to the IRC decision to discontinue the 30-μg dose level. 
As illustrated in figure 2 and 3 below a dose dependent increase of local and systemic reactions was 
noted in the Phase 1 study, where 10 ug appears to be less reactogenic. It was therefore decided to 
continue with a dose of 10 µg for the Phase 2/3 study.

Dose – Phase 1 – 5 to<12 Years of Age – Safety Population 
Adverse Events 
From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, AEs were reported by 7 participants (43.8%) who received 
BNT162b2 at 10 µg and 5 participants (31.3%) who received 20 µg. Of these, the AEs were considered 
related to study intervention for 4 (25.0%) and 2 (12.5%) participants in the 10 µg and 20 µg dose 
groups, respectively. In 4/16 participants who received both doses in the 30 µg group as assigned, AEs 
were reported by 2 participants with both considered by the investigator as related to study 
intervention (lymphadenopathy and arthralgia, n=1 each). No SAEs, deaths, or AEs leading to 
withdrawal were reported. 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 48/49  
Systemic Reactions 
Most systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. Across groups, median onset after receiving 
BNT162b2 was 1 to 4 days after Dose 1 or Dose 2 (most had a median of 2 days post-dose) and all 
events resolved with a median duration of 1 day. None of the participants reported systemic events 
Grade 4. 
One participant, in the BNT162b2 group, reported fever of 40.0°C 2 days after Dose 2 which returned 
to normal (36.7°C) the next day, no concurrent AEs reported at this time or during the study.  
Overall, the pattern of systemic events reported in children 5 to <12 years of age after each dose was 
generally comparable to, or less than, that observed in prior analyses of Phase 2/3 adolescents or 
adult participants. 
In the BNT162b2 group the use of antipyretic/pain medication was slightly higher after Dose 2 
compared to after Dose 1 (Dose 1 [14.4%]; Dose 2 [19.7%]). Use of antipyretic/pain medication was 
less frequent in the placebo group than in the BNT162b2 group and similar after both Doses (8.3% and 
8.1%).

Adverse Events Phase 2/3 (Initial Group) 
From Dose 1 to the current cut-off date (08 October 2021), the proportions of participants with any AE 
were similar in the BNT162b2 (13.0%) and placebo (11.1%) groups.

Table 19. Number (%) of Participants Reporting at Least 1 Adverse Event From Dose 1 Through Cutoff 
Date (08 Oct 2021) – Phase 2/3 Initial Enrollment Group – 5 to <12 Years of Age – Safety Population 
The number of subjects reporting at least one AE are described in table 20 below by SOCs. Please note 
that the cut-off date for this table is 6 September 2021. After the initial cut-off and up to 8 October 
2021, new AEs were reported by 23 (1.5%) participants in the BNT162b2 group and 10 (1.3%) 
participants in the placebo group. All newly reported AEs from 2 months post-Dose 2 up to the present 
3 months post-Dose 2 were non-serious, unrelated to study intervention, and mild to moderate at 
intensity. These newly reported AEs primarily included events consistent with mild common infections 
(e.g., sore throat, cough, rhinitis, enterovirus, pyrexia, fatigue) and limb fractures, which could be 
expected and commonly reported in the general pediatric population. No new AEs were reported that 
correspond to AESIs, no cases of myocarditis were reported. Overall, the additional follow-up to 
approximately 3 months post-Dose 2 for this initial enrolment group showed no clinically important 
change to the AE profile reported at the initial cut-off (6 September 2021).

Many of the AEs reflected the reactogenicity events that were reported as AEs (ie, headache, vomiting, 
and injection site pain). Overall, several of the other commonly reported AEs are consistent with 
events that would be expected in a general population of healthy children in this age group and/or 
showed no imbalance between the vaccine and placebo groups. The most reported SOCs were: 
Infections and infestations 1.9% vs 2.0%. The events reported in this SOC are common types of 
infections for this age group, including ear infections, conjunctivitis, and terms consistent with common 
colds and infections.  
Gastrointestinal disorders 1.6% vs 1.7%. The events reported in this SOC are common types of 
disorders for this age group, including ear infections, conjunctivitis, and terms consistent with common 
colds and infections. 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications 1.7% vs 0.7%. The overall numerical difference 
between BNT162b2 and placebo groups is primarily due to unrelated events of insect bites, sunburns, 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 54/55  
and a variety of concurrent events (i.e., fall and contusion) reported in a limited number of participants 
in the BNT162b2 group, which is a larger group of participants due to the 2:1 randomization. 
Skin and subcutaneous disorders 1.4% vs 0.8%, the difference reflects reactogenicity evens in the 
vaccinated subjects. 
Overall, a similar AE profiles was noted from Dose 1 up to cut-off with regard to most frequently 
reported events by SOC and PT across the BNT162b2 and placebo groups when evaluated by sex, race, 
ethnicity, and baseline SARS-CoV-2 status. 
Related Adverse Events 
Most of the AEs that were considered related to study drug by the investigator were reactogenicity 
events and in the SOC of general disorders and administration site conditions (1.1% vs 0.9%). 
•
•
•
From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, AEs assessed as related by the investigator were
reported at a slightly higher frequency in the BNT162b2 group (3.0%) than in the placebo
group (2.1%).
Non-serious, non-severe, related events of lymphadenopathy were reported in 0.7% of
participants in the BNT162b2 group and none in the placebo group. All cases were considered
mild.
Non-serious related events of rash, urticaria, and other skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders
(0.4% vs 0.5%).
• One non-serious, non-severe event of angina pectoris considered by the investigator as related
to study intervention was reported by a participant in the BNT162b2 group. This event lasted 1
minute, with an onset of 2 days after Dose 2, and resolved with no sequalae or further
investigation deemed warranted by the investigator.
• One related non-serious, psychiatric disorder event of tic Grade 3 was reported in a participant
in the BNT162b2 group. The onset was 7 days after dose 2 and resolved at the time of cut-off.
The AE was considered related to study intervention by the investigator, the neurologist that
examined the patient later determined the event as unrelated and recommended lifestyle
change.
Immediate Adverse Events 
After Dose 1, immediate AEs (reported within 30 minutes of the first vaccination) were low in 
frequency (≤0.4%) in both groups, predominantly injection site pain (3 vs 2 subjects). No other 
immediate AEs post-Dose 1 were reported in the BNT162b2 group.  
After Dose 2, immediate AEs (reported within 30 minutes of the second vaccination) were low in 
frequency (0.3%) in both groups, predominantly injection site pain, (1 vs 2 subjects). Injection site 
erythema, erythema and nausea were reported in 1 subject each in the BNT162b2 group. 
Severe or Life-Threatening and Serious Adverse Events  
From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, severe AEs were low in frequency (0.1%) in both groups. 
From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, severe AEs (i.e., Grade 3) were low in both arms (3 vs 1). Three 
severe AEs in the BNT162b arm (tic, upper limb fracture fracture and rash) were reported up to the 
cut-off 8 October 2021. No participants reported any life-threatening (i.e., Grade 4) AEs.

Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
Adverse events of specific clinical interest, such as those in the CDC list of AESIs for COVID -19, 
were reviewed. Information on events of clinical interest included terms requested by the FDA: 
anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell’s palsy, and lymphadenopathy. The protocol defined AESI of 
myocarditis/pericarditis was also considered in the safety review. Among the FDA-requested AEs of 
clinical interest, no cases were reported in the 5 to <12 years of age group up to the data cut-off 
date of anaphylaxis, myocarditis/pericarditis, Bell’s palsy (or facial paralysis/paresis), or appendicitis. 
No cases of anaphylaxis or anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction were reported in the study and no 
cases of hypersensitivity were reported in the BNT162b2 group. 
Eighteen participants (1.2%) in the BNT162b2 group and 6 participants (0.8%) in the placebo group 
had events in angioedema/hypersensitivity SMQs. Events in the SMQ of angioedema reported in the 
BNT162b2 group included face swelling (caused by an insect bite and considered by the investigator 
as not related to study intervention) (n=1) and urticaria (n=3). Urticaria was also reported in the 
placebo group (n=3). Events in the SMQ of hypersensitivity more commonly reported in the 
BNT162b2 group than the placebo group were dermatitis (including contact and allergic dermatitis, 
n=5 vs 0) of which all cases were deemed as not related to vaccine; and rash (including pruritic, 
macular, injection site rash, n=8 vs n=1). Of the rashes in the BNT162b2 group, 4 were considered 
by the investigator as related to study intervention: all Grade 1, typically with an onset of 7 days or 
more post-vaccination; only 1 injection site rash was reported with earlier onset at 3 days post-Dose 
2. All but 1 event (rash on torso with onset at 11 days post-Dose 2) were reported as resolved. 
These related rashes were observed on the arm, torso, face and/or body with no clear pattern, and 
2 participants had other skin reactions in the same anatomical location a short time before or after 
the reported SMQ event (i.e., prior erythema reaction to medical dressing patch on arm, or 
subsequent rash on face due to insect sting). One case in each group of allergic conjunctivitis and 
eczema were also reported. All angioedema/hypersensitivity SMQ events were mild or moderate, 
with the exception of 1 participant in the BNT162b2 group who had a Grade 3 rash (reaction to 
topical cosmetic cream). Rash is considered an adverse reaction to vaccine and is noted as such in 
the current product labelling. 
Lymphadenopathy is considered an adverse reaction to vaccine and is noted as such in the current 
product labelling. Lymphadenopathy was reported at a higher frequency among the vaccinated 
subjects (13 [0.9%] vs 1 [0.1%]). The mean time to onset after Dose 1 was 6.2 days (median 3 
days), and after Dose 2 was 2.6 days (median 2 days). The mean duration of the events was 4.7 
days (median 3.5 days, range 1 to 14 days). The single event in the placebo group had an onset at 
22 days post-Dose 1 with a duration of 2 days. All reported cases of lymphadenopathy were mild. 
Other Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
No cases have been reported in this population with regard to the CDC list of AESIs included (but 
were not limited to): thrombocytopenic events, thromboembolic or intravascular coagulation events, 
autoimmune or demyelination events, meningitis, encephalitis, neuritis, Kawasaki disease, MIS-C, 
or acute respiratory distress syndrome. No cases of severe COVID-19 have been reported. 
One event of arthralgia grade 1 that resolved after one day was reported in the BNT162b group, the 
AE was considered related to study intervention by the investigator. 
One event of paresthesia grade 2 with onset 1 day after dose 2 and resolved 3 days after onset, was 
reported in the BNT162b group. The AE was considered related to study intervention by the 
investigator.

2.6.4.2.3.  Adverse Events Phase 2/3 Expansion group 
From Dose 1 to the current cut-off date (08 October 2021) which represents at least 2 weeks follow-up 
after dose 2 for >70% of the participants but less than 4 weeks follow-up for all subjects, the 
proportions of participants in the safety expansion group reporting any AE were similar (BNT162b2 
[7.2%] vs placebo [6.3%]). 
Table 21.  Number (%) of Participants Reporting at Least 1 Adverse Event From Dose 1 Through Cutoff 
Date (08 Oct 2021) – Safety Expansion Group – Phase 2/3 – 5 to <12 Years of Age – Safety Population 
Many of the AEs were reflective of reactogenicity events that were reported as AEs. AE frequencies in 
SOCs containing the most common reactogenicity AEs (BNT162b2 vs placebo) were: 
- general disorders and administration site conditions: 2.3% vs 1.8% 
- gastrointestinal disorders: 0.8% vs 0.8% 
- nervous system disorders: 0.6% vs 0.4% 
- musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: 0.4% vs 0.4% 
Other categories of events reported in the safety expansion group are discussed below by SOC and PT.  
Infections and infestations (0.8% vs 0.4%). Most events reported in this SOC are typical for this age 
group, including ear infections, conjunctivitis, and terms consistent with common colds and infections. 
The overall numerical difference between BNT162b2 and placebo groups is due to unrelated events of 
unrelated skin and ear, nose, and throat infections reported in a limited number of participants in the 
BNT162b2 group, which is a larger group of participants due to the 2:1 randomization of BNT162b2: 
placebo. 
Skin and subcutaneous disorders (1.0% vs 0.5%). Events reported more frequently in the BNT162b2 
group included rashes, urticaria, angioedema, dermatitis, pruritis, night sweats, and Henoch-
Schoenlein purpura. Events in this SOC are discussed further with AEs of clinical interest.

Immune system disorders (0.2% vs 0) including 1 event reported as Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction 
and other non-drug allergies. 
General disorders and administrative site conditions included reactogenicity events as well as chest 
discomfort or chest pain in 1 participant each (0.1%) in both groups. Events reported as non-cardiac 
chest pain were reported in 2 participants (0.1%) in the BNT162b2 group (both considered by the 
investigator as related to study intervention and 3 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group (1 
considered by the investigator as related to study intervention).

One event of mild Henoch-Schoenlein purpura (HSP) with onset 21 days after Dose 1 was reported in a 
study participant with no past medical history in the BNT162b2 group. The event was considered as 
not related to study intervention by the investigator. On Day 16 post dose 1, ankle swelling that 
resolved 2 days later was noted by the parents and no medical attention was received. On Day 19, the 
study participant reported abdominal pain. On Day 20, the study participant bumped the knee and was 
evaluated by the  primary care physician (PCP). The PCP diagnosed the HSP, with etiology reported as 
unknown. At that visit, the participant had mild abdominal pain and mild rash of palpable purpura at 
abdominal wall, stomach, and back. The abdominal pain resolved later that day. On Day 21, light rash 
on the abdomen and back was observed by the Investigator/Principal Investigator. There was no 
palpable purpura according to the principle investigator’s assessment. Vitals reported included 
temperature of 98.7 °F (37°C), blood pressure of 100/69 mm HG, HR 90 bpm, and RR 21 bpm. No 
laboratory studies, including biopsy or urinalysis, were performed by the PCP. Treatment plan included 
prescription of steroids and pain medication to be used as needed. There were no other infections or 
non-study vaccinations reported from time of vaccination to diagnosis of HSP. Re-evaluation by PCP or 
referral to specialist did not occur. The HSP resolved 14 days after initial diagnosis with no treatment 
administered.  Dose 2 was not administered. 
One participant in the BNT162b2 group had an event reported by the investigator as a mild Type IV 
hypersensitivity reaction considered by the investigator as related to study intervention. Following 
information about this case was available: this participant was enrolled in the BNT162b2 group and 
reported as an AE of mild Type IV hypersensitivity reaction with rash (on head and arm) with onset of 
3 days after Dose 1. The study participant was seen by a dermatologist who diagnosed as a Type IV 
hypersensitivity reaction and characterized the rash as ‘plaque, erythematous and minimal crusting,

and prescribed triamcinolone and acrivastine creams. The event reported as resolving 18 days after 
onset without sequelae. This participant had no other reported AEs. This participant had no reported 
medical history and received no prohibited concomitant treatments or non-study vaccines. This 
participant received Dose 2 without any additional AEs reported post-dose. 
Related Adverse Events 
From Dose 1 to the data cut-off date (08 October 2021), AEs assessed as related by the investigator 
were reported at a higher frequency in the BNT162b2 group (3.5%) than in the placebo group (1.8%). 
Most related AEs were reactogenicity events and in the SOC of general disorders and administration 
site conditions. The most common reported event in this SOC was injection site pain (1.1% in 
BNT162b2 vs 0.3% in placebo).  
One participant in the BNT162b2 group had 2 AEs of pyrexia and neutropenia (‘worsening from 
baseline’) see section discontinuation due to AEs. 
One participant in the BNT162b2 group had a non-serious AE reported by the investigator as moderate 
haematochezia considered by the investigator as related to study intervention. The event was reported 
4 days after Dose 2, the participant had hemoccult positive stool; was seen in the emergency 
department, and had no further tests done; and went home and the event resolved the same day 
without sequelae. This participant had a medical history of asthma and nondrug allergy and had no 
other reported AEs. 
Two participants (0.1%) in the BNT162b2 group and 1 participant (0.1%) in the placebo group had 
events of non-cardiac chest pain considered by the investigator as related to study intervention. All 
events were mild and reported as resolved within 1 to 2 days of onset.  
Immediate Adverse Events 
After Dose 1, immediate AEs (reported within 30 minutes of the first vaccination) were low in 
frequency (≤0.2%) in both groups and included injection site pain reported in 1 participant (0.1%) in 
each group. Events reported in the BNT162b2 group only following Dose 1 included vaccination site 
pain and pruritis, each event reported in 1 participant (0.1%).  
After Dose 2, immediate AEs (reported within 30 minutes of the second vaccination) were low in 
frequency (≤0.1% vs 0) One participant (0.1%) reported each: fatigue, injection site pain, and an 
event reported by the investigator as tinea versicolor which was diagnosed at the time of the Dose 2 
vaccination visit (i.e., reported on day of second vaccination and ongoing at the time of the data cut-
off date). No allergic reactions to BNT162b2 were reported as immediate events after either dose. 
Severe and Life-Threatening Adverse Events 
According to table 21, the frequency of severe (i.e., Grade 3) AEs were low in both arms (5 vs 0 
subjects) from Dose 1 to the data cut-off date.  
Severe events in the BNT162b2 group is described in table 23 below. The case that reported 
neutropenia and pyrexia is described in section discontinuation due to AEs.  
No participants reported any life-threatening (i.e., Grade 4) AEs.

Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
Adverse events of specific clinical interest, such as those in the CDC list of AESIs for COVID-19, were 
reviewed based on AEs reported up to the cut-off date. Information on events of clinical interest 
included terms requested by the FDA included: anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Bell’s palsy, and 
lymphadenopathy. The protocol defined AESI of myocarditis/pericarditis was also considered in the 
safety review. 
No cases of myocarditis/pericarditis, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, or Bell’s palsy/facial paralysis/facial 
paresis was reported up to data cut-off date (08 October 2021).  
Lymphadenopathy is considered an adverse reaction to vaccine and is noted as such in the current 
product labelling. Lymphadenopathy was reported at a higher frequency among the vaccinated 
subjects (6 [0.4%]) BNT162b2; 3 [0.4%] placebo). The mean time to onset after Dose 1 was 11 days 
(median 11 days), and after Dose 2 the mean time to onset was 1 day (median 1 day), the same day 
as vaccination. The mean duration of events was 3.0 days (median 3 days). All reported cases of 
lymphadenopathy were mild. Most cases were in the cervical nodes, with a few in the axilla.  
Rashes is considered an adverse reaction to vaccine and is noted as such in the current product 
labelling. In the safety expansion group, no serious or severe, related rashes were reported after 
BNT162b2 vaccination.

Other Adverse Events of Clinical Interest 
In addition to FDA-requested AEs of clinical interest, notable pertinent negatives (i.e., no cases 
reported in this safety expansion group as of the data cut-off for this submission) with regard to the 
CDC list of AESIs included (but were not limited to): thrombocytopenic events, thromboembolic or 
intravascular coagulation events, autoimmune or demyelination events, meningitis, encephalitis, 
neuritis, convulsions, peripheral neuropathy, Kawasaki disease, MIS-C, or acute respiratory distress 
syndrome.

Additional AEs of clinical interest, regardless of inclusion on the CDC AESI list, were evaluated based 
on sponsor safety data review. 
Arthralgia was reported by a total of 2 participants, 1 each in the BNT162b2 (0.1%) and placebo 
(0.1%) groups.  
Severe infective arthritis was reported by 1 participant in the BNT162b2 group (Table 24), considered 
an unrelated SAE; and earlier described. 
Chest pain, non-cardiac chest pain, or chest discomfort were reported by 3 participants (0.2%) in the 
BNT162b2 group and 4 participants (0.5%) in the placebo group. None of these events had any 
reported cardiac involvement.  
Syncope was reported by 1 participant in the BNT162b2 group.

Deaths 
No deaths were reported up to 8 October 2021. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Up to 8 October 2021 one participant (0.1%) in each group reported a total of 3 SAEs after receiving 
BNT162b2 or placebo. These SAEs were all assessed by the investigator as not related to study 
intervention. 
-
The participant in the BNT162b2 group reported a non-serious Grade 3 AE of fall 45 days after receiving
Dose 2; this was concurrent with a reported Grade 3 SAE of upper limb fracture identified the same day
(45 days post-Dose 2) as being due to a ‘traumatic accident’ (i.e., fall). The fracture was reported as
recovering/resolving at the time of the data cut-off. The SAE was considered by the investigator as not
related to study intervention.
-
The participant in the placebo group reported an SAE of Grade 3 pancreatitis (noted as occurring ‘post-
injury’) with onset at 4 days post-Dose 2 and reported as resolved within 7 days of onset with concomitant
drug treatment. This same participant reported a second Grade 3 SAE of abdominal pain with onset at 11
days post-Dose 2 and reported as resolved within 6 days after onset. Both SAEs were considered by the
investigator as not related to study intervention. This participant had no reported medical history and
received no prohibited concomitant treatments or non-study vaccines.

In the Phase 2/3 paediatric safety expansion group (cut-off date of 08 October 2021), one participant 
in the BNT162b2 group discontinued due to AEs, the narrative is provided below: 
One study participant in the BNT162b2 group had an AE of severe pyrexia (40.1 °C) with onset of 2 days after Dose 
1 considered by the investigator as related to study intervention that resolved at 1 day after onset. Severe 
neutropenia (‘worsening from baseline’) with onset of 3 days after Dose 1 considered by the investigator as related 
to study intervention was reported as resolving at the time of the data cut-off date. Medical history included 
gingivitis (since 2020), otitis media (in 2021), and benign transient neutropenia of unknown ethology (since 
2021).). Prior to study enrolment, a full haematology work-up (including for possible leukaemia) was performed 
with baseline absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 480 cells/mm3 (Reference value ANC 1800-8000 cells/mm3); the 
haematologist indicated no concerns with study participation. After Dose 1, on the day of vaccination, the 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 65/66  
participant reported one loose stool with a temperature of 37.8 °C and mild injection site pain; on Day 2 post-Dose 
1  temperature of 40.1 °C (as noted above) with mild injection site pain and fatigue was reported; and on Day 3 
post-Dose 1 the study participant was afebrile with mild injection site pain. Routine laboratory tests were performed 
two days post Dose 1, and the ANC was 20 cells/mm3 and platelets were reported as normal (no platelet count 
value specified). No other symptoms or infections were reported at that time. Subsequently on Day 19 after Dose 1, 
the investigator was contacted by the participant’s caregiver who reported the participant had bleeding gums for 1 
week prior. On Day 23, the participant attended Visit 2 to be seen by the investigator, had a follow-up blood draw 
that showed the ANC had improved to 70 cells/mm3, and was reported to be doing well. Dose 2 was not 
administered, and the participant was withdrawn from study intervention and remains in study follow-up. The study 
participant had previously received routine childhood immunizations on schedule. This participant reported no other 
AEs and received no prohibited concomitant medications or non-study vaccines during the study vaccination period.

2.6.5.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database to evaluate use of BNT162b 10µg in paediatric subjects aged 5 to <12 years of 
age constitutes of a Phase 1/2/3 Study C4591007. In the Phase 1 study the dose levels 10, 20, and 30 
µg were evaluated in 48 (n=16 each group) paediatric subjects. The Phase 2/3 study constitutes of 
two study groups randomized 2:1 that was initiated at two different time points.  
The initial safety group included 2,285 subjects (n=1,528 BNT162; n=757 placebo) first cut-off 6 
September 2021, and the safety expansion group included 2,394 subjects (n=1,598 BNT162b; n=795 
placebo) cut-off 8 October 2021. When data for the expansion safety group was submitted, the MAH 
also provided data up to 8 October for the initial safety group. The Phase 2/3 study is still ongoing. 
Disposition was similar in the two Phase 2/3 groups where very high exposure rates to both dose 1 
(99.3% initial; 99.4% expansion) and dose 2 (99.3% initial; 98.7% expansion) was reached. For the 
initial study group an excessive number of participants completed the 1-month post dose 2 visit 
(98.5%), and a majority (95,9%) had a follow-up time of ≥3 months after dose 2 at the cut-off 8 
October 2021.  
For the expansion group >70% had a follow-up time >2 weeks but none of the subjects had a follow-
up time >4 weeks after dose 2. Withdrawal rates were overall low in both study arms of the initial 
group (0.3% BNT162b;0.4% placebo) and the expansion group (0.1% each arm).  
Most of the participants received Dose 2 within the protocol defined window of 19-23 days after Dose 1 
([initial 95.6% BNT162b; 94.5% placebo], [expansion 94.4% BNT162b; 94.5% placebo]). 
Demographic characteristics are considered well balanced between vaccine and placebo arm. Both 
study groups in the Phase 2/3 study were comparable in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity, obesity, 
baseline SARS-CoV-2 and comorbidities. None of the subjects were HIV+. 
A dose dependent increase of local and systemic reactions was noted in the Phase 1 study, where 10 
ug appears to be less reactogenic. The MAH decided to continue with a dose of 10 µg for the Phase 2/3 
study, which is endorsed from a safety perspective. 
Reactogenicity was evaluated in 2,268 paediatric subjects from the initial safety group of the Phase 2/3 
study. The most common local reaction was pain at injection site, which was reported in 74% of the 
paediatric subjects after Dose 1 and in 71% after Dose 2 of BNT162b. Most of the local reactions were 
transient and mild to moderate at intensity. No Grade 4 local reactions were reported in either group.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 66/67  
Among the reported systemic reactions, fatigue (>34%) and headache (>22%) was the most common 
in the subjects that received BNT162b. A tendency to a higher frequency of systemic events after dose 
2 compared to dose 1 was noted. Most of the systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. 
Across groups, median onset after receiving BNT162b2 was 1 to 4 days after Dose 1 or Dose 2.  
Antipyretic/pain medication after vaccination with BNT162b increased slightly from dose 1 (14.4%) to 
dose 2 (19.9%), supporting a somewhat higher frequency of the systemic reactions after dose 2.  
Overall, the pattern of systemic events reported after each dose can be expected from a vaccine. 
Up to the cut-off date (8 October 2021) 197 (13%) vs 83 (11.1%) subjects in the initial safety group 
of Phase 2/3, reported at least one AE. Most often occurring SOCs were general disorders and 
administration site conditions (injection site pain, fatigue), gastrointestinal disorders (vomiting, 
abdominal pain), nervous system disorders (headache), musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (myalgia, arthralgia), infections and infestations (otitis externa), injury poisoning and 
procedural complications (fall, arthropod bite).  
Among the subjects included in the safety expansion group 115 (7.2%) vs 50 (6.3%) of subjects 
reported at least one AE. Most often occurring SOCs in the safety expansion group were general 
disorders and administration site conditions (2.3% vs 1.8%), which was mainly driven by 
reactogenicity events such as injection site pain and fatigue, followed by gastrointestinal disorders 
(vomiting, abdominal pain), nervous system disorders (headache) and musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders (myalgia, arthralgia).  
Overall, in both initial and expansion safety group, many of the reported AEs were either related to the 
reactogenicity of vaccination or events that would be expected in a general population of healthy 
children in this age group. No imbalance between the vaccine and placebo groups was noted. 
From Dose 1 to 1 month after Dose 2, severe AEs (Grade 3) were low in both arms (3 vs 1) in the 
initial safety group. Three severe AEs in the BNT162b arms were reported up to the cut-off 6 
September 2021 (tic, upper limb fracture and rash). In the expansion safety group, 5 BNT162b vs 0 
placebo subjects reported severe AEs (food allergy, arthritis infective, foreign body, 
pyrexia/neutropenia epiphyseal fracture). No participants reported any life-threatening (Grade 4) AEs. 
Lymphadenopathy was reported in a higher frequency among the vaccinated subjects compared to 
placebo (initial group 13 vs 1: expansion group 6 vs 3). The item is considered an adverse reaction to 
vaccine and is noted as such in the SmPC. 
In the initial study 18 participants (1.2% vs 0.8%) reported events in angioedema/hypersensitivity 
SMQs (insect bite, urticaria, dermatitis, rash). In the expansion group hypersensitivity reactions 
(mostly rash) was reported in 3 vs 4 subjects. Rash is included in the SmPC as an ADR. 
In the safety expansion group, arthralgia was reported in one subject in each treatment arm, one 
event of syncope was reported in the BNT162b group and chest pain was reported in 3 vs 4 subjects, 
none of them with cardiac involvement. 
One case in the BNT162b2 safety expansion group was by the investigator reported to have an AE with 
Henoch-Schoenlein purpura, considered by the investigator as mild and not related to study 
intervention. If there is no other causal explanation to this AE, it cannot be excluded that this event 
was related to study intervention and that other AEs reported in this case could have been the first 
clinical signs of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Additional information was provided by the MAH describing 
clinical symptoms not completely aligned with Henoch Schönlein purpura, however, urine sample is 
lacking and therefore evaluation of vasculitis engaging the kidneys is not possible. No events of 
vasculitis such as Henoch-Schönlein purpura was reported post-marketing up to 16 November 2021. 
This topic should be monitored, and any emerging data presented in the upcoming MSSRs.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 67/68  
Another participant in the BNT162b2 safety expansion group had an event reported by the investigator 
as a mild type IV hypersensitivity reaction considered by the investigator as related to study 
intervention. Several drugs can trigger type IV hypersensitivity reactions leading to drug 
hypersensitivity and other clinical syndromes and some of them can lead to more serious life-
threatening type, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or acute generalized 
exanthematous pustulosis. Thereby, it is important to exclude that this clinical condition described in 
this case was not a precursor to a more severe type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Since this was 
confirmed to be a mild case only seen after the first dose, no further action is proposed. This topic 
should be monitored and any emerging data presented in the upcoming MSSRs. 
SAEs occurred at a very low frequency in both placebo and vaccine arm in both study groups. In the 
expansion safety groups one subject that received BNT162b reported one SAE (upper limb fracture 
fracture). No event of death was reported. 
AEs of clinical interest, such as the CDC's list of AESIs for COVID-19, which both include terms 
potentially indicative of severe COVID-19 or serious autoimmune and neuroinflammatory disorders, 
were considered in the review of reported events. Up to the cut-off 8 October 20201 no cases of 
myocarditis/pericarditis, anaphylaxis, appendicitis, Kawasaki disease, convulsions, peripheral 
neuropathy, MIS-C, severe COVID-19, autoimmune or demyelination events Bell’s palsy/facial 
paralysis/facial paresis was reported in the two groups included in the Phase 2/3 study.  
The rate of subjects discontinuing the study due to AE was low, in total one subject in the BNT162 arm 
discontinued due to AEs (fever and neutropenia). 
The study size did not allow detection of rare adverse events, or to evaluate whether the 
characteristics of identified, but rarer risks differ compared with the adolescent and adult populations. 
In response to a request from the Rapporteur, the MAH provided additional information on AEs in 
children from 5 to less than 12 years of age during the post-marketing phase. One case of myocarditis 
and one case of perimyocarditis have been reported. For the first case, no previous medical history 
was reported, TTO was 5 days after dose 2 and the child was hospitalized for 8 days for myocarditis. A 
negative COVID-19 test was reported, but no other laboratory data has been provided. In the second 
case, the child was admitted to hospital after dose 2 to see a cardiologist and was reported to have 
perimyocarditis. Besides clinical symptoms no information regarding laboratory data, medical history, 
TTO, concomitant medication or hospitalization has been provided. Due to assumed off-label use of 30 
µg dose in the age group 5-11 years, and very limited information provided for each case, , it is not 
possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the relevance of this information for the applied dose of 10 
microgram in the age group 5-11 years. 
2.6.6.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety evaluation is based on one still ongoing Phase 2/3 study including 2,285 (initial group) 
+2,394 (expansion group) paediatric subjects randomized 2:1, who received either two doses of 
BNT162b 10 µg (n=1,528+1,598) or placebo (n=757+795).
Overall, the reported reactogenicity profile are in line with what can be anticipated from a vaccine with 
mostly mild to moderate reactions.  
The frequency of reported AEs and SAEs were low. The observed adverse reactions have been included 
in the SmPC.  
There are no new safety concerns based on the study conducted; however, the study size did not allow 
detection of rare adverse events, or to evaluate whether the characteristics of identified, but rarer risks

differ compared with the adolescent and adult populations. Post-marketing data on safety, as 
additionally requested from the MAH, informed about two cases of myocarditis, myopericarditis after 
assumed off-label use of the higher 30 microgram dose, and with very limited clinical information. No 
additional concern is currently raised based on this information. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in this age 
range in the context of this conditional MA:

No changes to the Risk minimisation measures are proposed within the updated RMP. 
While medication errors are not an important risk in the context of the RMP, the MAH has implemented 
measures to mitigate the risk of medication errors e.g. distinctive colours of flip off caps in line with 
the colour used on the labelling, as well as making information available to HCPs on the proper 
preparation and differentiation available via the QR code/URL and provided to the Member States who 
require them to support the national vaccination and/or communication campaigns. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to merge editorially the version submitted in this procedure 
with the latest approved RMP version. 
2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 4.0 is acceptable.

in the additional monitoring list for the following reasons: Conditional marketing authorisation / New active 
substance and new biological. 
3. Benefit-Risk Balance
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which 
appeared in the Wuhan province in China in 2019 and has spread world-wide during 2020 ever since, 
causing WHO to declare a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The virus infects primarily the airways and 
causes a broad spectrum of respiratory infections from asymptomatic infection to Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the 
outbreak.  
COVID-19 in children is mostly a mild disease. Severe cases occur rarely, and predominantly in 
subjects with underlying conditions. The MAH is seeking an indication for Comirnaty (BNT162b2) 10 µg 
formulation to children 5 to <12 years of age. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are currently no vaccines against COVID-19 approved in the EU for the use in children below 12 
years of age.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 78/79  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The application is based on the ongoing paediatric phase 1/2/3 study C4591007, which includes 5 to 
<12-year-old children. The study is in agreement with the approved PIP. The study population was 
randomized 2:1 to receive either 10 µg Comirnaty or saline placebo, given as 2 IM injections 21 day 
apart. 
In the Phase 2/3, the efficacy of BNT162b2 was established by immunobridging of the SARS CoV-2 
neutralizing antibody response in paediatric participants aged 5 to <12 years of age group in Study 
C4591007 to the response in participants being 16 to 25 years of age in the Phase 2/3 efficacy study 
C4591001. The Phase 2/3 evaluable immunogenicity population for participants 5 to <12 years of age 
included 294 participants in the BNT162b2 group and 147 participants in the placebo group, and for 
Study C4591001 participants 16 to 25 years of age included 273 participants in the BNT162b2 group 
and 47 participants in the placebo group. In the BNT162b2 and placebo groups, the majority of 
adolescents received dose 2 between 19 to 23 days after dose 1 (94.4% versus 94.5%). 
A supportive vaccine efficacy analysis was planned to be conducted when at least 21 confirmed cases 
of COVID-19 had accrued in the 5 to <12 years of age group and if success criteria for immunobridging 
in this age group had first been met. The efficacy analysis is based on cases confirmed among the 
initially enrolled N~2250 participants in the 5 to <12 years of age group of Study C4591007. Among 
randomized participants, 1450 participants were included in the BNT162b2 group and 736 participants 
in the placebo group. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Among participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, the 
ratio of the SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing GMT in children 5 to <12 years of age (who received the 
10-µg dose level) to that of young adults 16 to 25 years of age (who received the 30-µg dose level) 
was 1.04 (2-sided 95% CI: 0.93, 1.18). The lower bound of the 2 sided 95% CI for GMR was >0.67 
and the GMR point estimate was ≥0.8, which meets the prespecified 1.5-fold margin and success 
criteria. Therefore, immunobridging based on GMR was achieved. 
There was a similar magnitude of rise in antibody titers in the 5 to <12 years of age group (118.2) 
compared with the young adult 16 to 25 years of age group (111.4) for the BNT162b2 group. 
Neutralizing titers were elicited to both the USA-WA1/2020 (reference) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) 
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 strains at 1 month after Dose 2. 
Equal proportions (99.2% each of children 5 to <12 years of age and young adults 16 to 25 years of 
age) of participants achieved a seroresponse. The difference in the proportions of participants who had 
seroresponse between the 2 age groups (children – young adults) was 0.0% (2-sided 95% CI: -2.0%, 
2.2%). The lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference in seroresponse rate was -2.0%, which is 
greater than the prespecified margin of -10%. Therefore, immunobridging based on seroresponse rate 
was achieved. 
Subgroup analyses by demographic, baseline SARS-CoV-2 and obesity status did not show any 
meaningful differences in neutralizing immune response and seroresponse rate in the 5 to < 12 years 
group and 16-25 years group. 
In support of the immunobridging a preliminary analysis of efficacy was submitted. Among participants 
without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection before or during the vaccination regimen, the observed 
VE for BNT162b2 10 µg against any confirmed COVID-19 from at least 7 days after Dose 2 was 90.7% 
(2-sided 95% CI: 67.7%, 98.3%) which included 3 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 16 cases in the 
placebo group. Exploratory analysis of Delta neutralizing immune responses from a subset of 
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation  
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 79/80  
 
 
 
vaccinated/placebo sera from children 5-11 years, which showed significant neutralizing titers against the 
Delta variant, support the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 10µg against Delta variant. Confirmatory case 
sequencing data for COVID-19 cases will be reported at a later time, when the sequencing analysis is 
completed. The same vaccine efficacy (90.7% (95% CI: 67.4%, 98.3%)) was observed in children 5 to 
<12 years of age with or without evidence of infection prior to 7 days post-dose 2. There were no cases 
of COVID-19 among subjects who were SARS-CoV-2 positive at baseline. As might be anticipated, no 
severe cases were reported in children aged 5-11 years. 
Based on these data, it can be inferred that BNT162b2 vaccine is effective to prevent symptomatic 
COVID-19 in adolescents 5-11 years of age. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The efficacy analysis is considered supportive as it is based on preliminary data and a final analysis 
is anticipated when available.  
Specific risk groups among children, including those immunosuppressed, or otherwise with risk of more 
severe disease, were not specifically studied. A study in immunocompromised children is included in 
the PIP. The MAH was asked to consider whether a third dose in the primary series is relevant for 
children with substantial immunosuppression, as has been agreed previously for adolescents and 
adults. The MAH responded that the ongoing study in IC children is planned to be finished in the end of 
the 2022. The CHMP understands the MAH’s position, but as extrapolated data from adults was used 
also in age group 12-18, the SmPC should follow the same orientation as for adolescents. 
It is currently unknown if vaccination provides protection against asymptomatic infection, and to what 
extent vaccination prevents further transmission. 
The duration of protection is unknown in children, as well as among adults. The median duration of 
follow-up for the initially enrolled Phase 2/3 participants aged 5-11 years was 3.3 months post-dose 2. 
As for subjects ≥ 12 years of age, the assessment of the vaccine efficacy over a period of at least 6 
months is expected to determine the need and the appropriate time of a booster dose. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety of Comirnaty administered to subjects aged 5 to <12 years has been evaluated in a still 
ongoing Phase 2/3 study (C4591007) that includes two safety groups of subjects recruited at two 
different time points. The initial group included a total of 2,285 subjects (n=1,528 BNT162; n=757 
placebo) and the safety expansion group included 2,394 subjects (n=1,598 BNT162b; n=795 placebo). 
A new dose (10µg) was used in the study, which was administered with the same dose regimen as for 
adolescent and adult subjects.  
At the time of the analysis (8 October 2021), a total of 2,171 (n=1,456 Comirnaty; n=715 placebo) 
paediatric subjects in the initial groups were evaluated for safety for at least 3 months after the second 
dose of Comirnaty. In the expansion group 1,695 (n=1,122 Comirnaty; n=573 placebo) of the subjects 
were evaluated for safety for at least 2 weeks after dose 2, none of them had a follow-up time of ≥4 
weeks after the second dose.  
Regarding reactogenicity, the most frequent adverse reactions in participants aged 5-<12 years was 
pain at the injection site (74% dose1; 71% dose2), fatigue (34% dose1; 39% dose2), headache (22% 
dose1; 28% dose2), chills (5% dose1; 10% dose2), muscle pain (9% dose1; 12% dose2) and fever 
(3% dose1; 7% dose2). Vomiting and diarrhoea were reported infrequently after both doses to a 
similar extent in the placebo and vaccine group.  
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 80/81  
Most of the local and systemic events resolved within 3 days and were mild to moderate at intensity. 
The frequency of AEs and SAEs was in general low and no new safety concerns have been detected 
compared to what was reported for the adolescent and adult population. No cases of myocarditis or 
pericarditis were observed. One event of type IV hypersensitivity reaction and one event of Henoch-
Schoenlein purpura were reported among subjects who received Comirnaty 10 µg in the expansion 
safety group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A large number of adolescent and adult subjects has been exposed to the vaccine worldwide (>1,4 
billion (1 Dec 2020-30 Sept 2021). The short to midterm safety is considered relatively well 
characterized in adults so far. However, the present study size does not allow for the characterisation 
of less common child-specific risks, or if the magnitudes of identified but rarer risks differ compared 
with higher age groups.  
Long term safety data for paediatric subjects are also not available at this stage, however the Phase 
2/3 study will follow the included subjects up to 2 years post vaccination, so these data are expected 
post-authorisation as SOB. 
There are no data available on interaction with other vaccines given concomitantly. 
One case of Henoch-Schoenlein purpura was reported post vaccination. The causality assessment of 
“not related” is questioned. This entity is generally more common in children compared to adults. 
Additional information was provided by the MAH describing clinical symptoms not completely aligned 
with Henoch Schönlein purpura, however, urine sample is lacking and therefore evaluation of vasculitis 
engaging the kidneys is not possible. This topic will be monitored, and any emerging data presented in 
the upcoming MSSRs. 
Furthermore, one case of mild type IV dermal hypersensitivity was reported. This topic will be 
monitored, and any emerging data presented in the upcoming MSSRs.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The benefit of Comirnaty 10µg, administered as a course of two doses with about 3 weeks in between, 
in paediatric subjects 5 to <12 years of age has been clearly demonstrated in terms of bridging via 
similar neutralising antibody titers as seen in young adults treated in the efficacy study that was 
pivotal to initial approval, as well as protection against symptomatic disease. . The efficacy of 
Comirnaty (2 doses of 10 µg, separated by 21 days) to prevent COVID-19 in children aged 5-11 years 
with and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, occurring at least 7 days after the second 
dose, was 90.7% (CI95% 67.4; 98.3) and considered well-established. However, some uncertainties,

such as long-term efficacy and safety, and possibly duration of protection, should be adequately 
addressed post-authorization in the context of a conditional MA. 
While severe COVID-19 is rare in 5 to <12-year-old, this occasionally occurs, particularly in children 
with underlying risk factors. Furthermore, the inflammatory condition MIS-C has been associated with 
paediatric COVID-19. The importance of vaccination of children for reaching herd immunity has been 
suggested, but there are no data on the impact of childhood vaccination on overall community 
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 
The known unfavourable effects are considered acceptable in terms of reactogenicity. No cases of 
myocarditis were observed in the clinical trial. There are no new safety concerns based on the study 
conducted; however, the study size did not allow detection of rare adverse events, or to evaluate 
whether the characteristics of identified, but rarer risks differ compared with the adolescent and adult 
populations. The myocarditis/pericarditis entity will continue to be closely followed up and further 
characterized within the ongoing pharmacovigilance activities. Two reported post-marketing cases of 
myocarditis, perimyocarditis have been observed in connection to the use of a higher dose in the age 
group 5-11 years, also providing very limited clinical information in both cases. No additional safety 
concern is raised based on this data. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects for Comirnaty in the sought indication, 
particularly in children with comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID 19. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Comirnaty is currently authorised as a conditional marketing authorisation. 
The new paediatric indication aims as well at the prevention of COVID-19, which is to be used in 
response to a public health threat duly recognised by the World Health Organisation and EU. 
The CHMP considers that this new indication also fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
•
•
•
•
•
The benefit-risk balance is positive, as discussed.
It is likely that the MAH will be able to provide comprehensive data.
The present application is based on part of the ongoing paediatric study C4591007. As stated
above, safety data are limited with respect to the ability to detect rare side effects. Furthermore,
the duration of follow-up is relatively limited. The MAH will continue the ongoing paediatric study
C4591007 in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Comirnaty in this paediatric indication.
Therefore, the delivery of the final study report from the above-mentioned trial, is required to
provide a comprehensive efficacy and safety dataset and therefore should be designated a specific
obligation (SOB).
An unmet medical need will be addressed in a situation of a global pandemic. There is an unmet
medical need for the vaccination of children 5-11 years old, as there are no products approved for
this use.
Based on the presented data for this new indication, the benefits to public health of the immediate
availability is considered to outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are still
required.
Assessment report on extension of marketing authorisation 
EMA/719541/2021 
Page 83/84  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of COMIRNATY is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4. Recommendations
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of COMIRNATY 0.1 mg/mL is favourable in the following indication: 
Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active 
immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus in children aged 5 to 11 years. 
The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for COMIRNATY subject 
to the following conditions1:  
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Official batch release 
In accordance with Article 114 of Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The current indication for Tasigna is as follows: 
Tasigna is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome 
positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in the chronic phase (SmPC, section 4.1). 
The  scope  of  this  grouped  variation  application  was  the  update  of  the  Tasigna  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics  (SmPC)  regarding  the  possibility  of  treatment  discontinuation  in  patients  who  have 
been  treated  with  Tasigna  (nilotinib)  for  at  least  three  years  and  have  achieved  a  sustained  deep 
molecular response  based  on  the  results from  two treatment discontinuation studies, CAMN107I2201 
(ENESTfreedom) and CAMN107A2408 (ENESTop). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  provided  a  revised  ERA.  The  ERA  based  on  studies  submitted  in  the  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/X/28 and as Follow Up Measure (FUM) 039. Furthermore 2 new studies on identification of 
transformation  products  occurring  in  the  water-sediment  transformation  test  OECD  308  and  the  soil 
degradation test OECD 307 are now included in the ERA.  
2.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
PEC  values  were  refined  based  on  market  prediction  data  for  2022.  Consequently  PEC/PNEC  risk 
quotients were updated in Phase II. 
Based on the scientific information available, the placement of the foreseen amounts of nilotinib on the 
EU  market  does  not  constitute  any  significant  risk  to  surface  water,  groundwater  and  terrestrial 
compartments.  However,  in  the  Phase  II-Tier  B  sediment  risk  assessment  a  risk  is  calculated  for 
nilotinib. It should, however, be taken into consideration that no toxicity was found in the study with 
the sediment-dwelling larvae of Chironomus riparius in a study following OECD testing guideline 219. 
In this study the upper testing range was limited by the low water solubility of nilotinib and the results 
of the study are therefore reported as ‘no toxicity up to the limit of water solubility’. Based on this fact, 
Assessment report  
EMA/313746/2017  
Page 5/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
no reliable conclusion on the risk for the sediment compartment is possible. 
Based  on  the  logarithmic  octanol-water  partition  coefficients  of  nilotinib  of  3.6,  a  bioconcentration 
study  in  fish  has  been  conducted,  resulting  in  a  moderate  bioconcentration  factor  of  127.  This 
assessment  revealed  that  nilotinib  cannot  be  considered  as  a  PBT  substance  based  on  its  low 
bioconcentration potential in fish. However, nilotinib can be considered as potentially persistent based 
on the outcome of the studies on transformation in water-sediment systems and soils. Nilotinib showed 
a half-life of 179-213 days for the total water-sediment systems (normalized to 12°C) and a half-life of 
369 days for soils (normalized to 12°C). Consequently the criteria for a very persistent (vP) substance 
of 180 days in water-sediment systems and soils defined in the REACh guidance on PBT assessment is 
exceeded for both compartments.

2.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
There is no risk for the aquatic and terrestrial environment. The active ingredient is not considered as 
PBT substance. However, the active ingredient and its transformation products are very persistent in 
soil and sediment. The structure of the stable transformation products was proposed in the updated 
ERA. The conclusion of persistence has been included in the updated ERA.

2.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  updated data  submitted  in this  application  do  not  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in  environmental 
exposure further to the use of nilotinib.  
-  Considering the  above  data,  nilotinib  should  be  used  according  to the  precautions  stated in  section 
6.6  of  the  SmPC  in  order  to  minimise  any  potential  risks  to  the  environment:  Any  unused  medicinal 
product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
• 
Study I2201 (ENESTfreedom) enrolled patients receiving treatment with nilotinib for newly 
diagnosed CML-CP. The dose and schedule of nilotinib (300 mg bid) was consistent with the approved 
first-line indication. Patients who did not tolerate this standard dose but who achieved and/or 
maintained MR4.5 on a minimum dose of 400 mg once daily continued to be treated at this lower dose 
of 400 mg once daily at the discretion of the Investigator. Patients who required re initiation of 
nilotinib treatment because of loss of MMR resumed their previously tolerated nilotinib dose. 
• 
In Study A2408 (ENESTop), Ph+ CML CP patients were allowed to take the same nilotinib dose 
they were taking prior to study entry. Most patients included in the study were treated with either 
nilotinib 300 mg or 400 mg bid at study entry. Patients who had achieved and sustained MR4.5 on any 
dose other than 300 mg/400 mg bid of nilotinib prior to study entry, were also included in the study. 
The nilotinib 400 mg bid dose is the nilotinib starting dose for second-line treatment. 
• 
In Study A2405 (ENESTcmr) the dose and schedule used (400 mg bid) was consistent with the 
approved second-line indication.

2.4.2.  Main studies 
  STUDY I2201 (ENESTfreedom) 
(ENESTfreedom)  was  a  Phase  II,  single-arm,  multicenter  study,  evaluating  the  feasibility  of  TFR  in 
patients  with  BCR-ABL1-positive  CML-CP  who  have  achieved  durable  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD) 
status on first-line nilotinib treatment.  
Methods 
Study participants 
Patients had to have received a minimum of 2 years of first-line nilotinib treatment and have ≥ MR4.5, 
prior  to  study  entry.  During  the  first  52  weeks  of  the  study  (i.e.  the  NTCS  phase),  patients  were 
treated with the planned dose of 300 mg bid nilotinib (or at a reduced dose level of 400 mg once daily 
if  required  from  the  perspective  of  tolerance).  Patients  had  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR) 
assessments every 12 weeks by a Novartis designated laboratory. Patients who achieved durable MRD 
(i.e.  of  the  4  last  quarterly  PCR  assessments,  the  last  assessment  was  MR4.5,  no  assessment  was 
worse  than  MR4.0,  and  no  more  than  two  assessments  between  MR4.0  and  MR4.5)  were  eligible  to 
start  the  TFR  phase,  where  nilotinib  treatment  was  suspended.  During  the  TFR  phase,  BCR-ABL/ABL 
levels  were  monitored  every  4  weeks  during  the  first  48  weeks,  every  6  weeks  for  the  following  48 
weeks, and every 12 weeks during the last period. All PCR assessments were performed by a Novartis 
designated laboratory. 
During  the  first  48  weeks  of  the  TFR  phase,  loss  of  MR4.0  triggered  an  intensified  bi-weekly  BCR-
ABL/ABL  level  monitoring  to  identify  loss  of  MMR  early.  Loss  of  MMR  was  assessed  in  a  single  blood 
sample  (confirmation  of  loss  of  MMR  was  not  required)  and  mandated  re-initiation  of  nilotinib 
treatment  at  300  mg  bid  or  at  a  reduced  dose  level  of  400  mg  once  daily  if  required  from  the 
perspective of tolerance within 5 weeks of the collection date of the blood sample demonstrating loss 
of MMR.

pregnant, unless they were using highly effective methods of contraception during the study and for 14 
days after the final dose of nilotinib.  
Treatments 
The  study  comprised  three  main  phases:  the  nilotinib  consolidation  (NTCS)  phase  (52  weeks),  the 
nilotinib  TFR  phase  (up  to  192  weeks  after  the  last  patient  enters  the  nilotinib  TFR  phase)  and  the 
treatment re-initiation (NTRI) phase (up to 192 weeks after the last patient entered in the TFR phase).  
All eligible patients in the treatment phases (NTCS phase, NTRI and NTRI-2 phases and the NTCT and 
NTCT-P phases) were treated orally with the planned dose of 300 mg nilotinib bid. Dose regimen could 
be decreased to 400 mg once daily at the discretion of  the Investigator in case of study-drug related 
hematological and non-hematological toxicities.

Figure 1 Design of Study I2201 (ENESTfreedom) 
Objectives 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable in Study I2201 is the proportion of patients who are in MMR (MR3.0) at 
48 weeks after starting the TFR phase defined as the number of patients with MMR at 48 weeks after 
starting  the  TFR  phase  with  no  loss  of  MMR  and  no  re-initiation  of  nilotinib  therapy  in  the  first  48 
weeks after starting the TFR phase divided by the number of patients who entered the TFR phase. 
The main secondary efficacy endpoints assessed in the current analysis are: 
 
Treatment-free survival (TFS) after the start of the TFR phase 
  MR4.5 rate at 48 weeks after start of the TFR phase. 
 
 
Time required to regain MMR/MR4.5 
Progression free survival (PFS) after the start of the TFR phase 
  Overall survival (OS) after the start of the TFR 
  Kinetics of BCR-ABL/ABL transcript levels after restart of nilotinib treatment 
The exploratory efficacy endpoints assessed in the current analysis are: 
  Association between baseline demographics/disease history and primary endpoint 
Assessment report

 
Patient-reported outcomes and resource utilization (RU) 
  BCR-ABL mutations in patients who lost MMR during the TFR phase 
Sample size 
Demonstration of successful nilotinib TFR phase was based on a study designed with a 90% power to 
test the null hypothesis that the rate of MMR at 48 weeks after start of the TFR phase was < 50% with 
the alternative hypothesis that the rate of MMR at 48 weeks after start of the TFR phase was >50%. 
The sample size was based on  Fleming’s single  stage  design  to test the null  hypothesis H0: p ≤ 0.5, 
where p was the rate of MMR at 48 weeks after start of the TFR phase  (considering any patient who 
required  re-initiation  of  treatment  as  non-responder).  If  the  true  rate  p  ≥  0.65,  then  with  one-sided 
alpha level of 2.5% and a power of 90%, a minimum of 122 patients were required to be studied. This 
study  had  actually  enrolled  216  patients  by  20-Dec-2013,  the  date  when  the  patient  enrollment  was 
closed. With 216 patients enrolled, assuming approximately 30% of enrolled patients who had MR4.5 
at study entry would not be eligible for starting the TFR phase, there would have been approximately 
151  patients  entering  TFR.  Assuming  the  true  rate  of  MMR  at  48  weeks  after  start  of  the  TFR  phase 
would be 65%, with a  MMR rate of 50% for the null hypothesis,  the  study  would have a 94% power 
with one-sided alpha level of 2.5% to test the null hypothesis. The power would have increased by 4% 
based on the 216 enrolled patients compared to the originally planned 90% power based on the 175 
enrolled patients, with all the other assumptions for the power calculation being the same. 
Randomisation 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the FAS. The primary endpoint (rate of successful TFR) 
was  presented  together  with  an  exact  95%  Clopper-Pearson  confidence  interval  (CI).  The  null 
hypothesis  was  to  be  rejected  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  was  greater  than  0.50.  The  primary 
analysis was repeated on the PPS as a supportive analysis. All demographic data, medical history and 
current medical conditions at study start, and disease history were summarized and listed for the FAS 
and Safety set. 
The rate of molecular responses by certain time points after starting the TFR phase as well as the rate 
of  patients  who  re-achieved  molecular  responses  (MR4.5/MMR)  with  nilotinib  retreatment  were 
presented together with an exact 95% Clopper-Pearson CI. Kinetics of BCR-ABL transcript levels after 
re-start  of  nilotinib  therapy  were  presented  by  a  box-plot  of  BCR-ABL  ratio  over  time  and  were  also 
summarized over time. 
All  time  to  event  endpoints  including  duration  of  treatment  re-initiation  required  to  regain  MMR  and 
MR4.5, TFS, PFS and OS were analyzed using the  Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and were presented by 
KM plots. 
All  nilotinib  concentrations  were  listed  using  the  Safety  set.  The  following  is  the  list  of  analyses 
conducted to investigate the nilotinib concentration- efficacy relationship: Scatter plot of BCR ABL ratio 
(%) at 48 weeks of the NTCS phase vs. trough nilotinib concentration and the TFR phase entry status 
was  summarized  using  contingency  table  by  trough  nilotinib  concentration  categories  (by  quartiles). 
Safety set was used for all safety analyses. Since the primary interest of the study was to assess the

benefit of stopping treatment, particular analysis was performed on the patients who entered the TFR 
phase  (TFR  Safety  set):  those  analyses  focused  on  the  differences  of  the  incidence  of  safety  events 
(AEs and lab abnormalities) between the NTCS phase and the first 48-weeks of the TFR phase to allow 
fair comparison.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The study protocol was amended three times.  
The key features of each amendment are given below. 
Amendment 1 (released on  3-Jul-2013): At  the time of  the amendment the study  was in the  startup 
phase; 16 patients had been enrolled as of 20-Jun-2013. 
The primary purpose for the amendment was: 
Assessment report  
EMA/313746/2017  
Page 16/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To  implement  modifications  as  requested  from  different  Health  Authorities  (HAs)  and  Ethic 
Committees/Institutional Review Boards (ECs/IRBs) during review of the original protocol. 
 
To address feedback from Investigators received during the study startup. 
The main points addressed were: 
  Allowed  repeated  pre-screenings  for  BCR-ABL  transcript  level  as  soon  as  possible  when  MR4.5 
could not be assessed at pre-screening due to logistical or quality issues which was considered to 
increase the chance of enrolling patients who were actually eligible for screening/enrollment. 
  According  to  the  Novartis  “Guideline  on  Prevention  of  Pregnancies  in  Clinical  Trials”  for  highly 
effective  contraception,  monthly  urine  pregnancy  testing  was  included  in  the  assessments 
schedule. The requirement of using highly effective contraception was changed from 30 to 14 days 
after the final dose  of  nilotinib based on the half-life of  Tasigna® and  the  individual variability of 
metabolism. Additionally the acceptable method of highly effective contraception was corrected for 
periodic abstinence. 
 
The criteria for premature withdrawal and how to proceed if a pregnancy occurred during TFR was 
clarified. 
 
Inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  were  amended  to  better  reflect  the  patient  population  to  be 
included  in  Study  I2201  including  that  patients  must  have  been  treated  for  a  minimum  of  two 
calendar years with at least the last 12 months prior to pre-screening at the approved total daily 
dose of 600 mg nilotinib (or at a reduced dose level of 400 mg qd if patients did not tolerate the 
planned dose). 
  Allowed  screening  patients  from  Study  EIC01  (ENEST1st)  study  for  participation  to  Study  I2201 
without  having  first  to  discontinue  Study  EIC01.  Patients  would  discontinue  Study  EIC01  only  if 
they are confirmed eligible for Study I2201. This practice was in compliance with the ICH Topic E8 
guidelines as it constituted a “justified exception”. 
  Dose  reduction  guidelines  for  study-drug  related  non-hematologic  toxicity  and  suggested 
management  of  selected  AEs  were  updated  to  reflect  the  latest  version  of  the  nilotinib 
[Investigator Brochure] on Management of Ischemic vascular or Cardiovascular Events. 
 
Pharmacogenetics  study  was  added 
to 
identify 
factors  (i.e.  pt.  demography,  genetic 
polymorphisms as well as genomic biomarkers) associated with successful TFR of nilotinib therapy. 
Polymorphisms  known  to  be  associated  with  sub-optimal  response  to  treatment  with  imatinib, 
nilotinib  or  other  TKI  as  well  as  polymorphisms  proposed  in  the  literature  as  criteria  for 
discontinuing treatment was tested for  their  association with  successful  TFR.  These  might  include 
polymorphisms  in  NKp30,  members  of  the  KIR  family  and  members  of  the  BCL2  family  (such  as 
BIM). 
 
To correct discrepancies and add clarifications within the protocol. 
Amendment 2 (released on 03-Jul-2014) 
The main purposes of the amendment were: 
 
To include cholesterol testing in the assessment schedule. Elevations in total serum cholesterol and 
low  density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  was  observed  very  commonly  (more  than  10%)  in  patients 
treated with nilotinib and commonly (between 1 to 10%) in patients treated with imatinib. Most of 
the cholesterol elevations were grade 1 (>ULN  – 300 mg/dL; >ULN - 7.75 mmol/L) or 2 (>300 - 
400  mg/dL;  >7.75  -  10.34  mmol/L),  and  some  elevations  were present  prior  to  initiation of  CML 
therapy.  Lipid  profiles  including  total  cholesterol,  LDL-C  and  HDL-C  were  assessed  during  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/313746/2017  
Page 17/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conduct  of  this  study.  If  test  results  warranted  intervention,  Investigators  followed  their  local 
standards  of  practice  or  treatment  guidelines  which  recommended  treatment  even  for  grade  1 
cholesterol elevation. 
Before  prescribing  a  lipid-lowering  medication,  the  possibility  of  drug-drug  interactions  was 
considered due to moderate inhibitory effect of nilotinib on CYP3A4 isoenzyme that was involved in 
the metabolic pathway of some statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). 
 
To  provide  a  harmonization  on  dose  reductions  guidelines  across  Novartis-sponsored  Tasigna® 
study  protocols.  Hence  the  dose  reduction  guidelines  for  the  following  non-hematologic  toxicities 
were updated: 
o  Pancreatitis grade 4: change from “Hold therapy” to “Stop therapy”. 
o  QTcF prolongation >480 ms toxicity. 
o  Cardiac “Other”: change from “Hold therapy” to “Stop therapy”. 
 
To incorporate guidance for the management of: 
o  Serum cholesterol increased. 
o  Blood glucose increased. 
o  Other cardiac risk factors. 
o 
Ischemic vascular or ischemic cardiovascular events occurring in patients treated with 
nilotinib. 
 
To  incorporate  precaution  of  use  for  antacid  drugs  to  be  aligned  with  Tasigna®  FDA  Prescribing 
Information and EMA SmPC. 
 
To define ischemic vascular and ischemic cardiovascular events as AEs of special interest, and their 
reporting. 
 
To  include  serum  phosphate  testing  in  the  assessment  schedule  to  ensure  consistency  with  the 
dose reduction guidelines in case of serum hypophosphatemia. 
To clarify the specification of the statistical alternative hypothesis H1. 
To  inform  the  IRBs/IECs/REBs  and  HAs  about  over-recruitment  and  its  impact  on  the  stopping 
rules applied to the first 48 weeks after start of TFR and on the sample size calculation. 
 
 
 
To correct discrepancies and add clarifications within the protocol. 
Amendment 3 (released on 30-Jul-2015): At the time of the database lock, the protocol amendment 3 
was  yet  to  receive  health  authority  (HA)/Ethics  committee  (EC)/Independent  review  board  (IRB) 
approval in five countries. 
The main purposes of the amendment were: 
 
To clarify instructions on when intensified PCR bi-weekly monitoring will be ended if loss of MR4.0 
happened after the first 48 weeks of the TFR phase. 
 
 
 
To more precisely define “immediate” treatment re-initiation after loss of MMR. 
To further clarify the early study termination rules during the first 48 weeks of the TFR phase. 
To  add  a  section  “General  non-hematological  laboratory  toxicity”  to  allow  for  a  distinction  from 
“General  non-hematology toxicity”,  for  which  the  described  rules  must  be  strictly  applied  without 
any  possibility  of  modification  by  the  Investigator.  It  was  necessary  to  introduce  the  section 
Assessment report  
EMA/313746/2017  
Page 18/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“General non-hematological  laboratory  toxicity”  to  accommodate an  individual assessment  by the 
Investigator  in  some  clinical  situations  such  as  serum  glucose  increase  ≥  grade  2  or  bilirubin 
increase  ≥  grade  2 in  Gilbert’s  patients  lasting  longer  than  28  days  even  upon  dose  reduction  of 
study drug, which were not harmful to the patient or was typical, and could be transient during the 
management of concomitant disease (e.g. diabetes mellitus). In such situations, stopping of study 
medication might not be appropriate and this new section could avoid that such patients had to be 
withdrawn from study for medically unjustifiable reasons. 
 
To  clarify  that  strong  CYP3A4  inhibitors  and  QT  interval  prolonging  agents  are  considered  as 
prohibited concomitant medications during the whole duration of the study. 
 
 
To include retrospective collection of Sokal risk category at diagnosis parameters. 
To  introduce  additional  guidance  for  Investigators  to  differentiate  between  patients  who 
discontinued certain clinical trial protocol elements (e.g., discontinued study treatment, or some or 
all visits etc.), who withdrew consent or who were lost to follow-up. 
Other changes in study conduct 
There were no changes that occurred in the study conduct. 
Changes in planned analysis 
The  original  report  and  analysis  plan  (RAP  Module  3)  was  finalized  and  approved  on  02-Apr-2014, 
which was aligned with protocol Section 10 (including protocol amendment 1). 
The  RAP  Module  3  was  amended  (Amendment  1)  on  22-Sep-2015  before  the  database  lock  for  the 
primary analysis, with the following main changes in the planned analysis. 
  Added analysis descriptions for the exploratory analyses to identify potential predictive factors for 
successful TFR. 
  Updated  reporting  of  deaths  to  also  describe  causes  of  deaths  (and  not  only  number  of  deaths) 
post study discontinuation in the Survival follow-up period. 
 
Provided descriptions on summarizing the data for PROs and healthcare resource utilization. 
The  RAP  Module  3  was  amended  (Amendment  2)  on  01-Feb-2016  before  the  database  lock  for  the 
primary analysis, with the following main changes in the planned analysis: 
  Clarified that in analyses  comparing consolidation  to TFR, only the first year  of TFR  will  be  taken 
into account to allow fair comparison between the 2 periods; 
  Removed the EQ-5D-5L health index score from planned CSR analyses as it would not be relevant 
to compute it for the entire study population, but rather only if needed for a specific country/region 
population and adapted to this particular country/region; 
  Modified  the  criteria  of  evaluable  PK  trough  samples  for  the  Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  Set  (PAS) 
according to PK dosing and sampling date/time; 
  Acknowledged  the  fact  that  the  Sokal  risk  score  data  may  not  be  available  for  a  significant 
proportion  of  patients  at  the  time  of  primary  analysis  and  that  it  may  not  allow  evaluating  the 
impact of Sokal risk group on the primary endpoint. 
On  24-Mar-2016,  after  the  database  lock,  the  RAP  Module  3  was  amended  (Addendum  1)  with  the 
following main changes in the planned analyses: 
  Correct the formulas for calculating the severity score and interference score for MDASI-CML. 
Assessment report  
EMA/313746/2017  
Page 19/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Added  exploratory  analyses  to  further  characterize  the  recurrence,  time  to  appearance  and 
duration of AEs in the grouping musculoskeletal pain.

Ancillary analyses 
Analysis of identifying predictors for successful TFR 
Successful TFR is defined according to the primary endpoint definition (patients in MMR at 48 weeks of 
TFR). Various analyses were done to evaluate the impact of potential predictive factors on the primary 
endpoint (in the FAS population, all patients who entered the TFR phase). In the patients who entered 
the  TFR  phase  (FAS),  between  study  entry  and  entry  in  the  TFR  phase,  there  is  by  protocol  a  fixed 
duration  of  52  weeks  during  which  all  patients  in  FAS  had  to  remain  on  nilotinib  treatment  and 
minimum  residual  disease  before  entering  in  the  TFR  phase.  This  means  that  the  effect  of  1)  the 
duration of prior nilotinib treatment up to  study  entry, and 2) of the time from  the first MR4.5  up to 
the time of study entry on whether successful TFR occurred is equivalent to the effect of the time up to 
TFR  entry.  Therefore,  the  conclusions  regarding  the  impact  of  these  factors  as  analyzed  up  to  study 
entry can be transposed to that of the same factors up to the TFR entry. 
  Multivariate  logistic  regression  analysis  for  successful  TFR  with  age,  gender,  duration  of  prior 
nilotinib  treatment  and  time  since  first  MR4.5  until  study  entry  as  explanatory  variables,  did  not 
provide evidence of strong predictors of  successful  TFR.  The  Stepwise  selection  model (with level 
of  0.1  for  both  variable  entry  and  stay)  selected  only  one  variable,  time  since  MR4.5  until  study 
entry, as a potential predictor of successful TFR (odds ratio 1.027 [95% CI: 1.003, 1.051], [Study 
I2201-Table 14.2-5.5]). 
 
The duration of prior nilotinib treatment before study entry was not shown to be a strong predictor 
of  successful  TFR  in  this  study,  probably  due  to  the  fact  that  the  durations  of  prior  nilotinib 
treatment did not differ substantially among all patients in FAS (mean [SD]: 32.6 [8.14] months. 
  Baseline  demographics  and  prior  disease  characteristics  were  also  summarized  for  patients  who 
achieved  successful  TFR  vs.  patients  who  did  not  achieve  successful  TFR  but  it  did  not  show  a 
notable difference between patients achieving successful TFR and patients without successful TFR.  
In summary, no strong predictor of successful TFR  was identified. There was no notable difference in 
baseline  demographics,  disease  characteristics  and  prior  treatment  or  prior  response  characteristics 
between patients who had successful TFR and patients who did not have successful TFR. 
BCR-ABL mutations in patients who lost MMR during the TFR phase 
A thorough inventory of clinical BCR-ABL compound mutations associated with TKI resistance reported 
in  the  published  literature  identified  a  limited  list  of  12  kinase  domain  positions  comprising  the 
majority of compound mutations, which are referred to as key positions. The key residues in the native 
BCR-ABL kinase  domain are: M244,  G250,  Q252, Y253, E255, V299, F311,  T315,  F317, M351, F359, 
and  H396  (Zabriskie  et  al  2014).  Eighty-nine  patients  (46.8%)  lost  MMR  during  the  TFR  phase. 
Amongst  these  89  patients,  72  patients  had  at  least  one  evaluable  mutational  analysis  performed. 
Amongst the 72 patients evaluable for mutational analysis, the BCR-ABL mutation of F359V (mutation 
of less sensitivity to nilotinib) was detected in one patient (0.5%). 
  STUDY A2408 (ENESTop) 
(ENESTop)  was  a  Phase  II,  single-arm,  multi-center  study,  evaluating  the  feasibility  of  TFR  post  TKI 
treatment in patients with BCR-ABL1-positive CML-CP. This study was designed to determine the rate 
of successful TFR in patients who achieved and maintained MR4.5 on nilotinib.

Figure 4 Study design in Study A2408 (ENESTop) 
Objectives/Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  variable  in  Study  A2408  was  the  proportion  of  patients  without  loss  of  MMR  or 
confirmed loss of MR4 within 48 weeks following the start of the nilotinib TFR phase. 
The main secondary efficacy endpoints assessed in the current analysis were: 
 
TFS after the start of the TFR phase 
  MR4.5 rate at 48 weeks after start of the TFR phase 
 
Proportion  of  patients  who  regained  MR4.5  and  MR4  within  the  first  48  weeks  of  the  NTRI 
phase

 
Proportion  of  patients  who  regained  MR4.5,  MR4  and  MMR  within  the  first  48  weeks  of  the 
NTRI phase in patients who re-start treatment due to loss of MMR in the TFR phase 
 
Time  required  to  regain  MR4  and  MR4.5  in  patients  who  re-initiated  treatment  due  to  either 
confirmed loss of MR4 or loss of MMR in the TFR phase 
 
Time  required  to  regain  MMR,  MR4  and  MR4.5  in  patients  who  re-initiated  treatment  due  to 
loss of MMR 
 
PFS after the start of the TFR phase 
  OS after the start of the TFR 
  Kinetics of BCR-ABL/ABL transcript levels after restart of nilotinib treatment 
The exploratory efficacy endpoints assessed in the current analysis are: 
  Association between baseline demographics/disease history and primary endpoint 
 
Patient-reported outcomes and resource utilization 
  BCR-ABL mutations in patients who lost MMR or confirmed loss of MR4 during the TFR phase. 
Sample size 
The study was designed with a 90% power to test the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis was that the 
rate of no documented confirmed loss of MR4, no loss of MMR and no re-initiation of nilotinib therapy 
in the first 48 weeks after nilotinib TFR was 10% or less with an alternative hypothesis that this rate is 
>10%. 
The sample size was based on an exact test for single proportion to test the null hypothesis; H0: p ≤ 
0.10,  where  p  was  the  rate  of  no  documented  confirmed  loss  of  MR4,  no  loss  of  MMR  and  no  re-
initiation of nilotinib therapy in the  first 48 weeks after nilotinib cessation. If  the  true rate p ≥  0.25, 
then with one-sided alpha level of 2.5% and a power of 90%, a minimum of approximately 70 patients 
were  required  to  enter  the  TFR  phase  after  the  NTCS  phase.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  ENESTcmr 
study, approximately 30% of patients were to experience a loss of MR4.5 once it was achieved during 
the NTCS phase. Considering an additional 10% attrition rate, it was assumed that approximately 40% 
of the patients would  not be eligible  for TFR after  52  weeks of the NTCS phase. Thus, approximately 
117 patients were to be enrolled into this study. 
The study was expected to close at the earlier of the date on which 70 patients had entered the TFR 
phase or the date on which 117 patients had been enrolled in the NTCS phase. This study had enrolled 
163  patients  by  13-Dec-2013,  the  date  when  the  patient  enrollment  was  closed.  With  163  patients 
enrolled,  assuming  approximately  40%  of  enrolled  patients  who  had  MR4.5  at  study  entry  would  not 
be eligible for starting the TFR phase, there were to be approximately 98 patients who entered TFR. 
Assuming  that  the  true  rate  of  no  documented  confirmed  loss  of  MR4,  no  loss  of  MMR  and  no  re-
initiation of nilotinib therapy in the first 48 weeks after nilotinib cessation was 25%, with a 10% rate 
for the null hypothesis, the study had  a 97%  power with  1-sided alpha level of  2.5% to test the  null 
hypothesis. The power increased by 7% based on the 163 enrolled patients compared to the originally 
planned 90% power based on the 117 enrolled patients with all the other assumptions for the power 
calculation being the same.

This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the FAS. The primary endpoint (rate of successful TFR) 
was  presented  together  with  an  exact  95%  Clopper-Pearson  confidence  interval  (CI).  The  null 
hypothesis  was  to  be  rejected  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  was  greater  than  0.10.  The  primary 
analysis was repeated on the PPS as a supportive analysis. All demographic data, medical history and 
current medical conditions at study start, and disease history were summarized and listed for the FAS 
and Safety set. 
The rate of molecular responses by certain time points after starting the TFR phase as well as the rate 
of  patients  who  re-achieved  molecular  responses  (MR4.5/MR4/MMR)  with  nilotinib  retreatment  were 
presented together with an exact 95% Clopper-Pearson CI. Kinetics of BCR-ABL transcript levels after 
re-start  of  nilotinib  therapy  were  presented  by  a  box-plot  of  BCR-ABL  ratio  over  time  and  were  also 
summarized over time. 
All time to event endpoints including duration of treatment re-initiation  required to  regain MMR,  MR4 
and MR4.5, TFS, PFS and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method and were presented 
by KM plots. 
All  nilotinib  concentrations  were  listed  using  the  Safety  set.  The  following  is  the  list  of  analyses 
conducted to investigate the nilotinib concentration- efficacy relationship: Scatter plot of BCR ABL ratio 
(%) at 48 weeks of the NTCS phase vs. trough nilotinib concentration and the TFR phase entry status 
was  summarized  using  contingency  table  by  trough  nilotinib  concentration  categories  (by  quartiles). 
Safety set was used for all safety analyses. Since the primary interest of the study was to assess the 
benefit of stopping treatment, particular analysis was performed on the patients who entered the TFR 
phase  (TFR  Safety  set):  those  analyses  focused  on  the  differences  of  the  incidence  of  safety  events 
(AEs and lab abnormalities) between the NTCS phase and the first 48-weeks of the TFR phase to allow 
fair comparison

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The study protocol was amended two times. The key features of each amendment are given below: 
Amendment 1 (released on 07-Jul-2013): At the time of the amendment the study was in thestartup 
phase; 21 patients had been enrolled as of 25-June-2013. 
Primary purpose for the amendment included but not limited to: 
 
To allow patient access to both clinical and commercial drug supply. Source of the drug supply was 
expected  to  change  during  the  course  of  the  study.  However,  all  drug  supply  used  in  the  study 
continued  to  be  provided  free  to  the  patients  by  Novartis.  In  addition,  protocol  changes  were 
implemented to address questions identified during the study startup as below: 
 
To clarify the pregnancy language to ensure consistency across all nilotinib clinical trials including 
instructions on how to deal with pregnancy during the TFR phases. 
  Allowed  for  extension  of  screening  window  from  14  days  to  28  days  to  allow  more  time  for 
screening procedures. 
 
To clarify duration of imatinib therapy prior to switch to nilotinib. 
  Allowed screening of patients from AMN107A2405 (ENESTcmr) or Study AMN107EIC01 (ENEST1st) 
study for participation in this study without having first to discontinue from either study. Patients 
would  discontinue  from  these  studies  only  if  they  were  confirmed  eligible  for  the  current  study 
AMN107A2408.  This  practice  was 
in  compliance  with  the  International  Conference  on 
Harmonization (ICH) Topic E8 guidelines as it constituted a “justified exception one of which being 
that the patients in both these studies were treated and will continue to be treated with the same 
drug,  nilotinib  (Tasigna®),  at  the  same  dose/same  formulation  in  the  approved  indication  as  in 
current study AMN107A2408. 
  Allowed  earlier  re-screening  of  patients  by  reducing  re-screening  window  from  12  weeks  to 
approximately four weeks ± 7 days  
  Clarification  provided  to  ensure  monitoring  of  AEs  for  30  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study 
treatment or last day of the TFR/TFR-2 phase. In addition, SAEs were to be followed until clinical 
improvement, resolution, or stabilization. 
  Biomarker and pharmacogenetics sections were included 
  Study title was updated to include the pathology (CML added) of study population. 
 
Information added to the definition of adequate end organ function for direct bilirubin 
  Clarification was provided to serious adverse event (SAE) reporting regarding safety assessment

Amendment  2  (11-Aug-2014):  At  the  time  of  this  amendment,  163  patients  were  screened  for 
enrollment as of December 2013 
The main purposes of the amendment were: 
 
To include cholesterol testing in the assessment schedule. Elevations in total serum cholesterol 
and  low  density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  was  observed  very  commonly  (more  than  10%)  in 
patients  treated  with  nilotinib  and  commonly  (between  1  to  10%)  in  patients  treated  with 
imatinib.  Most  of  the  cholesterol  elevations  were  grade  1  (>ULN  -  300  mg/dL;  >ULN  -  7.75 
mmol/L) or 2 (>300 – 400 mg/dL; >7.75 - 10.34 mmol/L), and some elevations were present 
prior  to  initiation  of  CML  therapy.  Lipid  profiles  including  total  cholesterol,  LDL-C  and  HDL-C 
were  assessed  during  the  conduct  of  this  study.  If  test  results  warranted  intervention, 
Investigators  followed  their  local  standards  of  practice  or  treatment  guidelines  which 
recommended  treatment  even  for  grade  1  cholesterol  elevation.  Before  prescribing  a  lipid-
lowering medication, the possibility of drug-drug interactions was considered due to moderate 
inhibitory effect of nilotinib on CYP3A4 isoenzyme that was involved in the metabolic pathway 
of some statins (Hydroxy Methyl-Glutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase inhibitors).  
 
To  provide  a  harmonization  on  dose  reductions  guidelines  across  Novartis-sponsored  nilotinib 
study  protocols.  Hence  the  dose  reduction  guidelines  for  the  following  non-hematologic 
toxicities were updated: 
  Hepatobiliary 
 
Ischemic cardiovascular evaluation for grade 2 and above to Hold therapy and refer patient for 
assessment;  patients  with  grade  2  resumed  treatment  at  lower  dose  on  event  improving  to 
grade 1and patients with grade 3/4 discontinued treatment. 
 
Pancreatitis grade 4: change from “Hold therapy” to “Stop therapy”. 
  Cardiac QTcF prolongation to include instructions for Investigator to follow local guidelines for 
management of QTcF. 
  Cardiac “Other”: change from “Hold therapy” to “Stop therapy”. 
 
To incorporate guidance for the management of: 
  Serum cholesterol increased. 
  Blood glucose increased. 
  Other cardiac risk factors. 
 
 
Ischemic vascular or ischemic cardiovascular events occurring in patients treated with nilotinib. 
To incorporate precaution of use for antacid drugs to be aligned with Tasigna® Food and Drug 
Administration Prescribing Information and European Medicines Agency SmPC. 
 
To define ischemic vascular and ischemic cardiovascular events as AEs of special interest, and 
their reporting. 
 
The duration of the TFR phase was clarified to be up to 192 weeks after the last patient enters 
TFR throughout the protocol. 
  Modifications to clarify the biomarker assessments 
 
To clarify the specification of the statistical alternative hypothesis H1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/313746/2017  
Page 33/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To inform the IRBs/IECs/REBs and HAs about over-recruitment and its impact on the stopping 
rules applied to the first 48 weeks after start of TFR and on the sample size calculation. 
 
To clarify the biochemistry laboratory parameter for calcium 
  Modification of the Pharmacokinetic endpoint and corresponding PK blood collection log 
  Retrospective Sokal risk score collection was included 
 
To correct discrepancies and add clarifications within the protocol. 
Changes in planned analysis 
The  original  report  and  analysis  plan  (RAP  Module  3)  was  finalized  and  approved  on  30-June-2014, 
which was aligned (including protocol amendment 1). 
The  RAP  Module  3  was  amended  (Amendment  1)  on  25-Sep-2015  before  the  database  lock  for  the 
primary analysis, with the following main changes in the planned analysis: 
  Added analysis description  for the  exploratory  analyses  to identify potential predictive  factors 
for successful TFR; 
  Updated reporting of deaths describing causes of deaths (and not only number of deaths) post 
study discontinuation in the Survival follow-up period; 
  Added analysis to assess patient proportions who had MR4.5 at 48 weeks without reinitiation of 
nilotinib therapy, after starting the TFR phase. 
The  RAP  Module  3  was  amended  (Amendment  2)  on  31-Jan-2016  before  the  database  lock  for  the 
primary analysis, with the following main changes in the planned analysis: 
  Clarified that in analyses comparing consolidation to TFR, only the first year of TFR was taken 
into account to allow fair comparison between the 2 periods; 
  Removed  the  EQ-5D-5L  health  index  score  from  planned  CSR  analyses  as  it  would  not  be 
relevant to compute it for the entire study population, but rather only if needed for a specific 
country/region population and adapted to this particular country/region; 
  Modified  the  criteria  of  evaluable  PK  trough  samples  for  the  PAS  according  to  PK  dosing  and 
sampling date/time; 
  Acknowledged  the  fact  that  the  Sokal  risk  score  data  may  not  be  available  for  a  significant 
proportion of patients at the time of primary analysis and that it may not allow evaluating the 
impact of Sokal risk group on the primary endpoint; 
  Clarified that a patient with a detectable p190 BCR-ABL transcript or any other minor BCR-ABL 
transcript  (any  atypical  transcript  for  CML  patients,  different  than  the  p210  major  BCR-ABL 
transcript  which  is  the  typical  transcript  for  the  CML  patients)  are  considered  as  a  non-
responder at all time-points in the study. 
 
The RAP Module 3 was amended (Addendum 1) on 22-Mar-2016 after the database lock for the 
primary analysis, with the following main changes in the planned analysis:  
  Correct the formulas for calculating the severity score and interference score for MDASI-CML. 
  Added exploratory analyses to further characterize the AE grouping musculoskeletal pain. The 
protocol  mentions  that  PFS  on  study  including  the  survival  follow-up  period  and  OS  will  be 
determined separately in patients who did not enter the TFR phase. However, this analysis was 
not  included  in  the  RAP  as  the  main  focus  is  for  patients  who  entered  the  TFR  phase.  In 
Assessment report

addition, this analysis is irrelevant as no patients progressed and only one patient died, in the 
NTCS phase.

Ancillary analyses 
Association between baseline demographics/disease history and primary endpoint 
Analysis of predictors for successful TFR is defined according to the primary endpoint definition (no loss 
of  MMR  or  confirmed  loss  of  MR4  by  48  weeks  of  TFR).  Various  analyses  were  done  to  evaluate  the 
impact of  potential  predictive  factors  on the  primary  endpoint, in  the  FAS  population,  for  all  patients 
who  entered  the  TFR  phase.  In  the  patients  who  entered  the  TFR  phase  (FAS),  between  study  entry 
and entry in the TFR phase, there is by protocol a fixed duration of 52 weeks during which all patients 
in FAS had to remain on nilotinib treatment and maintained MR4.5 before entering in the TFR phase. 
This means that the effect of 1) the duration of prior  TKI treatment up to study entry, and 2) of the 
time  from  the  first  MR4.5  up  to  the  time  of  study  entry  on  whether  successful  TFR  occurred  is 
equivalent to the eff ect reported up to the time of TFR entry. Therefore, the conclusions regarding the 
impact of these factors as analyzed up to study entry can be transposed to that of the same factors up 
to TFR entry. 
  Multivariate logistic  regression  analysis  for  successful  TFR  with  age,  gender, duration  of  prior 
TKI treatment, time to first MR4.5 on nilotinib prior to study entry, time since first MR4.5 until 
study  entry,  and  starting  dose  level  in  the  consolidation  phase  as  explanatory  variables,  did 
not provide evidence of strong predictors of successful TFR. 
 
The  Stepwise  selection  model  (with  level  of  0.1  for  both  variable  entry  and  stay)  selected 
gender  (odds  ratio  0.523  [95%  CI:  0.251,  1.087])  and  time  since  MR4.5  until  study  entry 
(odds  ratio  1.019  [95%  CI:  0.999,  1.040])  as  the  2  factors  most  correlated  with  successful 
Assessment report

TFR, but for both of them, the CI for the odds ratio included one and they are not considered 
as clear predictive factors. 
 
The  median  duration  on  TKI  treatment  prior  to  study  entry  was  similar  in  patients  who  had 
successful TFR vs patients who did not have successful TFR (74.5 vs 75.9 months). 
 
The median duration on nilotinib treatment prior to study entry was higher in patients who had 
successful TFR vs patients who did not have successful TFR (44.9 vs 36.1 months). Similarly, 
the  time  since  first  achievement  of  MR4.5  until  study  entry  was  higher  in  patients  who  had 
successful TFR vs patients who did not have successful TFR (27.10 vs 17.20 months). 
There  was  no  notable  difference  in  baseline  demographics,  disease,  and  prior  treatment  or  prior 
response  characteristics  between  patients  who  had  successful  TFR  and  patients  who  did  not  have 
successful TFR. 
STUDY A2405 (ENESTcmr) 
This study was already assessed in detail in an earlier variation procedure (EMEA/H/C/00798/II/0061) 
and thus, discussion focus only one main issues relevant for this application. Overall, this study adds 
no further data on the discontinuation issue and thus, supportive value is only low. 
For these reasons study ENESTcmr will not be re-assessed, but high-level results will be provided.   
Study A2405 (ENESTcmr) was an open label, randomized study of nilotinib vs. standard imatinib 
conducted between 2009 and 2012 in adult patient with CML-CP. The primary objective of the study 
was to compare the rate of confirmed best cumulative CMR within the first year of study therapy with 
nilotinib or imatinib. Furthermore, this trials aims to assess the kinetics of CMR achieved and to 
compare PFS in both treatment arms as key secondary endpoints. This study was assessed and 
discussed extensively already during a previous procedure in 2014 (EMEA/H/C/00798/II/0061). 
Therefore, only a short summary is provided here. The dose and schedule used (400 mg bid) was 
consistent with the approved second-line indication.  
Patients initially randomized to imatinib were offered the opportunity to crossover to nilotinib therapy 
following treatment failure (loss of CCyR, loss of MMR, or progression to AP/BC), or 2 years after CMR 
had not been attained. No crossover was provided for patients randomized to the nilotinib arm. 
Yearly updates of the efficacy and safety results were planned for the duration of the study. The 
efficacy data presented in the submission is up to 48 months which was marking the end of the 
treatment period by protocol.

Figure 6 Study design 
*Cross-over from imatinib to nilotinib was permitted only at the end of year 2 for patients without CMR 
The secondary endpoints were to be tested at the 5% significance level, only when the primary 
endpoint was significant at the 5% level. As the primary endpoint was not significant, for the 
secondary efficacy endpoints reported, p-values are provided for descriptive purposes only and were 
not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The rate of the CMR at Month 6, 12, 18, and 24 during the first 
two years of treatments and the rate of confirmed best cumulative CMR by month 24 and the rate of 
maintained CMR at Month 12 and 24 were presented along with the 95% confidence interval by 
treatment groups. 
The primary endpoint was the rate of confirmed best cumulative CMR during first 12 months. The rate 
of confirmed best cumulative CMR during the first 12 months was 12.5% in the nilotinib arm and 5.8% 
in the imatinib arm. The study did not meet the primary endpoint as the p-value for the two-sided CMH 
test was p=0.1083, which was above the required significance level of 0.05. However, with an odds 
ratio (OR) of 2.096 in favor of nilotinib, these results were suggestive of the potential clinical benefit 
associated with nilotinib in this patient population. 
A 2-sided stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test was used to test the null hypothesis (of no 
difference in the rate of confirmed best cumulative CMR between treatment arms) at the 0.05 
significance level.

The insufficient difference between the two treatment groups and lack of statistical significance at the 
early 12-month time point was attributed to the kinetics of molecular response which could not have 
been accurately predicted at the time of the study conception/design. 
In accordance with the predefined statistical procedure described in the protocol, the secondary 
endpoints would only formally be tested at the two-sided α-level of 0.05 if the primary analysis 
reached statistical significance at Month 12. As the primary efficacy endpoint did not attain statistical 
significance, all other endpoints reported in the clinical study report were presented with nominal p-
values, unadjusted for multiplicity, which are not reported here. 
Longer-term follow-up of the primary endpoint provided compelling results at the 24-month analysis 
with an odds ratio of 2.103 (95% CI: 0.932, 4.742) and rates of confirmed CMR were 23.1% and 
10.7%, respectively for the nilotinib and imatinib arms. Given the kinetics of molecular response, this 
analysis provides a more appropriate assessment of the two treatments under evaluation than the 
primary efficacy endpoint up to Month 12 [Study A2405 Table 14.2-5.4]. By 36 and 48 months, 
considering the responses up to crossover, nilotinib continued to have a higher number of patients 
achieving these deep molecular responses relative to continuing treatment. 
Confirmed best cumulative CMR and unconfirmed MR4.5 (ITT) 
The below analysis followed intent-to-treat (ITT) principle, i.e., even if patients achieved response only 
after  crossover  from  imatinib  to  nilotinib,  the  response  was  credited  to  the  arm  to  which  they  were 
randomized  (imatinib).  In  line  with  the  study  design,  it  impacts  results  from  Month  36  and  48  time 
points, where the difference between treatment arms tends to diminish because of patients originally 
randomized to imatinib who improved after switching to nilotinib.  
Rates of confirmed best cumulative CMR up to Month 24 were 23.1% and 10.7%, respectively, for the 
nilotinib and imatinib treatment arms, with an OR of 2.103 (95% CI: 0.932, 4.742). 
Rates of confirmed best cumulative CMR up to 36 months were 27.9% and 20.4%, for the nilotinib and 
imatinib  arms,  respectively,  with  an  OR  of  1.458  (95%  CI:  0.754,  2.821).  Rates  of  confirmed  best 
cumulative  CMR  up  to  48  months  were  30.8%  and  20.4%,  for  the  nilotinib  and  imatinib  arms, 
respectively, with an OR of 1.660 (95% CI: 0.869, 3.171). 
The  rate  of  best  cumulative  MR4.5  by  Month 24  was  45.2%  in  the  nilotinib  arm  and  24.3%  in  the 
imatinib  arm  (OR=2.682,  95%  CI:  1.436,  5.009),  by  Month  36  the  rates  were  49.0%  and  38.8% 
respectively, and by Month 48 the rates were 53.8% and 44.7%, respectively.

For patients who were not known to have CMR at baseline, the rates of unconfirmed CMR by 24 month 
were 32.7% and 18.0%, respectively, for the nilotinib and imatinib treatment arms, by Month 36 the 
rates  were  40.6%  and  31.0%,  respectively,  and  by  Month  48  the  rates  were  44.6%  and  33.0%, 
respectively. 
For  patients  who  were  without  MR4.5  at  baseline,  the  rate  of  unconfirmed  MR4.5  by  24  months  on 
study  was  42.9%  in  the  nilotinib  arm  and  20.8%  in  the  imatinib  arm,  by  Month  36  the  rates  were 
46.9% and 36.5%, respectively, and by Month 48 the rates were 52.0% and 41.7%, respectively. 
Confirmed CMR and unconfirmed MR4.5 up to crossover 
On or before the 48-month PCR assessment, a total of 46 patients in the imatinib arm crossed over to 
nilotinib.  Considering  imatinib  patients  who  achieved  confirmed  CMR  for  the  first  time  after  the 
crossover to nilotinib as non-responders to imatinib, the rate of best cumulative confirmed CMR up to 
48 months was 30.8% in the nilotinib arm and 11.7% in the imatinib arm (OR=3.069; 95% CI: 1.450, 
6.495). 
Out  of  46  crossed  over  patients,  9  patients  (19.6%)  achieved  confirmed  CMR  for  the  first  time  after 
crossover to nilotinib. 
The rate of cumulative unconfirmed MR4.5 up to 48 months (up to cross-over) was 53.8% in nilotinib 
arm and 32.0% in the imatinib arm (OR=2.578; 95% CI: 1.442, 4.607). 
The rate of cumulative unconfirmed CMR up to crossover was 46.2% in nilotinib arm and 21.4% in the 
imatinib arm (OR=3.313; 95% CI: 1.773, 6.192). 
Cumulative molecular response up to cross-over by baseline molecular response status showed that a 
higher proportion of patients in nilotinib arm achieved various levels of response compared to imatinib 
arm, when patients did not have the corresponding level of response at baseline Table 4-6.

Progression-free survival 
Two patients (1.9%) in the nilotinib treatment arm and one patient (1.0%) in the imatinib arm had a 
PFS  event.  In  the  nilotinib  arm,  one  patient  died  due  to  acute  myocardial  infarction,  another  patient 
died due cardiopulmonary failure and in the imatinib arm one patient died due to prostate cancer with 
bone metastasis [Study A2405-Table 14.2-2.4.1.1]. 
No patients progressed to AP/BC. No PFS events were reported after crossover. 
Event-free survival (EFS) 
A  total of  17  patients experienced  an  EFS  event  (loss  of  CCyR,  loss  of  MMR or  death),  with  a  higher 
number in the imatinib arm (10 patients) compared to the nilotinib arm (7 patients). Of these patients, 
five patients experienced loss of MMR and two patients died in the nilotinib arm. In the imatinib arm, 
the  observed  EFS  events  (up  to  crossover)  were  loss  of  MMR  (four  patients),  loss  of  CCyR  (three 
patients) and death (one patient) and two patients experienced loss of MMR following crossover [Study 
A2405-Table 14.2-3.2.2]. The reasons for deaths in both arms are explained in the PFS description. 
Overall survival 
Three patients (2.9%) in the nilotinib arm and three  patients (2.9%) in the imatinib arm died during 
the study [Study A2405-Table 14.2-2.6.1]. 
Time to achievement of response 
Kaplan-Meier  estimate  of  median  time  to  achievement  of  response  was  consistently  earlier  for  the 
patients  in  the  nilotinib  arm  (MR4.5:  24  months,  95%  CI:  14.8,  47.5;  CMR:  38.5  months,  95%  CI: 
26.3, 49.2), while in the imatinib arm the KM estimate of median time to achieve MR4.5 and CMR was 
49.0 months (95% CI: 34.3, 49.0) and 49.0 months (NA, NA), respectively [Study A2405-Table 14.2-
3.2.1], [Study A2405-Figure 14.2-3.1.3], and [Study A2405-Figure 14.2-3.1.1].

ENESTfreedom was a multicentre phase II, single-arm, multi-center nilotinib TFR study in patients with 
BCR-ABL1 positive CML-CP, who had achieved durable minimal residual disease (MRD) status on first-
line nilotinib treatment. The primary objective was to determine the percentage of patients who were 
in  MMR  at  48  weeks  after  starting  the  TFR  phase.  The  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  clearly  defined  a 
patient population suitable for this study. Patients were treated with 300 mg bid or 400 mg once daily 
in case of tolerability issues, which is in line with clinical practice, however most of the patients were 
treated with 300 mg bid. The protocol amendments and changes in the planned analyses are few and 
minor;  none  of  them  was  considered  critical.  The  median  age  was  55  year  and  only  20%  of  the 
patients  are  above  65  years.  The  majority  of  the  patients  were  Caucasian,  ECOG  0  or  1.  Only  one 
patient was ECOG 2. The majority of the patients had a missing Sokal risk score, which was collected 
retrospectively after protocol amendment 3. In conclusion, the baseline characteristics showed a well-
treated, fit and relatively young patient population. 
The ENESTop was a phase  II, single-arm, open-  label  study of  TFR in CML-CP patients after achieving 
sustained  MR4.5  on  nilotinib.  The  inclusion  criteria  defined  a  patient  population  that  had  received  at 
least 4 weeks of initial therapy with imatinib, and then switched to nilotinib for at least 2 years. Patients 
must have been treated with a TKI for at least 3 years. Patients with a confirmed MMR4.5 prior switch 
to  nilotinib  were  excluded.  Patients  were  not  to  have  documented  MR4.5  at  the  time  of  switch  from 
imatinib  to  nilotinib.  The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  proportion  of  patients  without  loss  of 
MMR or confirmed loss of MR4 within 48 weeks following nilotinib cessation. The MAH had defined one 
primary  and  several  secondary  and  exploratory  endpoints.  The  cut-off  level  in  relation  the  primary 
endpoint was 10%. The protocol amendments and changes in the planned analysis were not considered 
critical. There were only few critical protocol deviations. The median age was 56 year and only 27% of 
the patients are  above 65 years. The majority  of  the patients are  Caucasian,  ECOG 0 or 1. The Sokal 
risk  score,  which  was  collected  retrospectively  after  protocol  amendment,  was  missing  in  41.3%.  In 
conclusion,  the  baseline  characteristics  showed  a  well-treated,  fit  and  relatively  young  patient 
population. The median duration of imatinib treatment prior to nilotinib treatment was 23.5 months in 
the ENESTop study, ie. almost 2 years.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
ENESTfreedom 
The primary endpoint was not met, thus the study in principle failed due to a lower limit of the 95%CI 
below  the  50%  cut-off.  However,  as  seen  in  relation  to  the  secondary  endpoints,  several  interesting 
observations  were  made.  A  large  proportion  of  the  patients  maintained  a  deep  molecular  response 
(MMR4.5),  and  about  50%  of  the  patients  never  relapsed  suggesting  a  potential  for  cure.  If  relapse 
occur,  it  occurred  within  24  weeks  in  the  majority  of  the  patients.  When  relapsed  patients  are  re-
treated,  98.8%  of  them  regained  MMR  by  24  weeks.  This  is  reassuring.  PFS  and  OS  data  are 
immature. 
ENESTop:  
The  study  met  its  primary  objective,  showing  TFR  of  57.9%,  where  the  95%CI  is  48.85-66.7%.  The 
MAH  has  chosen  10%  as  the  reference  value  above  which  the  lower limit  of  the  95%  CI    had  to be, 
which is lower than the cut-off level in the ENESTfreedom study (50%), however, since the aim in this 
study  is  “no  documented  loss  of  MR4,  no  loss  of  MMR”  the  lower  cut-off  is  justified.  The  majority  of 
patient  that  enter  TFR  phase,  but  eventually  relapse,  do  so  within  24  weeks.  About  50%  of  patients 
continue  to  be  in  the  TFR  phase  for  more  than  90  weeks.  This  is  very  interesting  from  a  clinical 
perspective.

The  majority  of  patients  regained  MR4  and  MR4.5  within  24  weeks,  and  by  48  weeks  100%  of  the 
patients  have  regained  MR4  and  94.8%  have  regained  MR4.5.  Thus,  it  seems  that  MMR  can  be 
achieved upon retreatment after a TFR phase. As in the ENESTfreedom study, the PFS and OS data are 
immature. 
With respect to the data currently available it is of upmost importance to have well defined criteria for 
the safe and most promising discontinuation of TKI on the one hand, and, on the other, to increase the 
number of patients available for such an attempt. The MAH has proposed stringent eligibility criteria to 
be used in discontinuation of the drug, as well as guidance for frequent monitoring of BCR-ABL levels. 
The  criteria  are  consistent  with,  some  being  even  more  conservative,  than  the  ones  used  in  the 
previously published TKI treatment discontinuation studies. The criteria are accordingly reflected in the 
SmPC  sections  4.2  and  4.4.  The  MAH  has  evaluated  previously  published  studies  in  CML  patients. 
Among  studies  evaluating  TKI  discontinuation  (Saussele  2016,  Hughes  2016),  only  one  patient 
progressed  to  BC.  In  the  ENESTfreedom  and  ENESTop  trials,  none  of  the  patients  who  re-initiated 
nilotinib therapy progressed to AP/BC. Characterizing patients who are at increased risk of relapse and 
how to monitor them is crucial. However, the MAH could not identify potential prognostic factors, when 
multivariate  analysis  was  performed.  The  risk  of  developing  resistance  to  the  drug  (ie.  non-
responsiveness)  when  re-treated  was  evaluated.  In  the  published  literature  as  well  as  in  the  study 
trials, the vast majority of patients who needed re-treatment with TKI did so during the first year after 
discontinuation,  and  most  commonly  during  the  first  6  months  after  discontinuation.  The  patients 
responded  well  and  achieved  MMR  in  a  timely  manner.    By  evaluating  the  published  literature,  no 
patient has developed TKI resistance in TFR that was detected during TKI re-initiation. Further data in 
the  present  ENESTfreedom  and  ENESTop  trials  did  not  suggest  any  resistance  mechanisms  of  the 
treatment-free interval. 
There is continuously growing evidence, which shows that TKI discontinuation could be considered, if 
the patients are and have been in deep molecular remission for certain period of time, and that patient 
that relapse, can be safely brought back to remission upon re-initiation of TKI treatment. International 
guidelines (NCCN guidelines Version 2.2017, CML) provide the option of treatment discontinuation with 
TKI, if strict criteria are fulfilled.  From a clinical point of view a discontinuation or interruption of TKI 
treatment  is  considered  a  benefit  to  the  patients,  provided  that  a  treatment  free  period  conveys  no 
increased  risk  to  the  patient,  the  suggested  criteria  are  used,  and  the  patients  are  being  closely 
monitored  by  BCR-ABL  for  a  whole  life  time.  Updated  data  from  96  weeks  support  the  primary 
findings, however, further data generated over significantly longer periods than currently available are 
still  needed  and  should  be  provided  post-approval  (see  Risk  Management  Plan).  Even  during  long-
lasting TFR, persistent CML stem cells are detectable using genomic analyses, but currently the clinical 
implications of dormant yet detectable leukemic stem cells is unknown and an active area of research. 
Despite  a  growing  body  of  evidence  supporting  the  use  of  genomic  PCR  methods  to  detect  patient-
specific  gene  fusions,  analysis  of  BCR-ABL  at  the  DNA  level  has  been  limited  and  thus,  detecting 
persistent CML stem cells using these methods do currently not trigger any change in the management 
of  the  disease.  However,  the  MAH  should  collect  data  on  gene  signature  on  patients  that  relapse  on 
TFR compared to patients that relapse on treatment (see Risk Management Plan). 
Discontinuation  of  treatment  may  be  considered  in  eligible  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  (Ph+) 
CML  patients  in  chronic  phase  who  have  been  treated  with  nilotinib  at  300  mg  twice  daily  for  a 
minimum of 3 years if a deep molecular response is sustained for a minimum of one year immediately 
prior to discontinuation of therapy (SmPC section 4.2). 
The  measures  proposed  below  are  adequate  in  view  of  the  remaining  uncertainties  about  long-term 
Assessment report

outcomes. A precautionary approach with intensive monitoring until the remaining uncertainties can be 
addressed is justified (see Risk Management Plan). 
Eligible  patients  who  discontinue  Tasigna  therapy  must  have  their  BCR-ABL  transcript  levels  and 
complete  blood  count  with  differential  monitored  monthly  for  one  year,  then  every  6  weeks  for  the 
second  year,  and  every  12  weeks  thereafter.  Monitoring  of  BCR-ABL  transcript  levels  must  be 
performed  with  a  quantitative  diagnostic  test  validated  to  measure  molecular  response  levels  on  the 
International  Scale  (IS)  with  a  sensitivity  of  at  least  MR4.5  (BCR-ABL/ABL  ≤0.0032%  IS)  (SmPC 
section 4.2). 
For  patients  who  lose  MR4  (MR4=BCR-ABL/ABL  ≤0.01%IS)  but  not  MMR  (MMR=BCR-ABL/ABL 
≤0.1%IS)  during  the  treatment-free  phase,  BCR-ABL  transcript  levels  should  be  monitored  every  2 
weeks  until  BCR-ABL  levels  return  to  a  range  between  MR4  and  MR4.5.  Patients  who  maintain  BCR-
ABL  levels  between  MMR  and  MR4  for  a  minimum  of  4  consecutive  measurements  can  return  to  the 
original monitoring schedule (SmPC section 4.2). 
Patients who lose MMR must re-initiate treatment within 4 weeks of when loss of remission is known to 
have occurred. Nilotinib therapy should be re-initiated at 300 mg twice daily or at a reduced dose level 
of 400 mg once  daily if the patient had  a dose  reduction prior to discontinuation of therapy. Patients 
who  re-initiate  nilotinib  therapy  should  have  their  BCR-ABL  transcript  levels  monitored  monthly  until 
MMR is re-established and every 12 weeks thereafter (SmPC section 4.2). 
Taken together, the present data are clinically relevant and are reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 
and 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Additional expert consultation 
Following  the  CHMP  request,  a  Scientific  Advisory  Group  meeting  was  convened  on  5  April  2017  to 
provide advice on the following list of questions: 
1.  Please  discuss  the  potential  value  of  treatment-free  remission  (TFR)  as  currently 
proposed  compared  to  continued  treatment  in  Ph+  CML  patients  in  the  present  treatment 
landscape. 
In  principle,  avoiding  unnecessary  treatment,  especially  if  not  well-tolerated,  is  an  important  goal  in 
the treatment of CML. Avoidance of toxicity may be an important goal in up to about 30% of patients. 
However,  one  needs  to  balance  this  goal  against  the  risk  of  additional  anxiety  due  to  a  perceived 
higher  risk  of  loss  of  remission,  as  well  as  the  burden  of  intensive  monitoring,  which  may  result  for 
example in frequent visits to the hospital and frequent laboratory examinations. It is also important to 
promote the option of treatment-free periods to CML patients and relevant healthcare professionals in 
a  balanced  way,  avoiding  the  misconception  that  unless  MR4.5  or  better  is  achieved  (to  allow 
treatment-free  remission)  this  is  perceived  by  patient  as  “treatment  failure”.  Thus,  adequate 
information about benefits, risks, uncertainties, follow-up and patient preferences will play a key role 
in the treatment decision. 
From a physician’s perspective, while avoiding unnecessary treatment is an important goal, the burden 
of  intensive  monitoring  also  requires  careful  consideration,  taking  into  account  the  need  to  use  high 
quality laboratory testing of molecular response  according to agreed international standards, such as 
the  laboratory  recommendations,  developed  as  part  of  the  European  Treatment  and  Outcome  Study 
Assessment report  
EMA/313746/2017  
Page 49/81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(EUTOS) for CML, which may not be readily available everywhere in Europe.  
2.  Please  discuss  if  the  precautionary  measures  provided  in  the  SmPC  are  adequate  with 
regard to the monitoring of disease activity and the re-initiation of nilotinib.  
Currently, the measures proposed are adequate in view of the remaining uncertainties about long-term 
outcomes (longest follow-up is currently about 12  years for  nilotinib; about 16 years for imatinib) as 
well  as  the  need  not  to  deviate  significantly  from  the  measures  used  in  the  available  studies.  A 
precautionary approach with intensive monitoring until the remaining uncertainties can be addressed is 
justified.  However,  efforts  to  optimise  treatment  duration  and  follow-up  should  continue  (see  answer 
to question No. 3). 
Strict  adherence  to  the  proposed  measures  should  be  encouraged  since  there  is  a  risk  that  practical 
considerations may lead to less intense monitoring than is needed and ultimately in delays in detecting 
loss  of  remission.  The  risk  management  plan  should  consider  if  measures  are  needed  to  address 
potential issues with monitoring compliance. 
Formally introducing treatment-free periods for nilotinib with changes to the SmPC is likely to have an 
impact on treatment duration and follow-up of other TKI inhibitors that currently do not allow such an 
approach  as  part  of  the  SmPC.  In  principle,  this  approach  might  be  applicable  to  other  TKIs  and  in 
particular  to  imatinib.  However,  there  may  be  small  differences  between  TKIs  (for  instance  shorter 
time to and greater depth of response may allow shorter treatment duration before stopping) and also 
differences  in  the  burden  of  long-term  toxicity  motivating  the  treatment-free approach  (for  instance, 
the increase in vascular events with nilotinib is continuous with no plateau). Thus, direct extrapolation 
of the approach among TKIs is not possible.   For imatinib and to a lesser  extent dasatinib, academic 
studies addressing TFR are available/ongoing and are likely to influence clinical practice albeit without 
the  rigour  of  regulatory  assessment  and  agreed  risk  management  measures.  Whether  this  should be 
addressed at the level of clinical guidelines and/or regulatory assessment (even if based on published 
data)  can  be  debated  (clinical  guidelines  already  include  detailed  recommendations  for  follow-up) 
although  a  rigorous  regulatory  assessment  is  encouraged  in  view  of  the  evolving  level  of  evidence, 
remaining uncertainties, and the potential need to introduce adequate risk-minimisation measures.  
3. Please discuss whether the data that we already have are sufficient, or whether the CHMP 
should  pursue  the  generation  of  additional  clinical  data  to  confirm  the  longer-term 
outcomes in patients who discontinue treatment when in deep molecular response. 
Further  data  are  needed  with  longer  follow-up  (beyond  48  months),  to  confirm  the  reported  plateau 
without event after 48 months, and to further optimise duration of treatment and follow-up, including 
further research into dynamics of relapse, factors associated with loss of remission, and development 
of nilotinib resistance. Studies should be run examining potential differences in patterns of resistance 
on  TKI  treatment  (including  TKI-induced  clonal  selections)  -  or  off  TKI  treatment;  detailed  biological 
characterizations  (e.g.,  molecular;  drug  transporter  expression  and  other  biological  pathways)  of  the 
on/off  treatment  relapses  is  essential  to  add  value  in  understanding  the  potentially  different 
mechanisms in these two scenarios. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Both ENESTfreedom and ENESTop studies provided results indicating that it is possible to discontinue 
TKI treatment despite the fact that OS and PFS data are immature.  Discontinuation of treatment may

be  considered  in  eligible  Philadelphia  chromosome  positive  (Ph+)  CML  patients  in  chronic  phase  who 
have been treated with nilotinib for a minimum of 3 years if a deep molecular response is sustained for 
a minimum  of one year immediately prior to discontinuation  of therapy. The  precautionary  measures 
included  in  the  SmPC  are  adequate  with  regard  to  the  monitoring  of  disease  activity  and  the  re-
initiation of nilotinib. 
Results from both ENESTfreedom and ENESTop studies do not merit an extension of the indication as 
initially proposed by the MAH, but are acceptable, to be reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 
of the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
About  10400  patients  and  healthy  volunteers  have  been  exposed  in  clinical  studies.  Post-marketing 
experience is available from more than 39300 patients with CML since approval in 2007.  
Additional  safety  data  is  based  on  data  from  215  patients  in  Study I2201  (ENESTfreedom),  163 
patients  from  Study A2408  (ENESTop),  and  101 patients  from  Study A2405  (ENESTcmr)  at  the 
recommended 400 mg bid (second-line treatment) or 300 mg bid dosing regimen (first-line treatment) 
of nilotinib. Of note in Study I2201, patients who did not tolerate the dose of 300 mg bid were treated 
at  400  mg  once  daily,  and  in  Study A2408  patients  who  achieved  and  sustained  MR4.5  on  any  dose 
other than 300 mg/400 mg bid of nilotinib prior to study entry, were also included in the study.  
This  overall  safety  evaluation  is  based  on  data  from  patients  who  have  been  exposed  to  nilotinib. 
Study I2201  and  Study A2408  enrolled  a  highly  selected  population  of  patients  who  had  tolerated 
nilotinib  for  at  least  two  years  before  entering  the  consolidation  phase  for  one  additional  year  of 
exposure.  The  safety  data  collected  during  the  consolidation  phase  may  thus  be  different  from  the 
known safety profile of nilotinib in newly diagnosed patients who are initiating treatment with nilotinib. 
However, this one-year consolidation period is a good reference to compare the patient’s safety during 
the TFR phase with that during the previous nilotinib therapy. Study A2405 (ENESTcmr) enrolled highly 
selected patients who had demonstrated tolerability to imatinib and had been treated with imatinib for 
at least two years prior to study entry, whereas the patients randomized to nilotinib were exposed to 
nilotinib for the first time in the context of the clinical trial. Collectively, the data allows for assessment 
of  the  safety  profile  of  nilotinib,  provides  safety  information  regarding  AEs  that  may  occur  upon 
discontinuation of nilotinib, and assesses the safety of treatment re-initiation in patients requiring such 
therapy.

NTCS and TFR phases (TFR Safety set) 
As  of  the  data  cut-off  the  median  duration  of  exposure  to  nilotinib  in  the  NTCS  phase  was  52.14 
weeks, range: 8.6 to 57.6 weeks. 95.3% of the patients were exposed to nilotinib for ≥ 48 weeks. The 
median  duration  of  exposure  to  nilotinib  in  the  NTCS  phase  for  patients  who  entered  the  TFR  phase 
(TFR Safety set) was also 52.14 weeks (range: 50.0 to 57.6 weeks). As of the data cut-off, the median

duration of the TFR phase (from the start day of the TFR phase to the last day of the TFR phase) was 
49.4 weeks (range: 8.4 to 85.0 weeks).  The median duration of TFR phase (restricted to the first 48 
weeks of the TFR phase) was 48.0 weeks (range: 8.4 to 48.0 weeks). 
Most patients in the NTCS phase, and patients in the NTCS phase who entered the TFR phase, received 
the  actual  dose  that  was  close  to  the  assigned  daily  dose.  The  median  actual  dose  intensity  in  the 
NTCS phase was 600 mg/day (25-75th percentile: 599.2 to 600.0 mg/day). 
As  of  the  data  cut  off,  the  median  duration  of  exposure  to  nilotinib  for  patients  in  the  NTRI  phase 
(n=86) was 39.6 weeks (range: 5.0 to 69.7 weeks). 
Study A2408 (ENESTop) 
Exposure to nilotinib was considered to be appropriate to allow for an adequate assessment of safety. 
Since the primary interest of this study is to understand the benefit of treatment discontinuation with 
nilotinib  in  patients  having  achieved  deep  molecular  response,  particular  emphasis  is  placed  on  the 
median duration of the TFR phase, which is considered appropriate to allow assessment of safety upon 
nilotinib discontinuation.

Study A2405 (ENESTcmr) 
Up  to  the  cut-off  date,  the  median  time  on  treatment  (from  first  day  of  treatment  to  last  day  of 
randomized treatment) was 47.2 months in the nilotinib arm; and 37.0 months and 26.7 months in the 
400 mg and 600 mg once daily cohorts of the imatinib arm. 
Median  time  on  treatment  with  nilotinib  after  crossover  (from  first  day  of  nilotinib  treatment  after 
crossover to last day of treatment) for crossover patients (n=46) was 662.5 days (21.8 months).  
Up to the cut-off date, the median actual dose intensity was 775.7  mg/day in the nilotinib treatment 
arm; and 400.0 mg/day and 600 mg/day in the two dose cohorts of the imatinib treatment arm. The 
median actual dose intensity was 790.4 mg/day for the patients that crossed over to nilotinib.

higher incidence (≥ 3% difference) in the NTCS phase (TFR Safety set) compared to the TFR phase 
were:  constipation  and  rash  (+4.8%  difference  each);  and  eczema  and  gastroenteritis  (+3.2% 
difference  each).  Grade  3/4  AEs  reported  in  at  least  two  patients  in  the  NTCS  phase  were: 
hypertension  (3.2%),  lipase  increased  (2.4%),  pneumonia  (1.6%),  atrial  fibrillation  (1.6%),  and 
hepatotoxicity  (1.6%).  The  preferred  terms  that  were  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  (≥  3% 
difference)  in  the  TFR  phase  compared  to  the  NTCS  phase  (TFR  Safety  set)  were:  arthralgia 
(+16.7%  difference),  myalgia  (+9.5%  difference),  musculoskeletal  pain  (+5.5%  difference), 
increased weight (+4.8% difference), cough (+4% difference), and oral herpes (+3.2% difference). 
Grade  3/4  AEs  reported  in  at  least  two  patients  in  the  TFR  phase  were:  hypertension  (1.6%); 
cellulitis (1.6%), and carpel tunnel syndrome (1.6%).

The  AEs  reported  that  were  reported  at  a  higher  incidence  by  preferred  term  in  the  nilotinib  group 
compared  to  the  imatinib  group  (≥  10%  difference)  were:  headache  (+30%  difference),  rash 
(+25.8%  difference),  pruritus  (+29.7%  difference),  dry  skin  (+19.8%  difference),  constipation 
(14.9% difference), elevated ALT (+13.9% difference), myalgia (+12% difference), alopecia (10.9% 
difference), and pain in extremity (10% difference). The most common grade 3/4 event reported in 
association with nilotinib was lipase increased (in 11.9% of patients) (Table 5-9). 
In the group of patients who had crossed-over to nilotinib, the most frequently occurring AE was rash 
in 9 patients (19.6%) followed by ALT increased, headache and pain in extremity in 8 patients (17.4%) 
each. The AE headache in two patients was of grade 3/4 severity.

Study A2405 (ENESTcmr) 
Serious  adverse  events  were  reported  more  frequently  for  patients  receiving  treatment  with  nilotinib 
(21 patients, 20.8% vs. 16 patients, 15.5% for the imatinib group). The incidence of specific SAEs was 
low  for  both  treatment  groups  and  all  events  reported  were  single  cases  with  the  exception  of  atrial 
fibrillation, prostate cancer, cellulitis, nephrolithiasis and pleural effusion, where two patients from the 
imatinib treatment group reported this event. 
Deaths 
Study I2201 (ENESTfreedom) 
A total of five patients died during the study by the data cut-off date; two (0.9%) patients died during 
the NTCS phase, one (0.5%) patient died during the TFR phase, and two (2.3%) patients died during 
the NTRI phase. The reasons for deaths were cardiac arrest (one patient) and completed suicide (one 
patient) during the NTCS phase, death-unknown reason (one patient) during the TFR phase, and acute 
myocardial infarction (one patient), and death-unknown reason (one patient) during the NTRI phase.

Study A2408 (ENESTop) 
One patient (0.6%) died during the course of the study. This death occurred on treatment during the 
NTCS phase of the study and the cause of death was arterial hemorrhage. 
Study A2405 (ENESTcmr)  
Of  the  204  patients  in  the  Safety  Set,  as  of  the  24-month  cut-off  date,  one  patient  in  the  nilotinib 
group  died  due  to  an  event  of  acute  myocardial  infarction  within  28  days  following  study  drug 
discontinuation. The event was of grade 4  severity and suspected to be related to study drug by the 
Investigator. 
Up to the 48-month cut-off date, two additional on treatment deaths have been observed (one in the 
nilotinib group due to cardiopulmonary failure and one in the imatinib group due to metastases to the 
peritoneum.  Three  patients  died  more  than  28  days  after  study  drug  discontinuation  (one  in  the 
nilotinib  group  due  to  liver  failure  from  light  chain  deposition  and  two  in  the  imatinib  group  due  to 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer with bone metastasis).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study I2201 (ENESTfreedom) 
 The  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  infrequent  (4.7%  of  all  the  patients  in  the  Safety  set).  The 
incidence of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation reported in the NTCS phase and the NTRI phase 
were  2.8%  and  4.7%,  respectively.  The  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  reported  in  the  NTCS  phase 
were  cardiac  arrest,  muscular  weakness,  cerebrovascular  accident,  agitation,  eczema,  xanthelasma, 
intermittent claudication, and peripheral arterial occlusive disease.  
The AEs leading to discontinuation reported in the NTRI phase were coronary artery disease, uvulitis, 
chest  pain,  blood  cholesterol  increased,  hyperglycemia,  breast  cancer,  intermittent  claudication,  and 
peripheral  arterial  occlusive  disease.  The  incidence  of  AEs  requiring  dose  adjustment  or  interruption 
reported in the NTCS phase and the NTRI phase were 5.6% and 12.8%, respectively. 
Study A2408 (ENESTop)  
The  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  infrequent  (6.1%  of  all  the  patients  in  the  Safety  set).  The 
incidence of AEs leading to study drug discontinuation reported in the NTCS phase and the NTRI phase 
were  3.1%  and  7.8%,  respectively.  The  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  reported  in  the  NTCS  phase 
were  acute  myocardial  infarction,  cerebral  infarction,  arterial  hemorrhage,  hypertension,  and 
peripheral  arterial  occlusive  disease.  The  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  reported  in  the  NTRI  phase 
were  necrosis,  hypercholesterolemia,  adenocarcinoma,  pleural  effusion,  and  pleural  fibrosis.  The 
incidence  of AEs requiring dose  adjustment  or interruption reported in the NTCS phase  and the NTRI 
phase were 17.2% and 15.7%, respectively.

Study A2405 (ENESTcmr) 
The  proportion  of  patients  reporting  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  was  significantly 
higher in the nilotinib group (21 patients, 20.8%) compared to the imatinib group (7 patients, 6.8%). 
With  the  exception  of  lipase  increased  which  was  reported  in  two  patients,  all  other  preferred  terms 
were  reported  in  only  one  patient  each.  In  the  nilotinib  group,  11  patients  (10.9%)  experienced  a 
grade  3/4  event  resulting  in  discontinuation  of  study  drug.  In  the  imatinib  group,  5  patients  (4.9%) 
were  discontinued  due  to  a  grade  3/4  AEs.  After  crossover,  20  patients  (43.5%)  had  an  AE  that 
required  dose  adjustment  or  dose  interruption,  of  which  10  patients  (21.7%)  had  a  grade  3/4  event 
[Study A2405-Table 14.3.1- 4.1.2]. In 15 patients (32.6%) (7 patients grade 3/4) these events were 
suspected to be related to study drug. 
Post marketing experience 
The post-marketing experience with nilotinib was reviewed and reported by the MAH and discussed at 
CHMP on an ongoing basis during the last 11 PSURs /data cut-off: 31 Jan 2016). 
Relevant  publications  containing  important  new  safety  information  published  during  the  reporting 
interval  were  retrieved  from  the  three  publicly  accessible,  bibliographic  databases  Medline,  Embase 
and  Biosis  Previews.  The  search  criteria  was  inclusive  of  pregnancy  outcomes  (including  termination) 
with  no  adverse  outcomes,  use  in  pediatric  populations,  compassionate  supply,  named  patient  use, 
lack of efficacy, asymptomatic overdose, abuse or misuse, medication error where no AEs occurred, or 
“near misses” and important non-clinical safety results.  
The results of the literature review did not reveal any  important articles. Although there are  multiple 
publications of musculoskeletal pain after imatinib discontinuation, there was a single presentation by 
Berger  et  al  at  ASH  2015  that  reported  two  patients  with  musculoskeletal  pain  after  nilotinib 
discontinuation. 
Based on the review, except for the single oral presentation, there were no new or significant safety 
findings related to Tasigna published in the peer-reviewed scientific or made available as unpublished 
manuscripts during the reporting interval. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of nilotinib is well-known after many years on the market. In the current setting with 
TFR, the interesting issue is not the exposure in itself, but the opposite. Nonetheless, patients are 
exposed for considerable period before entering the TFR phase. The exposure and non-exposure (in 
TFR) are deemed appropriate to compare the safety, when patients are treated with nilotinib and when 
patient are in TFR. 
In general, there are more AEs during the NTCS phase compared with the TFR phase, however, the 
number of Grade 3/4 AEs is similar between the two phases in the ENESTfreedom, while slightly higher 
in the NTCS phase in the ENESTop study. All AEs occurred with a lower or similar frequency in the TFR 
phase, except for AEs related to muscles and extremity pain.  Musculoskeletal pain which included 
arthralgia, pain in the extremity, myalgia, bone pain and spinal pain are observed in CML patients, 
when TKIs are discontinued. This could be a withdrawal symptom. The MAH evaluated the published 
literature; most of the data are only short communications. The frequency ranged from 5% to 46%, 
the wide range may be due to differences in study design, outcome definitions etc., although about 1/3 
Assessment report

of the patients had symptoms. The median time to first occurrence was 1-6 weeks (in the published 
literature) and 8.3 and 9.5 weeks in the ENESTfreedom and ENESTop trials respectively. The pains 
were easily manageable in the clinic, either resolved spontaneously or by using analgesics. The 
possible mechanism of musculoskeletal pain after TKI discontinuation is not clear. By reviewing the 
literature, the MAH referred to data, indicating that increased values of the circulating Platelet-Derived 
Growth Factor Receptor Beta (PDGFβ) were reported in patients who experienced musculoskeletal pain 
after TKI discontinuation. It is not clear if PDGFβ was the causative factor or rather a marker of pain in 
these patients. Another report hypothesized that the cKIT and PDGF might be involved.  
Dose tapering was not allowed in the two trials. However the nilotinib treatment exposure data during 
the consolidation phase were similar in the patients with vs. patients without musculoskeletal pain in 
the TFR phase. Re-initiation of nilotinib treatment was only performed in case of molecular relapse and 
never in order to manage the musculoskeletal pain.   
From a clinical point of view a discontinuation or interruption of TKI treatment is considered a benefit 
to  the  patients,  provided  that  a  treatment  free  period  conveys  no  increased  risk  to  the  patient,  the 
suggested criteria are used, and the patients are being closely monitored by BCR-ABL for a whole life 
time.  Updated  data  from  96  weeks  support  the  primary  findings,  however,  further  the  MAH  should 
collect and provide data on late relapses on a yearly basis from the ongoing studies ENESTfreedom and 
ENESTop (see Risk Management Plan). Risk of resistance (in TFR) is classified as potential risk in the 
risk  management  plan.  Even  during  long-lasting  TFR,  persistent  CML  stem  cells  are  detectable  using 
genomic analyses, but currently the clinical implications of dormant yet detectable leukemic stem cells 
is unknown and an active area of research. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting the use of 
genomic  PCR  methods  to  detect  patient-specific  gene  fusions,  analysis  of  BCR-ABL  at  the  DNA  level 
has been limited and thus, detecting persistent CML stem cells using these  methods do currently not 
trigger any change in the management of the disease. However, the MAH should collect data on gene 
signature in patients who relapse on TFR compared to patients who relapse on treatment and provide 
data on a yearly basis (see Risk Management Plan).  
There seems to a higher likelihood of SAEs in the NTCS in ENESTop, but this is not the case in the 
ENESTfreedom. The number of SAEs is in general low, and no apparent pattern can be observed. 
There are very few deaths. However, there is no indication of increased risk of death during TFR.  
With regard to AESIs, a similar pattern is observed in both studies: the most striking difference is seen 
with regard to fluid retention and musculoskeletal pain, where a considerable higher numbers are seen 
in the TFR phase. This seems to be a withdrawal symptom of TKIs in CML patients.  
After discontinuation of Tasigna therapy within the framework of attempting treatment-free remission 
(TFR), patients may experience musculoskeletal symptoms more frequently than before treatment 
discontinuation, e.g., myalgia, pain in extremity, arthralgia, bone pain, spinal pain or musculoskeletal 
pain (SmPC, section 4.8). 
In ENESTfreedom study with newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase (N=190), 
musculoskeletal symptoms were reported within a year of Tasigna discontinuation in 24.7% versus 
16.3% within the previous year on Tasigna treatment (SmPC, section 4.8). 
If a woman who is being treated with nilotinib is considering pregnancy, treatment discontinuation may 
be considered based on the eligibility criteria for discontinuing treatment. There is a limited amount of 
data on pregnancies in patients while attempting treatment-free remission (TFR). If pregnancy is 
planned during the TFR phase, the patient must be informed of a potential need to re-initiate 
treatment with Tasigna during pregnancy (SmPC section 4.6).

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of nilotinib is well known for many years. All AEs occurred with a lower or similar 
frequency in the TFR phase, except for AEs related to muscles and extremity pain.  Musculoskeletal 
pain is observed in CML patients, when TKIs are discontinued, the mechanism is not clearly 
understood, but they were usually well manageable in the clinical setting.   
It is fully acknowledged that otherwise discontinuation could be helpful in reducing the impact of 
adverse events. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 16 was acceptable.  
However, following the SAG oncology held on the 5th of April 2017 and further discussion on the risk of 
developing resistance off-therapy, the CHMP requested the inclusion of 2 post-authorisation safety 
studies to the pharmacovigilance plan in order to collect and provide data on late relapses on a yearly 
basis from ongoing studies ENEST-op and ENEST-freedom and to collect and provide data on gene 
signature on patients that relapse on TFR compared to patients that relapse on treatment. 
The aim of those 2 studies is to address the newly added safety concern “risk of resistance (in TFR)”, 
which has been included as missing information. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 19.1 with the following content:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC have been updated based on the results of 
Studies CAMN107I2201 and CAMN107A2408. Particularly, a new warning with regard to special 
monitoring of Ph+ CML patients in chronic phase who have achieved a sustained deep molecular 
response has been added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. Additional changes to the labelling were implemented to comply with the latest QRD 
template version 10. 
During the procedure the MAH withdrew the PI changes related to Study CAMN107A2405 (ENESTcmr) 
that were proposed as part of the application as the CHMP was of the view that it was not relevant for 
these data to be reflected in the SmPC.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Study I2201 (ENESTfreedom) showed a rate of successful TFR at 48 weeks of 51.6% (95% CI: 44.2, 
58.9). The majority of patients who lost MMR or discontinued the TFR phase did this early during the 
first  24  weeks  of  the  TFR  phase.  The  KM  estimated  TFS  rate  at  48  weeks  is  53.1%  (95%  CI:  45.7, 
59.9).  In  patients  who  lost  MMR  in  the  TFR  phase,  nilotinib  re-treatment  was  started  in  86  patients, 
Assessment report  
EMA/313746/2017

but one patient failed to regain MMR. The time to regain MMR was rapid with a KM estimated median 
time of 7.9 weeks (95% CI:  5.1, 8.0).  No patient progressed to CML-AP/BC  or had  a haematological 
relapse of CML-CP.  
In Study A2408 (ENESTop) the rate of successful TFR at 48 weeks was 57.9% (95% CI: 48.8, 66.7). 
The majority of patients who lost MMR or had a confirmed loss of MR4 did so during the first 24 weeks 
of the TFR phase. The KM estimated  TFS  rate at  48 weeks is 58.7% (95% CI: 49.6, 66.7). Fifty-one 
patients restarted treatment due to confirmed loss of MR4 or loss of MMR in the TFR phase, of whom 
48  patients  (94.1%)  achieved  again  MR  4  or  MR4.5.    Three  patients  failed  in  regaining  MR4.5.  The 
time to regaining MR4 and MR4.5 was rapid: KM estimated median of 12.0 weeks (95% CI: 8.3, 12.7) 
and 13.1 weeks (95% CI: 12.4, 16.1) respectively. No patient progressed to CML-AP/BC.  
Updated data from 96 weeks confirmed the findings at 48 weeks.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There  is  a  concern  about  the  patients  that  did  not  respond  adequately  when  re-exposed  to  nilotinib 
upon relapse. The MAH has not been able to identify any prognostic factors that could predict relapses 
and specifically not early relapses and, even more important, resistant relapses. Due to small numbers 
of  late  relapses,  it  was  not  possible  to  study  the  potential  prognostic  factors  for  early  versus  late 
relapses. The main concern is related to the risk of resistance development off therapy.    
Based on the above, the CHMP concluded  that  the MAH should  collect and provide data late relapses 
on  yearly  basis  from  ongoing  studies  ENEST-op  and  ENEST-freedom  and  should  also  collect  data  on 
gene  signature  on  patients  that  relapse  on  TFR  compared  to  patients  that  relapse  on  treatment  on 
yearly basis (see Risk Management Plan). 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  of  nilotinib  is  well-known  after  many  years  on  the  market  no  new  or  unexpected 
safety signals were observed during the use of nilotinib. In the current setting with TFR, the interesting 
issue is not the exposure in itself, but the opposite. Increasing rates of musculoskeletal pain after TKI 
discontinuation  seems  to  be  the  most  import  new  signal  identified  from  trials  ENEST  freedom  and 
ENESTop.  This  AE  seems  to  be  probably  a  class  specific  AE  and  was  observed  more  frequently  after 
nilotinib discontinuation than during  treatment; however they were usually manageable in the clinical 
setting.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Musculoskeletal  pain  is  observed  in  CML  patients,  when  TKIs  are  discontinued.  This  could  be  a 
withdrawal  symptom,  but  the  mechanism  behind  is  not  clearly  understood.  Updated  safety  showed 
that  the  incidence  of  musculoskeletal  pain  is  significantly  reduced  from  48  to  96  weeks.  In  addition, 
such symptoms were easily managed in the clinical setting, and they resolved either spontaneously or 
by using analgesics.  
Taking into account that the introduction of specific TKIs like imatinib has tremendously improved  the 
prognosis  of  CML,  it  is  important  not  to  jeopardise  this  benefit  by  discontinuation  the  treatment. 
Assessment report

However,  provided  the  use  of  the  suggested  eligibility  criteria  and  careful  monitoring  the  BCR-ABL 
levels for the whole life time, it is considered a safe and manageable procedure in at least some CML-
CP patients.  
The main concern is related to the risk of resistance development off therapy which is discussed above 
and reflected in the risk management plan.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Both ENESTfreedom and ENESTop showed that discontinuation of treatment with nilotinib should be 
considered in eligible Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) CML patients in chronic phase who have 
been treated with nilotinib for a minimum of 3 years if a deep molecular response is sustained for a 
minimum of one year immediately prior to discontinuation of therapy.

After discontinuation of nilotinib therapy, patients may experience musculoskeletal symptoms more 
frequently than before treatment discontinuation, e.g., myalgia, pain in extremity, arthralgia, bone 
pain, spinal pain or musculoskeletal pain. However these symptoms were easily managed in the clinical 
setting, and they resolved either spontaneously or by using analgesics. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The introduction of TKIs have changed the natural history of CML from being a life-threatening disease 
which  could  only  be  cured  by  an  allogeneic  haematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  with  the  risks it 
entail, to  a  chronic  disease  with  practically  a  normal  life  expectancy.  The  patients  are  however often 
faced with life-long treatment with TKIs.  
As seen by the data, about 50% of the patients stay in MMR and do not relapse, those who relapse do 
so  within  24  weeks,  and  if  patients  are  re-treated,  deep  durable  remission  can  be  achieved  in  the 
majority of patients for more than 90 weeks.  
The CHMP considered the opportunity for TFR safe and interesting from a clinical perspective, making 
it  possible  to  eliminate  acute  and  chronic  side  effects  due  to  TKIs,  minimizing  drug  interactions  and 
also making reproduction possible, without exposure to TKIs. Patients that enter the TFR phase seem 
to  have  withdrawal  symptoms.  These  are  manageable  and  mainly  related  to  musculoskeletal  pain. 
Notwithstanding,  whilst  the  benefit  of  a  treatment  discontinuation  are  evident,  ascertainment  that  a 
treatment free period conveys no increased risk to the patient is paramount. Several issues have been 
addressed.  In  the published  literature,  the  vast  majority  of  patients  who  needed  re-treatment of  TKI 
did so during the first year after discontinuation, and most commonly during  the first 6 months after 
discontinuation. These data confirmed, that the patients responded well to re-treatment with TKI, with 
the vast majority achieving MMR in a timely manner and no patients has developed TKI resistance in 
TFR  that  was  detected  during  TKI  re-initiation.  The  data  submitted,  did  not  suggest  the  resistance 
mechanisms  to  be  a  consequence  of  the  treatment-free  interval.  When  multivariate  analyses  were 
performed for successful TFR at 24 weeks, with age, gender, duration of TKI treatment prior to study 
entry, and time since first MR4.5 until study entry, the MAH could not identify any prognostic factors 
that could predict relapses, and specifically not early relapses. Due to small numbers of late relapses, 
it was not possible to study the potential prognostic factors for early versus late relapses. 
Published data on time to AP/BC in patients with poor control of CML are very limited, and confined to 
trials investigating TKIs in CML patients who did not have an optimal response /failure or intolerance to 
imatinib.  Only  a  few  patients  progressed  to  AP/BC.  The  risk  of  progression  to  AP/BC  is  increased  in 
CML  patients  receiving  second  line  TKIs  as  compared  to  newly  diagnosed  patients.  The  question 
whether  TKI-treated  CML  patients,  including  those  with  treatment  discontinuation  periods  can  be 
considered  cured  still  need  to  be  addresses  by  data  generated  over  significantly  longer  periods  than 
currently  available.  Even  during  long-lasting  TFR,  persistent  CML  stem  cells  are  detectable  using 
genomic analyses, but currently the clinical implications of dormant yet detectable leukemic stem cells 
is unknown and an active area of research. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting the use of 
genomic  PCR  methods  to  detect  patient-specific  gene  fusions,  analysis  of  BCR-ABL  at  the  DNA  level 
has been limited and thus, detecting  persistent CML  stem cells using these  methods do currently not 
trigger  any  change  in  the  management  of  the  disease.  However,  inclusion  of  genomic  analyses  of 
those patients who discontinued successfully currently for 12 months should be considered in order to 
allow a better separation of patients who may have a higher relapse risk during the follow up.  
The  MAH  initially  proposed  changes  in  sections  4.1,  4.2,  4.4,  4.8  and  5.1  of  the  SmPC  based  on  the

results  from  the  three  studies.  However,  the  results  from  both  ENESTfreedom  and  ENESTop  do  not 
justify a change in 4.1, but should be reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 6.6 of the SmPC based on the results from:  
- Study CAMN107I2201 (ENESTfreedom: A Phase II, single-arm study evaluating nilotinib treatment 
discontinuation (treatment-free remission (TFR)) in newly-diagnosed patients with Philadelphia 
chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) who achieved a 
sustained deep molecular response; 
- Study CAMN107A2408 (ENESTop): A Phase II, single-arm study evaluating nilotinib treatment 
discontinuation (treatment-free remission (TFR)) in patients with Ph+ CML-CP who achieved a 
sustained deep molecular response on nilotinib treatment after switching from imatinib treatment; 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Additional changes to the labelling were 
implemented in line with the latest QRD template version 10.  
An updated RMP, version 19.1, was agreed during the procedure. 
The group of variations leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this group of variations. In particular the 
EPAR module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

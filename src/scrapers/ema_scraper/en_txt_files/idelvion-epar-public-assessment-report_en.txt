2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Haemophilia B is a rare bleeding disorder which is x-linked recessively inherited and affecting ~1 in 
20,000 of the male population worldwide (Konkle et al. 2000).  The disease is caused by coagulation 
factor IX (FIX) deficiency and classified based on remaining in vitro clotting activity, which in turn is 
closely associated with the clinical phenotype (Giangrade 2005).  
Signs and symptoms of Hemophilia B are variable; depending on severity of the factor deficiency and 
the location of the bleeding. Thereby, bleeding is characterized by spontaneous or trauma-induced 
hemorrhage into joints, muscles and soft tissues. Severe haemophilia B is characterised by 
spontaneous or traumatic bleeding episodes into soft tissues and joints, but also life-threatening 
gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding may occur. Recurrent joint bleeding may lead to chronic 
arthropathy and disability.  
Hemophilia B can successfully be managed with FIX replacement therapy. Besides of acute treatment 
of bleeding episodes, prophylactic treatment with the deficient clotting factor should be the goal of 
haemophilia therapy to preserve normal musculoskeletal function (World Federation of Haemophilia 
2013). Therapeutic formulations of FIX are available as both plasma-derived FIX (pdFIX) and 
recombinant FIX (rFIX) products for treatment. Half-life of both pdFIX and rFIX is ~18 hours and 
prophylactic treatment is usually required 2 to 3 times a week in order to achieve a significant 
reduction of bleeding episodes. 
The applicant CSL Behring has developed albutrepenonacog alfa, a recombinant human coagulation 
factor IX product designed with the aim of a prolonged half-life in order to support a longer dosing 
interval for routine prophylaxis treatment, along with effective acute treatment of bleeding episodes. 
The product is referred to either using its scientific name “recombinant fusion protein linking 
coagulation factor IX with albumin” (rIX-FP), or the company code “CSL654” throughout the 
application. The active ingredient, rIX-FP, is a purified protein derived from a Chinese Hamster Ovary 
(CHO) cell line and produced by recombinant DNA technology, generated by the genetic fusion of 
recombinant albumin to recombinant coagulation factor IX. The recombinant factor IX portion is 
identical to the Thr148 allelic form of human plasma-derived factor IX. The cleavable linker between 
the recombinant Factor IX and albumin molecules is derived from the endogenous “activation peptide” 
in native FIX. rIX-FP remains intact in the circulation until FIX is activated, whereupon albumin is 
cleaved off, releasing activated FIX (FIXa) only when it is needed for coagulation. 
Idelvion is formulated as a sterile, non-pyrogenic, preservative-free, lyophilized, pale yellow to white 
whole or cracked plug intended for intravenous administration provided in a single-use vial. Each 
single-use vial contains nominally 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU or 2000 International Units (IU) of rIX-FP 
for reconstitution with liquid diluent (Sterile Water for Injection), which is provided in glass vials (2.5 
ml sWFI: 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 IU; 5.0 ml sWFI: 2000 IU). 
The rIX-FP clinical development programme was designed to meet the requirements as set out in the 
EMA guideline on the clinical investigation of recombinant and human plasma-derived FIX products 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009).  
Idelvion is intended for the indication of the “Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with 
haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency).” Idelvion can be used for all age groups. 
The required dose for on demand treatment is determined using the following formulae: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 7/117 
 
 
 
 
 
Required dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor IX rise (% of normal or IU/dl) x {reciprocal of 
observed recovery (IU/kg per IU/dl)} 
Expected factor IX rise (IU/dl or % of normal) = Dose (IU) x Recovery (IU/dl per IU/kg)/body weight 
(kg) 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration should always be oriented to the 
clinical effectiveness in the individual case. 
For determination of adequate maintenance dose take into consideration the extended half-life of the 
product. 
The proposed posology for routine prophylaxis to prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia B, the 
recommended regimen is 35 to 50 IU/kg once weekly. Some patients who are well-controlled on a 
once-weekly regimen might be treated with up to 75 IU/kg on an interval of 10 or 14 days. 
CHMP Scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/1500/1/2010/III and EMEA/H/SA/1500/1/FU/1/2010/PA/III-corr) 
was given and has been followed by the applicant.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Idelvion is a recombinant fusion protein linking recombinant coagulation factor IX (rIX-FP) with 
recombinant human albumin and is presented as lyophilized powder in four strengths of 250, 500, 
1000 and 2000 IU to be reconstituted with sterile water for injections (WFI). The product is intended 
for intravenous injection. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The active substance of Idelvion (rIX-FP) was generated by the genetic fusion of albumin to factor IX 
(FIX) (INN: albutrepenonacog alfa). FIX complementary DNA (cDNA) was joined to human albumin 
cDNA by a FIX-derived linker sequence to obtain rIX-FP. The construct is expressed in a Chinese 
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. 
The linker sequence between FIX and albumin is derived from an endogenous FIX sequence involved in 
FIX activation, thus enabling the cleavage of the fusion protein by the same enzymes (FXIa or the 
FVIIa/tissue factor (TF)) which activate FIX during the process of blood coagulation. Thus, as a result 
of activation, active recombinant FIX (FIXa) is cleaved from the linker sequence, concomitantly 
releasing the albumin carrier moiety from FIXa.  
The FIX moiety of rIX-FP is similar to naturally occurring plasma-derived FIX and contains two N-linked 
glycosylated residues and at least two O-linked glycosylated residues. FIX has up to 12 gamma (γ) 
carboxylated glutamic acid (Gla) residues and 11 internal disulphide bonds. 
rIX-FP has an extended half-life in circulation due to linking human FIX with recombinant human 
albumin (rIX-FP).

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail in line with ICH Guideline Q11. For 
all sites involved in manufacture and testing of rIX-FP bulk drug intermediate (BDI) and active 
substance valid compliance to cGMP has been confirmed by respective certificates issued by EU 
Competent Authorities.  
The active substance manufacturing process consists of 13 steps, including fed-batch cell culture, 
column chromatography purification and concentration unit operations. The upstream cell culture 
process involves WCB vial thawing and inoculum expansion, followed by a production bioreactor. 
Following clarification a clarified harvest containing full length rIX is produced.  
The rIX is purified from the clarified harvest in several chromatographic and filtration steps and two 
dedicated virus reduction steps as follows: 
•  A first chromatography column serves as a primary capture and concentration step for the rIX 
and is effective as a viral clearance step.  
• 
• 
• 
The buffer exchange and concentration is designed to exchange the chromatography elution 
buffer and to concentrate the product. 
The solvent detergent treatment is a dedicated virus inactivation step. 
The initial downstream processing stage produces a bulk drug intermediate (BDI) which is 
stored as a frozen bulk before further manufacture into active substance.  
•  BDI is loaded onto the second chromatography column for further purification. 
• 
The eluate is loaded onto a third chromatography column to further purify the rIX. 
•  A fourth chromatography step serves as a final purification step. 
• 
• 
The eluate is concentrated and dialyzed. 
The product is filtered for virus removal. 
The active substance manufacturing process has been sufficiently described. The ranges of critical 
process parameters and routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria have been described 
for each step and are considered adequately set to control the manufacturing process.  
Origin, source, and history of the cell line development 
The CHO host cell line used to create the rIX-FP cell substrate was confirmed to be free from 
contamination by viruses, bacteria (including mycoplasma) and fungi (moulds and yeasts). Cell bank 
characterisation test reports have been provided and the integrity of the final expression vectors was 
verified.  
The methods used to construct the cell substrate, select and genetically characterise the production 
clone and prepare the research cell bank (RCB) have been provided. In line with ICH Q5B “Quality of 
biotechnological products: Analysis of the expression construct in cell lines used for production of r-
DNA derived protein products” the selection of the most productive sub-clone used to generate the 
production cell line and the generation of the RCB has been described in sufficient detail. No 
components used in the cell line construction were of animal or human origin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 9/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In line with ICH Q5D “Derivation and characterisation of cell substrates used for production of 
biotechnological/biological products” detailed reports regarding the origin of the host cell bank and its 
characteristics have been provided. Sterility of this cell bank, viability, and absence of adventitious 
agents has been demonstrated.  
In line with ICH Q5A (R1) “Quality of Biotechnological Products: Viral Safety Evaluation of 
Biotechnology Products Derived from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin” and ICH Q5D the 
comparability of the MCB, the WCB and the post production cell bank (PPCB) with respect to identity, 
the absence of adventitious agents and the genetic stability has been demonstrated.  
Raw materials, buffers, solutions and auxiliary materials (resins and filters) are of compendial quality 
or have been qualified by vendors or by the Applicant.  
Characterisation 
A detailed physico-chemical and biochemical characterisation of rIX has been performed, including 
primary, secondary and higher order structures, as well as functional properties. The expected amino 
acid sequence of the fusion construct has been fully confirmed.  
The impurity profile of rIX-FP has been investigated in detail using state-of-the-art methodology. Major 
and minor product- and process-related impurities have been identified and characterised by sensitive 
analytical methods. It is demonstrated that the manufacturing process effectively and consistently 
reduces impurities, and that rIX-FP active substance contains only low level of product- and process-
related impurities which seem to be of no risk for the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. 
Process Controls 
Critical steps 
The control strategy developed is intended to appropriately control sources of process variability such 
that the desired process performance and product quality are consistently achieved. For all operating 
parameters, activities were undertaken to understand which parameters have the greatest potential to 
impact process performance and product quality attributes (i.e. critical quality attributes (CQAs)). 
“Critical Steps” have been defined as those containing critical process parameters (CPP), in-process 
controls (IPC), and/or in-process acceptance criteria (IPAC). All steps in the rIX active substance 
manufacturing process are considered critical steps. This designation is primarily associated with 
definition of the process control strategy and subsequent verification of the process control strategy 
during verification (also referred to as process performance qualification (PPQ)). The categorization of 
process parameters has been described in detail in the Manufacturing Process Development.  
Defined ranges for identified CPP at each manufacturing step are presented as normal operating 
ranges (NOR) or proven acceptable ranges (PAR) which were determined from analysis of historical 
data, process characterisation studies and evaluation of process capabilities.  
Critical intermediates 
The Bulk Drug Intermediate (BDI) is the only intermediate in the manufacture of the active substance. 
The BDI specifications include an adequate set of test parameters for which respective method 
descriptions and validations are provided. All tested BDI batches met the acceptance criteria. The 
quality of the BDI is ensured by extended validation studies.

Process validation 
The Applicant has followed a risk- and science–based approach for process validation in line with ICH 
Q8-Q10. This Quality by Design approach is outlined in detail in the Process Validation section; relevant 
additional information is presented in the Process Development section.  
In line with the process validation guideline (EMA/CHMP/BWP/187338/2014) the manufacturing 
process development was designed to establish a commercial manufacturing process with defined input 
and output parameters. Based on the quality target product profile (QTPP) the process operating 
ranges and CQAs were defined. An assessment of parameters via a failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) 
was performed for both the rIX BDI and active substance process. The results of these FMEA risk 
assessment have been summarised in separate reports. 
Assessments of other potential sources of process variability were undertaken, including raw material, 
equipment, components, rooms/ environment, process steps, and critical utilities. In the process 
performance qualification (PPQ) the process control strategy was verified. It is demonstrated that the 
process, when operated within the defined ranges, produces rIX active substance that consistently 
meets all in-process controls, in-process acceptance criteria, additional testing requirements, and 
release specifications. PPQ runs under GMP conditions were conducted for BDI and active substance 
production process. 
The process validation also addressed the following aspects: 
i) 
The capability of the process to remove process-related impurities. Additional information on 
leachables from chromatography resins was provided.  
ii) 
Establishment of in-process hold times including “cumulative” hold times  to address process 
hygiene were validated at small and full scale, demonstrating that the hold time conditions do 
not affect product quality and safety.  
iii) 
The resin and membrane life times have been defined. Appropriate data from process validation 
studies on chromatography resins life time has been provided.  
iv) 
Confirmation that homogeneity was achieved at all mixing steps.   
Manufacturing process development  
The manufacturing process has been developed in four distinct stages, which reflected increasing 
knowledge and experience gained during development.  
The first stage involved development of an initial pilot process to manufacture the novel molecule. The 
second stage manufacturing process was adapted to better remove process-related impurities, while 
supplying the initial clinical studies and the primary product specific reference standard. The third 
stage was defined following completion of the transfer and scale-up activities to the commercial 
manufacturing sites. Material from this process was used to initiate pivotal clinical studies. During the 
pivotal clinical trials, some further manufacturing process changes were introduced and process 
validation studies were undertaken. The resulting process, incorporating the totality of the process 
development activities and validation studies, was designated as the fourth stage. The Validated 
Commercial Process is the manufacturing process intended for production of the marketed product. 
The development from the initial to the validated commercial process included several changes. 
Comparability assessment of process performance and product quality parameters demonstrated that 
the initial commercial scale process and the validated commercial process are highly similar.

Specification 
The set of analytical procedures for the control of the active substance is adequate to ensure a 
consistent purity and quality of the active substance. The parameters and their specifications have 
been mostly selected in line with ICH Q6B Note for Guidance on specifications. For each analytical 
procedure a brief method description has been provided and all methods have been validated 
according ICH Q2(R1).  
With respect to FIX potency assay activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), it is clearly specified 
which type of test kit and test system is used to measure FIX potency of this modified rFIX in routine 
batch analysis of BDI, AS and FP. More details on different test assays have been described and their 
influence on potency of this long-acting FIX is clear.  
The FIX primary standard (PRS1) is calibrated relative to the IS FIX concentrate and the secondary 
working reference standard (WRS1) is calibrated against PRS1, maintaining a link between the working 
standard and the WHO IS FIX concentrate. The labeling of rIX-FP in International Units has been 
justified. In addition, updated information has been provided for the reference materials used in the 
other active substance control tests.  
Stability 
The stability of the active substance under long-term and accelerated conditions has been investigated 
in line with ICH Q5C “Stability testing of Biotechnological/Biological products”. Real time/real 
temperature data have been presented for three commercial scale active substance batches. Stability 
data provided no evidence that quality parameters show a negative trending and the proposed shelf 
life can be accepted.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a sterile lyophilized powder presented in four strengths of 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 
IU and 2000 IU per vial. After reconstitution with sterile water for injections (sWFI), concentrations of 
100 IU/mL, 200 IU/mL and 400 IU/mL are obtained for intravenous administration. 
The finished product is aseptically filled into single-use type I glass vials of 6 mL (250 IU, 500 IU and 
1000 IU per vial strengths) or 10 mL (2000 IU per vial strength) nominal capacity. The vials are closed 
with a rubber stopper and sealed with an aluminum/polypropylene flip-off sealing combi cap using 
different colours for the various strengths. 
The active substance, rIX-FP, is formulated in a citrate buffer containing stabilizers and a bulking 
agent. The formulation contains the following excipients: sucrose, polysorbate 80, mannitol, tri-sodium 
citrate dihydrate. For pH adjustment, small amounts of hydrochloric acid (HCl) compliant to 
compendial standards are used.

Pharmaceutical Development  
The development of the finished product manufacturing process occurred in two stages, the pilot scale 
(finished product for use in early clinical development) and the commercial scale (finished product for 
pivotal clinical studies). 
The first stage of the finished product development led to the pilot scale process for the 500 IU and 
1000 IU strengths. The pilot scale process supplied finished product for pre-clinical pharmacology and 
toxicology studies as well as early clinical development.  
The formulation development studies resulted in a formulation procedure allowing all strengths to be 
formulated using the same two solutions – stabilizer solution (containing mannitol, sucrose, tri-sodium 
citrate, polysorbate 80) and a dilution solution (containing tri-sodium citrate and polysorbate 80). The 
two formulation solutions developed are free of animal-derived materials.  
The second stage, the commercial scale process development, included site and scale changes as well 
as process optimization changes regarding the production of the 500 IU and 1000 IU strengths and the 
introduction of the two additional strengths 250 IU and 2000 IU.  
The unit operations were consistent throughout development. Process changes included mostly site 
and scale-up changes and also process optimizations were performed. 
Specific lyophilization cycles were developed for the 250 IU, 500 IU/1000 IU and 2000 IU strengths 
taking into account the different fill volumes for the different strengths (2.2 ml: 250 IU, 500 IU, 1000 
IU; 4.4 ml: 2000 IU). The development studies of the lyophilization process lead to a robust 
commercial freeze-drying process which yields a product with consistent quality attributes. 
No overages are applied during the filling of finished product.  
The finished product formulation was shown to be stable. The stability data support compatibility of the 
active substance with the finished product excipients. The lyophilized finished product is a pale yellow 
to white whole or cracked plug.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The finished production manufacturing process contains 5 process steps, including formulation and 
sterile filtration, filling, lyophilization, crimping and labelling and packaging. 
A detailed process flow diagram including a summary of the IPC and IPAC tests conducted at each 
stage of the manufacturing process and interim storage conditions has been provided. 
The development of the rIX-FP Process Control Strategy (PCS) was the basis for the process validation. 
During process development, a risk-based and science-based approach was used to reveal the 
relationship between manufacturing process variables and product quality attributes. 
The Process Control Strategy ensures consistent manufacture of the finished product that meets its 
defined critical quality attributes (CQAs). All process parameters were evaluated with regard to risk of 
failure, taking into account scientific rationale, data from process characterisation studies and historical 
manufacturing data. The suitability of the control strategy was confirmed during PPQ.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 13/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A Process Validation Master Plan was developed and established for rIX-FP, which defines the strategy 
to assure a reliable and consistent manufacturing process capable of delivering product of appropriate 
quality. 
The rIX-FP manufacturing process was qualified according to a prospective PPQ protocol which defined 
the sampling, analytical testing and acceptance criteria for each process step. The results have been 
presented. Taken together, all study objectives of the PPQ were met and the defined PCS was 
successfully validated for the manufacture of rIX-FP. 
Validation data was presented covering the finished product manufacturing steps including formulation, 
sterile filtration, filling and lyophilization. In addition, information on the hold times as well the 
reprocessing at the sterile filtration step was provided. The process validation data cover all critical 
manufacturing steps. 
Regarding the validation of the lyophilization step, sufficient validation data has been provided in order 
to cover the intended use during the routine production regarding the number of freeze-dried vials (for 
each strength).  
The process validation strategy provided is acceptable. An ongoing process verification (also known as 
continued process verification (CPV)) plan is in place to ensure the validated state of the rIX-FP 
manufacturing process throughout the commercial life cycle. 
Comparability exercise for finished medicinal product 
The comparability of the finished product manufactured using the pilot or commercial scale process 
was evaluated. The evaluation included both non-clinical animal studies (high dose toxicology and PK 
study in rats) and analytical comparability studies. 
The analytical studies evaluated results of release tests and characterisation assays including structural 
and functional assays. The data from the comparability exercise demonstrate that the non-clinical and 
clinical data obtained using rIX-FP from the pilot scale process was supportive for the pivotal clinical 
studies using material manufactured by the commercial scale process. 
In addition, no major process changes regarding the finished product manufacturing process occurred 
during development, indicating that the Phase I and Phase I/II clinical trial material (pilot scale: 500 
IU, 1000 IU) and the Phase III clinical trial material of the commercial scale process (250 IU, 500 IU, 
1000 IU, 2000 IU) as well as the commercial product are manufactured by the same process and are 
of comparable quality. 
In conclusion, the comparability studies are in compliance with the guideline ICH Q5E “Comparability of 
Biotechnological/Biological products subject to changes in their manufacturing process”. 
Product specification 
The rIX-FP finished product specification used for release/shelf life testing is considered appropriate 
including adequate tests for integrity, potency, purity and quality. The acceptance criteria are based on 
historical data. The specification parameters and their acceptance criteria are adequate and meet the 
requirements of guideline ICH Q6B. The proposed control strategy ensures that rIX-FP meets 
consistent quality. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 14/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The description of the analytical procedures and their validations were provided. A more detailed 
description regarding the FIX potency assay (aPTT) was also provided.  
The information provided on the batch analysis data as well as on the characterisation on the process- 
and product-related impurities is considered appropriate. Product-derived impurities and degradation 
products are well controlled in both the active substance and the finished product manufacturing 
process. Specifications for known product-related impurities were established. 
No new process-related impurities were identified in the finished product when compared to the active 
substance. 
In addition, studies on the leachables and extractables were presented. An evaluation of leachables 
and extractables was performed on stored finished product lots on filled final bulk lots and on finished 
product stabilizer and formulation solutions. The evaluations assessed non-volatile and semi-volatile 
substances as well as inorganic elements. 
The issue of possible leachables and extractables derived from the rubber stopper including a risk 
assessment was addressed and the respective studies were included in the dossier. 
Reference Standard 
The strategy for establishing and maintaining reference standards for release and stability testing of 
commercial rIX-FP active substance and finished product was described. 
A primary reference standard (PRS) was established in order to ensure that the quality of the 
active substance remains consistent and to avoid a drift in quality over time. Working reference 
standards (WRS) are established for routine release and stability testing of active substance which 
are qualified against the primary reference standard, and the stability of both reference materials 
is monitored to assess the suitability of these reference standards over their lifetime. 
The potency of PRS calibrated against the WHO International Standard (IS) (NIBSC code 07/182) for 
plasma-derived Factor IX and the labelling of the Primary Reference Standard PRS1 in International 
Units was adequately described. Thus, traceability to the International Standard was considered 
established and the use of International Units (IU) for potency labelling rIX-FP justified.  
The information on the initial potency assignments for a new PRS and a new WRS was presented, and 
the acceptance criteria for the establishment of a new PRS and a new WRS were outlined.  
The stability monitoring program for the PRS and the WRS including the test parameter for the FIX 
activity and the respective acceptance criteria as well as the testing intervals were provided. 
Stability of the product 
The stability of rIX-FP was investigated in accordance with ICH Q5C. The batches included into the 
stability studies used the container closure system of the routine production. The container closure 
system consists of 6 ml and 10 ml type I glass vials and a rubber stopper. The packaging materials for 
storage of the finished product are in compliance with Ph. Eur. and USP requirements and are suitable 
for the intended use.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 15/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A number of long-term stability studies for commercial scale batches at +5°C, +25°C and at +40°C 
(stress condition) were performed in order to monitor the physical, chemical and biological integrity of 
the finished product over time. 
The proposed shelf life for the 250 IU and the 500 IU strengths is 24 months when not stored above 
+25°C. The proposed shelf life for the 1000 IU and the 2000 IU strengths is 36 months when not 
stored above +25°C. The proposed shelf life is based on long term studies performed with pilot and 
commercial scale batches of finished product and is supported by real time data. 
Stability after reconstitution was also tested. Stability of rIX-FP for up to 8 hours at room temperature 
in solution was shown for all four strengths at the end of the proposed shelf life (250 IU: 36 months; 
500 IU: 36 months; 1000 IU: 36 months; 2000 IU: 36 months). 
In addition, a photo stability study was performed demonstrating, rIX-FP finished product must be 
stored protected from light.  
The stability studies provided are acceptable. Additional real time/real temperature data (250 IU, 500 
IU: 24 months when not stored above 25 °C; 1000 IU, 2000 IU: 36 months when not stored above 
25 °C) for commercial scale batches (representative of the validated commercial process) was 
presented to support the claimed shelf life and storage temperature as well as the reconstitution 
stability claimed in the SmPC. 
Solvent Water for Injections  
The information provided in the dossier for the solvent shows that the sWFI is manufactured under 
GMP compliant conditions using a validated process and meets Ph. Eur. requirements for sterile WFI.  
sWFI is provided as 2.5 ml and 5.0 ml fill sizes in 6 ml type I glass vials which are closed with a  
rubber stopper. The proposed shelf life conditions are supported by real time stability data. 
Regarding the immediate packaging materials sufficient information has been provided (compliance 
with Ph. Eur. monographs, Certificates of Analyses). 
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
Compliance with the TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01 – current version) has been sufficiently 
demonstrated. The active substance is produced in a serum-free medium. No other material of bovine 
origin is added during fermentation of rIX-FP. The MCB which has been established is free from TSE-
risk substances. 
Virus safety 
The fermentation process of rIX-FP occurs in a chemically-defined medium. The cells used for 
production of rIX-FP have been sufficiently screened for viruses.  
The purification process of rIX-FP includes several steps for inactivation/removal of enveloped viruses. 
The effectiveness of these steps has been sufficiently demonstrated. In addition, the capture 
chromatography also contributes to the virus removal. The removal capacity of small non-enveloped 
viruses is mainly based on the dedicated filtration step. Screening for viruses including Minute Virus of 
Mice (MMV) is routinely performed at the end of the fermentation runs. During the manufacture of the 
Assessment report

active substance, column chromatography resins are used during purification. Studies of reuse of 
chromatography resins have been provided. In summary, the viral safety of rIX-FP has been 
sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information about the active substance and finished product was of acceptable quality. Sufficient 
evidence regarding the manufacturing processes has been provided. The results of tests carried out 
indicate mostly a satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics. 
The justifications concerning the control of certain process-related impurities were provided. 
Specification limits and analytical methods are suitable to control the quality of the active substance 
and the finished product. The finished product was well characterised. The stability program is 
considered satisfactory. The results generated during the stability studies support the proposed shelf 
life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC.  
The finished product is manufactured by a process that operates reproducibly within established 
parameters leading to a product that meets its pre-determined quality attributes. The process was 
validated in a continuous process verification approach, and the respective Master Validation Plan was 
provided. 
An adequate set of control parameters, IPCs and IPACs including the limits and acceptance criteria was 
established based on a risk analysis to control the quality of the finished product. The chosen control 
strategy is considered appropriate. 
The finished product specification including the testing parameters as well as the acceptance criteria is 
suitable and represents the commercial and validated process. 
Detailed information was presented especially for the FIX coagulation assay (aPTT). Due to the 
variability of the FIX potency which is dependent on the test performance, the routine potency test 
method and equipment was specified in detail.  
The calibration of the Primary Reference Standard potency against the WHO IS resulted in significantly 
different FIX potency values due to the use of different equipment, test kits and particular aPTT 
reagents. The Applicant clarified that the FIX potency value of PRS1 was used to label all the batches 
manufactured to date. This value was also used to label the Secondary Working Standards. 
The labelling of the Primary Reference Standard PRS1 in International Units was explained and justified 
(calibration data provided; linearity and parallelism versus the IS, NIBSC code 07/182, shown). 
The general strategy for the calibration and the stability monitoring of the rFIX-FP Reference Standards 
(PRS and WRS) was described.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance and the finished product have been appropriately characterised and in general 
satisfactory documentation has been provided. Overall, the data presented indicate that Idelvion is 
manufactured by a validated, controlled process taking into consideration relevant guidance 
documents. The results indicate that the active substance as well as the finished product can be 
reproducibly manufactured.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended some points for further investigation.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
An initial pharmacodynamic investigation was carried out in vitro to identify pharmacologically relevant 
test species. In-vivo pharmacodynamic studies were performed in two animal species deficient in FIX, 
i.e. FIX deficient mice and dogs. In terms of safety pharmacology the effects of rIX-FP administration 
on pulmonary functions (e.g. respiration rate, tidal volume and minute volume) were investigated in 
conscious rats using plethysmo-graphy. Safety pharmacological assessment of effects on the 
cardiovascular system was covered by the repeat-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Potential effects on the central nervous system were evaluated during the single-dose toxicity studies 
in rats and cynomolgus monkeys as well as during the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys based on clinical observations as well as macroscopic and histopathological 
evaluations.   
The i.v. single dose toxicity of rIX-FP was evaluated in rats and monkeys using doses of up to 500 
IU/kg. Repeat-dose toxicity of rIX-FP was evaluated in rats and monkeys after i.v. administration at 
doses of 75, 150 and 500 IU/kg/day for 28 consecutive days. Further toxicology studies comprise two 
investigations concerning genotoxicity, one local tolerance study and a Wessler test to address possible 
thrombogenicity. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In-vitro 
Study No. IVX 01/09: Effects on coagulation Parameter aPTT following spiking of rIX-FP and BeneFIX 
into plasma of various species 
The aim of this study was to establish a concentration-response relationship regarding the effects of 
spiking plasma samples of various species with rIX-FP. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 
was used as the primary endpoint representing a sensitive measure for effects on the coagulation 
system, which has been indicated for screening defects of functional clotting factors such as Factor 
VIII, IX, XI or XII. BeneFIX was used as comparator. It appeared that aPTT decreased dose-
dependently following spiking of human, cynomolgus monkey, rat and rabbit plasma with rIX-FP. In 
rabbits, BeneFIX was significantly more effective in decreasing aPTT compared to rIX-FP. In-vivo 
Study No. 040200011: rIX-FP: Single Dose Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study by 
Intravenous (Bolus) Administration to Hemophilia B Dogs 
Assessment report

In this study three hemophilia B dogs (1F, 2M) were treated with rIX-FP and two (2F) with BeneFIX 
with a single intravenous dose of 100 IU/kg. Thereafter, blood samples were taken up to Day 36 for 
assessment of pharmacodynamic (i.e. aPTT and whole blood clotting time (WBCT)) and 
pharmacokinetic parameters, as well as for haematology, clinical chemistry and immunogenicity 
investigations. Furthermore, clinical signs, bodyweight and mortality were recorded throughout the 
study. 
Following the single intravenous injection of rIX-FP and BeneFIX® in hemophilia B dogs, no test item-
related changes could be observed in bodyweight gain, haematology and clinical chemistry. 
Both treatment groups demonstrated a clear haemostatic efficacy. WBCT and aPTT values were 
decreased after treatment and returned to pretreatment values after the study drugs were cleared 
from the circulation. However, aPTT values stayed below 0.6 times the baseline value more than three 
times longer in the rIX-FP group (5.4 days) than in the BeneFIX group (1.6 days), whereas WBCT 
values of about 10 min were kept in both treatment groups for about seven days. 
The results of the immunogenicity testings revealed that an antibody response with neutralizing 
properties against the study drugs (i.e. rIX-FP and BeneFIX) appeared after a single intravenous 
injection.  
Study No. NBM 04/09: Correction of Hemostasis in FIX ko Mice with rIX-FP 
A single intravenous bolus of rIX-FP and BeneFIX, respectively, at 50, 100 and 200 IU/kg was given to 
FIX deficient mice (15 mice/ group). One group receiving isotonic saline (0.9 %) served as control. A 
tail tip bleeding assay with resection of about 3 mm of the tail tip was performed 15 minutes after drug 
administration to assess bleeding parameters. Measurement of total blood loss and time to hemostasis 
was used to determine the haemostatic efficacy. 
Both, rIX-FP and BeneFIX at all dose levels tested showed a clear haemostatic effect compared to the 
control group, i.e. a significant reduction in time to hemostasis and total blood loss.

Study No. NBM 05/09: Correction of Coagulation (aPTT) in FIX ko Mice following Treatment with rIX-FP 
and BeneFIX 
A single intravenous bolus of rIX-FP and BeneFIX®, respectively, at 50, 100 and 200 IU/kg was given 
to FIX deficient mice, whereas one group receiving isotonic saline (0.9 %) served as control (14-17 
mice/group). Measurement of aPTT was used to detect the effects on coagulation. 
Both, rIX-FP and BeneFIX, showed a clear significant decreasing effect on aPTT compared to the 
control group at all investigated dose levels. Thereby, the efficacy did not differ from BeneFIX®. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies were submitted (See discussion on non-clinical pharmacology) performed. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Respiratory system 
Evaluation of respiratory parameters (respiratory rate, tidal volume and minute volume) was 
performed in conscious rats using whole body bias flow plethysmography after intravenous application 
of rIX-FP (study APQ0003). A total of 40 male rats were allocated to 5 groups of 8 animals each. rIX-
FP was administered via bolus injection at doses of 75, 150 and 500 IU/kg. An additional control group 
received an equivalent volume (2.5 mL/kg) of isotonic saline (0.9 %), mimicking the highest dose 
volume used for test substance administration. Baclofen at a dose of 15 mg/kg, was administered to a 
further group of animals as a positive control (2.5 mL/kg). Respiratory parameters were recorded for a 
minimum of 60 min prior to dosing. Immediately after dosing, the rats were placed back into the whole 
body plethysmographs and respiratory parameters were recorded continuously for 4 h. 
rIX-FP, administered intravenously at 75, 150 or 500 IU/kg produced no statistically significant effect 
on any of the respiratory parameters measured in this study. Thus, the No Observed Adverse Effect 
Level (NOAEL) was considered to be at least 500 IU/kg as no statistically significant changes occurred 
in any of the respiratory parameters at this level, compared with placebo (saline)-treated animals. 
Cardiovascular system 
The potential effects of rIX-FP on electrophysiological parameters and blood pressure were assessed as 
part of a repeat-dose toxicity study performed in cynomolgus monkeys following daily intravenous 
(bolus) administration of rIX-FP over a period of 4 weeks, with a Day 6 interim period (study 
APQ0001). Three groups of 4 male and 4 female monkeys received rIX-FP at doses of 75, 150 or 500 
IU/kg/day for up to 4 weeks. Interim animals were dosed for 5 days and all other animals were dosed 
for 28 days. A similarly constituted control group received isotonic saline (0.9 %) with the same 
frequency as the treated groups but at a dose volume similar to the high dose group. 
The electrophysiology of the heart was considered unaffected by rIX-FP treatment. Blood pressure and 
pulse rate measurements were considered to be unaffected by rIX-FP treatment.. 
Central nervous system 
The potential effects on the central nervous system were evaluated during the single-dose toxicity 
studies in rats (APQ0005) and cynomolgus monkeys (APQ0007) as well as during the repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in rats (APQ0009) and cynomolgus monkeys (APQ0001) based on clinical observations 
as well as macroscopic and histopathological evaluations. In all these studies, no changes were 
observed which were considered to be indicative of a test item related effect on the central nervous 
system.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Studies on pharmacodynamics drug interactions have not been submitted (See discussion on non-
clinical aspects).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of rIX-FP, a study with single intravenous administration 
was performed in monkeys and in hemophilia B dogs. Furthermore, a quantitative whole-body 
autoradiography (QWBA) study was conducted in rats to evaluate tissue biodistribution of rIX-FP. 
Further kinetic analyses were carried out as part of the single- and repeat-dose toxicity evaluations in 
rats and monkeys. 
Study No. APQ0002: rIX-FP: Single-Dose Pharmacokinetic Study by Intravenous (Bolus) Administration 
to Cynomolgus Monkeys 
The objective of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of rIX-FP 
following single intravenous dosing at dose levels of 50 and 100 IU/kg. In addition, the systemic 
exposure to rIX-FP following administration was compared to that following administration of BeneFIX 
at the same two dose levels. Furthermore, appearance of an immune response against rIX-FP and 
BeneFIX, respectively, was investigated. 
Four groups of cynomolgus monkeys, each comprising of one male and one female animal, received 
single intravenous doses of rIX-FP or BeneFIX at dose levels of 50 IU/kg and 100 IU/kg, respectively. 
Blood samples were taken from each monkey over a 19 day period. 
Immunogenicity investigations as well as determination of human factor IX concentrations in the 
monkey plasma samples were performed using validated ELISA methods. 
No adverse effects of treatment were observed following intravenous administration of either rIX-FP or 
BeneFIX. During the course of the study, no antibody formation both against human factor IX or 
human albumin (both components of rIX-FP) and against human factor IX (i.e. BeneFIX) was 
detectable. 
Following intravenous administration, the pharmacokinetics of rIX-FP were dose proportional for AUC 
and Cmax and independent of sex. rIX-FP was cleared slowly and the individual terminal half-life (t1/2) 
values were within the range 39.8 to 44.4 hours over the dose range (mean value= 42.2 hours). 
Study No. 040200011: rIX-FP: Single Dose Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study by 
Intravenous (Bolus) Administration to Hemophilia B Dogs 
The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacological efficacy, pharmacokinetic characteristics and 
immunogenicity of rIX-FP in a single dose study by intravenous (bolus) administration in hemophilia B 
dogs and, in addition, to compare acquired data with BeneFIX. Three hemophilia B dogs were treated 
with rIX-FP and two with BeneFIX with a single intravenous dose of 100 IU/kg. Thereafter, blood 
samples were taken up to Day 36 for assessment of pharmacodynamic (i.e. aPTT and whole blood 
clotting time (WBCT)) and pharmacokinetic parameters, as well as for haematology, clinical chemistry 
and immunogenicity investigations. Clinical signs, bodyweight and mortality were recorded throughout 
the study. 
Following the single intravenous injection of rIX-FP and BeneFIX in hemophilia B dogs, no test item-
related changes could be observed in bodyweight gain, haematology and clinical chemistry. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 21/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Both treatment groups demonstrated a clear haemostatic efficacy. WBCT and aPTT values were 
decreased after treatment and returned to pretreatment values after the study drugs were cleared 
from the circulation. Thereby, aPTT values stayed below 0.6 times the baseline value more than three 
times longer in the rIX-FP group (5.4 days) than in the BeneFIX group (1.6 days). 
Pharmacokinetic investigations revealed that the clearance was 3.5 times lower for rIX-FP (2.6 
mL/h/kg) than for BeneFIX (9.3 mL/h/kg). A human factor IX level of minimum 50 IU/L (suggested 
protective level in hemophilia B patients) was kept more than three times longer with rIX-FP (7.3 
days) than with BeneFIX (2.3 days). 
The results of the immunogenicity testings revealed that an antibody response with neutralizing 
properties against the study drugs (i.e. rIX-FP and BeneFIX) appeared after a single intravenous 
injection. It can be concluded that rIX-FP administration demonstrated a clear haemostatic efficacy in 
hemophilia B dogs. Thereby the pharmacokinetic properties were superior to BeneFIX. Both, rIX-FP 
and BeneFIX induced an antibody response in hemophilia B dogs. 
Study No. CSL/01 and CSL/03: Protein labeling and metabolism studies in the rat 
Biodistribution of human coagulation factor IX (FIX) was studied in quantitative whole body 
autoradiography (QWBA) studies following administration of rIX-FP, BeneFIX or human albumin 
(Recombumin) to rats. 
[3H]-rIX-FP, [3H]-BeneFIX or [3H]-albumin, labeled using the N-Succinimidyl [2,3,-3H] propionate 
(NSP) method, were administered i.v. to male rats at a single radioactive dose of approximately 400 
μCi/kg. Using QWBA, tissue radioactivity was determined over 24 ([3H]-BeneFIX) or 240 ([3H]-rIX-FP, 
[3H]-albumin) hours. In addition to full body sections, the hind limbs were separately subjected to 
QWBA to obtain more detailed information on the products’ distribution within the bone marrow and 
knee joint region. In parallel, plasma, urine and feces were collected at several time points throughout 
the observation period to calculate excretion balance and assess physiological elimination pathways. 
The radioactivity associated with the [3H]-labelled proteins was determined by quantitative 
radiochemical analysis (QRA) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The radioactivity 
associated with plasma, urine and feces samples was also determined using QRA. Biological activity of 
BeneFIX and rIX-FP after [3H]-labeling was confirmed by a chromogenic assay in vitro. 
The results obtained confirmed that elimination of [3H]-rIX-FP and [3H]-BeneFIX occurred primarily 
via the urine. After 240 hours, 73% of radioactivity was recovered in urine (associated with only low 
molecular weight components), ≤5% eliminated in feces and about 20% remained in tissues. 
The tissue distribution of [3H]-rIX-FP and [3H]-BeneFIX was comparable, both penetrating 
predominantly into well vascularized tissues and/or excretion organs including the adrenal gland, 
spleen, lung, liver, kidney, myocardium, peridontal membrane, nasal mucosa, stomach wall and 
gastrointestinal mucosa. Both proteins were also rapidly present within bone marrow and synovial or 
mineralized regions of knee joint sections where they seemed to mostly localize to the zone of calcified 
cartilage within the growth plate regions of long bones. The longest retention times were observed for 
bone marrow and the endosteum of long bones. Overall, these results suggest similar tissue 
distribution profile of [3H]-rIX-FP and [3H]-BeneFIX independent of albumin fusion. In contrast, the 
biodistribution of [3H]-albumin appeared to be different with only very low initial penetration of bone 
marrow and liver but rapid, homogeneous distribution throughout the whole body including muscle and 
connective tissue. Intriguingly, however, both [3H]-rIX-FP and [3H]-albumin derived radioactivity was 
detectable over 120 hours, whereas the radioactivity associated with [3H]-BeneFIX was only 
detectable over 24 hours, further supporting the notion of extended tissue half-life of [3H]-rIX-FP due 
to albumin fusion.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The i.v. single dose toxicity of rIX-FP was evaluated in two studies in rats and in one study in monkeys 
using doses of up to 500 IU/kg.  
Study No. APQ0005: rIX-FP: Single Dose Toxicity Study by Intravenous (Bolus) Administration to CD 
Rats 
The systemic toxic potential and toxicokinetics of rIX-FP was assessed over a 5 day period following a 
single dose by intravenous (bolus) administration in rats. 
Three groups, each comprising 5 male and 5 female rats received rIX-FP at doses of 75, 150 or 500 
IU/kg. A similarly constituted control group received isotonic saline (0.9 %) at the same volume-dose 
as the highest treated dose group (2.5 mL/kg). A further 3 males and 3 females were allocated to the 
control group and 9 males and 9 females were allocated to each treated group and were used for 
toxicokinetic evaluation. Blood samples for toxicokinetic evaluation were taken at pre-dose, 0.25, 1, 3, 
8, 24, 72 and 120 h. Clinical condition, mortality, bodyweight, food consumption, haematology, blood 
chemistry, toxicokinetics, urinalysis, organ weight, macropathology and histopathology investigations 
were undertaken. 
Cmax and AUC following a single intravenous administration of rIX-FP increased proportionally with 
increasing dose over the range 75 to 500 IU/kg. The systemic exposure was similar for males and 
females. Over the dose range, the terminal half-life (t1/2) values were found to be in the range of 15.7 
– 20.7 h. There was no indication of dose dependency regarding half-life, volume of distribution and 
total plasma clearance. 
There were no unscheduled deaths. 
In conclusion, a single intravenous injection of rIX-FP at doses up to 500 IU/kg was well tolerated in 
the rat with no findings indicative of adverse toxicity and no irritation at the site of injection. Under the 
conditions of this study, the NOAEL was considered to be 500 IU/kg. 
Study No. 8244656: rIX-FP and rIX-FP-B: Single dose Intravenous (Bolus) Administration Toxicity 
Study in the Rat Followed by a 5 Day Treatment-free Period 
The objective of the study was to determine the toxicity of rIX-FP whereby the effects of the test 
articles were compared after increasing the production scale from pilot to commercial scale. The 
assessment of toxicity was made following intravenous (bolus) administration to the rat and an 
Assessment report

assessment of delayed onset toxicity and / or reversibility was made during a 5 day treatment-free 
period. Additionally, an evaluation of the potential influence of the increased levels of the process 
derived impurity, i.e. bilirubin, following transfer from pilot scale to commercial scale, was made on the 
test article’s toxicity profile.  
The systemic toxic potential and toxicokinetics of rIX-FP pilot scale and commercial scale material were 
assessed in rats. Two groups, each comprising five male and five female rats, received rIX-FP at the 
high dose of 500 IU/kg. A similarly constituted control group received isotonic saline (0.9 %) at the 
same volume-dose (2.5 mL/kg). A further 3 males and 3 females were allocated to the control group 
and 9 males and 9 females were allocated to each treatment group - used for toxicokinetic evaluation. 
Blood samples for toxicokinetic evaluation were taken at pre-dose, 0.25, 1, 3, 8, 24, 72 and 120 h. 
Toxicokinetic evaluation showed that there were no differences between both formulations regarding 
half-life, volume of distribution and total plasma clearance. The t1/2 values ranged from 16.8 to 20.5 
hours. The plasma concentrations and therefore the toxicokinetic parameters were comparable for 
females and for males. 
There were no unscheduled deaths during the study. There were no clinical signs observed throughout 
the study nor were there any effects on body weight, food consumption, haematology, plasma 
chemistry or urinalysis in any treated group. There were also no macroscopic findings due to either 
local or systemic effects of rIX-FP independent of the production scale. 
A NOAEL of 500 IU/kg was designated in this study. 
Study No. APQ0007: Single Dose Toxicity Study by IV (Bolus) Administration to Cynomolgus Monkeys 
The systemic toxic potential and toxicokinetics of rIX-FP was assessed in a single dose study by 
intravenous (bolus) administration in cynomolgus monkeys. Three groups of 3 male and 3 female 
monkeys received a single dose of rIX-FP at 75, 150 or 500 IU/kg on study Day 1. A similarly 
constituted control group received isotonic saline (0.9 %) at the same frequency. 
Two male and 2 female animals from each group were killed on Day 6 of the study, and the remaining 
1 male and 1 female from each group were killed on Day 11. 
During the study, clinical condition, mortality, bodyweight, haematology, blood chemistry, 
toxicokinetics, urinalysis, organ weights, macropathology and histopathology investigations were 
undertaken. Blood samples for toxicokinetic evaluation were drawn at baseline and at 0.25, 1, 5, 24, 
72, 120 hours of all animals/ group and at 240 hours of 1 male and 1 female animals/group after 
administration of rIX-FP. 
Systemic exposure to rIX-FP in the treated animals was confirmed, with none detected in the controls. 
Over the dose range, individual t1/2 values ranged from 14.2 – 71.2 h (mean values: 39.8 – 55.9 
hours). For the four animals, in which suitable values were obtained up to 240 h after dosing, the 
individual t1/2 values were in the range 49.7 – 83.4 h over the dose range. 
The Cmax and AUC0-tlast increased with dose for both male and female animals and the increase in 
exposure was proportional to dose after the single intravenous (bolus) administration of rIX-FP up to 
500 IU/kg. There was no indication of dose dependency regarding half-life, volume of distribution and 
total plasma clearance. 
There were no unscheduled deaths.

In conclusion, a single intravenous injection of rIX-FP at doses up to 500 IU/kg was well tolerated in 
cynomolgus monkeys with no toxicologically significant changes. Under the conditions of this study, 
the NOAEL was considered to be 500 IU/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Study No. APQ0009: rIX-FP: Toxicity Study by Intravenous (Bolus) Administration to CD Rats for 4 
Weeks Followed by a 2 Week Recovery Period 
The systemic toxic potential and toxicokinetics of rIX-FP to rats by intravenous (bolus) administration 
was assessed over a period of up to 4 weeks. The potential for any treatment-related effect to show 
recovery was assessed in a subsequent 2-week recovery period in selected satellite animals. Five 
animals from each group were killed on Day 6 as part of the interim kill to investigate initial toxicity 
before the development of any potential immune response. Three groups, each comprising ten male 
(plus 5 interim kill) and ten female (plus 5 interim kill) rats received rIX-FP at doses of 75, 150 or 500 
IU/kg/day. A similarly constituted control group received isotonic saline (0.9 %) at the same volume-
dose as the high dose group. A further three males and three females were allocated to the control 
group, and nine males and nine females were allocated to each treated group and were used for 
toxicokinetic evaluation (satellite animals). Blood samples for toxicokinetic assessment were drawn at 
pre-dose and at 0.25, 1, 3, 8, 24, 72 and 120 hours after 28th administration of rIX-FP. Furthermore, 
three male and three female rats were assigned from the control and high dose group satellite animals 
to assess recovery from any treatment-related effect. These animals were treated for four weeks, 
followed by a 2-week period without treatment. 
During the study, clinical condition, mortality, bodyweight, food consumption, ophthalmoscopy, 
haematology, blood chemistry, toxicokinetics, anti-product antibodies, urinalysis, organ weight, 
macropathology and histopathology investigations were undertaken. 
Systemic exposure to rIX-FP in treated animals was confirmed, with none detected in controls. Dose 
linearity and proportionality of AUCτ and Cmax after multiple intravenous administrations of rIX FP was 
demonstrated over the dose range 75 – 500 IU/kg. The terminal half-life (t1/2) values were found to 
be in the range 15.7 – 27.7 h (using meanar-plasma concentrations) and 20.8 – 28.5 h (using 
maximum plasma concentrations) over this dose range. Terminal half-life and total plasma clearance 
were independent of dose, and no sex difference was apparent in the measured plasma concentrations 
after repeated dosing for 28 days. 
There was no evidence of an immune response to the human albumin or the human factor IX (both 
components of rIX-FP) at Day 6. However, at Day 16 there was a response observed in 3 animals from 
the rIX-FP treated groups (1 against human albumin and 2 against human factor IX), indicating the 
potential onset of a response. The percentage of animals positive for anti-drug-antibodies (ADA) 
against rIX-FP increased from 3% on Day 15 to 26% on Day 28. 
There were no deaths or clinical findings that were considered to be associated with treatment.  
In conclusion, administration of rIX-FP by intravenous injection at doses up to 500 IU/kg/day was well 
tolerated in the rat with no findings indicative of adverse toxicity.  Under the conditions of this study, 
the NOAEL was considered to be 500 IU/kg.

Study No. APQ0001: rIX-FP: Toxicity Study by Intravenous (Bolus) Administration to Cynomolgus 
Monkeys for 4 Weeks 
The systemic toxic potential and toxicokinetics of rIX-FP to cynomolgus monkeys by intravenous 
(bolus) administration was assessed over a period of 4 weeks, with a Day 6 interim period. Three 
groups of 4 male and 4 female monkeys received rIX-FP at doses of 75, 150 or 500 IU/kg/day for up 
to 4 weeks. Interim animals were dosed for 5 days and all other animals were dosed for 28 days. A 
similarly constituted control group received isotonic saline (0.9 %) with the same frequency as the 
treated groups but at a dose volume similar to the high dose group. From each group, one male and 
female were killed after the interim period (Day 6), two males and females were killed 1-2 days after 
the 28 days of treatment (i.e. Day 29 and 30) and the remaining male and female were killed on Day 
38. 
During the study, clinical condition, mortality, bodyweight, ophthalmic examination, 
electrocardiography, blood pressure, haematology, blood chemistry, toxicokinetics, antibody analysis, 
urinalysis, organ weight, macropathology and histopathology investigations were undertaken. 
For toxicokinetic analysis blood samples were drawn as follows: Day 1: before (predose) and 0.25, 1, 
5, 24 (24 h sampling before next dosing on Day 2) and 72 h (72 h sampling before next dosing on Day 
4) after administration (all animals) Day 28: before and 0.25, 1, 5 and 24 h after administration 
(remaining 3 male and 3 female animals of each group after the interim kill). Day 28: 48, 72, 120 and 
240 h after administration (remaining 1 male and 1 female animal of each group). 
Systemic exposure to rIX-FP in the treated animals was confirmed, with none detected in the controls. 
Over the dose range, individual terminal half-life (t1/2) values ranged from 14.0 - 28.9 hours (mean 
values: 16.6 - 25.2 hours) for Day 1 and 17.7 - 45.7 hours (mean values: 18.6 - 33.3 hours) for Day 
28. The exception was for one male in the 500 IU/kg group which had t1/2 of 3.0 hours (Day 28) as a 
consequence of increased systemic clearance, considered to be mainly a result of the elevated anti-
human albumin antibodies. For the five animals, in which suitable values were obtained up to 240 h 
after dosing on Day 28, the individual t1/2 values were in the range 21.6 - 69.1 h over the dose range. 
The Cmax and AUC0-24 (Day 1) or AUCτ(Day 28) increased with dose for both male and female 
animals and the increase in exposure was proportional to dose after single and repeated dosing. 
Terminal half-life and total plasma clearance were independent of dose. Some accumulation occurred, 
with 2-3 fold increase observed for both sexes after repeated dosing. Continuous exposure to rIX-FP 
was also demonstrated throughout the study and no sex differences were observed. 
There were no unscheduled deaths. Similar to the situation in rats, anti-human factor IX antibodies 
occurred in a number of animals and one animal at the 500 IU/kg/day dose developed anti-human 
albumin antibodies. Overall, 67% of all treated monkeys tested positive for rIX-FP antibodies on Day 
28 compared to 17% on Day 14. There were no similar findings in the controls. 
In conclusion, intravenous injection of rIX-FP at doses up to 500 IU/kg for up to 28 days was well 
tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys with no adverse changes. Anti-human factor IX antibodies occurred 
in a number of rIX-FP treated animals and one animal at the 500 IU/kg/day dose had anti-human 
albumin antibodies. Under the conditions of this study, the NOAEL was considered to be 500 IU/kg. 
Genotoxicity 
Two investigations concerning genotoxicity were performed. 
Study No. APQ0004: rIX-FP: Bacterial Reverse Mutation Test (Ames test) 
This in vitro assay was performed to assess the mutagenic potential of rIX-FP. Histidine-dependent 
auxotrophic mutants of Salmonella typhimurium, strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98 and TA100, and a 
Assessment report

tryptophan-dependent mutant of Escherichia coli, strain WP2 uvrA (pKM101), were exposed to rIX-FP 
dissolved in water for injection (WFI) and diluted in isotonic saline (0.9 %). Isotonic saline was also 
used as a negative control. 
Two independent mutation tests were performed in the presence and absence of liver preparations (S9 
mix) from rats treated with phenobarbital and 5,6-benzoflavone. The first test was a standard plate 
incorporation assay; the second included a pre-incubation stage. 
Nominal concentrations of rIX-FP ranging from 0.1 to 200 IU per plate were tested. 200 IU per plate is 
the maximum concentration achievable using the test substance formulated as directed by CSL 
Behring, and thus complies with the recommendations of the regulatory guidelines that this assay 
follows. Other concentrations used were a series of dilutions of the highest concentration. 
No signs of toxicity were observed towards the tester strains in either mutation test following exposure 
to rIX-FP. No evidence of mutagenic activity was seen at any concentration of rIX-FP in either mutation 
test. The concurrent positive controls demonstrated the sensitivity of the assay and the metabolising 
activity of the liver preparations. Thus, rIX-FP showed no evidence of mutagenic activity in this 
bacterial system under the test conditions employed. 
Study No. APQ0006: rIX-FP: In Vitro Mammalian Chromosome Abberation Test In Human Lymphocytes 
Human lymphocytes, in whole blood culture, were stimulated to divide by addition of 
phytohaemagglutinin, and were exposed to the test substance both in the absence and presence of S9 
mix derived from rat livers. Negative and positive control cultures were also included. Two hours 
before the end of the incubation period, cell division was arrested using Colcemid®, the cells harvested 
and slides prepared, so that metaphase cells could be examined for chromosomal damage. 
In order to determine the toxicity of rIX-FP to cultured human lymphocytes, the mitotic index was 
assessed for all cultures treated with the test substance and negative control (chosen diluent, isotonic 
saline, 0.9 %). Justification for concentration selection was based on the maximum achievable nominal 
concentration of 200 IU/mL using the test substance formulation procedure as directed by CSL 
Behring. On the basis of these data, the following three highest concentrations were selected for 
metaphase analysis: 
First test: In the absence of S9 mix - 3 hour treatment, 18 hour recovery: 7.2, 12 and 20 IU/mL. In 
the presence of S9 mix (2 % v/v) - 3 hour treatment, 18 hour recovery: 7.2, 12 and 20 IU/mL. 
Second test: In the absence of S9 mix - 21 hour continuous treatment: 7.2, 12 and 20 IU/mL. In the 
presence of S9 mix (5 % v/v) - 3 hour treatment, 18 hour recovery: 7.2, 12 and 20 IU/mL. 
In the absence and presence of S9 mix, rIX-FP caused no statistically significant increases in the 
proportion of metaphase figures containing chromosomal aberrations, at any concentration, when 
compared with the negative control, in either test. No statistically significant increases in the 
proportion of polyploid cells were observed during metaphase analysis, in either test. 
All positive control compounds caused statistically significant increases in the proportion of aberrant 
cells, demonstrating the sensitivity of the test system and the efficacy of the S9 mix.

Local Tolerance  
Study No. APQ0008: rIX-FP: Local Tolerance Study in the Rabbit following Intravenous, Intra-arterial 
or Perivenous Injection (GLP-compliant) 
This study was performed to assess the local tolerance of rIX-FP when administered by the intended 
clinical dose route (intravenous) and potential clinical missdose routes (intra-arterial or perivenous). 
Three groups, each comprising four female NZW rabbits received rIX-FP. 
Group 1: Four rabbits received an intravenous injection of 1.2 mL of rIX-FP into the lateral ear vein of 
the right ear on a single occasion (Day 1). The lateral ear vein of the left ear of each animal received 
the same volume of isotonic saline (0.9 %) and acted as a Control. 
Group 2: Four rabbits received an intra-arterial injection against the blood flow of 1.3 mL of rIX-FP into 
the median auricular artery of the right ear on a single occasion (Day 1). The median auricular artery 
of the left ear of each animal received the same volume of isotonic saline (0.9 %) and acted as a 
Control. 
The amount administered i.v. or i.a. was, or exceeded, the clinical dose of 75 IU/kg. 
Group 3: Four rabbits received a perivenous injection of 0.2 mL of rIX-FP alongside the lateral ear vein 
of the right ear on a single occasion (Day 1); the lateral ear vein of the left ear of each animal received 
0.2 mL of isotonic saline (0.9 %) and acted as a Control. 
All animals were observed for four days. There was no sign of toxicity or ill health in any rabbit during 
the observation period and bodyweight gain was considered to have been unaffected by treatment. 
No local irritation was apparent at any time during the study period, at any injection site treated with 
rIX-FP, irrespective of route of administration. One case of very slight erythema was evident at a single 
control intra-arterial injection site, 24 hours after administration. 
Bruising at the site of injection was common and it was considered that this was due to the 
administration procedure. There was no treatment-related macroscopic or microscopic pathology 
finding. 
Taken together, intravenous, intra-arterial and perivenous injection of rIX-FP was well tolerated in 
rabbits with no local or systemic signs of reaction to treatment. Macropathological and histological 
findings were considered to be due to the administration procedure. 
Other toxicity studies 
Study No. S22456: In vivo Thrombogenicity Test in the Rabbit  
The thrombogenic potential was assessed in rabbits using a venous stasis model (Wessler test). Three 
groups with 3 male and 3 female NZW rabbits each were administered intravenously with 75, 150 and 
500 IU/kg rIX-FP, respectively. One additional group was treated with placebo (i.e. isotonic saline, 0.9 
%). After administration of the test article or the placebo the Vena jugularis was ligated. Formation of

thrombi in the right or left Vena jugularis according to a score system was determined after 10 and 20 
minutes, respectively. In conclusion, rIX-FP showed no thrombogenic activity after intravenous 
administration of 75, 150 and 500 IU/kg. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Idelvion is a recombinant replacement protein catabolized during human metabolism and no active 
molecule is excreted by the patient. In accordance with the guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00 it is 
exempted from an environmental risk assessment since proteins are unlikely to result in a significant 
risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
An initial pharmacodynamic investigation carried out in vitro to identify pharmacologically relevant test 
species indicated that rIX-FP is pharmacologically active in cynomolgus monkeys, rats and rabbits with 
effects on aPTT higher or comparable to the effects seen in human plasma. In-vivo pharmacodynamic 
studies were performed in two animal species deficient in FIX, i.e. FIX deficient mice and dogs. In 
hemophilia B dogs rIX-FP (100 IU/kg i.v.) demonstrated a shortening of the aPTT and the whole blood 
clotting time (WBCT). Of note, both, rIX-FP and BeneFIX® induced an antibody response after single 
dose application in the hemophilia B dogs. The i.v. administration of 50, 100 and 200 IU/kg rIX-FP, 
respectively, to FIX deficient mice revealed a significant dose-dependent reduction of total blood loss, 
time to hemostasis and aPTT compared to the control group. 
No secondary pharmacology studies were conducted, which is considered acceptable based on the type 
of product. 
In terms of safety pharmacology the effects of rIX-FP administration on pulmonary functions (e.g. 
respiration rate, tidal volume and minute volume) were investigated in conscious rats using plethysmo-
graphy. In this study no effects of rIX-FP treatment on respiratory parameters were observed (NOAEL 
500 IU/kg). Safety pharmacological assessment of effects on the cardiovascular system was covered 
by the repeat-dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys. In brief, electrophysiology of the heart, 
blood pressure and pulse rate measurements were considered to be unaffected by rIX-FP treatment. 
Potential effects on the central nervous system were evaluated during the single-dose toxicity studies 
in rats and cynomolgus monkeys as well as during the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys based on clinical observations as well as macroscopic and histopathological 
evaluations. In all these studies no signs of toxic effects on the central nervous system were noted. 
The type and amount of safety pharmacology studies are considered sufficient. Inclusion of safety 
pharmacology parameters into repeat-dose toxicity studies is state-of-the-art proceeding. Evaluation of 
safety pharmacology in terms of cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system obviously 
revealed no safety concerns against the use of rIX-FP within the intended dosage range. 
In order to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of rIX-FP, a study with single intravenous administration 
was performed in monkeys and in hemophilia B dogs. In terms of extended half-life of rIX-FP antigen 
levels reveal favourable results. Of note, antibody measurements yielded interesting results as the 
monkeys did not develop any antibodies after the single dose application whereas the haemophilia B 
dogs did. 
In order to evaluate tissue biodistribution of rIX-FP, a quantitative whole-body autoradiography 
(QWBA) study was conducted in rats. In this study it was demonstrated that the tissue distribution of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 29/117 
 
 
 
 
 
[3H]-rIX-FP and [3H]-BeneFIX was comparable, both penetrating predominantly into well vascularized 
tissues and/or excretion organs whereas biodistribution of [3H]-albumin appeared to be different. The 
notion of extended tissue half-life of [3H]-rIX-FP due to albumin fusion was supported as [3H]-rIX-FP 
and [3H]-albumin derived radioactivity was detectable over 120 hours, whereas the radioactivity 
associated with [3H]-BeneFIX was only detectable over 24 hours. These findings support the notion 
that rIX-FP has an extended half-life. 
In terms of toxicology three single dose and two repeat dose toxicology studies were performed. Rats 
and monkeys were selected as they represent the standard animals for these types of toxicological 
investigations and rIX-FP was shown to be pharmacologically active in these species. 
A single intravenous bolus injection of rIX-FP at doses up to 500 IU/kg was well tolerated in 
cynomolgus monkeys and rats with no toxicologically significant changes. The NOAEL was considered 
to be 500 IU/kg for both species. 
An additional toxicity study in rats following a single intravenous administration of the high-dose (500 
IU/kg) including a toxicokinetic analysis was performed to compare the toxicity profile of pilot scale 
(500 L) and commercial scale (2500 L) material. Overall it could be concluded that there were no 
significant toxicities observed after a single intravenous administration of either pilot scale or 
commercial scale material at a nominal dose of 500 IU/kg. There were also no significant differences 
between pilot scale and commercial scale material despite the presence of higher bilirubin 
concentrations within commercial scale material. 
Administration of rIX-FP by intravenous injections on 28 consecutive days at doses up to 500 
IU/kg/day was well tolerated in the rat with no findings indicative of adverse toxicity and a NOAEL of 
500 IU/kg was considered under the conditions of this study. The same was observed following 
repeated dosing in cynomolgus monkeys leading to a NOAEL of 500 IU/kg. 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys showed that rIX-FP elicited a strong immune 
response in the majority of animals characterized by the formation of neutralizing anti-drug-antibodies 
(ADA) against rIX-FP. The number of ADA positive animals increased with the number of dosing 
occasions and the dose level resulting in reduced exposure levels as indicated by reductions in AUC 
and Cmax in ADA positive animals. 
To evaluate the potential genotoxicity risk, two in vitro studies were performed with rIX-FP, i.e. the 
bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames test) and the chromosome aberration test in human 
lymphocytes. Both assays showed no evidence of mutagenic activity. 
Local tolerance investigations were included in the single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats 
and monkeys. Furthermore, a separate local tolerance study was performed in rabbits with no local or 
systemic signs of reaction to treatment leading to the overall conclusion that rIX-FP was locally well 
tolerated following repeated intravenous bolus injections in the rat and cynomolgus monkey and 
following a single intravenous, intra-arterial and perivenous administration to rabbits. 
The thrombogenic potential of rIX-FP was evaluated using a modified Wessler stasis model in rabbits, a 
standard model to investigate thrombogenicity. In this study there was no indication of thrombogenic 
activity at the three doses of rIX-FP tested, i.e. 75 IU/kg, 150 IU/kg and 500 IU/kg. 
Carcinogenicity studies were not submitted and are required for as the proteins in rIX-FP (human 
factor IX and human albumin) are naturally occurring proteins in the human body. For the same 
reasons a justification for omission of studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity is 
acknowledged. However, macro- and histopathological investigations of male and female reproductive 
organs were included in the single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity studies (rats and monkeys) with the 
result that there were no findings indicative of adverse toxicity. Moreover, there is no necessity to 
Assessment report

conduct studies on embryo toxicity and fetal development as the patient population is male. Based on 
the rare occurrence of haemophilia B in women, experience regarding the use of rIX-FP during 
pregnancy is not available. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with rIX-FP. 
Therefore, rIX-FP should be used during pregnancy and lactation only if clearly indicated.  
There is no information on the effects of rIX-FP on fertility (See SmPC section 4.6.). 
No investigations on carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicology have been conducted. 
In accordance with the guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00 rIX-FP as a protein is exempted from an 
environmental risk assessment since proteins are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment. 
Overall, type and amount of investigations on toxicology of rIX-FP are considered sufficient to support 
marketing authorization application of rIX-FP. The results of the toxicology studies do not raise safety 
concerns regarding the use of rIX-FP within the intended dose range. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the extent of the non-clinical toxicology program is considered adequate. Non-clinical data 
reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single and 
repeat dose toxicity, genotoxicity, thrombogenicity and local tolerability.  
The non- clinical aspects of rIX-FP are satisfactorily described and all available information has been 
appropriately included in the SmPC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
For determination of FIX activity in human plasma a one-stage clotting assay was used. In addition, for 
clinical studies 2001 and 2004, a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen assay 
to measure FIX antigen levels in clinical samples was used for correlation purposes. 
Study subjects were tested for inhibitory antibodies against FIX and for antibodies against rIX-FP and 
for the formation of antibodies against Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) host cell proteins. 
All assays were validated for the determination of clinical study samples. Assay validation studies 
included evaluation of linearity, concentration dependence, sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, 
matrix effects, robustness, and influence of residual study drug. Results from all bioanalytical 
validation studies have been provided. 
Plasma samples in which antibodies against CHO host cell proteins are detected above the cut-off in 
the ELISA screening assay undergo further confirmation assays using Surface Plasmon Response (SPR) 
technology. Samples are defined as “positive” as soon as the “enhancement level” is detected above 
the plasma enhancement cut-off. If the confirmation assay is negative, the initial positive response is 
considered to be a false positive result. The assay was validated for determination of antibodies 
against CHO host cell proteins in human plasma samples. Accuracy, precision, repeatability, linearity, 
limit of quantitation and robustness were assessed in the validation. All assessments met pre-defined 
acceptance criteria outlined in the validation protocol. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Studies 2001, 2004, 3001 and 3002 assessed the Pharmacokinetics (PK, based on FIX activities) of 
rIX-FP in 107 unique subjects with hemophilia B (FIX activity ≤ 2%) using at least 1 of 3 different 
doses (25, 50 or 75 IU/kg). The PK of 50 IU/kg previous FIX (pdFIX or rFIX) was also evaluated in a 
subset of subjects in studies 2001, 3001 and 3002. FIX activity measurements from adult and pediatric 
subjects were analyzed using a non-compartmental PK analysis. In addition, population PK analyses 
were conducted on data from studies 2001, 2004, 3001, and 3002 to further characterize the PK of 
rIX-FP. Potential determinants (demographic and clinical covariates) of rIX-FP PK variability and 
simulated FIX activity-time profiles for various dosing regimens of rIX-FP were identified. 
Study 2001 
This phase 1, dose-escalation study in 25 previously treated adult and adolescent subjects (age: 15 to 
58 years) with hemophilia B, evaluated the safety and PK of 25, 50, and 75 IU/kg rIX-FP. Dose was 
applied at least 4 days after administration of their previously given FIX product. Blood samples for PK 
assessment were taken before injection of rIX-FP and at the following time points after injection of rIX-
FP: 30 minutes, and 3, 6, 9, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, 240 and 336 hours. The study recorded incremental 
recovery, in vivo half-life (t1/2), area under the curve (AUC) and clearance (CL). All subjects completed 
the study and no subjects were discontinued.

Study 2004 
This phase 1 / 2 study evaluated the safety, PK, and efficacy of rIX-FP as both prophylaxis and on-
demand therapy. 13 subjects (aged 15 to 46 years) received 25 IU/kg rIX-FP as a single intravenous 
(IV) injection for PK-evaluation. Dose was applied at least 4 days after administration of their 
previously given FIX product. Blood samples for PK assessment were taken before injection of rIX-FP 
and at the following time points after injection of rIX-FP: 30 minutes, and 3, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, 
240, and 336 hours. The study recorded incremental recovery, in vivo half-life (t1/2), area under the

Study 3001 
This pivotal phase 2 / 3 study evaluated safety, efficacy, and PK of rIX-FP as both routine prophylaxis, 
and on-demand treatment for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes in subjects with 
hemophilia B (FIX activity ≤ 2%). A total of 63 subjects were enrolled in the study including 40 
subjects in the prophylaxis arm (Arm 1) and 23 subjects in the on-demand arm (Arm 2). Of subjects 
who never received rIX-FP before, PK-evaluation with their previous FIX-product was done. Repeat PK 
was done in 15 subjects after approximately 6 months. An additional subset of subjects had a PK 
assessment with a dose of 75 IU/kg at approximately 6 months prior to switching to the 10- or 14-day 
treatment regimen. 
The PK data presented herein focus on FIX activity levels and PK parameters derived from FIX activity 
data. Blood samples were collected for PK analysis prior to injection, and at 30 minutes, 3, 24, 48, 72,

120, 168, 240 hours after injection of both 25 and 50 IU/kg rIX-FP. For the 50 IU/kg rIX-FP dose and 
repeat PK, blood samples were also collected at 336 hours.  
A summary of the plasma FIX activity PK parameters for 50 IU/kg rIX-FP and previous FIX product are 
presented in Table 6: 
Table 6 Study 3001: Summary of Mean (CV%) FIX Activity PK Parameters after 50 
IU/kg rIX-FP and 50 IU/kg of previous FIX product (PK Population) 
When comparing the PK parameters for 50 IU/kg rIX-FP with those of 50 IU/kg rFIX, mean IR 
(baseline-corrected) was 52% higher (1.27 vs 0.834 [IU/dL]/[IU/kg]), mean t1/2 was 4.2-fold longer 
(102 vs 24.2 hours), mean plasma MRT was 4-fold longer (140 vs 35.3 hours), mean plasma AUC0-inf 
was 5.1-fold larger (7176 vs 1396 IU*h/dL), and mean CL was 81% lower (0.769 vs 4.03 mL/h/kg) 
(Table 7). IR and cmax of pd FIX were similar to rIX-FP. 
After administration of 25 IU/kg rIX-FP, mean IR (baseline-corrected) was 1.29 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg), mean 
t1/2 was 90.0 hours, mean cmax was 33.6 IU/dl, mean MRT was 134 hours, mean plasma AUC0-inf was 
4253 IU*h/dL, and mean CL was 0.665 mL/h/kg (n = 6). After administration of 75 IU/kg rIX-FP, 
mean baseline-corrected IR was 1.04 (IU/dL)/(IU/kg) and Cmax was 77.3 IU/dL (n = 5). 
After administration of a single IV injection of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP, mean FIX activity remained above 5% 
through Day 14, which supports the feasibility of a dosing interval once up to every 2 weeks.

Elderly 
No subjects over the age of 65 were enrolled in any of the clinical studies. Therefore, no PK / exposure 
data in the elderly were generated. 
Children: Paediatric study 3002 
27 Pediatric subjects under 12 years of age (12 subjects < 6 years and 15 subjects 6 to < 12 years) 
were enrolled into study 3002. 11 adolescent subjects (12 to < 18 years) were included in studies 
2001 (1 subject), 2004 (3 subjects), and 3001 (7 subjects).  
Plasma FIX activity was measured before injection and then at 30 minutes, and 3, 24, 48, 72, 120, 
168, 240, and 336 hours after injection of rIX-FP. A PK evaluation of previous FIX product was also 
conducted in a subset of subjects with no historical PK data of their previous FIX product. Plasma FIX 
activity of a subject’s previous FIX product was measured before injection and then at 30 minutes, and 
10, 24, and 48 hours after injection of the previous FIX product.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Population PK analysis was conducted in 104 subjects to further characterize the PK of rIX-FP in adults, 
adolescents and children with hemophilia, as well to describe and to identify determinants 
(demographic and clinical covariates) of rIX-FP PK variability and to subsequently undertake 
simulations of FIX activity-time profiles for various dosing regimens of rIX-FP. 
Observed FIX activity levels were modeled as the sum of the endogenous baseline level (with a limit of 
≤  2%), any residual contribution from the previous FIX product and the FIX activity levels attributed 
to rIX-FP administration. Where subjects had an observed FIX activity value above 2% prior to the first 
dose of rIX-FP, this was assumed to reflect residual contribution of the previous FIX product in addition 
to the true endogenous FIX activity levels. 
The final FIX activity population PK model for rIX-FP was used to simulate activity-time profiles 
following single and steady-state dosing of different rIX-FP dosing scenarios in adolescent, adult and 
pediatric populations. The simulated exogenous FIX age-related activity-time profile after single 
injections of 25, 40, 50, and 75 IU/kg rIX-FP is shown in Table 12 The simulated steady-state trough 
exogenous FIX activity levels are summarized in Table 13.

Table 13 Summary of the simulated trough exogenous FIX activity following 
multiple doses of 25, 40, 50, and 75 IU/kg rIX-FP 
Overall, the population PK simulation supports the dose regimens of 25 to 40 IU/kg weekly, 50 IU/kg 
every 10 days, and 50 to 75 IU/kg every 14 days in all ages. Alternatively, the dose regimens can be 
selected according to the desired FIX activity troughs based on the simulated FIX activity-time profile; 
in all age groups, a fixed monthly FIX consumption may be used to effectively provide the desired FIX 
activity troughs, with the understanding that a lower dose combined with shorter treatment interval 
may offer a higher trough than a higher dose combined with longer treatment interval. 
Comparison and Analyses of Results across studies

respective individual studies.

Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single injection of rIX-FP 
The prolonged t1/2 and higher IR values resulting from a single injection of rIX-FP demonstrate the 
improved PK compared with previous FIX products. When comparing 50 IU/kg rIX-FP with 50 IU/kg 
rFIX, mean IR was 1.4-fold higher, mean t1/2 was 4.4-fold longer, and mean CL was 81% lower. 
Table 14 Summary of mean (CV%) single injection PK parameters (adults 18 to ≤ 
65 years) (Pooled PK Population) 
Body Weight: Body weight had a statistically significant influence on CL, and both central and 
peripheral volumes of distribution (V1 and V2); the CL of FIX activity on a per kg body weight basis 
was higher in younger subjects. However, weight was not a significant covariate on CL within the 
weight range for adult / adolescent age group (ie, ≥ 12 years). 
Age: Consistent with ontogeny and observations from other available FIX replacement products, the PK 
of rIX-FP is similarly influenced by age. This is reflected by decreased t1/2 and MRT, as well as 
increased values of CL in subjects 0 to < 12 years of age. The CL values in pediatric subjects (mean 
1.18 mL/h/kg for subjects 0 to < 6 years and 1.06 mL/h/kg for subjects 6 to < 12 years) were higher 
than those observed in adults (0.765 mL/h/kg for subjects ≥ 12 to 65 years). 
The mean IR values for rIX-FP were lower in the 0 to < 6 year age group (mean 0.95 [IU/dL]/[IU/kg]) 
than in the 12 to ≤ 65 year age group (1.28 [IU/dL]/[IU/kg]) (Table 15).  
The population PK analysis examined the potential effect of age on CL, in addition to body weight; age 
did not provide any significant improvement on the model fitting, and no additional effect of age on 
other PK parameters was identified. The apparent lack of an age effect is likely to result from the 
strong correlation between age and total body weight in the pediatric population. 
Other Factors: In the population PK report, BMI, AST and ALT levels, and creatinine clearance were 
analyzed in 104 subjects, and no relevant effects were observed.

Pharmacokinetics assessment in adult and adolescent subjects with Haemophilia B covers 3 clinical 
studies (2001, 2004 and 3001) with dose-escalation (50, 25, 75 IU/kg) with complete PK-evaluation 
and investigation covering 3 dosages (including a reduced dose of 25 IU/kg), comparison with previous 
products and repeat PK. Population PK analysis identified potential demographic and clinical covariates 
of rIX-FP and simulated FIX activity-time profiles for various dosing regimens of rIX-FP. In addition, 
PK-evaluation in paediatric subjects <12 years of age has been provided in study 3002.

When using an in vitro thromboplastin time (aPTT)-based one stage clotting assay for determining 
Factor IX activity in patients’ blood samples, plasma factor IX activity results can be significantly 
affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay. Measurement 
with a one-stage clotting assay using a kaolin based aPTT reagent or Actin FS aPTT reagent will likely 
result in an underestimation of activity level. This is of importance particularly when changing the 
laboratory and/or reagents used in the assay. The challenge of the use of different aPTT reagents has 
been stated in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
The Clinical Guideline has been met, in general, i.e. in terms of number of subjects at least 12; PK 
parameters [Incremental recovery, in vivo half-life, AUC, Clearance], wash-out-period of 4 days, dose 
suggestion of the Guideline (50-75 IU/kg); number of lots used; sampling intervals amended when 
needed in accordance with the extended half-life. 
In study 2001, a dose-escalation PK-study covering 25, 50 and 75 IU/kg (7, 13 and 8 subjects, 
respectively) and comparison with standard recombinant and plasma-derived FIX for the 50 IU/kg dose 
has been performed (4 and 8 subjects, respectively). For rIX-FP, sampling points have been adapted to 
the assumed extended half-life (10-15 min and 1h p.i. has been replaced by 30 min; 50h has been 
deleted, additional samples at 120, 168, 240 and 336 hours have been added). “True” cmax and 
incremental recovery might have been missed by this schedule between 30 minutes and 3 hours p.i.; 
the other samples are considered to be extensive and adequate. Comparison with well-known plasma-
derived and recombinant FIX is acknowledged. However, sampling points for these “previous” products 
have been reduced, (baseline, 25-35 min, 1-3, 8-12, 20-26 and 32-48h post infusion). Reliability of 
the comparison of such different data-sets (comparator: sampling up to 32-48h p.i., rFIX-FP up to 
336h) as linked due to ethical reasons (use of well-known product in a clinical trial). Minimum activities 
were above 4.6 IU/dl at day 7 for 25 IU/kg, above 3.7 IU/dl at day 10 for 50 IU/dl and above 3.9 IU/dl 
for 75IU/dl at day 14. Maximum activity concentrations did not exceed 100 IU/dl even in the 75 IU/kg 
group.  
Results show significantly extended half-life of rIX-FP compared with pdFIX and rFIX and dose-
dependent factor activity levels. However, median IR decreased with increasing dose which does not 
support dose-linearity.   
In Study 2004 PK-evaluation covered 13 subjects and the dose of 25 IU/kg. Calculated PK parameters 
included Incremental recovery, in vivo half-life, AUC, and Clearance, the chosen dose of 25 IU/kg is 
significantly lower than suggested in the Clinical Guideline (50-75 IU/kg) but adapted to the assumed 
extended half-life. According to the Clinical Guideline, samples should be taken at baseline, 10-15, 30 
minutes,1 hour, 3, 6, 9, 24, 48, and 50 hours post-infusion with a 72 hours optional sample. In study 
2004, samples were taken before injection and 30 minutes, and 3, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, 240, and 336 
hours after the injection. Thus, sampling has been adapted to the assumed extended half-life, which is 
considered to be acceptable with the exception of the early phase up to 3 hours p.i.as for study 2001. 
Baseline-corrected AUC, CL and t1/2 relevantly differ from baseline-uncorrected values: AUC0-∞: 2698 
h*IU/dl (compared with 3414), t1/2: 69,1 h (compared with 94.8), CL: 0.96 ml/h/kg (compared with 
0.74) whereas IR and cmax are similar. However, population-PK analysis takes into account confounding 
factors. In vivo recovery data after first use of the commercial scale batch were similar to previous 
data.  
In Study 3001 calculated PK parameters of overall 63 subjects included incremental recovery, in vivo 
half-life, AUC, and Clearance. Dosages cover 25, 50 and 75 IU/kg and sampling has been adapted to 
the assumed extended half-life, which is considered to be acceptable. Repeat PK shows an increase of 
IR (baseline-corrected from 1.28 to 1.40 (IU/dl) / (IU/kg), cmax (68.1 to 74.3 IU/dl), AUC0-∞ (7904 to 
9979 IU*h/dl) and t1/2 (112.1 to 128 h).

In both age groups (0 to < 6 years and 6 to < 12 years), the plasma FIX activity was higher after 
injection of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP compared with 50 IU/kg of previous FIX product. Mean plasma FIX activity 
levels were numerically lower in the younger age group (ie, 0 to < 6 years) than the older age group 
(ie, 6 to < 12 years). Disregarding above discussed methodical aspects, mean and median plasma FIX 
activities after a single dose of 50 IU/kg of rIX-FP were above 2% at Day 14. 
The results of Study 3002 demonstrate that the PK parameters of the younger pediatric age group (ie, 
0 to < 6 years) are similar to those of the older pediatric age group (ie, 6 to < 12 years), though CL 
was marginally higher. However, results differ from the adult population,. Documented median activity 
levels of >2 IU/dl at day 14 support prolonged treatment interval for prophylaxis, in children <12 
years of age. 
FIX activity was well described by a 2-compartment population PK model with body weight and weight-
adjusted dose being the only significant covariates. The estimated endogenous FIX activity levels were 
consistent with levels observed in patients with hemophilia B and FIX activity ≤ 2%. FIX antigen was 
well described by a 2-compartment population PK model with allometric scaling. The FIX antigen model 
confirmed PK linearity of the rIX-FP protein. 
Using the final FIX activity population PK model to perform simulations, the median peak FIX activity 
after a single 50 IU/kg injection of rIX-FP was predicted to be at least 40 IU/dL (age ≥ 12 years: ~55 
IU/dL; age 6 to < 12 years: ~45 IU/dL; age 0 to < 6 years: ~40 IU/dL). In all age groups, the 
simulated median trough FIX activity between injections exceeded ~3% for rIX-FP dosing regimens of 
25 IU/kg or 40 IU/kg weekly, and 50 IU/kg every 10 days. In the adult / adolescent age group and the 
older pediatric age group (ie, 6 to < 12 years), the simulated median trough FIX activity between 
injections exceeded ~2% with a rIX-FP dosing regimen of 50 IU/kg every 14 days. In the younger 
pediatric age group (ie, 0 to < 6 years), a rIX-FP dose of 75 IU/kg every 14 days was required to 
maintain median trough FIX activity levels between injections above 2%.). Extended half-life and 
consequential reduction of treatment frequency has been presented within the Population-PK-
Modelling. Furthermore, dose-dependent posology and age-adjusted dosage has been presented. 
Overall, the approach supports the suggested decrease of injection frequency as well as the potential 
of reduced dosage in adults and children (See discussion on clinical efficacy).  
Considerable inter-individual PK-variability is known to be challenging for Haemophilia B. Therefore, 
when generating representative data, most homogenous patient group of severely affected individuals 
should be chosen and for this Population PK analysis, stratification for true severe Hemophilia 
(endogenous activity <1%) and truly followed wash-out-period was performed. Overall, 19 of 83 
subjects had non-severe haemophilia. Numbers within each study and treatment-group are considered 
to be low. However, these data show that especially half-life and AUC might be relevantly increased for 
patients with less severe type of haemophilia. Furthermore, stratified analysis covering severe 
haemophilia and true washout as requested by the Clinical Guideline presents lower values than those 
without stratification. These findings are considered to be plausible and support the concern of patient-
selection having at least contributed to the incongruence of encouraging PK-results and efficacy 
results. Data were reflected in the SmPC section 5.2.

When analyzing the results of the pooled analysis, the assumed half-life extension of rIX-FP even in 
“lower” dosages (25 IU/kg) in comparison with standard FIX has been elaborated and is considered to 
offer relevant options for treatment-adaptation. Overall numbers of subjects as well as developmental 
approaches are acknowledged. However, methodological points need to be taken into account 
according to the above mentioned points: Sampling for previous FIX has been substantially reduced 
and comparison might therefore be challenging; missing early phase sampling between 30 min and 3 
hours p.i. remains open; patient population of 75 IU/kg dosing-group is constituted of 3 subjects – 
which is considered to be low. Non-severe hemophilia and increased pre-dose activities are not in table 
14; correction of early-phase results (e.g IR and cmax) for carry-over effects and late- or whole-phase 
results (e.g. t1/2 and AUC) for non-severe haemophilia. 
Age-dependent results support the need for dose-adjustments in the paediatric age-group. Dose-
dependency as well as age-dependency is evident but not surprising; differences of PK-results between 
studies with similar doses are considered to be interesting and might be reason for further 
considerations. 
The PK-data-package is considered to support the assumption of clinically relevant half-life-extension 
of rIX-FP. 50 IU/kg has been used as target-dosage for PK-evaluation, which is covered by the clinical 
guideline, representing the lower range. Even a significantly lower dose (25 IU/kg) than suggested by 
the Guideline has been shown to induce protective FIX-levels. Maximum activity levels remain below 
100 IU/dl, which is considered to be relevant for assumed thrombogenic potential. In addition, PK-
comparison of previous treatment with rIX-FP is acknowledged. Details as true wash-out-periods and 
the gap in sampling between 30 min and 3 hours for rIX-FP, representing the early PK-phase and 
cmax, require further elucidation. Implications for PK-Modelling and reflection in the SmPC depend on 
the results of such discussion. An increased targeted trough-level of 5-10% FIX activity can explain 
increased dosage and dose-guidance (See SmPC).  
Pharmacokinetic data in elderly subjects beyond 60 years of age have not been provided and such data 
are not requested by the Clinical Guideline.  However, information on the elderly will be needed to 
bridge a potential gap with the aging haemophilia community; it will be provided on an ongoing basis 
at post-authorisation phase (See RMP).   
No clinical evaluation has been provided for impaired renal or hepatic function. Population PK modelling 
has been performed for adults, adolescents and paediatric subjects. PK-result-stratification with regard 
to severity of haemophilia and correctly met wash-out period has been provided. Justification provided 
for increased dosages includes increased target trough-levels of FIX-activity: In general, trough levels 
of 1% are aimed at; in clinical studies with albutrepenonacog alfa 5-10% was targeted. Simulated PK-
results for such increased levels roughly match the documented dosages within the efficacy studies 
(See also discussion on clinical efficacy). See Section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Recommendation for up to 14-days extended treatment-interval is based on clinical efficacy data (See 
also discussion on clinical efficacy)  from  26 selected patients have been switched from once-weekly 
to extended intervals (10 days or 14 days) meeting selection criteria reflecting lower bleeding risk and 
21 Subjects switched to a 14-days interval.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics data in adults support a clinically relevant half-life-extension of rIX-FP and the 
posology as recommended in the SmPC.  
Assessment report

PK results support half-life extension in children. Age-dependent results support the need for dose-
adjustments in the paediatric age-group. PK results have been appropriately reflected in the SmPC.

Study 2004: Safety, PK and Efficacy study for Prophylaxis and Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 
This prospective, open-label, phase 1 / 2 study was designed to evaluate the safety, PK, and efficacy 
of rIX-FP for both prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with 
hemophilia B (FIX activity of ≤ 2%). 
Methods 
The study consisted of a screening period of up to 30 days, a PK evaluation period of 7 to 14 days, and 
a treatment period of at least 20 weeks. (Figure 4) During the treatment period, subjects were 
administered rIX-FP as prophylaxis and / or on-demand treatment. 
Figure 1: Study Design of Study 2004

Treatments 
Prophylaxis Treatment 
Subjects in the prophylaxis treatment group administered a single IV infusion of rIX-FP once a week 
(ie, 7-day treatment interval) at a dose of 15 to 35 IU/kg, or at a dose determined by the investigator. 
The initial rIX-FP dose was based on the subject’s PK profile, determined during the PK evaluation 
period and / or the phase 1 study (2001), and the subject’s bleeding phenotype. The dose was 
adjusted up to 75 IU/kg to maintain the trough FIX activity level > 1% between infusions. 
Subjects in the prophylaxis treatment group could also administer rIX-FP for the control of bleeding 
episodes (ie, on-demand treatment) or the prevention of bleeding prior to activity. 
On-demand Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 
Subjects receiving on-demand treatment were administered 1 or more IV infusions of rIX-FP at a dose 
of at least 25 IU/kg to treat minor, moderate or major bleeding episodes. The dose of rIX-FP was 
calculated by the investigator, based on the subject’s PK profile determined during the PK evaluation 
period and / or the phase 1 study (2001), and the dose and / or maintenance dose required to achieve 
and maintain the FIX activity level recommended by the World Federation of Hemophilia. 
Minor and moderate bleeding episodes were treated by the subject or their caregiver. Major bleeding 
episodes including life-threatening bleeding episodes and severe bleeding into a joint or muscle, were 
treated at a hemophilia center. 
Duration of treatment for subjects receiving prophylaxis treatment with rIX-FP was approximately 9 to 
11 months and for subjects receiving on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes was approximately 4 
to 6 months. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety of intravenous rIX-FP. Safety was 
evaluated by the nature and incidence of adverse events (AEs), laboratory changes over time, inhibitor 
formation and antibody development against rIX-FP. 
The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the PK of rIX-FP and to evaluate the clinical 
response of routine prophylaxis with rIX-FP with respect to the prevention of bleeding episodes. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoints represent Safety endpoints. 
Secondary PK Endpoints represent PK-endpoints and the number of breakthrough bleeding episodes in 
subjects receiving a prophylaxis treatment regimen with rIX-FP during the last 12 weeks (eg, from 
Week 9 to Week 20) in the per-protocol population. 
Exploratory Endpoints: rIX-FP consumption during the last 12-week period (eg, from Week 9 to Week 
20) compared to previous FIX consumption during the 12 weeks prophylactic therapy prior to 
screening; proportion of prophylaxis subjects on weekly routine prophylactic treatment on Week 20 or 
at end of the study; rIX-FP consumption per infusion, while maintaining weekly prophylactic treatment 
interval during routine prophylaxis on Week 20 or at end of the study; proportion of bleeding episodes 
requiring one or two infusions of rIX-FP to achieve hemostasis; Investigator’s overall clinical 
assessment of haemostatic efficacy for treatment of bleeding episodes, based on a four point ordinal 
scale (excellent, good, moderate, poor/ none).

treatment dose, for PK assessment; addition of an additional PK evaluation period for subjects in the 
prophylaxis treatment group before being treated with the GMP commercial-scale rIX-FP for the first 
time; clarification that for the on-demand treatment of a bleeding episode, the study subject’s PK data 
from this study and / or PK data from the phase 1 study may be utilized for calculating the initial 
treatment doses for the treatment of bleeding episodes as recommended by the WFH and also local 
treatment protocol / practice; clarification that the assessment of pain relief at the 16 and 24 hours 
after infusion time points are optional. 
Protocol deviations 
There were 70 protocol deviations documented for 16 of 17 subjects during the study. All protocol 
deviations related to minor infringements and none of these protocol deviations resulted in subject 
withdrawal from the study or exclusion from the analysis populations. 
Baseline data 
The mean total bleeding episodes experienced by subjects in the 12 months before study entry was 
14.0 in the prophylaxis group (n = 13) compared with 27.0 in the on-demand group (n = 4). Ten of 13 
subjects in the prophylaxis group previously received prophylaxis treatment and experienced a mean 
of 5.2 bleeding episodes in the 12 months before study entry, compared with a mean of 43.3 bleeding 
episodes in the 3 subjects in the prophylaxis group who had previously received only on-demand 
treatment.  
All subjects were male and of white race. The majority (14/17; 82.4%) of subjects were ≥ 18 years 
old; in the prophylaxis treatment group, there were 3 subjects < 18 years old (ages: 13, 15, and 16 
years) (Table 19). All subjects had been diagnosed with hemophilia B and had been previously treated 
with an FIX product (ie, pdFIX or rFIX). 
In the prophylaxis treatment group, there were 3 subjects < 18 years old. Other baseline 
characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. 
All subjects had been diagnosed with hemophilia B and were previously treated with a FIX product (ie, 
pdFIX or rFIX). A total of 10 subjects had received prophylaxis therapy before study entry; all of these 
subjects were in the prophylaxis treatment group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 53/117 
 
 
 
 
 
The per-protocol population consisted of the 15 subjects who completed the study without any major 
protocol violations or deviations; 2 subjects (50010003 and 50010004) did not complete the protocol 
due to a decision by the sponsor to enroll these subjects in another rIX-FP study (3001). 
Table 18 Demographic and baseline characteristics (safety population) 
The weight and body mass index of subjects (mean ± SD) was 66.8 ± 13.5 kg (min: 36.0 kg, max: 
93.0 kg) and 21.8 ± 3.5 kg/m2 (min: 16.4 kg/m2, max: 31.4 kg/m2), respectively. There was no 
notable difference in weight, height and body mass index between the 2 treatment groups. 
Numbers analysed 
The efficacy population consisted of 17 subjects who participated in the efficacy portion of the study 
and received at least 1 dose of rIX-FP; 13 subjects were in the prophylaxis treatment group (all from 
the study center in Israel) and 4 subjects were in the on-demand treatment group (all from the study 
center in Bulgaria). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy was evaluated based on the number and type of bleeding episodes, rIX-FP consumption, the 
number of infusions required to achieve hemostasis, the investigator’s assessment of efficacy, the dose 
of rIX-FP administered, changes to the treatment regimen, and the time of the most recent infusion of 
rIX-FP and the start of a spontaneous bleeding episode (ie, for subjects in the prophylaxis treatment 
group). These efficacy evaluations were determined from the data collected in the treatment period 
only, and not the PK evaluation period, unless otherwise indicated. Similar results for all efficacy 
parameters were obtained for the efficacy and PP populations. 
The outcome measures that support efficacy for the indication of routine prophylaxis include 
annualized spontaneous bleeding rate (AsBR) and consumption. 
In both the prophylaxis and on-demand treatment groups, subjects experienced either spontaneous or 
traumatic bleeding episodes; there were no post-surgery bleeding episodes reported for either group. 
In the prophylaxis treatment group, 5/13 subjects (38.5%) did not experience a bleeding episode 
requiring treatment during the treatment period. The other 8/13 subjects (61.5%) in this treatment 
group experienced at least 1 bleeding episode requiring treatment during the treatment period. In the 
on-demand treatment group, all subjects (4/4; 100%) experienced at least 1 bleeding episode

requiring treatment. In both treatment groups, all bleeding episodes were either minor or moderate in 
severity. 
Spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes were collected and compared:

episodes 
Consumption of rIX-FP During Weekly Prophylaxis 
During the treatment period, all 13 subjects in the prophylaxis treatment group administered (mean ± 
SD) 4.4 ± 0.1 infusions per subject per month for weekly prophylaxis, with an rIX-FP prophylaxis dose 
per infusion (mean ± SD) of 55.1 ± 13.9 IU/kg. The total dose of rIX-FP administered per subject per 
month (mean ± SD) as weekly prophylaxis was 243.2 ± 36.8 IU/kg per month. 
The 10 subjects in the prophylaxis treatment group, who had received prophylaxis treatment with a 
different FIX replacement product before study entry, administered a lower total weekly dose of rIX-FP 
compared with the weekly dose of the FIX replacement product previously used for prophylaxis 
treatment. During the last 12 weeks of the treatment period these subjects administered a total dose 
(mean ± SD) of rIX-FP of 58.6 ± 10.7 IU/kg as routine prophylaxis. During the 12-week period before 
study entry, these same 10 subjects administered a total dose (mean ± SD) of other FIX replacement 
product of 87.7 ± 45.8 IU/kg.

Assessment of Haemostatic Efficacy 
The investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy of rIX-FP for each bleeding 
episode was based on the subject’s assessment of pain relief and the number of infusions needed to 
establish hemostasis. 
The investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy of rIX-FP, reported for all 85 minor or moderate 
bleeding episodes requiring treatment, was either excellent or good for the majority of bleeding 
episodes (excellent: 53/85 bleeding episodes, 62.4%; good: 29/85 bleeding episodes, 34.1%); 
haemostatic efficacy was assessed as moderate for the other 3 bleeding episodes (3.5%). There were 
no major bleeding episodes reported during the study.

and Moderate Bleeding episodes (Efficacy Population) 
Dose and Dose Adjustment 
All subjects in the prophylaxis treatment group were assigned a treatment schedule of once every 
week, which was maintained for the duration of the treatment period. These 13 subjects were 
prescribed an initial weekly prophylaxis rIX-FP dose (mean ± SD) of 30.4 ± 3.2 IU/kg (min: 25.0 
IU/kg, max: 35.0 IU/kg)

At the end of the treatment period, the dose (mean ± SD) of rIX-FP prescribed for weekly prophylaxis 
was 61.9 ± 11.5 IU/kg (min: 50.0 IU/kg, max: 75.0 IU/kg). The dose of rIX-FP administered per 
infusion over the treatment period was 55.0 ± 13.9 IU/kg. 
The initial dose (mean ± SD) of rIX-FP prescribed for the on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes 
was 33.3 ± 2.4 IU/kg (n = 17). Subjects in the prophylaxis treatment group were prescribed a slightly 
higher initial dose of rIX-FP for the on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes than subjects in the on-
demand treatment group. At the end of the treatment period, the dose of rIX-FP prescribed for the on-
demand treatment of bleeding episodes was 57.4 ± 15.9 IU/kg; the dose prescribed for subjects in the 
prophylaxis treatment group (50 to 75 IU/kg) was higher than the dose prescribed for subjects in the 
on-demand treatment group (26.5 to 30.0 IU/kg).

Study 3001: Safety, PK and Efficacy study for Prophylaxis and Treatment of Bleeding 
Episodes 
This prospective, open-label, phase 2 / 3 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of rIX-FP in 
preventing bleeding episodes (prophylaxis), safety of rIX-FP with respect to the development of 
inhibitors against factor IX (FIX) in subjects with hemophilia B (FIX activity of ≤ 2%) and the efficacy 
of rIX-FP in the prevention and control of bleeding during surgical procedures. 
The study consisted of a 1-month screening period, a PK evaluation period of up to 14 days, and a 
treatment period lasting between 12 and 14 months. During the treatment period, subjects were 
administered rIX-FP as prophylaxis and / or on-demand treatment. Any subject requiring 
nonemergency surgery during the course of the study could be enrolled in the surgery substudy.

Treatments 
The main study consisted of a PK period, and an active treatment period for all subjects. Any subjects 
requiring nonemergency surgery during the course of the study could be enrolled in the surgical 
substudy. The surgical substudy included a PK period, if required, and an active treatment period after 
which subjects resumed their assigned treatment plan in the main study. 
To evaluate both the treatment (control and prevention) of bleeding episodes and the prophylaxis 
treatment regimen, subjects who were receiving on-demand treatment with FIX and subjects who 
were receiving prophylaxis therapy with FIX were both enrolled into the study. All subjects received 
rIX-FP and were assigned to treatment groups (prophylaxis [Arm 1] or on-demand [Arm 2]) based on 
their history of use with FIX products. Subjects in the prophylaxis treatment arm were further stratified 
into 1 of 3 treatment blocks: Block A (prophylaxis subjects who completed Study CSL654_2004), Block 
B (first 15 non-CSL654_2004 subjects), or Block C (remaining subjects who enrolled in the study). 
Subjects in Arm 2 received on-demand treatment for 26 weeks and then the number of bleeding 
episodes was recorded in order to calculate the ABR. Subjects then switched to a 7 day prophylaxis 
regimen for approximately 26 weeks (minimum of 12 weeks), and the ABR on prophylaxis was 
compared to on-demand treatment. This design allowed subjects to serve as their own control in 
measuring the difference in the ABR between the on-demand and prophylaxis treatments. 
The PK of 50 IU/kg of rIX-FP was evaluated at the beginning of the study in all subjects except the 
subjects who had a PK assessment performed in study 2004. The PK of 25 IU/kg of rIX-FP was also 
assessed in 6 subjects who received an initial dose of 25 IU/kg under the original protocol. 
The recommended doses for each arm in this study (prophylaxis [Arm 1] and on-demand [Arm 2]) 
were selected based on group PK data from a previous Phase 1 study (2001). The desired FIX activity 
level for the treatment of a bleeding episode for subjects in both treatment arms was based on the 
recommendation of the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH). The calculated dose should have been 
in the range of 35 to 50 IU/kg. If a subject had a low recovery rate and/or experienced a more severe 
bleeding episode, the dose could exceed 50 IU/kg up to a maximum of 75 IU/kg. 
Prophylaxis dosing for Arm 1: 
Subjects in the prophylaxis treatment group (Arm 1) received a weekly prophylaxis dose of 35 to 50 
IU/kg rIX-FP for 26 to 30 weeks, after which subjects could switch to a 10-day or 14-day prophylaxis 
regimen at a dose of 75 IU/kg rIX-FP for an additional ≥ 30 weeks, if specified criteria were met. 
If a subject experienced at least 1 spontaneous hemorrhage during any 28-day period of prophylaxis 
treatment, the dose of rIX-FP could be increased, up to a maximum dose of 75 IU/kg rIX-FP with a 
target of maintaining the trough FIX activity level above 1% between doses, while maintaining a 
treatment interval of 7 days. The dose could also be decreased during the weekly prophylaxis period 
based on clinical outcome and FIX trough levels. 
To change to a new dose and dosing regimen, a subject must have met all of the following criteria: 
was on a stable dose in the previous month (no dose adjustment); did not experience a spontaneous 
bleeding episode in the previous month; was currently on a weekly prophylaxis dose of ≤ 50 IU/kg rIX-
FP; was willing to switch to a longer treatment interval. 
Subjects whose current weekly dose was ≤ 40 IU/kg rIX-FP could switch to a 14-day interval at a dose 
of 75 IU/kg rIX-FP. Subjects whose current weekly dose was > 40 to ≤ 50 IU/kg rIX-FP could switch to 
a 10-day interval at a dose of 75 IU/kg rIX-FP. Subjects whose current weekly dose was > 50 IU/kg 
rIX-FP were to maintain their current dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 62/117 
 
 
 
 
 
If a subject was receiving the 14-day treatment regimen and experienced 2 spontaneous hemorrhages 
at any location during a 2-month period of prophylaxis treatment, the treatment interval could be 
reduced to 10 days. If a subject was receiving the 10-day treatment regimen and experienced 2 
spontaneous hemorrhages at any location during a 2-month period of prophylaxis treatment, the 
treatment interval could be reduced to 7 days and the stable 7-day regimen dose prior to the regimen 
switch was to be resumed. 
Subjects who did not meet the criteria to switch or did not wish to switch were to continue on the 7-
day treatment interval at the current dose for the remainder of the study. 
Prophylaxis dosing for Arm 2: 
On-demand subjects switched to a 7-day prophylaxis regimen of 35 to 50 IU/kg rIX-FP after either 
completing 26 weeks (minimum of 12 weeks) of on-demand treatment with rIX-FP or experiencing at 
least 12 spontaneous bleeding episodes, whichever occurred first. On-demand subjects maintained the 
7-day prophylaxis treatment interval for the remainder of the study. 
During the first 4 weeks of prophylaxis treatment, the dose of rIX-FP could be increased from an initial 
dose of 35 to 50 IU/kg to a maximum dose of 75 IU/kg, if needed, while maintaining a treatment 
interval of 7 days. The dose prescribed after 4 weeks of prophylaxis treatment was maintained for the 
remainder of the study. 
On-demand dosing for all subjects: 
For the on-demand treatment of a bleeding episode, the subject’s PK data from this study was utilized 
for calculating the initial treatment doses for the treatment of bleeding episodes as recommended by 
the WFH, with a minimum dose of 35 IU/kg of rIX-FP. After hemostasis was achieved, maintenance 
dose(s) of rIX-FP may have been prescribed at the discretion of the Investigator. During the 
prophylaxis treatment period, subjects were to maintain the prophylaxis treatment schedule, if 
possible, while receiving on-demand treatment for a bleeding episode. 
Surgical dosing: 
Dosing and treatment during the surgical period, as recommended by the WFH for surgery, was 
dependent on the type of surgery. During the preoperative treatment period, the dose was selected 
based on the subject’s individual PK parameters in the range of 50 to 75 IU/kg, in order to increase the 
FIX activity levels to 60% to 80%. During the intraoperative treatment period, the subject could 
receive doses of rIX-FP depending on the FIX activity levels, type of surgery, and local standard of 
care. The trough FIX activity level was to be maintained at 60% to 80% during the major surgical 
procedure. The subject received postoperative doses of rIX-FP from 1 to 14 days depending on the FIX 
activity levels and type of surgery as recommended by the WFH. FIX activity levels were to be 
measured prior to repeat dosing during the intraoperative and postoperative treatment periods. 
Efficacy and safety assessments were performed at the study center on a monthly basis. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy of rIX-FP in preventing bleeding 
episodes (prophylaxis) in subjects with severe hemophilia B (FIX activity of ≤2%). 
The primary objective of the surgical substudy was to evaluate the efficacy of rIX-FP in the prevention 
and control of bleeding in subjects with severe hemophilia B (FIX activity of ≤2%) during surgical 
procedures. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 63/117 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate the PK of a single dose of rIX-FP and the 
clinical response to rIX-FP for the prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes. Further secondary 
objective was the evaluation of the efficacy of rIX-FP in surgical prophylaxis (primary objective of the 
surgical substudy) 
The secondary objective of the surgical substudy was to evaluate the safety of rIX-FP during the 
intraoperative and postoperative periods. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the annualized spontaneous bleeding rate (AsBR) for treated 
bleeding episodes during on-demand treatment compared with that during routine prophylaxis 
treatment.  
Secondary Endpoints: 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were the number of infusions to achieve hemostasis; investigator’s 
overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for the treatment of bleeding episodes, based on a 
four point ordinal scale (excellent, good, moderate, poor/none); rIX-FP consumed per month while 
maintaining assigned prophylaxis; AsBR among Arm 1 subjects who switched treatment regimens; 
investigator’s (or surgeon’s) overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for surgical prophylaxis, 
based on a four point ordinal scale (excellent, good, moderate, poor/none). 
Additional Endpoints: 
Additional efficacy endpoints were: time from last dose to onset of spontaneous bleeding episodes; 
annualized bleeding rates; monthly consumption of rIX-FP for routine prophylaxis treatment compared 
with previous FIX treatment. 
Additional endpoints collected during the surgical substudy were: occurrence of related AEs to rIX-FP 
during the intraoperative and postoperative periods; occurrence of FIX inhibitors; occurrence of 
antibodies against rIX-FP; comparison of predicted and intraoperative estimated blood loss; 
comparison of predicted and actual transfusion requirements; change in hemoglobin levels between 
baseline, intraoperatively and postoperatively. 
If a second infusion of rIX-FP was required for the treatment of a bleeding episode (eg, as a 
maintenance dose to maintain the FIX activity level for multiple days, as recommended by WFH), the 
FIX activity level was tested before administration of the second rIX-FP infusion (if feasible). 
Sample size 
It was planned to include 35 subjects into the prophylaxis treatment arm (arm 1) and 25 subjects into 
the on demand treatment arm (arm 2). The number of subjects in arm 1 was not based on statistical 
considerations.  Regarding the number of subjects for arm 2 a mean spontaneous bleeding rate for on 
demand treatment of 24 bleeds per year was assumed compared to a mean spontaneous bleeding rate 
of 12 bleeds per year following the switch to prophylaxis treatment. Anticipating a standard deviation 
of 14 it was calculated that with 21 subjects a one sample t-test with alpha = 0.05 (2-sided) would 
archive 95% power to detect such effect. To account for potential dropouts, approximately 25 subjects 
were to be enrolled in arm 2.

Recruitment 
Subjects were enrolled from 32 sites in 10 countries. 69 subjects provided informed consent and were 
screened for study participation. Of these, 63 subjects were enrolled and treated with rIX-FP (40 
subjects in the prophylaxis treatment group [Arm 1] and 23 subjects in the on-demand treatment 
group [Arm 2]). Four subjects, 3 in the prophylaxis treatment group and 1 in the on-demand 
treatment group, also participated in the surgical substudy. Overall, 55/63 (87.3%) subjects 
completed the study (37/40 [92.5%] in the prophylaxis treatment group and 18/23 [78.3%] in the on-
demand treatment group). Subject disposition is illustrated below in Figure 6. 
Conduct of the study 
The original Clinical Study Protocol (dated 14 June 2011) and Amendment 1 (dated 30 November 
2011) were issued before the enrollment of the first subject on 23 February 2012. There were 2 
additional protocol amendments issued during the course of the study (Amendment 2, dated 18 
October 2012, and Amendment 3, dated 27 February 2014). 
Summarized key changes in Amendments 1, 2, and 3 is provided below: 
Amendment 1, 30 November 2011 
Change of the secondary endpoint “number of subjects with FIX inhibitors” to the primary safety 
endpoint; addition of an efficacy evaluation algorithm for the Investigator rating of bleeding episodes 
for clarification; update of treatment groups and assigned doses; addition of criteria for dose 
adjustment and treatment regimen switching; as well as an algorithm for the new dose interval; 
update of the statistical methodology section. 
Amendment 2, 18 October 2012 
Addition for on-demand treatment (Arm 2) that a subject’s prophylaxis dose could only be adjusted 
during the first 4 weeks, and that the dose prescribed after 4 weeks of prophylaxis treatment was to 
be maintained for the rest of the study; update of the statistical methodology section with analysis 
population definitions, additional secondary and exploratory endpoints, and additional details on 
statistical methods; addition of the comparison of mean ABRs between different prophylaxis regimens 
as one of the secondary endpoints. 
Amendment 3, 27 February 2014 
The bleeding episodes that occurred during the 4-week run-in period of prophylaxis therapy for 
subjects in Arm 2 (on-demand) were no longer to be excluded from analyses of the 26-week treatment 
period, and the total duration of treatment for Arm 2 was reduced from 30 weeks to 26 weeks, but a 
minimum of 12 weeks; addition of additional statistical methods to clarify how missing data were 
handled during the primary efficacy analysis; clarification that the test proposed for the comparison 
between the 7-day and the 10-day or 14-day prophylaxis regimens was referred to as a non-inferiority 
test. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Only male subjects were enrolled in this study. The majority of subjects were white (52/63 subjects, 
82.5%) or Asian (10/63 subjects, 15.9%) and non-Hispanic (62/63 subjects, 98.4%). 
For the overall study population, subjects had a mean age of 33.0 years (range, 12 to 61 years). 
Seven subjects were 12 to <18 years of age, all of which were enrolled in the prophylaxis treatment

arm. This contributed to a lower mean age in the prophylaxis treatment arm compared to the on-
demand treatment arm (31.6 vs 35.3 years). 
Mean BMI was similar between the arms, at 23.0 and 25.7 kg/m2 for prophylaxis and on- demand, 
respectively. More subjects in the on-demand treatment arm had BMI ≥30 (n=6) than in the 
prophylaxis treatment arm (n=1). 
Numbers analysed 
Protocol deviations: 
There were no protocol deviations relating to inclusion/exclusion criteria reported during the study. 23 
major protocol deviations were reported in 17/63 (27.0%) subjects. In the prophylaxis treatment 
group, 16 major protocol deviations were reported for 10/40 [25.0%] subjects and 7 major protocol 
deviations were reported in 7/23 [30.4%] subjects in the on-demand treatment group. Subjects were 
not excluded from the efficacy analysis population. 
Minor protocol deviations were reported for the majority of subjects. The most common minor protocol 
deviations pertained to visit schedule (eg, visit not performed or out of window), laboratory tests (eg, 
laboratory parameter not performed or out of window), subject assessment (eg, pain relief assessment 
not performed), and rIX-FP administration (eg, noncompliance or dosing deviation). 
Seven subjects had minor protocol deviations relating to the use of prohibited concomitant medication. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Response to prophylaxis treatment 
Annualized spontaneous bleeding rate in Arm 2 (primary efficacy endpoint) covered the Primary 
Efficacy analysis set (n=19) of subjects in the on-demand treatment arm (Arm 2) who received on-
demand treatment during the first half of the study followed by prophylaxis treatment. The AsBR was 
significantly reduced when subjects switched from on-demand to weekly prophylaxis treatment with 
rIX-FP (P <0.0001). The median (Q1, Q3) AsBR was 15.43 (7.98, 17.96) for on-demand treatment and 
0.00 (0.00, 0.96) for weekly prophylaxis treatment.

Table 24 Annualized Bleeding Rates by Bleeding Category (Efficacy Population) 
rIX-FP consumption (secondary efficacy endpoint) 
Subjects on routine prophylaxis with rIX-FP had lower monthly consumption compared with previous 
FIX product (mean [SD] total monthly dose per subject was 202.7 [47.92], 201.5 [42.56], and 157.4 
[16.34] IU/kg for the 7-, 10-, and 14-day regimens, respectively, vs 320.7 [208.75] IU/kg for previous 
FIX).

Table 26 Monthly consumption of rIX-FP during routine prophylaxis (efficacy 
population) 
Subjects were required to achieve a stable dose of 40 IU/kg or less to transition from a 7- to 14-day 
regimen. The total monthly consumption (IU/kg) of rIX-FP during routine prophylaxis was similar 
across the 7-day and 10-day treatment regimens in Arm 1 (mean [SD] total monthly dose per subject 
202.7 [47.92] and 201.5 [42.56] IU/kg, respectively) and the prophylaxis regimen in Arm 2 (191. 7 
[36.33] IU/kg), and was slightly lower in the 14- day treatment regimen in Arm 1 (157.4 [16.34] 
IU/kg). Weekly consumption was higher in the Middle East (Israel) than in Europe or Asia (249.9 
IU/kg/month vs 184.6 and 186.1 IU/kg/month, respectively). 
Control of bleeding episodes 
Number of infusions of rIX-FP to achieve hemostasis (secondary efficacy endpoint) 
358 bleeding episodes required treatment. Of these, 353 bleeding episodes (98.6%) [95% CI 96.2% to 
99.5%] were treated successfully with 1 or 2 infusions.  
The results were similar in the prophylaxis and on-demand treatment groups. Overall, 93.6% of 
bleeding episodes were successfully treated with 1 infusion with similar rates observed across all 
treatment regimens. Overall, the mean (SD) first dose of rIX-FP used to treat bleeding episodes was 
47.717 (13.3855) IU/kg. 
The results of the PP analysis support the conclusions obtained in the Efficacy population 
Excluding bleeds experienced during the surgical substudy, 4 subjects (all on on-demand treatment) 
had 5 bleeding episodes that required >2 infusions to achieve hemostasis. Of these 5 bleeding

episodes, 3 were not treated per protocol within 4 hours of the start of the bleed (and 2 were added; 
therefore these bleeds were excluded from the PP population. 
Investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for the treatment of bleeding episodes 
(secondary efficacy endpoint) 
The Investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy of rIX-FP reported that treatment was effective 
for most bleeding episodes (94.1%) ie, was rated excellent in 297/358 (83.0%) or good in 40/358 
(11.2%) bleeding episodes. Haemostatic efficacy of rIX-FP was assessed as moderate for 9/358 
(2.5%) bleeding episodes, the majority of which were joint bleeds (7/9) and were treated with 1 
infusion (5/9). One bleeding episode (1/358 [0.3%]) was assessed as poor/no response for technical 
reasons. 
There were no major (life-threatening) bleeding episodes in this study. However, there were 5 
iliopsoas bleeding episodes occurring in 4 subjects. Four of the 5 bleeds required only 1 dose of rIX-FP 
to achieve hemostasis. 
The results of the PP analysis support the conclusions obtained in the Efficacy population. 
Table 27 Investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for the 
treatment of bleeding episodes (efficacy population) 
Surgical sub-study 
4 subjects reported 6 surgeries during the study, 2 of which were related to hemophilia. At the time of 
surgery, the FIX activity was above 60% for all subjects, as required by WFH guidelines (World 
Federation of Hemophilia, 2012). Individual plasma FIX activity measurements, along with sampling 
times have been presented, in addition. Haemostatic efficacy for surgical prophylaxis was rated as 
excellent or good for all surgeries at wound closure, 72 hours post-surgery, and at the end of the 
surgery sub-study (Day 14). 
The estimated actual intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements were within the range 
predicted by the Investigator/ Surgeon prior to surgery. No additional haemostatic interventions or 
transfusion support were required for any subject. Acceptable FIX levels were achieved before, during, 
and after surgery. 
Hemoglobin levels were maintained throughout the surgical period and at levels not unexpected for the 
type of surgeries performed. Levels below the lower limit of normal were few and returned to within

normal limits within 24 hours. One subject had a clinically significant low hemoglobin value (112 g/L) 
24 hours after surgery, which was recorded as an AE of anemia. 
All surgical subjects received 1 dose of rIX-FP prior to surgery; no doses were administered 
intraoperatively. During the 14-day postoperative period, subjects received a range of 2 to 7 infusions 
of rIX-FP, depending on the type of surgery. Overall, a total of 25 doses of rIX-FP were administered 
for the 6 surgeries throughout the 14-day surgical sub-study. Mean total consumption of rIX-FP during 
the surgical period was 239.9 IU/kg (range 106 - 380 IU/kg).

CSL654_3001 
Design 
Hypothesis 
Treatments groups 
This was a prospective, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy, PK, and 
safety of rIX-FP, which is being developed for the prophylaxis and treatment 
(control and prevention) of bleeding episodes in patients with congenital FIX 
deficiency (hemophilia B). 
The main study design consisted of a screening period, a PK period, and an 
active treatment period for all subjects. Any subjects requiring 
nonemergency surgery during the course of the study could be enrolled in 
the surgical substudy..  
To evaluate both the treatment (control and prevention) of bleeding episodes 
and the prophylaxis treatment regimen, subjects who were receiving on- 
demand treatment with FIX and subjects who were receiving prophylaxis 
therapy with FIX were both enrolled into the study. All subjects received rIX-
FP and were assigned to treatment groups (prophylaxis [Arm 1] or on- 
demand [Arm 2]) based on their history of use with FIX products. Subjects in 
the prophylaxis treatment arm were further stratified into 1 of 3 treatment 
blocks: Block A (prophylaxis subjects who completed Study CSL654_2004), 
Block B (first 15 non-CSL654_2004 subjects), or Block C (remaining subjects 
who enrolled in the study). 
Subjects in Arm 2 received on-demand treatment for 26 weeks and then the 
number of bleeding episodes was recorded in order to calculate the ABR. 
Subjects then switched to a 7 day prophylaxis regimen for approximately 26 
weeks (minimum of 12 weeks), and the ABR on prophylaxis was compared to 
on-demand treatment. This design allowed subjects to serve as their own 
control in measuring the difference in the ABR between the on-demand and 
prophylaxis treatments. 
Duration of main phase: 
approx. 29 months 
Duration of Run-in phase: 
not applicable 
Duration of Extension phase:  not applicable 
Continuous data were summarized using descriptive statistics including 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. 
Primary  efficacy  analysis:  The  AsBR  with  on-demand  treatment,  with 
prophylaxis  treatment,  and  the  percent  reduction  in  AsBR  with  prophylaxis 
treatment  were  summarized  using  descriptive  statistics.  The  AsBR  was 
analyzed  using  the  Wilcoxon  signed-rank  test.  A  test  of  null  hypothesis  that 
the ratio of AsBR (prophylaxis/on-demand) was ≥0.50 was conducted at the 
1-sided 0.025 level. The ratio was based on the original scale. 
Comparison of annualized spontaneous bleeding rate between the 7-day and 
>7-day  prophylaxis  regimens:  To  show  that  the  extended  prophylaxis 
regimen  was  non-inferior  to  the  7-day  prophylaxis  regimen,  50%  of  the  7-
day  treatment  effect  was  to  be  maintained.  The  null  and  alternative 
hypotheses were as follows:  
H0: μ7-day – μextended ≤ -6  
H1: μ7-day – μ extended > -6 
The  lower  confidence  limit  of  the  95%  CI,  based  on  a  1-sample  (paired)  t-
test for the difference between the 2 means, must be greater than -6.

Study 3002: Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Efficacy Study in Previously Treated Children 
with Hemophilia B 
This was a prospective, open-label study in subjects < 12 years of age to evaluate the efficacy, PK, 
and safety of rIX-FP, which is being developed for the prophylaxis and treatment (control and 
prevention) of bleeding episodes in patients with congenital FIX deficiency (hemophilia B). 
The main study design consisted of a screening period, a PK period, and an active treatment period of 
weekly prophylaxis therapy with rIX-FP for all subjects. If a subject required a minor, nonemergency 
surgical procedure during the study, the subject could be treated with rIX-FP for surgical prophylaxis. 
Subjects were to be withdrawn from the study if a major or emergency surgical procedure was 
required. 
Efficacy and safety assessments were performed at the study center on a monthly basis.

Figure 5: Study Design of Study 3002 
Methods 
Study participants  
29 subjects provided informed consent and were screened for study participation. Of these, 27 
subjects were enrolled and treated with rIX-FP (12 subjects < 6 years of age and 15 subjects 6 to < 12 
years of age). 
Male subjects, < 12 years of age and with body weight ≥ 10 kg, with documented severe hemophilia B 
(FIX activity of ≤ 2%), who had no prior history of FIX inhibitor formation and who were currently 
receiving FIX replacement therapy and had FIX products ≥ 150 exposure days (EDs) (6 to < 12 years 
of age) or ≥ 50 EDs (< 6 years of age) were eligible for inclusion in the study. 
Treatments 
The main study design consisted of a screening period, a PK period, and an active treatment period of 
weekly prophylaxis therapy with rIX-FP for all subjects. If a subject required a minor, nonemergency 
surgical procedure during the study, the subject could be treated with rIX-FP for surgical prophylaxis. 
Subjects were to be withdrawn from the study if a major or emergency surgical procedure was 
required. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses covered PK of 50 IU/kg of rIX-FP at the beginning of the study in all subjects 
and PK of 50 IU/kg of the previous FIX product at limited time points at the beginning of the study in a 
subset of subjects who had no historical PK data of their previous FIX product. 
The recommended doses for prophylaxis treatment were selected based on group PK data and 
treatment experience from Phase 1and Phase 1/2 (studies 2001 and 2004) studies. The desired FIX 
activity level for the treatment of a bleeding episode was based on the recommendation of the World 
Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), with a minimum dose of 35 IU/kg. The appropriate dose and dosing 
regimen of rIX-FP for both prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes were prescribed 
by the Investigator. 
Prophylaxis dosing for all subjects: 
Subjects were initially treated with a weekly prophylaxis dose of 35 to 50 IU/kg rIX-FP, which could be 
adjusted up to a maximum dose of 75 IU/kg, based on the subject’s PK data from this study as well as 
the PK data from the previous rIX-FP study 2001, the subject’s previous prophylaxis dose with another 
FIX product, the treatment dose/efficacy data from previous rIX-FP studies 2004 and 3001, the 
subject’s bleeding phenotype, and the subject’s physical activity level. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 75/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If a subject experienced at least 1 spontaneous breakthrough hemorrhage due to an inadequate 
treatment dose, the dose of rIX-FP could be increased by an increment of 5 to 15 IU/kg, up to a 
maximum dose of 75 IU/kg of rIX-FP with a target of maintaining the trough FIX activity level above 
3% to 5% between doses, while maintaining a treatment interval of 7 days. The prophylaxis treatment 
dose could also be adjusted to a lower weekly dose due to an unnecessarily high trough FIX activity 
level. 
On-demand dosing for all subjects: 
For the on-demand treatment of a bleeding episode, the subject’s PK data from this study, the 
subject’s previous treatment dose with another FIX product, the treatment dose / efficacy data from 
previous rIX-FP studies 2004 and 3001, and the type, location, and severity of the bleeding episode 
were utilized for calculating / selecting the treatment doses, with an initial dose of 35 to 50 IU/kg, that 
could be adjusted up to a maximum of 75 IU/kg. 
The study center was to be contacted if hemostasis was not achieved after the first rIX-FP 
administration. If a bleeding episode required a maintenance dose of rIX-FP (to maintain the FIX 
activity level after achieving hemostasis for multiple days as recommended by WFH), the FIX activity 
level was to be tested prior to the second rIX-FP administration, if feasible, and administered at least 
24 hours after the first treatment dose. After hemostasis was achieved, a lower maintenance dose(s) 
of rIX-FP could be prescribed at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Subjects were to maintain the prophylaxis treatment schedule, if possible, while receiving on-demand 
treatment for a bleeding episode. 
Surgical dosing: 
If a subject required a minor, nonemergency surgical procedure during the study, the subject could 
receive rIX-FP for surgical prophylaxis as recommended by the WFH for surgery. 
During the preoperative treatment period (approximately 1 to 3 hours prior to the start of the 
scheduled surgery), the subject received a single bolus dose of rIX-FP in order to increase the FIX 
activity levels to 60% to 80%. During the intraoperative treatment period, additional bolus doses of 
rIX-FP could be administered, if needed, based on the individual subject’s possible variation in recovery 
and/or clearance, or FIX activity levels. Blood samples for the determination of FIX activity levels were 
collected prior to and 30 minutes following administration of additional doses of rIX-FP. During the 
postoperative period, defined as starting at wound closure, additional dosing of rIX-FP could be 
prescribed at the Investigator’s discretion at 3- to 7-day treatment intervals to maintain a required 
trough FIX activity level as recommended by the WFH. 
Duration of treatment: 
The main study design consisted of a < 1-month screening period and up to a 14-day PK period, 
followed by an active treatment period of about 11 months. Thus, the duration of the study for an 
individual subject was expected to be approximately 12 months. A subject could continue in the study 
if a Phase 3 extension study was not yet enrolling at the time of the subject’s planned End-of-study 
visit. 
Objectives 
Primary Objectives were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of rIX-FP and to 
evaluate the safety of rIX-FP with respect to the development of inhibitors to factor IX (FIX) in patients 
with severe hemophilia B (FIX activity of ≤ 2%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 76/117 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary Objectives were to evaluate the safety of rIX-FP, based on adverse events (AEs) and the 
development of antibodies to rIX-FP; to evaluate the clinical response to rIX-FP for the prevention of 
bleeding episodes; to evaluate the clinical response to rIX-FP in the treatment of bleeding episodes. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: 
Primary endpoints were PK- and safety-endpoints.  
Secondary Endpoints: 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included the consumption of rIX-FP (expressed as number of infusions 
and IU/kg per month and per year, as well as IU/kg per event), and the proportion of bleeding 
episodes that required 1, 2, or > 2 infusions of rIX-FP to achieve hemostasis. 
Other Endpoints: 
Other endpoints included the Investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for 
treatment of bleeding episodes based on a 4 point ordinal scale, the Investigator’s overall clinical 
assessment of haemostatic efficacy for surgical prophylaxis based on a 4 point ordinal scale (if 
applicable), annualized bleeding rate (ABR) during the routine prophylaxis treatment period, and 
quality of life assessed by subjects and their parents/caregivers. 
Sample size 
In line with the requirements for the clinical investigation of FIX products in children < 12 years of age 
(EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144552/2009) enrolment of up to 24 subjects was planned.

Results  
Participant flow  
All Subjects received weekly (7-day) routine prophylaxis treatment with an initial weekly dose of 35 to 
50 IU/kg rIX-FP, which may have been adjusted. On-demand treatment in this study refers specifically 
to treatment of bleeding episodes as needed while subjects were receiving prophylaxis treatment. 
Recruitment 
Of the 18 sites that were activated, subjects were enrolled from 17 sites in 10 countries. Of the 29 
subjects screened, 27 subjects were enrolled and treated with rIX-FP (12 subjects <6 years of age and 
15 subjects 6 to <12 years of age). Two subjects (both 6 to <12 years of age) participated in the 
surgical substudy. No subject discontinued from the study. 
Conduct of the study 
There was 1 non-substantial amendment to the original protocol (dated 08 November 2013) to clarify 
the visit schedule and correct typographical errors in the Schedule of Assessments tables. There were 
no changes in the conduct of the study and/or the planned statistical analysis.

Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
All subjects were male and <12 years of age. The majority of subjects were White (26/27 subjects, 
96.3%) and non-Hispanic (25/27 subjects, 92.6%). Subjects had an overall mean (SD) age of 5.9 
(2.93) years. 12 Subjects were < 6 years of age and 15 subjects were 6 to < 12 years of age. 
Subjects < 6 years of age had a mean (SD) age of 3.2 (1.70) years (range, 1 to 5 years) and a mean 
(SD) BMI of 15.61 (1.727) kg/m2 (range, 13.6 to 19.1 kg/m2). Subjects 6 to < 12 years of age had a 
mean (SD) age of 8.1 (1.41) years (range, 6 to 10 years) and a mean (SD) BMI of 17.64 (3.766) 
kg/m2 (range, 12.7 to 26.9 kg/m2). 
All subjects had been diagnosed with hemophilia B and had a FIX activity level ≤2%. 
Previous treatment 
In the 12 months prior to study entry, subjects experienced a mean (SD) of 7.0 (11.89) total, 3.0 
(4.44) trauma-induced, and 3.9 (9.18) spontaneous bleeding episodes with similar proportions in the 2 
age groups. The number of unknown bleeding episodes (mean [SD]) was low (0.3 [0.59] overall). 
Target joints (defined as 3 or more spontaneous bleeds into a single joint within a consecutive 6-
months period) were reported in 3 subjects (2 subjects <6 years of age and 1 subject 6 to <12 years 
of age group) prior to study entry. 
As a requirement for study enrollment, all subjects had received previous FIX products (pdFIX or rFIX) 
for ≥150 EDs (6 to <12 years of age) or ≥50 EDs (<6 years of age). Overall, the majority of subjects 
received previous FIX as routine prophylaxis treatment prior to study entry (24/27 subjects, 88.9%), 
while 3/27 (11.1%) subjects received previous FIX only for on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes. 
All 3 subjects who received previous FIX as on-demand treatment prior to study entry (1 subject <6 
years of age and 2 subjects 6 to <12 years of age) were from the same site). 
The mean weekly consumption for routine prophylaxis prior to study entry was 107 IU/kg; for subjects 
<6 years of age, the mean weekly consumption prior to study entry was 139 IU/kg, and for subjects 6 
to <12 years of age, it was 80 IU/kg. The majority of subjects (20/24) received routine prophylaxis 
treatment more frequently than once weekly.

Protocol deviations: 
There was no protocol deviations relating to inclusion/exclusion criteria reported during the study. 
3 Major protocol deviations were reported in 3 of 27 (11.1%) subjects; 1 in subjects <6 years of age 
(signed information sheet not submitted to the IEC; this protocol deviation did not influence the 
efficacy assessment; therefore, this subject was included in the analyses of the PP population) and 2 in 
subjects 6 to <12 years age of age: the screening laboratory samples were collected prior to signing of 
the ICF but the subject was included in the analyses of the PP population and in a subject who 
underwent a major surgery for a fractured arm,  treatment during the surgery period was excluded 
from analyses of the Efficacy and PP populations. 
All remaining protocol deviations were minor. The most common minor protocol deviations pertained to 
procedures, IMP administration, visit schedule, and Laboratory tests. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Response to prophylaxis treatment 
The ABR during routine prophylaxis treatment was calculated per subject and summarized for total, 
spontaneous (AsBR), and joint bleeds overall and by age category. 
23 Subjects had bleeding episodes that required treatment in the Efficacy population (11 subjects <6 
years of age and 12 subjects 6 to <12 years of age). 
In the Efficacy population, the overall median ABR for total bleeding episodes during prophylaxis 
treatment was 3.12. The ABRs in the 2 age groups were comparable, with differences in median ABRs 
between the 2 age groups of <1 bleeding episode per year (median in subjects <6 years of age vs 
subjects 6 to <12 years of age: 2.64 vs 3.39). More than half of the subjects (51.9%) in the Efficacy 
population reported no spontaneous bleeding episodes during the study  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 79/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the 3 subjects who received previous FIX as on-demand treatment prior to study entry the AsBRs 
in the study were 0.00, 2.36, and 3.55,  These AsBRs of all 3 subjects were markedly reduced in the 
study when compared with the number of spontaneous bleeding episodes these subjects reported in 
the last 12 months prior to study entry (15 spontaneous bleeds for one Subject, 34 for a second 
Subject, and 31 for a third Subject). Similar differences were also seen for the ABRs of these subjects 
in the study vs the total number of bleeding episodes these subjects reported in the last 12 months 
prior to study entry ( 1.18 vs 19,: 4.73 vs 42, and 5.91 vs 39). The median ABR at the joints was 0.99 
overall in the Efficacy population and was comparable between the 2 age groups (differences in median 
ABRs between the 2 age groups <1 bleeding episode per year). 
Table 32 Annualized Bleeding Rates by Bleeding Category (Efficacy Population) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 80/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Target joints were reported in 3 subjects prior to study entry. Two of the subjects had no bleeds at the 
location of their previous target joint, whereas 1 subject had 2 bleeds (only 1 treated) at his previous 
target joint location Because there were fewer than 3 bleeds in 6 months at previously identified target 
joints, all target joints were considered resolved during the study. 
The overall median ABR and AsBR in the study were similar to the median (Q1, Q3) number of 
bleeding episodes (3.0 [1.0, 6.0]) and spontaneous bleeding episodes (0.0 [0.0, 2.0]), respectively, 
reported in the last 12 months prior to study entry. 
Time between the most recent prophylaxis infusion and spontaneous bleeding episode 
In the Efficacy population, the overall median (Q1, Q3) time between the most recent prophylaxis 
infusion and a spontaneous bleeding episode was 132.2 (100.0, 148.6) hours. The time between the 
most recent prophylaxis infusion and a spontaneous bleeding episode was >72 hours for all episodes. 
Of the 16 bleeding episodes assessed, the time between the most recent prophylaxis infusion and a 
spontaneous bleeding episode was more than 6 days (>144 hours) for 7 bleeding episodes (6 bleeding 
episodes >144 to ≤168 hours; 1 bleeding episode >168 hours). The data were similar in the analysis 
of the PP population. 
rIX-FP consumption 
In the Efficacy population, the mean number of prophylaxis infusions per month was 4.31 overall, was 
comparable between the 2 age groups (4.32 in subjects <6 years of age and 4.29 in subjects 6 to <12 
years of age), and was in accordance with the study schedule of weekly prophylaxis therapy with rIX-
FP. 
The mean total prophylaxis dose per month was 205 IU/kg overall, 214 IU/kg in subjects <6 years of 
age, and 198 IU/kg in subjects 6 to <12 years of age. The mean total prophylaxis dose per year was 
2461 IU/kg overall, 2562 IU/kg in in subjects <6 years of age, and 2380 IU/kg in in subjects 6 to <12 
years of age. The mean weekly prophylaxis dose was 47 IU/kg overall, 49 IU/kg in subjects <6 years 
of age, and 46 IU/kg in subjects 6 to <12 years of age. Of note, the mean weekly prophylaxis dose in 
this study (47 IU/kg) was considerably lower than the weekly consumption for routine prophylaxis 
prior to study entry (107 IU/kg). 
The mean total prophylaxis dose per infusion was 47 IU/kg overall and was slightly higher in subjects 
<6 years of age than in subjects 6 to <12 years of age (49 vs 45 IU/kg). Only 1 subject n the subjects 
<6 years of age group) received doses above the recommended maximum treatment dose of 75 IU/kg 
(doses of 76.36 to 77.48 IU/kg). 
The data presented for the PP population were identical to the ones for the Efficacy population for the 
analysis of rIX-FP consumption. 
A summary of dose adjustments has been provided.

Control of bleeding episodes 
Number of infusions of rIX-FP to achieve hemostasis (secondary efficacy endpoint) 
Of the 106 bleeding episodes that required treatment in the Efficacy population, 41 occurred at joints, 
18 at muscles, and 47 at other locations. When analyzed by type of bleeding episodes, 16 episodes 
were spontaneous, 73 traumatic, 1 post-surgical, and 16 of unknown nature in the Efficacy population. 
103 were treated successfully with 1 or 2 infusions. Successful treatment with 1 or 2 infusions was 
reported for all bleeding episodes in subjects < 6 years of age and for 58 of 61 bleeding episodes in 
subjects 6 to < 12 years of age.  
3 Subjects (all 6 to <12 years of age) had 3 bleeding episodes that required >2 infusions to achieve 
haemostasis . These bleeding episodes were minor/moderate, occurred at the joints, and were 
traumatic (2 episodes) or spontaneous (1 episode). 
Investigator’s overall clinical assessment of haemostatic efficacy for the treatment of bleeding episodes 
(secondary efficacy endpoint) 
Treatment was effective for the vast majority of minor/moderate bleeding episodes (75.0% rated 
excellent; 21.2% rated good), and for both of the major bleeding episodes (100%) according to the 
Investigator’s assessment.

Table 34 Investigator’s Overall Clinical Assessment of Haemostatic Efficacy for the 
Treatment of Bleeding Episodes (Efficacy Population) 
Bleeding episodes not requiring treatment 
20 Bleeding episodes in the Efficacy population did not require treatment (17 of these episodes 
occurred in subjects <6 years of age). Six events were spontaneous, 11 traumatic, and 3 of unknown 
type. The location of these episodes were: nasal (11 episodes), multiple, oral, right elbow, right knee, 
(1 episode in each category), and other (5 episodes). 
Surgical substudy 
2 Subjects reported 2 surgeries during the study, neither of which were related to hemophilia 
Haemostatic efficacy for surgical prophylaxis was rated as excellent or good for both surgeries at 
wound closure (0 hours) and/or 7 days following surgery (168 hours). 
No haemostatic interventions or transfusion support were required for any subject, and no estimated 
actual intraoperative blood loss was recorded. There were no surgical evacuations needed and no 
hematomas. No re-bleeding occurred within 72 hours. All surgical subjects received 1 dose of rIX-FP 
prior to surgery; no doses were administered intra-operatively. Consumption during the post-operative 
period was not unexpected for the type of surgery performed. The mean consumption of rIX-FP was 
45.1 IU/kg for the pre-surgical dose.

Design 
This was a prospective, open-label study in subjects <12 years of age to 
evaluate the efficacy, PK, and safety of rIX-FP, which is being developed for 
the prophylaxis and treatment (control and prevention) of bleeding episodes 
in subjects with congenital FIX deficiency (hemophilia B). 
The main study design consisted of a screening period, a PK period, and an 
active treatment period of weekly prophylaxis therapy with rIX-FP for all 
subjects. If a subject required a minor, nonemergency surgical procedure 
during the study, the subject could be treated with rIX-FP for surgical 
prophylaxis.

Study 3003: Safety and Efficacy Extension Study in subjects with Hemophilia B (Abbreviated 
Clinical Study Report) 
This is an ongoing, multicenter, open-label, phase 3b study to investigate the long-term safety and 
efficacy of rIX-FP for the routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes in 
subjects with hemophilia B. The study includes a surgery substudy to investigate the efficacy of rIX-FP 
in the prevention and control of bleeding in subjects with hemophilia B during surgical procedures. As 
of the data cut-off date (09 January 2015), subjects have been enrolled at 39 centers in 15 countries.  
Subjects are allocated to 4 treatment arms as per the following diagram.

Figure 6: Overview of Study Design 3003 
Methods 
Study participants  
Number of subjects planned: Approximately 115 male subjects are planned to be enrolled in Study 
3003. At least 5 subjects and 10 major surgeries are planned across all CSL Behring rIX-FP lead-in 
studies and Study 3003 (ie, combined). 
Number of subjects analyzed: At the time of data cut-off, 83 subjects were screened, 81 subjects were 
enrolled, and 80 subjects were treated with rIX-FP (24 subjects < 12 years of age). Overall, 7 subjects 
had participated in the surgery substudy. 
Male subjects with documented severe hemophilia B (FIX activity of ≤2%), who had no history of FIX 
inhibitor formation. Criteria for Inclusion were completion of a previous rIX-FP study for arms 1 and 2, 
subjects 12 to 70 years of age scheduled to have a major non-emergency surgery for Arm 3 (excluding 
subjects from France), and previously untreated subjects up to 18 years of age for Arm 4. 
If a subject requires non-emergency surgery during the study, the subject may be treated with rIX-FP 
for surgical prophylaxis in the surgery substudy. 
Treatments 
Routine prophylaxis dosing: The dose is based on the subjects’ previous experience and/or the 
targeted FIX activity trough level (target FIX activity level >2%, but optimally between 5% and 15%). 
In Arms 1, 2, and 3, the treatment interval ranges between 7 and 14 days for the first 6 months and 
may generally only be changed at each 6 month follow-up assessment (up to 21 days for subjects ≥18 
years of age who received rIX-FP prophylaxis at 14-day intervals for 6 months and had a PK evaluation 
with 100 International Units [IU]/kg rIX-FP). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 87/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On-demand dosing: On-demand treatment is used for all bleeding episodes requiring treatment. The 
dose (35 to 75 IU/kg) is determined by the Investigator, based on the effective on demand treatment 
dose used in the lead in study and/or the subject’s PK data. 
Preventative dosing: Preventative treatment may be administered before vigorous physical activity or 
physical therapy. The dose (35 to 50 IU/kg) is determined by the Investigator, based on the effective 
on demand treatment dose used in the lead in study and/or the subject’s PK data. 
Surgical dosing was based on recommendations for surgery by the World Federation of Hemophilia. 
During the pre-operative treatment (approximately 3 hours before the start of the surgery), a single 
bolus injection of 50 to 100 IU/kg (or higher) are applied. During surgery, intraoperative doses depend 
on the FIX activity levels, type of surgery, and local standard of care. Postoperative injections of rIX-FP 
are administered for 1 to 14 days (or longer, if needed) depending on FIX activity levels and type of 
surgery. 
Duration of the study for an individual subject is expected to be approximately 3 years or the time it 
takes to achieve a total of 100 exposure days (EDs) during the subject’s enrollment in any CSL 
Behring-sponsored rIX-FP studies (for subjects in Arms 1 or 2). The overall study duration (ie, first 
subject’s first visit to last subject’s End-of-study visit) is expected to be approximately 3 years. 
For the surgery substudy, the active treatment period is 1 to 14 days (or longer, if needed) depending 
on the type of surgery and local standard of care. After completing the surgery substudy, subjects will 
return to the treatment plan of the main study, or start routine prophylaxis with rIX-FP, if enrolled as a 
new subject (Arm 3). 
Table 37 Dose Guidelines for routine prophylaxis 
Objectives 
Primary Objectives were to evaluate the safety of rIX-FP as measured by new cases of inhibitors 
against coagulation factor IX (FIX) in subjects, including previously untreated subjects, with severe 
hemophilia B and for the Surgery substudy to evaluate the efficacy of rIX-FP in the prevention and 
control of bleeding in subjects with severe hemophilia B during surgical procedures. 
Secondary objectives were to further evaluate the safety of rIX-FP and for the Surgery substudy to 
evaluate the safety of rIX-FP during the intraoperative and postoperative periods. 
Only safety data from the main study and data from the surgery substudy (data cut-off date: 09 
January 2015) are reported in the abbreviated CSR and summarized in the dossier. Secondary and

exploratory objectives related to efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and quality of life will be evaluated at 
the end of the study, and will be reported in the final CSR. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint of the surgery sub-study was the Investigator’s overall clinical assessment of 
haemostatic efficacy for surgical prophylaxis, based on a four point ordinal scale (excellent, good, 
moderate, poor / none). 
Sample size 
The choice of sample size for this study is not based on statistical power considerations. Approximately 
115 subjects are to be enrolled in this study, including all eligible subjects from rIX-FP lead-in studies, 
approximately 10 subjects requiring major non-emergency surgery who had not previously received 
treatment with rIX-FP, and approximately 20 PUPs. The target is at least 50 subjects completing 100 
EDs during enrollment in all CSLB-sponsored rIX-FP studies.

Recruitment 
The study is planned to be conducted at approximately 40 study centers worldwide. The duration of 
the study for an individual subject is expected to be approximately 3 years or the time it takes to 
achieve a total of 100 exposure days (EDs) during the subject’s enrollment in any CSLB-sponsored rIX-
FP studies (for subjects in Arms 1 or 2). The overall study duration (ie, first subject’s first visit to last 
subject’s End-of-study visit) is expected to be approximately 3 years. The target is at least 50 subjects 
completing 100 EDs during enrollment in all CSLB-sponsored rIX-FP studies, 
All 80 subjects were male. The majority of subjects were White (67 subjects, 83.8%) and non Hispanic 
(77 subjects, 96.3%). For the overall study population, subjects had a mean age of 27.5 years 
(minimum [min], maximum [max]: 2, 63); 24 subjects were <12 years of age. 
A total of 7 subjects underwent 7 surgeries during the surgery substudy at the time of the data cut-off 
on 09 January 2015 (excision of pigmental nevus, 1 subject; rhinoplasty and submucosal resection 
with inferior turbenectomy, 1 subject; endoscopic mucosal resection, 1 subject; root canal, 1 subject; 
right ankle arthroplasty, 1 subject; total knee replacement, 2 subjects). 
Conduct of the study 
There were 3 amendments to the original protocol (dated 14 May 2013): 
Amendment 1 of 17 September 2013 covers the addition of Arm 3 to the study design comprising 
subjects who had not previously completed a CSLB-sponsored rIX-FP lead-in study and who were 
scheduled to have a major non-emergency surgery within 8 weeks from the start of the initial rIX-FP

(100 IU/kg) PK evaluation period, Change of the sample size from 85 to 95 and clarification that the 
exploratory objective relating to QoL is limited to subjects from the lead-in Study 3002. 
Amendment 2 of 17 February 2014 (applicable only to study centers in France) was based on requests 
from the French regulatory agency and included restriction to exclude additional new surgical subjects 
in France from enrolling in Arm 3, exclusion of French subjects enrolled from the lead-in studies from 
the 21-day prophylaxis regimen and clarification of treatment of a subject if an inhibitor to FIX was 
confirmed. 
Amendment 3 of 03 June 2014 reflects the addition of Arm 4 covering PUPs, change of the sample size 
from 95 to 115, to allow for inclusion of at least 20 PUPs and introduction of an IDMC to provide an 
independent evaluation of Arm 4 of the study. 
Baseline data 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
Subjects were enrolled from 39 centers in 15 countries.  Study enrollment was ongoing at the time of 
data cutoff (09 January 2015) for this abbreviated CSR. 83 Subjects were screened for study 
participation. Of these, 81 subjects were enrolled, and 80 subjects were treated with rIX-FP. 
Overall, 7 subjects had participated in the surgery substudy at the time of data cutoff, 3 in arm 1, 1 in 
arm2, and 3 in arm3. 
Only male subjects were enrolled in this study. The majority of subjects were White (67 subjects, 
83.8%) and non-Hispanic (77 subjects, 96.3%). Subjects had an overall mean age of 27.5 years (min, 
max: 2, 63). As only subjects ≥12 years of age could be enrolled in Arms 2 and 3 of the study 
according to the inclusion criteria, the mean age, height, and body weight in Arms 2 and 3 were higher 
than in Arm 1, which included 24 pediatric subjects <12 years of age. 
Further details will be presented in the final study report. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Surgery substudy 
At the time of data cutoff (09 January 2015), 7 surgeries had been performed in 7 subjects. 
Haemostatic efficacy for surgical prophylaxis was rated as excellent or good at wound closure (0 hours) 
and at 72 hours or discharge for all surgeries for which assessments were available. The overall 
hemostasis response was rated as excellent for the 2 surgeries for which an assessment was available. 
The desired FIX levels were achieved before, during, and after surgery with a total of 3 to 7 rIX-FP 
injections during the 14-day surgical period, including a single preoperative dose. A mean dose of 79.0 
IU/kg was given preoperatively; hemostasis from the preoperative dose was maintained until the end 
of surgery for all surgeries. Consumption during the postoperative period (2 to 6 rIX-FP injections) was 
lower than expected based on using currently marketed FIX replacement products to achieve the 
recommended FIX activity level. The mean postoperative consumption of rIX-FP was 53.3 IU/kg during 
the first 72 hours after surgery and 191.4 IU/kg during the first 14 days after surgery. 
Estimated actual intraoperative blood loss was below or equal to the maximum predicted blood loss for 
a non-hemophilic individual undergoing the same type and extent of surgical procedure. One subject 
received packed red blood cells after a total knee replacement, as planned prior to surgery; however, 
the amount was less than predicted. Assessments of hemoglobin levels relative to surgery are 
available for 4 subjects.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The comparison and analysis of results are organized according to the indication being sought. Because 
both studies 2004 and 3001 collected PK and efficacy data relevant to the on-demand treatment of a 
bleeding episode, these data have been pooled. Pooled data are reported along with presentations of 
the separate study data as they are relevant to each indication. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics of the populations in studies 2004, 3001, 3002, and 3003 
have been presented. Subjects who participated in both studies 2004 and 3001 were counted only 
once in the pooled efficacy assessment, using their baseline data from Study 2004. 
Comparison of Efficacy Results for All Studies 
Data supporting efficacy of rIX-FP are presented according to the treatment regimen. Primary support 
for the use of rIX-FP as routine prophylaxis derives from a prospective analysis of the difference in 
AsBR for on-demand vs prophylaxis treatment regimens in Study 3001. Study 3001 also included an 
analysis of ABR for 3 different routine prophylaxis regimens (7-, 10-, and 14-day). Efficacy data from 
Study 3002 support the use of rIX-FP as routine prophylaxis for the treatment and prevention of 
bleeding episodes in pediatric patients. 
Data supporting use of rIX-FP for perioperative hemostasis derive from studies 3001, 3002, and 3003.

Response to prophylaxis treatment 
Subjects ≥ 12 to 65 Years (Adults and Adolescents) 
Study 3001 was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of rIX-FP when used as routine prophylaxis. The 
analysis population included subjects who received on-demand treatment during the first half of the 
study followed by prophylaxis treatment (Arm 2), thus allowing for a within-subject comparison of 
spontaneous bleeding rates between on-demand and prophylaxis treatment. 
Table 39 Studies 2004 and 3001: Efficacy Assessments Relevant to Prophylaxis 
Treatment with rIX-FP (Efficacy Population) 
The design of Study 3001 allowed for the extension of the prophylaxis treatment interval to 10 or 14 
days in Arm 1 subjects who met the switching criteria of the protocol (ie, subjects were on a stable 
dose of ≤ 40 IU/kg and had no spontaneous bleeds in the previous month). After approximately 26 
weeks on a 7-day regimen, 26/40 subjects switched to a longer regimen. The ABR results for those 
subjects are shown in Table 41 along with data from subjects participating in both Arms 1 and 2 on a 
7-day prophylaxis regimen.

Global Region (Efficacy Population) 
All subjects who switched to the 14-day prophylaxis regimen fulfilled the switching criteria of 
maintaining a stable dose of at most 40 IU/kg weekly. 
Control and prevention of bleeding episodes. 
In both studies 2004 and 3001, 93.0% of bleeding episodes were successfully treated with a single 
injection. In Study 3001, subjects in the Arm 2 on-demand regimen exhibited a success rate of 98.6% 
(95% CI: 94.3% to 99.7%) and those in the Arm 2 prophylaxis regimen exhibited a rate of 94.6% 
(95% CI: 76.9% to 98.9%) Across both studies, the probability of successfully treating a bleeding 
episode with 2 injections or fewer was 98.9% (95% CI: 96.9% to 99.6%).

Across studies 2004 and 3001, Investigators assessed the efficacy of rIX-FP for the majority of 
bleeding episodes as excellent or good. 
All bleeding episodes in both studies were classified as minor or moderate; none were classified as 
major (life-threatening) During Study 3001, there were 5 bleeds reported in 4 subjects. While not 
classified as major by the subject (all 5 bleeds were reported as minor bleeds), 4 / 5 bleeds required 
only 1 dose of rIX-FP to achieve hemostasis. 
Table 42 Studies 2004 and 3001: Efficacy Assessments Relevant to Control and 
Prevention of Bleeding Episodes with rIX-FP (EfficacyPopulations)  
In the paediatric Study 3002, 23/27 subjects experienced 106 bleeding episodes that were treated 
with rIX-FP; the majority of bleeding episodes (103/106; 97.2%) were successfully treated with 1 or 2 
injections of rIX-FP. Investigators assessed the haemostatic efficacy of rIX-FP as excellent or good for 
the majority of bleeding episodes in Study 3002, regardless of bleeding severity. For the 2 major 
bleeding episodes reported in the study (both of which were traumatic and occurred at the hip), 
haemostatic efficacy of rIX-FP was assessed as good. In addition, 2 iliopsoas bleeds were reported in 2 
subjects; each required 1 dose of rIX-FP to achieve hemostasis, only.

Perioperative management of bleeding: There were 15 surgeries in the rIX-FP clinical development 
program, including 12 surgeries in adolescents and adults (studies 3001 and 3003) and 3 surgeries in 
children < 12 years of age (studies 3002 and 3003).

Table 44 Perioperative Consumption of rIX-FP 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
An extensive clinical investigation programme has been provided. Concept and patient numbers meet 
the requirements of the Clinical Guideline. Target population of the studies is in accordance with the 
target population of the MAA. Treatment options (on-demand treatment, prophylaxis, perioperative 
prophylaxis) meet the intended indication taking into account the assumed extended half-life. Inclusion 
and exclusion criteria for the efficacy-studies follow currently applied standards. 
Annualized (spontaneous) bleeding rates have been introduced as an efficacy parameter which is 
regarded to be challenging and not reflected in the Clinical Guideline for the following reasons: Such 
rate might serve as a parameter for efficacy of prophylaxis as it is “countable” and represents an easy-
to-understand number. However, lack of definitions for a “bleed”, for “spontaneous” or “traumatic” 
nature of such bleed and individual evaluation factors are considered to be challenging when 
comparing numbers. Furthermore, comparison of ABR while on on-demand versus on prophylaxis-
regimen is considered to be of highly restricted value: On-demand therapy mainly represents severity 
of haemophilia (overall bleeding frequency) and not efficacy of a certain product. Furthermore, 
bleeding episodes might not require treatment (as documented for study 3002) – these are not 
reflected in the ABR.  
 The study design of the efficacy-part of study 2004 is based upon PK-evaluation and two parallel arms 
for on-demand or prophylaxis treatment and meets guideline requirements in terms of treatment 
interval; the requested number of Exposure Days, patient population and objectives / efficacy 
endpoints. Suggested treatments comply with the results of the PK-assessment and are considered to 
reflect the assumed extended half-life of the product. Chosen dosages (prophylaxis: 15-35 IU/kg, on-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 96/117 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
demand: not less than 35 IU/kg) follow the current standard treatment (Core-SmPC: 20-40 IU/kg at 
intervals of 3 to 4 days) and adaptation to higher (75 IU/kg) dosages is considered to be acceptable. 
Demographic data reflect an expected patient population. Number of Exposure days is above 40 
(instead of 50) EDs which is considered to be acceptable in the light of the extended treatment 
interval. BMI as a confounding factor for Recovery is considered to be in a wide-range; treatment of 
overweight patient is part of the Core SmPC. 
The study design of the efficacy-part of study 3001 is based upon PK-evaluation and two parallel arms 
for on-demand or prophylaxis treatment. Subjects from study 2004 as well as additional subjects were 
included, repeat PK was done for a subgroup, and prophylaxis-intervals of 7, 10 and 14 days were 
studied. Duration of prophylaxis-period as suggested by the guideline is covered by the design. As 
patient population for Haemophilia B overall is limited, such design is acceptable. However, low patient 
numbers for each sub-population is considered to be challenging. Assignment of subjects to the 
prophylaxis or on-demand arm according to their previous regimen is a potential cause of bias. 
Furthermore, criteria for changing prophylaxis treatment regimen, i.e. extending the treatment interval 
from 7 to 10 or 14 days, apply to subjects with lower bleeding risk.  
Initial dosage suggestion for prophylaxis was 35-50 IU/kg once weekly and could be adapted according 
to clinical experience and factor IX trough levels. The efficacy endpoints regarding individual 
haemostasis-response for on-demand bleeds, efficacy response for surgical procedures including 
blood-loss and transfusions, and respective consumption follow the suggestions of the Clinical 
Guideline. For evaluation of efficacy under prophylaxis, ABR (AsBR) and comparison with the on-
demand period has been introduced; the associated challenges with this approach apply accordingly. 
Demographic data reflect an expected patient population. Body weight and BMI range are considered 
to be wide. However, no relevant differences between the treatment arms are overt. 
The study design of the efficacy-part of paediatric study 3002 is based upon PK-evaluation, individual 
historical data and clinical experience. All subjects received prophylaxis and on-demand-treatment was 
offered for bleeding episodes under prophylaxis. Non-emergency surgery was admitted and respective 
guidance for treatment was proposed. Initial dosage suggestion for prophylaxis was 35-50 IU/kg once 
weekly and could be adapted stepwise according to clinical effect, breakthrough-bleeds and factor IX 
trough levels. This dose-finding approach is considered to meet clinical needs. Dosage-
recommendation regarding on-demand and perioperative treatment in the study protocol corresponds 
with the suggestions of the Core-SmPC and has been adapted to the extended half-life which is 
considered to be adequate. Overall consumption for surgery according to the Guideline has been 
provided. 
Similar to study 3001, the efficacy endpoints regarding individual haemostasis-response for on-
demand bleeds, and consumption of FIX were reflected in the secondary efficacy endpoints and follow 
the Clinical Guideline. Efficacy response for surgical procedures including blood-loss and transfusions, 
and respective consumption were not part of the study-endpoints, but were recorded, accordingly. For 
evaluation of efficacy under prophylaxis, ABR (AsBR) and comparison with the on-demand period of 
previous therapy has been presented. Enrolment of two different age-groups in the paediatric 
population is reflected by the Clinical Guideline and is considered to be acceptable. Number of subjects 
meets the suggestions of the Clinical Guideline. Demographic data reflect an expected patient 
population. Consumption of Previous therapy corresponds with posology of plasma-derived and 
recombinant FIX-products. 
The design of study 3003 aims at supporting treatment intervals of 7 days up to 21 days with 
increasing doses and at documentation of surgeries. Follow-up of 3 years to achieve 100 Exposure 
days; efficacy response assessment and documentation of at least 10 surgeries in at least 5 individuals 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 97/117 
 
 
 
 
 
is in accordance with the requirements of the Clinical Guideline. Blood-loss and transfusions, and 
respective consumption were not part of the study-endpoints, but were recorded, accordingly which is 
considered to be acceptable.  
Demographic specifications reflect target population (adult/paediatric) and geographic location of the 
respective studies. For other parameters (height, weight, BMI) distribution with the exception of 
paediatric subjects is similar. The age-group above 65 years has not been covered although relevant in 
the light of increasing age of the target population, however, it is not a guideline requirement. 
Subjects from studies 3001, 3002, and 3003 who were undergoing surgery contributed to the overall 
evaluation. Efficacy and safety data during and after surgery were recorded, including dosage of rIX-
FP, Investigator’s assessments of overall efficacy on a 4-point scale, predicted and estimated actual 
blood loss, predicted and actual transfusion requirements, haematology, concomitant medications, and 
AEs. There were 15 surgeries in the rIX-FP clinical development program, including 12 surgeries in 
adolescents and adults (studies 3001 and 3003) and 3 surgeries in children < 12 years of age (studies 
3002 and 3003). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study 2004: ABR was recorded for on-demand treatment and prophylaxis. A median of 2.3 bleeds in 
the prophylaxis-group is considered to be acceptable, although a maximum of 14 bleeds seems to be 
high. ABR in the on-demand treatment group was with a median of 27 and a range of 24-30 bleeds in 
the assumed area of severe haemophilia. 
Median weekly consumption under prophylaxis-regimen was 53,8 IU/kg (range 47.7-75) compared 
with 73.2 IU/kg (range 21-154). Corresponding numbers are 2800 and 3806 IU/kg per year. 
The investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy of rIX-FP, was either excellent or good for the 
majority of bleeding episodes (excellent: 53/85 = 62.4%; good: 29/85 = 34.1%); haemostatic efficacy 
was assessed as moderate for the other 3 bleeding episodes (3.5%).Presented results are considered 
to be acceptable. 
For this newly developed extended half-life product, link between PK-results, PK-simulations and 
efficacy results is considered to be crucial as it represents the link between “surrogate” PK-calculations, 
simulated protective trough levels and clinical efficacy. According to the CSR of study 2004, mean of 
initial dosage (about 34 IU/kg/week) in the prophylaxis group has been increased to 62 IU/kg/week. 
This adaptation does not meet the results of the PK-simulations derived from PK-results but reflects 
higher doses. Similarly, increase of dosage for bleeding episodes under prophylaxis is remarkable: 
Mean initial dose was 33 IU/kg, at the end of the treatment period it was 57 IU/kg. No dosage-
increase was documented in the on-demand treatment-group. Relevant dosage increase under 
prophylaxis and the gap between PK-results required discussion and adaptations of the SmPC 
In study 3001 for the once-weekly regimen, median ABR was 0 (range 0-6), for the 10-days regimen 0 
(range 0-3.0) and the 14 days regimen 1.08 (range 0-9.1). Although the numbers are considered to be 
adequate, maximum of 9 bleeds in the 14-days-regimen and maximum of 21 in the on-demand-arm 
after switching to weekly prophylaxis, which is considered to be unexpectedly high. Median monthly 
consumption under prophylaxis-regimen (194, range 139-321 IU/kg) shows reduction when comparing 
once-weekly with previous prophylaxis (256, range 65-978 IU/kg). Further reduction of consumption 
can be demonstrated with the 14-days regimen (162, range 112-238).  
A subgroup of patients switched to extended treatment intervals (every 10 or 14 days) with a 
recommended dose of 75 IU/kg and individual adjustments. 21 PTPs remained on the extended 14 day 
prophylaxis interval for additional treatment duration of 98 to 575 (median 386) days. From those

subjects, 8 (38%) experienced at least one bleeding during the 14 day-prophylaxis, while they had no 
bleeding events during once weekly prophylaxis. These results provide adequate basis for the posology 
recommendations in the SmPC section 4.2. as follows: For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in 
patients with severe haemophilia B, the usual doses are 35 to 50 IU/kg once weekly. Some patients 
who are well-controlled on a once-weekly regimen might be treated with up to 75 IU/kg on an interval 
of 10 or 14 days (see sections 4.2 and 5.1 of the SmPC). 
The investigator’s assessment of haemostatic efficacy of rIX-FP, was either excellent or good for the 
majority of bleeding episodes (excellent: 297/358 = 83%; good: 40/358 = 34.1%); haemostatic 
efficacy was assessed as moderate for 9 bleeding episodes (2.5%). Presented results are considered to 
be acceptable. 
Perioperative haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent or good for all 6 surgical procedures. 
Consumption for each surgery shows wide range of 106 to 380 IU/kg in accordance with the underlying 
procedure. Details regarding total consumption specifically for the 3 major orthopaedic surgeries have 
been provided, in addition 
In study 3002 median total ABR was 2.64 (range 0-10) for the age <6 years and 3.39 (range 0-9.5) 
for the age 6 to <12 years. Such numbers are considered to be acceptable although maximum rates of 
10 do not meet an “ideal” ABR of 2 to zero. Furthermore, 20 bleeding episodes did not require 
treatment and were therefore not counted for the ABR. 6 Events were spontaneous, 11 traumatic and 
3 unknown. Prevention of bleeds into previous target joints has been documented for 2 of 3 respective 
subjects. In overall, efficacy of rIX-FP in prophylaxis in children is demonstrated. 
Dosage of the once-weekly prophylaxis regimen has been proposed to be 35-50 IU/kg with an 
adaptation approach similar to study 3001. Median weekly prophylaxis dose was 49 IU/kg for subjects 
<6 years with a minimum of 29 and a maximum of 69 IU/kg. For 6 to 12 year old children median 
dose was 43 IU/kg with a minimum of 31 and a maximum of 61 IU/kg.  
Investigator’s analysis of consumption shows about 2500 IU/kg/year for both age-groups. Relevant 
reduction compared with previous therapy (4472 IU/kg) has been documented. Investigator’s 
assessment of haemostatic efficacy in 106 bleeds was “excellent” or “good” in the majority (96%) of 
bleeding episodes which is considered be acceptable. However, for 20 bleeds no FIX-substitution was 
required, at all. 
Two surgical interventions (Tooth extractions) have been documented. Although these are considered 
to represent a narrow data-base, haemostatic efficacy has been demonstrated. The Clinical Guideline 
does not request documentation of surgical procedures in children.  
Results of surgery substudy of study 3003 are considered to be preliminary, detailed assessment of 
efficacy is expected for the final study report however, based upon the available data, haemostatic 
efficacy of FIX-FP to prevent haemorrhage in and post-surgery, is not doubted. 
Trough levels of 5-10% have been targeted in clinical trials for achieving bleeding control while on 
prophylaxis. PK simulations suggest the time to reach 5% plasma FIX activity following a single 
injection of 50 IU/kg Idelvion to be 7 days for 1-<6years, 9 days for 6-<12 years and 11 days for 12-
<18 years of age).  
Analysis across all studies showed that Control of bleeding episodes in paediatric and adult subjects is 
considered to be adequate. Efficacy assessment in terms of ABR regarding prophylaxis in adults was 
provided for studies 2004 and 3001. Median results for on-demand and prophylaxis differ between 
both studies (on-demand: 27 vs 19 bleed per year/subject; prophylaxis: 2.3 vs 0.6; study 2004 vs 
study 3001). As the dosage has been substantially increased, the results are considered to be

plausible. Efficacy of bleeding control during and after surgical procedures has been documented for 
rIX-FP. Surgery-related consumption, specifically for the major orthopaedic surgeries has been 
provided according to the Clinical Guideline. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy of rIX-FP in terms of successful once-weekly prophylaxis in adults and children, 
successful treatment of breakthrough bleeds and bleeding episodes in the on-demand setting and 
perioperative prophylaxis, has been documented.  
It is recommended (SmPC section 4.2) that for long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with 
severe haemophilia B, the usual doses are 35 to 50 IU/kg once weekly. Some patients who are well-
controlled on a once-weekly regimen might be treated with up to 75 IU/kg on an interval of 10 or 14 
days. Results from the clinical trials and available information have been included in section 5.1.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Results from the surgery substudy of ongoing clinical trial 3003 evaluating the efficacy of rIX-FP in the 
prevention and control of bleeding in subjects with severe haemophilia B during surgical procedures 
will be provided. This study is also expected to provide information with the use of the product in 
previously untreated patients.

Time on rIX-FP categorized by age for pooled studies 2001, 2004, 3001 and 3002 is presented as 
follows: 
Adverse events 
Of the 107 subjects in the Overall Safety population, 94 subjects (87.9%) reported at least 1 TEAE for 
a total of 579 AEs.  
Eight  subjects  (7.5%)  reported  AEs  that  were  considered  by  the  Investigator  to  be  related  to 
treatment:  
◦ 
In  Study  2001,  three  subjects  (12.0%)  experienced  4  AEs  that  were  considered  by  the 
Investigator to be possibly related to treatment with rIX-FP: 
· 
· 
· 
1 subject (25 IU/kg rIX-FP): constipation;  
1 subject (50 IU/kg rIX-FP): mild headache and feeling hot;  
1 subject (75 IU/kg rIX-FP): injection site erythema.  
All events resolved within 1 day. 
◦ 
In Study 3001, five subjects experienced 11 AEs that were considered by the Investigator to 
be related to rIX-FP: 
· 
· 
· 
· 
· 
· 
rash (5 events),  
headache (2 events),  
eczema,  
dizziness,  
injection site haematoma, and  
hypersensitivity.  
In 2 of these subjects, the AEs (headache and hypersensitivity) led to discontinuation of study 
treatment. 
A multidisciplinary sponsor team reviewed all treatment-emergent AEs and categorised the PTs 
presented in the following table, which is also depicted in section 4.8 of the proposed SmPC.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
A total of 8 treatment-emergent SAEs were reported for 6 subjects (5.6%) in the Overall Safety 
population (which included subjects in studies 2001, 2004, 3001, and 3002). None of the SAEs were 
considered by the Investigator to be related to administration of rIX-FP. 
There were no deaths.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In Study 2001, 1 subject had a clinically significant decrease (as rated by the Investigator) in 
erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV) which was not accompanied by any AEs. 
In Study 3002, treatment-emergent abnormal haematology values were observed in a total of 17 
subjects, and were assessed as clinically significant in 4 subjects as follows: 1 subject with high 
leukocytes, low haematocrit, low haemoglobin, low MCV, and low erythrocytes; 1 subject with low 
MCV; 1 subject with low erythrocytes, low haematocrit, and low haemoglobin; and 1 subject with low 
erythrocytes. Of these 4 subjects, 3 reported mild AEs of anaemia, none of which was considered by 
the Investigator to be related to the administration of rIX-FP. 
In Study 3001 and Study 3003, abnormal haematology values were observed in subjects undergoing 
surgery (4 subjects in Study 3001 and 1 subject in Study 3003). For 2 subjects (one in Study 3001 
and 3003 each), AEs of anaemia was reported, but not considered related to FIX-FP. 
Biochemistry  
In Study 3002, treatment-emergent abnormal ALT (5 patients) and AST (4 patients), were observed in 
7 subjects. In the other studies abnormal ALT and AST values were mostly accompanied by liver 
diseases and abnormal values were observed already at screening.  
Markers for Coagulation Activation 
Markers of activation of coagulation, including prothrombin fragment 1+2, thrombin-antithrombin 
(TAT) and D-dimer, were measured before and after injection of rIX-FP in studies 2001 and 3001. 
These markers were not measured in studies 2004, 3002 or 3003. 
In Study 2001, 1 subject had a mild and transient increase in 2 of the 3 markers for activation of 
coagulation (TAT and D-dimer) after administration of rIX-FP that were assessed by the Investigator as 
clinically significant. However, there was no clinical evidence of thrombosis.  
In Study 3001, none of the markers for activation of coagulation were outside the normal range.

Safety in special populations 
Analyses of treatment-emergent AEs and local tolerability data were performed for the following 
subgroups in the Overall Safety population: 
•  Age: 0 to <12 (n = 27) and ≥12 to ≤65 years (n = 80) 
•  BMI: <30 kg/m2 (n = 100) and ≥30 kg/m2 (n = 6) 
•  Race: white (n = 94), black (n = 2), Asian (n = 10), and other (n = 1). 
The analyses were not indicative of a specific pattern in these special populations. 
There were no patients above 65 years of age. 
Adverse events in subjects undergoing surgical procedures 
As of the 09 January 2015 data cut-off, a total of 13 subjects have undergone 1 or more surgical 
procedures while receiving rIX-FP prophylaxis treatment. Of these subjects, 8 experienced AEs during 
the perioperative period (2 AEs Anaemia, 2 AEs Pyrexia, 2 AEs Procedural pain, 2 AEs Blister and 1 AE 
Postoperative wound infection, Abdominal distension, Gastrointestinal injury, Urinary tract infection, 
Dental caries, Otitis externa each). No AEs were considered to be related to administration of rIX-FP. 
Immunological events 
Inhibitor formation 
No  inhibitors  against  FIX  were  reported  in  studies  2001,  2004,  3001,  or  3002.  As  of  the  09  January 
2015 data cut-off, no inhibitors against FIX were reported in Study 3003. 
Antibodies to rIX-FP 
In Study 2004, 1 subject tested positive for antibodies against BeneFIX, pdFIX, and rIX-FP before the 
first injection of rIX-FP (Day 1) and during the PK assessment (Day 10). Subsequently, the subject 
tested positive for antibodies against pdFIX only at Week 4 and negative for BeneFIX, pdFIX, and rIX-
FP at Week 12. 
No treatment-emergent antibodies to rIX-FP were reported in the Overall Safety population. As of the 
09 January 2015 data cut-off, no treatment-emergent antibodies against rIX-FP were reported in Study 
3003 either. 
In studies 3001, 3002, and 3003, testing for inhibitors to CHO host cell protein was also performed, 
and as of the data cut-off date no subjects tested positive. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In the Overall Safety population, there was 1 TEAE ‘Hypersensitivity’, which was considered being 
related to rIX-FP treatment. Other hypersensitivity reactions related to study treatment were ‘Rash’ 
and ‘Eczema’. All these AEs were included as ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC (please also see section 
‘Adverse events’ above).  
Adverse events of special interest 
Besides of immunological events, no further AEs of special interest like in particular thromboembolic 
events or nephrotic syndrome could be identified.  
However, as already mentioned above in subsection ‘Laboratory findings’, 1 subject had an increase in 
markers for activation of coagulation (F1+2, TAT and D-dimer). For this 54-year-old subject , no 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 104/117 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical signs of thrombosis were reported. D-dimer indeed is to be regarded a non-specific marker. 
Together with the increase of F1+2 and TAT, though, at least laboratory results are indicative of an 
altered coagulation status in this patient. But as correlating clinical findings could not be observed and 
increase of the laboratory markers was only transient, definite conclusions cannot be drawn. 
Thromboembolic events (TEE) are addressed as a potential risk of rIX-FP in the RMP, so that at this 
stage, no further actions are needed. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The metabolism of rIX-FP results in smaller peptide fragments and amino acids, and it is unlikely that 
rIX-FP has the potential to be involved in any metabolism-based drug-drug interactions. Because rIX-
FP is administered as an IV injection, there is no potential for an interaction with food. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Two subjects (1.9%), both from Study 3001, discontinued from study because of AEs. 1 subject 
experienced a hypersensitivity reaction that is further discussed above in subsection ‘Immunological 
events’. 1 subject experienced a headache, which was considered by the Investigator to be related to 
rIX-FP; from this case, however, no concern arises. 
As of the data cut-off date of 09 January 2015, 1 subject was withdrawn from Study 3003 because of a 
TEAE (elevated GGT) that was ongoing from Study 3001. The event was initially assessed as related to 
treatment, but in the end more likely considered attributable to an underlying alcoholic liver disease. 
Post marketing experience 
N/A 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data are presented for an overall safety population of 107 previously treated subjects with 
haemophilia B (factor IX ≤ 2%) out of the completed clinical studies 2001, 2004, 3001, and 3002 and 
the ongoing study (3003).  Patient exposure is in compliance with requirements of the current EMA 
factor IX guidance with respect to rIX-FP exposure days (EDs) and long-term exposure ≥6 months. 
The size of the available safety database, 107 subjects of whom 27 are PTPs <12 years (Overall Safety 
Population) and 80 subjects with 24 < 12 years (ongoing Study 3003), exceeds guideline 
requirements.  
All studies assessed safety of rIX-FP, with particular emphasis on immunogenicity and development of 
rIX-FP antibodies. To date, there have been no reports of virus transmission, thromboembolism or 
inhibitor-development related to rIX-FP.  
The 107 treated subjects in the Overall Safety Population received a total of 190.257.46 IU of rIX-FP in 
6480 infusions. The total number of EDs was 6471, mean EDs were 60.5. Of these, 75 patients 
(70.1%) had EDs ≥ 50 days, 33 patients (30.8%) ≥ 75 days and 16 patients (15%) ≥ 100 days, which 
is, according to Guideline requirements considered sufficient. 
Of these 107 subjects, 94 subjects (87.9%) reported at least 1 TEAE for a total of 579 AEs. Of these 
AEs, 483, 88, and 8 were mild, moderate, and severe, respectively. Eight subjects (7.5%) reported 15 
AEs (headache, dizziness, feeling hot, injection site erythema, injection site haematoma, rash, eczema, 
constipation and hypersensitivity), that were considered by the Investigator to be related to treatment. 
The treatment-related hypersensitivity reaction in 1 subject was, based on a review by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/213825/2016  
Page 105/117 
 
 
 
 
 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), assessed as an injection reaction rather than a 
hypersensitivity reaction. One subject chose to withdraw after occurrence of 5 AEs of rash 
(“exanthem”). Therefore no specific concerns are noted.  
In the supportive study 3003 with data cut-off on 09 January 2015, 29 patients (36.3%) reported a 
total of 74 TEAEs. All were mild or moderate in severity and not treatment-related.  
No difference in the occurrence of AEs between 25 IU/kg, 50 IU/kg and 75 IU/kg were observed and in 
the main, type and frequency of AEs were similar between subjects 0 to < 12 years of age and 
subjects ≥ 12 to 65 years of age. Differences in the frequency of certain AEs are expected for the 
general population of that age group.  
The incidence of SAEs (8 in the Overall Safety Population and 2 in Supportive Study 3003) is 
considered low. All SAEs were not related to the administration of rIX-FP and no death occurred in any 
of the studies. Local tolerability was good throughout all studies. 
Changes in clinical laboratory parameters during studies 2001, 2004, 3001 and 3003 were generally 
minor and not considered to be clinically significant. Concerning study 3002 in paediatric patients, 
treatment-emergent abnormal ALT (5 patients) and AST (4 patients) values were observed in 7 
subjects. In the other studies abnormal ALT and AST values were mostly accompanied by liver 
diseases and abnormal values were observed already at screening. The seemingly higher frequency of 
these treatment emergent abnormalities in study 3002 in comparison to the other studies was not 
considered to be clinically relevant.  
No inhibitors against FIX and no treatment-emergent antibodies to rIX-FP were reported in the Overall 
Safety population and in Study 3003 at time of data cut-off. Furthermore, no inhibitors to CHO host 
cell protein in studies 3001, 3002 and 3003 were detected. 
Breaking the immunotolerance against serumalbumin is a quite unlikely event due to its abundant 
presence in serum. Nevertheless, in case antibodies directed against the serumalbumin part of rIX-FP 
are generated, those may be missed due to the abundant presence of HSA in the plasma samples, 
potentially cross-reacting with the humoral immune response. Nevertheless no specific concerns have 
been seen so far, this uncertainty remains to be further reviewed in the post authorisation setting (See 
RMP).    
Besides other process related impurities (like HCPs) also the serine protease Furin is co-expressed with 
rIX-FP in cell line to ensure efficient cleavage of propeptide to mature rIX-FP and around 1.0-4.4 ppm 
measured at the Drug Substance level. A discussion on the potential development of Furin antibodies 
in patients and its clinical impact revealed no concerns. 
According to the Guideline on Summary of Product Characteristics (September 2009) section 4.8 of the 
SmPC should include all adverse reactions from clinical trials, post-authorisation safety studies and 
spontaneous reporting for which, after thorough assessment, a causal relationship between the 
medicinal product and the adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. Therefore, related AEs 
“eczema” and “constipation” should also be included in the SmPC section 4.8. Moreover, according to 
MedDRA, the adverse reactions “infusion site reactions” are listed 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (see section 4.8.) 
Participation in EUHASS registry will enable collection of long-term safety data. 
The ongoing extension Safety and Efficacy Extension Study 3003 will aim to evaluate the safety of rIX-
FP as measured by new cases of inhibitors against factor IX in Subjects with Haemophilia B, including

PUPs –  AEs of special interest include: Hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions, TEEs, and development 
of inhibitors to factor IX. (See RMP). 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the data as presented by the applicant, no substantial safety concern arises. No serious adverse 
events could be observed and no inhibitory antibody to rFIX-FP could be detected.  Hypersensitivity 
reactions to rIX-FP, by contrast, occurred during clinical development, but neither frequency nor 
severity was different from what would be expected for a FIX product. rIX-FP prophylactic doses 
proposed in the SmPC (up to 75 IU/kg) exceed current factor IX core SmPC recommendations. Dose-
related safety data has been provided by the applicant in order to enable re-evaluation of the SmPC 
posology and/or the possible need for further (post-marketing) measures.  
In conclusion, the size of the safety database available at the moment exceeds guideline requirements, 
and the nature and frequency of the reported adverse events do not give rise to concern and do not 
reveal unexpected safety signals. rIX-FP was well tolerated in all age groups and safety results are 
consistent between all submitted clinical trials. Therefore the safety database is considered to be 
sufficient to support a MA. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
• 
Long-term safety data from patients’ participation in EUHASS registry will be provided as part 
of PSUR reporting. 
•  Regular reports from the ongoing extension Safety and Efficacy Extension Study 3003 
evaluating the safety of rIX-FP focusing on the development  of inhibitors against factor IX in 
Subjects with Haemophilia B, including PUPs –  will be provided as part of the PSURs (see 
RMP).

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Idelvion (albutrepenonacog alfa) is included 
in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was 
not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.> 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Clinical efficacy of rIX-FP has been investigated, in a step-wise approach: PK calculations have been 
based upon FIX-activity measurements mainly after 50 IU/kg and amended by 25 and 75 IU/kg ctivity 
data were used for a population PK analysis, simulating FIX activity levels after pre-defined doses (25, 
40, 50, 75 IU/kg). Dosage-suggestions for prophylaxis in Study 2004 (15-35 IU/kg once weekly) and 
on-demand treatment (initial dose not less than 25 IU/kg) were based upon these results. However, 
doses for treatment of bleeding episodes as well as for prophylaxis had to be increased during the 
study. For the following studies 3001 and 3002, initial prophylaxis doses were increased to 35-50 
IU/kg and for on-demand treatment to at least 35 IU/kg. Different dosing regimens for prophylactic 
treatment were investigated due to prolonged half-life, including a once weekly, every 10-day and an 
every 14-day treatment interval. 
Most of the bleeding episodes were treated successfully with 1 or 2 infusions in all studies and 
haemostatic efficacy was rated as excellent or good for the majority of bleeding episodes. 
Assessment report

Subjects who received prophylactic treatment started with 35-50 IU/kg once weekly. A subgroup of 
patients switched to extended treatment intervals (every 10 or 14 days) with a recommended dose of 
75 IU/kg and individual adjustments. 21 PTPs remained on the extended 14 day prophylaxis interval 
for additional treatment duration of 98 to 575 (median 386) days. From those subjects, 8 (38%) 
experienced at least one bleeding during the 14 day-prophylaxis, while they had no bleeding events 
during once weekly prophylaxis. Median Annualised Bleeding Rate (ABR) on 7 day prophylaxis with 
Idelvion for all bleeds was 0.0 (range 0-6) and on 14 day-prophylaxis it was 1.08 (range 0-
9.1).Currently available information support extension of treatment intervals for some patients though 
potentially associated with an increased risk for bleeding compared to a once weekly regimen. Of note, 
ABR is not comparable between different factor concentrates and between different clinical studies. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Efficacy information in previously untreated patients is missing and will be provided from Clinical study 
3003; A Phase 3b open-label, multicentre, Safety and Efficacy Extension Study of a Recombinant 
Coagulation factor IX Albumin Fusion Protein (rIX-FP) in Subjects with Haemophilia B, including PUPs 
(see RMP). 
Efficacy of bleeding control peri-operatively has been documented for rIX-FP and product consumption 
for major surgeries has been satisfactory although, further data are expected from the surgery 
substudy of clinical trial 3003 (See RMP).  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Of the 107 subjects, 8 subjects (7.5%) reported 15 AEs (headache, dizziness, feeling hot, injection site 
erythema, injection site haematoma, rash, eczema, constipation and hypersensitivity), that were 
considered by the Investigator to be related to treatment. The treatment-related hypersensitivity 
reaction in 1 subject was, based on a review by the IDMC, assessed as an injection reaction rather 
than a hypersensitivity reaction. In the clinical study programme of rIX-FP, no inhibitory antibody to 
the product could be observed in a total of 107 subjects and also no other (non-inhibitory) anti-drug 
antibody newly emerged under treatment. No thromboembolic events occurred and there were no 
renal complications. Clinical data are thus not indicative of an elevated inhibitor incidence.  
There are insufficient data on inhibitor incidence in PUPs. 
Important unfavourable effects of any FIX product include immunogenicity (inhibitor development and 
hypersensitivity reactions), thromboembolic events and, especially in association with high treatment 
doses, nephrotic syndrome.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The rIX-FP safety database is limited with regard to elderly patients aged 65 years and over, which is 
reflected in the SmPC as well as in the RMP. The uncertainties regarding the missing data in elderly 
patients have sufficiently been addressed through their reflection in SmPC and RMP. 
Moreover, uncertainties exist with regard to possible unfavourable effects related to the albumin fusion 
technology of this new recombinant FIX product. In this context, uncertainties especially remain as to 
whether a - yet unobserved - additional potential for immunogenicity has to be taken into account.  
Further safety data – including data in previously untreated patients- from the ongoing study 3003 and 
data from the EUHASS registry are expected in the post-authorisation phase (See RMP).

Clinical efficacy 
ABR vary considerably between studies and 
depend on dosage-regimen;  
According to the Clinical Guideline, ABR has not 
been introduced as an efficacy parameter. Lack of 
definitions for a “bleed”, for “spontaneous” or 
“traumatic” nature of such bleed and individual 
evaluation factors are considered to be 
challenging when comparing numbers. Some 
patients received add-on pre-activity treatment 
Comparison of ABR while on on-demand versus on 
prophylaxis-regimen is of highly restricted value: 
On-demand therapy mainly represents severity of 
haemophilia (overall bleeding frequency) and not 
efficacy of a certain product. On the other hand, 
total ABR while on prophylaxis, ideally should aim 
at zero bleeds. Considerable number of bleeds did 
not require treatment and are therefore not 
included in the ABR.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Efficacy of rIX-FP has been established in an extensive clinical investigation program. Results of PK-
evaluation reflect relevant increase of half-life when compared with standard FIX-products. Such 
increase has been awaited by the target population, as treatment intervals for prophylaxis with 
standard products are short (2-3 times per week) and can be increased to at least once weekly with 
rIX-FP while maintaining a high standard of bleeding control. Efficacy has been demonstrated by low 
ABR, lower FIX-consumption when compared with previous treatment and high-level of haemostatic 
efficacy in the on-demand and surgical setting. 
Main advantage of this new FIX product is the assumed extended treatment interval for prophylaxis. It 
is acknowledged that dosing in haemophilia patients is individual and based on the experience of the 
treating physician.  
The safety profile of rIX-FP seems to be in line with other FIX products from the data presented so far. 
In theory, higher doses would bear the risk of high maximum activity-levels with consecutive risk of 
thrombosis or thrombo-embolism at least in patients at risk (e.g. obese, elderly, cardiovascular 
diseases). Although not observed during the clinical study, the improved efficacy of rIX-FP (and 
obviously low ABR in study 3001 compared to other licensed FIX products) could lead to a higher risk 
of thromboembolic events. This is addressed in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The overall Benefit /Risk of Idelvion in the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with 
haemophilia B (congenital factor IX deficiency) is considered to be positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Overall, efficacy of rIX- FP for preventing bleeding episodes, treatment of breakthrough bleeds, on-
demand treatment and surgical prophylaxis in adults and children is shown. PK results show that rIX-
FP has an improved PK profile compared to other licensed FIX products (prolonged t1/2, increased 
AUC, MRT, decreased CL). Efficacy and safety were demonstrated in the prophylactic setting, in the on-
demand treatment of bleeding events and break-through bleeds with different dosing regimens as well 
as in surgical interventions. PK results and efficacy results have been translated into relevant posology 
recommendations. 
The safety profile of rIX - FP is comparable to other FIX products but due to the small haemophilia B 
population the safety database is rather small. Only a small proportion of observed AEs (15/579) in 8 
subjects were assessed as related and Adverse Drug Reactions to rIX-FP by the investigators. No 
related SAEs occurred and importantly, no thromboembolic event or severe allergic reactions were 
observed. Additional information in long-term use and use in PUPs will be provided from ongoing 
studies and registries in the post-marketing setting.  
Possible unknown unfavourable effects related to the albumin fusion technology of rIX-FP and missing 
data – especially with regard to previously untreated patients - will be covered by the post-marketing 
clinical programme, as well as additional data in the peri-surgery setting in accordance with the clinical 
FIX guidance and has already started.

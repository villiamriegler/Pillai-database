1  BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE 
2.1 Submission of the dossier 
The  applicant  Merck  Sharp  &  Dohme  Ltd.  submitted  on  3  September  2007  an  application  for 
Marketing  Authorisation  to  the  European  Medicines  Agency  (EMEA)  for  TESAVEL,  through  the 
centralised procedure according to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The legal basis for this application refers to Article 10(c) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, 
relating to informed consent from the marketing authorisation holder, Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, for 
the authorised medicinal product Januvia (EU/1/07/383/001-018). 
Scientific Advice: 
The applicant did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP. 
Licensing status: 
The initial product, Januvia, has been given a Community Marketing Authorisation on 21 March 2007. 
The Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteur appointed by the CHMP and the evaluation teams were: 
Rapporteur: Pieter de Graeff  Co-Rapporteur: Harald Enzmann 
2.2 Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The application was received by the EMEA on 3 September 2007. 
The procedure started on 16 September 2007.  
The Rapporteur's first Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 18 October 
2007. The Co-Rapporteur's first Assessment Report was circulated to all CHMP members on 18 
October 2007.  
During  the  meeting  on  12-15  November  2007,  the  CHMP,  in  the  light  of  the  overall  data

2  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 Introduction 
This application has been submitted as an informed consent application in accordance with Article 10c 
of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended.   
Therefore,  consent  from  the  MAH  of  the  Januvia  application,  which  had  been  submitted  as  a  full 
application  under  Art  8(3)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  as  amended,  has  been  given  allowing  access  to 
Module  2  to  Module  5  of  the  initial  dossier  of  this  authorised  product  and  any  subsequent  post-
marketing procedures submitted, assessed and approved. The application for TESAVEL consists only 
of Module 1 information. 
As a consequence, quality, safety and efficacy of the TESAVEL medicinal product are identical to the 
up-to-date quality, safety and efficacy profile of Januvia. Information on the scientific discussions can 
be  found  in  the  Januvia  CHMP  assessment  report  and  in  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report 
(EPAR). 
The approved indication is:  
“For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, TESAVEL is indicated: 
• 
to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  metformin  when  diet  and  exercise  plus 
metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea  when  diet  and  exercise  plus 
maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and 
when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
to improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and 
exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
• 
• 
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in whom use of a PPARγ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) is 
appropriate, TESAVEL is indicated: 
• 
in combination with the PPARγ agonist when diet and exercise plus the PPARγ agonist alone do 
not provide adequate glycaemic control.” 
The  dose  is  100 mg  sitagliptin  once  daily.  The  dosage  of  metformin  or  PPARγ  agonist  should  be 
maintained,  and  TESAVEL  administered  concomitantly.  When  TESAVEL  is  used  in  combination 
with  a  sulphonylurea,  a  lower  dose  of  the  sulphonylurea  may  be  considered  to  reduce  the  risk  of 
hypoglycaemia. 
The  active  substance  of  TESAVEL  is  sitagliptin  phosphate  monohydrate,  a  dipeptidyl  peptidase-4 
(DPP-4) inhibitor. DPP-4 inhibition reduces the cleavage and inactivation of the active (intact) form of 
the  incretin  hormones,  including  glucagon-like  peptide  1  (GLP-1)  and  glucose  dependent  inhibitory 
peptide (GIP), producing an elevation of incretin concentrations that lead to enhancement of glucose-
dependent insulin secretion and a reduction in glucagon release. 
The benefit of TESAVEL is a demonstrated reduction in baseline HbA1c at 24 weeks in combination 
with  metformin,  or  a  PPARγ  agonist,  or  a  sulphonylurea,  or  a  sulphonylurea  and  metformin,  in 
patients who have not responded to metformin alone, or a maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea, 
or a combination sulphonylurea and metformin, or a PPARγ agonist. It has also shown a reduction in 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG). The most common side effect when taking TESAVEL with metformin 
is  nausea.  When  taking  TESAVEL  with  pioglitazone,  they  are  low  blood  sugar,  flatulence  and  foot 
swelling.  The  most  common  side  effect  when  taking  TESAVEL  with  a  sulfonylurea  is  low  blood 
sugar. When taking TESAVEL with metformin and a sulfonylurea the most common side effects are 
low blood sugar and constipation. When taking TESAVEL alone, the most common side effects are 
low  blood  sugar,  headache,  stuffy  or  runny  nose  and  sore  throat.  Additional  adverse  experiences 
reported  regardless  of  causal  relationship  to  medication  that  occurred  more  frequently  in  patients 
treated with TESAVEL included osteoarthritis and pain in extremity.

2.2 Quality aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Januvia application, the quality data in support of 
the  TESAVEL  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  quality  data  of  the  Januvia  dossier  which 
have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.3 Non-clinical aspects 
Since  this  application  is  an  informed  consent  of  the  Januvia  application,  the  non-clinical  data  in 
support  of  the  TESAVEL  application are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  non-clinical  data  of  the  Januvia 
dossier, which have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.4 Clinical aspects 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Januvia application, the clinical data in support of 
the  TESAVEL  application  are  identical  to  the  up-to-date  clinical  data  of  the  Januvia  dossier,  which 
have been assessed and approved (including all post-marketing procedures). 
2.5 Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
Risk Management Plan 
The MAA submitted a risk management plan, which included a risk minimisation plan

2.6 Overall conclusions, risk/benefit assessment and recommendation 
Since this application is an informed consent of the Januvia application, the CHMP considered that the 
risk-benefit  balance  of  TESAVEL  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the 
marketing authorisation for the following indication:  
For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, TESAVEL is indicated: 
• 
to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  metformin  when  diet  and  exercise  plus 
metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
to  improve  glycaemic  control  in  combination  with  a  sulphonylurea  when  diet  and  exercise  plus 
maximal tolerated dose of a sulphonylurea alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control and 
when metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. 
to improve glycaemic control in combination with a sulphonylurea and metformin when diet and 
exercise plus dual therapy with these agents do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in whom use of a PPARγ agonist (i.e. a thiazolidinedione) is 
appropriate, TESAVEL is indicated:

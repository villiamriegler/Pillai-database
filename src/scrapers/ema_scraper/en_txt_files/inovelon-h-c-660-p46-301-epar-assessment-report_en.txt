I. 
INTRODUCTION 
On March 31th 2014, the MAH submitted the synoptic clinical study report for study E2080-J081-
305  for  INOVELON  (rufinamide),  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  the  Regulation  (EC)  No 
1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use.  
The  MAH  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  study  does  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for 
INOVELON and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
On  August  11th  2014,  as  requested,  Eisai  Ltd  submits  to  the  EMA  the  responses  to  the 
Outstanding Questions. 
II. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
II.1 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the clinical study 
The  study  was  conducted  using  Inovelon  tablet  formulation  since  an  alternative  paediatric 
formulation  was  not  available  at  this  time.  Eisai  Limited  had  since  been  granted  a  marketing 
approval  for  a  line  extension  MAA  for  an  oral  suspension  formulation  for  use  in  children 
(Commission decision issued on 21/11/2011). 
II.2 
Clinical aspects 
1.  Introduction 
Study  E2080-J081-305  was  a  multicentre  long  term  extension  study,  to  evaluate  the  long  term 
safety  and  tolerability  of  rufinamide  under  the  open-label  treatment  in  patients  with  Lennox-
Gastaut  syndrome  (LGS)  who  completed 
the  phase  3  placebo-controlled,  double-blind, 
comparative study (study E2080-J081-304). 
Methods 
2.  Clinical study 
The Pre-conversion Period was designed to avoid breaking the blindness in the preceding Study 
304 and to prevent any data obtained in the open-label treatment in Study 305 from affecting the 
evaluation  in  the  Study  304.  Under  double-blind  condition,  subjects  were  treated  with  the  same 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
EMA/711031/2014

study drug as in the Study 304 (the Study Drug A; rufinamide or placebo) until the evaluation data 
of the Study 304 for each subject were fixed. 
In the Conversion Period, subjects who were on placebo were titrated to the appropriate dose of 
rufinamide (the Study Drug B) within 2 weeks under double-blind condition. 
The long term safety and efficacy of rufinamide were evaluated under the open-label treatment in 
the  Maintenance  Period.  The  daily  dose  at  the  end  of  the  Conversion  Period  was  used  as  the 
initial dose for the Maintenance Period. Treatment of rufinamide (the Study Drug B) was allowed to 
be  continued  as  long  as  the  subject  and  legally  authorized  representative  desired  to  keep 
receiving rufinamide and the investigator permitted that. 
The Maintenance Period was allowed to continue until rufinamide was launched in Japan and was 
to  be  commercially  available  in  the  respective  study  sites.  This  study  was  conducted  as  a 
registration study before the launch and as a post-marketing study after that. 
The  study  was  to  finish  within  around  3  months  after  the  price  listing  of  rufinamide.  In  case 
subjects discontinued the study, the study drug was to be tapered (Follow-up Period), but subjects 
who  completed  Study  305  were  allowed  to  continue  receiving  rufinamide  as  a  commercial  drug 
without tapering. 
The study drug was administered orally twice daily after breakfast and dinner. 
1. Pre-conversion Period 
Under double-blind condition, subjects were treated with the same study drug as in the Study 304 
(the Study Drug A; rufinamide or placebo). As a general rule, the dose was to be maintained at the 
dose of the final evaluation (Week 12) in the Study 304. 
When the investigator judged dose reduction was necessary to attempt for safety concerns on a 
subject who completed the Study 304 at the target maintenance dose, a 1- step reduction from the 
target maintenance dose was allowed. This reduction was performed from the next morning of the 
judgment,  if  feasible.  Returning  to  the  previous  dose  (ie,  the  target  maintenance  dose)  after  the 
reduction was prohibited. 
In  subjects  for  whom  the  dose  had  been  reduced  from  the  target  maintenance  dose  by  the 
completion  of  the  Study  304,  further  dose  reduction  was  prohibited  under  any  circumstances. 
Subjects were to be withdrawn from the study if further dose reduction was judged to be necessary 
for safety reasons by the investigator 
For reference, dose steps to the target maintenance dose depended on the subject’s weight in the 
Study 304 are shown in Table 1. 
2. Conversion Period 
Under double-blind conditions, subjects who were on placebo were titrated to the appropriate dose 
of  rufinamide  within  2  weeks  in  a  manner  similar  to  the  dose  steps  shown  above.  Study  Drug A 
(double-blind;  rufinamide  or  placebo  tablets)  was  switched  to  the  Study  Drug  B  (open-label; 
rufinamide tablets) in a step-by-step manner by 2 days.

Daily number of tablets on the final day of the Pre-conversion Period (constant) 
= Daily number of tablets of the Study Drug A (taper off by 2 days) 
                     + Daily number of tablets of the Study Drug B (gradual increase by 2 days) 
If a safety problem was observed during conversion, the conversion could be suspended and daily 
numbers of tablets of the Study Drug A and Study Drug B were maintained temporarily.  
Even  in  such  a  case,  the  conversion  was  to  be  completed  by  2  days  before  the  end  of  the 
Conversion Period. 
When the investigator judged dose reduction was necessary to attempt for safety concerns on a 
subject who had completed the conversion, a 1-step reduction was allowed only for subjects who 
had  administered  at  the  target  maintenance  dose.  This  reduction  was  performed  from  the  next 
morning  of  the  judgment,  if  feasible.  Returning  to  the  previous  dose  (ie,  the  target  maintenance 
dose) after the reduction was prohibited. 
3. Maintenance Period 
As a general rule, the dose of rufinamide (Study Drug B) at the end of the Conversion Period was 
to be maintained throughout the Maintenance Period. 
When the investigator judged dose reduction was necessary to attempt for safety concerns, a 1-
step reduction from the target maintenance dose was allowed. This reduction was performed from 
the next morning of the judgment, if feasible. 
In subjects for whom the dose had been reduced 1-step from the target maintenance dose by the 
end  of  the  Conversion  Period,  further  dose  reduction  during  the  Maintenance  Period  was 
prohibited. Subjects were to be withdrawn from the study if further dose reduction was judged to 
be necessary for safety reasons by the investigator. 
Dose  increase  to  the  target  maintenance  dose  was  allowed  only  when  the  investigator  judged 
necessary.  Administrations  at  a  higher  dose  than  the  target  maintenance  dose  was  prohibited 
under any circumstances. 
Even when the body weight changed during the study period, dose adjustment based on the new 
weight category was not to be conducted in the registration study part. 
However, since rufinamide had been launched in Japan, the maintenance dose was to follow the 
approved dosage. In such a case, dose adjustment based on the new  weight category might be 
allowed as long as same tablet form (100 mg tablet or 200 mg tablet) was used. 
In subjects who completed Study 305 and continued receiving rufinamide as a  commercial drug, 
tapering of rufinamide and the Follow-up Period were not required. 
4. Follow-up Period (Tapering; when discontinuing the study) 
As a general rule, the dose was reduced by step-by-step every 2 days. The dose reduction was 
started from the next morning of the study discontinuation decided by the investigator, if feasible. 
Dose reduction could be postponed and the current dose maintained temporarily by the judgment 
of the investigator only if there was a safety problem. Even in this case, study drug administration 
was to be terminated at least by 12 days after start tapering. 
Dose steps for tapering rufinamide are shown in Table 2.

Objectives 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 
• To evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of rufinamide under the open-label treatment in 
patients  with  Lennox-Gastaut  syndrome  (LGS)  who  completed  the  phase  3  placebo-controlled, 
double-blind, comparative study (E2080-J081-304 study, herein after as Study 304). 
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 
• To evaluated the long term efficacy of rufinamide under the open-label treatment in patients with 
LGS who completed the Study 304. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy outcome: Percent change in tonic-atonic seizure frequency, percent change in the 
total  seizure  frequency,  percent  change  in  the  frequency  of  seizures  other  than  tonic-atonic 
seizures, and 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% responder, and aggravated subjects in tonic-atonic seizure 
frequency. 
Safety outcomes: 
Adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, blood pressure, pulse rate, physical examination, and 12-
lead ECG. 
• Statistical methods 
Efficacy 
For  percent  change  in  tonic-atonic  seizure  frequency,  the  total  seizure  frequency,  and  the 
frequency of seizures other than tonic-atonic seizures, the summary statistics were calculated for 
the entire Efficacy Analysis Set and for each treatment group in Study 304.

For 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% responder, and aggravated subjects in tonic-atonic seizure frequency, 
responder (or aggravated) rates were calculated for the entire Efficacy Analysis Set and for each 
treatment group in Study 304. For percent change in tonic-atonic seizure frequency and the total 
seizure frequency, median percent change was plotted by visit for each treatment group in Study 
304. 
Safety 
Adverse  events  were  coded  using  the  Medical  Dictionary  for  Regulatory  Activities  (MedDRA) 
Version  13.0.  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  and  treatment  related  TEAEs  were 
summarized  for  the  entire  Safety  Analysis  Set  and  for  each  treatment  group  in  Study  304,  the 
number  and  percent  of  subjects  having  any  adverse  event  in  each  primary  system  organ  class 
(SOC)  and  having  each  preferred  term  (PT).  In  addition,  TEAEs  and  treatment  related  TEAEs 
were  tabulated  by  causal  relationship  with  the  study  drug  or  by  severity.  For  laboratory  tests 
(hematology,  blood  chemistry,  and  urinalysis),  vital  signs  (blood  pressure,  pulse  rate,  and  body 
weight),  and  12-lead  ECG  (heart  rate,  PR  interval,  QRS  amplitude,  QT  interval,  and  QTc),  the 
summary  statistics  of  the  observed  value  at  each  assessment  time  point,  and  changes  from  the 
end  of  the  Observation  Period  in  Study  304  (baseline)  were  calculated  for  the  entire  Safety 
Analysis  Set  and  for  each  treatment  group.  Urinalysis  data  were  subjected  to  cross-tabulation 
between  the  end  of  the  Observation  Period  in  Study  304  (baseline)  and  each  assessment  time 
point after the start of treatment. 
Results  
• 
Participant flow  
Fifty subjects were planned. 54 (25 in the rufinamide group, 29 in the placebo group) were enrolled 
and entered in the study. 
All of the 54 subjects who entered Study 305 received at least 1 dose of the study drug. Of the 54 
treated  subjects,  41  subjects  (75.9%)  completed  the  study  (ie,  kept  administered  rufinamide  in 
Study  305  until  commercial  drug  of  rufinamide  was  prescribed)  and  13  subjects  (24.1%) 
discontinued the study.  
Primary reason for discontinuation was withdrawal of consent due to insufficient therapeutic effect 
(7  subjects),  withdrawal  of  consent  for  a  reason  other  than  insufficient  effect  (2  subjects),  and 
adverse event (4 subjects). 
Efficacy Analysis Set: 46 (23 in the rufinamide group, 23 in the placebo group), 8 subjects have no 
evaluable efficacy data. 
Safety Analysis Set: 54 (25 in the rufinamide group, 29 in the placebo group). 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics 
In  the  Efficacy  Analysis  Set  (46  subjects),  65.2%  (30  subjects)  were  males  and  34.8%  (16 
subjects)  were  females.  The  mean  age  was  15.2  years,  and  39.1%  (18  subjects)  were  younger 
than 12 years old. The mean weight was 39.45 kg, and more than 40% of the subjects were in the 
range of 15.0 to 30.0 kg. The mean duration of LGS was 10.61 years. The subjects experienced a 
median of 268.20 seizures, including 220.85 tonic-atonic seizures, per 28 days.

Assessor’s comments: 
Patients aged ≥ 4 to < 17 years were considered as the paediatric population. Taking into account 
that  the  definition  of  paediatric  population  included  children  until  18  years  old.  The  number  of 
patients  between  17  and  18  years  old  in  each  arm  should  be  provided  and  the  MAH  should 
discuss the impact of these patients in the different results. 
Tables  with  demographic  and  other  baseline  characteristics  (age,  sex,  body  weight,  duration  of 
LGS,….)  and summary of seizure frequency and type of seizure should be submitted. 
Issue resolved after further clarification was provided (see section III) 
Number of concomitant AEDs (FAS) 
Assessor’s comments: 
All  subjects  used  at  least  1  AED,  with  the  majority  in  each  group  using  3  concomitant  AEDs. 
Sodium  valproate  was  the  most  frequently  used  AED  in  both  groups.  The  next  most  frequently 
used AED was lamotrigine.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy results 
Assessor’s comments: 
The median percent changes in tonic-atonic seizure frequency relative to baseline were –39.30%, 
–40.60%, –46.80%, –47.60%, and –36.05% in Weeks 12, 24, 32, 40, and 52, respectively. 
Assessor’s comments:  
The  50%  responder  rates  in  tonic-atonic  seizure  frequency  were  43.5%,  39.5%,  47.6%,  48.8%, 
and  37.5%  in  Weeks  12,  24,  32,  40,  and  52,  respectively.  There  was  no  evidence  of  tolerance 
developing to the anticonvulsant effect of the therapy including rufinamide.

Overall assessor’s comments on efficacy:  
The MAH provided a synoptic clinical study report. Results of clinical efficacy outcome showed a 
therapeutic  benefit  of  long-term  use  of  rufinamide  in  japanese  patients  with  LGS.  Nevertheless, 
these data should be completed.  Summary of percent change in the frequency of seizures other 
than  tonic-atonic  seizures,  summary  of  aggravated  subjects  in  tonic-atonic  seizure  frequency  as 
well as subgroups analyses performed should be submitted.

Safety evaluation 
1.  Patient exposure 
The median duration of exposure to rufinamide was 818.00 days (range 13.5 to 1042.5 days), and 
70.4% (38/54 subjects) received rufinamide for 2 years or more. 
The  median  durations  of  exposure  to  rufinamide  by  treatment  group  in  Study  304  were  888.50 
days (range 139.0 to 1042.5 days) and 762.50 days (range 13.5 to 930.5 days) in rufinamide and 
placebo group, respectively.

Assessor’s comments:  
The  MAH  did  not  transmit  a  summary  of  the  number,  age  and  sex  of  the  enrolled  paediatric 
patients for study 305. All the patients included in the study 305 had completed study 304 before. 
The population is slightly older as expected. 
Of note, some demographics data were transmitted in Japanese language  and with no synthetic 
table for study 305. In the next potential PAM, all the documents should be translated in English. 
Only English language is requested.  
The MAH provided all safety analysis data into 3 categories of age: ≥4 - <12, ≥12 - <17 and ≥17. 
However paediatric population should have included all patients younger than 18 years. This data 
presentation risked to slightly underestimate the number of AEs in paediatric population. 
The MAH should provide AEs experienced by patients between 17 and 18 years old in each arms 
and discuss the impact of these patients on the safety analysis. 
Issue resolved after further clarification was provided (see section III) 
2.  Adverse events 
Table  6  presents  an  overview  of  TEAEs.  All  of  the  54  subjects  who  received  rufinamide 
experienced TEAEs, and 38 subjects (70.4%) experienced TEAEs that were considered possibly 
or probably related to administration of study drug in study 304. Severe TEAEs were reported in 3 
subjects (5.6%) and severe treatment-related TEAEs were also reported in the same subjects.

- Subject ID10021002 9 yo Male 
Treatment Group in Study 304: rufinamide 
Event (preferred term): status epilepticus (3 times) 
On  15  Dec  2010,  informed  consent  for  rufinamide  double-blind  clinical  study  (Study  304)  was 
obtained and Observation Period started. Concomitant antiepilepsy drugs included 400 mg/day of 
Selenica-R granules (sodium valproate) 40%, 140 mg/day of Excegran powder (zonisamide) 20%, 
and  70  mg/day  of  Phenobal  powder  10%.  Number  of  seizures:  tonic  seizure,  47  per  30  days; 
partial seizure, 170 per 30 days; atonic seizure, 28 per 30 days; myoclonic seizure, 7 per 30 days.  
On 12 Jan 2011, rufinamide was initiated. Number of seizures: tonic seizure, 4 per week; partial 
seizure, 18 per week; atonic seizure, 1 per week; myoclonic seizure, 1 per week. 
On  06  Apr  2011,  informed  consent  for  rufinamide  long-term  study  (Study  305)  was  obtained. 
Number of seizures: tonic seizure, 5 per  week; partial seizure, 2 per  week; atonic seizure, 2 per 
week; myoclonic seizure, 6 per week. 
The  1st  SAE  of  status  epilepticus  was  reported  on  August  2011,  8  months  after  the  start  of 
Rufinamide), recovered after treatment (midazolam). The investigator reported that the interaction 
between the study drug and the antiepilepsy drugs was believed to have increased PB (Phenobal) 
level  followed  by  decreased  VPA  (Selenica-R)  level,  resulting  in  atypical  absence  status 
epilepticus. 
The  second  SAE  of  status  epilepticus  was  reported  on  June  2012,  18  months  after  the  start  of 
rufinamide, recovered after treatment (midazolam).  According to the investigator, It was likely to 
be  caused  by  the  seasonal  reason  and  the  blood  ammonia  elevation  caused  by  VPA.  However, 
the possibility of the relationship with the study drug cannot be ruled out completely 
The  third  SAE  of  status  epilepticus  was  reported  on  March  2014,  27  months  after  the  start  of 
rufinamide. The patient was not doing well after suffering from influenza type B which appeared on 
Mar 2013, a decreased blood concentration of VPA was observed at the time of the SAE.

Listing of TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal is shown in Table 10. 
Another subject (Subject 10041009) also discontinued the study treatment in Study 305 due to an 
AE (autism); however the autism was not included in Table 10 since the event occurred in Study 
304 and did not get worse during Study 305. 
Assessor’s comments:  
The  most  frequently  reported  TAES  in  total  subjects  (during  both  studies)  were  nasopharyngitis 
(29  subjects;  53.7%),  status  epilepticus  (23  subjects;  42.6%),  and  somnolence  (18  subjects; 
33.3%).  The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-related  TEAEs  (≥10%)  in  total  subjects  were 
somnolence  (11  subjects;  20.4%),  decreased  appetite  (9  subjects;  16.7%),  status  epilepticus  (7 
subjects;  13.0%),  constipation,  and  vomiting  (6  subjects  each;  11.1%).  In  study  305  3  cases  of 
status epilepticus were reported. Status epilepticus, constipation and nasopharyngitis are listed in 
the  Eu  Smpc.  Vomiting,  somnolence  and  Status  epilepticus  are  considered  important  identified 
risks under close monitoring in the PSUR.  
No new safety concerns were emerged from this analysis.

MAH’s response 
Study  E2080-J081-305  (Study  305)  was  an  extension  study  of  Study  E2080-J081-304  (Study 
304). 
Therefore  demographic  information  was  not  newly  collected  at  the  start  of  Study  305.  Table  1 
shows  summary  of  demographic  and  other  baseline  characteristics  for  46  patients  in  Efficacy 
Analysis Set in Study 305. The paediatric population was reconsidered involving patients up to and 
including 18 years of age. There were 2 patients in the 17 and 18 years old group (both of them 
were  in  placebo  group  in  Study  304).  Table  2  shows  summary  of  seizure  frequency  during  the 
baseline phase and type of seizure in Efficacy Analysis Set in Study 305. There is no impact to the 
previous conclusion.

Assessor’s comments:  
During the Observation Period slightly higher frequency were observed in the rufinamide group for 
tonic-atonic seizures and for tonic and atonic seizure frequency. The median frequencies of partial 
seizures and atypical absence seizure were higher in the placebo group. Overall, no imbalance in 
the frequency distribution between the 2 groups were observed in the median frequency (per 28 
days) of other seizures. 
Issue resolved. 
Question 2 
Complete  results  of  primary  efficacy  outcomes  and  results  of  subgroups  analyses  performed 
should  be  submitted.  Summary  of  percent  change  in  the  frequency  of  seizures  other  than  tonic-
atonic  seizures,  summary  of  aggravated  subjects  in  tonic-atonic  seizure  frequency  as  well  as 
subgroups analyses performed should be submitted.

Assessor’s comments: 
As  observed  for  tonic-atonic  seizure,  the  median  percent  change  in  frequency  from  the 
Observation Period to the Treatment Period in the FAS for other types of seizure, the frequency 
decreased significantly in the rufinamide group compared to the placebo group.  
50% responder rate in tonic-atonic seizure frequency is higher in the rufinamide group. 
Increase in tonic-atonic seizure frequency is higher in the placebo group. 
Issue resolved. 
Safety 
The MAH should provide AEs experienced by patients between 17 and 18 years old in each arms 
and discuss the impact of these patients on the safety analysis. 
MAH’s response 
Table  5  shows  the  incidence  of  all  treatment-emergent  AEs  by  age  group.  The  paediatric 
population  was reconsidered including subjects up to 18 years of age. There is no impact to the 
previous conclusion.

IV. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
The submitted efficacy results of this study provides some evidence of the long-term efficacy of 
rufinamide in japanese patients with LGS.  
The safety data coming from assessment of the open—labelled Study 305 were consistent with 
the  known  safety  profile  of  rufinamide.  Most  frequently  reported  adverse  events  were 
comparable  to  the  most  frequent  adverse  reactions  listed  in  the  currently  approved  SmPC  for 
INOVELON.

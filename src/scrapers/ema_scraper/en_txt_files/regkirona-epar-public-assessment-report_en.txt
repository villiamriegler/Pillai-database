2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
At the end of December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of 
cases of viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020, the pathogen 
causing this atypical pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and genome sequence data were published. Since then, the virus has 
spread globally, on 30 January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern and on 11 March 2020 a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite 
unprecedented efforts to control the outbreak.  
According to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), histologic findings from the 
lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such 
as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular 
damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
As of 8 November 2021, there have been over 244 million confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
globally with approximately 5.04 million deaths resulting from infection and subsequent coronavirus 
disease (COVID-19) as registered by WHO (https://covid19.who.int/). The majority of infections result 
in asymptomatic or mild disease with full recovery.   
Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic 
respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are 
considered risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. Other risk factors include organ 
transplantation and chromosomal abnormalities.  Increasing age is another risk factor for severe 
disease and death due to COVID-19.  
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA 
segment. It is enveloped and the virions are 50–200 nanometres in diameter. Like other 
coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M 
(membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins.  
The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity 
and transmissibility in other viruses. The Spike is responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and 
fuse with the membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit catalyses attachment to the angiotensin 
converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while the S2 subunit 
facilitates fusion with the cell membrane. The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine 
development because it was shown that antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits 
an immune response that prevents infection in animals. 
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 has zoonotic origins and it has close genetic similarity to bat 
coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid-January 2020 and the virus belongs to the beta-
coronaviruses.  
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 10/11 
 
 
 
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. Transmission occurs 
primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. The median 
incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time.  
The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) presenting 
with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In addition to 
respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as myocardial 
injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring renal 
replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic stroke. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
The severity of COVID-19 disease varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no 
symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases 
typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take three to six 
weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged 
from two to eight weeks.  
The gold standard method of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is the reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test 
detects RNA but not infectious virus, its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. 
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or 
sputum sample. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The management of COVID-19 cases has developed during 2020, and includes supportive care, which 
may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.  
Treatment of hospitalised patients encompass anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone, 
targeted immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants as well as antiviral therapy (e.g. Veklury 
(EMEA/H/C/005622)), antibodies administered from convalescent plasma and hyperimmune 
immunoglobulins. These therapies have shown variable effect on the severity and duration of illness, 
with different efficacies depending on the stage of illness and manifestations of disease.  
On the other hand, in the EU there are 4 approved vaccines for active immunisation against SARS-
CoV-2 aiming to prevent COVID-19 disease, these are Comirnaty (EMEA/H/C/005735), Spikevax 
(EMEA/H/C/005791), Vaxzevria (EMEA/H/C/005675) and COVID-19 vaccine 
Janssen(EMEA/H/C/005737). 
While care for individuals with COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, there remains an 
urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics able to prevent, mitigate and treat COVID-19 infections 
during the ongoing pandemic. Especially protection of vulnerable groups and mitigating the effects of 
the pandemic on a population level are desired. In addition, some studies have shown that patients 
might experience potential sequelae, including chronic fatigue, thrombotic events post infection, non-
reversible lung disease, etc; although these aspects have not been fully determined yet.

2.2.  About the product 
Regdanvimab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced through recombinant DNA 
technology in a mammalian cell line (Chinese Hamster Ovary) that binds to the receptor binding 
domain (RBD) of the spike(s) protein of SARS-CoV-2 consequently blocking cellular entry and SARS-
CoV-2 infection. 
The recommended dosage of regdanvimab in adults is a single IV infusion of 40 mg/kg. Regdanvimab 
should be administered within 7 days of onset of symptoms of COVID-19. 
The applicant applied for the following indication “Regkirona is indicated for the treatment of adults 
with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that do not require supplemental oxygen for COVID-19 and 
who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 (see section 5.1).” 
2.3.   Quality aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion containing 60 mg/ml of 
regdanvimab (CT-P59) as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: L-histidine and L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, L-arginine, polysorbate 
80 and water for injection.  
The product is available in type I glass vial with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper. Pack size of 1 vial 
(16 ml).  
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
The active substance Regdanvimab (CT-P59) is a recombinant human monoclonal IgG1 antibody 
produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Regdanvimab is a glycoprotein with one N-linked 
glycosylation site (Asn308) in the CH2 domain of each heavy chain. Each heavy chain consists of 457 
amino acids with 11 cysteine residues, and each light chain consists of 216 amino acids with 5 cysteine 
residues. The amino acid sequences of the heavy and light chains are presented in the dossier. The 
theoretical molecular mass of the intact molecule is 145,931 g/mol.  
The proposed mechanisms of action include binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, inhibiting the interaction 
between SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Receptor Binding Domain) and the cellular receptor, ACE2, thus blocking 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data presented in the characterisation section of the dossier shows that 
Regdanvimab only mediate low levels of Fc-related activities not contributing significantly to the overall 
activity.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Regdanvimab active substance is manufactured by Celltrion Inc, Plant I (CLT1), 23, Academy-ro, 
Yeonsu-gu, Incheon, 22014, Republic of Korea. The facility is GMP compliant. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 12/13 
 
 
 
The Regdanvimab active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. The ranges 
of critical process parameters and the routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria, 
including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, are described for each step. The active substance 
is produced in a CHO cell line in a bioreactor operated in fed-batch mode. The final cell culture is 
harvested via centrifugation, followed by depth filtration and membrane filtration. The clarified 
harvests are subsequently purified by affinity chromatography and mixed mode chromatography. Viral 
inactivation and clearance are achieved by low pH and nanofiltration. Finally, the concentrated and 
diafiltered active substance is filtered into sterile bottles.  
Each active substance batch is derived from a single vial of the MCB (Master Cell Bank) and purified 
from the harvest of a single production bioreactor. The batch numbering system is described in the 
dossier. Separate flow diagrams are included for vial thaw & inoculum, seed bioreactor, production 
bioreactor, harvest & recovery, affinity chromatography, virus inactivation, mixed mode 
chromatography, viral filtration, concentration & diafiltration and final fill.  
Information on column dimensions (diameter, bed height and approximate column volumes) are given 
in the narrative process description, bed heights are also listed in the flow charts. Criteria for collection 
of the eluates and representative chromatograms for the affinity chromatography and mixed mode 
chromatography steps are presented.  
Virus filters are used at the virus filtration step. Reprocessing of the viral filtration pool, the filtration 
pool in the ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) and the final fill steps are described in separate flow 
charts. The conditions under which reprocessing can occur are listed in the dossier. It is clear that 
reprocessing is not expected to be a routine occurrence and that it only is allowed on one occasion per 
batch.  
The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable. 
Control of materials 
Sufficiently detailed information has been provided for source, history and generation of the cell 
substrate. Acceptable information has been provided for the characterisation of the MCB and cells at 
the limit of in vitro cell age.  
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted.  Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw materials are presented. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the Regdanvimab active substance manufacturing process is given. Acceptable information 
has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the active substance 
manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational parameters and in-
process tests. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. 
The approach taken in development of the active substance control strategy, including establishment 
of QTPP (Quality Target Product Profile), CQAs (Critical Quality Attributes) and CPPs (Critical Process 
Parameters) is described in the dossier.  
The established CPPs for the active substance manufacturing process are supported by risk 
assessment, development studies and/or historical production data. The justification for the CPPs and 
their acceptance criteria are acceptable described.  
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021

In-process tests (CIPTs and IPTs) are listed with defined ranges in the dossier. It is noted that there 
are additional process variables defined for monitoring (MPs and IPMs) but for these no defined ranges 
are included in the dossier. This is found acceptable.  
Process hold times and storage conditions are defined for process hold points in the commercial active 
substance manufacturing process. 
Process validation 
The Regdanvimab active substance manufacturing process has been validated adequately. Consistency 
in production has been shown on 10 full scale commercial batches. The process validation of the 
manufacturing steps (at manufacturing scale) for active substance is adequately described and 
reported.  
The process validation was performed at commercial scale, and the validation strategy was designed to 
incorporate active substance generated from all bioreactor trains. Several harvest cell culture fluid 
batches were produced purified and filled as a single active substance batch. There were some 
deviations in the validation runs, these are described and acceptably justified by the Applicant. Batch 
analysis results met the release specification. 
An historical data assessment was made after process validation, based on an in-house risk 
assessment tool. The re-assessment resulted in re-classification of process variables and adjusted 
operating range and acceptance criteria for the CPPs and CIPTs. It is also stated that this kind of re-
assessment activity may be incorporated in future exercises to improve process control upon 
accumulation of further knowledge.  
Removal of impurities 
A scale-down downstream process has been used to investigate clearance of process-related impurities 
The data demonstrate that the impurities were removed predominantly by the chromatography step. 
Acceptable removal capacity has been demonstrated.  
Furthermore, product-related impurities, process-related impurities (HCP, DNA, rProtein A) and safety 
tests (endotoxin and bioburden) are routinely controlled by the active substance specification. The 
capacity to clear antifoam has been acceptably demonstrated.  
Resin and membrane lifetime and sanitization studies 
Scale-down resin lifetime study and the scale-down carry-over study for chromatography resins have 
been completed and the results are provided in the dossier. The target maximum number of cycles for 
the TFF membrane was determined.  
Hold times 
Process hold time studies were performed with in-process samples held in the representative small-
scale vessels, both microbial and biochemical stability was demonstrated. The validated hold times are 
considered supportive of the hold times proposed.  
Reprocessing 
Reprocessing validations have been performed at laboratory scale and protocols for reprocessing at 
commercial scale has been provided. The conditions under which reprocessing can occur are listed in 
the dossier. 
Freeze-Thaw Studies 
Freeze and thaw studies was conducted with a bracketing approach for bottle size. Acceptable test 
results are presented after freeze-thaw cycles and the thawing times was determined.  
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 14/15 
 
 
 
Shipping validation 
Results from shipping validation studies performed in the same bottles as used for active substance 
storage are presented in the dossier. Bottles filled with water are claimed to be representative of 
bottles filled with the same amount of active substance. This found acceptable for a frozen solution.  
Manufacturing process development 
Three different processes have been used throughout development. Process A was used for non-clinical 
studies, process B for non-clinical studies and initial clinical trials and finally process C, the commercial 
process was used for production of DP for later stage of clinical trials. Comparability assessments were 
conducted between Process A and Process B batches and between Process B and Process C batches, 
and the results are provided in the dossier.  
Comparability studies were performed with Process A active substance and Process B active substance 
and with Process B active substance an Process C active substance.  
Characterisation 
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics 
A comprehensive physicochemical and biological characterisation of the active substance Regdanvimab 
is presented. Several batches of active substance manufactured at scale in a production bioreactor and 
several lots of finished product were included in the studies.  
An extensive panel of orthogonal state-of-the-art tests were applied. Studies of primary and higher 
order structure, post-translational modifications, charge variants, glycosylation and biological activity 
were included.  
Several different binding ELISA methods as well SPR (Surface plasmon resonance) methods have been 
used in the characterisation studies. Results are presented including dose-response curves and 
sensorgrams.  
The results show that the maximum cytotoxicity of Regdanvimab was less than 15%, that is a very low 
level in comparison to other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies where the major mechanism of action 
is via ADCC activity. Moreover, no significant differences were observed between process 2 and 
process 3 material, supporting comparability between material from the two processes, despite slight 
differences in the afucosylation level. It should be noted that it is expected that this new ADCC format, 
with more reliable results, will be included in future comparability studies that may be needed in 
connection with future changes to the active substance manufacturing process.  
In conclusion, it is agreed that ADCC is not contributing significantly to the overall activity of 
Regdanvimab.  
Results are presented showing that the in vitro Plaque Reduction Neutralisation Test (PRNT) and SARS-
CoV-2 RBD binding (ELISA) correlate with each other. This supports the suitability of the binding ELISA 
as the potency assay for release testing.  
Impurities 
The product-related impurities include charge variants, high molecular weight (HMW) species, antibody 
fragments, oxidised variants and some glycan variants. Results presented from batch analysis confirm 
efficient removal of these product-related impurities.  
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 15/16 
 
 
 
 
 
The major process-related impurities are controlled at active substance release and batch analysis data 
are presented.  
Reports covering risk assessments of the presence of nitrosamine for the active substance and active 
product have been provided as annexes to Module 1. The Applicant concludes that there is no risk of 
nitrosamine impurities in neither active substance nor finished product. 
Specification 
Specifications with acceptance criteria are set in accordance with ICH Q6B and include control of 
identity, glycosylation, purity and impurities, concentration, potency, and general safety tests.  
The acceptance criteria are set based on clinical and commercial active substance batch data. Overall, 
the active substance specification are found adequate to control the quality of Regkirona.  
The proposed acceptance criteria for the general tests are found approvable. The limits for the specific 
tests for glycosylation, purity and impurity and potency are acceptably justified and also supported by 
results from comparability and characterisation studies.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.  
Potency testing measures SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding has been implemented. The test panel chosen is a 
combination of compendial and non-compendial methods. For compendial test methods reference is 
given to the relevant pharmacopeial. For the non-compendial methods the reference is given to the 
SOPs. 
Several of the non-compendial analytical procedures described are used for testing of both active 
substance and finished product. The non-compendial analytical procedures are at large acceptable 
described, including information on acceptance criteria for system suitability testing.  
Validation summaries are provided for all non-compendial methods confirming their suitability.   
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for several batches at commercial scale of the active substance were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. 
Batch analysis data are presented for all batches used for non-clinical and clinical studies, as well as 
batches produced during validation of the active substance manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
Adequate information on the in-house reference standards used during development as well as current 
proposed primary reference standard is provided. The results from qualification of primary reference 
standard are provided and found acceptable. The working reference standard will be established using 
CT-P59 active substance which meets the release specification. Appropriate specification for 
requalification of the primary reference standard and working reference standard is in place.  
Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substance is sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
shelf life in the proposed container. The proposed shelf life of Regkirona actives substance when stored 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 16/17 
 
 
 
 
at the recommended conditions is based on long-term stability data. Stability studies have been 
conducted in line with ICH Q5C and ICH Q1B guideline and the results demonstrate that active 
substance is stable under the recommended conditions. Supporting information on intermediate, 
accelerated and stress stability and from photo-stability data have been provided 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development  
Regkirona finished product is presented as a concentrate for solution for infusion in a 20-ml Type I 
borosilicate glass vial intended to deliver 960 mg of antibody per 16 ml at a concentration of 
60 mg/ml. Prior to administration the finished product should be diluted using 0.9% (w/v) sodium 
chloride. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Besides the active substance, regdanvimab, the finished product solution of Regkirona contains L-
histidine, L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, L-arginine, polysorbate 80 and water for injection. 
The finished product contains no excipients of human or animal origin. The excipients L-histidine and L-
histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, L-arginine, polysorbate 80 (stabilising agent) and water for 
injection are compliant with Ph. Eur standards and commonly used for the formulation of 
biopharmaceuticals. 
Formulation development 
The formulation development has been acceptably addressed and the chosen formulation sufficiently 
justified. There is no overage of active substance or excipient, only overfill which has been acceptably 
justified.  
Manufacturing process development  
The manufacturing process history is clearly described including information on the differences in 
manufacture between different Active product Processes.  
Extensive comparability study between the commercial process and the process used in clinical studies 
was shown using additional physicochemical and biological characterisation studies and results were 
comparable.   
In conclusion, the manufacturing process development is found acceptably addressed.  
Container closure system 
The evaluation of the suitability of the primary package materials is acceptably described. The primary 
packaging materials (a 20-ml glass type I vials and Fluro-Tec coated chlorobutyl rubber closures) 
comply with the compendial requirements of the Ph. Eur. The results from the extractables assessment 
support the compatibility of CT-P59 finished product with primary container closure system. 
Furthermore, available results from the on-going leachable study are provided which until now has not 
identified leachables present at levels of toxicological concern. For the unknown compound detected 
during the on-going leachable study the outcome of the identification as well as the toxicology 
evaluation should be provided when data is available. Although no safety concern is expected 
considering that the primary packaging is not new or unique for this kind of products, any potential 
risk to patient safety should be carefully addressed and proposed actions to be taken presented.  
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 17/18 
 
 
 
 
(Recommendation) 
The photostability of CT-P59 finished product in its secondary packaging has been acceptably 
demonstrated. Furthermore, the container closure integrity has been verified based on vacuum decay 
test.  
Compatibility 
Prior to administration the finished product should diluted using 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride in an 
infusion bag. Satisfactory compatibility for the finished product when diluted in saline has been 
demonstrated for the proposed in-use period. Furthermore, the compatibility of the finished product 
with the infusion bag in relation to leachables has been studied as well. The presence of leachables was 
evaluated at pre-defined time points. The results demonstrate that there are no leachable present at 
levels of toxicological concern. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process has been validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process controls are adequate.  
Manufacture 
The manufacturing process and process controls are acceptably described and summarized in separate 
flow-charts for the manufacturing sites. The manufacturing process for the finished product consists of 
formulation, filtration, aseptic filling, capping and visual inspection. Standard aseptic processing 
techniques are used for the manufacturing of the finished product.  
Information on applied transport conditions for the transport of filled vials to the site responsible for 
the secondary packaging is presented and acceptably justified by transport validation data. Information 
on the conditions for sterilization of the vials and stoppers is found acceptable and performed in 
accordance with standard conditions using validated procedures.  
No reprocessing of finished product has been described in the dossier.  
Operating parameter or performance parameter are given for the different steps if applicable and 
process parameters (CPP)/critical operating parameters (COP) and critical in process tests 
(CIPT)/performance parameters (CPP) are clearly identified. Although confusing using different 
definitions of the control parameters/tests for the two sites the controls as such are found adequate 
and acceptably described.  
Process controls 
The chosen approach and development of the control strategy is in general acceptably described. The 
CQAs of relevance for the finished product manufacture are defined and discussed in this section. The 
CQA s are controlled during the manufacturing process at the finished product manufacturing site A 
through critical process parameters (CPPs) and the results are monitored by critical in-process test 
(CIPT). Similar approach is used at the finished product manufacturing site B but using different terms 
due to facility policies; critical operating parameters (COPs) and the results are monitored by critical 
performance parameters (CPPs).  
The acceptance criteria for the CIPTs and IPTs at manufacturing site A were established through 
process development, historical production data and/or process validation data. Information to define 
Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) and justify the acceptance criteria is limited. However, results from 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 18/19 
 
 
 
 
the study to confirm the stability with various ranges of stabiliser and surfactant, is found to acceptably 
justify the proposed range of the stabiliser and surfactant.  
For the manufacturing process at manufacturing site B, the pre-existing risk assessment tool for 
ranking of parameter criticality and definition of process variables in place are followed. Also, the 
existing system for deviation/investigation is used and it is claimed that the control strategy for CT-P59 
finished product manufacture at manufacturing site B differs from that of manufacturing site A. Despite 
the different nomenclature used at the two sites, it has been acceptably addressed that the same basic 
principles apply for the two control strategies which will result in the same actions and evaluations in 
case of deviations of concern for the quality and safety for the final product.  
Process variables (input and output variables) have been classified as critical or non-critical based on 
an in-house risk assessment tool described in the dossier. 
Process and hold times have been acceptably defined and justified. 
Process validation/verification 
The process validation followed a traditional approach and covered several consecutive production 
scale batches for each site. The ability to meet acceptance criteria for IPCs, finished product 
specification as well as additional acceptance criteria for non-routine tests was conducted. 
In conclusion, the results from the several production scale batches at each site verify compliance with 
the acceptance criteria. All results comply with the acceptance criteria and the proposed final products 
specification. It can be concluded that the finished product can be consistently manufactured at each 
proposed commercial production site within the defined processing time and holding times. 
Product specification  
Specifications 
The specification has been generated taking into account ICH Q6B Specifications: Test Procedures and 
Acceptance Criteria for Biotechnological/Biological Products with the relevant monographs of the 
European Pharmacopoeia and United States Pharmacopeia. 
Justification of specification 
The applicant includes a suitable set of specifications for the finished product including appropriate 
physicochemical tests and tests for identity, purity and potency. Each chosen test parameter as well as 
proposed acceptance criteria has been discussed. The acceptance criteria and specification ranges are 
deemed acceptably justified.  
Impurities  
The Applicant concludes that no additional impurities are detected in the finished product compared to 
the active substance. For elemental impurities a summary of the risk assessment in accordance with 
ICH Q3D and results from the elemental impurity study are provided for both manufacturing sites. The 
results from the study demonstrates a low risk from elemental impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
However, updated data from the on-going leachable study on the glass vial and rubber stopper 
remains to be provided when data is available as given by the Recommendation.  
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 19/20 
 
 
 
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control 
measures are deemed necessary.  
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.    
The test panel chosen is a combination of compendial and non-compendial methods. For compendial 
test methods reference is given to the relevant pharmacopeial. For the non-compendial methods the 
same methods are used as for the active substance and reference is given to the SOPs. The validation 
and demonstrating of the suitability of the test methods was performed using active substance 
samples. This approach is acceptable considering the identical composition for active substance and 
finished product.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data of the finished product for each manufacturing process including non-clinical, 
clinical, commercial process were provided. The results comply well with the acceptance criteria and 
demonstrate in general an acceptable batch to batch consistency although differences between the 
different processes can be observed for some of the purity test attributes 
Reference materials 
The same reference standards as for Regdanvimab active substances is used. 
Stability of the product 
Data have been provided on finished product stability studies performed at the real time/real condition, 
at the accelerated storage condition, and at the stress storage condition. The studies are performed in 
accordance with ICH Q5C Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products.  
The stability specifications are identical to the release specification except for certain tests. The 
accelerated and stress studies are partially completed. To study the stability profile over time, trend 
analyses have been performed for the parameters that have been identified to be stability-indicating. 
No noticeable differences in trends could be observed in finished product. The proposed shelf-life of 12 
months when stored at 5 ± 3ºC is therefore found acceptably justified.  
In addition, drug product was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. The photostability study verifies the need for the protection 
from light and that the finished product marketing pack is effective in protecting the Regkirona from 
light exposure.  
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 20/21 
 
 
 
In conclusion, the proposed finished product shelf life is supported by the data presented. 
Adventitious agents 
Sufficiently detailed information has been provided from the TSE risk assessment. Results from viral 
testing of the MCBs and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age have been provided. The test panels are in 
line with requirements in ICH Q5A. No adventitious virus was detected, only retrovirus like particles as 
expected for CHO cells.  
Viral testing results including MVM and in vitro testing data from unprocessed bulk are provided. No 
adventitious virus was detected.  
A summary of data from virus clearance studies is provided. In addition, full study reports for the virus 
studies have also been provided. Worst case settings are used for parameters known or expected to 
affect virus reduction. Relevant model viruses have been used. The results demonstrate that several 
steps in the process is able to effectively reduce potential virus contamination of a broad spectrum of 
virus as requested in ICH Q5A.  Virus clearance studies for chromatography steps have been 
performed with both new and aged resins.  
Satisfactory information has been provided demonstrating that sufficient measures are in place to 
ensure safety with regards to a broad spectrum of virus. 
GMO 
Not applicable. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The active substance Regdanvimab is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Characterisation 
of Regdanvimab was performed using an extensive panel of appropriate methods. Data presented 
shows that Regdanvimab only mediate low levels of Fc-related activities not contributing significantly 
to the overall activity.  
Differences between the three versions of the manufacturing process used during development are 
clearly described and comparability has been demonstrated. The information on manufacture of the 
active substance is found acceptable. 
The information on development and manufacture of the finished product has been presented in a 
satisfactory way. The comparability studies verify acceptable comparability between the different 
processes used in development and between the two commercial manufacturing sites. The results of 
tests carried out verify that the Finished Product is manufactured in a validated and well-controlled 
process. 
The control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory way. 
The stability results support the proposed shelf life of 12 months at 5 ± 3ºC for the finished product.   
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to the leachable studies. This point is put forward and 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 21/22 
 
 
 
agreed as recommendations for future quality development (See 2.3.6. Recommendation for future 
quality development).  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.6.  Recommendation for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- For the unknown compound detected during the on-going leachable study the outcome of the 
identification as well as the toxicology evaluation should be provided before end of Q1 2022. Any 
identified risk to patient safety should be carefully addressed and proposed actions to be taken 
presented. 
2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Pharmacology 
The non-clinical pharmacology section only covers the assessment of pharmacological in-vivo studies. 
For pharmacological in-vitro study assessment, see the clinical section (section “clinical 
pharmacology”). The active substance in Regkirona is the monoclonal IgG1 antibody regdanvimab 
(experimental name: CT-P59) which targets the non-endogenous epitope of the RBD domain of the 
spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 (a protein that is not produced by mammalian cells). The stipulated 
pharmacological mechanism of action of regdanvimab is the blocking of the binding between SARS-
CoV-2 RBD and the cellular receptor, ACE2, thereby reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection. CT-P59 does not 
seem to promote removal of infected cells via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
2.4.1.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In-vivo studies 
The pharmacological in-vivo studies were conducted in transgenic mice (human angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 [hACE2] expressing) and a set of un-modified animal models (hamster, ferret and rhesus 
macaque). SARS-CoV-2 is known to enter mammalian (inclusive human) cells via the cell membrane 
attached ACE2 protein. Ferret and rhesus macaque have been shown to be very similar to human ACE2 
with regard to SARS-CoV-2 interactions. The properties of hamster ACE2 are less clear but Syrian 
hamsters have been reported to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection developing moderate 
interstitial pneumonia leading to transient mild to moderate disease.  
The primary pharmacodynamic studies covered the following studies: 
• 
Prophylactic efficacy study in hACE2 expressing TG mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection (GR2-
RD-20-251).

20-253).  
Therapeutic Efficacy Study in Ferrets against SARS-CoV-2 Infection (ID-2020-Celltrion-03) 
Therapeutic efficacy study in ferret against South African variant and wild type of SARS-CoV-2 
(GR2-RD-21-108). See also clinical pharmacology. 
Therapeutic Efficacy Study in Rhesus Monkeys against SARS-CoV-2 Infection (GR2-RD-20-249) 
The prophylactic activity of regdanvimab against wt SARS-CoV-2 infection was also studied in the 
hACE2 mouse model. Female mice treated with between 0.1 and 10mg/kg regdanvimab (i.p., single 
administration) one day before infection (1 x 105 PFU/50μL, intranasal) died at all doses before 6-days 
post infection (dpi; 2/6 animals survived at 0.1 and 1.0mg/kg and 3/6 animals survived at 10mg/kg; 
compared to 1/5 non-treated animals). There was body weight reduction from ~2-3dpi with non-
treated and 0.1mg/kg animals showing a ~25-30% reduction at 6dpi and 1 and 10mg/kg animals 
showing 3-11% reduction. The viral replication in non-treated animal lungs and nasal swabs topped at 
3dpi and decreased at 6dpi. Regdanvimab decreased viral titres relative to those in control animals 
(statistically significant decrease for 1 and 10mg/kg at 3dpi in lungs and for 10mg/kg in 6dpi nasal 
swabs) and, only a trend of reduction at best for 1 and 10mg/kg at 6dpi). The data indicates that there 
were some ameliorating effects from prophylactic treatment but that these effects were primarily on 
reducing the viral load in lungs (on 3dpi and not on 6dpi) and modest at best on therapeutic outcomes 
(i.e., 50% survival at the highest dose of 10mg/kg).   
Post-infection treatment (starting 8h after infection) of wildtype (wt) SARS-CoV-2 and variants of 
concern (VOC) has been conducted in hACE2 mice (B.6Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J). Observation 
duration were between 3- and 6-days post infection (dpi). Wt-virus infected mice (1x104 PFU in 50μL, 
n=8 per group) were treated with CT-P59 8h after infection (5 and 20mg/kg i.p.) and observed until 6 
dpi (necropsy on 4 animals on 3dpi and 6dpi respectively). Control group was a viral 
infection+formulation group that had their mean body weights decreased up to 18.7% while treated 
animals had a weight reduction less than 10%. Viral titres were non-measurable in lungs at 20mg/kg 
on 6dpi but near control levels form some animals at 5mg/kg. Viral levels were generally reduced but 
measurable at all doses on 3dpi. This profile was also seen for nasal wash viral levels. See Clinical 
Pharmacology for further details on the VOC studies. 
Besides hACE2 mice, the post-infection treatment effectivity of regdanvimab was also characterized in 
naïve golden Syrian Golden hamster, ferret, and Rhesus macaque animals.  
In Hamster, treatment (15, 30, 60 and 90mg/kg, i.p.) was on 1dpi and the animals were observed 
until 5dpi. No animal - treated or non-treated - died from infection. All animals lost body weight (-4% 
to -10%) with no statistically significant difference between treatment and control groups. Based on 
qRT-PCR and TCID50 (lung only) assay measurements, the viral replication in lungs and nasal turbines 
was reduced (statistically significant effects) on 2-3dpi (≥60mg/kg based on qRT-PCR, ≥15mg/kg base 
on TCID50 assay) and 5dpi (≥30mg/kg based on qRT-PCR, ≥15mg/kg base on TCID50 assay). Overall, 
the animals did not demonstrate any significant therapeutic effects (on body weight reduction) but did 
reduce the viral loads in lungs and nasal turbines.  
In ferrets, treatment (3 and 30mg/kg, i.v., bolus) was on 1dpi and the animal were observed until 
7dpi. Infection symptoms (coughing, nasal discharge, reduced activity) peaked in controls at 2-4dpi 
and then became weaker but still visible at 7dpi. Treatment reduced the viral titres in nasal and lung 
samples at 3 and 30mg/kg and also reduced clinical symptoms moderately with no observable 
symptoms seen at 7dpi (most clearly at 30mg/kg). There were indications that regdanvimab reduced

EMA/679271/2021  
Page 23/24 
 
 
 
inflammation in ferret lung tissue, but the study is too small and lacking for any strong conclusion on 
this aspect. 
For the rhesus macaque study (treatment at 1dpi with 45 or 90mg/kg i.v., observation until 6dpi), the 
infection was induced via multiple routes at once (intratracheal, intranasal, oral, ocular). There was no 
difference in clinical symptoms, body weight and haematology between non-treated and treaded 
animals. There was a strong effect on viral titres from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs: the 
presence of viruses could only be detected between 1dpi and 2dpi (whereas control animals had a peak 
between 1-3 dpi and then showed gradual reduction until 6dpi).  
The activity of regdanvimab in animal models infected with VOC’s is discussed in the section on Clinical 
Pharmacology.  
2.4.1.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In-vivo studies 
To investigate the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a study with 24h pre-
infection treatment (between 0.001mg/kg and 1mg/kg regdanvimab) in hACE2 transgenic mice 
(B.6Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J) was conducted (study code GR2-RD-20-314). There were no 
differences in lung viral titres at doses below 1mg/kg and down to 0.001mg/kg (as compared to 
controls), but it is impossible to conclude if this absence of titre difference at lower doses negates the 
possibility of ADE.   
Next generation sequencing of the gene for the spike protein in hamster and Rhesus macaque samples 
(from primary pharmacodynamics studies, study code GR2-RD-20-356) did not detect any CT-P59 
treatment-emergent specific mutations within or close to the epitope that CT-P59 binds to. In Rhesus 
macaque, there was a shift in frequency of amino-substitution variants due to treatment (compared to 
with before treatment) which may be due to genetic drift. This indicates that the likelihood of 
generating viral resistance via CT-P59 treatment in-vivo is low (at least in hamster and macaque). 
Tissue cross-reactivity (TCR) studies were conducted on human (adult, foetal and neonatal) and 
cynomolgus (adult) tissues (study codes: 20251203 and 20265175). Regdanvimab showed specific 
positive staining in meningeal arachnoid cap cells in the brain and spinal cord in tissues derived from 
human (adult and neonatal) and the cynomolgus monkey (adult).  
2.4.1.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacology was integrated into a 2-week repeat-dose toxicity test and a 3-week repeat-
dose toxicity study with a 10-week recovery period. The endpoints included clinical observations for 
any unexpected events with central nervous system and respiratory behaviour, and 
electrocardiography (ECG) for the cardiovascular system (see Toxicology section). 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Measurement of CT-P59 concentration have been conducted using ELISA and 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL; the latter only in toxicokinetic studies). Only one dedicated non-
clinical pharmacokinetics study has been conducted and submitted (ELISA measurement of CT-P59 in 
Hamster serum, GR2-RD-20-250).  
Male golden Syrian hamsters exposed to a single IP injection of CT-P59 at doses between 15 and 
60mg/kg had blood samples collected between 0.5 and 504 hours after administration of each dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 24/25 
 
 
 
The concentrations of CT-P59 were measured in serum via ELISA (calibration range between 
0.078ng/mL and 10ng/mL). CT-P59 was detectable in all exposed animals up to 504 hours post-dose. 
The mean Cmax and AUC0-504h values increased in a generally dose proportional manner for CT-P59. 
The mean Cmax was 86 (15mg/kg), 158 (30mg/kg), and 409μg/mL (60mg/kg) whereas the mean 
AUC0-504h was 14056 (15mg/kg), 35804 (30mg/kg) and 62128 (60mg/kg) μg x h/mL. The values are 
based on male animals (a preliminary study with males and females did not detect clear sex-
differences). The mean half-life (t1/2) of CT-P59 was 64h (15mg/kg), 121h (30mg/kg), and 153h 
(60mg/kg). Additional PK (toxicokinetics) measurements were conducted in repeat-dose toxicity 
studies (see Toxicology). No specific non-clinical pharmacokinetic distribution, metabolism or excretion 
studies shave been conducted for CT-P59. The degradation of CT-P59 to individual amino acids will be 
added to the general amino acid pool, excess of which will be excreted through renal and hepatic 
mechanisms. 
2.4.3.  Toxicology 
2.4.3.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose toxicity study was performed. 
2.4.3.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Two repeat-dose toxicity studies, 2-and 3-week long, were conducted in the cynomolgus monkey using 
intravenous administration of regdanvimab at dose levels of 0, 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg once weekly.  
In the 2-week repeat-dose toxicity study (G220016) in the cynomolgus test item-related findings were 
observed in one male only at the highest dose of 400 mg/kg. In clinical pathology, increased C-
reactive protein (CRP) level, decrease of albumin to globulin (A/G) ratio and increased large unstained 
cell counts were observed. In microscopic examination, minimal sinusoidal increased cell of the liver 
and increased cellularity of the bone marrow were noted. These findings were considered CT-P59-
related but not adverse since these were noted only in one male and they were not accompanied by 
degenerative changes. There was thymic atrophy in the microscopic findings which was associated with 
the decreased size and weight of the thymus and considered to be secondary changes caused by body 
weight loss or stress.  Decreased albumin level was also considered to be a secondary change caused 
by decreased food consumption and body weight. In addition, decrease in red blood cell parameters, 
prolonged prothrombin time, macroscopic increased size and increased weights of the kidneys and liver 
were observed. These changes were considered not adverse, but it was unclear whether the changes 
were related to CT-P59 since the changes were minimal and there were no microscopic correlates. 
Based on the results, the NOAEL was considered to be 400 mg/kg/week in both sexes under this study 
condition. 
In the 3-week repeat-dose toxicity (20251637) study in the cynomolgus there were no CT-P59-related 
effects in the following parameters: clinical observations, food consumption, body weights, 
ophthalmology examinations, electrocardiograms, urinalysis parameters, organ weights, macroscopic 
or microscopic findings. 
CT-P59-related changes were observed in haematology parameters consisting of moderately to 
markedly decreased neutrophils associated with decreased white blood cell counts in some individual 
animals at all dose levels Days 8, 15, and/or 22. Among them, 3 animals had mildly to markedly 
increased monocytes and/or lymphocytes on Days 8 and/or 15. Monocyte and lymphocyte values 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 25/26 
 
 
 
generally recovered by Day 22. During a 10-week recovery period, there were no CT-P59-related 
changes in haematology parameters at 400 mg/kg/dose, indicating complete recovery.  
CT-P59-related changes in coagulation and clinical chemistry parameters consisted of an acute phase 
response for several males and females at 100 or 200 mg/kg/dose that included minimally to markedly 
increased fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and/or globulins, and mildly decreased albumin and 
albumin/globulin ratio on Days 8 and/or 15 with recovery on Day 22 except for globulins in one animal 
each in the 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg dose groups. 
Additionally, there were CT-P59-related changes for two animals at 400 mg/kg/dose on Days 8, 15, 
and/or 22 that were not observed for other animals including moderate to marked decrease in 
neutrophils with other changes in clinical pathology parameters; WBC counts, monocytes, red blood 
cell mass, reticultocytes, red cell distribution width, plateletcrit, platelet distribution width, prolonged 
activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, CRP, globulins, triglycerides, total bilirubin, A/G ratio, 
cholesterol, and/or calcium with no microscopic correlates. All changes were recovered following 10-
week recovery period, indicating complete recovery. These observations were considered of no clinical 
relevance.  
The markedly decreased neutrophil count, though fully reversible, were considered adverse based on 
the inherent related increased risk for infections rather than a direct high toxic effect and the NOAEL 
was considered to be 200 mg/kg/week. 
No remarkable findings were reported from the macroscopic and microscopic examination of injection 
sites from all animals from both studies. 
Systemic exposures of CT-P59 generally increased in a dose proportional manner. Mean Cmax values 
were 2800, 5570 and 9240 μg/mL in males, and 3090, 5370, and 10000 μg/mL in females at doses of 
100, 200 and 400 mg/kg on Day 15, respectively. Mean AUC0-168h was 160000, 308000 and 454000 
μg*hr/mL in males and 192000, 280000 and 535000 μg*hr/mL in females at doses of 100, 200 and 
400 mg/kg on Day 15, respectively. Following repeated administration, no notable accumulation was 
observed on Day 15 compared to Day 1 (< 2 fold), with individual accumulation ratios ranging from 
1.03 to 1.93 across the dose levels. 
The applicant has presented exposure margins based on the exposure in patients (CT-P59 1.2) which 
has full data (up to Day 90) based on the recommended clinical single dosage for CT-P59 of 40 mg/kg 
and the lowest NOAEL from the non-clinical study with the highest number of 3 overall CT-P59 
administrations and duration of 3 weeks. The exposure margins are approximately 4.5 and 5.6 based 
on AUC and Cmax, respectively. 
2.4.3.3.  Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity study was not conducted. This is in accordance with the ICH Safety Guideline S6(R1) 
Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (ICH, 2011), as it is not 
expected to have genotoxic potential. 
2.4.3.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity study was not conducted with CT-P59. This is in accordance with the ICH Safety 
Guideline S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals (ICH, 2011), 
as it is not expected to have carcinogenic potential. 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 26/27 
 
 
 
2.4.3.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were not conducted with CT-P59. This is in 
accordance with the ICH Safety Guideline S6(R1) Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-
Derived Pharmaceuticals (ICH, 2011), since these types of antibodies are unlikely to cause 
reproductive or developmental toxicity. 
2.4.3.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Local tolerance at the injection site was assessed as part of the repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
2.4.3.7.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance at the injection site was assessed as part of the repeat-dose toxicity studies. No 
remarkable findings were observed from the macro- and microscopic examination of injection sites 
from all animals. 
2.4.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100 Corr 2), due to their nature monoclonal antibodies which 
are classified as proteins are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, 
environmental risk assessment studies are not provided in this Application for Marketing Authorisation, 
which is considered acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Primary pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacological in-vivo studies demonstrated that regdanvimab is reasonably effective in 
reducing virus levels in various sampling locations - including lungs – if treatment is given 24h after 
infection. It should be noted that many of the studies were not designed (e.g., strength of infection, 
length of study) to let the animals develop strong infection symptoms (for instance in the hamster). As 
a result, the positive effects on the clinical symptoms in the different animal models remains unclear. 
The ferret study indicated that regdanvimab had positive effects both on general symptoms (e.g., 
coughs) and lung inflammation, but this study is not strong enough in its setup to support any strong 
conclusions - especially for the lung inflammation effects.  
Secondary pharmacology 
The in-vivo ADE study in hACE2 mouse was inconclusive. It can be noted that CT-P59 did not induced 
any ADE effect in in-vitro studies where SARS-CoV-2 were incubated with both permissive cells 
(VeroE6 cells) and Fc-bearing cells (Raji cells; FcγR II, U937 cells; FcγR I & II) in the presence of CT-
P59. As a result, the ADE issue remains uncertain. 
Tissue cross-reactivity (TCR) studies showed specific positive staining in meningeal arachnoid cap cells 
in the brain and spinal cord in tissues derived from human (adult and neonatal) and the cynomolgus 
monkey (adult). This location was not associated with any histopathology findings in the two adult 
cynomolgus 2 and 3-week long repeat-dose toxicity studies (see also Toxicology). There a number of 
other tissues stained but those findings were in endothelial cells (which are likely to have poor integrity 
in cryosection studies and therefore not relevant for antibody binding in-vivo) and in the cytoplasm of 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 27/28 
 
 
 
cells in a number of other types of tissues and cells (also generally considered non-relevant due to 
poor in-vivo access). Sequencing data from Hamster and Rhesus macaque samples do no indicate that 
CT-P59 treatment generates novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with amino acid changes in the antibody-
binding region.  
Toxicology 
Two repeat-dose toxicity studies, 2-and 3-week long, were conducted in the cynomolgus monkey using 
intravenous administration of regdanvimab at dose levels of 0, 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg once weekly.  
In the 2-week study with IV infusion of regdanvimab once weekly there were no regdanvimab-related 
toxicological changes in mortality, clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmology, ECG, 
haematology, coagulation, urinalysis, organ weights, macroscopic and microscopic observations at up 
to 400 mg/kg. Under the conditions of the study, the NOAEL was concluded to be 400 mg/kg. 
In the 3-week study all animals survived for the study duration, and test article-related effects 
included changes in haematology, coagulation, and clinical chemistry parameters.  In addition to 
moderately to markedly decreased neutrophils other changes in clinical pathology parameters were 
observed in two of the high dose animals (WBC counts, monocytes, red blood cell mass, reticultocytes, 
red cell distribution width, plateletcrit, platelet distribution width, prolonged activated partial 
thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, CRP, globulins, triglycerides, total bilirubin, A/G ratio, cholesterol, 
and/or calcium). These observations were considered of no clinical relevance. The markedly decreased 
neutrophils were deemed adverse based on increased risk for infection and the NOAEL was considered 
to be 200 mg/kg. The exposure margins are approximately 4.5 and 5.6 based on AUC and Cmax, 
respectively. Immunogenicity is discussed in the clinical section. 
The lack of stand-alone local tolerance studies is endorsed. No specific injection site findings have been 
noted in the two repeat-dose toxicity studies performed with IV CT-P59.  
No genotoxicity-, carcinogenicity- and DART studies have been conducted in line with ICH S6 guidance. 
2.4.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical programme indicated that regdanvimab has a viral level reducing effect in 
animal models and is well tolerated. Toxicological findings were limited to changes in haematology, 
coagulation, and clinical chemistry parameters in high dose animals.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Regdanvimab is a human monoclonal IgG1 antibody with a molecular weight 145.9 kDa.  
The drug product CT-P59 (Regkirona) is intended for single dose treatment in adults. The proposed 
therapeutic dose is 40 mg/kg administered as a single intravenous infusion over 60 minutes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 31/32 
 
 
 
 
The pharmacokinetics of regdanvimab was assessed in all three submitted clinical studies using rich 
sampling schedules. No interaction studies, metabolism and excretion studies or dedicated studies in 
special populations were performed. 
Methods 
Analytical methods 
For PK assessments, regdanvimab serum concentrations were quantitatively measured using a ligand-
binding assay utilising MSD ECL platform. Biotinylated RBD and sulfo-tag labelled RBD were used as 
capture and detection reagents respectively, to measure the serum concentration of regdanvimab.  
Immunogenicity testing followed a multi-tiered assay approach: (1) screening, (2) confirmation and 
(3) characterisation in terms of titration and neutralisation activity. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against regdanvimab were determined using MSD ECL platform with 
Affinity Capture Elution (ACE) step. Biotinylated regdanvimab and sulfo-tag labelled regdanvimab were 
used as capture and detection reagents, respectively. Polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibody derived from 
rat immunised with regdanvimab were used as a surrogate positive control. 
Neutralising activity of any ADA positives were characterised by a competitive ligand binding assay 
using MSD ECL platform with ACE step. RBD and sulfo-tag labelled regdanvimab were used as capture 
and detection reagents, respectively. Rat polyclonal anti-regdanvimab antibody was used as a 
surrogate positive control. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis 
The pharmacokinetic analysis and statistical methods used are considered adequate. Rich sampling for 
evaluation of the serum pharmacokinetics of regdanvimab was used in all three clinical studies. The PK 
was evaluated by non-compartmental analysis using Phoenix WinNonlin and parameter estimates were 
summarized by dose groups using descriptive statistics. No population PK analysis was performed, 
which is acceptable. CT-P59 is administered intravenously and is intended for single dose treatment 
only. As the indication does not include children, extrapolations are not applicable. 
Absorption 
CT-P59 is administered intravenously. Hence, the bioavailability is by definition 100% and absorption 
characteristics, including food effects, are not applicable. Following a single dose of 40 mg/kg in 
COVID-19 patients, the arithmetic mean (CV%) Cmax level was 1017 µg/mL (26.5%). 
Distribution 
No plasma protein binding study was performed, which is considered acceptable. 
The estimated volume of distribution (Vss) was 83 mL/kg, indicating, as expected for a mAb, a limited 
distribution outside the blood compartment. 
Elimination 
The metabolism and excretion pathways of regdanvimab have not been investigated. This is 
acceptable. The clearance of regdanvimab from the body is likely through normal intracellular 
catabolism, following fluid-phase or receptor-mediated endocytosis, as observed for mAbs in general. 
The clearance of regdanvimab was low, 0.2 mL/h/kg. Serum concentrations appeared to decline in a 
multi-phasic manner with a terminal half-life of 17 days. The pharmacokinetics was very similar in 
patients and healthy volunteers.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
CT-P59 is to be administered as a single dose only so time dependency is not applicable. 
Dose proportionality was assessed in all clinical studies. The exposure of regdanvimab appeared to 
increase in an approximately dose-proportional manner over the investigated range 10 to 80 mg/kg. 
Special populations 
Hepatic and renal impairment 
Specific clinical pharmacology studies to evaluate the effect of renal impairment and hepatic 
impairment on the PK of CT-P59 have not been conducted. This is acceptable. As a monoclonal 
antibody regdanvimab is likely to be eliminated via proteolytic degradation to amino acids and hence 
not anticipated to be metabolized by CYP450 enzymes or cleared by renal excretion. 
Elderly 
Of the 327 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection randomised in Study CT-P59 3.2, 16.5% were 65 years 
or older, and 3.06% were 75 years of age or older. Based on pharmacokinetic subgroup analyses, 
there is no difference in PK of regdanvimab in elderly patients compared to younger patients.  
Children 
The PK of regdanvimab in paediatric patients have not been evaluated. This is acceptable since 
Regdanvimab is not recommended for paediatric patients at the moment. This is reflected in the 
SmPC: “The pharmacokinetics of regdanvimab in paediatric patients has not been evaluated”. 
Weight, gender and race 
No dose adjustment is currently proposed based on weight, gender or race. This has been adequately 
justified. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No interactions studies have been performed which is acceptable. Regdanvimab is not expected to be 
renally cleared or metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant 
medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 
enzymes are unlikely. 
Concomitant administration of regdanvimab with COVID-19 vaccines has not been studied. 
Pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers 
Study CT-P59 1.1 is a completed first-in-human study in healthy volunteers in which the PK of 
regdanvimab was determined at four dose levels, i.e. 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg with N=6 subjects per 
group. Samples for PK evaluation were drawn up to Day 90 after dose. 
The results showed that regdanvimab have pharmacokinetic characteristics typical for an IgG 
monoclonal antibody, i.e. a low clearance, a small volume of distribution and a long terminal half-life. 
The serum exposure (Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf) increased in proportion to dose in the investigated 
dose interval with no indication of target-mediated drug disposition. The inter-individual variability 
(CV%) was low to moderate; for clearance 12-24% and for the volume of distribution 8-15%.

The mean PK estimates in healthy subjects at the proposed therapeutic dose 40 mg/kg were: 
CL 18.46 mL/h (ca 0.2 mL/h/kg), Vss 99 mL/kg and t1/2z 398.6 hours (ca 17 days). 
There were no samples that tested positive for ADA.  
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Study CT-P59 1.2 is a completed Phase 1 pilot study in patients with mild COVID-19 in which the PK 
of regdanvimab is evaluated at three dose levels, i.e. 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg with N=5 patients per 
group. Samples for PK evaluation were drawn up to Day 90 after dose. 
The mean parameter estimates at the proposed therapeutic IV single dose of 40 mg/kg were very 
similar to those in healthy volunteers, i.e. CL 17.46 mL/h (ca 0.23 mL/h/kg), Vss 102 mL/kg and t1/2z 
380.8 hours (16 days).  
Of the 18 immunogenicity samples, one pre-dose sample produced a confirmed positive ADA result but 
was negative for anti regdanvimab neutralising antibodies (NAb). 
Study CT-P59 3.2 is a completed Phase 2/3 study in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The 
PK set included 29 and 32 patients in the 40 and 80 mg/kg dose group, respectively. Samples for PK 
evaluation were drawn up to Day 90 after dose. 
The arithmetic mean peak exposure at respective dose level was 1017 µg/mL (40 mg/kg) and 
2008 µg/mL (80 mg/kg) and occurred at 2 hours after start of infusion. The corresponding AUC0-∞ 
exposure was 212461 and 426695 µg⋅h/mL, respectively. The serum concentrations of regdanvimab 
appeared to decline in a multi-phasic manner with a mean t1/2z of 17 to 19 days. 
In accordance with dose proportionality, the mean clearance was independent of dose, i.e. 
0.20 mL/h/kg at both dose levels. There was no indication of target-mediated drug disposition.  
The arithmetic mean (CV%) parameter estimates at the proposed therapeutic IV single dose of 
40 mg/kg were: CL 0.20 mL/h/kg (24%), Vss 83 mL/kg (26%) and t1/2z 17 days (37%), i.e. very 
similar to those in Study CT-P59 1.1 and 1.2. 
In part 1, the proportion of patients with positive conversion in ADA at post-treatment visits were 
3/101 (3.0%) in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg treatment group, 8/109 (7.3%) patients in the CT-P59 80 
mg/kg treatment group and 6/108 (5.6%) patients in the Placebo group. The proportion of patients 
with positive conversion in Nab at post-treatment visits were none in the CT-P59 treatment groups and 
3/110 (2.7%) patients in the Placebo group. 
In part 2, the proportion of patients with positive conversion in ADA at post-treatment visits up to Day 
28 visit were 10/635 (1.6%) patients in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg treatment group and 15/619 (2.4%) 
patients in the Placebo group. 
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Coronavirus entry into host cells via binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in 
alveolar cells and intestinal epithelia is an important determinant of viral infectivity and pathogenesis. 
The main mechanism of action of regdanvimab is blocking the binding between SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein RBD and the cellular receptor, ACE2, thus blocking the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In vitro 
assessment of Fc-mediated Function for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) were evaluated, and there was no evidence suggesting that 
Assessment report

Page 34/35 
 
 
 
 
regdanvimab is able to mediate Fc-related activities. Epitopes of regdanvimab were mapped by X-ray 
crystallography, indicating that the interaction of regdanvimab to RBD directly occludes the binding 
surface of ACE2. Also, key residues of regdanvimab binding to RBD were identified by alanine scanning 
assay. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology

Binding affinity of CT-P59 to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance  
The dose-dependent binding of CT-P59 clinical batch (Lot No. 20100V001) to RBD was found as shown 
in the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of CT-P59 to SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein was 4.4 
ng/mL and relative binding affinity against in-house reference standard (RF5901-01) was 105%. 
Table 2: SARS-CoV-2 RBD Binding Affinity of CT-P59 by ELISA 
Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 RBD Binding Affinity of CT-P59 by ELISA 
Five concentrations of CT-P59 process validation batch (Lot No. 20110V001) were serially injected and 
dissociated then the dissociation constant was evaluated by sensorgram fitting using the kinetic model 
(bivalent analyte). The binding affinity (KD) of CT-P59 for the RBD was calculated as 6.5E-11 M.

Binding specificity of regdanvimab by biolayer interferometry (BLI) 
Binding specificity of regdanvimab was measured with four different RBD and S1 proteins from closely 
related beta-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 RBD, SARS-CoV S1, HCoV-HKU1 S1, MERS-CoV RBD) by BLI. 
Regdanvimab could bind specifically to SARS-CoV-2 RBD but could not bind to other coronaviruses.

interferometry 
Inhibitory effect of regdanvimab on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 by biolayer 
interferometry (BLI) 
Once SARS-CoV-2 RBD is saturated by regdanvimab, there were no responses even in the presence of 
hACE2 (Figure below). This suggests that regdanvimab completely inhibits binding of hACE2 to SARS-
CoV-2 RBD.

Figure 4: Inhibition of Binding between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 by regdanvimab 
Epitope mapping by X-ray crystallography 
The regdanvimab/SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex crystal structure showed that the epitope residues on 
SARS-CoV-2 RBD substantially overlap with the ACE2 binding region suggesting that regdanvimab 
competes with ACE2 for the binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Among the 21 residues of RBD that interact 
with ACE2, 12 residues are also involved in the interaction with regdanvimab, when a distance cut-off 
of 4.5 Å is applied (see Figures below). 
Regdanvimab mainly uses the CDR2 and CDR3 of the heavy chain for the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 
RBD. The paratope consists of heavy chain (S32 of HCDR1; D54, W55, D56, D57, N58, Y60 of HCDR2; 
P101, G102, L104, R105, Y106, R107, R109, Y111, Y113 of HCDR3) and light chain (Y33 of LCDR1; 
Y50 and D51 of LCDR2). These observations indicate that the binding of regdanvimab to RBD directly 
occludes the binding surface of ACE2.

Determination of critical residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to CTP59 by alanine scanning assay 
Critical residues were identified by alanine scanning assay. This result indicates that 5 SARS-CoV-2 
RBD residues were identified as critical for binding by regdanvimab of Y449, L455, F456, Q493, and 
S494. RBD residues Y449, F456, Q493, and S494 were the major contributors to mAb binding, with 
L455 having secondary importance.

In vitro Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)  
The results show that the maximum cytotoxicity of Regdanvimab was less than 15%, that is a very low 
level in comparison to other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies where the major mechanism of action 
is via ADCC activity.  
In conclusion, it is agreed that ADCC is not contributing significantly to the overall activity of 
Regdanvimab.  
Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) 
When measuring CDC activity by regdanvimab normalized against the negative control (regdanvimab 
untreated) it was confirmed that none of the batches tested induced any significant in vitro CDC 
activity of target cells when incubated with complement, suggesting that CDC is unlikely to be a MoA of 
regdanvimab.

comparison with the positive control (CR3022 antibody, and convalescent plasma) and negative control 
(KZ52 antibody).

Evaluation of the Neutralising Effect of Regdanvimab against Wild Type Virus  
The neutralising ability of representative regdanvimab against wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus 
(BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020) was determined by an in vitro plaque reduction neutralisation test 
(PRNT). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and 90% of inhibitory concentration (IC90) of 
regdanvimab toward SARS-CoV-2 is determined as 9.70 ng/mL and 25.09 ng/mL, respectively.

regdanvimab (Jianhua Sui et al., 20141). Four plaques (the 4th passage) were observed at the 1 μg 
concentrations of regdanvimab. The spike gene of the four plaques at the 4th passage were sequenced 
and compared to wild type viruses. Comparative sequence analysis showed double mutations 
(S494P+R685H) in all escape viruses. Whilst amino acid 494 is located in the RBD, amino acid 685 is 
located in S1/S2 cleavage site. 
Neutralisation activity of regdanvimab against escape mutant by PRNT 
To determine the ability of regdanvimab to neutralize the escape mutants, the plaque reduction 
neutralisation test (PRNT) was conducted using mutant viruses and control virus. The control virus was 
in parallel passaged without regdanvimab. VeroE6 cells were infected with viruses in the presence of 
regdanvimab concentrations from 1 to 0.98 x 10-3 μg/ml. Neutralisation was assessed by calculating 
IC50 and the results are described in the Table below. The results suggest that even at high 
concentration (1 μg/ml), regdanvimab was unable to neutralise the escape virus.

Evaluation of the Neutralising Effect against Newly Emerging Mutant SARS-CoV-2 viruses by 
PRNT 
The neutralizing ability of regdanvimab against newly emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 viruses was 
determined by an in vitro PRNT using authentic virus in Korea Centers for Control and Disease Control 
& Prevention (KCDC). Variants were tested with three different batches of regdanvimab.  
Comparable neutralizing activity determined by PRNT was observed against UK (Alpha, B.1.1.7), Brazil 
(P.2), New York (Iota, B.1.526) and Nigeria (Eta, B.1.525) variants compared to the wild type. 
Regdanvimab had reduced neutralising activity against Brazil (Gamma, P.1), South Africa (Beta, 
B.1.351), California (B.1.427 and B.1.429) and India (Kappa B.1.617.1 and Delta, B.1.617.2) variants. 
The IC50 fold reductions relative wild type ranged between 24-310 with the largest change observed 
for the Beta and Delta variants with 310- and 183-fold reduction respectively.

Evaluation of the Neutralising Effect against Newly Emerging Mutant SARS-CoV-2 viruses by 
Micro-neutralisation Assay 
In addition to the neutralisation studies conducted in KCDC, additional studies to assess the ability of 
regdanvimab to neutralise mutant SARS-CoV-2 viruses by an in vitro micro-neutralisation assay, using 
VeroE6 cells in Viroclinics. Three-fold serial dilutions from 1 to 10000 ng/mL of regdanvimab were 
incubated with approximately 100 infectious units of viruses/well and infected the VeroE6 cells.  
Regdanvimab showed comparable neutralizing ability against UK variant compared to the wild type 
while reduced neutralising activity against SA and Brazil P.1 variants were observed. The IC50 was 
calculated according to the method described earlier (Zielinska et al., 2005).

Evaluation of the Neutralising Effect against SARS-Cov-2 Variants and Potential Escape 
Mutants Using an In Vitro Pseudovirus Assay (virus-like particle (VLP) assay) 
To analyse the effect of regdanvimab against variants and potential escape viruses, luciferase-based 
pseudovirus assay was carried out using wild-type and mutant spike-expressing lentiviruses. Mutations 
in spike gene were introduced by gene cloning method and its protein expression was confirmed by 
Western blot analysis. The pseudoviruses were produced by transfection with luciferase reporter 
plasmid along with Gag-Pol, Rev, and Spike expression plasmid and then the copy number of 
pseudoviruses was quantitated by qPCR. Pseudoviruses were mixed with diluted antibodies ranging 
from 100 to 0.005 ng/mL. The inocula infected ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells. After 72 h, luciferase 
activities were measured and IC50 values were calculated.

Evaluation of the Neutralising Effect against Globally Emerging Variants by Pseudovirus 
Assay (performed by the National Institute of Health) 
To examine the effect of regdanvimab against globally emerging variants: Variants of Concern (VOC) 
including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) in addition to variants 
of Interest (VOI) such as Kappa (B.1.617.1) and Lambda (C.37) variants, a pseudovirus assay was 
performed using wild-type and mutant spike-expressing luciferase reporter lentiviruses at National 
Institute of Health (NIH) (Neerukonda et al., 2021). Most variants showed a reduction in IC50 fold 
change compared to wildtype, see table below.

The IC50 values obtained from the two in vitro pseudovirus assay studies differed, potentially due to 
different experimental procedures. However, the neutralising effect of regdanvimab against key 
substitutions involved in South Africa (Beta), Brazil (Gamma) and Indian (Kappa) variants was reduced 
to varying degrees in both assays. 
In the first pseudovirus assay mentioned above the combination of key substitutions involved in the 
Delta variant is not included, in the second assay performed by the NIH the fold reduction for the Delta 
variant is 27.7. In the SmPC it is indicated that the fold reduction in the pseudovirus assay is 27.70 for 
B.1.617.2 (India). The Applicant used the IC50 values determined in the Mlcochova et al.’s study, to 
calculate neutralizing effect against the Delta variant of FDA EUA approved mAb treatments taking into 
consideration its IC50 value and administration dosage. The Applicant concluded that because of the 
comparatively higher clinical dosage (40 mg/kg) of CT-P59 compared to other mAbs, but also with 
similar pharmacokinetics expected with IgG1 monoclonal antibodies, the partial reduction in 
neutralisation seen with CT-P59 against the current VoCs and VoIs is not expected to impact clinical 
efficacy at the proposed dose (40 mg/kg) of CT-P59 given to the patients.  
The serum and estimated lung concentration at 96h post dose assuming 15% lung penetration are 
approximately 380000 ng/mL and 57000 ng/mL, respectively. At a more conservative estimate of 5% 
lung concentration, the 96h lung concentration would be approximately 19000 ng/mL. Thus, 
concentrations of regdanvimab in lungs would be estimated above the IC90 in vitro for all listed virus 
variants during the presumably crucial initial treatment phase. However, the (plasma or lung 
concentration/ in vitro susceptibility) quotient required for clinical efficacy has not been characterized. 
Furthermore, it is not clear that this is similar for all VOC’s, given e.g., differences in viral replication 
rates. 
In summary, PK/PD is compatible with clinical activity against the delta variant, and an ACE2 
transgenic mouse animal model is supportive of such activity. 
Evaluation of Binding Affinity to Wild Type and Mutant RBD Protein of SARS-CoV-2 by BLI 
The binding affinity of regdanvimab to wild type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 RBDs was measured by BLI 
using the Octet OKe system (ForteBio). Each RBD (50 nM) was immobilized onto Anti-Penta-HIS 
Biosensor (ForteBio), and then regdanvimab was flowed with various concentrations (10 nM, 5 nM, 2.5 
nM and 1.25 nM) for 10 min and 15 min to generate association curve and dissociation curve, 
respectively. The results of the binding affinity (KD) to a total of 71 mutant RBDs are presented in the 
Table below. 
The binding affinity of regdanvimab to mutant SARS-CoV-2 RBDs involved in the California (B.1.427 
and B.1.429), South Africa (Beta, B.1.351), Indian (Kappa B.1.617.1 and Delta, B.1.617.2) and Brazil 
(Gamma, P.1) variants was lower compared to wild type.

Animal models of efficacy against VOC’s 
A ferret study with the South-African (1.351, beta; 1.0 x 105.5 TCID50/mL) variant intranasal infection 
reported  that CT-P59 (i.v., on 1dpi, observations until 4dpi) reduces nasal and lung viral levels at 80 
and 160mg/kg (n=6 animals per group) with no measurable viral levels after 2-3dpi.  A comparative 
wild type virus ferret study (also 1.0 x 105.5 TCID50/mL) was also conducted (CT-P59 i.v. treatment at 
80mg/kg and 160mg/kg on 1dpi, observations until 6dpi; n=6 animals per group). Clear statistically 
significant reduction of viral levels in nose and lungs at 3dpi and 6dpi for wt-virus and at 2dpi and 4dpi 
respectively for the beta virus (see figure below). The viral levels in the lungs were more or less 
reduced below measurable levels for both viruses and at both doses. In the nose, the CT-P59 
treatment was somewhat less efficient on beta compared to the wt-virus. The wt-virus levels were 
below measurable levels at 2-3dpi at both doses whereas the beta virus levels were effectively reduced 
at 160mg/kg (2dpi and 4dpi) but remained slightly over the base line at 80mg/kg (at 2dpi) in nasal 
wash samples. In the nasal turbinate samples, although the levels were reduced, they were clearly 
higher than base line at 80mg/kg at 2dpi and 4dpi and at 160mg/kg at 2dpi (see figure below). HED 
(80mg/kg) at 15.1mg/kg and HED (160mg/kg) at 30.2mg/kg.

A transgenic ACE2 mouse study was provided involving post-infection treatment 8h after a Brazilian 
(P.1; “gamma”) variant challenge (intranasal exposure; 1 x 104 PFU/30μL; CT-P59 5, 20, 40 and 
80mg/kg i.p.; n=8-11 animals per group; observation until 6dpi). There was no wild-type virus 
infection control/comparison. As such, a direct wild-type versus VOC treatment comparison is not 
possible. Compared to non-treated controls, the gamma virus titres in lungs were reduced or not 
detectable in treated animals (n=4 animals/group for viral measurements on 3dpi and 6dpi 
respectively). At 3dpi, 2-3 animals out of 4 in all CT-P59 dose groups had non-detectable levels of 
virus, with reduced expression in remaining animals. At 6dpi, all treated animals had non-detectable 
virus levels. Assessment of nasal wash sample levels is more uncertain as the controls unexpectedly 
showed very low viral levels at 3dpi or 6dpi (3 out of 4 animals had no detectable levels at 3dpi and 
6dpi). All treatment groups had non-detectable levels). Viral titre reductions are shown in the figures 
below.

with necropsy on 3dpi (n=4 animals/group) and 6dpi (n=4 animals/group). Survival rate was assessed 
after 4dpi. In controls, 2/4 animals died before 6dpi. Surviving mice showed 35.27% body weight loss. 
No CT-P59 group animals died due to infection before 6dpi. Mean body weight was reduced in a 
roughly dose-dependent manner (between 15.99% and 3.61% reduction). Nasal viral titres were 
reduced on d3 (some individual variation) at 5 and 20mg/kg and non-measurable on 40mg/kg and 
80mg/kg. No measurable levels were seen at 6dpi. Viral titres in lungs were reduced (some individual

inoculation with 1x104 PFU of Delta variant in a 30μL volume) followed 8h later with 5, 20, 40 or

animals). The animals were observed until 6 days post infection (6dpi) with necropsy on 3dpi and 6dpi. 
Virus only group animals showed an average body weight loss of 16.3% at 4dpi, and eventually 
showed an average of 22.7% decrease for three mice while a single euthanized mouse excluded from 
statistical analysis at 5dpi. No animal survived at 6dpi in the virus-only group. There was no death in 
the CT-P59 groups. All CT-P59 treatment group animals relatively maintained their body weight until 
6dpi showing some dose-dependent body weight reduction (between 14.3% and 4.6% reduction) but 
no statistical significance compared to the negative control group. The mean virus titre in lung tissues 
reached 4.1 log10 PFU/mL at 3 dpi and declined to 2.43 log10 PFU/mL at 6 dpi in the virus only group. 
In treatment groups, viral levels were undetectable at 20 and 80mg/kg CT-P59 but detectable at 5 
mg/kg (3.1 log10 PFU/mL) and 40mg/kg (3.3 log10 PFU/mL). Viral titre reductions are shown in the

Secondary pharmacodynamics in-vitro studies 
Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in FcR-bearing cells (Raji & U937) and no FcR-bearing cells 
(VeroE6) 
To address the potential ADE effect of regdanvimab, SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020) 
viruses (0.05 MOI) were incubated with both permissive cells (VeroE6 cells) and Fc-bearing cells (Raji 
cells; FcγR II, U937 cells; FcγR I & II) in the presence of regdanvimab. Two antibodies, CR3022 (SARS 
neutralizing antibody) and CT-P27 (Influenza A neutralizing antibody) were used as non-neutralizing 
antibody and unrelated control, respectively. It is confirmed that regdanvimab did not induced ADE 
effect in all concentrations tested in both cells.

FcγR I&II-dependent ADE. In vitro ADE assay was carried out as described in (left panel) except using 
U937 cells. The experiments were performed in triplicates (CR3022 and CT-P27) or in quadruplicates 
(CT-P59). Average and standard deviation of virus titres were depicted as dot and error bar,

respectively.

SARS-CoV-2 was mixed with a wide range of antibodies; CT-P59 (orange), CR3022 (blue) and CT-P27

depicted as dot and error bar, respectively. 
The company argues that regdanvimab is unlikely to enhance SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and 
subsequent disease via a virus-antibody complex, and the study supports this argument. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Regdanvimab is a recombinant human monoclonal IgG1 antibody. CT-P59 (Regkirona) is intended for 
single dose treatment in adults with a proposed therapeutic dose of 40 mg/kg administered as an 
intravenous infusion over 60 minutes. 
The pharmacokinetics of regdanvimab has been well characterized; in healthy volunteers over a dose 
range of 10 to 80 mg/kg, and in patients with COVID-19 at (primarily) 40 and 80 mg/kg. Rich PK 
sampling, up to Day 90 after dose, was used in all three studies. Serum concentrations of regdanvimab 
were quantitatively measured using a validated ligand-binding assay with a lower limit of quantification 
of 800 ng/mL. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using non-compartmental analysis. No 
population PK analysis results were submitted which is acceptable.  
The phase 1 study CT-P59 1.1 in healthy volunteers showed that regdanvimab have PK characteristics 
typical for an IgG monoclonal antibody, i.e. a low clearance, a small volume of distribution and a long 
terminal half-life (17-22 days). The exposure increased in proportion to dose with no indication of 
target-mediated drug disposition. 
The phase 1 pilot study CT-P59 1.2 in patients with mild COVID-19 showed that the pharmacokinetics 
of regdanvimab was very similar to that observed in healthy volunteers. 
The phase 2/3 study CT-P59 3.2 in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 included a PK set of 29 
and 32 patients in the 40 and 80 mg/kg dose group, respectively. The pharmacokinetic results were 
very similar to those in the other two studies. Clearance was independent of dose. At the 40 mg/kg 
dose, the PK of reganvimab was characterized by a (arithmetic mean (CV%)) CL of 0.20 mL/h/kg 
(24%), a Vss of 83 mL/kg (26%) and a t1/2z of 17 days (37%).

The table below shows the observed mean serum concentrations and the predicted lung concentrations

** Predicted lung concentration assuming a lung/serum distribution coefficient of 0.15, as reported for a mAb (Shah & Betts, 2013) 
No interaction studies or studies in special populations were performed with CT-P59 which is 
acceptable. Regdanvimab is a monoclonal antibody and expected to be eliminated via proteolytic 
degradation to amino acids and is not anticipated to be eliminated intact in the urine or metabolized by 
CYP450 enzymes. No dose adjustments in renal or hepatic impairment are considered necessary. Also, 
it has been adequately justified that no dose adjustment is needed depending on age, weight, gender 
or race. 
The conclusion that the immunogenicity potential of regdanvimab is low is agreed.  
The monoclonal antibody regdanvimab (CT-P59) targets the non-endogenous epitope of the RBD 
domain of the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2. It is a protein that is not produced by mammalian cells. 
Primary pharmacology 
In ELISA and surface plasmon resonance assays, regdanvimab bound to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 EC50 of 
4.4 ng/mL. Critical residues for regdanvimab binding to its target were identified by alanine scanning 
assay. These were Y449, L455, F456, Q493, and S494.  
The neutralising ability of representative regdanvimab against wild type SARS-CoV-2 was determined 
by an in vitro plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT). The IC50 and IC90 of regdanvimab toward 
SARS-CoV-2 was 9.70 ng/mL and 25.09 ng/mL, respectively. 
In vitro assessment of Fc-mediated function for ADCC and CDC suggest that regdanvimab is not able 
to mediate Fc-related activities and this is unlikely to be a MoA of regdanvimab.  
Viral drug resistance 
In vitro virus passaging was performed with SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the presence/absence of 
regdanvimab. Comparative sequence analysis showed double mutations (S494P+R685H) in all escape 
viruses. Whilst amino acid 494 is located in the RBD, amino acid 685 is located in S1/S2 cleavage site. 
Regdanvimab was unable to neutralise the escape virus at all concentrations tested. 
Results from a VLP (pseudovirus) assay showed that S494P, S494L, Q493R and Q493K mutations 
exhibit IC50 values above 500 ng/ml and are likely to completely abrogate clinical efficacy. 
Substitutions tested and associated with >20-fold but <100 fold-change include Y449N, L452R and 
L455F. 
Activity against VOC’s 
Viral geno- and phenotyping from the pivotal trial is presently not available. It is likely, however, that 
wuhan and/or the alpha variant dominated at the times and places where this was conducted.

Neutralizing activity determined by PRNT was observed against UK (Alpha, B.1.1.7), Brazil (P.2), New 
York (Iota, B.1.526) and Nigeria (Eta, B.1.525) variants was comparable to the wild type.  
Regdanvimab had reduced neutralising activity against Brazil (Gamma, P.1), South Africa (Beta, 
B.1.351), Epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429) and India (Kappa B.1.617.1 and Delta, B.1.617.2) variants. 
The IC50 fold reductions relative wild type ranged between 24-310 with the largest change observed 
for the Beta and Delta variants with 310- and 183-fold reduction respectively. 
The VLP assays showed that spike mutations involved in the virus variants Beta, Gamma and Kappa 
led to increased IC50 values compared to the original type. 
The applicant has provided data from a Ferret model infected with the Beta (B.1.351) variant, and 
from a ACE2 transgenic mouse model infected with Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) as well as Delta 
(B.1.617.2)virus, treated with human equivalent doses as post exposure prophylaxis. Both of these 
studies are indicative of antiviral effects. However, the clinical implications of this are not completely 
known, since the predictiveness of the models have not been established, and it is not known whether 
PK/PD is similar in these models and in humans. 
PK/PD 
Notably, the reported the IC90 value in vitro for the wild type virus is 28 ng/mL. The highest reported 
IC90 value in vitro is for the Beta 1.351 (South African) virus variant: 16550 ng/mL. 
The applicant has provided measured estimates of plasma concentrations and IC50 values for the delta 
variant, along with literature-based estimates of the lung concentration at 15% and 5% of the serum 
concentration.  
The serum and estimated lung concentration at 96h post dose assuming 15% lung penetration are 
approximately 380000 ng/mL and 57000 ng/mL, respectively. At a more conservative estimate of 5% 
lung concentration, the 96h lung concentration would be approximately 19000 ng/mL Thus, 
concentrations of regdanvimab in lungs would be estimated above the IC90 in vitro for all listed virus 
variants during the presumably crucial initial treatment phase. However, the (plasma or lung 
concentration/ in vitro susceptibility) quotient required for clinical efficacy has not been characterized. 
Furthermore, it is not clear that this is similar for all VOC’s, given e.g., differences in viral replication 
rates. 
In summary, PK/PD is compatible with clinical activity against the delta variant, and an ACE2 
transgenic mouse animal model is supportive of such activity. 
According to the Applicant, it will continue to monitor and study newly emerging variants and escape 
mutants and duly report the results as they become available. 
Secondary pharmacology 
As there is evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies may promote viral entry into FcR-
expressing cells (thereby promoting inflammation), a neutralization study was conducted in cells 
expressing FcR (Raji cells with FcγR II; U937 cells with FcγR I & II). Based on anti-SARS-CoV-2 
antibody cytochemistry following 24h virus + antibody incubation, regdanvimab did not promote viral 
uptake into FcγR I and II expressing cells. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of regdanvimab has been well characterized in healthy volunteers and in the 
target population. The PK was typical for an IgG mAb with a low clearance, a small volume of 
distribution and a terminal half-life of 17 days. The serum exposure increased approximately in

proportion to dose over the investigated dose interval 10 to 80 mg/kg.  
Overall, the mechanism of action of regdanvimab has been established. There is reduced in vitro 
activity against the South Africa (Beta), Brazil (Gamma) and India (Kappa and Delta) variants. It is 
unknown whether clinical efficacy is retained.

2.5.5.2.  Main studies 
Title of study: A Phase 2/3, Randomized, Parallel-Group, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CT-P59 in Combination with Standard of Care in Outpatients with 
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Infection. 
This study was a randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, Phase 2/3 study with 2 
parts designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and virology of regdanvimab in combination with 
standard of care (SoC; except potential antiviral drugs and/or possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity drugs) 
in outpatients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection, not requiring supplemental oxygen 
therapy.  
The study consisted of 3 study periods; Screening, Treatment Period (90 days, single infusion), and 
Follow-Up Period (90 days). An End-of-Treatment (EOT) visit was scheduled on Day 90, and the total 
study duration was planned to be 180 days for each patient.

Methods 
Study Participants 
In Part 1 patients were screened at 23 study centres across 4 countries, Republic of Korea, Romania, 
Spain and United States. 
In Part 2 patients were screened at 60 study centres across 14 countries, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, 
Mexico, North Macedonia, Peru, Poland, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldavia, Romania, Serbia, 
Spain, Ukraine and United States. 
Main Inclusion Criteria 
Male or female outpatients aged 18 or above, diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection at Screening by 
using the sponsor-supplied rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test or RT-PCR were to be considered for 
enrolment in the study. ‘Outpatient’ in this study included patients visiting the study centre, and

patients confined in the study centre or quarantine at home due to local regulation or at discretion of 
the investigator.  
The patients had to have oxygen saturation >94% on room air, not requiring supplemental oxygen, 
and onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated symptom no more than 7 days prior to the study drug 
administration. 
The patients had to have 1 or more of the following (but not limited to) SARS-CoV-2 infection 
associated symptoms within but not more than 7 days prior to study drug administration: feeling 
feverish, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore throat, body pain or muscle pain, 
fatigue, headache, chills, nasal obstruction or congestion, loss of taste or smell, nausea or vomiting, or 
diarrhoea as well as 1 of the following SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated symptoms within 48 hours 
prior to study drug administration: feeling feverish, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
sore throat, body pain or muscle pain, fatigue, or headache. 
Main Exclusion Criteria 
Part 1: Key exclusion criteria included severe COVID-19, immunocompromised, iatrogenic or due to 
disease, use of other drugs with activity or efficacy in COVID-19, as well as uncontrolled or unstable 
underlying medical conditions.  
Part 2: 
The main exclusion criteria were signs of severe SARS-Cov-2 infection, including respiratory distress 
with respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/min; required supplemental oxygen; experienced shock; complicated 
with other organ failures, and intensive care unit monitoring treatment was needed by investigator’s 
discretion. Furthermore, patients could not have been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and were not 
allowed concomitant medications with established or potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. 
Treatments 
In Part 1, regdanvimab 40 mg/kg, regdanvimab 80 mg/kg, and Placebo matching in volume of 
regdanvimab 80 mg/kg was administered as an IV infusion over 90 minutes (±15 minutes). When 
calculating the total volume of study drug to be administered, the body weight of each patient 
measured on Day 1 was used. Patients who had a body weight at or above 100 kg and were allocated 
to the regdanvimab 80 mg/kg group or Placebo group received 8,000 mg of regdanvimab or a 
matching volume of Placebo. 
In Part 2, based on the result from Part 1, regdanvimab 40 mg/kg and placebo matching in volume of 
regdanvimab 40 mg/kg were administered as an IV infusion over 60 minutes (±15 minutes). Patients 
with body weight at or above 200 kg were received 8,000 mg of regdanvimab or matching volume of 
placebo. When calculating total volume of study drug to be administered, the body weight of each 
patient measured on Day 1 was used. 
All patients in both Part 1 and Part 2 were given optimal SoC. Optimal SoC can include rehydration 
therapy, antipyretics or antitussives prescribed by the investigator’s discretion.

of regdanvimab in a larger number of patients. 
Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
• 
Proportion of patients with clinical symptom requiring hospitalisation, oxygen therapy, or 
experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to Day 28 in high-risk patients 
“High-risk patients” are defined as patients who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 
and/or hospitalisation and who meet at least one of the following criteria: 
•  Advanced age (Age >50 years) 
•  Obesity (body mass index [BMI]>30 kg/m2) 
•  Cardiovascular disease, including hypertension 
•  Chronic lung disease, including asthma 
• 
Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus 
•  Chronic kidney disease, including those on dialysis 
•  Chronic liver disease 
• 
Immunosuppressed, based on prescriber’s assessment. Examples include: cancer treatment, 
bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, HIV (if poorly controlled or 
evidence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome), sickle cell anaemia, thalassemia, and 
prolonged use of immune weakening medications. 
Criteria of High-risk patients were suggested by EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (CHMP) in a scientific opinion (under Article 5(3) of Regulation 726/2004). In addition, these 
criteria are in line with CDC Recommendation (CDC, 2021).

Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of patients with clinical symptom requiring hospitalisation, oxygen therapy, or 
experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to Day 28 in all randomised patients 
Time to clinical recovery up to Day 14 in high-risk patients 
Time to clinical recovery up to Day 14 in all randomised patients 
Clinical recovery is defined as all symptoms on the SARS-CoV-2 Infection Symptom Checklist 1 (feeling 
feverish, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore throat, body pains or muscle pain, 
fatigue, and headache) being recorded as ‘absent’ or ‘mild’ in intensity for at least 48 hours. To meet 
the clinical recovery, symptoms ‘severe’ or ‘moderate’ in intensity at baseline should be changed to 
‘mild’ or ‘absent’, or symptoms ‘mild’ in intensity at baseline should be changed to ‘absent’, after the 
study drug administration. Symptoms ‘absent’ in intensity at baseline should maintain as ‘absent’ for at 
least 48 hours. If a symptom ‘absent’ in intensity at baseline becomes ‘severe’, ‘moderate’, or ‘mild’ 
during the study, this should be changed back to ‘absent’ for at least 48 hours. In Part 2, missing 
symptoms at baseline should become ‘absent’ for at least 48 hours to meet the clinical recovery. 
Patients who report at least one symptom at baseline were included in the analysis. 
Exploratory Virology Endpoints 
•  Viral shedding in nasopharyngeal swab specimen based on RT-qPCR 
•  Genotype and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates 
•  Viral serology for SARS-CoV-2 antibody 
Quantification of SARS-Cov-2 in nasopharyngeal secretions 
Based on the method performance results obtained from the method validation study of the RT-qPCR 
assay, the low limit of detection (LLOD95) of the RT-qPCR was determined as 2.33 (95% CI: 1.74 – 
3.72) log10 cp/ml. To quantitate viral loads in clinical samples from Studies CT-P59 1.2 and CT-P59 
3.2, one real-time qPCR method (Sarbeco E-gene assay) was employed which is specific to E gene of 
Sarbecoviruses including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.  
The following rules present how viral titres were treated in the descriptive summary and AUC 
calculation and categorized as “Positive” or “Negative”. 
Table 11: Rules of Viral Titres 
Serological methods 
IgG or IgM antibodies as determined by sponsor-supplied rapid diagnostic test, Celltrion DiaTrust 
COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. 
Assays was to be performed locally using the serum samples (if the assay was available). 
Serostatus at Day 1 (Sero Positive, Sero Negative and Other): 
•  A patient was considered to have seropositive serostatus if there was at least 1 positive result 
of viral serology for SARS-CoV-2 Antibody IgG and IgM at Day 1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 60/61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  A patient was considered to have seronegative serostatus if there were both negative results of 
viral serology for SARS-CoV-2 Antibody IgG and IgM at Day 1. 
•  Otherwise, a patient was considered to have other serostatus 
It is not known what the sensitivity of the sponsor-supplied rapid test is relative to tests used in the 
evaluations of other SARS-CoV-2-specific mAbs. Therefore, data are not readily comparable. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 1: 327 male or female patients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection 
were randomly assigned at Day 1 in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 groups (regdanvimab 40 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg, 
or Placebo).  
Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2: 1,315 male or female patients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection 
were randomly assigned at Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 groups (regdanvimab 40 mg/kg or Placebo). 
For both study parts the randomization was stratified by age (≥60 years vs. <60 years), baseline 
comorbidities (Yes vs. No, having at least one of cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and pneumonia), region (United States vs. Asia vs. European Union 
vs. other) and participation in PK sub-study (Yes vs. No, Part 1 only). 
This study is double-blinded and will remain blinded to the investigator, all designated study staff (with 
the exception of the unblinded study pharmacists or unblinded staff designated to prepare the study 
drug for infusion and predefined unblinded teams in the sponsor and CRO), and patients until the final 
CSR is generated. 
Statistical methods 
Definition of analysis sets  
Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 1 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) Set: all randomly assigned patients to study drug.  
The intent-to-treat infected (ITTI) Set: all randomly assigned patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infection by pre-infusion result (Day 1) of RT-qPCR who receive a complete or partial dose of study 
drug. If the pre-infusion result at Day 1 is confirmed negative or missing and the Day 2 result is 
confirmed positive, this patient was considered as confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2   
The following patient analysis sets are defined: Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Set, ITT Set – High Risk, Intent-
to-Treat Infected (ITTI) Set, ITTI Set – High Risk and Safety Set. The Safety Set was defined as all 
randomly assigned patients who received a complete or partial dose of study drug. 
The intent-to-treat (ITT) Set: all randomly assigned patients to study drug.  
The intent-to-treat infected (ITTI) Set: all randomly assigned patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infection by pre-infusion result (Day 1) of RT-qPCR who receive a complete or partial dose of study 
drug. If the pre-infusion result at Day 1 is confirmed negative or missing and the Day 2 or Day 3 result 
is confirmed positive, this patient was considered as confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
According the protocol only patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at or prior to screening 
were eligible for the study. The applicant was asked to comment under which circumstances pre-
infusion results were obtained. The Applicant laid down that amongst the randomised patients, those

with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive results at baseline based on RT-qPCR at the central laboratory 
and who received a complete or partial dose of the study drug were included in the Intent-to-treat 
Infected (ITTI) Set. In addition, if the pre-infusion result at Day 1 was confirmed negative or missing 
and the Day 3 result was confirmed positive, this patient was also considered as confirmed SARS-CoV-
2 infection and included in the ITTI Set. 
“High-risk patients”: patients who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or 
hospitalisation and who meet at least one of the following criteria: Age >50 years; BMI > 30 kg/m2 
collected via vital signs CRF; Cardiovascular disease, including hypertension; Chronic lung disease, 
including asthma; Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus; Chronic kidney disease, including those on 
dialysis; Chronic liver disease; and Immunosuppressed, based on prescriber’s assessment. 
ITT Set – High Risk: all randomly assigned patients to study drug, who are at high risk for progressing 
to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalisation and who meet at least one of the high-risk criteria. 
ITTI Set – High Risk: all randomly assigned patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by pre-
infusion result (Day 1) of RT-qPCR, who receive a complete or partial dose of study drug, who are at 
high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalisation and who meet at least one of the 
high-risk criteria. If the pre-infusion result at Day 1 is confirmed negative or missing and the Day 2 or 
Day 3 result is confirmed positive, this patient was be considered as confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
For analysis of time to event endpoints, the following patients will be included in the analysis set:  
• 
• 
Time to clinical recovery: Patients who report at least one symptom at baseline 
Time to negative conversion: Patients who have positive result confirmed based on the 
negative threshold in the analysis at baseline (or Day 2/Day 3). The same analysis set will be 
used for the proportion of negative conversion 
Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 1 
Efficacy, virology and safety Analyses 
There was no assignation of type 1 error control and all analyses are considered exploratory.  
Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2 
Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed on the ITT set – High Risk using the p-value from stratified 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test at the 2-sided significance level of 5%. The difference of 
proportions between two treatment groups estimated using CMH weights was also provided along with 
the 95% stratified Newcombe CI with CMH weights. For sensitivity analysis, Fisher’s exact test was 
conducted on ITT set – High Risk and the 95% exact CI (Chan and Zhang 1999) for the treatment 
difference was provided. Also, supportive analysis was performed on ITTI set – High Risk. Proportion of 
patients with clinical symptom requiring hospitalisation, oxygen therapy, or experiencing mortality due 
to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to Day 28 in high-risk patient were presented along with 95% Wilson 
(score) CI for the proportion in each treatment group. 
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH)test was stratified by age (≥60 years vs. <60 years), baseline 
comorbidities (Yes vs. No) and region (United States vs. European Union vs. other). For the region, the 
patients in Asia are included in other category as the number of patients in Asia was confirmed to be 
around 1% during blinded DRM. 
In addition, the analysis for the following subgroups will be conducted on ITT set – High Risk: 
•  Age (<60 years, ≥60 years, ≥50 years) 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 62/63 
 
 
 
•  Baseline comorbidities (Yes, No) 
•  Region (United States, Asia, European Union, Other) 
•  Race (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native 
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Not Allowed by Investigator Country Regulations, Other) 
•  Sex (Male, Female) 
•  Non-high-risk (except for age category) and age (>60 years, >50 years) on ITT Set  
•  Disease severity (Mild, moderate) 
Multiple testing - Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
If the primary endpoint is statistically significant, the key secondary endpoints will be tested using the 
fixed sequence procedure in order to preserve the Type I error. The order of testing is as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
Proportion of patients with clinical symptom requiring hospitalization, oxygen therapy, or 
experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to Day 28 in all randomized patients. 
Time to clinical recovery up to Day 14 in high-risk patients. 
Time to clinical recovery up to Day 14 in all randomized patients. 
The first key secondary endpoint will be tested only if the primary endpoint is statistically significant, 
and the next key secondary endpoint will be tested only if the previous key secondary endpoint is 
statistically significant. 
The key secondary endpoints were tested at the 2-sided significance level of 5% on the ITT set (for 
high-risk patients, ITT Set – High Risk) using the p-value from stratified CMH test for binary endpoints 
or stratified log-rank test for time to event endpoints. The supportive analysis was performed on ITTI 
set (for high-risk patients, ITTI set - High Risk). 
Time to event is defined as the elapsed time (in days) from the study drug administration to the 
earliest day satisfying the condition and calculated as (Date/time of event or censoring – Date/time of 
study drug administration). The following patients will be considered censored at their scheduled visit 
of interest (Day 14). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Patients who are ongoing in the study without event 
Patients with death or early withdrawal for any reason prior to their scheduled visit of interest 
(Day 14) 
Patients who administered the rescue therapy due to SARS Cov-2 infection prior to their 
scheduled visit of interest (Day 14) 
Patients who were hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to their scheduled visit of 
interest (Day 14) 
For time to clinical recovery endpoints, patients who report at least one symptom at baseline were 
included in the analysis. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be analysed on both ITT and ITTI sets. Confidence interval and 
p-value will be presented for comparison between treatment groups in a descriptive manner with no 
adjustments for multiple testing. 
Binary endpoints and time to event endpoints will be summarised and analysed using the same 
statistical method as the key secondary endpoints. Continuous endpoints will be summarised using 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 63/64 
 
 
 
descriptive statistics and analysed using analysis of covariance presenting a point estimate, p-value 
and 95% CI for the treatment difference. 
Virology Analyses: 
Virology assessments were analysed on the ITTI Set and listed ITT Set. Actual values and change from 
baseline for viral shedding, percentage of patients with positive/negative viral shedding, duration (in 
days) of viral shedding, and area under the concentration-time curve of viral levels were summarized 
by treatment groups at each scheduled visit using descriptive statistics or frequency tables. Mean viral 
load titre (log values) for each scheduled time point was plotted. Serology results were summarized in 
tables by treatment groups. Genotype and phenotype results will be summarized in tables by 
treatment groups.

Figure 19(E) - Patient Disposition in Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2: Intent-to-Treat Set 
In Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2, 1467 patients were screened into the study and 1315 (including 880 high-
risk patients) patients were randomly assigned to the study treatment at Day 1 (656, 659 patients in 
the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg, Placebo groups, respectively). Among the randomised patients, 1302 
(652/656 [99.4 %], 650/659 [98.6 %] patients in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg, Placebo groups, 
respectively) had received the study drug. There were 3 deaths in Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2. Of the 3 
death, 2 deaths were reported in placebo group during treatment period and 1 death was reported in 
40 mg/kg group during follow up period. 
Of these patients, 55/1315 (4.2%) patients discontinued the study during the Treatment Period. The 
most frequently reported primary reason for discontinuation during the Treatment Period was 
withdrawal by subject [45/1315 (3.4%)]. The mean (SD) time on study prior to discontinuation was 
9.8 days (7.7 days) in the Treatment Period.

Baseline characteristics for ITT Set – High Risk displayed a similar trend to the baseline characteristics 
for ITT Set. 
Overall, the median (minimum, maximum) times (days) from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection related 
symptom started to the date of study drug administration in ITT Set were similar between the 2 groups 
(4.0 [1, 12] and 4.0 [0, 11] days in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg and Placebo groups, respectively). In 
ITT Set – High Risk, the results were same as ITT Set (4.0 [1, 12] and 4.0 [0, 11] days in the

Proportion of Patient at High Risk Group by risk factor the breakdown of high risk factors in the ITT set 
gives some insight. In the ITT set the patients with chronic lung disease including asthma were 
somewhat more common in the placebo group (2.9% for regdanvimab vs. 4.6% for placebo) and 
diabetes mellitus were more common in the regdanvimab treated group (11.1% for regdanvimab vs. 
7.1% for placebo). Overall, the proportions of at least one high risk factor are similar between the 
treatment groups.

Viral Shedding 
After study drug administration on Day 1, greater reductions from baseline viral load were shown in 
regdanvimab groups compared to the Placebo group, mostly notable up to Day 10. At Day 7 patients 
treated with regdanvimab had 39% more reduction in viral titre compared to Placebo. The mean (SD) 
change from baseline in viral titre at Day 7 was -3.184 (1.496) in the regdanvimab treatment groups 
and -2.290 (1.709) log10 copies/ml in the Placebo group.

Genotyping of clinical isolates 
Nasopharyngeal samples with viral concentrations above the lower limit for sequencing and from 
patients who did not reach clinical recovery by Day 14 or did not show decrease in viral shedding are 
sequenced at baseline and post-treatment in order to monitor for potential regdanvimab-resistance 
associated spike variations. Samples from a total 158 patients (36, 40 and 82 patients in the CT-P59 
40 mg/kg, CT-P59 80 mg/kg and Placebo groups, respectively) were analysed by next-generation 
sequencing (NGS).

Variant at spike protein amino acid positions Q493 or S494 at an allele fraction of ≥15% were detected 
for 16.7% (6/36) of patients in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg group and 7.5% (3/40) of patients in the CT-P59 
80 mg/kg group post-treatment and included Q493K/R and S494P/L. In addition, E484G (23.256% 
allele frequency) was found at Day 3 in one patient. 
At the present, there is no clear indication of any new emerging resistant SARS-Cov-2 variant in 
patients failing regdanvimab treatment. However, genotyping results from Part 2 are pending and a 
complete assessment will be made upon availability of those results. 
Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Proportion of Patients with Clinical Symptoms Requiring Hospitalisation, Oxygen Therapy, or 
Experiencing Mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 Infection up to Day 28 in High-Risk Patients 
A total of 69 patients were identified to meet the criteria for hospitalisation (e.g. supplemental oxygen 
therapy and/or ≥24 hours of acute care, in a hospital or similar acute care facility), or oxygen therapy 
(at least 24 hours of supplemental oxygen care and SpO2 measure in room air before applying 
supplemental oxygen shows ≤94%), or experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in all 
randomized patients. Among them, 62 patients were at high risk according to the criteria defined 
above. 
In patients with high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19, the proportion of patients with clinical 
symptoms requiring hospitalisation, oxygen therapy or experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 
infection up to Day 28 was significantly lower in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg group (14/446 [3.1 %]) 
compared to the Placebo group (48/434 [11.1 %]), which corresponds to a 72 % reduction. The 
difference between the proportions was statistically significant (p<0.0001 [stratified CMH test]; 
estimated difference [95% CI] = -8.0 [-11.7, -4.5]). The result for the ITTI Set - High Risk showed 
similar trend. 
There were 1 and 2 deaths in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg and Placebo groups, respectively. The cause 
of death was in all cases assessed as related to worsening of COVID-19.

The subgroup analysis for the primary endpoint was conducted in accordance with the predefined 
category in SAP. The subgroup analysis of age, sex, and baseline comorbidities in high-risk patients 
indicated a similar trend to the main analysis; the proportion of patients with clinical symptoms 
requiring hospitalization, oxygen therapy, or experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was 
lower in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg group compared to the Placebo group. The subgroup analysis of 
region and race showed no clear trend as majority of patients were enrolled from EU region and were 
White. See details in section Ancillary Analyses below. 
As the primary endpoint was statistically significant, the first key secondary endpoint was tested 
following hierarchical principles. In the same manner, subsequent key secondary endpoints were 
tested based on a fixed sequence procedure in order to preserve the Type I error.

Time to Clinical Recovery up to Day 14 in High-Risk Patients  
The median time to clinical recovery (at least 48 hours) in high-risk patients was 9.27 days in 
regdanvimab 40 mg/kg group, but the median time was not reached in Placebo group as less than 
50% of patients in Placebo group achieved clinical recovery up to Day 14 (48.8%). Therefore, it can be 
inferred that the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg group shortened time to clinical recovery in high-risk patients 
by at least 4.73 days compared to the Placebo group. The difference in time to clinical recovery 
between treatment groups was statistically significant (p<0.0001 [stratified log-rank test]; clinical 
recovery ratio [95% CI] = 1.58 [1.31, 1.90]), see table below. 
The Kaplan-Meier plot for the cumulative proportion of the patients with clinical recovery (at least 48 
hours) up to Day 14 showed that the proportion gradually increased over time in all groups, and the 
proportions were consistently higher in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg group compared to the Placebo 
group at all time points, see figure below. The results of time to clinical recovery in high-risk patients 
for the ITTI Set – High Risk showed similar trend.

Figure 21(E) – Time to Clinical Recovery (for at least 48 hours) up to Day 14: Intent-to-
Treat Set – High Risk, Part 2 
Time to Clinical Recovery up to Day 14 in All Randomised Patients  
The time to clinical recovery (at least 48 hours) was significantly shorter in patients who received 
regdanvimab than patients who received the placebo (median, 8.38 days vs. 13.25 days in the ITT 
set). The difference in time to clinical recovery between treatment groups was statistically significant 
(p<0.0001[stratified log-rank test]; clinical recovery ratio [95% CI]=1.50 [1.29, 1.73]). 
A post-hoc analysis of the proportion of patients who met the criteria for clinical recovery (at least 48 
hours) up to Day 14 and subsequently had a relapse up to Day 28 was conducted in ITT set, and 
showed that the relapse rate is slightly lower in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg compared to the Placebo 
(169/412 [41.0%] and 144/323 [44.6%], respectively).

regdanvimab 40 mg/kg group (2/210 [1.0%]) compared to the Placebo group (5/225 [2.2 %]), which 
corresponds to a 55 % reduction (p=0.2511 [stratified CMH test]; estimated difference [95% CI] = -
1.4 [-4.6, 2.6]).  
Secondary Endpoints 
The Applicant has performed a number of secondary analyses. These include the proportion of patients 
with all-cause mortality and time to negative conversion of Sars-Cov-2 NPH PCR.  
Proportion of Patients with All-Cause Mortality – ITT set 
The proportion of patients with all-cause mortality up to Day 28 in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg group 
was lower than the Placebo group (1/656 [0.2%] and 2/659 [0.3%] patients in the regdanvimab 40 
mg/kg and Placebo groups, respectively (p=0.5389 [stratified CMH test]).  
Time to Negative Conversion up to Day 28 – ITT set 
The time to negative conversion (<2.33 log10cp/mL as negative) up to Day 28 by RT-qPCR in the 
regdanvimab 40 mg/kg group was shorter than the Placebo group (median, 11.89 and 13.13 days in 
the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg and Placebo groups, respectively). The differences in time to negative 
conversion between the two treatment groups was significant (p<0.0001 [stratified log-rank test]; 
negative conversion ratio [95% CI]= 1.48 (1.30, 1.67)).  
Virology and Serology Analyses 
Viral Shedding  
In the ITTI Set, the mean virus titre detected by RT-qPCR at baseline were similar between the 2 
groups (6.055 log10 cp/mL and 6.089 log10 cp/mL in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg and Placebo groups, 
respectively). By Day 7, patients in regdanvimab mg/kg group showed greater reduction of viral load 
compared to the patients in the Placebo group. The mean (SE) change from baseline for viral shedding 
at Day 7 were: -2.770 (0.0652) log10 cp/mL and -2.236 (0.0637) log10 cp/mL in regdanvimab 40 
mg/kg and Placebo groups, respectively. 
Figure 22(E) - Mean (±SE) Change from Baseline of Viral Load Titres (log10 cp/mL) – Intent-
to-Treat Infected Set, Part 2. 
These results confirm the viral shedding results in Part 1 of the study. The greater reduction in viral 
shedding at Day 7 in the regdanvimab treated patient group supports the clinical efficacy of 
regdanvimab. 
However, as this is an exploratory endpoint in the protocol, and since this is neither of direct clinical 
Assessment report

relevance nor a surrogate endpoint of efficacy, the Applicant was asked to remove the virology section, 
including the figure, from 5.1 in the SmPC. 
Serology against Sars-Cov-2 
In Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2, 57/656 (8.7%) and 50/659 (7.6%) in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg and 
Placebo groups, respectively, were positive at Day 1 for either IgG or IgM antibodies as determined by 
sponsor-supplied rapid diagnostic test, Celltrion DiaTrust COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test. 
In the ITT-High Risk Set, a subgroup analysis for the proportion of patients with clinical symptoms 
requiring hospitalisation, oxygen therapy or experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 
Day 28 was conducted by serology status (table below). 
Table 26: (E) - Proportion of Patients with Clinical Symptom Requiring Hospitalisation, 
Oxygen Therapy, or Experiencing Mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 Infection up to Day 28 by

Note: Clinical symptom which requires hospitalisation, oxygen therapy, or experiencing mortality due to SARSCoV-2 
infection up to Day 28 is included. Criterion of Hospitalisation is ≥24 hours of acute care. Criteria of oxygen 
therapy are at least 24 hours of supplemental oxygen care and SpO2 measure in room air before applying 
supplemental oxygen showing ≤94%.

3 95% CI for each proportion is computed by Wilson (score) method. 
It is not known if the sensitivity of the rapid test is comparable to tests used in the evaluations of other 
SARS-CoV-2-specific mAbs. The number of seropositive at baseline and the number of events is too 
scarce to give any insights on additional benefit of regdanvimab in patients that are seropositive at 
baseline.  
Genotype and Phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 Viral Isolates 
Results of genotype and phenotype will be presented in Part 2 Final CSR. Genotype and phenotype 
results will be summarized for the ITTI Set by treatment group at each scheduled visit using frequency 
tables. The applicant should provide timelines for the delivery of these data. Phenotyping assessment 
in Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2 will be done with variants in RBD at allelic frequency of ≥15% and all 
variants in epitope found at post-treatment from patients who received CT-P59 in Study CT-P59 3.2 
Part 2. Neutralization activity will be evaluated in the pseudovirus assay. Phenotyping results are 
expected to be available in December 2021. 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has conducted A Phase 2/3, Randomized, Parallel-Group, Placebo-Controlled, Double-
Blind Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CT-P59 in Combination with Standard of Care in 
Outpatients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Infection. 
This study was designed in two parts. The first part tested two dose levels versus placebo (40 mg/kg 
and 80 mg/kg as a single dose). It indicated the anticipated antiviral effects. On the basis of results 
from part one, where no dose-response was seen, the 40 mg/kg dose was selected for the 
confirmatory part 2 of the study, which tested the hypothesis that regdanvimab given to outpatients 
with early disease might reduce the risk of hospitalisation or severe disease. 
In the pivotal Part 2 of the study, patients were screened at 60 study centres across, Hungary, Ireland, 
Italy, Mexico, North Macedonia, Peru, Poland, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldavia, Romania, 
Serbia, Spain, Ukraine and United States. 
The study included outpatients aged 18 or above. Patients had to have oxygen saturation >94% on 
room air, not requiring supplemental oxygen, and onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated symptom 
no more than 7 days prior to the study drug administration. The key exclusion criterion was signs of 
severe COVID. Furthermore, patents were required to be unvaccinated for SARS-CoV-2. 
Patients were randomised to receive a single dose of 40 mg/kg of regdanvimab, or placebo. 
The Primary Efficacy Endpoint was the proportion of patients with clinical symptom requiring 
hospitalisation, oxygen therapy, or experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to Day 28 in 
high-risk patients 
“High-risk patients” met at least one of the following criteria: 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 87/88 
 
 
 
 
•  Advanced age (Age >50 years) 
•  Obesity (body mass index [BMI]>30 kg/m2) 
•  Cardiovascular disease, including hypertension 
•  Chronic lung disease, including asthma 
• 
Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus 
•  Chronic kidney disease, including those on dialysis 
•  Chronic liver disease 
• 
Immunosuppressed.  
If the primary endpoint is statistically significant, the key secondary endpoints was to tested using the 
fixed sequence procedure in order to preserve the Type I error. The order of testing was as follows: 
1.  Proportion of patients with clinical symptom requiring hospitalization, oxygen therapy, or 
experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to Day 28 in all randomized patients. 
2.  Time to clinical recovery up to Day 14 in high-risk patients. 
3.  Time to clinical recovery up to Day 14 in all randomized patients. 
Originally, a total of 1172 patients (586 patients per group) were planned for. This was changed to 
1300 patients (650 patients per group) in a late protocol amendment. The primary objective was 
changed in the same amendment 6 of the protocol (dated 22 March 2021) to restrict the primary 
efficacy population to high-risk patients. Additionally, key secondary endpoints were defined together 
with a multiple testing procedure to control the type 1-error for the primary and key secondary 
analyses.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study period for the pivotal part 2, was from 18 January 2021 (first patient’s study drug 
administration date) to 21 May 2021 (last patient’s Day 28 visit). Approximately 80% of patients were 
treated in the EU; the majority of the rest in the US.  
About 2/3 of recruited patients were over age 50 or had other recognised risk factors for severe 
COVID-19; however only two patients were classified as “immunosuppressed”. 87% of patients had 
negative serology for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline. 
In patients with high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19, the proportion of patients with clinical 
symptoms requiring hospitalisation, oxygen therapy or experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 
infection up to Day 28 was significantly lower in the regdanvimab group (14/446 [3.1 %]) compared to 
the placebo group (48/434 [11.1 %]) which corresponds to a 72 % reduction. The difference between 
the proportions was statistically significant (p<0.0001 [stratified CMH test]; estimated difference [95% 
CI] = -8.0 [-11.7, -4.5]). 
In all randomised patients, the proportion of patients with clinical symptoms requiring hospitalisation, 
oxygen therapy or experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to Day 28 was significantly 
lower in the regdanvimab group (16/656 [2.4 %]) compared to the Placebo group (53/659 [8.0 %]) 
which corresponds to a 70% reduction. The differences between the proportion was statistically 
significant (p<0.0001 [stratified CMH test]; estimated difference [95% CI]= -5.9 [-8.5, -3.3]). 
In non-high-risk patients, the proportion of patients with clinical symptoms requiring hospitalisation, 
oxygen therapy or experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to Day 28 was lower in the 
regdanvimab group (2/210 [1.0%]) compared to the Placebo group (5/225 [2.2 %]), which 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 88/89 
 
 
 
 
corresponds to a 55% reduction (p=0.2511 [stratified CMH test]; estimated difference [95% CI] = -
1.4 [-4.6, 2.6]).  
Thus, in this substratum, efficacy was not independently demonstrated. Notably, the applicant is 
seeking an indication for patients at “high risk”, which is appropriate. However, a Major Objection on 
the indication wording was issued, as “increased risk” was the preferred term of the Committee. The 
applicant acknowledged the CHMP comment and the wording of the indication was amended, and the 
risk factors listed in Section 4.1 deleted as recommended by the CHMP. The proposed indication 
wording is now in line with the CHMP request. 
The median time to clinical recovery (at least 48 hours) in high-risk patients was 9.27 days in 
regdanvimab group, but the median time was not reached in Placebo group as less than 50% of 
patients in this group achieved clinical recovery up to Day 14 (48.8%). The difference in time to clinical 
recovery between treatment groups was statistically significant (p<0.0001 [stratified log-rank test]; 
clinical recovery ratio [95% CI] = 1.58 [1.31, 1.90]) 
The proportion of patients with all-cause mortality up to Day 28 in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg group 
was lower than the Placebo group (1/656 [0.2%] and 2/659 [0.3%] patients in the regdanvimab 40 
mg/kg and Placebo groups, respectively 
The time to negative virological conversion (<2.33 log10cp/mL as negative) up to Day 28 by RT-qPCR 
of nasopharyngeal swabs was shorter in the regdanvimab group than the Placebo group (median, 
11.89 and 13.13 days in the regdanvimab and Placebo groups, respectively). The differences in time to 
negative conversion between the two treatment groups was significant (p<0.0001 [stratified log-rank 
test]; negative conversion ratio [95% CI]= 1.48 (1.30, 1.67)).Viral strains circulating at the time, and 
the regions of the study, were predominantly Wuhan and/or the alpha (B.1.117) variant.  
Regdanvimab has reduced neutralising activity against South Africa (Beta, B.1.351), Brazil (Gamma, 
P.1), California (B.1.427 and B.1.429) and India (Kappa B.1.617.1 and Delta, B.1.617.2) variants in 
the PRNT and pseudovirus assays. In particular, there was a 183-fold shift in susceptibility for the delta 
variant (B.1.617.2. in a PRNT assay with the authentic virus).  
The applicant has submitted top line data from the 4.1. study, which is a post marketing cohort 
performed in South Korea. In this, patients are hospitalised with moderate disease at baseline. Among 
330 patients known to have delta- or non-delta variants, disease progression rate was approximately 
20% regardless of viral strain. It is evident from the substantially risk of progression to severe disease, 
that this cohort differs from the population in study 3.2. Thus, we lack an index of regdanvimab 
efficacy in this population. Altogether these data are compatible with clinical efficacy against the delta 
variant, but they do not demonstrate it. 
2.5.6. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It has been demonstrated that regdanvimab provides a clinically relevant reduction of the risk for 
progression to severe disease requiring hospitalisation or oxygen therapy, in outpatients presenting 
with mild or moderate disease, that are at increased risk of severe disease. It has also been 
demonstrated that regdanvimab reduces the duration of symptoms in such patients. Thus, efficacy has 
been established. 
PK/PD data, animal model data, as well as post marketing data from South Korea are compatible with 
activity also against the delta variant, for which in vitro susceptibility is decreased. Clinical efficacy 
against the delta variant, however, has not been demonstrated. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to Clinical:

Common Adverse Events 
Study CT-P59 1.1 (Healthy Subjects) 
In Study CT-P59 1.1 in healthy subjects, the number of subjects who experienced at least 1 treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAE) in the treatment groups were 0, 4 (66.7%), 3 (50.0%) and 0 subjects 
in the regdanvimab 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg treatment groups, respectively, and 
1 (12.5%) subject in the Placebo group. All TEAEs were CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events) grade 1 or 2 in intensity except for Grade 3 TEAEs of limb injury and urticaria in one 
subject in the regdanvimab 20 mg/kg treatment group. 
Study CT-P59 1.2 (Patients with Mild COVID-19) 
In Study CT-P59 1.2 in patients with mild symptoms to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the number of patients 
who experienced at least 1 TEAE in the treatment groups were 3 (60.0%), 4 (80.0%) and 3 (60.0%) 
patients in the regdanvimab 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg treatment groups, respectively, and 1 
(33.3%) patient in the Placebo group. Most of the TEAEs were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 in intensity. There 
were no TEAEs reported by the Investigator to be related to the study drug. 
Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were reported for 3 (60.0%) patients in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg treatment 
group (Grade 3 of hepatocellular injury, Grade 3 of alanine aminotransferase [ALT] increased and 
Grade 4 hypertriglyceridaemia) and 1 (33.3%) patient in the Placebo group (Grade 3 of COVID-19 
pneumonia).  
The frequency of grade 3 ALT abnormalities in the CT-P59 1.2 study are somewhat striking and 
unexpected given the treatment modality but have not been reproduced in the later studies.  
Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 1 (Patients with Mild to Moderate COVID-19) 
The most commonly reported TEAEs (> 2% patients overall) were hypertriglyceridaemia (9 [2.8%] 
patients overall; 6 [5.7%], 0, 6 [2.8%] and 3 [2.7%] patients in the regdanvimab 40 mg/kg, 
regdanvimab 80 mg/kg, pooled regdanvimab and Placebo groups, respectively), dyslipidaemia (9 
[2.8%] patients overall; 4 [3.8%], 3 [2.7%], 7 [3.3%] and 2 [1.8%] patients, respectively), blood 
creatine phosphokinase increased (8 [2.5%] patients overall; 5 [4.8%], 2 [1.8%], 7 [3.3%] and 1 
[0.9%] patients, respectively), and hyperglycaemia (7 [2.2%] patients overall; 2 [1.9%], 2 [1.8%], 4 
[1.9%] and 3 [2.7%] patients, respectively).

In Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 1, the majority of TEAEs were CTCAE grade 1 in intensity. Grade 3 or higher 
TEAEs were reported for 6 (5.7%), 5 (4.5%), 11 (5.1%) and 3 (2.7%) patients in the CT-P59 40 
mg/kg, CT-P59 80 mg/kg, pooled CT-P59 and Placebo groups, respectively.  
The most frequently reported grade 3 or higher TEAE was blood creatine phosphokinase increased (4 
[1.2%] patients overall; 2 [1.9%], 1 [0.9%], 3 [1.4%] and 1 [0.9%] patients, respectively). All grade 
3 or higher TEAEs were unrelated to the study drug except for grade 3 hypertriglyceridaemia reported 
in 1 (1.0%) patient in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg treatment group.

Hypertriglyceridaemia (Grade 4) was reported for one patient in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg treatment group 
on Day 14. Triglyceride level was already over 300 mg/dL at Screening (333 mg/dL, reference range of 
45 to 200 mg/dL) and the levels were reported between 275 to 318 mg/dL up to Day 10, but was 1427 
mg/dL on Day 14 and reported as a grade 4 TEAE. However, the triglyceride level decreased to 296 
mg/dL on Day 28 without treatment and the event was recovered. The patient was not obese with 
screening BMI of 25 kg/m2. The Investigator confirmed that the patient was on fat-rich diet recently 
and considered the event to be unrelated to the study drug. 
Blood creatinine phosphokinase increased (Grade 4) was reported for one patient in the CT-P59 40 
mg/kg treatment group at Day 28 visit. The creatinine phosphokinase level was normal up to Day 14, 
but increased over 10xULN (4917 U/L, reference range of 24 to 207 U/L) at Day 28 visit and reported 
as a grade 4 TEAE. The levels decreased to 330 U/L 6 days after. No treatment was given. The patient 
did not present any cardiac signs or symptoms and the Investigator confirmed that the event is 
recovering and considered the event to be unrelated to the study drug. 
Neutropenia (Grade 4) was reported for one patient in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg treatment group at Day 
28 visit. The neutrophil count was normal up to Day 14 but decreased below 0.5x103/μL (0.47x103/μL, 
reference range of 1.70 to 7.90×103/μL) at Day 28 visit and reported as a grade 4 TEAE. The patient 
did not have any relevant symptoms, so no treatment was given. The Investigator confirmed that the 
event was recovering and considered the event to be related to the study drug. 
There is an imbalance in the number of grade 3-4 CPK elevations between the treatment and placebo 
arms (6 vs 0). However, when reviewing the laboratory data, the number of grade 3-4 abnormalities 
are 13 in the treatment group and 9 in the placebo group. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Infusion related reaction (hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions, IRR) is considered as an AESI 
because AEs related to infusion related reactions are seen with monoclonal antibody therapy. 
In Studies CT-P59 1.1 and CT-P59 1.2, there was no TEAE of infusion-related reaction (IRR) including 
hypersensitivity/ anaphylactic reaction in patients in the regdanvimab treatment groups during the 
study period. 
In Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 1, TEAEs classified as IRR were reported for 1 (1.0%) and 2 (1.8%) patients 
in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg and Placebo groups, respectively. No IRRs were reported in CT-P59 80 mg/kg 
treatment group. All IRR events were grade 1 or 2 in intensity and were considered related to the 
study drug. One patient in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg treatment group experienced pyrexia and dyspnoea 
but recovered from the events after taking paracetamol and oxygen therapy. In the Placebo group, one 
patient experienced hypotension and the other experienced itch and rash. They recovered from the 
event without any medication.

Other Safety Parameters 
In Studies CT-P59 1.1, CT-P59 1.2, and CT-P59 3.2 Part 1, there were no clinically notable 
abnormalities reported from other safety assessments, including vital signs, hypersensitivity reaction 
monitoring, ECG, and physical examination, following study drug administration. 
There were no ADA-positive results reported at post-treatment visit up to Day 90 and up to Day 90 for 
Studies CT-P59 1.1 and CT-P59 1.2. In Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 1, there were 3 (3.0%) patients with 
positive ADA conversion in the 40 mg/kg regdanvimab group, 8 (7.3%) patients in the 80 mg/kg 
regdanvimab group and 6 (5.6%) patients in the placebo group. In study 3.2 part 2, there were 10 
(1.6%) ADA positive patients in the 40 mg/kg regdanvimab group, and 15 (2.4%) patients in the 
placebo group. 
For additional safety assessments in Studies CT-P59 1.2 and CT-P59 3.2, there were no significant 
safety issues with regards to SARS-CoV-2 infection related signs and symptoms assessments and there 
were no patients reported with suspicious antibody-dependent enhancement of disease.  
2.5.7.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Other than 1 unrelated treatment-emergent serious adverse event (TESAE) of limb injury which 
occurred 36 days after the study drug administration in the regdanvimab 20 mg/kg treatment group of 
Study CT-P59 1.1, no TEAEs were considered as serious and no deaths were reported in Studies CT-
P59 1.1, CT-P59 1.2 and CT-P59 3.2 Part 1. 
In Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2, 5 TESAEs were reported in 5 (0.4%) patients overall (4 [0.6%] patients in 
the CT-P59 40 mg/kg treatment group and 1 [0.2%] patient in the Placebo group). There were no 
TESAEs reported for >1 patient in either treatment group. TESAE considered by the Investigator to be 
related to study drug was IRR (1 [0.2%] patient, Grade 2) in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg treatment group, 
and all other TESAEs were considered by the Investigator to be unrelated to study drug.

2.5.7.4.  Laboratory findings 
Study CT-P59 1.1 (Healthy Subjects) 
The majority of patients had no CTCAE grade (the post baseline laboratory result did not satisfy any 
CTCAE grade), or CTCAE grade 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) for each laboratory parameter and each 
subsequent time point. There were no laboratory test results of grade 3 or above per CTCAE grading. 
There was no notable trend in the laboratory abnormalities within or between CT-P59 and the Placebo 
groups. No dose-dependent relationship was observed for the laboratory abnormalities across the CT-
P59 treatment groups. 
Study CT-P59 1.2 (Mild COVID-19 Patients) 
The majority of patients had no CTCAE grade, or CTCAE grade 1 (mild) for each laboratory parameter 
and each subsequent time point.  
CTCAE grade 4 (hypocalcaemia and hypertriglyceridemia) clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
parameters were reported in 2 patients (1 [20%] patient in each of the CT-P59 20 mg/kg and CT-P59 
40 mg/kg treatment groups).  
One patient in the CT-P59 20 mg/kg treatment group had CTCAE grade 4 hypocalcaemia on Day 14 
(calcium of 0.9 mmol/L; normal range of 2.15 to 2.525 mmol/L). The Investigator considered the 
laboratory result as not clinically significant and the patient’s calcium level increased to normal range 
on Day 28 (calcium of 2.2 mmol/L) without any medication.  
One patient in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg treatment group had CTCAE grade 4 hypertriglyceridemia on Day 
10 (triglycerides of 13.097 mmol/L; normal range of 0.17 to 1.695 mmol/L) and it was reported as a 
TEAE and considered to be recovering at the end of the study (triglycerides of 6.272 mmol/L on Day 
90) by the Investigator. The patient didn’t take any medication related to the event during the 
treatment period. The event was considered to be worsening of patient’s existing medical history of 
hypertriglyceridaemia.

Given the very limited study size the rates of laboratory abnormalities should be interpreted with 
caution. ALT elevations and hypocalcaemia are frequently seen in covid-19 patients.

Overall, laboratory parameters are very similar between treatment groups and the placebo group. 
However, a few imbalances are observed: 
•  CPK elevations appear more common in the treatment groups, with 4.6% vs 2.7% grade 3-4 
elevations in the pooled treatment group vs placebo. Severe neutropenia appear more 
common in the treatment groups, with 11.6% vs 7.3% grade 3-4 decreases in the pooled 
treatment groups vs placebo.

Overall, laboratory abnormalities are similar between the treatment group and placebo group except 
for a few instances where abnormalities are seen more frequently in the placebo group. Grade 3-4 CPK 
elevations are seen slightly more frequent in the treatment group compared to placebo. There are no 
signs of a causal relation between regdanvimab treatment and transaminitis, neutropenia or 
hypocalcaemia where some imbalances were seen in the smaller studies.

2.5.7.6.  Immunological events 
See section above on adverse events of special interest for data in infusion-related reactions. 
There were no ADA-positive results reported at post-treatment visit up to Day 90 and up to Day 90 for 
Studies CT-P59 1.1 and CT-P59 1.2, respectively. 
In Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 1, the number of patients with the positive ADA conversion after study drug 
administration up to Day 90 was 3 (3.0%), 8 (7.3%), 11 (5.2%) and 6 (5.6%) in the CT-P59 40 
mg/kg, CT-P59 80 mg/kg, pooled CT-P59 and Placebo groups, respectively. In Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 
2, the proportions of patients with the positive ADA conversion after study drug administration up to 
Day 28 were 1.6% and 2.4% in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg and Placebo groups, respectively. Among the 
patients with positive conversion in ADA, IRR was reported only for 1/10 (10%) in the CT-P59 40 
mg/kg in Study CT-P59 3.2 Part 2. 
Interestingly, the levels of anti-drug antibodies were higher in the placebo groups. This suggest that 
this is non-specific reactivity rather than a specific humoral response triggered by regdanvimab 
exposure. There were no patients with suspicious antibody-dependent enhancement of disease in any 
of the studies. 
2.5.7.7.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation in any of the clinical studies. 
2.5.7.8.  Post marketing experience 
As of 16 Jul 2021, post-marketing cumulative exposure to CT-P59 is estimated at approximately 8,457 
patients in Republic of Korea. Among the 8,457 patients, 15 SAEs were reported in 8 (0.09%) patients 
overall, and most of the events were recovered with the exception of one patient. One case of 
suspected anaphylaxis was reported in a hospitalized patient who presented with dyspnoea, chest 
discomfort and cough during CT-P59 infusion; the infusion was immediately discontinued, and the 
patient received epinephrine. Thereafter, the patient was moved to intensive care unit and died the 
next day.  
The post-marketing experience with almost 8500 doses administered provides some additional insight 
on the safety profile of regdanvimab. The SAEs reported are difficult to interpret, given that several of 
the events could have been caused by progression of covid-19 disease (from mild to moderate disease 
which is the intended target group for the emergency use approval in South Korea), but the timing in 
relation to administration could give further insight. The Applicant has provided narratives for the SAEs 
showing alternative causes of events for most cases. However, anaphylaxis should be listed in section 
4.8 of the SmPC. The applicant argued that there was no numerical excess of urticaria cases, and that 
one of the two cases can be explained by a transfusion reaction. Therefore, they considered that 
urticaria should not be listed. This was accepted. However, the applicant agreed with addition of 
anaphylaxis and infusion-related reactions (IRRs) in Section 4.8 of the EU SmPC. Therefore, IRRs have 
been added to the tabulated list of adverse reactions in Section 4.8 and one anaphylactic case reported 
from post-marketing experience has been described in ‘Infusion-related reactions’ section.

2.5.8.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Regdanvimab is a mAb with a non-host target and no effector function. As such, the safety profile is 
anticipated to be characterised mainly by potential immune- or hypersensitivity reactions. Across the 3 
studies with CT-P59, 906 subjects received at least 1 dose of CT-P59. Of these, 889 received the 
proposed single dose of 40 mg/kg or more, and 882 were infected with Sars-Cov-2. 
Overall, the safety profile of regdanvimab appears favourable, in line with what is expected from a 
monoclonal antibody targeting a viral protein, and with no intrinsic effector function.  
No excess of infusion related reactions has been shown, but this remains a potential risk which 
requires monitoring. Despite the size of the safety database, delineated above, it cannot be excluded 
that more uncommon adverse drug reactions have not been detected. 
Cases of transaminitis, hypocalcaemia and neutropenia were reported in both regdanvimab and 
placebo-treated patients. Events are overall balanced between treatment and placebo groups and are 
more likely related to the underlying covid-19 disease than causally related to regdanvimab treatment. 
However, there remains an imbalance in cases of creative phosphokinase elevations in the grade 3-4 
AE reporting from the CT-P59 3.2-part 2 study. 
There were 1 and 2 deaths in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively. The cause of 
death was in all cases assessed as related to worsening of COVID-19. 
The program has not provided any indication of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. 
However, the sensitivity to detect such events, if rare, may be questioned. 
2.5.9.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of regdanvimab appears favourable, in line with what is expected from a 
monoclonal antibody targeting a viral protein, and with no intrinsic effector function.  
2.6.  Risk Management Plan 
2.6.1.  Safety concerns 
The Applicant has submitted a RMP version 0.8 including the following summary of safety concerns:

acceptable 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 112/113 
 
 
 
 
 
Missing information:  
Use during pregnancy: The safety of regdanvimab in pregnant women is not known and no studies of 
regdanvimab have been conducted in pregnant women. Listing “Use during pregnancy” as missing 
information is supported. 
Long-term safety data: Based on the limited number of patients exposed to CT-P59 in Study CT-P59 
1.2 the Applicant has proposed “Long-term safety data” as missing information. This is acknowledged 
and acceptable. Study CT-P59 3.2 is still ongoing and long-term data will be presented at a later stage. 
2.6.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities 
Routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  beyond  adverse  reactions  reporting  and  signal 
detection:  the  applicant  has  proposed  the  implementation  of  Specific  adverse  reaction  follow-up 
questionnaires for lack of efficacy (LOE). 
Lack of efficacy report form will be provided to reporters once lack of efficacy is received via individual 
case safety reports (ICSRs) from post-marketing data sources, in order to obtain structured information 
of lack of efficacy including reaction information, patient demographics, treatment information such as 
dose, route, therapy date and batch number, concomitant medications, medical history, product-related 
complaints, immunogenicity information and investigational result regarding genetic variations of virus. 
This form is intended to see if the reported lack of efficacy is associated with emerging  variants. The 
information regarding lack of efficacy due to emerging variants will be retrospectively collected and will 
be properly reflected into each ICSR as follow-up information. 
Monitoring of data on treatment failure due to emerging variants: 
As part of the enhanced signal detection activities for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, data on 
treatment failure due to emerging variants are to be monitored from all available data sources, including 
but not limited to 
•  Spontaneous  cases  (via  targeted  follow-up  questionnaire  for  LOE  including  fields  to  request 
information on the variant) 
•  Clinical trial data 
• 
Literature 
•  Reports received from regulatory authorities 
If the review of the data identifies an impact on the benefit-risk profile of regdanvimab, the data will be 
submitted  to  EMA,  including  a  benefit-risk  discussion  and  any  warranted  product  information  updates 
within 1 month via appropriate variation procedure. Additionally, the cumulative data will be summarised 
in the PSUR. 
Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities:  
A new variant of concern or variant of interest newly classified by the Agencies (i.e. WHO; World Health 
Organization, PHE; Public Health England, CDC; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and etc.) or 
any newly emerging variants will be continuously monitored, and their risk will be assessed. If the risk 
is identified, non-clinical studies to characterise regdanvimab in relation to the variant in question will 
be initiated.

Additional pharmacovigilance activities 
The Applicant proposes the following 3 studies to further evaluate safety and to address missing 
information in the post marketing setting. There is one interventional study and two non-interventional 
studies.

2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The package leaflet has been evaluated via a user consultation study in accordance with the 
requirements of Articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The language used for the purpose 
of user testing the PL was English.  
Furthermore, we can confirm that an addendum regarding layout discussion from the user consultation 
has been assessed and found acceptable. Hence, user consultation issue solved.  
2.8.2.  Labelling exemptions  
The following exemptions from labelling requirements have been granted on the basis of article 63.3 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC.  
In addition, the derogations granted should be seen in the context of the flexibilities described in the 
Labelling flexibilities for COVID-19 therapeutics (EMA/35618/2021, from 12 March 2021) document 
which aims at facilitating the preparedness work of COVID-19 therapeutics developers and the 
associated logistics of early printing packaging activities. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the large 
scale and rapid deployment of COVID-19 therapeutics for EU citizens within the existing legal 
framework.  
1. Use of minimum particulars for the vial label. Based on the limited space of the vial label, the QRD 
group agreed to the use of minimum labelling requirements to ensure the legibility of the essential 
information for the safe and effective use of the medicine. 
2. Outer and immediate labelling will be printed in English only. 
3. Package leaflets will be printed in English only except for the leaflets for the following Member 
States: Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic and Greece. For the latter the package leaflet in the 
respective national languages will be separately distributed alongside the supply of Regkirona. 
For the rest of the Members States which will receive the package leaflets printed in English, this will 
be included in the carton pack. 
Alternative access to the package leaflet in the national languages of the Member States, where the 
medicinal product is marketed, will be provide via a QR code included in the printed package leaflet 
and the outer packaging. 
4. Omission of country specific blue box requirements and use of one Global Trade Identification 
Number (GTIN) for serialization. 
The duration of the exemptions will be limited to 6 months after the granting of the marketing 
authorisation. 
2.8.3.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling and the package leaflet for the purpose of providing 
information to Healthcare Professionals and patients has been submitted by the applicant and has been 
found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 116/117 
 
 
 
 
- 
package leaflet in all EU/EEA languages of the member states where the medicinal product is 
marketed. Healthcare professionals and patients will be able to access the information either 
by means of a smartphone/device or by typing the URL in an internet browser, if they do not 
have a smartphone/device.  
- 
the blue box information where required.  
The product information for circulation on the 3rd Nov has been updated with the URL for the QRD 
code (PL) in line with the Rapporteurs previously made comment as well as agreed according to the 
response from the Applicant.  
2.8.4.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Regkirona (regdanvimab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
As regards to the legal status, the CHMP endorsed a medical prescription status in the context of the 
pandemic situation to allow appropriate flexibility for the access and administration of the medicinal 
product under the appropriate monitoring recommendations provided in the product information. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Regdanvimab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of 
the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of therapy is to prevent the deterioration of patients to 
severe COVID, including a need for hospitalisation or oxygen therapy. 
The presently sought indication is: 
Regdanvimab is indicated for the treatment of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who 
do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 
(see section 5.1). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The novel SARS-CoV-2 was initially identified during an outbreak of atypical viral pneumonia cases of 
unknown aetiology in China in December 2019.  Subsequently this has emerged as the cause of the 
global Covid-19 pandemic. 
Most people with SARS-CoV-2 infection develop only mild or moderate disease (WHO Interim Guidance 
on Clinical Management of COVID-19, 2020). However, some individuals develop severe disease that 
requires oxygen support, and some have critical disease with complications such as respiratory failure, 
acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021

failure, including acute kidney injury, and cardiac injury. Older age, smoking and underlying 
noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic lung disease, and 
cancer have been reported as risk factors for severe disease and death. 
While mAbs with the present mechanism of action, and for the presently proposed use in outpatients 
with covid-19 to prevent deterioration, have been made available in EU countries based on various 
forms of temporary authorisation, there are no drugs for such use approved in the EU by regular 
procedure. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant has conducted A Phase 2/3, Randomized, Parallel-Group, Placebo-Controlled, Double-
Blind Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of CT-P59 in Combination with Standard of Care in 
Outpatients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Infection. 
The confirmatory part 2 of the study tested the hypothesis that regdanvimab given to outpatients with 
early disease might reduce the risk of hospitalisation or severe disease. 
In this, patients were screened at 60 study centres across, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, North 
Macedonia, Peru, Poland, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldavia, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Ukraine and 
United States. The study period for the pivotal part 2, was from 18 January 2021 (first patient’s study 
drug administration date) to 21 May 2021 (last patient’s Day 28 visit). Approximately 85% of patients 
were treated in the EU; the majority of the rest in the US. 
The study included outpatients aged 18 or above. Patients had to have oxygen saturation >94% on 
room air, not requiring supplemental oxygen, and onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated symptom 
no more than 7 days prior to the study drug administration. The key exclusion criterion was signs of 
severe COVID. Furthermore, patents were required to be unvaccinated for Sars-Cov-2. 
Patients were randomised to receive a single dose of 40 mg/kg of regdanvimab, or placebo. 
The Primary Efficacy Endpoint was the proportion of patients with clinical symptom requiring 
hospitalisation, oxygen therapy, or experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to Day 28 in 
high-risk patients 
“High-risk patients” met at least one of the following criteria: 
•  Advanced age (Age >50 years) 
•  Obesity (body mass index [BMI]>30 kg/m2) 
•  Cardiovascular disease, including hypertension 
•  Chronic lung disease, including asthma 
• 
Type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus 
•  Chronic kidney disease, including those on dialysis 
•  Chronic liver disease 
• 
Immunosuppressed.  
About 2/3 of recruited patients were over age 50 or had other recognised risk factors for severe 
COVID-19; however only two patients were classified as “immunosuppressed”. 87% of patients had 
negative serology for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
In patients with high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19, the proportion of patients with clinical 
symptoms requiring hospitalisation, oxygen therapy or experiencing mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 
infection up to Day 28 was significantly lower in the regdanvimab group (14/446 [3.1 %]) compared to 
the Placebo group (48/434 [11.1 %]). The difference between the proportions was statistically 
significant (p<0.0001 [stratified CMH test]; estimated difference [95% CI] = -8.0 [-11.7, -4.5]). 
The median time to clinical recovery (at least 48 hours) in high-risk patients was 9.27 days in 
regdanvimab group, but the median time was not reached in Placebo group as less than 50% of 
patients in this group achieved clinical recovery up to Day 14 (48.8%). The difference in time to clinical 
recovery between treatment groups was statistically significant (p<0.0001 [stratified log-rank test]; 
clinical recovery ratio [95% CI] = 1.58 [1.31, 1.90]) 
The time to negative virological conversion (<2.33 log10cp/mL as negative) up to Day 28 by RT-qPCR 
of nasopharyngeal swabs was shorter in the regdanvimab group than the Placebo group (median, 
11.89 and 13.13 days in the regdanvimab and Placebo groups, respectively). The differences in time to 
negative conversion between the two treatment groups was significant (p<0.0001 [stratified log-rank 
test]; negative conversion ratio [95% CI] = 1.48 (1.30, 1.67)). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Clinical efficacy against the presently circulating delta variant 
At the time of the pivotal study, the circulating variants in the study region were predominantly wild-
type and alpha. Therefore, clinical efficacy in patients infected with the delta variant was not shown. 
In vitro neutralising activity was shown against the wild type virus as well as for the UK variant (Alpha, 
B.1.1.7). However, regdanvimab has reduced neutralising activity against South Africa (Beta, 
B.1.351), Brazil (Gamma, P.1), California (B.1.427 and B.1.429) and India (Kappa B.1.617.1 and 
Delta, B.1.617.2) variants in the PRNT and pseudovirus assays. Particularly, there was a 183-fold shift 
in susceptibility for the delta variant (B.1.617.2. in a PRNT assay with the authentic virus).  
The reported the IC90 value in vitro for the wild type virus is 28 ng/mL. The highest reported IC90 
value in vitro is for the Beta 1.351 (South African) virus variant: 16550 ng/mL. 
The applicant has provided measured estimates of plasma concentrations and IC50 values for the delta 
variant, along with literature-based estimates of the lung concentration at 15% and 5% of the serum 
concentration. 
The serum and estimated lung concentration at 96h post dose assuming 15% lung penetration are 
approximately 380000 ng/mL and 57000 ng/mL, respectively. At a more conservative estimate of 5% 
lung concentration, the 96h lung concentration would be approximately 19000 ng/mL. Thus, 
concentrations of regdanvimab in lungs would be estimated above the IC90 in vitro for all listed virus 
variants during the presumably crucial initial treatment phase. However, the (plasma or lung 
concentration/ in vitro susceptibility) quotient required for clinical efficacy has not been characterized. 
Furthermore, it is not clear that this is similar for all VOC’s, given e.g. differences in viral replication 
rates. 
The applicant has provided data from a Ferret model infected with the Gamma (B.1.351) variant, and 
from a ACE2 transgenic mouse model infected with Beta (P.1.), Gamma as well as Delta (B.1.617.2) 
virus, treated with human equivalent doses as post exposure prophylaxis. These studies are indicative 
of antiviral effects. However, the clinical implications are not completely known, since the 
Assessment report  
EMA/679271/2021  
Page 119/120 
 
 
 
 
predictiveness of the models have not been established, and it is not known whether PK/PD is similar 
in these models and in humans. 
Moreover, the applicant has submitted top line data from the 4.1. study, which is a post marketing 
cohort performed in South Korea. In this, patients are hospitalised with moderate covid at baseline. 
Among 330 patients known to have delta- or non-delta variants, disease progression rate was 
approximately 20% regardless of viral strain. It is evident from the substantially risk of progression to 
severe disease, that this cohort differs from the population in study 3.2. Thus, we lack an index of 
regdanvimab efficacy in this population. Altogether these data are compatible with clinical efficacy 
against the delta variant, but they do not demonstrate it. 
In summary, PK/PD data, animal model data, as well as post marketing data from South Korea are 
compatible with activity also against the delta variant, for which in vitro susceptibility is decreased. 
Clinical efficacy against the delta variant, however, has not been demonstrated. 
Efficacy in the immunocompromised 
There is no index of efficacy in patients that are “immunosuppressed”. It is assumed on a mechanistic 
basis that there will be relevant efficacy in such patients. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Across the 3 studies with CT-P59, 906 subjects received at least 1 dose of CT-P59. Of these, 889 
received the proposed single dose of 40 mg/kg or more, and 882 were infected with SARS-CoV-2. 
Regdanvimab is a mAb with a non-host target and no effector function. As such, the safety profile is 
anticipated to be characterised mainly by potential immune- or hypersensitivity reactions. No excess of 
infusion related reactions has been shown, but this remains a potential risk which requires monitoring.  
There were 1 and 2 deaths in the CT-P59 40 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively. The cause of 
death was in all cases assessed as related to worsening of COVID-19. The program has not provided 
any indication of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Despite the size of the safety database, it cannot be excluded that more uncommon adverse drug 
reactions have not been detected. 
The sensitivity of the study program to detect potential, rare events of antibody dependent 
enhancement of disease (ADE) may be questioned.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A clinically relevant reduction in the risk of disease deterioration requiring hospitalisation and/or 
oxygen therapy, in outpatients with covid-19 infection that do not yet have severe disease, but are at 
risk for such, has been demonstrated for regdanvimab. 
As outlined above, in the section on uncertainties on favourable effects (section 3.3.), the delta 
variant, which displays a 183-fold reduction in in vitro susceptibility (authentic virus, PRNT assay) was 
not circulating at the time and in the regions of the pivotal trial. Consequently, an inference of efficacy 
must be based on PK/PD, animal model data, and post marketing data from Korea. While these taken 
together are supportive of efficacy, this has not been shown, and the inference of efficacy is therefore 
fraught with uncertainty. Consequently, the following wording is implemented in the SmPC section 4.4: 
“The clinical trials with regdanvimab were conducted in subjects who were predominantly infected with 
the wild-type virus and the Alpha (UK origin/B.1.1.7 lineage) variant. Clinical efficacy data for

regdanvimab against some circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants with decreased susceptibility in vitro is 
currently limited (see section 5.1).” 
The Applicant has stated that it intends to monitor emerging variants continuously. In case a new 
variant of concern (VoC) or variant of interest (VoI) classified by the Agencies (i.e. WHO, PHE, CDC 
and etc.) or any variant is found in South Korea, the Applicant will determine their risk and initiate 
studies to characterize regdanvimab in relation to the variant in question. This should be included in 
part III of the RMP.  
Overall, the safety profile of regdanvimab is favourable, in line with what is expected from a 
monoclonal antibody targeting a viral protein, and with no intrinsic effector function.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The demonstrated benefits outweigh the risks. Data include a decently sized randomised controlled 
trial and are deemed comprehensive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Regkirona is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Regkirona is favourable in the following indication: 
“Regdanvimab is indicated for the treatment of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who 
do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 
(see section 5.1)”. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that regdanvimab is to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously 
authorised within the European Union.

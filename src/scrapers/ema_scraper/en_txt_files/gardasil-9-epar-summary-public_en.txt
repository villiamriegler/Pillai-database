EPAR summary for the public 
Gardasil 9 
human papillomavirus 9-valent vaccine (recombinant, adsorbed) 
This is a summary of the European public assessment report (EPAR) for Gardasil 9. It explains how the 
Agency assessed the medicine to recommend its authorisation in the EU and its conditions of use. It is 
not intended to provide practical advice on how to use Gardasil 9. 
For practical information about using Gardasil 9, patients should read the package leaflet or contact 
their doctor or pharmacist. 
What is Gardasil 9 and what is it used for? 
Gardasil 9 is a vaccine used in males and females from the age of nine years to protect against the 
following conditions caused by nine types of the human papillomavirus (HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 
33, 45, 52 and 58): 
• 
• 
precancerous lesions (growths) and cancers in the cervix, vulva or vagina and anus; 
genital warts. 
Gardasil 9 is given according to official recommendations. It contains purified proteins from the nine 
types of HPV listed above.  
How is Gardasil 9 used? 
Gardasil 9 is a suspension for injection available in vials or prefilled syringes. Gardasil 9 is normally 
given according to a either a two-dose schedule or a three-dose schedule for males and females from 9 
to 14 years old and a three-dose schedule for males and females 15 years old and over. For a two-
dose schedule, the second dose should be given between five and thirteen months after the first dose. 
For a three-dose schedule, the second dose should be given two months after the first and the third 
given four months after the second. There should always be at least one month between the first and

the second doses, and at least three months between the second and the third, and all doses should be 
given within a year. 
It is recommended that individuals who receive the first dose of Gardasil 9 should complete the dosing 
regimen using this medicine. The vaccine is given as an injection into a muscle, preferably in the 
shoulder or the thigh. 
The vaccine can only be obtained with a prescription.  
How does Gardasil 9 work? 
Human papillomaviruses are viruses that cause warts and abnormal tissue growth. There are more 
than 100 types of papillomavirus, some of which are associated with anogenital cancers in both men 
and women. Nearly 100% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV infection. In Europe, approximately 
90% of anal cancers, 15% of vulvar cancers, 70% of vaginal cancers, and 30 to 40% of penile cancers 
are estimated to be caused by HPV infection. HPV types 16 and 18 cause a large majority of cervical 
and anal cancers, while HPV types 6 and 11 cause most of genital warts. A further 5 HPV types (31, 
33, 45, 52, and 58) also carry a high risk for developing cancer (they cause around 20% of cervical 
cancers). 
All papillomaviruses have a shell, or ‘capsid’, that is made up of proteins called ‘L1 proteins’. Gardasil 9 
contains the purified L1 proteins for the nine HPV types above, produced by a method known as 
‘recombinant DNA technology’. The proteins are assembled in ‘virus-like particles’ (structures that look 
like HPV, so that the body can recognise them easily). These virus-like particles are not capable of 
causing infection or disease. 
When a patient is given the vaccine, the immune system makes antibodies against the L1 proteins. 
After vaccination, the immune system is able to produce antibodies more quickly when it is exposed to 
the real viruses. This will help to protect against the diseases caused by these viruses. 
The vaccine also contains an ‘adjuvant’, a compound containing aluminium to stimulate a better 
response. 
What benefits of Gardasil 9 have been shown in studies? 
Gardasil 9 can provide protection against all nine types of HPV infection, as seen in five main studies. 
The first study looked at the effectiveness of Gardasil 9 in over 14,000 women aged between 16 and 
26 years. The study looked at how many women given Gardasil 9 developed disease (growths or 
cancer) due to HPV infection caused by HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 when compared with Gardasil 
vaccine (a previously approved vaccine which protects against types 6, 11, 16 and 18). This study 
showed that 1 out of 6,016 women vaccinated with 3 doses of Gardasil 9 developed disease related to 
HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58, compared with 30 out of 6,017 women vaccinated with 3 doses of 
Gardasil. This study also showed that antibody levels against types 6, 11, 16 and 18 were adequate to 
protect against these four types of HPV infection. The women were followed up for around three and a 
half years after the third dose of the vaccine. 
The second study in 3066 subjects compared the effect of Gardasil 9 in girls and boys aged nine to 15 
years with the effect of Gardasil 9 in young women aged 16 to 26 years. The main measure of 
effectiveness was the development of antibodies against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 
58 one month after the third dose. The study showed that the vaccine stimulates the production of 
adequate levels of antibodies against HPV of all nine types in girls and boys aged between nine and 15 
years when compared with women 16-26 years of age, for whom protection against disease was 
demonstrated in the first study.

The third study compared the effect of Gardasil 9 with the effect of Gardasil in 600 girls aged 9 to 15 
years. The study looked at the development of antibodies one month after the third dose, and it 
showed that girls vaccinated with Gardasil 9 have similar levels of protection against types 6, 11, 16 
and 18 as girls vaccinated with Gardasil. 
The fourth main study compared the levels of antibodies against all nine HPV types one month after 
the third dose in around 1,419 young men aged 16 to 26 with those in 1,101 women aged 16 to 26. 
This study found that Gardasil 9 stimulates similar levels of protection against all nine virus types in 
young men and women. 
The fifth main study involving 1,518 subjects compared the effect of a two-dose schedule of Gardasil 9 
with a three-dose schedule. This study looked at the development of antibodies one month after the 
last dose, and it showed that boys and girls given two doses of Gardasil 9 have similar levels of 
protection against all nine virus types to girls and women given three doses of Gardasil 9. 
What are the risks associated with Gardasil 9? 
In studies, the most common side effects with Gardasil 9 (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) were 
reactions at the site of the injection (redness, pain and swelling) and headache. These side effects 
were normally mild or moderate. For the full list of all side effects reported with Gardasil 9, see the 
package leaflet. 
Patients who show signs of an allergy after a dose of Gardasil 9 (or of its precursor vaccines Gardasil or 
Silgard) should stop the vaccination course or should not receive Gardasil 9 at all. For the full list of all 
restrictions, see the package leaflet. 
Why is Gardasil 9 approved? 
The Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Gardasil 9’s 
benefits are greater than its risks and recommended that it be approved for use in the EU. The CHMP 
considered that Gardasil 9 offers a broader protection against cancer than its precursor Gardasil, since 
it protects against additional 5 new types of HPV (31, 33, 45, 52 and 58), which although less common 
than types 16 and 18, are also considered high-risk HPV types. Thus Gardasil 9 is expected to prevent 
the majority of cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers and premalignant lesions, as well as genital warts 
associated with HPV. Regarding side effects, although a large proportion of subjects develop injection 
site reactions, these are only slightly more than for Gardasil. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
Gardasil 9? 
A risk management plan has been developed to ensure that Gardasil 9 is used as safely as possible. 
Based on this plan, safety information has been included in the summary of product characteristics and 
the package leaflet for Gardasil 9, including the appropriate precautions to be followed by healthcare 
professionals and patients. 
Further information can be found in the summary of the risk management plan.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for teclistamab, the scientific 
conclusions of the PRAC are as follows: 
In view of available data on Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) from clinical 
trials and spontaneous reports including new symptoms of ICANS and in 6 cases of Grade 3 and higher 
ICANS with a close temporal relationship, and in view of a fact that ICANS is already known adverse 
reaction of teclistamab, the PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between teclistamab and 
new symptoms of ICANS and Grade 3 and higher ICANS is at least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC 
Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products containing teclistamab should be amended 
accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conslusions and 
grounds for recommendation.  
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for teclistamab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing teclistamab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

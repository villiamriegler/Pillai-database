2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam is proposed by the Applicant to be indicated for the treatment of infections 
due to aerobe Gram-negative microorganisms in adults with limited treatment options. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria continue to increase and limit the utility of existing 
antibacterial agents. Data from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report more than 2 
million cases of infection with resistant bacteria and at least 23,000 associated deaths in the United States 
every year (CDC 2013). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimate that nearly 
700,000 infections and 33,000 deaths in the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) in 2015 are a 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
consequence of MDR bacterial infection (Cassini et al. 2019). The burden has increased since 2007, was 
highest among infants and the elderly and was highest in Italy and Greece. Carbapenem-resistance (CR) in 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae contributed significantly to the number of estimated 
deaths (approximately 4,000 and 2,000, respectively) whereas the numbers of deaths estimated to be 
caused by infections caused by CR Escherichia coli was lower (~100) reflecting the lower incidence of CR in 
this species. In 2013 to 2014, the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) 
was the most widely disseminated carbapenemases across Europe (Grundmann et al. 2017). Metallo-beta-
lactamases such as New-Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) and Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-
lactamase (VIM) were detected to a lesser extent. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Multi drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms such as CR P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae are 
important pathogens in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including pyelonephritis, complicated 
intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated 
pneumonia (HAP/VAP) i.e. infections that are commonplace. Complicated UTIs are UTIs complicated by 
involvement of the upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis) or by underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities 
of the urinary tract. Common uropathogens causing cUTI are E. coli, other Enterobacteriaceae and P. 
aeruginosa. Complicated IAI is defined as the extension of an IAI beyond the organ of origin, causing 
peritonitis or abscess formation. Complicated IAIs are usually polymicrobial in nature and the major 
pathogens involved are usual residents of the gastrointestinal tract, including Enterobacteriaceae, 
streptococci, and certain anaerobes (particularly Bacteroides fragilis) but P. aeruginosa is also commonly 
encountered. HAP and VAP are, by definition, infections in hospitalised (or recently hospitalised) patients. 
Colonisation of the respiratory tract with a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria may lead to 
infection. Among the most commonly encountered pathogens in HAP/VAP are Staphylococcus aureus, 
Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Infections typically caused by aerobic Gram-negative organisms (cUTI, cIAI and HAP/VAP) are diagnosed 
based on clinical presentations and radiologic imaging in addition to microbiological investigations to 
characterise the pathogens causing the infections. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Beta-lactam antibacterial agents are commonly used to manage infections when they involve Gram-negative 
pathogens. Increasing resistance to beta-lactams, including the carbapenems, has led to some organisms 
being effectively untreatable or treatable only with resource to colistin with or without other agents to which 
they remain at least partly susceptible. Treatment emergent nephrotoxicity is of concern for colistin. 
Fosfomycin is active against beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. However, clinical data on the 
treatment of MDR bacterial infections with fosfomycin are limited. Tigecycline is another option for the 
treatment of beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative infections. However, tigecycline is not active against 
Pseudomonas spp. Moreover, safety concerns of an increased risk of death with tigecycline have limited its 
use. Newer beta-lactam/beta-lactamase (BL/BLI) combinations such as ceftolozane/tazobactam, 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
ceftazidime/avibactam and meropenem/vaborbactam are possible options for the treatment of some 
carbapenem resistant Gram-negative organisms but none of them are universal or active against class B 
(metallo-beta-lactamase) producers. Overall, there is still a high unmet medical need for additional 
antibacterial agents addressing carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative organisms. 
About the product 
Imipenem (IPM) is a carbapenem β-lactam antibacterial agent that inhibits bacterial cell-wall synthesis by 
targeting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs are enzymes involved in the last steps of peptidoglycan 
synthesis. IPM is not hydrolysed by, and thus stable to the majority of serine β-lactamases.  
Cilastatin (CIL) is a renal dehydropeptidase inhibitor that limits the renal metabolism of IPM. CIL does not 
have antibacterial activity. IMI (imipenem-cilastatin) has been authorised and used in the EU since the 
1980s. It has a spectrum that includes Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. It is given 
intravenously at doses up to 1 g q6h. 
Relebactam (REL) is a novel diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) β-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits a variety of 
Ambler class A and C but not class B and D β-lactamases. REL has no intrinsic significant antibacterial activity 
at clinically relevant doses. The role of REL in the FDC is to restore the activity of IPM in IPM-resistant gram-
negative infections when the resistance is caused by production of β-lactamases within the spectrum of 
REL´s inhibitory activity. 
Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam is proposed by the Applicant to be indicated for the treatment of infections 
due to aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms in patients 18 years of age and older with limited treatment 
options. 
The proposed posology is 500/500/250 mg q6h in patients with a creatinine clearance greater than or equal 
to 90 mL/min. Dosage adjustments are recommended in patients with renal impairment. 
Recarbrio is for intravenous use. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was not 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that although Recarbrio may 
have a somewhat different spectrum compared with recently approved β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor 
(BL/BLI) combinations, it does not represent a major therapeutic innovation per se.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam is a parenteral (IV) fixed dose combination (FDC) of relebactam, combined 
with imipenem/cilastatin developed by the Applicant for the treatment of serious infections caused by 
carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria. 
The finished product is supplied as is a parenteral fixed dose combination (FDC) presented powder for 
solution for infusion containing cilastatin, imipenem and relebactam as active substances in a vial. Each vial 
contains imipenem monohydrate equivalent to 500 mg of imipenem anhydrate, cilastatin sodium salt 
equivalent to 500 mg of cilastatin and relebactam monohydrate equivalent to 250 mg of relebactam 
anhydrite. 
The finished product is packaged in a 20 mL glass vial with a 20 mm rubber stopper and an aluminum flip-off 
seal. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Imipenem  
General information 
The  chemical  name  of  imipenem  is  (5R,6S)-3-[[2-(formimidoylamino)ethyl]thio]-6-[(R)-1-hydroxyethyl]-7-
oxo-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-ene-2-carboxylic  acid. 
It 
corresponds 
to 
the  molecular 
formula 
C12H17N3O4S•H2O, its relative molecular mass is 317.37 and it has the structure shown in Figure 1. Imipenem 
is a known active substance that has Ph. Eur. monograph available. Full information has been presented in the 
dossier concerning the manufacture of the active substance. 
Figure 1. Structure of imipenem monohydrate. 
The structure of the active substance (AS) was elucidated by a combination of ultra-violet spectrometry (UV), 
infrared spectroscopy (IR) and 13C- and 1H- nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The provided 
information supports the proposed structure of the substance and is considered acceptable for this 
compendial active substance. 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
Imipenem monohydrate is a white or almost white or pale yellow powder, slightly hygroscopic substance. It is 
slightly soluble in water and methanol. The pKa values for imipenem have been determined by aqueous 
acidic/basic potentiometric titration at 25°C. The respective pKa1 and pKa2 are ~3.2 and ~9.9. 
The molecule has three chiral centres and is optically active. All three stereogenic centre centres for imipenem 
originate from a starting material, the chiral purity of which is controlled by HPLC methods, which ensure control 
of potential chiral isomer impurities. Imipenem has only one known crystal form. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The synthesis is described in nine overall steps, eight of which comprise actual synthetic steps (bond 
breaking/formation) and the last an aseptic sterilisation step.  
The starting materials of imipenem sterile have been redefined following a request by the CHMP. The new 
proposed starting materials are considered acceptable according to the requirements of ICH Q11. Acceptable 
specifications have been set and the analytical methods used in the analysis of the starting materials have 
been described sufficiently.  
Critical process parameters with adequate limits have been identified. The in-process controls and their 
respective methods have been indicated and included in the relevant sections of the updated Module 3. Non 
isolated intermediates have been indicated and their control criteria for the use in next step specified. 
A discussion on the potential genotoxic impurities of the active substance was not provided. This is 
considered acceptable as the impurities from this route of synthesis are qualified by use. The control of 
residual solvents used in the process and possibly present as contaminants in the reagents used and in the 
designated starting materials has been discussed and included in the risk assessment of the starting 
materials and the proposed control strategy is acceptable. 
The description of the sterilisation process has been provided with sufficient detail. The validation study for 
sterile imipenem was completed on three production scale batches. The presented validation data for the 
process for the critical process steps are acceptable.  
The active substance packaging has been described.  
The packaging cans are sterilised and depyrogenated via a sufficiently described process. The PTFE used in 
manufacture of the gasket meets the EU foodstuff requirements of the regulation 10/2011, regulation 
1169/2011 for materials intended to come into contact with food. 
Specification 
Imipenem monohydrate (sterile) active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for assay 
(Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur.),   
identity (Ph. Eur.),  water content (Ph. Eur.), specific rotation (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash, pH (Ph. Eur.), sterility 
(Ph. Eur.), appearance characteristics (visual), residual solvents (GC), heavy metals (USP) and crystallinity 
(Optical Microscopy). 
The acceptance criteria and analytical methods for sterile imipenem are in line with the Ph. Eur. and include 
additional tests are performed to ensure the quality of the active substance. The control of impurities is in 
line with the Ph. Eur. monograph. 
Assessment report  
  
  
An  elemental  impurity  risk  assessment  was  performed  for  the  finished  product  (see  below  “Product 
Specification”),  as  per  ICH  Q3D.  For  all  elemental  impurities  the  results  were  either  less  than  the  limit  of 
detection or not detected at all. Consequently, no routine testing of elemental impurities in the active substance 
specification is required. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analysis data from three recently manufactured batches of imipenem sterile active substance were 
provided. All results met the acceptance criteria and consistent quality of the active substance has been 
demonstrated. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  three  commercial  scale  batches  of  active  substance  stored  in  the  intended  commercial 
packaging or equivalent for to 36 months under long term conditions 5°C ± 3°C/ambient humidity was provided 
according to the ICH guidelines.  
Parameters investigated: appearance characteristics, assay, impurities and water content. Results were 
within the specifications. No trends were observed. 
Stability  studies  of  non-sterile  imipenem  at  accelerated  short  term  conditions  of  25°C/60%  RH  have  been 
completed  to  assess  the  impact  of  excursions  during  transportation  to  the  sterilisation  site.  Non-sterile 
imipenem has been shown to be suitably stable for up to 7 days under conditions up to 25°C/60% RH to support 
limited excursions outside of refrigeration.  
No  stressed  or  accelerated  stability  studies  have  been  performed  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q1A  to  cover   
shipment, and subsequent use. The finished product manufacturing is performed at the same manufacturing 
site  as  the  sterile  imipenem  is  produced.  Since no  transportation of  sterile imipenem  will  take  place,  this  is 
acceptable. In addition, the applicant committed that formal accelerated stability studies at 25°C ± 2°C/60% 
RH ± 5% RH are planned for sterile imipenem for 6 months as per ICH; this together with the storage statement 
for  imipenem,  sterile  and  non-sterile,  ‘Store  and  transport  refrigerated’  which  has  been  included  in  the 
documentation is considered acceptable. 
Forced or photostability studies have not been performed, which is acceptable because according to the 
Ph.Eur. monograph the substance is not light sensitive. 
Based on the data provided, a retest period of 36 months for sterile Imipenem when stored at 5 °C ± 3 °C 
/Ambient Humidity is acceptable.

The chemical name of cilastatin is [Sodium (Z)-7-[[(R)-2-amino-2-carboxyethyl]thio]-2-[(S)-2,2-
dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido]-2-heptenoate. It corresponds to the molecular formula C16H25N2NaO5S, 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
its relative molecular mass is 380.44 and it has the structure shown in  Figure 3. Cilastatin is a known active 
substance that has Ph. Eur. monograph available. Full information has been presented in the dossier 
concerning the manufacture of the active substance. 
Figure 2. Structural formula of cilastatin sodium 
The molecular structure of cilastatin was elucidated by a combination of the following methods; ultra-violet 
spectrometry (UV), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and 13C- and 1H- nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(NMR). The provided information supports the proposed structure of the substance and is considered 
acceptable for this compendial active substance. 
Cilastatin sodium is an off-white to white hygroscopic amorphous powder, which is very soluble in water and 
methanol. The molecule contains two chiral centers and is optically active. Cilastatin sodium is fully 
amorphous, and no crystal forms have been identified.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The  synthesis  is  described  in  seven  overall  steps,  six  of  which  comprise  actual  synthetic  steps  (bond 
breaking/formation) and the last an aseptic sterilisation step.  The starting materials of cilastatin sodium sterile 
have  been  redefined  upon  the  request  of  the  CHMP.  The  new  proposed  starting  materials  have  been 
satisfactorily justified in line with ICH Q11 and are considered acceptable.  
The  critical  process  parameters,  in-process  controls  and  their  control  methods  have  been  updated  and  are 
considered  acceptable.  The  acceptance  criteria  for  raw  materials  used  in  cilastatin  sodium  sterile  active 
substance process have also been updated following the redefinition of the starting materials. 
Cilastatin sodium non-sterile intermediate (CNS) specifications have been updated and respective methods 
have been also described.  
Information on the quality and control of non-isolated intermediate was provided, whereas for the isolated 
intermediate downstream controls confirm appropriate process characterization and robustness therefore no 
further quality control or in-process requirements are required for the isolated intermediate; this is 
considered sufficient based on long-term experience in the manufacture of cilastatin sodium. These tests and 
the associated control strategy ensure that cilastatin sodium active substance meets its critical quality 
attributes. Overall the synthesis process can be considered acceptable. 
A comprehensive discussion on potential impurities that may be present in cilastatin sodium sterile based on 
the commercial manufacturing process, including reaction process-related impurities, synthetic intermediates, 
raw  materials,  potential  stereoisomers  (when  applicable),  compounds  which  may  form  as  a  result  of 
degradation has been provided. The control strategy applied for impurities originating from starting materials 
has been justified and can be accepted. Overall the presented discussion of the fate and the purge of impurities 
can be considered acceptable to assure the purity of cilastatin sodium sterile. 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
An adequate overview of the validation of sterilisation process critical points have been provided, including 
sterilisation of cilastatin manufacturing process equipment and components, sterilisation of containers, 
validation, and process simulations. The description of the sterilisation process has been provided with 
sufficient detail. The process validation study for sterile cilastatin was completed on three production scale 
batches. The presented validation data for the process for the critical process steps are acceptable.  
The active substance packaging has been described.  
The packaging cans are sterilised and depyrogenated via a sufficiently described process. The PTFE used in 
manufacture of the gasket meets the EU foodstuff requirements of the regulation 10/2011, regulation 
1169/2011 for materials intended to come into contact with food.  
Specification 
Cilastatin sodium (sterile) active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for assay (Ph. 
Eur.), related substances (Ph. Eur.), residual solvents (GC), water content (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. 
Eur.), degree of colouration (Ph. Eur.), specific rotation (Ph. Eur.), identity (Ph. Eur.), sodium precipitation 
(Ph. Eur.), opalescence (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). 
 The active substance specifications comply with the current Ph. Eur. Monograph. Additional non-compendial 
specifications were established after review of the capabilities of the analytical methodology and data 
generated on production batches. Two additional impurities have been included to the list of impurities 
Specified impurities level is not in line with ICH Q3A, however, it is considered toxicologically qualified by use. 
No elemental impurities are used in the manufacture of starting materials. Risk assessment according to ICH 
Q3D has been provided under finished product section (see below “Product Specification”). In addition, Class 
1, 2A and 3 metals were investigated in non-sterile cilastatin sodium. Based on these results, it can be 
concluded that there is no need to specify any elemental impurities in the specification of cilastatin active 
substance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.  
Batch analytical data from three production scale batches from the final sterile active substance 
manufactured by the proposed manufacturer have been provided. All results met the acceptance criteria and 
consistent quality of the active substance has been demonstrated. 
Stability 
Stability  data  on  three  commercial  scale  batches  of  active  substance  stored  in  the  intended  commercial 
packaging  or  equivalent  for  up  to  18  months  under  long  term  conditions  5°C  ±  3°C/ambient  humidity  was 
provided according to the ICH guidelines.  
Parameters investigated: appearance characteristics, assay, impurities and water content. Results were 
within the specifications. No trends were observed. 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
Cilastatin  non-sterile  is  shipped;  the  shipping  condition  is  supported  by  accelerated  stability,  which 
demonstrated modest increases in impurities and increases water content; no meaningful impact on cilastatin 
quality is anticipated during brief excursions above refrigerated storage conditions. 
No formal accelerated stability study was performed for sterile cilastatin sodium. It has been confirmed that 
sterile  cilastatin  sodium  is  not  transported  after  sterilisation  since  the  finished  product  manufacturing  is 
performed  at  the  same  manufacturing  site.  In  addition,  the  applicant  committed  that  formal  accelerated 
stability studies at 25°C ± 2°C/60% RH ± 5% RH are planned for sterile cilastatin for 6 months as per ICH. It 
has  been  confirmed  that  cilastatin  sodium  sterile  will  not  be  transported,  therefore  it  is  accepted  that  no 
additional storage statement is included covering transportation.  
No photostability or accelerated humidity studies were presented. As, according to Ph. Eur. monograph, 
cilastatin sodium is not light sensitive, the omission of photostability studies is considered acceptable. 
A retest period of 18 months when stored at 5°C ± 3°C/ambient humidity is accepted for the sterile 
substance. 
Relebactam 
General information 
The chemical name of relebactam hydrate is [(1R,2S,5R)-7-Oxo-2-(piperidin-1-ium-4-ylcarbamoyl)-1,6-
diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl sulfate hydrate. It corresponds to the molecular formula C12H20N4O6S · H2O, its 
relative molecular mass is 366.4 and it has the structure shown in Figure 5. 
Figure 3. Structural formula of relebactam hydrate 
The structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of ultra-violet spectrometry (UV), 
infrared spectroscopy (IR), mass spectrometry (MS), 13C- and 1H- nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(NMR) and X-ray powder diffraction. 
Relebactam is a white to off-white hygroscopic crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water, practically 
insoluble in isopropyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, and acetonitrile and very slightly soluble in methanol. 
It has three stereogenic centers. The stereocenters in relebactam are controlled in the starting material 
and/or defined during the synthesis. Chiral purity is controlled by a chiral HPLC method. 
Different polymorphs of relebactam were identified during polymorph screening and development. During 
routine relebactam manufacturing, the crystalline monohydrate is isolated exclusively from the commercial 
process. 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
Based on the information provided by the applicant, relebactam is considered to be a new active substance 
(NAS). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Relebactam monohydrate is obtained by 8 overall steps, seven of which comprise actual synthetic steps 
(bond breaking/formation) and the last an aseptic sterilisation step.  
An enhanced development program was executed in accordance with ICH Q9 and ICH Q11 for the 
manufacturing process of relebactam. Manufacturing operations perceived as a higher risk of impacting 
Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) or more likely to have multifactor interactions were studied in a systematic 
way by utilizing multifactor Design of Experiments (DOE) studies, first principles, prior knowledge, or a 
combination of these elements. Operations presenting lower risk or not expected to have multifactor 
interactions were studied with a traditional One Factor at A Time (OFAT) approach. The development studies 
led to the definition of the proven acceptable ranges for the manufacturing process. A design space is not 
claimed but instead ranges have been identified for operating parameters and conditions. 
The proposed commercial manufacturing process is described as Route 2. Earlier in the development a 
manufacturing route designated as ‘Route 1’ was used. The batches of relebactam manufactured according to 
‘Route 1’ have been used in pre-clinical, early clinical (Phase I and II), and safety studies. The details of 
process development history were provided. 
The characterisation of the AS and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on chemistry of new 
active substances. Impurities that may be present in the starting materials or intermediates were assessed 
for their impact on the downstream intermediates and on the quality of the relebactam active substance. The 
fate and purge of starting material and intermediates impurities are well understood and these impurities are 
controlled with individual impurity specifications which were set considering the fate and purge as well as the 
range of each impurity observed at pilot and commercial scale.  
The aseptic manufacturing process step has been justified and validation of the process has acceptably 
completed on three production scale batches.  
Relebactam is packaged in in a can sealed with a stopper with an. As no guidelines are established for quality 
requirements of metal containers the presented information can be accepted. The stopper complies with Ph. 
Eur. monograph 3.2.9. and an adequate specification has been provided. 
The primary relebactam packaging components are sterilised using a well described process. Non-sterile bulk 
is packaging has been described. The liner complies with Ph. Eur. monograph 3.1.4. The information on 
container-closure system used for non-sterile bulk is limited but can be accepted. 
Specification 
Relebactam monohydrate (sterile) active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for 
description (visual), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), specific rotation (polarimetry), residual solvents (GC), 
water content (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). 
The applied limits for each identified impurity have been justified adequately based on batch analysis data 
and toxicologically qualified. The limit for unidentified impurities is established in line with the ICH Q3A 
requirements.  
Assessment report  
  
  
Evaluation and control of potential mutagenic impurities (PMI) was performed in accordance with ICH M7. 
The manufacturing process from the starting materials to the active substance was evaluated for potential 
formation of mutagenic impurities. In addition, two steps of the starting material manufacturing process were 
also evaluated for mutagenic impurities. The acceptable intake was calculated based on maximum 1000 
mg/day dose (MDD). As the active substance is in hydrate form, the correct MDD is 1052 mg/day, however 
as the active substance is intended for short term use only to treat life-threatening conditions, the slight 
difference in calculated TTC value is not raised as a concern and the provided data is considered acceptable. 
A quality risk management approach, as per ICH 3QD, was conducted. Analysis of four batches 
manufactured, using the commercial process showed that levels of all Class-1 and Class-2A elements were 
less than 30% of the permitted daily exposure. Palladium was not detected (< 0.1ppm) in these batches but 
is controlled in an intermediate. Hence a test for elemental impurities is not considered necessary for release 
of active substance.  
Justifications for omitting tests for physical characteristics (polymorphic form or particle size distribution) 
based on batch data are also considered acceptable. 
Batch analyses data from 18 batches of relebactam used in clinical studies, safety studies and formal stability 
studies were provided. These include batches of relebactam using the former Route 1 and the remaining 
batches manufactured using the proposed Route 2 at commercial scale. The batch analysis data presented 
are within the acceptance criteria and confirm consistent active substance quality. 
Stability 
Stability data on four commercial scale (Route 2) batches of active substance stored in the intended 
commercial packaging for up to 36 months under long term conditions (25 °C / 60% RH), and for 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40 °C  / 75% RH) was provided according to the ICH guidelines.  
Parameters investigated: description, assay and impurities and water content. The analytical methods used 
for stability studies were the same as those provided at release. No significant changes were observed in any 
of the monitored parameters in any of storage conditions mentioned above.    
Forced degradation studies 
Additionally, forced stress studies were conducted under acidic, basic, oxidative, photolytic, and thermal 
stress conditions to induce the formation of potential degradation products and demonstrate the stability 
indicating nature of the HPLC analytical procedures.  Significant degradation occurred under acidic and 
caustic stress conditions. Minor degradation was observed under free radical oxidation stress; no degradation 
was observed under photolytic and thermal stress conditions. The stability indicating nature of the assay and 
impurity method has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Photostability  
Relebactam was also subjected to visible light and near ultra-violet light stress conditions according to the 
confirmatory conditions of ICH Q1B to demonstrate photostability of the active substance. The results from 
this study showed that relebactam is not susceptible to photo-degradation. 
Based on the provided data, the proposed retest period of 24 months for the active substance when stored in 
the proposed primary packaging without any special storage conditions, is considered acceptable

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is supplied as Imipenem/ Cilastatin /Relebactam powder for solution for infusion in a 
glass vial. Each vial of the finished product contains imipenem monohydrate to provide 500 mg of imipenem 
anhydrate equivalent, cilastatin sodium salt to provide 500 mg of cilastatin equivalent, relebactam 
monohydrate to provide 250 mg of relebactam anhydrate equivalent. The product contains 37.5 mg of 
sodium (1.6 mEq).   
The primary strategy of the finished product development program was to provide a chemically stable 
formulation with sterility assurance, while capitalising on the extensive manufacturing experience from the 
already authorised Cilastatin/Imipenem Intravenous Injection (Tienam). Cilastatin/Imipenem Intravenous 
Injection contains two of the three active substances, namely, imipenem and cilastatin. 
The Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) was defined and presented. Based on the QTPP the product critical 
Quality attributes have been determined. 
The finished product is presented as a combination of three sterile active substances and one sterile excipient 
in a single vial. The stability of the active substances drove the choice of the specific pharmaceutical form and 
the excipients. Sterilisation of excipients was sufficiently described. The different formulations used in early 
clinical development have been described. The final market formulation combined sterile relebactam with 
sterile imipenem/cilastatin into a single vial. This formulation was used to support Phase III trials, formal 
stability studies and commercial product. The choice of the sterilisation method has been well justified.  
Compatibility with Diluents 
Batches of the finished product (one from the beginning and one towards the end of its shelf-life) have been 
subjected for compatibility studies with three commonly used diluents; 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection; 5% 
Dextrose Injection; and mixture of 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection. Based on the available 
in-use study results, the product is unstable when reconstituted and diluted in proposed diluents in 
refrigerated or room temperature conditions. In all media a decrease in assay of imipenem and an increase in 
impurities were observed. Several degradation products, unique to the reconstituted and diluted product, 
arise in the admixture solutions. These impurities are not listed in the finished product specification because 
these are not relevant in the dry powder formulation. According to the applicant, the degree of degradation 
for imipenem and cilastatin in 5% Dextrose Injection or in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is similar to what 
was observed in the Tienam admixture solutions using the same diluents. In support of the claim, satisfactory 
comparative in-use stability results of current product with Tienam at release and the end of shelf-life has 
been presented within 2 hours in room temperature. The applicant aligns with the SmPC of Tienam, i.e., the 
diluted solutions should be used immediately, and the time interval between the beginning of reconstitution 
and the end of intravenous infusion should not exceed two hours. The product information has been amended 
accordingly. 
As already agreed in connection with Tienam product, the use of 5% glucose should be restricted to 
exceptional circumstances where 0.9% sodium chloride cannot be used for certain patients. The product 
information has been amended accordingly to reflect this. 
Compatibility with administrative devices materials and with other injectable drug products mentioned in the 
product information has also been demonstrated.  
Assessment report  
  
  
The finished product is packaged in glass vial, with stopper, and a seal with flip-off cap are suitable for their 
intended use. The primary packaging material complies with Ph. Eur. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product manufacturing process consists of standard unit operations and equipment for sterile 
powder production, and comprises the following steps: aseptic consolidation, blending and aseptic filling and 
sealing into a vial followed by inspection. The manufacturing process for Cilastatin/Imipenem/ Relebactam 
powder for solution for infusion uses conventional manufacturing techniques and equipment.  
Critical steps of the finished product manufacturing process have been defined and are controlled by suitable 
in-process controls. A bulk hold time has been established. 
Sterile Sodium Bicarbonate Manufacture 
Sterile  sodium  bicarbonate  is  produced  via  a  process  which  has  been  described  in  sufficient  detail  and  is 
controlled by appropriate controls and has been satisfactorily validated. 
The aseptic vial filling process has been successfully validated.  
The manufacturing process for Recarbrio powder for solution for infusion uses conventional manufacturing 
techniques and equipment. It is similar formulation, process, and uses the same commercial equipment as 
the Cilastatin/Imipenem Intravenous Injection. Based on batch analysis data gained on several pilot batches 
and one production batch scale and adequacy of in-process controls as well as previously experience from 
Cilastatin/Imipenem, it is considered acceptable that the full process validation will be performed prior to 
placing the product in the market is in line with the process validation guideline 
(EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/BWP/70278/2012-Rev1). The validation protocol has been provided and is 
acceptable. 
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for description 
(visual), identification (UV, HPLC), cilastatin assay (HPLC), imipenem assay (HPLC), relebactam assay 
(HPLC), cilastatin degradation products (HPLC),  imipenem degradation products (HPLC), relebactam 
degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), container closure integrity (vacuum 
decay leak test), water content (KF), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). The reconstituted 
solution is tested for completeness and clarity of solution (visual), particulate matter (Ph.Eur.), pH (Ph.Eur.) 
and colour (visual). 
The  acceptance  criteria  for  degradation  products  have  been  established  for  cilastatin,  imipenem,  and 
relebactam in the finished product, in accordance with the ICH guidance Q3B Impurities in New Drug Products 
for a product with a maximum daily dose of 10 mg to 2 g/day. 
The degradation products present in Recarbrio Powder for Injection have been qualified based on toxicology 
studies at levels that have demonstrated biological safety, according to ICH Q3B (R2) guidance. 
According  to  ICH  M7,  no  assessment  of  mutagenic  impurities  related  to  cilastatin  sodium  or  imipenem  is 
required  for  Cilastatin/Imipenem  Intravenous  Injection  as  it  has  been  in  the  market  since  1985.  The  only 
Assessment report  
  
  
  
relebactam related degradation is controlled as a regular impurity based on the negative results from AMES 
test. 
A quality risk management approach per ICH Q3D was conducted to assess the elemental impurities (EI) in the 
potential sources of Cilastatin/Imipenem/Relebactam Powder for Injection finished product, including excipient, 
active substances, water, manufacturing equipment, and container closure system. The worst-case maximum 
daily exposure for each potential elemental impurity in the product was determined to be below the control 
threshold of 30% of the PDE. Based on the presented risk assessment summary and available results, it can 
be  concluded  that there  is  no  need to  specify  any  elemental  impurities  in  the final  product,  in line  with the 
above guideline. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of finished 
product has been presented. 
Batch analysis data for 9 commercial scale batches of the finished product used in clinical and stability 
studies have been provided. All the test results were within the specification limits confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of finished product stored (both upright and inverted) for up 
to 24 months under long term conditions at 30°C/75%RH and for six months under accelerated conditions at 
40°C/75%RH according to ICH guidelines have been presented.  
The following parameters have been investigated: description, assay, degradation products, constitution time, 
colour and clarity of constituted solution, visible particles (constituted solution), pH, water, container closure 
integrity, particulate matter, physical stability (XRPD), sterility, and bacterial endotoxins. All results complied 
with the specifications. No significant stability trends were observed at any storage condition. 
Statistical analysis was applied to evaluate the product shelf-life, following the principles in ICH guideline Q1E. 
Linear regression was performed on the formal stability study batches, using the available assay stability data 
at 30°C/75%RH and results suggest a shelf life of at least 30 months. 
Photostability 
Three commercial scale batches were subjected to photostability stress testing under the conditions of ICH Q1B, 
Option 2. The samples were tested for description, assay, degradation products, constitution time, colour and 
clarity  of  constituted  solution,  visible  particles-constituted  solution,  pH,  moisture  and  particulate  matter. 
According  to  the  photostability  study,  the  product  is  demonstrated  to  be  sensitive  to  light  in  the  primary 
packaging. The product information has been updated accordingly. 
An alternate method of calculating the expiry date has been proposed based on the bulk hold stability study to 
begin when the blend is dispensed for packaging, provided the blend is not held for more than 3 months prior 
to packaging. The proposed alternative is in line with Q & A on stability issues of pharmaceutical bulk products 
use in manufacture of the finished product published by EMA and is therefore acceptable. Supporting stability 
data  for  two  commercial  scale  batches  was  presented.  The  blended  product  was  held  for  a  minimum  of  3 
months  and  processed  into  finished  product,  then  stored  24  months  at  the  long-term  storage  condition 
30ºC/75% RH, and for 6 months at accelerated conditions of 40ºC/75% RH. Available results remain within 
the acceptance limits and no trends were observed. 
Assessment report  
  
  
In-use stability 
In-use stability testing of the reconstituted finished product that was prepared and stored in accordance with 
the instructions was performed as part of pharmaceutical development. The study supports the diluents and 
conditions as stated in SmPC section 6.6. 
Based on the overall stability data, the claimed shelf life of 30 months without any special temperature storage 
conditions  and  with  the  recommendation  “Keep  vials  in  outer  carton,  in  order  to  protect  from  light“,  is 
acceptable (SmPC sections 6.3 and 6.4). 
Post approval change management protocol 
A change management protocol for relebactam has been submitted and is considered acceptable as the 
presented data is in line with the Q&A document EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/586330/2010 requirements.  
Adventitious agents 
None of the materials used in the manufacture of Recarbrio are of human or animal origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that from a quality 
perspective the product should have a satisfactory and uniform clinical performance. At the time of the CHMP 
opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio 
of the product. 
In the context of the on-going review under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 related to the 
potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-information-
nitrosamines-marketing-authorisation-holders_en.pdf, 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/referral/nitrosamines-emea-h-a53-1490-questions-answers-
information-nitrosamines-marketing-authorisation_en.pdf), MAHs of products containing chemically-
synthesized active substances are being asked to review their products for potential presence of nitrosamine 
impurities and to conduct risk evaluations/risk assessments as appropriate.  
No risk evaluation has been submitted for imipenem, cilastatin and relebactam in Recarbrio within the current 
procedure. Therefore, it is recommended that a risk evaluation on the potential risk of presence of 
nitrosamine in imipenem, cilastatin and relebactam in Recarbrio is conducted after the marketing 
authorisation, within six months of the publication of the call for review (19th September 2019). In the event 
that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is identified as a result of the risk evaluation, confirmatory testing 
should be carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive methods within 3 years of the publication of 
the call for review (19th September 2019), or at an earlier time if otherwise justified. If nitrosamine impurities 
are found to be present, appropriate risk mitigation steps should be implemented.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable and consistent. Physicochemical and biological 
aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled 
in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- to conduct formal accelerated stability studies for sterile imipenem for 6 months. In case there are any 
changes needed as a result, the documentation will be updated. To be submitted by the end of Q4 2020. 
- to conduct accelerated stability studies for cilastatin for 6 months and make changes to the storage 
statement if applicable. To be submitted by the end of Q2 2021. 
- it is recommended that a risk evaluation on the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in imipenem, 
cilastatin and relebactam in Recarbrio is conducted after the marketing authorisation by 19 March 2020). In 
the event that a risk of presence of nitrosamines is identified as a result of the risk evaluation, confirmatory 
testing should be carried out using appropriately validated and sensitive methods by 19 September 2022, or 
at an earlier time if otherwise justified. If nitrosamine impurities are found to be present, appropriate risk 
mitigation steps should be implemented. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant initially submitted a non-clinical overview that covered relebactam only. Responding to a CHMP 
request, during the assessment an updated non-clinical overview addendum regarding imipenem and 
cilastatin was also submitted and assessed. No new non-clinical studies were required for imipenem or 
cilastatin alone or in combination with relebactam. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
See clinical pharmacodynamics section further below. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Off-target effects of relebactam (REL) were screened for in a commercially available (MDS Pharma Service) 
standard panel of 163 potential secondary targets with receptors, transporters, ion channels and enzymes. 
REL at 10-100 µM (100 µM ~2.5-fold the clinical free fraction Cmax, 38 µM, at the RHD, 250 mg) did not 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
inhibit binding of any of the competitive ligands (inhibition defined as greater than 50% inhibition). For 
secondary pharmacodynamics evaluation of imipenem or cilastatin alone or in combination the applicant 
refers to the studies summarized in the safety pharmacology section.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Overall, there were no REL related effects of concern in the clinically relevant dose range on cardiovascular, 
respiratory or CNS functions observed in the safety pharmacology in vivo models.  
Cardiovascular effects were studied in vitro and in vivo under GLP conditions. In a whole-cell voltage- 
clamping of CHO cells stably expressing hERG, REL had no significant effect on hERG current relative to time-
dependent changes observed in the vehicle control, at a maximal testable actual concentration of 318 μM 
(~8-fold clinical free fraction Cmax, 38 µM). In a monkey telemetry study, no effects were observed on 
QT/QTc interval at Cmax (4460 μM) which was ~96-fold the clinical Cmax. In addition, there were no effects on 
haemodynamics (arterial blood pressure and heart rate) or on respiratory function or body temperature. The 
NOAEL was at highest dose tested, 225 mg/kg. 
Neurobehavioural effects of REL were studied by a Functional Observational Battery (FOB) carried out as a 
separate part, on 6 male rats/dose at 50, 150 and 450 mg/kg on day 1, in a one-month IV toxicity GLP 
study. There were no REL-related neurobehavioral findings observed in the FOB part of the study. However, 
REL-related convulsion-like activity, tremor, sternal recumbency, decreased activity, unsteady gait and/or 
pink to reddish-coloured urine staining and mortality were reported to occur shortly after dosing on study day 
1, in 2 out of 15 females (females were included in the 1-month repeat dose tox study but not in the FOB 
part). These adverse effects were observed at high Cmax concentrations (Cmax=6480 μM >100-fold the clinical 
Cmax, for the 450 mg/kg dose). The NOAEL was at 150 mg/kg (Cmax=2090 µM, ~40-fold to the clinical Cmax).  
Imipenem and cilastatin alone and in combination were evaluated in cardiovascular, respiratory, central 
nervous system and gastrointestinal system pharmacology studies. No cardiovascular or respiratory effects of 
concern were reported in these studies. 
CNS related findings as seizures and convulsion-like activity were observed in the safety pharmacology 
studies of imipenem in rabbit and rat at approximately 6 -10 times the maximum recommended daily human 
dose in imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam product (the convulsions reported in a repeat-dose toxicity study in 
rats conducted after the initial filing for imipenem-cilastatin). Cilastatin alone had no significant actions on 
the central nervous system.  
As also reported in the SmPC of Tienam and proposed imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam SmPC, CNS adverse 
reactions, such as seizures, confusional states and myoclonic activity, have also been reported in humans 
treated with imipenem/cilastatin, when recommended dosages of imipenem were exceeded. These reactions 
have been reported most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) 
and/or compromised renal function. Like other β-lactam antibiotics, imipenem seizurogenic potential has been 
attributed to inhibition of GABA binding to its receptor in the brain, increasing excitability. 
Imipenem and cilastatin alone or in combination had no effects of concern in the safety pharmacology 
evaluating the gastrointestinal system. Unformed stools were noted in the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats 
and monkeys. This is a common nonclinical finding in toxicity studies with antibiotics (including imipenem) 
due to pharmacology mediated changes in the normal intestinal flora. 
Assessment report  
  
  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed where the fixed dose combination IMI/REL 
was co-administered with any other drug substance. The Applicant based this strategy on the absence of 
concern in the REL safety pharmacology studies and the previously characterized pharmacology profiles of 
IMI. Cilastatin, that is designed for coadministration with imipenem, has no antibacterial activity of its own 
and does not interfere with the activity of imipenem when the 2 agents are combined.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods of analysis 
In single-dose PK studies, relebactam (REL) was measured in mice, rats, dogs and monkey plasma using a 
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection method following protein 
precipitation. LC-MS/MS methods, which were validated in accordance with GLP, were also used for 
determination of REL in the pivotal rat & monkey toxicology and rat & rabbit EFD studies. The lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ) for REL in the GLP plasma assays for mouse, rat, rabbit, and monkey plasma ranged 
from 10 to 30 ng/mL. The upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) of the GLP plasma assays ranged from 3,500 to 
10,100 ng/mL. The LC-MS/MS assay for rat milk had a LLOQ of 30 ng/mL and a ULOQ of 10,100 ng/mL. A 
method for determination of cilastatin and imipenem concentrations in monkey plasma was validated with a 
LLOQ of 99.8 ng/mL and a ULOQ of 39,600 ng/mL.   
Absorption 
Since REL is intended only for the intravenous route in the clinic, REL has accordingly been non-clinically 
evaluated only by the intravenous route. After a single IV administration of REL, plasma drug concentration 
rapidly declined in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. REL overall showed a low plasma clearance (6.2, 12.4, 3.4 
and 5.3 ml/min/kg), a small volume of distribution (0.3-0.4 L/kg) and a short half-life (0.9, 0.5, 1.2, and 0.8 
hr) in the four preclinical species tested.  
REL pharmacokinetics showed linearity after repeated intravenous administration in the toxicokinetic dose 
range tested in the 3-month intravenous toxicity study in monkeys (25-150 mg/kg). The mean systemic 
exposure (AUC0-24 hr) and mean Cmax values of REL were approximately dose proportional across the three 
dose groups on both Study Day 1 and in Study Week 13. Nevertheless, some irregular deviations from 
linearity were observed in in the other pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies, as described in the preclinical 
toxicology section. In addition, after repeat dosing, some decrease in systemic exposure was seen in the 1- 
or 3-month IV toxicity monkey studies. A 1.3- to 1.6-fold higher REL plasma exposure (AUC) was observed 
Study day 1 as compared to the corresponding exposure values in Study week 4 or week 13, respectively (for 
details, see the TK in the preclinical toxicology section). 
Since imipenem and cilastatin, as relebactam, are administered IV in the clinic, discussions of the 
pharmacokinetic properties of the two compounds were limited to IV PK only. Imipenem exhibited a low-to-
moderate plasma clearance (ranging from 6.23 mL/min/kg in dogs to 33.0 mL/min/kg in rabbits), and a short 
half-life (<1 hr) in nonclinical species. The pharmacokinetic profile of cilastatin indicated a half-life almost 
identical to that of imipenem, supporting the co-administration.  
Distribution 
The tissue distribution of REL was assessed in male albino (non-pigmented) Wistar- Hannover (WH) rats and 
pigmented Long-Evans (LE) rats by quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA). Following a 30-min IV 
Assessment report  
  
  
infusion of [14C]REL (28 mg/kg, ~100µCi/kg), radioactivity was rapidly and widely distributed, with most 
tissues in male WH rats reaching maximum concentrations (Cmax) at 0.5 hr post-infusion (the first sample 
collection time point). Tissues with the highest concentrations of radioactivity at Tmax were kidney cortex, 
kidney medulla, urinary bladder, oesophagus, blood, non-pigmented skin, aorta, oral mucosa, lung, and eye 
uveal tract, ranging from 29 to 315 μg equiv/g. The highest overall concentration of radioactivity was found 
in the urinary bladder contents (~932 μg equiv/g at 0.5 hr), consistent with renal excretion being the major 
elimination route. Brain, seminal vesicles, eye lens and bone were among the tissues with lowest 
concentrations of radioactivity (<1.5 μg equiv/g at Tmax). The low levels of radioactivity in the brain 
suggests REL is not prone to pass the blood brain barrier. The tissue concentration versus time profiles 
showed that radioactivity in tissues declined rapidly, consistent with the short half-life of the compound. A 
similar tissue distribution pattern between albino WH rats and pigmented LE rats indicated that [14C]REL-
derived radioactivity did not bind to melanin.  
[3H]REL displayed a low binding (~78-90% mean unbound) to mouse, rat, monkey, and human plasma 
proteins. Plasma protein binding was independent of REL concentration at 5 and 50 µM in all species. The 
equilibrium blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was ~0.6 in all tested species (mouse, rat, monkey, and 
human), indicating that REL does not preferentially distribute into red blood cells.  
Placental transfer of REL was investigated in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats and New Zealand White rabbits, 
following daily IV administration of REL at 450 mg/kg/day in rats on GD 6 through 20 and in rabbits on GD 7 
through 20. The ratios of foetal to maternal plasma concentration were ~0.05 in rats and ~0.03 to 0.06 in 
rabbits. The results suggest that REL has the ability to cross the placenta in both species, with the foetal 
plasma levels representing ~3-6% of the maternal plasma levels.  
The binding of imipenem and cilastatin to human serum proteins is low (~20% and ~40%, respectively). In 
rats following intravenous administration of radiolabelled imipenem, radioactivity was distributed primarily in 
the kidney, consistent with renal excretion being the elimination route. The disappearance of radioactivity in 
tissues parallels the disappearance profile from plasma. Tissue distribution of cilastatin in rats revealed no 
accumulation of radioactivity in any of the tissues, and the concentration of radioactivity in tissues appears to 
decrease in parallel with the disappearance profile of plasma radioactivity. 
Metabolism 
The in vitro stability of [3H]REL (10 μM) was evaluated in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) and in 
mouse, rat, monkey, and human plasma at 37°C over 4 hr. Data indicated <10% turnover in PBS and 
plasma. The metabolic turnover of [3H]REL (10 μM) was negligible in rat, monkey, and human hepatocyte 
suspensions following incubation at 37°C for 2 hr. Overall, minimal metabolism was observed for [3H]REL in 
vitro.  
The in vivo metabolism of REL was studied in male WH rats following IV administration of unlabelled REL at 4 
mg/kg. Two metabolites were identified by LC-MS in rat urine: M1, derived from cyclic urea hydrolysis with 
loss of CO2, and M2, derived from the reaction of ammonia with the cyclic urea moiety. The structures of M1 
and M2 were confirmed by comparing to synthetic standards based on the retention time and MS/MS 
fragmentations. The levels of REL and these two metabolites in urine were quantified by LC-MS/MS. About 
71.2% of the dose was recovered in the urine over 48 hr, consisting of 62.1% REL, 4.9% M1, and 4.1% M2, 
indicating that REL was cleared primarily via renal excretion of the intact parent in rats, with a small 
contribution by metabolism. Faecal samples were not collected in the study. 
In a follow-up study with radiolabelled [14C] REL (20 mg/kg) administrated intravenously to male WH rats, 
[14C]REL was detected as the predominant component in urine and faeces (81 and 7.0% of the dose, 
Assessment report  
  
  
respectively), with M1 accounting for ~1.1% and ~0.3% of the administered dose in urine and faeces, 
respectively. M2 was not detected in the excreta through radiometric or LC-MS analysis. Thus, metabolism 
appears to be a minor clearance route for REL in rats.  
Metabolism of imipenem was shown to occur primarily in the kidney. The major pathway of metabolism of 
imipenem is by hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring by the enzyme known as dehydropeptidase-I localized on 
the brush-border of proximal renal tubular epithelium. The renal metabolic degradation results in a low 
urinary recovery of intact imipenem in nonclinical species and in humans. 
Cilastatin is a dehydropeptidase-I inhibitor that was developed to prevent the renal metabolism of imipenem. 
Cilastatin, when co-administered with imipenem, increased the urinary recovery of imipenem (from 38% to 
67% of the dose in rats, 13% to 76% in chimpanzee, 15-20% to 70% in humans), thereby increasing the 
antibacterial concentrations in urine and enhancing the therapeutic potential of imipenem for the treatment of 
urinary tract infections.  
Cilastatin undergoes metabolism in nonclinical species and humans to various extent, ranging from 85% in 
rabbits to <25% in humans. In humans, approximately 10% of the cilastatin administered is found as the N-
acetyl metabolite, which has inhibitory activity against dehydropeptidase-I comparable to that of the parent 
drug 
Excretion 
The excretion of REL was evaluated in rat and man. Renal excretion was found to be the dominating 
elimination route, while elimination in faeces was low. Following IV administration of unlabelled 4 mg/kg REL 
to intact male WH rats, approximately 71% of the dose was accounted for by REL and its metabolites in 
urine. Following IV administration of radioactive [14C]REL to male WH rats, a total recovery of 94.9% was 
achieved over 72 hr post-dose, with 84.7% in urine, 7.8% in faeces, and 2.4% in cage wash. The rat 
unbound renal clearance of REL (12 mL/min/kg) was comparable to the glomerular filtration rate (10-12 
mL/min/kg). 
In humans, renal excretion of the intact parent is the major route of elimination for REL. The observed renal 
clearance for REL (250 mg) is ~135 mL/min, close to the plasma clearance (148 mL/min), indicating nearly 
complete elimination of REL by the renal route. The unbound renal clearance is 173 mL/min (based on an 
unbound fraction of 0.78) and is greater than the glomerular filtration rate (120 mL/min), suggesting that 
active tubular secretion is involved in the renal elimination of REL in addition to glomerular filtration, and 
accounts for ~30% of the total clearance. 
Lactational transfer of REL was investigated in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats by measuring concentrations of 
REL in maternal plasma and milk on Lactation Day (LD) 14, following daily IV administration of REL at 450 
mg/kg/day on GD 6 through LD 14. Maternal plasma and milk samples were collected at 0.25 hr post-dose in 
rats on LD 14. The ratio of milk to maternal plasma concentration in rats was ~0.05 at 0.25 hr post-dose, 
indicating excretion of circulating REL into the milk of lactating rats. 
Following administration of radiolabelled imipenem to rats, rabbits, monkeys, and humans, >90% of the dose 
was recovered in urine as intact drug and metabolites. Elimination of imipenem occurs primarily by 
glomerular filtration and tubular secretion, followed by the dehydropeptidase-mediated metabolism at the 
brush border of renal tubular epithelium. 
Cilastatin is cleared almost solely via renal excretion as intact drug and metabolites in rabbits, monkeys, and 
humans. The amount of intact cilastatin excreted into urine was ~15% in rabbits, ~45% in monkeys and 
Assessment report  
  
  
~77% in humans. In humans, the renal clearance of cilastatin exceeds the clearance due to glomerular 
filtration alone, indicating the involvement of active secretion. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of relebactam (REL) has been evaluated in non-clinical studies in agreement with 
relevant guidelines. The program includes repeat-dose studies up to 3 months exposure in rats and monkeys, 
and a repeat dose combination study with REL and imipenem/relebactam. A number of process 
intermediates/impurities have also been studied. Overall, the toxicity profile of REL has been characterized 
via single dose toxicity, repeat dose toxicity, genotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, juvenile 
toxicity, local tolerance and immunotoxicity studies.  
Relevance of animal models 
The Wistar Han rat and cynomolgus monkey were selected as the main rodent and non-rodent species in the 
general toxicity studies. The embryo foetal development studies were conducted in the CD1 mouse, Sprague 
Dawley rat, and New Zealand White rabbit. 
The selection was based on the in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiles and the demonstration of satisfactory 
pharmacokinetics in these species. The monkey had previously been used as the non-rodent species for the 
assessment of toxicological profile of imipenem/cilastatin including the evaluation of renal toxicity caused by 
imipenem. With respect to the 3Rs principles the selection of the monkey should have been further justified. 
However, the animal models are considered relevant. 
The intravenous (IV) route of administration was utilized in all toxicology studies (except in the first phase of 
the juvenile study in rat and the EFD study in mouse) to match the intended clinical administration route. The 
animals were administered once daily, whereas in the clinic, the patients will be administered every 6th hour. 
Overall, the animal models are considered relevant. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single intravenous dose of the assumed maximum feasible dose in rats (up to 450 mg/kg) and monkeys (225 
mg/kg) was well tolerated with no test article-related antemortem findings. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Relebactam was evaluated in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats (4 weeks with 4 weeks recovery, and 12 
weeks with no recovery phase) and in monkeys (4 weeks with 4 weeks recovery, and 12 weeks with no 
recovery phase). Relebactam in combination with imipenem and cilastatin was evaluated in a repeat-dose 
toxicity study in monkey (4 weeks with no recovery phase). 
Morbidity and mortality 
In the 1-month pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies in rat the 2 female rats in the high dose group (450 
mg/kg/day) were found dead shortly after the dose on study day 1. The animals were observed with 
convulsion like activity, tremors, and sternal recumbency. Reddish-coloured urine was observed in one of the 
rats. In the following 3-months study, the same maximum dose (450 mg/kg) was selected, and also in this 
study, 2 female animals died shortly after initiation of administrations. Clinical signs that were observed were 
Assessment report  
  
  
reduced activity, sternal recumbency, convulsion-like activity, rapid breathing and red discolouration in ears. 
There were no histomorphological findings and the cause of death was not established. In the 1-month study 
no adverse reactions were observed in the remaining animals, including male rats investigated for CNS safety 
effects. In the 3-months study, the remaining animals in the high dose group presented with clinical signs 
such as red discolouration in ears, unsteady gait, reduced activity, and sternal recumbency. It was decided to 
reduce the maximum dose to 300 mg/kg/day, which was administered Study Day 2 and 3, where after the 
administration was discontinued for Study Day 4 and 5. Administration resumed on Study Day 6, at which the 
findings had resolved.  
The same maximum dose, 450 mg/kg/day, was used in rats in the reproductive and developmental toxicity 
studies. In these studies, neither morbidity nor mortality was seen, and additionally no clinical signs were 
observed. In the repeat dose toxicity studies Wistar Han rats were used, whereas Sprague Dawley rats were 
used in the reproductive toxicity studies. Wistar Han rats were administered 450 mg/kg/day in a non-pivotal 
7 days toxicity study with no observed morbidity or clinical signs. In early exploratory studies with 
amorphous material of low purity, administration of relebactam 450 mg/kg was associated with acute toxicity 
and mortality in both Wistar Han and Sprague Dawley rats. In these studies, also the infusion rate was 
explored, but a lower infusion rate did not reduce the mortality. The measured Cmax in the rats administered 
450 mg/kg/day for a month was approximately 6400 µM, which is 130 times the maximum concentration 
measured in patients (49 µM).  
Acute toxicity was also observed in one male monkey administered 225 mg/kg/day. The animal was observed 
with scant to no faeces, emesis, inappetence, decreased activity, hunched posture, intermittent whole body 
trembling, and weight loss. The individual was supplemented with food and hydrated, and the physical signs 
were resolved by day 6. The measured Cmax in the group of animals was approximately 3500 µM, which is 
approximately 70 times the maximum concentration measured in patients (49 µM). The individual animal in 
which the observations were made had a three times higher exposure than the other animals in the group. 
The same dose with amorphous low purity material in an exploratory study, induced transient intermittent 
unsteady gait, trembling, hunched posture, decreased activity, and lateral recumbency.  
Organ toxicity – Kidney 
The kidney was identified as a target organ for toxicity of relebactam in both rat and monkey.  
In rats, minimal to mild cytoplasmic granularity in the renal tubular epithelium was observed in all animals 
exposed to daily doses of relebactam for 3 months (65, 150, and 300 mg/kg/day). No evidence of necrotic or 
degenerative changes was observed. It is not possible to conclude anything about the reversibility of these 
changes since there was no dose free recovery period included in the study. There were no alterations in 
other renal-related parameters in the rat studies. Regarding the No Observed Adverse Effect Level, the 
minimal to mild cytoplasmic granularity was considered non-adverse. 
In the 1-month repeat dose toxicity study in monkeys, the highest dose of relebactam, 225 mg/kg/day, 
induced an increase in kidney weight by 36% (actual weight and related to body and brain weight). In 2 of 6 
animals very slight tubule epithelium degeneration was observed and very slight to slight granular cytoplasm 
in the tubule epithelium in all animals in the group. One female individual in the group also had increased 
urea nitrogen and creatinine as well as fine granular casts and hyaline casts in the urine. The granular 
cytoplasm in the tubule epithelium was also observed in one animal administered 75 mg/kg/day. No kidney-
related observations were made after the 4 weeks of dose free period. In the three months study, the 
animals were administered 150 mg/kg/day at a maximum. A dose level at which minimal to mild cytoplasmic 
Assessment report  
  
  
granularity in the tubular epithelium was observed. No epithelial degeneration or effects on clinical pathology 
were identified. 
In the 1-month study in monkeys the effect of relebactam was further assessed by means of biomarkers in 
urine and electron microscopy. Urine samples from control and high dose animals (225 mg/kg/day) was 
collected at 3 days, 3 weeks, 1 month, and after the recovery period. The samples were analysed for 
albumin, N-acetyl-β-D-glucoseaminidase (NAG), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), total urinary protein, 
clusterin, and cystatin C. Significant urinary biomarker increases were noted in high dose animals for albumin 
and total protein, clusterin, and cystatin C, primarily on Study Day 3. KIM-1 levels were significantly 
increased in study week 5, or study weeks 3 and 5, for seven of ten monkeys at 225 mg/kg/day. All of the 
recovery animals had normal KIM-1 levels at study week 9. There were no KIM-1 increases on study day 3 in 
high dose animals. KIM-1 findings correlated with tubular degeneration in 2/2 F. Kidneys from 2 
monkeys/group in control and 225 mg/kg/day were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy. In the 
kidneys from the animals exposed to relebactam, an increased number and size of lysosomes containing 
electron dense material and concentric lamellar membranous whorls. 
In the 1-month toxicity study in monkey where relebactam was administered in combination with imipenem 
and cilastatin, no histomorphological changes in the kidney was observed. However, the kidney weight 
(relative to brain weight) had increased with 18%. It was noted that the urine from the treated animals was 
brown and contained crystals and a slight increase in protein concentration. The relebactam dose in this 
study was 37.5 mg/kg/day, and 150 mg/kg/day of the combination imipenem/cilastatin (1:1), that is, the 
intended dose relationship. 
In the reproductive toxicity study in rabbit a dose-dependent increase in incidence of rabbits with discoloured 
urine (orange) was observed at all dose levels. It was argued that the discoloured urine was due to excretion 
of the open lactam ring of a hydrolysis product of relebactam. This was considered likely but it is not known if 
this could also explain the observation of brown urine in the combination toxicity study. 
Injection site 
Irritation of the injection site was noted by clinical observations and histomorphological changes in both rat 
and monkey and in all groups, including vehicle treated animals. 
Imipenem/cilastatin 
Animal studies showed that the toxicity produced by imipenem, as a single entity, was limited to the kidney. 
Co-administration of cilastatin with imipenem in a 1:1 ratio prevented the nephrotoxic effects of imipenem in 
rabbits and monkeys. Available evidence suggests that cilastatin prevents the nephrotoxicity by preventing 
entry of imipenem into the tubular cells. 
Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity 
The genotoxic potential of relebactam was characterized by the Ames test, a chromosome aberration test in 
CHO-cells, and an in-vivo rat bone marrow erythrocyte micronucleus test. The outcome of the studies was 
negative, thus, there were no indication that relebactam is genotoxic. In the absence of genotoxicity, and as 
the proposed treatment duration is relatively short, no carcinogenicity tests have been conducted. 
Imipenem and cilastatin (alone and in combinations) were negative in standard battery of in vitro and in vivo 
genetic toxicity studies, including V79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, Ames test, unscheduled DNA 
Assessment report  
  
  
synthesis assay and in vivo mouse cytogenetics test. No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with 
imipenem/cilastatin. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies were conducted to evaluate the standard reproductive and developmental toxicity profile of 
relebactam: two segment I ‘fertility’ studies (Sprague-Daley (SD) rats), three piovtal segment II ‘EFD’ studies 
(mouse, rat, and rabbit), and one segment III ‘prenatal/postnatal’ study (SD rats). Additionally, one pivotal 
juvenile toxicity studies was conducted in SD rats. 
Male and female fertility 
In the fertility studies in males and females, there were no relebactam-related effects on mating, fertility, or 
male reproductive assessments (sperm analysis). In the male animals a transient decrease in body weight 
gain was observed during study week 1 and 3, this did not affect the fertility parameters in the animals. The 
NOAEL for male and female fertility is therefore ≥450 mg/kg/day, corresponding to an exposure margin of at 
least 8 times the human exposure based on AUC. In addition, there were no gross or microscopic changes in 
reproductive organs observed in repeat-dose studies in rats and monkeys for up to 12 weeks of duration. 
Embryo-foetal development 
Three GLP embryo-foetal development studies were conducted in mice, rats and rabbits. Before these studies 
were conducted preliminary non-GLP dose finding studies were performed. Relebactam was generally well 
tolerated across studies. 
Mice 
The embryo-foetal development in mice was conducted at 0, 80, 200, and 450 mg/kg/day administered 
subcutaneously. No treatment-related adverse effects were detected in the mothers. In the foetuses there 
was an apparent increase of skeletal malformations (1, 4, 3, and 5 foetuses in the control, 80, 200, and 450 
mg/kg/day group). The Applicant states that the observed skeletal alterations in the pivotal mouse study 
were within the range of historical control incidences.  
The highest dose tested (450 mg/kg/day), rendered a systemic exposure marginal between human and 
pregnant mice of 6.7x (based on AUC0-24) and x31 (based on Cmax). 
Rat 
The embryo-foetal development in rat was conducted at 0, 50, 150, and 450 mg/kg/day. No treatment-
related adverse effects were detected in the mothers or the offspring.  
The systemic exposure marginal between human and pregnant rat administered the highest dose 450 
mg/kg/day was 8.4x (based on AUC0-24) and x111 (based on Cmax). 
Rabbit 
The embryo-foetal development in rabbit was conducted at 0, 35, 275, and 450 mg/kg/day. 
No treatment-related adverse effects were detected in the mothers except for an observation on discoloured 
urine which is thought to be due to excretion of a hydrolysis product of relebactam.  
A slight increase in the incidence of foetuses with either a malformation or variation of the hyoid bone was 
observed (M/V: 1/1, 0/2, 0/2, and 3/5 foetuses in the control, 35, 275, and 450 mg/kg/day group). The 
Assessment report  
  
  
Applicant considers this unrelated to relebactam due to the isolated event and since no other relebactam 
related variations were observed.  
The systemic exposure marginal between human and pregnant rabbit administered the highest dose 450 
mg/kg/day was 29x (based on AUC0-24) and x147 (based on Cmax). 
Prenatal/postnatal study 
The potential effects of relebactam on development, growth, behaviour, reproductive performance, and 
fertility of F1 generation were evaluated in rats after administration of 0, 64, 200, and 450 mg/kg/day to F0 
females from gestation day 6 through day 20 postpartum. Furthermore the F1 pups were investigated for 
cohabitation on post-natal week 12. 
Mean plasma exposure of relebactam for F0 females on gestational day 15 for the highest dose (450 
mg/kg/day) was 3020 µMxhr which is 9.1x the human exposure at steady state.  
The relebactam concentration in milk or exposure in pups was collected from separate studies in rats. The 
foetal plasma levels were approximately 5% of the maternal plasma levels on gestation day 20 after 
administration of 450 mg/kg/day on GD7 through 20. In another study the ration of milk to maternal plasma 
concentration in rats was approximately 0.05 15 min post dose. 
Juvenile 
One pivotal juvenile toxicity study was conducted in Sprague Dawley rats. Relebactam was administered on 
postnatal day 14 – 56 with a recovery phase until PND 85. No clinical observations or alterations in 
developmental landmarks (vaginal opening, preputial separation), clinical pathology, organ weights, gross 
findings or femur length related to relebactam was observed.   
The systemic exposure marginal between adult human and the juvenile rats administered the highest dose 
450 mg/kg/day was 6x (based on AUC0-24) and 78x (based on Cmax). 
Imipenem/cilastatin 
No treatment-related effects on fertility are noted after imipenem/cilastatin administration to male and 
female rats. 
A teratology study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys given imipenem-cilastatin sodium at doses of 40/40 
mg/kg/day (bolus intravenous injection) resulted in maternal toxicity including emesis, inappetence, body 
weight loss, diarrhoea, abortion, and death in some cases. When doses of imipenem-cilastatin sodium 
(approximately 100/100 mg/kg/day or approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily human dose 
in imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam product) were administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys at an 
intravenous infusion rate which mimics human clinical use, there was minimal maternal intolerance 
(occasional emesis), no maternal deaths, no evidence of teratogenicity, but an increase in embryonic loss 
relative to control groups 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics of relebactam was characterized in all the pivotal toxicity studies. There were no differences 
between males and females in the TK parameters in either rat or monkey. In the one-month toxicity studies 
in both rat and monkey where the highest doses were administered, 450 mg/kg/day in rat and 225 
mg/kg/day in monkey, a slight change in dose proportionality was observed. The systemic exposures in the 
Assessment report  
  
  
high dose animals were higher than expected. Possibly due to an effect on renal function and lower excretion 
caused by high exposure of relebactam. 
Local Tolerance  
Relebactam is classified as a non-irritant. 
Impurities 
The specification levels suggested by the applicant for the impurities desulfated (NH,OH), t-butyl impurity, 
Ritter impurity, and open ring hydrolysis degradate (0.50, 0.30, 0.23, and 0.50 wt%) are qualified in the 
non-clinical pivotal repeat dose toxicity study in rats. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The ERA is based on relebactam which has a molecular weight of 366 g/mole, a water solubility of 63.3 g/L 
(pH7), and a log KOW < -2 (pH 7). The ERA Phase I surface water predicted environmental concentration 
(PECSW) was calculated to 5.0 µg/L using the default Fpen (0.01) and the maximum dose of 1000 mg/day. 
Based on the OECD 308 test, the persistence against aerobic degradation in whole fresh water-sediment 
systems is between DT50 20-41 days (20 ˚C) or 43-88 days (12 ˚C). 
The organic content solid adsorption coefficient for relebactam were below 10000 L/kg for sludge and soil 
(KOC 18-202 L/kg), making it unlikely that there is a terrestrial environmental risk due to agricultural use of 
sludge. The lowest NOEC for aquatic toxicity was 0.67 mg/L using Anabaena flos-aquae while the most 
sensitive NOEC for sediment-dwellers (C. riparius, NOEC 18 mg/kg) was for midge emergence. 
Relebactam is not classified as a PBT or vPvB candidate. Based on the Phase I PECSW, the applicant has 
provided a set risk quotients/ratios that are below 0.1 for sludge microorganisms and below 1 for other 
compartments.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
For assessment of primary pharmacodynamics, see clinical section on pharmacodynamics. 
Based on the lack of any findings in the safety pharmacology or toxicity studies adequate for the intended 
therapeutic concentration range, the off-target screen appears to have been sufficient and CHMP agreed that 
can be considered acceptable. 
Overall for relebactam, no safety pharmacological findings in a clinically relevant dose range were observed. 
Due to the high exposure marginal (Cmax at >100-fold the clinical Cmax), for the acute toxicity findings in 
the 1-month repeat-dose IV study in rats, occurring in conjunction with the neurobehavioural FOB study, the 
applicant considered these to be of limited clinical relevance. This conclusion is agreed on.  
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For imipenem and cilastatin alone and in combination, no cardiovascular, respiratory or gastrointestinal 
effects of concern were reported. However, CNS related findings, as seizures and convulsion-like activity, 
were observed at approximately 6 -10 times the corresponding maximum recommended daily human dose of 
Recarbrio. As reported in the Tienam SmPC and proposed Recarbrio SmPC, CNS adverse reactions, such as 
seizures, confusional states and myoclonic activity, have also been reported in humans treated with 
imipenem/cilastatin when recommended dosages of imipenem were exceeded. For further discussion of the 
acute CNS-related toxicity effects, see the non-clinical toxicological section. Cilastatin alone had no significant 
actions on the central nervous system. 
For relebactam it was noted only males were used in the CV and CNS GLP-studies. However, since no 
substantial gender differences were observed in the repeat dose toxicology studies, this is considered 
acceptable. It was also noted Mongrel dogs were used in the CV study in anesthetized dogs, which presents 
problems with regard to animal to animal variability by introducing wider genetic differences which potentially 
affects the PK and/or PD results. In order to best investigate the cardiovascular effects of REL, the Applicant 
could have used a pure breed of dogs such as beagles. However, since this study was not pivotal and CV 
effects were studied in humans in thorough QTc study, this is not considered critical. 
In conclusion, the non-clinical data package, considering secondary and safety pharmacology raise no 
objections for the use of Recarbrio in the intended disease indications. 
It should be noted that the assessment of the non-clinical primary pharmacodynamics (in vitro and in vivo) is 
carried out in the clinical section. 
Pharmacokinetics 
For relebactam, no single-dose PK data was provided for rabbit used for the EFD studies. However, a dose-
finding in male and female rabbits is carried out for the EFD studies. Furthermore, the bioanalytical method 
report for the plasma exposure measured in the placental transfer study was GLP validated. Overall this is 
considered sufficient by CHMP.  
The Applicant states, the half-life of REL in humans is similar to that of IPM and CIL and also suggest the REL 
half-life provides support for the suggested dosing interval of q6h. Upon CHMP request during the 
assessment, the Applicant has also provided the half-life of IPM and CIL, which is considered supportive for 
the co-administration. 
It is noted that no studies on in vivo metabolism of REL have been carried out in rabbit or monkey that were 
used in reproductive toxicity or CV and repeat dose toxicity studies, respectively. However, since no major 
REL metabolites have been identified in humans, this is considered acceptable by CHMP. 
For imipenem and cilastatin, distribution and elimination studies were consistent with renal excretion being 
the main elimination route for parent and metabolites.  Moreover, the metabolism of imipenem occurs 
primarily in the kidney mainly by hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring by the enzyme known as 
dehydropeptidase-I resulting in a low urinary recovery of intact imipenem. However, since cilastatin is a 
dehydropeptidase-I inhibitor that according to the Applicant was developed to prevent the renal metabolism 
of imipenem, cilastatin increased the urinary recovery of imipenem. Thereby the antibacterial concentrations 
in urine was increased and the therapeutic potential of imipenem for the treatment of urinary tract infections 
was enhanced. The submitted documentation seems to support this approach. 
During the assessment the Applicant has submitted a non-clinical summary addressing the pharmacokinetic 
section regarding imipenem and cilastatin.  
Assessment report  
  
  
Toxicology 
In the 1-month pivotal repeat dose toxicity studies in rat the 2 female rats in the high dose group (450 
mg/kg/day) were found dead shortly after the dose on study day 1. The animals were observed with 
convulsion like activity, tremors, and sternal recumbency. In the following 3-months study, the same 
maximum dose (450 mg/kg) was selected, and also in this study, 2 female animals died shortly after 
initiation of administrations. It is acknowledged that the exposure margins are large and that the clinical 
relevance for the observed acute toxicity could be limited. However, since the observed effects are indicative 
of CNS effects and adverse CNS reactions, such as myoclonic activity, confusional states, and seizures have 
been reported in patients for imipenem/cilastatin, the Applicant was asked during the assessment to 
elaborate on this acute toxicity and its possible clinical relevance. The Applicant provided a discussion and 
CHMP agreed that the observed clinical signs in rats occurred at clinically irrelevant concentrations, and that 
the clinical signs were only observed in the rat and not in the monkeys. Furthermore, the relebactam in the 
imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam combination did not render an increased number of CNS adverse reactions 
compared to imipenem/cilastatin. The clinical risk of seizure and other CNS adverse reactions is presented in 
the SmPC section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and is thus adequately addressed. 
The kidney was identified as a target organ for toxicity of relebactam in both rat and monkey. The Applicant 
describes the observed epithelial granulation as indicative of an adaptive process allowing compound 
disposition via lysosomes. This argument is further supported by the results from the electron microscopic 
evaluation in which increase of the number and size of lysosomes were noted. In the current SmPC of Tienam 
it is suggested that cilastatin prevents the imipenem induced nephrotoxicity by preventing entry of imipenem 
into the tubular cells. In light of the main excretory pathway (renal) together with the described findings, and 
the previous established toxicological profile of imipenem, the Applicant was asked by CHMP during the 
assessment to further discuss possible cause of the observed renal toxicities, if a possible synergistic effect of 
imipenem and relebactam on the tubular cells exist, if cilastatin can protect against nephrotoxicity caused by 
relebactam, and clinical possible implications on patients and especially patients with reduced renal function. 
It is not clear if the same pathway is involved for the nephrotoxicity induced by relebactam and imipenem. 
The transport of relebactam, and possibly imipenem, into the kidney tubular cells involves the OAT3 
transporter. The applicant discussed the theoretical possibility that cilastatin as an inhibitor of OAT3 could 
block the entrance of relebactam (and possibly imipenem) via OAT3 into the renal tubular epithelium and 
thereby preventing its nephrotoxicity. However, it is not known if the plasma levels of cilastatin are high 
enough to sufficiently block the transporter of both imipenem and relebactam in order to avoid 
nephrotoxicity. 
Relebactam alone induced granularity in the cytoplasm of proximal tubular epithelial cells in rats at clinically 
relevant exposures and at double the exposure in monkeys. These findings were considered non-adverse. No 
synergistic toxic effects were observed when relebactam was co-administered with imipenem and cilastatin in 
monkeys. In this study, however, the relebactam dose was lower (37.5 mg/kg/day) than in the single 
component study, rendering an exposure only 1.3x the AUC observed in patients. However, the results from 
the completed clinical trials are not indicative of an increased risk of renal toxicities when imipenem is 
administered with cilastatin only or when relebactam is added. In patients with impaired renal function, it is 
recommended to reduce the dose both with imipenem/cilastatin and imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam; this is 
included in the Recarbrio PI.  
The Applicant’s position is that no additional specific urinary biomarkers to monitor kidney toxicity is 
necessary. This is accepted by CHMP, since the dose levels in patients with an impaired renal function is 
adjusted based on creatine clearance. 
Assessment report  
  
  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In the embryo-foetal development in mice there was an apparent increase of skeletal malformations (1, 4, 3, 
and 5 foetuses in the control, 80, 200, and 450 mg/kg/day group). The Applicant states that the observed 
skeletal alterations in the pivotal mouse study were within the range of historical control incidences. The 
historical data was provided in response to the questions in the first round of the procedure. The data was 
based on 1189 foetuses in 102 litters for all observations except skull bone malformation (640 foetuses 
evaluated in 102 litters). The data was collected from only 5 control groups. The data was obtained 2005-
2010 and the study conducted during 2012. It is not clear how the data was calculated. 
During the procedure, the Applicant provided additional discussions regarding the findings. The incidence of 
skeletal malformations in the pivotal EFD study in mice was slightly higher than previously observed 
incidences. The skeletal malformations in mice consisted of cleft palate and skull malformation, cervical and 
lumbar vertebra malformation, and absent and extra vertebra. Regarding the cleft palate malformation, the 
finding consisted of the subcategories split palatine and split axis. Split palatine represents the skeletal 
confirmation of the external finding of cleft palate. The number of observations of cleft palate was within the 
historical control range. Only one individual (low-dose group) was observed with the split axis. Regarding the 
other observed malformations, it is somewhat unclear, but considering the low number of observations and 
the fact that the findings are not observed in rats or rabbits, CHMP agreed that the findings in mice could be 
considered unrelated to the treatment with relebactam. 
A slight increase in the incidence of foetuses with either a malformation or variation of the hyoid bone was 
observed in the embryo-foetal development study in rabbit. The historical control incidences on hyoid bone 
malformation and variation in rabbit was submitted in response to questions in the first round of the 
procedure. The data was based on 1465 foetuses in 172 litters collected 2008-2012. The study was 
conducted in 2015. It is not clear how the data was calculated. The incidence of hyoid bone malformation was 
within the historical control range, while the incidence of variations was above the historical range. It was not 
possible to exclude a potential test article-related effect. In response, the Applicant clarified that the 
difference between malformation and variation in the rabbit EFD study was the severity of the findings since 
the observations consisted of misshapen or bent thyrohyoid. It is thus reasonable to combine the incidence of 
hyoid bone malformations and variations. This is agreed. The Applicant also presented historical control 
ranges for the combined incidence of malformations and variations from another site. While historical control 
data from other sites could be questionable the actual numbers were convincing that the numbers of 
combined malformation and variation in the rabbit were well within the historical control range. 
In the prenatal/postnatal study in rats, there were a number of dead pups in the PPND study, rendering a 
slightly reduced percentage of live pups delivered (100 % in control and 91-92% in the 200 and 450 
mg/kg/day groups). In the Applicant’s responses during the assessment it was clarified that no examinations 
were performed on pups that died before litter processing in the rat PPND study. This was according to study 
protocol and standard operating procedures. The Applicant claimed that the lower percentages of live pups at 
the 200 and 450 mg/kg/day groups was not related to relebactam based on lack of dose response based on 
plasma AUC and historical controls.  
In the initially proposed Recarbrio SmPC section 5.3, the wording regarding imipenem/cilastatin and 
pregnancy in cynomolgus monkeys included a comparison with the human dose based on body surface area. 
The Applicant was asked to provide a clarification on how the data had been calculated. The presented data 
were not fully acceptable, since different human body weights were used in the calculations. In the 
calculation for the Human Equivalent Dose (HED) for the 100 mg/kg/day monkey dose (100/3.1=32.3 
mg/kg/day) assumes a human body weight of 60 kg. The recommended human dose (RHD) for 2000 mg/day 
Assessment report  
  
  
is thus 33.3 mg/kg/day. The comparison of the doses is thus 32.3/33.3 = 0.97. It is agreed that the HED 
conversion could be used, however, for consistency, CHMP agreed to request the Applicant to use the 
wording from the Tienam PI, previously agreed upon by CHMP. 
Impurities 
In the submitted documents for the Ritter impurity, different specification limits as well as different impurity 
levels in the nonclinical studies are presented. During the assessment, the presented figures were clarified, 
and the dose multiple based on mg/kg was 8.48. 
Environmental risk assessment 
CHMP noted that the environmental risk assessment was not submitted for imipenem and for cilastatin. 
Environmental testing is currently underway and CHMP requested that the results of the studies should be 
submitted for assessment by the end of 2020. 
In terms of the water/sediment study (OECD 308) the applicant presented DT50water and DT50sediment 
normalised to European average temperature of 12 °C as requested in the first round of the procedure. The 
DT50 in the water phase at +12 ˚C for the Weweantic river was 81 days, which exceeds the trigger for very 
persistent in fresh water (60 days). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
CHMP agreed that from a non-clinical point of view, with regard to preclinical secondary & safety 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology, the application for imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam is 
approvable.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: The Environmental 
risk assessment of imipenem and cilastatin needs to be submitted post approval, not later than the end of Q4 
2020.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
As relebactam is a new chemical entity, pharmacokinetic data should aim at describing the disposition of the 
compound in order to possibly support dosing recommendations and predict situations and patients where 
pharmacokinetics may be different from that in the average clinical study patient. For imipenem and 
cilastatin, the Applicant provided information which is in line with that presented in the SmPC of the approved 
product Tienam. For both imipenem and relebactam, the PK data are used in the PK/PD models of importance 
to support efficacy and safety in the proposed indications. 
Bioanalysis methods 
All bioanalytical methods for quantification of relebactam, imipenem and cilastatin in clinical samples, were 
based on liquid chromatography (either HPLC or UPLC) with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS).  
Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Separate models were constructed for imipenem and relebactam. Cilastatin was not analysed in the studies, 
and no popPK model was developed. Data were included from seven completed Phase 1 studies with rich PK 
sampling (PN001, PN002, PN005, PN007, PN009, PN012 and PN019), two completed Phase 2 studies (PN003 
and PN004) and one completed double-blinded Phase 3 study (PN013) with sparse sampling. The structural 
and stochastic models were chosen based on the phase I data; two compartment model of disposition with 
zero order IV infusion and first order, linear elimination; incorporating BSV in CL, V1 and V2. The tested 
covariates were Clcrea, weight, healthy/patient, age, sex and race.  
The parameter estimates of the final model, including Clcrea and weight as covariates on imipenem clearance 
and Clcrea on relebactam clearance. Health status as a covariate on relebactam clearance was initially found 
significant but was not retained in the backward deletion.  Weight was included as a covariate on V1 for both 
entities, whereas health status was included only for imipenem. The final covariate relationships are 
displayed in Table 8. Renal impairment had a substantial effect on the exposure of both imipenem (1.37, 
1.57 and 5.17-fold in mild, moderate and severe RI, respectively) and relebactam (1.54, 2.17, and 3.99-
fold). Weight had a minor impact on the exposure of both compounds.

Absorption and distribution 
All studies are performed with solutions for IV infusion. According to the popPK model, the Vss of relebactam 
is 19L, and the corresponding value for imipenem is 24 L All three compounds have a modest plasma protein 
binding, with an unbound fraction of relebactam around 78%. A distribution study to lung (ELF, alveolar cells) 
was performed in healthy volunteers after administration of multiple doses of imipenem/relebactam. Both 
relebactam and imipenem were distributed to bronchoalveolar fluid to a similar extent. The exposure in this 
compartment appeared lower than in plasma, the estimated exposure was around 50% of that in plasma for 
both compounds. Relebactam was also found in alveolar cells, in similar or lower concentrations than in ELF. 
Imipenem, however, did not appear to distribute to alveolar cells. 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
 
Elimination 
In the phase I study P001V01 urine sampling was performed and the excretion of both relebactam, imipenem 
and cilastatin was assessed. Almost all of a given dose of relebactam was retrieved unchanged in urine. In 
the single dose groups fe was 95-100% over 24 hours, and in the multiple dose groups fe was 89-100% over 
a dose interval. Renal clearance was independent of dose and was estimated to 127-182 ml/min in the 
different dose groups, 135 ml/min at the 250 mg dose.  
Imipenem was also found in a high extent unchanged in urine. After a single dose of 500 mg, in combination 
with cilastatin and with or without co-administration of relebactam, the fraction retrieved unchanged in urine 
ranged from 53 to 71%, with a renal clearance of 106-139 ml/min. For cilastatin, 71-95% was excreted 
unchanged and renal clearance was estimated to 173-202 ml/min. 
Given that the estimated renal clearance of relebactam (~ 135 ml/min) was higher than what would be the 
expected passive filtration (fu x GFR ~0.78x120 ml/min = 94 ml/min), a role of active renal secretion 
(around 30%  of total clearance) is expected for relebactam. Therefore, identification of potential active 
transport proteins in the kidney was performed.  
Several in vitro systems (cell monolayers, cell suspensions, membrane vesicles) were used in order to 
investigate transporters which are relevant for disposition of relebactam. Investigated transporters included: 
P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, MRP4, OAT1, OAT3, OAT4, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K. Applicant has concluded that 
relebactam was a substrate of OAT3, OAT4, MATE1 and MATE2K. The clinical relevance of OAT-transport was 
investigated further in a DDI-study with probenecid. 
Relebactam, as well as cilastatin is almost entirely excreted unchanged in urine and no clinically relevant 
metabolism occurs. Imipenem is partly metabolised in the kidney by dehydropeptidases, which are inhibited 
by cilastatin. No indications of metabolism were observed in vitro in hepatocytes.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Following single-dose administration as a 30-minute infusion, relebactam plasma concentrations declined 
biexponentially with a GM terminal t½ ranging from 1.35 to 1.8 hrs over the 25 mg to 1150 mg dose range 
(Figure 10). Analysis of dose proportionality showed that the slope was very close to 1 (1.01, 95% CI 0.99-
1.03) when a linear mixed effects model was used, including ln-dose as a continuous effect, performed on 
natural log-transformed values.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
About 73% of individuals in the integrated Phase 1, 2 and 3 popPK dataset were patients with active bacterial 
infection while the remaining 27% were healthy subjects. The effect of disease status (referred to as HLTH), 
was tested in the popPK analysis identified as significant only on imipenem V1. The effect of HLTH was small, 
with subjects with active bacterial infection having about 30% higher V1 for imipenem. 
Simulated steady-state plasma PK parameters for imipenem and relebactam from the popPK model after 
multiple doses of 500-mg/250-mg IMI/REL as 30-minute IV infusions for 7 days are shown in Table 10.

Renal impairment 
Study MK-7655-005 was a dedicated renal impairment study to investigate the PK of a single dose of 
relebactam (125 mg) co-administered with imipenem/cilastatin 250 mg in subjects with mild (n=6), 
moderate (n=6) and severe (n=6) renal impairment, end-stage renal disease (ESRD; n=6) and matched 
healthy subjects (n=24). ESRD subjects received drug immediately after haemodialysis in one dosing period, 
and 30 minutes before haemodialysis in a second dosing period (7 days wash-out). 
The subjects were included based on eGFR in ml/min/1.73 m2, but their Creatinine clearance was also 
calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault equation. The majority of subjects included had a high BMI (overweight), 
only 5 of the 24 subjects with RI had a BMI <25.

For each of the analytes, the AUC was higher progressively with decreased renal function. A data 
presentation was included where the subjects were classified according to absolute GFR, and the AUC-ratio 
between renally impaired subjects and their healthy controls was 1.41, 2.56 and 5.80-fold in mild, moderate 
and severe RI. In subjects with ESRD, the AUC was high if given after dialysis (9.35-fold matched controls) 
but was removed by dialysis (1.75-fold matched controls when given pre-dialysis) (Table 12).

Table 5. PK results of study MK-7655-005 with renal impairment categorised according to 
absolute renal function.  
Corresponding analyses were performed for imipenem and cilastatin. The geometric mean ratios for 
imipenem were 1.19, 1.69 and 2.80 and for cilastatin 1.36, 2.22 and 7.16 in patients with mild, moderate 
and severe renal impairment, respectively.  
The data from the renal impairment study was included together with data from a number of other studies in 
the dataset for the popPK modelling (see section 2.1.2). The model used the Cockcroft-Gault formula to 
estimate Clcrea, and Clcrea was found to be a significant covariate on both imipenem and relebactam 
clearance with a power function. 
The effect of renal impairment on the PK of imipenem as well as relebactam according to the popPK model is 
displayed below: 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
The effect of severe RI on relebactam exposure was similar between the popPK model and the dedicated RI 
study (PN005), whereas the effect of severe renal impairment on imipenem exposure was predicted by the 
popPK model to be higher (5.17-fold) than observed in the study PN005 (2.51-fold).  
Demographic data from multiple antibacterial clinical programs were used to define the variance-covariance 
matrix between CrCL and body weight and simulate a large dataset of virtual patients. From this simulated 
dataset, virtual subjects were randomly selected in order to generate population with different degrees of 
renal function, including augmented renal function (ARC). Simulations were performed in NONMENM using 
the final population PK model.  The simulations performed included both unexplained between subject and 
residual error variability, as educated by the final PK model. PTA was simulated, according to the non-clinical 
PK/PD targets.

Special populations 
The effect of hepatic impairment has not been studied.  
A pharmacokinetic study comparing young and elderly healthy subjects as well as male and female subjects 
has been provided (8 subjects/group). On average, female subjects had a somewhat higher relebactam 
exposure than their male corresponding group (16% and 24% higher, respectively in the young and elderly 
groups). When comparing the effect of age in male and female elderly groups within the same gender, the 
elderly groups had higher mean exposures than young subjects of the same gender, increasing by 35% and 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
43%, respectively. Age was not found to be a clinically significant covariate in the popPK analysis, the age 
range in the dataset used for popPK modelling was 18-90 years with a median of 51 years. 
Relebactam PK was studied in a set of Japanese subjects (n=19), and data were in line with previous data 
from non-Japanese subjects. Race was considered of exploratory interest in the popPK analysis. Most patients 
in the popPK-dataset were white (n=739), but the dataset included also black (n=32) and Asian (n=44) 
subjects. Because of small number of subjects from other races, race was not included as a covariate in both 
imipenem and REL popPK models. A post hoc assessment of between subject variability with race showed no 
evidence of relationship between race and PK parameters for either imipenem or relebactam. 
In the popPK model, body weight was included as a covariate on V1 for both relebactam and imipenem, and 
on Cl for imipenem. The effect of body weight on relebactam or imipenem exposure due to body weight was 
however predicted to be minimal,  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
• 
In vitro 
An in vitro program was performed to assess the risk for relebactam being an inhibitor or inducer of drug 
metabolising enzymes and transporters. 
The Cmax (end of infusion) measured after 7 days of treatment with 250 mg relebactam 4 times daily in 
study P 001 was 49 µM. With a protein binding of 22% (corresponding to unbound fraction of 78%), unbound 
Cmax would be 38 µM. Therefore, according to the EMA’s guideline on the investigation of drug interactions, 
the concentration cut off for clinical relevance is calculated as 50 x Cmax,u which is in case of relebactam 
1900 µM ~2 mM. This was the concentration that was included in most of in vitro drug interaction studies 
with relebactam which was in accordance with the EMA/CHMP guideline on drug interactions. 
As the drug is given intravenously, interaction risks in the gastrointestinal tract or at first pass extraction is 
not expected. 
No signs of CYP enzyme inhibition (direct and time-dependent) or induction was observed in vitro up to a 
relebactam concentrations of 2000 µM. Relebactam at concentrations up to 500 µM did not inhibit uptake of 
probe substrates for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2K, BCRP and BSEP. Relebactam 
did not show inhibition of P-gp transporter at concentrations of up to 2000 µM in the in vitro experiments 
conducted with P-gp containing membrane vesicles and LLC-MDR1 cell monolayers. 
No in vitro data on the potential for imipenem or cilastatin to act as an inhibitor or inducer of drug 
metabolising enzymes or transporters have been presented.  
• 
In vivo 
Relebactam was shown to be a substrate of OAT3, OAT4, MATE1 and MATE2K in vitro. An in vivo study with 
probenecid as an inhibitor of OAT transporters was performed. Study MK-7655A-019 was an open-label, 
randomized, 2-period, crossover trial to investigate the effect of probenecid on the single-dose PK of 
relebactam (primary objective) and imipenem. 14 healthy 15 healthy subjects were included, and each 
subject received the following treatments in a randomized order: 1) single IV dose of 250-mg 
imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam; and 2) single oral dose of 1 g oral probenecid administered 1 hour prior to a 
single IV dose of 250-mg imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam. The washout interval between treatments was at 
least 7 days. 
Assessment report  
  
  
Relebactam exposure (AUC) was 1.24-fold (90% CI 1.19, 1.28) higher following administration with 
probenecid. Imipenem AUCs were approximately 1.16-fold (90% CI (1.13, 1.20) higher following 
administration with probenecid. 
In the ascending dose study P001V01, healthy subjects received relebactam and imipenem/cilastatin 
separately and in combination. An analysis of the 2-way drug interactions between REL and IMI (as individual 
components, imipenem and cilastatin) showed similar PK of the analytes when administered alone or in 
combination. Exposure of relebactam was similar with or without co-infusion of imipenem/cilastatin, the 
AUC0-∞ a geometric mean ratio (GMR) (90% CI) for 500 mg REL + 500 mg IMI compared to 500 mg REL 
alone were 1.02 (0.97, 1.06).  Exposure of imipenem was similar with or without co-infusion of REL. The 
AUC0-∞ for the 500 mg REL + 500 mg IMI / 500 mg IMI alone comparisons was 1.03 (0.95, 1.12), and the 
corresponding ratio for cilastatin was 0.91 (0.87, 0.95). 
The Recarbrio SmPC mentions two additional potential interactions, with ganciclovir and valproic acid.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The Applicant has performed a number of in vitro and in vivo PD and PK/PD studies. This section highlights 
the studies that describe the in vitro activity of relebactam, the potentiation of imipenem activity by the 
addition of relebactam in vitro and in vivo and the most important studies and analyses for dose selection of 
the single components of the fixed-dose-combination (FDC). It should be noted that because of the limited 
clinical development programme performed for this product in keeping with what is described in the 
Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial 
infections (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013) for products that are candidates to address an unmet medical need, the 
PK/PD analyses incorporating non-clinical PK/PD data and patient PK data is considered pivotal for dose 
selection. 
Mechanism of action 
Imipenem (IPM) is a carbapenem β-lactam antibacterial agent that inhibits bacterial cell-wall synthesis by 
targeting penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBPs are enzymes involved in the last steps of peptidoglycan 
synthesis. Imipenem is not hydrolysed by, and thus is stable to the majority of serine β-lactamases. 
Cilastatin (CIL) is a renal dehydropeptidase inhibitor that limits the renal metabolism of IPM. CIL does not 
have antibacterial activity. 
Relebactam (REL) is a novel diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) β-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits a variety of 
Ambler class A and C but not class B and D β-lactamases. REL has in itself no significant antibacterial activity 
at clinically relevant doses. The role of REL in the FDC is to restore the activity of imipenem in imipenem-
resistant gram-negative infections when the resistance is caused by production of β-lactamases within the 
spectrum of REL´s inhibitory activity.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology – in vitro 
In vitro activity studies 
In vitro susceptibility testing was conducted with imipenem/REL by testing varying concentrations of 
imipenem in the presence of a fixed concentration of 4 µg/mL REL. The Applicant has in general used CLSI 
susceptibility testing interpretive criteria in the dossier, unless otherwise stated. 
In enzyme inactivation studies for REL against β-lactamase enzymes it was shown that REL is a time-
dependent inhibitor of the carbapenem-hydrolysing β-lactamases KPC-2 and KPC-3 (belonging to Ambler 
class A) and the Pseudomonas-derived cephalosporinase PDC-1 (belonging to Ambler class C). The AmpC-
enzyme PDC is the β-lactamase responsible for resistance in the majority of imipenem-resistant P. 
aeruginosa. REL furthermore inhibits other class A and class C enzymes. 
Imipenem MICs in combination with various REL concentrations were evaluated against a panel of 108 clinical 
isolates of P. aeruginosa non-susceptible to IMI (CLSI interpretive criteria). The figure below shows the 
distribution of imipenem MIC values when different concentrations of REL were tested. 
Figure PD1.

REL (MK-7655) in imipenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa 
Imipenem MICs in combination with various REL concentrations were further evaluated against a panel of 76 
KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Against this panel a REL concentration of 4 µg/mL was sufficient to 
render 96% of the isolates susceptible interpreted with the CLSI breakpoint for susceptibility for IMI (1 
µg/mL), see table below. 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
 
Table PD1. 
Imipenem MIC and susceptibility parameters when combined with REL in an 
expanded panel of KPC-expressing clinical isolates 
Against a panel of 77 non-KPC-expressing Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates the percentage of susceptible 
isolates (up to 1 µg/mL) increased from 88% with IMI alone to 99% with the addition of 4 to 32 µg/mL REL 
(data not shown). Both ESBL and plasmid-borne AmpC enzymes were represented in this panel, alone and in 
combination. Some isolates had permeability mutations contributing to higher imipenem MIC values. 
Imipenem and imipenem/REL susceptibility were evaluated in large panels of P. aeruginosa isolates from the 
SMART global surveillance program from 2009 to 2016. There were only small changes in susceptibility 
profiles over the years. A summary from 2016 is shown in the table below:

surveillance program for imipenem alone and imipenem combined with 4 µg/mL of REL

Because of the stability of imipenem alone against many class A and C β-lactamase-producing 
Enterobacteriaceae the beneficial effect of adding REL to imipenem is most notable for isolates producing KPC 
(table below).

In studies with anaerobic organisms REL did generally not enhance the activity of imipenem. Imipenem/REL 
(as well as imipenem alone) is however expected to cover anaerobic organisms in typical mixed infections 
such as complicated intraabdominal infections (cIAI). 
Resistance to imipenem/REL 
Imipenem/REL is not active against isolates that produce class B β-lactamases and class D carbapenemases. 
Expression of certain alleles of the class A β-lactamase Guiana extended-spectrum β- lactamase (GES) and 
overexpression of PDC coupled with loss of imipenem entry porin OprD may confer resistance to 
imipenem/REL in P. aeruginosa. The expression of efflux pumps in P. aeruginosa does not affect activity of 
either imipenem or REL. Mechanisms of bacterial resistance that could decrease the antibacterial activity of 
imipenem/REL in Enterobacteriaceae include porin mutations affecting outer membrane permeability. 
Laboratory selection of resistance 
To determine frequencies of resistance and select representative resistant mutants, two sets of studies were 
performed (using Efficiency of plating [EOP] and Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test). All selection concentrations 
were based around and above the breakpoint for imipenem with REL concentrations in most experiments set 
to 4 µg/mL. 
In vitro selection for resistance was conducted in 4 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa with constitutive or 
inducible AmpC and OprD +/- and 5 isolates of K. pneumoniae producing class A or C enzymes, including 
KPC. 
In P. aeruginosa, mutants were not selected against all strains and at all concentrations of imipenem tested 
yielding a frequency below 2 × 10-9. In experiments where mutants were selected the resistance frequencies 
were between 2 × 10-8 to 4 × 10-9. In these mutants the imipenem and imipenem/REL MICs compared to the 
parent strain were increased 1- to 2-fold and 4-fold, respectively. 
In K. pneumoniae, at the lowest concentration of imipenem tested (all concentrations were at or above the 
IMI/REL MIC for the respective isolate) mutants were selected at frequencies of, at the lowest, 2 × 10-5. At 
the highest imipenem concentration tested (4 µg/mL; corresponding to 4-fold the CLSI breakpoint for 
imipenem) no resistant mutants were selected for two strains yielding a frequency of below 5 × 10-9. For the 
other strains, resistance mutants were selected at frequencies of ~2 × 10-8. These mutants had imipenem 
and imipenem/REL MICs compared to the parent strain that were increased 1- to >16-fold and 2- to 32-fold, 
respectively. 
In one of the isolates of K. pneumoniae expressing a KPC-2 with a very high MIC to imipenem, resistant 
variants were selected but the mechanism of resistance was not confirmed by whole genome sequencing. For 
one of the two other KPC-expressing Enterobacteriaceae for which mutants could be selected at 4× the 
breakpoint concentration of imipenem no regrowth was seen in hollow fibre studies for up to 72 hours even 
at concentrations of REL one-half the clinical dose. 
The mechanism underlying the increased concentration of REL required to restore susceptibility to imipenem 
in the mutants selected to the combination of imipenem and REL was investigated but remains unknown; 
however, no differences between the selected mutant and parent strains were observed for β-lactamase 
expression, β-lactamase induction by imipenem, or REL inhibition of β-lactamase activity. 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
Post-antibiotic effect 
A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 2 h was noted for sub-MICs of imipenem in the combination with 4 mg/L of 
REL. The PAE noted after exposure to IMI and REL followed by washout was prolonged to up to 6 h when 
sub-MICs of imipenem alone was added again after washout of imipenem and REL, reflecting a retained 
inhibitory effect against β-lactamases (post-inhibitor effect [PIE]) despite absence of REL in the medium. 
Effects of human body fluids on susceptibility to imipenem/REL 
The in vitro activity of imipenem/REL was similar in the presence of pulmonary surfactant, urine or serum. 
There was a trend to increased MICs at lower pH values. 
Hollow-fibre infection model (HFIM) studies 
In an HFIM-study the antibacterial activity and suppression of resistance of imipenem and imipenem/REL 
were investigated against four imipenem-resistant strains (one K. pneumoniae and three P. aeruginosa). For 
imipenem, 30-minute infusions simulating either a human 500 mg (low) or 1,000 mg (high) doses every 6 h 
were used. For REL, a dose of 500 mg (given over 30 min) every 6 h was simulated. Imipenem/REL 
considerably reduced the bacterial burden at 24 h, while failure with imipenem alone was seen against all 
isolates. Sustained suppression of bacterial growth at 72 h was achieved with simulated doses of 500 mg 
imipenem plus 500 mg REL in one K. pneumoniae and one P. aeruginosa strain. Against one P. aeruginosa 
strain regrowth was seen at 72 h with the imipenem low-dose regimen but not with the high-dose regimen. 
Against one P. aeruginosa strain, regrowth was detected at 48 h for both doses. The MIC results of the strain 
tested before and after the experiment are shown in the table below. Note that the imipenem MICs for the 3 
daughter isolates were not reduced as effectively by REL as those for the parent isolate. 
Table PD6. 
Post-HFIM susceptibility testing results for PA24226 and three random isolates

Free-drug exposures corresponding to clinical doses of imipenem 500 mg, q6h with and without REL 125 or 
250 mg, q6h were further evaluated against imipenem-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa and 
Enterobacteriaceae over 70 h in a hollow-fibre system. Both 125 mg and 250 mg doses of REL showed rapid 
and sustained bactericidal activity against 3/4 Pseudomonas strains (IMI MICs 16 to 32 µg/mL; IMI/REL MICs 
2 to 8 µg/mL). Against these strains, the bacterial CFU count was below the detectable limit of 10 CFU/mL in 
15 to 30 h and a 4-fold log10 reduction versus the starting inoculum was observed. Against one strain of P. 
aeruginosa (imipenem MIC 64 µg/mL; imipenem/REL MICs 16 µg/mL) the lower dose of REL was not 
efficacious and it took >50 h for imipenem + REL 250 mg to reduce the colony count to below detectable 
limits. 
Imipenem in combination with both doses of REL showed rapid and sustained bactericidal activity against a 
KPC-producing K. pneumoniae strain with greater than 5-fold log10 reduction in CFU within 6 to 12 h. 
Additionally, against 10 Enterobacteriaceae strains producing various class A and/or class C enzymes 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
imipenem and REL 250 mg (125 mg not tested) was efficacious against all strains with colony count 
reductions below the limit of detection and no grow-back. Against two of the strains that displayed lowest 
imipenem MICs (4 and 8 µg/mL, respectively), imipenem alone was as efficacious as the combination. 
In the same study the relationship between different PK/PD indices and REL´s activity was determined (figure 
below). The index fAUC/MIC and fAUC showed the best relationship with the activity of REL against P. 
aeruginosa. The REL fAUC/MIC target values associated with stasis, 1-log10 and 2-log10 bacterial load 
reduction for P. aeruginosa in the hollow fibre model were 2.9, 4.8 and 8.2, respectively.

The Applicant has not performed full dose-ranging for Enterobacteriaceae but used the clinical dosing 
regimen in these experiments. The Emax model fit for log10 bacterial load reduction versus AUC/MIC based on 
the P. aeruginosa HFIM data overlaid on the pooled Enterobacteriaceae HFIM data (figure below) shows that 
the target values at stasis, 1-log, and 2-log kill for Enterobacteriaceae are expected to be less than that for P. 
aeruginosa in the HFIM experiments because the data-points for bacterial reduction of Enterobacteriaceae are 
below the P. aeruginosa curve. This conflicts however with the findings in the neutropenic thigh model in 
which higher targets seems to be needed for K. pneumoniae than P. aeruginosa to achieve similar 
antibacterial effects (see below).

The data from this HFIM study against strains of P. aeruginosa was in addition used to evaluate the 
magnitude of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target (PDT) for imipenem needed to achieve 2-log10 
kill. It is well established that efficacy for imipenem and other β-lactam antibacterial agents is driven by the 
percentage of time during the dosing interval that the unbound fraction of the antibacterial is above the MIC 
(%fT>MIC). For carbapenems, literature information suggests that 20% fT>MIC is required for bacteriostatic 
effect, and at least 30% to 40% fT>MIC is required to achieve 1- to 2-log kill in vivo animal models. The 
Applicant proposes that the magnitude of the β-lactam target may be different when combined with a BLI. 
This was therefore investigated. Since sub-therapeutic REL doses were also studied, the REL potentiated 
IimipenemMI MIC was the imipenem MIC at the average concentration of REL (Cavg) achieved in each study 
(being approximately 4 mg/L in the REL 250 mg q6h regime which is proposed to be used generally in 
imipenem/REL MIC determinations). 
IMI and IMI/REL both showed efficacy and rapid bacterial killing with time in HFIM even when IMI doses were 
substantially subtherapeutic. Due to this, there was a very steep relationship between E and IMI %fT>MIC. 
This resulted in difficulty identifying TMIC50 which was estimated with a p-value >0.05 and thus was 
statistically not significant. To mitigate the TMIC50 identifiability issue, ten experimental runs with good 
response near 0%fT>MIC were excluded in an alternate sensitivity analysis. Specifically, the experimental 
runs mentioned were excluded due to significant change in bacterial burden at 24 hours from baseline even 
with very low IMI %fT>MIC (table below). 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
The parameter estimates and results of the Emax model fit after exclusion are shown in the table and figure 
below. Based on this analysis, the value of IMI % fT>MIC that is required for 2-log kill is about 6.5%. 
Based on the relationship between IMI % fT>MIC and PD effect, if one considers all HFIM experiment data, 
the IMI % fT>MIC required for 2-log kill is approximately 3%. With exclusions to allow model estimation, the 
estimated IMI % fT>MIC target of 6.5% for 2-log kill is according the Applicant therefore a conservative 
estimate of the IMI % fT>MIC requirement. In the HFIM, when the effect of REL is considered, the IMI % 
fT>MIC requirement was lowered significantly. This effect could according the Applicant be attributed to the 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
 
 
fact that the imipenem MIC in presence of REL is assessed at Cavg of REL, while in reality the concentration of 
REL fluctuates with time and in some strains exhibits a post-inhibitor effect. Using Cavg of REL may not fully 
capture the impact of REL on the potency of imipenem under dynamically changing concentration profiles 
thus producing higher potentiated MIC values and corresponding lower % fT>MIC values. 
Chemostat infection model studies 
Furthermore, the antibacterial effect of imipenem/REL was studied against Enterobacteriaceae and P. 
aeruginosa in a one compartment in vitro pharmacokinetic model over 168 h. One wild type E. coli strain, 
three K. pneumoniae strains (one AmpC producer, two KPC producers) and four strains of P. aeruginosa (one 
wild type, one isogenic mutant, one with porin loss and one with porin loss and AmpC beta-lactamase 
production) were employed. Imipenem/REL MICs were 0.06 to 0.5 mg/L for the Enterobacteriaceae strains 
and 0.25 to 1.0 mg/L for P. aeruginosa. Free drug serum concentrations of imipenem 500 mg q6h plus REL 
250 mg q6h were simulated. In addition, two strains of P. aeruginosa were exposed to imipenem plus REL 
plus amikacin. 
The objectives of this study were (1.) to describe the long term antibacterial effects against a range of strains 
with an without beta-lactamase production, (2.) to assess the risk of emergence of resistance by studying 
changes in population profiles and (3.) to assess the impact of the addition of amikacin to imipenem/REL 
simulations in terms of antibacterial effect and emergence of resistance. 
The Enterobacteriaceae strains were all rapidly killed showing a 3 log10 reduction in colony count by 6 h. The 
wild type E. coli strain and K. pneumoniae 42421 (KPC) were eradicated from the model by 6 h. The other 
KPC-producing strain K. pneumoniae 62267 was eliminated by 24 h and the AmpC-producing strain with 
porin loss (K. pneumoniae 47929) also showed a 3 log10 reduction in viable count at 6 h and was eradicated 
by 96 h. 
The P. aeruginosa strains all demonstrated a 3-4 log10 reduction in bacterial count by 6 h however only one 
strain was eradicated from the model - P. aeruginosa 17286 (a meropenem isogenic mutant) which was 
eliminated from the model by 96 h. The wild type strain P. aeruginosa 38475 and the P. aeruginosa strains 
with porin loss (P. aeruginosa 62267) and/or AmpC production (P. aeruginosa 47235) bacterial counts 
increased from 2 log10 at 6 h to 3-4 log10 at 168 h. 
No changes in population analysis profiles were seen for the E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains. One P. 
aeruginosa strain was eliminated from the model and therefore no progeny grew. For the other three strains 
of P. aeruginosa a 2.5 to 4.5 log10 growth was seen on the recovery and x2 MIC imipenem plus REL plates at 
168 h. No difference was observed between the parent and progeny imipenem plus REL MICs on subsequent 
testing. 
Primary pharmacology - In vivo 
IMI/REL evaluated in animal models of infection 
The in vivo efficacy of IMI/REL was assessed in several murine models of infection. In initial studies, 
treatment followed shortly after infection (disseminated infection with P. aeruginosa or K. pneumoniae and 
pulmonary infection with P. aeruginosa): 
Disseminated model of infection 
Mice were infected by intra-peritoneal injection with 2.2 × 106 CFU of P. aeruginosa CLB 24228 (IMI MIC = 
32; IMI/REL MIC = 8 µg/mL). REL was administered (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/dose) in combination with IMI (5 
mg/kg/dose) by continuous infusion for 60 minutes q6h for 24 hours. Treatment with this combination 
Assessment report  
  
  
resulted in 1.72, 3.13, and 3.73 log10 reduction in bacterial load in the spleen at REL doses of 10, 20, and 40 
mg/kg, respectively. Mice treated with IMI alone only had a modest reduction in P. aeruginosa tissue burden 
(0.45 log10). A reduction of bacterial tissue burden by >3 log10 was achieved in the 20 mg/kg/dose treatment 
group where the peak concentration of REL in plasma reached 108 μM. This translates to a 24-hour plasma 
exposure of approximately 57.1 mg×hour/L REL. 
Mice were infected by IP injection with 5.5 × 105 CFU of K. pneumoniae CL 6339 (IMI MIC = 64; IMI/REL MIC 
= 1 µg/mL). REL was administered (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/dose) in combination with IMI (5 mg/kg/dose) by 
continuous infusion for 60 minutes q6h for 24 hours. Treatment with this combination resulted in 2.29, 3.06, 
and 2.69 log10 reduction in spleen bacterial load at REL doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg, respectively. Mice 
treated with IMI alone had K. pneumoniae tissue burden equivalent to untreated animals. In this study a 2.29 
log10 reduction of bacterial tissue burden was achieved in the 20 mg/kg/dose treatment group. This 
translates to a 24-hour plasma exposure of approximately 36.2 mg×hour/L REL. 
Pulmonary infection model 
The in vivo efficacy of REL was also evaluated in a pulmonary model of infection using the IMI-resistant P. 
aeruginosa strain CLB 24228. Each mouse was infected by intra-nasal inoculation with 1.4 × 105 CFU. REL 
was administered (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/dose) in combination with IMI (5 mg/kg/dose) by continuous 
infusion for 60 minutes q6h for 24 hours. Treatment with this combination resulted in 2.37, 3.59, and 4.59 
log10 reduction in bacterial load in the lung at REL doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg, respectively. By way of 
comparison, mice treated with IMI alone had P. aeruginosa tissue burden equivalent to untreated animals. In 
this study, reduction of bacterial burden in the lung by 2.37 log10 CFU was achieved in the 20 mg/kg/dose 
treatment group. This translates to a 24-hour plasma exposure of approximately 37.0 mg×hour/L REL. 
Delayed pulmonary infection model 
The combination was further studied in a more clinically relevant model, a delayed therapy model of infection 
with P. aeruginosa with treatment initiated after the infection was already established. This model was 
adapted to a model earlier described in which a static response to therapy is considered predictive of clinical 
efficacy (Craig and Andes, 2008). 
A total of three independent delayed treatment studies were performed. In the three studies, P. aeruginosa 
(with an imipenem MIC 32; imipenem/REL MIC 8 µg/mL) tissue burden was approximately 105 CFU at 16.5 
hours post-infection and the bacterial load increased by >2 log10 CFU in untreated animals over the 
subsequent 24-hour period. In these studies, treatment with 5 mg/kg IMI alone had no significant effect. The 
dose of IMI is sub-therapeutic and approximately 13-fold lower than 500 mg equivalent humanized IMI dose 
in mouse (64 mg/kg). P. aeruginosa burden in these animals reached >7 log10 CFU in the lung. However, the 
combination of 5 mg/kg IMI together with 20 mg/kg REL had a static effect on P. aeruginosa tissue burden in 
this model. There was no significant increase in bacterial load in the lung compared to the burden at the start 
of therapy. Treatment regimens that combined 5 mg/kg IMI with either 40 or 80 mg/kg REL also imparted a 
static effect on P. aeruginosa burden in this model, while the combination of 5 mg/kg IMI with 10 mg/kg MK-
7655 did not. The 24-hour plasma exposure of REL required to reach target efficacy (defined as a static effect 
on tissue burden which was reached with the 20 mg/kg REL dose) is 40.0, 63.3 and 42.0 mg×hour/L, 
respectively in the three independent studies. This 24-hour plasma exposure translates to a free drug AUC0-24 
hr/MIC (potentiated) target of 4.0, 6.2 and 4.2, respectively. 
Additional studies were performed to expand the strains examined. Nine strains of P. aeruginosa (imipenem 
MICs 16 to 64 µg/mL; imipenem/REL MICs 2 to 16 µg/mL) and two strains of K. pneumoniae (imipenem MICs 
64; imipenem/REL MICs 0.25 to 0.5 µg/mL) were examined. Significant reduction in bacterial burden was 
Assessment report  
  
  
achieved for 10 of 11 P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae strains tested with sub-inhibitory IMI concentrations 
in combination with REL. 
Overall, in all the delayed pulmonary infection model experiments, an average 24-hour plasma exposure to 
achieve stasis against strains of P. aeruginosa of 41.9 mg×hour/L (range 11.1 to 148) translates to a mean 
free drug AUC0-24 hr/MIC target of 4.0 h (range 1.0 to 14.6 h). In the 15 experiments, that each included in 
general five animals per dose level, the free drug AUC0-24 hr/MIC (potentiated) target was below 5.0 h in 12 of 
15 studies and in the remaining three 6.2, 7.9 and 14.6 h, respectively. Strain CLB24228 was tested in six 
different experiments. It should be noted that the free drug AUC0-24 hr/MIC target had large within strain 
variation (1.1 to 6.2 h) 
For the two strains of K. pneumoniae tested of which one was tested in two sets of experiments, the average 
24-hour plasma exposure to achieve stasis was similar compare to the exposure needed for stasis against P. 
aeruginosa (41.4 mg×hour/L; range 20.5 to 81.3). However, possibly due to the lower IMI/REL MICs 
(potentiated) for the Klebsiella strains (0.25 to 0.5 µg/mL) compared to the Pseudomonas strains the free 
drug AUC0-24 hr/MIC to achieve stasis was several folds higher (70.5, 64.8 and 128.5, respectively). This 
would indicate that the relation between AUC/MIC is not constant regardless of potentiated MIC. 
Murine thigh model 
The PK/PD index best correlated to the activity of REL and PK/PD targets were explored in a neutropenic 
thigh infection model. Four strains of P. aeruginosa and two strains of K. pneumonia were studied. 
Neutropenic CD-1 mice were infected in each thigh 2 hours before treatment with an inoculum of 
approximately 5 × 106 CFU. The mice were treated with IMI every 2 hours (q2h) at lower or up to humanised 
doses in combination with REL in either a dose fractionation study or q2h for 24 hours and sacrificed for CFU 
determinations. 
For REL, various PK/PD indices such as area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), %T > CT (percent 
time above threshold concentration), and peak concentrations were correlated with efficacy as measured by 
change in bacterial burden (change in log CFU). The REL PK parameter that correlated best with efficacy 
across both P. aeruginosa and K. pneumonia was fAUC/MIC as demonstrated by the figures below when half 
or the full humanised dose of IMI was used in the experiments. The derived stasis,1-log kill and 2-log kill 
fAUC/MIC targets for P. aeruginosa were 3.3, 4.3 and 7, respectively. Notably, approximately 10-fold higher 
fAUC/MIC targets are needed for K. pneumoniae than P. aeruginosa to achieve similar antibacterial effects.

strain (8.2 and 10.6) was achieved when doses of IMI were 4- to 8-fold lower than the humanised dose. 
Therefore, there seem to be a need for more REL to achieve stasis when lower doses of IMI are evaluated. 
The internal MIC-value missing in the table for strain 6755 was ≤1 mg/L.

Summary of support for dose selection 
The PDTs derived from neutropenic mouse thigh model studies for REL (fAUC0-24hr/MIC≥5.2; which was the 
mean of the stasis targets from all P. aeruginosa experiments found in table PD7) and the IMI PK target of 
6.5% fT>MIC derived from HFIM studies were initially used to assess probability of joint target attainment 
based on popPK modelling with integrated Phase 1, 2 and 3 data. Based on these PTA simulations, the clinical 
dose of 500-mg IMI co-administered with 250-mg REL every 6 hours infused over 30 minutes will be 
satisfactory (PTA >90%) for the treatment of infections in subjects with different renal function categories up 
to an MIC of 4 mg/L (table PD8 and figure PD4).

However, the 6.5% fT>MIC target for IMI to achieve 2-log10 CFU reduction when combined with REL derived 
from the hollow-fibre model experiments is much lower than the well-established targets of 40% fT>MIC for 
IMI alone to achieve 2-log10 CFU reduction. Moreover, the finding of this lower target has not been confirmed 
in the neutropenic thigh model. Therefore, at the request of CHMP the Applicant has provided additional PTA 
simulations at the 40% (and 30%) fT>MIC target for IMI and 7.5 fAUC/MIC target for REL, corresponding to 
2-log10 CFU reduction (based on HFIM data) against P. aeruginosa. The target to achieve the 2-log10 CFU 
reduction for REL in the thigh model against P. aeruginosa was similar (7), which is why the 7.5 fAUC/MIC 
REL target chosen is considered acceptable for these analyses (figures and tables below). 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
 
In the PTA simulations using the 30% target for IMI, the proposed doses for IMI and REL are demonstrated 
to be sufficient to reach >90% PTA up to an MIC of 2 mg/L for subjects in all renal function categories with 
the lowest PTA (92.5%) for subjects with a creatinine clearance of 210-250 mL/min (data not shown). 
When the 40% target for IMI was used in the simulations, which was the target requested by the CHMP, it is 
shown that the proposed doses for IMI and REL are sufficient to reach >90% PTA up to an MIC of 2 mg/L for 
subjects in all renal function categories except those with augmented renal clearance (creatinine clearance 
above 150 mL/min) with the lowest PTA (76.9%) for subjects with a creatinine clearance of 210-250 mL/min. 
For subjects with augmented renal clearance a PTA above 90% is reached for pathogens up to an MIC of 1 
mg/L.

Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Thorough QTc evaluation 
In study P009, a total of 36 healthy adult subjects were included in order to evaluate the impact on the QTc 
interval of a single dose of 1150 mg REL. The study was a single dose randomized placebo- and positive 
controlled (moxifloxacin), 3-period, balanced crossover study with a washout period of at least 4 days 
between dosing and included 36 subjects. 
None of the subjects who received 1150 mg REL experienced a QTcP of < 450 msec at any pre-specified time 
point. Only one subject had a change from baseline of > 30 and < 60 msec, which occurred at 6 hours post 
dose. This subject experienced a 34 msec change from baseline which was not considered clinically significant 
and was not associated with any clinical signs/symptoms. The categorical analysis of PR and QRS indicate 
that MK-7655 had no effect on these parameters, and although the 95% CIs did not include zero at some 
time points the increases were very small. Analysis of other ECG parameters, including PR and RR intervals, 
QRS duration, T-wave morphology, presence of U-waves and outlier assessments could not identify any 
cardiac safety concerns related to administration of a single dose relebactam 1150 mg.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
As this is a standalone application, and as the approved products containing imipenem+cilastatin (e.g. 
Tienam) are not centrally approved, comprehensive data is requested for imipenem and cilastatin. At CHMP 
request, the Applicant has provided an overview of pharmacokinetic properties of imipenem and cilastatin.  
The Applicant has presented all bioanalytical reports, which were assessed by CHMP. 
The popPK models are important to provide input exposures to the PTA simulations for both imipenem and 
relebactam. In addition, the models need to capture well the effect of renal impairment to support the dosing 
recommendations in different degrees of renal dysfunction. Constructing separate models for relebactam and 
imipenem is considered adequate since there are no signs that concomitant administration of imipenem and 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
relebactam affect the plasma PK of either drug. It is noted that no popPK model was developed for cilastatin, 
and it is argued that this agent is only added to avoid degradation of imipenem, and that any significant 
changes in cilastatin PK will be seen in imipenem pharmacokinetics. This approach is agreed by CHMP.  
The most informative covariate on clearance for both imipenem and relebactam was Clcrea, which is 
expected for renally excreted drugs. An additional effect of weight was detected for imipenem only. It was 
tested in an exponential fashion with estimated exponent. Estimating both weight and CrCL on clearance may 
not be optimal since they are correlated. Normally, weight should be included in an allometric fashion, 
preferably with fixed exponents, to account for the effect of size on clearance. The applicant updated the 
popPK models for both imipenem and relebactam with bodyweight based allometric scaling with fixed 
exponents. The parameter estimates are similar to the previous models, and the RSEs are considered 
reasonable, both for imipenem and for relebactam. Overall, the updated models are similar to the previous 
models. This show robustness in the estimates and thus the developed models without fixed allometric 
scaling are accepted and the previously simulated PTAs (with correct targets) are accepted. 
No mass balance study with labelled relebactam was performed. This is considered acceptable by CHMP, as 
most of an administered dose was found unchanged in urine. Relebactam was found to be almost exclusively 
renally excreted. This was true also for cilastatin. Imipenem was also renally excreted, but to a somewhat 
lower extent (53-71%). CHMP noted that this is in line with the information in the approved SmPC of Tienam.  
Average renal clearance of relebactam was estimated to 135 ml/min. Passive filtration could be estimated to 
fuxGFR ~0.78x120 ml/min = 94 ml/min. As renal clearance appears to be higher than passive filtration, a 
role of renal secretion (around 40 ml/min of total clearance 148 ml/min  around 30% of total clearance) is 
expected. As active secretion is more than 25% of total elimination, the identities of the active transport 
proteins were investigated. Relebactam was shown to be an in vitro substrate of OAT3, OAT4, MATE1 and 
MATE2K, and these may play a role in the active secretion of relebactam. Only a minor clinical increase in 
exposure was however observed when the OAT transporters were inhibited with probenecid, in line with the 
relatively small expected role of active secretion.  
The Applicant has performed an acceptable dedicated renal impairment study and results are presented in 
different groups in relation to absolute creatinine clearance, which is endorsed. As there is a larger effect of 
renal impairment on relebactam PK than on imipenem PK due to a higher fe, a dose adjustment with the 
same ratio between the components can never obtain the same exposure in all renal function groups for both 
entities. A slightly higher exposure to relebactam in patients with renal impairment is probably acceptable to 
retain sufficient imipenem exposure in all groups. The effect of renal impairment on cilastatin exposure has 
not been fully addressed in this application, but in the SmPC of Tienam the magnitude of effect of mild, 
moderate and renal impairment is reported to be in the same range as for relebactam (AUC increase up to 
1.6, 1.9 and 5.6-fold). The proposed dose reductions appear to be fully in line with the approved dosing of 
Tienam and is deemed acceptable by CHMP. 
Apart from renally impaired patients, there are no major concerns regarding pharmacokinetic alterations in 
other special population. No effect of hepatic impairment is expected on the PK of any of the compounds, and 
thus lack of data is acceptable. As expected for a renally eliminated compound, male subjects had a slightly 
higher clearance of relebactam than females, and elderly had a somewhat lower clearance than younger 
subjects in the study. This is in line with an expected difference in absolute renal function. No major effect of 
weight on clearance is expected except the effect on renal elimination, and thus dose adjustment based on 
absolute creatinine clearance rather than on body weight is supported. No effect of race is expected, and the 
limited data available (in particular a PK study in Japanese subjects), did not suggest any effect of race on 
the PK of neither imipenem nor relebactam.  
Assessment report  
  
  
A standard set of in vitro experiments has been performed investigating relebactam as an inhibitor or inducer 
of CYP enzymes and transporters. No signs of inhibition or induction were observed. 
In vitro studies with pooled human liver microsomes were conducted in order to investigate inhibitory 
potential (direct and time-dependent) towards 7 CYP isoforms, namely: CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Experiments in cryopreserved human hepatocytes from 3 donors were 
conducted to investigate induction potential for CYP3A4, CYP2B6 and CYP1A2. All in vitro experiments with 
CYP enzymes included relebactam concentrations of up to 2 mM (as required by EMA/CHMP guideline on drug 
interactions). 
The transporter inhibition experiments were performed at maximum concentrations somewhat lower than the 
worst-case concentrations stipulated by the DDI guideline. However, no trends towards concentration-
dependent inhibitions were observed within a quite wide concentration range of relebactam between 1 and 
500 µM. These experiments are therefore considered acceptable and no further data are requested. 
Relebactam and imipenem are both renally eliminated, partly by renal secretion. The risk of drug-drug 
interactions with inhibitors of renal transporters however appears low. The 24% increase in AUC of 
relebactam observed in the DDI study with probenecid confirms a role, although minor, of OAT-transporters 
in the secretion of relebactam.  The results concerning imipenem are in line with previous knowledge as 
expressed in the SmPC of Tienam. In Tienam SmPC the effect of probenecid on the PK of cilastatin is also 
mentioned, informing that probenecid doubled cilastatin plasma levels but did not influence the amount of 
cilastatin found in urine. Moreover, in Tienam SmPC the effect of probenecid on cilastatin’s plasma exposure 
(2-fold increase) and its half-life (2-times longer) is also described, however Applicant has not 
quantified/presented cilastatin’s exposure from the current in vivo experiment with probenecid. CHMP agreed 
with the Applicant that the PK increases observed for both relebactam and imipenem are modest and are not 
considered clinically meaningful.  
The Applicant was asked by CHMP to perform a literature search and to discuss if there are any new drug-
drug interactions of potential relevance for imipenem and/or cilastatin which should be added to the SmPC.  
The Applicant has performed search in the “Company’s Product Literature Database, a product related 
database that contains abstracts of published clinical articles on company-owned products” and concluded 
that there were no new published articles that are providing new relevant information regarding drug-drug 
interactions involving imipenem and/or cilastatin. CHMP noted the above. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
IPM (a carbapenem β-lactam antibacterial agent) and CIL (a renal dehydropeptidase inhibitor that limits the 
renal metabolism of IMI) are known active substances authorised as FDCs (e.g. Tienam) in EU countries since 
the 1980s. REL is a novel diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) β-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits a variety of Ambler 
class A and C but not class B and D β-lactamases. Because IMI is stable to the majority of serine β-
lactamases, the most important role of REL in the FDC is the ability to inhibit KPC- and PDC carbapenemases 
in Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, respectively. With regards KPC, the dossier is focussed on REL´s 
ability to restore the susceptibility of IMI in strains expressing the most prevalent KPC subtypes (KPC-2 and 
KPC-3). Although the number of isolates carrying other KPC subtypes were relatively limited the data 
provided suggests that REL inhibits also other KPC subtypes.

In vitro 
Against a panel of P. aeruginosa strains, IMI MIC values shifted downwards to lower concentrations as the 
concentration of REL increased up to 16 µg/mL. Additional increase of REL concentration above 16 µg/mL 
added minimal activity. Against strains of Enterobacteriaceae, REL concentrations above 4 µg/mL added little 
to the activity of IMI. Since the Cavg of the clinical REL dose (250 mg q6h) is approximately 4 µg/mL it could 
be anticipated that a higher dose of REL in the FDC could potentially improve the activity of IMI further, at 
least against IMI-resistant P. aeruginosa. 
When IMI and IMI/REL susceptibility were evaluated in large panels of P. aeruginosa isolates from the SMART 
global surveillance program there was a shift downwards in MIC90 from 16 mg/L to 4 mg/L. When all IMI-
non-susceptible isolates from all sources were pooled (isolates with IMI MICs ≥4 mg/L based on CLSI criteria) 
it is noted that 75.4% of these isolates were susceptible to IMI/REL based on EUCAST susceptibility testing 
interpretive criteria for IMI. At an IMI MIC above 32 mg/L very few isolates of P. aeruginosa become 
susceptible when REL is added. The higher the IMI MIC, the more likely it is that the isolates produce metallo 
β-lactamases (class B) which are not within the inhibitory spectrum of REL. 
For Enterobacteriaceae the beneficial effect of adding REL to IMI is especially noted for isolates producing 
KPC. The IMI MIC90 for KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (SMART global surveillance study) shifted from 
≥32 mg/L to 1 mg/L when REL was added. For non-KPC- but ESBL- or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae 
only 2 to 4-fold shifts in MIC90 were noted. These shifts do not significantly decrease the percentage of 
resistant isolates as per the EUCAST cut-off for resistance (>4 mg/L) as compared for the effect of REL in 
KPC-producers because of the inherent stability of IMI to ESBL- and AmpC-enzymes. 
Because of the inhibitory spectrum of REL, IMI/REL is not expected to be active against isolates that produce 
class B β-lactamases and class D carbapenemases. Expression of certain alleles of the class A β-lactamase 
Guiana extended-spectrum β- lactamase (GES) and overexpression of PDC coupled with loss of imipenem 
entry porin OprD may confer resistance to imipenem/relebactam in P. aeruginosa. The expression of efflux 
pumps in P. aeruginosa does not affect activity of either imipenem or relebactam. Mechanisms of bacterial 
resistance that could decrease the antibacterial activity of IMI/REL in Enterobacteriaceae include porin 
mutations affecting outer membrane permeability. 
Based on selection of resistance studies, the Applicant concluded that spontaneous resistance against 
IMI/REL is anticipated to occur at a very low frequency among Pseudomonas and most KPC-expressing 
Klebsiella. It is however clear that at least for some isolates the frequency of spontaneous resistance 
mutation is not negligible and the risk for selection of resistance during treatment cannot be excluded. 
The antibacterial activity and suppression of resistance of IMI and IMI/REL were investigated in various HFIM 
experiments simulating different doses of IMI and REL against a reasonable number of IMI-resistant P. 
aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae isolates. 
Against the Enterobacteriaceae isolates IMI/REL doses of 500/250 mg was sufficient to achieve rapid killing 
and to prevent regrowth. This was also true for the majority of P. aeruginosa strains, however against one 
strain with an IMI/REL MIC of 16 mg/L the IMI/REL dose of 500/125 mg was not efficacious. At 500/250 mg, 
although a 4-log10 reduction was reached and regrowth was prevented, the killing rate was significantly 
slower than for other isolates tested. Against one P. aeruginosa isolate with an IMI/REL MIC of 4 mg/L 
regrowth was detected at 48 h despite the highest doses of IMI/REL simulated (1000/500 mg q6h). 
These findings suggest that at least for some P. aeruginosa isolates the dose of IMI and/or REL would 
preferably have been higher than the clinical dose chosen to optimise the antibacterial effect and suppression

of resistance. It is noted that the starting inoculum in the HFIM studies were 105 to 106 CFU/mL. A higher 
starting inoculum increases the likelihood of including pre-existing mutants. Therefore, the study design may 
not have been optimised to select for such mutants. 
The Applicant has provided support for their conclusion that REL´s activity is best correlated with fAUC/MIC 
based on data obtained using the hollow fibre infection model. The Applicant has clearly focussed their dose-
ranging experiments on P. aeruginosa and not performed dose-ranging for Enterobacteriaceae but used the 
clinical dosing regimen in these experiments. It is furthermore clear from the figures that q6h dosing was 
most frequently used in the experiments also for P. aeruginosa. There seems to be a time-dependency of the 
activity of REL in that the activity increases with more frequent dosing. However, it is unclear whether this 
correlation would come out stronger than the correlation of REL´s activity to fAUC/MIC if the dose-ranging 
was less focussed on q6h dosing. However, the PK/PD index that best correlated with RELs activity for P. 
aeruginosa based on the data provided was fAUC and fAUC/MIC (r2 = 0.71) making it reasonable to claim 
that fAUC/MIC as an index relevant to predict the activity of REL. This was furthermore consistent with the 
findings in the neutropenic thigh model (see below). The REL fAUC/MIC target values associated with stasis, 
1-log10 and 2-log10 bacterial load reduction for P. aeruginosa in the hollow fibre model were 2.9, 4.8 and 8.2, 
respectively. 
It is accepted that the PK/PD index best descriptive of efficacy for IMI is % fT>MIC. The Applicant argues that 
based on a single HFIM study that the % fT>MIC required for 2-log kill of IMI when combined with REL is 
6.5% fT>MIC instead of the historical target to achieve similar bactericidal effect of at least 40% fT>MIC. 
This was the target considered acceptable by the CHMP in the assessment of the IMI dose in the referral 
procedure for Tienam (EMA/513740/2011) which led to the current dose recommendations for IMI when used 
alone. The lower target found could according to the Applicant be due to an overestimation of the IMI/REL 
MIC with the current method and that the IMI/REL MIC should be treated as a dynamic related to the varying 
REL plasma concentration. However, the Applicant has not provided any new experimental support of the 
6.5% fT>MIC target for IMI when combined with REL derived from HFIM studies as requested by the CHMP. 
If this finding would have been confirmed by repeated HFIM studies and in neutropenic murine thigh model 
studies in IMI susceptible and non-susceptible isolates it would likely support the use of this lower target in 
the PTA simulations. 
As noted by the original PTA simulations provided by the Applicant and those simulations that use 30% and 
40% fT>MIC IMI targets, it is the dose of IMI that limits the utility of IMI/REL. A lower IMI target would likely 
support the possibility to treat pathogens with higher MICs which would be very valuable at least for P. 
aeruginosa. The Applicant´s argues that the model used, and strains tested, should be enough to rely on the 
lower 6.5% IMI target. However, there is no proof-of-concept that a β-lactam target will be lower when 
combined with a β-lactamase inhibitor. None of the earlier applicants for BL/BLI combinations has explored 
this in detail. The lack of confirmation of the lower IMI target and the overall lack of positive controls in HFIM 
and animal model studies is a weakness of the application but also for the understanding of the effect on the 
β-lactam target when combined with a β-lactamase inhibitor. The use of historical targets for the β-lactam 
alone have been considered acceptable in earlier applications for BL/BLI combinations. 
It should be noted that because the finding of the 6.5% fT>MIC target has not been confirmed, it questions 
the validity of conclusions drawn for REL achieved in the same in vitro system. The issue of using REL targets 
derived from the HFIM model remains despite similar target values achieved in the HFIM and neutropenic 
murine thigh models.

In vivo 
The in vivo efficacy of IMI/REL has been assessed in several murine models of infection. 
In the delayed pulmonary infection model a static response to therapy in this model is considered indicative 
of clinical efficacy (Craig and Andes, 2008). Three sets of experiments were performed with IMI/REL (with 
different doses of REL) and IMI alone (5 mg/kg q6h) against one IMI-non-susceptible strain of P. aeruginosa. 
A dose of REL of at least 20 mg/kg q6h resulted in a static effect. The plasma exposures of the 20 mg/kg 
dose of REL were 40.0, 63.3 and 42.0 mg×hour/L, respectively in the three independent studies 
corresponding to a free drug AUC0-24 hr/MIC target of 4.0, 6.2 and 4.2, respectively. 
Additional experiments using the delayed pulmonary infection model were performed with IMI/REL against 
nine strains of P. aeruginosa and two strains of K. pneumoniae resistant to IMI. Stasis was achieved against 
8 of 9 isolates of P. aeruginosa. The average 24 h plasma exposure to achieve stasis against P. aeruginosa 
was 41.9 mg×hour/L (range 11.1 to 148) which translates to a mean free drug AUC0-24 hr/MIC target of 4.0 
(range 1.0 to 14.6). As some strains were tested several times a relatively high within strain variation of the 
activity was noted (six-fold). The average 24-hour plasma exposure to achieve stasis against K. pneumoniae 
(41.4 mg×hour/L; range 20.5 to 81.3) was essentially comparable to the exposure needed for stasis against 
isolates of P. aeruginosa. However, due to the lower IMI/REL MICs for the Klebsiella strains the free drug 
AUC0-24 hr/MIC to achieve stasis was several folds higher (free drug AUC0-24 hr/MIC 70.5, 64.8 and 128.5, 
respectively). 
The Applicant has provided support for their conclusion that REL´s activity is best correlated with fAUC/MIC 
based on data obtained using the neutropenic mouse thigh model. Graphs for fAUC, fCmax, %fT>CT (using 
different thresholds), fAUC/MIC and fCmax/MIC are provided and the dosing interval for REL used for each 
data-point are displayed by different colours in the graphs as requested. Graphs for the four P. aeruginosa 
and two K. pneumoniae strains are presented separately. The Applicant has confirmed that IMI was given 
every 2 h in combination with different doses of REL and moreover that the control is IMI without the addition 
of REL. 
Clearly, dose-fractionation was only tested for one isolate each of P. aeruginosa (pa24228) and K. 
pneumoniae (kp6755). All other isolates were tested at different exposures but only with Q2h dose-regimens. 
At this dose-regimen the isolates behaved generally similar with increased killing at increasing exposures. 
The focus on the Q2h dose-regimen is reasonable for this fixed dose combination because the Q2h regimen in 
mice is corresponding to Q6h human dose-regimens, the dose-regimen used for IMI. With this dose-regimen 
there was a good correlation between REL´s fAUC/MIC and bacterial killing. It is furthermore noted that in 
addition to the increased killing with increasing exposure there is also a time-dependent component reflected 
by increased killing when similar total daily doses where given more often. While it may be assumed that 
dosing REL even more frequently possibly could increase the killing even further it is not reasonable to 
require that this should be studied further for the reasons stated above. 
As discussed above q2h dosing was the most frequently used regimen and the dose-range tested was limited 
for some of the regimens. In line with the HFIM dose-ranging studies this somewhat hampers the ability to 
draw reliable conclusions on the PK/PD index best correlated to REL`s activity. However, based on the data 
at hand the PK/PD index that best correlated with RELs activity for both species was fAUC/MIC (for K. 
pneumoniae %fT>CT of 1 mg/L correlated similarly well). With the good correlation of REL´s activity to 
fAUC/MIC noted it is reasonable to use this index to explore PK/PD targets. 
The Applicant has explained that they used the pooled data to detect the REL target to achieve stasis, 1-log10 
and 2-log10 CFU reductions instead of a 90th percentile approach as requested by the CHMP. This was because 
Assessment report  
  
  
it not only allows characterisation of a robust PK/PD relationship but also provides a sufficiently detailed 
dataset which can cover the entire PK/PD relationship with less uncertainty on the PK/PD curve. The derived 
stasis,1-log kill and 2-log kill fAUC/MIC targets for P. aeruginosa were 3.3, 4.3 and 7, respectively. Notably, 
approximately 10-fold higher fAUC/MIC targets are needed for K. pneumoniae than P. aeruginosa to achieve 
similar antibacterial effects. 
The Applicant has provided additional plots based on neutropenic thigh model data with P. aeruginosa and K. 
pneumoniae separately using correction with unpotentiated imipenem MIC-values (data not shown). The 
PK/PD relationship of K. pneumoniae has higher variability when unpotentiated imipenem MIC values are 
used for the derivation of fAUC/MIC as compared to PK/PD relationship plotted using the potentiated IMI MIC. 
However, as discussed above, when the fAUC corrected by the potentiated MIC is used as PK/PD index there 
is a disconnect between species with regards the PK/PD target (PDT), with lower PDTs for P. aeruginosa than 
for K. pneumoniae to achieve a similar antibacterial effect. This disconnect is also seen when unpotentiated 
MICs are used for the derivation of fAUC/MIC. Again, this questions the conclusion that the fAUC/MIC is the 
best PK/PD index. Although the correlation within each species is somewhat stronger for fAUC/MIC than for 
fAUC alone the use of fAUC corrected by the MIC creates a 10-fold difference in PDTs between P. aeruginosa 
and K. pneumoniae. When looking at fAUCs without correction of MICs there seem to be relatively similar 
exposures needed between species for similar bacterial killing (e.g. an exposure of approximately 30 mg*h/L 
are needed to achieve 1-log kill for the P. aeruginosa AND K. pneumoniae isolates; see figure PD3a and 3b). 
Even though fAUC possibly could be the better PK/PD index to derive PDTs, when considering different 
species, this issue is not further pursued. The Applicant´s use of the 2 log10 kill fAUC/MIC targets for P. 
aeruginosa in the PTA simulations and justification provided in the former round of assessment that the REL 
dose in combination with IMI is expected to be sufficient also against infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae 
is considered acceptable. 
Dose selection and probability of target attainment 
The PDTs derived from neutropenic mouse thigh model studies for REL (fAUC0-24hr/MIC≥5.2; which was the 
mean of the stasis targets from all P. aeruginosa experiments found in table PD7) and the IMI PK target of 
6.5% fT>MIC derived from HFIM studies were initially used to assess probability of joint target attainment 
based on popPK modelling with integrated Phase 1, 2 and 3 data. Based on these PTA simulations, the clinical 
dose of 500-mg IMI co-administered with 250-mg REL every 6 hours infused over 30 minutes will be 
satisfactory (PTA >90%) for the treatment of infections in subjects with different renal function categories up 
to an MIC of 4 mg/L 
However, the 6.5% fT>MIC target for IMI to achieve 2-log10 CFU reduction when combined with REL derived 
from the hollow-fibre model experiments is much lower than the well-established targets of 40% fT>MIC for 
IMI alone to achieve 2-log10 CFU reduction. Moreover, the finding of this lower target has not been confirmed 
in the neutropenic thigh model. Therefore, at the request of CHMP the Applicant has provided additional PTA 
simulations at the 40% (and 30%) fT>MIC target for IMI and 7.5 fAUC/MIC target for REL, corresponding to 
2-log10 CFU reduction (based on HFIM data) against P. aeruginosa. The target to achieve the 2-log10 CFU 
reduction for REL in the thigh model against P. aeruginosa was similar (7) why the 7.5 fAUC/MIC REL target 
chosen is considered acceptable for these analyses. 
When the 40% target for imipenem was used in the simulations, which was the target requested by the 
CHMP, it is shown that the proposed doses for IMI and REL are sufficient to reach >90% PTA up to an MIC of 
2 mg/L for subjects in all renal function categories except those with augmented renal clearance (creatinine 
clearance above 150 mL/min) with the lowest PTA (76.9%) for subjects with a creatinine clearance of 210-
Assessment report  
  
  
250 mL/min. For subjects with augmented renal clearance a PTA above 90% is reached for pathogens up to 
an MIC of 1 mg/L. 
Clearly it is the dose of imipenem in the FDC, which is half of the highest dose recommended for authorised 
imipenem products, that limits the utility of the FDC and that the choice of the 500 mg q6h IMI dose could be 
questioned. However, taking into account what is recommended in the product information for EU authorised 
products containing imipenem without the addition of REL and EUCAST recommended breakpoints for 
imipenem alone, an imipenem dose of 500 mg q6h (or 1 g q8h) is considered adequate with the exception of 
treatment of very severe infections (exemplified in the EU SmPCs for IMI products alone with neutropenic 
patients with fever) and for the treatment of less susceptible bacterial species (such as P. aeruginosa). In 
such situations 1000 mg IMI q6h should be used. As an IMI/REL susceptibility breakpoint of 2 mg/L is 
recommended for P. aeruginosa rather than 4 mg/L as recommended for IMI alone, for which 1000 mg q6h 
would be needed, the dose of IMI/REL is acceptable for the treatment of P. aeruginosa up to this lower 
breakpoint. However, the dose is not considered sufficient to reach the CHMP recommended IMI target of 
40% fT>MIC for subjects with ARC as shown by the PTA simulations above. Therefore, an IMI dose of 500 
mg q6h in combination with REL is considered acceptable provided that the message that the 500 mg q6h 
IMI dose may not be sufficient for patients with ARC is conveyed in the SmPC. Moreover, CHMP asked that a 
similar wording as in the SmPC for products with IMI alone with regards dosing in neutropenic patients and 
those with very severe infections is included in the IMI/REL´s product information. 
The Applicant has provided the following justification for the use of REL´s PK/PD target for P. aeruginosa also 
for the Enterobacteriaceae in the PTA analyses: The effect of REL on the susceptibility to IMI of KPC-
producing Enterobacteriaceae is more pronounced than the effect on IMI non-susceptible P. aeruginosa. It 
can be noted by the surveillance data provided that the addition of 4 mg/L of REL to IMI shifts the MIC-
distributions more to the left for Enterobacteriaceae than for P. aeruginosa (with a factor of 32-64 and 2-8, 
respectively). Consequently, it is agreed that REL PK/PD targets for P. aeruginosa can be used also for 
Enterobacteriaceae. Additional PTA simulations with separate target values for Enterobacteriaceae are not 
considered necessary, since the lower potentiated MIC’s compared to P. aeruginosa will allow for target 
attainment notwithstanding the higher fAUC/MIC ratios associated with e.g. 1 log kill (notably, when AUC was 
not adjusted for potentiated MIC, the relation between exposure and log kill was roughly similar for 
Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa). 
According to the Applicant this is further supported by the overlay of the Emax model fit to P. aeruginosa HFIM 
data with the Enterobacteriaceae HFIM data, which shows that the PK/PD target values at stasis, 1-log and 2-
log kill for Enterobacteriaceae are expected to be less than that for P. aeruginosa. Again, it should be noted 
that the HFIM studies are not considered reliable for inferences, since the findings on IMI PK/PD are deviant 
from expectation and have not been appropriately replicated with a positive control. Interestingly, as 
discussed above this conclusion conflicts with the findings in the neutropenic thigh model in which 
approximately 10-fold higher fAUC/MIC targets are needed for K. pneumoniae than P. aeruginosa to achieve 
similar antibacterial effects. In fact, this finding is not compatible with the concept of correcting the fAUC with 
the MIC (both the potentiated and unpotentiated MIC) as this creates a difference of PDTs across species. 
The use of the potentiated IMI/REL MIC in the PTA simulations is acceptable because of the similar ratio of 
the unpotentiated to the potentiated MIC for the strains tested.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The characterisation of relebactam pharmacokinetics is acceptable.  
Pharmacodynamics 
As this application relies on a limited clinical programme that does not independently demonstrate the 
efficacy of imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, the clinical pharmacology programme, including non-clinical 
PK/PD analyses and PTA simulations using clinical PK data, is pivotal to the application. 
Based on the data provided and despite the weaknesses noted including the lack of positive controls in the 
non-clinical studies it is considered that the clinical dose of imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam 500/500/250 mg 
q6h has been acceptably justified provided updates of the SmPC to convey the uncertainties with regards the 
adequacy of the dose for the treatment of patients with augmented renal clearance, very severe infections 
and subjects with concurrent neutropenia.

This was a phase 3, randomised, double blind, active-controlled, multicentre study of IMI/REL compared with 
colistin (in the form of colistimethate sodium [CMS]) plus IMI (treatment group 2) in adult subjects with 
cUTI, cIAI or HAP/VAP caused by imipenem-nonsusceptible gram-negative organisms. Randomisation was 
stratified by infection type.

In addition to the randomised subjects, eligible subjects could also be enrolled into a third non-randomised, 
open-label treatment group (treatment group 3) to receive IMI/REL. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Key inclusion criteria included the following: 
•  Subject was ≥18 years of age at screening 
•  Adults (≥18 years of age) who required hospitalization and treatment with IV antibiotic therapy for a 
new, persistent, or progressing bacterial infection with at least 1 of the following primary infection 
types: 
•  HAP or VAP 
• 
• 
cUTI 
cIAI 
•  Culture of specimen obtained from primary infection site within 1 week of trial entry indicated the 
isolate met the following criteria: 
•  Treatment Groups 1 and 2: Bacterial, gram-negative, imipenem non-susceptible, and 
imipenem/REL- and colistin-susceptible. 
•  Treatment Group 3: Bacterial, gram-negative, imipenem non-susceptible, colistin non-
susceptible, and imipenem/REL-susceptible. 
Key exclusion criteria included the following: 
•  Subject had an APACHE II score >30 at Screening. 
•  Subject had an estimated or actual CrCl of less than 15 mL/min or was undergoing haemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis at the time of enrolment. 
•  Subject was anticipated to be treated with concomitant systemic antimicrobial agents with known 
coverage of gram-negative bacteria of interest (i.e., Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp. and 
gram-negative anaerobic bacilli). 
• 
Treatment Group 1 and 2 only: Subject received treatment with any form of systemic colistin for >24 
hours within the 72 hours immediately prior to initiation of trial treatment. 
Treatments 
Patients in treatment groups 1 and 2 were randomised to: 
• 
IMI/REL 500/250 mg q6h + colistin placebo, OR 
•  Colistin as CMS (colistimethate sodium) with a loading dose of 300 mg CBA (colistin base 
activity) followed by a maintenance dose of 150 CBA after 12 h and repeated q12h + IMI 500 
mg q6h. 
The dose of IMI/REL and colistin were reduced in patients with renal impairment. For cUTI and cIAI the 
treatment durations were 5 to 21 days and for HAP/VAP 7 to 21 days. 300 mg CBA corresponds to ~720 mg 
CMS or 9 million IU.

Patients in treatment group 3 received IMI/REL 500/250 mg q6h only. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
1. To estimate the proportion of subjects with favourable overall response to IMI/REL (Treatment Group 1 
only) and to CMS + IMI (Treatment Group 2). The overall response was estimated based on the following: 
(a) survival (based upon all-cause mortality) through Day 28 post-randomization in subjects with HAP/VAP, 
(b) clinical response at Day 28 post-randomization for subjects with cIAI, and (c) the composite clinical and 
microbiological response at the Early Follow-up Visit (EFU Visit; Day 5 to 9 following end of therapy [EOT]) 
for subjects with cUTI. 
Key secondary objectives: 
1. To estimate the proportion of subjects with a favourable clinical response to IMI/REL (Treatment Group 1 
only) and CMS + IMI (Treatment Group 2) at Day 28 post-randomization. 
2. To estimate the incidence of all-cause mortality through Day 28 post randomization in Treatment Group 1 
(IMI/REL) and in Treatment Group 2 (CMS + IMI). 
3. To estimate the proportion of subjects who experience treatment-emergent nephrotoxicity in Treatment 
Group 1 (IMI/REL) and in Treatment Group 2 (CMS + IMI). 
Additional objective 
Additional analyses were planned prior to unblinding and locking the clinical database of which the following 
alternate definition of favourable overall response was supposed to meet CHMP expectations for the primary 
objective: 
1. To estimate the proportion of subjects with favourable overall response to IMI/REL (Treatment Group 1 
only) and to CMS + IMI (Treatment Group 2). The overall response was estimated based on the following: 
(a) clinical response at EFU for HAP/VAP and cIAI and microbiological response at EFU for subjects with cUTI.

1. The proportion of subjects with a favourable overall response at EFU as assessed for each of the 3

• cUTI: microbiological eradication 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
An interactive voice response system / integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS) was used for 
randomisation. Subjects were assigned randomly in a 2:1 ratio to IMI/REL + placebo to CMS or CMS + IMI, 
respectively. Randomisation was stratified according to infection types. 
Statistical methods 
The study was planned to randomise approximately 54 subjects in a 2:1 ratio into 2 treatment groups in 
order to obtain a minimum of 45 subjects who met the criteria for inclusion in the microbiological modified 
intent-to-treat (mMITT) population. Another 5 to 10 subjects with imipenem-nonsusceptible and colistin-
nonsusceptible bacterial infection was planned to be enrolled into a third open-label treatment group. The 
sample sizes planned for the study arose from logistic feasibility and were not driven by statistical 
considerations. 
No formal statistical testing was performed for the efficacy endpoints. Within group 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for efficacy endpoints were calculated using the Agresti & Coull method. In addition, between-group 
90% CIs for the primary and key secondary endpoints were calculated using the stratified Miettinen and 
Nurminen method, an unconditional, asymptotic method. The between-group estimates were stratified by 
infection type, where appropriate. 
For the primary endpoint evaluation in the mMITT population and for secondary and exploratory endpoints, 
any subject missing an evaluation for a specific endpoint at any particular visit was considered a “failure” for 
that endpoint. 
Analysis populations 
The microbiological modified Intention to Treat (mMITT) population (all randomised subjects who 
receive at least one dose of IV study therapy and who have at least 1 confirmed imipenem-nonsusceptible, 
colistin-susceptible, and imipenem/REL-susceptible gram-negative baseline bacterial pathogen) was the 
primary population for efficacy analyses. 
The per-protocol (PP) population will serve as the secondary population for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The PP population is a subset of the mMITT population who also meet the following criteria: 
1.  Meet important diagnostic criteria for entry into the study 
2.  Have no significant deviation from the protocol that could impact the assessment of efficacy 
3.  Receive the minimum duration of IV study therapy 
In support of evaluation efficacy assessments include evaluation of clinical response. The clinical response 
was categorised as favourable or unfavourable. To be considered a favourable clinical response at the EFU 
and Day 28 post-randomisation visit the subject should be categorised as being cured or having sustained 
cure (prior visit considered cured). A clinical response of cure was only relevant at EFU for subjects with a 
Assessment report  
  
  
response of improved at EOT. The definition of cure included that all pretherapy signs and symptoms had 
resolved and that no additional antibiotic therapy was required and for cIAI that no unplanned surgical 
procedures or drainage procedures have been performed. 
Subjects with cUTI were evaluated for microbiological response and categorised as favourable or 
unfavourable. A favourable overall microbiological response at the EFU visit requires “sustained eradication” 
(defined as a urine culture taken at the EFU visit still shows eradication of the uropathogen (i.e., ≥105 
CFU/mL is reduced to <104 CFU/mL) found at study entry of all baseline pathogens). 
Results 
Participant flow 
Fifty-four subjects were screened, and 50 subjects were enrolled in PN013 (47 in the randomized treatment 
groups [Treatment Groups 1 and 2] and 3 in the open-label treatment group [Treatment Group 3]). A higher 
percentage of subjects in Treatment Group 1 compared with Treatment Group 2 completed trial treatment 
(87.1% versus 68.8%) and completed the entire trial (87.1% versus 68.8%). This was due primarily to a 
lower percentage of subjects in Treatment Group 1 compared with Treatment Group 2 who discontinued trial 
treatment due to an AE (0/31 versus 3/16 [18.8%]) and who discontinued the trial due to death (1/31 
[3.2%] versus 3/16 [18.8%]). 
In Treatment Groups 1 and 2, 23 (48.9%) subjects were enrolled with cUTI, 8 (17.0%) subjects were 
enrolled with cIAI, and 16 (34.0%) subjects were enrolled with HAP/VAP. Fewer subjects with cIAI were 
enrolled than the 18 that were planned for each infection site. This was because fewer bacterial isolates that 
were evaluated during pre-screening were from cIAI sources than from cUTI and HAP/VAP sources. 
In Treatment Group 3, no subjects were enrolled with cUTI, 2 subjects were enrolled with cIAI, and 1 subject 
was enrolled with HAP/VAP.

Figure E1. 
Study analysis populations 
Among the 16 subjects in Treatment Groups 1 and 2 who were excluded from the mMITT population, 13 
subjects were excluded because the pathogens isolated from their infection-site culture did not meet 
protocol-specified susceptibility criteria based on central laboratory interpretation. For the remaining 3 
subjects, the qualifying culture was collected more than 1 week prior to entry. Most common additional 
reasons for exclusion from the PP population were concomitant antibacterials violation (5 subjects) and 
protocol-specified infection diagnosis criteria not met (3 subjects). 
Compliance and exposure to study drug 
Treatment compliance was high in both treatment groups. Moreover, the mean (11.4 and 10.8 days), median 
(12.5 and 9.8 days) and range (2 to 18 and 2 to 20 days) for duration of exposure to study treatment was 
similar in treatment group 1 and 2. 
Prior and concomitant exposure to other antibiotics 
Most subjects in the mMITT population reported prior anti-infective use (83.9% of all subjects) and 
concomitant (i.e., during IV therapy through end of trial) anti-infective use (71.0% of all subjects). The most

Overall, the mean APACHE II score was 11.5. The mean APACHE II scores were higher for subjects with 
HAP/VAP (15.9) and cIAI (16.3), than in subjects with cUTI (7.3). 
Of the 16 subjects with cUTI in the mMITT population, 8 had acute pyelonephritis with a normal urinary tract 
and 8 had cUTI due to underlying urinary tract abnormalities. The diagnoses for the 4 subjects with cIAI in 
the mMITT population were perforated hollow viscus (n=2), peritonitis (n=1), and intra-abdominal abscess 
(n=2). In the mMITT population, of the 11 subjects in the HAP/VAP infection-site stratum, 2 subjects had a 
primary diagnosis of HAP, and 9 subjects had a primary diagnosis of VAP. The most common radiologic 
findings in the mMITT population were pleural effusion (comparable between the 2 treatment groups) and 
pulmonary consolidation (more common in Treatment Group 1). 
Baseline microbiology 
All qualifying pathogens were aerobic gram-negative bacilli, and most were P. aeruginosa. The remainder 
were Enterobacteriaceae; of these, K. pneumoniae was the most common. 
Table E4. 
Qualifying baseline pathogens (mMITT population) 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
Among the 24 P. aeruginosa isolates, all carried the chromosomally encoded Ambler class C cephalosporinase 
AmpC of which there were 17 alleles detected. Eight isolates also carried class A ESBLs. Among the 8 
Enterobacteriaceae, KPCs (both KPC-2 and KPC-3) were carried by 5 pathogens. Class A ESBLs were carried 
by seven isolates. Plasmid-borne AmpCs (2 isolates) and OXA-48 (1 isolate) were also identified. Of the two 
K. pneumoniae isolates without detection of KPCs, one carried ESBLs only (SHV-1, CTX-M-15) and the other 
carried SHV-1, TEM-New Variant, CTX-M-15 and OXA-48. Both had borderline MICs of IMI and IMI/REL (2 
and 1 mg/L, respectively) corresponding to IMI-resistance and IMI/REL-susceptibility, respectively (CLSI 
susceptibility testing interpretive criteria).

The majority (≥70%) of subjects in both treatment groups in the mMITT population achieved a favourable 
overall response and was comparable in both treatment groups. The analysis results of the key secondary 
endpoints supported the primary efficacy results (table below). 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
Table E5. 
Primary and key secondary endpoints (mMITT population) 
Results for the PP population for the primary endpoint were comparable to those observed for the mMITT 
population with a favourable response in 13/15 (86.7%) and 4/5 (80.0%) for treatment groups 1 and 2, 
respectively. 
Alternate definition of favourable overall response in the mMITT population 
When the microbiological response (for cUTI) and clinical response (for cIAI and HAP/VAP) at early follow-up 
was evaluated which is consistent with CHMP guidance for evaluation of these conditions, a lower percentage 
of subjects achieved a favourable overall response in both treatment groups (66.7% in Treatment Group 1 
and 50.0% in Treatment Group 2) than when using the primary endpoint definition. This was due to 3 
subjects with HAP/VAP (1 in Treatment Group 1, 2 in Treatment Group 2) who had unfavourable responses 
using the alternate definition (clinical response at the EFU Visit) but had favourable response using the 
primary endpoint definition (survival at Day 28).

Ancillary analyses 
Key secondary analyses 
Favourable clinical response at day 28 was 71.4 and 40.0% for groups 1 and 2, respectively. The larger 
between-group difference observed for favourable clinical response at Day 28 (table E5 above) than for 
favourable overall response was driven mainly by 3 subjects in Treatment Group 2 of which 2 subjects with 
HAP/VAP who survived on Day 28 and therefore met criteria for favourable overall response did not meet 
criteria for favourable clinical response at Day 28 and 1 subject with cUTI who had favourable microbiological 
and clinical response at the EFU Visit and therefore met criteria for favourable overall response but did not 
meet criteria for a favourable clinical response at Day 28. 
The all-cause mortality through day 28 in each treatment arm were 2 and 3 subjects for groups 1 and 2, 
respectively. 
Subgroup analyses 
Favourable overall response results in all subgroups were generally comparable to the results for the mMITT 
population as a whole. 
Outcome by baseline pathogen 
Three subjects in each treatment group with unfavourable response for the primary efficacy endpoint had P. 
aeruginosa as qualifying baseline pathogen and the additional two subjects in treatment group 1 with 
unfavourable response had an infection caused by K. pneumoniae. 
Emergence of nonsusceptibility to trial treatment 
According to CLSI and EUCAST susceptibility testing interpretive criteria, no subjects in either treatment 
group developed emergent resistance to trial treatments during IV treatment. 
Efficacy of IMI/REL in Treatment Group 3 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
At EOT and Day 28, 2 of 3 subjects in Treatment Group 3 achieved a favourable clinical response. Both 
subjects were in the cIAI infection-site stratum and received Sponsor-approved extension of trial treatment 
for 41 and 42 days (EOT Visits Days 42 and 43, respectively). Therefore, the Day 28 clinical response 
assessment occurred while subjects were still on IV trial treatment. By the EFU Visit, neither of these 
subjects had a favourable clinical response. One subject had an indeterminate response; the other subject 
had clinical improvement but incomplete resolution. 
The 1 subject in Treatment Group 3 who did not achieve a favourable clinical response at any time point was 
in the HABP/VABP infection-site stratum and died on Trial Day 8.

Bacterial Infection 
 Study identifier 
Protocol number: P013MK7655A; EudraCT: 2015-000066-62 
Design 
This was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group, 
multicenter trial of IMI/REL compared with colistin + IMI in adult subjects with 
IMI non-susceptible bacterial infections, including HAP/VAP, cIAI, and cUTI. 
Subjects with IMI non-susceptible bacterial infection (with colistin and IMI/REL 
susceptibility) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to IMI/REL + placebo for CMS or 
CMS + IMI. Randomization was stratified by infection type. In addition to the 
randomized subjects, eligible subjects could also be enrolled into a third non-
randomized, unblinded/open-label treatment group to receive IMI/REL. 
Duration of main phase:  
Treatment phase 5 to 21 days included the OTX 
(on therapy) visit (day 3). Other main phase 
visits included the EOT (end of treatment) visit, 
the EFU (early follow up; 5 to 9 days post EOT) 
visit and the day 28 post-randomisation visit. 
AEs were monitored for 14 days following EOT.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Supportive studies 
Two different dose levels of REL (125 mg and 250 mg) administered q6h were combined with IMI 500 mg 
q6h and compared with IMI 500 mg q6h alone for the treatment of hospitalised adult subjects with cUTI 
(PN003) and cIAI (PN004). The design of these studies is briefly described in the table E1 above. Since these 
studies were not enriched for IMI non-susceptible pathogens for which REL would restore the effect IMI, the 
different treatment arms actually compared IMI with itself at an already approved dose regimen. Therefore, 
although important for the assessment of safety and pharmacokinetics of REL, the studies were not expected 
to make a significant contribution for the assessment of the combined effect of IMI and REL. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of IMI/REL in the treatment of adults with bacterial infections due to aerobic Gram-negative 
microorganisms with limited treatment options has been evaluated in one phase 3 study (PN013) comparing 
IMI/REL with colistin + IMI for the treatment of cUTI, cIAI and HAP/VAP caused by pathogens with acquired 
resistance to IMI. This study was of limited size and was designed to comply with what is described in the 
Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
infections (EMA/CHMP/351889/2013) with regards circumstances in which limited clinical data may be 
accepted for antibacterial agents with an ability to address an unmet clinical need. 
The Applicant has provided a reasonable justification that IMI/REL may have an ability to fulfil an unmet 
need: Firstly, the increasing problem with CR in Gram-negative pathogens; secondly, few alternatives for the 
treatment of these pathogens are available; and thirdly, the ability of REL to restore the activity of IMI mainly 
against AmpC producing P. aeruginosa and KPC producing Enterobacteriaceae. The final acceptance of the 
limited clinical programme relies on a robust demonstration of the adequacy of the dose of IMI and REL in the 
FDC. In that respect the PK/PD analyses are considered pivotal and clinical data only supportive because of 
the limited size of the clinical programme. 
The dose to be selected for phase 3 and proof-of-concept of the FDC was also evaluated in two phase 2 
studies comparing IMI + two different doses of REL with IMI alone for the treatment of cUTI and cIAI (PN003 
and PN004). It should be noted that there were no requirements in the phase 2 studies that the infections 
should be caused by IMI-resistant pathogens. Therefore, these studies were not capable to demonstrate the 
efficacy of REL in addition to IMI alone. 
Study PN013 
Study PN013 included hospitalised adult subjects with HAP/VAP, cIAI or cUTI. These infection types are the 
most likely to be caused by pathogens of interest for the evaluation of IMI/REL. In treatment groups 1 and 2 
there had to be culture evidence from the primary site of infection of IMI-resistant + IMI/REL- and colistin-
susceptible Gram-negative bacteria. In the open-label treatment arm to receive IMI/REL (treatment group 3) 
colistin-resistance was required. The study excluded patients with highest APACHE II scores (>30) and 
subjects with a creatinine clearance <15 mL/min. Although some CHMP recommendations made in the 2015 
scientific advice seem to not have been taken into account in the study protocol, the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were acceptable and seemed to not have been confounded by these deficiencies when the subject’s 
disease characteristics were assessed. 
The dose of IMI in the FDC (500 mg q6h) is within the range of recommended doses for the treatment of 
cIAI, severe pneumonia including HAP/VAP, intra-and post-partum infections, cUTI and cSSTI agreed during 
the referral under Article 30 of Directive 2001/83/EC in order to harmonise the national summary of product 
characteristics of Tienam and associated names (Procedure No. EMEA/H/A-30/1187). However, it should be 
noted that according the agreed product information for Tienam and associated names, it is recommended 
that infections suspected or proven to be due to less susceptible bacterial species (such as Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa) and very severe infections should be treated with imipenem 1000 mg q6h. 
The choice of a single comparative regimen instead of a best-available-therapy regimen chosen by each 
investigator has certainly advantages for the assessment. It is furthermore agreed that many investigators 
would not prefer to use colistin alone. To combine colistin with a carbapenem, although carbapenem-
resistance is detected, is reasonable and there are data that combining with a carbapenem may provide 
survival benefit. The dose of colistin is acceptable and according the recommendation concluded in the Article 
31 referral EMEA/H/A-31/1383 concluded in 2014. The dose adjustment of IMI in patients with impairment of 
renal function is in line with the product information and for colistin broadly in line with the label and thus 
acceptable. 
Duration of treatment up to 21 days was questioned in the scientific advice given, since it would be usual to 
regard any patient who needs more than 10-14 days to be a failure. This is further discussed below. 
Assessment report  
  
  
The study primarily compared favourable overall response which in principal is acceptable when more than 
one infection type is included in a study. However, the primary endpoint for each infection type was not fully 
in line with CHMP expectations. The applicant has added an additional endpoint with an alternate definition of 
favourable overall response more in line with what is described in EMA/CHMP/351889/2013. However, the 
assessment of microbiological eradication (<104 CFU/mL) differed from what is recommended in the CHMP 
guideline (<103 CFU/mL). 
The sample size was driven by feasibility and not by statistical considerations. The size of the study was 
discussed and agreed during the scientific advice received. 
Study subjects were randomised to receive IMI/REL or comparator regimen and the randomisation was 
stratified according to infection types. 
Study treatments were dispensed and administered in a double-blinded fashion for subjects in treatment 
groups 1 and 2. The methodologies for these procedures were deemed acceptable. 
The microbiological modified intention to treat population defined as all randomised subjects who received at 
least one dose of IV study therapy and who had a baseline bacterial pathogen in line with inclusion criteria 3 
was the primary population used for efficacy analysis. The per-protocol population served as the secondary 
population. The primary population as defined was reasonable. This was to focus the evaluation on subjects 
infected with pathogens within the spectrum of REL´s inhibitory capacity. 
Between-group 90% CIs for the primary and key secondary endpoints were calculated using the stratified 
Miettinen and Nurminen method. 
Fifty-four subjects were screened, and 50 subjects were enrolled (31, 16 and 3 subjects in the respective 
treatment group). A higher percentage of subjects in Treatment Group 1 compared with Treatment Group 2 
completed trial treatment and completed the study. This was primarily due to a lower percentage of subjects 
in Treatment Group 1 who discontinued trial treatment due to an AE and who discontinued the trial due to 
death. 
Among the 16 subjects who were excluded from the mMITT population, 13 subjects were excluded because 
the pathogens isolated from their infection-site culture did not meet protocol-specified susceptibility criteria. 
For the remaining 3 subjects, the qualifying culture was collected more than 1 week prior to entry. Most 
common additional reasons for exclusion from the PP population were concomitant antibacterial violation (5 
subjects) and protocol-specified infection diagnosis criteria not met (3 subjects). 
Treatment compliance was high in both treatment groups. The mean duration of exposure to study treatment 
was similar in treatment group 1 and 2. 
Two subjects in each treatment group had treatment duration of 15 days or more. As discussed above and in 
the CHMP scientific advice given subjects with duration of therapy of more than 14 days should reasonably be 
considered failures. 
Demographics and baseline subject characteristics were generally comparable for treatment groups 1 and 2, 
with the exception of age. The mean age in treatment group 1 was lower (54 vs. 63 in treatment group 2). 
The typical patient was a white, European male aged 41 to 64 years. 
Approximately 50% of the subjects had cUTI of which half had pyelonephritis, one third had HAP/VAP of 
which all but two subjects had VAP. Only 13% had cIAI. The infections were generally monomicrobial and 
only two patients had bacteraemia. Most pathogens isolated were P. aeruginosa followed by K. pneumoniae. 
All qualifying baseline isolates in both treatment groups were non-susceptible (resistant or intermediate) to 
Assessment report  
  
  
IMI by CLSI interpretive criteria, as expected based on the trial entry criteria (using site interpretive criteria). 
In comparison, 23.8% of isolates in Treatment Group 1 and 40.0% of isolates in Treatment Group 2 were 
susceptible to IMI by EUCAST interpretive criteria. This is not unexpected because of different cut-offs for 
CLSI and EUCAST interpretive criteria. Notably, in treatment group 3 none of the pathogens met criteria 
eligibility, as all isolates tested susceptible to IMI and/or colistin at the central laboratory. 
As expected, the most common resistance mechanism detected in P. aeruginosa was the chromosomally 
encoded Ambler class C cephalosporinase AmpC and KPC and class A ESBLs for Enterobacteriaceae. 
The percentages of subjects excluded from the mMITT and PP populations were essentially similar between 
treatment groups 1 and 2. For reasons for exclusion from the respective analysis population, see above. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Favourable overall response was similar between treatment groups 1 and 2 (71.4% and 70.0%, 
respectively). With the alternate definition of favourable overall response used for the primary efficacy 
endpoint (to meet CHMP guidance), the corresponding favourable overall response rates were 66.7 and 
50.0% for treatment groups 1 and 2, respectively. The difference of the results between the definitions was 
due to 3 subjects with HAP/VAP (1 in Treatment Group 1, 2 in Treatment Group 2) who had unfavourable 
responses using the alternate definition (clinical response at the EFU Visit) but had favourable response using 
the primary endpoint definition (survival at Day 28). The results from a study of this limited size must be 
interpreted with caution. The uncertainties in the results are reflected by the large within and between group 
CIs. 
As discussed above and in the CHMP scientific advice given, subjects with duration of therapy of more than 
14 days should reasonably be considered as failures. Four subjects (two in each treatment group) were 
treated for more than 14 days. The two subjects treated with IMI/REL had a favourable outcome whereas the 
two subjects treated with colistin + IMI failed treatment. However, also when counting the two subjects 
treated with IMI/REL for more than 14 days as failures instead of successes do not significantly change the 
overall conclusions. 
CHMP noted that the assessment of microbiological eradication (<104 CFU/mL in the study) differs from what 
is recommended in the CHMP guideline (<103 CFU/mL). Two additional subjects treated with IMI/REL had an 
unfavourable outcome using the EU criterion for microbiological eradication. However, CHMP agreed that this 
does not significantly change the overall conclusions. 
Also, with regards the secondary endpoints favourable clinical response at day 28, all-cause mortality 
through day 28 and clinical response over time, the point-estimates for IMI/REL were essentially similar to 
the point-estimates for CMS + IMI. 
The low number of subjects in each infection-site stratum makes any comparisons difficult. Nonetheless, the 
response by infection-site stratum was generally similar between the treatment groups. None of the four 
subjects with cIAI had a favourable clinical response at day 28. 
The outcome in subgroups were generally comparable to the results for the mMITT population as a whole, 
although the small sample size of each subgroup and resulting variability is noted. 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
There were no evident differences of outcome by baseline pathogen. A similar number of subjects in both 
treatment arms with an unfavourable response had P. aeruginosa as qualifying pathogen and two additional 
subjects in treatment group 1 with an unfavourable response had K. pneumoniae as qualifying pathogen. No 
subject developed treatment emergent resistance. Susceptibility testing will be performed after authorisation 
and the development of resistance monitoring results will be reported with the PSURs. 
In treatment group 3, at day 28, 2 subjects with cIAI achieved a favourable clinical response. However, these 
subjects were still on IV treatment at the day 28 assessment and treated for over 40 days. By the EFU Visit, 
neither of these subjects had a favourable clinical response. The 1 subject with HAP/VAP died on study day 8. 
Thus, all three subjects could be considered as failures. 
PN003 and PN004 
Overall, the phase 2 studies in cUTI and cIAI did not inform on REL efficacy. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The limited sized PN013 study is considered supportive of efficacy of IMI/REL for the treatment of infections 
due to aerobic gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. However, as this 
application relies on a limited clinical programme that does not independently demonstrate the efficacy of 
imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, the clinical pharmacology programme, including non-clinical PK/PD analyses 
and PTA simulations using clinical PK data, is pivotal to the application and has been considered by CHMP 
during the assessment. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
IMI/REL is a fixed dose combination product containing imipenem, cilastatin and relebactam. Imipenem, 
approved for administration together with cilastatin, is considered to have a recognized safety profile.  
The active substance relebactam (REL) is not previously approved. 
The overall safety database for IMI/REL is based on 7 Phase I trials, 2 Phase II trials and 1 pivotal Phase III 
trial. A total of 658 subjects have received treatment with imipenem+relebactam (different doses) and 52 
subjects have been exposed to relebactam only (different doses).  
Most of the study population included in the Phase I trials were healthy adults, but one study included 
subjects with impaired renal function. In those 7 trials relebactam was dosed alone (25 mg, 50 mg, 125 mg, 
250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg and 1150 mg) or administered as a co-infusion with IMI 500 mg + REL (50 mg, 
125 mg, 250 mg, 375 mg, 500 mg and 625 mg), or as the FDC of IMI 500 mg/REL 250 mg. In the Phase II 
trials cUTI and cIAI subjects were treated either with imipenem 500mg+ relebactam 250mg, imipenem 
500mg+ relebactam 125mg or imipenem+placebo. In the Phase III trial subjects with imipenem non-
susceptible bacterial infections, specifically cUTI, cIAI, and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia 
(HAP)/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VAP) were treated either with the FDC IMI/REL (imipenem 
500 mg/relebactam 250 mg) or imipenem+colistin. 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
The applicant has not provided any overall summary of safety data, except for the pooled data of the trials 
included in each phase, most of the safety data in this overview is therefore presented by each phase 
separately.   
One additional Phase III trial (P014) in HAP/VAP subjects is still ongoing and in March 2019 514 subjects has 
been recruited, of which 159 of them experienced SAEs and 104 of them died. 
Patient exposure 
The safety of IMI/REL has been evaluated in 658 subjects that have been exposed to different doses of 
imipenem+relebactam. In addition to this, 52 subjects have been exposed to different doses of relebactam 
alone. Of the IMI/REL treated subjects, 299 subjects (Phase I: 59, Phase II: 209, Phase III: 31) were treated 
intravenously for ≥4 days with the intended clinical dose of 500 mg imipenem + 250 mg relebactam.  
Table 7. Summary of Subjects by Treatment Regimen in the IMI/REL Clinical Program 
Most of the subjects included in all trials where white at the age of 18-65 years. It was noted that the Phase I 
trials male subject were predominating (76.2%) as expected whereas in the Phase II trial the distribution was 
more similar between male (54.3%) and female (45.7%). In the Phase II trials, the majority (86.2%) was 
related to Europe as geographic region.

Drug related Adverse Events 
The most common reported drug related AEs reported in subjects treated with imipenem + 250 mg 
relebactam was diarrhoea (3.7%), nausea (1.4%), increased ALT (1.4%), and increased AST (1.4%) . 
Table 9. Subjects Reported with Drug-Related Adverse Events during Study Therapy and 14-Day 
Follow-Up Period (PN003 and PN004) 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
 
The frequency of subjects who experienced one or more local infusion site reaction was slightly higher among 
the IMI+REL 250 mg (20.8%) compared to IMI+placebo (15.0%), of which erythema, pain, tenderness, 
warmth and swelling was most commonly reported. Infusion site erythema, phlebitis and infusion site pain 
has been proposed by the applicant to be included in section 4.8 at the frequency of common and 
uncommon.  
The frequency of drug related increased levels of liver transaminases was similar between subjects treated 
with imipenem+REL and imipenem+placebo. Four subjects (2 who were treated with IMP+REL 250 mg and 2 
who were treated with IMP+placebo) had elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine transaminase 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
 
(ALT) value ≥5 X upper limit of normal ULN which was considered by the investigator to be drug related. A 
warning in the Recarbrio SmPC section 4.4, in line with the outcome of the Article 30 referral for Tienam, has 
been included.  
Phase III trial 
This phase III trial included a limited number of vulnerable subjects often suffering from multiple diseases 
and the results should therefore be interpreted with caution. The most commonly reported AEs among the 31 
IMI/REL treated subjects were pyrexia (12.9%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (9.7%) and 
dyspnoea (9.7%).  Among the drug related adverse events was the following reported among the IMI/REL 
treated subjects: decreased creatinine renal clearance (6.5%) and infusion site erythema, pyrexia, & 
hyperglycemia (each 3.2%). Due to the limited study population it is however difficult to allow establishing of 
frequencies based on the observed AEs. 
One of the subjects (with a history including pyelonephritis) treated with IMI/REL experienced a 
nephrotoxicity related adverse event which was handled by a dose adjustment of study drug in line with the 
SmPC recommendations.  
Adverse reactions as presented in the SmPC 
In the Recarbrio SmPC section 4.8, the applicant has presented a table including adverse events based on the 
results of the two phase II trials and based on adverse reactions previously known for imipenem/cilastatin. 
The phase III trial included a small number of subjects who received IMI/REL, of which a majority were 
suffering from comorbid conditions (N=34), and the data were therefore not included in section 4.8 in the 
SmPC since the frequency can be misleading.  The Applicant was requested however to also include in the 
SmPC all AEs known for the well characterized safety profile of imipenem/cilastatin. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
No serious adverse event or deaths was reported from the 7 studies included in the Phase I trials.  
Deaths 
Five deaths were reported in the Phase II trials (2 subjects treated with IMI+REL 250 mg and 3 subjects 
treated with IMI+REL 125 mg) none of them were considered related to treatment with IMI/REL which can be 
agreed since other diseases presented were more likely to cause the outcome of death. Among the IMI/REL 
treated subjects in the Phase III study three death were reported. These events occurred in subjects with 
several co-existing diseases and none of the deaths was considered related to study drug by the investigator, 
which can be agreed. 
Serious Adverse Events 
It can be concluded that few SAEs were reported in the Phase II (IMI+REL250 mg 3.2%) and Phase III 
(IMI/REL 9.7%) trials. The SOC where most IMP+REL250 mg (phase II) treated subjects were reported with 
SAEs was gastrointestinal disorders (1.4%) of which one subject experienced SAE of diarrhoea that was 
considered related to study drug. 
The only drug related SAE in the Phase III trial open label was one generalised tonic-clonic seizure that was 
considered drug related by the investigator. No firm conclusions can be drawn based on one case reported 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
from a vulnerable and multi-diseased group of subjects. Seizures have been described as an uncommon 
adverse event related to treatment with imipenem/cilastatin.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Overall, few abnormalities in haematology were reported. 
Three events of abnormal lymphocyte morphology were reported from the Phase I trials.  
During the IV treatment period of IMI+REL 250 mg and the 14 day follow up period in the Phase II trials was 
events of anaemia (2/216), iron deficiency anaemia (1/216), leucocytosis (1/216), and thrombocytosis 
(5/216) reported. 
During the IV treatment period of IMI/REL and the 14 day follow up period in the Phase III trial was events of 
anaemia (2/31) and leucocytosis (1/31) reported. 
Liver Function Tests 
In the Phase I trials, increased levels of ALT (3.9%) and increased AST (5%) was reported in healthy 
subjects treated with IMI+REL (dose information was not included). In addition, several subjects in study 
PN001 and PN012 had increased levels of liver transaminases (<3X ULN) that for unknown reasons were not 
reported as adverse events. The elevations were not reported to be dose dependent (relebactam) and did not 
result in clinical signs. 
No clinically relevant elevation in bilirubin was reported in any of the phase I trials and none of the subjects 
included met the criteria for suspected drug-induced liver injury. 
Assessment report  
  
  
Table 10. Subjects in the Phase II trials with Reported Changes in Liver Function Tests  
In the Phase III trial increased ALT (2/31 [6.5%]) and increased AST (3/31 [9.7%]) was reported in few 
subjects.  
A recommendation of closely monitoring of hepatic function during treatment was included in section 4.4, in 
line with the Article 30 referral for Tienam.  
Renal Function 
In the Phase I trials, the overall incidence of AEs within the SOC of renal and urinary disorders was low 
(haematuria in one subject treated with IMI+REL), as was the overall incidence of relevant AEs within the 
SOC of investigations (increased levels of creatinine in one subject treated with IMI+REL).  
In the Phase II trials, one (1/216) of the subjects treated with IMI+REL 250 mg, one of the (1/215) subjects 
treated with IMI+REL 125 mg and three of the subjects (3/214) in the IMI+Placebo were reported with 
increased levels of creatinine in blood. Among the subjects treated with IMI+REL 125 mg decrease in 
creatinine based renal clearance was reported in one subject (1/215), acute kidney injury was reported in 
another (1/215); both adverse events led to treatment discontinuation. 
In the phase III trial PN013 the percentage of patients with treatment emergent nephrotoxicity who received 
Recarbrio was 10.3% (3/29) and in patients who received colistin plus IMI 56.3% (9/16). 
Urinalysis Parameters 
Within all trials, few subjects were reported with abnormal urinalysis parameters. 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
Vital Signs 
Few abnormalities were reported within this section. One IMI+REL treated subject in the Phase I trials and 
one IMI+REL treated subject in the Phase II trial experienced one event of increased blood pressure. 
Safety in special populations 
Data from Phase II safety population support the safety imipenem/relebactam irrespectively of age, gender 
and race ethnicity since the safety profiles were roughly similar.  
Renal function status 
Relebactam and imipenem are both primarily renally excreted. One single dose of IMP/REL appeared to be 
well tolerated in the limited number of subjects with renal impairment treated in study PN005, however, it is 
difficult to draw any firm conclusion based on one single dose administered to few subjects.  In the Phase II 
trials, 66, 29, and 1 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe impaired renal function, respectively, were 
treated with imipenem+250 mg relebactam; and 75, 27, and 1 subjects with mild, moderate, and severe 
impaired renal function, respectively, were treated with imipenem+125 mg relebactam. Both doses seemed 
to be well tolerated.  
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Women who were pregnant and/or lactating have been excluded from enrolment into any of the clinical trials 
for IMI/REL to date. No pregnancies have been reported in any of the completed clinical trials. There are no 
adequate and well-controlled studies of IMI/REL or its components in pregnant women.  
Geriatric patients 
Observed adverse events are presented by age groups are described in the tables below:

Assessment report  
  
  
 
Table 12. Adverse events by age groups, phase III trial (PN013) 
Immunological events 
Hypersensitivity reactions are known adverse events related to treatment with beta-lactams and the 
reactions observed in the phase II and III trials are described in the tables below. In the phase I trials, five 
subjects discontinued treatment due to rash-related AEs, considered drug-related by the investigator: 3 in 
the IMI+REL group (1 mild rash; 1 moderate rash; and 1 moderate toxic skin reaction); 1 in the IMI+PBO to 
REL group (moderate rash); and 1 in the placebo group (mild rash). In the phase II trials, the 
hypersensitivity reactions were mild, however, one subject treated with IMI/REL (250 mg) discontinued due 
to mild rash.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
See pharmacokinetic part of the assessment report. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The overall rate of discontinuation in the imipenem/relebactam treated subjects was low (Phase I, IMI+REL 
different doses: (8/179); Phase II: IMI+REL 250mg 250 (4/216), IMI+REL125 mg (6/215); Phase III 
IMI/REL: (1/34)). Therefore, discontinuation due to AEs is not considered a major concern. 
Post marketing experience 
The combination of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam is not marketed in any country. Relebactam is not 
marketed in any country either alone or in combination with any other drug. There is extensive post 
marketing experience with imipenem/cilastatin with over 30 years of global marketed use of Primaxin and 
Tienam. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
IMI/REL is a fixed dose combination product containing imipenem, cilastatin and relebactam. The intended 
clinical dose is 500 mg imipenem/500 mg cilastatin/250 mg relebactam administer every 6 hours. The safety 
profile of imipenem together with cilastatin is well known. The active substance relebactam is not previously 
approved. In preclinical studies, the kidney was identified as a target organ for toxicity of relebactam. In 
addition, irritation of the injection site was noted. In clinical studies in healthy volunteers a total of 52 
subjects were treated with relebactam at doses between 25-1150 mg alone as single or multiple doses. 
Commonly occurring adverse events for treatment with relebactam (alone) were headache (5/52) and 
infusion site erythema (3/52). No dose-dependent effects of relebactam on ALT/AST elevation were observed 
and no clinical signs could be related. Overall, relebactam was well tolerated in healthy adult subjects. 
The overall safety database for this application includes 7 Phase I trials, 2 Phase II trials and one Phase III 
trial. One additional Phase III trial in hospitalized HAP/VAP subjects is still ongoing and preliminary blinded 
safety information for the 514 subjects has been presented by the applicant.  
Assessment report  
  
  
 
The safety of IMI/REL has been evaluated in 658 subjects. Of these subjects, 299 were treated intravenously 
for ≥4 days with the intended clinical dose of 500 mg imipenem + 250 mg relebactam. Thus, a reasonable 
number of patients have been exposed even though the safety data base is small. 
The studied population treated with the intended clinical dose of IMI/REL consists mainly of patients with 
cUTI and cIAI (N=216 Phase II studies, N=23 Phase III study) whereas a small number of subjects (N= 11) 
with HAP/VAP were treated with IMI/REL in the Phase III study. The subjects with HAP/VAP were suffering 
from comorbid diseases and it is therefore not possible to draw any firm conclusions from the phase III 
study. 
Discontinuation rate due to adverse events was low in all treatment groups and not considered a major 
concern for this treatment. Primary reasons for not completing study treatment among IMI+REL250 mg 
treated subjects in the Phase II trials were adverse events such as diarrhoea, duodenal ulcer perforation, 
pyrexia, and rash (one subject each). 
Among the subjects included in the two Phase II trials treated with 500 mg imipenem+250 mg relebactam 
the most commonly reported adverse events were diarrhoea (5.6%; 12/216), nausea (5.6%; 12/216), 
vomiting (3.2%, 7/216), increased levels of AST (2.8%; 6/216), increased levels of ALT (3.2%; 7/216), 
headache (4.2%; 9/216), thrombocytosis (2.3%; 5/216) and pyrexia (2.3%; 5/216). In this population, the 
most commonly reported drug related adverse event was diarrhoea (3.7%; 8/216), nausea (1.4%; 3/216), 
increased ALT (1.4%; 3/216), increased AST (1.4%; 3/216). 
The most commonly reported adverse events in the IMI/REL treated subjects in the Phase III study were 
pyrexia (12.9%; 4/31), increased AST (9.7%; 3/31) and dyspnoea (9.7%; 3/31). In this population, the 
most commonly reported drug related adverse event was decreased creatinine renal clearance (6.5%; 2/31).  
The frequency of drug related increased levels of liver transaminases was similar between subjects treated 
with IMI+REL and IMI+placebo (Phase II studies). Four subjects (2 who were treated with IMI+REL 250 mg 
and 2 who were treated with IMI+placebo) had elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine 
transaminase (ALT) value ≥5 X upper limit of normal ULN which was considered by the investigator to be 
drug related. A recommendation of closely monitoring of hepatic function during treatment has been included 
in section 4.4 of the Recarbrio SmPC, in line with the conclusions of the Article 30 referral for Tienam.  
Injections site reactions was reported to occur in 20.8% (45/216) of subjects treated with the intended 
clinical dose of IMI+REL in the Phase II studies, compared to 15% (32/214) of the subjects treated with 
IMI+placebo. Erythema (29/216), pain (27/216) and tenderness (20/216) were most commonly reported 
among IMI+REL treated subjects. Rash has also been observed in subjects treated with IMI/REL. The table in 
section 4.8 of the Recarbrio SmPC was updated to be in line with the well characterized safety information for 
imipenem/cilastatin.  
The frequency of nephrotoxicity reported in the trials appeared to be low.  
The Phase III trial included a small number of subjects of which a majority were suffering from comorbid 
conditions (N=34 who received IMI/REL). This study is therefore considered to have limited value to base 
frequency of adverse events on and is not sufficient to allow firm conclusions of possible adverse events 
related to treatment with relebactam.  
Assessment report  
  
  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Although the safety database is relatively small, the emerging safety profile for imipenem/relebactam 
appears generally comparable to what is known for imipenem. No specific safety concerns for relebactam 
have been identified, and a safety profile that is similar to imipenem/cilastatin is expected. There are no 
outstanding safety concerns and the Application is approvable from the safety point of view.  
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
Safety concerns 
No safety concerns have been identified in the RMP of Recarbrio. 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
There are no studies required forRecarbrio. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Not applicable, no safety concerns have been identified in the RMP of Recarbrio. 
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 16 July 2019. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of relebactam with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
Assessment report  
  
  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers relebactam to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions  
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The QRD Group agreed to the use of minimum particulars for the 20 mL vial. The Group also proposed not to 
mention the excipients 3 times on the multilingual label and to delete the MAH logo.  
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-
shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Recarbrio (imipenem / cilastatin / relebactam) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was 
not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam is proposed by the Applicant to be indicated for the treatment of infections 
due to aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms in adults with limited treatment options. 
Multi drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms such as carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and 
Enterobacteriaceae are important pathogens in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) including 
Assessment report  
  
  
pyelonephritis, complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and hospital-acquired including ventilator-
associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Beta-lactam antibacterial agents are commonly used to manage infections when they involve Gram-negative 
pathogens. Increasing resistance to beta-lactams, including the carbapenems, has led to some organisms 
being effectively untreatable or treatable only by a few alternative agents. The European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimate that nearly 700,000 infections and 33,000 deaths in the EU and 
European Economic Area (EEA) in 2015 are a consequence of MDR bacterial infection (Cassini et al. 2019). 
The burden has increased since 2007. Carbapenem-resistance (CR) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae contributed significantly to the number of estimated deaths (approximately 4,000 and 
2,000 deaths, respectively) whereas the numbers of deaths estimated to be caused by infections caused by 
CR Escherichia coli was lower (~100). In 2013 to 2014, the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and 
oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) was the most widely disseminated carbapenemases across Europe (Grundmann et 
al. 2017). Metallo-beta-lactamases such as New-Delhi metallo-betalactamase (NDM) and Verona integron-
encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) were detected to a lesser extent. There remains an unmet medical need 
for additional antibacterial agents addressing carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative organisms. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main study (PN013) was a randomised, double blind study of IMI/REL (500/250 mg q6h) versus colistin 
+ IMI (500 mg q6h) in adult subjects with cUTI, cIAI and HAP/VAP caused by IMI-resistant gram-negative 
organisms. The study was intended only for a descriptive comparison of efficacy. 
The supportive studies PN003 and PN004 were randomised, double blind studies of IMI/REL (REL=125 or 250 
mg) versus IMI alone in adult subjects with cUTI and cIAI, respectively. In line with CHMP guidance and 
scientific advice there were no requirements in these studies that the infections should be caused by IMI-
resistant pathogens. Therefore, these studies were expected to have limited value for the efficacy-evaluation 
of REL in addition to IMI alone. However, the studies were expected to provide safety and PK data from 
patients of the new active substance REL. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In study PN013 the favourable overall response was 71.4% (15/21; 95% CI: 49.8, 86.4) in the IMI/REL 
group and 70.0% (7/10; 95% CI: 39.2, 89.7) in the colistin + IMI group. 
With an alternate definition of favourable overall response used for the primary efficacy endpoint to meet 
CHMP guidance, the corresponding favourable overall response rates were 66.7% (14/21) and 50.0% (5/10) 
for IMI/REL and colistin + IMI treatment groups, respectively. 
All-cause mortality through Day 28 was 9.5% (2/21) and 30.0% (3/10) for IMI/REL and colistin + IMI 
treatment groups, respectively. 
The main support for the dose of REL in the FDC comes from murine thigh model studies in which it has been 
demonstrated that a REL fAUC to the IMI/REL MIC ratio of 7 was sufficient to achieve 2-log10 kill in 
combination with humanised or half-humanised doses of IMI against four strains of P. aeruginosa. It was 
Assessment report  
  
  
moreover demonstrated in the same model that essentially similar AUCs of REL was needed to achieve 
similar antibacterial effects against two strains of K. pneumoniae as against the P. aeruginosa strains tested. 
Based on simulations of probability of target attainment (PTA) using joint PK/PD targets of 40% fT>MIC 
target for IMI (corresponding to 2-log10 CFU reduction) and 7.5 fAUC/MIC for REL (corresponding to 2-log10 
CFU reduction) it has been shown that the 500/250 mg q6h dose of IMI/REL is sufficient for the treatment of 
infections caused by pathogens up to an MIC of 2 mg/L for subjects in all renal function categories except 
those with creatinine clearance above 150 mL/min. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Since the sample size in study PN013 is very limited, it does not form a basis for concluding on the efficacy of 
IMI/REL for the intended indication. Moreover, the phase two studies in cUTI and cIAI cannot either support 
the adequacy of the REL dose to protect IMI from Class A and Class C beta-lactamases, although relevant PK 
data were generated. 
As this application relies on a limited clinical programme that does not independently demonstrate the 
efficacy of imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, the clinical pharmacology programme, including non-clinical 
PK/PD analyses and PTA simulations using clinical PK data, is pivotal to the application. The efficacy 
demonstration for IMI/REL de facto rests on animal models, and particularly the murine thigh model. 
While the efficacy demonstration rests on the translation of magnitudes (e.g., bacterial log kill) across 
experimental models, and where the clinical relevance of results (e.g., the selection of a PDT based on the 
ability to deliver a certain log kill) rests on the cross study comparison of effect sizes, there are no positive 
controls in the key experiments, whereby appropriate calibration is ascertained. 
In the usual case, PDT selection is based on the mutual support of the animal models (particularly the murine 
thigh model), and HFIM or chemostat experiments. The Applicant has not provided any additional 
experimental support for the 6.5% fT>MIC IMI target when combined with REL as requested by the CHMP.  
The Applicant has chosen a dose of IMI (500 mg q6h) in the FDC that alone would be adequate for the 
treatment of Enterobacteriaceae, but that is lower than what is recommended in EU SmPCs of imipenem-
cilastatin or that was taken into account by the EUCAST (1g q6h) for the treatment of infections caused by P. 
aeruginosa. The Applicant claims that when IMI is combined with REL the dose of IMI in IMI/REL will 
adequately cover for both Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa up to the current EUCAST susceptibility 
breakpoints for IMI against these pathogens (2 and 4 mg/L, respectively). This is justified by a lower PK/PD 
target of IMI when combined with REL to achieve a 2 log10 reduction of colony counts derived from an in vitro 
hollow-fibre infection model experiment (6.5% fT>MIC) compared with the target accepted by the CHMP in 
the Article 30 referral for Tienam to support the current dose recommendation of IMI (40% fT>MIC). With 
regards to implication on the reliability of the HFIM model, see above. 
The use of historical targets for the β-lactam alone have been considered acceptable in earlier applications for 
BL/BLI combinations. At CHMP request, the Applicant has updated the PTA simulations using IMI target 
values of 30% and 40%. The use of an IMI target of 40% %fT>MIC in the PTA simulations is considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. 
In updated PTA simulations using a joint 40% target for IMI (corresponding to 2-log10 CFU reduction) and 7.5 
fAUC/MIC for REL (corresponding to 2-log10 CFU reduction in both HFIM and murine thigh model studies) it 
has been shown that the 500/250 mg q6h dose of IMI/REL is satisfactory for the treatment of infections 
caused by pathogens up to an MIC of 2 mg/L for subjects in all renal function categories except those with

creatinine clearance above 150 mL/min. Based on surveillance data, the dose is considered adequate to treat 
the majority of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. In addition, a susceptibility breakpoint of 2 mg/L is 
recommended by the EUCAST for both Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.  
Taking into account what is recommended in the product information for EU authorised products containing 
IMI without the addition of REL and EUCAST recommended breakpoints for IMI alone, an IMI dose of 500 mg 
q6h (or 1 g q8h) is considered adequate with the exception of treatment of very severe infections and for the 
treatment of less susceptible bacterial species (such as P. aeruginosa). In these situations, 1000 mg IMI q6h 
is recommended. As an IMI/REL susceptibility breakpoint of 2 mg/L is recommended for P. aeruginosa rather 
than 4 mg/L (as recommended for IMI alone), for which 1000 mg q6h would be needed, the dose of IMI/REL 
is acceptable for the treatment of P. aeruginosa up to this lower breakpoint. However, the dose is not 
considered sufficient to reach the IMI target of 40% fT>MIC for subjects with ARC as shown by the PTA 
simulations above. Therefore, an IMI dose of 500 mg q6h in combination with REL is considered acceptable 
with inclusion in the Recarbrio SmPC of the message that the 500 mg q6h IMI dose may not be sufficient for 
patients with ARC. Moreover, similar wording as in the SmPC for products with IMI alone with regards dosing 
in neutropenic patients and those with very severe infections is included in the Recarbrio product information. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety of IMI/REL has been evaluated in 658 subjects. Of these, 303 subjects were treated intravenously 
for ≥4 days with the intended clinical dose of 500 mg imipenem + 250 mg relebactam. The studied 
population treated with the intended clinical dose of IMI/REL consists mainly of patients with cUTI and cIAI 
(N=216 Phase II studies, N=23 Phase III study) whereas a small number of subjects (N= 11) with HAP/VAP 
were treated with IMI/REL in the Phase III study.  
Commonly occurring adverse events for treatment with relebactam (alone) were headache (5/52) and 
infusion site erythema (3/52) which was observed in the Phase I trials.  
The most frequent unfavourable effects associated with the intended clinical dose of imipenem/relebactam in 
the Phase II trials were diarrhoea (5.6%; 12/216), nausea (5.6%; 12/216), vomiting (3.2%; 7/216), 
increased levels of AST (2.8%; 6/216), increased levels of ALT (3.2%; 7/216), headache (4.2%; 9/216), 
thrombocytosis (2.3%; 5/216) and pyrexia (2.3%; 5/216) of which the following were most commonly 
reported adverse event considered drug related: diarrhoea (3.7%; 8/216), nausea (1.4%; 3/216), increased 
ALT (1.4%; 3/216), increased AST (1.4%; 3/216).  
The most commonly reported adverse events in the IMI/REL treated subjects in the Phase III study were 
pyrexia (12.9%; 4/31), increased AST (9.7%; 3/31), dyspnoea (9.7%; 3/31) and decreased creatinine renal 
clearance (6.5%; 2/31) was the most commonly reported drug related adverse event.  
Injections site reactions was reported to occur in 20.8% (45/216) of subjects treated with the intended 
clinical dose of IMI+REL in the Phase II studies, compared to 15% (32/214) of the subjects treated with 
IMI+placebo. Erythema (29/216), pain (27/216) and tenderness (20/216) were the most commonly specific 
reactions related to injection site reported among IMI+REL treated subjects. 
Discontinuation rate due to adverse events was low in all treatment groups and not considered a major 
concern for this treatment. Primary reasons for not completing study treatment among IMI+REL 250 mg 
treated subjects in the Phase II trials were adverse events such as diarrhoea, duodenal ulcer perforation, 
pyrexia, and rash (one subject each).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite recent advances in the development of antibacterial agents there is still an unmet need of 
antibacterial agents with an acceptable safety profile that are active against carbapenem-resistant Gram-
negative organisms. The microbiology data indicate that REL can protect IMI from inactivation of Class A and 
C carbapenemases in Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa in the absence of other types of carbapenem 
resistance. Although IMI in the combination of REL cannot solve the problem of carbapenem resistance 
because of lack of activity against Class B and Class D carbapenemases, it could provide useful alternative for 
treatment of many infections due to carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. 
Although numerically similar favourable overall response rates were achieved for IMI/REL and colistin + IMI 
in study PN013, the sample size was too small to conclude on the effect of IMI/REL and to justify the doses of 
IMI and REL in the FDC. Because of the limited size of the clinical programme a sufficiently reliable PK/PD 
package to support the adequacy of the dose of IMI and REL in the FDC is pivotal. Although a higher dose of 
IMI would have been preferable in the FDC for the dose to be sufficient for the treatment of pathogens up to 
4 mg/L and for subjects with augmented renal clearance the doses of IMI and REL are considered sufficiently 
supported for the treatment of most infections caused by pathogens up to an MIC of 2 mg/L which will 
include the majority of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. 
Although the safety database is relatively small, CHMP agreed that the safety profile for IMI/REL appears 
overall acceptable and generally comparable to what is known for IMI alone. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Noting that the clinical data is too limited to draw conclusions on the favourable effects of IMI/REL on its own, 
CHMP agreed that the PK/PD package is supportive that the doses of IMI and REL are adequate for the 
treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. 
However, the dose is not considered sufficient to reach the IMI target of 40% fT>MIC for subjects with ARC, 
as shown by the PTA simulations. Therefore, an IMI dose of 500 mg q6h in combination with REL is 
considered acceptable, but the message that the 500 mg q6h IMI dose may not be sufficient for patients with 
ARC is included in the Recarbrio SmPC. Moreover, the Recarbrio product information mentions that the dose 
Assessment report  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of Recarbrio may not be optimal for the treatment of infections in neutropenic patients and those with very 
severe infections. 
Overall, the benefit/risk balance of Recarbrio is considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The benefit-risk balance of Recarbrio is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Recarbrio is not similar to Cayston and Tobi Podhaler within the 
meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Recarbrio is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options 
(see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that relebactam is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

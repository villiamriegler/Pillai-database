2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are among the most common infections in both hospitals and community 
settings, and remain a significant source of morbidity and mortality. These infections can range in severity from 
uncomplicated  skin  and  soft  tissue  infections,  such  as  simple  folliculitis,  to  complicated  skin  and  soft  tissue 
infections, including very serious conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis and Fournier's gangrene. Complicated 
skin  and  soft  tissue  infections  involve  deeper  soft  tissue  than  uncomplicated  infections,  and  may  require 
significant surgical intervention and parenteral antibiotic therapy. Within the hospital or long term care setting, 
cSSTIs  are  generally  a  consequence  of  surgery  or  regarded  as  a  secondary  infection  associated  with  an 
underlying disease. Within the community, they are most often associated with the consequences of trauma. 
Because of the great variation in seriousness and need of antibiotic treatment other interventions, diagnostic 
criteria and expected time to healing, it has been suggested that treatment of necrotizing fasciitis and burn 
wounds should be studied separately from other skin and soft tissue infections. Abscesses Aneeding immediate 
incision  and  drainage  may  also  be  unsuitable  for  testing  the  effect  of  antibiotic  treatment  as  the  surgical 
procedure may be sufficient alone. 
Systemic risk factors which predispose patients to severe forms of SSTI include diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, 
immune deficiencies, sensory neuropathies, chronic systemic illness, high age and smoking. 
Studies on the effect of antibiotics need to be well defined with documentation of both local and systemic signs 
of infection. Infections immediately treated with incision and drainage are less suitable for studies and one or 
more signs of systemic infections should be required (European guidelines for clinical evaluation of anti-infective 
drug product 1993, European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Stevens DL & al., 2005). 
Furthermore, it is important that the type of infection is well characterized. The validity of the results requires 
also that a significant number of each type of infection is included. 
Although skin and soft tissue infections include a vast array of clinical entities, they are most often caused by two 
single microorganisms, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.  
A number of antimicrobial agents are available for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections, and the 
benefit  of  systemic  antimicrobial  therapy,  accompanied  by  surgical  intervention  as  necessary  is  clearly 
established. According to the clinical presentation and other patient co-morbidities treatment strategies in skin 
and skin structure infections include both oral therapy and an IV-to-oral switch treatment regimen. In the latter 
case since therapy on an outpatient basis provides for greater patient convenience and reduced healthcare costs, 
the switch to oral therapy generally occurs as soon as clinically indicated. 
Another oxazolidinone which has both and IV and an oral formulation is increasingly utilized in the treatment of 
cSSTI,  particularly  if  MRSA  is  considered  a  likely  pathogen.  However,  its  use  is  associated  with 
myelosuppression, peripheral and optic neuropathies, and lactic acidosis, particularly with therapy longer than 
is typical for the treatment of cSSTI. These adverse effects have been linked mechanistically to mitochondrial 
protein synthesis (MPS) inhibition. 
During the last decades, S. aureus has become progressively resistant to methicillin and has spread worldwide, 
with an increasing prevalence of community-acquired (CA) MRSA observed in many intensive care units and 
emergency departments, particularly in the US but also in the EU. 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 12/110 
  
  
 
Furthermore,  resistance  to  currently  available  MRSA  drugs  is  increasing.  There  is  growing  concern  about 
linezolid-resistant  strains,  especially  due  to  the  cfr  gene  conferring  resistance  to  other  classes  of 
ribosome-targeting  antibiotics,  including  clindamycin,  streptogramins,  phenicols,  16-C  macrolides,  and 
pleuromutilins. 
New  antibacterial  medicinal  products,  especially  those  also  available  as  an  oral  formulation,  are  therefore 
needed to treat infections due to drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria in both hospital and community settings. 
Tedizolid phosphate (TR-701 FA, the free acid form of TR-701), is a novel oxazolidinone prodrug antibiotic that 
is  converted  in  vivo  by  phosphatases  to  the  microbiologically  active  moiety  TR-700.  TR-700  is  a  protein 
synthesis inhibitor that interacts with the bacterial 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) bacterial ribosome, 
thereby  preventing  the  initiation  of  translation  by  inhibiting  formation  of  the  initiation  complex.  Tedizolid 
phosphate is intended for both oral and intravenous (IV) administration in the treatment of acute bacterial skin 
and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). 
The pivotal studies supporting this application enrolled patients who complied with the definition of the term 
“acute  bacterial  skin  and  skin  structure  infections  (ABSSSI)”,  which  practically  encompasses  patients  with 
cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infections and major cutaneous abscesses with a lesion area size of at least 75 cm2 
(possibly lower for areas that involve certain body surface sites, such as the face). The CHMP was of the opinion 
that  the  use  of  this  term  was  more  appropriate  than  cSSTI,  as  it  better  described  the  patient  populations 
enrolled in the clinical trials. The applicant agreed with this conclusion. In this report, the two terms are however 
used interchangeably. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Two dosage forms are proposed for the drug product Sivextro: film-coated tablets and powder for concentrate 
for solution for infusion. 
The film-coated tablets contain 200 mg of tedizolid phosphate as active substance. The other ingredients are 
microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, povidone, crospovidone and magnesium stearate in the core and polyvinyl 
alcohol, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol, talc and yellow iron oxide (E172) in the film-coating. 
The tablets are available in aluminum foil and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/polyvinylidene chloride (PVdC) clear film 
perforated unit-dose blisters. 
The sterile lyophilized powder for concentrate for solution for infusion also contains 200 mg of tedizolid 
phosphate as active substance. The other ingredients are mannitol, sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid. 
The powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is available in Type I (10 ml) clear borosilicate tubing glass 
vials with a siliconised grey chlorobutyl rubber stopper. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of tedizolid phosphate is 
[(5R)-(3-{3-Fluoro-4-[6-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)pyridin-3-yl]phenyl}-2-oxooxazolidin-5-yl]methyl 
hydrogen phosphate and has the following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 13/110 
  
  
The chemical structure of tedizolid phosphate was inferred from the method of synthesis and confirmed using 
elemental analysis, phosphatase treatment, ultraviolet/visible (UV/VIS) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, mass 
spectrometry,  Fourier  transform  infrared  spectroscopy  (FT-IR),  and  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR) 
spectroscopy. 
The active substance is a white to yellow crystalline non-hygroscopic anhydrous solid with a molecular mass of 
450.32 Da, corresponding to the general molecular formula C17H16FN6O6P.  
The solubility of tedizolid phosphate drug substance is highest when fully deprotonated (high pH) and lowest 
when fully protonated (low pH), with a steep increase in solubility between pH 4.0 and pH 6.0. Tedizolid 
phosphate is very soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, soluble in tetrahydrofuran, methanol and acetone and sparingly 
soluble in ethanol.  
Tedizolid phosphate is a chiral compound. X-ray diffraction data has shown that the absolute configuration at the 
5-position of the oxazolidinone ring is of the (R)-configuration.  
Tedizolid phosphate drug substance is a crystalline solid. A polymorphism study confirmed that the polymorph 
resulting from the proposed manufacturing process is crystalline form A, which is the only stable identified 
polymorph. The other observed form, form B, is thermodynamically unstable and rapidly converts to Form A. 
Tedizolid phosphate is dephosphorylated in vivo by alkaline phosphatase enzymes to form the highly insoluble 
highly permeable active moiety tedizolid. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is synthesized in four main steps using commercially available well-defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications.  
Several iterations of the synthetic process and active substance form were used at various points during 
development. As mentioned above, tedizolid phosphate has 1 asymmetric centre. Its stereochemistry is 
controlled in the manufacturing process. It has been demonstrated that the stereocentre is not epimerisable and 
consequently is stable to all of the subsequent steps in the manufacturing process. Suitable analytical methods 
have been used over the course of development to control this stereocentre and results from this testing have 
indicated that there is no increase in the level of the (S)-enantiomer during manufacture, forced degradation 
studies, or on stability. 
To note, the final stage of the manufacturing process involves crystallisation of purified tedizolid phosphate and 
consists of a series of unit operations designed to minimize the potential for endotoxin contamination. This is 
critical for the quality of the tedizolid phosphate injectable formulation. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 14/110 
  
  
 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), identity (IR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), 
impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), heavy metals (ICP-MS), water content (KF), crystalline form (XPRD), 
particle size (laser diffraction), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits 
(Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological 
and clinical studies and appropriate specification limits have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Analysis data on twelve batches of the active substance manufactured by the commercial manufacturer have 
been provided. Supportive batch analysis data from 9 batches of tedizolid disodium phosphate have also been 
presented. 
The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on six pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 
6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, assay, organic impurities, chiral purity, water content, 
crystalline form, bacterial endotoxin and microbial limits. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release. Additionally, a test for chiral purity was performed during stability testing but is not included in the 
proposed commercial specification since the stereocentre in question was shown to be stable.  
The stability data presented indicate that there are no significant trends to any of the parameters tested for any 
of the batches when stored under long-term or accelerated conditions.  
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch, indicating that tedizolid 
phosphate is not photosensitive. 
Forced degradation studies of tedizolid phosphate drug substance were performed on one batch to identify 
probable degradation products and to confirm the suitability of analytical methods. Samples were stored under 
the conditions of hydrolysis (acid, base), oxidation (peroxide), heat, and light. The substance is stable towards 
light and heat in the solid state and against acid conditions in solution. Tedizolid phosphate degrades in water, 
alkaline solution and under oxidative stress. The study confirmed that the analytical methods proposed are 
stability indicating. 
Overall, the stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Two dosage forms are proposed for the drug product: film-coated tablets and powder for concentrate for 
solution for infusion.

Film-coated tablets 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Sivextro 200 mg film-coated tablets are yellow oval-shaped immediate-release, film-coated tablets, debossed 
with “TZD” on the obverse side and “200” on the reverse side, packed in PVC/PVdC clear film perforated 
unit-dose blisters. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as immediate release tablets (containing 200 mg of 
tedizolid phosphate) for oral administration, which can be swallowed easily and meet compendial and other 
relevant quality standards, in particular, rapid disintegration in the stomach and rapid dissolution in the small 
intestine, ease of handling and administration, and commercial acceptance. The critical quality attributes (CQAs) 
identified were appearance, identity, assay, degradation products, uniformity of dosage units, dissolution, water 
content and microbial limits. 
During development different forms of the active substance and different pharmaceutical forms were studied. 
Tedizolid phosphate free acid was found to be the most suitable form for the manufacture of a tablet dosage 
form based on its physicochemical properties. 
A phase 1 relative bioavailability study confirmed that the pharmacokinetics of the forms used during 
development were comparable and therefore formulation development progressed using only the free acid form 
of the drug substance. 
A wet granulation process was selected in order to increase density and minimise the potential impact of drug 
substance content variability that can occur in early development. A non-functional film coating was 
incorporated to improve aesthetics. 
The tedizolid phosphate film-coated tablet dosage form was designed to disintegrate in the stomach and provide 
rapid dissolution of the drug substance. Dissolution, which occurs readily at pH above 4, takes place within the 
small intestine, which is the primary site of drug absorption. Tedizolid phosphate prodrug has almost no oral 
absorption due to its high polarity.  Intestinal alkaline phosphatase enzymes dephosphorylate tedizolid 
phosphate to generate the highly permeable, pharmacologically active moiety, tedizolid. The oral absolute 
bioavailability of the tablet formulation was found to be >90%.  
The same tablet formulation evaluated in the absolute bioavailability study was used for all subsequent Phase 1 
and Phase 2 clinical studies, including all pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, and is proposed for commercial supply. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC. The excipients selected for the core tablet formulation are well known pharmaceutical 
ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards whilst the film-coating contains 
pharmacopoeial excipients and is analysed according to the applicant’s in-house specifications. 
Compatibility of the drug substance with the selected excipients was assessed by making binary mixtures with 
each excipient in a ratio based on the typical level of the excipient in a solid dosage form. These mixtures were 
stored in an open dish for up to 8 weeks at 40 ºC / 75% RH. Samples were tested at 0, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks 
for appearance, moisture, potency, and related substances. The selected excipients were found to be compatible 
with tedizolid phosphate. 
Dissolution method development was conducted in parallel with formulation and process development of the 
current 200 mg drug product. The development based on evaluation and consideration of drug physicochemical 
properties, tablet formulation, physical properties/performance characteristics, discriminating capability, and

biopharmaceutical relevance. Several dissolution media and volumes were tested. The discriminatory power of 
the dissolution method was demonstrated. 
The materials used in the proposed container closure system, aluminum foil and polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC)/polyvinylidene chloride (PVdC) clear film perforated unit-dose blisters, comply with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate 
for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of seven main steps: sieving/pre-blending, wet granulation, drying, 
screening/de-lumping, blending, compression, and film coating. The process is considered to be a standard 
manufacturing process.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated 
that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. A process-validation 
scheme in line with the CHMP guideline on process validation has been provided and was deemed acceptable. 
The applicant will validate the manufacturing process before commercialisation. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance 
(visual), identification (FTIR, HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.) and microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches manufactured by the development site and one 
pilot and three commercial scale batches manufactured by the commercial manufacturer confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on two commercial scale and one pilot scale batches of finished product stored for 24 months 
under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and intermediate conditions (30 °C / 75% RH), and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches of Sivextro are identical to those proposed for marketing and were stored in both the primary packaging 
formats proposed for marketing.  
Supportive stability data from two pilot scale batch from the manufacturer used during development stored 
under long-term storage conditions for 36 months and accelerated conditions for 6 months were also presented. 
Stability data from an open container study on one pilot scale batch stored at 25 °C / 60% RH for 6 months were 
also provided. 
Samples were tested for appearance, dissolution, assay, degradation products, water content, microbial limits, 
hardness and chiral purity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. All values remained within the 
specification. 
In addition, forced degradation studies and a confirmatory photostability study was performed in line with the 
ICH guideline on one commercial scale batch. No significant changes were observed on samples exposed to acid 
or oxidative conditions. Some degradation was detected under heat both in the solid state and in the presence 
of water, upon exposure to base, or under light exposure in the solid state. The light degradation treatments in 
this study are considered as worst case and not representative of intact film-coated tablets. These degradation 
products were not detected in the ICH confirmatory photostability studies. The results from the confirmatory 
Assessment report

photostability indicated that tedizolid phosphate film-coated tablets are not photosensitive and consequently do 
not require any special labelling or packaging to mitigate exposure to light. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Tedizolid phosphate powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, 200 mg, is supplied as a sterile, single dose 
lyophilised powder for reconstitution and administration by intravenous injection. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as a lyophilised powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion delivering 200 mg of tedizolid phosphate that meets compendial and other relevant quality standards, 
and is compatible with reconstitution fluids and diluents. The critical quality attributes (CQAs) identified were 
appearance,  identity,  assay,  degradation  products,  uniformity  of  dosage  units,  reconstitution  time,  pH, 
particulate matter, water content, sterility and bacterial endotoxins. 
The  active  substance,  tedizolid phosphate  free  base,  has  limited  aqueous  solubility.  Therefore,  a  lyophilised 
powder formulation was selected, in which tedizolid phosphate free base is converted into the more soluble 
salt. Compatibility of excipients with the active substance was confirmed in stability studies. 
The relative amounts of active substance and excipients were varied during development in order to minimise 
reconstitution time and formation of tedizolid salt whilst optimising cake appearance.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC. 
Thermal  terminal  sterilisation  of  both  the  reconstituted  solution  and  drug  product  was  investigated  by  both 
moist heat and dry heat processes. The results indicate that terminal sterilisation of tedizolid phosphate powder 
for  concentrate  for  solution  for  infusion  (drug  product  and  reconstituted  solution)  using  high-temperature 
processes negatively affects the quality of the drug product as relates to appearance, purity, and performance, 
and also produced several new unknown degradation products. Therefore, sterile filtration followed by aseptic 
filling and lyophilisation was pursued. 
The drug product formulation used in the clinical studies is the same as the proposed commercial formulation. 
The primary packaging for Sivextro powder for concentrate for solution is a Type I clear borosilicate tubing glass 
vial and siliconised grey chlorobutyl rubber stopper. An aluminum seal with a polypropylene flip-off top is applied 
to protect the closure.  The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of seven main steps:  compounding of the bulk solution and pH adjustment, 
sterile filtration and aseptic filling; lyophilisation, stoppering, and sealing. The process is considered to be a 
non-standard manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015

Batch  validation  data  from  3  consecutive  commercial  scale  batches  were  provided  demonstrating  that  the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
The in-process controls have been duly justified and are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form appearance, 
identification (IR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units by weight 
variation (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and sterility (Ph. Eur.). Additional 
tests are carried out on the reconstituted solution: reconstitution time (visual), constituted solutions (clarity and 
degree of opalescence of liquids, degree of coloration of liquids, particulate contamination: visible particles) (Ph. 
Eur.), pH and sub-visible particles of the reconstituted solution (Ph. Eur.),  
Batch analysis results are provided for four batches manufactured by the development site and five batches 
manufactured by the commercial manufacturer confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its 
ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data of five pilot scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
and intermediate conditions  (30 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 24 months and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of finished product 
were manufactured at the proposed commercial site and are representative of those proposed for marketing.  
Supportive stability data from 2 pilot scale batches manufactured by the site using during development stored 
for up to 36 months under long term conditions and 6 months at accelerated conditions were also provided. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  reconstitution  time,  constituted  solutions  pH,  particulate  matter 
(sub-visible  particles),  assay,  degradation  products,  loss  on  drying  and  chiral  purity,  sterility  and  bacterial 
endotoxins.  The  stability  data  indicate  that  there  were  no  significant  trends  or  variability  in  the  parameters 
tested. 
In  addition,  forced  degradation  studies  (under  heat,  light,  acid,  base,  and  oxidation  conditions)  and  a 
photostability study conducted in line with the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances 
and Products were conducted on one commercial scale batch. The forced degradation studies confirmed that 
there are only two degradation products observed in tedizolid phosphate powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion in both the aqueous solution and solid state. These results indicate that the finished product is  not 
photosensitive and consequently does not require any special labelling or packaging to mitigate exposure to 
light. 
The in-use stability of the drug product was assessed on samples reconstituted with 4 ml of WFI. Samples were 
either immediately analysed, stored for 24 hours under room temperature, in a refrigerator (2-8 °C), or exposed 
to fluorescent light. The solutions were tested for appearance, pH, visible particulate matter, assay, organic 
impurities,  and  sub-visible  particulates.  No  significant  changes  were  observed  for  any  of  the  parameters 
measured. Therefore, the data supports that the finished product is physically and chemically stable for up to 24 
hours when reconstituted with WFI, and stored under the above-mentioned conditions. 
Compatibility  of  the  drug  product  reconstituted  with  0.9%  aqueous  NaCl  solution  in  IV  bags  was  studied  in 
combination  with  different  IV  administration  sets  that  represent  those  typically  found  in  the  clinical  setting. 
Reconstituted  solutions  were  evaluated  for  up  to  24  hours  under  both  room  temperature  and  refrigerated 
conditions.  All  samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  particulate  matter,  assay,  impurities,  and  pH.  Results

demonstrated that the drug product solutions are physically, chemically and microbiologically stable for up to 24 
hours in the IV bags and administration sets used in the study. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Tedizolid  phosphate  (TR-701  FA)  is  a  novel  oxazolidinone  prodrug  antibiotic  that  is  converted  in  vivo  by 
phosphatases to the microbiologically active moiety tedizolid (TR-700). It has been developed for both oral (p.o) 
and intravenous (i.v) use. Sivextro tablets and lyophilized powder for injection are indicated for the treatment of 
acute  bacterial  skin  and  skin  structure  infections  (ABSSSI)  caused  by  susceptible  isolates.  TR-701  FA  is  a 
pro-drug  with  a  molecular  weight  of  450.32  and  a  molecular  formula  of  C17H16FN6O6P.  TR-701  FA  has  1 
asymmetric  center,  leading  to  2  possible  enantiomers.  The  absolute  configuration  at  the  5-position  of  the 
oxazolidinone ring is the R optical isomer.  There are no cis-trans isomers of TR-701 FA.  The chemical structures 
of TR-701 FA and TR-700 are given in the figure below:  
Figure 1

The proposed dosage regimen is 200 mg once daily (oral and intravenous (IV) routes of administration) for 
6 days  for  the  treatment  of  acute  bacterial  skin  and  skin  structure  infections  (ABSSSI).  The  steady  state 
geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-24 TR-700 values at the human therapeutic oral dose of 200 mg/day are 2.2 
µg/mL and 24.6 µg.hr/mL, respectively. 
The TR-701/FA nonclinical pharmacodynamics and safety pharmacology program included in vitro and in vivo 
evaluations of the TR-700 efficacy profile against pathogens relevant to cSSTIs/ABSSSI and hospital-acquired 
lung  infections,  an  investigation  of  its  potential  off-target  pharmacological  activities,  and  its  actions  on 
physiological responses both in vivo and in isolated tissues. 
GLP 
Non-clinical studies on safety pharmacology, general toxicity, including reproduction and genetic toxicity studies 
were conducted in accordance with GLP principles. Relevant toxicokinetic/pharmacokinetic studies were also 
conducted according to GLP. Some other studies were not conducted to GLP but were conducted consistent with 
considerations of adequate scientific standards of quality and justification has been provided by the applicant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The mechanism of action of tedizolid involves the inhibition of protein synthesis. Tedizolid binds to the peptidyl 
transferase  centre  of  the  50S  ribosomal  subunit  and  inhibits  the  initiation  phase  of  translation;  tedizolid  is 
3.4-fold more potent than linezolid as a prokaryotic protein synthesis inhibitor.  
Tedizolid  was  demonstrated  in  vitro  to  be  active  against  microorganisms  relevant  to  cSSTIs  and 
hospital-acquired lung  infections;  tedizolid was  4- to  32-fold  more potent than  linezolid  against  a  variety  of 
clinical  Gram-positive  isolates,  including  vancomycin-  resistant  and  linezolid-resistant  staphylococcal  and 
enterococcal clinical isolates.  
In  vivo  studies  were  conducted  in  animal  models  of  infection  using  linezolid  as  comparator.  The  ED 50s  of 
tedizolid in systemic lethal infections induced by S.aureus (MRSA and MSSA) ranged from 1.5 mg/kg to 7.6 
mg/kg and were generally lower than for linezolid. In mouse infected with MRCoNS, tedizolid was more effective 
than linezolid. In neutropenic mice infected with VRE or VSE pathogens, tedizolid was 2 to 4 fold more potent 
than  linezolid.  Lethality  due  to  systemic  infections  in  mice,  induced  by  penicillin  susceptible  and 
penicillin-resistant S.pneumoniae was prevented by tedizolid at ED 50 3 to 6 fold lower than for linezolid using the 
intravenous route, but potency appeared similar using the oral route. In the neutropenic mouse infected with a 
S.aureus  strain  carrying  the  chloramphenicol-florfenicol-resistant  gene  encoding  a  23SrRNA  that  confers 
resistance to linezolid, chloramphenicol and clindamycin, administration of tedizolid at 20 mg/kg resulted in a 
100%  survival.  A  published  study  (Drusano  et  al.,  Antimicrobial  Agents  and  Chemotherapy,  Nov.  2011,  p. 
5300–5305) in a thigh infection model showed that several fold higher intraperitoneal doses were required for 
stasis in granulocytopenic compared with non-granulocytopenic mouse infected with MRSA. In models of skin 
and soft tissue infections due to MSSA and MRSA, tedizolid was more potent than linezolid producing higher log 10 
CFU reduction. Efficacy appeared similar to linezolid at plasma exposures simulating human dosage. 
Administration  of  tedizolid  phosphate  by  multiple  routes  was  effective  and  tedizolid  was  consistently  more 
potent  than  linezolid  against  a  variety  of  pathogens  including:  (i)  staphylococci,  including  MRSA, 
linezolid-resistant MRSA and MRCoNS, (ii) enterococci, including VRE, and (iii) penicillin-resistant streptococci 
tested in a series of systemic lethal and localized animal infection models including skin and soft tissue infections 
and  pneumonia/lung  infections.  Especially  noteworthy  was  the  efficacy  against  Gram-positive  pathogens 
Assessment report

resistant  to  a  broad  range  of  antibiotics  commonly  used  in  the  treatment  of  cSSTIs,  including  resistant  to 
linezolid. Additionally, in non-granulocytopenic mice which were administered tedizolid, the in vivo bactericidal 
activity  against  staphylococcal  infections  was  achieved  at  far  lower  doses  than  in  granulocytopenic  mice, 
suggesting  the  substantial  amplification  (approximately  25-fold)  of  the  antimicrobial  efficacy  due  to  the 
presence of granulocytes.   
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Tedizolid  was  tested  in  a  panel  of  147  biochemical  assays  and  30  enzyme  assays  using  concentrations  of 
tedizolid (TR-700) of up to 20 µM. In this in vitro assessment of the potential secondary pharmacological activity 
of tedizolid carried out with biochemical, enzyme and radioligand binding assays, the only noteworthy finding 
was a weak and reversible inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B. This inhibition of MAO is potentially associated with 
pressor  responses  resulting  from  the  absorption  of  unmetabolized  dietary  tyramine,  and  with  excessive 
serotonergic activity when co-administered with serotonin agonists and reuptake inhibitors. Focused phase 1 
studies using steady-state plasma tedizolid levels found no evidence of a meaningful risk for the potentiation of 
the  pressor  response  to  oral  pseudoephedrine  or  altered  sensitivity  to  tyramine  associated  with  the 
administration of tedizolid phosphate, compared with placebo (studies TR701-114, TR701-105). These results 
were consistent with the negative results in animal models of peripheral (rat tyramine pressor response) and 
central (5-HTP mouse head-twitch) MAO inhibitory activity, where no effects were observed at tedizolid plasma 
Cmax levels approximately 27-fold greater than the Cmax levels observed in humans at the therapeutic dose. 
Linezolid served as a positive control in these animal studies.  This lack of activity in vivo is predicted by low 
circulating peak tedizolid plasma concentrations relative to the IC50 for MAO inhibition.  In addition, the low 
brain penetration of tedizolid relative to linezolid (brain:plasma ratio of linezolid >4-fold higher than tedizolid in 
rats) may contribute to the lack of central MAO inhibition following the administration of tedizolid phosphate. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Tedizolid  was  evaluated  for  its  potential  interference  with  the  central  nervous  system,  cardiovascular, 
respiratory, autonomic nervous system, the gastrointestinal and the renal organ function in vivo at doses of up 
to  200  mg/kg  and  in  vitro  at  concentrations  up  to  20  µM.  Both  tedizolid  (TR-700)  and  tedizolid  phosphate 
(TR-701)  were  tested  in  in  vitro  studies.  No  effects  on  cardiovascular  parameters  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  were 
reported. Exposure in an in vivo dog study was up to 3-fold the clinical exposure and in vitro margins up to 
17-fold were obtained using clinical free plasma concentrations.  A small, transient, but significant decrease in 
the body temperature was evident in mice at 100 mg/kg. Further, spontaneous locomotor activity showed a 
modest, but transient decrease and doses of 100 mg/kg and a 23% increase in the hexobarbital sleep time was 
noted in mice.  This dose in mice is estimated to correspond to TR-700 exposures  20-fold greater than the 
exposure in humans at the recommended oral dose. In rats, the dose of 100 mg/kg caused a 40% decrease in 
the gastric volume secretion without affecting pH or total acidity and in the renal study moderate decreases in 
sodium  and  chloride  concentrations  were  reported,  possibly  related  to  a  trend  towards  an  increased  urine 
volume at the same dose. A single dose of tedizolid phosphate to rats at 100 mg/kg is associated with a TR-700 
Cmax approximately 33-fold the Cmax in humans at the therapeutic dose of 200 mg/day. Taken together these 
findings  could  indicate  a  potential  for  effects  on  the  central  nervous  and  gastrointestinal  system,  but  the 
magnitude of those effects and the margins of exposure to therapeutic levels were of limited clinical concern. 
The adverse reactions currently described in section 4.8 of the Sivextro SmPC include possibly related clinical 
effects.    The  CHMP  agreed  that  from  the  non-clinical  point  of  view,  the  primary,  secondary  and  safety 
pharmacology of tedizolid is sufficiently investigated.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  studies  of  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  were  conducted.  The  general  pharmacological  profiles  of 
TR-701 and TR-700 did not suggest a potential for pharmacodynamic interactions, with the exception of the 
action in inhibiting MAO, which has been adequately investigated.  
Conclusions 
Taken together, the results of the pharmacodynamic and safety pharmacology studies show a favorable profile 
of TR-701/FA.  In vitro, tedizolid is highly effective in a variety of bacterial pathogens, including against some 
resistant organisms.  Tedizolid, administered in the form of the prodrug tedizolid phosphate, was effective in 
models of systemic and localized infection, with higher potency compared to linezolid.  Tedizolid effects appear 
to undergo a dramatic amplification in the presence of granulocytes.  Safety pharmacology studies of TR-700 
and  TR-701  examined  doses  resulting  in  plasma  concentrations  greatly  exceeding  the  systemic  TR-700 
concentrations experienced by human patients, and did not result in findings  relevant to the human safety.  
Overall,  the  results  were  supportive  of  a  favorable  safety  and  efficacy  profile  of  TR-701/FA  against  ABSSSI 
infections in humans. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  absorption,  distribution,  metabolism,  and  excretion  profiles  of  tedizolid  and  tedizolid  phosphate  were 
studied in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs.  In vitro evaluations assisted in exploring the distribution and metabolic 
profiles of TR 700 and TR 701.   
Single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for TR 700 in plasma were determined after oral and intravenous 
(IV) administration of TR 701 in mice, rats, and dogs and after IV and oral administration of TR 700 in mice and 
rats.  In all three species, TR 701 was rapidly and extensively metabolized to TR 700, and exposure to TR 700 
was generally proportional to the administered dose of TR 701.  TR 701 was reliably detectable in plasma after 
IV administration of TR 701, but appeared only at very low concentrations, if at all, after oral administration.  
Single dose administration of TR 701 FA in rats and dogs resulted in rapid exposure to TR 700 across a range of 
doses. 
The  results  of  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicokinetic  studies  conducted  across  several  species  indicate  that  the 
administration of TR 701 or TR 701 FA resulted in a substantial exposure to TR 700 in plasma and in the most of 
the tissues.  Due to the rapid conversion to TR 700, the exposure to TR 701 itself was low and transient after IV 
administration in rats and dogs.  Studies determining absolute oral bioavailability of either TR 700 or TR 701 in 
rodents confirmed that although the systemic exposure to the prodrug forms was extremely limited after oral 
administration  (≤8%),  the  superior  absorption  of  TR  700  from  oral  TR  701  versus  oral  TR  700  led  to  a 
significantly greater bioavailability of the active moiety (63% to 93% versus 29% to 49%).  Circulating TR 701 
was not detected in dogs after oral administration of TR 701.  These findings  are supportive of the prodrug 
approach to TR 700 delivery, and are concordant with human results showing essentially an equivalent exposure 
to TR 700 after oral or IV administration of TR 701. 
Both single-dose and repeat-dose studies demonstrated a relatively orderly increase in the TR 700 exposure 
when the dose of TR 701/FA was increased, although some departures from dose proportionality were observed 
at  relatively  high  IV  and  oral  doses  in  dogs.    The  observed  variability  in  the  PK  parameters  after  the  oral 
administration  of  TR  701/FA  in  dogs  may  be  partly  explained  by  the  appearance  of  emesis.    In  single-dose 
studies, noteworthy sex differences in the exposure to TR 700 after administration of the prodrug were observed 
only in rats, with an approximately 3-fold higher exposure in females than males.  Because of these differences, 
doses in later rat studies were different for males and females. The clinical significance of these differences was 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 23/110 
  
  
not  further  explored  by  the  applicant  and  was  not  deemed  of  clinical  relevance.  The  CHMP  agreed  that  the 
submitted results of repeat-dose pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic studies with TR 701 and TR 701 FA indicated 
that a sufficient exposure to TR 700 is maintained over time to facilitate an adequate evaluation of long-term 
safety,  and  that  the  PK  profile  of  TR  700  supports  the  proposed  human  regimen  of  once-daily  dose 
administration by oral and IV routes. 
TR 700 is moderately to extensively bound to plasma proteins (>70%) across all species tested, and [14C] TR 
701 derived materials are widely distributed to most tissues in both rats and dogs.  However, TR 700 does not 
well penetrate into the red blood cells. The majority (>50%) of TR-700 binding in plasma was to serum albumin. 
In a subcellular distribution study, TR 700 was associated with the cytosolic fraction in macrophages and not 
with mitochondria or lysosomes, organelles often implicated in adverse reactions. 
In Caco-2 cells, TR-700 was highly permeable with no significant efflux at concentrations up to 100 µM inferring 
that TR-700 will exhibit high absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Foetuses were exposed to TR 700 in dams 
dosed with TR 701 FA.  TR 700 was also secreted into the milk of lactating rats dosed with TR 701 FA, and 
therefore pups of the F1 generation were exposed to TR 700. 
TR  701  is  metabolically  stable  in  animal  and  human  liver  microsomes.  In  contrast,  TR  701  is  unstable  in 
heparinized blood and plasma samples and in rat S9 liver fractions, with the disappearance of TR 701 paralleled 
by the appearance of TR  700 except in the presence of a cocktail of specific phosphatase inhibitors.  These 
findings suggest that the rapid biotransformation of TR 701/FA to TR 700 in vivo is not mediated by the CYP P450 
system, but rather by endogenous phosphatase enzymes that are ubiquitously distributed in blood and tissues.  
Neither  TR-701/FA  nor  TR-700  detectably  inhibited  the  metabolism  of  selected  CYP  enzyme  substrates, 
including time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A. In primary human hepatocyte cultures, TR-700 (up to 10 μM) did 
not induce mRNA of CYP isoforms (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, and 2C19,) with  the exception of concentration 
dependent increase in CYP3A4 (greater than 2-fold increase in CYP3A4 mRNA was observed with tedizolid. The 
results  from  an  ex  vivo  study  in  rats  confirmed  that  the  TR  701  administration  does  not  result  in  clinically 
significant induction of CYP enzymes and studies using human biomaterials confirmed that TR 701 and TR 700 
are  not  CYP  inhibitors.    In  vitro  studies  have  shown  that  TR-700  and  TR-701/FA  are  unlikely  to  result  in 
meaningful inhibition of P-gp, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, or OATP 1B3 transporters, whereas a clinical significant 
interaction with OATP 1B1 cannot be excluded. Inhibition of the efflux transporter BCRP (also known as ABCG2) 
was observed in Caco-2 cells by TR-700 (IC50=51.1 μM) and TR-701 (IC50=79.8 μM, presumably by being 
converted to TR-700 in vitro). The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. While these findings in general 
suggest little risk for significant PK drug-drug interactions with TR 701 FA, the potential for induction of CYP3A4 
needs to be further investigated. 
Based on the positive results for CYP3A4 induction, the applicant is also asked to perform an in vivo induction 
study as a post-approval measure. As a first step of this measure, a suggested study setup to allow for the 
optimal  capture  a  potential  CYP3A  induction  (e.g.  based  on  the  tedizolid  half-life,  and  the  turnover  rate  of 
CYP3A4, the maximum induction effect is reached after at least 10 days of  tedizolid treatment duration) should 
be submitted. The SmPC was updated until the results of this study will be assessed. 
A study in rats confirmed that there is no evidence of an in vivo interconversion from the (R) enantiomer of 
TR-700 to the (S) enantiomer after the oral administration of (R) TR 701 FA. The principal circulating metabolite 
of TR 701 in rats and dogs is TR 700, with no other metabolite identified in plasma.  Radioprofiling of rat urine 
samples after administration of [14C] TR 701 identified seven metabolites, most notably TR 700 sulfate, while 
in the urine of dogs, the most noteworthy peaks corresponded to N desmethyl TR 700 and TR 700 sulfate.  Very 
small  amounts  of  TR  700  were  recovered  in  the  urine  after  IV  or  oral  administration  of  TR  701.    Additional 
evidence  from  rats  suggests  that  small  amounts  of  TR  700  leave  the  systemic  circulation  through  biliary

excretion.  The main elimination pathway for the TR 701/FA metabolic products is through the faeces, mainly in 
the form of TR 700 sulfate.  Nearly all of an administered dose of radiolabeled TR 701 is eliminated in faeces 
(approximately 90%) and in urine (approximately 10%) within 7 days after a single dose.  Given that as small 
fraction of TR 700 is detected in the urine or in the faeces, urinary tract infections would not be expected to be 
optimally treated with TR 701 FA. 
The  drug  substance  used  in  non-clinical  and  clinical  studies  consists  of  approximately  99.5%  of  the 
(R)-enantiomer. No significant in vivo interconversion of (R) to (S)-TR-700 form was evident in rat given single 
oral doses of TR-701 FA, pure (R) enantiomer. 
The major part of a dose of TR-701 in rat was excreted in faeces. Urinary excretion accounted for about 10% of 
dose after both oral and intravenous doses in males and females. In bile duct cannulated rats the mean amount 
of TR-700 recovered in bile after 4 hours was 1.76%- after a single intravenous dose of TR-701. Like in rats, the 
main route of elimination in dogs was the faecal excretion. After single oral or intravenous doses 83 to 107% of 
the  14C-TR-701 derived radioactivity was excreted in the faeces within the first 24 hours post dose. Urinary 
excretion accounted for approximately 10%.  
After repeated oral or intravenous doses in dog systemic exposure increased greater than dose-proportional.  
In humans, only tedizolid was detected in plasma. All human metabolites in plasma, urine and faeces were also 
present  in  rat  and  dog.  CHMP  agreed  that  the  submitted  pharmacokinetic  data  provide  a  sufficient 
characterisation of all relevant parameters. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
In single dose toxicity studies, bolus intravenous doses of 250 mg/kg resulted in deaths in mouse and rat while 
mortalities in dogs were noted at doses > 100 mg/kg. Likewise oral doses of 2000 mg/kg in rat were coupled to 
mortality  (females  only),  while  no  deaths  occurred  in  mice  or  males  rats  at  comparable  doses.  In  rodents, 
evidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects were evident.Dilatation of cecum, likely due to the antibiotic action 
of the test article against cecum microflora, was reported in both single and repeated dose toxicity studies in 
rodents. In dogs, hypoactivity and gastrointestinal adverse effects were noted primarily at doses ≥ 100 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The hematopoietic and the gastrointestinal systems were the primary targets following PO and IV repeat dose 
administration  of  tedizolid  phosphate,  with  these  effects  showing  evidence  of  reversibility  and  occurring  at 
multiples of the human tedizolid therapeutic exposure level.  
Hematopoietic  effects  after  oral  administration  in  rats  were  characterized  by  mild-moderate  changes  in 
circulating RBC, WBC, and platelets, myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocyte hypocellularity in bone marrow, 
and decreased splenic B cells.  Changes in haematology indicative of myelosuppression were seen in rats after 
IV  administration,  although  no  bone  marrow  histological  changes  were  reported.    Consistent  with  the 
hematopoietic changes seen after PO dosing, rats also had lower immunoglobulin titres and showed a decreased 
ability to respond to an antigen challenge at dose levels at or near those showing haematological effects.  These 
immunotoxicity results are consistent with findings in the 4-week general toxicity study in rats which showed a 
reversible decrease in splenic B-cell lymphocyte subpopulations.  In dogs, hypocellularity in the bone marrow 
was seen in one dog after IV administration at clinically intolerant doses. 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 25/110 
  
  
Deaths  and  intolerance  leading  to  early  terminations  of  animals  were  evident  in  both  rat  and  dog  oral  and 
intravenous studies, although in the performed dog oral study these could have been due to gavage errors. In 
rats, in the oral studies of 1 and 3 months duration, doses of 100 mg/kg/day were not tolerated, but resulted in 
body weight loss, haematological effects, bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract atrophy, morbidity and deaths. 
At a non-tolerated dose of 100 mg/kg in rat, tedizolid related effects were also noted in the liver (centrilobular 
hepatocellular degeneration), the gastrointestinal tract (focal erosion, single cell necrosis in the colon, mucosal 
ulceration in the rectum), male kidney (tubular hyaline droplets, distal tubular proteinosis, inner medulla tubular 
necrosis),the male reproductive tract (atrophy/decreased secretion in the prostate/seminal vesicles/coagulation 
gland,  seminiferous  tubular  degeneration/haemorrhage/inflammation  in  the  testes)  as  well  as  the  female 
reproductive  tract  (ovarian  follicular  involution  and  atrophy  in  the  vagina  and  cervix).  The  dose  of  100 
mg/kg/day  corresponded  to  systemic  exposure  ratios  of  31-  to  14-fold  (systemic  exposure  decreased 
significantly from day 1 to day 28 in the 1 month study). Further, doses in rat of 90 mg/kg in males and 45 
mg/kg in females administered via slow push injection caused mortality, while less toxicity was apparent with 
daily  infusion  over  60  minutes  over  a  14  day  period.  Clinical  signs  of  gastrointestinal  intolerance  and 
hypoactivity tremors, gasping, pupil dilation, laboured respiration, convulsions and impaired equilibrium were 
noted prior to death. In a dog 2-week intravenous infusion study, body weight loss and severe local reactions 
including  oedema,  inflammation,  ulceration/necrosis,  hemorrhage,  and  vasculitis  contributed  to  an  early 
termination of high dose animals. At the highest dose level (100 mg/kg/2xday) bone marrow hypocellularity, 
atrophy of thymus, inflammation of duodenum, atrophy of oesophagus mucosa, and karyomegaly of the mucosa 
of the oesophagus, duodenum and jejunum were noted.  
Gastrointestinal  system  changes  in  rats  and  dogs  after  oral  administration  included  decreased  food  intake, 
reduced body weight gain, and stool effects at tolerated doses, and degeneration, necrosis, and erosion in the 
small/large  intestine  and/or  stomach  at  clinically  intolerant  doses.    Similar  GI  changes  were  seen  after  IV 
administration  in  rats  and  dogs,  although  secondary  effects  due  to  injection  site  toxicity  complicated  these 
changes in dogs. 
Nevertheless, it should be noted that hematopoietic and GI system changes have been reported with clinical use 
of a wide variety of antibiotics and are seen in both animals and humans. 
Other systemic toxicities seen in rats and dogs after repeat administration with tedizolid phosphate occurred at 
clinically intolerant dose levels that induced morbidity or moribundity.  These toxicities were only seen at doses 
that greatly exceeded the MTD and were considered related to or exacerbated by severe physiological stress. 
High dose effects in the 3-month study in rats included histopathological changes in the GI tract, lymphoid and 
glandular  tissues,  mammary  gland,  skeletal  muscle,  tongue,  liver,  male  kidney,  and  male  and  female 
reproductive tracts.  All these changes reversed or trended toward reversal during the post-treatment recovery 
period.  In dogs, effects secondary to the marked inflammatory changes at the IV injection sites were observed. 
Considering  the  oral  toxicity  studies  in  rodents,  the  applicant  was  requested  to  further  elaborate  on  the 
significant changes observed in thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow across the repeat 
dose studies described, and on the relevance and significance of these findings for the clinical safety of tedizolid 
in humans. The discussion took into consideration the consistent findings in the immunotoxicity studies. The 
applicant further clarified that the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics are coupled to effects on the haematopoietic 
system. Reversible myelosuppression has been reported and may result from inhibition of mitochondrial protein 
synthesis by oxazolidinones. Oral doses of tedizolid in rat caused mild to moderate changes in circulating RBC, 
WBC,  and  platelets,  myeloid,  erythroid,  and  megakaryocyte  hypocellularity  in  bone  marrow;  and  decreased 
splenic B cells.  After intravenous doses, changes in haematology indicative of myelosuppression were seen, 
although no bone marrow histological changes were reported.  In dogs, hypocellularity in bone marrow was seen

in one dog after IV administration at a high dose. Decreased cellularity/atrophy of lymphoid tissue was also 
observed and may have been associated with severe stress (body weight loss, moribund condition).  Elevation 
in splenic T-lymphocytes in the 1-month general toxicity study in rats was consistent with a stress response 
contributing to thymic lymphoid depletion. Myelosuppression is an identified risk and included in the RMP. 
Since peripheral and optic neuropathy were seen in both animals and humans which were administered linezolid, 
an extensive evaluation of the potential of tedizolid phosphate to cause peripheral and optic neuropathy was 
conducted in pigmented rats dosed for up to 9 months at dose levels up to  30 mg/kg/day in males and 10 
mg/kg/day in females.  This study showed no drug-related effects on survival, food consumption, functional 
observational battery assessments, locomotor activity, brain weight measurements, ocular examinations, and 
macroscopic  and  microscopic  neuropathological  findings  (includes  sciatic  and  optic  nerves,  retina  and  uveal 
tract).    No  evidence  of  peripheral  and  optic  neuropathy  was  observed  with  tedizolid  phosphate  at  plasma 
tedizolid exposures well above (approximately 8-fold) the human therapeutic exposure levels: moreover, the 
study involved 9 months of dosing as compared to 6 months in the study in which neuropathy findings were 
observed with linezolid. 
In  a  two-week  comparative  oral/intravenous  study  in  rat,  the  toxicity  of  TR-701  FA  and  linezolid  was 
investigated.  Overall,  after  oral  administration  clinical  signs,  haematological  parameters  and  organ  weight 
changes and histopathological changes were comparable for the two compounds, however, infusion with TR-701 
FA was not tolerated based on local injection site effects from the low dose of 40 mg/kg/day whereas no adverse 
effects were coupled to linezolid infusion twice daily at a dose 100 mg/kg.  
Qualitatively, target organs of toxicity appeared similar in rats after oral and intravenous administration with 
bone marrow hypocellularity and clinical as well as histopathological signs of gastrointestinal adverse effects. 
Tolerability  of  intravenous  doses  appeared  lower  than  after  oral  and  while  systemic  exposure  generally  was 
comparable at equal doses for both routes, Cmax ranged from 2-3 to 10-fold higher after intravenous doses. The 
applicant  further  addressed  the  apparent  lower  tolerance  of  intravenous  doses  compared  with  oral,  noted 
particularly in dog. The applicant presented a thorough discussion on the possible differences in the toxicological 
responses following oral and intravenous dosing. Submitted data were supportive of species dependence, with 
rats  seemingly  more  sensitive  than  dogs  to  the  acute  toxic  effects  of  tedizolid.  Higher  levels  of  tedizolid 
phosphate after intravenous dosing compared with oral doses may indicate that tedizolid phosphate may have 
contributed to the acute effects noted. In rats, severe acute systemic effects were noted with intravenous bolus 
doses coupled to high Cmax levels and severity was increased in males compared with females and related to the 
higher Cmax levels in males. Acute toxicity was not evident after a 60-minute intravenous infusion.  
In  dog  studies,  tedizolid  plasma  levels  were  consistently  lower  after  an  oral  dosing  compared  with  an 
intravenous one, also indicating lower bioavailability in dogs compared with rat and human. Comparisons of 
intravenous bolus and intravenous infusion doses in dog were consistent with the fact that acute toxicity was 
lower after intravenous infusion and with that dogs were less sensitive than rats to acute systemic effects.   
While  vascular  irritation  after  intravenous  infusion  was  observed  in  rats  and  dogs,  no  observations  of  local 
non-tolerance in humans have been reported to date. The concentrations of tedizolid phosphate and infusion 
rate seem important determinants for vascular irritation. Studies in rabbit did not indicate any irritation potential 
for inadvertent perivascular, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration. 
In terms of systemic exposure and maximum plasma levels, the highest levels were achieved in rat. At the 
proposed NOAELs in oral repeated dose toxicity studies, 30/10 mg/kg in male/female rat studies and 400/400 
mg/kg in male/female dog studies margins of exposure to expected clinical values ranged from x2 to x8. These 
values may be considered as estimates since these are based on averages of toxicokinetic data that exhibited 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 27/110 
  
  
marked time-dependent variability. Exposure to TR-701 was also determined in 3-month oral studies and was 
overall lower in dog than in rat oral studies. during 2 and 4 weeks in dogs and rats, respectively. 
The oxazolidine class of antibiotics have been known to have the potential for bone marrow suppression, due to 
inhibition of mammalian mitochondrial protein synthesis. In vitro tedizolid exhibited a potency of up to 20 times 
that of linezolid for the inhibition of the mitochondrial protein synthesis in rat heart. Both tedizolid and linezolid 
thus have a potential for myelosuppression.  
Genotoxicity 
Tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid were tested in a battery of genotoxicity studies and, considering the overall 
results,  the  weight  of  evidence  indicated  that  neither  the  prodrug  nor  the  active  moiety  would  present  a 
genotoxic risk to humans.  Because the results of genotoxicity testing did not reveal a relevant risk for humans, 
and since tedizolid phosphate is indicated only for short duration of therapeutic use, carcinogenicity studies were 
not conducted with tedizolid phosphate. Regarding studies performed on impurities, an intermediate 6 reference 
standard  (Rx600008)  and  Rx600009  was  considered  to  be  positive  for  mutagenic  activity  in  the  Salmonella 
strain TA100 with metabolic activation. The applicant further elaborated on the relevance of these findings and 
on how the risk associated to the positive mutagenic activity of these compounds was mitigated or reduced, and 
this was considered resolved (being a raised ‘other concern’). 
Carcinogenicity 
No  carcinogenicity  studies  have  been  conducted  and  are  not  required  consistent  with  standard  regulatory 
guidance.    
Reproduction and Developmental Toxicity 
No adverse related findings were identified in a fertility study conducted with tedizolid phosphate in rats and no 
toxicity to the reproductive organs was identified in a 28-day oral toxicity study conducted in rats or in 28-day 
and 3-month oral toxicity studies in dogs.  Reproductive organ effects in the 3-month rat oral toxicity study were 
limited  to  morbid/moribund  rats  that  did  not  tolerate  tedizolid  phosphate  doses  that  exceeded  the  MTD, 
indicating  stress  to  be  a  factor  in  these  changes.  Based  on  the  fertility  and  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies 
conducted with tedizolid phosphate, there is a limited if any risk of reproductive toxicity following administration 
of the therapeutic dose of tedizolid phosphate to humans.  In contrast to the findings with tedizolid phosphate, 
it is important to note that linezolid caused reversible infertility in male rats during reproductive function studies.  
The free acid form of tedizolid, TR-701 FA had no significant effects on fertility when tested at doses of 50 mg/kg 
in males and 15 mg/kg in females. These doses provided exposure multiples of approximately 4 -5 times the 
expected clinical exposure. A slight reduction in sperm number and epididymal weights was recorded, although 
the  changes  did  not  translate  into  any  functional  effects.  However,  considering  also  the  effects  on  male 
reproductive organs seen at high doses (100/60 mg/kg) in 3 month repeated dose studies in rats and the known 
effect on male fertility of the related oxazolidinone linezolid, the potential effects of tedizolid on fertility were 
further discussed by the applicant and the answers provided were considered satisfactory by CHMP.  
Concerning the embryo-foetal development this could not be assessed in rabbits due to dose-limiting toxicity to 
the GI tract, which is a common finding with antibacterial agents. Plasma tedizolid levels associated with the 
NOAEL in mice and rats were comparable to plasma levels at the human oral therapeutic dose. Lower mean 
foetal weights were noted at the high-dose level (25 mg/kg/day) and resulted in a lower mean gravid uterine 
weight in this group. In addition, a test article-related increase (not statistically significant) in the mean litter 
proportion of costal cartilage anomalies (primarily fusion);an exacerbation of the normal genetic predisposition 
to sternal variations in the CD-1 strain of mice) was noted in this treatment group. In rats, decreased foetal 
Assessment report

weights and foetal developmental delay contaminant with maternal toxicity was observed at the high-dose level 
(15 mg/kg/day) as increased mean litter proportions of skeletal variations indicative of delayed ossification. Rib 
and  vertebra  findings  that  were  not  indicative  of  developmental  delay  were  also  noted  for  foetuses  at  the 
high-dose level (15 mg/kg/day). Taken together, these data could not exclude the possibility for tedizolid to have 
a  teratogenic  effect.  The  applicant  was  invited  to  further  elaborate  on  the  relevance  of  these  findings, 
considering the data in the high dose groups. In its answer, the applicant explained that the effects noted in the 
embryofoetal  development  studies  in  mouse  and  rat  seemed  consistent  with  those  noted  for  other 
oxazolidinones.  In mouse, exposure margins for both linezolid and tedizolid were about 4-fold the expected 
clinical levels when considering decreased foetal body weights and increases in costal cartilage fusion. In rat 
decreases in foetal body weight and reduced ossification of sternebrae, vertebrae and skull occurred at about 
6-fold the expected clinical levels with higher exposure levels for tedizolid compared with linezolid.  CHMP agreed 
that the observed changes were not life-threatening and that they should not be considered as representative of 
teratogenic effects.  
The applicant has further discussed the pre- and postnatal development (PPND) rat study. The discrepancy in 
the number of pups dead/missing, cannibalized in vehicle and high dose group was attributed to one litter with 
a  high  incidence  (8)  of  pups  with  adverse  outcomes.  Pups  with  pale  body  and  smaller  stature  seemed  to 
correlate with a high incidence of dead and missing pups in the high dose group. The applicant indicated that on 
a per litter basis no statistically significant differences were apparent between control and high dose. Group 
survival was comparable.  The high dose in the study likely represented not more than two times the exposure 
margin to the expected clinical, but was based on maternal effects seen in an embryotoxicity study. The CHMP 
considered the text included in section 5.3 of the SPC as satisfactory and reflecting the generated data. 
Prenatal and postnatal development after administration of TA-701 FA was investigated in rat using doses of 
1.25  to  3.75  mg/kg.    No  effects  on  either  the  maternal  function  or  on  the  development  of  offspring,  early 
behaviour,  physical  development,  sensory  functions,  genital  development  and  mating  ability  and  fertility  of 
offspring were evident. There were occasional statistically significant differences between groups in parameters 
monitored,  however,  due  to  the isolated occurrence  and  values  similar  to  historical  controls overall  findings 
appeared incidental and not related to treatment of maternal animals. The number of pups found dead/missing, 
presumed cannibalized/euthanized between birth and PND21 amounted to 16, 16, 24, and 32 in the control, low, 
mid and high dose groups, respectively. There was 1 litter each in mid and high dose group with unusually high 
number (7 and 8)  dead/missing and as the remaining 22 to 23 litters did not show higher mortality, the death 
of these pups were considered incidental. Pale body/small stature was noted for 12 and 11 pups, respectively, 
in the 3.75 mg/kg group during the period birth to PND 21 and because 4 of 7 were from the same litter overall 
the findings were considered incidental. The Applicant has proposed a NOAEL of 3.75 mg/kg/d for F 0 maternal 
systemic toxicity, F1  neonatal/developmental toxicity, F1 sexual maturation, systemic, neurobehavioral, and 
reproductive toxicity, F2 neonatal toxicity. No test article-related effects on F2 postnatal survival or pup body 
weights and body weight gains were noted. Food intake was slightly decreased in high dose maternal animals, 
but there was no effect on body weight.  Systemic exposure at the high dose in the present study was likely not 
more than x2 clinical exposure.  
Tedizolid exposure to foetuses and pups has shown that tedizolid is excreted in the milk of lactating rats and 
tedizolid plasma levels in foetuses indicated the placenta transfer of tedizolid.   
No juvenile toxicity studies have been conducted, which is acceptable for the present indication.    
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data generated in rats after repeated intravenous doses, despite some interpretation difficulties, 
showed marked gender differences in exposure with higher exposures in females than in males were apparent. 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 29/110 
  
  
Early toxicology studies had shown an approximate 3-fold higher plasma exposure to tedizolid in female rats 
versus male rats at a given dose level (due to a slower tedizolid plasma clearance in female rats), subsequent 
repeat-dose  toxicology  studies  used  lower  doses  for  female  versus  male  rats.    Sex  differences  in 
pharmacokinetics were not observed in other animal species, or in humans.  In all toxicology studies, plasma 
tedizolid AUC increased with increasing doses of tedizolid phosphate. Dose duration had no noticeable effects on 
tedizolid plasma levels in animals; therefore, AUC study values determined on multiple occasions were averaged 
when used in calculating margins relative to humans.  This approach provided a more consistent and generally 
more conservative estimate of exposure than using the final AUC determination. 
Local Tolerance  
While  injection  site  toxicity  was  noted  with  IV  infusion  in  animals,  tedizolid  phosphate-related  infusion  site 
phlebitis  was  not  detected  in  a  venous  tolerability  study  conducted  in  humans  under  dose  administration 
conditions  utilized  for  therapeutic  IV  administration.    There  also  was  no  evidence  of  irritation  potential  for 
inadvertent  perivascular,  intramuscular,  or  subcutaneous  administration  using  the  therapeutic  IV  dose 
concentration  with  the  lyophilized  tedizolid  phosphate  drug  product  in  rabbits.    These  results  indicate  that 
injection site complications are not expected with the proposed therapeutic use of tedizolid phosphate via the IV 
route. 
In local toxicity studies in rat, dose-related acute perivasculitis and , thrombosis were evident at 5.4 mg/kg/day 
and perivasculitis, thrombosis, and vasculitis were evident at 18 mg/kg/day when infused over 120 minutes.  In 
local toxicity studies in dog, dose-related microscopic findings of endothelial and subintimal vacuolation and 
inflammation,  thrombosis,  vasculitis  and  oedema,  haemorrhage,  fibrinous  exudate  and  inflammation  in  the 
subcutis were observed at the injection site at ≥ 6.6 mg/kg (1.1  mg/mL).  Swollen forelimb(s), thrombosis, 
amorphous, lamellated, amphophilic material in the thrombi and vascular walls were noted at 19.8 mg/kg (3.3 
mg/mL)  when  infused  over  60  minutes.  Swelling  of  right  cephalic  injection  site,  edematous  right  and  left 
cephalic injection sites were noted at 66 mg/kg (11 mg/mL) when infused over 60 minutes. The NOAEL for 
vascular irritation was 3.4 mg/kg/day when infusion was over 120 minutes.  
In rabbit, acute perivascular, intramuscular or subcutaneous injections did not result in any definitive tedizolid 
related reactions.  
Other toxicity studies 
In addition to conducting pivotal general toxicology studies with tedizolid phosphate, a number of special toxicity 
studies were conducted. 
Immunotoxicity 
Data from a 4 week repeated dose toxicity study in rat using oral doses of up to 100 mg/kg in males and 30 
mg/kg in females showed immunosuppressive effects of tedizolid characterised at the high dose in males by 
decreased in splenic cell counts, decreases in T cells, B cells and double positive T cells. In females, a decrease 
in splenic cell counts (not statistically significant) and a slight decrease in T cells were reported. IgG titer was 
significantly  decreased  from  doses  of  ≥30  mg/kg/day.  IgG  and  IgM  induced  plaque  formation  was 
dose-dependently  decreased.  The  clinical  relevance  of  potential  immunotoxicological  effects  were  further 
discussed and considered satisfactory.  
Phototoxicity 
Tedizolid did not induce any relevant phototoxic reactions in a study in pigmented rat treated with a single oral 
dose of TA-701 FA followed by UVR exposure. The positive control 8-MOP gave expected responses.

Mechanistic Studies 
These studies were undertaken to compare the capacity of tedizolid and linezolid to inhibit protein synthesis in 
isolated rat heart mitochondria. Both compounds inhibited mitochondrial protein synthesis in the two studies 
performed, with tedizolid being 20 to 25 more potent than linezolid. Assays with TR-701 in this system were 
consistent with a slow conversion of TR-701 to TR-700. However, the relevance of this finding to the toxicity 
induced by tedizolid is uncertain because tedizolid was not associated with mitochondria in incubations carried 
out  in  intact  macrophages,  even  though  substantial  uptake  into  the  cytosol  occurred.  Additionally,  safety 
margins for tedizolid plasma levels at the NOAELs identified in animal toxicology studies, relative to the human 
therapeutic plasma exposure, were substantially and consistently greater than the safety margins derived for 
linezolid. 
Dependence 
Tedizolid was shown to inhibit MAO in in vitro studies but follow-up studies, including any potential potentiation 
of 5-HTP head-twitch in mice or effects on brain monoamine levels, failed to show any in vivo consequences of 
this activity. No CNS or withdrawal symptoms suggestive of dependency were noted in the nonclinical general 
toxicity and safety pharmacology studies, as well as in human clinical trials. Consequently, studies of potential 
dependence were not considered necessary and were therefore not conducted. 
Impurities 
The impurities BisRx600022, (S)-TR-701, Rx600013 and Rx600014 were qualified in 2-week rat repeated dose 
toxicity studies using intravenous administration. In addition, impurities were screened and tested for genotoxic 
potential. Positive results were reported for (R)-glycidyl butyrate, Rx600008 and Rx600009. The data have been 
appropriately considered in the proposed specification limits for impurities. 
Further considerations

Although  tedizolid  inhibits  protein  synthesis  in  isolated  rat  heart  mitochondria  (SPH-08-0701-028),  it  did 
not distribute to the mitochondrial subcellular compartment when incubated with macrophages (murine cell line) 
even though substantial concentrations were taken up into the cytosolic fraction.  
While NOAEL doses for oral repeat-dose studies remained constant throughout 9 months of administration in 
rats and 3 months of administration in dogs, exposure margins ranged from 3.7- to 7.4-fold for rats and 3.0- to 
6.8 -fold for dogs.  Without trends in dosage duration, these margins can be averaged across studies, generating 
overall exposure margins of approximately 5.4-fold in rats and 4.7-fold in dogs.  Exposure margins were more 
consistent  with  IV  administration  of  tedizolid  phosphate,  ranging  from  3.3-  to  4.3-fold  in  rats  and  3.1-  to 
3.2-fold  in  dogs.    In  addition,  relatively  large  exposure  margins  were  identified  for  both  males  and  females 
during  fertility  testing,  while  NOAEL  doses  in  the  embryofetal  development  and  pre/post-natal  studies  were 
comparable  to  tedizolid  plasma  AUCs  generated  at  the  human  therapeutic  dose.    In  the  mouse  and  rat 
embryofetal development studies, minor developmental findings were noted at the next highest dose above the 
NOAEL.  These Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) doses provide plasma exposure margins of 4-fold 
(mice) and 2.3-fold (rats).

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  applicant  has  submitted  an  environmental  risk  assessment  in  accordance  with  the  CHMP  guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr.1, June 2006). The studies comprised: a soil adsorption coefficient, a ready 
biodegradability test, a water/sediment study, chronic toxicity studies in aquatic organisms and an activated 
sludge respiration test. The applicant concluded that no environmental risk has been identified as a consequence 
of the use of tedizolid. 
However,  the  Activated  Sludge,  Respiration  Inhibition  Test  (OECD209)  provided  cannot  be  validated  as  the 
results are not clearly defined. Therefore the applicant is requested to submit a new study.

2.3.1.   Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Primary  pharmacology  including  the  antibacterial  activity  of  tedizolid  is  well  described.  In  the  secondary 
pharmacology studies, the inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B was shown, and tedizolid appeared in vitro a more 
potent inhibitor of MAO-A than linezolid. However, in vivo studies using single doses up to 300 mg/kg in mouse 
did not indicate any functionally significant effect of in vitro MAO inhibition. 
Minor effects on body temperature, locomotor activity and hexobarbital sleeping time were noted in the safety 
pharmacology studies. Functional effects on the gastric secretion were reported in rats. The magnitude of the 
effects and the margins of exposure to expected therapeutic levels could indicate limited clinical concern. 
Pharmacokinetic characterisation of tedizolid was consistent with rat and dog being appropriate species to use 
in toxicology studies. The toxicology profile after oral or intravenous administration was investigated in repeated 
dose studies in rat and dog. Durations of oral and intravenous toxicity studies were up to 3 months and 28 days, 
respectively. Haematological and gastrointestinal reactions were primary findings.  
The  CHMP  concluded  concluded  that  the  general  toxicity  of  tedizolid  has  been  sufficiently  investigated  and 
characterised in studies that comply with applicable guidelines and regulatory requirements. Studies evaluating 
the reproduction process in mouse and rat indicated a potential for reproduction toxicity including embryotoxic 
effects. Data from an in vitro chromosomal aberration study showed positive results, while subsequent in vivo 
studies were negative and overall CHMP was in agreement that tedizolid did not appear to have any clinically 
significant genotoxic potential. 
2.3.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical tests and data available for tedizolid are considered sufficient and adequate taking into account 
the intended indication and dosages proposed. CHMP agreed however to request the applicant to submit a new 
respiration inhibition test on activated sludge microorganisms as a post-authorisation measure.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Tedizolid  phosphate  (TR-701  FA)  is  a  novel  oxazolidinone  prodrug  antibiotic  developed  for  the  treatment  of 
acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections by both intravenous (IV) and oral routes of administration. The 
proposed commercial drug product dosage forms are tedizolid phosphate formulated as a 200 mg tablet and a 
lyophilised powder for reconstitution for intravenous (IV) use.  
Tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid has one asymmetric center, leading to two possible enantiomers. Tedizolid 
phosphate  is  administered  as  the  R  isomer.  At  least  in  the  rat,  no  significant  in  vivo  inter-conversion  from 
R-tedizolid to S-tedizolid occurs. In vitro stability data, showing high stability of the R-isomer, also support the 
assumption of a low risk for in vivo inter-conversion in humans. 
After  dissolution  in  the  GI  tract,  TR-701  FA  is  rapidly  converted  by  phosphatases  to  tedizolid  (TR-700),  the 
microbiologically active moiety. As an inactive and short-lived prodrug, pharmacokinetics of tedizolid phosphate 
are relatively unimportant. 
The PK of tedizolid has been evaluated by the applicant in 9 phase 1 studies, 1 phase 2 study and 2 phase 3 
studies. Two further phase 1 studies were conducted independently in Japanese patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 36/110 
  
  
 
 
The  PK  evaluation  was  thorough,  including  studies  in  healthy  subjects  and  in  patients  with  cSSTI,  and 
evaluations  of  the  effect  of  age  (elderly  and  adolescent  subjects),  renal  and  hepatic  impairment,  sex  and 
ethnicity on the PK of tedizolid. The specific phase 1 PK studies were complemented by population PK analyses 
that incorporated data from the phase 2 study TR701-104 and both phase 3 clinical studies (TR701-112 and 
TR701-113). 
In  most  of  the  PK  clinical  studies,  the  usual  PK  parameters  (AUC0-t,  AUC0-inf,  Cmax,  t½,  λz,  Cl/F,  Vz/F)  were 
calculated  based  on  the  plasma  concentrations  of  TR-700,  the  active  metabolite  of  TR-701,  using  a  model 
independent approach. The statistical analysis of primary PK parameters (usually, AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax) was 
performed using conventional methods recommended in bioequivalence studies (ANOVA, CI 90%). 
Pharmacokinetics of TR-701 
Following  IV  infusion  of  TR-701  FA,  TR-701  does  not  appear  to  enter  into  tissues  significantly  (Vss  of 
approximately  10  L,  a  volume  slightly  smaller  than  extracellular  body  fluid),  is  rapidly  converted  to  TR-700 
(half-life of approximately 10 minutes) presumably by alkaline phosphatases in the circulation, and is generally 
present at detectable concentrations in plasma for approximately 1 hour (TR701-107).  
Following  oral  administration,  trace  concentrations  of  TR-701  in  plasma  have  been  detected  only  at  the 
highest administered supratherapeutic dose of 1200 mg TR-701/FA (TR701-101 and TR701-115). Absolute oral 
bioavailability of TR-701 is <1%. Activation, by formation of TR-700, would occur during absorption process 
extensively through the first passage in the intestinal wall and liver prior to reaching the systemic circulation. 
TR-701/FA is inactive in most in vitro systems. Results where biological activity has been demonstrated are 
believed  to  be  due  to  formation  of  TR-700  within  the  test  systems.  Metabolism  of  TR-701  in  human  liver 
microsomes is limited to formation of TR-700. 
For the reasons described above, the assessment was focused on the active moiety, TR-700. 
Pharmacokinetics of TR-700 
The PK of TR-700 was similar following administration of either TR-701 or TR-701 FA. 
The mean TR-700 plasma concentrations and PK parameters in healthy adult subjects after single and multiple 
oral and IV doses are similar. Mean t ½ values ranged from 9 to 13 hour. 
Following multiple once-daily oral or IV administration, steady-state plasma concentrations are attained within 
3 days with modest drug accumulation (approximately 28%). Tedizolid exposure seems to be dose-proportional 
and not time-dependent. Steady state PK results are reasonably well predicted from single dose data. 
Absorption  
Following oral administration, peak plasma TR-700 concentrations are achieved within approximately 3 hours 
after dosing and the absolute bioavailability is 91%. Given the high value of absolute bioavailability no dosage 
adjustment is required between IV and oral administration. 
In vitro dissolution testing and in vivo absorption data shows that dissolution is not rate limiting to absorption. 
Since the tablet formulation was  used in all Phase  3 (and most Phase 1) studies, no bridging BE study was 
considered necessary. 
Oral TR-701 FA may be given without regard to timing of meals, as the total exposure [AUC0-∞] is unchanged 
between  fasted  or  fed  (high-fat,  high-calorie  meal)  conditions  (TR-701-103).  The  rate  of  absorption  was 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 37/110 
  
  
decreased  (Cmax  was  26%  lower  and  time  to  maximum  concentration  [t max]  was  6  hours  later),  but  these 
differences are not considered clinically meaningful given that the AUC/MIC is the critical factor for efficacy. 
Extrapolation of food-effect results to TR-701 tablet is acceptable given the rapid dissolution rate of tedizolid 
phosphate from both capsule and tablet formulations and the high oral bioavailability of tedizolid phosphate. 
Distribution 
Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that TR-700 rapidly distributes into tissues, with mean Vss values 
ranging from approximately 67 to 80 L after a single IV dose of 200 mg (TR701-107). TR-700 is moderately 
protein bound in human plasma (70% to 90%, primarily to albumin), and binding appears to be independent of 
concentration. 
TR-700 rapidly penetrated into the interstitial space fluid of adipose and skeletal muscle tissue, resulting in 
TR-700  exposures  in  these  compartments  that  were  similar to  free  drug  exposure  in  plasma  (TR-701-102). 
Furthermore,  TR-700  concentrates  highly  in  the  pulmonary  epithelial  lining  fluid  and  alveolar  macrophages 
(TR-107-119). 
Elimination (metabolism/excretion): 
The specific enzymes responsible for the metabolism of tedizolid phosphate to tedizolid, by dephosphorylation, 
and further metabolism of tedizolid to tedizolid sulfate, by sulfation, were further investigated by the applicant 
in order to identify the specific enzymes governing these metabolic steps together with their localisation and 
potential polymorphism. 
The metabolism of tedizolid phosphate (TP) to tedizolid is governed by phosphatases ubiquitously expressed 
both in the liver and intestine. Polymorphism of phosphatase enzymes is not known. 
An in vitro study of the specific sulfotransferase (SULT) enzymes involved in the metabolism of tedizolid was 
performed. Both recombinant SULT and pooled human liver and intestinal cytosol were incubated with tedizolid 
as well as positive and negative controls. All different human liver cytosol pools revealed a better (at least 2-fold 
higher) sulfonation activity of tedizolid in comparison to the human intestinal cytosol pool. Overall, both tissues 
liver  and  intestine  may  contribute  to  sulfonation  of  tedizolid  in  humans.  The  results  of  this  study  showed 
involvement of multiple SULTs (SULT1A1, SULT1A2, and SULT2A1) in the biotransformation of tedizolid which 
suggests that no single isozyme is critical to the clearance of tedizolid. 
The results from a single oral administration of 204 mg [14C]-TR-701 FA (containing 100 μCi [14C]-TR-701 FA) 
under fasted conditions (TR701-106) indicated that the majority of elimination occurs via the liver, with 81.5% 
of the radioactive dose recovered in feces and 18.0% in urine. TR-700 accounts for most if not all of circulating 
radiocarbon in plasma (95%), but is excreted in low levels in urine and faeces (≈3%). The majority of excreted 
radioactivity  was  identified  to  be  the  sulfate  conjugate  of  TR-700.  None  of  the  3  non-circulating  TR-700 
metabolites (desmethyl TR-700, TR-700 sulfate, and TR-700 carboxylate) has significant antimicrobial activity. 
Inter-subject variability (as determined by coefficient of variation for AUC in noncompartmental studies, or 
CL in the popPK analysis) ranged from approximately 20% to 30% across the studies and was generally higher 
following oral than IV administration, as expected. 
Intra-individual variability was not formally assessed in clinical studies, but is expected to be small based on 
the repeat measure data available (TR701-101, TR701-107, and TR701-114). PopPK analysis results regarding 
the drug variability are in agreement with this expected low intra-subject variability. 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 38/110 
  
  
The PopPK analysis estimated inter-individual variability in clearance (31 %CV) and volume of distribution (13.4 
%CV) to be small and indicated that relatively consistent PK will be observed across a wide range of patient 
intrinsic factors. Minor increases in clearance with increasing ideal body weight (IBW), decreases in clearance 
with increasing total bilirubin, and increases in volume of distribution with increasing IBW were noted in the 
population analysis. The effects of age, weight, BMI, sex, race, ethnicity, renal function, ALT, AST, and indirect 
bilirubin were not found to have statistically significant influences on ka, CL, or Vc. 
In the popPK analysis, the residual variability for the phase 2/3 data was found modest. Residual variability for 
the phase 1 data was also relatively small. 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  tedizolid  has  been  documented  in  subjects  with  severe  renal  impairment  with  or 
without haemodialysis, subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, elderly and adolescent subjects. 
No studies in children (<12 years old) were performed. Influence of other intrinsic factors (such as gender, race 
and  weight)  was  also  addressed  based  on  the  performed  clinical  studies  and  based  on  the  population  PK 
analysis. 
As a result of the minor variations in drug exposure, no dose adjustments from the proposed 200 mg once daily 
dosing regimen are considered necessary in any of these special populations. Given the PK/PD relationship for 
tedizolid, the CHMP agreed with this approach. The Sivextro SmPC is in accordance with this conclusion and no 
dose adjustment is recommended.  
The drug-drug interaction potential of tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid on CYP enzymes and transporters 
was  investigated in  a  number  of in  vitro  studies.  In vitro,  no  consistent  inhibition  of  important  drug  uptake 
(OAT1,  OAT3,  OATP1B3,  OCT1,  and  OCT2)  and  efflux  transporters  (P-gp  and  BCRP)  was  observed  with  the 
exception  of  BCRP  and  OATP1B1,  which  was  inhibited  by  tedizolid.  High  levels  of  tedizolid  phosphate in  the 
gastrointestinal tract following oral administration and conversion to tedizolid by phosphatase enzymes in the 
intestinal microvilli could result in interactions with other orally administered drugs that are substrates of BCRP 
(including methotrexate, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine and topotecan). The clinical relevance of this 
possible interaction is unknown, but cannot be excluded.  
Some  in  vitro  inhibitors  of  SULT  are  described  in  the  medical  literature,  such  as  non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs: mefenamic acid, etc.), oral contraceptives (19-norethindrone acetate, ethynodiol 
diacetate,  and  mifepristone,  17α-ethynylestradiol),  antiestrogens  (clomiphen),  antiandrogen  (cyproterone). 
However, whether these are active in vivo is at present unknown.  
As sulfotransferase substrates are sometimes inhibitors, it is reasonable to assume that in vitro inhibition of one 
or more SULTs by tedizolid may occur. Inhibition studies were not conducted and the applicant is encouraged to 
investigate whether tedizolid is an inhibitor of SULTs in vitro. 
Based on the positive in vitro results for CYP3A4 induction the applicant is also asked to perform an in vivo 
induction study as post-approval measure. As a first step of the measure, a suggested study setup to allow for 
an optimal capture of a potential CYP3A induction (e.g. based on the tedizolid half-life, and the turnover rate of 
CYP3A4, the maximum induction effect is reached after at least 10 days of  tedizolid treatment duration) should 
be submitted. The SmPC was updated until the final results of the study will be assessed.  
Two  in  vivo  DDI  studies,  investigating  the  PD  and  PK  drug-drug  or  drug-dietary  interactions  have  been 
submitted, pseudoephedrine (Study TR701-114) and dietary tyramine (Study TR701-105). No PK interaction 
was seen in these studies.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action  
TR700, as other oxazolidinone antibiotics, acts by inhibiting protein biosynthesis in the bacterial cell, by binding 
to  the  50S  ribosomal  subunit  and,  therefore,  prevent  the  formation  of  the  translation  initiation  complex  by 
blocking the combinations of the 50S and the 30S ribosomal subunits, resulting in lack of protein expression by 
the bacterial cell and, eventually, in cell death. A dose-dependent effect upon protein synthesis, consistent with 
the  proposed  mechanism  of  action  via  interaction  with  the  23S  rRNA  subunit  was  demonstrated  in  study 
PHA-08-070  1-034,  supporting  this  mode  of  action.  No  adverse  effects  were  seen  against  the  other  major 
synthetic pathways indicating that antibacterial activity is selectively due to this mechanism. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The applicant submitted the results of a comprehensive program to evaluate the potential for the development 
of resistant mutants, either to tedizolid or to linezolid, upon serial passages in culture medium. 
In  vitro  studies  demonstrated  a  relatively  low  potential  for  the  emergence  of  resistance  to  tedizolid  in 
staphylococci, enterococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci, which did generally not occur at concentrations at 
which resistance to linezolid has emerged. The potential for the emergence of resistance, however, might by 
higher for MRSA strains. Exposure of MRSA DR1 strain to either tedizolid or linezolid increased the MIC for the 
other oxazolidinone. The emergence of resistance was related to the G2576T mutation at the level of the gene 
encoding for 23S ribosomal subunit, a mutation that also conferred resistance to linezolid. Activity against SA 
strains  with  genetic  resistance  to  quinolones  (efflux  pump  genes  NorA  and  MepA),  VISA,  tetracyclines  and 
lincomycin was tested.  
The presence of NorA or MepA genes among S. aureus, related to the overexpression of the NorA efflux pump (S. 
aureus 4642) or the MepA efflux pump (S. aureus 4641) did not affect the in vitro activity of either oxazolidinone. 
Tedizolid and linezolid maintained activity against a homogenous vancomycin-intermediate strain of S. aureus 
(VISA) that also carried tetM, and was thus resistant to tetracycline as well as to fluoroquinolones. Both tedizolid 
and linezolid maintained activity against the evaluated Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates, 
which both possessed the lincomycin resistance gene lmrB. 
In summary, with regard to the studies with serial passage in culture medium, MICs for TR700 were generally 
lower than the MICs observed for linezolid for the key bacterial strains for the current application, with a low 
potential for the emergence of spontaneous resistance by serial passages in culture medium. An impact has 
been  observed,  however,  for  previous  exposure  to  either  oxazolidinone  in  S.aureus,  conferring  decreased 
susceptibility to the other compound in the group, and documentation of the emergence of specific mutants at 
the level of the 23S ribosomal subunit (G2576T). 
The in vitro activity of TR700 against S.aureus strains carrying the cfr gene, which confers resistance to linezolid, 
seems to have been retained, while the epidemiologic relevance of this potential advantage may be low. 
There was no sign of any microbial flora substitution after multiple IV or oral tedizolid phosphate doses of 200 
mg once daily over 7 days in Japanese healthy male subjects. This study was however small and only a low risk 
population for post-antibiotic gastro-intestinal complications including C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) 
was included. 
In vitro microbiology studies 
The in vitro spectrum and potency of TR700 against clinical isolates were determined in a variety of studies 
conducted during the preclinical and clinical development, including an extensive panel of key bacterial strains.  
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 40/110 
  
  
Microbiology susceptibility testing of the main target bacterial species have been obtained from profiling and 
surveillance studies including a large recent surveillance study conducted in the US and a similar surveillance 
study conducted in Europe. 
Overall,  as  expected,  the  microbiologic  activity  spectrum  of  TR700  was  largely  limited  to  Gram-positive 
organisms  and  overlapped  that  of  linezolid.  TR700  demonstrated  relevant  activity  against  staphylococci  (S. 
aureus, S. epidermidis, other coagulase-negative staphylococci), enterococci (E. faecium, E. faecalis and other 
enterococci),  streptococci  (S.  pyogenes,  S.  agalactiae,  Group  C/F/G  streptococci,  S.  anginosus  group 
streptococci, S. pneumoniae), Corynebacterium jeikeium, Listeria monocytogenes, some atypical respiratory 
pathogens (Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae), mycobacteria (Mycobacterium spp. including 
M. tuberculosis, M. avium, and M. kansasii), Nocardia brasiliensis, Gram-positive anaerobes (Clostridium spp. 
including C. difficile and C. perfringens, and Peptostreptococcus spp. including P. micros and P. anaerobius).  
TR700  was  only  moderately  active  (minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)  values  or  minimum  inhibitory 
concentration values against 90% of the isolates (MIC90) of 1 to 4 μg/mL) against the fastidious Gram-negative 
respiratory  pathogen  Moraxella  catarrhalis,  and  against  Neisseria  gonorrhoeae,  Chlamydophila  psittaci,  and 
Chlamydia trachomatis.  
TR700  was  inactive  (MIC90  values  ≥8  μg/mL)  against  Mycoplasma  pneumoniae  and  the  majority  of 
Haemophilus influenzae.

Microbiologic  activity  against  a  comprehensive  panel  of  different  relevant  MRSA  genotypes  associated  with 
either  community-acquired  (CA)  or  health-care  associated  (HA)  infections  (ST5-MRSA-II  (USA100), 
ST36-MRSA-II  (USA200/EMRSA16),    ST8-MRSA-IV  (USA300),    ST1-MRSA-IV  (USA400),    ST8-MRSA-IV 
(USA500)  -MRSA-IV (USA800),  ST22-MRSA-IV (EMRSA15),  ST80-MRSA-IV (European community associated),  
ST247-MRSA-I (Iberian clone),  ST239-MRSA-III (Brazilian clone)) was assessed and the results indicated that 
MIC90 values are consistently ≤ 0.5 mg/l for tedizolid, generally similar to MIC50 values, while MIC90 values are 
between 2-4 mg/l for linezolid. 
The data regarding different genotypes of MRSA may be considered particularly relevant for the procedure, as 
the added value of tedizolid may be along this specific activity profile. Overall, the panel may be regarded as 
comprehensive  and  reasonably  representative  of  the  most  relevant  epidemiologic  genotypes  described  in 
Europe and the observed MIC values may be considered consistent with the overall in vitro microbiologic activity 
described in the studies submitted by the applicant. 
The in vitro microbiologic activity of the main metabolites of tedizolid was adequately evaluated. Considering the 
trace  plasma  expression  of  the  identified  M1,  M2  and  M4  metabolites  and  the  shown  reduced  microbiologic 
activity, no clinical significant contribute to the compound’s primary effect is expected from these metabolites. 
For  tedizolid,  there  was  a  moderate  inoculum  effect  in  that  the  MICs  of  both  study  strains  increased 
approximately 4- to 8-fold over a range of inoculum density of 103 through 107 CFU/ml and 2-fold over a range 
of inoculum density of 104 through 105 CFU/ml. 
In study PHA-07-0701-061, a negligible post-antibiotic effect 0.05 to 0. 7 hours for staphylococci and of 0.15 to 
1.05 hours for enterococci has been observed, and it is unlikely that it may impact on the clinical outcome. 
Microbiology studies in the animal model 
The in vivo characterization of the microbiologic activity of tedizolid was evaluated in a series of comprehensive 
animal model studies. Throughout these studies: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the  protective  efficacy  of  TR701  against  staphylococcal  systemic  infections  in  mice,  namely  against 
infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, was shown; 
The efficacy against enterococcal systemic infections in immunocompromised mice was shown. 
The efficacy against systemic infections caused by S. pneumoniae was shown. 
The efficacy against MRSA infection in mouse SSTIs was shown. 
-  A series of well conducted published experiments evaluated the in vivo pharmacodynamics of TR701 against 
methicillin-susceptible  and  methicillin-resistant  S.  aureus  strains  in  a  mouse  thigh  infection  model.  The 
results have indicated  that the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 hours divided by the MIC 
(AUC/MIC ratio) was the PD index for TR701/TR700 that was linked with efficacy. The target total and free 
drug AUC/MIC ratios were calculated as 250 and approximately 50, respectively. 
-  A published study by Keel (Keel 2012) evaluated the efficacy of TR701 and linezolid against MSSA and MRSA 
pathogens in a mouse thigh infection model in order to establish the efficacy profile of the two drugs at 
plasma  exposures  simulating  those  associated  with  TR700  and  linezolid  administration  in  humans.  Four 
MRSA  strains  (3  hospital-associated  MRSA  [HA-MRSA]  including  one  vancomycin-resistant  [VRSA],  one 
CA-MRSA) and one MSSA strain were studied. MIC values ranged from 0.25 to 0.5μg/mL for TR700 and from 
2  to  4  μg/mL  for  linezolid.  The  results  of  the  pharmacokinetic  determinations indicated  that  the  dosage 
regimens for TR701 FA and linezolid in mice targeted exposures that approximated the intended human

fAUC0-24  values,  although  the  actual  fAUC0-24  values  from  the  study  were  low  for TR700  and  high  for 
linezolid. For TR700, the  actual fAUC0-24 was 2.99 μghr/mL (under the target of 5.2 μghr/mL) and for 
linezolid the actual fAUC0-24 was 144 μghr/mL (above the target of 96.6 μghr/mL). The human simulated 
regimens for TR700 and linezolid produced reductions against all isolates.  The human simulated regimen of 
TR700 exposure resulted in mean total drug AUC0-24/MIC ratios of 79.7 and 39.8 for isolates with MIC values 
of 0.25 μg/mL and 0.5 μg/mL, respectively. 
-  A  dose-dependent  response  to  TR701  treatment  was  observed  in  both  granulocytopenic  and 
nongranulocytopenic  mice.  In  granulocytopenic  mice,  stasis  was  achieved  at  human-equivalent  dose  of 
slightly less than 2300 mg/day at 24 hours, slightly less than 2100 mg/day at 48 hours and slightly less 
than  2000 mg/day  at  72 hours.  In  nongranulocytopenic  mice,  stasis  was  achieved  at  human-equivalent 
dose of slightly greater than 100 mg/day at 24 hours and less than 100 mg/day at 48 hours and 72 hours. 
These data suggest that the activity of tedizolid may be significantly reduced in the presence of neutropenia. 
In a study conducted in non-neutropenic animals, TR701 treatment of MRSA infection was administered at 
dosages to simulate achievable human plasma levels. The results of PK determinations indicated that the 
dose regimens for TR701 in mice resulted in exposures that approximated the intended human fAUC0-24 
values.  In  this  study,  the  effect  of  neutrophils  on  in  vivo  killing  by  TR701  was  investigated.  Massive 
amplification of bacterial cell kill was seen in the non-neutropenic mice; the MRSA kill mediated through 
granulocytes  enhanced  TR700  activity  by  a  factor  of  16-,  25-,  and  35-fold  (on  average,  25-fold)  for 
non-neutropenic versus neutropenic animals at the 24, 48 , and 72 hour time points, respectively (Drusano 
2011).  
The activity of tedizolid seems to be significantly dependent upon the neutrophil count, as the magnitude of the 
microbiologic  effect  was  greatly  amplified  in  the  presence  of  neutrophils  and  the  concentrations  needed  to 
achieve bacterial stasis in the neutropenic model were apparently not compatible with the expected AUC values 
estimated for the proposed dose for human studies. The CHMP requested the applicant to include a specific 
warning in the Sivextro SmPC regarding the neutropenic population. This was agreed upon by the applicant. 
The  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  relationship  against  staphylococci  was  tested  for  TR701  FA  in  a 
neutropenic mouse thigh model of systemic infection (which is predictive for human efficacy in ABSSSI) and 
determined that the 
AUC/MIC ratio explained more of the variance in the exposure-response relationship than 
did the other candidate pharmacodynamic indices (
Cmax/MIC and 
Time> MIC ratio, published data by Louie et 
al. already described above).  
f

f
The  fAUC/MIC  ratio  to  achieve  stasis  in  this  study  conducted  in  neutropenic  mice  was  ~50,  which  would 
correspond to a total AUC/MIC ratio of ~250 for protein binding of 80%.  
In  a  study  of  TR701  FA  in  neutropenic  versus  non-neutropenic  animals,  dose-response  enhancement  was 
approximately  16-,  25-,  and  35-fold  (on  average,  25-fold)  greater  for  non-neutropenic  versus  neutropenic 
animals  at  the  24-hour,  48-hour,  and  72-hour  time  points,  respectively.  Although  not  determined  in  the 
comparative  study,  adjusting  previously  obtained  fAUC/MIC  ratio  from  neutropenic  mice  by  the  most 
conservative enhancement factor of 16-fold at the 24 hour time point, the target fAUC/MIC ratio would be 3 
(based upon a total AUC/MIC ratio of 15 and 80% protein binding factor).  
Based on these assumptions, an estimated AUC value between 24 (single dose) and 26 (SS) µg*h/mL for the 
oral formulation, 200 mg, and 27 (single dose) and 29 (SS) µg*h/mL for the IV formulation, 200 mg, would be, 
in principle, acceptable for the treatment of bacterial phenotypes with MIC values up to 8 mg/l. This may be 
considered  adequate  for  the  treatment  of  most  target  bacterial  phenotypes  evaluated  within  the  in  vitro 
microbiologic efficacy program.

A published study characterized and compared the in vivo antimicrobial characteristics of TR700 and linezolid 
against  MSSA  and  MRSA  pathogens  in  a  neutropenic  mouse  pneumonia  model,  and  identified  by  PK/PD 
modeling  the  pharmacodynamic  target  value  (AUC/MIC)  for  each  compound.  The  mean  24 hour  total  drug 
AUC/MIC  values  associated  with  a  static  endpoint  were  133 and  27.2  for  TR700  and  linezolid,  respectively. 
When protein binding was considered, the mean fAUC/MIC values for TR700 and linezolid were similar at 20 and 
19, respectively. The mean 24 hour fAUC/MIC values associated with 1 log10 kill reduction were roughly 2-fold 
higher than that needed for stasis (34.6 for TR700 and 46.1 for linezolid). The plasma 24 hour fAUC/MIC values 
associated with net stasis and 1-log 10 kill were not, however, significantly different among the 4 MSSA strains 
and 7 MRSA strains tested. Overall, the results suggest similar antibacterial efficacy for TR701 and linezolid and 
support the proposed PK/PD target as the AUC/MIC ratio as proposed by Louie et al. 
Relation between plasma concentration and effect 
In the only clinical dose-response study in patients with cSSTI that received 200, 300 and 400 mg tedizolid 
phosphate for 5-7 days, there was no relationship found between the plasma concentration and efficacy. The 
dose range tested was however limited. The probability of TEAE increased with approximately 30% from the 
lowest to the highest dose. No trends were observed in this study in the relationships between neutrophil or 
platelet counts and exposure. It should however be noted that the study duration was only 5 to 7 days. 
The applicant has presented a rationale for the proposed MIC and zone diameter interpretive breakpoints and 
has approached EUCAST to set interpretive breakpoints for tedizolid in the EU. 
The final susceptibility testing breakpoints established by the EUCAST were:

Animal  model  PK/PD  data  demonstrated  that  fAUC/MIC  ratio  was  the  pharmacodynamic  parameter  best 
correlated  with  response.  The  fAUC/MIC  ratio  to  achieve  stasis  in  a  study  with  neutropenic  mice  was 
approximately 50, which would correspond to a total AUC/MIC ratio of approximately 250 for protein binding of 
80%. To achieve stasis in immunocompetent mice the target fAUC/MIC was at least 16-fold less and a fAUC/MIC 
target of 3 or AUC/MIC target of 15 (80% protein binding). 
Target attainment analysis was performed to estimate the probability of attaining the PK/PD target measure 
(AUC0-24/MIC  ratio)  associated  with  the  efficacy  of  tedizolid  phosphate  to  determine  MIC  susceptibility 
breakpoints. The majority of patients had an AUC/MIC above the target of 15 and there was no apparent drop 
in efficacy across a wide range of AUC/MIC ratios observed in studies TR701-112 and TR701-113 (see below 
figure).

The applicant submitted the results of an analysis of the correlation between MIC values and clinical outcomes, 
based on the outcomes of the clinical efficacy studies. A positive clinical response was observed for staphylococci, 
streptococci, and enterococci for MIC values up to 0.5, 0.25, and 0.5 μg/mL, respectively. Virtually identical 
results were observed for the favourable microbiologic outcome as for the clinical outcome. 
Virtually identical results were observed when analysing the favourable microbiologic response and the clinical 
outcome for zone diameter. 
In vivo studies to evaluate the potential for drug interactions 
The  potential  for  peripheral  inhibition  of  MAO-A  was  evaluated  using  tyramine  in  Study  TR701-105,  and 
pseudoephedrine in Study TR701-114.  
Tyramine  is  an  indirectly  acting  sympathomimetic  drug,  displacing  neurotransmitter  from  adrenergic  axonal 
terminals, resulting in an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) when administered intravenously and/or in 
the presence of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Co-administration of tyramine with MAOIs has been 
used to determine the potential for clinically significant drug interactions. In the performed study TR701-105, all 
subjects (24/24) receiving tedizolid phosphate had increases in SBP of ≥30 mmHg when co-administered with 
tyramine  (148-549  mg)  in  contrast  to  7  subjects  (7/24)  in  the  placebo  group  when  co-administered  with 
tyramine (249-549 mg).  
Of the 7 subjects who reached TYR30 in both treatment periods (PP analysis set), 1 subject had a tyramine 
sensitivity  factor  (TSF)  ≥2  which  is  considered  to  indicate  a  clinically  relevant  mean  difference  to  detect  a 
meaningful pharmacological effect. The geometric mean TSF value was 1.36 with a confidence interval between 
1.05 to 1.76.  
Study  TR701-114  was  performed  to  assess  if  tedizolid  phosphate  potentiates  the  pressor  response  to 
pseudoephedrine (PSE), a sympathomimetic drug. According to the applicant, the mean (SD) maximum change 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 46/110 
  
  
 
in SBP was 11.4 (5.55) mmHg with tedizolid phosphate and PSE and 12.3 (5.95) mmHg with placebo and PSE. 
Although in study TR701-114, the mean maximum change in SBP (measured at day 5, 3 hours after dose vs. 
predose at day 5) was 7.6 mmHg with tedizolid phosphate and PSE and 8.1 mmHg with placebo and PSE. In the 
study by Hendershot et al. (J Clin. Pharmacol. 2001;41:563-572), the mean maximum increase from baseline 
in SBP was 18 mmHg with pseudoephedrine (60 mg). In the same study SBP was reported to be 15 mmHg with 
the  co-administration  of  linezolid  with  placebo,  and  it  was  32  mmHg  with  co-administration  of  linezolid and 
pseudoephedrine.  
Overall, a potential peripheral inhibition of MAO-A cannot be excluded. At the request of CHMP, the applicant 
included an appropriate warning regarding monoamine oxidase inhibitors in SmPC section 4.4. 
With regard to the potential interaction with other antimicrobial agents that may be used concomitantly, and 
specifically  addressing  the  potential  for  synergy/antagonism  with  other  anti-infective  agents,  TR700 
demonstrated  no  interaction  when  assessed  in  combination  with  12  other  antibacterial  agents  against  the 
Gram-positive test strains of S. aureus, E.faecalis, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae. Against the Gram-negative 
organism E. coli, TR700 lacked inherent antibacterial activity, and yielded a result of no interaction when tested 
in combination with 8 gram-negative-active agents. Under the conditions of this study, TR700 in combination 
with other antibacterial agents does not result in antagonistic interactions.  
Also,  TR700  demonstrated  no  interaction  when  assessed  in  combination  with  high  concentrations  of  the  3 
antifungal agents, amphotericin B, terbinafine HCI, and ketoconazole, against the Gram-positive test strains of 
S.  aureus,  E.  faecalis,  S.  pyogenes,  and  S.  pneumoniae.  The  presence  of  these  agents  at  therapeutically 
relevant concentrations under clinical circumstances is therefore not expected to impair the antibacterial activity 
ofTR700 where the use of antibacterial and antifungal combination therapy is indicated.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Regarding pharmacokinetics, the expected tedizolid systemic exposure in adults is well supported by the PK 
studies submitted (including the population PK analysis). No significant differences are expected in any adult 
sub-population. The PK of tedizolid supports a once-daily administration regimen. In addition, the same dosing 
schedule can be used in all patient populations and in hepatic and renal impairment. 
The in vitro drug interaction programme submitted was nevertheless considered not complete. The presented in 
vitro data indicated that tedizolid may be a clinically relevant CYP3A4 inducer in vivo and therefore the applicant 
should investigate the CYP3A4 induction potential of tedizolid in an in vivo interaction study post-approval. An in 
vivo midazolam induction study should be performed as a MEA. As a first step, a suggested study setup to allow 
for optimal study setup to capture a potential CYP3A induction (e.g. based on the tedizolid half-life, and the 
turnover rate of CYP3A4, the maximum induction effect is reached after at least 10 days of  tedizolid treatment 
duration) should be submitted. 
Overall,  CHMP  concluded  that  the  clinical  PK  program  for  Sivextro  development  is  comprehensive  and  well 
conducted.  
The in vitro and in vivo microbiologic activity of TR700 were adequately evaluated with regard to the clinical 
efficacy program, and the results of the different studies and analyses are consistent with the expectation of an 
overall good activity against the key pathogens for the claimed indication. The activity against MRSA (and VRE) 
was overall good with MIC values that are compatible with the estimated concentrations that were achieved with 
the proposed 200 mg OD dose for TR700 in human PK studies. However, the potential for the emergence of 
resistance  may  be  higher  for  MRSA  than  for  MSSA  and  the  potential  for  cross  resistance  between  the  two 
Assessment report

oxazolidinones  may  be  significant.  The  studies  in  animal  infection  models  are  comprehensive  and  also 
demonstrated  good  overall  activity  in  the  models  that  may  be  considered  useful  for  the  indication.  The 
microbiologic activity in the animal model seemed to be significantly affected by the presence or absence of 
neutrophils, a finding that was further discussed by the applicant in the light of the need for specific warning in 
the neutropenic human population, which was included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Where the MIC values were considered, the activity of TR700, when compared to the activity of linezolid across 
in vitro and in vivo animal studies was generally superior for the relevant key pathogens.  
Animal PK/PD studies indicate that the AUC/MIC ratio may be the relevant PK/PD parameter for the prediction 
of clinical effect, and indicate that the PK values achieved with the 200 mg dose, either administered orally or IV, 
are  expected  to  achieve  AUC/MIC  values  consistent  with  adequate  clinical  response  for  the  key  pathogens. 
Therefore, the overall assessment of the PK/PD relationship gave reasonable confidence that the dose proposed 
for  human  studies  in  ABSSSI  would  show  clinical  meaningful  activity  against  key  pathogens,  while  it  would 
benefit from further exploring in clinical dose-ranging studies. 
Human pharmacodynamic studies relative to safety did not show the occurrence of neurologic events after a 10 
day exposure to the 200 mg dose intended for the clinical efficacy and safety program. 
The AUC/MIC ratio to achieve stasis in neutropenic mice was at least 16 times that of immunocompetent animals. 
The  applicant  explained  the  large  difference  in  the  PK/PD  target  in  neutropenic  mice  compared  to 
immunocompetent animals as a phenomenon which was not seen with other antibacterial agents. Additional 
data  from  other  animal  model  studies  were  provided,  in  which  tedizolid  and  linezolid  ED50  did  not  differ 
substantially in neutropenic animals, indicating that the effect seen with tedizolid may not only be applicable to 
tedizolid but also linezolid.  
Neutropenic patients were excluded from the pivotal trials. Information of lack of data in neutropenic patients is 
currently stated in section 4.4 of the SmPC. A potential peripheral inhibition of MAO-A cannot be excluded. The 
applicant included a warning regarding monoamine oxidase inhibitors in SmPC section 4.4.  
Regarding  pharmacodynamics,  the  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  microbiologic  activity  of  TR700  was  adequately 
evaluated with regard to the clinical efficacy program. The activity against MRSA (and VRE) was overall good 
with MIC values that are compatible with the estimated concentrations that were achieved with the proposed 
200 mg OD dose for TR700 in human PK studies.  
Where the MIC values were considered, the activity of TR700, when compared to the activity of linezolid across 
in vitro and in vivo animal studies was generally superior for the relevant key pathogens.  
Human pharmacodynamic studies relative to safety did not show the occurrence of neurologic events after a 10 
day exposure to the 200 mg dose intended for the clinical efficacy and safety program. 
The AUC/MIC ratio to achieve stasis in neutropenic mice was at least 16 times that of immunocompetent animals. 
The  large  difference  in  the  pharmacodynamic  target  in  neutropenic  mice  compared  to  immunocompetent 
animals is a phenomenon not seen with other antibacterial agents. However, the applicant has provided data 
from other animal model studies in which tedizolid and linezolid ED50 did not differ substantially in neutropenic 
animals indicating that the effect seen with tedizolid may not only be applicable to tedizolid but also linezolid. An 
extrapolation  of  animal  model  data  to  humans  raises  concerns  that  a  200  mg  once  daily  dose  of  tedizolid 
phosphate would be too low to achieve target attainment in a large number of neutropenic patients (with an 
AUC/MIC target of 250) provided that the PK is the same as in immunocompetent patients. This is in line with the 
fact that tedizolid is a bacteriostatic antibacterial. 
Assessment report

Based on the additional data provided by the applicant, the CHMP further discussed the importance of these 
experimental findings. As neutropenic patients were excluded from the pivotal trials, information of lack of data 
in  neutropenic  patients was  included  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC.  A  potential  peripheral  inhibition  of  MAO-A 
cannot be excluded and the applicant included an appropriate warning regarding monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
in SmPC section 4.4. Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In vitro data, animal model data and the outcome of clinical studies have shown that tedizolid phosphate exerts 
potent activity against the major pathogens causing ABSSSI. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The initially claimed indication for tedizolid was the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections in 
adults. The CHMP requested and the applicant has agreed that the indication “treatment of acute bacterial skin 
and skin structure infections” is more appropriate and should be used instead. 
Prior to the initiation of definitive safety and efficacy studies (phase 3), clinical studies were conducted using a 
disodium salt amorphous form of TR701.  Subsequently, a free acid crystalline form of TR701 (TR701 FA) was 
found  to  be  a  superior  drug  substance  as  it  is  a  stable,  non-hygroscopic,  crystalline  form.  TR701  FA 
demonstrated comparable bioavailability to TR701 (protocol TR701-108).  All subsequent studies including the 
two  Phase  III  studies  and  a  Phase  2  open-label  study  that  gathered  additional  safety  and  skin  lesion  size 
measurement data (TR701-126), have used TR701 FA which is the intended commercial drug product for both 
oral and IV administration in the treatment of cSSTI/ABSSSI and future clinical indications. 
In order to comply with  the EMA-CHMP recommended primary endpoint to establish efficacy, which was the 
test-of-cure assessment of the clinical response by the investigator at a post-therapy evaluation (PTE) as the 
primary endpoint, a hybrid approach was developed for the phase 3 studies, which meant that the studies were 
to be  powered appropriately for both the FDA and the EMA endpoints, and would collected data supporting 
registration in both regions, as suggested in the CHMP guidance (Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use:  Guideline  on  the  Evaluation  of  Medicinal  Products  Indicated  for  Treatment  of  Bacterial  Infections 
[CPMP/EWP/558/95  rev  2;  EMA  guidance  2011]).  The  resulting  proposed  endpoints  are  summarized  in  the 
following table:

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Two phase 2 studies were conducted:  
• 
• 
TR701-104, a multicentre, randomized, double-blind dose-ranging, non-comparative study evaluating 
the clinical and microbiological response, safety, and population PK in adult patients with cSSTI and 
TR701-126, a phase 2, open-label, multicentre study designed to further assess the safety of oral TR701 
FA 200 mg once daily for 6 days for the treatment of major cutaneous abscess or cellulitis/erysipelas 
(200 patients).   
The later study was conducted to assess the validity of the primary efficacy endpoint used by the FDA, for which 
various  lesion  area  measurement  methods  were  tested  and  the  reliability  of  measuring  the  lesion  area  was 
assessed using two different observers. 
Study  TR701-104 was the only formal dose-response study, which evaluated the effect of TR701FA for the 
treatment of a spectrum of skin and soft tissue infections in three groups of patients at three oral dose levels: 
200 mg (N=63), 300 mg (N=63) and 400 mg (N=62). The treatments were administered only by the oral route 
and the treatment duration was for at least 5 consecutive days, but no more than 7 days. No dose adjustments 
were allowed and the study which, as said, did not use a comparator. The schedule for the study visits was quite 
similar to the one chosen for the two main studies, as were the definitions for the ITT and PP population. The TOC 
visit was scheduled for 7-14 days post-treatment, as per the European guidance. The final disposition of enrolled 
Assessment report

subjects differed from the population enrolled in the two main studies with regard to the percentage of patients 
with  abscesses  at  baseline,  ranging  from  73%  to  79%  across  the  three  dose  groups,  outside  the  range 
recommended by European guidance (up to approximately 30% of the patients). Of note, the recommended 
range  was  subsequently  observed  in  studies  TR112  and  TR113.  Also,  the  remaining  infections  were 
deep/extensive wound infections, while the numbers were small across the three dose arms (15 for each arm). 
The large majority of the isolates were MRSA, in line with the type of lesions that were to be included. With 
regard to the baseline susceptibility to T-701, all strains had MICs ≤ 0.5 mg/ml with only 6/108 MRSA strains 
and 3/27 MSSA strains having MICs =0.5 mg/ml.  
A total of 152 (80.9%) patients had incision and drainage performed at the primary infection site between 2 
days  prior  to  treatment  through  7  days  after  the  initiation  of  treatment;  151  (80.3%)  had  the  procedure 
performed at baseline (Day -2 to Day 2). Incidence was similar across dose groups. 
The results from this dose-ranging study indicated that the clinical cure rates were uniformly high across all 3 
TR701 dose groups (200, 300, and 400 mg) at the TOC visit (98.2%, 94.4%, and 94.4% in the CE population; 
88.9%, 88.9%, and 85.5% in the cMITT population, respectively) and at the EOT visit (98.3%, 94.9%, and 
96.6% in the CE population; 93.7%, 90.5%, and 91.9% in the cMITT population, respectively).  
Microbiological  response  rates  based  on  a  satisfactory  response  (eradication  or  presumed  eradication)  were 
uniformly high across all three TR701 dose groups (200, 300, and 400 mg) at the TOC visit (100%, 93.2%, and 
100% in the ME population, respectively). No clinical relapse or microbiological recurrence was reported at the 
LFU visit in the cMITT, CE, or ME populations. 
Clinical cure rates were similar for subgroups based on baseline infection characteristics of lesion type (abscess, 
cellulitis, wound), lesion size, and when systemic signs of infection were present at baseline. Microbiological 
response  rates  in  patients  with  S.  aureus  isolated  at  baseline  (N=119,  ME  population)  was  97.5%. 
Microbiological success rate was 97.9% for patients with MRSA (92/94 patients) and 95.7% for patients with 
MSSA (22/23 patients). 
In the cMITT population, clinical cure rates at the TOC visit were similar between types of infection (abscess, 
cellulitis, and wound) and ranged from 81.8% to 90.9%. For each type of infection, no clinically meaningful 
differences were noted between dose groups. 
Analysis of efficacy results by lesion size and by baseline signs of infection were not suggestive of clinically 
significant differences between dose arms. At the TOC visit in the ME population, microbiological response for 
patients with S. aureus was satisfactory for 97.5% (116/133 patients) of patients and rates ranged from 91.7% 
to 100% across dose groups. For patients with MRSA or methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) pathogens, a 
satisfactory response was noted in 97.9% and 95.7% of patients, respectively, and differences between dose 
groups  were  not  clinically  meaningful.  For  patients  with  MRSA  or  MSSA  pathogens,  clinical  cure  rates  were 
96.8% and 95.7%, respectively. In the MITT population, 7 patients (3.7%) were assessed as clinical failures. 
The failures were identified in 1 patient with cellulitis (3% of those with cellulitis), in 1 with a wound infection 
(10% of those with wound infection), and in 5 patients with large abscesses (4% of those with large abscesses). 
No  clinical  relapse  or  microbiological  recurrence  was  reported  at  the  LFU  visit  in  the  cMITT,  CE,  or  ME 
populations. 
Therefore, efficacy and safety (see below, as the safety profiles were similar for the three doses) the results of 
this study support the choice of the 200 mg OD dose for a period of 5 to 7 days of treatment to be further 
developed in the main studies.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
The  Phase  3  studies  (TR701-112  and  TR701-113)  were  both  non-inferiority,  global,  multicentre, 
randomized, double-blind, double-dummy efficacy and safety studies in patients with ABSSSI.  
Study TR701-112: A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-Blind, Multicentre Study Comparing the Efficacy 
and Safety of 6-Day Oral TR-701 Free Acid and 10-Day Oral Linezolid for the Treatment of Acute 
Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Patients  were  required  to  have  cellulitis/erysipelas,  major  cutaneous  abscess  or  wound  infection  with  a 
minimum  total  lesion  surface  area  of  75  cm2  and  at  least  one  regional  or  systemic  sign  of  infection 
(lymphadenopathy, fever, >10% immature neutrophils, abnormal WBC count). 
Eligible subjects in study TR701-112 were randomised 1:1 to receive treatment with PO tedizolid phosphate 200 
mg once daily for 6 days or PO linezolid 600 mg every 12 h for 10 days Patients were to start treatment with at 
least 1 IV dose of tedizolid phosphate or 2 IV doses of linezolid before considering the option to switch to oral 
therapy. Switching from IV to oral study drug required that 2 of the 4 following criteria be met: 
- 
- 
The primary skin lesion has not increased in area, length, or width from baseline 
Temperature is <37.7°C at last measurement 
-  No local signs or symptoms of the primary ABSSSI site are worsening since previous visit 
- 
Improvement of at least 1 local sign or symptom of the primary ABSSSI site since previous visit 
Exclusion of entities like diabetic foot infection and infected burns were acceptable, as these often are associated 
with Gram-negative pathogens. 
Treatments 
Adjunctive  antibacterial  therapy  was  to  be  prohibited  in  both  studies  in  patients  with  cellulitis/erysipelas  or 
major cutaneous abscess. However, patients with wound infections could be treated with adjunctive aztreonam 
and/or metronidazole, if a Gram-negative pathogen was suspected (e.g. Gram stain) or confirmed by culture. A 
patient  with  a  wound  infection  found  to  have  a  gram-negative  pathogen  after  randomization,  but  no 
gram-positive pathogen, was to discontinue study drug and complete assessments for safety. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine the non-inferiority in the rate of the investigator’s assessment of clinical 
success of 6-day tedizolid phosphate oral compared with that of 10-day linezolid treatment oral at the PTE visit 
(7  to  14  days  after  the  EOT  visit)  in  the  Intent-to-Treat  (ITT)  and  Clinically  Evaluable  at  PTE  (CE-PTE) 
populations.  
The secondary efficacy objectives were as follows:  
- 
To  compare  the  per-patient  favourable  microbiological  response  rate  at  the  PTE  Visit  in  the 
microbiological ITT (MITT) and microbiologically evaluable (ME) analysis sets 
- 
To compare the Investigator’s assessment of clinical response at the 48-72 Hour, Day 7, and EOT Visits 
in the ITT and Clinically Evaluable at EOT (CE-EOT) analysis sets (for the EOT Visit only) 
Assessment report

- 
To compare the per-pathogen favourable microbiological response rates at the PTE Visit in the MITT and 
ME analysis sets 
- 
To compare the per-patient and per-pathogen favourable microbiological response rates at the EOT Visit 
in the MITT analysis set. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the investigator’s assessment of clinical success at the PTE visit in the 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and Clinically Evaluable at PTE (CE-PTE) populations. 
Clinical success was defined as a subject having (all of the following): 
-  Resolution or near resolution of most disease-specific signs and symptoms 
-  Absence or near resolution of systemic signs of infection (lymphadenopathy, fever, >10% immature 
neutrophils, abnormal WBC count), if present at baseline  
-  No new signs, symptoms, or complications attributable to the ABSSSI so no further antibiotic therapy is 
required for the treatment of the primary lesion 
Clinical failure was defined as a subject having (any of the following): 
-  Required additional antibiotic therapy for treatment of the primary lesion. 
-  Unplanned major surgical intervention (e.g., amputation) required due to failure of study drug  
-  Developed osteomyelitis after baseline 
- 
- 
Persistent Gram-positive pathogen bacteraemia 
TEAE led to discontinuation of study drug and patient required additional antibiotic therapy to treat the 
ABSSSI  
-  Death (all-cause mortality) within 28 days of first administration of study drug. 
Indeterminate was defined as a subject having study data not available for the evaluation of efficacy for any 
reason including: 
-  Osteomyelitis present at baseline; 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Lost to follow-up; 
Extenuating circumstances that precluded the classification of a clinical success or failure; 
For patients with cellulitis/erysipelas or major cutaneous abscess: Gram-negative organism isolated at 
baseline that required a different antibiotic therapy; 
For  patients  with  wound  infections:  Gram-negative  organism  isolated  at  baseline  that  required  a 
different antibiotic therapy other than aztreonam or metronidazole; 
Patient withdrew consent; 
Treatment change before completing at least 48 hours of study drug, excluding treatment-related AEs.

The  study  was  designed  to  show  non-inferiority  (NI)  in  the  primary  outcome  measure  after  initiation  of 
treatment of TR-701 FA 200 mg once daily × 6 days compared with linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours × 10 days 
in the ITT and CE-PTE analysis set. A NI margin of 10% was used based on analyses of historical data regarding 
the treatment effect of antibiotics as well as the contemporary data of the efficacy of linezolid. Approximately 
658 patients were to be randomized with 329 patients assigned to each treatment group.  
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomised 1:1 to receive treatment with PO tedizolid phosphate 200 mg once daily for 6 
days or PO linezolid 600 mg every 12 h for 10 days. A total of 667 patients were randomized; 332 to receive 
TR-701 FA and 335 to receive linezolid. 
Blinding (masking) 
This is a double-dummy study, with placebo unique to each active treatment (placebo for TR-701 FA and placebo 
for linezolid). 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  efficacy  outcome  was  analysed  by  determining  a  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  for  the 
observed difference in the sustained clinical response rate at the EOT Visit and the Investigator’s assessment of 
clinical success at the PTE Visit between the TR-701 FA group and the linezolid group. Safety analyses include 
summaries of treatment-emergent AEs, descriptive statistics of laboratory values, frequency distributions of 
laboratory values classified based on toxicity grades, descriptive statistics of vital signs and ECG parameters, 
and frequency distributions of abnormal physical examinations. 
Seven analysis sets were defined and are summarized in the table below: 
Table  4 
Analysis sets used 
Analysis Set 
Definitions 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT)  All randomized patients 
Safety Analysis Set 
All patients in the ITT Analysis Set who received at least 1 dose of drug during the study 
Microbiological ITT 
All ITT Analysis Set patients who had a baseline gram-positive bacterial pathogen known 
(MITT) 
to cause ABSSSI. This included bacterial pathogens known to cause ABSSSI identified in 
an appropriate specimen from the primary skin lesion or blood. 
Clinically Evaluable 
Three CE analysis sets are defined; the CE-EOT and the CE-PTE, used for the analysis of 
(CE): CE-EOT, 
the Investigators assessment of clinical response, and the CE-EOTSUS, used for the 
CE-PTE, and 
analysis of the programmatic determination of sustained clinical response. A separate 
CE-EOTSUS 
analysis set is required for the analysis of the programmatic determination of sustained 
clinical response since this outcome measure carries forward failures from the 48-72 
Hour Visit (early clinical response) whereas this is not the case for the Investigator’s 
assessment of clinical response at EOT. 
All patients in the ITT Analysis Set who complied with the protocol with no major 
violations, as defined in the SAP, and who meet the following criteria: 
To be included in the CE-EOT Analysis Set, patients must also have met the following

criteria: 
Completed the Investigator’s assessment of clinical response (i.e., was not deemed an 
indeterminate outcome) at the EOT Visit 
The EOT Visit occurred on Day 11 (+2 days) or within 2 days of the last dose of study 
drug 
To be included in the CE-PTE Analysis Set, patients must also have meet the following 
criteria: 
Completed the Investigator’s assessment of clinical response (ie, was not deemed an 
indeterminate outcome) at the PTE Visit, unless the patient was classified as a clinical 
failure at the EOT Visit 
The PTE Visit occurred 7 to 14 days after the EOT Visit, unless the patient was considered 
to be a clinical failure based on the Investigator’s assessment at the EOT Visit. If the 
patient did not have an EOT Visit, the PTE Visit must occur within 7 to 14 days of Day 11 
(the protocol specified time point for the EOT Visit) 
To be included in the CE-EOTSUS Analysis Set, patients must also have meet the 
following criteria: 
Completed the outcome assessment at the 48-72 Hour Visit, unless the patient was a 
failure (for programmatic determination of sustained clinical response) at the EOT Visit 
Completed the sustained clinical response outcome assessment at the EOT Visit (i.e., 
was not programmatically determined to be an indeterminate response), unless defined 
as a non-responder at the 48-72 Hour Visit 
The 48-72 Hour Visit occurred no later than 72 hours (i.e., <73 hours) after the first dose 
of study drug and the EOT Visit occurred on Day 11 (+2 days) or within 2 days after the 
last dose of study drug unless the patient was defined as a non-responder (for the 
programmatic determination of early clinical response) or a failure (for the programmatic 
determination of sustained clinical response). Patients who are defined as a failure for 
the programmatic determination of sustained clinical response at EOT will be included in 
the CE analysis set if the EOT Visit is within 7 days of the allowable window (Day 11 [+2 
days] or within 2 days after the last dose of study drug)

Methods 
Study Participants  
In this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre, global phase 3 study, adults with ABSSSI were 
randomized 1:1 to receive IV to oral TR-701 FA 200 mg once daily for 6 days OR IV to oral linezolid 600 mg every 
12 hours for 10 days. Randomization was to be stratified by geographic region  and clinical syndrome (major 
cutaneous abscess [maximum of 30% of the study population, of which not more than approximately half were 
to  originate  from  the  North  American  study  population],  cellulitis/erysipelas,  and  wound  infection).  Patients 
were to start treatment with at least 2 IV doses of study drug; patients could have received IV therapy for the 
entire treatment duration.  
Subjects could then be switched from IV to oral study drug provided 2 of the 4 following criteria were met: 
• The primary skin lesion had not increased in area, length, or width from baseline 
• Temperature was <37.7°C at last measurement 
• No local signs or symptoms of the primary ABSSSI site worsened since previous visit 
• Improvement of at least 1 local sign or symptom of the primary ABSSSI site since previous visit 
Patients  with  cellulitis/erysipelas  or  major  cutaneous  abscess  caused  by  Gram-negative  pathogens  were 
excluded from enrolment.  
Treatments 
Adjunctive antibacterial therapy was prohibited in patients with cellulitis/erysipelas or major cutaneous abscess. 
Adjunctive aztreonam and/or metronidazole could have been initiated in patients with wound infection provided 
a gram-negative pathogen was suspected or confirmed. The study drug was discontinued in patients later found 
to have a Gram-negative pathogen, but no Gram-positive pathogen. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to determine the non-inferiority in the rate of the investigator’s assessment of clinical 
success rate of intravenous (IV) to oral 6-day TR-701 free acid (FA) compared with that of 10-day linezolid 
treatment (IV to oral) at the PTE Visit (7 to 14 days after the EOT Visit) in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and Clinically 
Evaluable at PTE (CE-PTE) populations.  
The secondary objectives were as follows: 
The secondary efficacy objectives were as follows:  
- 
To  compare  the  per-patient  favourable  microbiological  response  rate  at  the  PTE  visit  in  the 
microbiological ITT (MITT) and microbiologically evaluable (ME) analysis sets 
- 
To compare the Investigator’s assessment of clinical response at the 48-72 Hour, Day 7, and EOT visits 
in the ITT and clinically evaluable at EOT (CE-EOT) analysis sets (for the EOT visit only) 
- 
To compare the per-pathogen favourable microbiological response rates at the PTE visit in the MITT and 
ME analysis sets 
- 
To compare the per-patient and per-pathogen favourable microbiological response rates at the EOT visit 
in the MITT analysis set.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the Investigator’s assessment of clinical success at the PTE Visit in the 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and Clinically Evaluable at PTE (CE-PTE) populations. 
Sample size 
The study was designed to show NI in the primary outcome measure after initiation of treatment of TR-701 FA 
200 mg once daily × 6 days compared with linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours × 10 days in the ITT and CE-PTE 
analysis set. A NI margin of 10% was used based on analyses of historical data regarding the treatment effect 
of antibiotics as well as the contemporary data of the efficacy of linezolid. Approximately 658 patients were to be 
randomized with 329 patients assigned to each treatment group.  
Randomisation 
In this randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre, global Phase 3 study, adults with ABSSSI were 
randomized 1:1 to receive IV to oral TR-701 FA 200 mg once daily for 6 days OR IV to oral linezolid 600 mg every 
12  hours  for  10  days.  Randomization  was  stratified  by  geographic  region  and  clinical  syndrome  (major 
cutaneous abscess [maximum of 30% of the study population, of which not more than approximately half were 
to originate from the North American study population], cellulitis/erysipelas, and wound infection). A total of 
666 patients were randomized; 332 to receive TR-701 FA and 334 to receive linezolid. 
Blinding (masking) 
A double-dummy approach was chosen with placebo unique to each active treatment (placebo for TR-701 FA 
and placebo for linezolid for both IV and oral formulations) to maintain the treatment blind. 
Statistical methods 
The  primary  efficacy  outcome  was  analysed  by  determining  a  2-sided  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  for  the 
observed difference in the sustained clinical response rate at the EOT Visit and the Investigator’s assessment of 
clinical success at the PTE Visit between the TR-701 FA group and the linezolid group. Safety analyses include 
summaries of treatment-emergent AEs, descriptive statistics of laboratory values, frequency distributions of 
laboratory values classified based on toxicity grades, descriptive statistics of vital signs and ECG parameters, 
and frequency distributions of abnormal physical examinations. 
Main efficacy results  
In the two pivotal trials, approximately 90% of patients completed the study. In study TR701-112 there were 
some  imbalances  in  the  reasons  for  discontinuing  the  study  drug  (treatment  failure  and  Gram-negative 
infection),  disfavouring  the  linezolid  group.  In  study  TR701-113,  some  of  the  imbalances  in  the  reasons 
(treatment  failure)  for  discontinuing  the  study  drug  were  disfavouring  the  tedizolid  phosphate  group,  while 
others (several subjects randomized but not receiving the study drug) were disfavouring the linezolid group. 
Other reasons for subjects either prematurely discontinued from the studies or discontinued study drug were 
relatively well balanced across treatment groups within each study. The subject disposition and the reasons for 
discontinuation are depicted in the below tables for study TR701-112 and TR701-113, respectively.

Demographics and baseline characteristics 
The treatment groups within each study were generally well matched with respect to gender, age, age group, 
ethnicity,  race,  BMI  and  type  of  cSSTI  (see  tables  below).  The  majority  of  patients  included  were  men. 
Approximately 10% of the subjects were >65 years of age. The majority of patients were recruited in North 
America.  One  out  of  six  and  one  out  of  three  patients  were  recruited  in  Europe  in  study  TR701-112  and 
TR701-113,  respectively.  The  most  common  type  of  infection  was  cellulitis/erysipelas.  The  proportion  of 
patients enrolled with major cutaneous abscess did not exceed 30%, which was a pre-specified limit and in line 
with the current CHMP guidance. The number of patients with diabetes mellitus was 26 in each treatment group 
in  study  TR701-112  and  32  and  41  in  the  tedizolid  phosphate  and  linezolid  groups,  respectively,  in  study 
TR701-113.

The cSSTI medical history in the two controlled studies was generally similar, although the current or recent IV 
drug  use  was  more  common  in  TR701-112  (approximately  35%-39%)  than  TR701-113  (approximately 
20%-22%). Additionally, higher proportions of patients had recent trauma that resulted in primary infection and 
fever in  study  TR701-113 than TR701-112 (recent trauma that resulted in primary infection: approximately 
45% in TR701-113 and 33% in TR701-112; fever: approximately 47% in TR701-113 and approximately 19% in 
TR701-112). In study TR701-113, fever was more common in patients who were maintained on IV treatment 
(82.2% TR701/FA and 89.7% for linezolid) than for those who switched from IV to oral (40.4% and 36.8%, 
respectively). A medical history of recent trauma that resulted in the primary infection was also more common 
in patients who were maintained on IV treatment (62.5% TR701/FA and 63.8% for linezolid) than for those who 
switched from IV to oral (40.1% and 41.6%, respectively). 
In the Phase 3 Controlled Studies Group in the TR701/FA and linezolid groups, 45.3% versus 45.9% of patients 
had  cellulitis/erysipelas,  25.3%  versus  24.8%  had  major  cutaneous  abscess,  and  29.4%  versus  29.3%  had 
wound infection, respectively. Lymphadenopathy was reported in 73.0% of patients in the Phase 2 Uncontrolled 
Studies Group, and in 78.9% and 78.3% of patients in the TR701/FA and linezolid groups, respectively, in the 
Phase 3 Controlled Studies Group.  
Fever (temperature ≥38°C) was reported in only 4.1% of patients in the Phase 2 Uncontrolled Studies Group, 
whereas  in  the  Phase  3  Controlled  Studies  Group,  23.3%  of  patients  who  received  TR701/FA  and  23.5%  of 
patients who received linezolid had fever at baseline. Also, whereas the baseline characteristics of local disease 
indicated that approximately half of the patients had moderate or severe erythema and/or induration, higher 
proportions  of  patients  maintained  on  IV  treatment  had  severe  signs  and  symptoms  (erythema,  swelling, 
warmth, tenderness on palpitation and purulent discharge) compared with those who were switched from IV to 
oral.  Cellulitis/erysipelas  was  reported  in  approximately  45%  of  patients,  infected  wound  was  reported  in 
approximately 30% of patients, and major cutaneous abscess was reported in approximately 25% of patients. 
The median cSSTI surface area was larger and the number of patients with an increase or decrease of WBC 
count, having immature neutrophils or presenting with fever was higher in the IV to oral study, reflecting that 
infections were more severe in this study. The proportion of subjects meeting SIRS criteria was also higher in the 
IV to oral study. The proportion of patients meeting SIRS criteria in study TR701-112 was 19.0% vs. 12.8% and 
in study TR701-113 30.1% vs. 25.4% for tedizolid phosphate and linezolid groups, respectively.

Table   10 
Baseline regional and systemic signs and symptoms of infection in study TR701-113 
(ITT Analysis Set) 
In patients with a positive culture  at baseline (MITT set), S aureus was identified in 81.0% of patients  who 
received TR701/FA (374 baseline isolates across the two main studies) and 83.0% of patients who received 
linezolid (342 baseline isolates), with MRSA accounting for 34.7% and 35.4% of infections in the TR701/FA and 
linezolid groups, respectively, and MSSA accounting for 46.3% and 48.1% of infections, respectively. However, 
the baseline distribution of staphylococcal genotypes was different,  as almost all MRSA strains were observed 
in the US. This is not unexpected, considering the usually described EU epidemiology in this regard.  
The distribution of pathogens isolated from the primary site of infection is summarized in the below tables:

The reasons for exclusion from the analysis sets were generally well balanced between treatment groups. In 
study TR701-113 there were 7 subjects that were randomized to receive linezolid but did not receive study drug.

EMA/83337/2015

Study drug exposure and concomitant procedures 
In  both  studies  fewer  subjects  received  a  full  course  of  linezolid than  tedizolid  phosphate.  Subjects  were  to 
receive  a  minimum  of  at  least  5  doses  of  tedizolid  phosphate  or  10  doses  of  linezolid  to  be  included  as  an 
“evaluable success” in the CE analysis sets resulting in a possible comparison of 5-6 days vs. 5-10 days and not 
6 vs. 10 days of tedizolid phosphate vs. linezolid, respectively. 
In the IV to oral study (TR701-113), the majority of patients received only 1 IV dose of tedizolid phosphate and 
2 IV doses of linezolid. The pharmacokinetics of IV and oral tedizolid phosphate in healthy subjects indicates 
however that extrapolation of efficacy data of oral to IV tedizolid phosphate is possible. 
There were no meaningful differences in site procedures and care between study groups

The results are quite similar for both studies within the pre-specified limit for non-inferiority for linezolid. Also, 
they are reasonably within the expectable values for the efficacy outcomes of linezolid in other studies in SSTI 
which used a similar mode of administration and duration of treatment. 
The main reasons for clinical failure (rates of 4.5% for ITT, as 9.9% of patients had an indeterminate response, 
and 5.4% for CE-PTE, for study TR112; and 6.6%, with 5.4% IR at ITT and 7.6% for CE-PTE analysis, for study 
TR113) for the primary endpoint, were due to additional antibiotic therapy for primary lesion. However, the use 
of antibiotic within the previous 7 days had neither a significant impact on the efficacy rates for the primary 
endpoint when assessed in the ITT population, nor on the response rate for the primary endpoint was also not 
affected by such variables as lesion size, presence of fever or bacteraemic status for any of the two studies. 
The results of the Investigator assessment of clinical success at the PTE Visit in the MITT and ME Analysis Set 
have shown success for 86.2% in the TR-701/FA group and 87.4% in the linezolid group for the MITT Analysis 
Set,  and  94.4%  and  97.9%, respectively,  for  the  ME  Analysis  Set  in  the  Phase  3  Controlled  Studies  Group. 
For both analysis sets, the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than -10%.

In studies TR112 and TR113, the results for the main efficacy endpoint were subject to a sensitivity analysis, 
unadjusted for the stratification factors of presence/absence of fever at baseline and clinical syndrome. This 
sensitivity analysis has confirmed the results of the primary analysis. 
The  secondary  efficacy  analyses  included  the  more  relevant  microbiology  analyses  for  this  procedure.  The

With regard to the clinical evolution, the results of the assessment of the intensity of pain, as measured by the 
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the Face Rating Scale (FRS) scales at different time-points after the treatment 
had been started, were plotted against lesion area, as a % of baseline area, and a good linear correlation was 
observed, thus supporting the consistency of the clinical assessments. 
With regard to the clinical evolution of the response at the PTE, resolution of all signs and symptoms was seen 
in 72.9% of TR-701/FA patients and 71.4% of linezolid patients, compared to resolution rates of 43.5% and

47.1%, respectively, at the EOT Visit.  The sample size of patients in the Phase 3 Controlled Studies Group with 
fever at baseline was small, and for the majority, the fever had resolved by Day 2. 
Regarding the microbiologic results of the studies, the overall response rate was considered good for the isolated 
key pathogens, although a better response was observed for MSSA than for MRSA with regard to either tedizolid 
or linezolid, as shown below. Very few isolates were Enterococcus faecalis, while no E. faecium was isolated in 
either group at baseline. The response of E. faecalis to tedizolid was slightly lower than for linezolid, while the 
involved numbers are low:

For the ME analysis set, the investigator assessment of clinical success by key target pathogen from the primary 
infection site or blood cultures showed a similar clinical success rate for all key pathogens in both treatment 
groups in Studies TR701-104, TR701-112 and TR701-113, and most patients in both groups were considered a 
clinical success at the PTE Visit.  Greater than 95% of patients in both groups were considered a clinical success 
for the most common pathogen reported at baseline, Staphylococcus aureus.  Similar rates of clinical success 
were  seen  with  linezolid  treatment  and  TR-701/FA  treatment  for  the  Streptococcus  anginosus-milleri  group 
(95.0% versus 95.8%, respectively).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Subgroup analyses showed that, overall, the rates of clinical response across subgroups (age, sex, race, BMI 
group, geographic region, clinical syndrome, in IV drug users, in patients with diabetes, NSAID/oral steroid use, 
bacteraemia, baseline lesion area group, anatomical location of infection, lesion area and infection type) were 
high (generally >80%) in patients who received TR-701/FA, and no significant differences in response rate were 
observed for age, sex or race. Subjects with a BMI of <30 kg/m2 had higher percentage of clinical success with 
any treatment than those with BMIs of >30 kg/m2 or >35 kg/m2 (clinical success from All Studies:  95.0%, 
91.1%  and  84.7%,  respectively).  Only  27  subjects  across  the  two  main  studies  had  bacteraemia,  and  a 
Assessment report

favourable result is reported for 24 of these subjects. For diabetic patients, a lower response rate was observed 
for TR701, while the number of included subjects is small and inconclusive. 
Supportive studies 
The phase 2 study TR107-104 was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging, non-comparative 
study evaluating the clinical and microbiological response, safety, and population PK of the disodium salt of 
tedizolid phosphate for 5 to 7 days in adult patients with cSSTI. A total of 188 cSSTI patients received tedizolid 
phosphate orally at doses of 200, 300, or 400 mg per day. Clinical cure rates were uniformly high across all 3 
tedizolid dose groups (200, 300, and 400 mg per day) at 7 to 14 days post treatment (98.2%, 94.4%, and 
94.4% in the CE population; 88.9%, 88.9%, and 85.5% in the cMITT population, respectively). Microbiological 
response rates were uniformly high across all 3 tedizolid phosphate dose groups. Thus, all tested doses showed 
similar efficacy and these results were supportive for the 6 days duration of therapy and for the selection of the 
200 mg dose in the phase 3 pivotal studies.  
Study TR701-126 was a phase 2, open-label, multicentre trial primarily designed to assess the safety of oral 
tedizolid phosphate 200 mg once daily for 6 days for the treatment of 100 patients each suffering from major 
cutaneous abscess or cellulitis/erysipelas. The cure rate was similar across subgroups defined by infection type 
(85.0% vs. 91.0% at the EOT visit and 83.0 vs. 90.0% at the PTE visit in patients with cellulitis/erysipelas and 
major cutaneous abscess, respectively). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Compliance of study designs with European regulatory guidance 
The  overall  design  of  the  studies  is  considered  acceptable,  as  the  included  types  of  infections  were 
cellulitis/erysipelas and wound infections and that major abscesses did not represent more than 30 % of the 
cases. A minimum affected area was well defined and the estimated size of abscesses was pre-defined. A set of 
signs  and  symptoms  associated  with  the  ongoing  acute  infection  was  defined  in  the  protocol,  while  not  all 
enrolled patients complied with this requirement. Exclusions included patients with burns, infected diabetic foot 
ulcers and local complications such as osteo-articular or necrotizing infections. 
The established non-inferiority margin (-10%) and the primary endpoint (clinical outcome measured at the TOC 
visit) were both in accordance with the EU guidance recommendations. 
The choice of the comparator, linezolid at the recommended dose of 600 mg BID for 10 days, with the possibility 
of  IV  to  oral  switch  in  study  TR113,  was  not  thoroughly  discussed,  since  while  linezolid  is  an  accepted 
antibacterial for the treatment of cSSTI, the current wording of the linezolid approved indication states that the 
treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections should be made only when microbiologic testing has 
established  that  the  infection  is  caused  by  susceptible  Gram-positive  bacteria.  This  is  justified  by  the 
antibacterial  spectrum  of  linezolid,  which  is  largely  shared  by  tedizolid.  CHMP  included  a  warning  on  the 
antibacterial spectrum of tedizolid in section 4.4. of the SmPC. 
Efforts were made to adequately characterize the severity of the infections, both by establishing a minimum 
area of involved skin structures by erythema, induration and fluctuation and by creating a set of clinical criteria 
that would indicate the presence of acute infection and inflammation (local or regional lymphadenitis, fever, 
leucocytosis). Overall, the predefined criteria for disease severity were met in a significant proportion of the 
included  subjects,  so  that  the  relevance  of  antibiotic  treatment,  either  orally  or  IV,  could  be  considered 
acceptable  at  the  proposed  experimental  conditions  for  both  main  studies.  Adjuvant  treatment,  either 
non-programmed drainage of abscesses and antibiotic use were to be considered as failures. 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 80/110 
  
  
The populations defined for the major efficacy analyses are well described and allow for the evaluation of the 
predefined endpoints. The visit for the evaluation of the EU primary endpoint (TOC visit, alias post-treatment 
evaluation, PTE) was scheduled at 7-14 days after the final dose had been administered, in accordance with the 
EU guidance. The studies were also powered for an early efficacy endpoint, as per the US guidance requirements 
(either clinical response, in TR112, or early assessment of at least a 20% reduction in lesion area, in TR113) and 
this allowed for an additional perspective on the clinical outcome. The two pivotal studies are in line with EU 
guidance with regard to the geographic distribution of the included patients and include a significant proportion 
of European patients.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  efficacy  of  tedizolid  phosphate  was  evaluated  in  two  randomized,  double  blind,  double  dummy, 
non-inferiority studies in patients with ABSSSI. Oral and IV to oral tedizolid phosphate 200 mg once daily for 6 
days was compared with linezolid 600 mg twice daily for 10 days. Even though a beta-lactam regimen would be 
considered first-line treatment in many cases of cSSTI/ABSSSI, the use of linezolid as comparator is considered 
adequate by the CHMP, considered the high number of MRSA included. A shorter course of tedizolid phosphate 
than linezolid was chosen, based on the efficacy results of tedizolid phosphate generated in the phase 2 studies. 
As  the  recommended  duration  of  treatment  of  cSSTI  with  linezolid  is  10  to  14  days,  the  use  of  10  days  of 
linezolid in the clinical trials is considered acceptable.  
Adults and adolescents (the latter included in the IV to oral study), with suspected or documented gram-positive 
ABSSSI(cellulitis/erysipelas,  major  cutaneous  abscess  (not  more  than  30%)  or  wound  infection)  with  a 
minimum surface area of  75cm2 and  at least one regional or systemic sign of infection were included.  Thus 
patients without systemic signs of infection could be included. There were no specific severity criteria indicating 
the necessity of IV antibiotic therapy in the IV to oral study. The co-primary endpoints were the investigator´s 
assessment  of  clinical  response  at  PTE  in  the  ITT  and  CE-PTE  analysis  sets,  which  are  in  line  with  CHMP 
guidance. 
Non-inferiority  of  tedizolid  phosphate  to  linezolid  was  to  be  shown  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  for  the 
difference in the ITT and CE-PTE analysis sets exceeded -10%, which is also in line with the CHMP guidance for 
cSSTI studies. 
Approximately 90% of the patients completed the studies. In study TR701-113 seven patients were randomized 
but did not receive linezolid, disfavouring this group. The information provided by the applicant on the reasons 
for this imbalance was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The treatment groups within each study were well matched with respect to gender, age, age group, ethnicity, 
race, BMI and type of cSSTI. The majority of patients included were men. Approximately 10% of the subjects 
were >65 years of age. The majority of patients were recruited in North America. One out of six and one out of 
three patients were recruited in Europe in study TR701-112 and TR701-113, respectively. The most common 
type of infection was cellulitis/erysipelas. The proportion of patients enrolled with major cutaneous abscess did 
not exceed 30% which was the pre-specified limit and in line with current CHMP guidance. 
The  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced  with  respect  to  criteria  for  disease  severity  (local,  regional  and 
systemic signs and symptoms of infection).  The most commonly isolated pathogen was  S. aureus, of  which 
approximately 40% consisted of MRSA, followed by S. pyogenes and species in the S. anginosus-milleri group. 
The numbers of S. pyogenes was unexpectedly low.  
In  both  studies  fewer  subjects  received  a  full  course  of  linezolid than  tedizolid  phosphate.  Subjects  were  to 
receive  a  minimum  of  at  least  5  doses  of  tedizolid  phosphate  or  10  doses  of  linezolid  to  be  included  as  an

“evaluable success” in the CE analysis sets resulting in a comparison of 5-6 days vs. 5-10 days and not 6 vs. 10 
days of tedizolid phosphate vs. linezolid, respectively. In the IV to oral study, the majority of patients received 
only 1 IV dose of tedizolid phosphate and 2 doses of linezolid. The efficacy results from study TR701-113 is 
therefore almost exclusively based on oral tedizolid phosphate.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Non-inferiority of tedizolid phosphate compared to linezolid was demonstrated for the co-primary endpoints in 
both pivotal studies. The lower limits of the 95% CIs were within -10%. Results for the sensitivity analyses 
(unadjusted) of the primary efficacy outcome supported the results seen for the primary analyses. 
It  should  be  noted  that  at  all  time  points  from  EOT  to  late  follow-up  the  point  estimates  for  success  were 
generally lower for tedizolid phosphate and 7/8 failure or relapses at late follow-up were noted. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The comparative clinical efficacy of tedizolid administered either at 200 mg orally or with initial IV administration 
at the same dose, and subsequent switch to oral, for 6 days, with linezolid, at 600 mg BID, either orally or with 
initial IV administration and subsequent switch to oral, for 10 days, was evaluated for the treatment of ABSSSI 
in two well designed and well conducted studies. These studies included an adequate number of adult patients 
with skin infections caused by key bacterial pathogens, mainly Staphylococcus aureus, either MSSA or MRSA, 
but also by streptococci. 
The  results  of  each  of  the  studies  –which  used  an  accepted  EMA/CHMP  endpoint-  were  consistent  with  the 
predefined criteria for showing that the treatment with 200 mg tedizolid daily for 6 days was non-inferior to the 
treatment  with  linezolid  at  600  mg  BID  for  10  days.  The  results  were  within  the  expected  efficacy  rate  for 
linezolid in these situations. A slightly lower response rate was overall detected for tedizolid when MRSA was the 
baseline isolated pathogen. The efficacy results for the subgroup of patients initially treated with IV tedizolid, in 
whom the signs of systemic inflammation were generally more frequent, were similar to the overall result with 
PO administration. Infections caused by enterococci were rare across the two main studies. 
Administration of tedizolid in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected Gram-positive bacterial infection is 
unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria. 
TR-701 FA is not active against Gram-negative bacteria.  To date, there is no known cross resistance between 
TR-701  FA  and  other  classes  of  antibiotics.    The  most  commonly  observed  mutations  in  staphylococci  and 
enterococci that result in drug resistance in the clinic with the oxazolidinone, linezolid, are in one or more copies 
of the 23S rRNA genes (G2576U and G2500A).  The 4- to 16-fold increased potency of tedizolid versus linezolid 
is maintained against strains harbouring these mutations.  
CHMP agreed that the available clinical data are sufficient to conclude that oral and IV formulation of tedizolid 
phosphate exerts a similar clinical efficacy as that of linezolid in patients with cSSTI caused by Gram-positive 
bacteria. Despite the fact that for tedizolid powder for concentrate for solution for infusion the applicant initially 
proposed pack sizes of 1 and 10 vials, the CHMP supported the revised pack sizes of 1 and 6 vials as they are 
more consistent with the posology of the product. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 82/110 
  
  
 
In total, the safety of tedizolid phosphate has been evaluated in 1488 subjects (1050 patients in the phase 2 and 
phase 3 studies and 438 subjects in the phase 1 studies) including both oral and IV administration routes. Of the 
1488 subjects, 1050 were patients and 438 were healthy subjects. 
A total number of 969 patients completed the phase 2 and 3 studies and received ≥200 mg, and of these 623 
patients were exposed to ≥ 5 doses of 200 mg which roughly corresponds to the recommended dosage (200 mg 
once daily for 6 days).  
The majority of the patients were treated orally. IV dosing of tedizolid phosphate was included in one phase 3 
study, i.e. TR701-113, in which 331 patients were treated with ≥ 1 IV dose.  
At the request of CHMP, the applicant has presented separate tabulations to enable a comparison of the safety 
profile  after  “oral”,  “IV-to-oral”  and  “IV-only”  dosing,  respectively,  in  line  with  the  recommendation  in  the 
guidance  document  “Guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products  indicated  for  treatment  of  bacterial 
infections” (CPMP/EWP/558/95 rev 2).  
In the TR701-113 study the predominant treatment regimen was a single IV dose followed by 5 oral doses and 
the majority of the subjects are included in the “IV-to-oral” subgroup (N=267). In the “IV-to-oral” subgroup, 
120 subjects received ≥ 2 IV doses and 64 subjects received ≥ 3 IV doses. In addition, there were 64 subjects 
who only received IV doses (“IV-only” group) ≥1 IV doses and among these subjects 54 received ≥ 6 IV doses. 
Overall, the number of patients exposed to tedizolid phosphate at the recommended dosage was considered 
sufficient by CHMP. 
The majority of the subjects in the clinical development program were white men between 18-65 years. Only 81 
patients were aged 65 years or more, and only one subject was aged below 18 years. There was  no major 
difference in the demographic characteristics between the tedizolid phosphate and the comparator (linezolid) 
group. A number of medications were prohibited by protocol; among these were selective serotonin re-uptake 
inhibitors [SSRI], serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, MAOI, triptans, and 
other medications with potential adrenergic or serotonergic activity. 
Approximately 90% of the subjects completed the studies. In the phase 3 studies, approximately 7 to 9 % of 
subjects  discontinued  during  the  blinded  treatment  phase,  across  tedizolid  phosphate  and  comparator 
treatment groups. There was no major difference between tedizolid phosphate and the comparator. 
Adverse events 
Overall, the incidence and severity of AEs reported for tedizolid was not high, indicating that the safety profile of 
tedizolid with the chosen short term treatment course (6 days) at the dose of 200 mg OD may be considered 
favourable. 
In the phase 3 controlled studies group, the incidence of AEs, TEAEs, severe TEAEs, and serious TEAEs were 
similar for the TR701 FA and the linezolid treatment groups, with 42.7% and 43.2% of patients, respectively, 
experiencing at least 1 TEAE.  Treatment-related TEAEs were less frequent in the TR701 FA group than in the 
linezolid  group  (22.4%  versus  27.9%,  respectively).  Early  discontinuation  of  study  drug  for  a  TEAE  was 
infrequent in either group, with 2 patients (0.3%) in the TR701 FA group and 5 (0.8%) in the linezolid group.  
Two patients in the TR701 FA group and 1 patient in the linezolid group had TEAEs resulting in death (see below 
for the assessment of relatedness). 
Adverse  events  most  commonly  involved  the  SOCs  of  gastrointestinal  (GI),  infections  and  infestations,  and 
nervous system disorders. The incidence in the GI disorders SOC was lower in the TR701 FA group (16.0%) 
compared with the linezolid group (23.0%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 83/110 
  
  
The most common TEAEs by preferred term (reported by at least 2% of patients) in the TR701 FA group were 
nausea, headache, abscess, diarrhoea, vomiting, and cellulitis. The profile and incidence of TEAEs was similar in 
the linezolid group although it was noted that nausea and vomiting were reported at lower incidences in the 
TR701 FA group than in the linezolid group (nausea: 8.2% versus 12.2%, and vomiting: 2.9% versus 5.6%); 
additionally dizziness was reported by 1.8% in the TR701 FA group and 2.1% in the linezolid group. 
Out of the patients experiencing a TEAE, the majority experienced events with a maximum severity of  mild 
(195/283  [68.9%]  TR701  FA  group  and  193/286  [67.5%]  linezolid  group);  the  incidences  of  patients  with 
moderate or severe events were also similar across the groups (moderate:  75/283 [26.5%] TR701 FA group, 
80/286 [28.0%] linezolid group; and severe: 13/283 [4.6%], 13/286 [4.5%], respectively). 
In the phase 2 uncontrolled studies group, the incidence of TEAEs was greater (57.0%) than for the TR701 FA 
treatment group in the Phase 3 controlled studies group (42.7%) as was the incidence of related TEAEs (36.9% 
versus 22.4%); this is considered due to the higher incidence of TEAEs obtained with the higher doses (300 mg 
and 400 mg) used in the TR701-104 study. 
The incidence of severe TEAEs and serious TEAEs were similar for the TR701 FA treatment group and for the 
comparator group in the phase 3 controlled studies group. Early discontinuation of study drug for a TEAE was 
infrequent with 2 patients (0.5%) affected. There were no TEAEs resulting in death in the phase 2 studies.

1 TEAE.  Treatment-related TEAEs were less frequent in the TR701 FA group than in the placebo group (33.3% 
versus 36.8%, respectively). Early discontinuation of study drug for a TEAE was similar in both groups (3.4% in 
the TR701 FA group and 2.3% in the placebo group).  No patients had TEAEs resulting in death in the phase 1 
studies group.

The most frequently reported TEAEs considered to be related to the study compound, all with < 10% frequency, 
were nausea, headache, dizziness and abscess. Nausea, the most frequently individually reported TEAE, was 
less frequently reported for tedizolid than for linezolid in both phase 3 studies. Abscesses were reported similarly 
for the study compound and the comparator in phase 3 studies, whereas slightly less frequently for linezolid. 
Dizziness, fatigue and pruritus generalized were reported by between 1-2% of patients in the TR701 FA and 
linezolid groups.  
SAEs were reported, overall, for approximately 2% of the patients across treatment groups in the phase 2 and 
3 studies. 
IV and oral dosing 
At the CHMP request, the applicant has presented separate tabulations to enable a comparison of the safety 
profile  after  “oral”,  “IV-to-oral”  and  “IV-only”  dosing,  respectively,  in  line  with  the  recommendation  in  the 
guidance  document  “Guideline  on  the  evaluation  of  medicinal  products  indicated  for  treatment  of  bacterial 
infections” (CPMP/EWP/558/95 rev 2).

 N=Number of patients in the Safety Analysis Set.   n= Number of patients in the specified category.

In  general  there  are  no  major  differences  between  in  incidences  of  TEAEs  between  the  oral,  IV-to-oral  and 
IV-only administration routes.  Although the incidence of fatigue was increased (9.4%) in the IV-only group in 
comparison to the other groups, oral and IV-to oral groups. 
Taken  together  the  data  at  hand  do  not  indicate  different  safety  profiles  after oral and  IV  administration  of 
tedizolid phosphate.  
To  conclude  the  overall  number  of  patients  exposed  to  tedizolid  phosphate  at  the  recommended  dosage  is 
considered sufficient. The safety profile after oral and IV dosing seems comparable.  “Prolonged use >7 days” is 
included in the RMP as missing information, which is considered sufficient. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the pool of all phase 2/3 studies, a total of 2 (0.2%) deaths were reported in the tedizolid phosphate group 
compared with 1 (0.2%) deaths in the all comparator groups.  The two deaths occurring in tedizolid phosphate 
group were due to myocardial infarction and septic shock, respectively. The third death, in the linezolid group, 
was due to TB (tuberculosis) meningitis. The three deaths seemed therefore unrelated to the study treatment. 
In the phase 3 controlled studies group, the overall incidence of SAEs was similar between groups (12 patients, 
1.8% in the TR701 FA group and 13, 2.0% in the linezolid group). SAEs most commonly affected the Infections 
and Infestations SOC (0.9% in TR701 FA and 0.6% in linezolid).  The majority of SAEs were singular events; 
however, in the TR701 FA group 2 patients experienced pneumonia and 2 experienced septic shock.

In the phase 2 uncontrolled studies group, 7 (1.8%) of patients experienced 1 or more SAEs; these included 2 
patients with abscess.  The only SAEs in common between patients treated with TR701/FA in phase 2 and phase 
3 studies were abscess and staphylococcal infection. 
Events of special interest 
Myelosuppression 
The  mean  values  of  haematology  parameters  evaluated  for  both  tedizolid  phosphate  and  the  comparator 
linezolid remained generally stable over the course of the studies (change from baseline to worst value) with the 
exception of leukocytes which decreased over time as expected with response to treatment of an infection, in 
both  treatment  groups.  The  substantially  abnormal  decrease  in  values  observed  for  leucocytes  was 
approximately 0.4% for both tedizolid phosphate as well as for the comparator linezolid.

The applicant states regarding the haematology results that in the phase 3 controlled studies group, decreases 
of ≥2 toxicity grades from baseline were noted in 65/583 (11.1%) of tedizolid phosphate patients and in 45/581 
(7.7%) of linezolid patients.  
The  incidence  of  substantially  abnormal  absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC),  haemoglobin  values,  and  platelet 
counts in the phase 3 controlled studies group are roughly similar between the tedizolid phosphate and linezolid 
treatment groups.

Although, a slight trend for a higher incidence of substantially abnormal platelet counts is seen in the linezolid 
group (4.5% vs 2.1% for tedizolid phosphate).  The use of the comparator regimen linezolid is associated with 
anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.

Laboratory  events  were  rare  and  unremarkable.  Laboratory  events  of  interest  are  those  related  to  the 
haematology count. A small number of shifts from baseline to worst post-baseline in haemoglobin values (1.0%), 
leukocytes (2.6%) and platelets (1.4%), were reported in phase III studies, whereas the interpretation of these 
shifts is difficult as they might have reflected improvement in inflammatory response. 
In a phase 1 study in healthy subjects (TR701-101), subjects received oral 200, 300, or 400 mg once-daily 
TR701 or 600 mg twice-daily linezolid or placebo for 21 days (N=8 per group).  A trend toward decline over time 
was noted for platelet, red blood cell (RBC), and ANC counts at the highest dose of TR701 (400 mg) and in the 
linezolid  group.    Overall,  hematologic  effects  over  the  21-day  administration  period  were  unremarkable  for 
subjects receiving 200 mg TR701 once daily but were more pronounced as the dose increased.   
Overall, the haematology results seem quite similar for tedizolid phosphate (200 mg/day) and linezolid (1200 
mg/day). Therefore, evidence that exposure to tedizolid may be associated with bone marrow supression was 
observed. The clinical relevance of these findings, which are also expected for linezolid, may be mitigated by the 
short  term  treatment  course  that  is  proposed.  Thus,  a  warning  was  included  in  section  4.4  regarding 
myelosuppression (see SmPC).  An adequate warning regarding the possibility to exceed the 6 days treatment 
course is included in the SmPC. 
Lactic acidosis 
Tedizolid phosphate inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis. Lactic acid levels were not affected over the 21-day 
period of drug administration in a phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (Study TR701-101).  Lactic acidosis has 
not been reported in patients treated with tedizolid phosphate at the recommended treatment duration of 6 days. 
The  applicant  was  requested  by  CHMP  and  has  subsequently  included  a  warning  on  lactic  acidosis  in  SmPC 
section 4.4. 
Peripheral neuropathy and optic nerve disorders 
From  the  published  clinical  and  post-marketing  experience,  AEs  associated  with  linezolid,  particularly  for 
prolonged  treatment  exposures  >28  days,  include  optic  and  peripheral  neuropathy.  Two  phase  1  studies, 
TR-701-101  (part  B)  and  TR-701-110,  included  ophthalmologic  (including  optic  neuropathy)  and  neurologic 
(including peripheral neuropathy) examinations. In study TR-701-101 (part B, N=8/group, tedizolid phosphate 
and  linezolid  dosed  up  to  21  days),  no  difference  was  observed  between  tedizolid  phosphate  and  linezolid 
treated subjects in the small group of subjects studied. In the tedizolid exposed group ocular hyperaemia and 
blurred vision was reported as TEAEs. In study TR-701-110 (200 mg tedizolid phosphate dosed up to 10 days), 
only dry eyes and blurred vision was reported.  
There was  no difference between tedizolid phosphate and linezolid with regard to the standardized MedDRA 
queries (SMQ) results for peripheral neuropathy and optic nerve disorders in the phase 3 study group.

The  applicant  has  provided  the  requested  review  of  all  the  cases  of  peripheral  neuropathy  and  optic  nerve 
disorders  (identified  by  standardized  MedDRA  queries  (SMQ)  for  peripheral  neuropathy  and  optic  nerve 
disorders) in the complete safety database (1, 2 and 3 studies). Twenty-two subjects who received at least 1 
dose  of  tedizolid  phosphate  in  the  complete  safety  database  experienced  TEAEs  within  the  peripheral 
neuropathy SMQ, compared to 11 subjects in the control groups (placebo 6, linezolid 5 subjects). Overall, there 
was no difference between tedizolid phosphate, placebo, and linezolid with regard to the standardized MedDRA 
queries (SMQ) results for peripheral neuropathy disorders.  
Optic Nerve Disorders 
In the phase 3 controlled studies group, 2 (0.3%) patients in the TR701 FA group and 1 (0.2%) patient in the 
linezolid group experienced at least 1 TEAE identified by the optic nerve disorder SMQ (see below table)  The 
incidence of events was low and the  small numbers  preclude comparison by TEAE.  Most events  were mild, 
generally transient, with spontaneous resolution.

In  the  phase 1  studies  group,  the  incidence  of  optic  and  peripheral  neurologic  TEAEs  was  low  and  similar 
between the TR701/FA group and the placebo group, suggesting that events seen were unlikely to be related to 
TR701/FA (neurologic TEAEs: 2.3% in the TR701/FA group versus 4.5% in the placebo group and optic/eye 
disorders: 0.2% and 0.8%, respectively. 
Overall, there was no difference of TEAEs between tedizolid phosphate and linezolid in the performed clinical 
program with a maximum duration of treatment of 6 days for tedizolid phosphate and 10 days for linezolid. Optic 
and peripheral neuropathy has mainly been observed in patients treated with linezolid for a longer duration time 
than the approved duration of 28 days. Peripheral and optic nerve toxicity has been included as an important 
potential risk in the RMP for tedizolid phosphate which is endorsed.  Thus, a relevant precautionary statement in 
SmPC section 4.4 was requested by the CHMP and was included by the applicant. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In the phase 2 and 3 study pool the related TEAEs indicating potential allergic reactions seem roughly similar 
between the tedizolid phosphate and linezolid groups. In the phase 2 and 3 study pool there was one serious 
adverse event, anaphylactic reaction in the linezolid group. Two cases lead to permanent discontinuation, i.e., 
drug hypersensitivity (tedizolid phosphate arm) and anaphylactic reaction (linezolid arm).  In line with request 
for  clarification  of  the  safety  profile  the  applicant  provided  a  specific  MedDRA  query  for  potential  allergic 
reactions. The available data did not indicate different safety profiles after oral and IV administration of tedizolid 
phosphate.  
Cardiac and Vascular Disorders 
Blood pressure increased was reported as a TEAE for 2 patients (0.3%) each in TR-701 FA and linezolid groups 
in the Phase 3 Controlled Studies Group.  Hypertension was reported as a TEAE for 5 patients (0.8%) in the 
TR-701 FA group and 2 patients (0.3%) in the linezolid group; 1 patient (0.2%) in the TR-701 FA group had a 
TEAE  of  essential  hypertension.    Incidence  of  hypotension  was  lower;  1  patient  in  each  treatment  group 
experienced hypotension. Potentially clinically significant high or low SBP abnormalities occurred in ≤0.6% of 
patients  in  either  treatment  group  when  SBP  was  measured  at  the  48-72 hours  or  EOT  Visits.    Potentially 
clinically significant high abnormal values in SBP at any time postbaseline were observed in 1.2% of patients in 
the  TR701  FA  group  and  0.6%  of  the  linezolid  group,  and  low  value  abnormalities  in  0.2%  and  1.2%, 
respectively. Similarly, PCS high or low DBP readings were observed for ≤0.8% of patients in either treatment 
group at the 48-72 hour or EOT Visits.  At any time after beginning study drug, abnormally high DBP values were 
recorded in 2.4% of patients in the TR701 FA group and 1.7% of the linezolid group, and low value abnormalities

in 1.1% and 1.4%, respectively.  In the phase 2 and 3 study pool, mean changes of systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure was minimally affected (< 1 mm Hg). In the Phase 3 study pool, mean reduction from baseline to end 
of  treatment  of  heart  rate  was  4.9  beats/min  and  2.1  beats/min  for  tedizolid  phosphate  and  linezolid, 
respectively.  In  the  Phase  3  Controlled  Studies  Group,  mean  values  for  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  and 
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were similar at the 48-72 hour and EOT Visits for the TR701 FA and linezolid 
treatment groups.  Mean greatest increases in SBP were +11.0 mmHg with TR701 FA and +9.5 mmHg with 
linezolid,  and  mean  largest  decreases  were  −9.5 mmHg  and  −10.9 mmHg,  respectively.    For  DBP,  mean 
greatest  increases  were  +8.2 mmHg  (TR701  FA)  and  +7.6 mmHg  (linezolid);  corresponding  mean  largest 
decreases from baseline were −7.6 mmHg and −7.7 mmHg, respectively. 
In Phase 3 studies, TEAEs of tachycardia were reported for 2 patients in the TR-701 FA group and 4 patients in 
the linezolid group.  Only 1 TEAE of bradycardia was reported; this occurred in a patient receiving TR-701 FA. 
Similarly, mean heart rate were similar between the 2 treatment groups at 48-72 hour and EOT visits.  The mean 
greatest increase in heart rate from baseline to any postbaseline was 7.0 bpm for TR701 FA and 7.6 bpm for 
linezolid and corresponding mean largest decreases were −12.1 bpm and −10.4 bpm, respectively.  Potentially 
clinically significant heart rate abnormalities were infrequent in both treatment groups at the 48-72 hour and 
EOT Visits (<1%).  At any postbaseline measurement, 1.4% of patients in the TR701 FA group and 1.2% in the 
linezolid group had high heart rates and 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively, had low heart rates considered to be of 
potential clinical significance. 
Overall in the complete clinical safety pool, 9 unique patients in the TR-701 FA group and 15 unique patients in 
the linezolid group had 1  or more postbaseline QTcB or QTcF value >500 msec or >60 msec increase from 
baseline,  although  1  and  4  patients,  respectively,  had  QTcB  >500  msec  at  baseline  also.    In  the  Phase  3 
Controlled Studies Group, 6 patients (0.9%) in the TR701 FA group and 10 subjects (1.6%) in the linezolid group 
had  QTcB >500 msec  for  at  least  1  evaluation  after  the  first  dose  of  study  drug,  or  double  the  number  at 
baseline  in  both  groups.  Increases  in  QTcB  >60  msec  from  baseline  to  the  worst  post-baseline  result  were 
infrequent; 6 patients (0.9%) in the TR701 FA group and 4 patients (0.6%) in the linezolid group had such 
increases in QTcB.  Increases of 30 to 60 msec were more frequent in the linezolid group (15.2%) than the 
TR701 FA  group  (8.9%).  Potentially  clinically  significant  abnormal  QTcF  post-baseline  high  values  were  less 
frequent; 1 patient (0.2%) in the TR701 FA group and 1 patient (0.2%) in the linezolid group had QTcF >500 
msec, compared with 1 and 2 patients, respectively, at baseline.  No patients in either treatment group had QTcF 
values  <350  msec  after  beginning  treatment,  but  1  patient  in  the  TR701  FA  group  had  a  PCS  low  value  at 
baseline.    Increases  >60 msec  in  QTcF  from  baseline  to  any  post-baseline  evaluation  were  also  infrequent, 
occurring in 2 (0.3%) and 4 (0.6%) patients in TR701 FA and linezolid groups, respectively; increases of 30 to 
60 msec were also balanced (13.1% and 13.6%). The overall blood pressure and heart rate and ECG results  for 
the  comparative  phase  3  studies  appear  similar  for  tedizolid  phosphate  (200  mg/day)  and  linezolid  (1200 
mg/day).  
Therefore, individual values > 500 msec or changes from baseline of > 60 msec, for QTc, generally considered 
of high risk for torsade des pointes, although infrequent, were observed throughout the two main studies in 
patients  exposed  to  tedizolid,  while  eventually  less  frequently  with  linezolid.  Nevertheless,  based  on  the 
additional  information  provided  by  the  applicant  (narratives  for  the  relevant  cases)  during  the  assessment, 
CHMP was reassured that clinically relevant QTc interval prolongation was unlikely with tedizolid treatment. 
The cardiac safety and thorough QTc study TR701-115 evaluated tedizolid phosphate for the potential for QT 
interval  prolongation  in  healthy  subjects  using  a  Holter  monitor  for  continuous  ECG  recording.  TR-701 FA 
administered in single doses of 200 mg or 1200 mg did not prolong the QT interval relative to placebo when

evaluated by time-matched or time-averaged QTcF values; the positive control, moxifloxacin, confirmed assay 
sensitivity. 
Additional Cardiovascular Safety Studies 
The potential of tedizolid to induce an increased sensitivity to tyramine was considered lower than for linezolid 
in direct comparison, but these findings not only do not exclude but also indicate that this potential may have 
clinical  impact.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  discuss  this  potential  impact  with  special  regard  to  the  IV 
administration and consider the need for  further  warnings regarding this issue in the  SmPC.  In its provided 
responses,  the  applicant  provided  a  justification  that  it  was  expected  that  the  proposed  short  term-use  of 
tedizolid will not have a significant impact on individual tyramine sensitivity.  This was considered sufficient by 
the CHMP. 
Venous tolerability 
The  venous  tolerability  of  tedizolid  was  explored  in  a  crossover  study  in  adult  healthy  volunteers  and  was 
unremarkable. In Phase III study TR113, infusion-site events of dermatitis, erythema, extravasation, induration, 
oedema,  pain,  phlebitis,  urticaria,  hematoma,  and  vessel  puncture  site  pain  were  reported  as  TEAEs.  The 
incidence of any specific TEAE was <1% in each group. 
Laboratory findings 
Overall, the use of tedizolid phosphate is associated with a low incidence of elevated hepatic enzymes ALT, AST 
and alkaline phosphatase which is similar to what is observed for the comparator linezolid. The potential for 
inducing severe liver injury seems to be low although one case of Hy's law occurred in a linezolid treated patient 
in the clinical program. 
Safety in special populations 
Within patient subgroups defined by intrinsic factors the incidence of any 1 or more TEAEs was similar between 
TR701 FA and linezolid treatment groups. The safety results from the Phase I PK studies in special populations, 
including  in  voluntary  subjects  with  renal  disease,  hepatic  disease  and  aged  >  65  years,  did  not  show  an 
increase in the frequency or pattern of events in comparison with a reference safety population. In patients ≥65 
years of age, the incidence of severe TEAEs or SAEs increased with age in the TR701 FA treatment group; SAEs 
were reported for 1.0% of patients <65 years, 8.3% of patients ≥65 years, and 16.7% of patients ≥75 years.  
Two SAEs resulted in death; both were patients ≥75 years in the TR701 FA group. Both deaths were already 
discussed and are considered to be unrelated to the exposure to the compound. A slightly greater proportion of 
females experienced TEAEs than males. Similarly, the incidence of SAEs was higher among female patients than 
male patients whether receiving TR701 FA or linezolid. The incidence of TEAEs was similar for obese (43.5%) 
and normal/overweight (43.1%; BMI of 25 to <30 kg/m2) subgroups of the TR701 FA treatment group, but was 
greater  among  obese  patients  than  normal/overweight  patients  in  the  linezolid  group  (48.5%  and  40.1%, 
respectively). The most common TEAEs for both subgroups in each treatment group were in the SOCs of GI 
Disorders, Infections and Infestations, and Nervous Disorders. The most common TEAEs for both subgroups in 
each treatment group were in the SOCs of GI Disorders, Infections and Infestations, and Nervous Disorders. 
A population  PK  analysis  of  patients  in  the  Phase  3  Controlled  Studies  Group  found  no exposure  differences 
between obese (≥30 kg/m2) and all other patients. Only a few patients with renal impairment were exposed in 
clinical trials. Nearly 30% of patients in the Phase 3 Controlled Studies Group had hepatic disease, defined by 
positive hepatitis C results or baseline ALT or AST >2× ULN. Hepatic impairment characterized by a Child-Pugh 
classification of B or C was much less common (approximately 2% of the population). No notable differences in 
terms of the pattern or incidence of AEs were observed in patients with hepatic disease. Approximately 10% of 
Assessment report

Page 99/110 
  
  
patients in the Phase 3 Controlled Studies Group had diabetes. Apart from a slight overall increase in TEAEs no 
notable change in pattern was observed.  
An  integrated  population  PK  analysis  of  phase 1,  phase 2,  and  phase 3  studies  was  performed 
(CLN-13-0701-072).  In  the  population  PK  analysis,  ideal  body  weight  was  found  to  be  the  most  important 
covariate for explaining observed variability, but predicted changes were relatively modest at the extremes of 
body size (<40% change from 5th to 95th percentile of ideal body weight).  No other demographic or clinical 
covariates that were assessed which included sex, race, ethnicity, age, weight, BMI, creatinine clearance, ALT, 
AST, and bilirubin were associated with meaningful changes in PK. 
Extrinsic factors studied were geographic region and IV drug use. The Phase 3 Studies were conducted in the US, 
Canada,  Europe,  South  America,  Australia,  New Zealand,  and South  Africa.    The  occurrence  of  cSSTIs  is 
relatively common among IV drug users and this subgroup was of sufficient size (29% of patients in the Phase 
3 Safety Analysis Set) to compare safety in users to nonusers. 
Use in pregnancy, which occurred in only a trace proportion of exposed patients, and during lactation are the 
object of adequate warnings in the SmPC and PL. 
The paediatric program is ongoing, while the use in this population is adequately managed in the SmPC. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The  PK  interactions  are  discussed  in  the  pharmacokinetic  section.  There  are  some  raised  OC  regarding  PK 
interactions  and  clinically  relevant  drug  interactions  by  tedizolid  phosphate  at  intestinal  CYP3A4  cannot  be 
excluded at the moment.  
Tedizolid phosphate is a weak nonselective reversible MAO inhibitor when assayed in vitro with endogenous or 
expressed human MAO-A or MAO-B. 
The  use  of  certain  medications  (selective  serotonin  re-uptake  inhibitors  [SSRI],  serotonin  norepinephrine 
reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, MAOI, triptans, and other medications with potential adrenergic or 
serotonergic activity) was prohibited in the protocol.  A few patients in the Safety Analysis Set from Phase 2/3 
studies, although, received these medications. However, no conclusion can be drawn from the safety data since 
data is scarce. The potential for peripheral inhibition of MAOA was evaluated using tyramine in study TR701-105, 
and  pseudoephedrine  in  study  TR701-114.  No  meaningful  changes  in  blood  pressure,  heart  rate  with 
pseudoephedrine  were  observed  in  the  healthy  volunteers,  and  no  clinically  relevant  increase  in  tyramine 
sensitivity were observed. However,. a potential peripheral inhibition of MAOA cannot be excluded based on the 
limited clinical experience to date..  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The  overall  discontinuation  rate  in  the  tedizolid  phosphate  group  in  phase  3  studies  is  very  low,  0.5%,  and 
mostly concerned the GI SOC which is not unexpected considering that class of the substance and further that 
the majority of the subjects were treated orally.  
The discontinuation rate was slightly higher in the phase 1 studies pool, 3.2 % vs 2.3% in the placebo group. In 
particular  events  leading  to  discontinuation  were  mostly  in  the  General  Disorders  and  Administrative  Site 
Conditions  SOC,  and  was  related  the  infusion  site  TEAEs,  i.e.,  infusion  site  pain  (4  subjects),  infusion  site 
swelling (4 subjects), and infusion site erythema (2 subjects), infusion site anaesthesia (1 subject), infusion site 
discomfort (1 subject), infusion site warmth (1 subject) and vessel puncture site swelling (1 subject). At the 
request of CHMP, the applicant has adequately clarified the incidence of discontinuation in the phase 1 study 
pool  for  the  group  of  subjects  who  received  IV  dosing  of  tedizolid  phosphate.  Most  of  the  subjects  who 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 100/110 
  
  
 
discontinued due to TEAEs that were related to IV site pain, tenderness, or swelling had received a higher dose 
(300 mg daily, 2 days up to 6 days) of tedizolid phosphate. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, 1488 subjects have been exposed to tedizolid phosphate ≥ 200 mg for at least one dose, out of which 
612 have been exposed to 200 mg tedizolid phosphate once daily for ≥ 5 doses which roughly corresponds to the 
recommended dosage (200 mg once daily for 6 days).  
The majority of these patients were, however, only treated orally. With respect to IV dosing, there were 331 
patients treated with ≥ 1 IV dose (study TR-701-113). Although, the proposed posology recommendation for 
the powder for infusion formulation includes a daily IV dose of 200 mg for 6 days the actual number of patients 
exposed of 5-6 IV doses is limited to only 67 in Phase 3 studies safety pool.  To conclude, the overall number of 
patients exposed to tedizolid phosphate at the recommended dosage is considered sufficient by the CHMP. It is 
acknowledged  that  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  tedizolid  is  relatively  similar  between  the  oral  and  the  IV 
administration with the exposure (AUC) and Cmax of tedizolid being increased approximately 20% and 30% 
respectively after IV administration as compared to oral administration.  
The most common adverse events associated with tedizolid phosphate in controlled phase 3 studies are nausea 
(8.2%), headache (6.2%), secondary abscess (5.3%), diarrhoea (3.9%), vomiting (2.9%) and cellulitis (2.6%). 
The incidence of abscess (5.3% vs. 3.9%) was higher in the tedizolid phosphate group than in the comparator 
group. Among these adverse events, the related TEAEs in the phase 3 group are nausea, headache, diarrhoea 
and vomiting. A dose dependent relationship was seen between tedizolid phosphate and nausea incidence. The 
adverse events occurring in the phase 1 studies with a frequency of ≥ 1% for the tedizolid phosphate group and 
>1.5  times  the  incidence  in  placebo  were  diarrhoea  (6.2%),  vessel  puncture  site  reaction  (2.5%), 
oropharyngeal pain (1.8%), pain in extremity (1.6%), and dry mouth (1.4%) and nasal congestion (1.4%).  
In the pool of all phase 2/3 studies, a total of 2 (0.2%) deaths were reported in the tedizolid phosphate group 
compared with 1 (0.2%) deaths in the all comparator groups. All 3 deaths were considered not related to study 
treatment. The overall incidence of SAEs was low (approx. 2%) and similar between the tedizolid phosphate and 
linezolid exposed groups.  Although, it is noted that a few more cases of infection were seen in the tedizolid 
phosphate  group  compared  to  the  linezolid  group.  A  discussion  regarding  these  cases  with  regard  to  the 
underlying disease and why they were classified as serious adverse events was presented together with the 
narratives for these patients and was considered reassuring by CHMP. 
The focus of the summary of safety according to the applicant has been to compare safety of tedizolid phosphate 
to the marketed oxazolidinone, linezolid, in the intended patient population, patients with cSSTI. Oxazolidinones 
inhibit bacterial and human mitochondrial protein synthesis. As a result, the use of these, and other antibiotic 
agents,  that  inhibit  protein  synthesis  can  be  associated  with  adverse  effects  linked  to  mitochondrial  protein 
synthesis inhibition such as myelosuppression, peripheral and optic neuropathies, and lactic acidosis. 
The overall haematology and serum chemistry results are quite similar for tedizolid phosphate (200 mg/day) 
and  linezolid  (1200  mg/day).The  incidence  of  substantially  abnormal  absolute  neutrophil  count  (ANC), 
haemoglobin values, and platelet counts in the phase 3 controlled studies group are roughly similar between the 
tedizolid phosphate and linezolid treatment groups. Although, a slight trend for decreased platelet counts is seen 
in the linezolid group (4.5% vs 2.1% for tedizolid phosphate).  Thus, a warning was included in section 4.4 
regarding myelosuppression (see SmPC). The use of tedizolid phosphate is associated with a low incidence of 
elevated  hepatic  enzymes  ALT,  AST  and  alkaline  phosphatase  which  is  similar  to  what  is  observed  for  the 
comparator linezolid. 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015

A case of related TEAE of Clostridium difficile colitis was reported in the tedizolid phosphate group. An adequate 
warning is included in SmPC section 4.4.  
Two  studies,  TR701-101  and  TR701-110,  carried  out  ophthalmic  and  neurologic  examinations  to  evaluate 
potential optic and peripheral neuropathy which has been observed for the linezolid after exposure of 21 days. 
Overall, there was no difference of TEAEs between tedizolid phosphate and linezolid in the performed clinical 
program with a maximum duration of treatment of 6 days for tedizolid phosphate and 10 days for linezolid. Optic 
and peripheral neuropathy has mainly been observed in patients treated with linezolid for a longer duration time 
than the approved duration of 28 days. Peripheral and optic nerve toxicity has been included as an important 
potential risk in the RMP for tedizolid phosphate which is endorsed.  Thus, a relevant precautionary statement in 
SmPC section 4.4 was included. 
Regarding the potential cardiovascular effects, the overall blood pressure and heart rate and ECG results seem 
quite  similar  for  tedizolid  phosphate  (200  mg/day)  and  linezolid  (1200  mg/day).  The  cardiac  safety  and 
thorough QTc study TR701-115 evaluated tedizolid phosphate for the potential for QT interval prolongation in 
healthy subjects indicated no concern.  
There are very limited data from drug interaction studies and on the safety of tedizolid when administered to 
patients with underlying conditions and/or on concomitant medications which might put them at risk from MAO 
inhibition.  
The  overall  incidence  of  TEAEs  in  subpopulations,  i.e.,  age,  sex,  race,  and  BMI,  and  underlying  disease 
characteristics relating to renal function, hepatic function, and diabetes, were analysed. Overall, with respect to 
TEAEs there were roughly no large differences regarding age groups, between men and women, or between 
obese and normal/overweight patients and between non-diabetic and diabetic patents. Based on analysis of PK 
data no dose adjustments or warnings for patients with hepatic impairment or patients with renal impairment or 
on dialysis are warranted.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety

Section 4.2 (Posology): The recommended dosage is 200 mg once daily for 6 days. 
None 
The safety and efficacy of tedizolid phosphate when administered for periods longer than 6 days 
have not been established. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC states: 
Decreased platelets, decreased haemoglobin and decreased neutrophils have been observed in a 
few subjects during treatment with tedizolid phosphate. In cases where tedizolid was 
discontinued, the affected haematological parameters have returned back to pre-treatment levels. 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015

Myelosuppression (including anaemia, leucopenia, pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia) has been 
reported in patients treated with another member of the oxazolidinone class and the risk of these 
effects appeared to be related to the duration of treatment. 
C. difficile 
associated 
diarrhoea 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC and patient information leaflet will include warnings regarding the risk of 
CDAD during and following antibiotic therapy.  
None 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC includes diarrhoea as an undesirable effect. 
Serotonin syndrome  As there is no in vivo evidence of serotonin syndrome or other forms of interaction with MAO from 
completed studies with tedizolid phosphate it is proposed that the following warnings be included 
in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
None 
Serotonin syndrome 
Spontaneous reports of serotonin syndrome associated with the co-administration of another 
member of the oxazolidinone class together with serotonergic agents have been reported. 
There is no Phase 3 clinical experience in patients with co-administration of Sivextro with 
serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors [SSRI], serotonin 
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors, triptans, and 
other medications with potential adrenergic or serotonergic activity. 
Section 4.5 of the SmPC includes the statement below.  
Tedizolid is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) in vitro; however, no interaction is 
anticipated when comparing the IC50 for MAO-A inhibition and the anticipated plasma exposures in 
man. Drug interaction studies to determine effects of 200 mg oral Sivextro at steady state on 
pseudoephedrine and tyramine pressor effects were conducted. No meaningful changes in blood 
pressure, heart rate with pseudoephedrine, and no clinically relevant increase in tyramine 
sensitivity were observed. 
The potential for serotonergic interactions has not been studied in either patients or healthy 
volunteers. 
Section 5.2 of the SmPC includes the statement below. 
Serotonergic effects at doses of tedizolid phosphate up to 30-fold above the human equivalent 
dose did not differ from vehicle control in a mouse model that predicts brain serotonergic activity. 
There are limited data in patients on the interaction between serotonergic agents and tedizolid 
phosphate. In Phase 3 studies, subjects taking serotonergic agents including antidepressants such 
as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin 5 
hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1) receptor agonists (triptans), meperidine, or buspirone were excluded. 
The SmPC (Section 4.2) outlines that the recommended dose is 200 mg once daily for 6 days. The 
safety and efficacy of tedizolid phosphate when administered for periods longer than 6 days have 
not been established. 
None 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC warnings include: 
Mitochondrial dysfunction  
Tedizolid inhibits mitochondrial protein synthesis. Adverse reactions such as lactic acidosis, 
anaemia and neuropathy (optic and peripheral) may occur as a result of this inhibition. These 
events have been observed with another member of the oxazolidinone class when administered 
over a duration exceeding that recommended for Sivextro. 
Peripheral neuropathy and optic nerve disorders 
Peripheral neuropathy, as well as optic neuropathy sometimes progressing to loss of vision, have 
been reported in patients treated with another member of the oxazolidinone class with treatment 
durations exceeding that recommended for Sivextro. Neuropathy (optic and peripheral) has not 
been reported in patients treated with tedizolid phosphate at the recommended treatment 
duration of 6 days. All patients should be advised to report symptoms of visual impairment, such 
as changes in visual acuity, changes in colour vision, blurred vision, or visual field defect. In such 
cases, prompt evaluation is recommended with referral to an ophthalmologist as necessary. 
Lactic acidosis 
Lactic acidosis has been reported with the use of another member of the oxazolidinone class. 
Lactic acidosis has not been reported in patients treated with tedizolid phosphate at the 
recommended treatment duration of 6 days. 
Lactic acidosis 
Peripheral and optic 
neuropathy 
Prolonged 
treatment >7 days 
Emergence of 
drug-resistance 
(cross-resistance to 
linezolid) 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC includes the statement below. 
None 
Non-susceptible microorganisms 
Prescribing tedizolid phosphate in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection 
increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 
Tedizolid phosphate is generally not active against Gram-negative bacteria (see section 5.1). 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 104/110 
  
  
 
 
 
In addition, section 5.1 of the SmPC contains the following information: 
The most commonly observed mutations in staphylococci and enterococci that result in 
oxazolidinone resistance are in one or more copies of the 23S rRNA genes (G2576U and T2500A).  
Organisms resistant to oxazolidinones via mutations in chromosomal genes encoding 23S rRNA or 
ribosomal proteins (L3 and L4) are generally cross-resistant to tedizolid. 
A second resistance mechanism is encoded by a plasmid-borne and transposon associated 
chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance (cfr) gene, conferring resistance in staphylococci and 
enterococci to oxazolidinones, phenicols, lincosamides, pleuromutilins, streptogramin A and 
16-membered macrolides. Due to a hydroxymethyl group in the C5 position, tedizolid retains 
activity against strains of Staphylococcus aureus that express the cfr gene in the absence of 
chromosomal mutations 
The mechanism of action is different from that of non-oxazolidinone class antibacterial medicinal 
products; therefore, cross-resistance between tedizolid and other classes of antibacterial 
medicinal products is unlikely. 
The SmPC includes the following advice in Section 4.6: 
None 
There are no data from the use of tedizolid phosphate in pregnant women. Studies in mice and rats 
showed developmental effects. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
Sivextro during pregnancy. 
A decision must be made as to whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain 
from Sivextro therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the 
benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Additional information for the prescriber on the studies in mice and rats that showed 
developmental effects  is also provided in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC states:  
Patients with neutropenia 
The safety and efficacy of tedizolid phosphate in patients with neutropenia (neutrophil counts 
<1000 cells/mm3) have not been investigated. In an animal model of infection, the antibacterial 
activity of tedizolid phosphate was reduced in the absence of granulocytes. The clinical relevance 
of this finding is unknown. Alternative therapies should be considered when treating patients with 
neutropenia and ABSSSI (see section 5.1). 
Limitations of the Clinical Data: 
Controlled clinical trials did not include patients with neutropenia (neutrophil counts <1000 
cells/mm3) or severely immunocompromised patients. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC includes the statement below. 
The clinical experience in patients ≥75 years is limited. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC includes the statement below. 
Limitations of the Clinical Data: 
None 
None. 
 The safety and efficacy of tedizolid phosphate when administered for periods longer than 6 days 
have not been established. 
In ABSSSI, the types of infections treated were confined to cellulitis/erysipelas or major cutaneous 
abscesses, and wound infections only. Other types of skin infections have not been studied. There 
is limited experience with tedizolid phosphate in the treatment of patients with concomitant acute 
bacterial skin and skin structure infections and secondary bacteremia and no experience in the 
treatment of ABSSSI with severe sepsis or septic shock.c 
 Section 4.5 of the SmPC for oral tedizolid phosphate includes the statement below. 
None. 
Based on in vitro results, there is a risk for enzyme induction by tedizolid phosphate. This may 
result in reduced efficacy of co-administered medicinal products that are narrow substrates of 
CYP3A4 (such as oral midazolam, triazolam, alfentanil, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pimozide, 
quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus), CYP2B6 (efavirenz), CYP2C9 (warfarin), and P-gp (digoxin). 
The enzyme induction by tedizolid phosphate may also reduce the efficacy of oral hormonal 
contraceptives (see section 4.4). This is not a complete list; please consult the SmPC of the 
co-administered medicinal product.  
There is a potential for interaction between oral tedizolid phosphate and orally administered 
substrates of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). The BCRP inhibition could result in 
increased exposure of medicinal products such as imatinib, lapatinib, methotrexate, pitavastatin, 
rosuvastatin, sulfasalazine, and topotecan (see section 5.2). If possible, an intermission of the 
co-administered medicinal product should be considered during the six days of treatment with 
tedizolid phosphate.

There is a potential for tedizolid phosphate to inhibit organic anion transporter (OATP1B1) based 
on in vitro data. The in vivo relevance is unknown. The OATP1B1 inhibition could result in 
increased exposure of medicinal products such as statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, 
and lovastatin), repaglinide, bosentan, valsartan, olmesartan, and glyburide. If possible, an 
intermission of the co-administered medicinal product should be considered during the six days of 
treatment with tedizolid phosphate.  
Section 5.2 of the SmPC includes the statements below. 
Drug metabolizing enzymes  
In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tedizolid phosphate and tedizolid do not 
significantly inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the following cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 
(CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). Induction of CYP3A4 mRNA 
was observed in vitro in hepatocytes (see section 4.5).  
Membrane transporters 
The potential for tedizolid or tedizolid phosphate to inhibit transport of probe substrates of 
important drug uptake (OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B3, OCT1, and OCT2) and efflux transporters (P-gp 
and BCRP) was tested in vitro. No consistent inhibition of any transporter was observed with the 
exception of BCRP, which was inhibited by tedizolid. Tedizolid inhibited OATP-1B1 by ~30% at 30 
µM. 
Cardiac safety (ie, 
QT prolongation) in 
patients with 
pre-existing 
cardiovascular risk 
factors 
There is no evidence from in vitro, animal, or thorough QT human clinical studies to suggest a risk 
for QT prolongation with tedizolid phosphate. However, data are limited to assess the cardiac 
safety of tedizolid in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. This item has been 
added to the list of safety concerns as “missing information”.  Therefore, routine risk minimisation 
measures are not applicable. 
None 
Minor points to be addressed in the next RMP update: 
- Sections V.3 and V.1.4 should be shortened by summarising the routine risk minimisation activities in the form 
of SmPC recommendations, as per the Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices, Module V.

The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Tedizolid  is  a  novel  antibiotic  belonging  to  the  oxazolidinone  class.  Oxazolidinones  are  protein  synthesis 
inhibitors that interact with the bacterial ribosome and prevent translation. The in vitro activity of tedizolid was 
largely bacteriostatic against the evaluated Gram-positive pathogens. The spectrum of activity includes mainly 
Gram-positive species, in particular those that are common aetiological agents of ABSSSI and overlaps with that 
of linezolid, including with regard to important resistance phenotypes associated with the target pathogens, 
such as MRSA. Of note, there was no cross-resistance observed with linezolid-resistant cfr positive S. aureus. 
The clinical efficacy of tedizolid phosphate in ABSSSI has been evaluated in two phase 3 randomised controlled 
studies (TR701-112 and TR701-113) and in two supportive phase 2 studies (TR701-104 and TR701-126) that 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 106/110 
  
  
recruited a total of 1725 patients (1056 and 669 to receive tedizolid phosphate or linezolid, respectively). The 
populations for the two phase 3 studies were similar.  Patients were required to have cellulitis/erysipelas, major 
cutaneous  abscess  or  wound  infection  with  a  minimum  total lesion  surface  area  of  75  cm2  and  at least  one 
regional  or  systemic  sign  of  infection.  Oral  (study  TR701-112)  and  IV  to  oral  (study  TR701-113)  tedizolid 
phosphate 200 mg once daily for 6 days was compared with linezolid 600 mg twice daily for 10 days. Patients 
required IV antibiotic therapy for a minimum of one IV dose of tedizolid phosphate or two doses of linezolid 
before an oral switch could be made. 
Non-inferiority of tedizolid phosphate compared to linezolid was shown for the co-primary endpoints, clinical 
success at PTE in the ITT and the CE-PTE populations (study TR701-112, ITT: 85.6% vs. 86.6% and CE-PTE: 
95.9% vs. 98.8%; study TR701-113, ITT: 88.0% vs. 87.7% and 92.4% vs. 96.1%). The lower limits of the 95% 
CIs were within the pre-defined non-inferiority margin of -10%. Secondary outcomes at 48-72 h, day 7 visit and 
EOT visit were in line with the outcomes at PTE in both studies. 
The  most  commonly  isolated  pathogen  in  the  pivotal  studies  was  S.  aureus,  of  which  approximately  40% 
consisted  of  MRSA,  followed  by  S.  pyogenes  and  species  belonging  to  the  S.  anginosus-milleri  group.  The 
microbiological  response  by  pathogen  showed  overall  similar  response  rates  for  tedizolid  phosphate  and 
linezolid. 
The clinical response rate in the non-comparative phase 2 studies was similar to that from the pivotal trials and 
thus in support of the shown beneficial effect. 
The following additional features may be considered as potential benefits for the product: 
• 
• 
The shorter duration of treatment with tedizolid phosphate may decrease the risk for the occurrence of 
the well-known class-related adverse reactions, mainly of the bone marrow suppression. 
The availability of the IV and PO tedizolid is an additional favourable feature, considering the very similar 
systemic exposures obtained with either of the two routes of administration. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The majority of the infections included in the two pivotal studies did not tend to be severe, and the existence of 
signs and/or symptoms of systemic involvement was not required, provided signs of regional infection were 
present at screening. CHMP requested the applicant to further present and discuss the clinical response data 
with respect to all possible evaluable severity criteria (e.g. lesion size, number of systemic signs of infection, 
SIRS criteria etc.) to assure that the efficacy of tedizolid phosphate is sufficient in more severe infections. The 
applicant provided tabulated clinical response data with respect to a number of severity criteria except number 
of  systemic  signs  of  infection  and  different  levels  of  CRP,  which  were  not  collected.  Despite  the  mentioned 
limitations, CHMP considered that the provided data were adequate and were supporting the conclusion that 
tedizolid  phosphate  is  also  effective  in  more  severe  infections.  The  number  of  patients  with  concomitant 
bacteraemia was low and this is adequately reflected in the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015 
Page 107/110 
  
  
In response to the CHMP concerns regarding the number of doses administered to patients in the linezolid arm, 
the  applicant  provided  supplementary  data,  which  were  reassuring  of  the  fact  that  the  majority  of  patients 
received all the planned doses of tedizolid phosphate and linezolid (one daily dose for 6 days and two daily doses 
for 10 days, respectively) and that the mean number of active doses received were close the planned number of 
doses. 
The  outcomes  in  the  performed  subgroup  analyses  of  the  pooled  clinical  data  were  generally  comparable 
between tedizolid phosphate and linezolid. However, a numerically lower response in the tedizolid phosphate 
group compared to the linezolid one was seen in patients with higher BMI, in patients with diabetes, and in 
patients with major cutaneous abscess. This relative lack of data has been adequately addressed in the SmPC.  
The  AUC/MIC  ratio  to  achieve  stasis  in  neutropenic  mice  was  at  least  16  times  that  of  immunocompetent 
animals. An extrapolation of animal model data to humans raises concerns that a 200 mg once daily dose of 
tedizolid phosphate would be too low to achieve the target attainment in a large number of neutropenic patients, 
provided that the PK was the same as in immunocompetent patients. CHMP therefore decided to request the 
applicant to include adequate information on the lack of data in neutropenic patients. This has been added by the 
applicant in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Risks   
Unfavourable effects 
The  most  frequent  unfavorable  effects  associated  with  tedizolid  phosphate  are  nausea  (6.9%),  headache 
(3.5%), diarrhea (3.2%) and vomiting (2.3%), which occurred during the treatment time (between day 0 and 
day 6). The overall discontinuation rate in the tedizolid phosphate group in phase 3 studies was very low (0.5%), 
and mostly concerned the GI SOC. This is not unexpected, considering the fact that tedizolid is an oxazolidinone 
and that the majority of the subjects were treated orally. 
The most important unfavorable effect associated with tedizolid phosphate is myelosuppression. Six patients 
receiving tedizolid phosphate (6/1050=0.6%) in phase 2 and phase 3 studies had at least one value that was 
over than or equal to two toxicity grades higher than baseline or a grade 4 value for hemoglobin, 8 for platelet 
counts (8/1050=0.8%) and 7 for absolute neutrophil count, ANC, (7/1050=0.7%).  The applicant stated that in 
the phase 3 controlled studies group, decreases of more than or equal to 2 toxicity grades from baseline were 
noted  in  65/583  (11.1%) of  the  TR-701  FA  patients  and  in  45/581  (7.7%)  of  linezolid  patients.   A  warning 
regarding myelosuppression was included in section 4.4 of the Sivextro SmPC. The use of tedizolid phosphate is 
associated  with  a  low  incidence  of  elevated  hepatic  enzymes  ALT,  AST  and  alkaline  phosphatase.  A  case  of 
related TEAE of Clostridium difficile colitis was reported in the tedizolid phosphate group. An adequate warning 
is included in SmPC section 4.4. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Oxazolidinones inhibit bacterial and human mitochondrial protein synthesis. As a result, the use of these and 
other  antibiotic  agents  that  inhibit  protein  synthesis  can  be  associated  with  adverse  effects  linked  to 
mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition such as myelosuppression, peripheral and optic neuropathies, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/83337/2015

lactic acidosis. Two studies, TR701-101 and TR701-110, carried out ophthalmic and neurologic examinations to 
evaluate potential optic and peripheral neuropathy.  
Overall, there was no difference of TEAEs between tedizolid phosphate and linezolid in the performed clinical 
program, with a maximum duration of treatment of 6 days for tedizolid phosphate and 10 days for linezolid. 
Optic  and  peripheral  neuropathy  has  mainly  been  observed  in  patients  treated  with  linezolid  for  a  longer 
duration time than the approved duration of 28 days. Peripheral and optic nerve toxicity has been included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP for tedizolid phosphate which is endorsed.  Thus, a relevant precautionary 
warning was required by the CHMP and was included by the applicant in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Tedizolid phosphate is a weak nonselective reversible monoaminooxidase (MAO) inhibitor when assayed in vitro 
with endogenous or expressed human MAO-A or MAO-B. A potential peripheral inhibition of MAO-A cannot be 
excluded.  The  use  of  certain  medications  (selective  serotonin  re-uptake  inhibitors  [SSRI],  serotonin 
norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors,  tricyclic  antidepressants,  MAOI,  triptans,  and  other  medications  with 
potential  adrenergic  or  serotonergic  activity)  was  prohibited  in  the  protocols  of  the  performed  trials.   Very 
limited data are therefore available from the performed drug interaction studies on the safety of tedizolid when 
administered to patients with underlying conditions and/or on concomitant medications which might put them at 
risk of a MAO inhibition. Corresponding statements in SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5 were therefore requested by 
the CHMP and were included by the applicant. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A number of antimicrobial agents are available for the treatment of cSSTI/ABSSSI. Because of the worldwide 
increase of antimicrobial resistance in general and of the increase in the methicillin resistant strains of S. aureus 
in particular(relevant for ABSSSI), there is a need for new antibacterial agents, especially for those available as 
an  oral  formulation.  Tedizolid  phosphate  represents  an  alternative  treatment  option  against  ABSSSI  and  is 
available in both oral and IV formulation, allowing an IV-to-oral switch treatment scheme possible without the 
need of a change in the antibiotic and/or dose. The spectrum of activity of tedizolid phosphate generally overlaps 
with  that  of  linezolid,  with  the  noteworthy  potential  advantage  of  maintained  in  vitro  efficacy  against 
linezolid-resistant cfr+ S. aureus. The observed safety profile of tedizolid phosphate was similar to that of the 
comparator linezolid. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  CHMP  agreed  that  the  antimicrobial  effect  of  tedizolid  phosphate  in  the  claimed  indication  has  been 
adequately demonstrated. This is supported by preclinical data, PK/PD considerations, as well as the outcome of 
the pivotal studies. 
Based on the applicant’s responses during the procedure (e.g. the submission of tabulated clinical response data 
with  respect  to  a  number  of  severity  criteria),  CHMP  agreed  that  the  data  provided  by  the  applicant  were 
sufficiently supportive of the fact that tedizolid phosphate is also effective in more severe ABSSSIs. CHMP noted 
nevertheless the low number of patients with concomitant bacteraemia in the pivotal trials and requested that 
this is adequately described in the SmPC.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Sanofi Pasteur submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 29 March 2019 an application for a group of variations. 
The following changes were proposed:

C.I.13 grouping: Submission of the final report from studies CYD14 and CYD15 listed as category 3 studies 
in the RMP. These are the final results of the pivotal efficacy studies including amendments to long-term 
efficacy follow-up (to capture the full range of dengue disease in the study population prospectively i.e. 
return to active detection of all symptomatic dengue cases) and long-term safety monitoring. No changes to 
the PI or RMP identified are proposed at this stage. Minor updates of the RMP will follow. 
The requested group of variations proposed no amendments to the Product Information. 
This addendum to the clinical overview covers the Year 6 long-term follow-up data (corresponding to Year 4 
of Hospital Phase) of the 2 pivotal efficacy studies CYD14 and CYD15 that have been conducted between 03 
June 2011 and 21 November 2017 for CYD14, and between 08 June 2011 and 05 March 2018 for CYD15, and 
for which their final clinical study reports were completed on 28 September 2018 and 20 December 2018, 
respectively.  
CYD14 and CYD15 studies have been conducted as part of an approved Paediatric 
Investigational Plan (PIP EMEA/001545/PIP01/13/MO1 modified in 2015 EMA decision 
P/0174/2015). 
Dengvaxia is a tetravalent, live-attenuated viral vaccine which contains ~5 log10 cell-culture infectious dose 
50% (CCID50) of each live, attenuated, dengue serotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 viruses. The current vaccination 
schedule consists of 3 doses administered 6-month apart. Dengvaxia is indicated for the prevention of 
dengue disease caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in individuals 9 to 45 years of age with prior 
dengue virus infection and living in endemic areas. 
This vaccine was first registered on 08 December 2015 in Mexico and is currently licensed in 19 countries 
and in Europe. In Europe, the commission decision was obtained on 12 December 2018 (centralized 
procedure). 
As of 07 December 2018, around 2,9 million doses of Dengvaxia had been distributed worldwide, mainly in 
Brazil and The Philippines where mass-vaccination campaigns were launched since the licensure of 
Dengvaxia in these countries.

2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
This addendum to the clinical overview of Dengvaxia presents the final data of the two pivotal efficacy 
studies CYD14 and CYD15 studies and assesses the potential impact of these data on the benefit / risk and 
on the information presented in the registered product information. 
The final clinical reports of CYD14 and CYD15 include data collected during Year 6 of the long-term follow-up 
(SAEs, hospitalized and severe VCDs, neutralizing antibody persistence data in the immunogenicity subset), 
i.e. one year more compared to the data presented in the CTD submitted in March 2018; also the final clinical 
reports include vaccine efficacy data against symptomatic VCDs during the SEP and the incidence and 
symptoms of Zika infections collected in CYD15 trial. Ninety-six percent (96.1%) and 78.2% of subjects in 
CYD14 and CYD15 studies, respectively, completed the study. 
Benefit 
In the initial MAA submission vaccine efficacy was observed against each of the 4 serotypes with high 
efficacy seen against symptomatic VCDs, severe VCD cases and hospitalized VCD cases over a 25-month 
observation period in the subjects aged 9 to 16 years in endemic regions receiving a 3-dose regimen 
administered 6 months apart based on pivotal efficacy trials CYD14 and CYD15. The final reports of CYD14 
and CYD15 do not bring any additional data on VE during in the Active Phase.  
In addition to short-term (month 0 to month 25) efficacy against hospitalized VCD and severe VCD, data on 
incidence of hospitalized and severe VCD was also collected from long-term follow-up of CYD14, CYD15 and 
CYD57 as a safety endpoint.  
In CYD14, 68 cases of HVCDs and 19 cases of SVCDs were observed during Year 6. Relative risk of HVCDs 
and SVCDs in the Vaccine Group versus Control Group were comparable to those observed during Year 5. 
During the entire study in CYD14, in 9 to 14 years old population (whatever the baseline dengue serostatus), 
a decreased risk of 0.455 (95%CI: 0.32; 0.65) for HVCDs and 0.412 (95%CI: 0.19; 0.89) for SVCDs was 
observed in vaccines compared to placebo and was consistent with the previous cumulative estimates (up to 
Year 5). In CYD15, there were no HVCD and SVCD cases reported during Year 6 of the study. Relative Risks 
during the entire study period of 0.323 (95% CI: 0.22; 0.47) for HVCD and 0.280 (95% CI: 0.11; 0.67) for 
SVCD respectively, indicated a decreased risk in vaccinees compared to placebo. 
The clinical profile of HVCDs during Year 6 in CYD14 was consistent with previous years. During the entire 
study the clinical profile of HVCDs was comparable in dengue vaccine recipients and placebo recipients in 
both studies. 
Within factors impacting VE, prior exposure to dengue infection was a previously established key factor. 
Vaccine performance by dengue serostatus at baseline was evaluated in the final study reports for CYD14 
and CYD15 within the immunogenicity subsets of the studies.  
When looking at risk of hospitalized VCD in 9 to 14 years old population dengue seropositive at baseline 
(immunogenicity subset), risks for HVCD are decreased in vaccinated seropositive subjects 9 years and 
above (immunogenicity subset) over the 6 years of follow-up in CYD14 (0.34 95%CI: 0.10; 1.09) and 
CYD15 (0.238 95%CI: 0.05; 0.89) as compared to placebo, and similarly to the estimates previously 
reported up to Year 5.  
With the protocol amendment 4 of CYD14 and CYD15 studies (implementation of the Surveillance Expansion 
Phase [SEP] for the detection of VCD cases hospitalized or not), where an active surveillance to detect all 
symptomatic cases was resumed, 92.1% and 80.7% of the subjects randomized at the beginning of CYD14 
and CYD15 studies, respectively signed the additional ICF for the SEP. VE against symptomatic VCD 
continued to be observed in subjects 9 to 16 years during the SEP and was 40.0% (95% CI 11.4; 59.3) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/553606/2019

39.3% (95% CI 1.6; 62.3) in CYD14 and CYD15, respectively. These results are consistent with the previous 
data. 
In both efficacy trials, neutralizing antibodies levels against each serotype tended to stabilize during the 
long-term follow-up in dengue seropositive subjects 9 to 16 years of age. Levels observed at Year 6 (5 years 
PD3) were comparable to levels observed during Year 2/3 of follow-up PD3. 
As CYD14 and CYD15 studies encompassed age groups at vaccination younger than 17 years old, the final 
study reports provide no additional data for the 18 to 45 year old population. 
Therefore, the conclusions on the clinical profile presented in Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties, 
Subsection 2. Clinical Efficacy of the PI are not impacted by these final data from CYD14 and CYD15. 
Risk 
There were no safety concerns surrounding the reactogenicity and AE profile of the candidate vaccine in the 
cumulative data provided by the Applicant. No additional data on reactogenicity has been generated. No 
safety concerns were identified from the review of additional SAEs from the long-term follow-up of CYD14 
and CYD15 studies. In both efficacy trials, the numbers of subjects experiencing at least one SAE during Year 
6 was low and similar in both groups. In particular no related SAEs have been reported during the long-term 
follow-up.  
Therefore, the conclusions on reactogenicity presented in Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects of the Product 
Information (PI) are not impacted by these final data from CYD14 and CYD15. Also there is no new data on 
exposed pregnancies. 
While data from the NS1 Supplemental analysis (see 5.3.5.4 NS1 Extended Report, Version 1.0 dated 05 
December 2017) indicated that for individuals 9-16 years of age without prior dengue exposure, a potential 
limited short-term benefit against symptomatic VCD might be conferred by vaccination, this benefit was 
offset by an increased risk of hospitalized and severe dengue. Based on these results, risk of hospitalized 
dengue and severe dengue in individuals without prior dengue infection had been previously classified as an 
“important identified risk” in RMP and listed in the labeling documents with a warning. The CYD14 and CYD15 
study reports include an updated evaluation of the risk of HVCD and SVCD within the immunogenicity 
subsets of the studies. The overall profile is not different than the one presented in the CTD submitted in 
March 2018 given the small number of new events. 
Finally there is no safety concern related to Zika infections. CYD15 protocol was amended (n°5, version 8.0, 
June 20th, 2016) to collect Zika symptomatic infections occurring during the trial. These infections occurred 
mainly in 2016. The proportion of virologically-confirmed Zika (VCZ) cases among fever episodes with 
available results for Zika was similar between the treatment groups, with a RR of 0.858 (95% CI: 0.65; 
1.13). The clinical symptoms were similar between treatment groups. 
Benefit-Risk Assessment 
Final clinical data included in the CYD14 and CYD15 reports do not provide new information on the efficacy, 
immunogenicity or safety profiles of Dengvaxia, which could modify the benefit/risk of the product in the 
indicated population, compared to the data that had been included in the CTD submitted in March 2018. 
The results are in line with the previous data obtained at 5 years post-PD1. The vaccine efficacy and the 
relative risks for HVCD and SVCD in vaccinated compared to placebo are more or less similar for the 
indicated dengue seropositive population above 9 yoa and the VE is comparable to the last data presented 
in the SmPC following the 5 years post-PD1. It is acknowledged that the latest data do not change the B/R 
assessment while those data are statistically weak. However, the SmPC was updated with the latest 6 years 
follow-up data (sections 4.8 and 5.1).  
The benefit-risk balance of Dengvaxia remains positive in individuals aged 9-45 years with laboratory

5.  Introduction 
On 12 December 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) delivered to the Applicant the license for the 
use of Dengvaxia in the European community with the following indication: prevention of dengue disease 
caused by dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in individuals 9 through 45 years of age with a prior dengue 
infection and living in endemic areas. Previous dengue infection can be assessed through medical record of 
a previous laboratory confirmed dengue infection or through current serotesting. The 2 pivotal Phase III 
studies CYD14 and CYD15 have been finalized since previous file submitted on March 2018. Hereafter is an 
addendum to Section 5 of the original 2.7.3 Summary of Clinical Efficacy submitted on March 2018 to 
present final CYD14 and CYD15 data including the last year of follow-up. As a reminder, the 2 pivotal efficacy 
studies were designed in 3 phases to detect dengue cases (see Figure 1 below): 
The Active Phase (M0-M25), in which surveillance was designed to maximize the detection of all 
symptomatic VCD (school-based surveillance, phone calls/SMS or home visits), regardless of the severity. 
The active detection of suspected symptomatic dengue cases started on the day of the first injection (M0) 
and lasted until each individual had been followed for at least 13 months after the third injection (M25).  
The Hospital Phase (M25 to the end of the trial [Year 6]), in which dengue screening occurred in febrile 
individuals who required hospitalization. The Hospital Phase started at the end of the Active Phase. 
Hospitalized and severe hospitalized dengue cases were to be collected up to 5 years after the third injection. 
There was a minimum frequency of one contact every 3 months and surveillance of identified non-study 
healthcare sites was to be performed.  
The Surveillance Expansion Phase (SEP): a surveillance system similar to the one in place during the Active 
Phase was implemented in order to further assess Dengvaxia’s efficacy in CYD14 and CYD15 over the 
long-term, by actively detecting all suspected symptomatic dengue cases. The active surveillance system 
was restarted in the Phase III efficacy trials after the safety signal was detected; this reinstatement of active 
surveillance occurred mostly for the last 2 years of the CYD14 and CYD15 studies (approximately Year 5 and 
Year 6 of the studies). It was initiated in the different study sites at different times depending on their Ethics 
Committees and regulatory times of approval and the time required to re-consent their respective 
individuals. Individuals declining to participate in the SEP continued to be followed up as part of the Hospital 
Phase surveillance described above. 
The period referred as to the “Entire Study” corresponds to the period from the first injection to the end of 
Year 6 (Years1 to 6).

6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
6.1.  CYD14 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study CYD14 entitled “Efficacy and Safety of a Novel Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine in Healthy Children Aged 
2 to 14 years in Asia”, was a randomized 2:1, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III efficacy study in 
10,275 children and adolescents from 11 sites in Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Thailand and 
Vietnam. 
 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of the Dengvaxia after 3 injections in preventing the 
occurrence of symptomatic VCD cases from M13 to M25. Secondary and other objectives included: 
The efficacy and safety of Dengvaxia for the occurrence of symptomatic VCD cases, hospitalized VCD 
(HVCD) cases and severe (IDMC definition) VCD (SVCD) cases during the Active Phase, the Hospital 
Phase (HP) / Surveillance Expansion Phase (SEP), and the entire study period. 
 
The evaluation of the humoral immune response to the CYD dengue vaccine after the second and 
third injections and the reactogenicity after each injection in a planned subset of 2,000 subjects 
(immunogenicity and reactogenicity subset). Long-term persistence of Ab levels was also evaluated 
up to 5 years after the third injection in the immunogenicity subset. 
 
 
The collection of serious adverses events (SAEs) in all subjects during the entire study duration. 
The potential impact of co-factors (e.g., age, dengue immune status at baseline in a subset of 
individuals) was assessed. 
Results 
Interim report version 4.0 dated 12 October 2017, provided in Module 5.3.5.3 of CTD submitted in March 
2018, included all results up to Year 5 of the study. Last available data up to Year 6 of the study are 
presented in the final report V5.0 dated 21 November 2018 and are summarized hereafter. A total of 9874 
(96.1%) subjects completed the study: 6595 (96.3%) in the Vaccine Group and 3279 (95.8%) in the Control 
Group. The main reason for termination was subjects’ voluntary withdrawal not for adverse event (AE): 220 
(3.2%) in the Vaccine Group and 128 (3.7%) in the Control Group. 
Efficacy During the SEP 
A total of 92.1% of the subjects randomized at the beginning of the study in both groups had signed the 
additional ICF for the SEP: 6327 subjects in the Vaccine Group and 3138 subjects in the Control Group.  
A total of 214 subjects reported symptomatic VCD episode in the Vaccine Group versus 146 in the Control 
Group during the SEP. The VE against symptomatic VCD during the SEP was 27.9% (95% CI: 10.4; 41.8) in 
subjects 2 to 14 years and 40.0% (95% CI: 11.4; 59.3) in subjects 9 to 14 years, regardless of the dengue 
immune serostatus at baseline. 
Long-Term Antibody Persistence 
The summary of GMTs during Year 6 (5-year PD3) in baseline dengue seropositive subjects 9 to 14 years is 
presented in Table 1.

Five years PD3, GMTs against each serotype in the vaccinees tend to stabilize. GMTs remained higher than 
at baseline levels for each serotype.  
Relationship between Dengue and Zika 
In response to Zika outbreak in the Americas, subjects from the subset were tested for anti-Zika Abs from 
start of 2013 (retrospective period) through the end of the study. Likewise, from the start of 2013 and until 
the end of the study, subjects with febrile episodes were assayed for Zika virus (see 5.3.5.1 CYD15 Final 
Report, Appendix 1 for CYD15 Amendment 5, version 8.0 dated 20 June 2016). 
Overall, from 2013 and up to V12, 46 additional cases of acute samples with available RT-PCR results tested 
positive for Zika compared to interim results presented in previous CYD15 Interim Report. The proportion of 
virologically-confirmed Zika (VCZ) cases among fever episodes with available results for Zika was similar 
between the treatment groups, with a RR of 0.858 (95% CI: 0.65; 1.13). Among the 239 VCZ episodes (in 
237 subjects), there were 152 episodes (in 150 subjects) in the Vaccine Group and 87 episodes (in 87 
subjects) in the Control Group.  
Overall, most virologically-confirmed Zika cases occurred in 2016 and incidence among study participants 
over the entire study period was highest in Mexico (6.0%), Honduras (3.1%), and Puerto Rico (1.9%). The 
clinical symptoms were similar between treatment groups. 
6.2.  CYD15 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study CYD15 entitled “Efficacy and Safety of a Novel Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine in Healthy Children and 
Adolescents Aged 9 to 16 years in Latin America”, was a randomized 2:1, observer-blind, 
placebo-controlled, Phase III efficacy study in 20,869 children and adolescents from 22 sites in Brazil, 
Colombia, Honduras, Mexico and Puerto Rico. The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of Dengvaxia 
after 3 injections in preventing the occurrence of symptomatic VCD cases from M13 to M25. Secondary and 
other objectives included: 
 
The efficacy and safety of Dengvaxia for the occurrence of symptomatic VCD cases, hospitalized VCD 
(HVCD) cases and severe (IDMC definition) VCD (SVCD) cases during the Active Phase, the Hospital 
Phase/SEP, and the entire study period.

 
The evaluation of the humoral immune response to the CYD dengue vaccine after the second and 
third injections and the reactogenicity after each injection in a planned subset of 2,000 subjects 
(immunogenicity and reactogenicity subset). Long-term persistence of Ab levels was also evaluated 
up to 5 years after the third injection in the immunogenicity subset. 
 
 
The collection of SAEs in all subjects during the entire study duration. 
The potential impact of co-factors (e.g., age, dengue immune status at baseline in a subset of 
individuals) was assessed. 
Interim report version 4.0 dated 08 January 2018 provided in Module 5.3.5.3 of CTD submitted in March 
2018, included all results up to Year 5 of the study. Last available data up to Year 6 of the study are 
presented in the final report V5.0 dated 20 December 2018 and are summarized hereafter. A total of 16,319 
(78.2%) subjects completed the study: 10932 (78.5%) in the Vaccine Group and 5387 (77.5%) in the 
Control Group. The main reason for termination was subjects’ voluntary withdrawal not for adverse event 
(AE): 2353 (16.9%) in the Vaccine Group and 1226 (17.6%) in the Control Group. 
Results 
Efficacy during the SEP 
A total of 80.7% of the subjects randomized at the beginning of the study in both groups had signed the 
additional ICF for the SEP (11,278 subjects in the Vaccine Group and 5556 subjects in the Control Group). 
A total of 42 subjects reported symptomatic VCD episodes in the CYD Dengue Vaccine Group versus 34 in the 
Control Group during the SEP. The VE against symptomatic VCD during the SEP was 39.3% (95% CI: 1.6; 
62.3) in subjects 9 to 16 years, regardless of the dengue immune serostatus at baseline .

6.3.  Discussion 
This critical expert overview of Dengvaxia covers the Year 6 long-term follow-up data of the 2 pivotal efficacy 
studies CYD14 and CYD15. Ninety-six percent (96.1%) of subjects and 78.2% in CYD14 and CYD15 studies, 
respectively completed the study. 
In CYD14, n=68 cases of HVCDs and of n=19 cases of SVCDs were observed during Year 6. Relative risk of 
HVCDs and SVCDs in Vaccine Group versus Control Group were comparable to those observed during Year 
5. During the entire study in CYD14, in 9 to 14 years old population (whatever the baseline 
dengue serostatus), a decreased risk of HVCD was observed and was consistent with the 
previous cumulative estimates (up to Year 5).  
In CYD15, there were no HVCD and SVCD cases reporting during Year 6 of the study. Relative Risks indicated 
a decreased risk for HVCD and SVCD respectively. The clinical profile of HVCDs during Year 6 in CYD14 
was consistent with previous years.  
During the entire study the clinical profile of HVCDs was comparable in dengue vaccine 
recipients and placebo recipients in both studies.  
When considering the dengue seropositive population, and based on immune subset, risks for HVCD are 
decreased in dengue vaccine recipients over the 6 years of follow-up in CYD14 and CYD15 and similar to the 
one previously reported up to Year 5.  
During SEP where an active surveillance to detect all symptomatic cases was resumed, 92.1% and 80.7% of 
the subjects randomized at the beginning of CYD14 and CYD15 studies, respectively had signed the 
additional ICF for the SEP. VE against symptomatic VCD continues to be observed during the SEP 
and was 39.3% (95% CI: 1.6; 62.3) in subjects 9 to 16 years in each study. 
In both efficacy trials, neutralizing antibodies levels against each serotype tended to stabilize during the 
long-term follow-up in dengue seropositive subjects 9 to 16 years of age, and were comparable at Year 6 to 
levels observed during at Year 2/3 of follow-up. In both efficacy trials, the numbers of subjects experiencing 
at least one SAE during Year 6 was low and similar in both groups and none of these SAEs were considered 
as related to the study vaccine by either the Investigator or the Sponsor.  
According to the Applicant, the results of Year 6 for CYD14 and CYD15 studies revealed no new relevant 
information on the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety profiles of Dengvaxia, related to the benefit/risk of 
the product in the indicated population.

Analysis Set 
Subjects 2 to 14 Years 
The increased Relative Risk (RR) of HVCD (RR slightly above 1) reported during Year 3 and Year 4 that 
started to decrease in Year 5 (RR: 0.856 [95% CI: 0.53; 1.42]) continued to decrease in Year 6 with a RR of 
0.669 (95% CI:0.40; 1.12). Considering the entire study, the risk of HVCD remained lower in the vaccinees 
compared to the controls and similar to the one previously reported up to Year 5 (RR: 0.673 [95% CI: 0.53; 
0.85]). 
In addition to serotype 2 (11 cases), the main serotypes identified during Year 6 in the Vaccine Group were 
the same as the ones observed during the previous years: serotype 1 (14 cases) and serotype 3 (11 cases). 
In the Control Group, serotype 1 (11 cases) already observed as the main serotype in Year 4 and Year 5 was 
the main serotype, along with serotype 2 (11 cases). On the entire study period, serotype 1 and 3 were the 
main serotypes identified in both groups (132 and 100 cases respectively, of a total of 364 reported cases).  
The estimate of the RR for SVCD during Year 6 was similar to that observed during Y5 (RR: 0.812 [95% CI: 
0.31; 2.26]) and also lower than that observed during the Y1 and Y2 of HP. Considering the entire study, RR 
of SVCD remained below 1 and similar to the one previously reported up to Year 5 (RR: 0.720 [95% CI: 
0.46; 1.15]). 
Subjects 9 to 14 Years 
As previous years, the RR remained < 1 with the upper bound of the CI above 1, suggesting a trend toward 
a decreased risk of HVCD cases in the Vaccine Group. Considering the entire study, the risk of HVCD 
remained lower in the vaccinees compared to the controls and similar to the one previously reported up to 
Year 5 (RR: 0.447 [95% CI: 0.30; 0.67]). 
During Year 6, 1 SVCD case was reported in the Vaccine Group and 2 SVCD cases were reported in the 
Control Group. Considering the entire study, the risk of SVCD remained lower in the vaccinees compared to 
the controls and similar to the one previously reported up to Year 5 (RR: 0.434 [95% CI: 0.19; 0.98]). 
PRNT50 Seropositive Subjects 2 to 14 years 
Considering the entire study, the risk of HVCD remained lower in the vaccinees compared to the controls and 
similar to the one previously reported up to Year 5 (RR: 0.413 [95% CI: 0.19; 0.87]).

Considering the entire study, RR of SVCD remained below 1 and similar to the one previously reported up to 
Year 5 (RR: 0.396 [95% CI: 0.08; 1.84]). 
SAEs 
During Y6, a total of 296 subjects experienced 315 SAEs, including 3 deaths. None of these SAEs were 
considered as related to the study vaccine by either the Investigator or the Sponsor. The numbers of 
subjects experiencing at least one SAE were low and similar in both groups: 191 subjects (2.9%) in the 
Vaccine Group reported 203 SAEs and 105 subjects (3.2%) in the Control Group reported 112 SAEs. 
CHMP comment 
The Year 6 data did not reveal any new safety concerns. Meanwhile it confirms the trend for higher RR for 
HVCD and SVCD that is present in the dengue non-immune seronegative subjects vaccinated vs placebo 
control subject even after 6 years PD1. 
7.2.  CYD15 
Results 
There were no HVCD and SVCD cases reporting during Year 6 of the study. Therefore, RR previously reported 
during the entire study results are the same as previously reported showing a decreased risk:  
RR of 0.323 (95% CI: 0.22; 0.47) and 0.280 (95% CI: 0.11; 0.67) for HVCD and SVCD respectively, in 
subjects 9 to 16 years regardless of their baseline dengue serostatus 
RR of 0.238 (95%CI: 0.05; 0.89) for HVCD in PRNT50 seropositive subjects 9 to 16 years (too few number of 
SVCD cases reported in the subset of subjects with available PRNT50 titers at baseline for interpretation of 
the results). 
SAEs 
During Y6, a total of 523 subjects experienced 599 SAEs, including 13 deaths. None of these SAEs were 
considered as related to the study vaccine by either the Investigator or the Sponsor. The numbers of 
subjects experiencing at least one SAE were low and similar in both groups: 357 subjects (3.2%) in the 
Vaccine Group reported 408 SAEs and 166 subjects (3.0%) in the Control Group reported 191 SAEs (see 
Addendum to 2.7.4, Section 1.1.1).  
7.3.  Discussion  
There were no HVCD and SVCD cases reporting during Year 6 of the study. Therefore, RR previously reported 
during the entire study results are the same as previously reported showing a decreased risk:  
RR of 0.323 (95% CI: 0.22; 0.47) and 0.280 (95% CI: 0.11; 0.67) for HVCD and SVCD respectively, in 
subjects 9 to 16 years regardless of their baseline dengue serostatus 
RR of 0.238 (95%CI: 0.05; 0.89) for HVCD in PRNT50 seropositive subjects 9 to 16 years (too few number 
of SVCD cases reported in the subset of subjects with available PRNT50 titers at baseline for interpretation of 
the results). 
During Y6, a total of 523 subjects experienced 599 SAEs, including 13 deaths. None of these SAEs were

subjects experiencing at least one SAE were low and similar in both groups: 357 subjects (3.2%) in the 
Vaccine Group reported 408 SAEs and 166 subjects (3.0%) in the Control Group reported 191 SAEs. 
Year 6 data did not reveal any or new safety concerns. 
Safety by Dengue Serostatus at Baseline 
As the number of hospitalized VCD cases observed in the subset of subjects with measured PRNT50 titers 
available at baseline was low (10% to 20%), the results hereafter are to be interpreted with caution. 
Integrating data from D0 to the last year of long term follow-up (Year 6): 
Dengue non-immune subjects 
In CYD14, over the entire study, an increased risk of HVCD in the Vaccine Group compared to the Control 
group remained in the non-immune subjects 2 to 8 years old (RR: 1.694 [95%CI: 0.59; 5.91]) while in the 
subjects 9-16 years old, a trend towards a lower risk of HVCD was observed in the Vaccine Group compared 
to the Control group (RR: 0.387 [95%CI: 0.09; 1.52]). In CYD15, due to the low number of cases reported 
in this subgroup, results are difficult to interpret but a total of 3 HVCD cases were reported and all were in 
the Vaccine group. 
Dengue immune subjects 
In CYD14, over the entire study, a trends towards a decreased risk of HVCD was observed in both 2 to 8 and 
9 to 14 years old (RR: 0.467 [95%CI: 0.20; 1.09] and RR: 0.34 [95%CI: 0.10; 1.09], respectively).  
In CYD15, the risk of HVCD over the entire study was lower in the Vaccine group compared to the Control 
Group (RR: 0.238 [95%CI: 0.05; 0.89]. 
The cumulative incidence of hospitalized VCD in the 2 individual Phase III efficacy studies during the entire 
study period in the ≥ 9 years old and < 9 years old, and by dengue serostatus at baseline are presented in 
the following Table.

7.4.  Conclusion 
In CYD14, n=68 cases of HVCDs and of n=19 cases of SVCDs were observed during Year 6. Relative Risks 
were 0.455 (95% CI: 0.32; 0.65) and 0.368 (95% CI: 0.17; 0.77). Relative risk of HVCDs and SVCDs in 
Vaccine Group versus Control Group were comparable to those observed during Year 5. During the entire 
study in CYD14, in 9 to 14 years old population (whatever the baseline dengue serostatus), a decreased risk 
of HVCDs was observed and was consistent with the previous cumulative estimates (Up to Year 5).  
In CYD15, there were no HVCD and SVCD cases reporting during Year 6 of the study. Relative Risks were 
0.323 (95% CI: 0.22; 0.48) and 0.311 (95% CI: 0.13; 0.73) showing a decreased risk for HVCD and SVCD 
respectively.  
The conclusions from Year 6 data and completed long-term safety follow-up from individual 
CYD14 and CYD15 studies are the following: 
In all age subjects 
During Year 6 in CYD14, a trend towards a decrease of the number of HVCD and SVCD cases compared to the 
previous years of Hospital Phase/SEP was observed in the Vaccine Group. This resulted in a decreased RR of 
HVCD (but not of SVCD) in favour of the Vaccine Group during Year 6. No HVCD and SVCD cases were 
reported during Year 6 in CYD15. 
Regarding the overall Hospital Phase/SEP, a trend towards a decreased risk of HVCD in the Vaccine Group 
was observed in CYD14 (RR = 0.889 (95%CI : 0.69; 1.15)) but the risk of SVCD remains higher in the 
Vaccine Group (RR = 1.085 (95%CI : 0.65; 1.86)).  
In CYD15, the risk of HVCD during the overall Hospital Phase/SEP was lower in the Vaccine Group compared 
to the Control Group (both RR and entire 95%CI below 1) (RR = 0.515 (95%CI : 0.30; 0.90)) and a trend 
towards a decreased risk of SVCD was observed (RR below 1 but 95%CI included 1) (RR = 0.896 (95%CI : 
0.27; 3.40)). 
Regarding the Entire Study (from D0 up to end of Year 6), the risk of HVCD was lower in the Vaccine Group 
compared to the Control Group in both CYD14 and CYD15 studies (both RR and entire 95%CI below 1). The 
risk of SVCD was lower in the Vaccine Group in CYD15, and a trend for a decreased risk of SVCD in the 
Vaccine Group was observed in CYD14.  
In subjects ≥9 years of age  
During Year 6 in CYD14, a trend towards a reduced RR of HVCD and SVCD in the Vaccine group Compared 
to the Control Group was observed in this age group during Year 6. No HVCD and SVCD cases were reported 
during Year 6 in CYD15.  
Regarding the overall Hospital Phase/SEP, a lower risk of HVCD was observed in the Vaccine Group 
compared to the Control Group in both CYD14 and CYD15 (both RR and entire 95%CI below 1) and a lower 
risk of SVCD was also observed in the Vaccine Group in both studies [CYD14: RR=0.749 (0.28; 2.11)] & 
[CYD15: RR=0896 (0.27; 3.40)]. 
Regarding the Entire Study, the risk of HVCD and SVCD in this age group was lower in the Vaccine Group 
compared to the Control Group in both CYD14 and CYD15 (both RR and entire 95%CI below 1)  
In subjects <9 years of age  
During Year 6 of CYD14, a trend for a decreased risk of HVCD compared to the previous years of Hospital 
Phase/SEP was observed in the Vaccine Group but the risk of SVCD remained higher in the Vaccine Group 
compared to the Control Group.

Regarding the overall Hospital Phase/SEP, the risk of HVCD and SVCD was higher in the Vaccine Group 
compared to the Control Group  
Regarding the Entire Study, the risk of HVCD and SVCD tended to be similar between the Vaccine Group 
compared to the Control Group Looking at the severity of severe VCD, there were no major differences in the 
clinical pattern of VCD cases between the Vaccine and Control groups during the Entire Study period in both 
CYD14 and CYD15 studies. 
When considering the indicated population, i.e. dengue-immune subjects ≥9 years old, based on 
PRNT50 titers measured before vaccination, the risk of HVCD is lower in CYD15 (RR and entire 
95%CI below 1) while trend towards lower risk of HVCD is observed in CYD14 (RR below 1 with 
95%CI including 1).  
Furthermore, there was a trend towards a lower risk of SVCD in the dengue immune vaccinated 
subjects of any age compared to the Control Group in both CYD14 and CYD15. However, due to 
the very limited number of cases reported among subjects with an available PRNT50 measured 
dengue status at baseline, results are difficult to interpret. 
These results are consistent with the previous cumulative estimates (Up to Year 5). Consistent 
data were also observed in seronegative subjects. Also there are no changes in the clinical 
profile of dengue cases in dengue seronegative and seropositive subjects 9 to 16 years of age. 
CHMP comment 
The current SmPC section 5.1 describes briefly the long-term protection:  
2.5 Long-term protection  
During a period of 5 years after the first injection, in subjects 9 years of age and above with previous dengue 
infection, the extrapolated vaccine efficacy (1-Hazard Ratio) (obtained from an exploratory analysis) is 
estimated at 79% (95% CI: 69; 86) for hospitalized VCD and 84% (95% CI: 63; 93) for severe VCD. 
During a period of 6 years after the first injection, in subjects 9 years of age and above with previous dengue 
infection, the relative risks in CYD14 and CYD15 are estimated at 0.34 (0.10; 1.09) & 0.238 (0.05; 0.89) 
for hospitalized VCD respectively when compared to the placebo group. 
During a period of 6 years after the first injection, in subjects 9 years of age and above with previous dengue 
infection, the relative risks in CYD14 and CYD15 are estimated 0.413 (0.10; 1.63) & (0.238 (0.00; 4.57) 
for severe VCD respectively when compared to the placebo group. 
These figures and the data provided by the MAH are more or less consistent with the previous data related 
to 5 years after 1st dose. Meanwhile, the data for this section of 5.1 needs to be updated for the same 
endpoints described currently. 
The CHMP considers that the figures must be updated for the same clinical endpoints as described in the 
current SmPC.  The SmPC needs to be updated with these latest data. The Applicant is requested to submit 
a proposition for the wording in section 4.8 and 5.1. that reflects the VE and RR for HVCD and SVCD with the 
95%CI which are wide or include 1.

Question 1 
The incidence of SVCD by baseline serostatus and by age group does not present the data stratified for the 
9-14 yoa of the CYD14. This needs to be specified. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) of CYD14 trial (version 6 dated 27 January 2017), includes analyses on 
hospitalized virologically-confirmed dengue cases (VCDs) and severe VCDs throughout the trial. However, 
the analyses on severe VCDs are subject to the number of cases available, as per section 5.1.2.2.2.2 of the 
SAP. “The analysis will be performed by serotype, by age group, by country and by dengue baseline status 
for the subjects included in the immunogenicity subset. Depending on the number of hospitalized dengue 
cases observed, an additional analysis may be performed according to WHO criteria and IDMC clinical 
assessment” In the immunogenicity subset of CYD14, there were respectively, n=26 cases of hospitalized 
VCDs and n=2 cases of Severe VCDs (as per IDMC clinical assessment) during the entire study (6 years) in

9-14 yoa. In agreement with the SAP for CYD14 and due to the low number of cases, no analysis was done 
on SVCDs by baseline dengue serostatus in the immunogenicity subset for the 9-14 yoa. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Issue resolved. 
Question 2 
The wording and figures must be updated for the same clinical endpoints as described in the current SmPC. 
The MAH insists on the fact that the data must be interpreted with caution as the subset population sample 
size with immunostatus at baseline is very limited. The SmPC needs to be updated with these latest data. 
The Applicant is requested to submit a proposition for the wording in sections 4.8 and 5.1 that reflects the VE 
and RR for HVCD and SVCD in the indicated population with the 95%CI which are wide or include 1. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The data presented in the current SmPC, sections 4.8 and 5.1, correspond to data generated in the 
extension of NS1 supplemental study (report version 1.0 dated 05 December 2017). As presented in the 
submission dossier, only 7.5-20% of subjects from the 3 efficacy trials (subjects from the immunogenicity 
subsets) had pre-vaccination samples collected to enable determination of serostatus. Sanofi Pasteur 
undertook supplemental studies using the NS1 assay to expand the database of individuals with baseline 
serostatus to enable determination with greater precision of the effect of serostatus on vaccine performance. 
In the NS1 supplemental study, a case-cohort design was used to estimate risk of hospitalized and severe 
dengue and vaccine efficacy against symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue (VCD) according to 
baseline serostatus. The Applicant proposes to keep the same kind of data discussed and approved by EMA 
when granting the license in December 2018. The Applicant proposes to update the requested paragraphs in 
section 4.8 and 5.1 (see proposed PI in module 1) to include data from the final NS1 report (NS1 close-out, 
version 1.0 dated 28 March 2019) provided with this response document (Module 5 section 5.3.5.4). This 
report includes the final safety and efficacy results from the extension of the supplemental study.The 
Applicant uses this opportunity of updated PI to integrate the changes due to QRD template version 10.1 
dated on 28th June 2019. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response

The applicant is also currently developing esketamine for the treatment of adolescents (12 to <18 years) 
with major depressive disorder in patients assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide (MDSI). The 
Paediatric Investigational Plan (EMEA-001428-PIP03-15) was agreed with the Paediatric Committee 
(PDCO) in December 2016. The applicant is planning to complete 3 paediatric clinical studies in 
adolescents with MDSI, including 1 Phase 2 and 1 Phase 3 double-blind and psychoactive 
placebo-controlled studies and 1 open-label Phase 3 safety study. The entire paediatric program is 
expected to take approximately 8 years to complete. Approximately one-half of the planned 145 subjects 
have been randomized in the ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept study. As agreed with PDCO, the start of 
the two Phase 3 studies has been deferred pending completion of the Phase 2 study. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
SPRAVATO (esketamine) nasal spray (hereafter referred to as “esketamine”) is currently approved in the 
European Union (EU), the United States (US), and other markets for the treatment of adults with 
treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The applicant (Janssen Research & Development) has also 
investigated esketamine for the treatment of adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) assessed to be 
at imminent risk for suicide (hereafter referred to in this document as MDSI).  
Suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB) is an umbrella term, which includes a range of passive and active 
thoughts about self-harm, with deliberate consideration or planning of possible techniques of causing 
one's own death, with or without suicidal intent (Posner, Oquendo et al., 2007). Suicidal ideation or 
behavior can be found in disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar, depressive or anxiety. According to 
DSM-5, suicidal behavior disorder is defined when the individual has made a suicide attempt within the 
last 24 months and the attempt does not meet the criteria of a non-suicidal self-injury. 
The ICD code R458 is used to code Suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation, also known as suicidal thoughts, 
concerns thoughts about or an unusual preoccupation with suicide. The range of suicidal ideation varies 
greatly from fleeting thoughts, to extensive thoughts, to detailed planning, role playing (e.g., standing on 
a chair with a noose), and incomplete attempts, which may be deliberately constructed to not complete 
or to be discovered, or may be fully intended to result in death, but the individual survives (e.g., in the 
case of a hanging in which the cord breaks) (ICD-10 codes, accessed March 2020). 
It should be noted that the term major depressive disorder in patients assessed to be at imminent risk for 
suicide (MDSI) does not currently exist in the literature or the clinical practice apart from data related to 
the investigation of esketamine in this specific group of depressed patients (identified by the answer yes 
to the questions B3 and B10 of the MINI, please see below). For the rest of the document it will be referred 
to as the so-called MDSI.  
After discussions at CHMP it was considered more appropriate to avoid any reference to suicidal thoughts, 
suicidal ideation or behaviour in the therapeutic indication. 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
It has been estimated that nearly 45,000 people in the United States (CDC, 2018) and more than 800,000 
worldwide die by suicide each year (GBD 2015). 
It is suggested in the literature that 80% of the patients who committed suicide had contact with primary 
care clinicians within one year of their death and only 25% to 30% had contact with psychiatric clinicians 
within the year of their death (Stene-Larsen et al. 2019 and Walby et al 2018)  
It has been also reported that there are no data to support that routine screening for suicide reduces 
mortality. In addition, it cannot be predicted with a high degree of sensitivity or specificity, which patients 
who have suicidal thoughts will proceed to have a suicide attempt (Hyman 1994 and Sher 2004) 
(Uptodate.com Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults, accessed March 2020). 
According to the applicant, research in the field of suicidal depression indicates that patients with MDD 
who have active suicidal ideation with intent represent a particularly ill subpopulation. It can be agreed 
that compared with MDD patients without suicidal ideation, MDD patients with suicidal ideation have more 
severe symptoms of depression, higher scores of hopelessness, anhedonia, worthlessness, and lack of 
optimism, as well as greater psychiatric comorbidity, higher rates of insomnia, alcohol 
Assessment report

Page 11/163 
 
 
 
dependence/abuse, poor social support, worse functioning and quality of life, and more prior suicide  
attempts. Some physiological differences [e.g., elevated levels of inflammation (interleukin-6, C-reactive 
protein)] have also been reported in MDD patients who have high levels of suicidal ideation versus 
patients whose levels of suicidal ideation were lower. These findings suggest that depression with suicidal 
ideation is most likely a more severe form of the illness that requires rapid and aggressive treatment to 
help alleviate the debilitating symptoms these patients are experiencing.  
It is postulated that nearly all patients with MDD who attempt or die by suicide have suicidal ideation prior 
to the event, and individuals with more severe ideation, defined as intent or intent with plan, are at a 
greater risk of suicide or suicide attempt than those without suicidal intent. Importantly, the interval 
between the onset of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt is often very short (minutes to hours), 
highlighting the need for urgent treatment.  
Disease or condition 
Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the overall global 
burden of disease. Major Depressive Disorder is a serious, disabling psychiatric illness that can have a 
devastating impact on the lives of patients. Moreover, MDD is the psychiatric condition most commonly 
associated with suicide. Suicide-related morbidity and mortality in patients with MDD are a major public 
health concern. The reported prevalence of suicidal ideation in adult patients with MDD is as high as 60% 
and the lifetime prevalence of attempted suicide in this population ranges between 10% and 20%. 
Further, the lifetime risk of completed suicide is estimated to be 3.4% in this population. 
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The applicant was initially seeking approval of SPRAVATO for the following indication: 
“Esketamine is indicated, as acute short-term treatment, co-administered with oral antidepressant 
therapy, for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in adult patients with a moderate to severe 
episode of MDD who have current suicidal ideation with intent." 
Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Reported rates of suicides probably underestimate the true burden because of misclassification of deaths. 
Suicides may be misclassified as accidents or unintentional because of uncertainty about the decedent’s 
intent as well as sensitivity about suicide and social stigma; in some countries, suicide is illegal. 
Misclassification may also occur because of legal and procedural issues related to death registration. 
Worldwide, the crude suicide mortality rates dropped between 2000 and 2016, by 16% in men and 20% 
in women. In 2016, nearly 800 000 deaths were due to suicide, equivalent to an annual global crude 
suicide mortality rate of 10.6 per 100 000 population or one person every 40 seconds (WHO.int mental 
health/suicide accessed March 2020). 
Suicide is considered the 14th leading cause of global mortality and the causes of death from self-harm 
can be nearly 250 (Uptodate.com Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults, accessed March 2020).  
Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan. In fact, 79% of suicides occurred in 
low- and middle-income countries in 2016. Effective and evidence-based interventions can be 
implemented at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts.

There are indications that for each adult who died by suicide there may have been more than 20 others 
attempting suicide. This ratio differs widely by country, region, sex, age and method (WHO.int mental 
health/suicide accessed March 2020). 
According to the applicant, the population of patients with MDD who have active suicidal ideation with 
intent is identifiable by treating clinicians. Monitoring and assessment of suicidality could be a routine part 
of psychiatric practice, and this evaluation typically includes an assessment of the frequency and severity 
of suicidal thoughts, intent to act on thoughts, plans and methods, past suicidal behavior, risk and 
protective factors and impulsivity. The WHO and European MDD guidelines recommend all patients with 
depression should be assessed for suicidality. The collection of suicidality information is part of the 
standard mental status examination and there are a number of tools that can be used to identify 
suicidality in the primary care or emergency room setting [e.g. Columbia Suicide Severity Scale 
(C-SSRS), Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA), Beck Scale for Suicidal 
Ideation (BSS), InterSePT Scale for Suicidal Thinking, SAD PERSONS Scale, Manchester Self-Harm Rule 
(MSHR) , ReACT, which is a modification of MSHR, Sodersjukhuset Self Harm Rule, Beck Hopelessness 
Scale (Posner, Oquendo et al., 2007; Runeson et al 2017; Turecki and Brent 2016)]. 
However, despite the number of standardized scales, which have been proposed to evaluate suicide risk, 
none is associated with a high predictive value. Scales for the suicide risk are mostly used for safety 
evaluation and not for efficacy. Depression rating scales are commonly used, but these are better 
measures of the severity of depression than of the suicide risk (Runeson et al 2017). 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Psychiatric illness is a strong predictor of suicide. More than 90 percent of patients who attempt suicide 
have a psychiatric disorder, and 95 percent of patients who successfully commit suicide have a psychiatric 
diagnosis.  
Severity of psychiatric illness is associated with risk of suicide. As an example, a meta-analysis found that 
the lifetime risk of suicide is 8.6% in patients who have had a psychiatric inpatient admission involving 
suicidal ideation, 4% in patients who have had a psychiatric admission for an affective disorder without 
suicidality, 2.2% in psychiatric outpatients, and less than 0.5% in the general population. Patients who 
have multiple psychiatric comorbidities appear to be at higher risk than those with uncomplicated 
depression or an anxiety disorder. 
The psychiatric disorders most commonly associated with suicide include depression, bipolar disorder, 
alcoholism or other substance abuse, schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorders including 
panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorders, and delirium. Among patients with depression, a history of 
suicide attempts correlated most strongly with feelings of worthlessness. Concurrent personality disorder 
was also strongly correlated with suicide attempts in depressed patients.  
Anxiety disorders more than double the risk of suicide attempts (odds ratio 2.2), and a combination of 
depression and anxiety greatly increases the risk (odds ratio 17). Symptoms of psychosis (delusions, 
command auditory hallucinations, paranoia) may increase the risk regardless of the specific diagnosis 
(Uptodate.com Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults, accessed March 2020).

Alterations in the glutamate signalling may have a role in depression pathogenesis. It has also been 
suggested that there are differences in the glutamate system between patients with MDD with or without 
suicidal ideation (Zhao et al. 2016). 
In addition, emergence of suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB) has been reported as an adverse drug 
reaction following administration of a pharmacological treatment; this is referred to as 
treatment-emergent SIB. Treatment emergent SIB has been associated with a number of medicines used 
to treat psychiatric conditions (e.g. antidepressants and some antiepileptics), with other products 
targeting the CNS (e.g. products for smoking cessation and weight loss) and also with products for 
non-CNS conditions (e.g. tretinoins, beta blockers and reserpine).  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
While the link between suicide and mental disorders (in particular, depression and alcohol use disorders) 
is well established in high-income countries, many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis with 
a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems, relationship break-up or 
chronic pain and illness (WHO.int mental health/suicide accessed March 2020). 
Patients with expressed suicidal ideation should be queried on the nature of the ideation, plans and 
methods and intent to act. Risk factors, prior history of suicide attempts, comorbid disorders and family 
history of suicidality should be assessed (Wasserman et al 2012). Whether a patient will undertake their 
intent of suicide is difficult to predict, as there are no identified factors which would determine the course 
of suicidal ideation and behaviour (Pirkis et al. 2002, Kapur et al 2005). 
Suicidal behaviours are complex. Research and evidence indicate that no single cause or stressor alone 
can explain a suicidal act. The foundation of prevention is to understand what puts a person at risk 
(WHO.int mental health/suicide accessed March 2020). 
Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in people who die by suicide (Hawton et al 2013).  
Management 
Patients with MDD who have a current suicidal ideation reflect an acutely ill population that requires 
immediate intervention. Management of the suicidal individual should include: 
• 
Hospitalisation 
•  Medical stabilization 
• 
Reducing immediate risk and treatment planning 
•  Managing underlying factors and psychiatric disorders 
•  Monitoring and follow-up (Uptodate.com Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults, accessed March 
2020). 
However, there are no approved pharmacological treatments for the rapid reduction of the symptoms of 
depression and suicidality in such patients. Furthermore, only limited information is available to guide 
clinical decisions, since this population has typically been excluded from antidepressant drug trials in the 
past. Current standard practice includes initiation or optimization of oral antidepressants and, frequently, 
hospitalization. Standard antidepressants may take several weeks to exert their full effect, limiting their 
Assessment report

Page 14/163 
 
 
 
utility in crisis situations. Additionally, hospitalizations are temporary and not completely effective, and 
the risks for attempted and completed suicide remain high in the weeks immediately after discharge.  
Some studies in the literature suggest that patients with MDD who have suicidal ideation show a worse 
response to antidepressant treatment than MDD patients without suicidal ideation. In one study 
evaluating the response to a new antidepressant after 6 weeks of treatment in 4,041 depressed 
outpatients, suicidal patients were less likely to improve or attain remission than non-suicidal patients. In 
the multivariate analyses, active suicidal ideation (odds ratio] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
1.18-1.65) and a history of suicide attempt (odds ratio = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.16-1.66) were the best 
predictors of non-remission, independent of the class of antidepressant treatment.  
There is a clear unmet medical need for the treatment of patients who suffer from suicidal ideation and/or 
behaviour. There are options such as structured and protective environment for the management of the 
suicidality of these patients. If the patients can be identified most important rapid management would still 
be hospitalization and oral antidepressants. Clear benefit would have been if outpatient pharmacological 
treatment became possible.  
According to the applicant esketamine is expected to address this unmet need due to its novel mechanism 
of action and demonstrated ability to act quickly (within hours to days) to relieve symptoms of depression 
in this severely ill population. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
There is increasing evidence that the glutamate system and molecular mechanisms related to synaptic 
and neuronal plasticity may play a role in the pathology of depression, and alterations in glutamate 
signaling have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of suicide.  
Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine, is a non-selective, noncompetitive antagonist of the 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. The mechanism by which 
esketamine exerts its antidepressant effect is unknown, but evidence within the literature suggests that, 
through NMDA receptor antagonism, esketamine produces a transient increase in glutamate release 
leading to increases in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) 
stimulation and subsequently to increases in neurotrophic signaling that restore synaptic function. Unlike 
other antidepressant therapies, esketamine’s primary antidepressant action does not directly involve 
monoamine, γ-amino butyric acid-ergic (GABA), or opioid receptors. Thus, esketamine offers a novel 
mechanism of action compared with other antidepressants.. A summary of pharmacologic evidence 
supporting the presumed mechanism of action for esketamine in depression has been previously 
presented in the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) submitted for the TRD indication.  
Spravato is a nasal spray formulation of esketamine. The esketamine drug product is a clear and 
colourless solution of esketamine HCl in Water for Injection at a concentration of 161.4 mg/mL and an 
esketamine base equivalent concentration of 140 mg/mL. The pharmaceutical form approved for 
marketing is a nasal spray solution with one presentation: a 28-mg single-use nasal spray device.

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The efficacy and safety of esketamine in the proposed indication are primarily supported by the results of 
two identically designed Phase 3 studies (54135419SUI3001 and 54135419SUI3002) and one Phase 2 
proof-of-concept study (ESKETINSUI2001). These studies evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability 
of esketamine nasal spray (84 mg, given twice weekly over 4 weeks) in addition to comprehensive 
standard of care (SOC), including antidepressant therapy and initial hospitalization, in adults with MDSI. 
In addition, the Council for International Organization of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) reports for deaths, 
other serious adverse events (SAEs), and pregnancies are provided for an ongoing open-label extension 
study in adult and elderly subjects with TRD (54135419TRD3008), an ongoing blinded study in pediatric 
subjects with MDSI (ESKETINSUI2002), and two ongoing blinded studies in adults with TRD 
(ESKETINTRD2005 and ESKETINTRD3006) (see Table 4 from the Clinical Overview). No new or additional 
Phase 1 clinical pharmacology or biopharmaceutic studies were conducted for the target indication. 
Of note, the short-term and long-term safety data generated in the TRD program are considered 
supportive for the Type II Variation for patients with moderate to severe MDD who have active suicidal 
ideation with intent. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) 
diagnosis of MDD encompasses patients with TRD as well as patients who have active suicidal ideation 
with intent. Within the DSM-5 there is no diagnostic distinction for these subgroups. In the absence of a 
fully elucidated etiology of depression, a shared pathophysiology of the primary condition, MDD, can be 
assumed for these populations. The safety profile of esketamine has been thoroughly characterized within 
the TRD program, which includes extensive exposure to esketamine. Across the completed and ongoing 
Phase 3 TRD studies as of 31 December 2018, exposure to esketamine nasal spray was 611 patient-years 
at the 56-mg dose level and 1,151 patient-years at the 84-mg dose level.  
A pre-submission meeting was held with the Rapporteur (BfArM) and Co-Rapporteur (MEB) on 25 October 
2019. The CHMP indicated that the clinical package in principle appeared adequate to support the 
submission of a Type II new indication variation. The adopted meeting minutes have been provided. 
The  applicant  received  scientific  advice  on  the  MDSI  program  from  the  CHMP  on  19  December  2013 
(EMEA/H/SA/2406/1/FU/1/2013/II),  with  follow-up  scientific  advice  received  on  10  November  2016 
(EMEA/H/SA/2406/1/FU/4/2016/II).  The  applicant  also  received  qualification  advice  for  the  Suicide 
Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool (SIBAT) on 24 July 2014 (EMEA/H/SAB/051/1/QA/2014) and on 
13 December 2018 (EMEA/H/SAB/051/1/FU/1/2018). The applicant has also received separate scientific 
advice  from  the  CHMP  on  quality  (EMEA/H/SA/2406/1/FU/3/2015/I)  and  clinical  pharmacology 
(EMEA/H/SA/2406/1/FU/5/ 2017/I) aspects of the development program for esketamine.

In the provided scientific advices, the appropriateness of the sought indication was discussed. The CHMP 
highlighted  that  the  wording  of  the  indication  depends  largely  on  whether  correlation  of  depressive 
symptoms and suicidality is shown. Design of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies were also discussed, and 
the  applicant’s  strategy  with  respect  to  clinical  data  package  and  filing  of  the  application.  The  CHMP 
considered in principle the proposed patient population acceptable, however it was emphasized that the 
included  patient  population  should  reflect  the  real-life  patients  admitted  to  emergency  care  due  to 
suicidality. With respect to endpoints, it was emphasized that the SIBAT should be validated before the 
commencement of Phase 3, should the applicant wish to use it as a key secondary endpoint to measure 
suicidality.  Other  relevant  endpoints  to  address  suicidality  were  also  mentioned  (e.g.  MADRS-SI 
sub-item).

The CGI-SS-R summarizes the clinician’s overall impression of severity of suicidality on a 7-point scale 
from  0  (normal,  not  at  all  suicidal)  to  6  (among  the  most  extremely  suicidal  patients),  based  on  the 
totality of information available to the clinician, including information from the completed modules of the 
SIBAT.  In  the  qualification  advice  for  SIBAT,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  although  the  SIBAT  derived 
CGI-SS-R has face validity, a confirmation that it can be used as key secondary efficacy endpoint cannot 
be given. It was considered that further research is needed to evaluate the responsiveness of the SIBAT 
global clinical ratings to changes in clinical status. As such the planned phase 3 studies with intranasal 
esketamine in patients with MDD at imminent risk of suicide were considered to be an important step. 
The applicant is developing esketamine nasal spray for the treatment of major depressive disorder with 
imminent risk for suicide (MDSI) in adolescents (12 to <18 years). The Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) 
was agreed with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) in December 2016. The applicant is planning to 
conduct 3 paediatric clinical studies in adolescents with MDSI, including 2 double-blind (DB) and 
psychoactive placebo-controlled clinical studies and 1 open-label (OL) safety study. Approximately half of 
the planned 145 subjects have been randomized in the ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept study. The 
entire paediatric program is expected to take approximately 8 years to complete.

2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
There is a statement from the applicant that all studies included in this submission were conducted and 
reported in accordance with the ethical principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki and in 
accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and in compliance with the respective protocols. 
This was considered sufficient by the CHMP. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
 The applicant submitted a justification for absence of an environmental risk assessment for the 
esketamine MDSI indication variation application. 
The patient population related to the current submission is adults with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 
assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide (hereafter referred to as MDSI). MDSI is a subgroup of the 
patient population of depressive disorders (i.e. MDD) as defined in the initial submission for the TRD 
indication. As such, the MDSI indication does not extend the depressive disorder population, and 
therefore there is no increase in environmental exposure versus the exposure calculated for the current 
approved TRD indication. Consequently, the conclusions of the initial ERA are still valid and no updated 
ERA for esketamine is required to support this MDSI variation application submission. 
A complete ERA for the active ingredient esketamine was provided within procedure EMEA/H/C/4535. 
Esketamine was not expected to pose a risk to the surface water, groundwater and sediment 
compartment as all risk quotients are below 1. Assessment of the risk to the terrestrial compartment was 
considered not necessary. Esketamine was not a potential PBT substance. However, the active substance 
has to be classified as very persistent in sediments due to the half-life (DT50) of 738.4 days (normalised 
to 12 °C, the average outdoor temperature in the EU).  
The new indication does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure of esketamine and 
therefore the CHMP agreed with the applicant, an update of the existing ERA is not required.  
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of esketamine.   
Any changes in the dosage and duration of treatment will require an updated ERA. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The clinical pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of esketamine is supported by a large global clinical 
development program, including 19 Phase 1 studies, two Phase 2a studies with existing IV formulations

of esketamine or ketamine, six completed Phase 2 and 3 studies with esketamine nasal spray in patients 
with TRD (a Phase 2 dose-ranging study, three short-term Phase 3 studies, and two long-term Phase 3 
studies), and one ongoing Phase 3 open-label (OL) safety extension study. Over 1,700 adults were 
exposed to esketamine nasal spray in the completed Phase 2 and 3 studies in adults with TRD. The newly 
proposed indication is supported by two phase pivotal and one phase 2 studies (Table 3).

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new biopharmaceutical or pharmacokinetic studies were performed to support the so-called MDSI 
indication. The Phase 3 MDSI clinical studies used the same esketamine formulation and nasal spray 
device that was used in the Phase 3 TRD studies. 
Additional analyses were performed to support the claimed indication, namely a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis and exposure-response analyses for both efficacy (MADRS) and safety (systolic 
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, CADSS). The provided pharmacokinetic analyses are considered 
not to have an impact on the benefit-risk assessment in the proposed indication. Other concerns on the

Non-chiral LC-MS/MS assays for the quantification of esketamine and noresketamine in human heparin 
plasma were developed and validated at Contract Research Organization Frontage Laboratories, Exton, 
USA. 
The methods consist of a solid phase extraction sample preparation after addition of stable isotope 
labelled internal standards (ketamine-D4 and norketamine-D4). The resulting extracts were evaporated 
to dryness, reconstituted and then injected on a reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) column using a gradient method. Detection was done by tandem mass spectrometry in the 
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with TurboIonSprayTM ionization in the positive ion mode. 
Initially, in 2012 a manual solid phase extraction (SPE) method using individual SPE cartridges was 
developed and validated (method BTM-1487). Later, in 2016, a more automated SPE method was 
developed and validated using equivalent 96 well SPE plates (method BTM-2246). Both methods produce 
equivalent results as demonstrated by a cross validation with quality control samples. 
The validation of the analytical methods (BTM-1487 and BTM-2246) has been assessed and approved 
previously. Studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 used BTM-2246. Methods are also validated within study and 
bioanalytical reports have been provided (JNJ-R7964 and JNJ-R7870).   
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The dosing regimen used in the double-blind phase of the MDSI Phase 2 proof-of-concept study SUI2001 
included 4-week treatment with esketamine 84 mg + SOC. The esketamine dose could be reduced at any 
time after the first dose to 56 mg for subsequent doses if a subject was unable to tolerate 84 mg. This 
regimen was agreed upon based on results from Phase 2 studies conducted in patients with TRD and with 
input from health authorities.  
The esketamine dose (84 mg) was selected for this program based on efficacy, safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetic data obtained with the esketamine nasal spray formulation and intravenous esketamine 
in the Phase 2 studies conducted in subjects with TRD. The aim was to yield the mean maximum 
concentration (Cmax) achieved with intravenous esketamine 0.4 mg/kg (corresponding to absolute doses 
of ~ 26 to 36 mg) that demonstrated efficacy in Study ESKETIVTRD2001 (135 ng/mL). While a lower 
intravenous esketamine dose (0.2 mg/kg) was also efficacious in ESKETIVTRD2001, given that the Phase 
2 and Phase 3 MDSI studies were being conducted in the context of an acute illness, the 84 mg dose was 
selected to provide the greatest opportunity for rapid onset of efficacy, with acceptable tolerability. 
The relationship between the change from baseline in MADRS total score (∆MADRS) at 24 hours after the 
first dose in the Phase 3 MDSI studies and esketamine exposure was investigated as the primary 
endpoint. Results of the analysis support selection of the 84-mg dose of esketamine to achieve rapid and 
robust improvement in depressive symptoms since a linear relationship between placebo-corrected 
∆MADRS and esketamine area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) has been submitted 
with this application (please see also below). 
Dose Reductions in the Phase 3 Studies  
The majority of subjects in the Phase 3 studies were able to tolerate the assigned 84 mg dose of 
esketamine per protocol. Dose reductions in the pooled studies during the double-blind treatment phase 
were as follows: 
- 
- 
45 of 226 subjects (19.9%) treated with esketamine + SOC in the full efficacy analysis set 
received a reduced dose of esketamine on at least 1 dosing day. 
35 subjects (15.5%) in the esketamine + SOC group had a protocol-permitted, one-time dose 
reduction (and received the 56-mg dose during all subsequent dosing sessions) due to adverse

events or tolerability issues (33 subjects), investigator discretion based on expected side effects 
(1 subject), and Interactive Web Response System user error (1 subject).  
- 
The change in MADRS total score over time was also evaluated for the 35 subjects who required 
a dose reduction during the double-blind treatment phase. The findings in these subjects were 
consistent with the results of the primary analysis  
- 
5 subjects did not administer all 3 devices (and did not receive an 84-mg dose) during at least 1 
dosing session due to adverse events or tolerability issues that occurred during dose 
administration. A dose reduction was not entered in the Interactive Web Response System for 
these subjects. 
- 
5 subjects received partial doses of esketamine during at least 1 dosing session (and an 84-mg 
dose during the other dosing sessions) for reasons other than adverse events or tolerability (ie, 
issues with device administration, site or user error, refusal to administer third device).

Population PK analysis 
The previously developed population PK model was used (Population Pharmacokinetics Report 
JNJ-54135419 (Esketamine). Department of Global Clinical Pharmacology. Janssen Research & 
Development, 20 July 2018.). It was an open, linear, three-compartment disposition model for 
esketamine and an open, linear two-compartment disposition model for noresketamine in combination 
with a separate hepato-portal-compartment (“first-pass model”). Age, Japanese and Asian subjects, 
were statistically associated with esketamine or noresketamine  pharmacokinetic parameters. Relative to 
non-Asians, the Asian population showed a 64.0% and 19.4% decrease in the esketamine metabolism 
rate constant (kel) and the apparent clearance of noresketamine (CLn/F), respectively. The Japanese 
subjects exhibited a 34% increase in FRn, relative to other subjects. The hepatic blood flow (Qh) 
decreased at a rate 21.9 L/h×10 years from 60 years onwards. 
1)  Exploratory analysis  
The SUI3001 and SUI3002 were graphically explored for concentration and/or time effects and assist in 
identifying potential aberrant data. In addition, the exploratory graphical analysis of every quantitative 
covariate consisted of a histogram, box plots and plots of quartiles of covariate distributions and quantiles 
of standard normal distribution (QQ plot). 
2)  External model evaluation  
was performed to verify the predictive performance of the previously developed population model for the 
current analysis dataset.  
VPC and pcVPC the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of the observed esketamine and noresketamine data 
were compared with the model-based predicted percentiles for each bin across time and replicates. A 
total of 100 replicates of the analysis dataset were generated and used for each analysis.  
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 24/163 
 
 
 
 
A maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation using the previously developed population model as prior 
information was used to estimate the Empirical Bayes Estimates (EBE’s) of the random effect for subjects 
included in the studies SUI3001 and SUI3002. This analysis was conducted using the MAXEVAL=0 option 
in NONMEM. The GOF plots were graphically assessed by the examination of scatterplots of observed data 
versus population/individual predictions. 
The NPC was performed on the mean and the standard deviation (SD) of the exposure metrics (AUCinf 
and Cmax), since these reflect the central tendency and the variability of the esketamine exposure 
metrics. The model-based distribution of the mean and SD of the esketamine exposure metrics across 
replicates was obtained and its 2.5th and 97.5th percentile was used to calculate the lower and upper limit 
of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the model-based predicted mean and SD of the exposure metrics, 
which were then compared to the actual metric of exposure obtained from the SUI3001 and SUI3002 
studies.  
3)  Since the sparse sampling implemented in the SUI3001 and SUI3002 studies to characterise the 
esketamine and noresketamine PK, does not allow to directly estimate the parameter values by 
fitting the model directly to the data, the MAP estimation using the previously developed 
population model as prior information was used to derive the individual PK parameters. The 
accuracy and precision of the structural model previously developed was verified17 by showing 
similar parameter estimates obtained using intensively sampled PK data of study TRD1009 
including 3 different routes of administration (oral, IV and intranasal) and the updated PK 
parameter estimates after a pooled PK analysis of TRD data. 
Results 
Overall, 1225 esketamine and 1225 noresketamine samples from 220 subjects were available in the 
analysis dataset. 
A total of 104 (7.8%) esketamine and 104 (7.8%) noresketamine plasma concentration were excluded. 
There were 7 subjects with no measurable PK concentrations. For these subjects, the typical model based 
PK concentrations were derived from the typical PK parameters taking into account the individual 
demographic values. In this way, these subjects were included in the efficacy and safety analysis. 
Graphical exploration: 
Asian subjects (12.7%) have a similar exposure for esketamine and a tendency of increased exposure for 
noresketamine (Figure 5 of the POPPK report). Due to the limited sample size, a similar exploratory 
analysis exercise could not be performed for subjects older than 60 years (5.3%) or Japanese subjects 
(0%). 
External evaluation: 
The central tendency and variability in the observed plasma concentrations of esketamine and 
noresketamine in the SUI3001 and SUI3002 studies were similar to the model-predicted central tendency 
and variability for esketamine as well as noresketamine plasma concentrations (VPC Figure 8 of the POPK 
report). These results indicated the model is able to describe the time course of esketamine and 
noresketamine plasma concentrations and its associated variability well.  
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 25/163 
 
 
 
 
 
The GOF plots (Figure 9 of the POPK report) show the previously developed PK model adequately 
describes the central tendency in the PK of esketamine well; however, noresketamine shows a minor 
underprediction at high plasma concentrations, not confirmed in the VPC. Therefore, the previously 
developed PopPK model adequately described the esketamine and noresketamine PK in subjects enrolled 
in the SUI3001 and SUI3002 studies and no model updates were required.  
The NPC demonstrated that the model was appropriate to describe the mean esketamine AUCinf and 
Cmax as the observed means were contained within the 95%CI of the model predictions (Figure 10 of the 
report). However, the SD of esketamine Cmax was slightly (<10%) below the 95%CI of predictions, 
which could be related to the shrinkage (Figure 11 of the POPK report) due to the sparse sampling scheme 
used in studies SUI3001 and SUI3002. 
The model-based distribution of the mean and SD of the esketamine exposure metrics across replicates 
was obtained and its 2.5th and 97.5th percentile was used to calculate the lower and upper limit of the 
95% confidence interval (CI) of the model-based predicted mean and SD of the exposure metrics, which 
were then compared to the actual metric of exposure obtained from the SUI3001 and SUI3002 studies.   
Table 6: PopPK-1 (Table 6 of the PopPK report): Summary of subjects’ relevant demographic 
baseline  characteristics of included subjects in the popPK analysis (SUI3001 and SUI3002) 
versus all subjects included in development dataset (TRD) 
The PK analysis dataset of studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 comprised of 1,329 esketamine and 1,329 
noresketamine plasma concentrations from 227 subjects receiving nasal esketamine and SOC. However, 
a total of 104 (7.8%) esketamine and 104 (7.8%) noresketamine plasma concentration were excluded. 
Main reason for exclusion was the lack of sampling times (n = 94 for both esketamine and noresketamine) 
and sample BQL (n = 9 for both esketamine and noresketamine).

The applicant conducted a pre-specified external validation of a previously developed popPK model (see 
also EMEA/H/C/004535/0000) based on phase 2 and 3 data obtained mainly for patients with 
treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, but also one study in major depressive disorder to be at 
imminent risk for suicide (SUI2001). The external validation was performed on data of SUI3001 and 
SUI3002. In general, the pcVPC indicates that the central tendency for both esketamine and 
noresketamine is adequately reflected. For esketamine, there is a slight underestimation around 5 hours 
in the 95th percentile and, for noresketamine, there is an overestimation around 2 hours in the 5th 
percentile. The influence on the estimates of AUC and Cmax is expected to be minimal. However, from the 
structural model, it is clear that the elimination rate constant from the compartment representing the 
hepato-portal system, causes parameter identifiability issues. As a consequence, multiple parameter 
solutions are available that result in a similar model fit, which could have affected the estimates of AUCinf 
and Cmax . Therefore, the current estimates of AUC and Cmax cannot be trusted yet. The applicant was 
requested to provide a condition number of the population pharmacokinetic model. Furthermore, the 
applicant was requested to test  for input–output reachability of the structural model. Several methods 
are described by Bonate (Bonate PL. 2012. Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and simulation. 
Springer), of which the easiest approach is simulation-based. Finally, the applicant was also asked to 
evaluate and discuss the potential impact on AUCinf and Cmax.  
Individual estimates of exposure of esketamine and noresketamine:

The reference model was further used to generate the individual PopPK Empirical Bayes parameter 
estimates to derive the individual predicted esketamine plasma concentrations at timepoints of blood 
pressure measurements used for the exposure safety analysis and to allow prediction of individual 
exposure parameters Cmax and AUCinf used for the exposure efficacy analysis (Table PopPK-2, i.e. Table 
7 of the report). 
A contingency table (Table 8 of the POPK report) was constructed to investigate whether any potential 
confounding bias may exist between the exposure metrics (i.e., quartile of exposures) and the 
stratification factors in the studies SUI3001 and SUI3002. The counts and percentages of the number of 
subjects within each stratification factor category were well balanced by treatment arm (placebo + SOC 
vs esketamine + SOC) as well as by the quartiles of the esketamine exposure. 
Table 7: PopPK-2 (Table 7 of the report): Summary Statistics of Model Predicted Esketamine 
and Noresketamine AUCinf and Cmax 
Questions were raised on the Population PK model, such as why is the y-axis dose normalised to 84 mg, 
if the participants of studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 have all been treated with 84 mg? Have some 
participants received other doses? Additionally in this context, if the participants of studies SUI3001 and 
SUI3002 have all been treated with 84 mg, it is not clear why exposure for the 56 mg dosage is given. 
Data on VPCs and GOF plots reveal that the previously developed population PK model seems to be 
applicable to the data obtained from studies SUI3001 and E SUI3002. Thus, it is anticipated that dose 
recommendations will be the same for patients with MDSI as for patients with TRD. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted with this type II variation application. 
Esketamine hydrochloride (HCl) is currently assigned to two Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) 
classification codes: Psychoanaleptics/Other antidepressants (N06AX27) and Anaesthetics/Other general 
anaesthetics (N01AX14). The applicant petitioned the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborative 
Center for Drug Statistics Methodology to assign the additional ATC code for esketamine under the N06AX 
group of “Other Antidepressants” to clearly differentiate between the utilization of esketamine nasal spray 
in the treatment of depression-related indications and the use of IM or IV esketamine in anesthesia. The 
new ATC code (N06AX27) was published as “Final” by WHO in May 2019 for esketamine nasal 
formulations indicated for MDD.

Mechanism of action 
Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine, is a non-selective, non-competitive antagonist of the 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor.  
The mechanism by which esketamine exerts its antidepressant effect is unknown, but evidence within the 
literature suggests that, through NMDA receptor antagonism, esketamine produces a transient increase 
in glutamate release leading to increases in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid 
receptor (AMPAR) stimulation and subsequently to increases in neurotrophic signalling that restore 
synaptic function. Unlike other antidepressant therapies, esketamine’s primary antidepressant action 
does not directly involve monoamine, γ-amino butyric acid-ergic (GABA), or opioid receptors.  
A summary of pharmacologic evidence supporting the presumed mechanism of action for esketamine in 
depression was presented previously in the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) submitted for the 
TRD indication.  
There may be evidence that the glutamate system and molecular mechanisms related to synaptic and 
neuronal plasticity could play a role in the pathology of depression, and alterations in glutamate signalling 
have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of suicide. The latter condition has not been established 
yet. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
The applicant has not performed any primary pharmacodynamic in vivo studies in humans, because direct 
measurement of NMDAR inhibition in humans is hardly applicable (Spravato EPAR, EMA website accessed 
March 2020).  
The primary and secondary pharmacological properties of esketamine are being investigated and these 
have been already described (Spravato Product Information). Esketamine is the S-enantiomer of racemic 
ketamine. Through NMDA receptor antagonism, esketamine causes increases in 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) stimulation and subsequently 
to increases in neurotrophic signalling which may contribute to the restoration of synaptic function in 
these brain regions involved with the regulation of mood and emotional behaviour. Restoration of 
dopaminergic neurotransmission in brain regions involved in the reward and motivation, and decreased 
stimulation of brain regions involved in anhedonia, may contribute to the rapid response.  
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Population Pharmacokinetics and Exposure Response (Efficacy and Safety) Report 
JNJ-54135419 Date: 10 December 2019 
Exposure- Response analyses 
The analyses assume that for model comparisons, p-values lower than 0.05 is statistically significant. No 
correction for multiple statistical testing was implemented. 
Exposure metrics for esketamine 
As only one dose was tested previously, where the average dose had the strongest statistical association 
with the efficacy endpoint was not suitable to analyse the current dataset. 
The exposure metrics AUCinf and Cmax for esketamine were computed after single-dose, as no 
accumulation of esketamine was seen in the twice-weekly dosing regimen used in the phase 3 studies. 
These exposure metrics were calculated for the dose that is related to the time-point when the MADRS 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 30/163 
 
 
 
Total Score was measured, so that the exposure metrics within a subject will change if the dose changed 
during the treatment duration. The exposure metrics were derived based on the maximum a posteriori 
estimates of the individual PK model parameters for esketamine, which were obtained from the plasma 
concentrations collected in the studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 and the previously developed PopPK model. 
For the safety analyses, the ER analysis was performed by using the predicted concentrations in plasma 
at the time of safety endpoint measurement. 
Efficacy endpoints 
1)  ∆MADRS 
2)  CGI-SS-R 
Severity of suicidality as measured by the CGI-SS-R at 24 h post first dose. The CGI-SS-R scale is module 
8 of suicide ideation and behaviour assessment tool (SIBAT), consisting of 6 categories. Those six 
categories were dichotomized into a group with a CGI-SS-R score <2 and a CGI-SS-R score ≥2. We 
explored the probability of having a CGI-SS-R < 2 at 24 hours post first dose. 
Covariates explored: age, race, gender, prior suicide attempt status, baseline MADRS Total Score 
(MADRS0), type of SOC and class of oral antidepressant (Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake 
Inhibitors (SSRI) or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI)). 
No dose-response was assessed as only one dose (i.e. 84 mg) was given per protocol. However, the 
predictability of esketamine exposure (AUCinf and Cmax) on the MADRS and CGI-SS-R was explored. 
1)  An exploratory data analysis was conducted to present change from baseline MADRS and 
CGI-SS-R, to assist in identifying aberrant data and potential outliers, and to explore the 
relationships (correlations) between covariates, which may have helped in building a covariate 
model and avoid the confounding bias. 
2)  The purpose of the exposure-efficacy analysis was to assess the longitudinal relationship between 
esketamine systemic exposure and change from baseline in MADRS Total Score in studies 
SUI3001 and SUI3002. The analysis was based on a general exposure-efficacy model for the 
MADRS change from baseline (ΔMADRS(t)), also applied for the ER modelling of ΔMADRS(t) for 
the TRD indication. 
3)  The probability of having a CGI-SS-R score below 2 (P(CGI-SS-R<2)) was assessed by evaluating 
the proportion of subjects who achieved a CGI-SS-R score below 2, in the double-blind phase of 
the studies SUI3001 and SUI3002. 
The proportion of subjects at the scheduled assessment time points (Days 1(4h), 2, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 
25), who had a CGI-SS-R score below 2 in the double-blind phase of the study, for different treatment 
groups and prior suicide attempt status were calculated from the data. The proportion was calculated as 
the number of subjects achieving a CGI-SS-R < 2 divided by the total number of subjects who had 
CGI-SS-R measurements at that time-point. No imputation was performed for missing data. In addition, 
a possible relationship between esketamine exposure and P(CGI-SS-R<2) at 24 hours post first dose was 
explored. 
The correlation between both endpoints CGI-SS-R and MADRS Total Score was investigated by regression 
analysis. 
Safety endpoints

2)  The probability of having a CADSS >4 at 40 minutes post-dose 
The purpose of the exploratory data analysis was to present diastolic and systolic BP data graphically, to 
assist in identifying aberrant data and potential outliers, and to explore the relationships (correlations) 
between covariates, which may help in building a covariate model and avoid the confounding bias. 
Previously, a PKPD model for diastolic and systolic blood pressure was developed using data from the 
three phase 3 studies conducted for the TRD indication. For the systolic blood pressure, the covariate age 
was statistically associated with systolic blood pressure at baseline. 
Previously, a PKPD model for the probability of having CADSS > 4 at 40 minutes post-dose was developed 
using data from the three phase 3 studies conducted for the TRD indication. A power model, with 
esketamine dose as predictor, on the logit scale was shown to be the best model to describe the incidence 
of CADSS > 4. 
An external model evaluation was performed to verify the predictive performance of the previously 
developed PKPD models for the current analysis datasets. GOF plots were generated for blood pressure, 
VPCs for blood pressure and CADSS. A total of 100 and 1000 replicates (blood pressure and CADSS, 
respectively) of the analysis dataset were generated and used for each analysis. 
Results 
Longitudinal Exposure-Efficacy Analysis 
From the Full Analysis Dataset containing 452 subjects, data from 450 subjects (226 receiving nasal 
esketamine and SOC and 224 receiving nasal placebo and SOC) enrolled in SUI3001 and SUI3002 were 
included in the ER analysis. The unstructured placebo model was applied to the placebo + SOC data and 
an exploratory graphical analysis of the different covariates was performed. In order to account for the 
effect of MADRS0 as in the primary statistical analysis, and be consistent with the model developed for 
TRD population, the MADRS0 was incorporated in the model (ΔOFV = -75.75; df=1; p<0.001). A drug 
effect, linearly related to the esketamine AUCinf, performed better compared to a constant drug effect 
(i.e. esketamine exposure independent effect - reference model) (ΔOFV = -13.75) and the slope of the 
relationship between drug effect and AUCinf was -0.00914 (RSE: 19.4%) (Figure 17 of the PK report). 
The trend of having a higher slope of the relationship between drug effect and AUCinf in subjects with 
prior suicidal attempt, -0.0121 (RSE: 19%) mL/ng.h, than in subject with not prior suicidal attempt, 
-0.00356 (RSE: 73%), was not statistically significant. However, it does suggest that for a median 
esketamine AUCinf for a 84 mg dose (390 ng.h/mL), the esketamine effect might be larger in subjects 
with a prior suicide attempt, 4.72 (95%CI: 2.96; 6.48) points, compared to subjects with no prior suicide 
attempt, 1.39 (95%CI -0.60; 3.38). The linear drug effect with 95%CI is displayed in Figure 18 of the PK 
report stratified by prior suicidal attempt status. Gender, age, weight, race, type of SOC therapy and class 
of oral antidepressant (SSRI vs. SNRI vs. other) were not associated with placebo or drug effects on 
ΔMADRS. A doubling of the MADRS0 was associated with a 2.8-fold (95%CI: 2.18; 3.57) higher decrease 
in ΔMADRS, but had no influence on the drug effect. The parameter estimates of the final model are 
presented in Table 12 of the report. GOF plots and VPCs are presented in Figure 21(Appendix 6) of the PK 
report and Figure 22. The predicted drug effect on placebo-corrected ΔMADRS (±95CI) for the mean of 
every quartile esketamine AUCinf depending on a subjects prior suicide attempt status and a baseline 
MADRS of 41is summarised in Table 13 of the PK report. 
Descriptive Analyses to Evaluate the Probability of CGI-SS-R < 2 
The data used for this analysis included 450 subjects with a total of 4,479 CGI-SS-R score evaluations 
(2234 for placebo + SOC and 2245 for esketamine + SOC) during the double-blind period from studies 
SUI3001 and SUI3002.

As the exploration of the possible relationship between esketamine exposure and P(CGI-SSR<2) at 24 
hours post first dose was not statistically significant (p>0.05), a descriptive analysis was performed. The 
P(CGI-SSR<2) increased sharply after the subjects received the initial esketamine/placebo dose on Day 
1 with the highest difference between both treatment groups at 4 hours post first dose (13%) (Figure 25 
of the PK report). Although the 95%CI between both treatment groups were largely overlapping, 
esketamine treatment resulted in numerically higher number of subjects having a P(CGI-SS-R<2) 
compared to placebo. Subjects who had a previous suicide attempt showed a lower placebo + SOC 
response compared to those who had no previous suicide attempt. For subjects who had a previous 
suicide attempt, the proportion of subjects who achieved a P(CGI-SS-R<2) was consistently higher in the 
esketamine + SOC treatment group which was not the case for subjects without a previous suicide 
attempt. Results are presented in Figure 26 and Table 15 of the PK report. 
Additionally, the correlation between the MADRS Total Score and CGI-SS-R was explored for baseline and 
24 hours post first dose by linear regression. The linear regression at baseline for the placebo + SOC 
group and esketamine + SOC group showed no difference in slope and intercept while at 24 hours post 
first dose, the slope was the same but the intercept was different (Figure 27 of the PK report). 
MADRS 
The drug effect on placebo-corrected ΔMADRS (ΔΔMADRS), linearly related to the esketamine AUCinf, 
performed better compared to an exposure independent additive drug effect (i.e. treated vs. non-treated) 
(ΔOFV = -13.75). When stratifying the analysis by prior suicide attempt status, the esketamine effect on 
ΔΔMADRS was estimated to be 4.72 (95%CI: 2.96; 6.48) points for a median esketamine AUCinf at 84 
mg dose (i.e. 390 ng.h/mL) for subjects with prior suicidal attempt. For subjects without a prior suicide 
attempt, the decrease in ΔΔMADRS for a median esketamine AUCinf at 84 mg dose (i.e. 390 ng.h/mL) 
was smaller 1.39 (95%CI: -0.60; 3.38). The parameter estimates of the exposure-efficacy model are 
presented and a VPC is presented.

Data of study SUI3001 and SUI3002 was used for this analysis. The results of the exposure-efficacy 
analysis should be interpreted with caution as only one dose-level was included in the phase 3 studies. In 
addition, further information on the estimates of AUCinf were requested.  
Longitudinal Exposure-Efficacy Analysis 
A linear relationship between ΔΔMADRS and AUCinf seems to adequately describe the data from studies  
SUI3001 and  SUI3002. The median esketamine AUCinf for a 84 mg dose was 390 ng.h/mL.  In 
participants with a prior suicide attempt, the effect was about 4.72 (95%CI: 2.96; 6.48) points. In 
participants with no prior suicide attempt, the effect was 1.39 (95%CI -0.60; 3.38) (Table 8). 
The analysis indicates that the influence of AUCinf on the placebo corrected change from baseline in 
MADRS is larger in patients with a prior suicide attempt compared to patients without a suicide attempt. 
For patients without a suicide attempt, the drug-effect was non-significant. A non-parametric structure 
was used to describe the placebo-effect, which was estimated separately for patients with and without a 
prior suicide attempt. The provided data indicates that the placebo-effect is different between the two 
patient groups, which could potentially be explained by differences in the MADRS at baseline. It was 
unclear whether the different drug effects identified in the two different patient populations can be 
explained by the differences in placebo-effects.   
No clear differences for CGI-SS-R can be observed between placebo and esketamine. It seems that the 
probability of achieving the CGI-SS-R<2 was numerically higher in participants receiving intranasal 
esketamine + SOC compared to treatment with placebo + SOC. The highest difference was observed 4 h 
post-dose (Figure 25). 
The applicant has performed post-hoc subgroup analyses based on prior suicide attempt, however no 
conclusions on differential effect could be made.   
Exposure-safety analysis 
Blood pressure 
The previously developed PKPD model for diastolic and systolic BP described the central tendency and 
associated variability in blood pressure in subjects receiving placebo + SOC and esketamine + SOC. GOF 
plots and VPCs are depict in Figure 32, 33, and 34 of the report, Final parameter estimates are listed in 
Table 3 of the PK report. Diastolic and systolic blood pressure in subjects with MDSI is similar to that in 
subjects with TRD included in the dataset used to develop the exposure-blood pressure models. 
Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) 
An external validation of the previously developed model (i.e. VPC) for CADSS focusing on the incidence 
of CADSS score > 4 at 40 min post-dose after every nasal esketamine/placebo dosing (i.e. maximum of 
8 events per subject) showed that the previously developed model could describe the CADSS data from 
the two phase 3 studies (Figure 36 of the PK report). 
Assessment report

Exposure-safety analysis 
Regarding the VPCs and GOF plots presented in this report, the previously developed model for blood 
pressure seem to be applicable for the data obtained from studies  SUI3001 and  SUI3002. 
Regarding the logistic regression model for the CADSS (as developed previously for the TRD indication) it 
is not clear on what the results for the 56 mg does in Figure 36 of the PK report are based, since in studies  
SUI3001 and SUI3002 only 84 mg were given. However, as shown in Figure 36 of the PK report, the 
probability of experiencing CADSS > 4 (40 min post-dose) is mostly lower for the 84 mg compared to a 
56 mg dose. This required further explanation and justification which was provided satisfactorily by the 
company. The company was also requested to provide results for the probability of experiencing CADSS 
> 4 (40 min post-dose) by concentrations, dose, age and gender over time, as presented in Figure 48 for 
TRD in the Exposure response (efficacy and safety) Report EDMS-ERI-166762698, 07 August 2018. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
For the extension of the indication in the context of this type II variation no further pharmacodynamic 
data are needed, since esketamine is proposed to be used in a subgroup of depressed patients.   
There were however, as mentioned above, a few concerns on the population pharmacokinetic and 
exposure response (PK/PD) model that were resolved during the assessment. 
No new bioavailability, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies have been submitted. A population 
PK model has been further developed using pharmacokinetic data from the two phase 3 studies (SUI3001 
and SUI3002). However, certain issues with respect to the results for the 56mg and the probability of 
experiencing CADSS>4 and further analysis of it had to be clarified.   
Despite the fact that the mechanism of action of esketamine in depression has not been fully elucidated, 
it is known that esketamine is a non-selective, non-competitive, antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA) receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor.   
In accordance with the protocol, subjects in Studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 could have a one-time dose 
reduction any time after the first dose (and for all subsequent doses) to 56 mg if the subject was unable 
to tolerate the 84 mg dose. In addition, some subjects administered two devices (a 56 mg dose) instead 
of three devices (an 84 mg dose) on Day 1 of the double-blind treatment period due to adverse events 
(AEs)/tolerability during study drug administration. Therefore, the esketamine plasma concentrations in 
Figure 8 of the population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) report were dose-normalized, and for those subjects 
who received a 56 mg dose, the exposure and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) 
scores for the 56 mg dose level were provided. 
The y-axis was normalized to 84 mg because not all patients were treated with 84 mg. Dose reduction to 
56 mg was permitted if a 84 mg dose was not tolerated. Then the issue was considered as resolved. 
Patients allocated in the 56 mg group had received a dose reduction due to tolerability problems. Because 
patients were not randomly allocated to this dosing group, it could be that these patients showed a higher 
sensitivity to esketamine and therefore had a higher probability to suffer from a CADSS>4.  
The company provided figures plotting the proportion of subjects experiencing CADSS >4 (40 minutes 
postdose) by concentrations, dose, age, and gender as a function of time (ie, with increase of the number 
of nasal esketamine administrations). 
Similar to what was seen in the TRD studies, an increased probability of having CADSS >4 at 40 minutes 
postdose was observed in the SUI3001 and SUI3002 studies in subjects who were treated with 
esketamine compared to placebo. In addition, the proportion of subjects having a CADSS score >4 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 38/163 
 
 
 
showed a decrease as a function of time suggesting development of tolerance, which was also observed 
in the analysis in the TRD population and implemented in the logistic regression model. A similar profile 
was observed for subjects who received 56 mg or 84 mg, which may be explained by the relatively small 
number of subjects who received the lower dose and that subjects were not randomly assigned to the 56 
mg and 84 mg doses. However, subjects in Tercile 3 (ie, highest esketamine concentrations) exhibited 
the highest probability of having a CADSS >4 at 40 minutes postdose relative to subjects in Terciles 1 and 
2. The covariates age and gender had no influence on the probability of having a CADSS >4 at 40 minutes 
postdose. 
 From the structural model in the popPK analyses, it was clear that the elimination rate constant from the 
compartment representing the hepato-portal system, causes parameter identifiability issues. As a 
consequence, multiple parameter solutions are available that result in a similar model fit, which could 
have affected the estimates of AUCinf and Cmax . Therefore, the current estimates of AUC and Cmax could 
not be trusted. The population pharmacokinetic analysis aimed to characterise the pharmacokinetics of 
esketamine and noresketamine for subjects randomised to receive esketamine in studies SUI3001 and 
SUI3002 (patients with treatment resistant depression). The identifiability issues refer to the model 
structure of the population pharmacokinetic model and therefore apply to both analyses. Also, the 
concern is referring to structural identifiability of the model and not necessarily the numerical 
identifiability of the model parameter estimates. The structural model used in this application is displayed 
below.  
Figure 6: Structural Model 
The inclusion of an elimination pathway (parameterized with kel) from the hepato-portal system results in 
irreversible loss of drug (esketamine) from the system, but no observations are taken from this 
compartment. Therefore, even though it is acknowledged that the model could be mechanistically 
plausible, the parameter estimates could be influenced by this parameterization and multiple solutions 
can be identified. It is acknowledged that the model parameters are estimated with accurate precision, 
but if a model is numerically identifiable, this does not necessarily mean that the model is also structurally 
identifiable. It was reassuring to note however that the condition number of the model is low, indicating 
that the model is stable.  
The applicant has tested input-output reachability by using stochastic simulation and estimation. 
However, in order to test input-output reachability, simulations should be conducted without 
between-subject and residual error to identify whether model parameters can be estimated in the 
absence of random error. The model should converge within a few iterations if the model structure is 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 39/163 
 
 
 
  
identifiable. Other approaches are also suitable, such as suggested by Shivva et al. 2013 CPT PSP. As a 
result, it is still unclear whether the model is structurally identifiable. The consequences despite not 
deemed major  should be considered in future applications. 
The provided NPCs also relate to numerical stability of the model. These graphs demonstrate that the 
model has good predictive performance to estimate AUC and Cmax parameters. However, the graphs do 
not demonstrate the influence of possible identifiability issues. Nonetheless, the pharmacokinetic 
parameters of all populations exposed to esketamine have been estimated using this model structure. 
Therefore, if the parameter estimates would change substantially due to a different unique solution, this 
would apply for all populations. No clear differences between populations can be observed. Therefore, this 
issue was considered as solved.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic properties of intranasal esketamine have been investigated adequately during the 
marketing authorisation application for TRD.  
The primary and secondary pharmacological properties of esketamine are already described in the 
approved product information.   
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
There was no formal dose-response study submitted in support of this type II variation application. 
For the development program for the imminent risk of suicide or suicidal ideation in depressed patients, 
an esketamine dose of 84 mg was chosen for the initial Phase 2 proof-of-concept study (SUI2001) in 
subjects with the so-called MDSI (major depressive disorder in patients assessed to be at imminent risk 
for suicide). The rationale for this dose selection was based on the fact that the so-called condition MDSI 
requires rapid and robust intervention. The 84 mg dose of esketamine (with an option to reduce to the 56 
mg dose) was selected to provide the greatest opportunity for rapid onset of efficacy and longer durability 
of effect, with acceptable tolerability in acutely ill patients. This regimen was implemented based on 
results from Phase 2 studies conducted in patients with TRD and with input from health authorities. Study 
treatment was initially administered in a hospital setting where any adverse effects were closely 
monitored and managed.  
Based on the findings of the Phase 2 study SUI2001, which supported a positive benefit-to-risk ratio of 
acute treatment with esketamine 84 mg in this population, the dose of 84 mg was also used in the 
subsequent Phase 3 studies of similar design.  
Spravato 84 mg twice weekly is the approved recommended dose in the induction phase in patients with 
TRD, after the starting dose of 56 mg in patients <65 years. Hence, clinical experience with 84mg 
esketamine is already available.  
2.4.2.  Main studies 
For the support of the efficacy of esketamine in the proposed indication two Phase 3 studies in subjects 
with the so-called MDSI (SUI3001 and SUI3002) have been submitted, with additional supportive 
information from the Phase 2 study (SUI2001).  
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 40/163 
 
 
 
The Phase 3 studies (SUI3001 and SUI3002) were global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
studies designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of esketamine nasal spray 84 mg 
compared with placebo nasal spray in the treatment of subjects with MDSI and they were conducted 
across multiple countries worldwide:  
•  Study SUI3001 enrolled a total of 226 subjects across 10 countries (Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, 
Hungary, Malaysia, South Africa, Republic of Korea, Spain, Taiwan, and the United States);  
•  Study SUI3002 enrolled 230 subjects across 12 countries (Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, 
Canada, Czech Republic, France, Lithuania, Poland, Spain, Turkey, and the United States).  
In contrast, the Phase 2 study (SUI2001) was a smaller (N=68) proof of concept study conducted at sites 
in the US only.  
Since the Phase 3 efficacy and safety pivotal studies had an identical design, the description of the main 
characteristics studies will be done in a combined manner in the rest of the document. The information on 
the Phase 2 proof-of-concept study (SUI2001) will be presented afterwards.

Addition to Comprehensive Standard of  Care for the Rapid 
Reduction of the Symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder, 
Including Suicidal Ideation, in Adult Subjects Assessed to be at 
Imminent Risk for Suicide 
Methods 
Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, global Phase 3 studies of identical 
design (Studies SUI3001 and SUI3002) were conducted in adults with MDD considered as patients, who 
were at imminent risk for suicide, by responding Yes to two questions [B3 and B10 of the Mini 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)]. The studies investigated the efficacy of esketamine 
nasal spray (84 mg) plus comprehensive standard of care (SOC) compared with placebo nasal spray plus 
comprehensive SOC in reducing the symptoms of MDD, including suicidal ideation. Due to the 
vulnerability of the population, all subjects were treated in the context of comprehensive SOC, consisting 
of initial inpatient psychiatric hospitalization and the initiation or optimization of antidepressant therapy, 
enhanced by twice-weekly study visits with extensive clinical contact as well as permitted concomitant 
medications and psychotherapy. The treatment assignments are referred to as “esketamine + SOC” and 
“placebo + SOC” in the remainder of this document. 
The studies consisted of 3 phases: a screening evaluation performed within 48 hours prior to the Day 1 
dose of study medication (if possible, screening should have occurred within 24 hours prior to the Day 1 
intranasal dose), immediately followed by a 25-day double-blind treatment phase, and a 65-day 
follow-up phase.

Multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trials are commonly conducted in depression 
and thus are considered appropriate for the patient population selected. 
Study participants 
Subjects enrolling in the Phase 3 MDSI studies were required to meet the DSM-5 criteria for MDD (without 
psychosis), based on diagnostic assessment with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview 
(MINI), and must have had a MADRS total score >28 at baseline, corresponding to moderate to severe 
depression. It is considered that more severe MDD patients typically have suicidal ideation than patients 
with less severe MDD and without suicidal ideation. 
Depression Characteristics and Psychiatric History  
Subjects enrolled in the Phase 3 MDSI studies represented a moderately to severely depressed 
population. In the pooled Phase 3 studies (SUI3001/3002), the mean (SD) baseline MADRS total score 
was 40.4 (5.82) (range: 29-58) and the median duration of the current depressive episode, derived from 
the MADRS euthymic baseline, was 15.8 months (range: 1-445 months).  
Most subjects in the pooled Phase 3 studies had a prior history of suicide attempt(s) within their lifetime, 
and more than one-quarter of subjects reported a recent suicide attempt (ie, within the last month). 
Overall, subjects presented with evidence of an acute psychiatric illness as measured by multiple 
suicidality indices (please see Baseline Data section below). 
It is noted that all subjects satisfied the enrolment criteria, which required that subjects had current 
suicidal ideation with intent at screening and within 24 hours of randomization, confirmed by a “Yes” 
response to the MINI Questions B3 (Think [even momentarily] about harming or of hurting or of injuring 
yourself: with at least some intent or awareness that you might die as a result; or think about suicide [ie, 
about killing yourself]) and B10 (Intend to act on thoughts of killing yourself?) assessed within 24 hours 
of randomization.  
Demographic, baseline and depression characteristics and psychiatric history were generally similar 
between the treatment groups across the two Phase 3 pivotal studies (for details please see Baseline Data 
section below).  
Key Eligibility Criteria  
Subjects enrolled in studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 were required to meet the following key criteria: 
•  Subject was a man or woman, 18 to 64 years of age, inclusive. 
•  Subject met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5th edition (DSM-5) 
diagnostic criteria for MDD, without psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and 
confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). 
•  Subject had current suicidal ideation with intent, confirmed by a “Yes” response to MINI Question 
B3 (Think [even momentarily] about harming or of hurting or of injuring yourself: with at least 
some intent or awareness that you might die as a result; or think about suicide [ie, about killing 
yourself]?) and Question B10 (Intend to act on thoughts of killing yourself?) within 24 hours prior 
to randomization. If the screening period was more than 24 hours prior to randomization, 
Question B3 and B10 assessments were repeated to confirm eligibility. 
• 
In the physician’s opinion, acute psychiatric hospitalization was clinically warranted due to 
subject’s imminent risk of suicide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 42/163 
 
 
 
•  Subject had a Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of >28 predose 
on Day 1. 
•  Subject agreed to be hospitalized voluntarily for a recommended period of 5 days after 
randomization and to be administered prescribed non-investigational antidepressant 
therapy(ies) for at least the duration of the double-blind treatment phase.  
Subjects were not enrolled in the studies if it was determined that they: 
•  Had a current DSM-5 diagnosis of bipolar (or related disorders), antisocial personality disorder, or 
obsessive compulsive disorder. 
•  Currently met DSM-5 criteria for borderline personality disorder.  
•  Had a current clinical diagnosis of autism, dementia, or intellectual disability. 
•  Had a current or prior DSM-5 diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, or MDD with psychotic features. 
•  Met the DSM-5 severity criteria for moderate or severe substance or alcohol use disorder (except 
for nicotine or caffeine) within the 6 months before screening.  
All eligibility criteria in studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 are provided in the study protocols. 
The key inclusion and exclusion criteria are in general acceptable.  
It is noted that only MDD patients participated in the phase 3 studies and patients with other disorders 
were excluded. As already mentioned the studies focused on a subgroup of MDD patients. 
The applicant states that the exclusion of subjects with a recent history of moderate to severe substance 
or alcohol use disorder was to ensure that subject’s depressive symptoms were not due to 
substance-induced depressive disorder. However the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria already includes this 
specific criterion. The applicant further states that the use of substances during the study, which might be 
more likely for patients with previous use, could hamper conclusion on safety and efficacy. In addition, 
the applicant states that these patients might be more susceptible for the abuse potential of esketamine. 
Exclusion of these subjects from the studies is unfortunate. Substance and alcohol abuse is relatively 
common in severely depressed patients and these patients could be potential candidates for esketamine 
treatment once brought to the emergency care due to suicidality. The argument on abuse potential is not 
agreed with, given that esketamine is administered in a controlled setting for short-term and the fact that 
studies in the TRD population did not show any drug seeking behaviour after discontinuing esketamine 
treatment. The proposed SmPC included a warning on individuals with a history of drug abuse or 
dependence. The applicant was requested to discuss whether this warning was.    
Treatments 
Eligible subjects were randomized to esketamine nasal spray 84 mg + SOC or placebo nasal spray + SOC, 
administered 2 times per week for 4 weeks.

Table 10 (SUI3001/SUI3002 CSR): Intranasal treatment administration during the 
double-blind phase, 84 mg 
Table 11 (SUI3001/SUI3002 CSR): Intranasal treatment administration during the 
double-blind phase, 56 mg 
The applicant chose the 84 mg dose for the MDSI studies in order to provide the patients the best chance 
of improvement. However, a clear dose-response or a justified choice of one dose above the other could 
not be concluded in the TRD studies. Therefore a flexible dosing approach was chosen. As such, the 84 mg 
dose is considered to be acceptable from safety perspective, and the SmPC includes the possibility to 
reduce the dose to 56 mg in case of intolerance. This is an acceptable approach, as efficacy in terms of 
MADRS is consistent with the 84 mg dose. 
Comprehensive SOC:  
This was the first global registration program of patients with MDSI, a population typically excluded from 
antidepressant treatment trials. To ensure a proper standard of safety and ethical trial conduct in this 
vulnerable population, the Phase 2 and Phase 3 MDSI studies were implemented in the context of 
comprehensive SOC, which included: 
• 
Initial inpatient psychiatric hospitalization 
•  Newly initiated or optimized antidepressant therapy per the clinician’s judgement, including 
antidepressant monotherapy or antidepressant plus augmentation therapy (antidepressant plus 
an additional antidepressant, antipsychotic, or mood stabilizer)  
• 
Permitted concomitant medications (eg, benzodiazepines) and psychotherapy per standard of 
care. 
Additionally, the comprehensive SOC was enhanced by twice-weekly study visits with extensive clinical 
contact (during initial hospitalization and after hospital discharge) during the double-blind phase. This 
aspect of the program is important to consider when interpreting the results.

The first dose was administered in the emergency room or other permitted setting, including the inpatient 
psychiatric unit. Subjects were to remain in the inpatient psychiatry unit for a recommended duration 
consistent with local SOC [5 or 14 days (in Study SUI3001 and most countries in Study SUI3002, the 
recommended duration of hospitalization was 5 days; in some countries in Study SUI3002, the 
recommended duration was 14 days to be consistent with local practice)] with shorter or longer 
hospitalizations permitted if clinically warranted. Following discharge, subsequent visits for the 
double-blind treatment phase were conducted twice weekly at an outpatient psychiatric facility through 
Day 25. During the follow-up phase, subjects were to be monitored twice weekly for the first 2 weeks after 
study medication treatment, then followed up weekly for the next 2 weeks, and every 2 weeks for the rest 
of the follow-up period through Day 90. 
It is noted that all types of antidepressants were allowed as SOC, which allowed flexibility and minimum 
treatment restrictions. This is required for such a depressed population with thoughts of committing 
suicide.    
Objectives 
The two Phase 3 studies (ASPIRE I, 54135419SUI3001 and ASPIRE II, 54135419SUI3002) had the same 
primary objective: 
- 
to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 mg compared with intranasal placebo in 
addition to comprehensive standard of care in reducing the symptoms of MDD, including suicidal 
ideation, in subjects who were assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide, as measured by the 
change from baseline on the MADRS total score at 24 hours post first dose.

The key secondary objective for both phase 3 studies was: 
- 
The key secondary objective was to assess the efficacy of intranasal esketamine compared with 
intranasal placebo in reducing severity of suicidality as measured by the Clinical Global 
Impression – Severity of Suicidality – Revised (CGI-SS-R) at 24 hours post first dose. 
The objectives of the studies are considered appropriate and reduction of suicidality is considered as an 
essential part of the primary objective.   
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Endpoints  
The predefined efficacy endpoints for each of the Phase 3 studies are provided below. 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline (Day 1, predose) to 24 hours after the first dose 
(Day 2) in MADRS total score. 
Key Secondary Endpoint 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline for CGI-SS-R at 24 hours after the first 
dose (Day 2).  
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints evaluated over time through the end of the double-blind treatment 
phase (Day 25) included the following:  
Change in MADRS total score from baseline  
Number of subjects who achieved remission of MDD (MADRS total score ≤12)  
Change in CGI-SS-R from baseline  
Number of subjects who achieved resolution of suicidality (CGI-SS-R score of 0 or 1)  
Change in CGI-SR-I from baseline 
Change in BHS total score from baseline 
Changes  in  EQ-5D-5L  dimension  scores,  health  status  index,  EuroQol  Group,  Visual  Analogue  Scale 
(EQ-VAS), and sum score from baseline 
Change in QLDS score from baseline 
TSQM-9 domain scores of effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction 
Change in clinician-rated FoST from baseline 
Change in patient-reported FoST from baseline 
Change in Module 5 Question 1 (Desire to Die in the Past 7 Days), Question 2 (Intent to End Life in the 
Past 7 Days) and Question 4 (Likelihood to Attempt to End Life in the Near Future); note, these were 
post-hoc analyses in Study SUI3001 from baseline 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints evaluated over time through the end of the double-blind treatment phase 
(Day 25) included the following:  
Number  of  subjects  who  achieved  response  (at  least  50%  improvement  in  MADRS  total  score  from 
baseline) 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 46/163 
 
 
 
 
Change in MADRS individual item scores from baseline 
Change in SIBAT Module 2 (My Risk/Protective Factors) total score from baseline 
Change in SIBAT Module 3 (My Current Thinking) total score from baseline 
Change in SIBAT Module 7 CGI-SR-LT score assessing long-term suicide risk from baseline 
Change in SIBAT Module 8 (Clinical Judgment of Optimal Suicide Management) score from baseline 
As additional exploratory endpoints, all efficacy assessments described above were evaluated over time 
during the post-treatment follow-up phase through Day 90. 
With  respect  to  Major  Depressive  Disorder and  depressive  symptoms,  MADRS  is  considered  the  most 
appropriate  scale.  Other  important  MADRS  endpoints  are  the  proportion  of  responders  and  remitters 
throughout the study as well as the change in MADRS total score from baseline to the end of the DB 
treatment phase. 
CGI-SS-R,  which  was  used  for  the  assessment  of  suicidality,  is  part  of  the  SIBAT.  At  the  time  of  the 
qualification advice of SIBAT, it was emphasised that the clinical meaningfulness of changes in the score 
in CGI-SS-R were unclear and that whether CGI-SS-R can be used as a key secondary endpoint cannot be 
confirmed. Further research was expected in order to evaluate the responsiveness of the SIBAT global 
clinical ratings to changes in clinical status. The relationship between changes in CGI-SS-R scores and 
changes in MADRS total score, suicidal ideation item and the SIBAT FoST was expected to be assessed 
and  finally  validated  in  the  Phase  3  program.  It  was  also  stated  that  the  underlying  assumption  that 
increasing  CGI-SS-R  risk  level  is  associated  with  an  increased  probability  of  suicide/attempted 
suicide/self-harm will need to be further substantiated. In addition, sensitivity to change and sensitivity 
to  detect  a  treatment  effect  would  be  required  for  final  validation  of  the  SIBAT.  Nevertheless,  the 
applicant has chosen to apply CGI-SS-R as key secondary endpoint, while it is not fully validated.  
It should be noted that the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS), which was used in the Phase 2 study, 
could have been also used in the Phase 3 studies to assess the patient’s suicidality and as an anchor to 
validate the CGI-SS-R within the same study. 
It should be also noted that a reliable, validated, commonly used, standard tool/scale, as in the case of 
depression, does  not exist for the  complex  issue of  suicidality.  It  has been reported that most of the 
instruments  were  not  developed  to  detect  rapid  fluctuations  of  suicidal  ideation  or  behaviour  by  the 
patients or to allow a well-informed clinician’s assessment. There is no sensitive and specific algorithm to 
predict  suicide  in  clinical  practice  and  improve  the  recognition  and  understanding  of  clinical, 
psychological,  sociological,  and  biological  factors,  which  may  facilitate  the  detection  of  high-risk 
individuals and assist in treatment selection.   
Sample size 
The two Phase 3 studies had the same sample size determination: 
The sample size for this study was calculated assuming an effect size of 0.45 for the MADRS total score at 
24 hours after the first dose (Day 2), a two-sided significance level of 0.05, and a drop-out rate at 24 
hours of 5%. Approximately 112 subjects were required to be randomly assigned to each treatment group 
to achieve 90% power. The effect size used in this calculation was based on results of the SUI2001 study 
where the effect size for the change from baseline to Day 2 was 0.65 (mean difference between treatment 
groups of -7.2 and a pooled SD of 11.02) for MADRS total score. Given that the SUI2001 study was a 
Phase 2 study carried out in only one country, the sample size for this Phase 3 study was determined 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 47/163 
 
 
 
using a smaller effect size of 0.45 to allow for greater variability that was expected for a study conducted 
globally. 
Sample size calculation was deemed appropriate. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was used to minimize bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment groups, to increase 
the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes were evenly balanced across treatment groups, 
and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. The randomization was 
stratified by study center and by the SOC antidepressant therapy (ie, antidepressant monotherapy or an 
antidepressant plus augmentation therapy, as determined by the investigator). The stratification was 
aimed at balancing treatment groups within the SOC antidepressant therapy to be initiated or optimized 
on Day 1, as antidepressant monotherapy and antidepressant plus augmentation therapy may be 
differentially effective. 
Randomisation was required and deemed appropriate.  
Blinding (masking) 
Blinded intranasal treatment (esketamine versus placebo) was used to reduce potential bias during data 
collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints. As esketamine has known characteristic effects that may 
impact blinding (such as dissociative symptoms, sedation, and elevation of blood pressure), these specific 
treatment-emergent events potentially could have biased the research staff who observed dose 
administration. To minimize this bias, the protocols for the Phase 3 studies required that different raters 
perform efficacy and safety assessments; this was also recommended in the Phase 2 study protocol 
(SUI2001).  
In addition, the esketamine and placebo nasal spray devices used in the Phase 2 and 3 studies were 
indistinguishable, and a bittering agent (denatonium benzoate) was added to the placebo solution to 
simulate the taste of the esketamine solution. 
The efforts to minimise the risk of a potential effect on blinding were considered sufficient.  
Statistical methods 
The same statistical methods were applied for both of the phase 3 studies (SUI3001/SUI3002). 
Target of estimation (estimand) 
The primary estimand, the main clinical quantity of interest to be estimated in the study, was defined by 
the following 4 components: 
• 
Population: subjects with MDSI, as defined through appropriate inclusion/exclusion criteria to 
reflect the targeted patient population; 
•  Variable: change from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose (Day 2) in the MADRS total score; 
• 
Intervention Effect: the effect of the initially randomized treatment that would have been 
observed had all subjects remained on their treatment until Day 2 of the double-blind treatment 
phase; 
•  Summary Measure: the difference in variable LS means. 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 48/163 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary analysis was based on the full analysis set and the MADRS total scores collected at Day 2. 
The wording suggests that a hypothetical strategy was used for all intercurrent events. Targeting a 
hypothetical treatment effect is usually not of primary interest from a regulatory point of view because it 
tends to overestimate the effect that can be expected in clinical practice. However, as remaining on 
treatment until Day 2 only means taking the initial dose of study medication (as second dose was taken 
after Day 2), in this case, targeting the hypothetical effect makes a negligible difference to targeting the 
effect regardless of study medication intake that is usually of primary regulatory interest, as usually 
almost all patients are treated. 
Analysis methods 
The efficacy analyses of data in the double-blind treatment phase were based on the full efficacy analysis 
set. The full efficacy analysis set was defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
double-blind study agent and had both a baseline and a post baseline evaluation for the MADRS total 
score or CGI-SS-R. 
The follow-up analysis set was defined as all subjects who completed the double-blind treatment phase 
and either entered the follow-up phase or provided AE data after the double-blind treatment phase. This 
analysis set was used for both efficacy and safety analyses during the follow-up phase. 
Statistical analysis tests were conducted at a 2-sided 0.050 level of significance unless specified 
otherwise. Multiplicity, with regard to testing multiple endpoints (the primary and the key secondary), 
was controlled by a fixed sequence testing procedure, ie, the key secondary hypothesis was to be tested 
only after the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint was rejected. Two-sided p-values were only 
presented for the primary and key secondary endpoint. Point estimates of the treatment differences and 
95% confidence interval (CIs) were presented for all other endpoints. 
For endpoints using ANCOVA, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was applied to the 
MADRS, CGI-SS-R, CGI-SR-I, BHS, and QLDS score for the double-blind and follow-up phases. 
Double-blind observations were not carried forward into the follow-up phase. The last post baseline 
observation during the double-blind treatment phase was carried forward as the endpoint for that phase. 
The last post baseline observation during the follow-up phase was carried forward as the endpoint for that 
phase. In addition to the observed cases and the endpoint assessment, the LOCF values were created for 
intermediate post baseline time points as well. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline (Day 1, predose) to 24 hours after the first dose 
(Day 2) in MADRS total score, was analyzed using an ANCOVA (LOCF) model, with factors for treatment 
(placebo or esketamine 84 mg), analysis center, SOC antidepressant treatment as randomized 
(antidepressant monotherapy or antidepressant plus augmentation therapy), and baseline MADRS total 
score as a continuous covariate. 
If over 5% of the primary endpoint data at 24 hours was missing, then additional sensitivity analyses that 
rely on Missing Not at Random assumptions were to be performed to assess the robustness of the primary 
analysis. To assess the sensitivity of the results of the ANCOVA (LOCF) model for the primary efficacy 
endpoint, a baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) imputation was applied. 
For subgroup analysis, forest plots were provided displaying analysis results for each subgroup. The point 
estimate of the treatment difference and its 95% confidence interval for each subgroup was based on an 
ANCOVA for the primary endpoint using the appropriate contrast based on the same model as for primary 
analysis but including subgroup and treatment-by-subgroup as additional factors. 
The analysis of the key secondary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline for CGI-SS-R at 24 hours after 
the first dose (Day 2), was performed for LOCF data using an ANCOVA model on the ranks of change with 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 49/163 
 
 
 
 
factors for treatment, analysis center, SOC antidepressant treatment as randomized (ie, antidepressant 
monotherapy or an antidepressant plus augmentation therapy) and baseline CGI-SS-R (unranked) as a 
covariate. The treatment difference was estimated using the Hodges-Lehmann estimate, which is the 
median of all possible paired differences for the change from baseline for CGI-SS-R at 24 hours. The 
treatment difference was also estimated using LS means based on an ANCOVA model on the actual 
change with factors for treatment, analysis center, SOC antidepressant treatment as randomized (ie, 
antidepressant monotherapy or antidepressant plus augmentation therapy) and baseline CGI-SS-R 
(unranked) as a covariate. The cumulative distribution function for any improvement and percent 
improvement from baseline to 24 hours in CGI-SS-R were graphically presented. Item response modeling 
was used to estimate treatment difference using an odds ratio by transforming the ordinal data to a 
hidden continuous scale via the logit model. The estimated treatment effect was transferred back to the 
original scale by exponentiation and was then interpreted as an odds ratio. 
To assess the sensitivity of the results of models for the key secondary endpoint (change from baseline for 
CGI-SS-R at 24 hours post first dose), a BOCF imputation was applied. 
Forest plots were provided displaying analysis results for each subgroup. The median estimate of the 
treatment difference in terms of odds ratio and its 95% credible interval for each subgroup were based on 
item response modeling for the key secondary endpoint using the appropriate contrast. 
The above-mentioned analyses were also performed for the pooled Phase 3 studies (SUI3001/3002), with 
study number (SUI3001 or SUI3002) added as an additional factor to the statistical models. 
The ANCOVA as described above for the change in MADRS total score was also used to analyze all other 
post baseline timepoints for both observed case and LOCF data. To assess the sensitivity of the results of 
the ANCOVA at the double-blind and follow-up endpoints, an MMRM analysis based on observed case data 
was performed comparing treatments for the change from baseline (Day 1, predose) to Day 25 
(double-blind treatment phase) and Day 90 (follow-up phase) in MADRS total score. The model included 
baseline MADRS total score as a continuous covariate, and day, treatment, analysis center, SOC 
antidepressant treatment as randomized (antidepressant monotherapy or antidepressant plus 
augmentation therapy), and day-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects, and a random subject effect. 
At each time-point during the double-blind and follow-up phases, a frequency distribution of the 
CGI-SS-R score and changes from baseline were provided for both the observed case and LOCF data. In 
addition, descriptive statistics for these scores and the changes from baseline were provided for both the 
observed case and LOCF data. Hodges-Lehmann estimates and the corresponding 95% CI for the 
treatment differences were provided for each time-point. An ANCOVA model on the change from baseline 
for both LOCF and observed case data was performed for each time-point as an additional exploratory 
analysis. 
Frequency distributions of subjects who achieved response (≥50% improvement in MADRS total score 
from baseline), remission (MADRS total score ≤12) and resolution of suicidality were provided at each 
time point during the double-blind treatment and follow-up phases. The estimates of the treatment 
difference in proportions and the 95% CIs were reported at each time point. 
Additional analyses for the change in CGI-SS-R score and other suicidality indices (ie, MADRS suicidal 
thoughts item, CGI-SR-I, clinician-rated FoST, patient-reported FoST) over time were added post-hoc, 
including item response modelling with LOCF and BOCF, ANCOVA (LOCF) and MMRM with observed case 
data. 
The statistical methods are generally considered acceptable.  
The primary analysis should usually be based on all randomised patients not excluding non-treated 
patients or patients without baseline or post-baseline data. However, the number of excluded patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 50/163 
 
 
 
was negligible. A per protocol analysis set was not defined and a per protocol analysis, with exclusion of 
major protocol deviations was requested and provided.  
The significance level was specified as 2-sided 0.05 and multiplicity was controlled by a fixed sequence 
testing procedure for the primary and key secondary endpoint, which is acceptable. 
The primary analysis was performed using ANCOVA, including stratification factors and baseline values. 
As sensitivity analysis, MMRM on observed cases was performed. These analyses are considered 
acceptable. 
The method for handling missing values should be aligned to the target of estimation (estimand). It 
appears questionable whether it can be assumed that the last observed value corresponds to the value 
that could be expected to be observed if a patient had remained on treatment. However, as missing 
values at Day 2 were negligible, this is not considered an issue for the primary analysis or key secondary 
analysis.  
For the key secondary endpoint, several different analyses were pre-defined. It is assumed that the 
ANCOVA model on the ranks of changes in CGI-SS-R was the main analysis for deciding on efficacy of 
treatment for this endpoint, and the Hodges-Lehmann estimate is the main effect measure. During 
scientific advice, an alternative such as an ANCOVA based on original data, an ordered logistic regression 
or an analysis based on a responder definition for the CGI-SS-R were suggested. Here item response 
modelling and ANCOVA of original data were performed as sensitivity analyses. It is acknowledged that 
describing the treatment effect for an ordinal-scaled endpoint is not straightforward because distances 
between categories of the scale cannot be interpreted. Therefore, it is not clear whether the ANCOVA 
analysis based on the actual values is valid. The item response analysis resulting in an odds ratio for 
achieving a lower score is an interesting explorative analysis but also difficult to interpret. Firstly, the 
application of the Bayesian framework is not standard in the regulatory context. It is not clear why no 
alternative frequentist likelihood-based methods were applied for the item response model; a 
proportional odds model would also have been an alternative allowing a similar interpretation as the item 
response analysis. Secondly, the interpretation of odds ratios in terms of clinical relevance is generally 
difficult and not intuitive, particularly for ordinal scales. 
For the change in MADRS total score over time, it is not clear what treatment effect (estimand) was 
actually intended to be addressed by the ANCOVA (LOCF) analysis. It can neither be considered to be 
aligned to the hypothetical effect if a patient had remained on treatment (for which an improvement 
compared to last observed value may be expected), nor to the effect regardless of treatment 
discontinuation (under which worsening of condition might be expected because of loss of effect after 
discontinuation). A BOCF analysis may be expected to be a conservative analysis for targeting the effect 
regardless of treatment discontinuation that is of primary regulatory interest. This analysis was provided 
for the pooled studies and is reported in the SmPC, which is acceptable. 
Similar considerations apply for the additional endpoints that were analyzed by ANCOVA(LOCF).

The design of the study together with the duration of the double-blind and follow-up phases are 
considered appropriate for the specific subgroup of patients. ≥80% of subjects completed the 
double-blind treatment phase, which is a similar completion rate to the TRD studies. A rapid action on 
depression was expected since this has already been indicated by the studies performed with esketamine 
in TRD and the available information up to now. A rapid acting antidepressant effect can be demonstrated 
within at Day 2 and sustained at 4 weeks time. A subsequent follow-up period of 10 weeks is considered 
sufficient in such a case.

Protocol amendments 
SUI3001 
Three substantial protocol amendments occurred during the study. 
In the first protocol amendment on 7 April 2017, the main protocol amendments concerned clarifications 
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
In the second protocol amendment on 20 April 2017, the main protocol amendments concerned 
clarifications on the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as texts regarding drug discontinuation and 
study withdrawal, revision of the Time and Events Schedule for the follow-up phase, further specifications 
on the statistical methods 
In the third amendment on 8 February 2018 the previously planned interim analysis was removed from 
the study to ensure that the study has sufficient numbers of subjects from key global regions/countries. 
Other main amendments considered clarifications on endpoints and exclusion criteria and modifying 
screening procedures with respect to timing. 
SUI3002 
Two substantial protocol amendments occurred during the study, which were identical to amendments 
two and three in study SUI3001. 
The protocol amendments are not considered such that they could have a major impact on overall study 
results.

Protocol deviations 
SUI3001 
Of 226 subjects randomly assigned to treatment, there were 29 (12.8%) patients with 1 or more major 
protocol deviations.  In total, 32 major protocol deviations were reported. The most common protocol 
deviation  was  entering

due to protocol deviation.

Of 230 subjects randomly assigned to treatment, there were 34 (14.8%) with 1 or more major protocol 
deviations. In total, 36 major protocol deviations were reported. As in study SUI3001, The most common 
protocol  deviation  was  entering  incorrect  stratification  factor  in  SOC  antidepressant  therapy,  which 
occurred in 11 patients. One patient (in the SOC + placebo group) was withdrawn from the study due to 
protocol violation, which was positive urine test for cocaine use. 
Major  protocol  deviations  concerned  entering  the  wrong  stratification  factor  in  terms  of  SOC 
antidepressant therapy. The number of patients where this occurred is notable, 38 in the pooled Phase 3 
study population. Efficacy of esketamine on top of SOC seemed to be only slightly more pronounced in 
patients on augmentation therapy as compared to patients on AD monotherapy. It was considered that 
these protocol deviations did not impact the overall conclusions of the studies. 
Baseline data 
The demographic and baseline characteristics for subjects in the full efficacy analysis set are summarized 
in Table 13 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy. Additional details are provided in the CSRs, and in 
Appendices 5 and 6 of the Summary of Clinical Efficacy.  
Demographics were generally similar across treatment groups and across studies, as follows: 
•  Overall, the mean (SD) age was 40.1 (13.00) years, ranging from 18 to 64 years. 
• 
The majority of subjects were female (60.8%).  
•  Nearly three-quarters of subjects (73.2%) were White, 13.1% were Asian, and 5.8% were Black 
or African American. 
•  Enrollment in the Phase 3 studies by geographic region was 49.4% in Europe, 27.3% in North 
America, 11.8% in Asia, and 11.5% in South America; more than one-quarter (27.1%) of 
subjects were enrolled in the United States. The two phase 3 studies included patients from 
Europe: pooled studies placebo + SOC n=106 and Esketamine 84 plus SOC n=117 (SUI3001: 
Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, Hungary and Spain; SUI3002: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, 
France, Lithuania, Poland and Spain). The rest of the patients from the pooled studies were 65 
and 58 from North America, 27 and 26 from Asia and 27 and 25 from South America for placebo 
+ SOC and Esketamine + SOC, respectively. 
• 
Prior to entering the study, 92.0% of the patients were receiving antidepressant therapy 
(including antidepressants, mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics and typical antipsychotics); 
see Appendix 5 (TSICM07_SCE). 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 54/163 
 
 
 
 
 
•  As recorded at randomization, 47.0% of subjects (55.4% in Study SUI3001 and 38.8% in Study 
SUI3002) were to receive antidepressant monotherapy as SOC treatment, and 53.0% of subjects 
(44.6% in Study SUI3001 and 61.2% in Study SUI3002) were to receive antidepressant plus 
augmentation therapy.  
Depression Characteristics and Psychiatric History at Baseline 
Subjects enrolled in the Phase 3 MDSI studies represented a moderately to severely depressed 
population. Depression characteristics and psychiatric history at baseline for subjects in the Phase 3 MDSI 
studies included in the full efficacy analysis set are summarized in Table 14 of the Summary of Clinical 
Efficacy. Additional details can be found in the CSRs. 
The eligibility criteria in each study were similar, resulting in depression characteristics and psychiatric 
history that were generally similar across studies and across treatment groups, with the following results 
in the pooled analysis: 
• 
• 
• 
The mean (SD) baseline MADRS total score was 40.4 (5.82) overall, ranging from 29 to 58, which 
corresponds to moderate to severe depression.  
The median (range) duration of the current depressive episode, derived from the MADRS 
euthymic baseline, was 15.8 (1; 445) months overall.  
The majority of subjects (90.0%) were rated by the clinician to be moderately to extremely 
suicidal, as measured by the CGI-SS-R scale. 
•  All subjects (100.0%) responded “Yes” to MINI Questions B3 and B10 Current Status within 24 
hours prior to randomization (ie, confirming active suicidal ideation and intent). 
•  Based on responses to MINI Question B3 Current Status – Frequency at baseline, 87% of subjects 
were thinking about suicide often or very often, and 94% were thinking about suicide with 
moderate or severe intensity 
• 
The majority of subjects (63.1%) reported any prior suicide attempt and 27.3% reported a 
suicide attempt within the last month.  
•  86% of subjects were considered by the clinician to have moderate to extreme imminent risk for 
suicide within the next 7 days, as measured by the Clinical Global Impression – Imminent Suicide 
Risk (CGI-SR-I).  
• 
The mean (SD) baseline Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS) total score was 15.6 (4.26), indicating a 
severe sense of hopelessness. 
Depression characteristics and psychiatric history were generally similar between the treatment groups, 
and between the 2 studies. There was however a higher proportion of subjects in the esketamine + SOC 
group than in the placebo + SOC group who had a recent suicide attempt (ie, within the last month) in 
Study SUI3002 (31.6% versus 21.2%, respectively); the corresponding proportions were 28.6% versus 
27.7%, respectively, in SUI3001, and 30.1% versus 24.4%, respectively, in the pooled Phase 3 studies.

Appendix 6  
The included patient population is as expected, middle aged and females as majority. The percentage of 
patients in which antidepressant treatment was amended between monotherapy and augmentation 
therapy is small, ~6%. With respect to demographics and baseline characteristics, it is noted that the 
treatment groups are quite well balanced and there were no differences, which could impact the results, 
between the treatment groups. A slightly higher proportion of patients in the SOC + placebo arm received 
antidepressant plus augmentation therapy as compared to the SOC + esketamine group.

Patients clearly suffered from moderate to severe depression, since the lower range of the MADRS score 
is 29 which is the upper range of moderate depression according to the scale. 
The mean duration of the current depressive episode was long, approximately 3 years, however there 
was a large variation with median duration of 15.8 months. 
In terms of MADRS item 10, most patients were clearly severely suicidal. 
With respect to baseline psychiatric history it is noted that the main criterion for entering the study was 
by answering “Yes” to MINI Questions B3 and B10 Current Status within 24 hours prior to randomization 
(i.e., potentially confirming active suicidal ideation and intent). It is also noted that there was a minor 
imbalance between groups in the individual studies for those who were questionably suicidal (SUI3001: 
2.7% vs 4.5% and in SUI3002: 2.7% vs 0.9% for the placebo + SOC vs esketamine 84mg+SOC, 
respectively). However, when the studies were pooled together this imbalance was “cancelled out” 2.7% 
vs 2.7% for the placebo + SOC vs esketamine84mg+SOC, respectively).

The CGI-SS-R and CGI-SR-I scores do not seem to correlate with the outcomes of the MINI. As per MINI 
interview, 100% of patients confirmed to think about suicide and intended to act, as was required per 
inclusion criteria. Majority of patients also thought of suicide often or frequently, and with severe 
intensity. However, there were quite some patients that according to the CGI-SS-R and CGI-SR-I were 
moderately or mildly suicidal (35.1%), or were considered to be at most in moderate imminent suicide 
risk (40.8% in study SUI3001 and 40.5% in study SUI3002). This may reflect the incapability of SIBAT to 
fully capture suicidal ideation. 
The majority of patients had not been hospitalized due to depression or suicidality in the past 12 months. 
However, from those who had, a large proportion were free of symptoms only for a short period of time, 
before admitted to the emergency medical care again. 
The treatment groups were fairly well balanced, patients in the SOC + esketamine group had a slightly 
longer duration of current depressive episode and more depressive episodes, and more patients in this 
group had extreme suicidal ideation and suicide risk as assessed with the SIBAT, as compared to the SOC 
+ placebo group. 
To better characterise the included patient population, the applicant was requested to provide details on 
previous treatments i.e. number of antidepressant treatments, including augmentation therapy, 
psychotherapy and possible ECT.  
Prior and concomitant therapies 
Of the 225 subjects in the safety analysis set, most (96.9%) received one or more medications of special 
interest  (antidepressants,  antipsychotics,  benzodiazepines,  non-benzodiazepine  hypnotics  and 
anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers/antiepileptics) prior to enrolment in the study.  
The 5 most frequently reported SOC antidepressant medications during the DB treatment phase were 
venlafaxine (24.9%), escitalopram (16.0%), duloxetine (15.6%), mirtazapine (15.6%), and quetiapine 
(14.2%). 
During the double-blind treatment phase, all 225 subjects in the safety analysis set reported use of one 
or more concomitant medications. The 5 most frequently used concomitant medications were lorazepam  
(38.2%), clonazepam (30.7%), quetiapine (25.8%), venlafaxine (25.8%), and paracetamol (19.1%). 
The  applicant  was  requested  to  provide  an  overview  of  the  most  common  combinations  of  drugs  in 
augmentation therapy. 
Duration of hospitalization 
Study SUI3001 
The median (range) duration of initial hospitalization was 11.0 days (range: 2 to 69) in the SOC + placebo 
group and 12.0 days (range: 1 to 84) for subjects in the SOC + esketamine group. Mean duration of 
hospitalization  was  16.3  days  in  the  SOC  +  placebo  group  and  16.4  days  for  subjects  in  the  SOC  + 
esketamine group. 
The median duration  of hospitalization was  similar between regions,  however there were rather large 
differences  within  Europe.  The  median  duration  of  hospitalization  varied  from  8.0  days  in  the  SOC  + 
esketamine group is Spain, to median duration of 23.5 days in the SOC + esketamine group in Bulgaria. 
Study SUI3002 
Assessment report

The median (range) duration of initial hospitalization was 10.0 days (range: 2 to 85 days) for those in the 
SOC + placebo treatment group and 14.0 days (range: 1 to 89 days) for subjects in the SOC + 
esketamine treatment group. The mean duration of initial hospitalization was 19.1 in the SOC + placebo 
group and 21.6 in the SOC + esketamine group. 
Duration of hospitalization was considerably different between regions, as presented in Table 15. There 
were also large differences between countries within Europe, ranging from a median duration of 6 days in 
the SOC + placebo group in Spain, to 48.5 days in the SOC + placebo group in Austria. 
Table 15: THEHRUQ02C1 (CSR SUI3002): Duration (in Days) of the Initial Hospitalization by 
Region; Safety Analysis Set (Study SUI3002) 
The differences in duration of hospitalization within Europe illustrate the differences in clinical practises 
between countries. The applicant was requested to discuss the large difference in duration of 
hospitalization in North America and Europe. This difference was not observed in study SUI3001, where 
the duration of hospitalization was similar between the regions. This was clarified during the assessment. 
Prior and concomitant therapies 
Of the 227 subjects in the safety analysis set, most (95.6%) subjects received one or more medications 
of special interest (antidepressants, typical antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine 
hypnotics and anxiolytics, atypical antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers and antiepileptics) prior to 
enrolment in the study. 
During the double-blind treatment phase, all 227 subjects in the safety analysis set reported use of one 
or more concomitant medications. The 5 most frequently reported SOC antidepressant medications were 
venlafaxine and quetiapine (28.2% subjects each), escitalopram (17.2% subjects), duloxetine (14.5% 
subjects), and sertraline (13.7% subjects).re concomitant medications. 
The applicant was requested to provide an overview of the most common combinations of drugs in 
augmentation therapy.

The all randomized analysis set included all subjects in pooled studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 who 
were randomized (ie, subjects who reported a randomization date, or were assigned a 
randomization number) regardless of whether or not treatment was received.  
The full efficacy analysis set included all randomized subjects in pooled studies SUI3001 and 
SUI3002 who received at least 1 dose of study medication during the double-blind treatment 
phase and had both a baseline and a post-baseline evaluation for the MADRS total score or 
CGI-SS-R. 
The safety analysis set included all randomized subjects in pooled studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 
who received at least 1 dose of study medication in the double-blind treatment phase. 
The follow-up analysis set included all subjects in pooled studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 who 
completed the double-blind treatment phase and entered the follow-up phase or provided 
adverse event data after the double-blind phase. 
The populations for analysis of efficacy (ie, the full analysis sets) in each study were as follows: 
224 subjects in Study SUI3001 (112 esketamine 84 mg + SOC; 112 placebo + SOC) and 227 subjects in 
Study SUI3002 (114 esketamine 84 mg + SOC; 113 placebo + SOC).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
For the individual studies SUI3001 and SUI3002, the primary efficacy analysis was performed on the full 
efficacy analysis set with LOCF data using an ANCOVA model. Results for the primary efficacy endpoint, 
change in MADRS total score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose (Day 2), demonstrated 
statistically significant improvement of esketamine + SOC versus placebo + SOC in both studies (Table 
17). 
• 
• 
In Study SUI3001, the LS mean treatment difference (SE) was -3.8 (1.39); the 2-sided p-value 
was 0.006. 
In Study SUI3002, the LS mean treatment difference (SE) was -3.9 (1.39); the 2-sided p-value 
was 0.006. 
For the pooled studies, the LS mean treatment difference (95% CI) at 24 hours after the first dose 
was -3.8 (-5.75; -1.89); see Table 17).

The primary endpoint, change in MADRS total score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose (Day 2), 
showed a significant and clinically relevant difference between the treatment groups placebo + SOC and 
esketamine + SOC. A rapid reduction of depressive symptoms was observed in both studies [SUI3001: 
-3.8 (SE=1.39); p=0.006 and SUI3002: -3.9 (SE=1.39); p=0.006]. For the pooled studies, the LS mean 
treatment difference (95% CI) at 24 hours after the first dose was -3.8 (-5.75; -1.89). A BOCF sensitivity 
analysis corroborated these results.

The observed improvement in the SOC + placebo arm is striking, considering that the patients were 
severely depressed as reflected in the mean MADRS baseline total score of ~40, and the fact that the 
primary endpoint was at 24 hours after the first dose of treatment. However as patients could have been 
hospitalized for 48 hours before the first dosing (the screening period), a patient could have been under 
intensive medical attention for up to 4 days at the time of the primary endpoint measurement. The large 
improvement in the control arm may be explained by this.  
The provided MMRM and BOCF analysis demonstrated similar results as the primary analysis, however the 
applicant was requested to provide the p values from these analyses. 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
In both studies SUI3001 and SUI3002, the key secondary analysis was performed on the full efficacy 
analysis set with LOCF data using an ANCOVA model on ranks of change. Results for the key secondary 
endpoint, the change in CGI-SS-R score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose, are shown in Table 
18. The median changes in CGI-SS-R from baseline (range) at 24 hours after the first dose (Day 2) were 
-1.0 (-6; 2) in the esketamine + SOC groups in both studies, and -1.0 (-5; 1) and -1.0 (-5; 2) in the 
placebo + SOC groups in Study SUI3001 and Study SUI3002. The Hodges-Lehmann estimates of the 
treatment difference were 0.0 (-1.00; 0.00) and 0.0 (0.00; 0.00) in Study SUI3001 and Study SUI3002, 
respectively. Using an ANCOVA model on ranks with LOCF data, the estimated treatment differences were 
not statistically significant (2-sided p-value = 0.107 in Study SUI3001 and 0.379 in Study SUI3002). 
For the pooled studies, the Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the treatment difference (95% CI) was 0.0 
(0.00; 0.00).

In Study SUI3001, although the analysis considered LOCF data if data was not available at the 24-hour timepoint, all subjects in 
the full efficacy analysis set had data available at this timepoint. In Study SUI3002, of the 8 subjects who did not have data 
available at the 24-hour timepoint, 7 subjects (2 in the placebo + SOC group and 5 in the esketamine + SOC group) had the Day 
1, 4-hour assessment carried forward for Day 2. One additional subject was missing both the Day 1, 4 hour and Day 2 values. 
Notes: The CGI-SS-R score ranges from 0 to 6; a higher score indicates a more severe condition, and a negative change in score 
indicates improvement.

The key secondary endpoint, change in CGI-SS-R score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose (Day 
2), failed to show statistically significant difference in favour of esketamine + SOC vs placebo + SOC in 
both studies and the pooled studies data. Not even a direction of change or a trend in favour of 
esketamine can be seen.  
The applicant also provided different frequency distribution graphs on CGI-SS-R score at various time 
points (e.g. Figure 9). While the frequency distribution at all time points (4 hrs, 24 hrs and 25 days) 
shows that a larger percentage of patients in the SOC + esketamine groups had a score of 0 (normal) as 
compared to the SOC + placebo group, the Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the treatment difference with 
respect to change from baseline was 0 at all time points. 
Based on the results presented, esketamine add on to SOC does not seem to improve the severity of 
suicidality, throughout the course of 4-week treatment. It should be also noted that the SIBAT, from 
which the CGI-SS-R is derived from, is not a fully validated assessment tool, and it is therefore unclear 
whether the CGI-SS-R is sensitive to change and sensitive to detect a treatment effect. As was seen in the 
baseline data, the CGI-SS-R score does not seem to correlate with the suicidality outcomes of the MINI. 
As discussed in further results, none of the suicidality endpoints demonstrate significant improvement in 
suicidality with esketamine add on treatment. The proposed indication including ‘suicidal ideation with

intent’  is therefore not agreed, as this gives the connotation that esketamine add-on therapy would, next 
to depressive symptoms in general, target suicidality as a specific entity, while the available clinical data 
does not demonstrate any added benefit of add-on esketamine over standard of care in reducing 
suicidality. 
Concerns were raised during the assessment that reduction in depressive symptoms with the MADRS did 
not translate into a beneficial effect on suicidality.  
CGI-SS-R and Other Suicidality Indices Over Time  
Frequency Distribution of CGI-SS-R Scores Over Time 
Frequency distributions of CGI-SS-R scores at baseline, 4 hours after the first dose, 24 hours after the 
first dose (Day 2), and Day 25 predose (observed cases) for studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 are included 
in the CSRs; the frequency distribution for the pooled studies is displayed in Figure 9 (Summary of 
Clinical Efficacy). For the individual Phase 3 studies and the pooled studies, CGI-SS-R scores improved 
from baseline to the end of the double-blind treatment phase (Day 25) in both treatment groups.

 There was improvement over time in the CGI-SS-R translated as increase of the percentages of patients 
who responded “0-Normal, not at all suicidal” plus “1-Questionably suicidal” in both treatment groups 
(placebo + SOC and Esketamine + SOC). However, no differences between treatment groups could be 
observed at any time point. 
Remission of MDD Over Time 
Remission of MDD during the double-blind treatment phase is presented below using 2 definitions: 
MADRS total score ≤12 and MADRS total score ≤10. As prespecified in the protocols for the Phase 3 
studies, a subject was considered to achieve remission of MDD at a given time point if the MADRS total 
score was ≤12; the results for the pooled studies are presented below, and results for individual studies 
are presented in the CSRs. 
During the double-blind treatment phase, the percentage of subjects who achieved remission defined as 
MADRS total score ≤12 was greater in the esketamine + SOC group than the placebo + SOC group at all 
timepoints in Study SUI3001 and at all timepoints except for Day 18 in Study SUI3002.

Remission and response rates increase rather steadily throughout the study period in both treatment 
groups. Large remission and response rates early on in the study are most likely due to the intensive 
medical care setting of the study. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints: 
•  Change in MADRS total score over time: In both studies, the LS mean treatment differences 
based on an MMRM analysis on observed case data numerically favoured the esketamine + SOC 
group at all timepoints during the double-blind treatment phase: 4 hours and 24 hours after the 
first dose as well as Days 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25 (predose and 4 hours post dose). The LS 
mean (95% CI) treatment difference on Day 25, 4 hours postdose, was -4.1 (-6.74; -1.40) in 
Study SUI3001 and -2.7 (-5.75; 0.28) in Study SUI3002. 
•  Remission of MDD (MADRS total score ≤12): During the double-blind treatment phase, the 
percentage of subjects who achieved remission was greater in the esketamine + SOC group than 
the placebo + SOC group at all timepoints in Study SUI3001 and at all timepoints except for Day 
18 in Study SUI3002. At the last MADRS assessment during the double-blind phase on Day 25, 4 
hours post dose, the difference (95% CI) between treatment groups in percentage of subjects 
who achieved remission was 16.1% (3.20; 28.94) in Study SUI3001 and 10.2% (-2.58; 22.98) in 
Study SUI3002. 
Data summarizing the LS mean change in MADRS over time and the proportion of remitters, 
treatment with esketamine + SOC in the double-blind phase compared to placebo + SOC resulted 
in: 
o  Slightly more subjects who achieved remission: 4.8 (95% CI: -0.20; 9.88), 10.6 (95% 
CI: 4.05; 17.10) and 13.1 (95% CI: 4.03; 22.19) more remitters per 100 patients at Day 
1:4H, Day 2, and Day 25:4H, respectively, for esketamine + SOC. 
•  Change in CGI-SS-R over time: CGI-SS-R scores improved from baseline to the end of the 
double-blind treatment phase in both treatment groups. At the end of the double-blind treatment 
phase, the changes from baseline in CGI-SS-R score were similar for the 2 treatment groups; the 
Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the treatment difference (95% CI) for observed case data at Day 
25 (predose) was 0.0 (-1.00; 0.00) in Study SUI3001 and 0.0 (0.00; 0.00) in Study SUI3002. 
•  Resolution of suicidality: The percentage of subjects achieving resolution of suicidality based on 
CGI-SS-R score was greater in the esketamine + SOC treatment group than the placebo + SOC 
group at all timepoints in Study SUI3001 and at all timepoints except for Day 8 in Study SUI3002. 
The difference between treatment groups in percentage of subjects achieving resolution of 
suicidality at Day 25 (predose) was 12.5% (-0.36; 25.36) in Study SUI3001 and 2.1% (-10.65; 
14.89) in Study SUI3002.

In both studies, CGI-SR-I scores, clinician-rated FoST, and patient-reported FoST improved from 
baseline to the end of the double-blind treatment phase in both treatment groups; see the 
individual CSRs for additional information. 
Results for patient-reported EQ-5D-5L scores and TSQM-9 domain scores directionally favoured 
treatment with esketamine + SOC over placebo + SOC during the double-blind treatment phase in both 
studies. Further information about all patient-reported outcomes (ie, BHS total score and QLDS score in 
addition to the outcomes mentioned above) are provided in the CSRs. 
An improvement in quality of life in depression was analyzed using a decrease of more than or equal to 4 
on the QLDS. Compared to placebo + SOC, treatment with esketamine + SOC from Day 1 through Day 25 
resulted in a small percentage: 
- 
4.6 (95% CI: -4.56; 13.86) more patients who achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in 
quality of life at Day 25 per 100 patients. 
A reduction in hopelessness was analyzed using the BHS cut-off level of <9 among subjects with BHS of 
at least 9 at baseline. A cut-off level of 9 was selected, as BHS scores ≥9 could be considered predictive 
of suicide risk. Compared to placebo +SOC, treatment with esketamine + SOC from Day 1 through Day 
25 resulted in: 
- 
6.8 (95% CI: -2.74; 16.37) slightly more patients with a reduction in hopelessness (BHS<9) at 
Day 25 per 100 patients. 
There was improvement in the change in MADRS total score over time and remission of MDD (MADRS 
total score ≤12) in both studies. The differences, however, in favour of esketamine 84mg plus SOC in the 
other secondary efficacy endpoints related to suicidality, such as resolution of suicidality (CGI-SS-R≤1), 
reduction  of  hopelessness  using  BHS  and  quality  of  life  using  QLDS,  were  small  and  of  questionable 
significance and clinical relevance. The significance and the clinical relevance of the results of these other 
secondary endpoints were further discussed by the applicant. 
A  decrease  in  the  percentages  for  the  claimed  resolution  of  suicidality  over time  is  observed,  while  a 
constantly increasing trend would have been expected [(CGI-SS-R≤1): 13.2 (95% CI: 5.12; 21.25), 1.6 
(95% CI: -7.10; 10.35) and 7.3 (95% CI: -1.80; 16.36) more patients with resolution of suicidality per 
100 patients for esketamine + SOC at Day 1:4H, Day 2 and Day 25, respectively].  
In addition, there were differences observed between the two phase 3 studies [Change in MADRS total 
score over time LS mean treatment difference on Day 25, 4 hours postdose, was -4.1 (-6.74; -1.40) in 
Study SUI3001 and -2.7 (-5.75; 0.28) in Study SUI3002; Remission of MDD (MADRS total score ≤12) 
difference (95% CI) between treatment groups in percentage of subjects who achieved remission was 
16.1%  (3.20;  28.94)  in  Study  SUI3001  and  10.2%  (-2.58;  22.98)  in  Study  SUI3002;  resolution  of

suicidality at Day 25 (predose) was 12.5% ( 0.36; 25.36) in Study SUI3001 and 2.1% (-10.65; 14.89) in 
Study SUI3002]. The applicant was requested to discuss these together with the potential reasons.  
In general, the total MADRS score continues to decrease throughout the studies in both treatment arms. 
The  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Day  25  (post-dose)  was  large  i.e.  >-25  points,  however  this 
improvement  was  seen  in  both  treatment  groups.  The  difference  in  means  has  not  been  tested 
statistically.  However  the  LS  mean  difference  throughout  the  DB  study  period  is  rather  constant 
approximately 2-4 points. 
The applicant was requested to provide an analysis of change in MADRS score over time in subgroups 
(categories e.g. <5, ≥ 5 - 10, >10) per duration of hospitalisation.  
Across the pivotal studies, 35 subjects (15.5%) in the esketamine + SOC group had a protocol-permitted, 
one-time  dose  reduction  (and  received  the  56-mg  dose  during  all  subsequent  dosing  sessions).  The 
change in MADRS total score over time was also evaluated for these 35 subjects. The findings in these 
subjects were consistent with the results of the primary analysis, as presented in the following Figure 
below.

Subjects With and Without Dose Reduction: LS Mean (+/- SE) of Changes Over Time – MMRM

SUI3001, SUI3002) 
A small number of patients had a protocol-permitted dose reduction to 56 mg. Efficacy in terms on 
MADRS follows the same pattern as the 84 mg dose. The proposed dose recommendation was therefore 
considered acceptable. 
Ancillary analyses 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Analysis of the change in MADRS total score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose performed using 
a MMRM model on the full efficacy analysis set with observed case data was consistent with the primary 
efficacy analysis. The LS mean (95% CI) treatment difference at 24 hours after the first dose was: 
-3.7 (-6.44; -0.98) for Study SUI3001  
-3.5 (-6.21; -0.78) for Study SUI3002  
-3.6 (-5.51; -1.67) for the pooled studies

Key secondary endpoint 
An analysis of change in CGI-SS-R score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose was also performed 
with unranked LOCF data using an ANCOVA model. The LS mean treatment difference (95% CI) was: 
-0.3 (-0.59; 0.08) for Study SUI3001  
-0.1 (-0.48; 0.19) for Study SUI3002  
-0.2 (-0.43; 0.04) for the pooled studies  
Analysis of CGI-SS-R Score and Other Suicidality Indices Based on ANCOVA with LOCF Data 
The change in CGI-SS-R score and other suicidality indices (ie, the MADRS suicidal thoughts item, 
CGI-SR-I, clinician-rated FoST [or CGI FoST as noted in figure below], and patient-reported FoST) were 
evaluated at Day 1, 4 hours after the first dose, Day 2, 24 hours after the first dose and Day 25 during the 
double-blind treatment phase using ANCOVA with LOCF data. The analyses of change in CGI-SS-R scores 
from baseline to Day 1, 4 hours after the first dose, and to Day 2, 24 hours after the first dose, were 
prespecified in the Phase 3 SAP. All of the other analyses described in this section were post-hoc analyses 
in the individual Phase 3 studies.

(-7.26; -2.36) for the subpopulation that reported a prior suicide attempt (lifetime, based on SIBAT 
response) and -2.32 (-5.54; 0.91) for the subpopulation that did not report a prior suicide attempt.

CGI-SS-R Score and Other Suicidality Indices Over Time by Prior Suicide Attempt 
Individual studies 
For the individual studies, the odds ratios for improved scores on the CGI-SS-R and other suicidality 
indices (ie, the MADRS suicidal thoughts item, CGI-SR-I, clinician-rated FoST, and patient-reported FoST) 
by prior suicide attempt were evaluated at Day 1, 4 hours after the first dose, Day 2, 24 hours after the 
first dose and Day 25 during the double-blind treatment phase using item response modeling with LOCF 
data. 
Pooled studies 
The odds ratios for improved scores on the CGI-SS-R and other suicidality indices by prior suicide attempt 
were evaluated at Day 1, 4 hours after the first dose, Day 2, 24 hours after the first dose and Day 25 using 
item response modeling with LOCF data (Appendix 36). 
For CGI-SS-R score specifically, the odds ratios (95% CrI) for an improved score were: 
Day 1, 4 hours after the first dose:   
2.33 (1.24; 4.42) for the subpopulation that reported a prior suicide attempt  
2.93 (1.28; 6.98) for the subpopulation that did not report a prior suicide attempt  
Day 2, 24 hours after the first dose:

3.73 (1.39; 10.65) for the subpopulation that reported a prior suicide attempt  
0.70 (0.18; 2.78) for the subpopulation that did not report a prior suicide attempt  
Note, point estimates >1 directionally favor the esketamine + SOC group, and those <1 directionally 
favor the placebo + SOC group.

As stated earlier, the validity of the CGI-SS-R score was questioned. 
The item response analysis revealed some differences between the subpopulations who had reported a 
prior suicide attempt at baseline and those who had not. However, this is a post-hoc exploratory analysis 
in subgroups of the clinical trial population that might at best be considered as relevant or supportive for 
the suicidality indices. As no effect for the suicidality indices was observed in the overall population, such 
retrospective analyses aiming to present more convincing results in a subpopulation are associated with 
a high risk of selection bias and could be characterised as a post-hoc identification of only favourable data.

Furthermore, by visual observation of the above graphs, showing the development of LS means of 
CGI-SS-R over time, it can be seen that the differences between the treatment groups of Placebo + SOC 
and Esketamine + SOC in absolute terms in the change of CGI-SS-R are very small in the subgroup of 
patients with prior suicide attempt and non-existent in the subgroup without a prior suicide attempt. 
(although it is acknowledged that the validity of calculating LS means for an ordinal scale may be 
questionable). This highlights that interpretation of the effects in terms of the odds ratio is not 
straightforward; in particular, it is not clear how to interpret the OR in terms of clinical relevance. 
Especially, it is remarkable that the OR is largest at day 25 in the subgroup of patients with a prior suicide 
attempt, while the absolute CGI-SS-R decreases with time in both Placebo + SOC and Esketamine + SOC 
group and the difference between these groups is small; therefore, it appears highly questionable 
whether the OR, which is a measure on a relative scale, corresponds to a clinically relevant absolute 
decrease in risk. In conclusion, even using the item response analyses, it is not convincing that a 
favourable effect of esketamine on the suicidality of patients with a prior suicide attempt exists. 
An analysis based on the MADRS severity (for the subgroup with MADRS=>35 at baseline) was requested 
to investigate whether severely depressed patients who are expected to be more prone to suicidal 
thoughts are affected by the treatment of esketamine plus SOC.  
CGI-SR-I 
The CGI-SR-I is a scale summarizing the clinician’s best assessment of the likelihood that the subject will 
attempt suicide in the next 7 days. In both studies, the changes from baseline in the CGI-SR-I score were 
similar for the 2 treatment groups at all time-points during the double-blind treatment phase. The 
Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the treatment difference for both observed case and LOCF data was 0.0 at 
all time points.  
Concerns were raised that esketamine add-on did not provide additional benefit over standard of care in 
investigator assessed risk of suicide, as captured by the SIBAT.  
MADRS suicidal thoughts 
SUI3001 
The LOCF median change from baseline in the MADRS suicidal thoughts item at 4 hours was -1 (-6;1) in 
the SOC + placebo group and -2 (-6;1) in the SOC + esketamine group. The Hodges-Lehmann estimate 
of the treatment difference [95% CI] was -1.0 [-1.00; 0.00]). The estimate was 0.0 (1.00; 0.00) at 25 hrs 
after the first dose as well as Day 25 (post-dose). 
SUI3002 
The LOCF median change from baseline in the MADRS suicidal thoughts item at 4 hours was -1 (-6;1) in 
the SOC + placebo group and -2 (-6;1) in the SOC + esketamine group. The Hodges-Lehmann estimate 
of the treatment difference [95% CI] with observed case data was 0.0 [-1.00; 0.00]). The same estimate 
was observed at 25 hrs after the first dose as well as Day 25 (post-dose). 
Although the results on MADRS suicidal thoughts item might suggest some numerical benefit of 
esketamine add-on at 4 hours post-dose, there was no difference between the treatment groups based on 
the Hodges-Lehmann estimate.

The results based on ANCOVA were consistent with the MMRM analysis. 
Treatment  difference  between  the  groups  in  change  in  BHS  total  score  from  baseline  to  Day  25  was 
considered to be very small if not absent. 
Follow-up phase 
The pivotal studies included a 9-week follow up phase (up to Day 90).  
SUI 3001 
192 patients (N=80 SOC + placebo, N=84 SOC + esketamine) entered the follow-up phase, 164 patients 
(85.4%) completed the entire study. The most common reason for study termination prematurely was 
withdrawal by subject (N=14, 7.3%). 
At the end of the follow-up phase (Day 90), the mean changes in MADRS total score from baseline (SD) 
were -26.8 (13.30) in the placebo + SOC group  and -26.2 (14.32) in the esketamine + SOC group. Using 
a MMRM model, the LS mean (95% CI) treatment difference was 1.7 (-2.49; 5.86). 
At Day 90, the changes from baseline in CGI-SS-R score were similar for the two treatment groups; the 
Hodges- Lehmann estimate of the treatment difference (95% CI) for observed case data was 0.0 (0.00; 
1.00).

SUI3002 
183 patients (N=94 SOC + placebo, N=89 SOC + esketamine) entered the follow-up phase, 166 patients 
(90.7%) completed the entire study. The most common reason for study termination prematurely was 
withdrawal by subject (N=6, 3.3%). 
At the end of the follow-up phase (Day 90), the mean changes in MADRS total score from baseline (SD) 
were -26.0 (12.03) in the placebo + SOC group  and -28.0 (11.75) in the esketamine + SOC group. Using 
a MMRM model, the LS mean (95% CI) treatment difference was -1.3 (-4.73; 2.06). 
At Day 90, the changes from baseline in CGI-SS-R score were similar for the 2 treatment groups; the 
Hodges- Lehmann estimate of the treatment difference (95% CI) for observed case data was 0.0 (0.00; 
0.00). 
The results suggest no differences between the treatment groups at Day 90. It is notable that in study 
SUI3001  the  change  in  MADRS  score  from  baseline  to  Day  90  is  in  favour  of  SOC  +  placebo  group. 
However the results should be interpreted with caution as they are open-label. 
The applicant was requested to provide details on continuation of SOC antidepressant treatment during 
the follow-up phase.

To assess the robustness of the conclusions from the primary efficacy 
analysis, sensitivity analyses were performed using an ANCOVA model with 
BOCF data; this was a post-hoc analysis in Study SUI3001 and a prespecified 
analysis in Study SUI3002. For Study SUI3001, Study SUI3002, and the 
pooled studies, results of these sensitivity analyses were consistent with the 
ANCOVA using LOCF data. The LS mean (95% CI) treatment difference at 24

Analysis description  For the individual studies SUI3001 and SUI3002, the primary efficacy analysis 
was performed on the full efficacy analysis set with LOCF data using an 
ANCOVA model. Results for the primary efficacy endpoint, change in MADRS 
total score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose (Day 2), 
demonstrated statistically significant improvement of esketamine + SOC 
versus placebo + SOC in both studies 
To assess the robustness of the conclusions from the primary efficacy 
analysis, sensitivity analyses were performed using an ANCOVA model with 
BOCF data; this was a post-hoc analysis in Study SUI3001 and a prespecified 
analysis in Study SUI3002. For Study SUI3001, Study SUI3002, and the 
pooled studies, results of these sensitivity analyses were consistent with the 
ANCOVA using LOCF data. The LS mean (95% CI) treatment difference at 24 
hours after the first dose was: 
• 
• 
-3.9 (-6.65; -1.12) for Study SUI3002  
-3.8 (-5.69; -1.82) for the pooled studies

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Since the Phase 3 pivotal studies had an identical design, pooled analyses were performed (please see the 
relevant sections above).  
Response across subgroups is consistent with the overall effect In terms of MADRS. Response seems to 
be somewhat higher in patients with higher median MADRS score at baseline.  
CGI-SS-R response across subgroups is consistent with the overall effect. As with MADRS, response 
seems to be somewhat higher in patients with higher median MADRS score at baseline. 
Post-hoc subpopulation analyses of MADRS total score, remission (MADRS total score ≤12), CGI-SS-R 
score and other suicidality indices, and resolution of suicidality (CGI-SS-R of 0 or 1) over time were 
performed by prior suicide attempt. The results suggested that response is higher across the endpoints in 
patients with prior suicide attempt. 
Concerns were raised that these post-hoc analyses were data driven and should be therefore handled 
with caution. The differential effect was almost completely driven by results of study SUI3001, the results 
could not be replicated in study SUI3002.   
Clinical studies in special populations 
The applicant has not studied the efficacy and safety of esketamine add-on treatment in MDSI in elderly. 
The TRD clinical program included a study in elderly, however it is considered that the TRD elderly patient 
population differs considerably from the MDSI patient population, for example with respect to 
concomitant medications. The proposed SmPC includes a statement in section 4.2 that esketamine has 
not been studied in elderly patients with MDD who have current suicidal ideation with intent. The 
applicant has not provided a discussion, while efficacy and safety in elderly MDSI patient population was 
brought under discussion in the provided CHMP scientific advices. Therefore, the applicant is requested to 
discuss in particular safety in the elderly MDSI patient population, taking into consideration the 
differences to TRD elderly population which is considered to largely preclude extrapolation from TRD 
studies to elderly patients with MDSI. (OC) 
Supportive study SUI2001 
In Study SUI2001, subjects were enrolled in the United States: 68 subjects were randomly assigned to 
receive double-blind treatment (36 subjects with esketamine + SOC and 32 with placebo + SOC), and 49 
(72.1%) subjects completed study treatment (27 subjects [75.0%] in the esketamine + SOC group and 
22 [68.8%] in the placebo + SOC group). 
The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar in the esketamine and placebo 
groups. Approximately two-thirds (65.2%) of subjects were female and 53.0% were white. The median 
age was 31.5 years, and the majority (54.5%) of subjects were aged 18 to 34 years. 
The key eligibility criteria for Study SUI2001 were consistent with the Phase 3 studies with the exception 
of the criterion for MADRS total score on Day 1. In Study SUI2001, subjects were required to have a 
MADRS total score of ≥22 predose on Day 1 of the double-blind treatment phase. The mean (SD) MADRS 
total score at baseline was 38.6 (6.53).  All subjects had current suicidal ideation with intent based on the 
current status of MINI Questions B5 and B9 (MINI for DSM-IV), and 62.1% of subjects had a prior history 
of suicide attempt (57.1% in the esketamine + SOC group and 67.7% in the placebo + SOC group).

Efficacy Results 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  
Results for the change in MADRS total score from baseline to 4 hours after the first dose demonstrated 
statistically significant improvement with esketamine + SOC versus placebo + SOC. Using an ANCOVA 
model, the LS mean (±SE) treatment difference was -5.3 (2.10) at Day 1, 4 hours after the first dose 
(2-sided p = 0.015). 
Other efficacy endpoints: 
•  Change in MADRS total score over time: The treatment difference based on MMRM analysis with 
observed case data numerically favored the esketamine + SOC group at all timepoints during the 
double-blind treatment phase. The LS mean treatment difference (95% CI) was -7.7 (-13.29; 
-2.06) at 24 hours after the first dose and -4.8 (-10.65; 1.01) at the endpoint of the double-blind 
phase (Day 25, 4 hours postdose). 
•  Change in CGJ-SR score: The differences between treatment groups based on ANCOVA of the 
ranks of change from baseline over time in the CGJ-SR score suggested a potential therapeutic 
effect of esketamine + SOC compared with placebo + SOC at Day 1, 4 hours after the first dose, 
and at Day 2, approximately 24 hours after the first dose. Further details are provided in the CSR 
(TRD/Mod5.3.5.1/SUI2001/Sec6.3.7). 
Response (≥50% improvement from baseline) based on MADRS total score,  remission of MDD (MADRS 
total score ≤12), sustained response (≥50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total score from 4 hours 
after the first dose through the end of the double-blind treatment phase), MADRS suicidal thoughts item 
score, patient-reported global assessment of suicide risk, BHS total score, and BSS total score have also 
been investigated.  
 Study SUI2001 was a supportive proof-of-concept study. It could be agreed that in this study, 
esketamine nasal spray 84 mg, compared to placebo, demonstrated a clinically meaningful and 
statistically significant rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in subjects with MDD who were assessed 
to be at imminent risk for suicide, as demonstrated by change from baseline in the MADRS total score at 
both, 4 hours postdose and on Day 2 (approximately 24 hours postdose) 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
There were concerns raised on the design and conduct of  clinical  studies. The proof-of-concept study 
SUI2001 evaluated the efficacy of safety of 84 mg intranasal esketamine, administered twice weekly for 
4 weeks, in adult hospitalized subjects with major depression assessed to be in imminent risk for suicide.  
The double-blind treatment period was 25 days, followed by an 8-week follow-up phase. Patients were 
randomized to receive either placebo of esketamine on top of SOC, including newly initiated of optimized 
antidepressant therapy (monotherapy or augmentation therapy). Patients were hospitalized at treatment 
initiation, and were recommended to remain in hospital for a minimum of 5 days.  As per inclusion criteria, 
the baseline MADRS score had to be ≥22. Current suicidal ideation with intent was addressed with two 
questions  from  the  MINI  interview.  The  primary  endpoint  was  the  change  in  MADRS  total  score  from 
Baseline  (Day  1,  pre-dose)  to  Day  1,  4  hours  post-dose  of  the  double-blind  phase.  Suicidality  was 
assessed on SIBAT-Clinical Global Judgment of Suicide Risk (CGJ-SR). 
The design of the two main phase 3 pivotal studies SUI3301 and 3002 was identical: double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center, international studies in adults with MDD, who have 
responded that they think about harming or of hurting or of injuring themselves and who intend to act on 
Assessment report

Page 87/163 
 
 
 
thoughts of killing themselves (questions B3 and B10 of MINI). These type of studies are common in 
depression and the design is in principle considered appropriate. 
As per inclusion criteria, the baseline MADRS score had to be >28. Current suicidal ideation with intent 
was addressed with two questions from the MINI interview. The key inclusion and exclusion criteria are in 
general acceptable. The mean baseline MADRS total scores in the subjects who entered the Phase 2 and 
3 MDSI studies corresponded to moderate to severe depression (mean scores: 40.4 in the pooled Phase 
3 studies and 38.6 in the Phase 2 study).  
Substance and alcohol abuse are relatively common in severely depressed patients and these patients 
could be potential candidates for esketamine treatment once brought to the emergency care due to 
suicidality. The proposed SmPC included a warning on individuals with a history of drug abuse or 
dependence, it was unclear whether this was sufficient in the patient population as described in the 
indication. This was further clarified when the final indication was agreed upon with the applicant. 
Sample size calculation was appropriate based on an effect size for the MADRS total score and a number 
of 451 patients in total (with 226 patients receiving Esketamine + SOC and 225 on placebo + SOC) can 
be considered sufficient. Randomisation was also implemented. Blinding was maintained by adding a 
bittering agent to the placebo nasal spray (as in the studies for TRD) and by using different raters to 
perform efficacy and safety assessments. 
With respect to demographics and baseline characteristics, it is noted that there were no differences, 
which could have impacted the results, between the treatment groups. 
The primary endpoint was considered appropriate to investigate the depressive symptoms (MADRS). 
With respect to the suicidality issue (key secondary endpoint CGI-SS-R and other indices such as MADRS 
Suicidal thoughts, CGI-SR-I, CGI-FoST, Patient reported FoST) it is unclear whether the 
scales/instruments used were appropriate. It has already been mentioned that there are reports in the 
literature suggesting that no diagnostic tool has demonstrated clinical value for the assessment of 
short-term suicide risk among high-risk individuals. CGI-SS-R, as part of the SIBAT, has undergone 
through a qualification advice and it was expected to be validated with the phase 3 clinical studies. 
The key secondary endpoint was the SIBAT derived Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Suicidality – 
Revised (CGI-SS-R). SIBAT is a tool developed by the applicant for assessing suicidality in patients with 
MDD. The CHMP has given qualification advice twice for this tool, it was also addressed in the given CHMP 
scientific advices. In these advices it was stated that the underlying assumption that increasing CGI-SS-R 
risk level is associated with an increased probability of suicide/attempted suicide/self-harm will need to 
be further substantiated. In addition, sensitivity to change and sensitivity to detect a treatment effect 
would  be  required  for  final  validation  of  the  SIBAT.  Nevertheless,  the  applicant  has  chosen  to  apply 
CGI-SS-R as key secondary endpoint, while it is not fully validated.  
Unfortunately, the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS) was not included in the pivotal phase 3 studies, 
as this was done in the Phase 2 study, to further assess the patient’s suicidality and to use this as anchor 
to validate the CGI-SS-R within the same study. Therefore, the CGI-SS-R is considered an exploratory 
outcome. 
There  were  also  concerns  raised  on  the  efficacy  data  and  additional  analysis.  In  the  proof-of-concept 
study SUI2001, the reduction in MADRS total score from baseline to 4 hrs was large. Difference of LS 
means  of  -5.3  is  statistically  significant  and  considered  clinically  relevant.  A  significantly  greater 
improvement in MADRS score was also observed in the esketamine group compared with the placebo 
group at ~24 hours, however concerns were raised that esketamine did not separate from placebo at 4 
weeks endpoint. 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 88/163 
 
 
 
There  was  no  effect  in  the  investigator-assessed  suicide  risk  at  4  hours  post-dose  as  well  as  24  hrs 
post-dose. 
In the main phase 3 Studies SUI3301 and 3002, ≥80% of subjects completed the double-blind treatment 
phase, which is a similar completion rate to the TRD studies. The mean duration of the current depressive 
episode was long. The applicant did not provide data on previous treatments (number of antidepressant 
treatments, including augmentation therapy, psychotherapy and possible ECT), which was then 
requested during the assessment to better characterise the included patient population.  
The treatment groups were fairly well balanced in terms of demographics and psychiatric history. 
In  study  SUI3002,  the  mean  duration  of  hospitalisation  during  the  study  was  considerably  different 
between regions. The same difference was not observed in study SUI3001. The applicant was requested 
to discuss the large difference between North America and Europe in study SUI3002.  
A few questions were raised on concomitant treatments, for example the most common combinations of 
drugs in augmentation therapy.  
The primary endpoint change in MADRS total score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose (day 2) 
was achieved. A rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in patients suffering from MDD with esketamine 
84mg twice weekly can be acknowledged. For the primary endpoint LS mean treatment difference in the 
change of MADRS total score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose (Day 2) was observed in both 
studies [SUI3001: -3.8 (SE=1.39); p=0.006 and SUI3002: -3.9 (SE=1.39); p=0.006]. For the pooled 
studies, the LS mean treatment difference (95% CI) at 24 hours after the first dose was -3.8 (-5.75; 
-1.89).  
The  observed  improvement  in  the  SOC  +  placebo  arm  is  striking,  considering  that  the  patients  were 
moderately to severely depressed as reflected in the mean MADRS baseline total score of ~40, and the 
fact that the primary endpoint was at 24 hours after the first dose of treatment. However, as patients 
could have been hospitalized for 48 hours before the first dosing (the screening period), a patient could 
have  been  under  intensive  medical  attention  for  up  to  4  days  at  the  time  of  the  primary  endpoint 
measurement. Nevertheless, esketamine demonstrated an improvement in depressive symptoms versus 
placebo  which  is  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant.  The  applicant  was  also  requested  to 
provide an analysis of change in MADRS score over time in subgroups (categories e.g. <5, ≥ 5 - 10, >10) 
per duration of hospitalisation, to examine the impact of time spent under intensive medical attention.  
For the 4 hours postdose on Day 25, the results were -4.1 (-6.74; -1.40) in Study SUI3001 and -2.7 
(-5.75; 0.28) in Study SUI3002. The results are in favour of the rapid antidepressant action of 
esketamine. However, the reasons for observing differences between the two identical phase 3 studies 
were unclear. 
Overall, these results are reassuring of the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in a subgroup of MDD 
patients. This can be considered confirmatory and underpins the consistent antidepressant effect of 
esketamine, which was initially demonstrated in the Marketing Authorisation procedure for Treatment 
Resistant Depression.  
However, the results with suicide indices and endpoints related to the suicidality (suicidal ideation and/or 
behaviour) of the patients cannot be considered convincing since no difference could be observed 
between placebo + SOC and Esketamine + SOC groups.   
The key secondary endpoint, change in CGI-SS-R score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose (Day 
2) failed to show a difference greater than 1 between the treatment groups [SUI3001 -0.3; SUI3002 -0.1 
and pooled studies -0.2]. Subjects in both treatment groups experienced improvement in the severity of 
their suicidality as measured by the CGI-SS-R scale at 24 hours postdose, although there was no 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 89/163 
 
 
 
statistically significant difference between treatment groups. Not even a direction of change in favour of 
esketamine can be seen. In study SUI3001, the median changes from baseline (range) at 24 hours were 
-1.0 (-5; 1) in the SOC + placebo group and -1.0 (-6; 2) in the SOC + esketamine group. The 
Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the treatment difference (95% CI) was 0.0 (-1.00; 0.00). (2-sided 
p=0.107). In study SUI3002, the median changes from baseline (range) at 24 hours were -1.0 (-6; 2) in 
the SOC + esketamine group and -1.0 (-5; 2) in the SOC + placebo. The Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the 
treatment difference (95% CI) was 0.0 (0.00; 0.00). (2-sided p=0.379). Even the use of complex, 
post-hoc analyses in subgroups could not reveal a substantial difference between the treatment groups. 
It is unclear whether a small effect favouring Esketamine + SOC can be attributed only to the effect of 
esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation and/or suicide risk. This effect could also be due to the overall 
management of patients during the double-blind treatment phase, since an improvement was observed 
for both treatment groups. As stated by the applicant, the beneficial effects of inpatient psychiatric 
hospitalization in diffusing the acute suicidal crisis in subjects in both treatment groups together with the 
effect of comprehensive SOC enhanced by twice-weekly study visits with extensive clinical contact, 
during the double-blind treatment phase, might have obscured a potential treatment difference on the 
CGI-SS-R score. 
The CGI-SS-R and CGI-SR-I scores do not seem to correlate well with the outcomes of the MINI, which 
further shadows the validity of CGI-SS-R as a measure to examine suicidality. As per MINI interview, 
100% of patients confirmed to think about suicide and intended to act, as was required per inclusion 
criteria. Majority of patients also thought of suicide often or frequently, and with severe intensity. 
However, there were quite some patients that according to the CGI-SS-R and CGI-SR-I were only 
moderately or mildly suicidal (36.8%), or were considered to be at most in moderate imminent suicide 
risk (40.8%). Furthermore, all of the suicide indices such as MADRS suicidal thoughts, CGI-SS-R scores, 
CGI-SR-I scores, clinician-rated FoST, and patient-reported FoST showed improvement from baseline to 
the end of the double-blind treatment phase for both treatment groups. There were only small differences 
(much lower than 1.0) observed between placebo + SOC and Esketamine + SOC [MADRS suicidal 
thoughts-0.20; CGI-SS-R -0.18; CGI-SR-I -0.16; CGI-FoST -0.09 and Patient reported FoST -0.05]. It is 
questionable whether these small potential beneficial effects may or may not be due to a reducing effect 
of suicidal ideation/behaviour by esketamine treatment.   
A larger proportion of patients in the esketamine group (compared to placebo) achieved remission of 
depressive symptoms (MADRS total score ≤12). At the double-blind endpoint (Day 25, 4 hours postdose), 
50% of subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and 37% in placebo + SOC group had a MADRS total 
score ≤12. The corresponding treatment difference (95% CI) was 13.1% (4.03; 22.19). A percentage as 
high as 37% of patients who achieved remission of depressive symptoms (MADRS total score ≤12) for the 
placebo group cannot be unnoticed. However, the beneficial effects of esketamine treatment on 
depressive symptoms could not be translated into a reduction of suicidal behaviour.  
Results in other secondary endpoints related to suicidality, such as resolution of suicidality (CGI-SS-R≤1), 
reduction of hopelessness using BHS and quality of life using QLDS, were small and of questionable 
significance. The differences observed per 100 patients in favour of esketamine 84mg plus SOC were in 
line with the results observed for the key secondary endpoint and other important suicidality indices, 
which could not demonstrate a statistical significant and clinically relevant difference in favour of 
esketamine + SOC treatment.   
Reducing suicidality was an essential part of the primary objective, as suicidal ideation is specifically 
mentioned in the context of reduction of depressive symptoms. As no improvement in suicidality was 
observed in the studies, the primary objective of the study was not fully met. 
The results of the open-label follow-up phase suggest minimal to absent differences between the 
treatment groups at Day 90, in terms of MADRS and CGI-SS-R. It is notable that in study SUI3001 the 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 90/163 
 
 
 
change in MADRS score from baseline to Day 90 is in favour of SOC + placebo group. However, the results 
should be interpreted with caution as they are open-label. SOC antidepressant treatment was to be 
continued as per clinical judgement during the follow-up phase, details on continuation of SOC 
antidepressant treatment were requested.  
Efficacy and safety in elderly patient population in the target indication has not been discussed, while this 
was brought under discussion in the provided CHMP scientific advices. The TRD clinical program included 
a study in elderly, however it was considered that the TRD elderly patient population differs considerably 
from  the  MDSI  patient  population,  for  example  with  respect  to  concomitant  medications,  which  was 
considered to largely preclude extrapolation from TRD studies to elderly patients with MDSI.  
Although, the population who participated in the two identical phase 3 clinical trials were those who 
responded positively to specific questions of MINI related to suicidal ideation/thoughts, it is highly 
unlikely (questionable) that it can reflect a true identifiable population in the clinical practice with actual 
suicidality issues (suicidal ideation/suicidal thoughts/prone to suicide). 
Esketamine + SOC showed a rapid reduction of depressive symptoms, as it was anticipated from the TRD 
program. However, there were no measurable (via suicidal indices) beneficial effects in managing 
suicidality in a specific subgroup of MDD patients. This renders the reliable identification of such a patient 
population in the clinical practice difficult.  
The key secondary endpoint and other important suicidality indices could not demonstrate a statistical 
significant difference in favour of esketamine 84mg plus SOC treatment. Other secondary endpoints did 
not provide supportive evidence.  
Due to the above concerns, the applicant was requested to justify the patient population of the proposed 
indication and to provide sound evidence how this patient population can be reliably identified in clinical 
practice. The Applicant acknowledged the CHMP’s concern that it would be difficult for prescribers to 
detect suicidal intent or to predict future suicidal behavior, and that currently available scales have limited 
utility in accurately identifying those patients who will go on to attempt or complete suicide. Taking this 
into consideration, the Applicant is proposing to revise the description of the patient population in the 
indication statement. Instead of “adult patients with a moderate to severe depressive episode of MDD 
who have current suicidal ideation with intent”, the proposed population is now described as “adult 
patients with a moderate to severe episode of MDD and current suicidal ideation or behaviour”. The 
intention of this rewording is to remove any connotation that prescribers are expected to assess and/or 
predict the patient’s “intent” or “risk” for future suicide. Instead, the assessment is based on the patient’s 
directly identifiable current symptoms. 
The Applicant presented a modified indication based on the below argumentation (please note key 
differences shown below in bold font and discussed hereafter in this response): 
Spravato, co-administered with oral antidepressant therapy, is indicated as acute short-term 
treatment for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms when this is urgently required in 
adult patients with a moderate to severe episode of MDD and current suicidal ideation or 
behaviour. 
Note: The effectiveness of Spravato in preventing suicide or in reducing suicidal 
ideation or behaviour has not been demonstrated. Use of Spravato does not preclude 
the need for hospitalisation if clinically warranted, even if patients experience 
improvement after an initial dose of Spravato. 
Suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior are common and discernible symptoms in patients with MDD. This 
population is therefore expected to be readily identifiable by treating clinicians, since assessment of 
suicidal ideation and behavior is part of the core competency for a psychiatry specialty. For patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 91/163 
 
 
 
 
MDD, monitoring and assessment of suicidality is a routine part of suicidal thoughts, intent to act on 
thoughts, plans and methods, past suicidal behavior, risk and protective factors and impulsivity. The 
company argued that there is no single test or assessment method that is proven to be an adequate 
predictor of suicide on an individual basis. The goal of suicidality assessment is, therefore, to identify, 
characterize, quantify, and manage those factors that contribute to clinical risk. Mental health 
professionals are well trained in identifying suicidal ideation and behavior. Although some patients may 
feel ambivalent and deny or conceal these thoughts and behaviours, they are usually able to be detected 
by way of psychiatric interview, collateral information from family, friends, and medical records. In 
addition, the target population includes patients who are actively seeking treatment or already 
undergoing treatment, and therefore may be more willing to share their concerns and symptoms with the 
clinician. 
Findings of a survey conducted on behalf of the Applicant by a third-party research organization, Cello 
Health Insight, suggest that prescribers are proficient at recognizing and identifying suicidal ideation and 
behavior in patients with MDD and do so regularly as part of routine evaluation. The survey included 671 
European psychiatrists and physicians actively treating patients with MDD across different healthcare 
settings in the UK (n=121), France (n=127), Germany (n=112), Italy (n=115), Spain (n=128), Belgium 
(n=38) and the Netherlands (n=30). The survey participants were asked to respond to the following 
question: “Thinking about your MDD patients, how do you normally assess and determine if there is an 
imminent risk for suicide?” Based on the verbatim responses, most respondents (91%) indicated that 
they assessed acute suicidality based on clinical evaluation and interview, including such elements as 
clinical/medical history, clinical assessment of suicidal ideation/intent and history of suicidality, 
psychological evaluation, discussion with the patient and family/caregivers. The majority of respondents 
indicated they performed a regular assessment of suicidality in MDD patients, with 57% of non-office 
based psychiatrists (n=426), 42% of primary care physicians/office-based psychiatrists (n=170), and 
40% of emergency room physicians (n=75) performing an assessment at least once a month. The 
findings in this report are in agreement with the knowledge that the CHMP team has accumulated up to 
now. 
The primary objective of these studies was to evaluate efficacy of esketamine + SOC compared with 
placebo + SOC for the rapid reduction of the symptoms of MDD. Therefore, the primary and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed on Day 2 (24 hours after the first dose). Results of the 
primary efficacy analysis showed a statistically significant difference in favour of esketamine + SOC 
versus placebo + SOC for the change in MADRS total score on Day 2, with very similar LS mean treatment 
differences observed in both studies (-3.8 in SUI3001 and -3.9 in SUI3002). 
Clear undisputed beneficial effects on suicidality indices have not been demonstrated, given that the key 
secondary objective of the Phase 3 studies [statistical difference between esketamine + SOC and placebo 
+SOC in the change in CGI SS-R score from baseline (Day 1, predose) to 24 hours after the first dose 
(Day 2)] was not achieved.  
The rapid reduction of depressive symptoms with the results from two pivotal studies (SUI2001 and 
SUI3002) has been recognised by CHMP [statistically significant difference between esketamine +SOC 
and placebo + SOC in the change in MADRS total score from baseline (Day 1, predose) to 24 hours after 
the first dose]. Despite the comprehensive SOC, which included initial hospitalization and 
initiation/optimization of antidepressant therapy, permitted benzodiazepine, and permitted 
psychotherapy, enhanced by twice-weekly study visits with extensive clinical contact, esketamine + SOC 
managed to demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference from placebo + SOC.  
The wording “when urgently required” was proposed by the company to further define the intended 
population. Per the NICE CG90 guideline, actively suicidal ideas or plans are amongst those factors listed 
as favouring urgent referral to specialist mental health services. Severity of depression and “danger to 
Assessment report

self” have been identified among key clinical variables important in disposition decisions in the psychiatric 
emergency room. In one Dutch study evaluating patients who were assessed by outreach psychiatric 
emergency services during the period of 2009 to 2014, suicidal behavior was identified in 66% of 
assessed patients with depressive disorder. 
The intended target population of “adult patients with a moderate to severe episode of MDD and current 
suicidal ideation or behavior” accurately reflects the population studied in the Phase 3 SUI3001 and 
SUI3002 studies. Subjects enrolled in these studies were required to present with current suicidal 
ideation with intent within 24 hours of randomization. Additionally, patients had moderate to severe 
depression (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] baseline score >28) and in the 
physician’s opinion, acute psychiatric hospitalization of the subject was clinically warranted due to the 
subject’s imminent risk for suicide. Subjects presented with consistent evidence of an acute psychiatric 
illness as measured by multiple suicidality indices: clinicians considered 90% of subjects as moderately to 
extremely suicidal at baseline (as measured by the Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Suicidality - 
Revised [CGI-SS-r]), and 86% as having moderate to extreme imminent risk for suicide within the next 
7 days (as measured by the Clinical Global Impression – Imminent Suicide Risk [CGI-SR-I] scale). In 
addition, a large proportion of subjects had current or recent evidence of suicidal behavior: 63.1% 
reported any prior suicide attempt; 27.3% (30.1% in the esketamine + standard of care [SOC] group and 
24.4% in the placebo + SOC group) reported a suicide attempt within the last month 
(Seq0006/Mod2.5/Sec4.2); and 19.1% (19.9% in the esketamine + SOC group and 18.2% in the placebo 
+ SOC group) reported a suicide attempt within the week prior to screening.  
The intention of this rewording is to remove any connotation that prescribers are expected to assess 
and/or predict the patient’s “intent” or “risk” for future suicide. Instead, the assessment is based on the 
patient’s directly identifiable current symptoms. 
Finally, the company proposed to add a new clarification to make it clear to the prescriber that Spravato 
has not demonstrated a direct, beneficial effect on suicidality. Given that the Phase 3 studies did not meet 
the key secondary endpoint, the Applicant has proposed to add a clarification note within the indication 
statement stating that the “effectiveness of Spravato in preventing suicide or in reducing suicidal ideation 
or behaviour has not been demonstrated “. This statement, and other related statements elsewhere in the 
SmPC, is intended to very clearly communicate to prescribers that they should not expect an 
improvement in patients' suicidality beyond the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms.  
The CHMP reviewed the proposed indication and could concur on the following: 
• 
• 
• 
in the clinical practice psychiatrists monitor patients for suicidal ideation or behaviour (since 
these patients belong to an increased risk group of depressed patients).  
that the patients included in the studies suffered from a moderate to severe episode of MDD [in 
the pooled Phase 3 dataset (full efficacy analysis set), 181 (80%) subjects in the placebo + SOC 
group and 189 (84%) subjects in the esketamine + SOC group had a baseline MADRS total score 
of score of ≥35 (i.e., severe depression].  
That these patients a) were thinking about suicide and b) intended to act on thoughts of killing 
themselves (MINI current Status) (Yes, in both questions, 100%) 
It is also considered that urgency should be maintained in the indication.  Inclusion of urgency narrows 
the target population to those most in need of rapid reduction of symptoms.   
The phrase “when this is urgently required” could be justified by the rapid reduction of depressive 
symptoms (already acknowledged from the TRD program and also seen in the MDSI clinical trials). 
However, this wording was considered to be expected to lead to misinterpretation by prescribing 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 93/163 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
physicians. The phrase “when this is urgently required” would only add unnecessary complexity to the 
indication or might increase the expectation that esketamine can relevantly reduce suicidality. 
Esketamine is currently thought to bridge the efficacy gap, providing urgent relief of depressive 
symptoms until the background Standard of Care (SOC) antidepressant therapy can exert its full effect. 
The “urgently required” term does not accurately reflect the expected esketamine use in the specific 
population.  
The CHMP preferred to emphasize the urgent need for rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in the 
indication but not to specifically mention patients with suicidal ideation or behaviour since this may be 
perceived as esketamine having shown an effect on suicidality. 
There were also concerns that the proposed indication mentioning suicidal ideation would give the 
connotation that Spravato is effective in the treatment of suicidality, while this was not demonstrated in 
the pivotal studies. Additional safety data provided by the Applicant regarding suicidal behaviour also did 
not allow for definitive conclusions to be drawn. Though a clear signal (i.e. statistical significance) cannot 
be established due to the low numbers, the data still indicate that there is a numerical difference in the 
occurrence of suicidal behaviour at the expense of esketamine, and thus a relationship can therefore not 
be excluded either.  
The company then suggested the following indication: 
“Spravato, co-administered with oral antidepressant therapy, is indicated as acute short-term treatment 
for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in a psychiatric emergency, as per clinical judgement, in 
adult patients with a moderate to severe episode of MDD (see section 5.1 for a description of the 
population studied)” 
Following further discussions within the CHMP, it was agreed that the latest indication as worded above 
was broad and implied that Spravato could be given in any psychiatric emergency which could be driven 
by complex psycho-social events and not necessarily acute relapse of depression. Thereby the CHMP 
proposed the following indication which was agreed upon by the company: 
“Spravato, co-administered with oral antidepressant therapy, is indicated in adults with a moderate to 
severe episode of major depressive disorder, as acute short term treatment, for the rapid reduction of 
depressive symptoms, which according to clinical judgement constitute a psychiatric 
emergency (see section 5.1 for a description of the population studied)”. 
With respect to the proposed note highlighting that effectiveness of Spravato in preventing suicide or in 
reducing suicidal ideation or behaviour has not been demonstrated, section 4.1 after the indications could 
be a possible place for such a note. However, several concerns exist with the lack of confirmatory and 
robust data for an effect on suicidal ideation and/or behaviour of patients. Furthermore, misuse has been 
associated with esketamine and specific measures are already in place to avoid or minimise that. Last, but 
not least, there is a possibility that patients, who have stopped receiving esketamine after 4 weeks of 
treatment, return or engage again to suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming themselves in the 
post-marketing setting. An increase in suicidality could then be observed, since the numbers of patients 
in the post-marketing setting are expected be higher than those in clinical trials and would lead to the 
detection of such cases.  
With regard to having a boxed note/warning, this should be used for safety in exceptional cases, not lack 
of efficacy. 
As a compromise, instead of a boxed warning, the information that the effectiveness of SPRAVATO in 
preventing suicide or in reducing suicidal ideation or behavior has not been demonstrated was included in 
the SmPC.   
It  was  also  agreed  that  the  need  of  hospitalization,  if  clinically  warranted,  as  well  as  monitoring  for 
suicidality, is included in the SmPC.    
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 94/163 
 
 
 
 
 
It has been agreed that there is a concern that it would be difficult for prescribers to detect suicidal intent 
or to predict future suicidal behavior, and that currently available scales have limited utility in accurately 
identifying those patients who will go on to attempt or complete suicide. It is also agreed that physicians 
will require some form of education and training. However, general recommendations and general 
treatment guidelines for monitoring suicidal ideation or behaviour in depressed patients may not be the 
most optimal approach and a more practical way should be proposed by the Applicant e.g. use of MINI 
together with medical history of patients (e.g. prior suicide attempts). The Applicant proposes to carefully 
educate and communicate with healthcare professionals to ensure that the appropriate population 
receives esketamine and what effects should and should not be expected. This educational approach 
however, is not described in detail in the responses submitted. The educational material for the 
prescribers was requested and provided satisfactorily prior to the finalisation of the procedure.  
A significant benefit for this uniquely vulnerable population, as characterised by the Applicant, could 
justify an additional 1 year market protection period. It was indeed shown that administration of 
esketamine led to rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in a subset of patients with MDD who have 
current suicidal ideation or behaviour and probably reflect an acutely ill population that requires quick 
intervention. It has to be taken into account that these increased risk patients have been excluded from 
previous antidepressant treatment trials and current standard of care for their management includes 
initiation or optimization of oral antidepressants and, frequently, hospitalization.  An unmet medical need 
for approved pharmacological treatments exists for such patients. It is expected that esketamine will 
probably bridge the efficacy gap due to the delayed onset of action of standard antidepressants, which 
may take several weeks to exert their full effect. 
The Applicant has revised the wording of the indication, taking into consideration the concern that there 
is no direct beneficial effect on suicidality and an improvement in patients' suicidality beyond the rapid 
reduction of depressive symptoms should not be expected. So related efficacy issues on suicidality were 
resolved. 
There were differences observed for some efficacy endpoints between the two phase 3 studies.  
It is acknowledged that results of the primary efficacy analysis showed a statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful difference in favour of esketamine + SOC versus placebo + SOC for the change in 
MADRS total score on Day 2 (24 hours after the first dose), with very similar LS mean treatment 
differences observed in both studies (-3.8 in SUI3001 and -3.9 in SUI3002, pooled studies -3.8). 
Likewise, the results of the key secondary endpoint (change from baseline in CGI-SS-r score on Day 2, 24 
hours after the first dose) were also very similar between the 2 studies. This was well clarified by the 
company during the assessment. The factors causing differences between study the two Phase 3 studies 
include: higher proportion of randomized subjects who received an antidepressant + augmentation 
therapy, longer mean duration of illness, higher proportion of patients who had a recent suicide attempt, 
higher number of discontinuations and longer duration with hospitalisation and “increased care” for the 
patients in study SUI3002 compared to SUI3001. 
The explanations for the differences observed between study SUI3002 and SUI3001 are plausible and the 
potential factors influencing the results are factual and part of the clinical practice.  
Also an analysis based on the MADRS severity (for the subgroup with MADRS =>35 at baseline) was 
requested to investigate whether severely depressed patients who are expected to be more prone to 
suicidal thoughts are affected by the treatment of esketamine plus SOC.   
The Applicant performed all the requested analyses. Baseline characteristics from the group of patients 
who had a MADRS score at baseline =>35 (N=370) were similar to those of the total clinical trial 
population (N=451). The results for the primary and important secondary endpoints using various 
analysis methods (MMRM and BOCF) were more pronounced in this more severely ill population, however 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 95/163 
 
 
 
comparable and consistent with the results in the overall trial population. The group of patients that had 
a MADRS score at baseline =>35 corresponds to the majority of the trial population 82%. It should be 
also noted that in this population with severe depression, effects on suicidality were not very different i.e. 
for the subgroup with baseline MADRS =>35 the between group differences in the percentage of subjects 
who achieved resolution of suicidality at Days 1, 2 and 25 were 16.2%, 4.6% and 5.6%, respectively. In 
the case of the overall population the respective between group differences in the percentage at Days 1, 
2 and 25 were 13.2%, 1.6% and 7.3%, respectively. Taken the data into consideration, it could be 
concluded that there is no sound scientific reason for the “isolation” or the “separation” of this subgroup 
from the overall trial population or specifically include this population in the wording of the indication. 
The proposed SmPC included a warning on individuals with a history of drug abuse or dependence, these 
patients  were  excluded  from  the  studies  while  substance  and  alcohol  abuse    is  relatively  common  in 
severely depressed patients and these patients could be potential candidates for esketamine treatment 
once brought to the emergency care due to suicidality. The applicant was requested to discuss whether 
the current warning in the SmPC is sufficient on other patient populations outside of TRD. 
 The Applicant’s proposal for the warning in the SmPC regarding these patients is meant to convey the 
need  to  evaluate  and  recognize  those  patients  at  risk  for  abuse  and  dependence  and  manage  them 
adequately during the treatment.  Given the limited postmarketing authorization experience available to 
date,  the  Applicant  preferred  to  take  a  conservative  and  consistent  approach  across  indications. 
Specifically, the Applicant recommended that the risk for abuse should be assessed prior to prescribing 
esketamine, and that patients should be monitored for the development of behaviours or conditions of 
abuse  or  misuse,  including  drug  seeking  behaviour.  The  Applicant’s  position  is  that  the  same  text 
regarding the warning on drug abuse or dependence is therefore appropriate for both the TRD indication 
and this new indication. 
The  applicant  approach  was  endorsed  by  the  CHMP.  It  is  considered  that  patients  with  a  history  of 
substance abuse or dependence can be treated with Spravato also in patients with severe depression, 
after careful consideration and in the context of close monitoring. As the intended treatment period for 
rapid reduction of depressive symptoms is short, the risk of abuse could be considered even lower than in 
the treatment of patients with TRD. 
The proposed warning in the SmPC was considered to be sufficient. 
The  primary  analysis  set  for  efficacy  analysis,  i.e.  full  analysis  set  was  acceptable  and  during  the 
assessment the company provided a per protocol analysis, with exclusion of major protocol deviations. 
The conclusions based on the full and per-protocol analysis were alike.  
To  better  characterise  the  included  patient  population  in  the  pivotal  studies,  the  applicant    provided 
details  on  previous  treatments  i.e.  number  of  antidepressant  treatments,  including  augmentation 
therapy, psychotherapy and possible ECT. 
The available data concerning previous treatments does not allow a full characterisation of the patients 
population as history of previous antidepressant treatments did not extend beyond 30 days prior to study 
entry. Based on these data, one might conclude the patients  included  in the  study have not received 
optimal  treatment  for  their  severe  depression,  as  for  example  only  4  patients  have  received 
psychotherapy.  It is unclear which proportion of patients  has received augmentation therapy as prior 
antidepressant use includes both treatment with single antidepressant and augmentation. Nevertheless, 
the  included  patient  population  was  clearly  in  need  of  rapid  reduction  of  their  depressive  symptoms, 
which most likely could have not been reached with optimizing their current treatment. The proposed 
SmPC included the following statements in section 4.2:   
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 96/163 
 
 
 
  
After 4 weeks of treatment with Spravato, the oral antidepressant (AD) therapy should be continued, per 
clinical judgement. 
In these patients, treatment with Spravato should be part of the comprehensive clinical care plan. 
This  advice  is  considered  adequate  to  cover  treatment  optimization  after  the  patients  depressive 
symptoms are improved with treatment with SOC + esketamine. 
The applicant has provided the requested data, which does not allow a full characterisation of patients’ 
treatment  history.  It  is  considered  important  that  the  patient’s  treatment  is  optimized  after  initial 
treatment period with esketamine, this is covered in the agreed SmPC.  
The applicant was requested to discuss the large difference in duration of hospitalization during the study 
in  North  America  and  Europe  in  study  SUI3002.  This  difference  was  not  observed  in  study  SUI3001, 
where the duration of hospitalization was similar between the regions. 
The applicant has adequately discussed the possible causes of the observed duration of hospitalization 
between geographic regions in study SUI3002. Due to a regional protocol amendments in a number of 
European countries, the duration of hospitalization was extended to 14 days in some European countries, 
which in turn affected the average hospitalization duration in the EU region. Some European countries 
stand out with very long duration of hospitalization, which is likely related to local treatment practises. 
This  is  also  observed  in  study  SUI3001.  It  is  noted  that  there  is  also  a  difference  in  duration  of 
hospitalization between in study In the United States, in study SUI3001 longer duration of hospitalization 
is observed in comparison to study SUI3002. This is likely due to inclusion of different study centres, as 
also mentioned by the applicant 
The applicant provided an overview of the most common combinations of drugs in augmentation therapy 
showing that those patients using augmentation therapy received many different combinations, a few 
also with 3 or more concomitant drugs.  This reflects the patient population in clinical practise. As the 
number  of  patients  per  a  specific  combination  is  low,  no  analysis  on  differential  response  to  SOC  + 
esketamine treatment per concomitant treatment could be performed. Many different combinations of 
drugs were used in augmentation therapy, which reflects the patient population in clinical practise. 
The  provided  MMRM  and  BOCF  analysis  on  the  primary  endpoint  demonstrated  similar  results  as  the 
primary analysis, however the applicant was requested to provide the p values from these analyses. The 
MMRM and BOCF analyses of primary endpoint show a statistically significant difference between SOC + 
placebo  and  SOC  +  esketamine,  in  line  with  the  primary  analysis  using  LOCF.  The  conclusions  on 
statistical significance based on the MMRM and BOCF analysis are alike to the primary analysis with LOCF.  
The applicant provided an analysis of change in MADRS score over time in subgroups per duration  of 
hospitalisation (categories e.g. <5, ≥ 5 - 10, >10).31 subjects in total were excluded from the analysis as 
the  duration  of  hospitalization  was  missing  for  these  patients.  The  results  seem  to  suggest  that  the 
treatment effects would be largest in patients with a hospitalization duration of <5 days. However this 
subgroup is rather small (39 patients) as compared to the other subgroups, and the confidence interval 
is wide. The results do not suggest differences in treatment effect between patients hospitalized for 5-10 
days  and  >10  days.  The  current  SmPC  does  not  address  hospitalization  or  inpatient  setting  at  the 
treatment initiation. Specific advice on hospitalization cannot be given. Based on the provided data, no 
recommendations  on  hospitalization  can  be  given.  The  current  statements  in  the  proposed  SmPC  are 
considered adequate. 
The results suggest minimal to absent differences between the treatment groups at Day 90. It is notable 
that in study SUI3001 the change in MADRS score from baseline to Day 90 is in favour of SOC + placebo 
group. The applicant was requested to provide details on whether and how SOC antidepressant treatment 
was continued during the follow-up phase. 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 97/163 
 
 
 
During the follow-up phase, all patients but one continued to receive SOC antidepressant therapy. The 
majority  of  patients  received  two  concomitant  ADs.  The  pattern  of  number  of  SOC  antidepressant 
therapies in the double-blind treatment phase and follow-up phase is similar in both treatment groups. 
Therefore the observed difference between the treatment groups in favour of SOC + placebo at Day 90 in 
study SUI3001 is in any case not driven by difference in SOC between the groups. The available data 
suggests that the added benefit of esketamine on top of SOC is gained in the first few weeks of treatment 
without any further benefit beyond this period. However any conclusions regarding efficacy beyond 4 
weeks of treatment cannot be made as the follow-up phase was open label.  
In overall no major changes occurred in the SOC AD therapy after the double-blind phase, albeit a higher 
number of patients received ≥3 AD therapies in the follow-up phase as compared to the double-blind 
phase, in both treatment groups. This might reflect optimizing AD therapy after initial treatment with 
esketamine. 
 The  applicant  provided  the  requested  data,  which  shows  similar  pattern  of  SOC  for  both  treatment 
groups in the follow-up phase. A larger proportion of patients received ≥3 SOC antidepressant therapies 
in the follow-up phase as compared to the double-blind phase, perhaps reflecting optimizing SOC. The 
SmPC section 4.2 addresses continuation of AD therapy adequately.  
The applicant was requested to discuss the efficacy and safety of esketamine in elderly patient population 
in the target indication. The TRD clinical program included a study in elderly, however it is considered that 
the TRD elderly patient population differs considerably from the so-called “MDSI patient population”, for 
example with respect to concomitant medications, which is considered to largely preclude extrapolation 
from TRD studies to elderly patients with MDSI. 
The  applicant  agreed  that  extrapolation  from  the  elderly  population  in  the  TRD  studies  to  elderly 
population which could be considered candidates for treatment with esketamine for rapid reduction of 
depressive symptoms, cannot be made. The proposed indication specifies adults as target population and 
lack of evidence in elderly is adequately addressed in the proposed SmPC.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Spravato is currently approved as add-on treatment for adults with treatment-resistant Major Depressive 
Disorder, who have not responded to at least two different treatments with antidepressants in the current 
moderate to severe depressive episode. The most commonly observed adverse reactions in 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 98/163 
 
 
 
  
treatment-resistant depression patients treated with Spravato were dizziness (30%), nausea (27%), 
dissociation (26%), headache (24%), somnolence (18%), vertigo (18%), dysgeusia (17%), 
hypoaesthesia (11%), and vomiting (10%).  
Because of the possibility of sedation, dissociative symptoms and increased blood pressure, patients must 
be monitored by a healthcare professional at each treatment session, followed by an assessment to 
determine when the patient is considered clinically stable and ready to leave the healthcare setting. 
Safety of esketamine in MDSI 
The primary safety assessment for the Major Depression with Suicidal Ideation (MDSI) program is based 
on data from the 2 completed Phase 3 studies (SUI3001 and SUI3002) and 1 completed Phase 2 study 
(SUI2001) in subjects with MDSI. 
In addition, CIOMS reports (for deaths, serious AEs, and pregnancies) are provided for 3 ongoing studies 
in adults with Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD) (TRD3008, TRD2005, TRD3006) and 1 ongoing 
study in pediatric subjects with MDSI (SUI2002). The Sponsor previously submitted an interim CSR for 
Study TRD3008 that included safety data up to a clinical cutoff date of 31 December 2018 and now has 
provided an updated report for the period of 31 December 2018 through 20 April 2019. For the other 
ongoing studies (TRD2005, TRD3006, SUI2002) cumulative CIOMS reports are provided through 20 April 
2019. 
The safety and tolerability data collected during the TRD clinical program are also considered supportive 
for the MDSI indication. 
In the Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies, safety was evaluated through AE monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, 
vital sign measurements, pulse oximetry, electrocardiograms (ECGs), nasal examination, nasal symptom 
questionnaire (SUI2001 only), and physical examinations including body weight. Specific scales were also 
used to evaluate symptoms of interest, including the CADSS, the Modified Observer’s Assessment of 
Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S). In addition, for Phase 3 studies (SUI3001/3002), responses from 
patient-reported modules of the SIBAT were mapped to corresponding categories of the Columbia 
Classification Algorithm for Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) 2012 Plus to assess suicidal ideation/behavior. 
Rigorous evaluation of events of special interest was performed as part of the MDSI program for 
esketamine, and involved analysis of all relevant safety information, including AEs as well as analysis of 
validated rating scales (eg, CADSS) and quantitative assessments (eg, ECG, vital sign data). 
The safety sets are defined by the applicant as follows: 
•  Studies SUI3001 and SUI3002 
In each of these studies, the all randomized analysis set included all subjects who were randomized 
regardless of whether treatment was received. The safety analysis set included all randomized subjects 
who received at least 1 dose of study medication in the double-blind treatment phase. The follow-up 
analysis set was defined as all subjects who completed the double-blind treatment phase and either 
entered the follow-up phase or provided AE data after the double-blind treatment phase. This analysis set 
was used for the safety analyses during the follow-up phase. 
•  Phase 2 Study SUI2001 
The all randomized analysis set included all subjects who were randomized regardless of whether 
treatment was received. The safety analysis set included all randomized subjects who received at least 1 
dose of study medication in the double-blind treatment phase. Safety analyses for the follow-up phase 
were performed on the safety (follow-up) analysis set which included all subjects who had at least 1 visit 
during the follow-up phase.

Patient exposure 
Across the completed Phase 3 studies (SUI3001, SUI3002) and the Phase 2 study (SUI2001) in MDSI, a 
total of 262 subjects received at least 1 dose of esketamine and 256 received at least 1 dose of placebo. 
The combined cumulative exposure to esketamine in the 3 completed MDSI studies was 15.8 
patient-years (13.8 patient-years in the Phase 3 studies), and the combined cumulative exposure to 
placebo nasal spray was 15.7 patient-years (13.9 patient-years in the Phase 3 studies). 
Exposure in Subjects with MDSI 
In the MDSI studies, all subjects were to receive esketamine 84 mg on Day 1, with a protocol permitted 
one-time dose reduction to 56 mg allowed after the first dose if a subject was unable to tolerate the higher 
dose. Subjects who had protocol-permitted dose reduction then received 56 mg for the remainder of the 
double-blind phase. 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies (SUI3001/3002), the mean (SD) duration of exposure to study medication 
was 22.2 (7.20) days in the esketamine + SOC group and 22.5 (6.42) days in the placebo + SOC group. 
During the double-blind treatment phase, all 227 subjects in the esketamine + SOC group received at 
least one esketamine dose of 84 mg. At least one esketamine dose of 56 mg or less was administered to 
45 subjects (19.8%); of those, 35 subjects (15.4%) required a protocol permitted one time dose 
reduction to 56 mg for tolerability reasons, and the remaining 10 subjects received a lower dose due to an 
administration/device error. 
In the Phase 2 study (SUI2001), the mean (SD) duration of exposure to study medication during the 
double-blind phase was 20.7 (8.49) days in the esketamine + SOC group and 21.5 (7.22) days for the 
placebo + SOC group. Of the 35 subjects in the esketamine + SOC group, all subjects received the dose 
of 84 mg on Day 1; 3 subjects had their dose reduced to 56 mg due to adverse events and 2 subjects had 
their dose reduced in error. 
In the Phase 3 studies, the median duration of initial hospitalization during the double-blind treatment 
phase was between 10 and 14 days.

Safety data is derived from two completed Phase 3 studies and one supportive Phase 2 study. The Phase 
3 studies provide short term exposure data for 262 patients in the esketamine group and 256 patients in 
the placebo group. The exposure is considered sufficient for a general safety assessment. 
Rate of discontinuation was low across the pooled phase 3 studies. The most common reason for 
discontinuation in the esketamine group was adverse event, whereas for the placebo group this was lack 
of efficacy. 
In the pooled phase 3 studies most subjects received all 8 doses of 84 mg esketamine/placebo in the 
double blind phase. Around 20% of subjects had a dose reduction to 56 mg and continued on the 56 mg 
esketamine dose. Of note, 10 out of 45 patients who received a reduced dose in the Phase 3 studies and 
2 of 5 in the Phase 2 did so due to an administration/device error. This means that 22% of all dose 
reductions in the Phase 3 studies as well as 40% of the dose reductions in the Phase 2 study were in error. 
This is somewhat puzzling, since the medication is not given out to patients but has to be administered 
under supervision at the study sites. The applicant is asked to provide more data about the medication 
errors and what measures could be undertaken in a clinical routine use to avoid this unusually high 
number of wrongly reduced doses. (OC)

Exposure in Subjects with TRD 
The safety profile of esketamine in the MDSI indication is also supported by data from the TRD clinical 
development program. This program includes 6 completed Phase 2 and 3 studies (1,708 subjects who 
received esketamine [611 patient-years of exposure] and 486 subjects who received placebo [107 
patient-years of exposure]) and the ongoing OL extension safety study TRD3008 (1,140 adult and elderly 
subjects who previously participated in the Phase 3 TRD studies [1,198 patient-years exposure]). The 
median duration of exposure in TRD3008 as of 31 December 2018 was 15.4 months (range: 0 to 31 
months). 
Across TRD studies, subjects received either fixed or flexible dosing with esketamine at a dose of 56 or 84 
mg (or 28, 56, or 84 mg in elderly subjects). As of 31 December 2018, across completed and ongoing 
Phase 3 TRD studies, 1,739 subjects had received at least one dose of esketamine 56 mg for 611 patient 
years of exposure, and 1,279 subjects had received at least one dose of esketamine 84 mg for 1,151 
patient-years of exposure.

Long term exposure data is only available from the development program in treatment resistant 
depression (TRD). No biological differences between TRD and subjects with major depressive disorder 
having current suicidal ideation with intent (MDSI) are to be expected, therefore the extrapolation of long 
term exposure safety data from TRD to MDSI is acceptable. However, since the applied use is for 
immediate symptom relief, long term treatment in subjects with MDSI is currently not intended. 
Adverse events 
Summary of findings 
Overall, esketamine nasal spray 84 mg was safe and tolerated in the Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies. The 
adverse events reported were generally consistent with the safety profile of esketamine observed in 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021

previous studies in subjects with TRD. There were no new or unexpected safety concerns noted with the 
administration of esketamine in the MDSI clinical program. As observed in the TRD program, most TEAEs 
reported during esketamine treatment, including those that were most common, were mild or moderate 
in severity, were observed postdose on the day of dosing, and resolved the same day. 
Incidence 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies (SUI3001/3002), 89.9% of the subjects in the esketamine + SOC group 
(n=227) and 75.6% in the placebo + SOC group (n=225) experienced at least 1 TEAE during the 4-week 
double-blind phase. The most common TEAEs (reported by ≥10% subjects) observed more frequently in 
the esketamine + SOC group versus placebo + SOC group during the double-blind phase were: dizziness 
(38.3% versus 13.8%), dissociation (33.9% versus 5.8%), nausea (26.9% versus 13.8%), somnolence 
(20.7% versus 10.2%), dysgeusia (19.8% versus 12.9%), vision blurred (11.9% versus 4.9%), 
paresthesia (11.5% versus 3.1%), vomiting (11.5% versus 5.3%), blood pressure increased (11.5% 
versus 4.0%), sedation (10.1% versus 2.2%), and anxiety (10.1% versus 7.6%). Headache was 
observed in similar proportion of subjects in both groups (20.3% vs. 20.4%).

During the follow-up phase, AEs were observed in 53.7% of the subjects in the esketamine + SOC group 
and 50.8% of those in the placebo + SOC group. The most common AEs (reported by ≥5% subjects) 
observed more frequently in the esketamine + SOC group than the placebo + SOC group were:

As expected, the adverse events observed in subjects with MDSI are comparable to those with TRD. The 
incidence rate during the double-blind phase was higher in the esketamine than in the placebo group.  The 
most common adverse events reported were dizziness, dissociation, nausea, somnolence, headache and 
dysgeusia. For the placebo group these were headache, dizziness, nausea and dysgeusia. Reporting of 
dysgeusia in both groups is likely the result of the intranasal route of administration, due to the added 
flavouring in both active and placebo device. The events were primarily in the area of expected CNS 
effects and can be expected to be either related to the known safety profile of esketamine or the 
underlying disease. 
The difference between treatment groups was less pronounced during the follow-up phase. During this 
phase, subjects did not receive esketamine or placebo, which is reflected by the lack of device or 
esketamine specific adverse events. Adverse events reported by subjects in the follow up phase either 
appear to be related to the underlying disease (e.g. depression, suicidal ideation) or a comorbid disorder 
(e.g. anxiety, insomnia). 
TEAE occurrence and resolution 
Most TEAEs in Phase 3 studies, including those most commonly occurring in esketamine-treated subjects, 
were reported on the day of nasal spray dosing. Of those TEAEs occurring on a dosing day, the proportion 
that resolved on the same day was 94.9% for the esketamine + SOC group and 85.2% for the placebo + 
SOC group in the pooled Phase 3 studies. 
The TEAEs with at least 50 total occurrences in the esketamine + SOC group were similar to the most 
commonly occurring TEAEs (≥10% of subjects reporting the event): dizziness, dysgeusia, somnolence, 
nausea, headache, paresthesia, hypoesthesia, sedation, dissociation, and blood pressure increased. Of 
these TEAEs, all except headache had at least 50 occurrences on a dosing day and ≥94.4% of those events 
resolved the same day.

Adverse events were closely correlated with administration of the study drug and usually of short duration 
and resolved in the majority of cases on the same day. For subjects receiving placebo, the percentage of 
adverse events occurring on the dosing day is lower, also for events resolving on the same day, probably 
as these are related to the underlying disease. These findings are consistent with what has been 
previously observed in the TRD studies. 
No information has been provided on the occurrence/resolution of adverse events on dosing days for 
Study SUI2001. The applicant provided this to allow for interpretation. 
Severity 
Across the Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies, most TEAEs were assessed by the investigator as mild or 
moderate in severity. During the double-blind phase of the pooled Phase 3 studies, severe TEAEs were 
observed in 13.7% of subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and 5.8% in the placebo + SOC group. The 
most common severe TEAEs among esketamine-treated subjects were associated with the known 
transient effects of intranasal esketamine administration and included dissociation (4.0% in the 
esketamine + SOC group vs. 0% in the placebo + SOC group), nausea (2.2% vs. 0%), and increased 
blood pressure (1.8% vs. 0%). Other severe TEAEs included those related to the underlying disease state 
(eg, depression, suicidal ideation), which were reported at low rates (<2%) in the esketamine + SOC 
group and occurred at similar rates in the placebo + SOC group. 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies, the pattern of occurrence and resolution for severe TEAEs was consistent 
with the observations noted for TEAEs of all severity categories. Most of the severe TEAEs had a median 
duration of ≤2.5 hours until resolution. The only severe TEAEs that were reported on a dosing day and not 
reported as resolved the same day were depression (2 events) and suicide attempt (1 event) in the

esketamine + SOC group and depression (1 event), depression suicidal (1 event), suicide attempt (1 
event), and erectile dysfunction (1 event) in the placebo + SOC group. 
In the Phase 2 study SUI2001, severe TEAEs were reported in 5 (14.3%) subjects in the esketamine + 
SOC group and 1 (3.2%) of subjects in the placebo + SOC group during the double-blind phase, with 
dysgeusia (n=3 [8.6%]) being the only severe event reported in >1 subject exposed to esketamine.

The pattern of severe adverse events was similar to those of mild and moderate severity. Severe 
dissociation, nausea and blood pressure increases were only found in the esketamine arm and not under 
placebo. Severe adverse event found in both arms (anxiety, suicide attempt, depression, suicidal 
ideation) were considered as probably related to the underlying disease. 
Supportive Ongoing Long-term OL Extension Study TRD3008 
As of the clinical cut-off date for the TRD3008 interim CSR (31 December 2018), 1,140 subjects with TRD 
were enrolled in this ongoing, long-term OL Phase 3 extension safety study. Overall, the TEAE data in 
TRD3008 were consistent with the findings of the completed Phase 2 and 3 studies in subjects with MDSI 
and in the previously completed TRD clinical studies. 
Adverse Drug Reactions 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are AEs that were considered to be reasonably associated with the use of 
esketamine based on a comprehensive assessment of available AE information. An analysis of ADRs was 
conducted based on AEs reported in 3 completed Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies, with support from the 5 
completed TRD Phase 3 studies (TRD3001, TRD3002, TRD3003, TRD3004 and TRD3005) and 1 
completed Phase 2 TRD study (TRD2003). A total of 1,971 subjects received esketamine and were 
evaluable for safety in these studies. 
A total of 47 individual preferred terms were identified as ADRs for esketamine across indications. To 
provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of subjects experiencing ADRs, some preferred terms 
belonging to the same medical concept were grouped together. 
The new terms determined to be ADRs for esketamine following the MDSI ADR assessment are similar to 
those previously identified in the TRD data. Overall, this evaluation demonstrated that esketamine had a 
consistent risk profile in the TRD and the MDSI clinical development programs. The ADRs identified for 
esketamine are not indication specific.  
Adverse Events by Organ System or Syndrome 
Anticipated Dosing-related Adverse Events 
Based on the known pharmacological properties and the well-characterized safety profile of esketamine, 
a number of events were categorized as anticipated dosing-related AEs determined to be associated with 
esketamine use. Specifically, this category included the following preferred terms: Anxiety, Anticipatory 
anxiety, Dissociation, Dizziness, Dizziness postural, Feeling abnormal, Feeling drunk, Nausea, 
Somnolence, Vertigo, Vomiting. 
As expected, in the pooled Phase 3 studies SUI3001/3002, anticipated dosing-related AEs were reported 
by 73.1% of subjects in the esketamine + SOC group compared to 38.2% of subjects in the placebo + 
SOC group in the double-blind treatment phase. In both treatment groups, most anticipated 
dosing-related AEs occurred on dosing days and most of these resolved on the same day. For both 
treatment groups, the events of dissociation, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, the number of events 
reported on a dosing day decreased from Day 1 to Day 8 with similar numbers of events reported from 
Day 8 to Day 25. 
Psychiatric and nervous system related events of interest 
•  Dissociative/perceptual changes captured using the Clinician-administered Dissociative States Scale 
(CADSS) rating scale peaked by 40 minutes postdose and typically resolved within 1.5 hours. 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 111/163 
 
 
 
 
 
Reported adverse events associated with these symptoms were primarily mild or moderate in 
severity, occurred on the day of dosing and resolved the same day. 
• 
Treatment-emergent AEs related to anxiety were reported more frequently in the esketamine + SOC 
group compared to the placebo + SOC group (13.2% vs 8.9% in pooled Phase 3 studies and 25.7% 
vs 12.9% in the Phase 2 study SUI2001) and approximately half of all events had onset on a dosing 
day. Anxiety was reported as severe in intensity in esketamine-treated subjects in isolated cases. One 
subject in the esketamine + SOC group in the Phase 2 study SUI2001 discontinued due to a TEAE of 
agitation. 
•  Dizziness was reported as one of the most common side effects of esketamine. Treatment emergent 
AEs in the category of dizziness/vertigo primarily (>90%) occurred on the day of dosing and resolved 
spontaneously the same day. Discontinuations due to TEAEs in the category of dizziness/vertigo were 
reported in isolated cases (2 esketamine-treated subjects in the pooled Phase 3 studies and 1 
esketamine-treated subject in the Phase 2 study SUI2001). No SAEs of or discontinuations due to 
dizziness or vertigo were reported in esketamine-treated subjects in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 MDSI 
studies. 
•  Sedative effects based on the MOAA/S scale and reported TEAEs of somnolence and sedation were 
generally mild, had an onset shortly after the start of the dose and typically resolved 1 to 1.5 hours 
postdose. None of the subjects who had MOAA/S score ≤2 had respiratory depression. In the cases of 
sedation, no symptoms of respiratory distress were observed and hemodynamic parameters 
(including vital signs and oxygen saturation) remained within normal ranges. There were no cases of 
respiratory depression reported in any of the MDSI studies and no clinically significant decreases in 
respiratory rate were observed. 
•  Across the Phase 2 and 3 studies in MDSI, psychotic-like symptoms were observed in isolated cases. 
No TEAEs of mania or hypomania were reported. 
•  A history of one or more prior suicide attempts was reported for approximately 60% of the 518 
subjects in the safety analysis set of the Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies. Prior suicide attempt is the 
single most important predictor of subsequent suicidal behavior. Across completed Phase 2 and Phase 
3 MDSI studies, rates of AEs potentially related to suicidality (ie, preferred terms consistent with the 
Standardised MedDRA Query [SMQ] for suicide/self-injury), including serious events, were similar 
between treatment groups in the double-blind and follow-up phases. One completed suicide occurred 
in the follow-up phase in a subject who was treated with esketamine + SOC during the double-blind 
treatment phase and who had a history of several prior suicide attempts (including one within 30 days 
of study entry). Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of first onset of any adverse event (AE) potentially 
related to suicidality (and for the AEs of suicide attempt or completed suicide) during the follow-up 
phase, there was no apparent difference between treatment groups for the time to first event after 
discontinuation of study medication. Assessment of the odds ratios for TEAEs potentially related to 
suicidality across the Phase 2 and 3 studies suggested a similar risk for suicidality AEs, including 
suicide attempts and completed suicides, for subjects in both treatment groups in each of the study 
phases. 
Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms 
• 
Treatment-emergent AEs potentially related to cystitis were reported by 3.1% of esketamine treated 
subjects in the completed pooled Phase 3 studies SUI3001/3002 and no subjects in the Phase 2 study 
SUI2001. There were no cystitis-related SAEs or TEAEs resulting in withdrawal of study medication. 
Post-dose Gastrointestinal Symptoms 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 112/163 
 
 
 
 
•  Nausea and vomiting were reported among the most common side effects of esketamine in the Phase 
2 and 3 MDSI studies. Most of these events occurred on the day of dosing and resolved spontaneously 
the same day, with the median duration not exceeding 1 hour in most subjects across dosing 
sessions. Discontinuation of study medication due to TEAEs of nausea and vomiting was reported in 
<1% of subjects in the pooled Phase 3 studies SUI3001/3002 and for a single subject in the Phase 2 
study SUI2001. Rates of reported nausea and vomiting decreased over time across dosing sessions. 
Abuse Potential 
• 
The TEAEs suggestive of abuse potential most commonly associated with esketamine included 
dizziness, dissociation and somnolence. These symptoms were predominantly reported shortly after 
dosing on the day of esketamine administration, were transient and self-limiting, and mild or 
moderate in severity. There were no reported TEAEs with Preferred Terms of drug abuse, drug 
abuser, drug dependence, drug detoxification, drug rehabilitation, drug tolerance, drug tolerance 
increased, or drug use disorder. 
Cardiovascular Effects 
• 
Transient increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 
observed in the Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies shortly after esketamine administration, reaching a 
maximum within 40 minutes and generally returning to values close to pretreatment within 1.5 hours 
after administration. The greatest mean maximum blood pressure (BP) increases across all intranasal 
dosing day compared to predose values in the pooled Phase 3 studies SUI3001/3002 were 14.3 mm 
Hg (SBP) and 10.0 mm Hg (DBP) for subjects in the esketamine + SOC group compared to the 
corresponding BP increases of 5.6 mm Hg (SBP) and 4.4 mm Hg (DBP) in subjects in the placebo + 
SOC group. 
• 
There were no clinically meaningful changes in ECG findings in the completed Phase 2 and 3 MDSI 
studies, including QTc interval or PR interval. 
The adverse events/adverse drug reactions observed in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) 
having current suicidal ideation with intent is comparable to the already established safety profile 
observed in patients with treatment resistant depression. No significant, unexpected safety signals were 
found during the two Phase 3 studies or the supporting Phase 2 study. Given that the study population in 
patients with MD and suicidal ideation is overall similar to those with treatment resistant depression and 
it is doubtful a biological differentiation between the populations is possible the similarity in safety profiles 
is to be expected. 
Sedation and somnolence were commonly reported with esketamine treatment and usually resolved on 
the same day as dosing. There was one subject that had an MOAA/S score of 0 and 1 on multiple dosing 
days, corresponding to severe sedation. Though the subject did not require medical intervention, such 
deep sedation has not previously been reported in the TRD studies. The applicant provided case report 
and discuss the relationship between the event and esketamine dosing. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Overall, across all completed and ongoing studies with esketamine in the MDSI and TRD indications, 8 
deaths have been reported up to 20 April 2019.

Table 34: Subject Who Died in All Completed and Ongoing Clinical Studies of Esketamine 
•  Completed Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies: In the completed Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies, 1 death 
was reported in 262 subjects who had been assigned to esketamine + SOC treatment in the 
double-blind treatment phase (15.8 patient-years of exposure) and 0 deaths were observed in 256 
subjects who had been assigned to placebo + SOC (15.7 patient-years of exposure). This death 
(completed suicide) occurred during the follow-up phase of SUI3001; no deaths were observed 
during the double-blind treatment phase of the SUI2001, SUI3001, or SUI3002 studies. 
o  Subject  was a perimenopausal 53-year-old Asian female with MDD at imminent risk for 
suicide, in the JNJ54135419 treatment group, who had an SAE of completed suicide on Study 
Day 27 (in the follow-up phase), that was classified as severe in intensity. The subject’s 
psychiatric history is notable for 5 prior suicide attempts, with the most recent suicide 
attempt by overdosing on medications occurred in the 30 days prior to screening. The subject 
has had 4 hospitalizations in the past 12 months due to depression or suicidality. Other 
notable psychiatric history at study entry includes anxiety and insomnia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021

The subject was hospitalized and screened for the study on Day -2. She was randomized on Study Day 1. 
She received first 6 doses of the study drug in the hospital and was discharged home on Study Day 17. 
The subject received the last dose of study drug on Study Day 24 and completed the double-blind 
treatment phase of the study. On the same day, the subject reported having depressed mood and anxiety 
during the 04 July holiday celebration (on Study Day 22) (Source: CIOMS). According to her husband, she 
may have been depressed and anxious after spending time with friends and family (feeling like everyone 
else’s life was better than hers). 
Relevant assessments on Study Day 24 included: predose MADRS total score of 9 and postdose (after 4 
hours) score of 3; predose MADRS-SI score of 1 and postdose (after 4 hours) score of 0; and CGI-SS-R 
score of 0. 
The fatal adverse event of completed suicide was reported on Study Day 27. On the same day, the subject 
was found dead (suicide attempt). An autopsy was not performed. The investigator considered major 
depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression with chronic passive and active suicidal ideation, and 
three suicide attempts within the last 9 months as the risk factors, and major depressive disorder as the 
suspected cause for the event of completed suicide. The investigator considered the event of completed 
suicide to be not related to the study drug. 
•  Completed Phase 2 and 3 TRD studies: As previously reported in the original esketamine MAA, 
there were 4 deaths reported among the 1,708 subjects who had received treatment with esketamine 
+ oral AD in the completed Phase 2 and 3 studies in TRD (611 patient-years exposure). No deaths 
were observed among the 486 subjects who had received placebo + oral AD in these studies (108 
patient-years exposure). The deaths included 2 completed suicides; 1 of which occurred during the 
follow-up phase of TRD2003 (20 days after last dose of esketamine) and the other occurred during 
the OP/MA phase of TRD3004 (last esketamine dose 12 days prior to death). Both subjects were 
reported to have experienced significant psycho-social stressors in the days prior to the suicide, and 
both events were considered by the investigator to be of no relationship to study medication. Other 
causes of death in the completed TRD studies were multiple injuries sustained during a road traffic 
accident during the double-blind phase of TRD3002 and death as a result of acute cardiac and 
respiratory failure during the OP/MA phase of TRD3004 in a subject with a history of hypertension, 
obesity, and vein surgery; these events were assessed by the investigator as not related and 
doubtfully related to study treatment, respectively. 
•  Supportive Ongoing Long-term OL Extension Study TRD3008: Up to the clinical cutoff date of 
the interim CSR (31 December 2018), 3 deaths were reported among the 1,140 subjects treated with 
esketamine in the ongoing extension study TRD3008. These included: 1 death due to completed 
suicide, which was considered by the investigator as not related to esketamine nasal spray; 1 death 
due to myocardial infarction, in a subject with a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, 
which was considered by the investigator of doubtful relationship to esketamine nasal spray; and 1 
death due to multiple injuries (accidental polytrauma) caused by being hit by an automobile while 
riding a bicycle, which was considered by the investigator as not related to esketamine nasal spray. 
Note that one of these deaths (completed suicide) was reported in the original TRD MAA. No other 
deaths were observed in this study (based on CIOMS reports) during the period from 31 December 
2018 to 20 April 2019. 
•  Ongoing Blinded Studies SUI2002, TRD2005, TRD3006: No deaths were observed in the 
ongoing, blinded studies up to 20 April 2019. 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 115/163 
 
 
 
  
So far there have been eight deaths, including four suicides, in clinical studies with esketamine in patients 
with TRD and MDSI. The non-suicide deaths were either due to cardiac or respiratory failure or due to 
traffic accidents. 
Although the sample size is small and none of the deaths were considered to be related to study drug by 
the investigators they all occurred in patients either on active treatment with or previously treated with 
esketamine. The one suicide in the Phase 3 study for MDSI occurred three days after last dose of study 
drug. 
The pattern of deaths does not allow for any clear conclusions. However, although there is no clear safety 
signal, the imbalance in observed suicides between the esketamine and placebo arm creates at least 
uncertainty the overall effect on suicidality/suicidal ideation. 
For the one completed suicide in the MDSI studies: subject (see above) only limited information is 
available from the provided narrative. The subject has received all 8 doses of esketamine and appeared 
to be responsive to treatment in terms of a reduction in MADRS, MADRS SI and CGI-SS-R scores. The 
final assessments on Day 24 were as follows: Predose MADRS total score of 9 and post dose (after 4 
hours) score of 3; predose MADRS-SI score of 1 and post dose (after 4 hours) score of 0; and CGI-SS-R 
score of 0. 
The investigator considered the event unrelated to esketamine and suspected the cause to be the 
underlying major depressive disorder. Based upon the subjects’ MADRS and SIBAT scores, the subject 
appeared to be in remission. However, there is some uncertainty that subjects treated with esketamine 
might engage more in suicidal behaviour. Therefore, the possibility that esketamine treatment could have 
induced brain plasticity leading to an increase in suicidal behaviour cannot be readily excluded. Upon 
CHMP request, the company provided a discussion on the relationship between pharmacodynamic 
changes induced by esketamine dosing and suicidality. 
Events Potentially Related to Suicidality 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies SUI3001/3002, the frequency of adverse events potentially related to 
suicidality (ie, preferred terms consistent with the SMQ for suicide/self-injury) occurring during the 
double-blind treatment phase was similar in the 2 treatment groups (7.5% in the esketamine + SOC 
group and 7.6% in the placebo + SOC group). During the double-blind treatment phase, SAEs potentially 
related to suicidality were experienced by 7 subjects in the esketamine + SOC group vs 8 subjects in the 
placebo + SOC group: suicide attempt (4 [1.8%]) subjects in each group), suicidal ideation (1 [0.4%] 
subjects vs 4 [1.8%] subjects), and depression suicidal (2 [0.9%]subjects vs 1 [0.4%] subjects. In the 
Phase 2 study SUI2001 during the double-blind treatment phase, TEAEs potentially related to suicidality 
were reported for 3 (8.6%) subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and no subjects in the placebo + SOC 
group: suicidal ideation (2 subjects) and self-injurious ideation (1 subject). Two subjects in the 
esketamine + SOC group and no subjects in the placebo + SOC group reported SAEs (preferred term 
suicidal ideation) in this category. 
During the follow-up phase of the pooled Phase 3 studies SUI3001/3002, the incidence of these events 
was similar in subjects previously exposed to esketamine + SOC (11.1%) or placebo + SOC (10.3%). 
Seventeen subjects in the esketamine + SOC group experienced SAEs potentially related to suicidality vs 
13 subjects in the placebo + SOC group: suicide attempt (7 [3.7%] subjects vs 3 [1.6%] subjects), 
suicidal ideation (5 [2.6%] subjects vs 6 [3.2%] subjects)-, depression suicidal (5 subjects each), and 
completed suicide (1 [0.5%] subject vs 0 subjects). 
During the follow-up phase of the Phase 2 study SUI2001, the incidence of TEAEs potentially related to 
suicidality was higher in the placebo + SOC group: 2 (7.4%) of 27 subjects in the esketamine + SOC 
group: intentional self-injury and suicidal ideation (1 subject each) and 5 (22.7%) of 22 subjects in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 116/163 
 
 
 
placebo + SOC group: suicide attempt (3 subjects), suicidal ideation, and self-injurious ideation (1 
subject each). Serious AEs potentially related to suicidality were reported by 1 subject in the esketamine 
+ SOC group (suicidal ideation) and 4 subjects in the placebo + SOC group (suicide attempt [3 subjects] 
and suicidal ideation [1 subject]). 
The reported frequencies of suicide attempt/completed suicide during the double-blind treatment phase 
(1.5% in the esketamine + SOC group and 1.6% in the placebo + SOC group) and follow-up phase (3.7% 
in the esketamine + SOC group and 2.9% in the placebo + SOC group) for the pooled Phase 2 and 3 
studies was similar in the 2 treatment groups. In the pooled Phase 2 and 3 studies, there were no 
completed suicides during the double-blind treatment phase and 1 completed suicide in a subject 
previously exposed to esketamine during the follow-up phase. 
Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates of first onset of any AE potentially related to suicidality (and for the AEs 
of suicide attempt or completed suicide) during the follow-up phase, there was no apparent difference 
between treatment groups for the time to first event after discontinuation of study medication. 
Assessment of the odds ratios for TEAEs potentially related to suicidality across the Phase 2 and 3 studies 
suggested a similar risk for suicidality AEs, including suicide attempts and completed suicides, for 
subjects in both treatment groups in each of the study phases. 
Across all completed and ongoing studies of esketamine in both indications, 4 completed suicides were 
reported in subjects who received esketamine during the double-blind or open-label treatment phase (3 
subjects in TRD studies and 1 subject in an MDSI study). This corresponds to an incidence of 0.22 
completed suicides per 100 patient-years of exposure, ie, a rate comparable to that found per 100 
patient-years of exposure in a meta-analysis of studies in MDD patients treated with antidepressants 
(0.22) and lower than the rate reported in another meta-analysis in TRD patients receiving various 
treatments (0.47).

 Overall, the frequency of adverse events related to suicidality appears similar in the esketamine and 
placebo group. Within the pooled Phase 3 data there is a statistically non-significant imbalance with

numerically slightly more events in the esketamine arm for self-injury during the double-blind phase [3 
(1.3%) for placebo + SOC group versus 7 (3.1%) for Esk 84mg +SOC] and for suicide attempts in the 
follow up phase [3 (1.6%) for placebo + SOC group versus 7 (3.7%) for Esk 84mg +SOC]. If the Phase 
2 data are also taken into consideration the imbalance for self-injury remains while suicide attempts are 
now more balanced between treatment groups. Contrastingly, the placebo group experienced more 
suicidal thoughts (suicidal ideation, depression suicidal) than the esketamine group during active 
treatment. However, the numbers are too small to allow definite and reliable conclusions. 
The sample size is far too small to draw any reliable conclusions from these data. However, there appears 
to be at least the possibility that subjects treated with esketamine are more involved in self harm in either 
the form of self injury or a suicidal attempt compared to the placebo group. According to the applicant, 
none of these events were related to the study drug administered. However, a discussion as to why this 
is concluded is missing. Currently it cannot be excluded whether the esketamine dose itself, or any of the 
esketamine-associated side effects such as dissociation leads to increased suicidal behavior.  To facilitate 
the interpretation of the relationship between esketamine and suicidality events, the applicant provided 
descriptive statistics on when the following suicidality related events occur and their temporal relationship 
with a study drug dosing day: suicide attempt, intentional self injury, intentional overdose, completed 
suicide. Case reports for these events were also provided. While so far there is no clear safety signal 
detected these data do cast further doubt on any positive effect (besides the expected anti-depressive 
effects) for treatment of patients with  suicidality/suicidal ideation. 
Several oral anti-depressive drugs are known to increase risk of suicides. If a similar risk might exist for 
esketamine is unknown at this time. An argument can be made, that in theory the rapid onset of efficacy 
should reduce risk for patients with suicidal ideation. The observed non-significant imbalances in the 
treatment arms would however rather point in the opposite direction. Overall, based on the safety data, 
it can only be concluded that the effect of esketamine on suicidal ideation remains currently unclear.  
C-CASA 2012 Plus 
For the pooled Phase 3 studies SUI3001/3002, responses from patient-reported modules of the SIBAT 
were mapped to corresponding categories of the C-CASA 2012 Plus (an extended version of C-CASA 
2012).10 Using the C-CASA 2012 Plus, suicide assessments were classified using 18 categories: 
Suicidal Ideation (SI-1 to SI-X) 
SI-1: Passive Suicidal ideation 
SI-2: Active Suicidal Ideation: Non-specific (no method, intent or plan) 
SI-3: Active Suicidal Ideation: method, but no intent or plan 
SI-4: Active Suicidal Ideation: method and intent, but no plan 
SI-5: Active Suicidal Ideation: method, intent and plan 
SI-X: Active Suicidal Ideation: other

Pooled Phase 3 Studies SUI3001/ SUI3002-Double-blind Treatment Phase 
At baseline, the data for most subjects were mapped to the C-CASA 2012 Plus category ‘Suicide Attempt’, 
‘Aborted Suicide Attempt’, or ‘Interrupted Suicide Attempt’ (76.1% of subjects in the esketamine + SOC 
group and 75.1% of subjects in the placebo + SOC group). Based on the C-CASA mapping, all 
post-baseline ‘Suicide Attempts’ were cross referenced with AE reporting of ‘Suicide Attempts’ and 
queried if an event was not reported as an AE. It is important to note that several self-reported ‘Suicide 
Attempts’ from the SIBAT C-CASA mapping were confirmed not to be ‘Suicide Attempts’ per the 
investigator. 
In both treatment groups, the majority of subjects’ most severe postbaseline C-CASA severity category 
during the double-blind treatment phase was suicidal ideation (66.4% of subjects in the esketamine + 
SOC group and 69.3% of subjects in the placebo + SOC group). 
The most severe postbaseline category versus baseline during the double-blind treatment phase has been 
presented.  
•  Of the subjects with a baseline severity category of suicidal ideation, 1 of 21 esketamine + SOC 
subjects and 1 of 28 placebo + SOC subjects had a most severe postbaseline severity category of 
‘suicidal behavior’. 
•  Of the subjects with a baseline severity category of suicidal behavior, the proportion of subjects 
in the esketamine + SOC group and in the placebo + SOC group with no postbaseline suicidal 
behavior was similar (81% [153 of 189 subjects]) vs 80% [152 of 190 subjects]). 
•  Of the subjects with a baseline severity category of suicidal behavior, 36 of 189 (19.0%) subjects 
in the esketamine + SOC group and 38 of 190 (20.0%) subjects in the placebo + SOC had a most 
severe postbaseline severity that remained in the suicidal behavior category.

Those with suicidal behavior at baseline more often had suicidal ideation as most severe postbaseline 
category in the double blind, however a similar proportion of subjects remained within this category for 
both esketamine (17.1%) as well as placebo group (17.4%).  
Intentional self injury did occur during the double blind phase (see discussion above). But this is not 
reflected in Table 40 above, where none had self-injurious behavior as worst post baseline category. It 
is unclear where intentional self injury fits into the C-CASA 2012 plus categories, as this behavior appears 
to be missing from the table. The applicant clarified this.

Subjects 18 to 24 Years Old During the Double-blind Treatment Phase 
In the 18 to 24 years old subgroup, there were 39 subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and 40 
subjects in the placebo + SOC group. Assessment of C-CASA 2012 Plus mapping for subjects 18 to 24 
years old was similar to the overall population. At baseline, the data for most subjects were mapped to 
the C-CASA 2012 Plus categories of ‘Suicide Attempt’, ‘Aborted Suicide Attempt’, or Interrupted Suicide 
Attempt’ (79.5% of subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and 77.5% of subjects in the placebo + SOC 
group). In both treatment groups, the majority of subjects’ most severe postbaseline C-CASA severity 
category during the double-blind treatment phase was suicidal ideation (60.0% of subjects in the 
esketamine + SOC group and 62.5% of subjects in the placebo + SOC group). 
•  Of the subjects with a baseline severity category of suicidal ideation (1 subject in the esketamine 
+ SOC group and 3 subjects in the placebo + SOC group), none had a most severe post baseline 
category of suicidal behavior. 
•  Of the subjects with a baseline severity category of suicidal behavior, the proportion of subjects 
in the esketamine + SOC group and in the placebo + SOC group with no postbaseline suicidal 
behavior was similar (78.8% [26 of 33 subjects] vs 70.3% [26 of 37 subjects). Seven of 33 
(21.2%) subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and 11 of 37 (29.7%) subjects in the placebo 
+ SOC group with a baseline category of suicidal behavior had a most severe postbaseline 
severity that remained in the suicidal behavior category. 
A separate subgroup analysis on suicidality in 18 to 24 year old subjects was discussed by applicant. The 
proportion of subjects who remained in the suicidal behavior category as most severe post baseline 
category is somewhat higher than what is observed in older adults (21.2% for esketamine and 29.7% for 
placebo respectively).   
Follow-up phase 
According to the applicant, the proportion of subjects whose data were mapped to individual C-CASA 
2012 Plus categories was generally similar between the treatment groups throughout the follow-up 
phase. One subject, with a baseline category of suicide attempt, in the esketamine + SOC group had a 
completed suicide in the Day 32 (follow-up) analysis visit window which occurred on Study Day 27. In 
both treatment groups, the majority of subjects’ most severe postbaseline C CASA severity category 
during the follow-up phase was suicidal ideation (50.8% of subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and 
56.2% of subjects in the placebo + SOC group). Forty-one (21.7%) subjects in the esketamine + SOC 
group and 33 (17.8%) subjects in the placebo + SOC group had a most severe postbaseline C-CASA 
severity category of suicidal behavior in the follow-up phase. 
• 
• 
In the esketamine + SOC group, none of 20 subjects with a baseline severity category of suicidal 
ideation had a most severe postbaseline severity category of suicidal behavior. 
In the placebo + SOC group, 3 (14%) of 22 subjects with a baseline severity category of suicidal 
ideation had a most severe postbaseline severity category of suicidal behavior.

Assessment report

There were 32 follow-up analysis set subjects in each treatment group in the 18 to 24 years old subgroup. 
The proportion of subjects 18 to 24 years old whose data were mapped to individual C-CASA 2012 Plus 
categories during the follow-up phase was generally similar between the treatment groups throughout 
the follow-up phase and similar to the overall follow-up analysis set. In both treatment groups, the most 
severe postbaseline severity category for most subjects 18 to 24 years old during the follow-up phase was 
suicidal ideation (41.9% of subjects in the esketamine + SOC group vs 46.9% of subjects in the placebo 
+ SOC group) or suicidal behavior (35.5% of subjects in the esketamine + SOC group vs 34.4% of 
subjects in the placebo + SOC group). 
•  Of the subjects with a baseline severity category of suicidal ideation (1 subject in the esketamine 
+ SOC group and 3 subjects in the placebo + SOC group), 1 subject in the placebo + SOC group 
had a most severe post baseline category of suicidal behavior. 
•  Of the subjects with a baseline severity category of suicidal behavior, 41.3% (12 of 29) of 
subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and 48.3% (14 of 29) of subjects in the placebo + SOC 
group had a most severe post baseline severity category of suicidal ideation. Ten of 29 subjects 
(34.5%) in the esketamine + SOC group and 10 of 29 subjects in the placebo + SOC group 
(34.5%) with a baseline category of suicidal behavior had a most severe postbaseline severity 
that remained in the suicidal behavior category. 
In the follow up phase, it appears that suicidal behavior as most severe postbaseline category is reported 
with a higher frequency in the young adults (18 – 24 years) compared to the adults. For the esketamine 
groups these are 35.5% and 21.7% for the young adults and adults respectively. For the placebo group 
this was 34.4% and 17.8% for the young adults and adults respectively. However, the data is difficult to 
interpret as subjects are not treated with the study drug during this period.  
Suicidality in young adults 
Thus, it appears that young adults engage more in suicidal behavior compared to the older adults. It is 
unclear whether this group contributes more to the suicidality related adverse events observed across the 
MDSI studies than the adults. The applicant was requested to display the suicidality related adverse 
events observed in the completed MDSI studies per age group (18 – 24 years, > 24 years) to allow for 
further interpretation. In addition, a discussion was warranted why suicidal behavior occurred more 
frequently in the younger population compared to the adults.  
Overall discussion/conclusion on suicidality  
The incidences of suicidality related events are similar between the placebo and esketamine groups 
across studies SUI3001 and 3002. However, when evaluating the type of events, there is a suggestion 
that esketamine treated subjects engage more in self-harm/suicidal behavior. Subjects treated with 
placebo, in contrast, experience more suicidal ideation. This occurs both in the double blind and the follow 
up phase. Moreover, there was one completed suicide in the esketamine group (see section on “deaths” 
above).   
In the TRD studies discussed in the original MAA, suicidality did not appear to be increased during the 
initial weeks of treatment. Events were reported in the esketamine groups with an incidence of around < 
4% for the induction and maintenance phases of the studies. In the MDSI studies an incidence of 7.5% is 
reported in the esketamine group during initial treatment (double blind). 
It is acknowledged that the study population in the MDSI studies is more severe than the population that 
was studied in the TRD trials. However, the finding that subjects treated with esketamine engage more in 
suicidal behavior compared to the placebo group required further discussed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 126/163 
 
 
 
In addition, it also appears that young adults (aged 18 – 24 years) experience more suicidal behavior than 
the older adults. This was also requested to be further addressed. 
Serious Adverse Events 
In the Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies, SAEs were reported in subjects receiving esketamine + SOC at rates 
that were low and generally similar to those in subjects receiving placebo + SOC. 
In the double-blind phase of the pooled Phase 3 studies SUI3001/3002, SAEs were reported for 9 (4.0%) 
subjects in the esketamine + SOC group (suicide attempt, depression suicidal, 
depersonalization/derealization disorder, depression, suicidal ideation, and diabetic ketoacidosis) and 12 
(5.3%) subjects in the placebo + SOC group (suicide attempt, depression suicidal, depression, suicidal 
ideation, aggression, arrhythmia, pericardial effusion, hypertransaminasemia, and pneumothorax). After 
discontinuation from the double-blind phase, 3 (1.3%) subjects in the esketamine + SOC group 
experienced SAEs (suicidal ideation and acute psychosis) versus 2 (0.9%) subjects in the placebo + SOC 
group (depression suicidal, major depression, and suicide attempt).

In the Phase 2 study SUI2001, SAEs were observed in 4 (11.4%) subjects in the esketamine + SOC group 
and 0 subjects in the placebo + SOC group during the double-blind phase, and in 1 (3.7%) subject and 5 
(22.7%) subjects, respectively, during the follow-up phase. 
Supportive Ongoing Long-term OL Extension Study TRD3008: Up to the clinical cutoff date of the 
TRD3008 interim CSR (31 December 2018) (median duration of exposure: 15.4 months), a total of 91 of 
1,140 (8.0%) subjects exposed to esketamine + oral AD had experienced at least 1 SAE. Based on the 
review of CIOMS data between the period of 31 December 2018 and 20 April 2019, 17 subjects reported 
a SAE. Overall, the SAEs reported in this ongoing extension study were consistent with those observed in 
the completed clinical studies in subjects with MDSI or TRD. No new safety signals were identified. 
Ongoing Blinded Studies SUI2002, TRD2005, TRD3006: Based on review of CIOMS data up to the clinical 
cutoff date of 20 April 2019, a total of 23 subjects in these ongoing, blinded studies had reported at least 
1 SAE. Overall, no new safety signals were identified. 
The frequency of serious adverse events was slightly higher in the placebo arm during the double-blind 
treatment phase and comparable in both arms during the follow-up phase. The overall frequency of 
reported adverse events in the follow up phase was higher compared to the double blind phase. This 
might be due to some serious adverse events actually being related to the underlying disease. For 
example, the number of suicidal ideations that were rated as serious in the placebo arm was four 
compared with just one in the esketamine arm. In contrast when looking at all adverse events related to 
suicidality (see above) the rate of suicidal ideation during the double-blind period was comparable in both 
arms.

Most of the serious adverse events reported in the double blind phase are related to suicidality. According 
to the applicant, the only serious events possibly related to esketamine treatment were a suicide attempt 
and one case of depersonalisation. No discussion of the relationship between esketamine and these 
events was provided by the applicant. This was requested to be provided. 
There is no clear pattern of any serious adverse events that seem to be related to esketamine treatment. 
Overall, the frequency is low and comparable to previous experience in patients with treatment resistant 
depression. 
Laboratory findings 
The overall clinical laboratory test results with esketamine in the completed Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies 
did not suggest any safety concerns associated with the use of this drug in patients with MDSI. No 
clinically meaningful changes in mean laboratory analytes (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis 
parameters) from baseline were observed in the completed Phase 2 and 3 studies in MDSI. 
Findings Relevant to Hepatic Safety 
There was no evidence of treatment-emergent hepatotoxicity associated with esketamine nasal spray in 
the MDSI studies. Across the completed Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies, increases in alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred at low rates in both 
the esketamine + SOC and placebo + SOC groups (pooled SUI3001/3002: 3 [1.5%] vs. 3 [1.6%] 
subjects, respectively; SUI2001: 1 [3.2%] vs. 0 subjects, respectively). No increases in aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) >3×ULN or total serum bilirubin levels >2×ULN were observed in any study; no 
subject met the criteria for severe drug-induced hepatocellular injury as defined by Hy’s law. No TEAEs in 
the hepatobiliary disorders system organ class were observed in the esketamine + SOC group in the 
Phase 2 or 3 studies (compared with 1 subject in the placebo + SOC group [study SUI3001] who had a 
TEAE of hypertransaminasemia). 
There were no safety concerns based on the clinical laboratory findings. 
Safety in special populations 
Adverse Events by Subgroup 
Although sex, race, and age-associated differences in AE rates were observed for some preferred terms 
in the pooled Phase 3 studies, the results did not suggest that administration of esketamine was 
associated with a clinically meaningful increased risk in any of the subgroups evaluated. Furthermore, 
there were no consistent, meaningful differences in the TEAE rates in the pooled Phase 3 studies based on 
geographic region, SOC antidepressant therapy as randomized (antidepressant monotherapy or 
antidepressant + augmentation), baseline SIBAT: prior suicide attempt (yes, no), or baseline suicide 
attempt within the last month (yes, no). 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
The risks of esketamine during pregnancy or breast-feeding have not been studied. All Sponsor 
conducted clinical studies with esketamine in TRD and MDSI specifically excluded women who were 
pregnant, or lactating, as well as women who planned to get pregnant and men who planned to father a 
child within 3 months after the last dose of study drug. Subjects who became pregnant were to have been 
discontinued from the study. 
Across all completed and ongoing studies in the MDSI and TRD indications, 11 pregnancies have been 
reported in subjects who were exposed to esketamine or placebo as of the clinical cutoff date of 20 April 
2019 (8 cases in Phase 3 studies, 2 cases in Phase 2 studies, and 1 case in a Phase 1 study). Eight of these 
cases were previously reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 131/163 
 
 
 
The 3 new cases included 2 pregnancies in TRD3008 (outcome: spontaneous abortion and 
elective abortion, respectively), and 1 pregnancy in SUI3001 (placebo + SOC group) (outcome: 
spontaneous abortion). Three pregnancies were previously reported in partners of male subjects 
who received esketamine in Phase 3 TRD studies. The outcome for Subject /TRD3008 indicated 
that the female partner delivered a healthy baby in 2018 and ‘everything was normal’). As of the 
20 April 2019, 1 additional pregnancy was reported in a partner of male subject who received 
esketamine (84 mg) in the Phase 3 study TRD3008 (outcome: unknown). 
Per the agreed EU SmPC,71 esketamine nasal spray is not recommended during pregnancy and in women 
of childbearing potential not using contraception. There are no or limited data on the use of esketamine 
in pregnant women. 
No safety signals were detected for specific subgroups.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies SUI3001/3002, 14 (6.2%) subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and 8 
(3.6%) subjects in the placebo + SOC group experienced TEAEs leading to discontinuation of intranasal 
study medication. TEAEs that led to discontinuation in >1 subject in the esketamine + SOC group were: 
dissociation (3 subjects), depersonalization/derealisation disorder, nausea, and blood pressure increased 
(2 subjects each). 
In the Phase 2 study SUI2001, 5 (14.3%) subjects in the esketamine + SOC group had a TEAE leading to 
discontinuation of study medication (dizziness, dysgeusia, aggression, agitation, ventricular 
extrasystoles, nausea, and dyspnea) versus 1 (3.2%) subject in the placebo + SOC group (dissociative 
disorder and panic attack). 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Reduction or Interruption 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies SUI3001/3002, 15.4% of subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and 
1.8% in the placebo + SOC group had a TEAE that led to a dose reduction or dose interruption during the 
double-blind phase. The most common TEAEs leading to dose reduction or dose interruption in the 
esketamine + SOC group were: dissociation (5.7%), nausea (4.8%), dizziness (3.1%), somnolence 
(2.6%), vomiting (2.2%), and blood pressure increased (1.3%). 
In the Phase 2 study SUI2001, 3 subjects in the esketamine + SOC group had a dose reduction due to 
TEAEs (dizziness [2 subjects], and anxiety, chest discomfort, feeling abnormal, and hyperacusis 
[1 subject]). 
Adverse events that lead to study drug discontinuation are in line with the known safety profile. AEs that 
lead to discontinuation are also comparable to AEs that lead to dose reductions. 
Post marketing experience 
Esketamine nasal spray was approved for marketing in the US under the tradename SPRAVATO on 5 
March 2019 for the treatment of TRD in adults and launched in the US on 14 March 2019. The first patient 
received esketamine nasal spray post-launch on 29 March 2019. Esketamine nasal spray has also 
received marketing authorizations in the EU and other markets but had not been launched in those 
regions as of the cutoff date for this this Clinical Overview. 
Since launch to 31 October 2019, the estimated cumulative exposure to SPRAVATO in the US was 
105,408 devices or 2,951,424 mg distributed by the Sponsor. The Sponsor performed a review of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 132/163 
 
 
 
Global Medical Sciences global safety database using MedDRA (version 22.0) for all cases of adverse 
events reported with the use of esketamine during postmarketing use for this period. These cases include 
both medically confirmed and non-medically confirmed events. 
In addition, as agreed with the Rapporteurs at the 25 October 2019 pre-submission meeting, the Sponsor 
has included two Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Reports (PADERs) for esketamine summarizing the 
safety data obtained from expedited solicited reports (reported as part of the US patient registry) and 
non-solicited post-marketing spontaneous reports. 
This review of post-marketing data for esketamine did not identify a new signal or safety concern, and as 
such, the postmarketing experience is consistent with the safety profile of esketamine established from 
the clinical studies and is reflected in the proposed product labelling. 
Post marketing data in patients with treatment resistant depression is in line with the known safety profile 
and also comparable to the safety profile in the clinical studies with patients with major depression with 
suicidal ideation. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
 The safety profile of esketamine in patients with major depression with suicidal ideation (MDSI) has been 
investigated in two Phase 3 studies and one supportive Phase 2 study. Additional safety data are provided 
from the clinical development program for patients with treatment resistant depression as well as 
post-marketing safety data in the same indication. 
262 subjects received at least 1 dose of esketamine and 256 received at least 1 dose of placebo across the 
combined Phase 2 and 3 studies in MDSI leading to a combined cumulative exposure to esketamine of 
15.8 patient-years (13.8 patient-years in the Phase 3 studies) and a combined cumulative exposure to 
placebo nasal spray of 15.7 patient-years (13.9 patient-years in the Phase 3 studies). 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies (SUI3001/3002), the mean (SD) duration of exposure to study medication 
was 22.2 (7.20) days in the esketamine + SOC group (227 subjects) and 22.5 (6.42) days in the placebo 
+ SOC group (225 subjects). All 227 subjects received at least one esketamine dose of 84 mg. 45 
subjects later received a reduced dose of 56 mg during the double-blind treatment phase. 35 dose 
reductions were due to tolerability reasons, 10 subjects had dose reductions due to an 
administration/device error. 
In the Phase 2 study (SUI2001), the mean (SD) duration of exposure to study medication during the 
double-blind phase was 20.7 (8.49) days in the esketamine + SOC group and 21.5 (7.22) days for the 
placebo + SOC group. All of the 35 subjects in the esketamine arm received the dose of 84 mg on Day 1; 
3 subjects had their dose reduced to 56 mg due to adverse events and 2 subjects had their dose reduced 
in error. 
The exact nature of these errors that lead to dose reductions in both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies is 
unclear and should be explained in more detail by the applicant (OC). This is especially concerning 
because the drug is not given out to patients and applied only under supervision by the study sites staff. 
Long term exposure data are available from the clinical studies in treatment resistant depression. In the 
long-term open-label extension study TRD3008 patients were treated up to 31 months with a median 
duration of exposure as of 31 December 2018 of 15.4 months. No long term treatment is intended in 
patients with suicidal ideation. 
Overall, esketamine nasal spray 84 mg was safe and tolerated in the Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies. The 
observed safety profile was consistent with established data in patients with TRD. No new or unexpected 
safety concerns were noted in the MDSI clinical program. Most AEs reported during esketamine

treatment, including those that were most common, were mild or moderate in severity, were observed 
postdose on the day of dosing, and resolved the same day. The AEs were primarily in the area of expected 
CNS effects and either related to the known safety profile of esketamine or the underlying disease. 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies there was a high rate of at least one adverse event during the double-blind 
treatment period in both the esketamine (89.9%) as well as the placebo arms (75.6%). The most 
common AEs esketamine vs. placebo were: dizziness (38.3% versus 13.8%), dissociation (33.9% versus 
5.8%), nausea (26.9% versus 13.8%), somnolence (20.7% versus 10.2%), dysgeusia (19.8% versus 
12.9%), vision blurred (11.9% versus 4.9%), paresthesia (11.5% versus 3.1%), vomiting (11.5% versus 
5.3%), blood pressure increased (11.5% versus 4.0%), sedation (10.1% versus 2.2%), and anxiety 
(10.1% versus 7.6%). Headache was observed in similar proportion of subjects in both groups (20.3% 
vs. 20.4%). In the follow-up phase frequency of observed AEs was similar between the treatment arms 
with 53.7% of the subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and 50.8% of those in the placebo + SOC 
group. The most common AEs reported more frequently for the esketamine arm were depression (6.8% 
versus 3.2%) and insomnia (6.3% versus 5.9%). AEs reported more frequently in the placebo arm were 
anxiety (9.7% versus 5.8%), suicidal ideation (6.5% versus 5.3%), and headache (9.2% versus 6.8%). 
Sedation and somnolence were commonly reported with esketamine treatment. Sedative effects were 
usually resolved on the same day as dosing. There was one subject that had an MOAA/S score of 0 and 1 
on  multiple  dosing  days,  corresponding  to  severe  sedation.  Though  the  subject  did  not  require  any 
medical intervention, such deep sedation was not previously seen in the TRD studies. Therefore, the case 
report and a discussion on the relationship between the event and esketamine dosing was requested. 
During the double-blind phase of the pooled Phase 3 studies, severe TEAEs were observed in 13.7% of 
subjects in the esketamine + SOC group and 5.8% in the placebo + SOC group. The most common severe 
AEs observed in the esketamine arm included dissociation (4.0% vs. 0%), nausea (2.2% vs. 0%), and 
increased blood pressure (1.8% vs. 0%). Severe AEs that were reported at low and similar rates for the 
esketamine and placebo arm were related to the underlying disease. The pattern of occurrence and 
resolution of severe adverse events was similar and consistent with the observations for all severity 
categories. Severe AEs that were reported on dosing days and did not resolve on the same day were 
depression (2 events) and suicide attempt (1 event) in the esketamine arm and depression (1 event), 
depression suicidal (1 event), suicide attempt (1 event), and erectile dysfunction (1 event) in the placebo 
arm. According to the applicant, the only serious events possibly related to esketamine treatment were a 
suicide attempt and one case of depersonalisation. No discussion of the relationship between esketamine 
and these events was provided by the applicant. This was requested. In the follow up phase, reporting of 
serious adverse events was higher compared to the double blind phase. As was observed in the double 
blind phase, most events are related to suicidality. 
Across all completed and ongoing studies with esketamine in the MDSI and TRD indications, 8 deaths 
have been reported up to 20 April 2019 including one suicide in the MDSI studies in a subject assigned to 
the esketamine arm. This suicide occurred in the follow-up phase three days after the last administration 
of study drug. Based upon the subjects’ MADRS and SIBAT scores, the subject appeared to be in 
remission. However, there is a possibility that subjects treated with esketamine engage more in suicidal 
behaviour and that esketamine treatment could have induced pharmacodynamic changes in the brain 
leading to an increase in suicidal behaviour. A discussion was warranted on the relationship between 
pharmacodynamic changes induced by (repeat) esketamine dosing and suicidality. The remaining seven 
deaths included three suicides in the TRD studies. The four non-suicide deaths were either due to cardiac 
or respiratory failure or due to traffic accidents. Although the sample size is small and none of the deaths 
were considered to be related to study drug by the investigators they all occurred in patients either on 
active treatment with or previously treated with esketamine.

EMA/141382/2021  
Page 134/163 
 
 
 
In the pooled safety data for the Phase 3 studies the overall frequency of adverse events during the 
double-blind treatment period potentially related to suicidality was comparable for esketamine (7.5%) 
and placebo (7.6  The frequency for self-injury was higher in the esketamine arm vs placebo [7(3.1%) vs 
3(1.3%)], this was however statistically non-significant. In the follow-up phase the overall frequency of 
events was also comparable between esketamine vs placebo (11.1% vs 10.3%). There were   7(3.7%) 
suicide attempts in the esketamine arm compared to 3 (1.6%) in the placebo group. When also pooled 
with the Phase 2 data the imbalance for self-injury remains the same (7 for esketamine vs 3 for placebo) 
while the number of suicide attempts in the follow-up phase becomes more balanced between treatment 
arms (7 for esketamine vs 6 for placebo). The numbers are too small to allow definite conclusions. 
Thus there appears to be a suggestion that subjects treated with esketamine might be more involved in 
self harm in either the form of self injury or a suicidal attempt compared to the placebo group. Currently 
it cannot be excluded whether the esketamine dose itself, or any of the esketamine-associated side 
effects such as dissociation would lead to increased suicidal behavior. To facilitate the interpretation of 
the relationship between esketamine and suicidality events, the applicant is requested to provide 
descriptive statistics on when the following suicidality related events occur and their temporal relationship 
with a study drug dosing day: suicide attempt, intentional self injury, intentional overdose, completed 
suicide (OC). Case reports for these events are also requested (OC). 
In addition, it also appears that young adults (aged 18 – 24 years) experience more suicidal behavior than 
the  older  adults.  It  is  unclear  whether  this  group  contributes  more  to  the  suicidality  related  adverse 
events  observed  across  the  MDSI  studies  than  the  adults.  The  applicant  is  requested  to  display  the 
suicidality related adverse events observed in the completed MDSI studies per age group (18 – 24 years, 
> 24 years) to allow for further interpretation (OC). In addition, a discussion was warranted why suicidal 
behavior occurred more frequently in the younger population compared to the adults. 
The sample size of deaths and events potentially related to suicidality is far too small to draw any reliable 
conclusions from these data. While there is no clear safety signal these data also do not point to any 
positive effect (besides the expected anti-depressive effects) for treatment of suicidality/suicidal ideation 
or prevention of suicides. For several oral anti-depressive drugs an increase in risk of suicide is actually 
known. Whether a similar effect could exist for esketamine remains currently unknown. While at least in 
theory the rapid onset of effect for esketamine should rather prevent suicidal behaviour this assumption 
is clearly not supported by the observed safety data and the observed imbalances would rather point in 
the opposite direction. In conclusion, possible effects of esketamine on suicidal ideation/suicidal 
behaviour, whether positive or negative, remain unclear at this time. 
Overall, the safety profiles of esketamine in treatment resistant depression and major depression with 
suicidal ideation (MDSI) appear comparable. No unexpected, new safety findings were made in the Phase 
2 and Phase 3 studies investigating patients with MDSI, but significant uncertainties exist regarding 
suicidal behaviour. 
Ten out of 45 patients who received a reduced dose in the Phase 3 studies and 2 of 5 in the Phase 2 did 
so  due  to  an  administration/device  error.  This  means  that  22%  of  all  dose  reductions  in  the  Phase  3 
studies as well as 40% of the dose reductions in the Phase 2 study were in error. This was somewhat 
puzzling, since the medication is not given out to patients but has to be administered under supervision 
at  the  study  sites.  The  applicant  was  asked  to  comment  on  this  and  provided  a  detailed  answer  and 
explained that most error were due to a defective device. The device has been redesigned for commercial 
use and device errors have become unlikely in clinical routine.

The applicant was requested to provide information on the occurrence/resolution of adverse events on 
dosing days for Study SUI2001this to allow for interpretation. This was provided. The occurrence and 
resolution of AEs in Study SUI2001 is consistent with those observed in the Phase III studies.

The only serious adverse events in the completed MDSI studies that were considered possible related to 
esketamine by the applicant were a suicide attempt and a case of depersonalization. The applicant was 
requested  to  provide  case  reports  of  these  events  and  discuss  the  relationship  between  esketamine 
dosing and the occurrence of these events. The Applicant provided the narratives as requested. The event 
of  attempted  suicide  occurred  approximately  one  hour  after  the  subject  received  the  final  dose  of 
esketamine during the double blind phase. The event was accompanied by severe anxiety, dissociative 
symptoms and suicidal ideas. The event was resolved on the same day, and subject was discharged 4 
hours after the event on his own accord. The anxiety attack secondary to dissociative symptoms was 
reported as the triggering factor for the event of suicide attempt according to the CIOMS report. 
The  causality  of  the  event  is  based  on  the  temporal  relationship  with  the  dosing  of  esketamine.  The 
subject did not have a documented history of prior suicide attempt- it appears that this was the subjects’ 
first attempt. The event is confounded by concurrent events of severe anxiety and dissociation which are 
known  side-effects  of  esketamine.  It  may  be  that  there  was  an  interplay  between  these  events  that 
triggered the suicide attempt, as was concluded by the CIOMS. It cannot be excluded that dissociation 
and  anxiety  played  a  role  in  the  subjects’  suicide  attempt.  However,  these  events  are covered  in  the 
postdose monitoring as described in the SmPC. The event of depersonalization/derealization occurred 40 
minutes after esketamine dosing on Day 21. The CADSS score at 40 minutes postdose was 6, followed by 
0 at 1.5 hours post dose. The Applicant’s assessment that the event is possible related to esketamine due 
to the temporal relationship and that depersonalization is a known side-effect of esketamine was agreed. 
The issue was considered as solved. 
 There was one completed suicide in SUI3001 that occurred 3 days after the last dose of esketamine. 
Based  upon  the  subjects’  MADRS  and  SIBAT  scores,  the  subject  appeared  to  be  in  remission.  The 
possibility that esketamine treatment could have induced pharmacodynamic changes in the brain leading 
to  an  increase  in  suicidal  behaviour  cannot  be  readily  excluded.  A  discussion  was  warranted  on  the 
relationship  between  pharmacodynamic  changes  induced  by  esketamine  dosing  and  suicidality.  The 
Applicant provided a detailed discussion. Although MADRS and SIBAT scores showed a remission in week 
2 the clinical narrative points towards an overall chronic disease pattern and also a possible relapse close 
to  the  completed  suicide.  Although  an  increased  risk  of  suicidal  behaviour  might  not  be  completely 
excluded at this time the overall data from the esketamine trials as well a clinical use provided no clear 
signal  for  a  PD  effect  that  might  increase  suicidal  behaviour.  Based  on  the  provided  discussion,  no 
conclusions  can  neither  be  drawn  regarding  the  relationship  between  esketamine  dosing  and 
pharmacodynamic changes in the brain related to suicidality.   
In pooled studies SUI3001/3002 there was one subject that had an MOAA/S score of 0 and 1 on multiple 
dosing days, corresponding to severe sedation, but did not require medical intervention. The applicant is 
requested to provide case report and discuss the relationship between the event and esketamine dosing. 
The Applicant provided the case report and the requested discussion. Subject had a MOAA/S score of 0 or 
1 during multiple dosing sessions. On some dosing days, the subject was too sedated to administer the 
final dose of study drug. During the time period that a MOAA/S score of 0 or 1 was reported the subject’s 
vital signs (including respiratory rate and oxygen saturation) remained normal. Though the subject was 
considered  severely  sedated,  this  was  not  reflected  in  their  vital  signs,  thus  not  requiring  medical 
intervention. A relationship between deep sedation and administration of study drug in subject appears 
likely. However, without meaningful changes in vital signs no intervention was required. Although this is 
a single case only it clearly provides justification for intake of the drug under supervision. 
Given the temporal relationship between the MOAA/S score and esketamine administration, it is agreed 
with  the  Applicant  that  this  is  due  to  the  pharmacological  effect  of  esketamine.  This  effect  is  already 
covered  in  the  information  on  the  post  dose  monitoring  in  the  SmPC  of  Spravato.  The  issue  was 
considered as solved.

There was a suggestion that suicidal behaviour occurs more frequently in esketamine treated subjects 
compared to placebo in pooled studies SUI3001/3002. To facilitate the interpretation of the relationship 
between esketamine and suicidality events, the applicant is requested to provide descriptive statistics on 
when  the  following  suicidality  related  events  occur  and  their  temporal  relationship  with  a  study  drug 
dosing day: suicide attempt, intentional self-injury, intentional overdose, completed suicide. Case reports 
for these events were also requested. The Applicant provided the requested analyses and five additional 
narratives that were not submitted preciously as they did not meet the criteria for narrative preparation.  
In  the  previous  round  it  was  noted  that  adverse  events  related  to  suicidal  behavior  (e.g.  intentional 
self-injury, suicide attempt and intentional overdose) occurred more frequent in the esketamine group 
compared to the placebo group. During the double blind phase of pooled studies SUI3001/3002 this was 
4.4% for the esketamine group and 3.1% for the placebo group. In the follow-up phase this was 5.3% for 
the esketamine group and 1.6% for the placebo group.  
According to the Applicant, this numerical difference was due to a higher percentage of subjects in the 
esketamine group reporting a prior history of suicide attempt in study 3002.  
In phase 2 study SUI2001 no events related to suicidal behaviour were reported during the double blind 
phase. In the follow-up phase one event was reported in the esketamine group (intentional self-injury) 
and 3 events in the placebo group (suicide attempt).  
In the double-blind phase of pooled studies SUI2001/3001/3002, the mean time from last study drug 
dose to first event was 2.5 days (range 1 - 5 days) in the esketamine group and 2.9 days (range 1 – 4 
days) in the placebo group. The median time was 3 days for both groups. Thus, there appears to be no 
difference between the placebo and esketamine groups with regard to time to event from last study dose.  
No conclusions can be drawn regarding the follow-up phase of the pooled studies, due to the low number 
of events in the placebo group. Taken together, no definitive conclusions can be drawn with regard to a 
possible  relationship  between  esketamine  dosing  and  suicidal  behaviour.  The  numbers  are  too  low  to 
conclude on a clear signal but the numerical difference at the expense of esketamine also does not allow 
a to conclude that there is no potential risk. 
As suicidality including suicidal behaviour is already covered in the SmPC of esketamine, this issue was 
not pursued further.  
Across  the  completed  MDSI  studies,  on  the  C-CASA  2012  Plus,  it  appears  suicidal  behaviour  as  most 
severe post-baseline category is reported with a higher frequency in the young adults (18 – 24 years) 
compared  to  the  adults.  It  is  unclear  whether  this  group  contributes  more  to  the  suicidality  related 
adverse events observed across the MDSI studies than the adults. The applicant was requested to display 
the suicidality related adverse events observed in the completed MDSI studies per age group (18 – 24 
years, > 24 years) to allow for further interpretation. In addition, a discussion was warranted why suicidal 
behaviour occurred more frequently in the younger population compared to the adults. 
 Results provided suggest there was a higher rate of AEs potentially related to suicidality in the younger 
age group (18 to 24 years) compared with  the older age group (>24 years), regardless of treatment 
assignment. Of note, the proportion of subjects in the 18 to 24-year-old age group that experienced one 
of these AEs was lower  in the esketamine + SOC group than in the placebo + SOC group during the 
double-blind phase and follow-up phase. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to 
the small number of subjects aged 18 to 24 years. 
The  risk  of  suicidal  behavior  in  young  adults  is  well  documented  in  the  literature.  Several 
population-based  surveys  show  a  higher  rate  of  suicidal  ideation,  suicide  attempts,  and  selfharming 
behaviors in the younger population when compared with older individuals.4,15,26,27,29,32,38 An increased 
risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors has also been reported for young patients (<25 years) treated with 
Assessment report

antidepressant  medications  compared  with  those  treated  with  placebo  in  clinical  studies.  This  was 
originally identified for children and adolescents37 and more recently in young adults (18-24 years),18 
resulting in the addition of warnings regarding suicidality in patients aged <25 years in the EU and US 
labels for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors 
(SNRIs). This was the reason why the Applicant originally performed the C-CASA analysis in the subgroup 
of subjects aged 18- to 24-years old. 
In summary, consistent with the literature, the observation of a higher rate of AEs potentially related to 
suicidality  in  the  younger  subgroup  (18-24  years)  compared  with  the  older  subgroup  (>24  years)  in 
studies SUI3001 and SUI3002, regardless of treatment assignment, was not unexpected. In view of this 
finding,  the  Applicant  believes  it  is  appropriate  to  add  a  general  warning  about  the  increased  risk  of 
suicidality in patients aged <25 years in the EUPI, consistent with the warning that is included for SSRIs 
and  SNRIs.  This  is  considered  particularly  important  as  treatment  with  Spravato  will  always  be  in 
conjunction  with  an  oral  antidepressant  medication  for  which  such  a  warning  would  be  appropriate 
anyway.  The wording proposed for the SmPC (section 4.4) reads as follows: 
“A  meta-analysis  of  placebo-controlled  clinical  studies  of  oral  antidepressants  in  adult  patients  with 
psychiatric disorders showed an increased risk of suicidal behaviour with antidepressants compared to 
placebo, in patients less than 25 years old”. 
The Applicant has provided an overview over suicidality in the age range from 18 to 24 years. Based on 
the provided data a higher rate of AEs related to suicidality is apparent, especially in the esketamine plus 
placebo group. These results might be simply a characteristic of this specific demographic group and 
could also be confounded by known risks associated with oral antidepressants in children and young 
adults. The interpretation of the data a further complicated by the overall small sample size. 
The CHMP did not agree with including information on oral antidepressants in the SmPC of Spravato. In 
addition,there is no clearly identified safety signal for esketamine in young adults and an increased risk 
when using concomitant oral antidepressants would also be covered by the respective SmPCs. Pointing to 
potential  risk  of  concomitant  medication  might  also  lead  to  an  underreporting  of  those  events  after 
marketing authorization by deemphasizing a possible relation to esketamine itself.  
In  the  C-CASA  2012  Plus  analysis  on  most  severe  post-baseline  category,  no  cases  of  self  injurious 
behaviour was reported. However, adverse events of intentional self-injury were reported in the studies. 
It is unclear where intentional self-injury fits into the C-CASA 2012 plus categories, or  whether these 
events were not reported as the most severe post-baseline category. The applicant provided satisfactorily 
clarification. 
Interactions with benzodiazepines should be further addressed by the Applicant as they are often used in 
acute  mental  health  disorders,  including  patients  with  suicidal  ideation/behaviour/thoughts.  The 
additional analysis identified no additional risk that are not already covered in the SmPC.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The CHMP reviewed all available data and concluded that clinical safety was demonstrated. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
Based on the different indication, dosing, route of administration, administration setting and target 
patient population as highlighted by the new ATC code as an antidepressant instead of general 
anaesthetics, the PRAC was of the opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for Spravato was needed, 
as it cannot follow the already existing entry for esketamine. The requirements for submission of periodic 
safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP 
Assessment report

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
The group of variations requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
Labelling, Package Leaflet and Annex IV. 
As a consequence of this new indication and this group of variations, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 
6.5 of the SmPC have been updated.    
 B.II.e.5.a.2: Addition of a new pack size (multipack) of 24 nasal spray devices (multipack of 8 packs of 
3 nasal spray devices) corresponding to 4 weeks of treatment in the new indication. 
The Package Leaflet and labelling are updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to clarify the wording in Annex II.D.  
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage conditions, Braille, etc…], 
which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representatives of Hungary. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
 Full user testing in compliance with the above-mentioned legislative requirements was recently 
performed (n= 20 participants) on the package leaflet developed for Spravato for the initial Marketing 
Authorisation Application, which received a positive opinion on 17 October 2019 by the Committee for 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 145/163 
 
 
 
 
Medicinal Products for Human Use and a European Commission decision on 18 December 2019. The 
results confirmed that the Package Leaflet for Spravato complies with current EU requirements for User 
Testing. 
With reference to the two examples included in the ‘Guidance concerning consultations with target patient 
groups for the package leaflet’ (May 2006) and the ‘Guideline on the readability of the labelling and 
package leaflet of medicinal products for human use’ (revision 1, 12 January 2009) for circumstances in 
which reference can be made to an already approved package leaflet (Same safety issues identified and 
Same class of medicinal product), the applicant considers the following points to be relevant: 
- 
The same formulation for use in the treatment of TRD will be used in the new target indication and 
the abilities of patients with MDSI are similar to those diagnosed with TRD with respect to their 
ability to find and understand instructions communicated in the package leaflet. The user groups 
(patients and the health care professional directly supervising them) are broadly similar to those 
for the TRD indication. 
- 
The updated package leaflet (Annex IIIB) submitted within the EUPI to support this Type II 
variation to extend the indication (Mod1.3.1) introduces minimal changes and will use the same 
leaflet format with previously approved leaflet. 
o  No new warnings in the package leaflet 
o  The new terms determined to be side effects for esketamine following the MDSI adverse 
drug reaction assessment are similar to those previously identified in the TRD data. 
Based on the rationale described above, the applicant does not propose to conduct any user testing (or 
bridging) to support the new indication application, which is acceptable for CHMP. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Spravato (esketamine) is included in the 
additional monitoring list since it has measures for ensuring the safe use of the medicinal product 
included in the risk management system and it has conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and 
effective use of the medicinal product. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and a major contributor to the overall global 
burden of disease. Major Depressive Disorder is a serious, disabling psychiatric illness that can have a 
devastating impact on the lives of patients. Moreover, MDD is the psychiatric condition most commonly 
associated with suicide. Suicide-related morbidity and mortality in patients with MDD are a major public 
health concern. The reported prevalence of suicidal ideation in adult patients with MDD is as high as 60% 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 146/163 
 
 
 
and the lifetime prevalence of attempted suicide in this population ranges between 10% and 20%. 
Further, the lifetime risk of completed suicide is estimated to be 3.4% in this population. 
Many risk factors for committing a suicide have been identified in these patients, for example prior history 
of suicide attempt, more severe depression, hopelessness and comorbidity.  It has been estimated that 
patients  with  depression  are  at  approximately  20  times  greater  risk  for  suicide  than  the  general 
population. Alterations in the glutamate signalling may have a role in depression pathogenesis. It has also 
been suggested that there are differences in the glutamate system between patients with MDD with or 
without suicidal ideation. 
It has been estimated that nearly 45,000 people in the United States (CDC, 2018) and more than 800,000 
worldwide die by suicide each year (GBD 2015). 
Worldwide, the crude suicide mortality rates dropped between 2000 and 2016, by 16% in men and 20% 
in women. In 2016, nearly 800 000 deaths were due to suicide, equivalent to an annual global crude 
suicide mortality rate of 10.6 per 100 000 population or one person every 40 seconds. 
Screening for suicide has not been shown to reduce mortality and the reported cases may not reflect the 
true problem due to misclassification of deaths.  
The evaluation of a patient who may be suicidal includes an assessment of ideation, method, plan, and 
intent. Unfortunately, the ability to predict who will attempt suicide is limited; patients who die by suicide 
are similar to those who do not (Pirkis et al. 2002). As an example, one study of 4800 psychiatric 
inpatients who were evaluated using the risk factors found that trying to identify particular people who 
would or would not die by suicide was not feasible because of the low sensitivity and specificity of 
available identification procedures (Pokorny 1983). Similarly, among patients who have presented to an 
emergency department after an episode of self-harm, assessments by psychiatrists and emergency 
department staff have low sensitivity and specificity for predicting who will repeat self-harm (Kapur et al. 
2005). 
A number of standardized scales have been proposed to evaluate suicide risk, but none is associated with 
a high predictive value. Scales such as the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale, Columbia 
Classification Algorithm for Suicide Assessment and InterSePT Scale for Suicidal Thinking are primarily 
used to evaluate safety, and not efficacy, in suicidality. Depression rating scales are commonly used, but 
these are measures of the severity of depression and not specifically of suicide risk (Runeson et al 2017). 
In addition, more general health related outcomes are used. As an example, a study evaluated responses 
to item number nine from the Patient Health Questionnaire – Nine Item (PHQ-9)  (“Over the last two 
weeks, how often have you been bothered by thoughts you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself 
in some way?”), and found that the cumulative risk of suicide over one year among outpatients who 
answered “nearly every day” was 4 percent (Simon et al, 2013). In cardiac inpatients with current 
emotional distress (n = 366), a positive response to item nine was endorsed by 21 percent, but a detailed 
suicide evaluation found that suicidal plans or intent were present in only 3 percent Suarez et al., 2015). 
Other studies also suggest that item nine is an insufficient assessment tool (Na et al., 2018). 
Another option for identifying patients at high risk of suicide is the Beck Hopelessness Scale, which is a 
20-item true/false questionnaire that correlates more closely with current suicide attempt than the 
severity of the depression. However, a meta-analysis found that the low specificity of the scale limits its 
applicability (McMillan et al., 2007; Uptodate.com Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults, accessed 
March 2020).

The patients in the phase 3 studies with Spravato were identified by answering in MINI that they think 
about harming or hurting or injuring themselves and that they intend to act on thoughts of killing 
themselves. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Patients with MDD who have a current suicidal ideation reflect an acutely ill population that requires 
immediate intervention. Management of the suicidal individual should include: 
• 
Hospitalisation 
•  Medical stabilization 
• 
Reducing immediate risk and treatment planning 
•  Managing underlying factors and psychiatric disorders 
•  Monitoring and follow-up 
There may be differences between countries in the approach to reducing the immediate risk which may 
concern inpatient hospitalization, partial hospitalization or an outpatient program.  
However, there are no approved pharmacological treatments for the rapid reduction of the symptoms of 
depression and suicidality in this patient population. Furthermore, only limited information is available to 
guide clinical decisions, since this population has typically been excluded from antidepressant drug trials 
in the past. Standard antidepressants may take several weeks to exert their full effect, limiting their utility 
in crisis situations. Additionally, hospitalizations are temporary and not completely effective, and the risks 
for attempted and completed suicide remain high in the weeks immediately after discharge.  
Some studies in the literature suggest that patients with MDD who have suicidal ideation show a worse 
response  to  antidepressant  treatment  than  MDD  patients  without  suicidal  ideation.  In  one  study 
evaluating  the  response  to  a  new  antidepressant  after  6  weeks  of  treatment  in  4,041 depressed 
outpatients, suicidal patients were less likely to improve or attain remission than non-suicidal patients. In 
the  multivariate  analyses,  active  suicidal  ideation  (odds  ratio]  =  1.40;  95%  confidence  interval  [CI]: 
1.18-1.65)  and  a  history  of  suicide  attempt  (odds  ratio  =  1.39;  95%  CI:  1.16-1.66)  were  the  best 
predictors of non-remission, independent of the class of antidepressant treatment (Lopez-Castroman et 
al 2016).  
Patients  with  MDD  who  have  active  suicidal  ideation/thoughts  and/or  behavior  reflect  a  severely  ill 
population that requires immediate intervention. Current approach for treating these patients is mainly 
initiation or optimisation with antidepressants and frequently hospitalisation. However, antidepressants 
have been associated with suicide risk. 
There is a clear unmet medical need for the treatment of patients who suffer from suicidal ideation and/or 
behaviour. There are options such as structured and protective environment for the management of the 
suicidality of these patients. If the patients can be identified most important rapid management would still 
be hospitalization and oral antidepressants. Clear benefit would have been if outpatient pharmacological 
treatment became possible.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Two phase 3 studies were conducted. The design of these pivotal  studies was identical: double-blind, 
randomized,  placebo-controlled,  multi-center,  international  studies  in  adults  with  MDD,  who  have 
responded that they think about harming or of hurting or of injuring themselves and who intend to act on 
thoughts of killing themselves (question B3 and B10 of MINI). 
Sample size calculation was appropriate based on an effect size for the MADRS total score and a number 
of 451 patients in total (with 226 patients receiving Esketamine + SOC and 225 on placebo + SOC) can 
be  considered  sufficient.  Randomisation  was  also  implemented.  Blinding  was  maintained  by  adding  a 
bittering agent to the placebo nasal spray (as in the studies for TRD) and by using different raters to 
perform efficacy and safety assessments. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  considered  appropriate  to  investigate  the  depressive  symptoms  (MADRS). 
With respect to the suicidality issue (key secondary endpoint CGI-SS-R and other indices such as MADRS 
Suicidal  thoughts,  CGI-SR-I,  CGI-FoST,  Patient  reported  FoST) 
it 
is  unclear  whether  the 
scales/instruments used were appropriate. The statistical methods are generally considered acceptable. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A rapid reduction of depressive symptoms was observed in the study population. In study SUI3001, the 
mean change in MADRS total score (SD) from baseline to 24 hours was -12.8 (10.73) for the SOC + 
placebo group and -16.4 (11.95) for the SOC + esketamine group. In study SUI3002, the mean change 
in MADRS total score (SD) from baseline to 24 hours was -12.4 (10.43) for the SOC + placebo group and 
-15.7 (11.56) for the SOC + esketamine group. For the primary endpoint a LS mean treatment difference 
in the change of MADRS total score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose (Day 2) was observed 
in both studies [SUI3001: -3.8 (-6.56; -1.09) (SE=1.39); p=0.006 and SUI3002: -3.9 (-6.60; -1.11) 
(SE=1.39); p=0.006]. For the pooled studies, the LS mean treatment difference (95% CI) at 24 hours 
after the first dose was -3.8 (-5.75; -1.89). 
A larger proportion of patients in the esketamine group (compared to placebo)  achieved remission of 
depressive symptoms (MADRS total score ≤12). In study SUI3001, remission rate at 24 hours was 8.9% 
in the SOC + placebo group and 18.8% in the SOC + esketamine group. Response rate at 24 hours was 
26.8%  in  the  SOC  +  placebo  group  and  33.9%  in  the  SOC  +  esketamine  group.  In  study  SUI3002, 
remission rate at 24 hours was 10.6% in the SOC + placebo group and 21.9% in the SOC + esketamine 
group.  Response  rate  at  24  hours  was  23.9%  in  the  SOC  +  placebo  group  and  35.1%  in  the  SOC  + 
esketamine  group.  At  the  double-blind  endpoint  Day  25  (4  hours  postdose),  50%  of  subjects  in  the 
esketamine  +  SOC  group  and  37%  in  placebo  +  SOC  group  had  a  MADRS  total  score  ≤12.  The 
corresponding treatment difference (95% CI) was 13.1% (4.03; 22.19).  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Suicides can occur impulsively and the time period between onset of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt 
can be very short from minutes to a few hours. In addition, it is very difficult to predict which patients will 
proceed to committing suicide or not. Specific and sensitive instruments have not been identified yet. It 
has  also  been  reported  that  no  diagnostic  tool  has  demonstrated  clinical  value  for  the assessment of 
short-term suicide risk among  high-risk individuals  (Hawes  et  al  2017).  The  necessity  for  reliable 
diagnostic tools for the short-term suicide risk assessment has been recognised (Calati et al 2020). 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 149/163 
 
 
 
Several scales have been proposed to evaluate suicide risk, but without a high predictive value. Scales 
such as the Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), Columbia Classification Algorithm for 
Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) and InterSePT Scale for Suicidal Thinking are primarily used to evaluate 
safety, and not efficacy, in suicidality. Depression scales are a measure of severity of depression and not 
necessarily  of  the  suicide  risk.  In  addition,  a  high  degree  of  complexity  is  associated  with  suicidal 
behaviours.  
Taking all the above into consideration, it is questionable whether a population of “adult patients with a 
moderate to severe episode of MDD who have current suicidal ideation with intent” can truly be identified 
in clinical practice.   
A notably high percentage of 37% of patients on placebo achieved remission of depressive symptoms 
(MADRS total score ≤12). This may be explained by the fact that these patients received optimal SOC. 
However,  the  beneficial  effects  on  esketamine  versus  placebo  in  reducing  depressive  symptoms,  as 
measured  by  MADRS,  did  not  translate  into  more  pronounced  reduction  of  suicidal  ideation  and/or 
behaviour.  
The key secondary endpoint, change in CGI-SS-R score from baseline to 24 hours after the first dose (Day 
2) failed to show a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups and also failed to show 
a convincing trend in favour of Esketamine + SOC [LS means in -0.3 in study SUI3001; -0.1 in study 
SUI3002  and  -0.2  for  the  pooled  studies].  The  treatment  groups  did  not  separate  at  any  time-point 
throughout the studies, neither in CGI-SS-R or the investigator assessed risk of suicide (GCI-SR-I). In 
study SUI3001, the median change from baseline to 24 hours in severity of suicidal ideation as measured 
by  the  Clinical  Global  Impression  –  Severity  of  Suicidality  (CGI-SS-R)  was  -1.0  (-5;  1)  in  the  SOC  + 
placebo group and -1.0 (-6; 2) in the SOC + esketamine group. The Hodges-Lehmann estimate of the 
treatment difference (95% CI) was 0.0 (-1.00; 0.00). (2-sided p=0.107). In study SUI3002, the median 
change from baseline to 24 hours in severity of suicidal ideation as measured by the CGI-SS-R was -1.0 
(-6; 2) in the SOC + esketamine group and -1.0 (-5; 2) in the SOC + placebo. The Hodges-Lehmann 
estimate of the treatment difference (95% CI) was 0.0 (0.00; 0.00) (2-sided p=0.379). The CGI-SS-R is 
part 
of 
the 
SIBAT,  which  was 
subject 
to 
a 
qualification 
advice 
procedure 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/705316/2018,  Procedure  No.:  EMEA/H/SAB/051/1/FU/1/2018).  It  was  stated  that 
the final utility of the scale will only be determined once the phase 3 data is available. The small numerical 
difference favouring Esketamine + SOC cannot be considered as evidence of an effect of esketamine in 
reducing suicidal ideation or suicide risk and it does not demonstrate the clinical relevance of CGI-SS-R. 
It is unclear whether the studies failing to show an effect is due to esketamine having no relevant effect 
on  suicidal  behavior,  or  whether  it  can  be  attributed  to  the  beneficial  effects  of  hospitalization  with 
extensive clinical care during the double-blind treatment phase, which may make it difficult to show an 
additional effect compared to placebo. Therefore, the observed result on CGI-SS-R could be either failure 
of the treatment or failure of the assessment scale, which is currently not validated. 
Another secondary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving resolution of suicidality based on 
CGI-SS-R score at different time points. However, the CGI-SS-R scale, which is part of the SIBAT tool, is 
currently not validated. In the overall clinical trial population, the between group differences were 13.2%, 
1.6% and 7.3% at Days 1, 2 and 25, respectively. In the subpopulation with severe depression (baseline 
MADRS ≥35), the between group differences were similar, i.e. 16.2%, 4.6% and 5.6% at Days 1, 2 and 
25, respectively. Overall, these differences were small but most visible on Day 1, in line with the early 
onset of antidepressant effect of esketamine. 
For the key secondary endpoint, several different analyses were also pre-defined to describe the size of 
the treatment effect. It is not clear whether the calculation of LS means using ANCOVA based on the 
actual values is valid as CGI-SS-R is an ordinal scale. The item response analysis resulting in an odds ratio 
for achieving a lower score is an interesting explorative analysis but also difficult to interpret. Firstly, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 150/163 
 
 
 
application  of  the  Bayesian  framework  is  not  standard  in  the  regulatory  context.  Secondly,  the 
interpretation  of  odds  ratios  in  terms  of  clinical  relevance  is  generally  difficult  and  not  intuitive, 
particularly for ordinal scales.  
All  of  the  suicide  indices  including  MADRS  suicidal  thoughts,  CGI-SS-R  scores,  CGI-SR-I  scores, 
clinician-rated FoST, and patient-reported FoST showed improvement from baseline to the end of the 
double-blind  treatment  phase  for  both  treatment  groups.  There  were  only  small  differences  observed 
between  placebo  +  SOC  and  Esketamine  +  SOC  [MADRS  suicidal  thoughts  -0.20;  CGI-SS-R  -0.18; 
CGI-SR-I -0.16; CGI-FoST -0.09 and Patient reported FoST -0.05].  
Hospitalization was recommend to be continued for at least 5 days, however this could have been longer 
or shorter based on clinical judgement. It is unclear whether there is differential effect on duration of 
hospitalization. 
In study SUI3002, local SOC and regional requirements led to the increase in some EU countries to 14 
days of hospitalization. This together with other factors such as higher proportion of randomized subjects 
who  received  an  antidepressant  +  augmentation  therapy,  longer  mean  duration  of  illness,  higher 
proportion  of  patients  who  had  a  recent  suicide  attempt  and  higher  number  of  discontinuations  in 
SUI3002 compared to SUI3001 led to some differences in effects between the studies. The results for the 
placebo + SOC group in the study SUI3002 appeared to be somewhat better than in study SUI3001 and 
the between-group difference favouring esketamine + SOC smaller. However, the results of the primary 
and important key secondary efficacy variables were similar for the two  studies and do not raise any 
concerns. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  clinical  development  program  for  esketamine  in  MDSI  provided  safety  data  for  262  subjects  who 
received at least 1 dose of esketamine + SOC in the Phase 2 and 3 studies, representing a combined 
cumulative exposure to esketamine of 15.8 patient-years. The safety and tolerability of esketamine is 
further supported by data collected during the extensive clinical development program in patients with 
TRD, including 1,708 subjects who received esketamine in the completed Phase 2 and 3 TRD studies (611 
patient-years exposure), and 1,140 subjects who went on to receive esketamine in the ongoing long-term 
OL extension safety study TRD3008 (1,198 patient-years exposure). As of 31 December 2018, across 
completed and ongoing Phase 3 TRD studies, 1,739 subjects had received at least one dose of esketamine 
56 mg (611 patient-years of exposure) and 1,279 subjects had received at least one dose of esketamine 
84 mg (1,151 patient-years of exposure). Key safety observations are summarized below. 
• 
In the completed Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies, 1 death was reported in 262 subjects who had been 
assigned to esketamine + SOC treatment in the double-blind treatment phase (15.8 patient-years of 
exposure) and 0 deaths were observed in 256 subjects who had been assigned to placebo + SOC 
(15.7 patient-years of exposure). No deaths were observed during the double-blind treatment phase 
of the SUI2001, SUI3001, or SUI3002 studies.in the controlled Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies.  Across 
all completed and ongoing studies of esketamine in MDSI and TRD indications, 8 deaths have been 
reported in subjects who had received treatment with esketamine. Four deaths were reported in the 
completed Phase 2 and 3 TRD studies in 1,708 subjects who had been assigned to esketamine + oral 
antidepressant treatment, and no deaths in 486 subjects who received oral antidepressant + placebo. 
In  the  ongoing  long-term  OL  extension  study  TRD3008,  3  deaths  were  reported  in  1,140 
esketamine-treated  subjects  through  31  December  2018.  In  each  of  the  8  cases,  the  AEs  were 
considered by the investigator as not related or doubtfully related to esketamine nasal spray. Of the 
8 deaths reported in subjects who received esketamine during the MDSI and TRD clinical studies, 4 
were completed suicides. This corresponds to an incidence of 0.22 completed suicides per 100 patient 
Assessment report

years of exposure, which is comparable to the rate reported in a meta-analysis of studies in MDD 
patients  treated  with  oral  antidepressants  (0.22  per  100  patient  years)  (Braun  et  al.  Psychother. 
Psychosom.  2016;85)  and  lower  than  the  rate  reported  in  another  meta-analysis  in  TRD  patients 
receiving various treatments (0.47 per 100 patient years) (Bergfeld et al. J Affect Disord. 2018;235). 
•  Overall, esketamine nasal spray 84 mg was safe and tolerated in the Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies 
when used in conjunction with comprehensive SOC. The adverse events reported in these studies 
were  generally  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  of  esketamine  observed  in  previous  studies  in 
subjects with TRD. There were no new or unexpected safety concerns noted with the administration 
of esketamine in the completed MDSI clinical studies, or in the ongoing studies in subjects with TRD 
or MDSI. 
•  As observed in the TRD clinical program, most TEAEs reported during esketamine treatment in the 
Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies, including the most common anticipated TEAEs, were mild or moderate 
in severity, were observed postdose on the day of dosing, and resolved the same day. 
• 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies (SUI3001/3002), the following common TEAEs (reported in at least 
10%  of  subjects)  were  observed  more  frequently  in  subjects  treated  with  esketamine  +  SOC 
compared  with  those  receiving  placebo  +  SOC:  dizziness,  dissociation,  nausea,  somnolence, 
dysgeusia, vision blurred, paresthesia, vomiting, blood pressure increased, sedation, and anxiety. A 
similar pattern of TEAE reporting was observed for the Phase 2 study (SUI2001). 
•  Based on an analysis of ADRs across TRD and MDSI clinical programs, esketamine was shown to have 
a consistent risk profile in both populations and the ADRs determined were not considered indication 
specific. 
• 
In the pooled Phase 3 studies SUI3001/3002, SAEs were reported during the double-blind phase in 
esketamine-treated  subjects  at  rates  that  were  low  and  generally  similar  to  those  in  subjects 
receiving placebo + SOC (9 [4.0%] vs. 12 [5.3%] subjects, respectively). In the Phase 2 SUI2001 
study, SAEs were reported during the double-blind phase in 4 (11.4%) vs. 0 subjects, respectively. 
The most frequently reported SAEs were in the psychiatric disorders category and were associated 
with the underlying disease state. 
• 
The  rates  of  discontinuation  of  treatment  due  to  TEAEs  were  reported  at  higher  rates  in  the 
esketamine + SOC group compared with the placebo + SOC group in the pooled Phase 3 studies (14 
[6.2%] vs 8 [3.6%] subjects, respectively) and Phase 2 study SUI2001 (5 [14.3%] vs. 1 [3.2%], 
respectively). Main reasons for discontinuations were nervous system disorders such as dissociation, 
depersonalisation/derealisation, hallucination, sedation/somnolence and others. 
•  Dissociative/perceptual changes (based on the CADSS) and sedative effects (based on MOAA/S) were 
observed at higher rates in the esketamine + SOC group than the placebo + SOC group in the Phase 
2  and  3  MDSI  studies.  These  events  had  an  onset  shortly  after  dosing,  peaked  by  40  minutes 
postdose, and typically resolved within 1.5 hours. The TEAEs associated with these symptoms were 
primarily mild or moderate in severity, occurred on the day of dosing, and resolved the same day. 
•  No  cases  of  respiratory  depression  or  TEAEs  that  required  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  or  other 
medical intervention were observed. 
• 
The Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies enrolled subjects with MDD who had active suicidal ideation with 
intent, and a large proportion of these subjects (~60%) had a history of prior suicide attempt. It is 
important to note that these studies were designed to evaluate the efficacy of esketamine in reducing 
the  severity  of  suicidality  and  were  not  designed  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  esketamine  in 
preventing  suicide.  Overall,  the  rates  of  AEs  potentially  related  to  suicidality  (including  suicide 
attempts and 1 completed suicide) in the Phase 2 and 3 studies were similar between the esketamine 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 152/163 
 
 
 
+ SOC and placebo + SOC treatment groups during the double-blind and follow-up phases. Given the 
high-risk status of the population enrolled in these studies, the observed rate of suicidality-related 
events  during  the  Phase  2  and  3  MDSI  studies  was  not  unexpected.  The  Sponsor  has  included  a 
warning  in  the  proposed  label  to  highlight  that  esketamine  has  not  been  studied  or  proven  to  be 
effective  in  preventing  suicide,  and  that  the  use  of  esketamine  does  not  preclude  the  need  for 
hospitalization, if clinically warranted. This is included with the class warning statement regarding 
suicide/suicidal thoughts or clinical worsening in Section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC. 
• 
Transient increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed following administration of 
esketamine nasal spray in the Phase 2 and 3 MDSI clinical studies, with maximum elevations typically 
observed around 40 minutes after dosing and values returning to, or close to, pretreatment levels by 
1.5 hours postdose. The blood pressure elevations generally did not require intervention and were not 
associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Few subjects discontinued esketamine treatment due to 
increased blood pressure. 
• 
There were no new data obtained from the Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies or other ongoing studies that 
would  warrant  changes  to  the  existing  sections 
in  the  esketamine  SmPC  related  to 
pregnancy/lactation,  overdose,  abuse  potential,  withdrawal  and  rebound,  effects  on  the  ability  to 
drive or operate machinery, or cognitive and memory impairment. 
In conclusion, the safety profile of esketamine in patients with MDSI was consistent with that observed in 
the TRD program, and no new safety signals were observed. Taken together, the safety data from the 
completed Phase 2 and 3 MDSI clinical studies and the TRD program  support the conclusion that the 
overall safety profile of esketamine nasal spray, despite uncertainties, has not changed when it is used in 
conjunction  with  oral  antidepressant  therapy  for  the  rapid  reduction  of  depressive  symptoms  in  a 
subgroup of adult patients with MDD. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The  patient  population  investigated  in  the  pivotal  Phase  3  studies  is  defined  as  adults  with  Major 
Depressive Disorder (MDD) assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Patients were identified by the 
answer “yes” to the questions B3 and B10 of the MINI. In clinical routine suicidal ideation is a symptom 
common in patients with depression but not a separate diagnostic criterion. Biologically, patients with 
major depressive disorder either with or without suicidal ideation would not be distinguishable. 
All patients with major depressive disorder have an increased risk for suicides and suicide attempts. Oral 
anti-depressive drugs can be associated with initially increased risk for suicides. This risk can vary with 
factors like disease stage or age of the patients and are usually identified through post-marketing data 
and meta analyses. In major depressive disorder so far no anti-depressive drug has been identified that 
is proven to actually effectively reduce the number of suicides and suicide attempts. 
Four  suicides  have  so  far  occurred  in  all  studies  of  esketamine  in  patients  with  treatment  resistant 
depression  (TRD)  or  major  depressive  disorder  with  suicidal  ideation  (MDSI).  Two  of  these  suicides 
occurred in the follow-up phase of patients previously on esketamine during the placebo-controlled phase 
of the MDSI and TRD studies, three days and 20 days respectively, after last intake of study drug. The 
other two occurred during the uncontrolled active induction/maintenance phases within the TRD studies. 
No suicides occurred in patients that were either on treatment with placebo or in follow-up after placebo 
treatment. 
Due to the small sample size these data are difficult to interpret. Taken together with the lack of efficacy 
on suicidality scores, they show however that there is remaining uncertainty how esketamine use might 
actually affect suicidality in patients with depression. 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021

In the TRD studies discussed in the original MAA, suicidality did not appear to be increased during the 
initial weeks of treatment. Events were reported in the esketamine groups with an incidence of around < 
4% for the induction and maintenance phases of the studies. In the MDSI studies an incidence of 7.5% is 
reported in the esketamine group during initial treatment (double blind). 
Because  of  a  numerical  imbalance  that  suggested  that  esketamine  treated  subjects  engage  more  in 
suicidal  behaviour,  the  temporal  relation  of  the  suicidality  related  AEs  suicide  attempt,  intentional 
self-injury, intentional overdose, and completed suicide to esketamine dosing was analysed. Based on the 
pooled Phase 3 studies (SUI3001/3002), the proportion of subjects reporting one of the selected potential 
suicidality-related events for esketamine vs. placebo was 4.4% vs. 3.1% during the double-blind phase, 
but 5.3% vs. 1.6% during the follow-up phase. This numerical difference was largely due to a higher rate 
of suicide attempt in the esketamine + SOC group vs. placebo group during the follow-up phase (3.7% vs. 
1.6%). 
A history of one or more prior suicide attempts was reported for approximately 60% of the 518 MDD 
subjects with current suicidal ideation and intent in the Phase 2 and 3 MDSI studies. Study SUI3002 had 
a higher percentage of subjects in the esketamine group that reported a suicide attempt within the last 
month before study entry compared the placebo group (31.6% versus 21.2%). A history of prior suicide, 
and  in  particular  recent  prior  attempt,  is  one  of  the  most  important  predictors  for  future  suicidal 
behaviour. Therefore, this imbalance may have contributed to the observed differences in the number of 
suicide attempts during the follow-up phase. In the Phase 2 study SUI2001, more suicide attempts were 
reported in the placebo group than in the esketamine group (3 subjects versus none) during the follow-up 
phase. There was an imbalance at baseline in the proportion of subjects with recent suicide attempts with 
41.9% vs. 30.3% for the placebo versus esketamine group. In the pooled data of the Phase 2 and Phase 
3  studies  the  rate  of  suicide  attempt  during  the  follow-up  phase  was  3.2%  vs.  2.9%  for  esketamine 
versus placebo. 
Analysis of the time since the last study drug dose to the onset of the first selected AE potentially related 
to suicidality showed these events were dispersed over the follow-up phase, without an apparent pattern 
suggestive of rebound. In the pooled Phase 3 studies, the median time from the last dose of study drug 
to the first AE in the follow-up phase was longer in the esketamine + SOC group than the placebo + SOC 
group (30 vs. 7 days). Similar results were observed for the pooled Phase 2 and 3 studies (24 vs. 8.5 
days). 
The only completed suicide occurred 3 days after the last dose of esketamine in a subject that appeared 
to be in remission. However, the clinical narrative supports the investigator’s assessment, that the event 
was not related to study drug. The subject showed a clear pattern of a chronic disease and a possible 
major relapse close to the suicide was indicated (after the subject had completed the study). 
There was also a higher rate of AEs potentially related to suicidality in the younger age group (18 to 24 
years) compared with the older age group (>24 years), regardless of treatment assignment. Within the 
age range of 18 to 24 years the incidence of these events was however higher in the placebo group than 
in the esketamine group. Also, only 79 subjects within this age range were included in the pooled Phase 
3 studies, therefore the sample size is small and has to be interpreted with caution. Generally, the finding 
of  higher  incidence  of  AEs  potentially  related  to  suicidality  in  the  younger  subgroup  (18-24  years) 
compared with the older subgroup (>24 years) is consistent with the scientific literature. It might also be 
further confounded by concomitant intake of oral anti-depressive drugs, which are known to increase 
suicidal behavior especially in children and young adults. 
Overall,  while  a  slight  numerical  imbalance  exists  for  suicide  related  events  towards  the  esketamine 
group, these data are very limited. The observation might also be explained by slight differences in the

composition of the patient groups within the treatment arms. Therefore, no specific safety signal can be 
identified at this time for patients with MDD and suicidal ideation or behaviour.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The population of depressed patients who have suicidal behavior and/or ideation/thoughts is a vulnerable 
subgroup  of  MDD  patients.  However,  there  are  difficulties  in  identifying  this  population  in  the  clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021

practice, perform a prospective assessment and ultimately predict and prevent their actions with regard 
to attempting or committing suicide. 
There is a clear unmet medical need for the treatment of patients who suffer from suicidal ideation and/or 
behaviour. There are options such as structured and protective environment for the management of the 
suicidality of these patients. If the patients can be identified, most important rapid management would 
still be hospitalization and optimization of oral antidepressants. 
A reduction in depressive symptoms as measured by the change in the MADRS scale from baseline to 24 
hours after the first dose (Day 2) and from baseline to end of treatment (Day 25) showed large effect 
sizes  for  the  esketamine  84mg  +  SOC  group  compared  to  placebo  +  SOC.  The  currently  available 
antidepressive medications may take several weeks to work. The observed rapid reduction of depressive 
symptoms in a patient population with a moderate to severe episode of MDD and current suicidal ideation 
or behaviour is therefore considered as an important benefit. 
These favourable results, however, did not translate into a meaningful reduction in suicidality indices, as 
it  would  have  been  expected.  There  were  no  relevant  differences  in  scales  measuring  suicidality  and 
suicide  risk  between  esketamine  and  the  combination  of  hospitalisation,  oral  antidepressants, 
benzodiazepines and psychotherapy which were included in the comprehensive SOC. The key secondary 
objective of the Phase 3 studies related to reduction of suicidality was not achieved.  
The failure of the key secondary endpoint (as well as suicidality indices) to show a favourable effect of the 
esketamine 84mg + SOC treatment could be due to the overall optimized management of patients during 
the double-blind treatment phase, since a remarkable improvement was observed also for the placebo 
group. However, despite that statistical significance has not been reached, a trend favouring esketamine 
+ SOC has been observed in some secondary efficacy endpoints, including some suicidality indices (e.g. 
resolution of suicidality and reduction of hopelessness using BHS) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) 
measures (e.g. quality of life using QLDS) on top of comprehensive SOC. The differences however, were 
small and of questionable clinical relevance.  
There is a concern that it would be difficult for prescribers to predict future suicidal behavior, and that 
currently  available  scales  have  limited  utility  in  reliably  identifying  those  patients  who  will  go  on  to 
attempt or complete suicide. Communication and education of healthcare professionals will be required to 
ensure that the appropriate population receives esketamine and to inform about what effects should and 
should  not  be  expected.  The  following  information  was  considered  more  appropriate  for  section  4.4. 
instead of section 4.1: 
“The effectiveness of Spravato in preventing suicide or in reducing suicidal ideation or behaviour 
has not been demonstrated. Use of Spravato does not preclude the need for hospitalisation if 
clinically warranted, even if patients experience improvement after an initial dose of Spravato.” 
The Committee considered that a reference in the therapeutic indication together with a boxed warning 
mentioning suicidal ideation or behaviour may cause misinterpretations. 
Overall, the safety profile of esketamine has not changed from the initial MA in TRD. The same AEs have 
been observed in the studies in this subgroup of patients with MDD. Major safety risks are still considered 
dissociative effects, perceptual changes, increases in BP, somnolence and sedation, as well as an abuse 
potential,  which  put  considerable  limitations  for  the  intended  use.  A  numerical  imbalance  in  deaths, 
suicides and suicide attempts for the esketamine 84mg + SOC increases the uncertainty. In particular, 
compared to placebo, suicidal behaviour in the form of intentional self-injury, suicide attempt, completed 
suicide  and  intentional  overdose  occurred  more  frequently  in  esketamine  treated  subjects.    Further 
analyses show that a clear signal for suicidality cannot be established due to the low numbers and that the 
differences  may  be  explained  by  baseline  imbalances  in  suicidality  risk,  but  the  numerical  difference 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 157/163 
 
 
 
between esketamine and placebo treated subjects still remain. Thus, a relationship can therefore not be 
excluded. This is considered to be sufficiently covered by the suicidality warning in the SmPC of Spravato.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A sizeable positive effect of esketamine treatment in rapidly reducing depressive symptoms as measured 
by  changes  in  the  MADRS  scale,  is  observed.  A  high  percentage  of  patients  showed  remission  of 
depressive  symptoms  (MADRS  total  score  ≤12)  in  both  treatment  groups  with  a  clinically  relevant 
difference in favour of esketamine. The rapid onset of effect is in line with previous study findings in TRD. 
Scales attempting to measure a reduction in suicidality, suicidal ideation/thoughts/behavior did not yield 
statistically significant results in favour of the esketamine 84mg + SOC in patients who have responded 
positively that they Think [even momentarily] about harming or of hurting or of injuring themselves: with 
at least some intent or awareness that they might die as a result; or think about suicide [i.e., about killing 
themselves])  and  who  Intend  to  act  on  thoughts  of  killing  themselves.  Other  secondary  endpoints 
assessing suicidal ideation and/or behaviour did not yield results favouring the esketamine + SOC group.  
A clear clinical benefit for this specific subgroup of patients with MDD, in the form of an improvement in 
suicidal indices would have been expected, in addition to the reduction of depressive symptoms. It can 
only  be  speculated  why  this  objective  has  not  been  met.  The  identification  of  patients  with  suicidal 
ideation who will in fact attempt suicide is not reliably possible, factors other than severity of depression 
add  to  suicidality,  the  scales  used  may  not  be  suitable  or  not  sensitive  enough,  the  large  effect  of 
optimized SOC in the comparator arm made it difficult to show a statistically significant additional benefit, 
or esketamine may indeed have no or only a marginal effect on suicidality. Even a (temporary) negative 
effect on suicidality can currently not be excluded. It is important to mention that, so far, a favourable 
effect on suicidality has also not been shown for other currently approved antidepressive medications and 
that risk of suicidality may even be increased during initial treatment. However, the fact remains that the 
secondary objective of demonstrating a beneficial effect of esketamine - on top of oral antidepressive 
therapy and optimized non-pharmacological measures - on suicidality in adult patients with a moderate to 
severe episode of MDD and current suicidal ideation or behaviour has not been met. 
This has been acknowledged by the Applicant and a note was initially proposed to be included in section 
4.1 of the SmPC to clearly state that the effectiveness of esketamine in preventing suicide or in reducing 
suicidal  ideation  or  behaviour  has  not  been  demonstrated.  Because  of  the  high  relevance  of  this 
information for the safety of patients, the  Rapporteur suggested going a  step further and having this 
information  as  a  boxed  warning.  The  Committee  considered  more  appropriate  that  these  issues  are 
flagged in section 4.4.  
The  Applicant  proposes  to  carefully  educate  healthcare  professionals  to  ensure  that  the  appropriate 
population receives esketamine and on effects that should and should not be expected. The educational 
material for the prescribers has been provided together with a description of a plan for HCPs with a variety 
of  medical  education  activities,  for  example  at  psychiatric  scientific  congresses  (1),  or  as  standalone 
activities (2).  
As a last point, the survey conducted on behalf of the Applicant by a third-party research organization, 
Cello Health Insight, has been prepared and submitted.  In early 2018 Janssen EMEA commissioned the 
independent healthcare market research company, Cello Health Insight, to conduct a market research 
study, designed to quantify the patient population with major depressive disorder with imminent risk of 
suicide (MDSI), as well as to understand the potential role esketamine might have for the treatment of 
this  patient  population.  The  survey  was  conducted  with  671  European  psychiatrists  and  physicians 
(including General Psychiatrists, excluding office-based psychiatrists, Accident and Emergency Physicians 
and Primary Care Physicians, plus office-based psychiatrists). The results outlined in the survey suggest 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 158/163 
 
 
 
that  prescribers  are  proficient  at  recognizing  and  identifying  acute  suicidal  ideation  and  behaviour  in 
patients with MDD, considering a wide range of factors, and that most do so based on factors that can be 
broadly  categorised  as  clinical  evaluations  and/or  interviews.  Most  participants  in  the  survey  (91%) 
indicated that they assessed acute suicidality based on clinical evaluation and interview, including such 
elements  as  clinical/medical  history,  clinical  assessment  of  suicidal  ideation/intent  and  history  of 
suicidality, psychological evaluation, discussion with the patient and family/caregivers. The findings in 
this report are in agreement with the knowledge that the assessment teams have accumulated up to now.  
It is evident that nobody can reliably predict who will go on and attempt or commit suicide. However, 
psychiatrists, as part of their everyday clinical practice, are evaluating MDD patients for suicidal ideation 
and behaviour. 
The adverse event profile of esketamine observed in the submitted studies is generally in line with that 
observed in TRD patients. There are relevant safety issues but they are considered manageable with the 
RMMs  already  in  place  (e.g.  monitoring  of  patient’s  blood  pressure,  administration  in  a  setting  with 
appropriate  resuscitation  equipment  and  healthcare  professionals  with  training  in  cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation  are  available  and  monitoring  of  patients  by  a  healthcare  professional  until  they  are 
considered clinically stable and ready to leave the healthcare setting).   
Overall, the benefit of rapid reduction of depressive symptoms in a severely affected subpopulation with 
MDD is considered to outweigh the risks.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The Applicant has taken into consideration the Committee’s concerns (that key secondary objective of the 
Phase 3 studies related to suicidality was not achieved) and is currently proposing a revised wording for 
the indications: 
The  applicant  has  modified  the  initially  proposed  wording  of  the  indication  and  is  currently  seeking 
approval of SPRAVATO for the following indication: 
Spravato, co-administered with oral antidepressant therapy, is indicated as acute short-term 
treatment for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms, when this is urgently required in 
a psychiatric emergency, as per clinical judgement, in adult patients with a moderate to 
severe episode of MDD (see section 5.1 for a description of the population studied) and 
current suicidal ideation or behaviour. 
The phrase “when this is urgently required” is considered broad and could be misinterpreted by 
physicians. The currently proposed wording “in a psychiatric emergency” is restricting the use of 
Spravato to the patients most in need of the treatment, describes better the population included in the 
clinical studies and avoids any reference to suicidal thoughts or suicidal behavior. 
The wording “for a description of the population studied”, encourages physicians to read section 5.1 
for more details and the presentation of the clinical evidence.  The Applicant’s position is acknowledged. 
However, this latest indication as worded above was considered as too broad and implied that Spravato 
could be given in any psychiatric emergency which could be driven by complex psycho-social events and 
not necessarily be caused by the underlying depression; therefore the CHMP proposed the below 
indication which was agreed by the company: 
“Spravato, co-administered with oral antidepressant therapy, is indicated in adults with a moderate to 
severe episode of major depressive disorder, as acute short term treatment, for the rapid reduction of 
Assessment report  
EMA/141382/2021  
Page 159/163 
 
 
 
 
depressive symptoms, which according to clinical judgement constitute a psychiatric 
emergency (see section 5.1 for a description of the population studied)” 
The proposed text, highlighting that “effectiveness of Spravato in preventing suicide or in reducing 
suicidal ideation or behaviour has not been demonstrated” and that there may be a need for 
hospitalisation, was included at the beginning of section 4.4. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Spravato is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following group of variations 
acceptable and therefore recommends the variations to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following changes:

C.I.6(a): Extension of Indication to include a new indication for Spravato: Spravato, co-administered with 
oral antidepressant therapy, is indicated in adults with a moderate to severe episode of major depressive 
disorder, as acute short term treatment, for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms, which according 
to clinical judgement constitute a psychiatric emergency (see section 5.1 for a description of the 
population studied). 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 6.5 of the SmPC are updated. The RMP version 2.5 
has also been agreed. 
B.II.e.5.a.2: Addition of a new pack size (multipack) of 24 nasal spray devices (multipack of 8 packs of 3 
nasal spray devices) corresponding to 4 weeks of treatment in the new indication. 
The Package Leaflet and labelling are updated in accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to clarify the wording in Annex II.D.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the group of variations, amendments to Annex(es) I, II, IIIA, IIIB and 
addition to IV and amendments to the Risk Management Plan are recommended.

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures  
Prior to the launch of SPRAVATO in each Member State (MS), the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) 
must  agree  about  the  content  and  format  of  the  educational  materials  (EM)  and  the  controlled 
access  programme  (CAP),  including  communication  media,  distribution  modalities,  and  any  other 
aspects of the programme, with the National Competent Authority (NCA).  
The  MAH  shall  ensure  that  in  each  MS  where  SPRAVATO  is  marketed  a  CAP  is  implemented  to 
prevent/minimise the important identified risk of Drug abuse.  
SPRAVATO is intended to be self-administered by the patient under direct Healthcare Professional (HCP) 
supervision  and  should  be  dispensed  to  the  healthcare  settings  where  administration  takes  place,  as 
agreed at the MS level, based on local legal requirements and/or local healthcare systems. When the 
administration is intended for outpatients, it should only be reserved to an environment where the patient 
is  appropriately  followed-up.  SPRAVATO  may  induce  transient  sedation,  dissociative  and  perception 
disorders and/or increase blood pressure. Patients must, therefore, be monitored by a HCP during and 
after  each  treatment  session  including  an  assessment  to  determine  when  the  patient  is  considered 
clinically stable and ready to leave the healthcare setting. In patients with clinically significant or unstable 
cardiovascular  or  respiratory  conditions,  SPRAVATO  should  be  administered  in  a  setting  where 
appropriate  resuscitation  equipment  and  healthcare  professionals  with  training  in  cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation are available.  
Assessment report

The following EM should be provided to HCPs (and acknowledgement of receipt recorded): 
o  The  HCP  guide,  aiming  at  addressing  the  risks  of  Transient  dissociative  states  and  perception 
disorders,  Drug  abuse,  Disturbances  in  consciousness,  and  Blood  pressure  increased,  should 
incorporate adequate reference to patient’s safety, and highlight that: 
•  All patients must be monitored accordingly after SPRAVATO administration until considered 
clinically stable to leave the healthcare setting; 
• 
In  patients  with  clinically  significant  or  unstable  cardiovascular  or  respiratory  conditions, 
SPRAVATO should be administered in a clinical setting where equipment for cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation and staff trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation are available; 
•  Due to the potential risk of cardiac adverse events, the patient’s blood pressure should be 
carefully monitored before and after SPRAVATO intake. 
o  The readiness to leave checklist for HCPs (attached to the HCP guide): the objective of this EM is 
to aid HCPs in evaluating when, following SPRAVATO administration, a patient is deemed stable and 
safely allowed to leave the clinic/facility where SPRAVATO has been administered. 
The following EM should be provided to patients: 
o  The  guide  for  patients,  aiming  at  addressing  the  risks  of  Transient  dissociative  states  and 
perception disorders, Drug abuse, Disturbances in consciousness and Blood pressure increased. The 
objective of this EM is to detail:  
•  Which adverse effects to expect following SPRAVATO administration, and how to minimize 
those effects; 
•  Risk factors/groups/ signs of abuse and dependence, which should be regularly assessed and 
monitored; 
• 
The procedure for SPRAVATO intranasal administration, including preparation (fasting for 2 
hours, no drinking for 30 minutes) and patient’s monitoring; 
The guide for patients also aims at increasing awareness about:

Prior to its launch in each MS, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must agree with the National 
Competent  Authority  (NCA)  all  aspects  of  the  controlled  access  programme  (CAP)  for  SPRAVATO, 
implemented to prevent/minimise the important identified risk of drug abuse. 
SPRAVATO is intended to be self-administered by the patient under direct Healthcare Professional (HCP) 
supervision  and  should  be  dispensed  to  the  healthcare  settings  where  administration  takes  place,  as 
agreed at the MS level, based on local legal requirements and/or local healthcare systems. When the 
administration is intended for outpatients, it should only be reserved to an environment where the patient 
is appropriately followed-up.  
SPRAVATO may induce transient sedation, dissociative and perception disorders and/or increase blood 
pressure. Patients must, therefore, be monitored by an HCP during and after each treatment session, 
including an assessment to determine when the patient is considered clinically stable and ready to leave 
the  healthcare  setting.  In  patients  with  clinically  significant  or  unstable  cardiovascular  or  respiratory 
conditions, SPRAVATO should be administered in a setting where appropriate resuscitation equipment 
and healthcare professionals with training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation are available.

1.  Introduction
The  purpose  of  this  submission submitted on 28 January 2020 is  to  comply  with  Article  46  of  
Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended,  by  submitting  data  available  from  patients  less  
than  18  years  of  age  recruited  to  the  following study: P16-052_P18-839   Post-marketing   
surveillance   study   of   adalimumab   (Humira®)   for   hidradenitis   suppurativa and pediatric 
chronic severe plaque psoriasis patients according to the standard for “Re-examination of New Drugs”
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory, recurrent, follicular skin disease which causes 
significant pain and distress. HS is typically diagnosed in young adults with ongoing disease throughout 
adult life. 
Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs including the skin, joints and heart, 
characterized by skin thickening resulting from the rapid accumulation of epidermal cells.  Psoriasis 
affects approximately 2% of the population and is common in pediatrics. 30 – 32% of psoriasis 
patients develop psoriasis before 15 years of age, 20% from 15– 19 years of age, among these 10% 
before 10 years old, and 2% before 2 years old.
Adalimumab (Humira®) was approved in Korea to treat active moderate to severe HS in adults with an 
inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy and severe chronic plaque psoriasis in 
children and adolescents from 4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are 
inappropriate candidates for topical therapy and phototherapy. The submitted post-marketing 
surveillance study was conducted to fulfill the post-approval regulatory requirement. 
Originally two separate 40-week studies were planned, (study P16-052 (adult HS) and study P18-839 
(ped PsO)), these are now presented as one combined study (P16-052_P18-839). In accordance with 
the Korean Standard for Re-examination of New Drugs requirement, at least 600 subjects should have 
been recruited. However, the MAH explains that, according to the data reported to Health Insurance 
Review & Assessment Service (HIRA), the number of HS and ped PsO patients is expected to be small 
in Korea and among them, only a limited number of patients can be prescribed adalimumab (Humira) 
considering national health insurance benefits criteria. Due to above reasons, minimum number of 
patients to be enrolled was adjusted after Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) approval.
The study P16-052 (adult HS) and the study P18-839 (ped PsO) is presented as one combined study 
(P16-052_P18-839). This AR focuses on evaluation of the pediatric subjects included in the study. 
2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Information on the development program
P16-052_P18-839 Post-marketing surveillance study of adalimumab (Humira) for hidradenitis 
suppurativa and pediatric chronic severe plaque psoriasis patients according to the standard for "Re-
examination of New Drugs” is a standalone study.
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study
The MAH states that patients were administered adalimumab (Humira) injection as per the package 
label.
2.3.  Clinical aspects
2.3.1.  Introduction
The MAH has submitted a final report for the study P16-052_P18-839 Post-marketing surveillance 
study of adalimumab (Humira) for hidradenitis suppurativa and pediatric chronic severe plaque 
psoriasis patients according to the standard for "Re-examination of New Drugs”. 
As determined by the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) the study should be conducted 
within 4 years from the drug approval (Dec 2015). 
The study P16-052 (adult HS) and the study P18-839 (ped PsO) are presented as one combined study 
(P16-052_P18-839).
2.3.2.  Clinical study
Study P16-052_P18-839 Post-marketing surveillance study of adalimumab 
(Humira) for hidradenitis suppurativa and pediatric chronic severe plaque psoriasis 
patients according to the standard for "Re-examination of New Drugs”
Description
This study was designed as a non-interventional, prospective, post-marketing surveillance in 
accordance with Korean Standard of Re-examination of New Drugs. The goals of the study were 
designed to evaluate the real-world safety and effectiveness of adalimumab in Korean HS and pediatric 
chronic severe plaque psoriasis (ped PsO) patients under routine treatment practice.
Methods
The data for the study were collected from medical institutions (clinics and hospitals) in Korea. The 
observational study documentation started with the first application of adalimumab (Baseline) and was 
repeated at Weeks 12 and 24 for HS patients and Weeks 16 and 40 for ped PsO patients.
Participating sites throughout Korea registered patients who were prescribed with adalimumab 
(Humira) for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa and pediatric chronic severe plaque psoriasis. 
The prescription of adalimumab (Humira) was done by each patient's physician under a normal medical 
treatment condition in accordance with the approved use of the drug and the decision to prescribe 
adalimumab (Humira) is independent from the enrollment into the study. The investigators obtained 
consent of participation from a patient (and their legally authorized representative) who was subject to 
the registration for the study. The ped PsO subjects were administered with adalimumab (Humira) for 
40 weeks from his/her first administration (baseline) and HS subjects were followed up for 24 weeks 
from baseline. The visitation for a follow-up was done according to the actual clinical process, and the 
safety evaluation was conducted during the observation period.
The data sources in this study were from institute's medical chart and the data were collected 
prospectively.
Objective(s)
The primary objectives were:
●  To evaluate the following safety measures
○  Serious adverse event/drug reaction
○  Unexpected adverse event/drug reaction
○  Known (labelled) adverse drug reaction
○  Nonserious adverse event/drug reaction
●  To explore effectiveness in the adult population by the analysis of:
For HS:
●  Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response(HiSCR)
●  Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)
For ped PsO:
●  Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75, 90, and 100
●  Change in involved body surface area
Study design
This was a prospective, non-interventional (observational), single country (Korea), post-marketing 
surveillance study.
Study population /Sample size
In accordance with the Korean Standard for Re-examination of New Drugs requirement, at least 600 
subjects should have been recruited. However, due to reasons stated in the Introduction Section, the 
minimum number of patients to be enrolled was adjusted after Ministry of Food and Drug Safety 
(MFDS) approval and 19 subjects (17 HS subjects and 2 ped PsO subjects) were enrolled.
The study population consisted of patients with HS and pediatric patients with chronic and severe 
plaque PsO.  
HS patients had to be at least 18 years old at the start of the investigation, eligible to be treated with 
adalimumab for HS in accordance with the approved Korean label and provided written informed 
consent. For the HS patients, the first patient was included into the study on 10 March 2017 and the 
last contact/last visit of the last patient was on 06 August 2019.
Ped PsO patients had to be children/adolescents, from 4 to 17 years old at the start of the 
investigation, prescribed adalimumab treatment prior to participating in the study, and provided 
written informed consent. For the ped PsO patients, the first patient was included into the study on 25 
June 2019 and the last contact/last visit of the last patient was on 06 August 2019.
Treatments
Patients were administered adalimumab (Humira) injection as per the package label. Unit dose, 
frequency and duration of treatment (start/end date) were recorded on the case report form. If the 
study drug was suspended or terminated during the treatment period, the reason was recorded. The 
treatment compliance was collected.
Outcomes/endpoints
Presence of adverse event(s), type of adverse event(s), onset date, end date, severity, causality 
assessment by investigator on the adverse event(s), action taken, and outcome were captured  from 
all subjects over the study period. Safety information was captured for 24 weeks + 70 days (for HS 
subjects) or 40 weeks + 70 days (for ped PsO subjects). And for early termination subjects, the 1st 
administration ~ the last administration + 70 days. 
Effectiveness assessment 
HS: HiSCR and DLQI were assessed at baseline, Week 12, and Week 24. 
Ped PsO: PASI score and BSA were to be assessed at baseline, Week 16, and Week 40
Statistical Methods
The study population was classified by safety group and effectiveness group.
Safety group: Subjects who have received at least one administration of adalimumab and have 
completed a follow up for obtaining safety information. 
Effectiveness group: Subjects who have been assessed for safety and for whom effectiveness 
evaluation parameters has been recorded at baseline and Week 12 (for HS subjects) or Week 16 (for 
ped PsO subjects).
The collected and analyzed patient number were presented using the following items: planned number 
in a contract with sites, collected number of CRFs, cases for safety evaluation, cases for effectiveness 
evaluation, drop-out cases, and drop-out reasons.
Results
From the approval of both HS and ped PsO in adalimumab (Humira) on 14 Dec 2015 to Dec 2019, the 
post-marketing surveillance period, eight investigators participated in eight institutions. The two 
pediatric patients were recruited from the Ajou University Hospital. A total of 19 patients (17 HS 
subjects and 2 ped PsO subjects) were enrolled and completed the study to evaluate safety and 
effectiveness. The study was concluded early due to low recruitment.
Recruitment/ Number analysed
Subject Disposition Flow Chart – Pediatric Chronic Severe Plaque Psoriasis
Baseline data
For the two ped PsO subjects, there were one female and one male. The mean age was 7.00± 1.41 
years. Height and weight were 118.50± 2.12 cm and 22.50± 2.12 kg, respectively. One subject was 
allergic, and one had a family history. None had hepatic disease (current disease) or renal disease 
(current disease). The disease duration of ped PsO was 4.51± 2.79 years.
Previous Treatment – Pediatric Chronic Severe Plaque Psoriasis 
The 2 pediatric subjects had previously received ciclosporine and topical group III steroids. No 
information on concomitant medication with Humira was provided.
Previous medical histories or current disease 
No previous medical histories or current disease were reported in subjects with ped PsO.
Effectiveness results
The effectiveness of adalimumab treatment was evaluated in 17 subjects. Overall, 94.12% (16/17) of 
subjects showed HiSCR response at Week 12 and 100% (13/13) of subjects showed response at Week 
24.  The changes in DLQI scores at Weeks 12 and24 from baseline were –8.41± 8.02 and –7.85± 
10.15, respectively.  The changes in DLQI scores over time were statistically significant. 
For ped PsO subjects, the mean (± SD) duration of treatment was 0.11± 0.07 years and the total 
dosage was 40.00± 28.28 mg. No subjects with ped PsO were included in the effectiveness group.  
PASI and BSA at Baseline was recorded in both ped PsO patients, but there were no records at Week 
16 (the datacut-off date was before Week 16). All subjects (2 subjects) with ped PsO discontinued the 
study due to other reasons. Last follow up date for both subjects were 2019-08-06. 
Safety results
Neither of the two subjects with ped PsO reported adverse events.
Adverse events were developed in 8 of 19 subjects (42.11%, 12 cases) included in the safety set, all in 
the adult HS population. Among those, adverse drug reactions were reported in 6 subjects (31.58%, 
10 cases).  Unexpected adverse events occurred in 4 subjects (21.05%, 6 cases), all of which were 
adverse drug reactions.  No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events in the "Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders" system organ class (SOC) were the most frequently reported events 
(26.32% of subjects [5/19 subjects, 7 cases]). Also, events in the "Infections and infestations" and 
"General disorders and administration site conditions" SOCs were reported in 10.53% of subjects (2/19 
subjects, 2 cases) each. At the preferred term (PT) level, "Hidradenitis" was reported in 15.79% of 
subjects (3/19 subjects, 4 cases) and "Acne" in 5.26% (1/19 subjects, 2 cases). Among adverse drug 
reactions, the "Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders" SOC was reported in 26.32% of subjects (5/19 
subjects, 7 cases), "Infections and infestations" in 10.53% (2/19 subjects, 2 cases) and "General 
disorders and administration site conditions" in 5.26% (1/19 subjects, 1 case). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects
Study report P16-052_P18-839 presents the results from two non-interventional, prospective, post-
marketing surveillance studies combined into one report. The goals of the studies were to evaluate the 
real-world safety and effectiveness of adalimumab in Korean adult patients with hidradenitis 
suppurativa (HS) and pediatric chronic severe plaque psoriasis (ped PsO) patients under routine 
treatment practice. Although the initial goal was to include in total 600 patients, the actual number of 
study participants had to be reduced in agreement with the authorities, due to low prevalence of the 
two diseases in Korea and limited prescription of adalimumab in these patient groups. The final 
combined study report includes 17 adult patients with HS and 2 children with ped PsO. 
The two patients with ped PsO are not individually presented, information is provided in statistic terms 
which is not very meaningful, and hampers evaluation. The posology is not clear, the report states that 
the pediatric subjects were treated in accordance with the Korean label in which the posology is not 
known to the assessor; however, it is assumed that this is consistent with the EU-approved label. 
The report clearly states that none of the two children experienced an adverse event, and the 
presented mean duration of treatment was short (approximately 40 days) and the total dosage low 
(40.00± 28.28 mg). The reason for the early discontinuation of the children is not clearly presented 
(“other”), but it may be concluded that it was due to the early termination of the study. The date of 
the first child´s first visit was 25 June 2019 and last child´s last visit was 06 August 2019 which is 
identical with the indicated date for end of data collection. The MAH states that no subjects with ped 
PsO were included in the effectiveness group as the study was ended before any of them had reached 
week 16. It is not clear for how long the children were followed for safety, but it is assumed that no 
more data was collected after 06 August 2019.
Due to the incompleteness of the provided information, no firm evaluation of the results is possible. 
However, given what is indeed known, two children, followed at the longest for 43 days and during this 
time not showing any AEs, it is not considered meaningful to pursue this issue further.
Safety profile is consistent with the known safety profile of Humira for the treated patient population. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation
Only two pediatric patients were enrolled in this study, which limits interpretation of the data for a 
pediatric population. No new safety signals have emerged. The benefit-risk of adalimumab is 
unchanged.

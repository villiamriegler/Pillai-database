Lynparza tablets (100mg and 150 mg) for the 
maintenance treatment of gBRCAm metastatic 
pancreatic cancer based on the results from the 
pivotal Phase 3 study, POLO; as a consequence, 
sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 of the SmPC are updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to update section 4.8 for 
lynparza hard capsules (50 mg) to revise list of ADR 
based on the pooled safety data analysis. The RMP 
version 18.3 has also been submitted. Furthermore, 
the PI is brought in line with the latest guideline 
regarding the sodium content. The MAH also took the 
occasion to include some minor editorial changes in 
the PI.

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Lynparza in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

renal insufficiency (study D0816C00006).  In patients with 
recommendations for patients with renal impairment 
based on the results of study D0816C00006 (MEA 
006), that evaluated the influence of mild and 
moderate renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics 
of Olaparib. The Package Leaflet and RMP were 
updated accordingly.  
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to update local 
representatives in the PL, to bring the PI in line with 
the latest QRD template version and introduce minor 
ml/min), AUC increased by 24% and Cmax by 15% 
compared with patients with normal renal function. No 
Lynparza dose adjustment is required for patients with mild 
renal impairment.  In patients with moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance 31 to 50 ml/min), AUC 
increased by 44% and Cmax by 26% compared with 
patients with normal renal function. Lynparza dose 
adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate 
renal impairment. These findings have been reflected in 
section 4.2 as follows:

Furthermore, a grouping of two type IB variation is 
submitted to revise the study milestones dates for

For patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine

Lynparza is 300 mg twice daily (equivalent to a total daily 
dose of 600 mg).  
Lynparza can be administered in patients with mild renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance 51 to 80 ml/min) with no 
dose adjustment. 
Lynparza is not recommended for use in patients with 
severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease 
(creatinine clearance ≤ 30 ml/min) since there are no data 
in such patients.

addition, the MAH took the opportunity to add the

A revised RMP version 9 was agreed during the

took the opportunity to update the due dates for the 
provision of the final study reports of the category 3

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

substrates of OATP1B, BCRP or both transporters, 
including, but not limited to sulfasalazine, methotrexate, 
pravastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin and 
simvastatin. No clinical drug interaction study was 
performed. 
In vitro evaluation of drug interaction potential 
Asciminib is metabolised by several pathways, including the 
CYP3A4, UGT2B7 and UGT2B17 enzymes, and biliary 
secreted by the transporter BCRP. Medicinal products 
inhibiting or inducing the CYP3A4, UGT and/or BCRP 
pathways may alter asciminib exposure. 
(…) 
Asciminib inhibits BCRP, P gp and OATP1B with Ki values of 
24, 22 and 2 micromolar, respectively 
Based on PBPK models, asciminib may increase the 
exposure of medicinal products which are substrates of 
these transporters.

Product Characteristics.

Grouped application comprising two type II 
variations as follows: 
- Submission of the final reports from studies DMPK-
R2200470 (REC). This is an in vitro evaluation of 
inducibility of OATP1V1, MDR1 and CYP3A4 by 
asciminib using human hepatocytes. 
- Submission of the final report from study DMPK-
R2270399 (REC). This is a physiologically based PK 
modelling and simulations to characterize the effect 
of cyclodextrins on the exposure of asciminib. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered

of studies to the competent authority

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Apealea in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

In the ITT population of the pivotal efficacy study, the 
hazard ratios for PFS in the subgroups of patients with first 
relapse and second relapse were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.66;0.97) 
and 1.04 (95% CI: 0.74;1.47), respectively. The hazard 
ratios for OS in patients with first and second relapse were 
0.98 (95% CI: 0.79;1.21) and 1.18 (95% CI: 0.79;1.75), 
respectively. Thus, the results in the subgroup of patients 
with first relapse are consistent with the results in the 
overall population and in addition, there was an indication 
of PFS benefit for Apealea.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication applied for this medicinal product is treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infection 
(cIAI) in adults. 
Intra-abdominal infections include a wide spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from 
uncomplicated appendicitis to faecal peritonitis (Menichetti, 2009). In uncomplicated IAIs the infectious 
process only involves a single organ and does not proceed to peritoneum. Complicated intra-abdominal 
infection extends beyond the hollow viscus of origin into the peritoneal space and is associated with 
either abscess formation or peritonitis (Solomkin, 2010). The peritoneal contamination may result from 
spontaneous perforation (e.g. appendicitis, perforated ulcer or diverticulitis), surgical intervention, or 
trauma. 
Intra-abdominal infections are also classified into community-acquired intra-abdominal infections (CA-
IAIs) and healthcare-acquired intra-abdominal infections (HA-IAIs). CA-IAIs are acquired in the 
community; HA-IAIs develop in hospitalised patients or residents of long-term care facilities. They are 
characterised by an increased mortality because of both the underlying patient health status and the 
increased likelihood of infection caused by multi drugs resistant organisms (Pieracci, 2007). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The most common types of complicated intra-abdominal infections include complicated appendicitis, 
cholecystitis and post-operative infection (Sartelli, 2014). Complicated intra-abdominal infections 
represent the second most common cause of morbidity and mortality after pneumonia in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) (Vincent, 2009), and remain responsible for 20% of the severe sepsis cases in the ICU 
(Herzog, 2010). Among patients who develop persistent or recurrent hospital-acquired cIAI following 
apparently successful surgical source control, mortality may exceed 50% (Herzog, 2010). 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 9/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Complicated intra-abdominal infections are usually polymicrobial in nature. Community-acquired cIAIs 
account for around 70% of cases (Eckmann, 2011), and the major pathogens involved are usual 
residents of the gastrointestinal tract, including Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, and certain 
anaerobes (particularly Bacteroides fragilis). Healthcare-associated cIAIs arising post-operatively 
during hospitalisation, however, commonly involve more resistant flora, which may include extended 
spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, carbapenemase-
producing K. pneumoniae, enterococci, and non-bacterial organisms including Candida spp (Brook, 
2000; Coates, 2005; Herzog, 2010; Sartelli, 2012; Eckmann, 2013; Gonzalez-Villoria, 2016). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The clinical presentation of complicated intra-abdominal infections is non-specific. Patients with cIAI 
may present with abdominal pain or flank pain accompanied by signs and symptoms of systemic illness 
such as fever, elevated blood cell count, increased heart rate and increased respiratory rate. The 
diagnosis is established during surgical procedures such as laparotomy, laparoscopy or percutaneous 
drainage or confirmed by a sonogram or radiographic imaging. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The management of complicated intra-abdominal infections usually involves surgical and/or 
percutaneous drainage, removal of diseased tissue and adequate source control in conjunction with the 
use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or antibiotic combinations (Sartelli, 2010; Solomkin, 2010). 
The emergence of antimicrobial resistance has created a growing unmet need for the development of 
new antibacterials, including for the treatment of cIAI, despite several antibacterial agents are already 
approved for this indication. The increasing rate of drug resistance means that currently available 
treatments are becoming insufficient and there is an urgent need for novel broad-spectrum antibiotics. 
About the product 
Eravacycline is a fluorocycline belonging to the tetracycline class of antibiotics. 
Eravacycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, thus 
preventing the incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains. 
The proposed indication is as follows: 
Xerava is indicated for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in adults, (see 
section 5.1). 
Considerations should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents. 
The proposed posology is as follows: 
Adults 
The recommended dose regimen of Xerava is 1.0 mg/kg every 12 hours for 4 to 14 days.  
The duration of therapy should be guided by the severity of infection and the patient’s clinical 
response.

Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of eravacycline was elucidated by a combination of 1D and 2D 1H and 13C NMR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy and single crystal x-
ray crystallography. 
Eravacycline dihydrochloride is a pale yellow to orange solid, somewhat hygroscopic, crystalline solid, 
freely soluble in water and polar organic solvents. A number of different polymorphic forms have been 
identified with variable levels of solvation depending on the recystallisation solvent. The solid state 
properties of the different active substance crystalline forms were measured by microscopy, x-ray 
powder diffraction (XRPD), dynamic vapour sorption and thermogravimetric analysis. Since the active 
substance is dissolved in aqueous solution as part of the finished product manufacturing process, then 
polymorphic form does not impact any of the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the finished product. 
The polymorphic form is controlled by an XRPD test in the active substance specification. 
Eravacycline contains 4 chiral centres. Enantiopurity is ensured via control of the starting materials, 
the manufacturing process and the active substance specification.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Eravacycline is synthesized in 4 main steps using well-defined custom-synthesized starting materials. 
The synthetic process to each starting material was provided, including information on fate and purge 
of impurities which was used to justify the proposed specifications. The applicant’s proposed starting 
materials were considered acceptable. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis and are clearly listed for each individual 
step. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents 
have been presented. The final crystallization step ensures the correct solvates are routinely formed. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised. All impurities specified in the active substance originate in the later 
steps of the synthetic process and are controlled to suitable levels. Limits for potential genotoxic 
impurities are included in the active substance specification. The limits are well below the acceptable 
intake based on ICH M7 and are considered acceptable. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. The order of bond formation has 
remained the same, with only changes in reagents, solvents, work-ups and crystallizations introduced 
to improve yields, active substance quality, and enable scale up.  
The active substance is packaged in double LDPE bags, placed inside a heat-sealed aluminium bag with 
desiccant,  all  stored  inside  an  HDPE  drum.  The  primary  packaging  complies  with  the  EC  directive 
2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended, and Ph. Eur. 3.1.4. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, HPLC), chloride content 
(ion chromatography), polymorphic form (XRPD), impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents 
(GC), residue of benzene  (GC-HS), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (HPLC), methyl chloride content (GC-MS), 
ethyl chloride (GC-MS), moisture content (KF), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), specific optical rotation 
(Ph. Eur.), endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and bioburden (Ph. Eur.). The active substance specifications are 
based on the active substance CQAs and include tests for each CQA. 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. Limits for potentially 
genotoxic impurities are set in line with ICH M7. Limits for residual solvents have been set according to 
ICH Q3C. Palladium content is controlled in an intermediate so no test is required in the active 
substance specification. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 20 laboratory, pilot and production scale batches of the active substance 
were provided. The batches were manufactured by 4 different manufacturers, 3 of which were used 
during clinical trials. The fourth is the proposed commercial manufacturer. The results were within 
specification at the time of testing and consistent from batch to batch. Comparability between the 
batches used in pivotal clinical trials and those from the proposed commercial manufacturer has been 
demonstrated.

Stability 
Stability data from 7 pilot to production scale batches of active substance from the 2 manufacturers 
using the same process, including 3 from the proposed commercial manufacturer stored in the 
intended commercial package for up to 30 months under long term conditions (5±3 ºC) and for up to 
24 months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. Additional studies were carried out at -20 oC (up to 24 months) and at 40 oC/75% RH (up to 
3 months). 
The parameters tested in the stability studies are appearance, polymorphic form, impurities, assay, 
residual ethanol, alkyl chloride content, water content, endotoxins, and bioburden. The analytical 
methods used were the same as for release. No trends were observed for any of the measured 
parameters under long term conditions, other than a decrease in assay in the first batch. However, the 
later batches show no sign of decreased assay. At higher temperature, impurities increased and the 
content of ethanol dropped as a result of evaporation. 
Forced degradation studies were carried out under thermal (80 oC), photolytic, hydrolytic (aqueous 
acid or base) and oxidative conditions. The active substance degrades under all stressed conditions, 
including light exposure. This study demonstrates that the analytical methods are stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months at 5±3 oC in the 
proposed container which provides sufficient protection from moisture, heat and light. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is a pale yellow lyophilised powder for concentrate for solution for infusion, 
presented in a type I glass vial with rubber stopper and aluminium seal. A 3 mg overfill of eravacycline 
is applied to allow the withdrawal of 50 mg eravacycline freebase.  The lyophilised powder is 
reconstituted with a volume of 5 mL of sterile water for injections (WFI) resulting in a final volume of 
approximately 5.3 ml. The overfill is considered justified. The reconstitution volume corresponds to the 
approximate volume that is removed during lyophilisation and provides a concentration of 
reconstituted drug product of 10 mg/ml. The reconstituted solution is further diluted with 0.9% sodium 
chloride for injection and administered as an intravenous infusion. The target final solution 
concentration of eravacycline free-base in the infusion preparation is 0.3 mg/ml. 
Eravacycline is hygroscopic, photosensitive, highly soluble in aqueous media but prone to epimerisation 
in solution. It was therefore decided to develop a lyophilised formulation of eravacycline for clinical 
development, thereby affording a product that would only be in solution for a limited time to allow for 
reconstitution and intravenous administration. As a dry lyophilised cake, eravacycline finished product 
was expected to have a longer shelf life than a solution formulation. Formulation development studies 
were conducted to provide a suitable and stable formulation that would satisfy the requirements of the 
quality target product profile (QTPP) summarised in Table 1.

To provide a commercially suitable 
finished product 
The QTPP was defined to ensure that the product is suitable for use in clinical practice. Based on this, 
CQAs of the finished product were defined. A criticality assessment and the associated control 
elements including release tests, process parameters and in-process controls (IPCs) were adequately 
described. 
Mannitol was selected as a bulking agent as it is known to allow efficient lyophilisation and helps 
generate a stable and uniform cake. The amount of mannitol was optimised for the lyophilisation 
process, to allow rapid reconstitution, and to afford an isotonic solution for infusion. The solubility and 
stability of eravacycline are pH and temperature dependent. Accordingly, the pH of the lyophilisation 
initial solution is adjusted with NaOH and potentially, HCl. WFI is used as the dissolution solvent to 
minimise bioburden and the active substance is added to a pre-cooled mannitol solution in WFI. All 
excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The lyophilisation cycle was developed, considering freezing temperature and time, temperature ramp 
rate, pressure and drying times and temperatures. The optimised conditions ensure a robust cycle, 
elegant cake, and fast reconstitution time. A robustness study was conducted, varying temperature 
and pressure around the defined set-points which demonstrated that a suitable cake is regularly 
produced. 
Since eravacycline degrades at high temperature, and given that the finished product is a lyophilised 
cake, terminal heat sterilisation is not possible. Therefore, sterile filtration and aseptic processing was 
selected as the method of choice to afford a sterile product for intravenous infusion, in line with the 
decision trees in annex of the note for guidance on development pharmaceutics. The suitability of the 
chosen filter was confirmed following investigations on bacterial retention, bubble point, membrane 
compatibility and extractables. 
Compatibility of intermediate solutions with other manufacturing equipment was also demonstrated. 
Hold times have been defined for different steps of the manufacturing process, and process parameters 
have been defined to minimise degradation. CPPs were defined for each step of the manufacturing 
process and are considered justified.

Early clinical trials were conducted with a slightly different formulation and manufacturing process, and 
using a different polymorph of active substance. However, given that the active substance is dissolved 
prior to lyophilisation and the lyophilisates are reconstituted before intravenous infusion, the different 
formulations are considered comparable. The proposed commercial process and formulation was used 
during phase III clinical trials. 
Compatibility of the finished product with different reconstitution media was investigated. Minimal 
differences were observed between WFI, 0.9% saline solution and 5% dextrose solution, with all 
showing similar levels of degradation. Extractables and leachables studies were conducted with a 
variety of common infusion sets and bags. No extractables or leachables were identified which are 
known compounds of concern. 
The primary packaging is a type I glass vial with a blowback feature with rubber stopper and 
aluminium seal. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. Prior to final closure, vials are filled with a nitrogen headspace using the blowback feature to 
minimise oxidative degradation on storage. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 6 main steps: preparation of the bulk solution and adjustment 
of  pH;  bioburden-reducing  filtration;  sterile  filtration;  aseptic  filling;  lyophilisation;  sealing.  Bioburden 
is  tested  routinely  prior  to  each  filtration  step.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard 
manufacturing process. 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  on  3  consecutive  production  scale  batches  using  the 
described  process.  The  aseptic  filling  process  was  validated  with  3  consecutive  “worst  case  scenario” 
media  fill  runs.  There  were  no  contaminated  units. It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing 
process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The 
in-process  controls,  including  pH  and  bioburden  are  adequate  for  this  type  of  manufacturing  process 
and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
including appearance of container, lyophilisate and reconstituted solution (visual and Ph. Eur.), visible 
particles  (Ph.  Eur.),  identity  (HPLC,  UV),  assay  (HPLC),  impurities  (HPLC),  content  uniformity  (Ph. 
Eur.),  residual  water  (KF),  pH  of  reconstituted  solution  (Ph.  Eur.),  particulate  matter  (Ph.  Eur.), 
endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), and reconstitution time. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  appropriately  validated  in 
accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards  used 
for  assay  and  impurities  testing  has  been  presented.  A  risk  assessment  in  line  with  ICH  Q3D  was 
carried  out  by  the  applicant.  All  sources  of  potential  elemental  impurities  were  considered,  including 
those introduced  intentionally.  The  applicant  provided  batch  analysis data,  using  ICP-MS,  for  all  class 
1,  2A  and  three  class  3  metals  (in  line  with  ICH  Q3D),  demonstrating  that  levels  are  well  below  the 
PDE in each case. The limits for degradants are considered justified given the batch data and the levels 
qualified toxicologically. 
Batch analysis results were provided for 26 batches manufactured on pilot to production scale and 
used throughout the clinical development program. Of these, 4 were manufactured on production scale 
at the commercial site, using active substance sourced from the proposed commercial source. Overall, 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018

the data provided confirms the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture 
to the intended product specification. The finished product is released on the market based on the 
above release specifications, through traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  3  primary  stability  batches  of  finished  product  from  the  proposed  commercial 
manufacturer stored for up to 24 months under long term conditions (5±3 ºC) and for up to 6 months 
under  accelerated  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The 
batches  of  finished  product  were  made  by  previous  manufacturer  involved  in  clinical  trials,  but  using 
the same process. Data from 5 additional supportive batches, stored for up to 12 months under long 
term  and  accelerated  conditions  were  also  provided.  Apart  from  one  supportive  batch,  the  finished 
product  batches  were  manufactured  using  a  different  source  of  active  substance,  though  the 
manufacturing route was the same and the active substance is considered representative. The batches 
are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing. Additional data was generated on batches stored at -20 oC and at 40 oC / 75% RH. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance  of  lyophilisate  and  reconstituted  solution,  assay,  impurities, 
residual water, pH of reconstituted solution, particulate matter, endotoxins, sterility and reconstitution 
time. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
The  only  parameters  showing  any  significant  change  are  assay,  impurities  and  water  content.  For 
assay,  no  trends  were  observed  at  -20,  5  or  25  oC  with  a  decrease  in  assay  observed  only  at  40  oC. 
Levels  of  impurities  remained  stable  at  -20  and  5  oC,  though  a  slight  upward  trend  was  observed  at 
25 oC and a significant increase in impurities noted at 40 oC. Water remained constant at -20 and 5 oC. 
A  slight,  within  specification,  upward  trend  was  observed  at  25  oC  and  a  larger  increase  in  water 
content  was  observed  at  40  oC.  Therefore,  the  applicant  proposed  storage  under  refrigerated 
conditions. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New  Drug  Substances  and  Products.  An  increase  in  impurities  was  observed,  indicating  that  the 
product should be stored inside the cardboard carton to prevent exposure to light. 
In  use  stability  studies  were  carried  out  on  both  the  concentrated  solution  in  WFI  in  vials,  and  the 
diluted 0.9% NaCl solution in infusion bags. It was demonstrated that the concentrate is stable for up 
to 1 hour at 25 oC once reconstituted in WFI in vials. The diluted 0.9% NaCl solution in infusion bags is 
stable  for  up  to  12  hours  at  25  oC  and  for  up  to  72  hours  stored  at  5±3  oC,  i.e.  under  refrigerated 
the  method  of 
conditions.  However, 
from  a  microbiological  point  of  view,  unless 
opening/reconstitution/dilution  precludes  the  risk  of  microbial  contamination,  the  product  should  be 
used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions are the responsibility 
of the user. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months at 5±3 oC in a refrigerator as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. The vials should be kept inside the cardboard carton to 
protect the finished product from exposure to light. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. Suitable information on 
storage, handling and reconstitution of the finished product have been provided and is included in the 
SmPC. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
As already mentioned, eravacycline is a fluorocycline and belongs to the tetracycline class of 
antibiotics. Eravacycline differs from other tetracyclines based on modifications at C-7 (fluorine atom) 
and C-9 (pyrrolidinoacetamido group) on the phenyl ring. These modifications confer increased activity 
and stability against tetracycline-specific efflux and resistance due to ribosomal protection proteins 
(RPP). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The applicant of this marketing authorisation application has conducted several in vitro and in vivo 
studies to address the primary pharmacodynamics of eravacycline.  
Eravacycline is primarily bacteriostatic and has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against a variety of 
aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including important pathogens that 
cause intra-abdominal infections with MIC90 values ranging from lower values up to 1 to 4 mg/L. Also 
against A. baumanii the MIC90 values were ranging from 1 to 4 mg/L in different data sets. The poorer 
activity against P. aeruginosa with MIC90 values of 16 to 32 mg/L is similar to what has been seen 
with other agents of the tetracycline class.  
Eravacycline was evaluated in vivo using several non-clinical efficacy models of serious hospital- and 
community-acquired infections produced by pathogens including E. coli (tetracycline-resistant and 
ESBL producing strains), K. pneumoniae (ESBL strains), S. aureus (methicillin- and tetracycline-
resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae (tetracycline-resistant strain), 
and B. fragilis. Overall, eravacycline was efficacious in most of the non-clinical models used. 
The in vitro and in vivo primary pharmacodynamics studies are presented in more detail in the clinical 
section of this assessment report.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
During the assessment the applicant has submitted the final study report of a receptor binding study 
(off target screening). CHMP noted some deficiencies in the overall response. Despite the fact that a 
significant inhibition (62-74%) was observed for the human muscarinic M2 receptor, the LCK kinase 
and acetylcholinesterase enzyme, no follow-up studies were conducted in order to determine IC50 and 
Ki values. Moreover, the applicant did not discuss the potential biological consequences of binding to 
these three targets (M2, LCK, acetylcholinesterase) which would have been expected, given that the 
exposure margin was approximately 6-fold to the unbound clinical Cmax of eravacycline. Nevertheless, 
CHMP noted that in the clinical trials there were no obvious side effects observed with regard to 
enhanced cholinergic transmission (e.g. hypotension, bradycardia, bronchoconstriction and 
hypersecretion) or any anti-cholinergic effects (e.g. dry mouth, tachycardia, urinary retention, blurred 
vision and hyperthermia). Thus, CHMP agreed that it appeared that eravacycline displays a low risk for 
off target effects at clinical relevant plasma concentration. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The potential of eravacycline to alter cardiovascular, respiratory system and CNS was examined as part 
of the safety pharmacology dossier provided. Studies conducted consisted of in vivo intravenous 
studies on the central nervous system in rats, and the cardiovascular and respiratory system in dogs. 
Furthermore, an in vitro cardiovascular electrophysiology study was performed on cells expressing the 
hERG gene.  
Cardiovascular 
It was not possible to establish the in vitro hERG channel inhibition due to insolubility, and this was 
thus reported as >22.2 μM (14.0 µg/mL). At 22.2 µM the inhibition was only 8%. The hERG assay was 
conducted in the absence of proteins; eravacycline in humans is moderately protein bound in plasma 
(unbound fraction 15-20%). The most conservative estimate, with the highest C max (5.5 µg/mL) and 
highest fraction unbound (20%), gave a 13 fold exposure margin (14 µg/mL/(0.2x5.5 µg/mL)) to the 
highest measured inhibitory concentration. The exposure margin to the IC50 could thus be set as >13-
fold. 
In vivo cardiac safety pharmacology (telemetry) studies in dogs did not show any signal for QT 
prolongation at the doses tested (5, 15, and 30 mg/kg). However, the administration of eravacycline 
doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg caused increase in heart rate and blood pressure associated with 
quantitative changes in ECG intervals, namely shortenings of the PR and QT intervals. The symptoms 
were suggested to be associated with acute histamine-release, which in turn has been suggested to be 
more pronounced in rats and dogs than in humans. Consequently, CHMP agreed that it was not 
possible to definitely conclude, based on this study, whether eravacycline produces QT prolongation. 
The thorough QT/QTc study in healthy subjects (TP-434-004) did not reveal any concerns for the 
cardiac safety profile for eravacycline (assessed in more detail in the clinical section). The NOAEL for 
hemodynamic parameters and ECG activity was set at 5 mg/kg with Cmax of 5.45 µg/mL and an AUClast 
of 15.5 µg·h/mL (~2x margin to clinical exposure).  
Respiratory 
The effect of eravacycline on the respiratory system was investigated in telemerized dogs in the same 
study in which the cardiovascular parameters were addressed (doses 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg). A dose-
dependent increase in respiratory rate was observed during the dosing and 30-60 min after the 
infusion end (48-50% increase at maximum). Values returned to baseline within 4 hours after the 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018

infusion start. The NOAEL for respiratory parameters in dogs was determined to be 5 mg/kg with Cmax 
of 5.45 µg/mL and an AUC last of 15.5 µg·h/mL (~2x margin to clinical exposure). 
Central nervous system 
The CNS effects were investigated by means of a functional observation battery in rats that were 
administered 0, 4, 30, and 60 mg/kg eravacycline. No clinical observations were noted after 
administration of 4 mg/kg. Administration of 30 and 60 mg/kg was associated with clinical 
observations of laboured breathing, swelling, and skin erythema, with changes in CNS activity and 
excitability (including reduction in rearing counts and activity/arousal and instances of muscle 
fasciculation) and with effects on the ANS, sensorimotor system, neuromuscular system (including 
ataxia and gait pattern abnormalities), as well as with decreased body temperature. Some of these 
changes were severe, but all were transient. The only time points investigated in the study were 5 min 
and 24 h after end of infusion. In the autoradiography studies (TTP-01) it was shown that the amount 
of eravacycline that distributes to the brain is low and that the limited distribution that do occur takes 
place immediately. CHMP agreed nevertheless that in the current setting it is not possible to evaluate 
the duration of the response or establish whether there was a delay in any reactions. Potential CNS 
effects based on clinical signs of toxicity were noted in the toxicity studies. Numerous clinical signs 
were observed in the rat and dog, whereas no CNS-related clinical signs were observed in the monkey. 
Of the noted clinical observations, some, but not all, can be attributed to an acute release of 
histamine.  
It was observed that there were signs of changes in thermoregulation in both rat and dog in the safety 
pharmacology and toxicology studies. After a single dose, rats have shown reduced body temperature 
and dogs show increased body temperature. Following repeated doses, rats after 14d and 13w have 
shown wet furs and extra salivation at lower doses, and lower body temperature at higher doses, while 
dogs (14d) showed signs of reduced temperature.  
No pharmacokinetic evaluation was performed in the rat CNS study. However, based on a separate PK 
study in rats, the NOAEL dose 4 mg/kg produced an eravacycline back-extrapolated maximum plasma 
concentration (Cp0) value of 11.4 and 11.0 µg/mL in male and female rats, respectively, and an area 
under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable time point (AUC0-last) 
value of 8.85 and 9.79 µg x h/mL in males and females, respectively. This compares with the clinical 
median Cmax of 1.1 µg/mL and AUC0-24 of 7.0 µg x h/mL (~1.3 x margin to clinical exposure). 
Conclusion on safety pharmacology 
The applicant has investigated the safety pharmacology of eravacycline in accordance with the current 
EU regulatory guidelines. The most important observed pharmacological effect of eravacycline was the 
ability to liberate histamine. CHMP agreed nevertheless that the clinical relevance of this in humans is 
limited.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
The applicant has conducted studies evaluating fractional inhibitory concentrations when eravacycline 
was combined with other agents. In general, the antimicrobial interaction of eravacycline with other 
antibacterial agents for aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and for B. fragilis was found 
to be indifferent for nearly all antibiotic combinations and bacteria evaluated. Data generated from 
these studies are presented in the clinical section of this assessment report.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The combined Cmax values from the phase 2 and 3 studies in patients ranged from 0.2 to 5.5 µg/mL, 
with  a  median  value  of  1.1  µg/mL.  The  corresponding  exposure  expressed  as  AUC0-24  ranged  from 
1.4 to 21.2 µg x h/mL, with a median of 7.0 µg x h/mL. With the submission of the new Phase 3 study 
the pharmacokinetic parameters were updated. The applicant was asked to clarify how the clinical AUC 
used for the calculation of exposure margins was derived. The applicant responded that the nonclinical 
exposure  margins  were  calculated  using  the  AUC  and  Cmax  values  (i.e.  calculated  AUC0-24  =  13.5 
µg*h/mL  and  Cmax=  1.53  µg/mL)  derived  from  the  population  pharmacokinetics  (popPK),  using 
patient  data  from  clinical  phase  III  studies  (TETR-CSC-106)  analysis.  The  applicant  has  consequently 
updated the exposure margins, which have been reflected in section 5.3 of the Xerava SmPC. 
Methods of analysis 
Eravacyline and its metabolites TP498, TP-6208, and TP-034 were quantified by liquid chromatography 
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in plasma samples of mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and 
human. Metabolite concentrations and patterns in plasma, urine, faeces, bile and homogenates of liver 
from rat, dog and human ADME studies were obtained by high performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC). Metabolite structural elucidation was carried out using validated LC-MS/MS and HPLC MS/MS. 
The bioanalytical methods are, in general, considered adequate and performed in accordance with GLP 
compliance.  
Absorption 
The ability of eravacycline to cross cell membranes was assessed in vitro using MDCK cells, a common 
model for evaluating intestinal absorption and blood brain barrier penetration, and the PAMPA system 
was used to evaluate eravacycline’s potential to cross an artificial membrane. Passive permeability was 
low in all in vitro assays tested, suggesting that eravacycline has a low potential to cross the blood-
brain barrier and for passive transcellular absorption. 
After a single intravenous dose, the Tmax values ranged from 0.1 to 2 h in the plasma of mice, rats, 
rabbit dogs and monkeys, which is similar to Tmax in humans (1 h).  
Following intravenous injection, exposure (Cmax and AUC) to eravacycline increased with increasing 
doses, but this increase was generally greater than proportional to the increase in dose, and systemic 
clearance and volume of distribution decreased with increasing doses in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus 
monkeys.  Plasma clearance of eravacycline was dose-dependent and low in all species, ranging from 
0.104 L/h/kg in rabbits to 0.487 L/h/kg in cynomolgus monkey. The decline in systemic plasma 
concentrations of eravacycline after i.v. doses was multiphasic, indicating distribution and elimination 
processes. The plasma systemic half-life was moderate (T1/2 = 5.2 – 7.2 h) in rats and rabbits and 10 
to 15 h in dogs and monkeys. The plasma half-life was variable in humans, ranging from 8.65 to 25.62 
h in the SAD and MAD studies. The volume of distribution (Vd) was moderate and ranged from 0.7 to 4 
L/kg across species.   
There was little or no accumulation (<2-fold) of eravacycline after repeated intravenous dosing and 
there was no obvious gender difference in the pharmacokinetics parameters of eravacycline after single 
or multiple doses. 
Absorption of eravacycline metabolites  
The PK parameters of the eravacycline metabolites TP-498 and TP-6208 after a single i.v. dose of 
eravacycline were examined in various non-clinical species. In all species where measured, plasma 
concentrations of the major human eravacycline metabolites (TP-498 and TP-6208) increased with 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 20/134 
 
 
 
 
 
dose, but were lower than those of eravacycline. TP-498 AUC represented between 9% and 25% of 
eravacycline AUC in monkey, dog and rabbit and 7% to 16% in human. The systemic exposure of TP-
498 was not evaluated in the rat. The exposure (AUC) of TP-6208 was between 0.2% and 2.5% of the 
eravacycline exposure in rabbit and dog and 27 to 40% in human. There were no obvious sex 
differences in the PK parameters for TP-498 and TP 6208. 
Distribution 
Tissue distribution in pigmented rats was evaluated by quantitative whole body autoradiography 
(QWBA) after single intravenous dosing. The distribution of radiolabelled eravacycline was rapid, 
widespread and concentrated in the trachea, adrenal gland, liver, and aorta.  Radioactivity was 
generally BLQ 21 days post-dose, with the exception of the uveal tract, bone (including teeth and 
tracheal hyaline cartilage), thyroid, aorta, bone marrow and pigmented fur. A concentration of 
radioactivity in the uveal tract and pigmented fur is consistent with the binding of eravacycline to 
melanin-containing structures, which has been observed with other tetracycline antibiotics. Given the 
lack of ocular adverse effects in the non-clinical studies (see also toxicology section) or in the clinic, 
CHMP agreed that the binding of eravacycline to melanin does not appear to be associated with any 
obvious risk for adverse ocular effects in patients. 
Eravacycline passed the placental barrier in rats and rabbits (see also toxicology section). Foetal 
plasma concentrations were in the same range of maternal drug plasma concentrations. 
Protein binding was species-dependent with highest binding in monkey (ranging from 94.7% to 99.6% 
at 0.1 to 100 µg/mL). Moreover, the protein binding in vitro was inversely related to the concentration, 
with the percent free fraction (fu) decreasing with increasing concentrations of eravacycline, which is a 
rather unusual profile. In all species, eravacycline showed concentration-dependent protein binding 
where the fraction unbound eravacycline decreased with an increase in the total concentration. A 
mechanistic reason for these differences has not been explored.  Furthermore, the plasma protein 
binding of eravacycline was decreased in the presence of high (1 µg/mL) concentrations of the major 
human metabolite TP-6208, suggesting that these compounds compete for common binding sites. 
Regarding the other metabolites, the protein binding of eravacycline in the presence and absence of 
TP-498, the epimer of eravacycline, was not determined because of the uncontrolled interconversion of 
TP-498 and eravacycline. TP-034 is present in plasma at low levels (approximately 30-fold lower than 
TP-434) and was accordingly not included in the protein binding studies. This binding interaction 
(displacement) between eravacycline and its metabolite(s) is unlikely to be of clinical relevance since 
the protein binding in humans is moderate (<90% at concentrations exceeding the clinical therapeutic 
concentrations by 10-fold (i.e. at 10 µg/mL)).  
The blood:plasma concentration ratios in samples with heparin were between 0.90 and 1.3 in humans, 
suggesting that eravacycline is not preferentially taken up by or bound to blood cells. The 
blood:plasma distribution ratio of eravacycline in animals was not reported by the applicant, but this 
was considered acceptable by CHMP. 
Metabolism 
Unchanged eravacycline is the major drug-related component in rat, dog and human plasma and urine 
after a single IV dose. Qualitatively similar metabolites are found in the plasma of humans, rats and 
dogs. The metabolic turnover of eravacycline is, however, very slow, with negligible loss (e.g., <15%) 
up to 4 h after incubation with concentrations of 1-100 μM in competent liver microsomes, intestinal 
microsomes, hepatocytes, or S9 fractions of rat, dog, monkey and human. In vitro studies examining 
the metabolic turnover of eravacycline by hepatocytes and subcellular fractions together with in vivo 
studies have shown that oxidative metabolism by oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring via CYP3A4 and FMO 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018

enzymes to the cyclised metabolite TP-6208, chemical epimerisation at C-4 to TP-498 and hydrolysis of 
the amide side chain to TP-034 appeared to be the predominant metabolic pathways in animals and 
humans.  
The metabolites of eravacycline formed in vivo were identified in plasma and excreta from rat, dog, 
cynomolgus monkey, and human following i.v. administration of eravacycline using LC/MS/MS 
methods. The exposure to metabolites (especially TP-6208 and TP-034) was low in animals compared 
to humans. In order to reach adequate plasma concentrations in the toxicology studies, the human 
metabolites TP-6208 and TP-034, were dosed to animals in some of the toxicology studies in order to 
qualify them adequately.  
Following a single intravenous administration of eravacycline in the human mass balance study, most 
of the circulating radioactivity in the 0-24 hour (AUC 0-24h) pooled sample attributable to eravacycline 
(59.3 ± 9.3%, range 44-69%), TP-498/TP-6208 (29.7 ± 3.6%, range 26-35%) and TP-034 (2.4 ± 
3.3%, range 0-8%). 
The major human metabolites TP-6208/ TP-498 as well as the minor metabolite TP-034 are not 
considered to be reactive or pharmacologically active by CHMP.  
Metabolites in milk  
Metabolites in milk were assessed following a repeated intravenous dose of eravacycline (3, 5, 10 
mg/kg/day) in the developmental and perinatal/postnatal reproduction studies in rats. The major 
component in milk and maternal plasma was eravacycline. In addition, the major human metabolites 
TP-498 and TP-6208 are found in rat milk after eravacycline dosing, and also in foetal rat plasma. 
Concentrations of TP-498 in rat milk were 14 to 19-fold lower than concentrations of eravacycline and 
TP-6208 concentrations were several 100-folds lower compared with eravacycline concentrations. 
The wording proposed by the applicant with regard to breast-feeding in section 4.6 of the SmPC was 
considered appropriate by CHMP.  
Excretion 
Mass balance data was obtained from rats, dogs and humans. Overall, the results indicate that 
elimination pathways for eravacycline in rats and humans are similar; the majority of absorbed drug-
related radioactivities indicate that faecal and/or biliary elimination (rat 66%, human 48%) is the 
major route of excretion for eravacycline and/or its metabolites, and a somewhat smaller fraction is 
eliminated into urine (rat 25%, human 35%). In humans, parent compound accounted for 
approximately 20% in each excreta. 
In conclusion, the non-clinical pharmacokinetic profile of eravacycline is considered by CHMP to have 
been adequately characterized. Rats and monkey were chosen by the applicant as target species for 
the toxicology studies, since eravacycline dosing was not well tolerated in dogs due to a histamine-like 
response. As a result of quantitative differences in the metabolic profile in non-clinical species and 
humans, the animals received intravenous dosing of the major human metabolites in selected pivotal 
toxicity studies to allow for complete evaluation of the toxicity of eravacycline. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicological profile of eravacycline has been investigated in line with the principles and 
practices outlined in ICH and OECD. All pivotal studies followed GLP regulations. The rat was chosen as 
the rodent species and the monkey as the non-rodent species, as eravacycline metabolism is similar to 
humans with regards to formation of the TP-6208 metabolite. Dogs were also used for repeat-dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 22/134 
 
 
 
 
 
toxicity studies and rabbits were used during reproductive toxicity studies. All pivotal studies used the 
intended IV route of administration. 
Some PK studies were done in chimpanzees, but this species is not to be used for non-clinical testing.  
Single dose toxicity 
The applicant has not presented any pivotal GLP single dose toxicity studies, which was considered 
acceptable. The acute toxicity in relation to the intended clinical use data was not considered a concern 
by CHMP. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Morbidity and mortality 
Morbidity and mortality were observed in both in rats and dogs, but not in monkeys.   
In the 14-day GLP study in rats, administration of 40 mg/kg/day resulted in morbidity in 3 animals on 
day 11 and 12. Also in the 13 weeks study three animals (one per dose group) were euthanized on 
days 29, 115 and 60. These animals displayed numerous clinical signs among the most pronounced 
was swelling of extremities, dry red material on several parts of the body, wet fur, skin erythema, 
salivation and laboured breathing. Treatment–related macroscopic findings included pale discoloration 
of the liver that correlated microscopically with hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolation in the liver and 
bilaterally enlarged forepaws and hind paws that correlated microscopically to oedema and necrosis of 
the skin/subcutis likely due to vasculopathy and moderate fibrosis.   
In dogs, treatment-related mortality was observed at ≥12 mg/kg/day. In this group 4/10 animals were 
euthanized during dosing and the rest before end of recovery. Similarly, 6/10 animals in the high-dose 
group (20 mg/kg/day) were euthanized during dosing and the rest before the end of recovery. These 
deaths were due to severe loss of body weight (-22.3% to -29.0% from baseline), diminished appetite, 
numerous gastrointestinal clinical signs, and/or dehydration. In this study dosing was ended on Day 7 
for all of the 20 mg/kg/day animals.  
Clinical observations  
In rats, treatment–related clinical signs were generally present in a dose-dependent manner and were 
more severe, observed more frequently, and took longer to resolve in the 40-mg/kg/day group. 
Observations at ≥4 mg/kg/day included skin erythema, chromodacryorrhea, stereotypic behaviour, 
wet fur, urine staining, and dry red material (nose, mouth, face, eyes, forepaws, forelimbs, abdomen, 
and/or tail). At higher doses (≥20 mg/kg/day) swelling, lacrimation, ataxia, salivation, and nasal 
and/or tail discharge was observed. In the 40-mg/kg/day group loss of body temperature, laboured 
breathing, vocalisation, facial oedema, apparent blood around the eyes (porphyrin staining), hunched 
posture, and rough hair coat were observed. The onset of skin erythema, swelling, chromodacryorrhea, 
lacrimation, ataxia, salivation, loss of body temperature, laboured breathing, stereotypic behaviour, 
nasal and/or tail discharge, vocalisation, and facial oedema generally began shortly after dosing, as 
early as 1 minute post dose, and lasted minutes to approximately 4 hours post-dose, with recovery by 
4 hours. 
In dogs, reversible acute skin reactions (hives, skin erythema, and swelling) were apparent in all of the 
animals administered ≥12 mg/kg/day for 14 days and were sometimes accompanied by scratching. 
Following administration of ≥12 mg/kg/day gastrointestinal clinical signs were severe and included 
emesis (sometimes more than once per day) and soft/mucoid faeces; these signs were often

EMA/540193/2018  
Page 23/134 
 
 
 
 
 
accompanied by salivation and green/orange/black faeces. Some similar findings were also present in 
the 2 mg/kg/day group. In addition, observations of shivering and animals cold to touch were recorded 
(see also discussion on safety pharmacology). 
In monkey, diarrhoea, watery diarrhoea, soft faeces, emesis (containing white, yellow, or red 
material), excessive salivation, thinness, dermal atonia, inappetence, and/or pale gums were found in 
the 18-mg/kg/day group (at >72 times the patient exposure) . With the exception of soft faeces, all 
clinical observations occurred intermittently and only during the second week of the dosing period. In 
the prolonged 13-week study there were no clinical observations.  
Body weight and food consumption  
In rats, dosing for 14 days was associated with statistically significant decreases in mean body weight 
in the 20- and 40-mg/kg/day males (-7.0% and -21.8%, respectively) on Day 14. During the recovery 
phase, the 40-mg/kg/day males exhibited a statistically significant decrease in mean body weight on 
Day 21 (-20.3%) and non-statistically significant decreases in mean body weight on Days 28 and 35, 
suggesting a trend toward recovery. In this group a statistically significant decreases (-20.8%) in 
mean food consumption was observed after 14 days. Mean food consumption was comparable to that 
of the control group during the 3-week recovery period, indicating a full recovery. Also in the 13 week 
study body weights and body weight gains over the entire dosing period were significantly reduced in 
the 16 mg/kg/day males (-12%). During the recovery period, mean body weights continued to be 
significantly reduced in these males. However, there was a rebound in weight gain for the overall 
recovery period and body weight gains were comparable among the 5 dose groups. There was no 
treatment-related effect on body weights, food consumption and body weight gains during the dosing 
period in the female rats. 
Also in dogs, the data show a decrease in food consumption (up to -29%); however considering the 
overall mortality in this study the data are uncertain.  
In monkeys, in the 14 day study, weight was lost in the high-dose group males (up to -16.6%) and 
females (up to -18%). After dosing, the data showed body weight gains in these animals (ranging from 
+11% to +16.9%). Also in the 90 days study in the male monkeys dosed ≥4 mg/kg/day, body weights 
were decreased up to 10.6%, which were resolved after recovery.  
Haematology and coagulation  
In rats, 14 days administration of ≥20 mg/kg/day was associated with statistically significant, dose-
dependent decreases (up to -26%) in mean RBC, haemoglobin, and haematocrit. In addition, 
decreases in mean absolute reticulocyte count and mean corpuscular volume (up to -75%) were 
present in the 40-mg/kg/day males and decreases in mean absolute eosinophil count (up to -84%) in 
the 20-mg/kg/day females and 40-mg/kg/day males/females. All these effects were most likely a 
consequence of eravacycline-induced bone marrow hypoplasia. The decrease in mean absolute 
lymphocyte count (up to -39%) in the 40-mg/kg/day males may be correlated with the microscopic 
findings of lymphoid depletion. In the 13-week study erythrocytes, haemoglobin, and haematocrit were 
significantly decreased (up to -16.2%) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin and mean corpuscular 
volume were significantly increased (up to +6.3%) in the 16 mg/kg/day males at the end of the dosing 
period. Lymphocyte and basophil counts were significantly decreased (up to -54.7%) in ≥8 mg/kg/day 
males and eosinophils were significantly decreased (up to -59.9%) in the 16 kg/kg/day males. All 
treatment-related haematology parameters had reached levels comparable to control values at the end 
of recovery. 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 24/134 
 
 
 
 
 
In dogs, several parameters were affected including decreases in mean absolute reticulocyte counts, 
platelet counts, absolute lymphocyte counts, absolute monocyte counts, absolute eosinophil counts, 
absolute basophil counts, and absolute large unstained cell counts on day 15 at 12 mg/kg/day. These 
changes correlated to the bone marrow atrophy and lymphoid atrophy in the thymus, spleen, and 
lymph nodes, which was also reflected by decreases in the absolute and relative mean spleen (up to -
86.3%) and thymus (up to -77.0%) weights at ≥12 mg/kg/day. The recovery data was hampered by 
the mortality in this study.  
In monkeys, changes in the 18-mg/kg/day males and females included alterations of lower RBC indices 
(RBC, haemoglobin, and haematocrit) in females and lower reticulocyte count and lower platelet count 
in males. Test article-related decreased anti-KLH immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels were 
observed in the 8-mg/kg/day males and females on Days 41, 43, 47, 53, and 57, consistent with 
impairment of immune function. 
In dogs, treatment-related changes included prolongation of mean PT (up to +25%) and APTT (up to 
+66%) at 12 mg/kg/day on Day 15 and prolongation of mean PT (up to +33%) and APTT (up to 
+42%) at 20 mg/kg/day on Day 8. Changes in electrolyte values such as slight decreases (up to -16% 
from control or baseline) in mean potassium, calcium, sodium, and chloride values were also observed 
in some of the animals at ≥12 mg/kg/day at the end of the dosing phase. 
In monkeys, higher APTT, lower cholesterol, higher urea nitrogen, higher bilirubin, and lower urine pH 
in the 18-mg/kg/day group males and females. All of these findings were recoverable. 
Clinical chemistry 
In rats, statistically significant increases in mean fibrinogen values were observed in 40-mg/kg/day 
dosed males (+72%), as well as the 4-, 20-, and 40-mg/kg/day dosed females (up to +91%). The 
changes in fibrinogen correlated with mild to moderate fibrosis and minimal to marked chronic-active 
inflammation at the administration site of the 40-mg/kg/day dosed animals. Dose-dependent 
decreases in mean total protein values were noted on Day 15 for the 20- and 40-mg/kg/day males (up 
to -11%) and 40-mg/kg/day females (-9%). This decrease correlated with statistically significant 
decreases in albumin and albumin/globulin ratio levels. The changes were considered to be non-
adverse at 40 mg/kg/day. By Day 36, all treatment-related serum chemistry parameters had reached 
levels comparable to control values, indicating full recovery. 
Macro/Microscopic observations 
Effects on lymphoid and bone marrow systems  
At the day 15 necropsy in rat, treatment–related organ weight changes were present in the spleen and 
thymus of 40 mg/kg/day males and females. Microscopically findings of minimal to moderate bone 
marrow hypoplasia and minimal to moderate increase in haemosiderin pigmentation and minimal to 
mild macrophage hyperplasia in the spleen were observed. After recovery a moderate bone marrow 
hypoplasia was still observed. Also in the 13 week rat study at 8 mg/kg/day, a decreased thymus 
weight was recorded. In this study the incidence of microscopic findings and/or severity grade of 
mandibular, mesenteric lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue were increased at ≥4 
mg/kg/day.  These findings were characterized by a decreased lymphoid cellularity resulting in a 
decrease in size and often density of lymphocytes and/or germinal centres. All changes were 
recoverable.  
In dog dosed at ≥2 mg/kg/day, a decrease in splenic weights were recorded (up to -86.3%), 
correlated with lymphoid atrophy. In addition, there was haemorrhage in lymph nodes, bone marrow 
atrophy, and lymphoid atrophy in the thymus, and lymph nodes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 25/134 
 
 
 
 
 
In monkey dosed at ≥2 mg/kg/day, lower spleen and thymus weights were recorded (up to -26.7% 
and -52.1% respectively); and histopathologic changes of bone marrow depletion, lymphoid depletion 
in the spleen, thymus, axillary lymph nodes, mandibular lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, and 
Peyer’s patches was observed in the high-dose group (18 mg/kg/day). All but thymus changes were 
recoverable.  
Effects on the male reproductive system  
In rats, administration of eravacycline for 14 days caused reductions in the weight of the prostate, 
epididymis, testis and seminal vesicles at ≥8 mg/kg/day. The effect on the weight of the seminal 
vesicle correlated with microscopic findings of mild to moderate atrophy and decrease in secretions. 
After recovery, minimal to mild degeneration of the seminiferous tubules was observed, as well as 
minimal to mild oligospermia, and minimal to moderate cellular debris in the epididymides. Additional 
findings in the 13 week study included: decreased release of residual bodies, uptake of residual bodies 
by Sertoli cells, spermatid retention in the seminiferous tubules, increase of spermatid head retention 
in Sertoli cells, and vacuolation of Sertoli cells, decreased sperm, cribriform change and abnormal 
shaped sperm. The effect on the male reproductive organs and potential effect on fertility were 
specifically addressed in dedicated fertility studies (see reproductive toxicity section).  
No effects on male reproductive organs were observed in monkey or dog. 
Bone discoloration 
In rat at the end of the 13 week dosing period, yellow discoloration of the calvaria and femurs was 
observed in 1/10 males at 8 mg/kg/day and in 7/9 males at 16 mg/kg/day; yellow discoloration of the 
calvarium was observed in 1/10 females at 16 mg/kg/day and yellow discoloration of the femur was 
observed in 1/10 and 4/10 females at 8 and 16 mg/kg/day, respectively. No microscopic correlate to 
the yellow discoloration was observed in the bone tissue of the calvaria or femurs, and these changes 
were considered non-adverse. Similarly, at the recovery necropsy, yellow discoloration of the femurs 
(3/5 males and females) and calvaria (2/5 females) was observed at 16 mg/kg/day. Observation of 
yellow discoloration was also recorded in juvenile rats (see below) and in the monkey dosed ≥1 
mg/kg/day, which was not recovered.   
Administration site 
Administration site findings in both rat and monkey were characterized by mild to moderate fibrosis, 
minimal to marked chronic-active inflammation, minimal to marked vasculopathy, necrosis of 
endothelium with fibrin deposition, minimal to moderate subacute muscle inflammation, muscle 
degeneration, and/or muscle regeneration.  
GI findings 
In dog at ≥12 mg/kg/day, degeneration of the mucosa involving one or more segments of the small 
and large intestine, often accompanied by congestion and occasionally haemorrhage and sometimes by 
ulceration were noticed. Similarly, in monkey at ≥4 mg/kg/day histopathologic changes of mucosal 
atrophy in the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and large intestine (caecum, colon, rectum) 
were recorded. The findings in monkey were reversible after recovery.   
Additional findings 
The liver was identified as an additional organ for toxicity. This was manifested by decreased weight 
and hepatocyte vacuolation in rat, dog and monkey.   
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 26/134 
 
 
 
 
 
Also, cardiac atrial haemorrhage and necrosis (dog), acute inflammation in the kidneys (monkey), 
cervical epithelial atrophy (monkey) and decreased pancreatic zymogen granules (monkey) were 
recorded.  
In rat females administered 40 mg/kg/day, a decreased uterus weight was recorded.  
In addition, statistically significant organ weight differences compared to controls were present in the 
20- and/or 40-mg/kg/day male rats (decreased heart, kidney, pituitary, salivary gland) and in the 
recovery of the 20- and 40-mg/kg/day males (decreased liver) and 40-mg/kg/day males (increased 
spleen). However, these organ weight changes were not correlated with any histopathological changes.   
Toxicokinetics 
The NOAELs initially proposed in the application have in general been lowered during the CHMP 
assessment. Consequently the margins to patients are smaller than those proposed by the applicant, 
being close to the clinical exposure (1.7 to 3.5 time clinical exposure). The applicant was asked to 
clarify how the clinical AUC used for the calculation of exposure margins was derived. The applicant 
stated that the nonclinical exposure margins was calculated using the AUC and Cmax values (i.e. 
calculated AUC0-24 = 13.5 µg*h/mL and Cmax= 1.53 µg/mL) derived from the population 
pharmacokinetics (popPK), using patient data from clinical phase III studies (TETR-CSC-106) analysis. 
Consequently, the applicant has updated the exposure margins, which are reflected in the Xerava 
SmPC section 5.3.  
Genotoxicity 
Eravacycline was not genotoxic in any of the studies performed (Ames assay, mouse lymphoma assay, 
human peripheral lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay and a rat bone marrow micronucleus 
study). Exposure in the in vivo chromosomal aberration study is considered sufficient (up to 176 times 
the clinical based on Cmax) and distribution to the bone marrow was previously confirmed by the 
administration of radioactive eravacycline. The concentrations used in the in vitro studies were in some 
cases limited by cytotoxicity. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed for this application. CHMP considered this acceptable, in 
view of the short clinical duration of treatment (up to 14 days).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Fertility and early embryonic development were assessed in male and female rats. 
In the male fertility study, rats were administered i.v. bolus injections at dose levels of 0, 1, 4, 12, and 
16 mg/kg/day eravacycline beginning 70 days before cohabitation, during the cohabitation period, and 
continuing to the day before euthanasia or recovery. Effects on male fertility were observed at 12 
mg/kg/day (NOAEL 4 mg/kg/day). When male rats administered 12 mg/kg/day and higher were 
cohabited with females immediately after the treatment ended, the number of pregnancies was 
significantly reduced (number of pregnant females/number of mated females in 12 mg/kg/day: 1/24 
and 16 mg/kg/day: 0/24). Decreased sperm counts (cauda epididymal sperm count 178 in control and 
37 in 16 mg/kg/day), abnormal sperm morphology, and reduced sperm motility (vas deferens sperm 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 27/134 
 
 
 
 
 
motility in percent in control 92% and 30% in 16 mg/kg/day) were also observed, and testicular 
effects included abnormal retention of spermatids with Sertoli cells associated with a reduced presence 
of residual bodies within the cytoplasm of the Sertoli cells. These findings were reversible following a 
70-day (10-week) recovery period, equivalent to a spermatogenic cycle in the rat. The male toxicity 
and fertility NOAELs were 4 mg/kg/day eravacycline which gives a ~2 times human plasma exposure 
based on AUC. Toxicity to the male reproductive organs was also recorded in the repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rat.  
In contrast to male rats, there were no adverse effects on mating or fertility in female rats at any dose 
level (0, 4, 8, and 20 mg/kg/day). The 20-mg/kg/day dose was associated with reduced body weight 
gains during the first 2 weeks of dosing and during the gestation dosing period (GD 0 to GD 7). The 
reproductive toxicity NOAEL was >20 mg/kg/day. Plasma exposure based on AUC after 20 mg/kg/day 
is approximately 23 times the human plasma exposure. NOAEL for general toxicity was 8 mg/kg/day 
due to similar findings as discussed previously (swollen snout, limb and/or paws and reduced body 
weight). 
Embryo-foetal development 
The embryo-foetal developmental study in rats was conducted at 0, 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day. In 
addition, the metabolite TP6208 was included and administered at 3.5 mg/kg/day together with 
eravacycline. Maternal findings in the group administered 5 mg/kg/day eravacycline and 3.5 
mg/kg/day of the metabolite TP-6208 included reduced body weight and food consumption and 
observations of swollen snout, limbs/paws. Foetal body weight was reduced in the groups administered 
5 and 10 mg/kg/day eravacycline (5.61/5.28 g and 5.26/4.99 g M/F compared with the control group 
5.85/5.59 g). At this dose levels there was also a delay in skeletal ossification. NOAEL for both 
maternal and developmental toxicity was 3 mg/kg/day, with the addition of TP6208 3.5 mg/kg/day. 
The NOAEL dose corresponds to about two times the clinical exposure based on AUC. 
The embryo-foetal developmental study in rabbits was conducted at 0,1 ,2, and 4 mg/kg/day, with the 
dose-range study conducted at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 mg/kg/day. One female at 4 mg/kg/day aborted a litter 
of dead conceptues. Decreases in body weight and food consumption, ungroomed coat and pale heart 
and liver were noted in the does at 4 mg/kg/day. A 100% post-implantation loss was observed at 12 
mg/kg/day. The developmental toxicity in the 4 mg/kg/day group included an increased number of late 
resorptions (post-implantation loss 2.0% in control and 10.2% in 4 mg/kg/day), 1 dead foetus, 
reduced foetal body weight (-6.7% in 4 mg/kg/day group) and reduced number of ossified phalanges 
(ossification site averages in forelimb phalanges 13.89 in control and 13.72 in 4 mg/kg/day). 
Administration of 12 mg/kg/day in the dosage range finding study was associated with 100 % post-
implantation loss. The NOAEL for both maternal and developmental toxicity in this study was set at 2 
mg/kg/day (approximately 3.7 fold the clinical exposure based on AUC). 
Pre- and postnatal development 
The potential effects of eravacycline on development, growth, behaviour, reproductive performance, 
and fertility of F1 generation were evaluated in rats after administration of 0, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day to 
F0 females from gestation day 7 through Day 20 postpartum. Furthermore the F1 pups were 
investigated for cohabitation on post-natal day 90. The NOAEL for general toxicity in the F0 generation 
was 5 mg/kg/day, the NOAEL for the reproductive toxicity was 10 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for toxicity 
and reproduction in the F1 generation and the F2 foetuses was 10 mg/kg/day.  
On lactation day 15, eravacycline and the metabolites TP-498 and TP-6208 were measured in pooled 
milk. The concentration of TP-434 from the dose groups 3, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day was 11.5, 13.5, and 
32.8 µg/mL.

Juvenile toxicity studies  
The potential toxicity of eravacycline was assessed in two studies in juvenile rats. In the first study (a 
dosage range finding study), eravacycline was administered during 14 days, starting at 21 days of age. 
In the other study, eravacycline was administered for 50 days, starting at 21 days of age. In the 
second study the animals were followed post-dose (males approximately 100 days and females 48 
days). The reproductive toxicity previously discussed in male animals was also observed in this study. 
The fertility index in the male animals was reduced, and remained after a 4-weeks recovery period but 
recovered after 10 weeks. 
It was not possible to establish a NOAEL in juvenile rats in this study. At the low dose (4 mg/kg/h) 
histopathological findings such as reduced lymphoid cellularity and number and size of germinal 
centres in the mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, hepatocellular vacuolation, and inflammation 
at the injection site was observed. At higher doses, histopathologic effects were also observed in 
testes, epididymides, spleen, and thymus. Alterations were also observed on some other investigated 
parameters. 
Yellow discoloration of the calvaria and/or femurs, was observed in the ≥20 mg/kg/day group. The 
colouring did not resolve during the recovery period. This effect is a known class effect of tetracyclines 
and should be taken into consideration when children are treated and also in respect when breast-
feeding women are going to be treated since eravacycline is transported to the milk in rats. 
Summary/discussion 
The applicant has presented a complete developmental and reproductive toxicology (DART) 
programme, including juvenile toxicity studies. The effects on the male reproductive system and bone 
discoloration were also observed in the repeat dose toxicity studies. In general, no new toxicity was 
detected in the juvenile toxicity in comparison to the data generated in adult animals. Since no NOAEL 
could be established in juvenile rats, it could be speculated that juvenile animals may be more prone 
for eravacycline induced toxicity, but a definite comparison is hard to perform on the available data.     
Local Tolerance  
In a dedicated local tolerance study, there were no differences in inflammatory changes at the injection 
site that were related to the concentration or rate of infusion of eravacycline. 
Local tolerance was also evaluated in the pivotal repeat-dose i.v. toxicity studies by both gross and 
microscopic assessment of the injection sites. Injection site findings were observed following i.v. 
administration, specifically at higher concentrations of eravacycline, when a catheter or vascular access 
port was not utilised for the administration procedures (i.e., in the rat and shorter duration non-rodent 
studies). 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunotoxic effects have been observed in both the KLH study and in the repeat-dose toxicity studies 
in rats, dogs and monkeys. A decrease in anti-KLH IgG antibody was observed in the 8-mg/kg/day 
males and females.  The decrease in anti-KLH IgG antibody levels correlated microscopically with 
lymphoid depletion in the spleen, mandibular lymph nodes, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Findings 
seen in repeat-dose studies in rats, dogs and monkeys included decreased white blood cell parameter 
indices that correlated with changes in spleen and/or thymus organ weights and the microscopic 
Assessment report

finding of bone marrow and/or lymphoid tissue atrophy. At the end of the recovery period, all immune-
toxic effects had resolved in rats, but not in dogs and monkeys, where some of the immune 
parameters had only partially recovered (white blood cell count and immune organ weight). 
The applicant argued that there was no evidence of immune-toxic effects (leukopenia, neutropenia, 
lymphopenia, haematology values) in the clinical development programme in eravacycline-treated 
subjects, and that the lymphoid findings can be monitored in the clinic and are generally reversible. 
The safety margins calculated across species and repeat dose toxicity studies are low (0.84-14, AUC0-
24); this was considered acceptable by CHMP, considering that any findings can be monitored in the 
clinic and that they are in general reversible. The applicant also clarified that no immunotoxic effects 
have been observed in the clinical trial programme and the safety of potentially vulnerable patients is 
considered taken care of. 
Phototoxicity 
In an in vivo study in pigmented rats, repeated i.v. administrations of 40 mg/kg/day eravacycline were 
not phototoxic. 
Effect on mitochondrial protein synthesis 
Several antibiotics, such as linezolid, have showed toxicity related to impaired eukaryotic mitochondrial 
protein synthesis linked mechanistically to mitochondrial protein synthesis (MPS) inhibition. The 
mechanism of action of eravacycline involves the disruption of bacterial protein synthesis. The 
potential effect of eravacycline on mitochondrial protein synthesis was therefore investigated in a 
mitochondrial toxicity specific assay using tetracycline and linezolid as comparators. 
In this assay, eravacycline was found to inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis with an IC50 value of 
1.4 µM. Eravacycline was more potent than tetracycline and linezolid with IC50 values of > 10 and 10 
µM, respectively. According to the applicant, the relevance of inhibition of mitochondrial protein 
synthesis is uncertain, since there are no clear signs of mitochondrial toxicity in the non-clinical and 
clinical studies. Six cardinal recognised toxicities were according to the applicant attributed to 
mitochondrial dysfunction (1. hepatitis and steatosis, 2. cardiomyopathy, 3. skeletal muscle injury, 4. 
peripheral neuropathy, retinal toxicity and ototoxicity, 5. lipodystrophy, 6. renal tubular failure). No 
recognised mitochondrial toxicities were discovered in the animal studies or in the clinical studies with 
eravacycline.  
Metabolites 
The three human major metabolites of eravacycline TP-498 (also present as a specified impurity), TP-
6208, and TP-034 (also present as a specified impurity) were qualified through their presence in the 
eravacycline batches used for the general toxicity, genotoxicity, or reproductive and developmental 
toxicity studies, or through specific studies (in vitro and/or in vivo) with the individual compounds.  
In general the data generated by the applicant on the exposure of the various metabolites in patients 
in relation to the exposure of the same metabolites in the non-clinical safety studies (both eravacycline 
and dedicated metabolite studies) do not indicate any additional risks associated with metabolite 
exposure at or above clinical exposure. Consequently the major human metabolites are considered to 
the qualified from a non-clinical point of view.   
Impurities  
An assessment regarding the qualification of impurities TP-498, TP-034, TP-630, TP-5799, TP-6773 
and TP-4705, TP-9944 and TP-4308 (process impurities, degradation products, intermediates, or 
starting materials) has been conducted based on their presence in the eravacycline batches used for 
Assessment report

the general toxicity, genotoxicity, or reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, or through 
specific studies (in vitro or in vivo). In addition, computational risk assessments have been completed 
for the same impurities. CHMP agreed that in essence the impurities can be considered as safe and 
qualified up to the set specifications.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A Phase I exposure assessment indicated the PECSURFACEWATER exceeded the action limit of 0.01 μg/L. 
Therefore, a Phase II Tier A assessment was triggered. 
The octanol-water partition coefficient (log D OW) of eravacycline at pH 4-9 ranged from -1.395 to 1.33. 
At physiological pH, the log DOW is below 3, therefore the screening criterion for classification for 
bioaccumulation is not met. Eravacycline is not considered as PBT substance. 
The PEC/PNECSW ratio (0.7/0.0413 µg/L) for aquatic organisms was above the threshold of 1, thus 
indicating a potential risk of eravacycline to the aquatic compartment. The applicant was therefore 
asked to refine the PECSW value or else this concern for the product should lead to information in the 
Xerava SmPC on how to dispose of the medicine to protect the environment. The applicant suggested 
to revise the PECSW based on the treatment regime and re-calculated the maximum daily dose over a 
total treatment duration of 14 days in one year (i.e. total 1960 mg in 14 days / 365 days = 5.37 
mg/day). This strategy to revise the PECS W was not considered acceptable by CHMP, as refinement of 
data in Phase I should take in consideration the worst-case treatment regime and worst-case number 
of treatment days per year. Therefore, information relating to the possible effects of eravacycline in 
the aquatic environment was included in sections 5.3 and 6.6 of the Xerava SmPC and correspondingly 
in the PL. 
The PEC/PNEC ratio for groundwater was below the threshold of 1. 
The PEC/PNEC ratio for micro-organisms was below the threshold of 0.1. 
The preliminary RCR calculated for surface water was based on a PNEC from a study conducted using 
P. subcapitata as test species. According to Question 11 in the EMA ERA Questions & Answers 
document (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1), blue-green algae is the recommended test species 
for testing antimicrobials on algae. Thus, a repeat study for the algae (blue-green) growth inhibition 
test (OECD 201) has been reported. 
Further testing of the environmental fate of eravacycline (ready biodegradability, 
adsorption/desorption and aerobic degradation in surface water systems) is also currently being 
planned. The data from these studies as well as the ecotoxicological data will be used to update the 
aquatic risk assessment presented in this report. The refinement of the exposure of surface water 
species will be proposed which could include further testing and/or using a statistical extrapolation 
technique (Species Sensitivity Distributions - SSD) to derive a refined PNEC (which in this case is the 
concentration at which 95% of the species theoretically are protected (HC5)) and/or modelling the fate 
of eravacycline in a sewage treatment plant using the Simple Treat Model. 
With regard to the risk to sewage sludge micro-organisms, the data could not be fully assessed. The 
NOEC for the most sensitive endpoint heterotrophic respiration could not be established, as the value 
was lower than 0.5 mg/L. Furthermore, the EC50 of 3 mg/L of the reference substance was outside the 
acceptable range of 5 mg/L to 40 mg/L and hence, the initial study was considered as non-valid. 
Therefore, the applicant has provided a new respiration inhibition test according to OECD 209. 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 31/134 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, the applicant was initially asked to discuss potential explanations for the strong decrease 
of test substance concentration during the ecotoxicological tests, despite the suspected stability and 
moderate logKOW of eravacycline.  
The PNECs for algae and daphnids stated in the ERA were miscalculated by a factor of 10. For the RQ 
calculation, the correct values were applied.  
The OECD 210 was conducted in vessels of inadequate size and the measured test concentrations 
exceeded the nominal by up to 292 %, leading to highly variable exposure. In addition, the test was 
conducted with embryos that were too far developed, and therefore the embryos were possibly not 
exposed to the test substance. Due to animal welfare reasons and since algae reacted with much 
higher sensitivity than fish, CHMP decided not to ask for a new study on fish.

2018. Pending the outcome of the study of aerobic / anaerobic transformation in aquatic sediment 
systems (OECD 308), a further sediment-water chironomid toxicity study (OECD 218) may be needed. 
A final ERA report, including the report for the potential OECD 218 study (if triggered) should be 
submitted by the end of Q3 2019.  Adequate wording pertaining to the measures for disposal of the 
medicinal product to protect the environment was included in sections 5.3 and 6.6 of the Xerava SmPC

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Eravacycline belongs to the tetracycline class of antibiotics and has an in vitro activity against several 
bacterial organisms. Eravacycline differs from other tetracyclines based on modifications at C-7 
(fluorine atom) and C-9 (pyrrolidinoacetamido group) on the phenyl ring. These modifications confer 
increased activity and stability against tetracycline-specific efflux and resistance due to ribosomal 
protection proteins (RPP). The in vitro primary pharmacodynamics studies are presented and assessed 
in more detail in the clinical section of the assessment report.  
Safety pharmacology 
The potential of eravacycline to alter cardiovascular, respiratory system and CNS was examined as part 
of the safety pharmacology dossier provided by the applicant. The administration of eravacycline 15 
and 30 mg/kg caused increases in heart rate and blood pressure associated with quantitative changes 
in ECG intervals, namely shortenings of the PR and QT intervals in dog. The symptoms were suggested 
to be associated with acute histamine-release, which in turn have been suggested to be more 
pronounced in rats and dogs than in humans. Consequently, it was not possible to conclude from this 
study whether eravacycline can cause a QT prolongation. A dose-dependent increase in respiratory 
rate was observed during the dosing and 30-60 min after the infusion. Clinical observations of laboured 
breathing, swelling, and skin erythema and changes in CNS activity and excitability (including 
reduction in rearing counts and activity/arousal and instances of muscle fasciculation) and effects on 
the ANS, sensorimotor system, neuromuscular system (including ataxia and gait pattern 
abnormalities), and decreased body temperature were noticed.  
In the safety pharmacology and toxicology studies, indications on an altered thermoregulation were 
observed. In the off-target pharmacology study inhibitory effects of eravacycline on 
acetylcholinesterase were observed. Regulation of body temperature has been shown to be affected by 
inhibition of acetylcholine esterase. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that the observed fluctuations in 
body temperature are indirectly due to histamine effects, as claimed by the applicant. However, in the 
clinical safety data base there are no indications on thermoregulatory effects of eravacycline at 
clinically relevant doses. Consequently, while a thermoregulative effect of eravacycline cannot be ruled 
out, the clinical relevance is however considered limited by CHMP. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Following intravenous injection, exposure (Cmax and AUC) to eravacycline increased with increasing 
doses. This increase was generally greater than proportional to the increase in dose, and systemic 
clearance and volume of distribution decreased with increasing doses in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus 
monkeys.  
Eravacycline has an atypical form of protein binding in the plasma of all tested species, where the free 
fraction of eravacycline has been shown in vitro to decrease with increasing concentration of the active 
substance. In addition, the free fraction of eravacycline vary significantly between species in vitro, 
ranging from 49% in mice to 5.3% in cynomolgus monkeys when using a concentration of 0.1 µg/ml. 
The applicant was asked by CHMP to discuss the mechanisms for the variable protein binding of 
eravacycline when using different pools of human plasma. The atypical nonlinear protein binding 
behaviour of several of the tetracyclines, including eravacycline and doxycycline, may be related to a 
complex interaction between the agent, metal ions and plasma proteins, but is currently not 
understood. Due to this lack of knowledge the applicant cannot point to a particular reason for the high 
variability in protein binding between the different lots of pooled human plasma, and a clear 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 35/134 
 
 
 
 
 
mechanism could not be presented. However, since this is a class effect that is manageable in the 
clinic, the response was considered sufficient by CHMP. 
The distribution of radiolabelled eravacycline was rapid, widespread and concentrated in the trachea, 
adrenal gland, liver, and aorta.  Radioactivity was generally BLQ 21 days post-dose, with the exception 
of the uveal tract, bone (including teeth and tracheal hyaline cartilage), thyroid, aorta, bone marrow 
and pigmented fur. Distribution to melanin-containing structures had high exposure to radiolabelled 
material and a slow elimination. Given the lack of ocular adverse effects in the non-clinical toxicology 
studies or in the clinic, the binding of eravacycline to melanin does not appear to be associated with 
any obvious risk for ocular toxicity in patients. Eravacycline passed the placental barrier in rats and 
rabbits. Foetal plasma concentrations were in the same range of maternal drug plasma concentrations. 
Unchanged eravacycline is the major drug-related component in rat, dog and human plasma and urine 
after a single IV dose. Qualitatively similar metabolites are found in the plasma of humans, rats and 
dogs. The metabolic turnover of eravacycline is, however, very slow, with negligible loss. The 
metabolites of eravacycline were identified in plasma from rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey, and human. 
The exposure to metabolites (especially TP-6208 and TP-034) was low in animals compared to 
humans. In order to reach adequate plasma concentrations in the toxicology studies, the human 
metabolites TP-6208 and TP-034, were dosed to animals in some of the toxicology studies in order to 
qualify them adequately. 
Eravacycline has faecal and/or biliary elimination and a somewhat smaller fraction is eliminated into 
urine. 
Toxicology 
The following target organs of toxicity have been identified: cardiovascular (increase in heart rate and 
blood pressure, and cardiac atrial haemorrhage and necrosis), lymphoid and bone marrow systems, 
the male reproductive system (including a decrease in fertility), bone, administration site and GI 
systems. In general the applicant claims that many of these effects (GI, haematopoietic, reproductive, 
immunological and cardiovascular systems) are due to histamine release (which was not measured in 
any of the i.v. studies performed by the applicant) in rat and dog, which is a known class effect of 
tetracyclines and that this toxicity is not relevant to humans. To substantiate this claim, the applicant 
mainly refers to the approved medicine tigecycline, which it claims has a very similar toxicity profile. In 
general, tetracycline class effects are expected also for eravacycline and even though no mechanistic 
explanation as to why histamine-release seems to be induced only in non-human species, any safety 
concerns in regard to histamine-release were considered by CHMP to be irrelevant to humans.   
Male fertility was decreased in rat after administration of eravacycline. Eravacycline did also induce 
maternal and foetal toxicity in rat. In mothers eravacycline administration gave reduced body weights 
and food consumption. In the foetal offspring eravacycline exposure resulted in reduced body weight 
and a delay in skeletal ossification. Also in rabbit similar maternal and foetal toxicity was observed.  
In general, no new toxicity was detected in the juvenile toxicity in comparison to the data generated in 
adult animals. However, since no NOAEL could be established in juvenile rat it could be speculated that 
juvenile animals are more prone for eravacycline induced toxicity, but a definite comparison is hard to 
perform on the available data. 
The ERA is not finalised and will be re-assessed upon submission of the ongoing studies OECD 106 and 
OECD 308.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Eravacycline is a new chemical entity and therefore a full pharmacokinetic documentation was required 
and was submitted by the applicant for CHMP assessment. The clinical pharmacology has been 
investigated in both healthy volunteers and in patients. 
The clinical pharmacology package consists of 9 clinical studies, as per the previous table. In addition, 
approximately 20 in vitro studies using human biomaterial were submitted. PK and PK/PD was 
investigated in phase II/III studies and were reported separately. 
•  Analytical methods 
The bioanalytical methods for the measurement of eravacycline and metabolites (TP-6208, TP-498 and 
TP-034) concentrations in human plasma and urine were based on deuterium labelled internal 
standards and LC/MS/MS. The sample preparation was protein precipitation or solid phase extraction. 
All methods were validated.  
• 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Standard statistical methods and non-compartmental methods were used to characterise the 
pharmacokinetics. Population PK analysis was characterised by non-linear mixed effects modelling. 
Absorption  
Not applicable, as Xerava is administered intravenously as a 60 min infusion.

Distribution 
Eravacycline is moderately bound to plasma proteins and is concentration-dependent based on in vitro 
data. Using equilibrium dialysis the unbound fraction were 32%, 27%, 25%, 23% and 13% at 0.1, 0.5, 
1, 5, and 10 µg/mL, respectively. The mean whole blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was 
approximately 1. In the population PK analysis in patients for a typical subject Vc and Vss were 39 L 
and 226 L, respectively. 
Elimination 
For eravacycline, from the population PK analysis the CL for a typical patient was 15 L/hr, and 
elimination half-life was calculated to be 15 h. In healthy subjects, calculated using non-
compartmental analysis, the CL was similar to that in patients. The plasma concentration after end of 
infusion declined in a multiphasic manner (see Figure PK2) and the terminal half-life at steady state 
was approximately 30 h. The difference in terminal half-lives between patients and healthy subjects is 
likely due to different sampling schemes and is generally less precise in patients due to sparse plasma 
sampling scheme.      
o  Excretion 
In the human mass balance study following a single IV dose of [14C]Eravacycline of 60 mg, the mean 
cumulative urinary and faecal recovery was 83%. The mean recovery of radioactivity in faeces and 
urine was 48 % and 35%, respectively. Parent compound was the major compound found in faeces 
and urine, accounting for on average 40% (~20% in each excreta) of the administered dose. Based on 
the human mass balance study the major elimination pathway was excretion of parent compound via 
kidney, bile and most likely also via direct intestinal secretion. 
o  Metabolism 
Eravacycline was relatively stable when incubated in human hepatocytes. In the human ADME study 
most (60-70%) of the total circulating radioactivity (AUC0-24) in pooled plasma samples was attributed 
to [14C]eravacycline. Three metabolites were identified in plasma (for structures see following figure);  
TP-6208 accounted for ~18% of total radioactivity (AUC0-24) in plasma. Both in vitro and in vivo DDI 
data support that CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of TP-6208. Other circulating metabolites in 
plasma TP-498 and TP-034 were minor (<10% each).  
Several metabolites were identified in urine and in faeces; the main metabolites were TP-6208 (initial 
N-oxidation in the pyrrolidine ring followed by a cyclisation to form a bicyclic ring system) and TP-498 
(epimer at carbon-4). TP-6208/TP-498 co-eluted and accounted for ~13% of dose. Oxidation in the 
pyrrolidine ring formed additional metabolites (M572a/b, M590a/b, ~12% of dose in excreta). Minor 
metabolites were conjugation with glucuronic acid (M734a/b, ~2% of dose) and formation of TP-034 
(~3% of dose, for structures see following figure).

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality was studied in healthy subjects. At steady state the exposure in terms of AUC0-24 
and Cmax increased approximately in a dose proportional manner over the 0.5 to 1.5 mg/kg range. 
Steady state was generally reached at day 5 and the accumulation ratio (AUCTau day 10 /AUCinf day1) 
was 1.6 (1.0 mg/kg every 12 hours). The following figure shows the mean plasma profiles of 
eravacycline.

Population PK analysis 
The population PK model includes a wide range of PK data from 15 clinical studies, including seven 
Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, one study in subjects with hepatic impairment, one study in 
subjects with ESRD, two DDI studies, one Phase 2 study and two Phase 3 studies in patients with cIAI, 
and one phase 3 study in patients with cUTI. The population PK model is considered adequate by CHMP 
to describe data and simulation of AUC. 
• 
Pharmacokinetic in target population 
The model derived PK parameters for phase 3 is shown in the following table:

Single dose (1.5 mg/kg during 60 min infusion) PK of eravacycline was investigated in subjects with 
mild, moderate and severe hepatic impairment (HI) compared to subjects with normal hepatic 
function. For the total plasma concentration, the systemic exposure (AUC) of eravacycline was slightly 
increased in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (point estimate 123% and 138%, 
respectively and 90% CI (84, 180) and (96, 198)) compared to healthy subjects. In severe hepatically 
impaired subjects the increase was ca. 2-fold (PE 210 90% CI (149-297). Cmax was in general 
unaffected in all degrees of hepatic impairment. The half-life was prolonged in subjects with HI (21-26 
h) compared to healthy subjects (16 h).  
o  Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of eravacycline was studied after a single dose (1.5 mg/kg during 60 min 
infusion) in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) compared to subjects with normal renal 
function. For subjects with ESRD eravacycline was given on a day when the subject did not receive 
dialysis. The exposure (AUC and Cmax) of eravacycline was approximately similar in the subjects with 
ESRD as compared to subjects with normal renal function.  
Age, sex, race 
Sex was included as a covariate in the updated population PK model, but age, sex and race are not 
expected to have a clinically relevant effect on eravacycline PK. 
o  Body weight 
Body weight based allometric scaling on clearance and volume was included in the updated population 
PK model. Eravacycline dosing regimen is body weight based and this has been shown to be adequate. 
No patients above 137 kg have been studied.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Effects of other medical products on the pharmacokinetics of eravacycline  
In vitro data indicate that eravacycline is a substrate of CYP3A4 and this was confirmed in vivo as the 
major metabolic pathway forming TP-6208. No other CYP enzyme was indicated to be involved in the 
metabolism. Other enzymes were investigated in vitro and flavin monooxygenases (FMO-1, -3, -5) was 
shown to form TP-6208, while aldehyde oxidase (AO) and monoamine oxidases (MAO-A, MAO-B) were 
not involved in the metabolism of eravacycline.  
An in vivo study with itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) showed an increase of 
eravacycline exposure in terms of AUC0-inf when co-administrated with itraconazole (point estimate 
1.45) while Cmax was unchanged. The epimer TP-498 behaved in a similar manner as parent 
compound, while TP-6208 and TP-034 decreased considerably, a decrease by 60-70% for both AUC0-t 
and Cmax was observed. When co-administrating with a strong inducer (rifampicin) the exposure in 
terms of AUC decreased by ca. 30% while Cmax was unchanged. The epimer TP-498 behaved in a 
similar manner as parent compound, while TP-6208 and TP-034 increased considerably; Cmax approx. 
2-fold and AUC0-t ca 1.4-1.5-fold for both metabolites. 
In vitro, eravacycline was shown to be a P-gp, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, but not a BCRP substrate.  
Effect of eravacycline on the PK of other medical products  
The potential of eravacycline and its metabolites TP-6208, TP-498 and TP-034 to inhibit CYP enzymes 
have been investigated in vitro in a clinically relevant concentration range. No signal of direct or time

dependent CYP inhibition (CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4) was observed. The potential of 
eravacycline and its metabolite TP-6208 to induce CYP enzymes was investigated in vitro and no signal 
of CYP induction was detected. 
In vitro, eravacycline and its metabolites TP-6208, TP-498 and TP-034 did not inhibit P-gp, BCRP, 
BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 or MATE2-K transporters.   
The risk of clinically relevant DDIs caused by eravacycline or its metabolites TP-6208, TP-498 and  
TP-034 is considered to be low. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Eravacycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, thus 
preventing the incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains.

There was no evidence of cross-resistance with other evaluated agents, based on the lack of isolates 
with elevated eravacycline MICs observed during surveillance and consistent activity by MIC50 and 
MIC90 against isolates resistant to other classes of agents relative to susceptible isolates. 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 46/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on MBC and time-kill studies eravacycline was bacteriostatic against the majority of evaluated 
pathogens. 
Antimicrobial activity of metabolites 
Of the primary metabolites, TP-6208 was inactive against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates 
tested (MICs > 32 mg/L). TP-498 and TP-034 were active, though the activity observed was generally 
less than that of eravacycline. 
Resistance 
Resistance to tetracyclines is usually attributed to the acquisition of mobile genetic elements carrying 
tetracycline-specific resistance genes, mutations within the ribosomal binding site, and/or 
chromosomal mutations leading to increased expression of intrinsic resistance mechanisms (e.g. 
multidrug efflux pumps). 
The activity of eravacycline was minimally affected by the recombinant expression of major 
tetracycline-specific resistance genes (tet(A), tet(B), tet(K), tet(M)) in an isogenic E. coli background. 
The MIC of eravacycline increased from 0.06 to 4 μg/mL in E. coli expressing tet(X). Eravacycline 
activity in vitro was more variable in panels of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii clinical isolates 
carrying tet(A) or tet(B); E. coli and K. pneumoniae containing tet(D); and S. aureus carrying tet(K) or 
tet(M), suggesting differences in strain background and the existence of other antibiotic resistance 
determinants likely impact susceptibility to eravacycline in these organisms. Eravacycline activity 
against B. fragilis clinical isolates did not directly correlate with the presence of tet(Q) or tet(X), nor 
did it directly correlate with the tigecycline and minocycline activities against B. fragilis, suggesting 
that there may be other genes responsible for the differential activity against these three antibiotics.  
Similar to many other antibiotics of different classes, susceptibility to eravacycline is reduced by 
intrinsic MDR mechanisms regulated by ramA in K. pneumoniae. Eravacycline appears to be a 
substrate for the AdeAB pump in A. baumannii, several Mex pumps in P. aeruginosa, and is a poorer 
substrate for MepA in S. aureus. The activities of eravacycline and other tetracyclines are also 
impacted by target-based mutations in 16S rRNA and mutations in rpsJ, encoding amino acid 
variations in 30S ribosomal protein S10 near the tetracycline-binding site. 
Laboratory selection of resistance 
Eravacycline resistance development was evaluated in vitro using both spontaneous mutation 
frequency and serial passage methods with E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, A. baumannii, 
Bacteroides spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and S. aureus. Laboratory-derived 
eravacycline mutants underwent broth microdilution susceptibility testing for a variety of antimicrobial 
agents and were genetically characterised to provide insight into the mechanism of resistance and 
potential cross-resistance. 
Spontaneous mutation frequency values for eravacycline were low and comparable to tigecycline for 
most of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates tested. Despite the relatively infrequent 
isolation of eravacycline mutants among Gram-positive organisms, those that were isolated provided 
some insight into potential cross-resistance and mechanism of resistance. There was no evidence of 
cross-resistance to linezolid, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, or daptomycin for eravacycline-selected 
mutants. As expected, eravacycline-selected mutants had reduced susceptibility to tigecycline and vice 
versa, showing the potential for cross-resistance between these two agents. Cross-resistance for other 
members of the tetracycline class (doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline) was also common in 
instances where the parent isolate was susceptible and cross-resistance to these agents could be 
evaluated.

MIC data from the eravacycline mutants of K. pneumoniae, C. freundii and A. baumannii showed cross-
resistance to tigecycline and other members of the tetracycline class (doxycycline, minocycline, 
tetracycline) in instances where the parent isolate was susceptible and cross-resistance to these agents 
could be evaluated. Cross-resistance observed with the eravacycline-selected mutants for other agents 
varied. There was apparent cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin (K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii), and to 
gentamicin for select mutants of A. baumannii. 
Eravacycline and multiple comparator agents were evaluated for resistance development following 15 
to 20 serial transfers in sub-inhibitory concentrations of each test agent. There was no significant 
increase in MICs for either eravacycline or tigecycline for the Gram-positive organisms S. aureus (2 
strains), Enterococcus faecalis or Streptococcus pyogenes. Significant increases in eravacycline MIC 
values were observed for the two Gram-negative organisms evaluated. For E. coli (lon or marA 
mutations), the MIC of eravacycline increased 16-fold, while the MIC of tigecycline varied only 2-fold. 
For K. pneumoniae, MIC increases for both eravacycline and tigecycline were observed early during 
passage, with significant increases resulting for both agents by the end of the study (ramR mutations). 
For B. fragilis, eravacycline MIC values increased during serial passage but the increase in MIC was not 
confirmed by broth microdilution MIC testing, indicating no true emergence of resistance for 
eravacycline and B. fragilis. 
The genetic characterisation data showed that the primary mechanism of resistance among the 
evaluated eravacycline mutants was mutation of genes involved in the expression of multidrug efflux 
pumps in gram-negative bacteria and mutations in rpsJ in gram-positive bacteria. 
Post-antibiotic effect 
A post-antibiotic effect was noted and ranged from 1 to 4 hours for Gram-positive bacteria and 1 to 2 
hours for Gram-negative bacteria, depending on the species and on the extent of exposure (2x to 10x 
the MIC). 
Effects of human body fluids on susceptibility to eravacycline 
The in vitro activity of eravacycline and tigecycline in the presence and absence of 5% and 10% pooled 
normal human serum and urine was evaluated. 
With the exception of Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, where eravacycline MICs were 4-fold higher 
in medium containing 5% to 10% human serum than in medium without serum, eravacycline MICs in 
medium containing human serum were identical to, or within 2-fold of, those observed in the absence 
of serum. 
Eravacycline and tigecycline MICs were typically 2- to 8-fold higher in urine relative to broth for both E. 
coli and K. pneumoniae. The MICs of both agents were typically 2- to 4-fold higher when testing in 
broth or urine adjusted to the same pH and increased with decreasing pH of the test medium. Thus, 
both pH of test medium and testing in urine have an impact on the in vitro activity of eravacycline and 
tigecycline against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. 
In vivo activity 
Eravacycline evaluated in various animal infection models 
Eravacycline was evaluated in several non-clinical efficacy models of serious hospital- and community-
acquired infections. These experimental infections included systemic lethal infections, kidney 
infections, thigh infections and lung infections in mice, and a rat intra-abdominal abscess model. These 
studies evaluated the efficacy of eravacycline against Gram-positive or Gram-negative pathogens 
including E. coli (tetracycline-resistant and ESBL producing strains), K. pneumoniae (ESBL strains), S. 
Assessment report

aureus (methicillin- and tetracycline-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus 
pneumoniae (tetracycline-resistant strain), and B. fragilis. One of the experimental infection models, 
the intra-abdominal abscess, was a polymicrobial infection. 
The efficacy of eravacycline was compared with appropriate agents for the relevant clinical indication 
such as tigecycline, ertapenem or meropenem, levofloxacin, doxycycline, linezolid, and vancomycin.  
Non-clinical efficacy evaluations of eravacycline required i.v. or intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration to 
ensure adequate exposure. 
Overall, eravacycline was efficacious in the non-clinical models used, except in the rat intra-abdominal 
abscess model. Although eravacycline exhibited good potency in vitro against the E. coli and B. fragilis 
isolates used in the model; 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg BID regimens of eravacycline administered in vivo did 
not show a significant reduction in CFU/abscess in vivo when compared to the untreated controls. The 
applicant has been unable to explain the reason why eravacycline failed to reduce the bacterial burden. 
A complicating factor for the analysis was that no dosing solution or plasma PK analysis was completed 
as part of the study. Therefore the exposures associated with treatment in this study are unknown. 
Non-clinical PK/PD of eravacycline 
The pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of eravacycline was investigated in an in vitro 
chemostat system and in murine thigh infection models. 
In vitro 
An in vitro dynamic chemostat system was utilised to identify the PK/PD index closest associated with 
efficacy of eravacycline against E. coli and to determine the magnitude of the PK/PD index associated 
with the efficacy of eravacycline using a multiple E. coli isolate challenge panel. Eravacycline free-drug 
AUC0-24:MIC ratio was considered the PK/PD index most associated with the change in bacterial density 
of E. coli based on the coefficient of determination and dispersion of data across the fitted line (see 
following figure).

Across five E. coli challenge isolates including the reference strain above, the magnitude of 
eravacycline free-drug AUC0-24:MIC ratio associated with net bacterial stasis and 1- and 2-log 10 CFU 
reductions from baseline was 15.3, 20.5, and 28.8, respectively (see following figure).

Eight isolates of Enterobacteriaceae spp. exhibiting various resistance mechanisms were selected for 
study in an immunocompetent mouse thigh model. The mean free AUC/MIC magnitudes required for a

respectively.

Two separate studies were performed in the neutropenic thigh model with three E. coli isolates to 
assess the fAUC/MIC magnitudes associated with efficacy. In the first study, the mean free AUC/MIC 
magnitudes required for a net static response was 16.1 ± 5.2. In the second study, the same E.coli 
isolates were repeated together with three additional isolates, and eravacycline was administered q12h 
i.p. starting at 2 h post-infection. The mean free AUC/MIC magnitudes required for a net static 
response and a 1-log 10 reduction for the six isolates were 28.0 ± 8.3 and 32.6 ± 10.8, respectively

The correlation between efficacy and the PK/PD indices of AUC/MIC, Cmax/MIC, and percent of a dosage 
interval in which the serum drug concentration remains above the MIC (%T>MIC) were determined 
using a sigmoidal Emax model. The analysis showed that AUC/MIC is the PK/PD index best associated 
with efficacy based upon data fit and the coefficient of determination (R2) values (see following figure).

Susceptibility testing breakpoints 
The applicant has approached the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing 
(EUCAST) to set breakpoints.

It is noted that these data should be considered in relation to the clinical efficacy data. CHMP 
considered that clinical efficacy has been established for Xerava in cIAI for E. coli, viridans 
Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella 
pneumoniae. 
Antimicrobial interactions 
The antimicrobial interaction of eravacycline with other agents for aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria and for B. fragilis was found to be indifferent for nearly all antibiotic combinations 
and bacteria evaluated in checkerboard titration studies. 
Support for dose selection 
The proposed eravacycline dose regimen for cIAI is 1.0 mg/kg q12h for 4 to 14 days. Following phase 
1 studies with i.v. eravacycline, two dose regimens were selected for evaluation in phase 2 (1.5 mg/kg 
q24h and 1.0 mg/kg q12h). These doses were selected because they had shown acceptable tolerability 
as compared to higher doses, at which nausea and vomiting were the main limiting effects.  
The selection of the dose regimen for the Phase 3 studies was based on the strength of the clinical 
response observed in the Phase 2 study in cIAI, on the comparable outcomes obtained with both the 
1.0 mg/kg q12h and the 1.5 mg/kg q24h regimens, and on PK/PD analyses of data from the Phase 2 
study to determine the likelihood of clinical success and target attainment. The average predicted 
percentage probability of clinical success was 98.0% across the MIC distribution for all E. coli isolates 
for the 1.0 mg/kg q12h regimen, and 97.3% for the 1.5 mg/kg q24h regimen. Although neither the 
clinical and microbiological outcomes, nor the safety and tolerability profiles seen in the Phase 2 study 
clearly differentiated between the two dose regimens of eravacycline used, because clinical cure rates 
with the 1.0 mg/kg q12h regimen were numerically higher, this dose was selected for the Phase 3 
study. Consideration was given to the convenience of the 1.5 mg/kg q24h regimen; however, since it 
was expected that most cIAI patients would remain in hospital over the therapeutic course, this was 
not a critical deciding factor. There was also a lower incidence of adverse events (AEs) at the 1.0 
mg/kg q12h dose of eravacycline. 
The phase 3 studies validated the selection of this dose regimen: eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg q12h was 
found to produce high clinical cure rates and was shown to be non-inferior to the comparators 
ertapenem and meropenem for the co-primary endpoints of clinical response in the modified Intent to 
Treat (MITT) and clinically evaluable (CE) populations. 
The microbiological responses for each patient treated with eravacycline in the Phase 3 studies for cIAI 
were pooled and assessed by pathogen and then by the eravacycline MIC (see following table). With all 
of the pathogens, there was no trend towards a decrease in a favourable response with increasing 
eravacycline MIC. For A. baumannii and all Enterobacteriaceae with the exception of E. coli and K.

pneumoniae, the clinical cut-offs for eravacycline were at the breakpoint initially suggested by the 
applicant of 1 μg/mL. For S. aureus, all streptococci and both species of Enterococcus spp., the clinical 
cut-offs were ≤ 0.5 μg/mL. The clinical cut-offs for anaerobes included isolates with MIC values up to 4 
μg/mL.

Probability of target attainment based on non-clinical PK/PD targets 
A population PK model and non-clinical PK/PD targets for efficacy, in vitro surveillance data, and Monte 
Carlo simulations were used to evaluate PK/PD target attainment to provide support for the 
eravacycline dosing regimen for patients with cIAI and for the interpretive criteria for in vitro 
susceptibility testing of eravacycline against Enterobacteriaceae. Results of these analyses, based on 
the neutropenic murine thigh-infection model and two approaches for assessing protein binding have 
shown the following: 
• 
Using free-drug AUC/MIC ratio targets associated with net bacterial stasis and a one-
log reduction based on the neutropenic murine thigh-infection model and adjustments 
for protein binding using microdialysis/ultrafiltration, percentage probabilities of PK/PD 
target attainment were ≥90% at MICs of 0.015. At the MIC90 values of 0.5 and 1 
µg/mL for Enterobacteriaceae, percentage probabilities of PK/PD target attainment 
equalled 0%. 
• 
Using free-drug AUC/MIC ratio targets associated with net bacterial stasis and a one-
log reduction based on the neutropenic murine thigh-infection model and adjustments 
for protein binding using serum activity assessments, percentage probabilities of PK/PD 
target attainment were ≥90% at MICs of 0.12. At the MIC90 values of 0.5 µg/mL 
percentage probabilities were ~6 and ~3% for net bacterial stasis and a one-log 
reduction; these percentages fell to 0% at 1 µg/mL. 
Percent probabilities of PK/PD target attainment by MIC value on Day 1 based free-drug AUC/MIC ratio 
targets associated with net bacterial stasis and 1-log10 CFU reductions from baseline for 
Enterobacteriaceae for simulated patients after the administration of eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg q12h are 
shown in the following figure and table.

The efficacy predictions based on the PTA analysis using non-clinical PK/PD targets from the 
neutropenic murine thigh infection model are therefore not consistent with the uniformly high rates of 
microbiologic favourable outcomes in patients with cIAI in the clinical trials up to a breakpoint of ≤1 
mg/L, which was initially suggested by the Applicant for Enterobacteriaceae, A. baumanii and 
anaerobes.

Other findings from PK/PD analyses using data from eravacycline-treated patients in the phase 2 and 3 
studies 
Results for univariable PK-PD analyses for efficacy endpoints failed to demonstrate evidence of 
relationships between free-drug AUC:MIC ratio and response. The high percentages of successful 
responses likely hindered the ability to detect PK-PD relationships for efficacy. Evaluation of the 
distribution of free-drug AUC:MIC ratio relative to non-clinical targets for efficacy did not provide 
support for the intended eravacycline dosing regimen, suggesting that predictions based on non-clinical 
PK-PD targets for efficacy may not correlate well with clinical outcomes in patients with cIAI. 
PK-PD analyses for fever resolution demonstrated relationships between fever resolution and Day 1 
total-drug AUC. 
PK-PD analyses for nausea/vomiting demonstrated significant relationships between the probability of 
nausea/vomiting and total-drug Cmax. 
Results of repeated measures multiple linear regression analyses for amylase, lipase, and aPTT showed 
statistically significant increases in these laboratory measures associated with increases in Cmin. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
CHMP agreed that basic pharmacokinetic characteristics for eravacycline, such as distribution and 
elimination, have been sufficiently investigated. 
ADME 
In the human mass balance study after an IV dose of 14C[eravacycline], 48% and 35% of the 
radioactivity was recovered in faeces and urine, respectively. In the rat mass balance IV study in both 
intact and bile cannulated animals, data support that eravacycline is secreted across GI mucosa and 
that the faecal radioactivity represents both biliary excretion and secretion into the lumen. This is also 
supported by the rat autoradiography study, where the highest tissue:blood ratio was found in the 
large and small intestinal contents after an IV dose. Based on the human mass balance study, the 
major elimination pathway was the excretion of parent compound via kidney, bile and most likely also 
via direct intestinal secretion (supported by rat data). In total ca. 40% of the dose was excreted 
unchanged, however none of these pathways was considered to be major (i.e. not >25%). Kidney and 
bile/intestinal secretion contributing to ca. 20% each and is considered to be equally important 
elimination pathways. Metabolites that were structurally identified, accounted for approximately 30% 
of the dose, with TP-6208 being the main metabolite (~10% of the radioactive dose). All other 
metabolites were considered minor by CHMP.  
TP-6208 appears to be a major metabolite accounted in plasma (>10% of total radioactivity in 
plasma). Both in vitro and in vivo DDI data support that CYP3A4 is responsible for the formation of TP-
6208. Other circulating metabolites in plasma TP-498 and TP-034 appeared to be minor.  
In the in vivo DDI study, when eravacycline was co-administrated with itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 
and P-gp inhibitor), the AUC0-inf for eravacycline increased by 45%. This suggests that ca. 30% of the 
elimination of eravacycline is mediated by CYP3A4. A decrease of metabolite TP-6208 exposure was 
observed, indicating that the formation of TP-6208 is mediated by CYP3A4. This was also supported by 
in vitro CYP identification data and together this suggests that CYP3A4 is the enzyme responsible for 
the main metabolic pathway to form TP-6208. In vitro, TP-6208 was also formed by FMO isoenzymes. 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 57/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Similarly, the exposure of TP-034 decreased when eravacycline was co-administered with itraconazole. 
However, this is not in line with the in vitro data, where CYP3A4/5 was not indicated to be involved in 
the formation of TP-034. In vitro, TP-034 appeared to be formed directly from eravacycline in an 
enzymatic- and NADPH-dependent manner, but the enzyme has not been identified. The lack of 
information was considered acceptable by CHMP, as TP-034 is a minor metabolic pathway. 
The epimerization to TP-498 was observed to occur instantaneously and is therefore not likely to 
involve enzymes. Still when eravacycline is co-administered with itraconazole there was an effect on 
TP-498 AUC (increased ca. 40%). This may be due to a rapid equilibrium between eravacycline and TP-
498.    
In summary, the main elimination pathway of eravacycline was excretion of parent compound via 
kidney, bile and most likely also via direct intestinal secretion. In vitro, eravacycline was shown to be a 
substrate for the transporters P-gp, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, but not for BCRP. The kidney and 
bile/intestinal secretion accounted for approximately 20% each route. Metabolism contributed to ca. 
30%, with TP-6208 being the major metabolite in excreta (~10% of the radioactive dose). The 
responsible enzyme for the formation of TP-6208 was CYP3A4 and possibly also FMOs. All other 
metabolites are considered minor by CHMP. 
Population PK 
The initially submitted main model TETR-PCS-100 was updated with data from three additional studies. 
This updated model i.e. TETR-CSC-106 is regarded as the main population PK model from which PK 
parameters and dose recommendations are derived. It comprises a wide range of PK data from 15 
clinical studies, including seven Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, one study in subjects with 
hepatic impairment, one study in subjects with ESRD, two DDI studies, one Phase 2 study and two 
Phase 3 studies in patients with cIAI, and one phase 3 study in patients with cUTI. Overall, the 
applicant has adequately clarified their modeling strategy and the model looks adequate to describe 
AUC for IV infusion administration. Shrinkages for clearance parameters were less than 30%, while 
shrinkages for volumes parameters were higher (62.8% for V2). Monte Carlo simulations based on the 
model parameter estimates can be used for illustrating the exposure to eravacycline in terms of e.g. 
AUC and Cmax. However, due to the significant shrinkage in volume parameters, the individual post 
hoc estimates (Empirical Bayes Estimates, EBE) derived from the model should be interpreted with 
caution. This affects mainly the derived Cmax and Cmin values. 
Special populations 
The applicant notified that the blood samples for PK analysis in studies TP-434-013 (HI) and TP-434-
014 (RI) were collected in the wrong blood collection tubes, i.e. in tubes containing EDTA as the 
anticoagulant, in contrast to heparin, which was used in other studies. Also, that it is likely that EDTA 
anticoagulant produced artifactually lower plasma concentrations as it could influence the blood:plasma 
ratio, as previously shown for tigecycline (Chen et al., Xenobiotica 2008, (38):77-86). However, it may 
be even more complex in this case compared to the Chen article, as in the HI and RI studies it appears 
that the QC and standard curves were prepared in heparin plasma and study blood samples in EDTA 
tubes. Data provided during the assessment have shown that eravacycline concentrations in Na 
heparin plasma were consistently higher than those in EDTA plasma (average 2.88-fold, range 2.49-
3.09). The bioanalysis method appeared to be suitable for quantitation of eravacycline irrespective of 
the collection tubes (heparin vs. EDTA) used for blood sampling. Lastly, sensitivity analyses were 
performed to examine the impact of the hepatic and renal study PK data and the derived correction 
factor 2.88 on the overall population PK model. Based on the presented findings CHMP agreed that 
Assessment report

data from the hepatic and renal studies (TP-434-013, TP-434-014) and the population PK model 
(TETR-CSC-106) could be used to support dosing recommendation in these populations. 
Body weight 
Body weight based allometric scaling on clearances and volumes were included in the updated 
population PK model. Eravacycline dosing regimen is body weight based and this has been shown to be 
adequate in the body weight range studied. No data are available for patients weighing more than 137 
kg. The potential influence of severe obesity on exposure of eravacycline has not been studied. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Eravacycline (TP-434) is a synthetic fluorocycline antibacterial agent that, like other agents of the 
tetracycline class, inhibits bacterial protein synthesis. Eravacycline is primarily bacteriostatic and has a 
broad spectrum of in vitro activity against a variety of aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and 
Gram-positive bacteria including important pathogens that cause intra-abdominal infections with 
MIC90 values ranging from lower values up to 1 to 4 mg/L. Also against A. baumanii the MIC90 values 
were ranging from 1 to 4 mg/L in different data sets. The poorer activity against P. aeruginosa with 
MIC90 values of 16 to 32 mg/L is similar to what has been seen with other agents of the tetracycline 
class. 
The primary metabolites of eravacycline are inactive in vitro or have less activity then the parent 
compound. 
Resistance studies indicate that eravacycline generally retains activity against tetracycline-specific 
resistance mechanisms (RPP and efflux) excluding the tetracycline-inactivating enzyme tet(X) which 
impacts all tetracyclines. Like many other classes of antibiotics, eravacycline activity is negatively 
affected by expression of some MDR efflux pumps. In addition, target based mutations in 16S rRNA 
and the 30S ribosomal protein S10 resulted in decreased susceptibility to eravacycline. 
Eravacycline maintained activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant 
enterococci, cephalosporin-resistant/ESBL and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-
resistant A. baumannii, and fluoroquinolone-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates – i.e. 
no cross-resistance based on similar mechanisms was apparent. 
Spontaneous mutation frequency values for eravacycline were low and comparable to tigecycline for 
most of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates tested. For E.coli, K. pneumoniae and B. fragilis 
but not for S. aureus, S pyogenes and E. faecalis the MIC increased significantly during serial passage 
experiments demonstrating the ability for resistance to eravacycline to develop. The increase in MIC 
was however not confirmed for the B. fragilis isolate. 
Eravacycline was efficacious in various non-clinical models of infection, with the exception of the rat 
intra-abdominal abscess model (for unknown reasons). The applicant pointed out that no dosing 
solution or plasma PK analysis was completed as part of the study and therefore a full analysis of the 
reasons for failure can unfortunately not be done. 
In an in vitro dynamic chemostat system eravacycline free-drug AUC0-24:MIC ratio was the PK/PD 
index that was considered most associated with the change in bacterial density of E. coli, based on the 
coefficient of determination and dispersion of data across the fitted line. The in vivo PK/PD experiments 
confirmed these results. It can be noted that the coefficient of determination was however as high (or 
somewhat higher in the chemostat experiments) for the PK/PD-index fT>MIC. However, for these 
evaluations the doses chosen were not well adapted because they often resulted in a T>MIC of 100%. 
Notably, only strains of E-coli were evaluated in these experiments.

The magnitude of eravacycline free-drug AUC0-24:MIC ratio associated with net bacterial stasis and 1- 
and 2-log 10 CFU reductions from baseline was 15.3, 20.5, and 28.8, respectively in the in vitro system. 
In an immunocompetent mouse thigh model, the mean free AUC/MIC magnitudes required for a net 
static response and a 1-log 10 reduction for the eight isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were 2.9 ± 3.1 and 
5.6 ± 5.0, respectively. 
In two neutropenic murine thigh model studies, the mean free AUC/MIC magnitudes required for a net 
static response and a 1-log 10 reduction in the first study was 16.1 ± 5.2 and 23.8±9.9, respectively 
and  in the second study 28.0 ± 8.3 and 32.6 ± 10.8, respectively. As commented on above, only 
strains of E.coli were evaluated in these experiments. 
The neutropenic mouse thigh model is the widely used model to derive effective doses for humans 
based on the fact that the magnitude of non-clinical targets has been shown to be predictive of human 
efficacy for several antibacterial agents. However, as can be noted below, the efficacy predictions 
based on the PTA analysis using nonclinical PK/PD targets from the neutropenic murine thigh infection 
model are not consistent with the rates of microbiological favourable outcomes in patients with cIAI in 
the clinical trials up to the breakpoint initially proposed by the Applicant of ≤1 mg/L. 
Susceptibility breakpoints were proposed based on clinical efficacy in human clinical studies and on the 
in vitro susceptibility distributions. As already noted, the proposed breakpoints are not supported by 
probability of target attainment simulations based on magnitudes of non-clinical PK/PD targets. The 
EUCAST has provided their recommendations to CHMP on the susceptibility testing breakpoints and 
consulted with CHMP on the species that would be considered to be relevant pathogens. 
The antimicrobial interaction of eravacycline with other antibacterial agents for aerobic Gram-positive 
and Gram-negative bacteria and for B. fragilis was found to be indifferent for nearly all antibiotic 
combinations and bacteria evaluated. 
The proposed eravacycline dose regimen for cIAI 1.0 mg/kg q12h for 4 to 14 days was brought from 
phase 1 through phase 3 based on acceptable tolerability in phase 1 and on expectations that the 
exposure in relation to in vitro susceptibility would result in high clinical cure rates when compared 
theoretically with tigecycline. High clinical success rates were confirmed in phase 2 and 3 and the 
proposed dose regimen showed non-inferiority to ertapenem and meropenem for the treatment of 
complicated intraabdominal infections. The microbiological responses in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 
studies were pooled and assessed by pathogen and then by the eravacycline MIC. There was no trend 
towards a decrease in a favourable response with increasing eravacycline MIC for any of the 
pathogens. However, it should be noted that the MIC ranges were limited and that for many pathogens 
the total numbers were low and for all pathogens the numbers were low at the highest MIC values that 
would be considered treatable based on the proposed breakpoints. Moreover, as the majority of 
infections were polymicrobial it was difficult to draw conclusions on the actual or major causative 
pathogen.  
The high rates of clinical and microbiological favourable outcomes and non-inferiority to ertapenem and 
meropenem in the treatment of cIAI could be considered reassuring. However, the PTA analysis using 
non-clinical PK/PD targets from the murine thigh infection model did not provide support for the 
proposed dose regimen to cover for the full MIC distribution of the wild-type populations of several 
clinically relevant pathogens nor did they support the proposed susceptibility breakpoints. The PTA 
analyses did not reach above 90% for pathogens with an eravacycline MIC above 0.12 mg/L for free 
drug AUC/MIC targets associated with net bacterial stasis and a 1-log 10 CFU reduction. The reason for 
the discrepancy between clinical outcome and PTA based on non-clinical targets is not fully elucidated. 
The applicant pointed out that the same phenomenon exists for tigecycline. Possible explanations for 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 60/134 
 
 
 
 
 
the difference seen in the clinical trials and the low predicted target attainment based on non-clinical 
PK/PD targets include differences in the protein binding relationship for eravacycline in mouse and 
human serum, differences in the micro environment of the neutropenic mouse thigh versus the human 
abdomen and the complementary role of surgical intervention in the clinical trials. Nevertheless, data 
obtained with the chemostat were also considered. Another factor noted by CHMP is that a high 
proportion of the infections were poly-microbial (~70% in the phase 3 studies), where there is lack of 
certainty of the actual or major causative pathogen.  
Despite the lack of support from non-clinical PK/PD data and the limitations of the clinical microbiology 
data to support the proposed dose regimen, CHMP however noted that the applicant submitted the 
results of a second pivotal study during the assessment. Efficacy data from this study and from the 
previously submitted study show high clinical and microbiological cure rates for patients treated with 
eravacycline. The dose selection is therefore considered confirmed by CHMP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacokinetics for eravacycline has been sufficiently characterised. The in vitro and in 
vivo activity of eravacycline have been adequately described. PTA simulations did not provide support 
for the proposed dose regimen to fully cover for pathogens belonging to the wild-type populations. 
However, efficacy data from two pivotal studies showed high clinical and microbiological cure rates for 
patients treated with eravacycline and thus CHMP agreed that the dose selection can be considered 
confirmed.

• 
• 
eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 150 mg) q12h in (weight ÷ 0.3) ml over 60 min, 
or

Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the clinical response at the TOC Visit for subjects 
in the 2 treatment groups. The primary analysis populations were the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) 
and the clinically evaluable (CE) populations. 
The following secondary objectives were examined: 
•  Compare the clinical response for subjects in the 2 treatment groups in the following
populations (for visits not captured in the primary objective): 
o 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) population 
o  MITT population 
o  CE population 
o  micro-ITT population 
o  ME population 
•  Compare the microbiologic response for subjects in the 2 treatment groups in the following
populations (at the End of Treatment [EOT] and TOC visits): 
o  micro-ITT population 
o  ME population 
•  Assess the safety and tolerability of eravacycline administration in the safety population 
• 
Explore PK parameters after eravacycline infusion 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint for efficacy of this study was the clinical response at the TOC Visit for the MITT 
and CE-EOT populations. 
The secondary endpoints for efficacy of the study were as follows: 
•  Clinical response at the EOT, TOC, and Follow-up (FU) Visits 
•  Microbiologic response at the EOT and TOC Visits 
Sample size 
A sample size of approximately 536 randomised subjects provided 89% and 92% power in the MITT 
and CE-TOC populations, respectively, to show NI assuming an NI margin of 12.5%, a 1-sided alpha of 
0.005, and a 95% evaluability rate for the MITT population and 75% for the CE-TOC population. The 
rates of clinical success were assumed to be 85% in both treatment groups in the MITT population and 
90% in both treatment groups in the CE-TOC population based on the results from the phase 2 study. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to receive eravacycline or ertapenem in a 1:1 ratio with stratification by 
primary site of infection (complicated appendicitis versus all other cIAI diagnoses) using dynamic 
allocation randomisation via an Interactive Web-based Response System (IWRS). No more than 
approximately 30% of subjects should have complicated appendicitis.

Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Since both eravacycline and ertapenem, when prepared for infusion, are 
coloured solutions, require different infusion volumes and, since the dosing interval differed, this study 
was designed with a double-dummy methodology through the use of matching placebo infusions. All 
solutions for infusion were to be prepared by an unblinded pharmacist or designee. Except for the 
responsible study site pharmacist/designee and separate unblinded clinical research associates (CRAs) 
to monitor drug supply and adherence to study drug blinding and randomisation procedures, all study 
staff and subjects were to be blinded to treatment assignment. 
Statistical methods 
This study was designed to show non-inferiority of eravacycline compared to ertapenem. The co-
primary efficacy analyses were based on the MITT and CE-TOC populations and examined clinical 
response at the TOC Visit. 
Analysis populations 
• 
ITT population: all subjects who were randomised 
•  MITT population: all randomised subjects who received any amount of study drug 
•  micro-ITT population: all randomised subjects who had baseline bacterial pathogens that 
cause cIAI and against at least one of which the investigational drug has in vitro antibacterial 
activity. As clinical breakpoints for eravacycline had not been determined at the time of the 
study, for the purpose of this analysis population, all baseline bacterial pathogens were 
considered susceptible to eravacycline. 
•  CE population: all subjects who met the definition for the ITT population and had no major 
protocol deviations. Following criteria are specifically noted: 
Subjects must have fulfilled minimal disease criteria (inclusion criteria 1, 3, 4, and 8). 
Subjects were excluded from the CE analysis set if they: 
•  were found to have met exclusion criterion 9 
• 
• 
• 
received any systemic concomitant antibiotic therapy which was potentially effective against the 
baseline pathogen except if the subject was a clinical failure and received non-study antibiotics for 
insufficient therapeutic effect of the study drug or received 1 dose as prophylaxis for procedures 
unrelated to the ongoing infection or received an oral antibiotic with no systemic absorption 
did not have adequate source control 
did not receive at least 3 days of study drug and was at least 80% compliant 
•  ME population: all subjects who met the definition for the micro-ITT population and had 
no major protocol deviations (i.e. included in the CE population). 
Clinical response 
Clinical response was classified by the investigator as clinical cure, clinical failure, indeterminate or 
missing based on clinical outcomes.  
Clinical cure was defined as complete resolution or significant improvement of signs or symptoms of 
the index infection such that no additional antibacterial therapy, surgical, or radiological intervention 
(e.g., ultrasound guided drainage) was required. 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 65/134 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects were classified as a clinical failure based on: 
•  Death related to cIAI at any time point 
• 
Persistence of clinical symptoms of cIAI 
•  Unplanned surgical procedures or percutaneous drainage procedures 
• 
• 
Post-surgical wound infections requiring systemic antibiotics 
Initiation of rescue antibacterial drug therapy for cIAI 
If the subject’s outcome was neither clinical cure nor clinical failure then the outcome was to be listed 
as Indeterminate. The reason for an “Indeterminate” designation had to be provided. 
Subjects who were assessed as a failure at the EOT Visit were to have the failure carried forward to the 
TOC Visit. Clinical response at TOC (based on Investigator’s assessment) was determined as follows 
from the assessments at the EOT and TOC Visit: 
A Surgical Adjudication Committee (SAC) was responsible for reviewing all subjects classified as a 
clinical failure and all subjects classified as a clinical cure at the TOC or FU Visits who underwent a 
second procedure to determine the adequacy of the source control and for the clinical cures, to assess 
whether subjects met the criteria of a clinical cure.  
Microbiologic evaluation 
There were 3 categories of pathogen identification, as follows: 
1. Always a pathogen: 
•  All Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., E. coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp.), 
Pseudomonas spp., Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus 
spp., Fusobacterium spp., Eubacterium spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., and S. 
aureus were always considered pathogens. 
•  Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas spp. 
2. Not considered a pathogen: fungi and coagulase-negative staphylococci 
3. Pathogens for Microbiology Review Committee (MRC) review: isolates were reviewed in a blinded 
manner by the MRC on a case-by-case basis if neither rule 1 nor 2, above, applied. 
Analyses of the primary efficacy outcome 
The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of subjects with a clinical cure at the TOC visit. For 
those subjects reviewed by the SAC, the committee assessment of clinical response was used in the 
analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 66/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To test the null hypothesis, an adjusted (for the randomisation stratification factor of primary disease 
diagnosis) 2-sided 99% CI for the observed difference in primary outcome rates (eravacycline 
treatment group minus ertapenem treatment group) was calculated for the MITT and CE-TOC 
populations. The two-sided 99% CI for non-inferiority testing was computed using the method 
proposed with stratification for the primary disease diagnosis by Miettinen and Nurminen (Miettinen 
1985). In the calculation of the CI, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weights were used for the stratum 
weights. If the lower limit of the 99% CI for the difference in clinical cure rates analysis set exceeded -
12.5%, then the null hypothesis was rejected and the NI of eravacycline to ertapenem was declared. 
No adjustment for multiple comparisons was required. 
If eravacycline was determined to be non-inferior to ertapenem, superiority of eravacycline to 
ertapenem was to be assessed and superiority of eravacycline for clinical cure at the TOC Visit to be 
concluded if the lower bound of the 2-sided 99% CI was shown to be greater than 0. 
The Investigator’s assessments of clinical response at the TOC Visit (not incorporating the assessment 
of the SAC) in the micro-ITT population, MITT and CE-TOC populations were presented to support the 
findings of the primary and secondary efficacy analyses. 
The primary efficacy outcome was also assessed across the randomisation stratification factor of 
primary disease diagnosis, and across geographical region and country by treatment group. For each 
infection site stratum, geographical region and country, an unadjusted 2-sided 99% CI for the 
observed difference in the clinical cure rate at the TOC Visit was calculated for the MITT and CE-TOC 
populations. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome were also conducted. The first analysis was an unadjusted 
analysis (Miettinen and Nurminen, 1985) for the MITT and CE-TOC populations. The second sensitivity 
analysis analysed those subjects who were considered indeterminates in the primary analysis as 
clinical cures including a CI that was calculated using an adjusted method (Miettinen and Nurminen, 
1985 adjusted for primary diagnosis at baseline). Additional sensitivity analyses were stratified 
analyses for the following combinations: primary site of infection and geographic region, primary site 
of infection and prior antibiotic use, and geographic region and prior antibiotic use. Prior antibiotic use 
was defined as use of any systemic antibiotic in the 72 hours prior to enrolment. Two-sided 99% CIs 
were computed for the difference in clinical cure rate at the TOC Visit between the eravacycline and 
ertapenem treatment groups within each stratum and across strata (Miettinen and Nurminen, 1985). 
In secondary efficacy analyses, the number and percentage of subjects in each treatment group with 
an efficacy outcome of clinical cure, clinical failure and indeterminate/missing were to be presented at 
additional time-points (for the EOT Visit, the TOC visit and the FU visit) based on the different analysis 
populations. Two-sided 95% unadjusted CIs were constructed for the observed difference in the clinical 
cure rates between the treatment groups for descriptive purposes; no conclusion of non-inferiority was 
made. 
There was no formal interim analysis of efficacy for this study. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) was to review safety data by unblinded treatment assignment when approximately 150, 300 
and 450 subjects have had their TOC visit. 
The final SAP, Statistical Analysis Plan EMA 3.0 (dated 7 January, 2015), was based on protocol 
version 3.0 dated October 31, 2013.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 541 subjects were randomly assigned to the eravacycline group (270 subjects) or the 
ertapenem group (271 subjects). Three subjects in the ertapenem group did not receive study drug. 
Two of these subjects withdrew consent prior to study drug administration and 1 subject was 
randomised in error (screen failure: antibiotic-related exclusion) and did not receive study drug. These 
3 subjects were not included in the Safety population or in the MITT population.

Approximately half of the subjects in the micro-ITT population used systemic antibacterial medication 
prior to the first dose of study drug and the incidence was similar between the treatment groups 
(48.6% vs. 48.7% for eravacycline and ertapenem groups, respectively). Numbers in the CE-TOC 
population were 49.0% vs. 47.5%, respectively. The most frequently used systemic antibacterial 
medications prior to the first dose of study drug were imidazole derivatives, combinations of penicillins, 
second-generation cephalosporins, and third-generation cephalosporins.

Concomitant systemic antibacterial medications use from the first dose of study drug through the TOC 
Visit in the MITT population was 13.0% of the subjects in the eravacycline treatment group and 8.6% 
of the subjects in the ertapenem treatment group. The most frequently used systemic antibacterial 
medications after the first dose of study drug were imidazole derivatives, third-generation 
cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones.  
Recruitment 
The study was conducted between 28 August 2013 and 26 August 2014. The study included 66 clinical 
sites in 11 countries. The majority of subjects (415 of 541) were enrolled in Eastern Europe. No site 
enrolled more than 35 subjects. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 2 global amendments to the original study protocol. 
The first was implemented before any subjects were enrolled and documented the following: an 
increase in the study sample size, inclusion of the micro-ITT population, change in assessment timing, 
change in microbiological specimen collection, clarification of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
refinement of clinical response assessment, and other global administrative changes and clarifications. 
The second was implemented after 197 subjects were enrolled and documented the following: the 
change in primary analysis populations and NI margin for the EMA, revision of the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, change in the dose of eravacycline was limited to 1.0 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 
150 mg q12h, changes in the restricted concomitant medications, clarification on study drug and 
placebo preparation, change in the maximum dosage in 24 hours, and other global administrative 
changes and clarifications. Changes to the protocol were considered to have no negative impact on the 
safety of subjects already enrolled into the study. 
There were also certain country-specific protocol amendments issued that did not affect the overall 
design or outcome of the study.

Approximately 80% of all randomised subjects had at least one baseline bacterial pathogen that was 
considered to cause cIAI (=micro-ITT population). 
Approximately 70% of subjects in each treatment group had poly-microbial infections. 
Gram-negative aerobes were isolated from 182 [82.7%] eravacycline vs. 186 [82.3%] ertapenem 
treated patients, respectively. The corresponding figures for Gram-positive aerobes were 117 [53.2%) 
vs. 120 [53.1%] and for anaerobes 106 [48.2%] vs. 107 [47.3%]. 
Pathogens belonging to Enterobacteriaceae were most frequently isolated (168 [76.4%] vs. 171 
[75.7%]) with E. coli being the most commonly isolated species (127 [57.7%] vs. 132 [58.4%]) for 
eravacycline and ertapenem patients, respectively. 
20 (9.1%) eravacycline vs. 20 (8.8%) ertapenem patients were bacteraemic.

The most frequent reasons for clinical failure were unplanned surgical procedure or percutaneous 
drainage procedure (MITT: 4.1% for both treatment groups; CE: 3.3% in the eravacycline group and 
3.4% in the ertapenem group), initiation of rescue antibacterial therapy for cIAI (MITT: 2.2% for both 
groups; CE: 2.1% in the eravacycline group and 0.8% in the ertapenem group), persistence of clinical 
symptoms of cIAI (MITT: 1.9% in the eravacycline group and 2.2% in the ertapenem group; CE: 1.3% 
in the eravacycline group and 1.7% in the ertapenem group) and post-surgical wound infections 
requiring systemic antibiotics (MITT: 1.9% in the eravacycline group and 1.1% in the ertapenem 
group; CE: 2.1% in the eravacycline group and 0.8% in the ertapenem group. There were no deaths 
due to cIAI. 
Sensitivity analyses 
The results of the sensitivity analyses (Sensitivity analysis 1#: unadjusted 99% CI; Sensitivity analysis 
2#: indeterminate/missing as clinical cure) were supportive of the primary analysis results. The lower 
bounds of the 99% CI were -9.2, -7.3, -7.9 and -7.9 for the sensitivity analysis 1# and MITT, 
sensitivity analysis 2# and CE, sensitivity analysis 1# and CE, and sensitivity analysis 2# and CE, 
respectively. 
Clinical response by primary disease diagnosis 
There were no meaningful differences in cure rate between the treatment groups in either population 
(MITT and CE at TOC), regardless of whether the primary site of infection was complicated appendicitis 
or other cIAI. 
Clinical response by geographic region or country 
Rates of response between treatment groups in the MITT population were generally similar for 
geographic region and country, with the highest rates of response occurring in Ukraine, Romania and 
Latvia. Generally higher overall clinical cure rates were observed in the CE population with between-
group differences that were more similar across geographic regions and countries. 
The differences in clinical success rates varied by geographic region, but the varying sizes of the 
geographic subgroups made direct comparisons difficult. In the United States, the larger between-
group difference in clinical response was primarily due to a higher rate of indeterminate responses in 
the ertapenem group. In the CE population, which does not include subjects with indeterminate 
responses, the between group difference was smaller and was more similar to the differences seen in 
other geographic regions and countries. 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 72/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Additional analyses taking into consideration primary disease diagnosis and geographic region, prior 
antibiotic use and geographic region, and prior antibiotic use and primary disease diagnosis were also 
conducted. The variable numbers of subjects in any given subgroup makes direct comparisons of these 
data difficult, but generally the clinical response was similar and consistent between treatment groups 
in the analyses performed regardless of primary diagnosis, geographic region or prior antibiotic use. 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses by patient and infection characteristics 
A series of sub-population analyses of clinical response at the TOC visit by baseline characteristics for 
the MITT and CE populations was conducted. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
There were no meaningful differences or trends in the clinical cure rates for any age category 
in either population, nor between the eravacycline and ertapenem treatment groups. 
There were no apparent differences in clinical cure by gender for either population. 
The majority of subjects in the both treatment groups in both populations were Caucasian. As 
a consequence of the predominance of one race, examination of the effect of race on clinical 
response was not feasible. 
For the eravacycline-treated MITT population, there was no apparent difference in clinical cure 
between Europe, EU and non-EU Europe. Clinical cure rates in this analysis population were 
slightly lower in North America. Clinical cure rates were higher in the ertapenem-treated MITT 
population in all European subpopulations, but notably lower in North America.  These trends 
were maintained in the CE population by geographic region. 
There were no major differences in clinical response by site of infection at baseline for either 
analysis population. 
In the MITT population, cure rates for eravacycline were somewhat lower among subjects who 
had no abscesses at baseline than ertapenem (88.1% compared to 92.5%). This small 
difference is of no clear clinical significance. There were no differences among subjects who 
had ≥1 abscess at baseline.  There were no trends or differences in clinical response in the CE 
population. 
In the MITT population, cure rates for eravacycline were somewhat lower among subjects with 
APACHE II score <10 at baseline than for ertapenem (87.1% compared to 91.3%). In the 
subjects with APACHE II score ≥10 at baseline, cure rates for eravacycline were slightly higher 
than for ertapenem (86.3% compared to 83.1%). These small differences are of no clear 
clinical significance. There were no trends or differences in clinical response in the CE 
population. 
•  With regard to subjects with renal function impairment, in the MITT population, cure rates 
were lower in the Moderate/Severe group for both treatment groups compared with the 
Normal/Mild group. Cure rates in the augmented group were similar to those in the 
Normal/Mild group. The same trends were seen in the CE population. Between-group 
comparisons were limited by the small sample size in some of the subgroups. 
•  Clinical cure rates in the MITT population were higher in both treatment groups among 
subjects who had not received prior antibiotic treatment compared with those who had.  
The same trends were seen in the CE population, although overall cure rates were numerically 
higher. Potential factors in the lower cure rate among subjects who received prior antibiotics 
are inclusion of subjects who had already failed prior antibiotic treatment and higher baseline 
disease severity in this group. 
Secondary efficacy analyses 
Clinical response was evaluated at the EOT, TOC, and Follow-up Visits in the ITT, MITT, micro-ITT, CE-
EOT (or TOC), and ME-EOT (or TOC) populations. The differences in clinical cure rates are summarised 
in the following table:

Table E5. 
Difference in clinical cure rates between eravacycline-treated subjects and 
ertapenem-treated subjects by analysis population by visit 
Time to defervescence 
Nearly 100 subjects in each treatment arm were febrile at baseline. The median time to defervescence 
as determined by using the Kaplan-Meier method was 5 days for subjects in both the eravacycline and 
ertapenem treatment groups (interquartile range: 3, 7 days for subjects in the eravacycline treatment 
group and 2, 7 days for subjects in the ertapenem treatment group).  
Microbiological response 
Microbiological response was largely derived from the clinical response because, as expected for a cIAI 
study, very few repeat cultures were performed. A clinical cure was a “presumed eradication” and 
therefore a favourable microbiological response. For example at the TOC visit all but one (of 192 
subjects) in the eravacycline group and all but four (of 202 subjects) in the ertapenem group had a 
favourable microbiological response derived from clinical cure. The per-subject microbiological 
response at the TOC visit for the micro-ITT population is presented in the following table: 
Table E6. 
Per-subject microbiological response at the TOC visit (micro-ITT population) 
The pathogens present in the instances of persistence responses (TOC visit, ME population) were 
Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus durans, Clostridium perfringens, Haemophilus 
parainfluenzae, and Bacteroides ovatus, and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, 
Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus Group F in the eravacycline and ertapenem groups, 
respectively.

The per-pathogen microbiological response (at least 10 subjects in either treatment group) is 
presented in the following table: 
Table E7. 
Microbiological favourable response (at least 10 subjects in either treatment 
group) at the TOC visit by baseline pathogen (micro-ITT population) 
As can be noted, the percentage of favourable responses was relatively similar between treatment 
groups for most pathogens. The baseline pathogens in subjects where the incidence of favourable 
responses was >10% greater in the eravacycline treatment group compared to the ertapenem 
treatment group included Streptococcus constellatus, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae, and B. 
thetaiotaomicron. The baseline pathogens in subjects where the incidence of favourable responses was 
>10% less in the eravacycline treatment group compared to the ertapenem treatment group included 
Enterobacter cloacae, B. ovatus, Enterococcus faecalis, and P. aeruginosa. 
The applicant stresses that a 100% favourable response was noted in subjects with baseline 
Acinetobacter baumannii in both treatment groups (8/8 and 5/5 in the eravacycline and ertapenem 
groups, respectively) at the TOC Visit. However, CHMP noted that the number was low and the role for

a specific pathogen in the individual case is difficult to judge since the majority of infections were 
polymicrobial and the outcome is not only dependent on antimicrobial chemotherapy but also surgery.

Subjects with bacteraemia at baseline had a high microbiological favourable response rate. There was 
one patient with an unfavourable response in each treatment group that both had E. coli isolated from 
the blood. 
Favourable microbiological response rates by MIC to study drug received were also analysed in the 
micro-ITT population for the most frequently isolated pathogens. Overall, over the range of MICs 
observed, eravacycline had a high level of activity against the most frequently isolated pathogens. 
The incidence of superinfection or new infection was low (3 or fewer subjects in each treatment group) 
and similar for the treatment groups in the micro-ITT population. 
In subjects whose outcomes were classified as clinical failures and who underwent a second surgical 
procedure that allowed for repeated culture, the susceptibility to eravacycline of the pathogens isolated 
at the follow-up procedure was compared with the susceptibility of the original baseline pathogens.  
Only one subject exhibited decreasing susceptibility. One subject was enrolled in the study with a 
diagnosis of a perforated intestine with intra-abdominal abscess. Baseline cultures grew B. ovatus, B. 
vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The patient was treated with 9 dose cycles 
of eravacycline with improvement. However, on study Day 7, the patient was diagnosed with a wound 
infection and dehiscence. The patient was assessed as a treatment failure, study drug was 
discontinued, and the patient underwent revision of the surgical wound. Repeat cultures grew B. 
ovatus, Enterococcus faecalis and P. aeruginosa. MICs to eravacycline for B. ovatus and P. aeruginosa 
increased from 0.03 at baseline to 0.12 μg/mL post-baseline and 2 at baseline to 8 μg/mL post-
baseline, respectively. Tobramycin and amikacin were started. The patient subsequently had complete 
resolution of her cIAI and wound infection signs and symptoms. 
Study TP-434-025 (IGNITE 4) 
Methods 
This was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre study to evaluate the NI of 
eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg i.v. q12h to meropenem 1.0 g i.v. q8h in subjects with cIAI. 
Assessment report

Study Participants  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria used in study TP-434-025 were similar to those used in study TP-
434-008. 
The randomisation of patients with complicated appendicitis was capped to 50 % as compared to 30% 
in the previous study. CHMP noted that this was not in line with the antibacterial Addendum which 
states that the percentage of patients with complicated appendicitis should be limited to 30%. The 
percentage of patients having cIAI originating from complicated appendicitis is stated in Section 4.4 of 
the SmPC. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomized to receive either: 
• 
Eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg, q12h or  
•  meropenem 1 mg, q8h (minimum four 24 hour dosing cycles). 
As the efficacy of IV eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI was demonstrated in TP-434-008 study, the 
eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg every 12-hour dose (with no maximum dose) was selected for this study. 
Objectives 
The primary objective and secondary objectives are identical to those in Study TP-434-008. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was clinical response at TOC for the MITT and CE populations.  
Secondary endpoints were Clinical response at the EOT, TOC and FU visits, and Microbiological 
response at the EOT and TOC visits. 
Objectives and endpoints for efficacy are in line with what would be expected for a comparative study 
in patients with cIAI. The endpoints are identical to those in Study TP-434-008. The time points for the 
EOT, TOC and FU visits, were similar to the time points for the corresponding visits in Study TP-434-
008. 
Sample size 
The sample size was based on the assumptions of clinical cure rates of 84% in the  eravacycline group 
and 85% in the meropenem group in the MITT population and 89% in the eravacycline group and 90% 
in the meropenem group in the CE-TOC population, an NI margin of -12.5%, a one-sided alpha of 
0.025, evaluability rates of 95% for the MITT population and 85% for the CE-TOC population, and the 
methodology of Farrington and Manning, there was more than 90% power in both the MITT population 
and the CE population to show non-inferiority with a sample size of 466 enrolled subjects (increased 
from 400 based on a pre-specified assessment of the actual number of subjects in the micro-ITT 
population following completion of the 250th subject using data blinded to treatment). 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 77/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to receive eravacycline or meropenem in a 1:1 ratio with stratification by 
primary site of infection (complicated appendicitis versus all other cIAI diagnoses) via an Interactive 
Web-based Response System (IWRS). In Study TP-434-008, randomisation of subjects with 
complicated appendicitis was capped at 30%. This was increased to 50% in Study TP-434-025 as the 
results from Study TP-434-008 showed similar clinical cure rates in the eravacycline arm for subjects 
in the complicated appendicitis stratum and the “Other cIAI” stratum.  
As it turned out (Study TP-434-025); the proportion of subjects diagnosed with complicated 
appendicitis was approximately 40% and (as expected) similar in both arms (see baseline 
characteristics below). In study TP-434-008 the corresponding proportion was approximately 27%. A 
percentage of 40% diagnosed with complicated appendicitis is not in line with the CHMP guideline 
where a cut-off of 30% for these infection types is recommended. Still, this patient population reflects 
what is commonly observed in clinical studies with cIAI, namely a dominance of patients with mild to 
moderately severe infections mainly originating from the appendix. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. The two drugs required different infusion volumes and the dosing 
interval differed. The study was therefore designed using double-dummy methodology with 
eravacycline-matched placebo and meropenem-matched placebo to consist of sterile normal saline 
(0.9% NaCl). Both eravacycline and meropenem, when prepared for infusion, are coloured solutions, 
therefore coloured tubing and bag covers were also used. All solutions for infusion were to be prepared 
by an unblinded pharmacist or designee.  
Statistical methods 
For an overview of the analysis populations and categories of pathogens for the microbiological 
evaluation as well as the methods and analysis approach used, please see the Methods section in study 
TP-434-008. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 500 subjects were randomly assigned to the eravacycline group (250 subjects) or the 
meropenem group (250 subjects). One subject in the meropenem group did not receive study drug 
because the subject withdrew from the study. This subject was not included in the Safety population or 
the MITT population.

Compliance and exposure to study drugs 
•  The mean (±SD) percent compliance was 99.82 % ± 1.460 for the eravacycline group and 
99.87% ± 1.057 for the meropenem group. 
•  All subjects achieved ≥80% compliance. 
•  The mean duration of treatment was 7.2 days ± 2.74 days in the eravacycline group and 7.5 
days ±2.95 days in the meropenem group. 
•  The mean number of active doses administered was 12.7 ± 5.35 in the eravacycline group and 
19.8 ±8.57 in the meropenem group, consistent with the planned dosing regimens. 
Prior and concomitant exposure to other antibiotics 
Approximately half of the subjects in the micro-ITT population used systemic antibacterial medication 
prior to the first dose of study drug and the incidence was similar between the treatment groups 
(54.4% vs. 49.3% for eravacycline and meropenem groups, respectively). The most frequently used 
systemic antibacterial medications prior to the first dose of study drug were imidazole derivatives, 
combinations of penicillins and third-generation cephalosporins. 
Concomitant systemic antibacterial medications use from the first dose of study drug through the TOC 
Visit in the MITT population was 8.0% of subjects in the eravacycline treatment group and 21 8.4% of 
subjects in the meropenem treatment group. 
The most frequently used systemic antibacterial medications after the first dose of study drug were 
imidazole derivatives, combinations of penicillin including beta-lactamase inhibitors and carbapenems.

The study was conducted between 13 October 2016 and 19 May 2017. The study included 65 clinical 
sites in 11 countries. The majority of subjects (348 of 500) were enrolled in Eastern Europe. No site 
enrolled more than 35 subjects.

Conduct of the study 
There was one amendment to the original study protocol. Changes to the protocol included two 
clarification letters regarding the inclusion criterion one and the increase in planned enrolment for the 
study. Further administrative changes and clarifications were introduced. 
There were 161 [64%] subjects in the eravacycline treatment group and 143 [57%] subjects in the 
meropenem treatment group who had at least 1 protocol deviation. The most frequently reported 
major protocol deviation in either group was incomplete or out-of-window subject visit (11 [4%] 
subjects in the eravacycline treatment group and 10 [4%] subjects in the meropenem treatment 
group). The number of patients having major protocol deviations was, in general, similar between the 
two treatment groups and is considered not to have had any major influence on the overall conclusion 
on benefit-risk of eravacycline.

In general there were no major differences between groups with concern to baseline characteristics. 
However, in the meropenem treated group there was a slightly larger proportion of patients > 75 years 
(n=20 (10.8%) vs. n= 27 (8.0%) and with APACHE II score >15 (n=8 (3.2%) vs. n=3 (1.2%). The 
number of patients in each group having baseline blood culture that grew at least one pathogen known

to cause cIAI were similar to what was seen in Study TP-434-008 (16 [8.2%] subjects in the 
eravacycline group and 15 [7.3%] subjects in the meropenem group, respectively). 
Approximately 40% in both groups had complicated appendicitis (capped at 50%) with other 
dominating diagnoses being intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis. 
Baseline microbiology 
All subjects in the micro-ITT population had a baseline intra-abdominal specimen, and all but one 
subject had baseline blood culture samples. The majority of the intra-abdominal specimens had 
confirmed bacterial growth on culture (>99% of subjects in both treatment groups).  
In the eravacycline group there were 75 % of subjects with polymicrobial infections. The corresponding 
figure in the meropenem treatment group was 65 %. 
Gram-negative aerobes were isolated from 158 [81.0%] eravacycline vs. 166 [81.0%] meropenem 
treated patients, respectively. The corresponding figures for Gram-positive aerobes were 122 [62.6%) 
vs. 107 [52.2%] and for anaerobes 110 [56.4%] vs. 111 [44.1%]. 
Pathogens belonging to Enterobacteriaceae were most frequently isolated (146 [74.9%] vs. 154 
[75.1%]) with E. coli being the most commonly isolated species (126 [64.6%] vs. 134 [65.4%]) for 
eravacycline and meropenem patients, respectively. 
Approximately 17% of the blood cultures in the eravacycline group and 15% in the meropenem group 
had confirmed growth. The pathogens isolated from blood were similar to those isolated from intra-
/extra-abdominal cultures.

The most frequent reasons for clinical failure in both populations and in both treatment groups were 
initiation of rescue antibacterial therapy for cIAI and unplanned surgical procedure or percutaneous 
drainage procedure. 
The primary analysis show statistical non-inferiority of eravacycline as compared with meropenem in 
the treatment of cIAI in both the MITT and the CE populations at the TOC visit. 
Secondary Efficacy analysis- Clinical response 
Clinical response was evaluated at the EOT, TOC, and Follow-up Visits in the ITT, MITT, micro-ITT, CE-
EOT (or TOC), and ME-EOT (or TOC) populations. The differences in clinical cure rates are summarised 
in the following table. 
Table E12 Difference in Clinical Cure Rates Between Eravacycline-treated Subjects and 
Meropenem-treated Subjects by Analysis Population by Visit 
The results of the secondary analyses were supportive of the primary analysis in that non-inferiority is 
shown at EOT, TOC and FU visits in the populations analysed.

Secondary Efficacy Analysis-Microbiological response 
At the EOT visit, 183 (93.8%) of subjects in the eravacycline treatment group and 192 (93.7%) of 
meropenem subjects in the micro-ITT population had favorable per-subject microbiological responses. 
Of the subjects in the micro-ITT population with favorable responses, 179 (91.8%) subjects in the 
eravacycline group and 187 (91.2%) subjects in the meropenem group had presumed eradicated 
responses. The 5 (2.6%) subjects in the eravacycline group and the 6 (2.9%) subjects in the 
meropenem group with unfavorable microbiological responses had responses of persistence. Seven 
subjects in each treatment group had an indeterminate microbiological response.

Table E14 Microbiological Favorable Response (At Least 10 Subjects in Either Treatment 
Group) at the TOC Visit by Baseline Pathogen, micro-IIT Population 
The percentage of favourable responses was generally similar between treatment groups for most 
pathogens. It is noted that in the previous Study TP-434-008, the response rate was particularly low in 
the eravacycline group for Enterococcus faecalis (69.6%), while in the current study the response rate 
was > 90%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 85/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The baseline pathogens in subjects where the incidence of favourable responses was >10% greater in 
the eravacycline treatment group compared to the meropenem treatment group included Klebsiella 
pneumoniae. The baseline pathogens in subjects where the incidence of favourable responses was 
>10% less in the eravacycline treatment group compared to the meropenem treatment group included 
Streptococcus anginosus group, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides uniformis. 
The response rate in subjects with baseline A. baumannii was 100% in both treatment groups (5/5 and 
2/2 in the eravacycline and meropenem groups, respectively) at the TOC visit. However, the numbers 
of Acinetobacter baumannii included in the clinical trials were too low to convincingly claim efficacy 
against this microbe. 
Subjects with bacteraemia at baseline had high microbiological favourable response rates in both 
treatment groups. All subjects in the eravacycline group and all but one subject in the meropenem 
group had a favourable microbiological response at the TOC Visit. 
Microbiologic favourable response rates by MIC were analysed in the micro-ITT population for the most 
frequently isolated pathogens. Overall, over the range of MIC values observed, eravacycline had a high 
level of activity against the most frequently isolated pathogens. 
The incidences of superinfection and decreasing susceptibility were low. One subject had superinfection 
and one subject had decreasing susceptibility at the TOC Visit; both subjects were in the eravacycline 
group. No subjects reported a new infection. 
As also observed in Study TP-434-008, the portion of cIAI patients being infected by multidrug 
resistant pathogens such as ESBL, AmpC β-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing gram-negative 
aerobic pathogens were too low in both treatment groups to be able to draw any conclusions. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome were conducted for the MITT population. The results of the 
sensitivity analyses were supportive of the primary analysis results. 
Clinical response by primary disease diagnosis 
Clinical response at the TOC Visit for subjects in the MITT and CE populations were analysed by 
primary disease diagnosis. Clinical response was observed to a similar extent in subgroups with 
complicated appendicitis or other cIAI.  
Clinical response by geographic region or country 
The differences in clinical success rates varied by geographic region, but the varying sizes of the 
geographic subgroups made direct comparisons difficult. 
Summary of main studies 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Supportive study 
TP-434-P2-cIAI-1 
This was a phase 2, randomised (2:2:1), double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre study comparing 
two regimens of eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg q24h and 1.0 mg/kg i.v. q12h) with ertapenem (1.0 g i.v. 
q24h) in subjects with community-acquired cIAI. Randomisation was stratified based on primary site of 
infection (complicated appendicitis vs. other sites of cIAI). There was an enrolment cap of 50% 
complicated appendicitis.  
The study population included men and women 18 to 75 years of age. Eligible subjects had a diagnosis 
of CA-cIAI requiring urgent surgical or percutaneous intervention and not expected to require 
antibacterial therapy for longer than 14 days. Patients with pathogens resistant to one of the studied 
drugs, with APACHE score >25, or renal failure were excluded from the study. 
Subjects were treated for 4 to a maximum of 14 days and remained hospitalised for the complete 
course of the treatment. TOC evaluations occurred 10 to 14 days after the last dose and a follow-up 
visit occurred 28 to 42 days after the last dose. 
The primary endpoint was clinical response at the TOC visit in the microbiologically evaluable (ME) 
population. Clinical response at the TOC visit in the MITT and CE populations were evaluated as 
secondary endpoints. 
A total of 143 subjects from 40 sites in six countries (four countries in Eastern Europe, India and the 
US) were enrolled and included in the analyses.

The mean duration of treatment was 6.7, 6.3 and 6.2 days, respectively. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally similar across the 3 treatment groups. The 
majority of subjects were male (72.0%) and Caucasian (68.5%). The overall mean (standard deviation 
[SD]) age was 42.6 (17.64) years, with the majority of subjects (86.7%) under 65 years of age. 
Median body weight was 70.0 kg for all 3 treatment groups. 
A total of 119 subjects in the m-MITT population had at least one intra-abdominal pathogen identified 
at baseline; a total of 212 baseline isolates were collected. Gram-negative aerobes were identified at 
baseline in 84.0% of subjects, Gram positive aerobes in 36.1%, Gram-negative anaerobes in 10.9%, 
and Gram-positive anaerobes in 4.2%. The most frequently isolated Gram-negative pathogen was E. 
coli (65.5% of subjects). Enterococcus faecalis (6.7% of subjects) was the most frequently identified 
Gram-positive aerobe, while B. fragilis (5.0% of subjects) was the most frequently isolated Gram-
negative anaerobe. 
The clinical response at the TOC visit in the ME (primary analysis population), CE and MITT (secondary

The clinical cure rate was comparable for all treatment arms and analysis populations. The number of 
clinical failures was low. Reasons for the response of failure included persisting or recurrent infection, 
concomitant antibacterial therapy, and postsurgical wound infection in the eravacycline groups, and 
concomitant antibacterial therapy and persisting or recurrent infection in the ertapenem group. In the 
MITT population the number with a clinical response of indeterminate was higher in the eravacycline 
groups. Reasons for the response of indeterminate included assessment not available, prophylactic 
antibiotics, consent withdrawn, response imputed, and death not due to IAI.

The microbiological response followed the results of the clinical response. For the subjects with 
unfavourable microbiological response the outcome was deemed presumed persistence. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of eravacycline in the treatment of adults with cIAI has been assessed in one Phase 2 
study (TP-434-P2-cIAI-1) comparing two i.v. regimens of eravacycline with ertapenem and in two 
Phase 3 studies (TP-434-008 and TP-434-025) comparing one i.v. regimen of eravacycline with 
ertapenem or meropenem, respectively. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main studies (TP-434-008 [IGNITE 1] and TP-434-025 [IGNITE 4) were randomised, double-blind, 
double-dummy, multicentre studies to evaluate the NI of eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg i.v. q12h to 
ertapenem 1.0 g i.v. q24h or meropenem 1g i.v. q8h in subjects with cIAI. Adult patients hospitalised 
with cIAI including intraabdominal abscess or peritonitis in the need for acute surgical or percutaneous 
intervention and at least one symptom of systemic inflammatory response were included. Subjects 
with most severe infections including those with septic shock were excluded from the studies. Patients 
with renal failure, significant hepatic disease or immunocompromised patients were furthermore 
excluded. The inclusion/exclusion criteria were considered acceptable by CHMP. However, CHMP 
agreed that the important limitations of the clinical data are presented in section 4.4 of the Xerava 
product information. Patients with creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min were initially excluded, however, 
the study protocol for study TP-434-008 was amended in 2013 to exclude only patients with creatinine 
clearance < 50 ml/min. Considering that for many acute severe infections, GFR will be low secondary 
to sepsis and hypovolemia, excluding patients with CrCl < 50 ml/min will lead to a selection of less ill 
patients. The applicant has clarified that the exclusion criteria: creatinine clearance cut-off was raised 
from 30 ml/min to 50 mL/min due to the lack of eravacycline PK data in subjects with renal 
impairment. By the time these data became available, it was considered that the enrolment of patients 
with creatinine clearance cut-off of 50 ml/min would be almost finalised before a protocol amendment 
would be approved, which is considered acceptable. Creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min was used as an 
exclusion criterion in study TP-434-025. 
With regard to patients with severe renal impairment, data is limited and the limitation is reflected in 
the Xerava SmPC section 5.2. 
It should be noted that ertapenem is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment 
because of lack of data. Although the study could include severe cases of cIAI the majority of patients 
had low APACHE II scores and ertapenem and therapy resulted in a high clinical success rate. 
Therefore the choice of ertapenem as comparator is considered acceptable by CHMP.  In the second 
pivotal study TP-343-025, meropenem was used as the comparator with dosing in accordance with 
recommendations. Meropenem is recommended for the treatment of more severe cases and cases of 
health-care associated infections. Meropenem is considered an appropriate comparator by CHMP, 
although also in this study the majority of patients had low APACHE II scores.  
The dose of eravacycline chosen for the phase 3 study is discussed in the pharmacodynamics section of 
this report, and some questions were raised on the sufficiency to cover the range of target pathogens. 
However, CHMP considered that data from the two pivotal studies showed high clinical and 
microbiological cure rates for patients treated with eravacycline with the proposed dose.  
The primary objective of the pivotal studies was to compare the clinical response at the TOC Visit for 
subjects in the two treatment groups. The primary endpoint for efficacy was the clinical response at 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 93/134 
 
 
 
 
 
the TOC Visit for the MITT and CE-EOT populations. CHMP agreed that objectives and endpoints for 
efficacy are in line with what would be expected for a comparative study in patients with cIAI. 
Sample size considerations were deemed adequate. The studies were of non-inferiority design with a 
NI margin of -12.5%, which is in accordance with recommendations in the CHMP guideline. Study TP-
343-008 was designed using a 1-sided alpha of 0.005, in line with CHMP expectations for cIAI studies 
when a single pivotal study is conducted (i.e. two-sided 0.01). The second cIAI study (i.e. TP-343-025) 
was designed using a conventional significance level (i.e. when non-inferiority and one-sided; 0.025). 
Subjects were randomised to eravacycline or ertapenem or to eravacycline or meropenem in a 1:1 
ratio, with stratification by primary site of infection (complicated appendicitis versus all other cIAI 
diagnoses). Initially an enrolment cap of approximately 50% complicated appendicitis was planned for 
study TP-434-008, but this was changed to 30% before any subjects were enrolled (Amendment 1.0, 
Final Protocol Version 2.0 dated 20 June 2013). As the results from study TP-434-008 showed similar 
cure rates irrespective of primary site of infection, for study TP-434-025 the cap for appendicitis was 
increased to 50%. Approximately 40 % of subjects in study TP-434-025 in both treatment arms had 
complicated appendicitis. The percentage of patients having cIAI originating from the appendix is 
stated in section 4.4 of the Xerava SmPC. 
Both studies were double-blind using the double-dummy technique. The methodology used and the 
procedures planned to mask the study treatments were deemed adequate by CHMP. 
The final version of the EMA SAP (version 3.0) for Study TP-343-008 was dated 7 January, 2015 and 
according to the submitted Data Management Plan the database lock was expected to be on 23 
January, 2015. The actual date was not found, hence, the date for database lock and code break 
needed to be confirmed. As clear from the applicant’s response, the database lock, unblinding of the 
statistician and the primary analysis were performed during December 2014. While being ahead of the 
date for the final SAP, no concern was raised, since the primary analysis was nonetheless performed 
according to what was later to be updated in the SAP with the major updates claimed to be due to 
errors in the SAP. 
Study TP-434-008 and study TP-434-025 were designed to address both EMA and US FDA regulatory 
requirements; separate strategies for the statistical analyses were pre-defined and there were two 
different versions of the SAP. The EMA SAP was considered overall appropriate. The definition of the 
analysis populations and definition of clinical response was acceptable. Subjects were classified as a 
clinical failure based on, among other things, “persistence of clinical symptoms of cIAI”. Recurrences of 
clinical symptoms of cIAI were classified as clinical failure. 
The pathogen identification was adequate, although there is an inherent uncertainty on the major 
causative agent(s) in cIAI because findings are often poly-microbial. The NI margin of -12.5%, the co-
primary efficacy analysis based on the MITT and CE-TOC analysis populations and, for Study TP-343-
008,  2-sided 99% CI (instead of standard 2-sided 95% CI, when at the time performed was to serve 
as a single pivotal study) were in line with CHMP expectations for NI studies in cIAI. In the primary 
analysis based on the MITT population, subjects with missing data were displayed as 
indeterminate/missing and contributed to the analysis as non-responders. Subjects who were assessed 
as a failure at the EOT Visit were to have the failure carried forward to the TOC Visit. In the (co-
primary) CE-TOC population, subjects with missing/indeterminate response were by definition 
excluded. In both studies sensitivity analyses were planned. 
For study TP-434-008, a total of 541 subjects were randomised to the eravacycline group (270 
subjects) or the ertapenem group (271 subjects). Approximately 94% in each treatment group 
completed treatment and 91% and 94% completed the study in the eravacycline and ertapenem 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 94/134 
 
 
 
 
 
groups, respectively. The difference between the groups was mainly due to a higher number of 
patients lost to follow-up in the eravacycline group.  
For study TP-434-025, there were 250 subjects randomised to the eravacycline and meropenem 
groups, respectively. Approximately 96% in each treatment group completed treatment and 95% and 
96% completed the study in the eravacycline and meropenem groups, respectively. 
Other reasons for early termination or premature treatment discontinuation were evenly distributed in 
the two treatment arms in both studies. 
The applicant has submitted a detailed description of the major protocol deviations reported in the two 
treatment groups for both the pivotal clinical studies. CHMP considered that the identified major 
protocol deviations in the TP-434-008 study and the TP-434-025 study did not have any major 
influence on the overall conclusion on the benefit-risk assessment of eravacycline. 
The mean duration of the study drug was 7.6 days and compliance was over 80% in all subjects, with 
the mean value being over 99% in both treatment arms in study TP-434-008. Equal figures were 
observed in study TP-434-025 for compliance and the mean duration of treatment was 7.2 days. 
There were differences between treatment arms with regards to prior and concomitant antibacterial 
treatment in favour of the eravacycline group. The proportion of subjects that had received 
antibacterial medications prior to the first dose in the CE-TOC population was 49.0% vs. 47.5% for the 
eravacycline and ertapenem groups, respectively in study TP-434-008 and 54.4% and 49.3% for the 
eravacycline and meropenem groups, respectively in study TP-434-025. Concomitant systemic 
antibacterial medications use from the first dose of study drug through the TOC Visit in the MITT 
population was 13.0% of the subjects in the eravacycline treatment group and 8.6% of the subjects in 
the ertapenem treatment group in study TP-434-008. In the MITT population in study TP-434-025 the 
corresponding figures were 8.0% and 8.4% in the eravacycline and meropenem groups, respectively. 
According to the protocol patients could receive up to 24 hours of effective antibiotics prior to 
randomisation without being excluded. Thereafter concomitant antimicrobial treatment was not 
accepted, with the exception of cases with failure, prophylaxis for unrelated procedures and for agents 
with no systemic exposure. Prior antibacterial treatment in the MITT population has been presented. 
From these data it is observed that the majority of patients received short-term antibacterial treatment 
prior to first dose of study drugs while a limited number received longer antimicrobial treatment for 
AEs and prophylaxis.  
Baseline demographic characteristics were comparable between treatment groups. In study TP-434-
008, the typical subject was a male Caucasian aged 55 years. Only 10% of the subjects were above 75 
years old. Approximately 27% had complicated appendicitis (below the cap of 30%) and 73% had 
other site of infection of which nearly 40% had intraabdominal abscess, ~30% peritonitis, ~20% 
complicated cholecystitis and ~10% to ~15% each of gastric/duodenal perforation or intestinal 
perforation. The baseline characteristics were similar in study TP-434-025, with the exception of the 
site of infections. Approximately 40% in both treatment groups had complicated appendicitis (capped 
at 50%), with other dominating diagnoses being intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis. 
Based on APACHE II score, the severity of infections was low, with 10-15% of subjects having scores 
above 10 and only a few patients having scores above 15. Also less than 10% in each treatment arm 
were bacteraemic. The fact that the majority of patients included in the study had mild to moderate 
cIAIs, could question the representativeness of the current patient population in regards to patients 
with more severe cIAI. The limitations of the studied populations are described in the Xerava SmPC 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 95/134 
 
 
 
 
 
section 4.4. Also the number of patients with infections originating from the appendix from the two 
clinical studies is included. 
Approximately 80% of all randomised subjects had at least one baseline bacterial pathogen that was 
considered to cause cIAI and, as would be expected for cIAI, 70% of subjects in each treatment group 
had polymicrobial infections. Gram-negative aerobes, Gram-positive aerobes and anaerobes were 
isolated from ~80%, ~50% and ~50% of subjects, respectively. Pathogens belonging to 
Enterobacteriaceae were most frequently isolated, with E. coli being the most commonly isolated 
species. 
The number of subjects in each analysis population was similar between treatment groups. Close to 
100% of randomised patients were included in the MITT populations and nearly 90% were included in 
the CE populations confirming reasonable compliance to the study protocol. As noted above, approx. 
80% had at least one baseline bacterial pathogen considered to cause cIAI (micro-ITT population). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Clinical cure in the MITT population at TOC in study TP-434-008 were 87.0% in the eravacycline group 
and 88.8% in the ertapenem group. The corresponding figures in the CE population were 92.9% and 
94.5%, respectively. In study TP-434-025 clinical cure was approximately 92 % and 96-97% in both 
arms in the MITT population and CE populations, respectively. 
The results of the sensitivity analyses were supportive of the primary analyses results. Without being 
very conservative, no additional analysis of the primary endpoint is considered necessary based on the 
definition of the primary endpoint (implying failure imputation), the high clinical response rates (in 
both treatment arms), the fact that the conclusion of non-inferiority was shown in both the MITT and 
the CE-TOC analysis in combination with the seemingly high both study and treatment compliance.  
There was a trend of higher clinical cure rate in patients with 0-1 sign of systemic infection observed in 
both treatment groups in both populations. The only exception was the cure rate for patients in the 
eravacycline group (MITT population) in study TP-434-008, which was lower in patients with 0-1 sign 
of systemic infection (86.1%) compared to patients with ≥ 2 signs of systemic infection (88.2%). The 
lower limit of the 95% CI for the difference between the eravacycline and ertapenem group did not 
exceed -12.5% (-5.9 [-13.4, 1.4]). This was, however, not seen for the corresponding patient and 
treatment group in the CE-TOC population. 
In sub-population analyses (including age, gender, race, geographic region, site of infection, 
abscess/no abscess, APACHE II score, renal function, and prior antibacterial treatment) no major 
clinically meaningful differences were detected. The response rates were similar, but lower in patients 
with renal impairment. 
When clinical response was evaluated at the EOT, TOC, and Follow-up Visits in the ITT, MITT, micro-
ITT, CE-EOT (or TOC), and ME-EOT (or TOC) populations in study TP-434-008, it was noted that the 
difference in clinical cure rates between the eravacycline and ertapenem treatment groups increased 
from TOC to FU for all analysis populations. In the MITT and CE-TOC populations, the difference was 
mainly explained by the addition of 12 and 9 subjects with an indeterminate outcome, respectively in 
the eravacycline treatment arm and a lower number of additional indeterminates for the ertapenem 
treatment group (2 additional cases for each analysis population). There was only one additional failure 
in the eravacycline treatment arm, whereas there were no additional failures in the ertapenem 
treatment arm. Here, a 95% CI was used instead of a 99% CI and it did not seem unreasonable that 
the lower limit of a 99% CI would have been below the NI margin. Considering that it is of utmost 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 96/134 
 
 
 
 
 
importance that the treatment effect remains at later time-points and since the application at the time 
of initial assessments relied on a single pivotal study the applicant was requested to recalculate the 
differences in clinical cure rates for the MITT and CE populations at the different visits using adjusted 
99% CIs and discuss the reasons for the lower response rate at the later visit. The reason for the 
higher number of indeterminates in the eravacycline arm was moreover to be discussed. A comparison 
to the corresponding results in the now completed IGNITE4 study (TP-434-025) was further asked for. 
In its response, the applicant did not present clinical cure rates with, as initially requested, 99% CIs. 
This was justified by the applicant by the fact that the results of two pivotal studies had now been 
submitted. The use of 95% CIs is accepted by CHMP. It can be noted that the same trend to a lower 
response over time was found in the completed cUTI study (TP-434-010). The applicant has argued 
that the lower response detected in that study could be the lower exposure secondary to oral 
administration after IV to oral switch.  
Favourable per-subject microbiological response at the TOC visit for the micro-ITT population was in 
the same range as the favourable clinical response in the MITT population for eravacycline and 
ertapenem/meropenem groups. This is not surprising because of the overall high favourable clinical 
response rate and that the favourable microbiological response was derived from clinical success in 
almost all cases. 
Favourable per pathogen microbiological response ranged from 85% to 100% in all treatment groups 
for the majority of pathogens in both studies. 
Also subjects with bacteraemia at baseline had a high microbiological favourable response rate, 
however, in general < 10% of the patients in both treatment groups in both studies had diagnosed 
bacteraemia. 
The applicant has proposed a list of pathogens for inclusion in the SmPC section 5.1. The incidence of 
pathogens in baseline samples and in literature reports has been summarized. Microbiologically 
favourable response at TOC by baseline pathogen has also been presented for pooled data from the 
pivotal studies and from mono-microbial and poly-microbial infections in the studies. 
CHMP was of the view that the list should be rationalised with regard to the pathogens considered 
relevant to cIAI, for which antibiotic activity has been established in vitro and for which clinical efficacy 
is established. 
The difficulty of establishing the relevance of specific pathogens for cIAI, which often yields poly-
microbial cultures (approximately 70% of cases in the clinical programme for Xerava), is 
acknowledged. This is further complicated by the unclear impact of surgery on clinical outcome.  
CHMP considered that clinical efficacy has been established in cIAI for Escherichia coli, viridans 
Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella 
pneumoniae.  
Concerning the section ‘Antibacterial activity against other relevant pathogens’, CHMP agreed that the 
only relevant information to be included in the SmPC is about the fact that in vitro data indicate that 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not susceptible to eravacycline. 
In a supportive study of community acquired cIAI two regimens of eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg q24h and 
1.0 mg/kg i.v. q12h) were compared with ertapenem (1.0 g i.v. q24h). The clinical cure rates at the 
TOC visit were high and generally comparable between treatment arms for the primary analysis 
population (ME population) and secondary analysis populations (MITT and CE populations). The 
microbiological response was similar to the clinical response. 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 97/134 
 
 
 
 
 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
PTA simulations based on preclinical PK/PD targets and human PK data did not provide support for the 
proposed dose regimen to fully cover for pathogens belonging to the wild-type populations.  
Still eravacycline showed non-inferiority to ertapenem and meropenem for the treatment of 
complicated intra-abdominal infections in two pivotal studies. For both studies similar clinical and 
microbiological cure rates were achieved and in general similar results in important sub-populations 
were observed. Therefore CHMP considered that in the setting of cIAI, as an adjunct to surgical 
management, the efficacy of eravacycline has been sufficiently established to infer clinical benefit. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Earlier investigations  - safety pool: 
The safety and efficacy of i.v. eravacycline in subjects with cIAI were initially evaluated in a single 
phase 2 and a single phase 3 study.  
It should be noted that eravacycline was also developed for the treatment of complicated urinary tract 
infection (cUTI), including pyelonephritis. A phase 3 study evaluating i.v. with transition to oral (p.o.) 
eravacycline in subjects with cUTI, including pyelonephritis, has been completed. The applicant 
informed that the primary endpoint was not met and the development program for cUTI was ongoing. 
The safety data from the cUTI study are included, where appropriate, in addition to data from studies 
for cIAI. 
The safety data were derived from 19 clinical studies according to three analysis pools (Table S1). The 
analysis pools were composed as following: 
1)  All Phase 1 pool - integrated pool of all Phase 1 healthy volunteers who received eravacycline, 
regardless of dose or route of administration 
2)  All Phase 2/Phase 3 pool – integrated pool of Phase 2 and Phase 3 subjects with cIAI or cUTI who 
received eravacycline, regardless of dose or route of administration 
3) cIAI Only Phase 2/Phase 3 pool – Phase 2 and Phase 3 subjects with cIAI by dose of eravacycline 
received (i.v. only) 
Clinical studies pooled in the cIAI only group tested in case of one study, two different dose regimens 
of eravacycline i.v. and compared the outcome against ertapenem:

Updated investigations – new study study TP-434-025 and new integrated safety 2/3 pool: 
The  applicant  has  studied  and  presented  the  results  for  study  TP-434-025  and  has  additionally 
performed  a  novel  pooled  analysis  obtaining  a  new integrated phase  2/3 pool. The  safety  pool of  the 
additionally submitted study TP-434-025 is composed of the MITT population, which has received any 
dosage of study drug. 
New  study  results  are  evaluated  in  the  following  in  comparison  to  the  safety  results  obtained  in  the 
former safety phase 2/ 3 pool, named as safety pool 1 in the updated evaluations and in comparison to

Patient exposure 
Earlier investigations – old phase 2/3 pools (referred to as safety pool 1 when comparing 
with the new integrated safety pool in the following): 
Overall, 1284 subjects have been exposed to eravacycline in completed studies, thereof 926, who 
obtained at least 1.5mg/kg q24 in a multiple i.v. dose setup. The mean duration of exposure was 
consistent and approximately 7 days across the Phase 2/Phase 3 studies.

TEAEs occurred overall more often in the eravacycline treated subjects, with events beginning between 
2 and 7 days after the start of study medication. 
The most commonly reported events in both treatment groups were nausea,  vomiting and diarrhoea, 
with  nausea  and  vomiting  at  higher  rates  in  the  eravacycline  group  compared  to  the  active 
comparator. Also notable are a higher frequency of headache, infusion site phlebitis and an increase of 
lipase  and  amylase  in  eravacycline  treated  subjects  with,  however,  overall  low  absolute  and  relative 
incidences. 
Overall observation in the total safety population: 
The TEAE rate was slightly higher in the eravacycline group compared to the meropenem group in both 
the newly submitted study and the integrated safety pool and confirmed the results seen in the safety 
pool 1. The rate of severe TEAEs and SAEs as well as SAEs leading to discontinuation of the drug was 
similar  in  both  treatment  groups  and  comparable  to  the  rates  seen  in  study  pool  1.  4  SAEs  in  the 
eravacycline arm and one SAE in the meropenem arm led to death in the submitted study. However, 
none of the SAEs has been evaluated as related to study drug by the investigator, which is endorsed 
by CHMP. Narratives to the cases of death in the newly submitted study have been investigated by the 
CHMP. No one of the cases was associated to eravacycline.

Furthermore,  similar  results  compared  to  safety  pool  1  were  obtained  when  investigating  the  SOCs 
with the highest TEAE incidences in the eravacycline and meropenem arm: While the order of SOC type 
with  the  greatest  number  of  TEAEs  were  comparable  in  both  study  arms  (Gastrointestinal  disorders, 
general  conditions  including  administration  site  conditions,  infections),  the  TEAE  incidences  in  the 
respective  SOC  group  were  in  several  cases  higher  in  the  eravacycline  arm  compared  to  the 
meropenem  group,  i.e.  for  Gastrointestinal  disorders;  General  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions;  Infections  and  infestations;  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  and  skin  and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders. These results are comparable with safety pool 1.

Earlier observations: 
For the many of the entities listed above no significant safety concerns arose (i.e. pseudomembranous 
colitis (one case in the comparator arm), pseudotumor cerebri (no cases), photosensitivity (no cases), 
acute renal failure (3 cases in the comparator arm)).  
Overall observation in the total safety population: 
No new safety signal is detected for the mentioned three diagnosis after submission of the new study.   
To mention are specifically: 
Hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reaction (based on data from the integrated phase 2/3 
safety pool): 
Allergic/hypersensitivity reactions were rarely (twice, “rash”) observed in the eravacycline arm and 
evaluated as mild in the submitted study. This observation is in agreement with observations made in 
safety pool 1. There, hypersensitivity reactions occurred as well in low frequency and were evaluated 
as mild to moderate. No case of anaphylactic reaction was observed 
As shown in Table S - Add 3 the rate of allergic reactions is overall comparable and low between 
eravacycline and comparator as shown in the integrated analysis pool.  
Thus, it was requested to include rash as  uncommon AEs (frequency 1/1000 to 1/100) in the Xerava 
SmPC,  section  4.8.  The  categorization  of  AEs  according  to  frequencies  should  be  in  this  context  in 
general  performed  based  on  the  frequency  observed  in  the  all  cIAI  only  pool.  The  applicant  has 
implemented both aspects in the SmPC. Furthermore, based on data showing that 9/1176 individuals 
have  been  categorized  as  hypersensitive  in  the  integrated  phase  2/3  pool,  the  applicant  has  listed 
hypersensitivity  as  uncommon  (<1%)  AE  in  the  SmPC,  section  4.8  based  on  the  frequency  of 
hypersensitivity seen in the new cIAI only pool, which is endorsed.

Hepatic disorders were equally distributed in cases and controls with a frequency of 1.0% 
(eravacycline) and 1.1% (comparator). The majority of TEAEs were reported  in single subjects in the 
eravacycline group (exception: prothrombin time prolonged in ≥1 subject in the eravacycline group 
(0.2%) versus no subjects in the comparator group). None of the events were serious or severe or led 
to treatment discontinuation.  
Two eravacycline-treated subjects and one comparator-treated subject satisfied the criteria for 
potential drug-induced liver injury as defined by Hy’s Law. One of the eravacycline subjects already 
met the criteria at baseline, prior to eravacycline treatment start.  
Overall observation in the total safety population: 
No  changes  in  the  distribution  of  liver  disorders  are  detected  in  the  latest  submitted  study  and  the 
integrated phase 2/3 pool. 
Liver enzymes were in the majority of cases within the normal range in both the eravacycline and the 
meropenem  arm.  Shifts  in  2 toxicity  degrees  are  again  observed  for  ASAT  and  ALAT  under  Xerava  in 
the  recently  submitted  study,  however  in  a  comparable  frequency  compared  to  meropenem  and  in 
comparable  frequency  as  observed  in  safety  pool  1.  A  toxicity  grade  >  2  is  very  rarely  observed  for 
ASAT, ALAT and bilirubin in both study arms. Of note, bilirubin elevations occurred again more often in 
Xerava  treated  subjects  compared  to  subjects  treated  with  meropenem.  These  were  mostly  mild  to 
moderate in degree. These results confirm the observations made in safety pool 1. 
Two subjects in the eravacycline treatment arm and 1 subject in the meropenem arm met the criteria 
of drug induced liver injury. One subject in the eravacycline arm met DILI criteria already at screening. 
Overall 5 subjects under eravacycline and 2 subjects treated with comparator developed potential DILI 
according to Hy’s law in the integrated phase 2/3 pool. An evaluation of the narratives of patients with 
laboratory  signs  of  DILI  treated  with  eravacycline  allows,  however,  only  in  one  case  to  evaluate  the 
association between eravacycline and signs of DILI as possible. Thus, no clear safety signal is detected 
here at this stage. 
Acute pancreatitis (SMQ) 
Earlier obervations 
a) 
All Phase 2 and 3 pool 
Three subjects in the ervacycline group and 1 subject in the comparator group were diagnosed with 
pancreatitis in the All Phase 2 and 3 pool.  
Of the three acute pancreatitis TEAEs among eravacycline-treated subjects, one resolved during 
eravacycline treatment, and a second one began 13 days after the completion of eravacycline 
treatment in a subject who also had evidence of acute pancreatitis at screening. Both were 
attributable to the underlying disease or a complication of surgery. The applicant considers that 
neither case is likely to have been caused by eravacycline treatment. In the third case, symptoms and 
laboratory abnormalities developed near the end of the planned course of eravacycline treatment in a 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 109/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subject who received both i.v. and p.o. eravacycline; treatment was completed and the event 
resolved. In view of these results the company concludes that there is no clear association between 
eravacycline treatment and pancreatitis. 
b) 
All phase 1 pool 
No cases of acute pancreatitis were seen in the All Phase 1 pool.   
Updated observation and evaluation based on the total safety population: 
As seen in safety pool 1, elevations of lipase and amylase were observed under treatment with 
eravacycline in the newly submitted study, which were in their frequency comparable to meropenem 
and similar to the frequencies seen in study pool 1. The aspect of lipase elevations is also well reflected 
in the pooled analyses taking all phase 2 and 3 studies into account, showing that 19% of the 
individuals reached mild lipase elevations up to 2x and 13% of individuals showed lipase elevation >2 
under the study period (rates are comparable to comparator treatment). Pancreas enzyme elevations 
resulted in the reporting of 5 TEAEs in the newly submitted study (4 eravacycline, 1 meropenem), 
which all resolved. One TEAE of lipase elevation was evaluated as severe in the eravacycline arm. 
While rates of lipase and amylase elevations are comparable between eravacycline and comparators in 
the integrated phase 2/3 pool, the number of observed pancreatitis cases is higher under eravacycline 
(n=7) compared to comparator treatment (n=3) as shown in the integrated safety pool. Of note, 2 
TEAEs of pancreatitis were observed under treatment with eravacycline in the current study (none in 
the meropenem arm), which in one case was evaluated as SAE. Based on the narrative evaluation to 
pancreatitis cases under eravacycline submitted by the applicant, the association of pancreatitis with 
eravacycline is not likely (n=2)/not clearly evaluable (n=1) in three cases, was possible in one case 
and likely in an additional case. For two subjects presenting elevated pancreatic enzymes together with 
nausea/vomitus which have been evaluated as pancreatitis, narratives have not been submitted. A 
warning of pancreatitis as a class effect of tetracyclines is currently included in the Xerava SmPC 
section 4.4. Based on the observation that rare cases of pancreatitis have been observed under 
eravacycline treatment, which can be evaluated as at least possibly associated, and based on the 
known class effect for tetracyclines, CHMP requested to include pancreatitis into section 4.8 of the 
Xerava SmPC as uncommon occurring adverse event, which was subsequently implemented by the 
applicant. 
Thrombophlebitis (CMQ) 
Earlier observations: 
Thrombophlebitis has been reported in patients treated with eravacycline. 
a)  All Phase 2 and 3 pool 
TEAEs meeting the Thrombophlebitis CMQ occurred in 2.1% of subjects in the eravacycline group and 
in 0.3% of subjects belonging to the comparator group. The most frequently reported event by PT was 
phlebitis. Other reported events included thrombophlebitis and deep vein thrombosis. None of the 
events was assessed as severe or led to treatment discontinuation. Deep vein thrombosis was 
reported as serious in two subjects in the eravacycline group. Of note, pulmonary embolism was only 
observed in the comparator arm (2 cases).  
The majority of the remaining events is captured by the Infusion-site complication CMQ, and reflects 
localized issues associated with the administration of i.v. eravacycline. There were two exceptions 
which included non-serious saphenous vein phlebitis (PT phlebitis) and non-serious right leg 
thrombophlebitis (PT thrombophlebitis superficial).

b)  All Phase 1 pool 
3.6% of subjects experienced TEAEs meeting the Thrombophlebitis CMQ criteria. All of the reported 
events (by PT) were phlebitis; the majority was moderate in severity, all were non-serious, and none 
led to study drug discontinuation.

Individuals receiving eravacycline i.v. experienced more often infusion complications such as phlebitis 
and thrombophlebitis than individuals treated with active comparator. Infusion site reactions are 
included in the Xerava SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.8. 
Overall observation in the total safety population: 
As observed in safety pool 1, reactions at the infusion site were more often observed in the 
eravacycline arm compared to the comparator arm. Of note, 6 cases of infusion site thrombosis 
were observed in the current study. Thus, the number of infusion site thrombosis is summed up to 
10 cases under eravacycline and 1 case under comparator in the integrated phase 2/3 safety pool. 
Phlebitis, thrombophlebitis and infusion site reactions are already included in the Xerava SmPC 4.8 as 
possible site effect. 
Nausea and vomiting (CMQ): 
Earlier observations: 
a)        Phase 2 and 3 pool 
TEAEs meeting the nausea and vomiting CMQ criteria occurred  in 15.6% (13.6% / 6.6%) of 
eravacycline subjects and in 3.6% (2.5% / 1.9%) of the comparator pool. These events were typically 
observed shortly after treatment initiation, all were non-serious, and the majority was mild to 
moderate in intensity. 1.1% of the eravacycline group  and 0.4% of the comparator group 
discontinued study drug treatment due to these side effects. Rates of nausea and vomiting observed 
in eravacycline treatment groups in the cIAI  population who received only i.v. eravacycline were 
lower than in the Phase 2/Phase 3 pool  ( both i.v. and p.o. treatment with eravacycline). 
b)  All Phase 1 pool 
27.9% of subjects experienced nausea, vomiting and retching. All of the events were non-serious. A 
single event of nausea was assessed as severe; all other events were mild or moderate in severity. 
TEAEs in 2.5% of subjects led to study drug discontinuation. The majority of subjects in the All Phase 1 
pool who  discontinued due to TEAEs received multiple doses of oral eravacycline, including subjects 
who received doses above the therapeutic dose.

TEAEs meeting the nausea and vomiting occurred 3.5 times more often in eravacycline iv treated 
subjects compared to the comparator pool and had with 15.6% a high incidence rate. 
Nausea and vomiting are adequately mentioned as often occurring side effects in the Xerava SmPC 
section 4.8. 
Overall observation in the total safety population: 
Nausea and vomiting were also in the newly submitted study and in the integrated safety pool an often 
occurring side effect. The frequencies remained similar. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Earlier observations: 
a)  Deaths 
Deaths were reported for 7 subjects (0.8%) who received eravacycline treatment and 6 subjects 
(0.8%) who received comparator treatment. The only TEAE which led to death that was reported in 
more than one subject was pulmonary embolism, experienced by two subjects in the comparator 
group.

The overall incidence of serious TEAEs was similar for the treatment groups. A total of 33  subjects 
(3.6%) in the eravacycline group and 24 subjects (3.0%) subjects in the comparator group 
experienced serious TEAEs.

haemorrhage, abdominal abscess, pneumonia and wound dehiscence (all in both  eravacycline and 
comparator groups), deep vein thrombosis and ileus (in the eravacycline group only),  and pulmonary 
embolism (in the comparator group only). No serious TEAEs were considered as  related to 
eravacycline. 
b) All Phase 1 pool 
There were no serious TEAEs in the All Phase 1 pool. 
Overall observation in the total safety population: 
Five  cases  of  death  were  noted  under  eravacycline  (4)  and  meropenem  (1)  in  the  newly  submitted 
study  TP-434-025,  for  which  an  association  to  study  drug  treatment  is  not  likely.  Altogether  11 
(eravacycline) and 7 (comparator) deaths have been noted in the integrated phase 2/3 pool. Thus the 
rate of mortality is similar and, as demonstrated in table S12, covering a wide range of different SOCs 
in both arms. No safety signal is detected here. 
As observed in safety pool 1, SAEs occurred equally often in both study arms of the newly submitted 
study, covering a wide range of different SOCs and PTs. SAEs were in the majority of cases only seen 
once  within  each  PT.  SAEs  within  the  SOC  pulmonary  diseases  occurred  slightly  more  often  in  the 
eravacycline  arm  (4x,  1,6%)  compared  to  the  meropenem  arm  (2x,  0.8%),  covering,  however, 
different PTs in both study arms. Overall, no new safety signal is detected here. 
Laboratory findings 
a Overall observation in the total safety population: 
No safety concerns arose for electrolytes, blood cell count or parameters related to renal function.

In the eravacycline group ALT or AST elevations >3, >5 and 10 times > ULN, respectively, were 
comparable to the comparator group. Furthermore, 42 subjects (4.5%) and 16 subjects (1.7%) 
showed elevations in direct bilirubin >1.5 times and > 2 times of the ULN, respectively, with lower 
frequencies in the comparator group (1.5% and 0.9%).   
In the cIAI pool post-baseline elevations in direct bilirubin >1.5 times the ULN were observed for 25 
subjects (7.7%) in the eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg q12h group, 10 subjects (18.9%) in the eravacycline 
1.5 mg/kg q24h group, and 10 subjects (3.4%) in the ertapenem group. Post-baseline elevations in 
direct bilirubin >2 times the ULN were observed for 10 subjects (3.1%) in the eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg 
q12h group, five subjects (9.4%) in the eravacycline 1.5 mg/kg q24h group, and six subjects (2.0%) 
in the ertapenem group.  
b)  All Phase 1 pool 
No clinically significant shifts of liver values were detected in the all phase 1 pool. 
Overall, AST and ALT elevations are noted for eravacycline, which are mostly in the range 3x to 5x > 
ULN and occurred in about the same frequency as observed for the active comparator. Specifically in 
the cIAI group, higher relative incidences of strong ALT and AST elevations 5x and 10x > ULN are 
seen for the dosage 1.5 mg/kg q24h compared to active comparator, which are, however, observed 
in a low absolute number of individuals.  
Bilirubin values were clearly higher in the eravacycline arm in the all phase 2 and 3 pool (>1.5 and 
>2 ULN: 6.2% eravacycline/ 2.4% active comparator) as well as in the cIAI eravacycline arm 
compared to active comparator. Also here and of note stronger elevations are especially seen in the 
eravacycline 1.5 mg/kg q24h arm within the cIAI group. 
Two  eravacycline  treated  subjects  (one  of  them  already  at  baseline)  and  one  subject  in  the 
comparator arm fulfilled the criteria for drug induced liver injury (DILI). Thus, a higher frequency of 
DILI is not induced by eravacycline.  CHMP requested to include elevations of AST, ALT and bilirubin 
as common events in section 4.8 of the Xerava SmPC, which has been subsequently implemented by 
the applicant.  
Overall and updated observation in the total safety population: 
Liver enzymes were in the majority of cases within the normal range in both the eravacycline and 
the meropenem arm in the newly submitted study TP-434-025. Shifts in 2 toxicity degrees are again 
observed for ASAT and ALAT under eravacycline in the recently submitted study, however in a 
comparable frequency compared to meropenem and in comparable frequency as observed in safety 
pool 1. A toxicity grade > 2 is very rarely observed for ASAT, ALAT and bilirubin in both study arms. 
Of note, bilirubin elevations occurred again more often in eravacycline-treated subjects compared to 
subjects treated with meropenem. These were mostly mild to moderate in degree. These results 
confirm the observations made in safety pool 1. 
The applicant has discussed whether AST, ALT and bilirubin should be listed as side effect in section 
4.8  of  the  SmPC.  The  view  of  the  applicant  is  endorsed  that  both  liver  enzyme  and  bilirubin/aPTT 
elevations  were  in  the  majority  of  cases  of  mild  nature  and  not  associated  with  any  AEs.  Of  the 
patients  meeting  Hy’s  law  criteria  only  one  patient  could  be  evaluated  as  possibly  related  to 
eravacycline.  Although  in  most  cases  of  rather  mild  nature,  AST,  ALT  and  bilirubin  elevations  are 
relatively  often  observed  under  eravacycline.  The  applicant  has  subsequently  listed  AST,  ALT  and 
bilirubin  elevations  as  uncommon  events  in  the  Xerava  SmPC,  which  was  endorsed  by  CHMP  based 
on the frequencies of all TEAEs observed in the cIAI only pool.

Earlier observations: 
a) 
All phase 2 and 3 pool 
Baseline mean values for amylase, triacylglycerol lipase, GGT, LDH, and ALP  in eravacycline-treated 
subjects and comparator-treated subjects were within  the normal range. For most of the analytes, 
there were no changes from baseline at any  time point that resulted in mean values outside the 
normal range. 
The relative amount of worst lipase elevations (Grade 3 and 4) was similar between eravacycline and 
the active comparator group. Subjects in the eravacycline group displayed clinically notable 
abnormalities of lipase and amylase (defined as a ≥2-grade increase from  baseline) more frequently.

Baseline mean values for amylase, lipase, ALP, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and gamma- 
glutamyltransferase (GGT) in subjects were within the normal range. Six subjects in the All Phase 1 
Pool had at least a 2-grade worsening or Grade 4 abnormality in  lipase; one of these subjects also 
had at least a 2-grade worsening or Grade 4 abnormality in  amylase. One subject in the Phase 1 QTc 
study (Study TP-434-004) had 3-grade worsening in  lipase during the moxifloxacin dosing period 
(comparator). 
Overall observation in the total safety population: 
As  mentioned  above in  the  section  “pancreatitis” lipase  and  amylase  elevations  are  confirmed in  the 
newly submitted study and the integrated safety pool (similar frequency as observed in safety pool 1). 
In view of the additional observations of pancreatitis cases under eravacycline an update of the Xerava 
SmPC  section  4.8  has  been  requested  by  CHMP  (pancreatitis  as  uncommon  AE),  which  has  been

Mean baseline aPTT in subjects treated with eravacycline or comparator were in normal range. In 
eravacycline-treated patients subsequently measured aPTT values were slightly above the normal 
range (30.2 to 33.1 sec, normal range (24.3 to 30.4 sec)). Mean INR in eravacycline subjects where 
slightly above the normal range at baseline and  remained slightly above the normal range except for 
the Test of Cure visit (INR 1.16± 0.316, normal range (0.8-1.2)) and Follow-up visit (INR 1.12± 
0.280). In the comparator group, INR values were in general within the normal range. Of note, aPTT 
changes were pronounced in the 1.5mg/kg/24h dosage group (38.7 (±16.32) sec), change from 
baseline 7.0 sec) compared to the 1.0mg/kg/12h dosage group (33.3 (±11.03), change from 
baseline 3.6 sec) in the cIAI pool. 
b)  All Phase 1 pool 
Values for aPTT and INR were normal at baseline and changes from baseline at each study visit were 
generally small and not clinically significant.  
In summary, mild elevations of aPTT are noted with eravacycline in phase 2 and 3 studies, with more 
pronounced aPTT elevations seen in the 1.5 mg/kg/24 dosage group.  
Overall observation in the total safety population: 
aPTT values behaved similar in the newly submitted study and the integrated phase 2/3 pool. No new 
safety concern arose here.

SBP (-0.6 ±15.2 mmHg to 7.4 ±19.8 mmHg) or DBP (-1.3 ± 13.4 mmHg to 1.0 ± 13.7 mmHg) in 
those subjects treated with eravacycline or with comparator (SBP (-5.1 ± 14.5 mmHg to 2.2 ± 15.1 
mmHg) or DBP (-4.6 ± 11.8 mmHg to 0.4 ± 11.7 mmHg)) 
A similar pattern was observed for HR. For subjects treated with eravacycline the mean ± SD HR 
value was 82.6 ± 14.0 bpm (range 47 to 130 bpm) with variances from -1.9 ± 8.0 bpm to -17.3 ± 
16.3 bpm later on. For comparator treated subjects mean ± SD HR value was 81.9 ± 13.6 bpm 
(range 50 to 130 bpm) with a range from -1.3 ± 7.6 bpm to -17.2 ± 17.9 bpm at later time points.

The relative frequency for SBP and HR abnormalities in the verum and placebo group was comparable. 
11 subjects (3.1%) had a post-baseline DBP measurement of >20 mmHg increase from baseline 
compared to 1 subject (0.9%) in the placebo group. 
No systematic clinically significant changes in BP were observed compared to baseline in phase 1, 2 
and 3 studies. The rates of systolic and diastolic BP elevations were comparable in the eravacycline 
and in the comparator group. 
Of note, the rate of “bradycardic episodes” was twice as high in the eravacycline arm (1.5 mg/kg q24) 
compared to eravacycline 1.0 mg/kgq12h and active comparator (Table S16). Furthermore, the rate of 
bradycardic  episodes  was  in  general  higher  in  subjects  treated  with  eravacycline  compared  to  active 
comparator.  Bradycardic  episodes  are  currently  not  included  in  the  Xerava  SmPC.  At  CHMP  request, 
the  applicant  has  further  investigated  the  issue  of  bradycardic  episodes  in  relation  to  the  compound

and  has  shown  that  no  higher  risk  for  chronotropic  effects  of  Xerava  could  be  detected,  which  was 
endorsed by CHMP.  
Overall observation in the total safety population: 
While  patients  with  bradycardic  episodes  were  more  abundant  in  the  eravacycline  arm  (6.4%) 
compared  to  the  meropenem  arm  (2.8%)  of  the  newly  submitted  study,  the  rate  of  individuals 
exceeding the thresholds for vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate) are roughly 
comparable between study arms in the integrated phase 2/3 pool and especially in the updated cIAI 
only pool. Overall the majority of individuals were in the normal range in both the eravacycline and 
comparator  arm.  The  view  of  the  applicant  (answer  to  the question  “bradycardic  episodes”)  that  no 
safety signal is detected here was endorsed by CHMP.

Earlier observations: 
QT Interval Study TP-434-004: A Randomized, Placebo- and Positive-Controlled, Three-
Way, Crossover Study to Evaluate the Effects of an Intravenous Infusion of Eravacycline 
(TP-434) on Cardiac Repolarization in Healthy Male and Female Subjects: A Thorough 
QT/QTc Study 
No clinically significant prolongation of the QT interval corrected by individual formula (QTcI) was 
detected in healthy volunteers under i.v. eravacycline (study TP-434-004). After a single i.v. dose of 
eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg), the maximum placebo- adjusted mean change in QTcI interval at each 
post-dose time point was <10 msec (upper bound of the 1-sided 95% confidence interval [CI]). 
•  There was no evidence of clinically significant prolongation of the QT interval corrected by 
Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) or the QT interval corrected by Bazett’s formula (QTcB) demonstrated.

Time-matched placebo-adjusted mean changes from pre-dose in RR, PR, and QRS intervals 
following a single dose of eravacycline 1.5 mg/kg i.v. were generally small and similar to placebo. 
•  No subject had a QTcI interval >480 msec or a QTcI change from pre-dose >30 msec at any post-
dose timepoint following a single dose of eravacycline 1.5 mg/kg i.v. 
•  No subject had a QTcF or QTcB interval >480 msec or change from pre-dose >60 msec following 
eravacycline. 
Electrocardiograms – All Phase 2/Phase 3 Pool  
Of the 926 subjects in the eravacycline group, 20 subjects (2.2%) had an abnormal ECG finding at 
any study visit (including screening and baseline) and of the 796 subjects in the comparator group, 
19 subjects (2.4%) had an abnormal ECG finding at any study visit. 
No remarkable difference in ventricular rate or QRS duration between the eravacycline group and the 
comparator group at comparable visits were observed.  
• 
PR interval mean change from baseline was 1.3 (±26.7) msec in the eravacycline group and 
0.5 (±28.1) msec in the comparator group.  
•  QT interval mean change from baseline was 10.1 (±42.3) msec in the eravacycline group and 
6.2 (±39.8) msec in the comparator group.  
•  QTcF interval mean change from baseline was 2.7 (±28.1) msec in the eravacycline group and 
-1.3 (±24.0) msec in the comparator group. 
Electrocardiograms - cIAI Only Phase 2/Phase 3 Pool 
• 
PR interval mean change from baseline was 0.5 (±25.95) msec in the eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg 
q12h group, -1.1 (±29.15) in the eravacycline 1.5 mg/kg q24h group and -1.0 (±21.1) msec 
in the ertapenem group.  
•  QT interval mean changes from baseline were 16.7 (±43.8), 23.5 (±51.2) and 12.5 (±41.3) 
msec, respectively.  
•  QTcF interval mean changes from baseline were 3.0 (±25.9), 4.2 (±8.9) and 2.9 (±22.3) 
msec respectively. 
In view of these results no significant changes in QRS complexes, PR or QT intervals were observed 
in association with eravacycline.  
Overall observation in the total safety population: 
No new safety signal could be detected with regard to PQ, QT and QRS interval. 
Post-baseline  and  change  from  baseline  QTcB  value  distributions  were  similar  between  the 
eravacycline  and  meropenem  groups  in  the  newly  submitted  study  TP-434-025.  There  were  more 
Assessment report

subjects  in  the  eravacycline  group  with  a  >60  msec  increase  in  QTcB  (15/224  [6.7%]  and  10/222 
[4.5%]  subjects  for  the  eravacycline  and  meropenem  groups,  respectively);  however,  there  were 
more subjects in the meropenem group with a QTcB at the EOT Visit >500 msec (3/228 [1.3%] and 
6/227  [2.6%]  subjects  for  the  eravacycline  and  meropenem  groups,  respectively).  These  results 
reflect the results detected in the integrated safety pool 2/3 (of note, QTcF is calculated here). Here, 
at EOT 4 (480-500msec) and 2 (>500msec) subjects were detected in the eravacycline compared to 2 
(480-500msec)  and  2  (>500msec)  subjects  in  the  comparator  arm,  showing  relevant  elevated  Qtc 
values  when  scrutinizing  QTc  changes  at  every  treatment  day.  The  number  of  subjects  with  QTc 
values  >  480ms  was  overall  very  low  and  was  comparable  between  the  eravacycline  and  the 
comparator arm. No safety signal was detected. 
Safety in special populations 
a Earlier observations: 
No significant differences in the safety profile arose in association with gender, BMI, age or APACHE 
score. Furthermore Xerava appeared to be safe in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

Furthermore,  most  patients  with  severe  hepatic  impairment,  (Child-Pugh  Class  C)  have  not  been 
included  in  the  safety  pool,  thus  not  allowing  conclusions  on  the  safety  profile  in  patients  with 
markedly decreased liver function. 
For all races (Caucasian, Black/African, Asian and others) the most commonly reported TEAE related 
SOCs were Gastrointestinal Disorders. Of note, the applicant mentioned that the most commonly 
reported TEAEs were “increased lipase” in Asians in both the compound and comparator group (17.5%, 
16.7%). In contrast to this, TEAEs most commonly reported in Caucasians included nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoea and palpitations and nausea and abdominal abscess in low frequency in the Black/African 
American group.  
The  majority  of  the  patients  who  received  eravacycline  in  the  All  Phase  2/3  pool  were  Caucasian 
(93%;  861/926)  and  exposure  in  non-Caucasian  patients  has  therefore  been  limited.  Accordingly, 
meaningful  comparisons  between  patients  of  different  races/ethnicities  are  not  possible,  as  the  other 
groups  comprised  only  few  patients  each  (in  the  eravacycline  group  in  the  All  Phase  2/3  pool: 
black/African/American  16  patients  vs.  17  in  the  comparator  group,  Asian:  40  vs.  12  and 
Hispanic/Latino: 25 vs. 27). 
Pregnancy and lactation has not been systematically scrutinized with regard to the safety profile of 
Xerava. Two pregnancies were reported among eravacycline-treated subjects in subjects with cUTI. 
One pregnancy was electively terminated and the other pregnancy resulted in a healthy child.

Updated observations based on the integrated phase 2/3 safety pool: 
A trend towards a higher frequency of AEs is seen in association with higher BMI, which is however in 
agreement with a higher morbidity risk of this population. For sex and age no clear relationship to AE 
frequency is observed in the integrated phase 2/3 pool.  
The safety evaluation according to ethnicity is difficult to perform due to the still small subject number 
in the majority of subgroups. Overall TEAE frequencies and SOC representation after the mentioned 
stratifications reflect the results earlier obtained in safety pool 1. 
Subjects with APACHE II scores ≥10 treated with eravacycline 1.0 mg/kg q12h or comparator 
experienced more TEAEs than subjects with scores <10 treated at the same dose, consistent with a 
higher expected morbidity in these subjects. The same trend is observed for the comparator group. 
The rate of treatment discontinuation is low and comparable in the eravacycline arm and comparator 
arm. The rate of serious TEAEs is comparable in the low and high APACHE group treated with 
eravacycline. 
While the rate of TEAEs is higher in renal impaired individuals under eravacycline and stronger rising 
compared to the comparator arm, the rate of serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation remained comparable and low after stratifying according to renal function. 
In both study arms worse hepatic function is associated with a higher rate of TEAEs, which is slightly 
more pronounced in the eravacycline treated group regarding SAEs/deaths and study drug 
discontinuation. These observations are in agreement with the observations made in safety pool 1. 
Overall, no new safety signal was detected. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
CYP3A Induction 
In the clinical study TP-434-020, concomitant administration of the strong CYP 3A4/3A5 inducer 
rifampin (600 mg p.o. q24h for 10 days) induced eravacycline metabolism, leading to a decreased 
exposure following a single i.v. dose by approximately 25% and increased clearance (CL) by 
approximately 54%. However, the exposure following i.v. administration of eravacycline + rifampin 
overlaps with the exposure following eravacycline alone.  
In this study, safety assessments included AEs, clinical laboratory safety tests (haematology, serum 
chemistry, electrolytes, coagulation, urinalysis, and lipid profile), vital signs, physical examinations, 
and 12-lead ECGs. Three of the 12 subjects (25%) reported a single TEAE during the i.v. eravacycline 
portion of the study (nausea, polyuria and infusion site pain were each reported once). Only one of the 
12 subjects reported a TEAE (headache) during the co- administration of eravacycline and rifampin. All 
TEAEs were mild in severity and two (nausea and infusion site pain during the i.v. eravacycline portion) 
were assessed as related to study drug.  There were no SAEs or TEAEs leading to discontinuation. 
CYP3A Inhibition 
In study TP-434-016, concomitant administration of the strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole 200 mg 
p.o. q12 for 2 doses then q24h for 2 additional doses) had little impact on the PK of eravacycline (1.0 
mg/kg i.v. administered as two single doses 10 days apart) by reducing its conversion to its 
metabolites. This inhibition produced increases in Cmax and exposure to eravacycline of approximately 
5%. CL was decreased by approximately 23%.  
In this study, safety assessments included AEs, clinical laboratory safety tests (haematology, serum 
chemistry, electrolytes, coagulation, urinalysis, and lipid profile), vital signs, physical examinations, 
and 12-lead ECGs. Overall, four of 12 (33.3%) subjects in Part A (single i.v. dose of eravacycline) and 
four of 12 (33.3%) subjects in Part B (single oral dose of eravacycline) of the study experienced a 
Assessment report

TEAE. All TEAEs were considered mild or moderate in severity and those experienced during treatment 
periods that included eravacycline were consistent with the known safety profile of eravacycline. No 
deaths or SAEs occurred during the study. There were no clinically meaningful changes or significant 
abnormalities in clinical laboratory, vital signs, ECGs or physical examination results. 
Other mechanisms of interaction 
Eravacycline is not a substrate for the major human uptake or efflux transporters in vitro. Thus, co-
administration with inhibitors of these transporters is unlikely to affect plasma concentrations of 
eravacycline. Furthermore, eravacycline and its metabolites do not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6 or 3A4 in vitro, nor do they induce CYP1A2, 2B6 or 3A4 making interactions with medicinal 
products that are substrates for these enzymes unlikely. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The overall rate of discontinuation in the eravacycline group remains low in the integrated phase 2/3 
safety pool.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety  data  obtained  in  the  newly  submitted  study  (IGNITE-4)  overall  confirmed  the  safety  profile 
observed for eravacycline in former studies. Only a small part of individuals discontinued the study due 
to adverse drug reactions in both study arms. The rate of SAEs in both study arms was comparable.  
The  most  commonly  reported  adverse  events  for  eravacycline  belonged  to  the  SOCs  Gastrointestinal 
Disorders  and  General  reactions  including  infusion  site  reactions,  which  confirms  the  AE  profile 
observed  for  the  drug  in  the  former  safety  pool  1  (earlier  phase  2/3  pool).  As  observed  earlier, 
eravacycline  appears  to  induce  more  frequently  infusion  site  reactions  than  does  the  comparator,  as 
reflected  in  a  higher  rate  of  local  infusion  site  thrombosis/thrombophlebitis.  This  effect  was  also 
observed earlier in safety pool 1 and is included in the Xerava SmPC, section 4.8. 
As observed earlier in study pool 1, about 13% of subjects showed moderate lipase elevations. As also 
seen  in  safety  pool  1,  the  rate  was  comparable  to  the  rate  observed  under  treatment  with  the 
comparator.  In  five  cases  (4  eravacycline,  1  meropenem)  lipase  increases  resulted  in  AE  reporting  in 
the  current  study.  Analysis  of  the  integrated  safety  pool  including  the  results  of  all  studies 
demonstrates  a  numerically  higher  rate  of  pancreatitis  cases  compared  to  comparator  treatment  (7 
cases verses 3 cases). The study of narratives allowed the conclusion that one case in the eravacycline 
arm can be evaluated as possibly associated and one case as probably associated with study drug. A 
warning  was  introduced  in  the  Xerava  SmPC  section  4.4,  mentioning  that  medicines  belonging  to  the 
class  of  tetracyclines  may  have  the  potential  to  induce  pancreatitis.  Furthermore,  based  on  the 
knowledge  about  an  existing  class  effect  of  tetracyclines  and  pancreatitis  and  the  fact  the  cases  are 
observed  with  eravacycline,  an  inclusion  of  pancreatitis  in  section  4.8.  of  the  Xerava  SmPC  was 
requested and was subsequently implemented by the applicant. 
Liver  function  tests  were  in  the  majority  of  cases  in  the  normal  range  under  eravacycline  or 
meropenem  in  the  newly  submitted  study.  Increases  of  ASAT  and  ALAT  were  observed  under  both 
eravacycline and comparator which, however, were in the majority of cases of mild nature and equally 
distributed  in  frequency  between  eravacycline  and  comparator  arm  in  both  the  recently  submitted 
study  and  the  integrated  safety  pool.  Of  note,  the  frequency  of  bilirubin  increase  was  clearly  higher 
with  eravacycline  as  compared  to  meropenem.  However,  elevations  of  bilirubin  were  overall  mild. 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 124/134 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus, elevations of ASAT, ALAT and bilirubin were included as uncommon events in the Xerava SmPC 
section 4.8. 
Of note, altogether 5 (eravacycline) and 2 (comparator) potential DILI cases based on Hy’s law criteria 
were identified in the integrated phase 2/3 safety pool. The study of the narratives of the five potential 
DILI cases treated with eravacycline showed that only one of these cases can be evaluated as possibly 
related to eravacycline treatment. Thus, no safety signal was detected.  
As seen already earlier, a slight increase in aPTT values was again observed under eravacycline in the 
newly  submitted  study,  which  was,  however,  of  mild  nature  and  not  associated  with  a  higher  rate  of 
bleeding events in the study. In conclusion, no safety signal was detected here either.  
Overall, a low rate of hypersensitivity reactions and development of rash is observed with eravacycline 
according  to  the  updated  analysis  based  on  the  integrated  phase  2/3  safety  pool.  Although  low  in 
frequency and comparable in the study arms, CHMP requested to include hypersensitivity and rash in 
the Xerava SmPC, section 4.8. as uncommon AEs. The applicant has implemented the CHMP request.  
The number of subjects that developed a deep vein thrombosis under eravacycline or comparator has 
not  changed  in  the integrated  safety  pool  (4  cases under  eravacycline,  0  cases  under  treatment  with 
comparator)  as  no  new  cases  have  been  observed  in  the  newly  submitted  study  IGNITE-4.  As 
requested, the applicant has analysed clinical cases that developed DVT under treatment with Xerava 
regarding  cardiovascular  risk  factors,  provided  information  on  the  distribution  of  cardiovascular  risk 
factors in compound and control arms and evaluated the knowledge about any class specific effects on 
the  coagulation  system.  Cardiovascular  risk  factors between  compound  and  control  arm  appear to  be 
equally distributed. Based on the results obtained regarding the impact of eravacycline on coagulative 
parameters it can be concluded that Xerava does not enfold pro-thrombotic effects. Other tetracyclines 
have  been  shown  to  have  no  or  slightly  anti-coagulant  effects.    Patients  who  developed  DVT  under 
eravacycline  presented  several  cardiovascular  risk  factors  that  predispose  for  thrombotic  events  and 
have  in  the  majority  of  cases  not  received  pharmacological  DVT  prophylaxis.  The  frequency  of  DVT 
observed under eravacycline is comparable to background incidences observed in hospitalized patients. 
Based  on  these  observations  it  can  be  concluded  that  Xerava  do  not  enfold  pro-thrombotic  effects. 
Thus,  CHMP  agreed  that  the  view  of  the  MAH  not  to  include  DVT  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  can  be 
endorsed.  
In  conclusion,  taking  the  safety  outcome  of  all  phase  2  and  3  studies  as  analysed  in  the  integrated 
phase 2/3 safety study pool together, the safety profile of eravacycline was considered acceptable by 
CHMP. 
From the safety database the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD 
to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of eravacycline with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers eravacycline to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Xerava (eravacycline) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in adults. Intra-
abdominal infections include a wide spectrum of pathological conditions. In uncomplicated IAIs the 
infectious process only involves a single organ and does not proceed to the peritoneum. Complicated 
intra-abdominal infection extends beyond the hollow viscus of origin into the peritoneal space and is 
associated with either abscess formation or peritonitis. The peritoneal contamination may result from 
spontaneous perforation (e.g. appendicitis, perforated ulcer or diverticulitis), surgical intervention, or 
trauma. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The management of cIAIs usually involves surgical and/or percutaneous drainage, removal of diseased 
tissue and adequate source control in conjunction with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or 
antibiotic combinations. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main pivotal studies (TP-434-008 [IGNITE 1] and TP-434-025 [IGNITE 4]) were randomised, 
double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre studies to evaluate the non-inferiority of eravacycline to 
ertapenem (TP-434-008) or meropenem (TP-434-025) in patients with cIAI. The studies included adult 
patients hospitalised with cIAI, including intra-abdominal abscess or peritonitis in need for acute 
surgical or percutaneous intervention and at least one symptom of systemic inflammatory response. 
Subjects with most severe infections, including those with septic shock, were excluded from the 
studies. Patients with renal failure, significant hepatic disease or immunocompromised patients were 
also excluded.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Clinical cure rates in the MITT population were 87.0% in the eravacycline group and 88.8% in the 
ertapenem group in study TP-434-008. The corresponding numbers in the CE population (co-primary 
analysis population) were 92.9% and 94.5%, respectively. The lower limits of the 99% CI were -9.2% 
and -7.9%, respectively. The lower limits of the 99% CI were above the predefined NI-margin of -
12.5%. In study TP-434-025 clinical cure was approximately 92 % and 96-97% in both arms in the 
MITT population and CE populations, respectively. The difference in clinical cure rates between the 
eravacycline and meropenem groups in the MITT population at the TOC visit was 0.8 (95% CI: -4.1; 
5.8). 
The results of the sensitivity analyses were supportive of the primary analyses results. 
In sub-population analyses (including age, gender, race, geographic region, site of infection, 
abscess/no abscess, APACHE II score, renal function, and prior antibacterial treatment) no major 
clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups were detected. The response rates were 
similar for test and comparator regimens, but somewhat lower in treatment groups of patients with 
renal impairment. 
Favourable per-subject microbiological response at the TOC visit for the micro-ITT population was in 
the same range as the favourable clinical response in the MITT population for eravacycline and 
comparator groups. Favourable per pathogen microbiological response ranged from 85% to 100% in 
both treatment groups for the majority of pathogens. Favourable response rates below 85% in the 
pooled eravacycline groups were noted for E. cloacae (81.0%), E. faecalis (83.3%), E. faecium 
(84.4%), B. caccae (76.5%) and B. ovatus (74.4%). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
As previously noted, critical findings were noted during the inspection of one investigator site. The 
findings were considered to be site specific and were mainly due to lack of experience and GCP 
knowledge. Another aspect was the poor performance of the monitor responsible for this particular 
site. In the opinion of the GCP inspectors, elimination of the data from this site was sufficient and 
CHMP agreed that the issues from this site do not indicate the need of further inspections.  
In the assessment of new antibacterial agents, PK-PD analyses play a central role for dose-finding 
before embarking into clinical studies, but also to support the results from the pivotal studies that the 
dose is sufficient to cover for the wild-type population of organisms against which the agent is 
expected to be clinically active. Moreover, the same data are important for the determination of MIC 
breakpoints. PTA simulations based on preclinical PK/PD targets and human PK data did not provide 
support for the proposed dose regimen of eravacycline to cover for pathogens belonging to the wild-
type populations. Moreover, no relationships between MIC and outcome in the clinical programme were 
detected. Such relationships would have been valuable for the assessment of the adequacy of the 
dose, because of the lack of support from PK-PD analyses.  
The polymicrobial features of cIAI, the role of surgery in this infection as well as the lack of solid PK/PD 
support causes some uncertainties for which pathogens against which it would be considered 
acceptable to claim that eravacycline has been demonstrated to exert clinical activity. 
The study population in the pivotal study included a relatively limited number of “high-risk” patients 
such as elderly (aged ≥ 75 years), patients with renal impairment, and patients with high APACHE II 
Assessment report  
EMA/540193/2018  
Page 130/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
score. Considering the serious nature of cIAI, the reported mortality rate was low. Taken together, this 
implies that the majority of patients had infections of rather mild to moderate severity. Due to the 
limited number of patients with APACHE II score for ≥10 and in particular, ≥15, uncertainties remain 
with respect to an overall generalization of the study results to patients with more severe cIAI. The 
limitations of the study population have been included in section 4.4 of the Xerava SmPC. 
Results from the EOT and FU visits for the MITT and CE populations indicate that the clinical cure rate 
for the eravacycline arm in study TP-434-008 was lower than for the comparator and for both 
treatment arms in study TP-434-025. As compared to the TOC visit, clinical cure rates were also in 
general lower, in particular for the eravacycline arm in study TP-434-008. The difference between the 
treatment arms is influenced by the larger numbers of patients that were lost to follow-up in the 
eravacycline arm. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, 1284 subjects have been exposed to eravacycline in completed studies, thereof 926, who 
obtained at least 1.5 mg/kg q24 in a multiple i.v. dose setup. Taking the second submitted pivotal 
study into consideration with 250 additional individuals exposed to eravacycline, the novel integrated 
phase 2/3 safety pool is composed of 1176 individuals treated with at least 1.5 mg/kg q 24h 
eravacycline and 1045 individuals treated with comparator. The mean duration of exposure was 
consistent and approximately 7 days across the phase 2/3 studies included in the integrated safety 
pool. 
AEs of major importance to mention are side effects at the gastrointestinal tract (nausea, vomiting) 
and side effects at the injection site (such as phlebitis). 
Isolated cases of pancreatitis have been observed during eravacycline treatment which can be 
evaluated as at least possibly related to eravacycline. Further, other medicines of the class have been 
associated with such effects. Therefore a causal relation is a reasonable possibility. As a result, 
pancreatitis has been included in section 4.8 of the Xerava SmPC.  
Mild elevations of bilirubin are occurring with a higher frequency in the eravacycline arm compared to 
the comparator arm in the integrated phase 2/3 safety pool. As a result, elevations of bilirubin, AST 
and ALT have been included in the Xerava SmPC, section 4.8.  
As with other tetracyclines, use of Xerava in children under 8 years of age may cause permanent 
discolouration of the teeth-this has been included in section 4.4. of the SmPC. Similarly, 
pseudomembranous colitis (which is associated with administration of many antibacterials) has been 
included in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Xerava SmPC. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The exact frequency of drug induced pancreatitis is not entirely clear.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The similar clinical cure rates achieved with eravacycline and its comparators for the co-primary 
endpoint indicate that eravacycline is effective in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal 
infections.  
Determining which pathogens should be considered treatable with eravacycline is complicated by a 
high proportion of poly-microbial infections, the unclear impact of surgery on clinical outcome, and 
discrepancy between PK/PD predictions and clinical outcomes.  
CHMP considered that clinical efficacy has been established in cIAI for Escherichia coli, viridans 
Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella 
pneumoniae. 
High success rates may not be reproducible in subjects with more severe infections for which the 
antimicrobial chemotherapy most likely would be of higher importance relative to source control 
measures. Although the clinical cure rate was similar in patients with more severe cIAI in the phase 3 
study reflected by higher APACHE II scores, the number of patients with higher scores was low, which 
adds to this uncertainty. With regard to the sought indication, complicated intra-abdominal infections, 
the Xerava SmPC section 4.4 have been updated to accurately reflect limitations of the included study 
population. 
The safety profile of Xerava appears overall acceptable, with a low rate of SAEs, gastrointestinal and 
infusion site side effects as major AEs to mention.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A similar clinical and microbiological cure rate in the treatment of cIAI has been shown for eravacycline 
and its comparators in two pivotal studies and the safety profile appears overall acceptable.  
CHMP agrees that the benefit-risk balance of eravacycline is considered positive. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Xerava is positive by CHMP. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Xerava is favourable in the following indication: 
• 
treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in adults

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and 
II and PL 
efficacy, including all variations introduced since the 
marketing authorisation was granted, the CHMP considers 
by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Mepact in the 
treatment of ’’ high-grade resectable non-metastatic 
osteosarcoma after macroscopically complete surgical 
resection in children, adolescents and young adults used in 
combination with post-operative multi-agent chemotherapy 
remains favourable and therefore recommends the renewal 
of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances. The CHMP also recommends that one 
additional five-year renewal be required based on the 
limited post-marketing experience with Mepact, 
encompassing 415 patients in clinical practice to date. In 
addition the patient recruitment in the non-interventional 
surveillance study (C23003) tto assess the short and long-
term safety profile of Mepact is slow, with only 12 patients 
included to date. 
Pursuant to Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
2141/96, the Marketing Authorisation Holder submitted to 
the Agency on 02 July 2013 an application for the transfer 
of the Marketing Authorisation to Takeda France SAS,

characterized in paediatric and adult patients with 
osteosarcoma following a 2 mg/m2 intravenous infusion. 
In 28 osteosarcoma patients aged 6 to 39 years serum 
total (liposomal and free) mifamurtide concentrations 
declined rapidly with a mean half-life of 2.04 ± 0.456 
hours. BSA-normalized clearance and half-life were similar

across the age range and consistent with that determined 
in healthy adult subjects, supporting the recommended 
dose of 2 mg/m2. 
Metabolism of L-MTP-PE has not been studied in humans. 
After injection of radiolabelled liposomes containing 
mifamurtide, mean half-life of radiolabelled material was 
biphasic with an α phase of about 15 minutes and a 
terminal half-life of approximately 18 hours. 
The SmPC has been updated to reflect the above results.

Based on the results from C23001 and C2302 studies there 
information on the pharmacokinetics of Mepact in 
patients with renal and hepatic impairment following 
the assessment of the clinical study reports for 
studies C23001 and C23002, respectively. In 
addition, section 4.9 of the SmPC was updated with a 
reported case of overdose. This type II variation 
fulfils the post-authorisation measure FUM/004. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
are no clinically meaningful effects of mild to moderate 
renal (creatinine clearance (CrCL) ≥ 30ml/min) or hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B) on the 
pharmacokinetics of mifamurtide; therefore, dose 
adjustments are not necessary for these patients. However, 
as the variability in pharmacokinetics of mifamurtide is 
greater in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, and 
safety data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment is 
limited, caution when administering mifamurtide to patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment is recommended. As no 
pharmacokinetic data of mifamurtide is available in patients 
Page 9/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with severe renal or hepatic impairment, caution when 
administering mifamurtide to these patients is 
recommended. Section 4.2 of the SmPC has been updated 
with the above information and the results of the PK 
studies have been added in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Finally section 4.9 of the SmPC has been updated to 
include that a healthy adult volunteer accidentally received 
a single dose of 6.96 mg mifamurtide and experienced a 
reversible treatment-related event of orthostatic 
hypotension.

As of 5 March 2012 there were 205 patients who received 
febrile neutropenia as common adverse reaction 
further to the assessment of the 5th PSUR. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a

45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
mifamurtide in the clinical study (MTP OS-403) and 
approximately 171 patients who received mifamurtide 
during the post marketing experience. The frequency of 
febrile neutropenia from clinical studies is 1.5% (n=3) and 
the post marketing frequency is reported as 0.6% (n=1). 
For all three cases of febrile neutropenia reported in the 
clinical studies there were, besides mifamurtide use, 
additional factors that might also contributed to the events 
(i.e. concomitant use of ifosfamide, etoposide, concurrent 
toe cellutitis and recurrent febrile). Limited information 
(concomitant medications, medical history) was available 
for the one spontaneous reported febrile neutropenia case.

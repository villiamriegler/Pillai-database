RMP version to be assessed as part of this application:  
RMP Version number: 8.0 
Data lock point for this RMP: 31 March 2021 
Date of final sign-off: 17 August 2022 
Rationale for submitting an updated RMP: 
•  To convert the RMP to the new format according to Good Pharmacovigilance Practices 
Module V Revision 2. 
•  To update the key messages of the additional risk minimisation measure, ‘educational 
materials’, as requested in the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee Periodic 
Safety Update Report assessment report, procedure number 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001369/202004. 
•  To remove the training of field representatives and Dear Doctor letters as additional risk 
minimisation activities, as training of field representatives is not an additional risk 
minimisation measure per Good Pharmacovigilance Practices guidance, and Kyowa Kirin has 
not used Dear Doctor letters as a risk minimisation measure. 
•  To remove ‘paediatric population’, ‘pregnant and breastfeeding women’ and ‘patients with 
renal or hepatic impairment’ from missing information, as PecFent is not intended to be used 
in these populations. 
•  To remove ‘Serotonin syndrome induced by interaction between fentanyl and serotoninergic 
drugs’ as an important potential risk, since this safety concern is adequately addressed within 
the product information and is no longer linked to additional pharmacovigilance activities or 
risk minimisation measures. 
•  To remove ‘Circulatory depression, including severe bradycardia, hypotension and shock’ as 
an important identified risk, since this safety concern is adequately addressed within the 
product information and is not linked to additional pharmacovigilance activities or risk 
minimisation measures. 
Summary of significant changes in this RMP: 
 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
•  Updates to the post-authorisation exposure and the risks sections to align with the new data 
lock point. 
•  Changes to the key messages of additional risk minimisation measure ‘educational materials’. 
•  The training of field representatives and Dear Doctor letters have been removed as additional 
risk minimisation measures. 
•  Removal of ‘paediatric population’, ‘pregnant and breastfeeding women’ and ‘patients with 
renal or hepatic impairment’, previously classified as missing information. 
•  Removal of ‘Serotonin syndrome induced by interaction between fentanyl and serotoninergic 
drugs’, previously classified as an important potential risk.

Kyowa Kirin Holdings B.V. Ltd 
PecFent 100 mcg/spray nasal spray solution 
PecFent 400 mcg/spray nasal spray solution 
PecFent 
Centralised 
Chemical class: Fentanyl is a pure opioid agonist, with a clinical 
potency of 50 to 100 times that of morphine, which acts primarily 
through interaction with mu-opioid receptors located in the brain, spinal 
cord, and smooth muscle.  
Summary of mode of action: PecFent uses the proprietary PecSys® 
nasal drug delivery system to modulate the delivery and absorption of 
fentanyl. The PecSys system allows the product to be sprayed into the 
front area of the nasal cavity, where it forms a thin gel on contact with 
the calcium ions present in the nasal mucosa. Fentanyl diffuses from the 
gel and is absorbed through the nasal mucosa. The system is designed to 
deliver increased speed of absorption and speed of onset with a 
controlled maximum plasma concentration to prevent any increase in 
side effects related to high fentanyl plasma levels. The gel also prevents 
dripping or runoff and unwanted loss of drug. 
Important information about its composition: The active ingredient is 
fentanyl citrate, a white crystalline powder, with the chemical formula 
of C22H28N2O.C6H8O7 and a molecular weight of 528.5 Daltons. 
Module 1.3.1 
PecFent is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain (BTP) in 
adults who are already receiving maintenance opioid therapy for chronic 
cancer pain. Breakthrough pain is a transitory exacerbation of cancer 
pain that occurs on a background of otherwise controlled persistent pain. 
Patients receiving maintenance opioid therapy are those who are taking 
at least 60 mg of oral morphine daily, at least 25 mcg of transdermal 
 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Dosage in the EEA 
fentanyl per hour, at least 30 mg of oxycodone daily, at least 8 mg of 
oral hydromorphone daily or an equi-analgesic dose of another opioid 
for a week or longer. 
Initial dose: The initial dose of PecFent to treat episodes of BTP is 
always 100 mcg (one spray), even in patients switching from other 
fentanyl-containing products. Patients must wait at least four hours 
before treating another episode of BTP with PecFent.  
Dose titration: PecFent should be titrated to an “effective” dose that 
provides adequate analgesia and minimises adverse reactions without 
causing undue (or intolerable) adverse reactions, for two consecutively 
treated episodes of BTP. The efficacy of a given dose should be 
assessed over the ensuing 30-minute period. Patients should be carefully 
monitored until an effective dose is reached. 
Method of titration: Patients should be prescribed an initial titration 
supply of one bottle (two spray or eight spray bottles) of PecFent 
100 mcg/spray. Patients who need to titrate to a higher dose due to lack 
of effect can be instructed to use two 100 mcg sprays (one in each 
nostril) for their next BTP episode. If this dose is not successful, the 
patient may be prescribed a bottle of PecFent 400 mcg/spray 
(eight spray bottle) and instructed to change to one 400 mcg spray for 
their next episode of pain. If this dose is not successful, the patient may 
be instructed to increase to two 400 mcg sprays (one in each nostril). 
From treatment initiation, patients should be closely followed, and the 
dosage titrated until an effective dose is reached and confirmed for two 
consecutively treated episodes of BTP. 
Maintenance therapy: Once an effective dose has been established 
during titration, patients should continue to take this dose up to a 
maximum of four doses per day. 
Dose readjustment: Generally, the maintenance dose of PecFent should 
be increased only where the current dose fails to adequately treat the 
BTP for several consecutive episodes. A review of the dose of the 
background opioid therapy may be required if patients consistently 
present with more than four BTP episodes per 24 hours. If adverse 
reactions are intolerable or persistent, the dose should be reduced or 
treatment with PecFent replaced by another analgesic.  
Discontinuation of therapy: PecFent should be discontinued 
immediately if the patient no longer experiences BTP episodes. The 
treatment for persistent background pain should be kept as prescribed.  
If discontinuation of all opioid therapy is required, the patient must be 
closely followed by the doctor as gradual downward opioid titration 
therapy is necessary to avoid the possibility of abrupt withdrawal 
effects.

EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Part II: Module SI - Epidemiology of the indication and target population 
Indication: Management of BTP in adults who are already receiving maintenance 
opioid therapy for chronic cancer pain 
Incidence: The reported incidence of BTP varies widely from as low as 16% to as high as 95% of 
those with persistent pain syndromes (malignant and non-malignant diseases) (Payne, 2007a). In 
cancer patients, BTP has been reported to occur in 50% to 90% of patients who experience chronic 
pain (Portenoy et al, 2006). 
Prevalence: Episodes of BTP are a common problem for cancer patients with pain. During the course 
of cancer, the prevalence of BTP is estimated between 19% and 95% (Payne, 2007b; Svendsen et al, 
2005; Greco et al, 2011). A large, prospective, multicentre survey of pain specialists in 24 countries 
found that approximately 65% of 1,095 cancer patients had BTP in addition to continuous background 
pain. Figures vary across countries with a higher reported frequency of BTP in north-western 
European countries, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand compared with other countries 
including southern European countries, Russia, China, India and Mexico (Caraceni and Portenoy, 
1999).  
Demographics of the population in the authorised indication: The demographic profile for patients 
with BTP mirrors that of cancer in general, and therefore covers all demographic profiles.  
Risk factors for the disease: Cancer patients, particularly those with advanced disease.  
The main existing treatment options: Strong opioids, especially morphine, are the principal treatments 
for moderate to severe cancer-related pain. Besides fentanyl, other commonly used compounds 
include methadone, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, alfentanil, levorphanol, buprenorphine, 
diamorphine, morphine and oxycodone. The non-parenteral route of administration is advocated 
where appropriate; however, patients presenting with severe pain requiring urgent relief should 
routinely be treated with parenteral opioids, usually administered subcutaneously or intravenously 
(European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Clinical Practice Guidelines, 2018).  
According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines (2016), during 
palliative care treatment for adults, the first-line therapy for BTP in cancer patients who can take oral 
opioids should be oral immediate-release morphine (in patients on maintenance oral morphine 
treatment). Fast-acting fentanyl should not be used as first-line rescue medication. If pain remains 
inadequately controlled despite optimising treatment, specialist advice should be considered (National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, 2016). Fentanyl transmucosal preparations 
(buccal soluble film, sublingual tablets, lozenges/buccal tablets) and nasal preparations also exist as 
alternative treatment options for BTP. However, ESMO guidelines on management of cancer pain in 
adult patients stated that the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of oral opioids, such as 
morphine, do not tend to mirror the temporal characteristics of most BTP in cancer episodes, resulting 
in delayed or ineffective analgesia and in ongoing adverse effects. ESMO recommends the use of 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
transmucosal fentanyl formulations for unpredictable and rapid-onset BTP, in addition to limiting the 
use of oral morphine for the treatment of slow-onset BTP or a pre-emptive administration of oral 
opioids approximately 30 minutes before a predictable BTP triggered by known events (ESMO 
guidelines, 2018). 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the population, including mortality and morbidity: The 
morbidity within the target population is variable, depending on the type and stage of the underlying 
cancer. Mortality in cancer patients is not directly related to BTP, although the incidence of BTP 
increases with progressive cancer.  
Important co-morbidities: Fentanyl is indicated for BTP in cancer patients; therefore, all patients will 
have localised or disseminated cancer. Although concomitant diseases are variable in this 
heterogeneous patient population, given that cancer is more common in the older population, other 
diseases in this cohort such as diabetes, heart disease, pulmonary disease, osteoporosis, arthritis, and 
hypertension may be present. Older patients may also have pre-existing abnormalities of peripheral 
nerves, mental status, and cardiac function. Geriatric syndromes such as frailty, urinary incontinence 
and balance disorders may also exist. Other age-related limitations such as physical disabilities and 
restricted functional reserve capacity in certain organ systems e.g., renal, may also be present. In 
addition, patients with BTP will have been extensively pre-treated with other opioids for background 
pain control, and may have received radiotherapy and chemotherapy, with the resultant adverse 
effects of treatment. 
Part II: Module SII - Non-clinical part of the safety specification 
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage: 
Toxicity 
Single (acute) or repeat-dose toxicity studies:  
Three repeat-dose studies have been conducted in the rat and dog. Clinical signs attributed to the 
pharmacological effects of fentanyl were noted in both species. 
Local findings were reported in the 6-month rat study relating to the intranasal administration of 
fentanyl (but not the drug-free pectin vehicle). Minimal/slight treatment-related histopathological 
changes (higher incidence of goblet cell hypertrophy/hyperplasia) were observed in the nasal cavities 
of female rats that received the high dose (0.48 mg/kg/day) of fentanyl. There were also 
minimal/slight changes in the lung (higher incidence of alveolar macrophages) in both male and 
female rats at 0.48 mg/kg/day and male rats in the intermediate dose group dosed at 0.32 mg/kg/day). 
Some deposition in the lung of the rat is considered to be consequential to the dosing technique 
(instillation of relatively large dose volumes). 
CONFIDENTIAL 
11 
 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
The studies have demonstrated that fentanyl is associated with some local and possibly systemic 
toxicity when administered via the intranasal route. However, there is a significant safety margin in 
terms of exposure to fentanyl in toxicology animals (at the no observed adverse effect level) to that in 
humans across the entire therapeutic dose range. Local tolerability is classified as an important 
identified risk for PecFent. 
In the rat, gastric inflammation/lesions were noted which were considered to be drug-related. There 
were no other histopathology findings in these animals. It is well documented that opioids including 
fentanyl can reduce gastrointestinal motility. Furthermore, inflammation of the intestine is known to 
closely correlate with motility disorder; dysmotility will exacerbate intestinal injury through 
accumulation of toxic substances or disruption of the intestinal flora (Bossone et al, 2001; Ozaki et al, 
2005). 
Opioids as a class of drug are well known to be associated with reduced gastrointestinal motility. 
Reproductive/developmental toxicity: 
Reproductive studies were not conducted with PecFent. Data from the published literature indicate 
that embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies conducted in rats and rabbits revealed no 
compound-induced malformations or developmental variations when administered during the period 
of organogenesis. In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats, a male-mediated effect 
was observed at high doses (300 mcg/kg/day, subcutaneous) and is consistent with the sedative effects 
of fentanyl in animal studies. In studies on pre and postnatal development in rats, the survival rate of 
offspring was significantly reduced at doses causing severe maternal toxicity. Further findings at 
maternally toxic doses in F1 pups were delayed physical development, sensory functions, reflexes and 
behaviour. These effects could either be indirect effects due to altered maternal care and/or decreased 
lactation rate or a direct effect of fentanyl on the pups. 
The potential risk in humans is unknown. There are no adequate data from the use of fentanyl in 
pregnant women. 
Pregnancy and breastfeeding patients are not considered to be representative of the target population. 
However, the unknown risk is addressed in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) under 
Section 4.6 and the Section 5.3, which describe the preclinical safety findings. 
Genotoxicity:  
No specific studies on the genotoxicity of fentanyl citrate were considered necessary. The reference 
products, Effentora and Actiq adequately describe these aspects. In particular the Actiq Summary 
Basis of Approval includes results from the testing of fentanyl in the Ames, LY5178Y mouse 
lymphoma and mouse micronucleus tests: all were negative. 
These data provide reassurance as to the lack of genotoxic potential for fentanyl.  
Carcinogenicity: 
CONFIDENTIAL 
12 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Fentanyl is a well-established medicinal product and has been in use for more than 40 years.  
Brain lesions/findings were not evident in six-month rat/nine-month dog studies conducted on 
PecFent. However, high doses of fentanyl and other opioids are reported to cause brain lesions, 
primarily eosinophilic neuron degeneration in the limbic system and associated areas, following 
intravenous administration to rats (Kofke et al, 1996a,b). Neuronal degeneration has also been 
reported in rat spinal cord following intrathecal administration of fentanyl (Abut et al, 2015). 
Non-Kyowa Kirin data presented in the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) 
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment report for Procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001369/201304 identified that carcinogenicity studies (26-week dermal 
alternative bioassay in Tg.AC transgenic mice; two-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity study in rats) 
did not reveal any findings indicative of oncogenic potential. Re-evaluation of brain slides from the 
carcinogenicity study in rats revealed brain lesions in animals administered high doses of fentanyl 
citrate. 
The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Cases of fentanyl/opioid-induced 
neurotoxicity have also been reported in humans (Gallagher, 2007; Okon and George, 2008).  
Brain lesions are an important potential risk for PecFent. 
Safety pharmacology 
General Safety Pharmacology: 
No safety pharmacology studies have been undertaken by the MAH in respect of fentanyl use because 
the MAH is relying on the studies conducted for the reference products, Effentora and Actiq, to fully 
describe the safety pharmacology of fentanyl citrate. Data cited from the literature was also reviewed. 
Gastrointestinal system: 
Opioids can induce direct or indirect gastrointestinal effects, in particular nausea and vomiting, and 
these have been observed in animals and man (Gutstein and Akil, 2002). It is well documented that 
opioids including fentanyl can reduce gastrointestinal motility. Furthermore, inflammation of the 
intestine is known to closely correlate with motility disorder; dysmotility will exacerbate intestinal 
injury through accumulation of toxic substances or disruption of the intestinal flora (Bossone et al, 
2001; Ozaki et al, 2005). 
As patients receiving PecFent should already be receiving opioids and would therefore already be 
familiar with these general effects, these effects do not appear to warrant escalation as an important 
issue. 
Cardiovascular system: 
CONFIDENTIAL 
13 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
A study on the cardiovascular system, in telemetered Beagle dogs, demonstrated the effects of 
fentanyl on the conduction processes in the heart. High subcutaneous doses (0.05 mg/kg fentanyl 
citrate) lead to altered conduction within the heart evidenced by an increased incidence of sinus 
pauses >2.5 seconds in duration, and an increased incidence of escape complexes associated with the 
period of decreased heart rate and possibly increased escape focus excitability. This increase in focus 
excitability and therefore heart rate may represent the direct effect of fentanyl at the escape focus site 
or may reflect an increase in sympathetic tone. 
Circulatory depression, including severe bradycardia, hypotension and shock, is an identified risk for 
PecFent which is addressed sufficiently within the Section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Nervous system: 
Single doses of fentanyl 0.3 mg/kg administered subcutaneously produced signs that were indicative 
of generalised depression of the central nervous system. 
Opioids as a class of drug are well known to be associated with central nervous system depression. 
Respiratory system: 
A plethysmograph study in rats on the respiratory system demonstrated the clear depressant effect on 
respiration rate and tidal volume caused by fentanyl in rats.  
Respiratory depression or insufficiency is an important identified risk for PecFent. 
Other toxicity-related information or data: 
None.  
Part II: Module SIII - Clinical trial exposure 
During the Phase II/III studies, a total of 506 subjects were treated with one or more of the four doses 
of fentanyl nasal spray (100 mcg, 200 mcg, 400 mcg and 800 mcg). Of these subjects, 36.0% were 
treated with the highest dose of 800 mcg and 62.8% were treated with 400 mcg at least once 
(Integrated Summary of Safety Phase: II/III: Table 1-2.16). It should be noted that subjects could 
receive multiple dose levels of fentanyl nasal spray. These clinical trials all studied adult cancer 
patients who were taking regular, 24-hour medication for underlying cancer pain and who typically 
had one to four episodes of breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) per day. 
A total of 27,040 days of exposure to PecFent were accumulated in the Phase II/III clinical trials 
(Table 2), which amounts to a total of 74.0 years of exposure. Of the 74 subject-years of exposure to 
fentanyl nasal spray, almost two-thirds (64%) of the years were exposure at one of the two highest 
doses (Table 2). In patients receiving long-term treatment, i.e., >90 days, total exposure to PecFent 
was 49.5 years (18,078 days).

EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Source: Integrated Safety Database: Phase II/III studies: Tables 2-2.1 and 2-2.10. 
PecFent has not been studied in the following special populations: patients who are pregnant or 
lactating, patients less than 18 years of age or patients with renal or hepatic impairment, although the 
clearance of fentanyl in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency is well understood (see 
Section SIV.2 [Limitations to detect adverse reactions in clinical trial development programmes]). 
Due to the intranasal administration of PecFent, the numbers of BTP episodes treated in subjects with 
a history of allergic or seasonal rhinitis were reviewed. In the Phase II/III clinical trials, a total of 
20,093 episodes of BTP have been treated in subjects with a history of allergic or seasonal rhinitis. 
That is approximately 44% of the total number of treated episodes (20,093/45,599 episodes). 
CP045/06/FCNS study 
CP045/06/FCNS was an open-label treatment study consisting of the Main Study (16 weeks duration) 
and the Extension Period (open-ended). Subjects were newly enrolled or were enrolled after 
successfully completing studies CP043/06/FCNS or CP044/06/FCNS. 
A total of 66 subject-years of documented Nasalfent (previous name for PecFent) drug use was 
obtained during the Main Study phase. The mean (SD) duration of Nasalfent treatment per subject 
was 60.4 (44.44) days with a maximum duration of 152 days (approximately 5 months).  
Subjects who completed and who were ongoing in the CP045/06/FCNS study at closure of the Main 
Study phase, were offered the option to continue Nasalfent treatment in the Extension Period. 
A total of 145 subject-years of exposure to Nasalfent was accumulated in the Extension Period. The 
mean (SD) duration of Nasalfent treatment per subject was 325 (354) days with a maximum duration 
of 1,357 days (3 years and 8 months). 
No new adverse events (AEs), nor any change in the pattern of AEs were noted in this extension 
study. 
All clinical trial populations exposure 
A total of 27,040 days (74.0 years) of exposure to Nasalfent were accumulated in the Phase II/III 
clinical trials. 
A total of 145 subject-years of exposure to Nasalfent were accumulated in the Extension Period. 
Part II: Module SIV - Populations not studied in clinical trials 
SIV.1 
Exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development 
programme 
Severe respiratory depression or severe obstructive lung conditions: 
CONFIDENTIAL 
26 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Reason for exclusion: There is a risk of clinically significant respiratory depression associated with 
the use of fentanyl. 
Particularly in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, fentanyl may cause more serious 
adverse reactions. In these patients, opioids may decrease respiratory drive and increase airway 
resistance. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: Respiratory depression is a known complication of opioid therapy, including fentanyl. Use 
in patients with severe respiratory depression or severe obstructive lung conditions remains a 
contraindication within the SmPC. In addition, respiratory depression or insufficiency is considered 
an important identified risk for PecFent. 
Opioid naïve patients: 
Reason for exclusion: The potential for respiratory depression is greater in those patients who are 
naïve to opioids. Use of fentanyl in these patients, may cause more serious adverse reactions. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: It is well recognised that the potential for respiratory depression is greater in those patients 
who are naïve to opioids and that use of fentanyl within these patients may cause more serious 
adverse reactions. Use in patients without maintenance opioid therapy remains a contraindication 
within the SmPC. In addition, off-label use which captures use in opioid naïve patients is considered 
an important identified risk for PecFent.  
Cardiac conditions that may be worsened by opioids: 
Reason for exclusion: Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia and so for safety reasons these 
patients were excluded. 
Is it considered to be included as missing information? No 
Rationale: Intravenous fentanyl may produce bradycardia. PecFent should therefore be used with 
caution in patients with pre-existing bradyarrhythmias. This is stated as a specific precaution in 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Women of childbearing potential unless taking adequate contraceptive precautions: 
Reason for exclusion: The potential risk of exposure to fentanyl in pregnancy is not known as no 
studies have been performed. Non-clinical studies demonstrated developmental effects in offspring. 
For safety reasons, pregnancy was to be avoided during clinical trials. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: PecFent is not intended to be used in pregnant and breastfeeding patients. However, the 
unknown risk is addressed in the SmPC under Section 4.6 and the Section 5.3, which describe the pre-
clinical safety findings. 
Nasal passages occluded or congested. History of nasal pathology, including polyps or nasal 
obstruction. Abnormal nasal physiology or pathology: 
Reason for exclusion: Excluded from clinical studies as presence of nasal pathology could prevent 
adequate intranasal administration and absorption and could impact efficacy endpoints. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: The exclusion from clinical trials was not based on safety concerns. No changes in the 
safety profile are predicted in this population when PecFent is used according to the product label. 
Upper respiratory tract infection, chronic rhinitis or had used decongestants within two weeks 
prior to screening. Taking any medication likely to affect the physiology of the nasal mucosa: 
Reason for exclusion: Excluded from clinical studies as presence of upper respiratory infection 
including chronic rhinitis and/or use of decongestants could prevent adequate intranasal 
administration and absorption and could impact efficacy endpoints. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: The exclusion from clinical trials was not based on safety concerns. Clinical trial CP048/07 
studied subjects with symptomatic seasonal allergic rhinitis. There were no safety issues pertaining to 
this group of patients. 
Use of concomitant nasally administered decongestants during titration is therefore not recommended 
as this may lead to patients titrating to a dose that is higher than required. In addition, patients should 
be made aware that pain control may be less effective following co-administration with a 
decongestant. If pain control is not as effective, patients should discontinue their decongestant 
treatment. The use of PecFent requires a dose titration to reach efficacy and adequate guidance on this 
is found in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Information regarding concomitant use with nasally administered vasoconstrictive decongestants is 
provided in Sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Sleep apnoea or active brain metastases with increased intracranial pressure: 
CONFIDENTIAL 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Reason for exclusion: PecFent can cause respiratory depression. The effect may be enhanced in 
patients with sleep apnoea or those with raised intracranial pressure who will be more susceptible to 
the effects of carbon dioxide retention. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: Opioids can exacerbate respiratory depression. PecFent is contraindicated in patients with 
severe respiratory depression. 
PecFent should be administered with extreme caution in patients who may be particularly susceptible 
to the intracranial effects of carbon dioxide retention, such as those with evidence of increased 
intracranial pressure.  
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnoea and sleep related 
hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of central sleep apnoea in a dose-dependent fashion. In 
patients who present with central sleep apnoea, consider decreasing the total opioid dosage. 
This precaution can be found in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Clinically significant renal or hepatic dysfunction test results: 
Reason for exclusion: Excluded for safety reasons as when administered intravenously the clearance 
of fentanyl has been shown to be altered in significant hepatic and renal impairment due to alterations 
in clearance and plasma proteins. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: PecFent is not intended to be used in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
Information regarding use in this patient population is provided in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Patients under the age of 18 years of age: 
Reason for exclusion: The objective of the clinical studies was to assess efficacy and safety in the 
adult population. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: The indication for use of PecFent is for the management of BTP in the adult population. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC states that the safety and efficacy of PecFent in children aged below 18 years 
have not yet been established. 
Too frail or unwell: 
Reason for exclusion: Excluded from clinical studies as presence would prevent adequate assessment 
of efficacy endpoints. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: The exclusion from clinical trials was not based on safety concerns. No changes in the 
safety profile are predicted in this population when PecFent is used according to the product label. 
Psychological distress felt to significantly contribute to pain: 
Reason for exclusion: Excluded from clinical studies as presence would prevent adequate assessment 
of efficacy endpoints. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: The exclusion from clinical trials was not based on safety concerns. No changes in the 
safety profile are predicted in this population when PecFent is used according to the product label. 
Uncontrolled or escalating pain: 
Reason for exclusion: Excluded from clinical studies as presence would prevent adequate assessment 
of efficacy endpoints. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: The exclusion from clinical trials was not based on safety concerns. No changes in the 
safety profile are predicted in this population when PecFent is used according to the product label. 
Unstable or rapidly deteriorating condition: 
Reason for exclusion: Excluded from clinical studies as presence would prevent adequate assessment 
of efficacy endpoints. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: The exclusion from clinical trials was not based on safety concerns. No changes in the 
safety profile are predicted in this population when PecFent is used according to the product label. 
Uncontrolled infection: 
Reason for exclusion: Excluded from clinical studies as presence would prevent adequate assessment 
of efficacy endpoints. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: The exclusion from clinical trials was not based on safety concerns. No changes in the 
safety profile are predicted in this population when PecFent is used according to the product label. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Radiotherapy within 30 days prior to study entry: 
Reason for exclusion: Excluded from clinical studies as presence would prevent adequate assessment 
of efficacy endpoints. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: The exclusion from clinical trials was not based on safety concerns. No changes in the 
safety profile are predicted in this population when PecFent is used according to the product label. 
Planning to undergo chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery during the treatment period: 
Reason for exclusion: Patients who had recently received radiotherapy or who were planned to 
receive radiotherapy or chemotherapy that might have affected pain levels were excluded from the

Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: Administration of either radiotherapy or chemotherapy concurrently with PecFent did not 
appear to affect the safety profile observed in the open-label study. 
Recent history of alcohol or substance abuse: 
Reason for exclusion: Excluded from clinical studies as presence would prevent adequate assessment 
of efficacy endpoints. 
Is it considered to be missing information? No 
Rationale: The exclusion from clinical trials was not based on safety concerns. The risks of 
dependence and misuse are described in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. No changes in the safety profile are 
predicted in this population when PecFent is used according to the product label. 
History of or current neurological or psychiatric impairment or cognitive dysfunction: 
Reason for exclusion: Excluded from clinical studies as presence would prevent adequate assessment

Exposure 
Patients with a history of abnormal nasal pathology, 
including polyps or nasal obstructions, were excluded 
from the pivotal clinical trials.  
Study CP048/07, a single-centre, three-way, crossover 
study was conducted to assess the bioavailability, 
pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single 
doses of PecFent when administered to subjects with 
seasonal allergic rhinitis in symptomatic, symptomatic 
but treated (oxymetazoline), and asymptomatic states. 
Following a single-dose administration of PecFent to 
subjects who suffered from symptomatic seasonal 
allergic rhinitis, the relative exposure to PecFent was 
generally unaffected when compared with 
asymptomatic subjects but was reduced in symptomatic 
subjects following treatment with oxymetazoline to an 
extent that may be clinically significant. Accordingly, 
the efficacy and safety of PecFent should not be 
affected by untreated allergic rhinitis, but fentanyl 
absorption is slowed in a patient with rhinitis when 
administered concomitantly with a decongestant 
(oxymetazoline), which may result in PecFent being 
less effective. 
Use of concomitant nasally administered 
decongestants during titration is therefore 
not recommended as this may lead to 
patients titrating to a dose that is higher 
than required. In addition, patients should 
be made aware that pain control may be 
less effective following co-administration 
with a decongestant. If pain control is not 
as effective, patients should discontinue 
their decongestant treatment. 
Not relevant as the approved indication is consistent 
with the clinical trial population. 
Not studied specifically with PecFent, but 
polymorphisms are not known to affect the clearance of 
fentanyl. As such, the efficacy and safety are not 
expected to be impacted.

Part II: Module SV - Post-authorisation experience    
SV.1 
Post-authorisation exposure 
SV.1.1  Method used to calculate exposure 
PecFent is available in 100 mcg and 400 mcg strengths. The optimal dose of PecFent is determined by 
upward titration on an individual patient basis. The initial starting dose of PecFent should be 100 mcg, 
titrating upwards as necessary. Once an appropriate dose is established, the patient is maintained on 
this dose. 
PecFent exposure estimates have been calculated based upon total sales of PecFent sold. A defined 
daily dose (DDD) of 600 mcg/day has been assumed.  
Patient-days=total micrograms sold/DDD. 
This exposure estimate represents the maximum amount of product distributed to the market and 
therefore the maximum possible exposure. However, the spray bottles contain an overage of fentanyl 
because they require priming prior to use, after which only the stated number of doses (i.e., two or 
eight sprays) are available for administration to the patient. Based on a patient using the maximum 
number of sprays in each pack, a more realistic estimate of patient treatment exposure (based on a 
DDD of 600 mcg) would be approximately half the maximum exposure. 
SV.1.2  Exposure 
Following the acquisition of Archimedes by the Marketing Authorisation Holder in 
August 2014, cumulative exposure data is estimated from the cumulative data 
presented in PSUR 7 (data lock point: 30 April 2017; 52,087 patient-years [PY]) 
plus data from 01 May 2017 to 31 March 2021 (44,367 PY; Table 7). Assuming a 
DDD of 600 mcg of PecFent, the cumulative patient exposure can therefore be 
estimated to be 96,454 PY. Considering the need to prime the spray prior to use

Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
The potential for abuse with fentanyl appears to be of a similar level to other prescription opioids 
(such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, morphine and hydromorphone). 
In view of the recognised possibility for the abuse, misuse, and diversion of fentanyl-containing 
products, comprehensive measures were undertaken throughout the clinical trial programme to 
minimise the opportunity for such. 
During the clinical study programme, no meaningful evidence of abuse, misuse or diversion of study 
materials has emerged. Two patients in Study CP045 were withdrawn due to intentional drug misuse 
and drug abuse reported as a dependency on narcotics. None of the Investigators reported any specific 
concerns regarding abuse or diversion during the trials. To minimise abuse by patients and 
non-patients, Kyowa Kirin continues to implement the educational principles used in the clinical 
trials, adapted as appropriate to the post-marketing environment. 
Educational materials are available to prescribing physicians and dispensing pharmacists to facilitate 
the screening of patients for risks of abuse of prescription pain medication and following accepted 
guidelines for the management of high-risk patients. In addition, educational materials are available to 
patients, family members and carers about the risks of abuse of prescription pain medication and the 
importance of secure medication storage. 
To minimise diversion, the supply chain is tightly controlled in accordance with national regulations 
for controlled substances; a tamper-evident container-closure system is used. 
The SmPC emphasises that treatment should occur under the supervision of an experienced clinician. 
Drug misuse, abuse, diversion or dependence is an important identified risk for PecFent.

SVII.1.2 Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP 
Important identified risks: 
Respiratory depression or insufficiency 
In common with other opioid agonists, fentanyl can induce respiratory depression. It is well 
recognised that the potential for respiratory depression is greater in patients who are naïve to opioids 
and that use of fentanyl within these patients may cause more serious adverse reactions. Respiratory 
depression can potentially be life-threatening and may eventually result in respiratory failure with a 
fatal outcome. This is supported by the clinical trial experience whereby serious adverse events 
(SAEs) that may be indicative of respiratory depression or insufficiency were reported and included 
events of Dyspnoea, Respiratory failure, Cardio-respiratory arrest, Pneumonia, Hypoxia and Acute 
respiratory distress syndrome, all of which were considered severe, and some of which were 
associated with a fatal outcome. 
Benefit-risk impact: This safety concern is well characterised and well managed by routine risk 
minimisation measures. Following inclusion in the analysis of benefits and risks, the benefit-risk 
balance remains positive for PecFent.  
Local tolerability 
Due to the route of administration of PecFent, local tolerability is a potential issue due to the direct 
action of the drug on the nasal mucosa. However, clinical data have not identified this as a real issue 
as nasal tolerability of PecFent was high. Nonetheless, serious nasal AEs of Epistaxis and Nasal 
congestion were reported from clinical trials. The most frequently reported nasal events from 
post-marketing experience were Epistaxis, Nasal discomfort, Nasal dryness, and Nasal congestion. 
Benefit-risk impact: This safety concern is well characterised and well managed by routine risk 
minimisation measures. Following inclusion in the analysis of benefits and risks, the benefit-risk 
balance remains positive for PecFent. 
CONFIDENTIAL

EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Drug misuse, abuse, diversion or dependence  
Opioids have a considerable addictive potential and thereby are prone to misuse and abuse. The 
potential clinical consequences of misuse are serious and can include a risk of respiratory depression 
and/or physical and psychological dependence. However, when opioids are used under medical 
supervision as part of analgesia, the risk of abuse or misuse is low. Data from the US Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) indicate that fentanyl is mainly diverted via pharmacy theft, 
fraudulent prescriptions, and illicit distribution by patients and registrants (DEA, 2016). Hundreds of 
diverted items are identified in the US each year. 
The phenomenon is also a concern in Europe, although precise figures are not available because 
systematic searches for fentanyl are not performed (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug 
Addiction, 2012). Deaths associated with fentanyl diversion, however, have been reported in the 
United Kingdom and several EU countries, including Sweden and Italy. To minimise diversion, the 
supply chain is tightly controlled in accordance with national regulations for controlled substances 
and a tamper-evident container-closure system is used. 
Opioids have a considerable addictive potential and therefore patients can be prone to drug 
dependence. The potential clinical consequences of drug dependence are serious and can include both 
physical and psychological dependence. Drug dependence can produce significant and lasting changes 
in brain chemistry and function. Opioids disinhibit dopamine neurons, producing increased firing 
rates. Opioids also have direct effects on endogenous opioid and possibly the gamma-aminobutyric 
acid systems. Once dependant, there is a tendency to relapse after abstinence, possibly due to 
integration of reward circuitry with motivational, emotional and memory centres connected in the 
limbic system of the brain (McLellan et al, 2000). However, when opioids are used under medical 
supervision as part of analgesia, the risk of drug dependence is low. 
Benefit-risk impact: This safety concern is well characterised and well managed 
by routine and additional risk minimisation measures. Following inclusion in the analysis of 
benefits and risks, the benefit-risk balance remains positive for PecFent. 
Off-label use 
PecFent is indicated for the management of BTP in adult patients using opioid 
therapy for chronic cancer pain. It is contra-indicated in the treatment of acute 
pain other than BTP. The potential clinical consequences of off-label use are 
serious and can include a risk of respiratory depression and/or physical and psychological 
dependence. In addition, there is a potential for lack of effect or AE when used outside of an 
indication for which there is no clinical data.  
Benefit-risk impact: This safety concern is well characterised and well managed by routine and 
additional risk minimisation measures. Following inclusion in the analysis of benefits and risks, the 
benefit-risk balance remains positive for PecFent.

EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Medication error 
Medication errors refer to unintentional prescribing/administration and or dispensing of PecFent, in 
addition to incorrect dose and route of administration. The potential consequences associated with 
medication errors can be serious if associated with an AE and include the risk of respiratory 
depression or a lack of pain control. 
Benefit-risk impact: This safety concern is well characterised and well managed by routine and 
additional risk minimisation measures. Following inclusion in the analysis of benefits and risks, the 
benefit-risk balance remains positive for PecFent. 
Overdose 
In association with opioid treatment, including fentanyl, there is significant tolerability to all effects 
(efficacy and side effects) except constipation after a few weeks of constant dosing. Therefore, the 
therapeutic window is wider for opioid-tolerant patients which reduces the risk of severe adverse 
effects following intentional overdosing. It is well known that all opioid mu-receptor agonists, 
including fentanyl, produce dose-dependent respiratory depression and as with other potent opioids, 
fentanyl has been associated with cases of serious and fatal respiratory depression in opioid 
non-tolerant individuals. To reiterate, the potential clinical consequences associated with overdose are 
serious if associated with an AE. 
Benefit-risk impact: This safety concern is well characterised and well managed by routine and 
additional risk minimisation measures. Following inclusion in the analysis of benefits and risks, the 
benefit-risk balance remains positive for PecFent. 
Accidental exposure 
Accidental exposure refers to the accidental exposure of a person (adult or child) for whom PecFent 
was not prescribed. The impact on the individual accidently exposed to PecFent is potentially serious. 
Respiratory depression may occur, particularly in non-opioid tolerant individuals, and has the 
potential of a fatal outcome.  
Benefit-risk impact: This safety concern is well characterised and well managed by routine and 
additional risk minimisation measures. Following inclusion in the analysis of benefits and risks, the 
benefit-risk balance remains positive for PecFent. 
Important potential risks: 
Brain lesion 
Non-Kyowa Kirin data presented in the PRAC PSUR assessment report for Procedure 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001369/201304 identified that carcinogenicity studies (26-week dermal 
alternative bioassay in Tg.AC transgenic mice; two-year subcutaneous carcinogenicity study in rats) 
did not induce any findings indicative of oncogenic potential. Evaluation of brain slides from the

39 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
carcinogenicity study in rats revealed brain lesions in animals administered high doses of fentanyl 
citrate.  
The carcinogenicity potential of fentanyl for humans is unknown, therefore the impact on individual 
patients is not known. As a result of the findings from the carcinogenicity study in rats, brain lesion is 
considered an important potential risk. 
The PRAC PSUR assessment report Procedure EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001369/201704 noted that the 
data was difficult to interpret and a correlation of the cases, which are mostly poorly documented, 
with mineralisation/necrosis retrieved in carcinogenicity studies of animals, seemed hard to identify 
without medical imagery data such as magnetic resonance imaging scans. 
Benefit-risk impact: Given PecFent is used to treat BTP in cancer patients, the presence of 
pre-existing malignancy makes it difficult to determine if a causal relationship exists between PecFent 
and brain lesions. The background history of cancer within this population makes it challenging to 
determine whether brain lesions are primary disease or secondary to the established cancer. Currently, 
there is insufficient data to allow classification as an important identified risk for PecFent. 
Missing information: 
Long-term use

SVII.2  New safety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an updated 
RMP  
Cardiovascular depression, including severe bradycardia, hypotension and shock was previously 
classified as an important identified risk, but it is proposed to be removed. The safety concern is 
adequately addressed in the SmPC and is not associated with any additional pharmacovigilance 
activities or risk minimisation measures. Statements applicable to Cardiovascular depression are 
provided in Section 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Serotonin syndrome induced by interaction between fentanyl and serotoninergic drugs was previously 
classified as an important potential risk, but it is proposed to be removed. This safety concern is 
considered to be adequately addressed in the SmPC and is no longer associated with any additional 
pharmacovigilance activities or risk minimisation measures. Statements applicable to Serotonin 
syndrome are provided in Section 4.4 and Section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Use in the paediatric population, use in pregnant and breastfeeding women, and use in patients with 
renal or hepatic impairment were previously classified as missing information but it is proposed to 
remove these safety concerns. This change will ensure adherence to Good Pharmacovigilance 
Practices Module V Revision 2 guidance, which advises that excluded populations from the clinical 
trial development programme should be included as missing information only when they are relevant 
for the approved and proposed indications, i.e., “on-label” use. PecFent is not intended to be used in 
patients under the age of 18 years, in pregnant and breastfeeding women, or in patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment, hence use in these populations is not considered as missing information but as 
off-label use. Off-label use has already been classified as an important identified risk for PecFent. Use 
in the paediatric population, in pregnant and breastfeeding women and in patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment will continue to be monitored under the safety concern of off-label use. 
Statements applicable to use in the paediatric population are provided in Sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 
SmPC. Statements applicable to use in pregnant and breastfeeding women are provided in Section 4.6 
and the Section 5.3 of the SmPC.  Statements applicable to use in patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment are provided in Section 4.2 and Section 4.4 of the SmPC.

Characterisation of the 
risk 
Fentanyl is known to induce respiratory depression by direct activation of 
opioid receptors, which are abundant in respiratory control centres (including 
the brainstem) of the central nervous system (Pattinson, 2008). Respiratory 
depression involves both a reduction in responsiveness of the brain stem 
respiratory centres to increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical 
stimulation. 
Clinical trial development programmes and post-marketing surveillance 
including post-marketing reports and literature. 
In common with other opioid agonists, fentanyl can induce respiratory 
depression. It is well recognised that the potential for respiratory depression is 
greater in patients who are not receiving opioids and that use of fentanyl in 
these patients may cause more serious adverse reactions. Respiratory depression 
can potentially be life-threatening and may eventually result in respiratory 
failure with a fatal outcome. Respiratory depression or insufficiency is therefore 
considered an important identified risk for PecFent.

Important identified risk: Respiratory depression or insufficiency 
During clinical trials, SAEs that may be indicative of respiratory depression or 
insufficiency were reported and included events of Dyspnoea, Respiratory 
failure, Cardio-respiratory arrest, Pneumonia, Hypoxia and Acute respiratory 
distress syndrome, some of which were associated with a fatal outcome. None 
of these AEs were considered to be related to the administration of PecFent. 
Post-marketing experience: 
Cumulatively, 83 valid case reports describing 94 events (17 fentanyl nasal 
spray, 77 unspecified fentanyl formulation) pertaining to respiratory depression 
or insufficiency have been identified from the post-marketing setting. This 
equates to a reporting rate (RR) of 3.5 events per 10,000 PY for fentanyl nasal 
spray and 19.5 events per 10,000 PY for fentanyl nasal spray and unspecified 
fentanyl formulation combined. 
The most frequently reported PTs were Dyspnoea, Cardiac arrest, Respiratory 
depression, Hypoxia, Respiratory arrest, Respiratory failure, Asphyxia and 
Cyanosis. Of the 94 events, 83 were serious, for which event outcome was 
resolved (18), resolved with sequelae (1), resolving (7), not resolved (7), 
fatal (21) and unknown (29). The most frequently reported events associated 
with a fatal outcome were Asphyxia, Cardiac arrest and Respiratory failure. 
Patients at increased risk of developing respiratory depression include those 
who: 
•  Are opioid-naïve 
•  Are elderly 
•  Are debilitated 
•  Have underlying pulmonary pathology 
•  Have impaired respiratory drive of sleep apnoea 
•  Are also receiving concomitant sedatives 
Patients with pain who receive chronic opioid therapy develop tolerance to 
respiratory depression and hence the risk of respiratory depression in these 
patients is reduced. Section 4.4 of the SmPC also warns that the use of 
concomitant central nervous system depressants may increase the risk of 
respiratory depression, and that in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
diseases, fentanyl may cause more serious adverse reactions and opioids may 
decrease respiratory drive and increase airway resistance. 
This safety concern is well characterised and managed by routine risk 
minimisation measures. Following inclusion in the analysis of overall benefits 
and risks, the benefit-risk balance remains positive for PecFent.

Because of the route of administration of PecFent, local tolerability is a 
potential issue due to the direct action of the drug on the nasal mucosa. 
However, clinical data have not identified this as a meaningful issue as nasal 
tolerability of PecFent was high. Nonetheless, serious nasal AEs of epistaxis 
and nasal congestion were reported from clinical trials; post-marketing safety 
data are in-line with that reported from the clinical trials. It is therefore 
considered that there is sufficient information to classify local tolerability as an

No consistent pattern of findings on objective nasal examinations was found 
during the studies that would indicate that PecFent is associated with changes in 
nasal obstruction, inflammation, discharge, or colour of mucosa. In subjective 
assessments, no consistent pattern of abnormal nasal findings such as stuffy or 
blocked nose, runny nose, itching or sneezing, crusting or dryness of the nose, 
burning or discomfort, nasal bleeding, cough, postnasal drip, sore throat, or 
taste disturbance was reported. 
The following serious nasal AEs were reported in the clinical trials: epistaxis 
and nasal congestion. These were considered by the Investigator to be unrelated 
to PecFent. Of the nasal AEs reported, most resolved on the same day. Two 
severe nasal AEs were reported in the clinical trials (epistaxis and cough). All 
other events were mild or moderate in severity. 
Post-marketing experience: 
Cumulatively, 49 valid case reports describing 53 events (39 fentanyl nasal 
spray, 14 unspecified fentanyl formulation) pertaining to local tolerability have 
been identified from the post-marketing setting. This equates to a RR of 
8.1 events per 10,000 PY for fentanyl nasal spray and 11 events per 10,000 PY 
for fentanyl nasal spray and unspecified fentanyl formulation combined. 
The most frequently reported PTs were Epistaxis, Nasal discomfort, Nasal 
dryness, Nasal congestion and Dry mouth. Of the 53 events, 11 were serious, 
for which event outcome was resolved (6), resolving (1), not resolved (2) and 
unknown (2). 
No risk groups or risk factors have been identified. 
Nasal AEs are listed in Section 4.8 of the SmPC. A warning to consider an 
alternative mode of administration if the patient experiences recurrent episodes 
of epistaxis or nasal discomfort is included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. The 
results from clinical trials do not warrant any additional warning statements to 
be included in the SmPC.

High Level Terms of Intentional product misuses and Intentional product use 
issues, SMQ of Drug abuse and dependence (broad) a 
Opioids, including fentanyl, have a considerable addictive potential and 
thereby are prone to misuse. 
Fentanyl stimulates mu-opioid receptors in the nucleus accumbens, leading to 
activation of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, which is implicated in its 
rewarding effects (Herz, 1998). 
The development of physical dependence results from activation of mu1 
receptors, which causes functional changes in Gi/o, adenylate cyclase, protein 
kinases A and C, beta-adrenoceptor and N-mthyl-D-aspartate receptors in the 
locus coeruleus (Suzuki and Misawa, 1997). 
Post-marketing surveillance including post-marketing reports and literature. 
Tolerance and physical and/or psychological dependence may develop upon 
repeated administration of opioids such as fentanyl. However, iatrogenic 
addiction following therapeutic use of opioids is known to occur. In addition, 
repeated use of PecFent may lead to opioid use disorder. Furthermore, the 
potential clinical consequences of abuse and intentional misuse are serious and 
can include overdose, a risk of respiratory depression, death and/or physical 
and psychological dependence. However, when opioids are used under medical 
supervision as part of analgesia, the risk of abuse or misuse is considered low. 
Data from the US DEA indicate that fentanyl is mainly diverted via pharmacy 
theft, fraudulent prescriptions, and illicit distribution by patients and registrants 
(DEA, 2016). Hundreds of diverted items are identified in the US each year. 
The phenomenon is also a concern in Europe, although precise figures are not 
available because systematic searches for fentanyl are not performed 
(European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, 2012). Deaths 
associated with fentanyl diversion, however, have been reported in the United 
Kingdom and several EU countries, including Sweden and Italy. It is therefore 
considered that there is sufficient information to classify drug misuse, abuse, 
diversion and dependence as an important identified risk for PecFent. 
Clinical trial experience: 
No clinically significant AEs associated with abuse or misuse were reported in 
clinical trials.

been identified from the post-marketing setting. This equates to a RR of 
6.8 events per 10,000 PY for fentanyl nasal spray and 12 events per 10,000 PY 
for fentanyl nasal spray and unspecified fentanyl formulation combined. 
Reported PTs were Intentional product misuse, Intentional product use issue 
and Intentional device misuse. Of the 58 case reports, 32 were serious and 
13 were associated with a fatal outcome. The most frequently reported events 
associated with a fatal outcome reported in these case reports were Toxicity to 
various agents, Pulmonary oedema, Brain oedema, Cystocele and Drug 
diversion. 
In addition, 341 valid case reports describing 484 events (181 fentanyl nasal

dependence or diversion were identified from the post-marketing setting. This 
equates to a RR of 37.5 events per 10,000 PY for fentanyl nasal spray and 
100.4 events per 10,000 PY for fentanyl nasal spray and unspecified fentanyl 
formulation combined. 
Of the 484 events, 94 pertained to drug dependence (PTs of Drug dependence, 
Substance dependence and Dependence) and 29 to drug diversion (PTs of Drug 
diversion, Prescription form tampering and Prescription drug used without a 
prescription); other reported PTs included Overdose, Drug abuse, Toxicity to 
various agents, Accidental overdose, Substance abuse, Drug tolerance and 
Intentional overdose. Of the 341 case reports, 291 were serious and 105 were 
associated with a fatal outcome. The most frequently reported events 
associated with a fatal outcome reported in these case reports were Toxicity to 
various agents, Overdose, Drug abuse, Accidental overdose, Drug diversion, 
Death, Pulmonary oedema, Brain oedema and Depressed level of 
consciousness. 
Those at an increased risk of misuse include: 
•  Patients who have a history of substance abuse 
•  Patients and prescribers who use PecFent off-label

PecFent is indicated for the management of BTP in adult 
patients who are already receiving maintenance therapy for 
chronic cancer pain. It is contraindicated in the treatment of 
acute pain other than BTP. The potential clinical consequences 
of off-label use are serious and can include a risk of respiratory 
depression and/or physical and psychological dependence. In 
addition, there is a potential for lack of effect or AEs when used 
outside of an indication for which there is no clinical data. It is

Post-marketing experience: 
Cumulatively, 360 valid case reports (202 fentanyl nasal spray, 158 unspecified

identified from the post-marketing setting. This equates to a RR of 41.9 case 
reports per 10,000 PY for fentanyl nasal spray and 74.6 case reports per 
10,000 PY for fentanyl nasal spray and unspecified fentanyl formulation 
combined. 
Of the 360 case reports, 48 (13.3%) concerned off-label use in paediatric patients. 
Of the 48 case reports, 20 were serious, none of which were associated with a fatal 
outcome. Of note, additional off-label uses in these cases included use for non-
cancer-related pain, sedative therapy, mucosal damage, dystonic storm, and in an 
opioid-naïve patient. 
Of the remaining 312 case reports, the most frequently reported off-label uses 
were treatment of patients with non-cancer-related pain or unspecified pain 
(including headache, fracture, surgery, labour and myalgia) and opioid naïve 
patients. Other off-label indications included dyspnoea and sedation/anaesthesia. 
Multiple case reports were off-label due to an incorrect starting dose, route of

It is well known that all opioid mu-receptor agonists, including fentanyl, produce 
dose-dependent respiratory depression and as with other potent opioids, fentanyl 
has been associated with cases of serious and fatal respiratory depression in opioid 
non-tolerant individuals. The potential clinical consequences associated with 
overdose are serious if associated with an AE. It is therefore considered that there

10,000 PY for fentanyl nasal spray and 30.5 events per 10,000 PY for fentanyl 
nasal spray and unspecified fentanyl formulation combined. 
The reported PTs were Overdose (103 events), Accidental overdose (24 events), 
Prescribed overdose (15 events), and Intentional overdose (5 events). Of the

Accidental exposure refers to the accidental exposure of a person (adult or child) 
for whom PecFent was not prescribed. The impact on the individual accidently 
exposed to PecFent is potentially serious. Respiratory depression may occur, 
particularly in non-opioid-tolerant individuals, and has the potential of a fatal 
outcome. It is therefore considered that there is sufficient information to classify 
accidental exposure as an important identified risk for PecFent. 
Characterisation of the risk  Clinical trial experience: 
There were no reports of accidental exposure during clinical trials with PecFent. 
Post-marketing experience: 
Cumulatively, six valid case reports describing six events (five fentanyl nasal 
spray, one unspecified fentanyl formulation) pertaining to accidental exposure have 
been identified from the post-marketing setting. This equates to a RR of one event

nasal spray and unspecified fentanyl formulation combined. 
The reported PTs were Occupational exposure to product, Accidental exposure to 
product and Accidental exposure to product by child. Additional AEs were reported 
from three of six case reports and included Dizziness, Feeling abnormal and Motor

Other routine risk minimisation measures beyond the Product Information: 
Packaging: 
•  PecFent is available in two dose strengths, 100 mcg and 400 mcg. Each dosage 
strength bottle is identified by a colour code. These colours (yellow for 100 mcg 
and violet for 400 mcg) have been chosen as they provide sufficient visual 
differentiation, even in colour-blind patients. 
•  The metered-dose pump has been modified to deliver eight sprays, equivalent to 
only one day’s supply at the maximum dosing frequency at a dose of one spray 
of 100 mcg or 400 mcg. 
•  A red bar appears in a window on the device when the device is not ready to use 
(e.g., not primed) and moves to green when the device is ready to use (the bars 
are also different sizes to accommodate colour-blind individuals). 
•  The spray pump incorporates a numerical clearly visible and audible dose 
counter. 
•  The dose counter serves as a tamper-evident seal on the primary pack, and 
confirms to the patient when each spray has been delivered. 
•  There is an audible click after each actuation to indicate a spray has been 
delivered. 
•  The counting pump is attached to the bottle by a locking screw-thread 
mechanism. 
•  The U-save bottle design has an internal U-shape base to minimise filling 
overage and hence minimise residual liquid in the bottle at the end of use 
(around 200 mcL).

V.2 Additional risk minimisation measures  
Educational materials – Physician Guide, Pharmacist Guide and Patient/Carer Guide 
Objectives 
To minimise the risks of misuse, abuse, diversion or dependence; off-label use; medication errors; 
overdose and accidental exposure by providing education to physicians, pharmacists and 
patients/carers. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
63 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
Rationale for the additional risk minimisation activity: 
Educational materials are available to prescribing physicians and dispensing pharmacists to: 
• 
• 
facilitate the screening of patients for risks of abuse of prescription pain medication 
ensure the following of accepted guidelines for the management of high-risk patients 
•  highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection. 
Educational materials are available to prescribing physicians, pharmacists, patients and their carers to: 
•  highlight the importance of appropriate use of PecFent 
•  highlight the importance of following instructions carefully 
•  minimise the risks of misuse, abuse, diversion or dependence, off-label use, medication 
errors, overdose, and accidental exposure which have potentially serious clinical 
consequences.  
Educational materials are required to ensure prescribers and patients are as knowledgeable as possible 
regarding the safe and effective use of PecFent. 
Target audience and planned distribution path: 
Physicians, pharmacists, and patients/carers exposed to PecFent. 
Plans to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions and criteria for success: 
Effectiveness will be evaluated using routine pharmacovigilance activities, i.e., adverse reaction 
reporting and signal detection activities. Such activities are performed on an ongoing basis to identify 
any specific safety signals that would require immediate/further action. The criteria for judging the 
success of the educational materials will be demonstrated by a high level of understanding of the 
correct utilisation of PecFent in addition to a low proportion of cases received against patient 
exposure. The results of the effectiveness evaluation will be presented within the relevant section of 
the PSUR. 
Note: The training of field representatives has been removed as an additional risk minimisation measure within this version 
of the RMP and are therefore not included within Section V.2 Additional risk minimisation measures. Field representatives 
are trained in the risk minimisation measures as part of standard practice and are made aware of the non-promotional nature 
of educational materials which are the additional risk minimisation measures. In addition, Dear Doctor letters are removed as 
an additional risk minimisation measure within this version of the RMP as Kyowa Kirin has not used this additional risk 
minimisation measure. If, in the future, any need arises for this additional risk minimisation measure because of a new or 
changed risk, Kyowa Kirin would communicate appropriately with the regulatory agencies to implement such a measure.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF the Risk Management Plan     
Summary of Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
This is a summary of the Risk Management Plan for PecFent. The Risk Management Plan details 
important risks of PecFent, and how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be 
obtained about PecFent’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
PecFent’s Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its Package Leaflet (PL) give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how PecFent should be used. 
This summary of the Risk Management Plan for PecFent should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the European Public Assessment Report.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of PecFent’s Risk 
Management Plan. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
PecFent is authorised for the management of breakthrough pain (BTP) in adult patients using opioid 
therapy for chronic cancer pain. Breakthrough pain is a transient exacerbation of otherwise controlled 
chronic background pain (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains fentanyl (as citrate) as the 
active substance and is taken via intranasal administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of PecFent’s benefits can be found in PecFent’s European 
Public Assessment Report, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/pecfent. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
the risks  
Important identified risks of PecFent, together with measures to minimise such risks are outlined 
below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL and 
SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals. 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
69 
 
 
 
EU Risk Management Plan for PecFent (fentanyl citrate) 
•  Formulation of the medicine. 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of PecFent, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report assessment so that immediate action can 
be taken, as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of PecFent is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of PecFent are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate 
or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important risks can be 
regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a 
link with the use of PecFent. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the 
medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Respiratory depression or insufficiency 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In common with other opioid agonists, fentanyl can induce respiratory 
depression. It is well recognised that the potential for respiratory 
depression is greater in patients who are not receiving opioids and that use 
of fentanyl in these patients may cause more serious adverse reactions. 
Respiratory depression can potentially be life-threatening and may 
eventually result in respiratory failure with a fatal outcome. Respiratory 
depression or insufficiency is therefore considered an important identified 
risk for PecFent. 
Patients at increased risk of developing respiratory depression include 
those who: 
Risk factors and risk groups

•  Are elderly 
•  Are debilitated

Important identified risk: Local tolerability 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Because of the route of administration of PecFent, local tolerability is a 
potential issue due to the direct action of the drug on the nasal mucosa. 
However, clinical data have not identified this as a real issue as nasal 
tolerability of PecFent was high. Nonetheless, serious nasal AEs of 
epistaxis and nasal congestion were reported from clinical trials; post-
marketing safety data are in-line with that reported from the clinical 
trials. It is therefore considered that there is sufficient information to 
classify local tolerability as an important identified risk for PecFent. 
No risk groups or risk factors have been identified. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.8. 
PL Section 4. 
SmPC Section 4.4 provides a recommendation in the case of recurrent 
episodes of epistaxis or nasal discomfort.

Important identified risk: Drug misuse, abuse, diversion or dependence 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Tolerance and physical and/or psychological dependence may develop 
upon repeated administration of opioids such as fentanyl. However, 
iatrogenic addiction following therapeutic use of opioids is known to 
occur. In addition, repeated use of PecFent may lead to opioid use disorder. 
Furthermore, the potential clinical consequences of abuse and intentional 
misuse are serious and can include overdose, a risk of respiratory 
depression, death and/or physical and psychological dependence. However, 
when opioids are used under medical supervision as part of analgesia, the 
risk of abuse or misuse is considered low. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Data from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration indicate 
that fentanyl is mainly diverted via pharmacy theft, fraudulent 
prescriptions, and illicit distribution by patients and registrants. Hundreds 
of diverted items are identified in the United States each year. The 
phenomenon is also a concern in Europe, although precise figures are not 
available because systematic searches for fentanyl are not performed. 
Deaths associated with fentanyl diversion, however, have been reported in 
the United Kingdom and several European Union countries, including 
Sweden and Italy. It is therefore considered that there is sufficient 
information to classify Drug misuse, abuse, diversion and dependence as 
an important identified risk for PecFent. 
Those at an increased risk of misuse include: 
•  Patients who have a history of substance (drug) abuse 
•  Patients and prescribers who use PecFent off-label 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Sections 4.4 and 4.8. 
PL Section 4. 
SmPC Section 4.4 warns about the risk factors and consequences of abuse 
and  misuse  and  recommends  monitoring  for  signs  and  symptoms  of 
drug-seeking behaviour. Considerations to be taken upon manifestation of 
signs and symptoms are also provided. 
PL Section 2 provides the consequences of abuse and misuse, risk factors 
for abuse, and the recommendation to consult a doctor if concerned about 
developing dependency. 
SmPC Section 6.6 and PL Section 5 provides details on how to dispose of 
PecFent.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
PecFent is indicated for the management of BTP in adult patients who are 
already receiving maintenance therapy for chronic cancer pain. It is 
contraindicated in the treatment of acute pain other than BTP. The 
potential clinical consequences of off-label use are serious and can include 
a risk of respiratory depression and/or physical and psychological 
dependence. In addition, there is a potential for lack of effect or AEs when 
used outside of an indication for which there is no clinical data. It is 
therefore considered that there is sufficient information to classify off-label 
use as an important identified risk for PecFent. 
Not known. 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
The indication of use, posology and method of administration, and 
contraindications are included in SmPC Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, 
respectively, and PL Sections 1, 3 and 2, respectively.

Evidence for linking the risk to

Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Medication errors refer to unintentional prescribing/administration and or 
dispensing of PecFent, in addition to incorrect dose and route of 
administration. The potential consequences associated with medication 
errors can be serious if associated with an AE, and include the risk of 
respiratory depression or a lack of pain control. It is therefore considered 
that there is sufficient information to classify medication error as an 
important identified risk for PecFent.

Important identified risk: Overdose 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
It is well known that all opioid mu-receptor agonists, including 
fentanyl, produce dose-dependent respiratory depression and as 
with other potent opioids, fentanyl has been associated with 
cases of serious and fatal respiratory depression in opioid 
non-tolerant individuals. The potential clinical consequences 
associated with overdose are serious if associated with an AE. It 
is therefore considered that there is sufficient information to 
classify overdose as an important identified risk for PecFent.

Important identified risk: Accidental exposure 
Evidence for linking the risk to

Accidental exposure refers to the accidental exposure of a person (adult or 
child) for whom PecFent was not prescribed. The impact on the individual 
accidently exposed to PecFent is potentially serious. Respiratory 
depression may occur, particularly in non-opioid-tolerant individuals, and 
has the potential of a fatal outcome. It is therefore considered that there is 
sufficient information to classify accidental exposure as an important 
identified risk for PecFent.

carcinogenicity  studies (26-week dermal alternative bioassay in Tg.AC 
transgenic mice; two-year subcutaneous  carcinogenicity  study in rats) 
with fentanyl did not induce any findings indicative of oncogenic 
potential. Evaluation  of  brain  slides  from  the  carcinogenicity study  in 
rats  revealed brain lesions in animals administered  high doses of fentanyl 
citrate. The carcinogenicity potential of fentanyl for humans is unknown, 
although as a result of the findings from the carcinogenicity study in rats, 
brain lesions is characterised as an important potential risk for PecFent.

Renewal of the marketing authorisation.

SmPC,  Annex 
During the 5 year renewal period since launch of Samsca 
II  and PL 
(tolvapatan), there has been no additional information on 
efficacy or effectiveness (including information on lack of 
efficacy) in the authorized indication of treatment of 
hyponatraemia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate 
antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).  A number of 
safety issues have been addressed during this period via 
type II  variations, updates of the product information, and 
DHCP  letter. The risk-benefit balance of Samsca in the 
treatment of hyponatraemia secondary to the syndrome of 
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) 
remains favourable and therefore the renewal of the 
marketing authorisation with unlimited validity is 
recommended.

Since rapid correction of hyponatraemia is a potential risk 
with tolvaptan treatment and the rapid rise in serum 
sodium is known to be associated with a risk of neurological 
side effects that can be fatal or result in permanent 
damage, the purpose of this variation was to include 
relevant information on the monitoring of fluid and 
electrolyte balance, especially the levels of sodium. Further 
guidance is given on the management of rapid correction of 
serum sodium. The common adverse reaction of rapid 
correction of hyponatraemia sometimes leading to 
neurological symptoms was also included in the SmPC.

cumulative case review of case reports of rapid 
correction of hyponatraemia with the relevant safety 
information on rapid correction of hyponatraemia.  
The package leaflet is updated in accordance. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to include a 
few minor editorial changes including the update of 
details of a local representative (Italy) in the 
Package Leaflet. Furthermore, the MAH introduced 
minor clarification in section 4 of the PIL.

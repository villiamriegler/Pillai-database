2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
25 February 2016 
Lung cancer has been among the most common cancers in the world for several decades. The 2012 
worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality by GLOBOCAN, indicate a total of 1.8 million 
new lung cancer cases and 1.6 million lung cancer related deaths, accounting for 13.0% of all cancer 
cases (except non-melanoma skin cancers) and 19.4% of all cancer deaths (except non-melanoma 
skin cancers). Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to 
females (1,241,601 and 583,100, respectively). In 2013, the estimated number of lung cancer related 
deaths is 159,480 in the United States (Siegel et al 2013) and 269,610 in the European Union 
(Malvezzi et al 2013). 
The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, which is frequently further 
subdivided into non-squamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/206630/2016 
Page 6/45 
 
  
 
cell types) and squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma accounting for approximately 15% to 25% of all 
NSCLC (~230,000 to 380,000 cases)12. 
Adenocarcinoma (40% of lung cancers) is the most common type of lung cancer, and is also the most 
frequently occurring in non-smokers as reported in United States (US) data (American Cancer Society 
2013). 
Non-small cell lung cancer is associated with high mortality rates as >70% of the patients are 
diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease (Molina et al 2008) [stages III and IV according 
to the American joint committee on cancer staging (AJCC)].  
Tobacco use is the most important risk factor for lung cancer, with up to 80% of lung cancer patients 
reporting a history of tobacco use. Approximately 10% to 30% of non-SQ NSCLC occurs in patients 
with a never smoker history and a strong correlation with the presence of an activating epidermal 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation or gene translocation. Squamous NSCLC almost universally 
occur in patients with a history of tobacco use and only rarely are tumours found, which contain an 
EGFR activating mutation3.  Similarly, mutated ALK and ROS-1 appear rare and mutated KRAS has 
been reported in about 5% of squamous NSCLC, i.e. in a lower frequency than in adenocarcinoma 
(about 30%). Alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway appear common, up to close to 50%. TP53 is 
also frequently mutated4 567. 
In addition to the high mortality associated with NSCLC, a high proportion of patients experience 
severe morbidity as a result of local and metastatic spread of disease. Common morbidities include 
generalized weakness and fatigue, cough, and dyspnoea. Local spread of tumour can result in 
obstructive pneumonia, lobar collapse, haemoptysis, pain from chest wall and rib invasion, and pleural 
effusions, while distant spread to bone, brain, liver, and adrenals can lead to pain, neurologic 
sequelae, and laboratory abnormalities. Generalized effects of metastatic disease also include 
cachexia, thrombotic and embolic events, paraneoplastic conditions, and infections.  
Historically, patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC have been treated with standard 
chemotherapy and/or radiation, and while these treatments may provide modest survival benefits, 
they are rarely curative. 
Refractory SQ NSCLC  
Despite new treatments for NSCLC in the last 15 years, most of the available agents do not benefit 
patients with SQ NSCLC. Limited progress has been made in the treatment choices for these patients, 
especially in the second-line setting once their disease progresses after first-line platinum-based 
doublet chemotherapy. Recently, nivolumab, an anti-PD1 anti-body, has been approved for the 
treatment of patient with NSCLC with SQ cell histology, on the basis of a randomized trial conducted in 
272 patients where nivolumab appeared to improve median OS of about 3.2 months when compared 
with docetaxel, given as second line treatment after first line platinum-combination chemotherapy.

About the product 
Giotrif (afatinib) is an irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TKI). It 
covalently binds to and blocks signalling from all homo- and heterodimers formed by the ErbB family 
members EGFR (ErbB1), HER 2 (ErbB2), ErbB3 and ErbB4. Aberrant ErbB signalling triggered by 
receptor mutations, and/or amplification, and/or receptor ligand overexpression contributes to the 
malignant phenotype. 
Giotrif was first approved in the EU on 25 September 2013 for the following indication: 
Giotrif as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of EGFR TKI-naïve adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutation(s). 
The recommended dose is 40 mg once daily. Treatment should be continued until disease progression 
or until no longer tolerated by the patient. 
The MAH applied to extend the indication as follows: treatment of locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC of squamous histology progressing on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. 
The proposed recommended dose is the same as the one already approved. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted studies investigating the activity of afatinib in EGFR wild-type NSLC disease 
models. In addition, supplemental data on binding to secondary receptors are reported. 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The in vivo anti-tumour activity of afatinib as monotherapy was tested in 27 patient-derived non-small 
cell lung cancer xenografts expressing wild type EGFR (9/27 of squamous origin) passaged 
subcutaneously in female NMRI nude mice. Afatinib and its vehicle were administered orally (p.o.) 
once a day for 18 to 42 days (apart from dosing holidays), depending on tumour growth rates and 
efficacy. The dose volume for all treatments was 10 ml/kg, the dose of afatinib generally 12.5 mg/kg. 
The range of sensitivity towards afatinib was wide and ranged from insensitive to very sensitive. 
Tumour regressions (TGI > 100%) were observed in 3/18 adenocarcinoma and 4/9 squamous 
carcinoma models (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Efficacy of BIBW 2992 in tumour xenograft-bearing mice 
Overview over all tested tumour xenografts ordered according to increasing (A) TGI values (i.e. increasing 
sensitivity) or (B) increasing minimum T/C values (i.e. decreasing sensitivity). The statistical analysis was done on 
the last day of each experiment. Asterisks indicate statistical significance of BIBW 2992 -induced tumour growth 
inhibition relative to the vehicle control group. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
More in-depth functionality evaluations were performed for CCK4 [CCKA], MC4, α2- and β1-adrenergic 
receptors. No agonistic activity of BIBW 2992 was observed on any of the four receptors tested up to 
concentrations ranging from 10-100 μM (depending on the tested receptor). Compared with the clinical 
peak exposure, the highest respective test concentrations of BIBW 2992 were >189-, >189-, >63- and 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/206630/2016 
Page 9/45 
 
  
 
 
 
>6300-fold higher. Furthermore, no antagonistic activity of BIBW 2992 was observed on the α2 
adrenergic receptor up to the highest tested concentration of 10 μM. For CCK4 [CCKA], MC4, and β1-
adrenergic receptors, the respective IC50 concentrations were determined (22 μM, 30 μM, and 47 μM). 
The values were thus >63-, 139-, 189- and 297- fold higher than the clinical peak exposure of afatinib 
(158 nM at 50 mg). 
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The PECsurface water for the already approved NSCLC indication was calculated using the default 
value for the market penetration (0.01) and the maximum daily dose of 50 mg afatinib is the same for 
the additional squamous NSCLC indication. The PEC/PNEC ratios calculated for the original approval is 
valid also in this case: 
The screening for the potential for bioaccumulation/biomagnification as well as the screening for a risk 
for the terrestrial compartment in the approved ERA for afatinib also revealed no concern. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The submitted non-clinical data has no impact on the benefit-risk assessment and does not result in a 
need for changes to the product information. 
Afatinib is approved for use in patients with tumours with sensitizing EGFR mutations. In the indication 
applied for, EGFR mutations are rare. The mouse xenograft data show that tumours with wild-type 
EGFR can be sensitive to afatinib, but also that sensitivity is highly variable. Data were available from 
only nine xenografts from patients with SQLC, but the analyses conducted are considered 
comprehensive and properly hypothesis driven and included ligand-receptor loop activation, EGFR 
mRNA expression, Erb-related gene amplification, however, without positive findings as regards 
potential predictive value. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to the extension of indication in squamous NSCLC from a non-clinical point of 
view. The conducted xenograft studies are of obvious interest but the heterogeneity with respect to 
mutational patterns in SQLC, makes inconclusive findings highly likely. However, an outstanding 
clinical issue is related to the activity of afatinib in tumours negative by IHC for EGFR expression. The 
MAH is recommended to address this issue also from a non-clinical perspective. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of afatinib. Considering the above data, afatinib is not expected to pose a 
risk to the environment.

Tabular overview of clinical studies  
No new pharmacokinetic or specific dose – response studies have been conducted to support this 
extension of the indication. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study LUX-Lung 8 (1200.125): A randomized, open-label Phase III trial of afatinib versus 
erlotinib in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung as second-line 
therapy following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy 
Methods 
Study participants 
First patient first visit was in March 2013, primary analysis of progression free survival (PFS) was 
conducted in September 2014, and the overall survival analysis March 2015. 
Key inclusion criteria: 
The study was planned to enrol patients with a diagnosis of advanced NSCLC squamous cell histology 
who have disease progression after completion of at least 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy 
treatment in the first-line setting of advanced disease, and who are eligible to receive 2nd line therapy 
•  Squamous (or mixed) histology advanced stage NSCLC. 
•  At least 4 cycles of platinum based doublet. 
• 
Including: Relapse within 6 months after adjuvant treatment. 
•  Discontinuation due to toxicity (but not PD) after at least 2 cycles 
•  Measurable disease 
• 
• 
ECOG 0 or 1 
Tumour tissue available 
•  Adequate organ function 
Key exclusion criteria: 
• 
Prior EGFR directed therapy. 
•  Active brain metastases

EMA/CHMP/206630/2016 
Page 11/45 
 
  
 
•  Significant gastrointestinal disorder 
•  History or presence of significant cardiovascular disorders 
Treatments 
Patients received: 
- Afatinib: 40 mg once daily in treatment courses of 28 days. The dose of afatinib was permitted to be 
escalated to 50 mg at the start of Course 2 in case of minimal toxicity (defined in the study protocol) 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity 
- Erlotinib: 150 mg once daily in treatment courses of 28 days. Patients were to receive continuous 
daily treatment until the development of progressive disease or unacceptable adverse events. 
Prior EGFR directed therapy was not accepted. The erlotinib dose was in accordance with the SmPC. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the trial was to compare the efficacy of afatinib with erlotinib as second-line 
treatment in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, as measured by progression-free 
survival (PFS). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:   
PFS, as determined by central independent review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. One to 5 target lesions (not exceeding 2 lesions per organ) were to be 
identified at baseline. The central independent review was blinded for relevant data including 
investigators’ selection of target lesions. 
Imaging was performed at baseline, and weeks 8, 12, 16 and every 8 weeks thereafter. 
Secondary endpoint:   
- Overall survival (OS) 
- Objective response (defined as complete response [CR], or partial response [PR]) according to 
RECIST version 1.1 
- Disease control (defined as CR, PR, or stable disease [SD]) according to RECIST version 1.1 
- Tumour shrinkage

Sample size 
It was estimated that 372 PFS events would provide 90% power for the long-rank test, presuming a 
hazard ratio of 0.714 for afatinib relative to erlotinib (corresponding to median times of 14 vs. 10 
weeks, respectively), with a two-sided α=0.05. 
Randomisation 
The randomisation was performed in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation was stratified by the race of the 
patient (Eastern Asian vs. Non-Eastern Asian). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label trial, treated as blinded by the sponsor until the time of the primary PFS 
analysis database lock. 
Statistical methods 
The analysis of PFS considered all data collected until the cut-off date of 07 October 2013, i.e., the 
estimated date by which 372 PFS events had occurred. Three hundred seventy two was the protocol-
specified number of PFS events required for the primary analysis. Overall survival was the key 
secondary endpoint. The primary analysis of OS will be conducted when 632 death events have 
occurred. 
The alternative hypothesis of the primary analysis was that the progression-free survival time for 
patients treated with afatinib is different from that of patients who receive erlotinib. That is: 
HA: Safatinib(t)≠Serlotinib(t), for t>0 
The null hypothesis tested by this trial is: 
H0: Safatinib(t)= Serlotinib(t), for t>0 
where S(t) is the probability that a patient passes time t without dying or experiencing disease 
progression. The subscripts represent the two treatment groups of either afatinib or erlotinib. The null 
hypothesis was tested at the two-sided 0.05 level. 
Two analysis data sets were defined for this trial, the Randomised Set and the Treated Set. 
Randomised Set (RS): all patients who were randomised, regardless of whether they received 
investigational treatment. The RS was used for disposition tables and listings, tables for demographic 
and other baseline characteristics, as well as for the primary evaluation of efficacy. 
Treated Set (TS): all randomised patients who received at least one dose of investigational treatment 
(i.e., afatinib or erlotinib). Patients were allocated according to treatment actually rece3ived. The TS 
was used for the safety analysis.

EMA/CHMP/206630/2016 
Page 13/45 
 
  
 
The primary endpoint analysis was performed on the RS. A stratified log-rank test (2 sided, α = 0.05) 
was used to test for the effect of afatinib on PFS compared with erlotinib. The test was stratified by 
race (Eastern Asian vs. non-Eastern Asian). 
A Cox proportional-hazards model, stratified by race, was used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% 
confidence interval (CI) between the two treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier estimates and 95% CIs 
(using Greenwood’s standard error estimate) were tabulated at 12-week time points and included a 
comparison of the treatment arms using a z-test (approximation of the normal distribution). Kaplan-
Meier curves for the two treatment groups were also produced. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
At the time of the data cut-off, 835 patients were enrolled at 183 centres in 23 countries in Asia, 
Europe, North America, and South America and recruitment was ongoing. 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended on 24 October 2012. The main change in the conduct of the trial was the 
inclusion of patients intended for four cycles of chemotherapy but who went off after 2 cycles due to 
toxicity (not PD) became eligible.

the trial had experienced PD or death. Objectives: (1) continue accrual until 800 patients had been 
randomised, as planned; (2) partially curtail accrual to the 500 patients required for the analysis of 
PFS; or (3) stop accrual for futility, safety, or extreme efficacy (Haybittle-Peto, p <0.0001).  
The trial continued to full accrual. The MAH and the trial team remained blinded throughout this 
process and were notified only of the DMC’s final recommendation, but not the analysis result.

Ancillary analyses 
Disease progression after 1st line chemotherapy 
According to the study protocol, patients were eligible if PD was diagnosed after at least 4 cycles of 
chemotherapy. Different platinum doublets were used. The cycle time varies between regimens, 3 – 4 
weeks. A 28 days cut-off after last administration was used to mark the end of 1st line therapy as 
chemotherapy is administered in 3-4 week cycles and thus this window is considered as on treatment 
for the last received chemotherapy. The MAH reviewed the timing of progression on or after platinum-
based chemotherapy (see table below).

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In line with the pivotal study protocol, a dose escalation to a maximum of 50 mg/day may be 
considered in patients who tolerate a 40 mg/day starting dose (i.e. absence of diarrhoea, skin rash, 
stomatitis, and other adverse reactions with CTCAE Grade > 1) in the first 28 days of treatment. The 
50 mg dose of afatinib was tested in a prior study in first generation TKI refractory patients with the 
aim to overcome EGFR mutation T790M related resistance. Otherwise 40 mg once daily has been the 
selected dose in other confirmatory studies. A starting dose of 40 mg with optional increase to 50 mg 
is considered reasonable

In support of the proposed indication for the treatment of “patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC of squamous histology progressing on or after platinum-based chemotherapy” the MAH has 
conducted a randomised, erlotinib controlled study. Of note, the study was conducted open label. 
At time of initiation of the trial in 2013, docetaxel would have been the typical reference therapy, but 
erlotinib was also licensed for the treatment of patients with NSCLC after failure of at least one prior 
chemotherapy regimen. Recently, a change of importance took place due to the restriction of the 
indication to switch maintenance treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with 
EGFR activating mutations and stable disease after first-line chemotherapy. 
The restriction was due to the negative outcome of the IUNO trial. In this study, early (end of 
chemotherapy) vs. late erlotinib (at PD) was investigated in patients with NSCLC and at least stable 
disease after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR mutation positive NSCLC were excluded, 
but patients with both squamous (38%) and non-squamous tumours were eligible.  
PFS during the first “blinded” stage, erlotinib vs. no treatment, showed a HR of 0.94 (unstratified) and 
0.87 (stratified). In patients with squamous NSCLC (SQLC) the PFS HR was 0.80 (95% CI 0.61; 1.04). 
Overall survival (primary endpoint) in this comparison of early vs late erlotinib was negative (stratified 
analysis HR 1.07, unstratified HR 1.02). This was the case also for patients with SQLC: HR 1.0. This is 
expected due to planned cross-over and low activity as measured by PFS also in SQLC. 
Differences between LUX-Lung 8 and IUNO, in addition to enrolment or not of non-squamous NSCLC, 
are also related to the inclusion only of patients with progressive disease (PD) in LUX-Lung 8. 
Erlotinib is also indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after 
failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Licensure of erlotinib in this indication was based 
on the placebo-controlled study BR.21. In patients with SQLC, the OS HR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.5; 0.9). 
The HR was similar in patients treated with one or two prior chemotherapy regimens.   
The outcome of IUNO has casted some doubt on the activity of erlotinib in patients with wild type EGFR 
NSCLC. The outcome in patients with mutation positive SQLC in BR.21 is not reported separately, but 
the percentage of EGFR mutation positive was 5% in patients with non-adenocarcinoma NSCLC. Later 
studies with modern technologies have confirmed the low frequency of EGFR mutation positive SQLC. 
In 2012, the Cancer Genome Atlas reported EGFR mutation positive to be “rare” in SQLC8. There were 
no cases in 178 samples of del 19 or L858R (the most common alterations in adenocarcinoma), but 
there were two, in adenocarcinoma NSCLC uncommon mutations being sensitive to erlotinib. 
Rekhtman et al. screened 95 biomarker-verified SQLCs and found no case of EGFR mutation positive9. 
Altogether, the incidence of EGFR mutation positive in SQLC is too low to explain the positive outcome 
in patients with SQLC in study BR.21.  
Based on these findings, it is still considered appropriate to view erlotinib as an active comparator in 
LUX-Lung 8, even though PFS in patients with SQLC in the maintenance study IUNO did not reach 
statistical significance. 
As the indication for erlotinib as late line treatment of NSCLC (SQLC and non-SQLC) is restricted to 
EGFR expressing tumours, data in support of the activity afatinib were requested. In LUX-LUNG 8, 
however, there were only 60 samples available for EGFR expression analysis. As the estimated 
proportion of EGFR negative tumours by IHC in patients with SQLC, is about 5%10, the sample size did 
not allow conclusions as regards activity in this subgroup. Thus there is no clinical evidence in support

of activity of afatinib in this subgroup, even though the panErb inhibitory character at least opens for 
the possibility, in contrast to EGFR targeting MoAbs and erlotinib. 
Altogether and in a superiority study there are no objections to the selected reference regimen; 
erlotinib is sufficiently likely to be active in terms of OS in patients with SCC in the target population of 
this study. 
The conduct of the study as open label is justified by the MAH by differences in the expected toxicity 
profiles, afatinib being more prone to induce e.g. diarrhoea. Qualitatively, however, the safety profiles 
are similar and in order to reduce possible bias in the reporting of safety and PRO data it would have 
been preferable at least to initiate the study as double blind and to unblind assigned treatment when 
dose reduction was considered. 
The primary endpoint was PFS, but mature OS data have been submitted in support. The planned 
primary PFS analysis showed only statistically borderline results (p=0.04). OS data, however, are 
considered statistically more robust, p=0.008 based on mature event rates, >75% of the events in the 
long run. 
During the review of the application, the wording of the indication encompassing patients progressing 
on platinum-based chemotherapy was questioned. The MAH provided further information regarding 
inclusion of patients with disease progression on or after 1st line chemotherapy within the study LUX-
Lung 8 which provided reassurance regarding the targeted patient population. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The HRs for PFS and OS are very similar, meaning that the absolute OS benefit is larger than the PFS 
benefit. This is not unexpected in NSCLC at hazard ratios not far from 1. Furthermore, there are no 
signs of imbalances in next-line therapies. The independent and investigator derived HRs for PFS are 
also very similar despite the higher censoring rates in the independent review.  
None of the OS subgroup analyses raise specific concerns. As for most molecules studied in SQLC, no 
difference in OS between treatment arms was observed in older patients however the activity of 
erlotinib in older patients with SQLC in study BR.21 has not been reported. As a consequence, 
information regarding the OS data in older patients has been reported in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Three PRO instruments (including EQ5D) were used however no primary hypothesis was defined and 
multiplicity issues were not addressed. In addition, the study was conducted open label. General 
claims, such as improved physical, role, cognitive and emotional functioning were therefore not 
accepted and actually found implausible due to the small difference in anti-tumour activity and added 
adverse reactions. However, a table reporting disease related symptoms (cough, dyspnoea and pain) 
was accepted for inclusion in the SmPC. 
Exploratory, e.g. genetic biomarker analyses, were to be conducted, but have not been reported yet. 
The As EGFR by IHC has been reported to be of interest for cetuximab activity, at least these data 
would be of putative value as the survival benefit in the whole study population is modest. The MAH is 
recommended to conduct genetic biomarker analyses. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Sufficiently methodologically robust study data support the conclusion that a modest survival benefit 
has been shown in comparison with the licensed medicinal product erlotinib.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of afatinib in the treatment of NSCLC is relatively well characterised based on 
previously assessed confirmatory NSCLC trials, first-line and after failure on first generation TKIs. The 
assessment is focused on the results from the LUX-Lung 8 study. 
Patient exposure 
By convention Adverse Events included events up to 28 days after end of treatment. About 35% of 
patients in both study arms initiated next-line therapy during this period of time. The cut-off for AE 
reporting was March 2015. 
The duration of therapy was slightly longer in the afatinib arm: mean 121 vs. 97 days, median 65 vs. 
58 days.

Adverse events of special interest 
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea was more frequently reported in the afatinib group (see table above). Time to onset was 
typically <4 weeks. Altogether 16 patients (4%) in the afatinib group and 6 (1.5%) in the erlotinib 
group discontinued due to diarrhoea.  
The diarrhoea substudy enrolled only 36 + 27 patients. The reported duration of grade 3 diarrhoea was 
3 days in the afatinib group. 
Rash 
Rather similar between groups (table above). Time to onset was typically < 4 w. Dose reductions due 
to rash were reported in 6% (afatinib) and 9% (erlotinib) and discontinuations in 2.6% and 2%, 
respectively. 
Renal impairment events  
Table 18: Frequency [N (%)] of patients with renal failure, clinical consequences, outcome and time of 
onset by treatment, treated set- study LUX-Lung 8 
An increase in renal events was observed in the afatinib arm (table above). Fatal events were reported 
in 2 (afatinib) and 1 (erlotinib) patients.

Table 19: Patients with renal failure by treatment, primary system organ class and preferred term − 
treated set: on−treatment analysis - study LUX-Lung 8 
Of note, among afatinib treated patients, the renal event occurred post treatment in 10 patients and 
was classified as drug-related in 3 cases. On therapy there were 7 events and 4 were reported as 
drug-related. One fatal, day 26 post treatment event was reported as drug related.  
Stomatitis 
The adverse events of stomatitis were more commonly reported in the afatinib arm, 30% vs. 11% in 
the erlotinib arm. In three individuals the event was classified as SAE. Dose reductions were reported 
in 3% in the afatinib arm vs. none, discontinuation 1% in the afatinib arm vs. none. 
Hepatic impairment events

Page 30/45 
 
  
 
 
 
These events were more commonly reported in the erlotinib arm, but events considered drug-related 
were reported in similar frequencies. Dose reductions and discontinuations were infrequent, <1% in 
both study arms. There was one fatal event in the erlotinib arm. 
Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations were 
observed in 1.6% (LUX-Lung 8) of patients with normal baseline liver tests treated with 40 mg/day. 
There were no Grade 3 ALT/AST elevations in patients with abnormal baseline liver tests in LUX-Lung 
8. 
Heart failure (HF) 
HF is of potential interest due to HER2 inhibition (afatinib). Of note patients were excluded if there was 
a “History or presence of clinically relevant cardiovascular abnormalities such as uncontrolled 
hypertension, congestive heart failure NYHA classification of 3, unstable angina or poorly controlled 
arrhythmia as determined by the, investigator, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to 
randomization.” 
Table 21: Frequency [N (%)] of patients with heart failure, clinical consequences, outcome and time of 
onset by treatment, treated set- study LUX-Lung 8 
In this selected group of patients there was no difference between treatment arms and the event rate 
was rather low (2%) taking into account the target population, even though selected.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) 
Table 22: Frequency [N (%)] of patients with ILD, clinical consequences, outcome and time of onset by 
treatment, treated set- study LUX-Lung 8 
The overall incidence (about 2%) is rather similar in the study arms and the event was considered 
drug related in about 1%. Treatment was discontinued in 3+3 individuals.  
In the pooled safety data of all patients treated with afatinib monotherapy, the frequency of ILD-like 
adverse reactions were reported in 0.7% of treated patients. 
Pancreatitis 
Pancreatitis has been classified as an important potential risk. There were no cases of pancreatitis 
identified in the afatinib group. In the erlotinib group, 1 patient experienced a serious post-treatment 
event of pancreatitis that was considered not related to erlotinib and resolved after 12 days.

Table 29: Adverse events occurring with >10% incidence in the afatinib arm within age categories 
(<65) by treatment, treated set- study LUX-Lung 8 
Renal AEs were higher among older Afatinib treated patients, with drug related events  observed in 
less than 5% in either age group. More than half of the renal impairment AEs in afatinib treated 
patients were defined  by the investigator as not drug related. Review of drug-related renal SAEs due 
to diarrhoea showed age did not impact the  frequency of renal AEs. 
Only 2 patients >70 years of age out of 122 (1.6%) developed diarrhoea related renal  failure (or renal 
SAEs) indicating that diarrhoea induced pre-renal insufficiency is  manageable in elderly patients. 
GI adverse reactions did not show significant differences in the two age groups. Diarrhoea was more 
frequently reported in elderly patients in both study arms.  
Renal impairment 
Afatinib-treated patients with moderately impaired renal function at baseline (creatinine clearance 30 
to <60 mL/minute) had a higher overall incidence of AEs as compared to patients with normal renal 
function (creatinine clearance ≥90 mL/minute) or mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance 
60 to <90 mL/minute). Patients with moderately impaired renal function also reported a higher 
incidence of diarrhoea and stomatitis, had a higher incidence of Grade 3 AEs and had a higher 
incidence of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. In the erlotinib group, there were no consistent 
trends were noted when examining AEs by renal function subgroup.

Table 31: Cumulative incidence of permanent discontinuation due to AE by treatment, treated set - 
study LUX-Lung 8 
Altogether 11% vs. 5% of AEs leading to discontinuation were considered drug related by the 
investigator in the afatinib and erlotinib arms respectively, the difference largely attributable to 
diarrhoea and stomatitis. 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction 
Diarrhoea was the leading cause of dose reduction in the afatinib arm whilst rash dominated in the 
erlotinib arm.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Afatinib is currently approved in more than 60 countries and the overall cumulative patient exposure to 
marketed Giotrif is estimated to be 5086 patient-years from July 2013 to March 2015. 
In general, the safety pattern in the post-marketing experience has been consistent with that observed 
in the clinical trials. The majority of the AEs are related to EGFR inhibition (e.g. diarrhoea, rash) and 
the underlying disease. Characteristics of key risks such as ILD and cardiac disorders have been 
consistent with clinical trial data.  
The adverse event profile of afatinib in LUX Lung 8 is very similar to what has been reported in prior 
first-line studies. Actually no new safety concerns have been identified. The major benefit from a 
safety evaluation perspective was the head to head comparison with erlotinib, being a reversible EGFR 
TK inhibitor. The only major differences are related to diarrhoea, mucositis and paronychia, probably 
due to the pan ErbB mechanism of action of afatinib. Irrespective of the type of event, most of the 
new/worsening of events were reported during the first 2 cycles. 
The most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 3%) in the afatinib treatment group were pneumonia (6.6%), 
malignant neoplasm progression (5.9%), diarrhoea (4.6%), dehydration (3.1%), and dyspnoea 
(3.1%).  
In the erlotinib group, the most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 3%) were dyspnoea (7.6%), pneumonia 
(4.1%), malignant neoplasm progression (4.1%), and respiratory failure (3.0%). 
SAEs considered related were more frequently reported in the afatinib arm, 12 vs. 6%. Differences in 
diarrhoea and dehydration made up for most of this difference. 
In relation to the reported fatal events, it is difficult to determine causality: underlying disease, co-
morbidity, treatment, or an interaction between treatment and disease. 
Total AEs leading to death were similar between treatment arms. An apparent increase is seen for 
infectious events and general disorders in the afatinib arm and in the control, respiratory and 
cardiovascular. Also “drug related” events leading to death appear similar without informative 
patterns. 
Further to the CHMP request, the applicant provided data to support the claim that dose reduction 
would lead to AE grade reduction which was considered acceptable. 
About 35% of patients initiated next-line therapy during the 28 days after end of treatment, however, 
this has not confounded the incidence of AEs. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No new safety concern has been identified on the basis of the data submitted in support of this 
application. Available safety data are sufficient to support a risk-benefit assessment in patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC of squamous histology progressing on or after platinum-based 
chemotherapy. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

The  PRAC,  having  considered  the  data  submitted,  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  proposed  post-
authorisation pharmacovigilance development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of 
the product.  
The  PRAC  also  considered  that  routine  pharmacovigilance  remains  sufficient  to  monitor  the 
effectiveness of the risk minimisation measures.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet was not performed and it has 
been found acceptable for the following reasons: changes made to the package leaflet were not 
considered significant and were not affecting its readability. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
A survival benefit of 1.1 months (6.8 vs. 7.9 m HR=0.81 [95% CI 0.69; 0.95], p=0.008) has been 
shown over erlotinib. Whilst modest, the data are mature and considered sufficiently robust. 
PFS was the primary endpoint and at the primary analysis, the p-value was borderline statistically 
significant p= 0.043. At time of the updated PFS analysis, the p-value for the independent review 
analysis was 0.01 and the HR=0.8 (95% CI, 0.69; 0.96). The absolute benefit in terms of difference in 
medians was small (1.9 vs. 2.4 m.). 
With respect to PRO data, it is accepted that descriptive information related to symptom control are 
included in section 5.1 of the SmPC despite deficiencies in the planning of the study. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The MAH has reported extensive data derived from analyses using the Foundation One Next generation 
sequencing platform and human explants mouse xenografts. No biomarkers, however, have been 
identified of predictive value. This is perhaps not surprising due to the extreme heterogeneity in SQCL 
as regards putative driving and passenger mutations. Thus available data do not at this stage allow the 
identification of patients likely to derive more benefit from the treatment with afatinib and the 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

applicant is recommended to further investigate genetic biomarkers of efficacy. 
No OS benefit over erlotinib has been shown in patients above 65 (70) years of age and the activity of 
erlotinib in older patients with SQLC is unknown (Tarceva EPAR). 
Even though there is a potential for anti-tumour activity of this panErb inhibitor in patients with SQLC 
with EGFR negative tumours by IHC, the efficacy of afatinib has not been established. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The most frequently reported grade 3 ADRs in the pivotal trial were diarrhoea (9.9%), rash (5.4%), 
stomatitis (4.1%) and decreased appetite (3.1%). 
A benefit from the perspective of the assessment of safety is the comparison of this pan ErbB inhibitor 
with erlotinib an ErbB1 (EGFR-TK) inhibitor. This comparison reveals a clear increase in diarrhoea, 
mucositis and paronychia at rather similar levels of rash/acne.  
The safety profile as documented in prior studies remains essentially unaltered. 
Altogether 9% vs. 4% (afatinib vs. erlotinib) of AEs leading to discontinuation were considered drug 
related by the investigator, the difference largely attributable to diarrhoea and stomatitis.  Overall 18 
vs. 14% discontinued due to AEs. Taking number of patients at risk, there was no difference between 
study arms.  
Dose reductions were undertaken in about 24 and 12% of patients treated with afatinib and erlotinib, 
respectively. 
It has been clearly shown that dose reductions lead to reduction of stomatitis and diarrhoea.  
Diarrhoea is the main concerns from a tolerability perspective and dehydration and pre-renal renal 
events have been reported, but at a rather low level also in patients above 70 years of age. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Missing data as regards patients with non-trivial heart disorders remains a potential concern due to 
inhibition of HER2/ErbB2.

Dose reduction reduces grade. 
Mature and reliable survival data have been provided and the safety profile of afatinib, taking prior 
confirmatory studies into account, is considered sufficiently well documented for a benefit – risk 
assessment. Overall, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive in view of the survival advantage 
and acceptable toxicity profile. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The benefit-risk balance of Giotrif in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC of 
squamous histology progressing on or after platinum-based chemotherapy is considered positive. The 
MAH is recommended to further investigate the activity/efficacy of afatinib according to biomarkers (in 
particular EGFR status).

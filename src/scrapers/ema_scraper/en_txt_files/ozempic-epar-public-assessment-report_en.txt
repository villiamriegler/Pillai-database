1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Novo Nordisk A/S submitted on 5 December 2016 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Ozempic, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 26 February 2015. 
The applicant applied for the following indications: 
Glycaemic control 
Ozempic is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as: 
Monotherapy 
When diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom the use 
of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications. 
Add-on therapy 
In combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including insulin, when these, together 
with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
Prevention of cardiovascular events 
Ozempic is indicated to prevent cardiovascular events (see section 5.1) in adults with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and high cardiovascular risk, as an adjunct to standard treatment of cardiovascular risk 
factors. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that semaglutide was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0095/2015 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0095/2015 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) is a progressive chronic metabolic disease primarily characterised by 
abnormal glucose metabolism. Data support a heterogeneous pathogenesis that involves 
environmental, lifestyle, and genetic components leading to chronic hyperglycaemia caused by insulin 
resistance in the peripheral tissue, reduced insulin production in the pancreatic β-cells and increased 
hepatic glucose release. 
Cardiovascular (CV) disease is the leading cause of death in patients with diabetes, and CV morbidity is 
more prevalent in patients with diabetes than those without. Diabetes, alongside smoking, obesity, 
hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension account for most of the risk for heart disease and stroke 
worldwide. 
Requested therapeutic indications: 
Glycaemic control 
Ozempic is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control as: 
Monotherapy 
When diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom the use 
of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications. 
Add-on therapy 
In combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including insulin, when these, together 
with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control. 
Prevention of cardiovascular events 
Ozempic is indicated to prevent cardiovascular events (see section 5.1) in adults with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and high cardiovascular risk, as an adjunct to standard treatment of cardiovascular risk 
factors.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017  
Page 9/156 
 
 
 
 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Close to 9% (415 million) of adults worldwide have diabetes with T2D accounting for ~90% of the 
diabetes cases. Glycaemic control is fundamental for the management of T2D to reduce the risk of 
T2D-related complications. While an increasing number of agents to treat diabetes exist, data collected 
from 2007−2010 demonstrate that close to 50% of all patients treated for their T2D do not achieve 
the recommended blood glucose target of an HbA1c <7% and are thus at increased risk of T2D-related 
complications. 
The manifestations of CV disease often accompanying diabetes include ischaemic heart disease, stroke, 
peripheral artery disease, and congestive heart failure. Myocardial infarction is 2–4 times more 
frequent in men with diabetes, and 4−5 times more frequent in women with diabetes compared with 
those without diabetes. Improved CV outcomes in T2D can be achieved by addressing several risk 
factors including blood pressure, lipid levels and glucose control. 
A well-known risk factor for hyperglycaemia, T2D and eventually risk of CV disease is obesity, an 
emerging epidemic in developing countries. A moderate weight loss of 5% improves glycaemic control 
and CV risk factors in patients with T2D, and thereby provides beneficial effects in T2D. Thus, anti-
hyperglycaemic products that, in addition to lowering HbA1c, also reduce body weight provide 
additional clinical benefits to patients with T2D and on CV risk factors. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is both an incretin hormone secreted from the L-cells in the small 
intestine and a neuropeptide produced in the brain. The hormone stimulates insulin secretion and 
inhibits glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets in a glucose-dependent manner. Patients with 
T2D have a decreased response to endogenous incretins (GLP-1 and Glucose-dependent insulinotropic 
peptide (GIP)), but can respond to the blood glucose lowering effect of GLP-1 when administered at 
supraphysiological levels. Native GLP 1 and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) also reduce body 
weight by lowering energy intake by inducing feelings of satiety and fullness and lowering feelings of 
hunger. 
In addition to the pancreas and the hypothalamus, GLP-1 receptors are also expressed in the heart, 
the vasculature, cells of the immune system and the kidney and may thus mediate cardiovascular and 
microvascular effects. In humans, GLP-1 RAs lower systolic blood pressure and increase pulse rate and 
data from 2016 show improvements in cardiovascular outcomes following 3 years of treatment in a 
clinical trial. Altogether, these data suggest that targeting of the GLP-1 receptor with a GLP-1 RA can 
reduce CV risk. 
GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs thus target several aspects of the treatment of T2D, including glycaemic control, 
weight loss and possibly reduction of CV risk. Due to the short half-life of <1.5 minutes after i.v. 
administration, native GLP 1 is not suitable for therapeutic use. To realise the full therapeutic potential 
of GLP-1, the pharmacokinetic effect and hence the pharmacodynamic effect need to be protracted. 
2.1.4.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are several classes of medicinal products for the treatment of T2D. All products have been 
shown to reduce blood glucose level, and to improve HbA1c. Based on the extensive therapeutic 
experience (including possible CV benefits), metformin is currently recommended as first-line 
treatment for all patients with T2D, unless contraindications apply (most notably, GFR < 30 ml/min).

Recently, empagliflozin (SGLT2-inhibitor) and liraglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) have shown to be 
superior compared to placebo in reducing 3-point MACE in a CV outcome trial. 
2.1.5.  About the product 
Semaglutide is a new GLP-1 RA and is structurally similar to liraglutide but modified to have a longer 
half-life, suitable for once weekly (OW) dosing. The extended half-life of the semaglutide molecule is 
primarily obtained by increased albumin binding, which is facilitated by a large fatty acid-derived 
chemical moiety attached to the lysine in position 26. The specific modifications in the GLP-1 molecule 
are: 1) a modification in position 8 (alanine to 2-aminoisobutyric acid) of the peptide backbone to 
increase stability against dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), and a change in position 34 from a lysine to 
an arginine to limit the options for acylation to the one remaining lysine in the sequence; 2) a large 
hydrophilic spacer between the lysine in position 26 and the gamma glutamate whereto the fatty acid 
is attached; 3) a C18 fatty di-acid with a terminal acidic group. The spacer and the fatty acid both 
contribute to increased albumin binding, which slows the degradation of semaglutide in plasma and 
results in decreased renal clearance prolonging the half-life of semaglutide to approximately 1 week 
making it suitable for OW s.c. administration. 
The clinical development of semaglutide includes sixteen completed Phase 1 studies, one Phase 2 
study and eight completed Phase 3 studies and one ongoing trial. Furthermore, a population 
pharmacokinetic and an exposure response analysis has been conducted, the Pop PK study used data 
from five Phase 3 studies (3623, 3626, 3624, 3744 and 4091). The dossier also includes nine in vitro 
studies using human samples or human cell material.  
The studies were performed in line with the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in 
the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus. 
Initially the applicant also requested to include an indication: “Prevention of cardiovascular events” 
which was rejected by CHMP.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Semaglutide is a long acting analogue of human glucagon like-1 peptide i.e. an Aib8, Arg34-GLP-1(7-
37) analogue substituted on the ε-amino group of the lysine residue in position 26 with an (S)-22,40-
dicarboxy-10,19,24-trioxo-3,6,12,15-tetraoxa-9,18,23-triazatetracontan-1-oyl side chain. The side 
chain consists of two 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (ADO) spacers, one γ-glutamic acid (Glu) spacer, 
and a fatty diacid (1,18-octadecanedioic acid). Semaglutide is produced using recombinant DNA 
technology in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and chemical modification. 
The structural formula of semaglutide is given in Figure 1.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing process 
The manufacturing process for semaglutide active substance consists of a fermentation process in 
yeast cells, recovery and purification of semaglutide precursor. The semaglutide precursor is subjected 
to a synthetic modification process and purified. All steps have been described and explained.  
The harvested culture broth from the fermentation process is split into several batches at delivery to 
recovery. The subsequent steps in recovery and purification (including modification) are all performed 
as batch processes, and unique batch numbers are assigned at designated steps. 
In addition to the active substance itself three other intermediates are isolated and storage conditions 
and shelf life are defined. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical operational parameters and critical in-process tests are defined for process steps. Critical in-
process tests focus on microbial contamination and product purity (host cell proteins (HCP) and 
product related impurities). 
A small set of critical operational parameters have been defined for the multistep process as has been 
supported by the evaluation studies in manufacturing process development. This limited selection and 
the fact that only these parameters have been fixed in the process description did raise questions on 
the criticality assignment. The issue was adequately addressed.

Process validation 
The manufacturing process design consists of process characterisation and process justification. This is 
followed by process performance qualification (PPQ) on consecutive batches, confirming that the 
semaglutide manufacturing process is capable of consistently producing semaglutide active substance 
of the required quality in manufacturing scale. 
To ensure that the semaglutide active substance manufacturing process remains in a state of control 
during commercial manufacture and that the validated state following PPQ is maintained, ongoing 
process verification (referred to as continued process verification) has been initiated. 
Based on the totality of the experiments performed during process justification, ranges of both critical 
and non-critical operational parameters and the acceptance criteria for the critical in-process tests 
have been supported. Steps having one or more critical operational parameters have been defined as 
critical steps. The purity of the peptide before further chemical modification is specified. The results 
from the PPQ of the critical operational parameters, critical in-process tests, and the results of the 
semaglutide active substance specification tests were all consistent for the fermentation, recovery, and 
purification batches and all acceptance criteria were fulfilled. Based on these results it is concluded that 
the semaglutide manufacturing process consistently produces semaglutide active substance of 
reproducible quality in accordance with the predetermined specifications, the process is considered 
validated and ready for commercial production. 
The evaluation of impurity reduction was carried out at manufacturing scale covering representative 
production batches from the PPQ.  
•  Control of materials 
The construction of the expression plasmid and the source and history of S cerevisiae strain 
([Arg34]GLP-1-(9-37)) producing semaglutide precursor are described in detail. The cell bank system 
(master cell bank (MCB), working cell bank (WCB)) is explained and characterisation of MCB, WCB are 
reported. Stability results of MCB and WCB are available and the results comply with the specification 
acceptance criteria for the MCB and WCB. 
No animal-derived substances are used in the production of semaglutide. 
•  Manufacturing process development 
Description and explanation of every change during product and process development is presented, 
batch analysis data and the use of the batch is indicated.  
Comparability and stability data demonstrates that the process has been improved during development 
with respect to impurity levels and robustness of the manufacturing process. The changes made during 
development have not adversely affected the product with respect to quality, safety, or efficacy. 
Characterisation  
Structural characterisation and elucidation of the physico-chemical properties of semaglutide have 
been performed using active substance batches representative of the manufacturing process used for 
phase 3 clinical trials and intended for the commercial product. The results of the structural 
characterisation of semaglutide have confirmed the expected and theoretical structure. 
The bioactivity of semaglutide is determined by a cell based bioactivity assay, which indirectly 
measures adenylate cyclase activation of the cloned human GLP-1 receptor. The bioactivity of isolated

semaglutide related impurities has been investigated by isolation of the semaglutide main peak and 
major semaglutide related impurities from semaglutide active substance, followed by testing for 
content and purity of each peak by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) 
and bioactivity. An evaluation of the correlation between the bioactivity and the content determined by 
RP-HPLC of semaglutide in active substance and finished product, including forced degraded samples, 
is provided. It is concluded that the RP-HPLC analytical procedure established for the determination of 
main peak content in the semaglutide active substance and finished product specifications offers a 
reliable measure of the bioactivity of semaglutide in both active substance and finished product. 
Product-related impurities are structurally related to semaglutide. They are generated as by-products 
in fermentation by the host organism as well as in the recovery and purification process of semaglutide 
precursor, in the modification steps and in the purification process of semaglutide. 
The major impurity peaks from semaglutide active substance have been isolated and the identity of the 
components present in each peak has been determined by high resolution liquid chromatography mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS). 
It is noted that information given on control of product-related impurities solely relies on impurities as 
detected by either RP-HPLC or size-exclusion HPLC (SE-HPLC). It was confirmed that these techniques 
are able to detect all potential impurities. 
Specification  
The active substance specification includes control of identity, purity, bioactivity and other general 
tests. 
Method descriptions and validation of test methods have been provided. 
The analytical procedures are described and validation reports have been provided. 
The analytical results for relevant semaglutide active substance batches are presented. The batches 
have been used for non-clinical studies, clinical trials (early phase 1 and 2 trials), clinical pharmacology 
and phase 3 trials, stability studies, reference material, process performance qualification, and setting 
of specifications. Data is presented as ranges obtained within the given campaign. All batch release 
data shown comply with the active substance specification for semaglutide, which was in force at the 
time for releasing the batches.  
Justification of individual specification parameters and acceptance criteria is provided. A systematic 
and risk-based approach has been used to establish the control strategy of semaglutide active 
substance. The resulting control strategy for semaglutide active substance is a planned set of controls 
which are derived from accumulated product and process understanding and hereby ensures process 
performance and product quality. 
•  Reference standards 
A Novo Nordisk A/S reference material hierarchy has been established for semaglutide, consisting of a 
semaglutide primary reference material (PRM) and a semaglutide secondary reference material (SRM). 
The content of the semaglutide PRM was assigned upon an analytical determination of nitrogen 
content, related to the theoretical content of nitrogen in semaglutide, and corrected for Sum of 
impurities by RP-HPLC. The semaglutide PRM serves as reference for identification and calibrator for

assignment of Content to semaglutide SRM, as well as to confirm bioactivity expressed as Specific 
bioactivity to semaglutide SRMs. 
Semaglutide SRM is used for quality control of semaglutide active substance and finished product for 
identification and determination of Content, as well as to determine the biological activity expressed as 
Specific bioactivity of semaglutide active substance. 
Stability 
The semaglutide active substance, is stored frozen below or at 20°C.  
All data for each test parameter from both supportive, primary, and PPQ studies, when stored at -
20°C ± 5°C, are within the acceptance criteria and show no change over time. Furthermore, the 
batches have comparable trends. In addition, all data for each test parameter from both supportive, 
primary, and PPQ studies, when stored at accelerated condition at +5°C ± 3°C, show no change over 
time. The batches have comparable trends. 
The proposed shelf-life of 60 months is acceptable. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
Semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml solution for injection is a clear and colourless solution filled into a 1.5 ml 
cartridge, assembled in a PDS290 pen-injector. Semaglutide finished product comprises the following 
ingredients: semaglutide (active substance), disodium phosphate, dehydrate (buffer agents), 
propylene glycol (tonicity agents), phenol (preservative), hydrochloric acid (pH adjustment), sodium 
hydroxide (pH adjustment), and water for injections (solvent) The primary packaging is a 1.5 mL 
cartridge. The 1.5 mL cartridge is assembled in a PDS290 pen-injector for semaglutide 1.34 mg/mL. 
Excipients are well known and approved for several EU licensed medicinal products. 
Finished product understanding has been achieved based on prior knowledge of glucagon-like-peptide-
1 (GLP-1) analogue products, formulation development studies, and risk assessment of the 
manufacturing process. 
Different buffer systems and tonicity agents have been investigated; these did not improve product 
stability.  
The formulation and filling process of semaglutide finished product manufactured for phase 1, phase 2 
and phase 3 clinical trials is identical to the manufacturing process for the product to be marketed, 
with minor modifications. Analytical data for PPQ batches produced at the commercial scale do not 
indicate an impact (if any) on the product CQA following the introduction of these minor changes. In 
the section Process validation and/or evaluation, more detailed information is provided about the 
process development studies and justification for the intended commercial manufacturing process at 
commercial scale. All batches of semaglutide finished product used for phase 3 clinical trials have been 
manufactured in the same production plant facility in Denmark, which will also be used for 
manufacturing of the commercial finished product. 
Although only a very high level overview is provided about the development studies in support of the 
chosen formulation, the formulation is considered to be justified in view of the available stability data 
and is supported by the product’s safety and efficacy data.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
•  Manufacturing 
Semaglutide 1.34 mg/mL solution for injection filled in a 1.5 mL cartridge is manufactured by Novo 
Nordisk A/S, Denmark.  
Briefly, semaglutide active substance is dissolved in a solution containing all excipients and diluted with 
water for injections to obtain the desired weight. The pH is adjusted if needed by adding diluted 
sodium hydroxide or diluted hydrochloric acid. The final solution is sterile filtered into the stainless 
steel filling tank. Finally, the solution is filled aseptically into sterilized and depyrogenated 1.5 ml 
cartridges.  
The inspected cartridges are assembled in the PDS290 pen-injector for semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml. After 
final assembly, the PDS290 pen-injector for semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml is labelled and packed in cartons 
before final release.  
The critical steps together with limits and actions for critical in-process controls for semaglutide 
finished product are listed. 
•  Process validation  
Validation activities have been performed to confirm that the manufacturing process for semaglutide 
finished product is capable of consistently and reproducibly producing finished product of the required 
quality in commercial manufacturing scale. The process validation activities encompass: a) Process 
design, including process characterisation and process justification, b) Process performance 
qualification (PPQ), and c) Ongoing process verification. 
The process justification program was designed based on a risk assessment of the semaglutide finished 
product manufacturing process summarising the experience from productions of clinical trial batches 
and development studies. The process justification was performed with scalable parameters (batch size 
independent) and non-scalable parameters (batch size dependent and/or equipment specific).  
The process performance qualification programme (PPQ) was designed on the basis of the conclusions 
from the process justification. Three consecutive batches of semaglutide finished product have been 
manufactured in commercial scale. The study design for the process performance qualification of 
semaglutide finished product covers a) In-process controls, b) extensive sampling and c) additional 
sampling. Based on the results from the PPQ, it can be concluded that the manufacturing process for 
semaglutide finished product is in a validated state and suited commercial production. 
Product specification 
The specifications for semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml solution for injection in a 1.5 ml cartridge, assembled in 
a PDS290 pen-injector includes control of identity and other general tests. 
Analytical procedures are described and validated according to relevant ICH guidelines or reference is 
made to compendial requirements (Ph. Eur.).

•  Batch analyses 
An extensive overview of the batch analysis testing results of semaglutide finished product batches 
used during development is provided. Dose accuracy data for three batches of PDS290 pen-injector for 
semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml are presented as part of the container closure documentation. 
•  Characterisation of impurities 
A characterisation study was conducted to characterise the semaglutide related impurities generated 
during the manufacture and storage of semaglutide finished product. No new impurities of semaglutide 
were found to be generated during the manufacturing of semaglutide finished product.  
• 
Justification of specifications 
The specification takes into consideration the consistency in the manufacturing process and the 
analytical procedure. After phase 3 and before submission, the acceptance criteria for impurities have 
been narrowed where justified. No release testing for bioactivity is proposed. According to the 
applicant, the bioactivity is indirectly controlled by the specification parameter Content of semaglutide, 
as a direct correlation has been demonstrated between the bioactivity of semaglutide finished product 
and Content of semaglutide (Content by RP-HPLC), independent of the degree of degradation of the 
semaglutide finished product. This approach has also been accepted for other GLP-1 analogues. A 
number of issues were raised on the justification of specifications and were adequately addressed. A 
systematic and risk-based approach has been used to establish the control strategy of semaglutide 
finished product. 
Elemental impurities in semaglutide finished product have been assessed in alignment with ICH Q3D.  
•  Container closure system 
The container closure system for semaglutide 1.34 mg/mL solution for injection comprises the primary 
packaging and the PDS290 pen-injector for semaglutide 1.34 mg/mL. The PDS290 pen-injector is 
currently approved for delivery of several insulin and GLP-1 products in the EU. 
The glass cartridge complies with the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) (type I glass).The PDS290 
pen-injector for semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml can deliver doses of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg. 
The PDS290 pen-injector is intended to function with a standard needle thread or a needle with a 
bayonet coupling. The PDS290 pen-injector for semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml is the device part of a drug-
device combination product according to the Council Directive 93/42/EEC concerning Medical Devices, 
Article 1 (3). Such products are regulated according to Directive 2001/83/EC relating to medicinal 
products for human use. The PDS290 pen-injector for semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml complies with ISO 
11608-1 (Needle-based injection systems for medical use –Requirements and test methods – Part 1: 
Needle-based injection systems). 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for semaglutide is 36 months when stored in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C) and 
kept away from the cooling element, protected from light.

The stability programme for G101semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml solution for injection (referred to as 
semaglutide finished product) was performed according to current ICH guidelines.  
No changes in formulation and primary container closure system were introduced between production 
of the primary stability batches and process performance qualification (PPQ) batches. 
Primary stability batches and PPQ batches were all produced in the same production facility. 
All long term and accelerated stability studies were performed on semaglutide finished product in 
primary containers (1.5 mL cartridge). In order to perform the Dose accuracy test, the 1.5 mL 
cartridges were assembled in the PDS290 pen-injector. The primary container closure system used in 
the presented studies is identical to the one intended for market. 
Collectively, the presented data support the proposed shelf life, i.e. 36 months when stored in a 
refrigerator (2°C to 8°C) and kept away from the cooling element, protected from light. After first use, 
the product should be stored below 30°C or in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). An in-use shelf-life for the 
pen, when stored below 30°C, of 6 weeks is accepted. 
Adventitious agents 
The semaglutide precursor peptide is produced from a yeast strain. Yeast is not a host for mammalian 
viruses. The cell line has been tested for microbial purity. As no further raw materials or excipients of 
human or animal origin are used for the manufacture of semaglutide, the finished product is evaluated 
to be safe with regards to TSE agents and there is no risk of contaminating the product with 
mammalian viruses. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
It is concluded that adequate information has been provided on process description, the justification of 
the process conditions which is supported by the manufacturing process validation.  
Comprehensive information has been provided on development, characterisation and validation of the 
manufacturing process.  
Adequate information on API starting materials has been provided 
Several process intermediates are defined. The purity requirement for the peptide before conjugation 
has been adequately justified. 
The characterisation demonstrates that the active substance is a single molecular entity with a high 
level of purity. Process-related impurities are adequately controlled at appropriate stages. The 
determination of the product-related impurities in process and at active substance release is 
exclusively performed with a RP-HPLC procedure while aggregation is only controlled with a SE 
procedure. An orthogonal approach was applied demonstrating that the main peak contains a 
compound having the same Mw and hydrophobicity and no compounds differing in Mw co-elute. 
Furthermore, the RP-HPLC methods provide good separation with closely related 
substances/impurities. The presented data support the selectivity of the RP-HPLC method towards 
impurities. 
It has been assured that solvents and impurities from the chemical modification are well controlled. 
Ozempic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017

Chromatographic procedures and system suitability criteria have been described to ensure that the 
methods consistently detect the impurities. 
The applicant has developed a bioactivity assay, however chose to limit its use in routine testing to 1 
out of 10 batches. This is considered acceptable since it concerns a molecule relatively well controlled 
by physical-chemical analysis and the RP-HPLC content method has shown a good correlation with 
bioactivity assay results. 
The specification for bioactivity and RP-HPLC detectable impurities have been adjusted or appropriately 
justified.  
The presented active substance stability studies support the storage condition and claimed storage 
period.  
Finished product 
The manufacturing process is considered to be appropriate. Detailed process description was provided 
in terms of ranges for process parameters for all process steps. 
Process characterisation/justification studies and PPQ studies generally support the process 
ranges/limits and product intermediate holding times. Information was provided as regards the filter 
validation tests and aseptic validation for specific for the semaglutide finished product.  
The cartridges are siliconised prior to depyrogenation. It is considered that sufficient information is 
provided to assure that the plungers and caps are acceptable in terms of microbial quality. 
The proposed specifications / acceptance criteria have been justified based on knowledge obtained 
during the pharmaceutical development work as well as data obtained from production of clinical 
batches (phase 3, pilot scale) and batches used during late stage development (batch size, 
manufacturing scale).  
The subsequent recalculations performed have resulted in adjustment of the specification limits, with 
due consideration for the safety and efficacy of the semaglutide finished product during the shelf life 
period as well as for the manufacturing capability. In principle, the proposed limits of related impurities 
detected in for semaglutide finished product are supported by the maximum levels detected in clinical 
trial. It is noted that a characterisation study has been conducted to characterise the semaglutide 
related impurities generated during the manufacture and storage of semaglutide finished product.  
Dose accuracy test is performed by weighing and will be carried out as part of the release testing after 
assembly of semaglutide finished product in the PDS290 pen-injector for semaglutide 1.34 mg/ml.  
The proposed shelf-life of 36 months at 5°C ± 3°C for the semaglutide finished product, semaglutide 
1.34 mg/mL solution for injection is properly justified. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall,  the  quality  of  Ozempic  is  considered  to  be  in  line  with  the  quality  of  other  approved 
recombinant  DNA  products.  The  different  aspects  of  the  chemical,  pharmaceutical  and  biological 
documentation  comply  with  existing  guidelines.  The  fermentation  and  purification  of  the  active 
substance  are  adequately  described,  controlled  and  validated.  The  active  substance  is  well 
characterised  with  regard  to  its  physicochemical  and  biological  characteristics,  using  state-of-the-art 
methods, and appropriate specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has 
been  satisfactorily  described  and  validated.  The  quality  of  the  finished  product  is  controlled  by 
adequate test methods and specifications.

2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends a point for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical safety programme was designed in accordance with ICH M3 (R2) and ICH S6 (R1).  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology  
Semaglutide is a long-acting human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, which 
specifically activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Semaglutide is an Aib8, Arg34-GLP-1(7-37) analogue 
substituted with a side chain on the lysine residue in position 26. The side chain consists of two ADO 
(8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid) spacers, one γ-glutamic acid (Glu) spacer, and a fatty diacid (1,18-
octadecanedioic acid). Semaglutide is produced using recombinant DNA technology in yeast 
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and chemical modification. Semaglutide has a 94% structural homology to 
native GLP-1, a molecular weight of 4113,58 g/mol and is good soluble in an aqueous solution. 
Semaglutide is suitable for once-weekly administration in humans.  
The pharmacological mechanism of GLP-1R agonists is well described in the literature, with blood 
glucose lowering and body fat loss mediated by lowered intake of calories. The primary 
pharmacological target tissues for GLP-1R agonists are the pancreas (beta-cells), the gastrointestinal 
system and the brain. The amino acid sequence of GLP-1 is preserved in mammals and only one 
receptor, the GLP-1R, has been identified. Rat and human GLP-1R have 90% homology and monkey 
and human 99%. The GLP-1R is a G-protein coupled receptor and the cellular action of GLP-1 is 
mediated through the G-protein and subsequent activation of adenylate cyclase leading to increased 
cAMP accumulation.  
Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell membranes, stably expressing the human GLP-1 receptor, were used 
to characterize the in vitro pharmacological receptor effect of semaglutide using binding and functional 
studies on the human GLP-1 receptor. The binding affinity of semaglutide to the GLP-1 receptor in the 
membrane preparation, was found to be influenced by albumin concentrations. 
The results of the functional, receptor activating, studies, measuring cAMP production, showed that 
semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist with a potency of 0.15 nM, which is comparable to liraglutide 
and 8-fold less potent than GLP-1 itself.  
In an ex vivo study using rat isolated perfused pancreas, semaglutide stimulated insulin secretion 
dose-dependently. Two pancreas preparations were studied with increasing concentration of 
semaglutide and the EC50 of insulin secretion was estimated to be ~14 nM. 
The primary pharmacodynamic effect was evaluated in a number of animal models.  
Ozempic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017  
Page 20/156 
 
 
 
 
In normal male rats, the in vivo potency was estimated by dosing semaglutide subcutaneously (sc) 
followed by an i.v. glucose infusion 3 hrs later. Semaglutide stimulated plasma insulin secretion and 
lowered blood glucose at a dose of 123 µg/kg (~6 nM plasma exposure) and a trend towards 
stimulation was observed at 41 µg/kg. 
In male diabetic db/db mice, upon single or repeated 4-week sc dosing, semaglutide lowered blood 
glucose dose-dependently and had a long duration of action. The ED 50 for lowering of blood glucose (6 
hours post dosing) was estimated to be 1.2 µg/kg for semaglutide, whereas it was about 20-fold 
higher for liraglutide indicating that semaglutide was more potent in vivo than liraglutide. The maximal 
effect on blood glucose lowering was comparable for semaglutide and liraglutide, and was obtained at 
4 - 8 µg/kg for semaglutide in the 4-week study. The effect on body weight was maximal at a dose of 
21 µg/kg. 
The beta-cell-reduced Göttingen minipig is a model, in which the human conditions of impaired glucose 
tolerance are mimicked, and has more resemblance to humans than rodent models. This model was 
used for evaluation of duration of action of GLP-1R agonists. In a hyperglycaemic clamp study in beta-
cell-reduced minipigs, semaglutide stimulated insulin secretion for up to 7 days after the last dose (8.2 
μg/kg) was administered.  
GLP-1 and its analogues are, among other effects, able to reduce food intake, which is an important 
aspect in the treatment of obesity and diabetes. The subchronic efficacy of semaglutide on body weight 
reduction was evaluated in diet-induced obese (DIO) aged female rats, which were given chocolate in 
addition to normal chow for 9 months. Subcutaneous doses of 1.2 and 4.1 μg/kg once-daily for 77 
days led to a dose-dependent, significant decrease in body weight, primarily from fat. Furthermore, 
semaglutide dose dependently decreased overall food intake, which mainly consisted of chocolate. 
Leptin, total cholesterol and free fatty acids were significantly decreased after treatment with 
semaglutide while plasma glucose, HbA1c, insulin, glucagon and triglycerides were not changed.  
The effects of semaglutide on hypothalamic appetite signals were evaluated in high fat diet obese 
(DIO) mice. Dosing of semaglutide for 18 days (0.15 mg/kg, s.c., daily) significantly lowered body 
weight. This was associated with increased mRNA expression of the satiety peptide cocaine- and 
amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) in hypothalamus. Expression 
levels of the hunger peptides neuropeptide Y (NPY) and Agouti-related peptide (AGRP) in the ARC in 
hypothalamus were not different between semaglutide and vehicle but were lower than in the weight 
matched vehicle group.  
The effect and duration of semaglutide on lowering of food intake were also studied in young, growing 
pigs. Steady state plasma levels of semaglutide were achieved by dosing every other day at 21 μg/kg. 
When steady state had been reached, dosing was stopped and daily food intake was assessed. 
Semaglutide decreased food intake in pigs for at least 2 days after cessation of dosing. The potency of 
semaglutide for decreasing food intake was in magnitude comparable to liraglutide in pigs, but with a 
longer duration of action. 
The access and neuronal interaction of semaglutide in the rodent (SD rat, C57BL mice) brain was 
investigated using peripherally administered fluorescently labelled semaglutide. Semaglutide was 
shown to have access to discrete brain regions expressing the GLP-1R including some of the well-
defined circumventricular organs. Fluorescently labelled semaglutide also gained access to brain 
regions protected by the blood brain barrier (BBB) such as NTS (nucleus tractus solitarus) in the brain 
stem and in hypothalamus, where it was present in CART positive neurons in the ARC. The fluorescent 
signal was lost in the GLP-1R Knock-Out (KO) mouse, suggesting dependence upon binding to the 
GLP-1 receptor. Electrophysiological measurements of mouse brain slices revealed that semaglutide 
Ozempic

(100 nM) directly stimulated Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)/CART neurons and indirectly inhibited 
neural activity in neurons expressing NPY. 
The effect of semaglutide on development of atherosclerosis was investigated in two 
hypercholesterolemic mouse models, the ApoE- and LDL-receptor KO mouse models, at sc doses of 4, 
12 and 60 μg/kg administered once-daily for 13 or 17 weeks, respectively. These models are widely 
used to study plaque formation when on a western diet (WD) consisting of high fat and carbohydrate 
content and 0.2% cholesterol.  
In the LDLr KO mouse model, semaglutide showed a significant, about two-third, reduction of aortic 
plaque area at all three dose levels tested. This effect was accompanied by a significantly reduced 
body weight gain and a reduction in plasma TG levels with the highest dose, while plasma cholesterol 
and cholesterol lipoprotein levels were not changed by semaglutide treatment.  
In the ApoE KO mouse, semaglutide treatment showed a significant attenuation of aortic plaque area 
at all three dose levels tested after 13 week daily treatment. This effect was accompanied by a 
significantly reduced body weight gain with all doses.  
In conclusion, the development of WD-induced aortic plaque lesion areas was attenuated by 
semaglutide in both KO models at all dose levels. The effect was partially independent of reduced body 
weight gain.  
A broad profiling screening panel using 68 biochemical receptors, ion-channels and neurotransmitter 
transporters did not show a competitive interaction with semaglutide. Also, semaglutide, up to 10 µM, 
did not activate the glucagon receptor. No secondary pharmacology effects are expected from 
semaglutide. 
In conclusion, the efficacy pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted in vitro, ex vivo as well as 
in vivo in normal, diabetic and obese rodent models and normal pigs and minipigs. The studies have 
shown that semaglutide has pharmacological properties consistent with a GLP-1R agonist showing 
increases of insulin secretion, plasma glucose lowering and weight lowering due to a reduction of food 
intake. 
The safety pharmacology studies were designed to investigate the effect of semaglutide on major 
organ function (central nervous system, respiratory system and cardiovascular system). Exposure 
measurements in both the rat CNS study and in the cynomolgus monkey cardiovascular study 
exposure of treated animals confirmed exposure of treated animals could correlate effects to the 
exposure. Due to differences in dosing frequency between humans (once weekly) and animals 
(daily/biweekly), the mean maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) at the maximum recommended 
human dose (MRHD) of 1 mg/week has been used for exposure comparison in the safety 
pharmacology section. A value of ~32 nM has been taken as the mean Cmax in humans at MRHD.  
The effect of semaglutide on the central nervous system was studied in the rat CNS (Irwin) study. In 
this study no significant gross behavioural or physiological changes were observed, during the 24 h 
post-dose period in rats receiving subcutaneous treatment with semaglutide. Abnormal gait (walking 
on toes), passivity, decreased touch response, increased urination, lethargy and piloerection were 
observed in animals administered 95 µg/kg semaglutide, which corresponds to 1.5-fold the maximal 
plasma (Cmax) exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). The observed effects are 
considered to be pharmacology related and likely due to the activity at GLP-1 receptors in the CNS. 
The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was determined to be 22 µg/kg. 
Semaglutide, given subcutaneously at doses up to 84 µg/kg, had no statistically significant effects on 
respiratory rate, tidal volume or minute volume up to 24 hours after dosing in male SD rats.

Treatment with semaglutide (>200-fold higher concentration than the mean maximal plasma 
concentration at the MRHD) produced no inhibition of hERG channel tail current recorded in HEK293 
cells stably transfected with hERG cDNA, nor an effect on action potential parameters in isolated 
female rabbit Purkinje fibres. This indicates that semaglutide has a low potential for QT prolongation.  
The acute effect of semaglutide on cardiovascular function was studied in male conscious unrestrained 
cynomolgus monkeys equipped with telemetry transmitters and dosed subcutaneously with ascending 
doses of semaglutide. No effects related to semaglutide were observed on arterial blood pressure 
(systolic, diastolic and mean) or the lead II ECG variables examined (RR, PR, QR, QTcF and QTcQ 
intervals or QRS duration). In conclusion, it was found that there were no clinically relevant findings in 
cynomolgus monkeys in single doses up to 470 µg/kg (about 14-fold above MRHD based on Cmax).  
In addition, in the repeat dose toxicology study at week 13, 26 and 52, the cardiac electrophysiology 
was monitored by ECG in male and female telemetered cynomolgus monkeys (10, 60 and 360 µg/kg 
twice-weekly sc). In this 52-week toxicity monkey study, a left-bundle-branch-block was observed in 
one female animal at high dose of 360 µg/kg (~27-fold above MRHD). The animal exhibited no clinical 
signs attributable to the ECG finding and histopathology revealed no correlating changes. Cardiac 
bundle-branch blocks are an occasional finding in monkeys and humans, and are in most cases a 
consequence of other underlying cardiac diseases. Although histopathology revealed no changes in the 
heart, the ECG finding was considered adverse. When heart rate was analysed as change from 
baseline, it was shown that there seems to be a transient increase in heart rate at week 26 which 
returns to baseline values at week 52 in males but remains elevated at week 52 in high dose females. 
This finding supports the increase in heart rate seen in patients in the clinical trials. 
A renal function study was performed to evaluate the acute effects of semaglutide on the renal system 
in the rat. Semaglutide caused an acute transient increase in diuresis during the first 8 hours after 
dosing at the highest doses (23 and 89 µg/kg) and a decrease in the diuresis parameters thereafter. 
These observations are well known effects of GLP-1R agonists in the rat. Acute effects on diuresis have 
also been shown in humans with native GLP-1, but not following chronic administration of GLP-1R 
agonists. The NOAEL was determined to be 5 µg/kg. 
Nonclinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have not been conducted with semaglutide, 
which is agreed upon. GLP-1R agonists have been reported to delay gastric emptying but this was 
evaluated in clinical trials. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
The methods developed for analysis of semaglutide in plasma with LC-MS/MS (mouse, rat, monkey) 
and ELISA (mouse, rabbit, monkey) were sufficiently validated with satisfactory assay performance. 
The LOCI assay was affected by interference from the plasma matrix and dilution linearity issues with a 
larger impact on low concentrations leading to underestimation of semaglutide exposures (rat, rabbit, 
monkey). For this reason, the plasma assay in rat and monkey was replaced by LC-MS/MS and ELISA. 
In the rabbit embryo-foetal development study (207360), measured concentration were below 200 nM, 
where Hook effect occurred and the values for dose-normalized average concentrations (Cavg) did not 
deviate from the other tests.

The methods developed for the detection anti-semaglutide antibodies (radioimmunoassay) and 
neutralizing antibodies (BHK cell based neutralising assay) measuring cAMP) in serum (mouse, rat, 
monkey) has been were sufficiently validated with satisfactory assay performance. 
Single dose absorption and plasma pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional and there was no gender dependency. The absorption of 
Semaglutide from the subcutaneous injection site was rapid in mouse and rat, but slower in rabbit, 
monkey and minipig. The time to maximum concentration (tmax) was 2 to 3 hours in mouse and rat, 
and about 24 hours in rabbit, monkey and minipig. The bioavailability ranged from 86% (monkey) to 
94% (minipig). In human, the bioavailability was equally high (89%), but the absorption was slower 
(tmax 60 h). 
The mean dose-normalized concentration was similar in monkey and human, while it was lower in 
mouse, rabbit and rat due to faster clearance. The terminal half-life was estimated to be 8 h in the 
mouse, 11 hr in the rat, 28 h in the rabbit, 51 h in the monkey and 148 h in human.  
The distribution volume was low (0.2 L/kg) following i.v. administration in the monkey, which 
corresponds approximately to the volume of extracellular water and indicates that a high fraction of 
semaglutide is circulating in plasma and extracellular fluid. 
Comparison of single dose pharmacokinetics in monkey after subcutaneous and intravenous dosing 
indicated that elimination is not limited by the absorption rate from subcutis. 
Toxicokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics following repeated dosing of subcutaneous semaglutide showed a linear 
relationship between doses and exposures. No gender differences were noted. The dose normalised 
exposure was generally lower for mice, rats, rabbits and minipigs compared to monkeys and humans 
due to faster clearance. To ensure continued exposure, and to mimic the once-weekly exposure profile 
in humans, once-daily dosing was used in mice and rats, and twice-weekly dosing was used in 
monkeys. At these dose intervals, there was no apparent (i.e. < 2-fold) systemic accumulation  
No difference in exposure was observed between pregnant and non-pregnant animals following 
repeated administration of semaglutide to rats, rabbits and monkeys. However, rabbits showed some 
accumulation in the embryofoetal development study, but the wide range (1.3 up to 13-fold) and the 
few data do not permit a clear conclusion. 
Plasma protein binding 
In-vitro binding studies showed that the plasma protein binding was high, >99%, and that albumin 
was the primary protein responsible for binding of semaglutide in plasma. The potential binding to 
other plasma proteins has not been studied. The fraction unbound was somewhat lower in plasma from 
mouse, rat and rabbit (0.07-0.28%) as compared to plasma from monkey (0.46%) and human 
(0.36%). 
Distribution to red blood cells 
As determined in rats, whole blood concentrations of semaglutide-related material were approximately 
half of the values in plasma, suggesting no preferential uptake into red cells.

Tissue distribution 
Distribution studies in rats showed the highest presence of semaglutide-related material in blood and 
in highly perfused tissues. 
After subcutaneous administration of [3H]-Oct- or [3H]-Tyr-labelled semaglutide, the tissue-to-blood 
ratios of semaglutide related material were generally below 1. The highest levels were associated with 
lung, tooth pulp, kidney (cortex and medulla), bladder, adrenal medulla and uterus. The high levels in 
the bile ducts, up to and including 3 days after dosing, suggests that biliary secretion may have played 
an important role in elimination by contributing to faecal excretion. In addition, the moderate levels of 
radioactivity present in the kidneys and bladder also suggest that urinary elimination occurred. The 
lowest concentrations were present in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and white 
fat. 
The distribution and concentrations of [3H]-Oct-semaglutide related material in male pigmented rats 
were similar to that in male albino rats, suggesting that semaglutide related material does not bind to 
melanin or accumulate in pigmented tissues. 
Metabolism 
The in-vitro metabolism of radiolabelled semaglutide was studied in hepatocytes from rats, monkeys 
and humans. Limited metabolism was observed in all species, and no unique human metabolites were 
formed. It was shown that semaglutide is metabolised by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone 
by neutral endopeptidase (neprilysin) and sequential beta-oxidation of the fatty acid side chain.  
The in-vivo metabolism of semaglutide was investigated by chromatographic metabolite profiling of 
plasma, urine and faeces from rat, monkey and human following administration of radiolabelled 
semaglutide. The metabolite profiles from plasma were similar across species. The peptide backbone of 
semaglutide was metabolised by proteolytic degradation, and the fatty acid moiety was degraded by 
sequential beta-oxidation. 
Semaglutide was the most abundant component in plasma across animal species, accounting for 69-
93% of the total amount of semaglutide related material and 4 to 12 metabolites which constituted in 
total only a small part in relation to the amount unchanged semaglutide.  
In human plasma, there were 6 metabolites, each contributing 0.4-7.7% to the total amount of 
semaglutide-related material, whereas the contribution of unchanged semaglutide was 83%. The 
largest metabolite (P3) contained at least three components (P3A, P3B and P3C). P3C was 
characterised as a semaglutide isomer. P3B was identified as a peptide metabolite from semaglutide, 
following proteolytic cleavage and the loss of the first 13 amino acids. Neprilysin was capable of 
forming the metabolite P3B in vitro. No further structural information could be provided P3A and P3C, 
due to the limited amounts in plasma. All human metabolites are also present in rats, and P3, P5 and 
P7 are also present in monkeys.  
The two primary metabolites in human (U6 and U7) were identified as the free Lys26 amino acid bound 
to the ADO-linker with butyric (C4) or hexanoic (C6) di-acid side chains attached. These metabolites 
are products formed from full proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone with sequential removal of 
C2-units by beta-oxidation of the di-fatty acid side chain. The urine metabolite U22 was identified as 
semaglutide. Only limited amounts of unchanged semaglutide were observed in urine of animals (1%) 
and humans (3%). 
Ozempic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017  
Page 25/156 
 
 
 
 
The pharmacological activity of the metabolites has not been evaluated. These metabolites, such as 
P3B and P3C, may be pharmacologically active since they have structural similarities with semaglutide. 
The possible contribution of these metabolites to the pharmacological activity of the final product will 
be minor, because in plasma they are only a small part in relation to the amount of unchanged 
semaglutide (< 7.7%).  
Excretion 
Semaglutide was extensively metabolised prior to elimination. In human, unchanged semaglutide were 
observed in small amounts in human urine (3.1%), but was not detected in faeces. In rat and monkey, 
both urine and faeces were equally important as excretion routes of semaglutide and related material. 
The contribution of urinary excretion was 37% in rats and 30% in monkey, whereas the contribution of 
faecal excretion were 35% and 21% in these species, respectively. In human, the urinary excretion 
was the predominant route of excretion (53%), followed by faeces (18.6%). 
In bile-cannulated rats, bile was primary route for excretion of semaglutide-related material into faeces 
(48%), of which approximately 14% was unchanged semaglutide. Other components in bile were 
metabolites, each accounting for less than 5% of the administered dose.  
Placenta transfer 
Semaglutide related material passed the placental barrier in rats and rabbits, but distributed to foetal 
tissue at levels lower than in dam plasma (<4%). This suggests limited distribution across placenta. 
Nevertheless, a single dose of semaglutide to pregnant rats at GD18, led to low, but measurable levels 
in foetuses at 24h post dose and effects on the foetus were observed. 
Excretion into milk 
Semaglutide and metabolites are excreted into rat milk. Mean concentrations were 3-12 times lower 
than in plasma up to 24 hours after a subcutaneous dose 0.3 mg/kg/day semaglutide. There are no 
data on the excretion of semaglutide in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. Semaglutide should not be used during breastfeeding. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The results of the in-vitro and in-vivo studies on the drug interaction potential of semaglutide have 
been evaluated in the clinical assessment report. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A single dose up to 12mg/kg (mouse) or 7.532 mg/kg (rat) was generally well tolerated. Observed 
major findings such as reduced body weight and food intake showed quick recovery and can be related 
to the pharmacological action of semaglutide. 
Repeated dose studies in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys revealed mainly effects related to the 
pharmacological action of semaglutide. Reduction in food intake and body weight gain were dose 
limiting, as exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in monkeys led to dehydration consequently 
followed by euthanization. However, dose escalation improves tolerability.

Hypertrophy of Brunner’s glands of the duodenum was observed in rats after 26 weeks of treatment. 
This effect is likely due to the high expression of GLP-1R on Brunner’s glands. However, there was no 
progression to hyper- or neoplasia in the rodent carcinogenicity studies, and no similar observations in 
cynomolgus monkeys dosed for 52 weeks. Therefore, this observation is not considered a safety 
concern in humans. Thyroid C-cell hyperplasia was only observed in mice at all dose levels. This is an 
expected result also seen with other GLP-1 agonists and can be considered a class effect.  
The 52-week monkey study revealed a chronic left bundle-branch-block in one high dose female. 
Although the abnormal ECG was confined to a single animal, the observation was considered adverse.  
An increase in uterus fluid distension and luminal dilatation is seen in rats after 26 weeks of dosing. 
These findings are likely due to differences in the stage of the sexual cycle which could be treatment 
related, and likely secondary to reduction in body weight. Daily subcutaneous administration to 
Sprague-Dawley rats over a treatment period of 13 weeks with 0.48 mg/kg/day and 0.45 mg/kg/day 
semaglutide respectively, demonstrated generally similar observations between two formulations 
based on two different manufacturing processes and although there were a few minor differences, 
none was considered of any toxicological significance. 
Semaglutide is not genotoxic in vitro or in vivo. 
In carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, thyroid C-cell adenomas and carcinomas were observed at 
all dose levels. This is an expected result also seen with other GLP-1 agonists and can be considered a 
class effect. No other tumours were found. Other non-neoplastic effects were secondary to the 
decreased body weight gain related to the pharmacological action of semaglutide. To determine 
whether the thyroid C-cell tumours are indeed caused by the same mechanism as is responsible for C-
cell tumours observed after treatment with GLP-1 agonists, the applicant performed some mechanistic 
studies. The activation of the GLP-1R was tested in vitro on a thyroid C-cell tumour cell line and 
compared to GLP-1, exenatide and liraglutide. It was shown that the potency of semaglutide to 
activate the receptor was similar to liraglutide, and less potent than GLP-1 and exenatide.  
Increased plasma calcitonin concentration is considered a marker for increased activation of GLP-1R on 
the thyroid C-cells. Upon chronic activation this leads to up-regulation of calcitonin synthesis and 
further to C-cell proliferation and tumour formation. Therefore, the applicant performed in vivo studies 
in mice and rats, which show that even after a single 1 mg/kg dose of semaglutide in mice, plasma 
calcitonin levels were increased 12 and 24 hours after injection. In rats however, an increase calcitonin 
level was not seen in females, and not very convincingly in males after 6 weeks of treatment. This 
could be due to the very short half-life of calcitonin in rats of 4 minutes, or a delayed effect which is 
still not apparent after 6 weeks. Further, an inconsistent effect on calcitonin levels in rats was also 
seen for liraglutide. Overall, the mechanism of formation of rodent thyroid C-cell tumours is well known 
and discussed in the public literature. There is no reason to suggest a different mechanism might be 
responsible for the C-cell tumours observed after treatment with semaglutide, and therefore the 
thyroid C-cell tumours are likely rodent specific. Since relevance for humans cannot be completely 
ruled out, thyroid C-cell tumours are listed in the RMP as potential risk. 
In the main rat study which combined fertility and embryo-foetal development, there was no effect on 
male fertility. There was an increased number of females with irregular oestrus cycles, but this did not 
result in a reduced fertility index. From the mid-dose onward however, there was a reduced number of 
corpora lutea with reduced implantations and litter size at the high dose. As there was evidence of 
maternal toxicity at all doses, it is not clear whether these effects are related to treatment or 
secondary to reduced maternal body weight gain.

Semaglutide caused embryotoxicity in the rat. The observed effects included embryo-foetal mortality, 
growth retardation, and skeletal and visceral abnormalities. The effects were observed at dose levels of 
0.03 mg/kg/day and above, with AUC exposures below the clinical exposure at the MRHD of 1 
mg/week. The applicant describes a mechanism of action for the embryotoxic effects observed in the 
rat reproduction study, which involves the presence of GLP-1R on the yolk sac. Semaglutide binds to 
the receptors on the yolk sac, leading to inhibition of transport of nutrients across the membrane. This 
mechanism is likely rat specific, since rat embryos are dependent on the yolk sac for their nutrient 
supply which is e.g. less important in other species including humans and monkeys. Moreover, GLP-1R 
is not expressed on monkey yolk sacs.  
It is agreed that the mechanism demonstrated is specific for rats, and could explain the malformations 
seen in the rat foetuses. Although undoubtedly this mechanism is responsible for most of the 
malformations observed, it cannot be excluded that other mechanisms that may not be rat specific are 
also involved. This is based on the fact that not only more and other malformations are present, but 
also foetal weight is much further reduced in embryos of dams treated up to GD17 as compared to 
GD13. This is after the period (GD12) in which embryos are solely dependent on the yolk sac for 
nutrition, but also rely on the developing chorioallantoic placenta. Although the additional skeletal 
abnormalities that occur between GD13 and GD17 could still be due to the impaired yolk sac, due to 
presence of the GLP-1R on the rat embryo from GD13.5 and presence of low levels of semaglutide in 
the foetus as measured on GD20, a direct effect of semaglutide on the foetus, of which the clinical 
relevance is unknown, cannot be excluded. It appears that a potential direct effect of semaglutide is 
only relevant in the later stages of pregnancy in rats, since the receptor is not present before GD13.5. 
Timing of receptor expression, if this is relevant for humans at all, is unknown, but a potential risk for 
humans is mitigated through the labelling in SmPC section 4.6, where it is stated that semaglutide 
should not be used during pregnancy and women of childbearing potential should use contraception to 
avoid unplanned pregnancies. Any further risk mitigation measures are not warranted. 
A second embryo-foetal toxicity study was performed in rabbits. Once-daily SC administration of 
semaglutide to pregnant New Zealand White rabbits markedly reduced maternal body weight and food 
consumption. This coincided with increased post-implantation losses, incomplete ossification of foetal 
metacarpals/phalanges, and increased incidences of minor skeletal and visceral foetal abnormalities. 
The increased post-implantation losses and the foetal pathology findings were possibly secondary to 
the marked maternal effects, but a direct effect of semaglutide could not be excluded. On the other 
hand, marked maternal toxicity could also mask a direct effect on the embryo or foetus. Although 
exposure in the high dose group at GD19 was above the human exposure, it was below human 
exposure at GD6. The Applicant attributes the observations in the rabbit as described above, primarily 
to the maternal effects on body weight and food consumption. Delayed ossification observed without 
concomitant decreases in foetal body weight may warrant increased attention (Carney and Kimmel 
2007). However, as the mid and high-dose dams showed lower body weight gains on GD 6-19, and 
higher than control body weight gains on GD 20-29, any decreased foetal body weights in the mid and 
high dose groups may have been recovered at termination of the study when the foetal examinations 
were performed. 
Cynomolgus monkeys were used as a third species for embryo-toxicity testing of semaglutide, since 
monkeys do not rely on a yolk sac for nutrition. In all dose groups, the pregnant females had an initial 
loss of body weight, and a lower body weight gain as compared to control animals. There were 2 cases 
of abortion in all dose groups as compared to 1 in the control group. The incidence of 2 out of 16 
(12.5%) is close to the incidence of pregnancy loss in cynomolgus monkey controls reported in 
literature of 11.5% up to GD75 (Jarvis et al, Birth Defects Research (Part B) 89:175–187 (2010)).

Further, two major malformations were reported in the study. In the mid-dose group a single foetus 
had a fused kidney, and in the high dose group there was one foetus with a misshapen brain. These 
effects have not previously been reported in historical controls from the same testing site. However, a 
relevance for humans is unlikely due to the lack of a mechanistic relation to semaglutide and lack of 
similar findings in other studies. Moreover, any potential risk is mitigated through the labelling in 
SmPC section 4.6. 
There was no effect on postnatal development in offspring of cynomolgous monkeys treated with 
semaglutide until GD140. Initial maternal body weight losses likely led to an increased incidence of 
early pregnancy loss and reduced foetal weight in the mid and high dose. No other effects were 
observed. 
A juvenile study was performed where rats from the age of 21 days were dosed for 11 weeks. Apart 
from general signs of toxicity, sexual maturation and fertility were investigated. Sexual maturation was 
delayed for both sexes, but this did not coincide effects on fertility or mating performance. No 
histopathological findings were noted, and therefore it is considered likely that the delay is due to the 
decreased body weight gain of the treated animals. No new findings were seen in these juvenile 
animals that were not seen in the adult animals. This study is of limited relevance in the current 
procedure, as the indication applied for is in adults only. 
In a local toxicity study in pigs using the subcutaneous route of administration only mild effects related 
to the vehicle or injection procedure were seen. Further, in all pivotal toxicity studies the subcutaneous 
route of administration was applied, and therefore local toxicity is considered sufficiently investigated 
and no concerns for human safety were identified. 
In clinical practise it is possible that the product will be administered by intravenous, intra-arterial or 
intramuscular routes by mistake. Therefore, possible adverse effects were investigated in rabbits using 
these routes of administration. No adverse effects were seen other than mild effects related to the 
vehicle or injection procedure. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The active substance is a peptide. Therefore, semaglutide is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant has shown that semaglutide is effective in lowering blood glucose levels in diabetic 
animal models, as well as modulating satiety and giving rise to decreased food intake and have a body 
weight lowering effect. Furthermore, the duration of these effects are markedly longer than the once 
daily liraglutide. The Applicant has also shown that semaglutide has some effects on preventing 
atherosclerotic plaque formation in two knock-out mice models, and the positive effects of GLP-1R 
agonists in this aspect is further supported by literature. Standardised safety pharmacology studies did 
not reveal any cardiac safety signals following SC administration of semaglutide, however, in the 52 
week toxicity study in cynomolgus monkey, one female animal in high dose group, developed left-
bundle-branch-block, which might be related to treatment. When heart rate was analysed as change 
from baseline, it was shown that there seems to be a transient increase in heart rate at week 26 which 
returns to baseline values at week 52 in males but remains elevated at week 52 in high dose females. 
This finding supports the increase in heart rate seen in patients in the clinical trials.

Semaglutide showed linear relationship between dose and exposure without a gender dependency for 
all species used, where dose normalised exposure was slightly lower for rodents compared to minipigs 
and cynomolgus monkey and human. The Tmax increased from 2 - 3 hours in the rodents to 24 hours in 
rabbit and cynomolgus monkey, and 60 hours in human. Half-life increased from 7.6 hours in the 
mouse, to 51 hours in cynomolgus monkey and 148 hours in human. The bioavailability following s.c. 
administration was 86%, 94% and 89% for cynomolgus monkey, minipig and human respectively. 
Plasma protein binding was found to be very high (>99%) in all species. Anti semaglutide antibody 
development was scarce in the nonclinical species.  
The general toxicology studies showed findings expected from at GLP-1RA, with regards to single, 
repeat dose and carcinogenicity studies. However, with regards to the reproductive studies in rats and 
rabbits, both species were more sensitive than expected, where abnormalities gave rise to NOAELs 
resulting in lower than MHRD exposure levels. Additional studies were performed in the cynomolgus 
monkey, where a few observed abnormalities as well as early embryofoetal loss in high and mid dose 
levels also gave rise to NOAEL at the low dose level, and less than MHRD exposure levels. These 
changes were observed in concordance with body weight loss in the maternal animals. Mechanistic 
studies showing that GLP-1R in the yolk sack of rats were important in the energy uptake in early 
embryonic phase, and may in part be the explanation for the observed abnormalities and embryo loss 
in rats. No such GLP-1R was detected in cynomolgus monkey yolk sack, and the yolk sack does 
develop into a yolk sack placenta in primates as it does in the rat. However, despite the effort made to 
determine whether the observed reproductive effects were caused by rodent specific mechanisms, it is 
not possible to exclude that the observed effects may be related to treatment with semaglutide. This is 
reflected in the SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3, and WOCP is advised to use effective contraception, and 
cease with semaglutide treatment prior to planned pregnancy as well as during pregnancy and 
lactation. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology programs are considered 
sufficient. There are no major objections from a non-clinical point of view.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.4.2.1.  Methodology 
Two different types of validated assays were used to measure total semaglutide plasma 
concentrations. In the early clinical development (studies 1820, 1821, 3633 and 3679), semaglutide in 
plasma was analysed using a luminescent oxygen channelling immunoassay (LOCI assay). Later in the 
clinical development, the assay was changed to LC-MS/MS assay as it was found that measurements 
with the LOCI assay were influenced by a matrix effect. Considerably higher and less variable 
semaglutide concentrations were measured with LC-MS/MS compared to LOCI method. For the 
analysis of semaglutide in urine an appropriately validated LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method has been 
used. 
The multi-tiered approach has been used to assess the anti-semaglutide and neutralizing antibodies. In 
general, the assay validation was adequately performed. The employed four-tiered strategy including a 
screening, confirmatory, cross reactivity to endogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 
neutralization assay is in agreement with the draft Guideline on Immunogenicity assessment of 
biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev. 1). 
The plasma concentration-time data for semaglutide were analysed by non-compartmental methods 
and standard pharmacokinetic parameters have been calculated. Descriptive statistics of PK variables 
and power calculations have been provided for all PK/PD studies. In general, the pharmacokinetic 
endpoints were analysed and compared between treatments using linear normal models (ANCOVA) 
with the log-transformed endpoint as the dependent variable. Fixed and random factors were taken 
into account as independent variables. The software used to calculate and compare the 
pharmacokinetic parameters in the clinical trials was Kinetica or SAS release 9 or higher on a UNIX 
platform. 
The applicant used a population pharmacokinetic model and several exposure-response analyses to 
investigate to what extent exposure of semaglutide is impacted by covariates, what the characteristics 
are of the exposure-response relationships for efficacy and safety and if the recommended dose is 
supported by these analyses. The influence of the covariates sex, age group, race, ethnicity, body 
weight, renal function, maintenance dose level and injection site have been evaluated in the population 
PK analysis. Exposure vs time since first dose and effects of antibody status on semaglutide exposure 
were evaluated graphically. 
The population PK analysis was based on data from five phase 3a trials; 3623, 3626, 3624, 3744 and 
4091. Maintenance doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg semaglutide were investigated in all trials, except in trial 
3624 where only the 1.0 mg dose was investigated. A one-compartment model with first-order 
absorption and elimination was used to describe the PK of semaglutide. ka (fixed), CL/F and V/F were 
the parameters used in the structural model. The semaglutide absorption rate constant (ka) was set to 
a value of 0.0286 h-1 obtained from a PK model based on full PK profiles from clinical pharmacology 
trials in normoglycaemic and T2D subjects (reported in responses to D120 questions). The assumption 
that ka can be fixed without affecting the conclusions of the analysis, was verified by the applicant 
using a sensitivity analysis. The model was estimated on un-transformed concentration values and a 
proportional error model was used to describe the residual variability. Models were estimated using 
first order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCE+I). 
The exposure−response analysis was conducted using four of the above trials (3623, 3626, 3624, and 
4091) and thus excluding the cardiovascular outcome trial (3744). The exposure-response analysis 
was visualised by plotting the median semaglutide concentration (Cavg) versus the response by 
Ozempic

presenting the mean and 95% CI of the response. Exposure estimates for the analysis were obtained 
from the full population PK model. The following PD parameters were plotted vs exposure as response 
measure: HbA1c change from baseline Responder analysis for HbA1c, Body weight change from 
baseline, pulse weight change from baseline, Calcitonin response, and Gastrointestinal adverse events 
(GIAEs). 
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics of semaglutide 
The PK of semaglutide has been investigated in Japanese and Caucasian healthy subjects, in obese 
subjects and patients with T2 diabetes using single-dose studies, in repeat-dose studies; in subjects 
with renal and hepatic impairment and DDI studies with atorvastatin, digoxin, warfarin, metformin and 
oral contraceptives. 
Semaglutide is a human GLP-1 analogue with a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for once weekly (OW) 
subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. 
Compared to human native GLP-1, the semaglutide molecule has three minor but important 
modifications which make it suitable for once weekly use (Figure 1). These modifications mediate 
strong binding to albumin thereby reducing renal clearance and making semaglutide less susceptible to 
degradation by DPP-4. Furthermore, slow absorption from the subcutis also contributes to the 
prolonged exposure characteristics. 
Absorption 
In the submitted studies it is shown that absorption of semaglutide after subcutaneous injection is slow 
and Tmax is reached between 24-36 hours post dosing. The slow absorption from the subcutaneous 
compartment to the systemic circulation is clearly attributing to the prolonged exposure to 
semaglutide. The absolute bioavailability was estimated to be 89% after abdominal SC administration 
(study 3687). After a single dose of semaglutide S.C. the systemic concentrations were maintained at 
the same level for about 7 days. Steady state concentrations were achieved after 4-5 weeks. 
Fluctuation between Cmax ss and Cthrough was small. 
Figure 1 presents a typical concentration-time profile after a 1.0 mg dose of semaglutide administered 
at steady state in patients with T2D.

The differences between injection sites using the thigh or abdomen has been evaluated in studies 
3652 and 3684 using steady-state concentrations. This analysis showed similar steady state Cmax 
concentrations for the two injection sites. Furthermore the applicant evaluated the differences between 
injection sites on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide using population PK methods which show that 
injection site does not affect average exposure (Cavg). The Cavg of upper arm vs abdomen is 0.93 
[0.90-0.96]90%CI and Cavg of thigh vs abdomen is 0.97 [0.93-1.00]90%CI. The number of subjects 
per injection site is: thigh (n=86), upper arm (n=71) and abdominal skin (n=1454).  
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution following s.c. administration of semaglutide was approximately 12-
13 L (Studies 3635, 3684, 3819) and similar (when accounting for differences in BMI) between 
subjects with T2D and healthy subjects. This volume is small and close to the blood volume, indicating 
that a high fraction of semaglutide is circulating in the blood. The in vitro protein binding, mainly to 
albumin, was above 99% in human plasma. The unbound fraction was 0.19% and 0.36% in human 
samples of healthy volunteers (in vitro studies 208380 en 213228). The high protein binding prevents 
semaglutide from being rapidly eliminated from the circulation. Semaglutide passes the placental 
barrier, blood-brain barrier and is secreted in breast milk, see preclinical section.  
Elimination 
The cumulative recovery of total radioactivity was 75% of the administered dose; hereof 53.0% in 
urine, 18.6% in faeces and 3.2% in expired air. In urine unchanged semaglutide accounted for 3.1% of 
the administered dose (Study 3789). Mean CL/F was approximately 0.05 L/h in patients with T2D as 
compared to about 0.035 L/h in healthy subjects. This difference is largely attributable to differences in 
BMI. Mean t½ was approximately 155 hours (149 to 165 hours) in subjects with T2D and comparable 
to that in healthy volunteers. Semaglutide is metabolized by proteolytic degradation of the peptide 
backbone and beta-oxidation of the fatty acid side-chain. Semaglutide is extensively metabolised into 
many different metabolites. Its most abundant metabolites were P3 that was detected in plasma and 
U6 and U7 that were detected in urine (study 214379). Semaglutide is almost completely metabolised 
and degraded into peptides, amino acids and fatty acid fragments. All metabolites accounted for less 
than 10% of the total amount of semaglutide related material and are not expected to have any 
activity. One semaglutide isomer (P3C) has been identified and although it is considered likely that it 
has some activity it is not expected to be of clinical relevance as its concentration is low (<7.7%).  
Because endogenous GLP-1 is metabolised by DPP-IV and NEP, these enzymes are expected to be 
involved in the metabolism of the structurally related semaglutide. This is confirmed for NEP, which 
was identified as one of the active metabolic enzymes (in vitro study 215514). The pharmacokinetics 
data do not indicate any influence of polymorphisms of NEP on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide. 
The effects are therefore expected unlikely or minor. The applicant has demonstrated in vitro (data on 
file) that semaglutide was less sensitive to DPP-IV degradation than the endogenous GLP. Therefore 
DPP-IV degradation is not expected to be a major pathway and genetic polymorphisms of DPP-IV are 
expected to be negligible.  
Dose proportionality 
Dose proportionality of semaglutide has been investigated in study 3652. Based on the results of this 
study it can be concluded that Semaglutide steady state exposure (AUC0-168h, AUC0-48h and Cmax) 
increased approximately proportionally with semaglutide dose, at doses of 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg 
and 1.5 mg dose levels (estimated doubling constants of 2.01 [1.99; 2.04] 95% CI and 2.00 [1.97; 
Ozempic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017  
Page 35/156 
 
 
 
 
2.03]95% CI, respectively). The company also investigated dose proportionality in early study 1820. 
The results of this study are in line with results of study 3652 but cannot be directly compared to other 
studies as the LOCI assay has been used. 
Time dependency 
Semaglutide steady state exposure is stable over time. Accumulation ratios of approximately 2 were 
calculated for Japanese subjects and approximately 2.3 for Caucasian subjects (study 3634). 
Variability 
Within- and between subject variability in PK in healthy volunteers was low (within-subject variability: 
5–10%, between-subject variability: 17-24%) at after single dose administration (study 4010) and at 
state (study 3652). For subjects with T2D, within- and between subject was evaluated in the 
population PK analysis and was estimated to be 13% and 27% respectively. According to the 
applicant, 75.8% of the variability was explained by the covariates, this conclusion is not supported 
(see Discussion on clinical pharmacology). 
Different formulations  
During the development programme the manufacturing process and the drug product strength varied. 
The semaglutide product used in all phase 3a trials and the majority of phase 1 and 2 trials is the 
same as the intended product to be marketed. The manufacturing process of semaglutide was changed 
between phase 2 and phase 3a, for which bioequivalence was appropriately demonstrated in trial 
4010. 
The concentration of the to- be- marketed product is 1.34 mg/mL and this product has been used for 
the majority of the clinical trials, including the pivotal phase 3a trials. To bridge between all four 
strengths used in the clinical development programme, equivalence between the product strengths (1 
mg/mL, 3 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL) were tested in studies 3679 and 3687. The 1 mg/mL and 3 mg/mL 
formulations were bioequivalent with respect to AUC and Cmax. Therefore is the data generated with 1 
mg/mL and 3 mg/mL formulations also represent the to-be marketed 1.34 mg/mL formulation. 
Equivalence between the 10 mg/mL product strength versus 1 mg/mL and 3 mg/mL, respectively, was 
shown for overall exposure (AUC), but not for Cmax and also t max differed. 
2.4.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Steady state PK properties for semaglutide 1.0 mg in subjects with T2D were consistent across trials 
the mean AUC0−168h was approximately 4700 nmol·h/L (mean range: 4602 to 4811 nmol·h/L) 
corresponding to an average concentration (AUC0−168h/168h) of 28 nmol/L. Mean Cmax was 
approximately 33 nmol/L (mean range: 32.2 to 33.8 nmol/L) and median t max was 36 to 60 hours. The 
observed range (min−max) for t max was broad as a result of the relatively flat plasma concentration 
profiles. 
In the population PK study similar levels were observed. In patients with T2D, the mean steady state 
concentrations following s.c. administration of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg semaglutide were approximately 16 
nmol/L and 30 nmol/L, respectively. 
In the target T2D population, estimated steady-state volume of distribution of semaglutide is about 
12L compared to about 8L in healthy volunteers. Clearance in subjects with T2D is higher in the target 
population. Mean CL/F was approximately 0.05 L/h compared to about 0.035 L/h in healthy subjects. 
Ozempic 
Assessment report

Mean t ½ was around 155 hours (149 to 165 hours) in subjects with T2D and comparable to that in 
healthy volunteers. 
2.4.2.4.  Special Populations 
Special population trials were performed in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment (studies 3616 
and 3651) and the influence of race has been evaluated in studies (3633 and 3634). In these studies 
the PK and PD of Japanese subjects has been characterised and compared with Caucasian subjects. 
The influence of other covariates (body weight, sex, age, race, etc.) has been evaluated using a 
population PK analysis approach as mentioned in 3.3.1.1. 
The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide was comparable between subjects with a normal renal function 
and patients with various degrees of impaired renal function, categorised based on creatinine clearance 
estimated by the Cockcroft & Gault formula (mild, moderate, severe and end-stage renal disease). In 
patients with ESRD the exposure appeared to be lower, however after adjustment for differences in 
age, sex and body weight the exposure was comparable. Also, no major effect was observed in the 
population PK analysis. 
The hepatic impairment study has shown that the total exposure of semaglutide and its cmax is 
comparable between subjects mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment (all with a diagnosis of 
cirrhosis and classified as Child-Pugh A,B, or C) to healthy matched controls. The fraction unbound of 
semaglutide was less than 0.5% for all subjects, but appeared to increase with increasing degree of 
hepatic impairment. As exposure and half-life were unchanged, hepatic impairment is not expected to 
change the efficacy.  
The steady state PK properties of semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg were comparable between healthy 
Japanese and Caucasian subjects. 
The effect of body weight on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide was investigated in the population 
PK analysis. The population PK analysis showed that exposure of semaglutide was inversely correlated 
to body weight (Figure 2  while none of the other covariates seemed to affect the semaglutide 
pharmacokinetics (Figure 3 ).

Figure 3 Effect of covariates on exposure. 
2.4.2.5.  Interactions 
Little or no change in enzyme activity or on the mRNA levels of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 were 
observed. No direct or time/metabolism-dependent inhibition of semaglutide on the clinically relevant 
cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 was 
observed. These in vitro drug-drug interaction studies suggest that semaglutide has a very low 
potential to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes. 
No inhibition was observed of the efflux P-gP and BCRP, nor of the uptake OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2 
transporters. Partial inhibition of the OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporters was observed, with IC50 
values of 3500 and 2950 nmol/L, respectively.  
Furthermore, although semaglutide is strongly bound to plasma albumin the therapeutic plasma 
concentrations following semaglutide dosing is very low compared to that of albumin and it is 
considered unlikely that semaglutide will alter the protein binding of other drugs.

In study 1821 a delay in gastric emptying has been observed with semaglutide. The rates of gastric 
emptying have been assessed by paracetamol pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of paracetamol 
(AUC0-60min and Cmax) was affected by concomitant use of Semaglutide at the 0.2-1.6mg dose levels 
and apparently this effect is dose dependent. The total paracetamol exposure AUC0-240min (within the 4-
hour duration of the meal) was not affected (see Gastric emptying). 
Three separate drug-drug interaction studies (3817, 3818, 3819) were performed to estimate the 
influence of delayed gastric emptying by semaglutide on metformin, warfarin, digoxin, atorvastatin and 
oral contraceptive combination therapy of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. These drugs represent 
drugs that are commonly co-prescribed in patients with T2D and represent different properties with 
respect to solubility and permeability (different BCS classes) and therapeutic windows. 
The results of these DDI studies are summarised in Figure 4. A lower Cmax was observed for 
atorvastatin when co-administered with semaglutide but its overall exposure (AUC) has not been 
affected. The other investigated medication was not affected by concomitantly administered drugs. It 
was noted that the t max was more variable and tended to be delayed for most medication.

medications - trials 3817, 3818, 3819 
Note: Ratio is ETR (with/without semaglutide). Metformin, ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed at 
steady state. Warfarin, digoxin and atorvastatin were assessed after a single dose. Pre-specified limit of 90% CI 
[0.8; 1.25]. 
INR was measured over a 168-hour period after a single dose of warfarin with and without 
semaglutide. An increase in INR indicates a prolonged blood clotting time. The average increase of 
clotting time after warfarin dosing during the two conditions were similar; the estimated treatment 
ratio (with/without semaglutide) for iAUCINR, 0−168h and INRmax were 1.05 [0.87; 1.28]90% CI and 1.04 
[0.99; 1.10]90% CI, respectively.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
To investigate the effect of semaglutide on PD properties related to glycaemic control and weight loss, 
a number of PD parameters were evaluated at steady state after 12 weeks in the clinical pharmacology 
programme. 
Pharmacodynamic properties in relation to glucose metabolism 
The primary mode of action responsible for the effects of the GLP-1 RAs on glycaemic control is 
increased insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets during elevated 
glucose levels. Thus, several PD parameters assessing different aspect of islets function (mainly the β-
cell) and responsiveness have been included as PD endpoints. 
Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose responses 
Semaglutide improves glycaemic control in patients with T2D by lowering fasting and postprandial 
glucose concentrations (Figure 5). The lowering of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) with semaglutide was 
evident already after the first dose for doses of 0.2 mg or higher (trial 1821). 
Semaglutide lowered fasting glucose concentrations by 22% after 12 weeks of semaglutide treatment, 
the overall 24-hour glucose response (AUC0-24h) by 22% and the absolute postprandial responses 
(AUC0-5 h after each meal) by 20–29% compared with placebo assessed with three standardised meals 
(breakfast, lunch and protein-rich dinner) (trial 3635). 
The mean postprandial increments in glucose were lowered by 0.6–1.1 mmol/L (11-20 mg/dL) with 
semaglutide compared with placebo. In addition, semaglutide lowered the 2-hour postprandial glucose 
concentration after the breakfast meal by 37% as compared to placebo; the decrease was 4.1 mmol/L 
(74 mg/dL) in semaglutide-treated patients. The reduced gastric emptying during the early 
postprandial phase contributed to a lower postprandial increase in glucose in patients treated with 
semaglutide as compared with placebo.

β-cell function and responsiveness 
First and second phase insulin secretion 
In patients with T2D, defects in insulin secretion occur at an early stage during development of the 
disease, and a decline in first phase insulin secretion is among the first observations. The influence of 
semaglutide on first and second phase insulin secretion was therefore investigated following an 
intravenous bolus of glucose (IVGTT) in patients with T2D (trial 3635). 
First- and second-phase insulin concentration and insulin secretion rate increased approximate 3-fold 
and 2-fold with semaglutide as compared to placebo (Figure 6).

2 diabetes mellitus. 
Glucose dependent insulin secretory response 
Native GLP-1 is known to stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, and this ability 
was investigated for semaglutide in a graded glucose infusion test during a gradual increase of glucose 
from normoglycaemia to hyperglycaemia in patients with T2D (trial 3635). Healthy untreated subjects 
were included as a comparator group. 
The insulin concentration and insulin secretion rate (ISR) corresponding to the glucose increase from 5 
to 12 mmol/L (90−216 mg/dL), was ~ 2.5 fold higher with semaglutide than with placebo in patients 
with T2D (Figure 7). With semaglutide, the insulin concentration and the ISR in patients with T2D was 
comparable to that of untreated healthy subjects. The increasingly larger insulin secretion with 
increasing glucose concentrations demonstrates that semaglutide improved the insulin secretory 
response to elevated glucose levels in a glucose-dependent manner.

Maximum β-cell secretory capacity 
An arginine stimulation test was performed to assess maximum β-cell secretory capacity on a basis of 
induced hyperglycaemic conditions. Semaglutide-treated patients had an approximate 4-fold larger 
increase in insulin secretion than placebo treated patients (trial 3635). 
Fasting insulin and C-peptide levels 
As expected of an incretin, fasting insulin and C-peptide increased 30% and 23%, respectively after 12 
weeks treatment with semaglutide in patients with T2D, as compared with placebo (trial 3635). 
HOMA-IR and HOMA-B 
The data in the phase 3 trials show improvements in both HOMA-B and HOMA-IR. In the PD trial 
(3635), there was no apparent improvement in HOMA IR that may be explained by a generally better 
controlled diabetes (lower HbA1c, lower BMI) in line with the inclusion criteria of this PD trial and may 
thus have reduced the improvability of insulin resistance in these subjects.  
Glucagon 
T2D is associated with inappropriately high glucagon secretion both at fasting and at postprandial 
conditions, contributing to high hepatic glucose output. GLP-1 RAs induce glucose-dependent lowering 
of glucagon secretion, which in turn lowers the hepatic glucose output. The ability of semaglutide to 
decrease glucagon secretion was investigated in patients with T2D during various glucose metabolism 
tests. Semaglutide treatment resulted in relative reductions compared to placebo in fasting glucagon of 
8-21%, postprandial glucagon response of 14-15% and mean 24-hour glucagon concentration of 12% 
(trials 3684 and 3635). 
In the graded glucose infusion test, a glucose-dependent decrease in glucagon levels was observed 
with increasing glucose concentrations both with semaglutide and placebo, however, the glucagon 
Ozempic

decrease was more pronounced with semaglutide, further supporting the glucose-dependent responses 
of both insulin and glucagon (trial 3635). 
Counter-regulatory response to hypoglycaemia 
During induced hypoglycaemia, semaglutide did not alter the counter regulatory responses of 
increased glucagon, and did not impair the plasma glucose dependent decrease in C-peptide 
concentrations in patients with T2D as compared to placebo (trial 3684). 
There was a lower increase in concentrations of noradrenaline and cortisol for patients when treated 
with semaglutide compared with placebo. A decreased recognition of hypoglycaemia was also 
observed. 
Gastric emptying 
GLP-1 inhibits gastric emptying, causing a reduction in postprandial plasma glucose excursions. While 
decreased gastric emptying is an important physiological effect of native GLP-1, and short-acting GLP-
1R agonists like exenatide and lixisenatide, decreased gastric emptying is less pronounced for long-
acting GLP-1R agonist like liraglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide and semaglutide. The effect of steady 
state semaglutide on gastric emptying was assessed after 12 weeks of treatment during standardised 
meal settings in subjects with obesity (trial 3685) and in patients with T2D (trial 1821). 
Semaglutide reduced gastric emptying in subjects with obesity during the first hour after a meal (AUC 
of paracetamol reduced by 27%), and consistent reductions in early gastric emptying were seen in 
patients with T2D. The gastric emptying over the full postprandial period was not reduced, or slightly 
reduced for semaglutide doses of 0.2–1.6 mg (range for treatment ratios 0.87−0.96) when assessed in 
subjects with obesity and patients with T2D. The reduced gastric emptying during the early 
postprandial phase reduces the rate at which glucose appears in the circulation post-prandially, and 
may have contributed to the observed reductions in postprandial glucose. No effects of delayed gastric 
emptying on the PK properties of co-administered drugs were evident. 
Pharmacodynamic properties in relation to weight loss 
The GLP-1 receptor is expressed in the human brain in areas involved in satiety and appetite 
regulation, and changes in plasma GLP-1 concentrations increase the brain activity in these areas. 
GLP-1 has been shown to induce decreased hunger, increased satiety and a lower energy intake and 
thereby weight loss in humans. In animal studies, semaglutide is taken up in specific brain regions and 
increases key satiety and decreases key hunger signals. Using isolated brain tissue sections, 
semaglutide has been shown to activate satiety related neurons and inhibit hunger related neurons. 
Body weight and composition 
Change in body weight from baseline to end of treatment was assessed in all clinical pharmacology 
trials. A reduction in body weight with semaglutide was observed across trials and populations (T2D 
and obesity), with a mean weight loss of 4–5 kg in 12 weeks, compared with a neutral effect on body 
weight with placebo. The effect of semaglutide on body composition was investigated in subjects with 
obesity using air displacement plethysmography (trial 3685) showing that the body weight loss with 
semaglutide was predominantly from fat tissue with loss of fat mass being 3-fold larger than loss of 
lean mass.

Appetite, energy intake and energy expenditure 
Semaglutide reduced appetite, improved control of eating, reduced food cravings and reduced 
preference for high fat foods, as compared to placebo in a dedicated trial (trial 3685) in subjects with 
obesity. This translated into a substantial lower energy intake with semaglutide. The energy intake of 3 
consecutive ad libitum meals was 18-35% lower with semaglutide than with placebo (Figure 8). Across 
meals on the test day, this corresponds to a reduction in energy intake of more than 3000 kJ (appr. 
700 kcal) with semaglutide, corresponding to 24% lower ad libitum energy intake as compared to 
placebo. Based on ratings of nausea and palatability, there were no indications of food aversion or 
nausea during the meals being responsible for this markedly reduced food and energy intake.

obesity after 12 weeks of treatment – trial 3685 
Note: Figure shows ETD and corresponding 95% CI. 
Abbreviations: CI: confidence interval; ETD: estimated treatment difference. 
Semaglutide reduced energy expenditure as assessed by resting metabolic rate (RMR) using indirect 
calorimetry/ventilated hood system by appr. 600 kJ per day. The underlying mechanism is not fully 
elucidated. A minor part of the difference could be explained by the observed difference in body lean 
mass between treatments. No effect of semaglutide on respiratory quotient (RQ) was shown, indicating 
no difference in oxidation of macronutrients following semaglutide treatment. 
The semaglutide-induced weight loss due to the reduced energy intake was primarily mediated through 
less appetite, however, other mechanisms including improvements in the control of eating, fewer food 
cravings and a lower relative preference for fatty, energy-dense foods may also have contributed to 
the reduced energy intake. 
Lipids 
The effect of semaglutide on lipid metabolism was assessed prior to (fasting) and up to 8 hours 
postprandially during a standardised fat-rich breakfast meal in subjects with obesity (trial 3685). These 
results suggest an improvement in lipid metabolism. 
Cardiac repolarisation by QT interval evaluation 
The potential effects of semaglutide on QTc interval and cardiac repolarisation were tested in a 
dedicated thorough QTc trial, designed and conducted in accordance with recommendations in 
Ozempic 
Assessment report

guidelines including supra-therapeutic dose levels of semaglutide up to 1.5 mg at steady state as 
agreed with the FDA. 
During the 48-hour post-dose ECG recording at steady state of the supratherapeutic 1.5 mg 
semaglutide/placebo dose level, 11 time-matched QTcI measurements (QT interval individually corrected 
for heart rate) were performed (Table 3). 
Table 3 QT interval individually corrected for heart rate 
Evaluations were also made using QTcF, QTcB and QTcL corrections. No prolongation of QTcL and QTcF 
was observed at any of the three dose levels. For QTcB a prolongation was observed at all dose levels i.e. 
the upper limits of at least one of the 11 two-sided 90% CIs for the estimated mean treatment 
differences were above 10 ms (Figure 9). Bazett’s correction may overcorrect the QT interval when the 
heart rate is elevated. Increased heart rate is a well-known class effect of GLP-1s as reproduced in this 
study (Figure 9) and hence QTcB is not appropriate for this analysis.

Treatment with semaglutide was associated with an increase in heart rate and PR interval at all dose 
levels. The increase in pulse rate seemed dose dependant and varied over the day; the mean highest 
changes were: 
•  0.5 mg: 8.48 bpm [6.87; 10.09]90% CI 
1.0 mg: 9.66 bpm [8.04; 11.29]90% CI 
• 
•  1.5 mg: 11.10 bpm [9.58; 12.62]90% CI 
The mean highest change in PR interval was apparently not dose dependant: 
•  0.5 mg: 10.72 ms [6.25; 15.20]90% CI 
•  1.0 mg: 9.22 ms [4.96; 13.47]90% CI 
•  1.5 mg: 10.02 ms [6.15; 13.89]90% CI 
The effect of semaglutide on PR appears larger than with other GLP-1RAs. When assessed by office 
measurements, semaglutide seems to antagonize the beta-blocker-induced pulse rate reduction. As 
beta-blockers were not a randomised treatment in the CVOT, the implications hereof cannot be 
assessed. Extrapolation of the CV outcome results to subjects without established CV disease 
remains difficult. In these subjects the differences in office HR were larger than in the whole 
population. 
Exposure-response analyses 
Semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg are the proposed maintenance doses for use in patients with T2D. The 
exposure-response analysis should be interpreted with caution, since no model evaluation for the 
development of the base population PK model and the exposure-response models has been provided 
by the applicant. The relationships were analysed using exposure-response models on data from four 
phase 3a trials (trials 3623, 3626, 3624 and 4091) using the average, model-derived semaglutide 
plasma concentration at maintenance dose level (Cavg) as the exposure variable (see 2.4.2.1. ) 
The change from baseline in HbA1c was exposure-dependent. A consistent increase in effect was 
observed across the concentration range associated with 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg semaglutide 
(approximately 10–50 nmol/L) (Figure 10). Reductions in HbA1c achieved with semaglutide in the lower 
end of the concentration range were substantial, and greater than those observed with placebo and 
comparators in the phase 3a clinical trials.

Notes: Data are mean HbA 1c values with 95% CI obtained after 30 weeks of treatment versus exposure expressed 
as quantiles of C avg (plus placebo at C avg of 0 nM). Horizontal lines with diamonds along the x-axes represent 
median and 95% exposure ranges. 
For exposures associated with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg, there was a clear exposure-response 
relationship with respect to change from baseline in HbA1c, a relationship that was similar in males and 
females and across subgroups of body weight, age, race, ethnicity, diabetes duration and renal 
function. Thus, based on data from the population PK and exposure-response analyses, all patients 
should be dosed in accordance with the proposed dosing regimen for semaglutide. A small additional 
decrease of HbA1c was observed between when semaglutide 1.0 mg compared to 0.5 mg dose level. 
Both the 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg seem to reach the plateau of the Emax curve for HbA1c. In patients with 
a baseline HbA1c higher than 8.7% a clear additional effect of increasing dose to 1.0 mg can be 
observed.  
Figure 11 HbA1c change from baseline after 30 weeks of treatment (mean and 95% CI in 6 
quantiles + placebo) versus exposure of semaglutide for all subjects combined, stratified by 
baseline HbA1 
The response versus semaglutide exposure shows that semaglutide effects level off at high 
concentrations, indicating that limited extra benefit would be achieved with semaglutide doses above 
1.0 mg. The decrease in HbA1c with exposure appeared larger with higher baseline HbA1c. For patients 
with baseline HbA1c in the lowest quantile (5.9–7.4%-points), the change in HbA1c at high exposure 
was approximately 1%-points whereas at the highest baseline HbA1c quantile (8.7–13.1%-points), the 
change was approximately 3%-points. 
The proportion of patients reaching the ADA and AACE treatment targets of HbA 1c <7% and ≤6.5%, 
respectively, increased with increasing exposure. Overall, the glycaemic response as assessed by 
HbA1c reduction and proportion of patients reaching HbA1c targets increased with increasing 
semaglutide exposure within the concentration range obtained with 0.5 and 1.0 mg semaglutide. This 
also indicates that increasing the dose from 0.5 mg semaglutide to 1.0 mg semaglutide will provide 
improved glycaemic control. 
Body weight loss increased with increasing exposure in a linear fashion in the investigated exposure 
range of approximately 10–50 nmol/L. The linear relationship between exposure and body weight 
change indicates that higher exposure may lead to larger weight loss (i.e., the effect did not reach a 
plateau). 
The company also developed exposure response models to evaluate the safety of semaglutide. The 
exposure-response relationship for gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and 
constipation) pulse rate and calcitonin concentration have been evaluated. A clear exposure response

relationship was observed for gastrointestinal adverse events. Pulse rate and calcitonin concentration 
showed no significant results.

The company evaluated the relationship between body weight and the safety and efficacy of 
semaglutide. The incidence of GI adverse effects (including nausea) was highest in the patient group 
with a body weight <70kg.However no difference between the semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg dose level 
was observed. In other body weight categories an increased rate of GI AEs with semaglutide 1.0 mg 
versus semaglutide 0.5 mg was seen; the largest differences in rate of GI AEs between the two 
semaglutide dosing groups were not in the lowest body weight category (<70 kg) but in the second 
(70−90 kg) and third (90−110 kg) lowest body weight categories. The efficacy (HbA1c change from 
baseline response) appears to be similar across body weight subgroups with the same dose of 
semaglutide. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Methodology 
During clinical development, it was discovered that the bioanalytical LOCI assay for the detection of 
semaglutide in plasma was influenced by a matrix effect. As a result of this the pharmacokinetic results 
the early studies 1820 1821, 3633 and 3679 in which the LOCI assay has been used, should be 
interpreted with caution and should not be directly compared to the results of the LC-MS/MS studies. 
As the essential studies 3634 (comparison PK/PD-Caucasian and Japanese subjects) and 3687 
(Equivalence -product strength) were conducted to replace early studies (3633 and 3679), the 
differences between the analytical methods are no reason for concern. 
The LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method is considered appropriately validated and suitable for the analysis 
of semaglutide. Also, the analytical methods that have been used in the interaction study with digoxin 
and the interaction study with the oral contraceptive LNG/EE comply with the bioanalytical guideline.  
Appropriate pharmacokinetic parameters have been determined and standard statistical methods have 
been used in the submitted studies. The pharmacokinetic endpoints were analysed and compared 
between treatments using linear normal models (ANCOVA) with the log-transformed endpoint as the 
dependent variable. All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, 
USA). These statistical methods are acceptable.

The methods used in the development of the population PK model and exposure-response models have 
been described by the applicant. The analysis plan for the population PK and the different exposure-
response models has been provided. However, no full model approach was used in the development of 
the model based on Phase III data. The results of the population PK and the exposure response 
analysis should therefore be interpreted with caution.  
The structural population PK model was based on a one compartmental model including ka, CL/F and 
V/F, in which ka was fixed. The company fixed ka due to the sparse sampling approach used in the 
phase III clinical trials. The ka was fixed on a value based on early clinical pharmacology trials. 
Between-subject variability on ka could only be determined using an additional model extension with a 
fixed variance for ka. However, no details were presented by the company about the outcome of the 
model.  
The applicant did not use a full modelling approach for the phase III data used in the development of 
the population PK model. The company adequately showed that including all pre-specified covariates 
did not significantly have any influence on the results of the population PK analysis. The included 
covariates (besides bodyweight) cannot explain between subject variability. Since the between-subject 
variability of semaglutide pharmacokinetics is relatively low in healthy volunteers and between subject 
variability on CL/F in the reduced model is relatively low in patients with T2D, the variability between 
patients is not expected to cause major differences in pharmacokinetics of semaglutide between 
patients.  
The PD models used in the exposure-response analysis have been pre-specified. No details on the 
model development of these models has been provided by the applicant. Also, the modelling approach 
for the responder analysis for HbA1c and gastro-intestinal adverse events was not pre-specified. 
Therefore, the results of the PD models are interpreted with caution.  
Pharmacokinetics of semaglutide 
In general, the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide in patients with T2D are adequately characterised by 
the applicant during the clinical pharmacology programme. The maximum single dose tested in healthy 
subjects was 20 μg/kg body weight and the maximum tolerated single dose was 15 μg/kg body weight. 
The maximum multiple dose tested was 1.5 mg OW and in T2D patients, the maximum multiple dose 
tested was 1.6 mg OW. 
The pharmacokinetic profile is suitable for once weekly subcutaneous administration due to the 
prolonged release characteristics (e.g. albumin binding, slow release from subcutis and reduced 
degradation by enzymes) of semaglutide. 
The observed median t max for semaglutide was 1–3 days (range 26–60 hours) and was similar across 
doses and populations. Based on the presented concentration time profiles be concluded that delayed 
absorption from the subcutis contributes to a prolonged half-life of semaglutide S.C. formulation. 
However, based on the fact that the mean t max (38 hours) is relatively short compared to the MRT for 
s.c. semaglutide (230hours) it can be concluded that long t1/2 of semaglutide is driven mainly by 
systemic elimination (data from study 3687). This supports the claimed mechanisms of prolonged 
exposure. 
Because endogenous GLP-1 is metabolised by DPP-IV and NEP, these enzymes are expected to be 
involved in the metabolism of the structurally related semaglutide. The company demonstrated that 
DPP-IV enzymes (and as such polymorphisms) have a minor role in the degradation of semaglutide. 
DPP-IV polymorphisms are therefore likely to be negligible. In vitro study 215514 shows that NEP is 
Ozempic 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017  
Page 49/156 
 
 
 
 
one of the enzymes involved in semaglutide degradation. The company did not investigate the 
influence of genetic polymorphisms of NEP. However, the company discussed that no signs of influence 
of polymorphisms of NEP on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide could be identified. Therefore, it is 
acceptable to conclude that polymorphisms are unlikely or the influence of these polymorphisms is 
minor. 
Different formulations and injection sites 
In study 3687 equivalence between the product strengths (1 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL) were 
tested. The formulations were all bioequivalent with respect to total exposure (AUC) but a 
concentration dependent shift of the Cmax and t max has been observed, a faster absorption from the 
subcutaneous compartment was observed when a smaller volume with higher concentration was 
injected subcutaneously. These data suggest that the rate of absorption from the subcutaneous 
compartment is dependent on the concentration of the formulation. 
The applicant evaluated the differences between injection sites in the population PK analysis using 
steady state data. Studies 3652 and 3684 demonstrated that injection site (abdomen or thigh) does 
not lead to any relevant differences in average steady state exposure of semaglutide. The conducted 
population PK analysis is suitable to compare steady state Cmax concentrations, however average 
exposure is considered more relevant than absorption rate or Cmax for a drug with limited fluctuation 
between minimum and maximum concentrations at steady state. Based on the totality of data can be 
concluded that steady state exposure is comparable between abdomen, upper arm and thigh injection. 
Based on the presented data it can be concluded that all three injection sites, can be used 
interchangeably.  
The population PK model does not describe semaglutide pharmacokinetics after a single dose 
accurately and therefore it cannot be excluded that the pharmacokinetics after the first dose of 
semaglutide are different between the injection sites due to a different ka. However, this is not 
expected to result in significant safety or efficacy results. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
The pharmacokinetics of semaglutide has been studied in healthy volunteers, in T2D patients and in 
obese patients. The results are generally consistent across populations and across studies; though 
clearance and volume of distribution are significantly higher in T2D patients than in healthy volunteers. 
In the target T2D population, estimated steady-state volume of distribution of semaglutide is about 
12L compared to about 8L in healthy volunteers. Clearance in subjects with T2D is higher in the target 
population. Mean CL/F was approximately 0.05 L/h compared to about 0.035 L/h in healthy subjects. It 
has been demonstrated that CL/F and Vz/F is dependent on body weight and, consequently, BMI. BMI 
inclusion criteria differed among the various clinical pharmacology studies, with a higher BMI allowed 
for studies in T2D patients. This difference largely drives the observed discrepancy of CL/F and Vz/F 
between healthy volunteers and T2D patients. 
The population PK analysis was used to evaluate variability in subjects with T2D. However, since a lot 
of the included covariates had 1.00 in the 95% CI and the included covariates were likely to show 
collinearity. The applicant provided run results of a reduced model without including all covariates. This 
did not signifcantly change the population PK estimates and their inter-subject variabilities, therefore it 
can be concluded that the non-significant covariates are not relevant. Therefore, bodyweight is the 
only identified factor causing variability in pharmacokinetics.

Special populations 
Various special populations have been evaluated by the applicant (e.g. renal/hepatic impairment, 
gender, race/ethnicity, age group, weight and subjects with the presence of anti-semaglutide 
antibodies). Gender, race/ethnicity, age groups and subjects with the presence of anti-semaglutide 
antibodies show no relevant effects on exposure of semaglutide. Semaglutide was not studied in 
children. 
Since semaglutide is highly protein bound, pharmacokinetics could be influenced by renal function and 
albuminuria. The renal impairment study 3616 and the population PK analysis did not show a change 
in exposure of semaglutide for different degrees of renal impairment. However, urinary excretion of 
semaglutide could not be determined in the renal impairment study (3616) at the time, due to 
unavailability of a suitable assay. Urinary excretion was determined in two other studies (3789 and 
3651). In study 3789 (AME trial) approximately 3% of semaglutide was estimated to be excreted. 
Study 3651 showed urinary concentrations below LOQ. This indicates low renal excretion of 
semaglutide, supporting the conclusion that semaglutide appears not to be dependent on degree of 
renal impairment. The company assessed if albuminuria could influence the pharmacokinetics of 
semaglutide. The company investigated the correlation between exposure (cavg) versus baseline 
urinary albumin creatinin ratio (UACR) in data from phase IIIa studies. The semaglutide exposure was 
independent on the level of UACR. Further the LC-MS/MS assay used for the detection of semaglutide 
had a lower limit of quantitation of 1.94 nmol/L, while the Cmax range was 7.4-9.8 nmol/L. The 
relatively high LLOQ may have consequences for the interpretation of the study results as low 
concentrations cannot be measured appropriately. However, in this study most subjects had samples 
with a concentration above LLOQ at 240 hours and a least the full dosing interval of 168 hours was 
covered. Therefore the results of the renal impairment study (3616) were considered to be reliable.  
The study 3651 investigating the effect of hepatic impairment on the exposure of semaglutide, showed 
that the total exposure of semaglutide and its Cmax is comparable between subjects mild, moderate, 
and severe hepatic impairment (all with a diagnosis of cirrhosis and classified as Child-Pugh A,B, or C) 
to healthy matched controls. An increase in the fraction unbound with increasing degree of hepatic 
impairment was observed. However, this increasing free fraction of semaglutide with increasing degree 
of hepatic impairment does not appear to affect the semaglutide exposure and half-life. As exposure 
was unchanged hepatic impairment is not expected to change the efficacy.  
A clear effect of body weight on the pharmacokinetics of semaglutide was observed in the population 
PK analysis. This analysis showed that exposure of semaglutide was inversely correlated to body 
weight. Exposure increased by 40% in subjects weighing 55 kg and decreased by 27% in subjects 
weighing 127 kg as compared to a standard weight of 85 kg. From a PK point of view, body weight 
dosing would be in favour for semaglutide. This is further discussed in the pharmacodynamics section. 
Interactions 
In vitro studies suggest that semaglutide has a very low potential inhibit or induce CYP enzymes.  
In clinical drug –drug interaction studies a delay in gastric emptying has been observed (Study 1821). 
Drug-drug interactions between semaglutide 1,0 mg and the following drugs from different BCS classes 
metformin, warfarin, digoxin, atorvastatin or oral contraceptive combination drug (ethinylestradiol and 
levonorgestrel) were evaluated. The atorvastatin Cmax was substantially decreased by 38% (90% CI 
18-53%) while AUC exposure of atorvastatin was unchanged. The reduced Cmax of atorvastatin, which 
may result from delayed gastric emptying caused by semaglutide, is unlikely to be of clinical relevance, 
as atorvastatin efficacy is related to AUC, which is unchanged, rather than Cmax.

The pharmacokinetics of other investigated medication was not affected by concomitantly administered 
drugs. It was noted that the tmax was more variable and tended to be delayed for most concomitant 
medication. The results demonstrate that delayed gastric emptying following semaglutide treatment is 
unlikely to result in clinically relevant DDIs with the investigated drugs, except perhaps for warfarin 
where in some subjects following a single dose a change in INR was seen The following sentence has 
therefore been included in the SmPC section 4.5: “However, upon initiation of semaglutide treatment 
in patients on warfarin and/or coumarin derivatives, frequent monitoring of INR is recommended.” 
In none of the DDI studies the concomitant drugs were administered for a sufficiently long time period 
to observe an effect on semaglutide exposure. However, no interaction with these drugs is expected 
based on the metabolic pathways and transporter properties of semaglutide. 
The applicant did not conduct any interaction studies with drugs that may affect the bioavailability of 
semaglutide. Enzymes DPP-IV and NEP may play a role in the metabolism of semaglutide. The role of 
DPP-IV appears to be only minor in the degradation of semaglutide. Therefore, DPP-IV inhibitors are 
not expected to cause any relevant interactions. For NEP, semaglutide is metabolised by multiple 
metabolic pathways, including degradation by NEP. As degradation of semaglutide is not only based on 
NEP the impact of NEP interactions is expected to be limited. Nine subjects were co-treated with the 
NEP-inhibitor racecadotril (for diarrhoea) and safety data did not indicate elevated incidence of GI AEs. 
According to the applicant this would indicate that the exposure to semaglutide is not affected by the 
NEP inhibitor. Assessment of these safety data is difficult as the monitored adverse event is the same 
as the indication of racecadotril (diarrhoea) and PK data are absent. Despite of this, it is agreed that 
impact of NEP interactions is expected to be limited.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Semaglutide treatment, as compared with placebo, lowered fasting and postprandial blood glucose by 
improving multiple aspects of beta-cell function, including insulin secretion, and by reducing both 
fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations, all in a glucose dependent manner. The data in the 
phase 3 trials show improvements in both HOMA-B and HOMA-IR. In the PD trial (3635), there was no 
apparent improvement in HOMA IR that may be explained by a generally better controlled diabetes 
(lower HbA1c, lower BMI) in line with the inclusion criteria of this PD trial and may thus have reduced 
the improvability of insulin resistance in these subjects. The mechanism of postprandial blood glucose 
lowering also involved a delay in gastric emptying. 
Counter-regulation during hypoglycaemia was comparable with semaglutide treatment as compared 
with placebo. This was based on responses in concentrations of glucagon and C-peptide, and in glucose 
need during the clamp (AUCGIR). A decreased recognition of hypoglycaemia was also observed. It is 
not clear if this should be considered favourable or not: on the one hand, it may represent subject’s 
adaptation to normalised glucose levels, on the other hand, it could represent hypoglycaemia 
unawareness. 
The body weight loss observed with semaglutide was primarily from fat tissue. The mechanism of body 
weight loss involved lowered appetite, both in the fasting and postprandial state, leading to lowered 
daily energy intake. Semaglutide improved control of eating, reduced food cravings and reduced the 
preference for high fat foods, as compared to placebo. However, semaglutide reduced energy 
expenditure as assessed by resting metabolic rate (RMR) using indirect calorimetry/ventilated hood 
system by appr. 600 kJ per day. The underlying mechanism is not clear.

As evidenced by the QTc trial, semaglutide does not prolong QTc values. However, the effect of 
semaglutide on pulse rate appears to be larger than with other GLP-1RAs. When assessed by office 
measurements, semaglutide seems to antagonize the beta-blocker-induced pulse rate reduction. As 
beta-blockers were not a randomised treatment in the CVOT, the implications hereof cannot be 
assessed. Extrapolation of the CV outcome results to subjects without established CV disease remains 
difficult. In these subjects the differences in office HR were larger than in the whole population. 
Consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class effect, a small, persistent increase in resting pulse 
rate was observed with semaglutide in the clinical trial data available at the time of planning the 
thorough QT/QTc trial, trial 3652. QTcI, QTcL and QTcF changes were all below regulatory thresholds. 
For the observed data, a negative correlation between QTcB and RR interval was found; this 
association is demonstrated to materialize (albeit weakly) at a heart rate of 60. Consequently, 
overestimation may be an issue using QTcB in this study. Such association was not present for QTcI 
and RR intervals. Therefore QTcI (individual heart rate corrected QT interval) was pre-specified as the 
primary endpoint in this trial; avoiding correction methods for the primary objective that is known to 
be problematic for compounds with properties to elevate heart rate. 
The exposure response model not provide support for the statements made in the report about a 
better glycaemic control with the 1.0 mg dose compared to the 0.5 mg dose. Both the 0.5 mg and 1.0 
mg seem to reach the plateau of the Emax curve for HbA1c. The number of GI events and time of GI 
events increases, whereas HbA1c concentrations already seem to reach plateau at the Emax curve. This 
issue is further discussed in the Clinical Efficacy section. 
The population PK analysis also showed a significant effect of body weight on the exposure of 
semaglutide. Patients with a relatively low body weight, and thus a higher exposure to semaglutide, 
appear to have a higher incidence of GI events and a lower chance that these adverse events subside 
over time due to tolerance. The applicant conducted an additional analysis to evaluate the relationship 
between body weight and the safety and efficacy of semaglutide. In this analysis no clear body weight 
related trend in the reporting of GI AEs and nausea has been observed across body weight categories 
and the efficacy (HbA1c change from baseline response) appears to be similar across body weight 
subgroups with the same dose of semaglutide. It can be concluded that both dose levels of 
semaglutide can be the safe and efficacious and should be based on individual needs. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In general, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of semaglutide have been sufficiently 
characterised. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose selection, dose response studies 
The selection of doses used in the phase 3a programme was determined by data from the phase 2 
dose-finding trial (1821). Doses were selected based on pre-defined criteria: i) the lowest dose had to 
be at least 0.5 %-point better than placebo on HbA1c change from baseline, ii) the increments between 
the two doses had to support a clinically meaningful separation on glycaemic control with a ΔHbA1c 
≥0.3 %-point when evaluating data from patients that completed the treatment, iii) both doses had to 
be well-tolerated.

The results and the model-estimated results predicted the 1.0 mg semaglutide dose had the greatest 
effect on HbA1c. Based on these predicted responses both semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg met the 
pre-specified criteria. However, the 0.4 mg already showed 0.61 %−point HbA1c reduction from 
baseline compared with placebo. 
Mean values with 95% confidence intervals vs semaglutide dose (plus placebo at dose of 0 mg) for the 
completer population. The non-linear line represents the covariate-adjusted model-derived dose-
response estimate for the completer population. 
Although semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. 0.5 mg showed a larger effect on HbA1c and body weight, the 
estimated treatment differences were small (range: 0.10−0.43%−point HbA1c and 0.81−2.75 kg body 
weight). Also, additional reduction on CV risk was small (HR 0.77 vs. 0.71). In the clinical trials, 
significantly more patients with semaglutide 1.0 mg compared with 0.5 mg reached the treatment 
target of an HbA1c <7%. The lowest dose response was observed in the global monotherapy trial 3623 
where the difference between semaglutide doses did not reach statistical significance. 
Gastrointestinal disorders were the most frequent adverse reactions with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 
mg. In general, the proportion of patients experiencing an event - and the time with events - increased 
with semaglutide exposure. Dose-dependent increases in GI AEs were most notably with nausea and 
vomiting. 
The proportion of patients with episodes of hypoglycaemia and the corresponding rates were generally 
similar for semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg across the range of concomitant OADs and insulins. Dose-
dependent increases in mean levels of pancreatic enzymes (lipase and amylase) were observed in the 
CVOT. A slightly higher increase in pulse rate was observed with semaglutide 1.0 mg than with 0.5 mg. 
The company proposes that patients should be escalated to the semaglutide 0.5 mg maintenance dose, 
and if well-tolerated the dose can be increased to 1.0 mg to further improve efficacy based on the 
needs of the individual patient. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The phase 3a trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in a broad T2D population. The 
programme evaluated mono- and combination therapy (primarily combinations with metformin, SU 
and/or insulin) with anti-hyperglycaemic therapies and compared semaglutide with diabetes drugs 
most commonly used at the time of initiating the phase 3a programme (Figure 13). Semaglutide was 
investigated at two dose levels (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) in all phase 3a trials, except for trial 3624 
(1.0 mg only vs exenatide ER). 
For five of the phase 3a trials, the primary objective was to evaluate the effect of semaglutide on 
glycaemic control (trials 3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627). Throughout this document, these five 
trials are referred to as the key efficacy trials. In addition, two phase 3a trials evaluated semaglutide 
for treatment of T2D in Japanese subjects (trials 4092 and 4091), referred to as the Japanese trials. 
While safety was the primary endpoint for the Japanese trials, they were designed and conducted in a 
similar manner to the key efficacy trials. 
The last phase 3a trial was a 104−week cardiovascular outcomes trial (trial 3744) in a T2D population 
at high risk of CV events that investigated the effect of semaglutide on CV events as well as long-term 
safety and efficacy, and it is referred to as the CVOT. 
All phase 3a trials were randomised, parallel group, multi-centre trials in which the therapeutic 
response to semaglutide was compared with that of placebo or an active comparator drug. There was 
Ozempic 
Assessment report

Page 54/156 
 
 
 
 
no washout or discontinuation of previous background medication prior to randomisation. The main 
design and trial procedures were very similar and aligned across all phase 3a trials (except the CVOT), 
but differed in the required diabetes background medication, comparators, and length of treatment 
periods. The duration of treatment in the phase 3a trials ranged from 30 to 104 weeks. 
Figure 13 Combination therapy and comparators in the phase 3a trials. 
Notes: Trial 3626 primarily included subjects (94%) receiving metformin as only background treatment. Trial 3624 
primarily included subjects receiving 1-2 OADs as background medication (49% received metformin, and 45% 
received a combination of metformin and SU). Trial 3625 primarily included subjects receiving 1-2 OADs as 
background medication (48% received metformin and 51% received a combination of metformin and SU. 
Dose-escalation regimen 
To mitigate gastrointestinal side effects, all semaglutide-treated patients followed a fixed dose-
escalation regimen starting at 0.25 mg for 4 weeks before escalating to 0.5 mg as maintenance dose 
or another 4 weeks before escalating to 1 mg maintenance dose. Selection of dose-escalation regimen 
for the phase 3a programme was based on estimations from the phase 2 dose-finding trial (trial 1821) 
and tested by results from the clinical pharmacology trial 3819 prior to implementation in all phase 3a 
trials. Semaglutide 0.25 mg has not been investigated as a therapeutic dose. 
Blinding 
The phase 3a trials were blinded to the extent possible, based on the nature of the comparators to 
ensure the best possible basis for unbiased interpretation. Placebo-controlled trials (trials 3623, 3627 
and 3744) were double-blinded, consistent with standard of research and regulatory guidance. Double-
blinding was obtained within volume of injection/dose groups (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg). No blinding of dose 
(0.5 mg vs 1.0 mg) was performed. A double-blind trial design was attained for trial 3626 vs sitagliptin 
(OADs) via a double-dummy treatment scheme. An open-label trial design was necessary for some 
trials. The insulin-comparator trial (trial 3625 vs insulin Glargin (as add-on to OADs) was conducted as 
an open-label comparator trial due to the complexity of blinding of insulin given the need to titrate 
insulin dose level. Due to the complexity of preparing a placebo version of exenatide ER, the OW GLP-1

RA comparator trial (trial 3624) was conducted as an open-label trial. For both Japanese trials, an 
open-label trial design was used.

Statistical methods 
Phase 3a trials 
For the key efficacy trials, the primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to end-of-
treatment at week 30 (trials 3623, 3625 and 3627) or week 56 (trials 3624 and 3626). The primary 
estimand was defined as the difference in change in HbA1c from baseline to end-of-treatment between 
semaglutide and comparator, assuming that all randomised subjects remained on trial product at end-
of-treatment and had not initiated rescue medication. 
The primary analysis method pre-specified in the protocols for HbA1c (primary endpoint) and body 
weight (confirmatory secondary endpoint) and other continuous secondary endpoints assessed over 
time was a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM), with treatment, country (for the key 
efficacy trials), and trial-specific stratification as fixed factors and baseline value as covariate, all 
nested within visits. An unstructured covariance matrix was assumed for measurements within the 
same subject. The analysis was based on the FAS using the on-treatment without rescue medication 
observation period. The outcomes from these subjects and from subjects with no data at the end-of-
treatment visit were hereby assumed to be missing at random (MAR) in the analysis. Thus, this 
approach focuses on what these outcomes would have been, had they been measured, under the 
assumption that subjects had continued treatment without initiating rescue medication, in line with the 
primary estimand. The family-wise type 1 error rate was controlled in the strong sense (5%, two-
sided) using a pre-specified hierarchical testing scheme. 
Several sensitivity analyses were pre-specified in the protocols to evaluate the robustness of the 
conclusions drawn from the primary HbA1c analysis and the confirmatory secondary body weight 
analysis, and to investigate the impact of missing data and thus the validity of the MAR assumption of 
the MMRM. The sensitivity analyses included MMRM analysis based on all in trial data, complete case 
analysis, last observation carried forward analysis, comparator-based multiple imputation analysis and 
per-protocol analysis. 
CVOT 
The primary endpoint of the CVOT was defined as the time from randomisation to first MACE. To 
establish that semaglutide is not associated with an unacceptable excess cardiovascular risk, it was 
pre-specified in the statistical analysis that non-inferiority of semaglutide (pooled) vs placebo (pooled) 
was considered confirmed if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the hazard 
ratio (HR) is below 1.8 for the primary MACE endpoint. The primary endpoint was analysed using a 
stratified Cox proportional hazards model with semaglutide and placebo treatment group as fixed 
factor. The model was stratified by all possible combinations of the 3 stratification factors used in the 
randomisation procedure. A number of sensitivity analyses were pre-specified for the primary MACE 
endpoint to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis including analyses based on the on-
treatment observation period and different ascertainment windows following last drug date (7, 30 and 
42 days.

Background treatment 
The background treatments applied in the phase 3a programme reflect the treatment cascade in the 
T2D population; trials 3623 and 4092 evaluated semaglutide monotherapy in drug naïve patients; 
patients in trial 3626 vs Sita (as add-on to OADs) were mainly on a background treatment of 
metformin monotherapy, in trials 3624 vs Exe ER (as add-on to OADs) and 3625 vs IGlar (as add-on to 
OADs), close to half of patients were treated with metformin and the other half with metformin + SU at 
baseline. All patients in trial 3627 were on basal insulin therapy at baseline (Table 6). In trials 36224, 
3625, 3626 and 3627, mean dose of background treatment was in general close to (or higher than) 
the highest recommended doses.

Notes: For the evaluation of efficacy in subgroups, the following treatment groups will be combined: SU 
monotherapy, Insulin monotherapy and combination therapy, and ‘other’. N represents number of patients in FAS. 
Abbreviations: FAS, full analysis set. N: number of patients; OADs: oral anti-glycaemic drugs; SU: sulfonylurea. 
Cross-reference: /projstat/nn9535/nn9535-exploratory/sueot010. 
Patients in the CVOT were treated with semaglutide as add-on to standard-of-care and could therefore 
be anti-glycaemic drug naïve, or treated with 1 or 2 OAD(s), or treated with basal insulin or pre-mixed 
insulin, alone or in combination with 1 or 2 OAD(s). Hence, in the CVOT, there was a mix of 
background treatments. Evaluation of the effect of semaglutide as add-on to SGLT-2inhibitors was not 
part of the phase 3a programme, as no SGLT-2 inhibitor products were marketed at the time of design

and initiation of the programme (only few patients in the CVOT had SGLT-2 inhibitors added as 
standard-of-care treatment). 
Background medications were to be maintained at the stable, pre-trial dose and frequency during the 
treatment period in all trials except in the CVOT. Hence, other anti-glycaemic medications were 
administered and intensified in combination with semaglutide/placebo in the CVOT reflecting a real-
world clinical situation. In the phase 3a trials (excl. CVOT), patients with unacceptable hyperglycaemia 
were to be offered treatment intensification (rescue medication) in addition to randomised treatment. 
Data from patients on rescue treatment were censored in the efficacy analyses but included in safety 
evaluations. 
Comparators 
Head-to-head trials with the most relevant active comparators (sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin 
glargine) available at the time of the programme planning were included in the phase 3a programme. 
Patient disposition 
The proportion of patients completing the pre-planned treatment periods in the individual trials were 
ranging from 79.4 to 93.2% (Table 7 ). The two Japanese trials had the highest proportion of patients 
completing the trial and treatment. All efforts were to be made to keep the patients on treatment. 
However, in case of a potential safety concern (including pregnancy and pancreatitis), unacceptable 
intolerability or at request of the patient, the trial product could be discontinued. 
The primary reason for treatment discontinuation across trials were categorised as “adverse events” or 
“other reasons”. “Other reasons” included a variety of reasons not related to adverse events (AEs) or 
protocol deviations. The differences between semaglutide and placebo/comparators treatment groups 
were mainly due to a higher number of GI AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation with 
semaglutide; see safety section for further details. 
In the phase 3a trials, patients with unacceptable hyperglycaemia were to be offered treatment 
intensification (rescue medication) in addition to randomised treatment, at the discretion of the 
investigator in accordance with ADA/EASD guidance. In the CVOT, patients were on a background of 
standard-of-care, and thus no rescue criteria were defined. Among the treatment completers in phase 
3a trials (excl. CVOT), the proportion of patients initiating rescue medication was generally lower with 
semaglutide (0.0−5.4%) than with comparators (1.4−20.2%).

Study identifier: NCT02054897. See Trial 3623 report body (M 5.3.5.1) 
This was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multinational, 
multicentre, four-armed trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide as 
monotherapy in adult subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Male and female subjects diagnosed 
with T2D and treated with diet and exercise for at least 30 days before screening were 
included in the trial. Following a 2-week screening period, eligible subjects were randomised 
2:2:1:1 to treatment with either semaglutide 0.5 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg, semaglutide placebo 
0.5 mg or semaglutide placebo 1.0 mg (hereafter referred to as placebo) once weekly for 
30 weeks. After randomisation, subjects randomised to semaglutide treatment followed a fixed 
dose-escalation regimen to reach the 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg maintenance dose, which subsequently 
was not to be changed. If necessary for safety reasons suspected to be due to trial product, 
treatment could be discontinued and in such cases treatment should not be re-initiated, except 
in cases where suspicion of acute pancreatitis was ruled out. Subjects had a final follow-up 
visit 5 weeks after the last treatment visit. The placebo groups were pooled in the analysis.

Primary Analysis 
Analyses of efficacy endpoints were based on the full analysis set (FAS). The FAS included all 
randomised subjects who had received at least one dose of randomised semaglutide or placebo 
and contributed to the evaluation based on their randomised treatment. The primary observation 
period for examination of efficacy endpoints was ‘On-treatment without rescue medication’.

semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg once-weekly versus sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily in 
subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who had not achieved adequate glycaemic control on 
metformin, thiazolidinedione (TZD) or a combination of metformin/TZD. Male and female 
subjects diagnosed with T2D were included in the trial. 
Following a 2-week screening period, eligible subjects were randomised 2:2:1:1 to one of 
four treatment groups: semaglutide 0.5 mg once-weekly + sitagliptin placebo once-daily; 
semaglutide 1.0 mg once-weekly + sitagliptin placebo once-daily; sitagliptin 100 mg once-
daily + semaglutide placebo 1.0 mg once-weekly; sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily + 
semaglutide placebo 0.5 mg once-weekly. After randomisation, subjects randomised to 
semaglutide treatment followed a fixed dose-escalation regimen to reach the 0.5 mg or 
1.0 mg maintenance dose, which subsequently was not to be changed. If necessary for 
safety reasons suspected to be due to trial product, treatment could be discontinued; in such 
cases treatment was not to be re-initiated. Treatment continued for 56 weeks. Subjects had

Analyses of efficacy endpoints were based on the full analysis set (FAS). The FAS included all 
randomised subjects who had received at least one dose of randomised semaglutide or sitagliptin 
and had any post-randomisation data. The primary observation period for examination of 
efficacy endpoints was ‘On-treatment without rescue medication’.

Following a 2-week screening period, eligible subjects were randomised 1:1 to treatment 
with once-weekly subcutaneous injections with either semaglutide 1.0 mg or exenatide ER 
2.0 mg for 56 weeks. After randomisation, subjects randomised to semaglutide treatment 
followed a fixed dose-escalation regimen to reach the 1.0 mg maintenance dose, which 
subsequently was not to be changed. Subjects randomised to treatment with exenatide ER 
were to be treated with the 2.0 mg throughout the entire trial. If necessary for safety 
reasons suspected to be due to trial product, treatment could be discontinued; in such cases 
treatment was not to be re-initiated. Subjects had a final follow-up visit 5 weeks after the 
last treatment visit.

Study identifier: NCT02128932. See Trial 3625 report body (M 5.3.5.1) 
This was a 30-week randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, 
multinational, three-armed trial comparing two doses of semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) 
once-weekly versus insulin glargine once-daily. Male and female subjects diagnosed with 
type 2 diabetes (T2D) were included in the trial. 
Following a 2-week screening period, eligible subjects were randomised 1:1:1 to treatment 
with either once-weekly subcutaneous injections of either semaglutide 0.5 mg or 
semaglutide 1.0 mg or insulin glargine once daily for 30 weeks. After randomisation, 
subjects randomised to semaglutide treatment followed a fixed dose-escalation regimen to 
reach the 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg maintenance dose, which subsequently was not to be changed. 
Subjects on insulin glargine started on 10 IU subcutaneous injected once daily at the same 
time every day. The insulin dose was to be titrated by the investigator based on the lowest 
value of the subject’s fasting 1 point profile self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) levels 3 
days prior to both visits and phone contacts. Insulin glargine could be titrated between 
visits at the investigator’s discretion. If necessary for safety reasons suspected to be due to 
trial product, treatment could be discontinued; in such cases treatment was not to be re-
initiated. Subjects had a final follow-up visit 5 weeks after the last treatment visit.

This was a multinational, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-
controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide as add-on to 
basal insulin in adult subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Male and female subjects 
diagnosed with T2D inadequately controlled with basal insulin alone or in combination 
with metformin were included in the trial. Following a 2-week screening period, eligible 
subjects were randomised in a 2:2:1:1 manner to receive either semaglutide 0.5 mg, 
semaglutide 1.0 mg, semaglutide placebo 0.5 mg or semaglutide placebo 1.0 mg (hereafter 
referred to as placebo) once weekly for 30 weeks as add-on to the pre-trial background 
medication. The randomisation was stratified according to glycosylated haemoglobin 
(HbA1c) level at screening (≤8.0% or >8.0%) and use of metformin (yes or no). After 
randomisation, subjects randomised to semaglutide treatment followed a fixed dose-
escalation regimen to reach the 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg maintenance dose, which subsequently 
was not to be changed. If necessary for safety reasons suspected to be due to trial product, 
treatment could be discontinued; in such cases treatment was not to be re-initiated. Subjects 
had a final follow-up visit 5 weeks after the last treatment visit. The placebo groups were 
pooled in the analysis.

Primary objective: To demonstrate superiority of once-weekly dosing of two dose levels 
(0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) of semaglutide versus placebo on glycaemic control in subjects with 
T2D on basal insulin. 
Secondary objective: To compare the effect of once-weekly dosing of two dose levels of 
semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) versus placebo in subjects with T2D on basal insulin with 
regards to:

This was a 56-week, randomised, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-
centre, single-country trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide 
in monotherapy or in combination with one OAD in Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes 
(T2D). Male or female subjects ≥20 years old diagnosed with T2D and being treated with 
OAD monotherapy in addition to diet and exercise therapy or diet and exercise therapy 
alone, were included in the trial. Following a 2-week screening period, eligible subjects 
were randomised 2:2:1 to treatment with either semaglutide 0.5 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg 
(both once weekly) or one additional OAD for 56 weeks. After randomisation, subjects 
randomised to semaglutide treatment followed a fixed dose-escalation regimen to reach the 
0.5 mg or 1.0 mg maintenance dose, which subsequently was not to be changed. If 
necessary for safety reasons suspected to be due to trial product, treatment could be 
discontinued; in such cases treatment was not to be re-initiated. 
The type and dosage of the additional OAD was to be selected by the investigator 
according to the approved Japanese labelling including drug combinations and 
contraindications. One choice of DPP-4 inhibitor, sulphonylurea (SU), glinide, biguanide, 
alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (α-GI) or thioazolidinediones (TZD) would be selected as the 
additional OAD. For the subjects treated with OAD monotherapy as pre-trial treatment, the 
type and dosage of the additional OAD with a different mechanism of action from the pre-
trial OAD was to be chosen. The dose of the additional OAD would be optimised within 
approved Japanese labelling until week 8; thereafter the dose had to remain unchanged 
unless rescue medication was needed. The type of the additional OAD was not to be 
changed during the trial. Subjects had a final follow-up visit 5 weeks after the last 
treatment visit.

Title: SUSTAIN 6- Long Term Outcomes: A long-term, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multinational, multi-centre trial to evaluate cardiovascular and other long-term outcomes with semaglutide in 
subjects with type 2 diabetes. 
Study identifier 
Design 
Protocol number: NN9535-3744; EudraCT number: 2012-002839-28 
Study identifier: NCT01720446. See Trial 3744 report body (M 5.3.5.1) 
This trial was a long-term, multi-centre, multi-national, randomised, double-blind, parallel-
group, controlled trial performed to establish the cardiovascular (CV) safety and long term 
outcomes of semaglutide compared to placebo, when added to standard-of-care, in men and 
women with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at high risk of CV events. Following a 2 week screening 
period, eligible subjects were randomised 1:1:1:1 to either semaglutide 0.5 mg, semaglutide 
1.0 mg or volume-matched placebo once-weekly, a treatment period of 104 weeks and a post-
treatment follow-up period of 5 weeks. After randomisation, subjects randomised to 
semaglutide treatment followed a fixed dose-escalation regimen to reach the 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg 
maintenance dose, which subsequently was not to be changed. 
The trial duration was partly event-driven and was to be terminated when the projected 
number of subjects with 3-component event adjudication committee (EAC) confirmed major 
adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) was at least 122, and at the earliest 104 weeks after the 
last subject had been randomised. Due to a higher actual accrual rate of EAC-confirmed 
MACE than anticipated, the projected number of MACE was reached earlier than predicted. 
Therefore, each subject was treated for 104 weeks with a post-treatment follow-up period of 
5 weeks, resulting in a planned trial duration of 109 weeks per subject. 
Randomisation was stratified to ensure even distribution within strata according to the 
following 3 stratification variables: evidence of CV disease at baseline (clinical or subclinical), 
insulin treatment at baseline (none, basal insulin or pre-mixed insulin), renal impairment with 
globular filtration rate value <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline (presence or absence). 
By trial design, subjects with severe renal impairment always fall into the “clinical evidence of 
CV disease” stratum. This resulted in a total of 9 strata.

Primary objective: To confirm that treatment with semaglutide does not result in an 
unacceptable increase in cardiovascular risk as compared to placebo in adults with T2D. This 
is done by demonstrating that the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI of the hazard ratio for 
semaglutide versus placebo is less than 1.8 when comparing time to first occurrence of a 
MACE. 
Secondary objective: To assess the long-term safety and efficacy of semaglutide 0.5 mg and 
1.0 mg once weekly compared to placebo, both added on to standard-of-care, in adults with 
T2D at high risk of cardiovascular events. 
Semaglutide 0.5 mg 
826 subjects were randomised to the semaglutide 0.5 mg group.  
Semaglutide 1.0 mg 
Placebo  
822 subjects were randomised to the semaglutide 1.0 mg group. 
1649 subjects were randomised to the placebo group.

Analysed using a stratified Cox proportional 
hazards model with treatment group (pooled 
semaglutide, pooled placebo) as fixed factor. The 
model was stratified by all possible combinations 
of the 3 stratification factors used in the 
randomisation procedure (in total 9 levels). From 
this model the hazard ratio (HR; 
semaglutide/placebo) together with the 2-sided 
95% CI were estimated. MACEs occurring after a 
subject’s first EAC-confirmed MACE did not 
contribute to the Cox analysis. The analysis was 
considered confirmatory. 
Analysed using a mixed model for repeated 
measurement (MMRM); all post-baseline 
measurements obtained at scheduled visits were 
included as dependent variables. Treatment group 
(3 levels: semaglutide 0.5 mg, semaglutide 
1.0 mg, pooled placebo) and stratification 
(9 levels) were included as fixed factors and 
baseline value as covariate, all nested within visit. 
Superiority was concluded if the upper limit of 
the two-sided 95% CI for the estimated difference 
in change in body weight between 
semaglutide and placebo was less than 0 kg. 
Analysed using a MMRM similar to the model 
used for analysis of change in body weight but 
with HbA1c at baseline as covariate. The model 
included interaction between treatment group and 
the relevant subgroup (2 levels for SU 
monotherapy subgroup analysis, 3 levels for 
insulin subgroup analysis). An unstructured 
covariance matrix was assumed for 
measurements within the same subject. 
Superiority was concluded if the upper limit of 
the two-sided 95% CI for the estimated difference 
in HbA1c at week 30 between semaglutide and 
placebo was less than 0%.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
HbA1c 
For all eight phase 3a trials, treatment with semaglutide 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg resulted in marked, 
sustained improvements in glycaemic control, as shown by a reduction in HbA1c, beginning after 4 
weeks of treatment and reaching nadir after 16−30 weeks. The reduction was maintained after long-
term treatment of up to 104 weeks (in the CVOT) (Figure 14). The effect appeared to be dose-
dependent. The estimated mean plots for HbA1c change from baseline are presented in Figure 14. The 
estimated change from baseline in HbA1c at end-of-treatment is shown in Figure 16, for HbA1c levels at 
end-of-treatment. Both doses of semaglutide resulted in significantly larger reductions in HbA1c than 
comparators: placebo, sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin glargine, and improvements in glycaemic 
control with semaglutide were seen for all treatment regimens investigated: monotherapy and 
combination therapy with metformin +/- other OADs or insulin +/- metformin.

Fasting plasma glucose 
Mean change in FPG levels from baseline to end-of-treatment was investigated in all phase 3a trials. 
At baseline, observed levels of FPG were comparable across all trials. In general, FPG levels decreased 
progressively through week 12, after which the response stabilised or changed moderately (i.e. either 
a moderate decrease or a moderate increase) through the remaining treatment period (Figure 17 ).

Body weight 
For all eight phase 3a trials, treatment with semaglutide 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg resulted in marked, 
sustained improvements in body weight, reaching nadir after approximately 30 weeks. The reduction 
was maintained after long-term treatment of up to 104 weeks (in the CVOT) (Figure 18 ). The effect 
appeared to be dose-dependent (Figure 18 .

Blood pressure 
In general, systolic blood pressure decreased progressively during the first 23-30 weeks of semaglutide 
treatment, after which the levels stabilised through the remaining treatment period. Overall, systolic 
blood pressure decreased more with semaglutide 1.0 mg vs 0.5 mg vs comparators at end-of-
treatment (Figure 19 ). In general, diastolic blood pressure also appeared to decrease over time 
(Figure 19 ). Overall, apparent reductions in diastolic blood pressure were seen with semaglutide but 
also with the comparators at end-of-treatment.

phase 3a trials 
Intensification of anti-glycaemic therapy 
In the CVOT, glucose-lowering medications (except treatments affecting the incretin pathway such as 
other GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors or pramlintide) were to be added to the anti-glycaemic regimen 
during the entire course of the trial to achieve and maintain optimal glycaemic control according to 
local standards. The long-term effect of semaglutide on HbA1c was demonstrated by analyses of 
initiation of glucose-lowering medication during the CVOT showing that half as many patients treated 
with semaglutide (0.5 mg: 21%; 1.0 mg: 19 %) than with placebo (0.5 mg: 42%; 1.0 mg: 39%) 
required additional glucose-lowering medication (Figure 20). The findings from the CVOT are supported 
by data from the phase 3a trials. Less patients completed treatment with added rescue medication in 
the semaglutide group (0.0−5.4%) than in the placebo group (14.3−20.2%) or active comparator 
group (1.4−19.7%).

Patient-reported outcomes 
For trials 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627, diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire (DTSQ) and short 
form (36) health survey (SF-36) scores were investigated at end-of-treatment. For the CVOT, only SF-
36 scores were investigated, also at end-of-treatment. Of note, trial 3626 vs Sita (as add-on to OADs) 
had a double dummy design, subjects were thus treated both with an injection and with an oral 
formulation, and this could affect the results of the comparison of the two treatments. For trial 3624 vs 
Exe ER (as add-on to OADs), the device used for exenatide injection was not the same as the current 
marketed product, and this could affect the relevance of the results to the currently marketed product. 
Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) 
At baseline, the three main DTSQ components; treatment satisfaction, perception of hyperglycaemia 
and perception of hypoglycaemia were similar across treatment groups both within and across trials, 
albeit treatment satisfaction was slightly higher at baseline in trial 3627 vs Placebo (Insulin) for all 
three treatment groups. 
For all trials investigating DTSQ, both doses of semaglutide significantly improved the summary score 
of treatment satisfaction (Figure 21) and significantly lowered the perceived frequency of 
hyperglycaemia compared to placebo and active comparators; sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin 
glargine. There was no difference in the perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia with semaglutide vs 
comparators.

Note: Sita: Sitagliptin, Exe ER: Exenatide Extended Release, IGlar: Insulin Glargine, OAD: Oral anti-diabetic drug, 
On-treatment without rescue medication data are presented. Estimated change from baseline data are shown. 
Estimates are from the mixed model for repeated measurements with treatment, trial-specific stratification, and 
country as fixed factors and baseline Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) scores as covariate, all 
nested within visit, and adjusted according to observed baseline distribution. 
When patients were able to distinguish between treatments (trial 3625), once-weekly semaglutide (0.5 
and 1.0 mg) improved treatment satisfaction to a greater extent than once-daily insulin glargine 
(semaglutide 1.0 mg vs insulin glargine). In addition, once-weekly semaglutide injections were 
evaluated to be more convenient and flexible than the once-daily insulin glargine regimen. 
SF-36 
Semaglutide (0.5 and 1.0 mg) provided significantly greater improvements in general health status, as 
assessed by the Short Form health survey (SF-36 version 2), than placebo in the CVOT in addition to 
standard-of-care. 
Greater improvements with semaglutide 1.0 mg were demonstrated versus placebo across all 
components including both mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary 
(PCS) scores (Figure 22).

Cardiovascular risk 
Cardiovascular outcomes in the CVOT 
The primary endpoint in trial 3744 was the time from randomisation to the first occurrence of a 3-
composite MACE (defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or cardiovascular death). 
The primary endpoint was pre-defined as a safety endpoint. 
For the primary endpoint of time to first EAC-confirmed MACE, the primary pre-specified hypothesis 
that semaglutide would be non-inferior to placebo was confirmed, with the upper bound of the 95% CI 
being below 1.8 with associated p-value <0.0001. Semaglutide-treated subjects had a significantly 
lower risk of the primary MACE outcome than those receiving placebo (HR: 0.74 [0.58; 0.95]95%CI, 
p=0.0167) corresponding to a 26% relative risk reduction (Figure 23 ). 
The CVOT was not intended to conclusively demonstrate cardiovascular safety nor benefits in favour of 
semaglutide. Thus, a non-inferiority hypothesis with a margin of 1.3 followed by a test for superiority 
was not part of the pre-specified statistical testing strategy in the protocol. Nevertheless, evidence for 
cardiovascular risk reduction emerged from the trial. Events had onset throughout the entire 
observation period, with no clustering of events over time, assessed from time of randomisation. The

semaglutide and placebo curves separated around week 16 and the lines continued to separate 
throughout the trial, suggestive of a constant treatment effect, as seen from the Kaplan-Meier plot for 
time to first MACE (Figure 23 ). 
Figure 23 Plot of time to first EAC-confirmed MACE, semaglutide vs placebo – CVOT 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the cumulative risk of MACE at week 104 was 6.2% with semaglutide 
and 8.4% with placebo, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of 2.2%, meaning that 45 subjects 
would need to be treated with semaglutide to prevent one subject experiencing MACE during the 
104-week treatment period. 
Clinically relevant risk reductions were observed for both doses of semaglutide compared with their 
individual placebo groups with an apparent larger risk reduction with semaglutide 1.0 mg (HR: 
0.71 [0.49 ; 1.02]95%CI) compared with semaglutide 0.5 mg (HR: 0.77 [0.55 ; 1.08]95%CI). 
Importantly, the analyses within the semaglutide dose groups were independent of each other, as each 
semaglutide dose was compared with its volume-matched placebo group. 
Post-hoc, the p-value was calculated for superiority on the primary MACE endpoint without a statistical 
penalty for multiple testing. 
For the 3-component MACE, the individual components of events of non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke 
appeared lower with semaglutide compared with placebo, while occurrence of events of CV death 
appeared similar with semaglutide and placebo (Figure 24).

As a broader definition of MACE may be more sensitive to detect CV effects, a secondary endpoint in 
the CVOT addressed the time from randomisation to first occurrence of an expanded composite CV 
outcome, defined as MACE, revascularisation (coronary and peripheral), unstable angina requiring 
hospitalisation, or hospitalisation for heart failure. 
The proportion of subjects that experienced an expanded MACE was lower with semaglutide (199 
subjects, 12.1%) than with placebo (264 subjects, 16.0%). The hazard ratio for the expanded 
composite CV outcome (0.74 [0.62 ; 0.89]95% CI) was identical to that of the 3-component MACE. 
The individual components; events of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, revascularisation, and unstable 
angina requiring hospitalisation all contributed to the favourable treatment effect of semaglutide with 
hazard ratios below 1. However, Hospitalisation for heart failure and all cause of death had a hazard 
ratio above 1 (Figure 25).

Cardiovascular outcomes in phase 3a trials excluding the CVOT 
The number of subjects with MACEs across the seven phase 3a trials were similar across the treatment 
groups (semaglutide 0.5 mg: 8 subjects [0.6%], semaglutide 1.0 mg: 5 subjects [0.3%], all 
comparators: 8 subjects [0.5%]). 
Subgroup analyses-effects on HbA1c 
The extent to which the exposure of semaglutide was affected by sex, age, race, ethnicity, body weight 
and renal function was evaluated in a population PK analysis. The analysis included data from five of 
the phase 3a trials (trials 3623, 3624, 3626, 4091 and 3744). Semaglutide exposure was only affected 
by body weight showing higher semaglutide exposure in subjects with a lower body weight. 
In the clinical studies, the efficacy response to semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) was in general 
consistent across sub-populations. In a few of the subgroup analyses, there were some inconsistencies 
in the analyses between groups. However, the overall pattern suggested that these differences 
occurred by chance. 
The overall HbA1c response to semaglutide is considered similar for men and women. 
The number of subjects ≥75 years of age at baseline was ≥74 subjects for each of the four treatment 
groups in the CVOT and <20 for each treatment group in all other trials. The estimated HbA1c 
treatment differences for semaglutide vs comparator were generally comparable across the different 
age subgroups in all trials. 
For all trials but the two Japanese trials, the majority of subjects identified themselves as White 
(64−84%), while Blacks or African-Americans (5−9%) and Asians (2−25% excluding the Japanese 
trials where all subjects were Asians) were represented to a lesser degree. All race subgroups 
Assessment report

responded equally well to treatment with semaglutide. The Hispanic or Latino population was 
represented by 12−30% across the key efficacy trials and the CVOT. Overall, the HbA1c response with 
semaglutide treatment across the six trials was considered comparable for the two ethnicity 
subgroups. In addition, the estimated HbA1c treatment differences for semaglutide vs comparator were 
similar for the different subgroups of region across the key efficacy trials and the CVOT. 
Overall, the HbA1c response with semaglutide treatment was not affected by diabetes duration and 
body weight at baseline. 
For all trials but the CVOT, the proportion of subjects with normal renal function and mild renal 
impairment ranged from 50.8−68.7% and 29.3−40.4%, respectively, while moderate renal 
impairment was seen for <9% of subjects. For the CVOT, the proportion of subjects with normal renal 
function, mild renal impairment and moderate renal impairment were comparable, while severe renal 
impairment and end-stage renal disease represented <4% of subjects. The patterns across trials were 
not consistent with dose nor did it correlate with the degree of renal impairment. The semaglutide 
treatment effect is therefore considered of a comparable magnitude across all subgroups of renal 
function. 
While a larger HbA1c reduction was seen for subjects on metformin+SU at baseline compared with 
subjects on metformin alone at baseline in trial 3624, both subgroups showed HbA1c reductions above 
1.3 %−points. In the CVOT, for subjects on SU monotherapy at baseline, estimated treatment 
differences of −1.74 %−points [−2.28; −1.19]95%CI and −1.64 %−points [−2.16; −1.12]95%CI were 
obtained with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, respectively, compared with pooled placebo. For 
subjects on premix insulin at baseline, estimated treatment differences of −0.86 %−points [−1.06; 
−0.66]95%CI and −1.37 %−points [−1.57; −1.17]95%CI were obtained with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 
1.0 mg, respectively, compared with pooled placebo. Thus, relevant treatment effects were seen 
across subgroups of background diabetes medication, and the treatment effects appeared consistent 
across trials. 
Subgroup analyses-effects on cardiovascular risk 
The results of most pre-specified subgroup analyses were consistent with the results of the primary 
analysis of time to first EAC-confirmed MACE. There were no differences between subgroups of sex, 
age, race, ethnicity, region, HbA1c at baseline, duration of diabetes, evidence of CV disease, renal 
impairment and BMI at baseline. Although not statistically significant, treatment effects were absent 
for patients with chronic heart failure class II-III and insulin treatment at baseline (p for interaction 
0.09 and 0.12, respectively) (Figure 26 ).

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The 5 key efficacy trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide as mono- and combination 
therapy (primarily combinations with metformin, SU and/or insulin). In addition, semaglutide was 
compared with insulin glargine, a DPP-4 inhibitor and another long acting GLP-1 receptor agonist. The 
studies were performed in line with the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the 
treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus. A comparison to SU was not performed. SU is considered 
the next step after metformin by many guidelines and doctors. No trials with combination therapy with 
DPP-4-inhibitors or SGLT-2-inhibitors have been carried out. A combination with a DPP4-inhibitor is not 
rational, as the mechanisms of action of both products is similar. For semaglutide, specific 
combinations that are studied are mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC. As no interactions are 
expected between semaglutide and SGLT2-inhibitors, it is agreed that the current text in the SmPC is 
sufficient.

Two phase 3a trials evaluated semaglutide for treatment of T2D in Japanese subjects (trials 4092 and 
4091). While safety was the primary endpoint for the Japanese trials, they were designed and 
conducted in a similar manner to the key efficacy trials. 
The last phase 3a trial was a 104−week cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT, trial 3744) in a T2D 
population at high risk of CV events that investigated the effect of semaglutide on CV events as well as 
long-term safety and efficacy. The inclusion of individuals with a high cardiovascular risk in the CVOT 
may limit generalizability to the general diabetic population. Data suggest that semaglutide has effects 
on atherosclerosis, and effects on MACE might be largely obtained by affecting this process. In 
addition, other CV risk factors are also reduced, like HbA1c, body weight, blood lipids and blood 
pressure. However, whether this results in a reduction in MACE in subjects with less atherosclerosis 
and a lower CV risk is still unclear. In CVOT a number of subjects were included with risk factors 
“only”. In these subjects, no effect on MACE was seen, but the numbers were too small to draw firm 
conclusions (10 events with semaglutide and 9 events with placebo). 
Semaglutide was investigated at two dose levels (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) in most phase 3a trials (dose 
selection is discussed in the end of the present section). 
Trial duration is similar to that used in other registration studies and according to current EMA 
Guidelines. For semaglutide, the results of a CVOT are included in this application. We consider these 
data very important. However, the duration of 2 years is relatively short in comparison to several other 
cardiovascular outcome trials and also for a drug that is intended for long term diabetes treatment. 
The statistical analysis of the key efficacy trials and the CVOT are similar to those used in other 
antidiabetic programs and according to current EMA Guidelines. The primary estimand of the key 
efficacy trials was the difference in effect as if all subjects were treated. The primary analysis, using 
MMRM, corresponds to this estimand and is acceptable. However, the primary analysis sets all data 
after rescue medication or treatment withdrawal to missing and assumes this will be missing at 
random (MAR). Therefore, sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the primary 
outcome and the assumption of MAR: using all in trial data, comparator-based multiple imputation 
analysis, a complete case, LOCF and per protocol analyses. The primary endpoint in the CVOT, time to 
MACE, was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified for the factors used in 
randomisation. Multiplicity was handled using a pre-specified hierarchical testing schemes. Of note, 
superiority on time to MACE was not included in the predefined testing hierarchy. It is agreed with the 
Applicant that a test for MACE superiority could have been done without adjustment for multiplicity. 
However, the problem is that it was not predefined in the protocol as part of the hierarchical testing 
scheme. The superiority test for MACE was performed as one of a range of post-hoc tests. This means 
that the Applicant had the chance to choose any statistically significant test from the post-hoc 
analyses, which will lead to inflation of the type I error. A claim of superiority is not mentioned in the 
SmPC, the issue was not further pursued.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Pivotal efficacy trials 
In trial 3623 in drug naïve T2D subjects, semaglutide was associated with a clinically relevant decrease 
in HbA1c after 30 weeks (semaglutide 0.5 mg -1.43%; semaglutide 1.0 mg -1.53%) compared to 
placebo. In addition, there were changes in body weight (semaglutide 0.5 mg -2.75 kg; semaglutide 
1.0 mg -3.56 kg).

In trial 3626 was performed in T2D subjects who had not achieved adequate glycaemic control on 
metformin, TZD or a combination of metformin/TZD. Compared to sitagliptin, semaglutide was 
associated with a clinically relevant decrease in HbA1c after 56 weeks (semaglutide 0.5 mg -0.77%; 
semaglutide 1.0 mg -1.06%). In addition, compared to sitagliptin, semaglutide was associated with a 
decrease in body weight (semaglutide 0.5 mg -2.35 kg; semaglutide 1.0 mg -4.20 kg). However, only 
5.4% (N=43) of the patients was using a TZD as background medication in combination with 
semaglutide, and further in 68 subjects in one of the Japanese trials. Based on these limited numbers, 
no difference with other semaglutide combinations were observed in reducing HbA1c. Section 5.1 
mentions the limited number of subjects on combination treatment with TZD, which is considered 
adequate.  
In trial 3624, compared to exenatide ER, semaglutide 1.0 mg was associated with a clinically relevant 
decrease in HbA1c after 56 weeks of -0.62%. In addition, compared to exenatide ER, semaglutide 1.0 
mg was associated with a clinically relevant decrease in body weight after 56 weeks of -3.78 kg. Use of 
metformin monotherapy ± SU was reported by the majority of the subjects. SU monotherapy, insulin 
+/- OADs and other background diabetes medication was reported by only a few patients (2.7%, 0.1% 
and 2.7% of the subjects, respectively). There were more premature treatment discontinuations due to 
gastrointestinal adverse events with semaglutide than with exenatide. 
In trial 3625, compared to insulin glargine, semaglutide was associated with a clinically relevant 
decrease in HbA1c after 30 weeks (semaglutide 0.5 mg -0.38%; semaglutide 1.0 mg 0.81%). Rescue 
medication was used in 28 (2.58%) of the patients. Compared with patients treated with insulin 
glargine (5 [1.4%]), notably more patients treated with semaglutide 0.5 mg (14 [3.9%]) and with 
semaglutide 1.0 mg (9 [2.5%]) were treated with rescue medication. This might be explained by the 
fact that 92.5% of the patients in the insulin glargine treatment group increased the insulin glargine 
dose which was not accounted as Rescue medication (at week 30 mean insulin glargine dose was 29.2 
IU with a maximum up to 112 IU). In addition, compared to insulin glargine, semaglutide was 
associated with a clinically relevant decrease in body weight after 30 weeks (semaglutide 0.5 mg -4.62 
kg; semaglutide 1.0 mg -6.33 kg). Use of metformin ± SU was reported by almost all patients. Only 
0.2% and 0.2% of the subjects reported use of SU monotherapy and other background diabetes 
medication, respectively. Premature treatment discontinuation was clearly higher with semaglutide 
compared to insulin glargine. This was due to a higher number of gastrointestinal adverse events, 
protocol violations and other adverse events with semaglutide. 
In trial 3627 in subjects with T2D on basal insulin, semaglutide was associated with a clinically relevant 
decrease in HbA1c after 30 weeks (semaglutide 0.5 mg -1.35%; semaglutide 1.0 mg -1.75%) 
compared to placebo. In addition, compared to placebo, semaglutide was associated with a clinically 
relevant decrease in body weight after 30 weeks (semaglutide 0.5 mg -2.31 kg; semaglutide 1.0 mg -
5.06 kg). From a mean baseline insulin dose of 37.74 IU across the 3 groups, significant reductions of 
insulin doses of 6% and 12% were seen at week 30 with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, respectively, 
when compared to placebo. There was a higher number of gastrointestinal adverse events and other 
adverse events with semaglutide. All patients were using insulin with or without OADs. 
In trial 3744 (cardiovascular outcome trial, COVT), the primary objective was to confirm that treatment 
with semaglutide does not result in an unacceptable increase in CV risk compared to placebo in T2D 
subjects. The secondary objectives were to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of semaglutide 0.5 
mg and 1.0 mg once-weekly compared to placebo, both added on to standard-of-care, in T2D subjects 
at high risk of CV events. This was a long-term, double-blind, trial in subjects with T2D at high risk of 
CV events. A total of 3297 subjects were randomised. There was a higher number of premature

treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal adverse events with semaglutide 1.0 mg (9.4%) and 
semaglutide 0.5 mg (5.7%) compared to placebo (1.1%). 
The trial reached its primary objective and demonstrated non-inferiority of semaglutide versus placebo 
in terms of MACE. The composite primary outcome occurred in 108 of 1648 patients (6.6%) in the 
semaglutide group and 146 of 1649 (8.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95; P<0.001 for non-inferiority. Superiority was tested post hoc without a 
statistical penalty for multiple testing. This has been discussed elsewhere. 
For MACE subcomponents, events of non-fatal MI (HR: 0.74 [0.51; 1.08]95%CI, p=0.1194) and non-
fatal stroke (HR: 0.61 [0.38; 0.99]95% CI, p=0.0438) contributed to the overall favourable treatment 
effect of semaglutide on MACE. However, occurrence of CV death was similar with semaglutide and 
placebo (HR: 0.98 [0.65; 1.48]95%CI, p-value: 0.9181). This is rather unexpected. Based on 
biological plausibility it may be anticipated that treatment will beneficially influence all components in a 
similar way. Although the three individual components of the composite endpoint are clinically 
meaningful, CV death may be considered more relevant than non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. In 
response, the Applicant reasons that duration of the trial may have been too short for showing positive 
effects on CV-death. Similarly heterogeneous results have been observed for statins and PSK9-
inhibitor. The explanation is considered acceptable. 
The difference in MACE is primarily driven by a difference in the frequency of strokes. However, there 
was a baseline difference in prior stroke favouring semaglutide (Table 5). Number of subjects with 
prior stroke and an event were small, however, and confidence intervals were wide. Therefore, no firm 
conclusion can be drawn. The analyses adjusted by prior stroke were consistent with the primary MACE 
analysis. It is unlikely that the small difference in distribution at baseline has affected the outcome of 
the CV trial in a relevant way. The proportion of subjects that experienced an expanded MACE (3-point 
MACE plus revascularisation (coronary and peripheral), unstable angina requiring hospitalisation, or 
hospitalisation for heart failure) was lower with semaglutide (199 subjects, 12.1%) than with placebo 
(264 subjects, 16.0%). The hazard ratio for the expanded composite CV outcome (0.74 [0.62 ; 
0.89]95% CI) was identical to that of the 3-component MACE. The individual components, events of 
non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, revascularisation, and unstable angina requiring hospitalisation, all 
contributed to the favourable treatment effect of semaglutide with hazard ratios below 1. However, 
hospitalisation for heart failure and all cause of death had a hazard ratio above 1. The Company 
reasons that heart failure is often due to non-atherosclerotic mechanisms, while semaglutide most 
probably affects atherosclerosis. Furthermore, numbers are too small for a firm conclusion. Numbers of 
all-cause death were similar for semaglutide and placebo (62 vs 60 events), mostly due to CV-death 
(44 vs 46 events). Numbers of non-CV death were small (18 vs 14). Results do not indicate that 
semaglutide has a beneficial or negative effect neither on CV-death nor on non-CV death. 
The results of most pre-specified subgroup analyses were consistent with the results of the primary 
analysis of time to first EAC-confirmed MACE. However, several interactions between treatment effect 
and subgroups on time to first MACE may be identified. Treatment effects were absent for patients 
with chronic heart failure class II-III and lower for patients using insulin treatment at baseline (p for 
interaction 0.09 and 0.12, respectively). The Applicant reasons that effects on HbA1c, body weight and 
systolic blood pressure were seen in subjects with chronic heart failure class II-III and in subjects 
using insulin at baseline, suggesting that semaglutide is effective in these patients, and thus might be 
beneficial on MACE. Of note, conclusions drawn from subgroup analyses should be performed 
cautiously when subgroups are small, and in the statistical subgroup interaction test, the treatment 
differences were not statistically significant. At week 104, the mean glycated haemoglobin level in the 
semaglutide group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.7% points lower in the group receiving 
Assessment report

0.5 mg and 1.0% point lower in the group receiving 1.0 mg (estimated treatment difference) (p<0.001 
for both comparisons). During the trial, significantly more patients in the placebo group than in the 
semaglutide group received additional antihyperglycaemic agents (including insulin) which were 
initiated approximately twice as frequently in the placebo group. 
At week 104, the mean body weight in the semaglutide group, as compared with the placebo group, 
was 2.9 kg lower in the group receiving 0.5 mg and 4.3 kg lower in the group receiving 1.0 mg 
semaglutide (p<0.001 for both comparisons). In addition, mean systolic blood pressure in the 
semaglutide group, as compared with the placebo group, was 1.3 mm Hg lower in the group receiving 
0.5 mg (p=0.10) and 2.6 mm Hg lower in the group receiving 1.0 mg (p<0.001). Changes in diastolic 
blood pressure were similar across treatment groups. 
Supportive trials performed in Japanese patients 
Trials 4091 and 4092 were both conducted in Japan. These studies are only considered supportive 
because they were performed in Japanese individuals only and efficacy was not a primary endpoint. 
In trial 4092, the primary objective was to compare the safety of once-weekly dosing of semaglutide 
(0.5 and 1.0 mg) versus sitagliptin (100 mg) once daily, both as monotherapy during 30 weeks of 
treatment in Japanese T2D subjects. This was a randomised, open-label, active-controlled, 3-armed 
trial in subjects with T2D. There was a remarkably higher number of premature treatment 
discontinuation due to gastrointestinal adverse events with semaglutide 1.0 mg (9.8%) vs. 
semaglutide 0.5 mg (1%) and placebo (0%). 
Compared to sitagliptin, semaglutide was associated with a clinically relevant decrease in HbA1c after 
30 weeks (for semaglutide 0.5 mg -1.13%; for semaglutide 1.0 mg 1.44%). In addition, compared to 
placebo, semaglutide was associated with a clinically relevant decrease in body weight after 30 weeks 
(for semaglutide 0.5 mg -2.22 kg; for semaglutide 1.0 mg -3.88 kg). 
In trial 4091, the primary objective was to compare the safety of once-weekly dosing of semaglutide in 
monotherapy or in combination with 1 OAD (either of SU, glinide, alpha-GI or TZD) vs OAD therapy 
during 56 weeks of treatment in Japanese T2D subjects who were insufficiently controlled on 
diet/exercise therapy or OAD monotherapy (either of SU, glinide, alpha-GI or TZD. This was a 
randomised, open-label, active-controlled, 3-armed trial. Similar to trial 4092, there was a remarkably 
higher number of premature treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal adverse events with 
semaglutide 1.0 mg (7.5%) vs. semaglutide 0.5 mg (2.9%) and additional OAD (0%). It can be 
speculated that Asian/Japanese patients on average have a lower mean weight and thus a higher 
exposure as compared to American/European patients. Based on this assumption, it cannot be 
excluded that the frequency of GI AEs including nausea tends to be higher in the Asian region but in 
this case, it is however, due to differences in weight rather than race. Overall, it is considered 
sufficiently documented that the rates of GI AEs do not differ substantially between Asians and non-
Asians and it is considered justified not to include specific information regarding GI AEs in Asians in the 
SmPC. 
Compared to additional OAD, semaglutide was associated with a clinically relevant decrease in HbA1c 
after 56 weeks (for semaglutide 0.5 mg -1.08%; for semaglutide 1.0 mg 1.37%). In addition, 
compared to placebo, semaglutide was associated with a clinically relevant decrease in body weight 
after 56 weeks (for semaglutide 0.5 mg -1.84 kg; for semaglutide 1.0 mg -3.59 kg).

Analyses of results performed across trials 
Characteristics of the trial populations 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics of the trial populations studied were designed to be 
representative of the target population for treatment with semaglutide expected in the clinical practice, 
and were comparable across the treatment groups and across the phase 3a trials. 
The mean age was comparable across trials and ranged from 53.7−58.8 years. With regard to race, 
the majority of subjects across all trials were White (64−84%), except for the two Japanese trials in 
which all subjects were Asian. Excluding the two Japanese trials, the proportion of Black or African 
American subjects across trials was only 5−9%, while 2−25% of subjects were Asian. For ethnicity, 
the Hispanic or Latino population represented 12−30% of the subjects across all trials, excluding the 
two Japanese trials. 
Only 156 subjects of ≥75 years were included in the seven phase 3a trials (thus excluding the CVOT). 
As could be expected based on the inclusion criteria, the mean age (64.6 years) was higher for the 
CVOT population compared to the other seven phase 3a trials. A total of 321 subjects of ≥75 years 
were included in the CVOT. The mean diabetes duration (13.9 years) was longer and the mean 
baseline HbA1c (8.7%) was higher in the CVOT compared with the other seven phase 3a trials. The 
mean renal function for the trial population was lower (eGFR: 76.13 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared with 
the other phase 3a trials. Importantly, this was the only trial to include subjects (around 3%) with 
severe renal impairment, while moderate renal impairment accounted for 25% of subjects in the CVOT. 
HbA1c 
For all eight phase 3a trials, treatment with semaglutide 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg resulted in marked, 
sustained improvements in glycaemic control, as shown by a reduction in HbA1c, beginning already 
after 4 weeks of treatment and reaching nadir after 16−30 weeks. The reduction was maintained after 
long-term treatment of up to 104 weeks (in the CVOT). The magnitude of the reduction in HbA1c with 
semaglutide increased with increasing baseline HbA1c levels. In line with the reductions in HbA1c, the 
treatment target of an HbA1c <7% was reached for significantly more subjects with semaglutide 0.5 
mg (57−74%) and 1.0 mg (67−79%) vs placebo (11−25%) and active comparators (36−40%) in the 
key efficacy trials. 
Overall, 60-70% of patients in a European population have a response of a reduction of -1%-point in 
HbA1c. In all pivotal trials, the maximum effect of reduction in HbA1c was reached after 16 weeks’ 
treatment; thereafter the HbA1c level remained unchanged or increased a little.  
The effect of semaglutide on HbA1c and body weight were larger than those of exenatide o.w.. 
However, the effect of exenatide 2.0 mg o.w. on HbA1c (reduction of -0.92% from baseline) appears 
to be somewhat smaller than the effect seen in the DURATION (registration-)studies, which found a 
mean HbA1c reduction of 1.3%-point to 2.0%-point at Week 26-52. In addition, the effect of exenatide 
2.0 mg o.w. on body weight (reduction of -1.85 kg from baseline) appears to be somewhat smaller 
than the effect seen in the DURATION studies, which found a mean weight reduction of 2.0-4.1 kg at 
Week 26-52.

Body weight 
Semaglutide significantly reduced body weight in all eight phase 3 trials compared with placebo (both 
as monotherapy and in combination with insulin) or active comparators; sitagliptin, exenatide ER and 
insulin glargine. The reductions took place through the first 30 weeks of treatment, and the reduction 
in body weight was sustained through the entire treatment period of up to 104 weeks with reductions 
of up to 4.28 kg and 6.42 kg with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, respectively. 
Almost all patients (85-90%) had some degree of weight loss in the key efficacy trials. From the PD 
Trial 3685, is shown that 75% of the loss is body fat and 25% is lost from lean body mass. In the 
Japanese and CVOT studies approximately 80% had some degree of weight loss. Across trials, 
approximately 50% achieved a ≥5% weight loss and around 20% achieved a ≥10% weight loss for the 
high dose semaglutide. It is unknown if there are certain parameters that characterize patients with 
the greatest weight loss. In response, the Applicant presented results of the percentage of patients 
with ≥10% weight loss stratified on baseline BMI. In general, the group of patients with a BMI <25 
kg/m2 was small and therefore no firm conclusions can be made. Overall, it is agreed with the 
Applicant that there is no firm pattern indicating that patients with lower BMI have a more extensive 
weight loss. More patients treated with semaglutide 1.0 mg compared to semaglutide 0.5 mg 
experience a weight loss ≥10%; this is in accordance with the dose-dependent effect. 
Cardiovascular risk (excluding the cardiovascular outcome trial) 
The number of subjects with MACEs across the seven phase 3a trials (excluding the CVOT) were 
similar across the treatment groups (semaglutide 0.5 mg: 8 subjects [0.6%], semaglutide 1.0 mg: 5 
subjects [0.3%], all comparators: 8 subjects [0.5%]). 
Cardiovascular risk factors 
Overall, in the key efficacy trials, systolic blood pressure decreased more with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 
0.5 mg (ranging from -2.58 to -7.27 mmHg) vs comparators (ranging from -0.99 to -1.72 mmHg) at 
end-of-treatment. Likewise, diastolic blood pressure also decreased over time. Data for pulse rate 
across trials are evaluated and presented in the safety section. In several of trials, semaglutide 1.0 mg 
was associated with small improvements in blood lipids vs comparators. 
DTSQ 
For all trials investigating DTSQ, both doses of semaglutide significantly improved the summary score 
of treatment satisfaction and significantly lowered the perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia 
compared to placebo and active comparators; sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin glargine. There was 
no difference in the perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia with semaglutide vs comparators. 
Subgroup analyses 
In a population PK analysis, data from five phase 3a trials were included (trials 3623, 3626, 3624, 
4091 and 3744). Semaglutide exposure was only affected by body weight showing higher semaglutide 
exposure in subjects with a lower body weight. However, in the clinical trials, the semaglutide efficacy 
was considered consistent across subgroups of baseline body weight. 
The overall HbA1c response to semaglutide is considered similar for men and women. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 102/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Overall, the efficacy of semaglutide on HbA1c reduction was considered consistent across age groups. 
However, for subjects >75 years of age, the effects of semaglutide on HbA1c were lower in some trials 
but higher in others. These inconsistencies may be explained by the relatively small numbers of 
patients >75 years of age. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
The estimated HbA1c treatment differences for semaglutide vs comparator and the change from 
baseline in HbA1c with semaglutide treatment may be similar for the different race subgroups across 
all trials. However, for Asians and Blacks/African Americans, the effects of semaglutide on HbA1c were 
lower in some trials but higher in others. These inconsistencies may be explained by the relatively 
small numbers of patients in these race groups and for the Asian (Japanese) population, also due to 
the lower weight.  
Overall, subjects with mild and moderate impaired renal function had clinically relevant treatment 
effects, but the effect tended to be smaller compared with subjects with normal renal function. The 
number of individuals with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease was too small to draw 
conclusions as these patients were excluded from most trials. 
Overall, the HbA1c response across the different regions is considered comparable across trials. 
Although subjects on metformin+SU at baseline showed a larger treatment effect than subjects on 
metformin monotherapy at baseline, both groups showed relevant HbA1c reductions. Similarly, 
subjects on SU monotherapy at baseline showed somewhat larger treatment effects compared to 
subjects on premix insulin at baseline. However, superiority was shown of both doses of semaglutide 
for both types of background diabetes medication. On request, the Applicant has presented a subgroup 
analysis of background diabetes medication stratified on mono, dual and triple therapy. The effect of 
semaglutide appears to be independent of baseline antidiabetic treatment including type and number 
of antidiabetic products. 
In all trials, either no subjects or a relatively low number of subjects developed anti-semaglutide 
antibodies. The data did not indicate that formation of anti-semaglutide antibodies with or without 
GLP-1-cross-reacting properties hampered the HbA1c-lowering effect of semaglutide. 
Dose selection 
Based on the results from the dose-finding trial 1821 and the exposure response analysis from four 
phase 3a trials, the suggested lowest maintenance dose of semaglutide 0.5 mg is questionable. A 
lower maintenance dose of 0.4 mg shows at least 0.5 %−point reduction on HbA1c change from 
baseline and has probably a lower number of GI AEs (trial 1821) and is thus better tolerated. 
Therefore, semaglutide 0.4 mg may provide improved benefit/risk compared with 0.5 mg. Prior to 
initiating the phase 3a trials, the Applicant concluded that using maintenance doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg 
were likely to result in better efficacy than the 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg. AE profile of nausea and vomiting 
could be further mitigated by applying a 4-week dose escalation regimen. There is no unequivocal 
evidence confirming that a better benefit/risk profile could be attained with semaglutide maintenance 
doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg in the phase 3 trials as compared to 0.4 and 0.8 mg. Still, the confirmatory 
trials have demonstrated that maintenance doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg have a positive benefit/risk 
profile. Both dose levels of semaglutide can be safe and efficacious and should be based on individual 
needs. The 1.0 mg dose is associated with an increased risk of side effects. Patients with low body 
weight may experience more gastrointestinal side effects when treated with semaglutide. This is 
mentioned in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 103/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The Applicant suggests that semaglutide treatment is initiated with a dose of 0.25 mg. After four 
weeks, the dose should be increased to 0.5 mg. After at least four weeks with a dose of 0.5 mg, the 
dose can be increased to 1.0 mg. This dose regimen is based on estimations from trial 1821 and tests 
in trial 3819. However, the study groups and design of these trials were not identical. Therefore, the 
suggested dose regimen is questionable. As shown in trial 1821, the incidence of GI AEs generally 
decreased within the first 12 weeks of treatment. Therefore, a 12 week dose escalation regimen might 
improve the GI tolerability and reduce withdraws. In the answer, the Applicant, based on the data 
obtained in the phase 3a programme, presented a time course-model for nausea to describe the 
prevalence of nausea over time for different escalation regiments. Data simulation supports the choice 
of escalation schedule as it demonstrates that four-week escalation, as compared to one-week and 
eight-week escalation, achieves the best balance between risk of subjects experiencing nausea and 
achieving glycaemic control.  
It is questionable whether the additional effect on primary and secondary endpoints of semaglutide 1.0 
mg vs. 0.5 mg is clinically relevant. Although semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. 0.5 mg shows clear benefit on 
HbA1c and body weight change from baseline, the estimated treatment differences were small (range: 
0.10−0.43%−point HbA1c and 0.81−2.75 kg). Also, additional reduction on CV risk was small. 
Semaglutide 1.0 mg showed a higher number of AEs i(trials 3625 and 3627) and GI AEs (trials 3627, 
3744 and4092) compared with 0.5 mg. Therefore, the question arises whether semaglutide 1.0 mg 
provides additional clinical benefit compared to 0.5 mg. Because of the higher number of 
(gastrointestinal) adverse events, the Applicant should provide information about tapering off the 1 mg 
maintenance dose to 0.5 mg when the 1.0 mg is not tolerated. The Applicant reasons that, as the 
semaglutide 1.0 mg maintenance dose is reached by stepwise progression from 0.25 to 0.5 mg, 
patients must first have demonstrated that they can tolerate the 0.5 mg dose before being dose-
escalated to 1.0 mg. Thus, lowering the semaglutide dose from 1.0 mg to 0.5 mg may be carried out 
at discretion of the treating physician if deemed appropriate. This is acceptable. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
In the key efficacy trials, both semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg were superior in lowering HbA1c and 
body weight compared with placebo (both as monotherapy and in combination with insulin) or the 
respective comparators (i.e. sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin glargine). The reductions in HbA1c 
and body weight were sustained throughout the course of the treatment in all trials (up to 104 weeks 
in the CVOT). Both dose levels of semaglutide can be efficacious and should be based on individual 
needs.  
Semaglutide was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events. However, occurrence of 
cardiovascular death was similar with semaglutide and placebo, which might be due to the relative 
short duration of the trial. Numbers of all-cause death were similar for semaglutide and placebo (62 vs 
60 events), mostly due to CV-death (44 vs 46 events). Numbers of non-CV death were small (18 vs 
14). Results do not indicate that semaglutide has a beneficial or negative effect on CV-death and non-
CV death.  
For heart failure the hazard ratio for MACE was above 1 and treatment effects were absent for patients 
with chronic heart failure class II-III Conclusions drawn from subgroup analyses should be performed 
cautiously when subgroups are small, and in the statistical subgroup interaction test, the treatment 
differences were not statistically significant.

2.5.5.  Clinical safety 
Safety methodology 
The safety of semaglutide has been studied in a broad T2D population with different degrees of 
diabetic complications and which covered the continuum of T2D care. The safety evaluation was based 
on data from all completed and ongoing trials in the semaglutide s.c. OW development programme 
Safety was evaluated based on exposed patients using both the on-treatment observation period (i.e., 
treatment emergent events) and the in-trial observation period. For the majority of safety 
assessments, the primary focus was on the period where patients were considered exposed to trial 
product (i.e., the on-treatment observation period). Due to a potential long latency and diagnostic lead 
time, the evaluation of cardiovascular and microvascular disorders, neoplasms and fatal events focused 
primarily on data from the entire trial period regardless of treatment adherence (i.e., the in-trial 
observation period). 
Pooling of trials 
The evaluation of the safety profile of semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) was based both on data from 
the completed phase 3a trials of 30 to 56 weeks duration as well as data from the 2-year CVOT. Data 
from the CVOT were presented separately from the other phase 3a trials. Due to important differences 
in trial designs including size, duration and population it was evaluated not to be applicable and 
feasible to pool the CVOT with the other phase 3a trials. The primary evaluation of safety data from 
the 7 phase 3a trials excl. the CVOT were performed on pooled data from these trials (phase 3a pool). 
This was done to increase the level of evidence and was considered appropriate due to the overall 
consistency in trial design and safety results seen across the individual trials. 
Safety monitoring and overview 
Unblinded safety data were monitored by an external and independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) to protect patients enrolled in the trials from harm by providing a recommendation to the 
sponsor to modify the protocol or to terminate the trial if safety issues arise. The DMC performed 
ongoing evaluation of accumulated safety data from the CVOT at predefined time points and ad-hoc in 
accordance with written guidelines. The DMC did not identify any safety issues warranting changes in 
trial conduct. In addition, the DMC ensured adequate monitoring of CV safety across all phase 3a trials. 
Patient exposure 
The number of patients exposed in the phase 3a trials included a total of 8,093 patients of whom 
4,792 patients received at least one dose of semaglutide. A total of 3,301 patients were included in 
comparator groups including 1,906 in placebo groups and 1,395 in active comparator groups (OAD: 
120; sitagliptin: 510, Exenatide ER: 405; insulin glargine: 360). A total of 1,321 patients were exposed 
to semaglutide for 18 months or longer; the total exposure to semaglutide was 5,644 PYE; 2,712 PYE 
in the phase 3a trials and 2,932 PYE in the CVOT. 
Adverse events

The proportion of patients reporting at least one AE was higher with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) 
than comparators in the phase 3a pool and similar with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) and placebo 
in the 2-year CVOT. The overall rate of AEs was higher with semaglutide than placebo and comparators 
across all phase 3a incl. the CVOT. The higher proportions and rates of AEs were mainly driven by 
gastrointestinal disorders. 
All safety issues identified among commonly reported AEs or SAEs (Figure 27  and Figure 28) have 
previously been seen for other GLP-1 RAs, except for the adjudicated endpoint diabetic retinopathy 
complications in the CVOT. Overall, semaglutide had a safety profile similar in patients with T2D 
evaluated for glycaemic control (phase 3a pool) and in the more vulnerable population of patients with 
T2D at high risk of CV events (CVOT). 
The most commonly reported AEs with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) were gastrointestinal (GI) 
disorders including nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, abdominal 
distension, gastritis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, eructation and flatulence, which are known 
common side effects of GLP-1 RAs particularly at the start of treatment. The proportion of patients with 
GI AEs as well as the rate of events increased with semaglutide dose. This was reflected in more AEs 
and AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation with semaglutide 1.0 mg than with 
semaglutide 0.5 mg. In addition to GI AEs, decreased appetite, decreased weight, fatigue (incl. 
asthenia), dizziness, dysgeusia (altered taste perception) and cholelithiasis occurred more frequently 
with semaglutide than with placebo and comparators and are evaluated to be likely related to 
semaglutide. In general, these reactions were mild or moderate in severity and of short duration. AEs 
of lipase and amylase increased were also reported more frequently with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 
1.0 mg) than with placebo and active comparators, and are related to the general increase in lipase 
and amylase levels observed with semaglutide and other GLP-1 RAs.

were comparable in a head-to-head comparison. GI disorders were reported more frequently with 
semaglutide 1.0 mg than with exenatide ER 2.0 mg (41.8% vs. 33.3%) mainly driven by nausea, 
diarrhoea, vomiting, constipation and dyspepsia whereas events within the system organ class of 
‘general disorders and administration site conditions’ were reported less frequently with 
semaglutide 1.0 mg than with exenatide ER 2.0 mg (10.1% vs. 29.9%) mainly driven by a greater 
proportion of patients with exenatide ER 2.0 mg who reported injection site reactions. 
The semaglutide safety profile in patients at high CV risk (CVOT) generally resembled that observed in 
the more broad T2D population (phase 3a pool), albeit the incidences of especially deaths and CV 
events were higher reflecting a population at high risk of CV disease (Figure 28). In the CVOT, 
investigator-reported diabetic retinopathy and cataract were common AEs (i.e., reported as AEs in ≥ 
5% of patients) both with semaglutide and placebo.

Serious adverse events 
In the phase 3a pool the proportion of patients with serious adverse events (SAEs) were generally low, 
and slightly higher with semaglutide (0.5 mg: 6.6%; 1.0 mg: 6.7%) than with comparator products 
(5.8%). This difference was mainly explained by more GI SAEs with semaglutide. In the CVOT, the 
proportion of patients with SAEs was lower with semaglutide (0.5 mg: 32.1%; 1.0 mg: 29.3%) than 
with placebo (34.9%). In the CVOT the proportion of SAEs was slightly lower with semaglutide 1.0 mg 
than with 0.5 mg (0.5 mg: 32.1%; 1.0 mg: 29.3%). In line with the distribution of EAC-confirmed CV 
events described in the efficacy section, events within the SOC ‘Cardiac disorders’ were less common 
with semaglutide than with placebo. 
Deaths 
Across the semaglutide development programme, a total of 140 patients died. In the CVOT, a total of 
123 patients (3.7%) with T2D and high risk of CV events died due to AEs that had onset during the 2-
year in-trial period of the trial; 62 with semaglutide and 61 with placebo. In the 7 phase 3a trials in 
patients with T2D, a total of 16 patients died; 10 (0.3%) randomised to semaglutide, and 6 patients 
(0.4%) randomised to comparator products. In addition, one patient with T2D died during the follow-
up period due to a traffic accident in the clinical pharmacology trial 3635. No deaths were reported in 
the individual trials in the period from DBL until the cut-off date 18 April 2016. 
Fatal events occurred throughout the entire treatment period of the CVOT, with no clustering of events 
in any time interval and with similar patterns seen with semaglutide and placebo. All deaths were 
evaluated by the EAC and the cause of death was categorised as CV deaths, non-CV deaths or 
undetermined cause of death and further classified. As would be expected in patients with T2D at high 
risk of CV events, the majority of deaths were due to CV events including sudden cardiac death, 
undetermined cause of death and death due to acute MI as the most frequent causes, with no 
difference between treatments. For death classified by the EAC as ‘undetermined cause of death’, the 
investigator-reported term pertaining to the AE with fatal outcome indicated a CV cause in the majority 
of cases. In the analyses of composite CV endpoints, deaths with undetermined cause are considered 
CV deaths. Post hoc sensitivity analyses were performed excluding deaths with undetermined cause as 
CV events in the analyses of composite CV endpoints. There were no significant differences between 
semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg pooled) and placebo (pooled) for EAC-confirmed all-cause mortality 
or CV-death. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders 
Across the semaglutide development programme, GI AEs were the most frequently reported AEs 
during treatment with semaglutide. The most frequent GI AEs were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, 
constipation, dyspepsia and abdominal pain (CVOT: Figure 29  and phase 3a pool: Figure 30 ). Nausea 
was reported in up to 20% of patients across trials.

The proportion of patients with GI AEs and the types of GI AEs observed with semaglutide (0.5 and 1.0 
mg) were generally consistent for semaglutide across the phase 3a trials (CVOT: Figure 29  and phase 
3a pool: Figure 30 ). 
GI AEs were not more prevalent in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment for 
semaglutide vs. comparators. Patients with a higher exposure to semaglutide (as seen in patients with 
low body weight, low BMI, women and Asians) had more GI AEs than patients with a lower 
semaglutide exposure, as supported by exposure-response analyses. The proportion of patients 
reporting GI AEs were higher with increasing age both with semaglutide and placebo and comparator 
products. 
GI AEs were reported as SAEs at a very low frequency with semaglutide (both doses) with only minor 
variations relative to placebo, the non-GLP-1 RA comparators or exenatide ER. Four (4) fatal GI AEs 
were reported in 3 subjects in trial CVOT, 1 in 1 subject on semaglutide 0.5 mg and 3 in 2 subjects on 
placebo. 
GI AEs were typically of short duration and mild or moderate in severity. The duration of GI events 
were in general similar with semaglutide, placebo and active comparators. The proportion of patients 
with GI AEs and the corresponding rates were higher with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) than with 
comparators including placebo, non-GLP-1 RA comparators and exenatide ER. A higher rate of GI AEs 
during the dose escalation period was reported with semaglutide than with exenatide ER in trial 3624. 
In a proportion of patients, GI AEs were the primary reason for premature treatment discontinuation 
(phase 3a pool: 0.5 mg: 3.9%; 1.0 mg: 5.9%). GI AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation 
with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) occurred mainly during the dose escalation period in the 
beginning of the trials. 
CV safety 
The general CV safety of semaglutide was established in the dedicated pre-approval CVOT, 
demonstrating that semaglutide is not associated with an increased CV risk but, on the contrary, 
reduces the risk of MACE in patients with T2D at high CV risk (see efficacy for details). 
A non dose-related increase in resting pulse rate of 1 to 6 beats/minutes during treatment was seen 
across trials (Figure 31, Figure 32). The increase in pulse rate with semaglutide (1.0 mg) was not 
significantly different from the increase observed with exenatide ER 2.0 mg (Figure 33). No clinical 
consequences of increased pulse rate (e.g., increased angina pectoris, hospitalisation for heart failure, 
palpitations or discontinuation of treatment due to tachycardia) were identified in the semaglutide 
development programme. Furthermore, there was no increase in hospitalisation for heart failure, MACE 
or even increased mortality in the CVOT.

Diabetic retinopathy 
Diabetic retinopathy complications was an adjudicated composite endpoint in the CVOT, and events 
were confirmed based on fulfilment of one or more of the 4 criteria/components: i) need for retinal 
photocoagulation, ii) vitreous haemorrhage, iii) need for treatment with intravitreal agents and iv) 
onset of diabetes-related blindness (defined as Snellen visual acuity of 20/200 [6/60] or less, or visual 
field of less than 20 degrees, in the better eye with best correction possible). Fundoscopy/fundus 
photography performed according to local practice was scheduled at baseline, after 1 year of 
treatment, at premature treatment discontinuation visits and at end-of-treatment visits. 
Of a total of 98 EAC confirmed events of diabetic retinopathy complications, 79 were identified as first 
event. A higher number of subjects treated with semaglutide (50 subjects) than with placebo (29 
subjects) had first EAC confirmed event of diabetic retinopathy complications with no evidence of a 
difference between the semaglutide doses (semaglutide 0.5 mg: 25 subjects; semaglutide 1.0 mg: 25 
subjects) (HR: 1.76 [1.11; 2.78]95%CI). The treatment difference appeared early and persisted 
throughout the trial (Figure 34 ).

The imbalance was observed for all four components of the endpoint and was similar with semaglutide 
0.5 mg and 1.0 mg. The majority of the eye examinations leading to EAC-confirmed events of diabetic 
retinopathy complications were based on routine examinations, and events were thus asymptomatic. 
In the Kaplan Meier plots, the separation of the two curves was apparent immediately after trial 
initiation for time to first EAC confirmed events of all criteria for diabetic retinopathy complications. 
Compared to the overall population, the patients who had EAC-confirmed events of diabetic 
retinopathy complications during the trial were characterised by a longer diabetes duration 
(17.53 years), a higher baseline HbA1c (9.37%), more patients on insulins at baseline (75.9%), and 
more patients with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy (83.5%). 
Among patients without pre-existing diabetic retinopathy, events of EAC-confirmed diabetic 
retinopathy complications were few and there was no imbalance in events of diabetic retinopathy 
complications between patients treated with semaglutide as compared with placebo (5 vs 4 events). 
Supporting a lack of effect in those patients without baseline retinopathy, no difference was observed 
in patients with a baseline fundoscopy evaluated to be normal. 
A more specific group with an increased risk of retinopathy complications using semaglutide was 
identified. This risk of retinopathy complications was only observed in patients with retinopathy at 
baseline treated with insulin. In patients without retinopathy, there was no effect of semaglutide on 
the development of retinopathy complications. Numbers needed to treat (3-point MACE) and numbers 
needed to harm (retinopathy complications) were 45 and 77 respectively for the total population, 19

versus 36 for subjects with baseline retinopathy, and 61 versus 456 for subjects without retinopathy at 
baseline.  
For patients with diabetic retinopathy at baseline and treated with insulin, the number needed to treat 
is 17 for MACE, whereas the corresponding number needed to harm is 29 for diabetic retinopathy 
complications.  
Rapid improvements in glycaemic control may be associated with a transient worsening of diabetic 
retinopathy. Semaglutide treatment generally provides a rapid initial decline in blood glucose, e.g., 
more pronounced and with a faster decline than with a basal insulin (as shown with IGlar in 
trial 3625). This initial decline was even more pronounced in the CVOT, likely due to a higher baseline 
HbA1c. A post-hoc mediator analysis suggests that the effect of semaglutide in patients with pre-
existing retinopathy could be explained in part by the HbA1c reduction at week 16, indicating that a 
rapid initial decline in blood glucose was a likely mechanism causing this effect (Figure 35). Data 
suggest that semaglutide was associated with increased risk of retinopathy in patients with pre-
existent retinopathy and only small HbA1c reductions (HbA1c reduction <0.5%points).

Note: The figure shows observed incidence rates for first EAC-confirmed event of diabetic retinopathy complications 
(vertical axis) for subgroups of patients categorised by baseline diabetic retinopathy (yes, no, unknown/missing)

needles with pyramids are for semaglutide, grey needles with cubes are for placebo. Observed incidence rates per 
100 PYR are calculated as 100 times the number of patients with events divided by the total risk time. A patient’s 
risk time is the time from randomisation until the patient’s first EAC-confirmed event or censoring. 
Abbreviations: EAC: event adjudication committee; PYR: patient years of risk time. 
Systematic evaluation of diabetic retinopathy complications was only performed in the CVOT and not in 
the remaining phase 3a trials. Patients requiring active treatment for known proliferative retinopathy 
or maculopathy at baseline were excluded from these trials, and overall no safety concerns related to 
retinopathy were observed.

Renal safety 
Based on the PK results from a special population trial (trial 3616) and the population PK analysis 
which included patients with various degrees of renal impairment as covariate (see PK Section), no 
dose adjustment of semaglutide is needed in patients with renal impairment. This is supported by the 
fact that semaglutide is extensively metabolised in humans prior to elimination and excretion in the 
urine and faeces with only 3% intact semaglutide excreted in urine supporting that no accumulation is 
expected in patients with impaired renal function. 
In the CVOT, only patients requiring renal replacement therapy (chronic haemodialysis or chronic 
peritoneal dialysis) were excluded whereas patients with severe or end-stage renal disease were also 
excluded in the other phase 3a trials. In the phase 3a programme including more than 900 patients 
with moderate renal impairment, a little less than 100 patients with severe renal impairment and very 
few with end-stage renal impairment were included. Based on subgroup analyses, the safety profile of 
semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) appeared similar in patients with varying degrees of impaired renal 
function compared with patients with normal renal function. 
In the CVOT, fewer AEs and SAEs related to acute renal failure were reported with semaglutide 1.0 mg 
than with semaglutide 0.5 mg and placebo; all cases were associated with pre-existing morbidity, e.g., 
chronic renal disease, and some were temporally associated with GI AEs that may have led to 
dehydration and, in turn, prerenal failure (Figure 36). In the phase 3a pool, AEs related to acute renal 
failure were very few and with no apparent difference between semaglutide and comparator products 
(Table 16).

Semaglutide was consistently associated with an initial decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) ( 
Figure 37, Figure 38). In active-controlled phase 3a trials, the eGFR also decreased with the active 
comparators (same magnitude as with semaglutide), including sitagliptin, insulin glargine and OADs, 
suggesting that the decrease in eGFR was not related to properties of the incretin-based trial products. 
As observed in the CVOT, the decrease in eGFR was primarily seen in patients with normal renal 
function or mild impairment at baseline, whereas the decline was less marked in patients with 
moderate or severe impairment at baseline. In the CVOT, the eGFR decreased with placebo at a more 
constant and higher rate throughout the trial than with semaglutide; at end-of-treatment, the eGFRs 
did not differ significantly between semaglutide and placebo ( 
Figure 37). The effect seen with placebo likely reflects the expected decline of renal function over time 
in a population of patients with renal impairment.

Figure 38 eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) by treatment week (geometric mean) – SAS on-

In the CVOT, there was a decrease in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) with semaglutide and 
UACR values below baseline values with semaglutide at end-of-treatment, whereas it had increased 
with placebo (Figure 39). In the phase 3a trials excluding the CVOT, the UACR was assessed at 
baseline and at end-of-trial. The mean UACR was similar at both assessments across the groups. 
Time to new or worsening nephropathy was a secondary endpoint in the CVOT and was evaluated 
based on composite of 4 components (new onset of persistent macroalbuminuria, persistent doubling 
of serum creatinine and eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 per MDRD, need for continuous renal replacement 
therapy, and death due to renal disease) confirmed by an independent event adjudication committee 
(EAC). The incidence and rate of new or worsening nephropathy (first events and recurrent events) 
were lower with semaglutide (62 patients with 68 events) than with placebo (100 patients with 
106 events). The time-to-event analyses of EAC-confirmed new or worsening nephropathy showed a 
36% risk reduction with semaglutide relative to placebo.

Pancreatitis 
In the CVOT, the number of patients with EAC-confirmed acute pancreatitis was comparable with 
semaglutide (8 patients) and placebo (10 patients) and all events were classified as ‘mild acute 
pancreatitis’ based on the revised Atlanta criteria. 
In the phase 3a pool, 5 events of pancreatitis were confirmed by the EAC with semaglutide 0.5 mg, 
3 events with semaglutide 1.0 mg and 3 events with comparators. The event rate for EAC-confirmed 
pancreatitis was similar with semaglutide 1.0 mg and comparators, but higher with semaglutide 
0.5 mg compared to semaglutide 1.0 mg or comparators. All comparator events occurred in trial 3624 
with exenatide ER and no events were confirmed by the EAC for subjects receiving sitagliptin or 
non-incretin comparator products. 
Levels of serum lipase and amylase increased with semaglutide, similar to what has been described 
with other incretin-based therapies. After an initial increase in lipase and amylase, the levels showed 
no further change for up to 2 years (Figure 40, Figure 41). 
The evidence supports that, in the absence of other signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, elevation of 
lipase and amylase levels seen with semaglutide does not predict a later development of pancreatitis. 
This is in line with data obtained for liraglutide.

Gallstones 
In the placebo-controlled 2-year CVOT, the proportion of patients with gallbladder-related adverse 
events were similar with semaglutide (0.5 mg: 3.5%; 1.0 mg: 3.2%) and placebo (3.4%). Conversely, 
in the phase 3a pool, gallbladder-related AEs were reported more frequently with semaglutide (0.5 
mg: 1.3%; 1.0 mg: 1.7%) than with comparator products (0.8%); this difference was primarily driven 
by AEs of cholelithiasis, especially with semaglutide 1.0 mg. In the non-incretin subset, the proportion 
of subjects with cholelithiasis and the corresponding rates were 1.0% and 0.6% with semaglutide 0.5 
mg and 1.0 mg, respectively. However, with the non-incretin comparators, no AEs of cholelithiasis 
were reported. 
A total of 16 SAEs of cholelithiasis were reported across the phase 3a trials incl. the CVOT with no 
apparent difference between semaglutide and comparators. All but one SAEs of cholelithiasis led to 
cholecystectomy; there were 1-2 acute cholecystectomies with semaglutide and comparators, the rest 
were elective. 
The increased risk of cholelithiasis with semaglutide is in line with data on liraglutide for weight 
management and the liraglutide CVOT which both observed an increased risk of cholelithiasis and 
cholecystitis whereas no increased risk was observed in phase 3a trials for liraglutide in T2D.Taken 
together, it is likely that there is a causal relationship between cholelithiasis and semaglutide. 
Hepatic events 
Across the phase 3a trials, small mean and median decreases from baseline within the normal 
reference range were observed for each of the hepatic analytes (ALT and AST); and the decreases 
were more pronounced with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) than with all comparators. 
Overall, the proportion of patients with ALT/AST >3x ULN and 5x ULN were similar with semaglutide 
(0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) and placebo/active comparator products and there was no pattern or clustering 
in the timing or duration of the ALT/AST peaks. 
In the CVOT, the number of subjects with increases in ALT or AST >5xULN was slightly lower with 
semaglutide 0.5 mg than with semaglutide 1.0 mg albeit the total numbers were similar between 
semaglutide and placebo groups. In the phase 3a pool, there were more subjects with elevated ALT or 
AST levels >5xULN and >10xULN on semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) than on comparators. The 
number of subjects with ALP elevations 2x, 3x or 5xULN was well-balanced between both semaglutide 
doses and between semaglutide and comparators in the CVOT and the phase 3a pool. The number of 
subjects with TBL elevations 2x, 3x, 5x, 10xULN was well-balanced between both semaglutide doses 
and between semaglutide and comparators in the CVOT and the phase 3a pool. 
Thorough screening for Hy’s law was performed and no cases were identified. Hepatic disorders SAEs 
or severe AEs were infrequent and proportion of patients with events were similar with semaglutide 
and comparators Laboratory findings. 
Neoplasms 
Number and proportion of patients with individual type of neoplasms (benign and malignant) were low, 
see Figure 42. 
In the CVOT, there was a tendency towards higher frequencies for benign neoplasm with semaglutide 
than with placebo (HR: 1.35 [0.99; 1.84]95%CI, p=0.0558). No apparent single types of benign

neoplasms were driving this difference (Figure 42). In the phase 3a pool, the proportion of patients 
with EAC-confirmed benign neoplasms was low and similar with semaglutide and comparator products 
(HR: 1.14 [0.73; 1.78]95%CI, p=0.5713).  
Malignant neoplasms were equally distributed with semaglutide and placebo (HR: 0.94  
[0.67; 1.32]95%CI, p= 0.7228) in the CVOT with no apparent differences for any types of malignant 
neoplasms. In the phase 3a pool there was a tendency towards more malignant neoplasms (HR: 1.61 
[0.74; 3.49]95%CI, p=0.2264) with semaglutide than with comparators; however, numbers were low 
and the difference was not significant. Also, there were no single types of malignant neoplasms driving 
this difference. 
Both benign and malignant skin neoplasms occurred in a higher proportion of patients and at a higher 
rate with semaglutide 1.0 mg than with semaglutide 0.5 mg and placebo in the CVOT. The difference 
was driven by malignant skin neoplasms arising from 2 different cell types (basal and squamous cell 
carcinoma) and 1 case of malignant melanoma was identified. The full treatment differences for both 
benign and malignant skin neoplasms appeared early in the CVOT, making a drug-related effect 
unlikely. No differences were seen for neither benign nor malignant neoplasms in the phase 3a pool.

No cases of MTC were identified during the semaglutide development programme. Calcitonin is 
considered a biomarker for increased thyroid C-cell mass and activation. Calcitonin levels were 
assessed at baseline (to exclude patients likely to have pre-existing C-cell neoplasia) and at regular 
intervals during the semaglutide phase 3a trials to identify patients at risk of having C-cell neoplasia. 
Overall, minor fluctuations in calcitonin levels were observed throughout the phase 3a trials with no 
clinically relevant difference between semaglutide and placebo or semaglutide and comparators. 
Across the CVOT and phase 3a trials a small proportion of subjects had post-baseline events of 
calcitonin ≥20 ng/L both with semaglutide, placebo and pooled comparators. Proportion of subjects 
with post-baseline calcitonin levels >ULN, >20 ng/mL, >50 ng/L and >100 ng/L were comparable with 
semaglutide, placebo and pooled comparators.  
In the semaglutide clinical development programme, the incidence of pancreas cancer with 
semaglutide was low (5 cases: 3 malignant, 2 benign) and appeared not to be different from placebo 
and comparator products (7 cases; 6 malignant, 1 benign).  
Episodes of hypoglycaemia 
Episodes of hypoglycaemia were generally infrequent with semaglutide treatment when used as 
monotherapy or in combination with OADs excl. SU. In the semaglutide phase 3a clinical development 
programme, no episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were observed when semaglutide s.c. was used as 
monotherapy (Table 17).  
Episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were infrequent when semaglutide was administered concomitantly 
with OADs excl. SU and primarily observed when semaglutide was used with an SU or insulin with no 
apparent differences between semaglutide and comparators including placebo.

trials 3624 and 3627. Comparator in the CVOT is placebo. The on-treatment summary of hypoglycaemic episodes 
comprises treatment-emergent events from the hypo form reported with onset on or after the day of first 
randomised dose to date of last dose plus 42 days. The subgroups are based on the baseline medication. The 
patients included in each subgroup only consist of those patients from a trial, who fulfil the criteria. For phase 3a 
trials (excl. CVOT) the table only contain data from the on-treatment period without rescue medication and % and R 
are the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel-adjusted percentage and event rate.

A similar picture was seen with regards to background medication and frequencies of hypoglycaemia 
based on Novo Nordisk defined ‘severe or BG confirmed symptomatic episodes of hypoglycaemia’ in 
phase 3 trials. No difference between semaglutide and comparators was evident in patients on 
monotherapy as well as on a background of OADs excl. SU. For patients on SU and insulin, episodes 
were reported at higher frequencies with semaglutide than with placebo; the difference was due to 
more BG confirmed symptomatic episodes in the setting of lower achieved mean HbA1c.. 
In the CVOT where semaglutide was administered in addition to standard-of-care, changes to 
background medication were allowed during the trial reflecting a real-life setting. Across all background 
medications, there were no significant differences between semaglutide and placebo with respect to 
number of episodes or patients experiencing episodes of severe or BG confirmed symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia, including nocturnal episodes. However, for patients on SU and insulin, episodes of 
severe or blood glucose confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia were reported at higher frequencies

with semaglutide than with placebo. Overall, severe episodes of hypoglycaemia were infrequent with 
semaglutide (0.5 mg: 1.7%, 1.0 events per 100 PYE; 1.0 mg: 1.1%, 0.9 events per 100 PYE) and 
placebo (1.6%, 1.3 events per 100 PYE).  
Laboratory findings 
The following laboratory parameters have been described above: lipase and amylase, liver tests (ALT, 
AST, ALP, and total bilirubin), renal function tests (eGFR, creatinine, UACR, urea), calcitonin, anti-
semaglutide antibodies. 
No clinically relevant mean changes in haematology parameters (haemoglobin, haematocrit, 
thrombocytes, erythrocytes, leucocytes, differential cell count [eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils, 
monocytes and lymphocytes]) were observed from baseline to end-of-treatment in any of the 
treatment groups (semaglutide 0.5 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg or placebo) based on mean changes and 
ratios to baseline. 
No clinically relevant mean changes in the biochemistry parameters (albumin, sodium, potassium, 
creatine kinase, calcium total and calcium [albumin corrected]) were observed from baseline to end-of-
treatment in any of the treatment groups based on mean values, changes from baseline, or ratios to 
baseline. 
Safety in special populations 
AEs in subgroups 
The AE profile in subgroups of patients based on intrinsic factors (sex, baseline age, race, ethnicity, 
baseline BMI, baseline body weight, baseline hypertension, baseline CV history, baseline renal 
function, baseline hepatic function) and extrinsic factors (region, tobacco use and anti-glycaemic 
background medication) was explored. The applicant has provided detailed data for elderly patients in 
the mandatory table (Table 19  and Table 19). The safety profile of semaglutide was consistent across 
all subpopulations of patients treated with semaglutide including elderly and patients with renal 
impairment and heart failure.

Immunological events 
Semaglutide has a high homology (94%) to endogenous GLP-1 and is therefore expected to have a low 
immunogenic potential. Allergic reactions were reported by a low (4−6%) proportion of patients. Most 
of the allergic reactions were of mild or moderate severity, did not lead to premature treatment 
discontinuation and no differences between semaglutide and placebo/comparators were observed. 
In the CVOT, the most frequently reported AEs related to allergic reactions were the PTs rash, rhinitis 
allergic, urticaria, dermatitis and eczema; the proportion of subjects and rate of events of these PTs 
were similar across the semaglutide and placebo treatment groups. The most frequently reported AEs 
related to allergic reactions generally reflected the PTs reported for CVOT and overall were similar 
across treatment groups.

Injection site reactions were reported by a low (approximately 1%) proportion of patients with 
semaglutide and were not recurrent in those individuals. Most injections site reactions were of mild or 
moderate severity, did not lead to premature treatment discontinuation and no differences between 
semaglutide and placebo and non-exenatide comparators was observed. 
In trial 3624, injection site reactions were reported in fewer patients with semaglutide 1.0 mg (1.2%) 
than with exenatide ER 2.0 mg (22.0%). 
Anti-semaglutide antibody formation was low in the phase 3a trials; the proportion of subjects that 
tested positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies was 1.9% in CVOT, 1.0% in the phase 3a pool and 
2.2% in the pool of placebo-controlled trials. In patients that did test positive, the antibody response 
was low (up to 15.90 % bound semaglutide related to total semaglutide [B/T]) and appeared to be 
transient as very few patients (less than 0.4%) had anti-semaglutide antibodies at the follow-up visit 
performed at least 5 weeks after last dose. No patients had anti-semaglutide neutralising antibodies or 
anti-semaglutide antibodies with endogenous GLP-1 neutralising effect and no effect on semaglutide 
exposure, HbA1c or semaglutide safety profile were identified and no association with immunogenicity-
related AEs were evident (see efficacy). 
In trial 3624, 3.2% (13 of 404) of patients were tested positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies, none 
of the antibodies were neutralising to semaglutide or endogenous GLP-1. In contrast, anti-exenatide 
antibodies were confirmed in the majority (87.7%, 355 of 405) of patients treated with exenatide ER 
2.0 mg, in which 39 had a neutralising effect on exenatide and none on endogenous GLP-1.

2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The primary focus of the safety evaluation is on the data from the eight completed phase 3a trials, as 
these trials represent the intended target population as well as the majority of the overall exposure to 
semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg. The phase 3a trials were designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of semaglutide in a relatively broad population of subjects with T2D and included five multinational 
trials (trials 3623, 3624, 3625, 3626, 3627), two Japanese trials (trials 4091, 4092), and a 
cardiovascular outcome trial (trial 3744) referred to as the CVOT. 
Total exposure to semaglutide was 2712 PYE (n=3150 patients) in the phase3a trials and 2932 PYE 
(n=1642 patients) in the CVOT. Exposure is considered sufficient to evaluate the semaglutide safety 
profile in the target population. However, the high risk population in the CVOT trial is not 
representative of the general population. In addition, effects of treatment with semaglutide >2 years 
are unknown.

Characteristics were generally well-balanced across the semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) and 
placebo/comparator treatment groups. 
Adverse events CVOT 
In the 2-year CVOT, nearly 90% of subjects had at least one AE during the treatment period. The 
proportion of subjects with AEs was similar with semaglutide (0.5 mg: 88.9%; 1.0 mg: 88.2%) and 
placebo (88.4%), whereas, the rate of events per 100 PYE was higher in subjects treated with 
semaglutide (0.5 mg: 334.7 events per 100 PYE; 1.0 mg: 350.2 events per 100 PYE) than with 
placebo (313.2 events per 100 PYE). The majority of AEs were of mild or moderate severity. 
Approximately 22% of subjects had severe AEs both with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) and 
placebo. The proportions of subjects with AEs reported as recovered or recovering were similar with 
semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) and placebo. Also, proportion of AEs that were recovered and not-
recovered at the end of the trials were similar between semaglutide and placebo. The AEs reported 
with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) were generally consistent with those reported for other drugs in 
the GLP-1 RA class. AEs were reported in a higher proportion of subjects with semaglutide than with 
placebo in the GI disorders SOC and for PTs of lipase increased, amylase increased, decreased 
appetite, diabetic retinopathy, and dizziness. Headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract 
infection, bronchitis, and joint pain (arthralgia) were reported in a lower proportion of subjects with 
semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) than with placebo. 
A total of 123 subjects (3.7%) had fatal AEs that had onset during the 2-year in-trial period of the 
CVOT. The proportion of subjects with fatal events (with onset during the in-trial period) was similar 
with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) and placebo. 
SAEs were most frequently reported in the SOC cardiac disorders across all treatment groups. The 
proportion of subjects reporting SAEs within this SOC and the corresponding rate were generally lower 
with semaglutide than placebo (in particular with semaglutide 1.0 mg) confirming the results from the 
‘time-to-first CV event’ analyses. However, SAE’s coronary artery disease, cardiac failure and vascular 
therapeutic procedures (particularly cardiac interventions) were higher with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 
1.0 mg) than with placebo in the phase 3a pool. In the CVOT, the opposite was seen with fewer 
reports of the HLGT ‘vascular therapeutic procedures’ with semaglutide than with placebo. The 
Applicant has investigated the conditions leading to the procedures, and states that at HLGT level there 
were fewer imbalances in the conditions that are treated with vascular therapeutic procedures. 
According to the Applicant, local treatment practices and availability of treatment options may have 
amplified a chance finding here. 
Subjects discontinued treatment prematurely due to AEs throughout the trial both with semaglutide 
and placebo with the highest frequencies and rates in the first months after treatment initiation. The 
pattern for subjects discontinuing treatment prematurely due to AEs reflects that the prevalence of GI 
AEs was highest during the initial months and that these were the main drivers of premature treatment 
discontinuation due to AEs. 
Adverse events pool of phase 3a trials 
In the pool of phase 3a trials, the proportion of subjects reporting any AE during the treatment period 
was approximately 70%. The proportion of subjects with AEs and the corresponding rates were higher 
with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) than with comparator products (73.4 and 72.7% vs 68.7%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 128/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The majority of AEs were of mild or moderate severity. Approximately 6% of subjects in the 
semaglutide groups (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) and 4.4% in the comparators group had severe events. 
AEs reported with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) were generally consistent with those reported for 
other drugs in the GLP-1 RA class. The majority of AEs were reported as recovered. The proportions of 
subjects with AEs reported as not recovered or recovering were similar with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 
1.0 mg) and comparator products. Also, proportion of AEs that were recovered and not recovered at 
the end of the trials were similar between semaglutide and placebo. In the phase 3a pool, a total of 16 
subjects died due to AEs with onset during the in-trial period for the individual subject. A total of 10 
subjects (0.3%) randomised to semaglutide died, and 6 subjects (0.4%) randomised to comparator 
products died. 
The proportion of subjects with SAEs and the corresponding rate were higher with semaglutide (0.5 mg 
and 1.0 mg) than with comparator products. SAEs within the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders were 
reported by a higher proportion of subjects with semaglutide 0.5 mg (1.3%, 2.1 events per 100 PYE) 
than with semaglutide 1.0 mg (0.7%, 1.0 events per 100 PYE) and comparator products (0.5%, 0.8 
events per 100 PYE) driven by pancreatitis. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment 
prematurely due to AEs was higher with semaglutide than with comparator products. The proportion of 
subjects who discontinued treatment prematurely due to AEs was higher with semaglutide 1.0 mg than 
with semaglutide 0.5 mg indicating a dose-response. The proportions of subjects who discontinued 
treatment prematurely due to gastrointestinal disorders were higher with semaglutide (0.5 mg: 3.9%; 
1.0 mg: 5.9%) than with comparators (0.9%). 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Gastrointestinal disorders, particularly nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, are the most common side 
effects of GLP-1 RAs and these side effects are typically of short duration. Across the semaglutide 
development programme, gastrointestinal AEs were the most frequently reported AEs during treatment 
with semaglutide. The most frequent gastrointestinal AEs were nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, 
constipation, dyspepsia and abdominal pain. The frequencies (%) and rates of gastrointestinal AEs 
were higher with both doses of semaglutide compared to all comparators, including the only other GLP-
1 RA studied, Exenatide ER. 
There was a dose-dependent increase in gastrointestinal AEs with semaglutide across the CVOT and 
most of the phase 3a trials. This also included a dose-dependent increase in gastrointestinal AEs 
leading to premature treatment discontinuation. 
Gastrointestinal AEs were not more prevalent in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal 
impairment for semaglutide vs. comparators. 
Patients with a higher exposure to semaglutide (as seen in patients with low body weight, low BMI, 
women and Asians) had more gastrointestinal AEs than patients with a lower semaglutide exposure, as 
supported by exposure-response analyses. The fact that patients with low body weight may experience 
more gastrointestinal side effects when treated with semaglutide is mentioned in Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. 
Pulse rate 
Similar to other GLP-1 RA, an increase in resting pulse rate of 1 to 6 beats/minutes during treatment 
was seen across trials. However, based on the results obtained in the semaglutide CVOT as well as in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 129/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
the liraglutide LEADER trial, the increase in pulse rate does not seem to result in an increased CV risk 
after a follow up of 2 years. When assessed by office measurements, semaglutide seems to antagonize 
the beta-blocker-induced pulse rate reduction. As beta-blockers were not a randomised treatment in 
the CVOT, the implications hereof cannot be assessed. Extrapolation of the CV outcome results to 
subjects without established CV disease remains difficult. In these subjects the differences in office HR 
were larger than in the whole population. Possible longer term effects are unknown. 
Diabetic retinopathy 
A significantly increased risk of EAC-confirmed events of diabetic retinopathy complications was 
observed with semaglutide (50 [3.0%] patients) as compared with placebo (29 [1.8%] patients) 
(HR: 1.76 [1.11; 2.78]95%CI). The treatment difference appeared early and persisted throughout the 
trial The imbalance was observed for all four components of the endpoint (need for retinal 
photocoagulation, vitreous haemorrhage, need for treatment with intravitreal agents and onset of 
diabetes-related blindness) and was similar with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg. 
Exenatide has been associated with transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy in a case series 
(Varadhan et al. Diabetes Res Clin Pract. 2014;103(3):e37-9). In addition, in the liraglutide CVOT, the 
HR for the composite endpoint reflecting diabetic retinopathy complications, although not statistically 
significant, disfavoured liraglutide (HR: 1.15 [0.87; 1.52] 95%CI, p=0.33). 
Compared to the overall population, the patients who had EAC-confirmed events of diabetic 
retinopathy complications during the trial were characterised by a longer diabetes duration 
(17.53 years), a higher baseline HbA1c (9.37%), more patients on insulins at baseline (75.9%), and 
more patients with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy (83.5%). Among patients without pre-existing 
diabetic retinopathy, events of EAC-confirmed diabetic retinopathy complications were few and there 
was no imbalance in events of diabetic retinopathy complications between patients treated with 
semaglutide as compared with placebo (5 vs 4 events). 
A more specific group with an increased risk of retinopathy complications using semaglutide was 
identified. This risk of retinopathy complications was only observed in patients with retinopathy at 
baseline treated with insulin. In patients without retinopathy and no insulin use, there was no effect of 
semaglutide on the development of retinopathy complications. Numbers needed to treat (3-point 
MACE) and numbers needed to harm (retinopathy complications) were 45 and 77 respectively for the 
total population, 19 versus 36 for subjects with baseline retinopathy, and 61 versus 456 for subjects 
without retinopathy at baseline.  
Complications for patients with diabetic retinopathy at baseline and treated with insulin, complications 
the number needed to treat is 17 for MACE, whereas the corresponding number needed to harm is 29 
for diabetic retinopathy complications.  
Semaglutide treatment generally provides a rapid initial decline in blood glucose levels. The company 
refers to studies in patients with type 1 diabetes that reported an association between rapid glucose 
lowering and worsening of retinopathy. If this association is applicable to the effects of semaglutide, 
this would be reassuring. In type 1 diabetes, the early worsening of retinopathy is transient, largely 
resolving after 1 to 2 years (DCCT Research Group. Ophthalmology 1995;102:647-661; Dahl-
Jørgensen et al. Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) 1985;290:811-815), and there is clear evidence of benefit from 
glucose lowering in the following years (DCCT Research Group. Ophthalmology 1995;102:647-661). 
However, the fact that the increased risk of retinopathy complications with semaglutide does not 
Assessment report

Page 130/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
decrease in the course of the 2 year trial is worrisome and suggests that other mechanisms than rapid 
glucose lowering may play a role.  
An increased risk was observed in patients with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy at baseline and co-
use of insulin. Among patients without pre-existing diabetic retinopathy or insulin use, the frequency of 
diabetic retinopathy complications was low and similar with semaglutide and placebo. Data suggest 
that semaglutide was associated with increased risk of retinopathy complications in patients with pre-
existent retinopathy and only small HbA1c reductions (HbA1c reduction <0.5%points).  
The follow up might have been too short to show benefits of improved glycaemic control. However, 
there might have been other possibilities, such as a direct deleterious effect on the retina. 
Observations do not permit definite conclusions regarding the underlying mechanism of action. The 
occurrence of early worsening in patients with only small reductions in HBA1C remains unexplained. 
However, it is agreed that net clinical benefit over time due to improved glycaemic control is likely. A 
long-term PASS study should be conducted to examine this. The Applicant proposes to add a warning 
in section 4.4, similar to that of insulins. In general this can be accepted. However, the text should be 
somewhat amended. 
Systematic evaluation of diabetic retinopathy complications was only performed in the CVOT and not in 
the remaining phase 3a trials. 
Renal safety 
In the CVOT, fewer AEs and SAEs related to acute renal failure were reported with semaglutide 1.0 mg 
than with semaglutide 0.5 mg and placebo. In the phase 3a pool, AEs related to acute renal failure 
were very few and with no apparent difference between semaglutide and comparator products. 
Semaglutide was consistently associated with an initial decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR). As observed in the CVOT, the eGFR decreased with placebo at a more constant and higher 
rate throughout the trial than with semaglutide; at end-of-treatment, the eGFRs did not differ 
significantly between semaglutide and placebo. The effect seen with placebo likely reflects the 
expected decline of renal function over time in a population of patients with renal impairment, and the 
fact that this was not seen with semaglutide, excludes a negative effect of semaglutide on GFR. There 
was a decrease in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) with semaglutide in the CVOT. In the 
phase 3a trials excluding the CVOT, the UACR was similar with semaglutide and placebo.  
A causal relationship between acute renal failure and semaglutide is unlikely, and semaglutide may 
delay the progression of UACR. 
Pancreatitis 
No indications of semaglutide-induced acute pancreatitis have been observed in any of the repeat dose 
toxicity studies in mice, rats and monkeys or the 2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats. 
In line, in the CVOT, the number of patients with EAC-confirmed acute pancreatitis was comparable 
with semaglutide (8 patients) and placebo (10 patients). These results may be supported by recent 
results from the liraglutide CVOT where acute pancreatitis occurred in 18 liraglutide-treated patients 
and in 23 placebo-treated patients, as well as results from the lixisenatide CVOT where pancreatitis 
occurred in 5 patients in the lixisenatide group and in 8 in the placebo group. However, in the phase 3a 
pool, 8 semaglutide-treated patients had EAC-confirmed events of pancreatitis and 3 events were 
confirmed in patients treated with exenatide ER, while no events were reported with placebo. There

was a striking difference in the pattern of Exocrine pancreas conditions. A total of 8 events belonging 
to this HLGT are registered among the semaglutide treated patients (R=0.4) as compared to none in 
the comparator group The Applicant has addressed this imbalance and it has been documented that no 
dose response or temporal clustering was present. This weakens the assumption of a causal 
relationship with treatment. Further, reassuringly all but two of the events of pancreatitis were 
considered mild. 
Levels of serum lipase and amylase increased with semaglutide, similar to what has been described 
with other incretin-based therapies. After an initial increase in lipase and amylase, the levels showed 
no further change for up to 2 years. The mechanisms underlying these associations are not clear. In 
the absence of other signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, elevation of lipase and amylase levels seen 
with semaglutide did not predict a later development of pancreatitis. This is in line with data obtained 
for liraglutide. 
Taken together, levels of serum lipase and amylase increased with semaglutide. However, although the 
majority of confirmed events of pancreatitis were accompanied by increased lipase/amylase, the 
finding of increased lipase/amylase in isolation was a poor predictor of pancreatitis. 
Gallbladder-related adverse events 
In the placebo-controlled 2-year CVOT, the proportion of patients with gallbladder-related adverse 
events were similar with semaglutide (0.5 mg: 3.5%; 1.0 mg: 3.2%) and placebo (3.4%). However, in 
the phase 3a pool, gallbladder-related AEs were reported more frequently with semaglutide (0.5 mg: 
1.3%; 1.0 mg: 1.7%) than with comparator products (0.8%); this difference was primarily driven by 
AEs of cholelithiasis, especially with semaglutide 1.0 mg. In the non-incretin subset, the proportion of 
subjects with cholelithiasis and the corresponding rates were 1.0% and 0.6% with semaglutide 0.5 mg 
and 1.0 mg, respectively. However, with the non-incretin comparators, no AEs of cholelithiasis were 
reported. 
The increased risk of cholelithiasis with semaglutide is in line with data on liraglutide for weight 
management and the liraglutide CVOT which both observed an increased risk of cholelithiasis and 
cholecystitis. There was no clear pattern between extensive weight loss and events of cholelthiasis, 
events were seen in patients with weight gain as well as those with weight loss. Also, there did not 
seem to be an increasing number of events with increasing amounts of weight loss. In addition, there 
was no clear temporal pattern in the occurrence of cholelithiasis as the events were dispersed across 
the duration of the trials. The lack of a temporal pattern supports that these events were not set-off by 
the rapid or extensive weight loss usually observed with semaglutide treatment during the first 16 
weeks of the trials. The incidence rates of cholelithiasis in a T2DM cohort have been reported to be 1.2 
events per 100 PYE. The rate of cholelithiasis reported in the CVOT and phase 3a pool d with 
semaglutide were thus lower than, or on par with, the rate of cholelithiasis in a T2DM population in 
general. 
Hepatic analytes 
Across the phase 3a trials, small mean and median decreases from baseline within the normal 
reference range were observed for each of the hepatic analytes (ALT and AST); and the decreases 
were more pronounced with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) than with all comparators. In addition, 
in the CVOT, the number of subjects with increases in ALT or AST >5xULN was slightly lower with 
semaglutide 0.5 mg than with semaglutide 1.0 mg albeit the total numbers were similar between 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 132/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
semaglutide and placebo groups. However, in the phase 3a pool, there were more subjects with 
elevated ALT or AST levels >5xULN and >10xULN on semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) than on 
comparators. 
Neoplasms 
In the CVOT, there was a tendency towards higher frequencies for benign neoplasm with semaglutide 
than with placebo (HR: 1.35 [0.99; 1.84]95%CI, p=0.0558). No apparent single types of benign 
neoplasms were driving this difference. The difference between semaglutide and placebo was seen 
within the first 40 weeks in the trial indicating a relatively short lead time. In the phase 3a pool, the 
proportion of patients with EAC-confirmed benign neoplasms was low and similar with semaglutide and 
comparator products (HR: 1.14 [0.73; 1.78]95%CI, p=0.5713). 
Malignant neoplasms were equally distributed with semaglutide and placebo (HR: 0.94 [0.67; 
1.32]95%CI, p= 0.7228) in the CVOT with no apparent differences for any types of malignant 
neoplasms. In the phase 3a pool there was a tendency towards more malignant neoplasms (HR: 1.61 
[0.74; 3.49]95%CI, p=0.2264) with semaglutide than with comparators; however, numbers were low 
and the difference was not significant. Also, there were no single types of malignant neoplasms driving 
this difference. 
Thyroid neoplasms 
No cases of MTC were identified during the semaglutide development programme. Similar to other 
long-acting GLP-1 RAs, carcinogenicity studies show evidence of effects in rodents that are not 
mirrored in clinical trials in humans. However, the clinical trials in the semaglutide programme are of 
relatively short duration compared to the expected latency of MTCs. 
Calcitonin is considered a biomarker for increased thyroid C-cell mass and activation. Calcitonin levels 
were assessed at baseline (to exclude patients likely to have pre-existing C-cell neoplasia) and at 
regular intervals during the semaglutide phase 3a trials. Overall, minor fluctuations in calcitonin levels 
were observed throughout the phase 3a trials with no clinically relevant difference between 
semaglutide and placebo or semaglutide and comparators.. 
Pancreatic neoplasms 
In the semaglutide clinical development programme, the incidence of pancreas cancer with 
semaglutide was low (5 cases: 3 malignant, 2 benign) and appeared not to be different from placebo 
and comparator products (7 cases; 6 malignant, 1 benign). However, a follow up of only 2 years is 
relatively short. In addition, the liraglutide CVOT malignant pancreatic neoplasms were confirmed in 13 
patients in the liraglutide group and 5 in the placebo group. The Applicant has presented an analysis of 
the relative risk for pancreatic carcinoma in 6 CVOTs with the use of increatin-based medications: 5 of 
the 6 trials showed a relative risk below 1 and the liraglutide trial (LEADER) was the only one with a 
relative risk above 1. For semaglutide the Applicant keeps pancreatic cancer as an important potential 
risk in the RMP and pancreatic cancer will be monitored. This is considered adequate, and similar to 
liraglutide, no additional text in the SmPC is needed.

Hypoglycaemia 
Despite significant improvement in glycaemic control with HbA1c levels reduced to a greater extent 
with semaglutide than with all comparators, semaglutide does not increase the risk of hypoglycaemia 
unless combined with either SU or insulin. 
Subgroups 
Overall, the trial population did not display markedly different AE profiles for semaglutide (0.5 mg and 
1.0 mg) relative to comparators, when divided into subgroups. Impaired renal or hepatic function, sex, 
CV history or baseline hypertension did not substantially affect semaglutide-associated treatment 
differences. 
However, treatment differences with semaglutide were seen for AEs of decreased appetite (PT) in the 
following subgroups: baseline age ≥75 years; Asian race; non-Hispanic/Latino ethnicity; baseline body 
weight <70 kg; and baseline BMI <25 kg/m2. Accordingly, the treatment differences for weight 
decreased (PT) were most pronounced among subgroups of baseline body weight <70 kg and baseline 
BMI <25 kg/m2. The Applicant has provided detailed safety data in the Table “Adverse events in 
subgroups by age”. 
Clinical data in patients with hepatic impairment are not available. The clinical pharmacology trial (trial 
3651) demonstrated that the exposure to semaglutide is similar in subjects with hepatic impairment 
and subjects with normal hepatic function. No data in diabetic patients are presented. The SmPC 
should mention that caution should be exercised in severe hepatic impairment, as there are no data 
presented on the use of GLP1-RAs in these patients. Hepatic impairment must be considered missing 
information in the RMP.  
Immunological reactions 
The most frequently reported AEs related to allergic reactions were the PTs rash, rhinitis allergic, 
urticaria, dermatitis and eczema; the proportion of subjects and rate of events of these PTs were 
similar across the semaglutide and placebo treatment groups. 
Injection site reactions were reported by a low (approximately 1%) proportion of patients with 
semaglutide and were not recurrent in those individuals. A causal relationship between injection site 
reactions and semaglutide cannot be excluded, although the risk is evaluated as low, especially in 
comparison to exenatide ER. 
The proportion of subjects that tested positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies was 1.9% in CVOT, 
1.0% in the phase 3a pool and 2.2% in the pool of placebo-controlled trials. No effects on semaglutide 
exposure, HbA1c or semaglutide safety profile were identified and no association with immunogenicity-
related AEs were evident. However, long term effects of these antibodies are unknown. 
Additional safety data 
Data from a completed phase 2 trial (Trial 9924 3790) in the oral semaglutide development 
programme is included as supportive data as semaglutide s.c. OW is included as comparator. In the 
semaglutide sc arm, semaglutide compared to placebo was associated with a relatively high risk of 
hypoglycaemia (17.4 vs 11.3%). In addition, there were more adverse events leading to premature 
treatment discontinuation (14.5 vs. 1.4%).

2.5.7.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of semaglutide is generally consistent with those reported for other drugs in the GLP-
1 RA class. However, there are several specific safety issues. 
The rates of gastrointestinal adverse events were higher with semaglutide compared to all 
comparators, including the only other GLP-1 RA studied, Exenatide ER. There was a dose-dependent 
increase in gastrointestinal adverse events leading to premature treatment discontinuation (up to 9%). 
A significantly increased risk of diabetic retinopathy complications was observed with semaglutide as 
compared with placebo. This increased risk was particularly marked in patients with pre-existing 
diabetic retinopathy at baseline and co-use of insulin. Among patients without pre-existing diabetic 
retinopathy or insulin use, the frequency of diabetic retinopathy complications was low but numerically 
the relative risk was similar between semaglutide and placebo. The Applicant ascribes the increased 
incidence of retinopathy complications to early worsening of diabetic retinopathy following intensified 
glycaemic control. However, in contrast to what would be expected on the basis of previous studies 
with intensive glucose lowering using insulin, the increased risk of diabetic retinopathy complications 
with semaglutide suggests not to decrease in the course of the 2 year trial. In addition, data suggest 
that semaglutide was associated with retinopathy in patients with only small HbA1c reductions. A 
persistent deleterious effect of semaglutide on the retina independent of glucose lowering cannot be 
excluded. Therefore, a warning in section 4.4, similar to that of insulins, has been added. In addition, a 
post-authorization safety study will be performed.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.6 is acceptable.  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant requested alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD) of 05.12.2017 and the first Data Lock Point to be 
31.05.2018. The new EURD list entry will therefore be introduced in line with this request.

2.7.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that semaglutide has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in 
the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers semaglutide to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Ozempic (semaglutide) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit risk assessment 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive chronic metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal 
glucose metabolism. Close to 9% (415 million) of adults worldwide have diabetes with T2D accounting 
for ~90% of the diabetes cases. Glycaemic control is fundamental for the management of T2D to 
reduce the risk of T2D-related microvascular and macrovascular complications. CV disease is the 
leading cause of death in patients with diabetes, and CV morbidity is more prevalent in patients with 
diabetes than in those without.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are several classes of medicinal products for the treatment of T2D. All products have been 
shown to reduce blood glucose level and to improve HbA1c. Based on the extensive therapeutic 
experience (including possible CV benefits), metformin is currently recommended as first-line 
treatment for all patients with T2D, unless contraindications apply (most notably, GFR <30 ml/min). 
Recently, empagliflozin (SGLT2-inhibitor) and liraglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) have shown to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 139/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
superior compared to placebo in reducing 3-point MACE in patients with established CV disease in a CV 
outcome trial. 
Semaglutide is a GLP-1 RA that is structurally similar to liraglutide but modified to have a longer half-
life. The extended half-life is primarily obtained by increased albumin binding, which slows the 
degradation of semaglutide in plasma and results in decreased renal clearance prolonging the half-life 
of semaglutide to approximately 1 week making it suitable for once weekly s.c. administration. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The efficacy and safety of semaglutide as mono- and combination therapy (primarily combinations with 
metformin, SU and/or insulin) were evaluated in 5 key efficacy trials. In addition, semaglutide was 
compared with insulin glargine, a DPP-4 inhibitor and another long acting GLP-1 receptor agonist 
(exenatide ER). Semaglutide was investigated at two dose levels (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) in most phase 
3a trials. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
In trial 3623 (SUSTAIN 1), the primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of once-
weekly dosing of 2 dose levels of semaglutide vs placebo on glycaemic control after 30 weeks 
of treatment in drug naïve T2D subjects. This was a randomised, double blind, parallel group, 
placebo controlled, 4 armed trial in adult T2D subjects treated with diet and exercise. 
In trial 3626 (SUSTAIN 2), the primary objective was to compare the effect of once-weekly 
dosing of 2 dose levels of semaglutide vs sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily on glycaemic control 
after 56 weeks of treatment. This was a randomised, double-blind, 4-armed trial in T2D 
subjects who had not achieved adequate glycaemic control on metformin, TZD or a 
combination of metformin/TZD. 
In trial 3624 (SUSTAIN 3), the primary objective was to compare the effect of semaglutide 
1.0 mg once-weekly vs exenatide ER 2.0 mg once-weekly on glycaemic control after 56 weeks 
of treatment. This was a randomised, open-label, 2-armed trial in subjects with T2D. The trial 
was open label. 
In trial 3625 (SUSTAIN 4), the primary objective was to compare the effect of once-weekly 
dosing of 2 dose levels of semaglutide vs insulin glargine once-daily on glycaemic control after 
30 weeks of treatment in insulin-naïve T2D subjects. This was a randomised, open-label, 3-
armed trial in insulin-naïve T2D subjects. The trial was open label. 
In trial 3627 (SUSTAIN 5), the primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of once-
weekly dosing of 2 dose levels of semaglutide vs placebo on glycaemic control in subjects with 
T2D on basal insulin. This was a randomised, double-blind, 4-armed trial in subjects with T2D. 
The last phase 3a trial (trial 3744; SUSTAIN 6) was a 104−week cardiovascular outcomes trial 
(CVOT). The primary objective was to confirm that treatment with semaglutide does not result in an 
unacceptable increase in CV risk compared to placebo in T2D subjects. The secondary objectives were 
to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg once-weekly compared 
to placebo, both added on to standard-of-care. This was a double-blind trial in subjects with T2D at 
very high risk of CV events. 
Two additional phase 3a trials evaluated semaglutide for treatment of T2D in Japanese subjects (trials 
4092 and 4091). While safety was the primary endpoint for the Japanese trials, they were designed 
and conducted in a similar manner to the key efficacy trials.

• 
In trial 4092 (JPN), the primary objective was to compare the safety of once-weekly dosing of 
semaglutide (0.5 and 1.0 mg) versus sitagliptin (100 mg) once daily, both as monotherapy 
during 30 weeks of treatment in Japanese T2D subjects. This was a randomised, open-label, 
active-controlled, 3-armed trial in subjects with T2D. 
In trial 4091 (JPN), the primary objective was to compare the safety of once-weekly dosing of 
semaglutide in monotherapy or in combination with 1 OAD (either of SU, glinide, alpha-GI or 
TZD) vs OAD therapy during 56 weeks of treatment in Japanese T2D subjects who are 
insufficiently controlled on diet/exercise therapy or OAD monotherapy (either of SU, glinide, 
alpha-GI or TZD. This was a randomised, open-label, active-controlled, 3-armed trial in T2D 
subjects insufficiently controlled on diet/exercise therapy or OAD monotherapy. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Once weekly dosing regimen 
In the pharmacokinetic studies, it has been demonstrated that the semaglutide formulations are 
suitable for once weekly administration. The absorption of semaglutide after subcutaneous injection is 
slow and Tmax is reached between 24-36 hours post-dosing. After a single dose of semaglutide s.c. 
the systemic concentrations were maintained at about the same level for about 7 days. Steady state 
concentrations were achieved after 4-5 weeks. 
HbA1c 
In all eight phase 3a trials, treatment with semaglutide 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg resulted in a reduction in 
HbA1c, starting after 4 weeks of treatment and reaching nadir after 16−30 weeks (see Effects Table 
below). The reduction was maintained after long-term treatment of up to 104 week in the CVOT. The 
reductions in HbA1c obtained with semaglutide were 1.09−1.87 %−points with semaglutide 0.5 mg 
and 1.41−2.18 %−points with semaglutide 1.0 mg and superior across trials with semaglutide vs 
placebo or active comparators. 
Body weight 
Semaglutide reduced body weight in all eight phase 3 trials compared with placebo (both as 
monotherapy and in combination with insulin) or active comparators; sitagliptin, exenatide ER and 
insulin glargine. The reductions of up to 4.28 kg and 6.42 kg with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, 
respectively took place through the first 30 weeks of treatment. The reduction in body weight was 
sustained through the entire treatment period of up to 104 weeks in the CVOT. 
MACE 
In CVOT trial 3744, (SUSTAIN 6), the primary objective was reached and non-inferiority of semaglutide 
versus placebo in terms of MACE was demonstrated. The composite primary outcome occurred in 108 
of 1648 patients (6.6%) in the semaglutide group and 146 of 1649 (8.9%) in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95; P<0.001 for non-inferiority and 
P=0.02 for superiority). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 141/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
For MACE components, CV death was similar with semaglutide and placebo (HR: 0.98 [0.65; 
1.48]95%CI, but events of non-fatal MI (HR: 0.74 [0.51; 1.08]95%CI, p=0.1194) and non-fatal stroke 
(HR: 0.61 [0.38; 0.99]95%CI, p=0.0438) favoured semaglutide. 
The proportion of subjects that experienced an expanded MACE (3-point MACE plus revascularisation 
(coronary and peripheral), unstable angina requiring hospitalisation, or hospitalisation for heart failure) 
was lower with semaglutide (199 subjects, 12.1%) than with placebo (264 subjects, 16.0%; HR 0.74 
[0.62; 0.89]95% CI). 
The number of subjects with MACEs across the seven phase 3a trials (excluding the CVOT) were 
similar across the treatment groups (semaglutide 0.5 mg: 8 subjects [0.6%], semaglutide 1.0 mg: 5 
subjects [0.3%], all comparators: 8 subjects [0.5%]). 
Other endpoints 
Overall, in the key efficacy trials, systolic (and diastolic) blood pressure decreased more with 
semaglutide 1.0 mg and 0.5 mg (systolic blood pressure ranging from -2.58 to -7.27 mmHg) vs 
comparators (ranging from -0.99 to -1.72 mmHg) at end-of-treatment. 
Subgroups body weight and sex 
In a population PK analysis, semaglutide exposure was only affected by body weight showing higher 
semaglutide exposure in subjects with a lower body weight. However, in the clinical trials, the 
semaglutide efficacy was consistent across subgroups of baseline body weight. In addition, the overall 
HbA1c response to semaglutide was not influenced by sex and region. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Dose selection 
Dose-response modelling was used to select the semaglutide maintenance doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg 
for the phase 3 programme. There is no unequivocal evidence for a better benefit/risk profile with 
semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg in the phase 3 trials as compared to 0.4 and 0.8 mg. Still, the 
confirmatory trials have provided evidence for maintenance doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg. Both dose levels 
can be safe and efficacious and should be based on individual needs. The 1.0 mg dose is associated 
with an increased risk of side effects. Patients with low body weight may experience more 
gastrointestinal side effects when treated with semaglutide. This is mentioned in Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC.  
Comparators 
Semaglutide was compared to several active comparators that may be considered a next step after 
lifestyle and metformin. However, a comparison to SU was not performed. SU is considered the next 
step after metformin by many guidelines and doctors. 
In trial 3624 (SUSTAIN 3), compared to exenatide ER, semaglutide 1.0 mg was associated with a 
decrease in HbA1c after 56 weeks of -0.62%. In addition, compared to exenatide ER, semaglutide 1.0 
mg was associated with a decrease in body weight after 56 weeks of -3.78 kg. However, the effect of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 142/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
exenatide 2.0 mg once weekly on HbA1c (reduction of -0.92% from baseline) appears to be somewhat 
smaller than the effect seen in the DURATION studies, which found a mean HbA1c reduction of 1.3%-
point to 2.0%-point at Week 26-52. The reason for this difference is unclear. In addition, the effect of 
exenatide 2.0 mg once weekly on body weight (reduction of -1.85 kg from baseline) appears to be 
somewhat smaller than the effect seen in the DURATION studies, which found a mean weight reduction 
of 2.0-4.1 kg at Week 26-52. The Applicant has presented the results for 3 DURATION trials and 
pointed out that the change in HbA1c and weight at 23 weeks resembles the changes observed in Trial 
3624. However, the two DURATION trials with the greatest HbA1c-reduction were omitted because 
these trials would not resemble Trial 3624. Although this argumentation is not agreed, the trial met its 
primary objectives. 
Subgroups 
Several subgroups were relatively small and/or demonstrated inconsistent results. 
Although the number of subjects ≥75 years of age at baseline was more than 74 subjects for each of 
the four treatment groups in the CVOT, there were less than 20 individuals >75 years of age for each 
treatment group in all other trials. Efficacy of semaglutide on HbA1c reduction was consistent across 
most age groups. However, in comparison to other age groups, the effects of semaglutide on HbA1c 
for subjects >75 years of age were lower in some trials but higher in others. Due to the relatively small 
numbers of patients >75 years of age, efficacy in these patients is uncertain. 
With regard to race, the majority of subjects across all trials were White (64−84%), except for the two 
Japanese trials in which all subjects were Asian. Excluding the two Japanese trials, the proportion of 
Black or African American subjects across trials was only 5−9%, while 2−25% of subjects were Asian. 
For Asians and Blacks/African Americans, the effects of semaglutide on HbA1c were not consistent. The 
2 trials from Japan provide supportive evidence for efficacy in Asians, but efficacy in Blacks/African 
Americans is uncertain. 
The mean renal function for the CVOT population was lower (eGFR: 76.13 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared 
with the other phase 3a trials. This was the only trial to include subjects (around 3%) with severe 
renal impairment, while moderate renal impairment accounted for 25% of subjects in the CVOT. In 
several trials, the treatment effect tended to be 0.1-0.3% smaller in subjects with mildly and 
moderately impaired renal function compared with subjects with normal renal function. Due to the 
relatively small numbers of patients with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease, 
efficacy in these patients is uncertain. This is adequately addressed in the updated SmPC. 
No trials with combination therapy with DPP-4-inhibitors or SGLT-2-inhibitors have been carried out. A 
combination with DPP-4 inhibitors is not rational, as the mechanism of action is similar for both 
products. In SUSTAIN 2, only 5.4% (N=43) of the patients were using a TZD as background 
medication in combination with semaglutide. Efficacy of semaglutide on a background of a TZD or 
SGLT-2-inhibitors is not well established.  
Cardiovascular risk 
For a drug that is intended for long term diabetes treatment, the duration of the CVOT (2 years) is 
relatively short (also in comparison to several other cardiovascular outcome trials). Longer term safety 
is uncertain. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 143/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The inclusion of only individuals with a very high CV risk in the CVOT makes it uncertain whether the 
results may be generalized to the general diabetic population. In the CVOT a number of subjects were 
included with T2DM and risk factors “only”. In these subjects, no effect on MACE was observed, but the 
numbers were too small to draw firm conclusions (10 events with semaglutide and 9 events with 
placebo).  
Semaglutide had a favourable effect on events of non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. However, the 
occurrence of CV death was similar with semaglutide and placebo (HR: 0.98 [0.65; 1.48]95%CI). Based 
on biological plausibility it may be anticipated that treatment will beneficially influence all components 
in a similar way. The Applicant reasons that duration of the trial may have been too short for showing 
positive effects on CV-death. Similar results have been observed for statins and PCSK9-inhibitors.  
The difference in MACE is primarily driven by a difference in the rate of strokes. However, there was a 
baseline difference in prior stroke favouring semaglutide. To further clarify this, subgroup analyses in 
patients with prior stroke for the primary and secondary endpoints for MACE were requested during the 
procedure. Also, additional analyses for MACE where patients with previous strokes or prior MI were 
excluded were requested. Point estimates for the hazard ratios were in line with those seen for all 
subjects. However, effect on MACE seems to be more consistent in subjects without prior stroke than 
in subjects with prior stroke. This is even more so for the individual components of MACE. The number 
of subjects with prior stroke and an event were small, and confidence intervals were wide. Therefore, 
no firm conclusion can be drawn. The analyses adjusted by prior stroke were consistent with the 
primary MACE analysis. It is unlikely that the small difference in distribution at baseline has affected 
the outcome of the CVOT in a relevant way. For prior myocardial infarction, results were more 
consistent. Effect was seen both in subjects without and with prior MI. Similarly, almost all individual 
components of the expanded MACE contributed to the favourable treatment effect of semaglutide with 
hazard ratios below 1, but hospitalisation for heart failure had a hazard ratio above 1.  
All-cause mortality also had a hazard ratio above 1. Analyses including all-cause mortality should 
supplement analyses based on endpoints that include only CV mortality. Any analysis that ‘censors’ 
patients who die from non-CV causes effectively makes an assumption of continued treatment effect 
after death and hence provides treatment effects that are difficult to understand. In additional analyses 
however, no influence of such informative censoring due to non-CV mortality was observed. These 
analyses therefore support the primary analysis. 
The results of most pre-specified subgroup analyses in the CVOT were consistent with the results of 
the primary analysis of time to first EAC-confirmed MACE. However, treatment effects were absent for 
patients with chronic heart failure class II-III and lower for patients using insulin treatment at baseline 
requires (p for interaction 0.09 and 0.12, respectively) The Applicant reasons that effects on HbA1c, 
body weight and systolic blood pressure were seen in subjects with chronic heart failure class II-III and 
in subjects using insulin at baseline. This could be extrapolated to MACE. Moreover, conclusions drawn 
from subgroup analyses should be performed cautiously when subgroups are small also considering the 
non-statistically significant subgroup interaction test. For use of insulin at baseline, the populations of 
subjects using insulin at baseline are similar in terms of demography and CV history. Subgroups were 
small, and it is unlikely that there is a true difference in effects on MACE in subjects with T2D using 
premix or basal insulin at baseline.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
For safety evaluation, results of the phase 3 trials were pooled, but results for the CVOT population 
were described separately. Total exposure to semaglutide was 2712 PYE (n=3150 patients) in the 
phase 3a trials and 2932 PYE (n=1642 patients) in the CVOT. 
Adverse events pool of phase 3a trials 
The proportion of subjects with AEs and the corresponding rates were higher with semaglutide (0.5 mg 
and 1.0 mg) than with comparator products (73.4 and 72.7% vs 68.7%). The proportions of subjects 
with AEs reported as not recovered or recovering were similar with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) 
and comparator products. 
In the phase 3a pool, a total of 16 subjects died due to AEs with onset during the in-trial period for the 
individual subject. A total of 10 subjects (0.3%) randomised to semaglutide died, and 6 subjects 
(0.4%) randomised to comparator products died. 
The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment prematurely due to AEs was higher with 
semaglutide than with comparator products. The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment 
prematurely due to AEs was higher with semaglutide 1.0 mg than with semaglutide 0.5 mg indicating a 
dose-response. The proportions of subjects who discontinued treatment prematurely due to 
gastrointestinal disorders were higher with semaglutide (0.5 mg: 3.9%; 1.0 mg: 5.9%) than with 
comparators (0.9%). 
Adverse events CVOT 
The proportion of subjects with AEs was similar with semaglutide (0.5 mg: 88.9%; 1.0 mg: 88.2%) 
and placebo (88.4%). The proportions of subjects with AEs reported as recovered or recovering were 
similar with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) and placebo. 
A total of 123 subjects (3.7%) had fatal AEs that had onset during the 2-year in-trial period of the 
CVOT. The proportion of subjects with fatal events (with onset during the in-trial period) was similar 
with semaglutide (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) and placebo. 
Subjects discontinued treatment prematurely due to AEs throughout the trial both with semaglutide 
and placebo with the highest frequencies and rates in the first months after treatment initiation. The 
prevalence of GI AEs was highest during the initial months and these events were often the reason for 
premature treatment discontinuation due to AEs. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
The rates of gastrointestinal adverse events were higher with semaglutide compared to all 
comparators, including the only other GLP-1 RA studied, exenatide ER. There was a dose-dependent 
increase in gastrointestinal adverse events leading to premature treatment discontinuation (up to 9%). 
Patients with a higher exposure to semaglutide (as seen in patients with low body weight, low BMI, 
women and Asians) had more gastrointestinal AEs, particularly nausea, than patients with a lower 
semaglutide exposure, as supported by exposure-response analyses.

Diabetic retinopathy 
Although not observed in the preclinical studies, a significantly increased risk of EAC-confirmed events 
of diabetic retinopathy complications was observed with semaglutide (50 [3.0%] patients) as 
compared with placebo (29 [1.8%] patients) (HR: 1.76 [1.11; 2.78]95%CI) in the CVOT. The treatment 
difference appeared early and persisted throughout the trial. The imbalance was observed for all four 
components that were predefined (need for retinal photocoagulation, vitreous haemorrhage, need for 
treatment with intravitreal agents and onset of diabetes-related blindness) and was similar with 
semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg. Compared to the overall population, the patients who had events of 
diabetic retinopathy complications during the trial were characterised by a longer diabetes duration 
(17.53 years), a higher baseline HbA1c (9.37%), use of insulins at baseline (75.9%) and pre-existing 
diabetic retinopathy (83.5%). Among patients without pre-existing diabetic retinopathy, there was no 
imbalance in events of diabetic retinopathy complications between patients treated with semaglutide as 
compared with placebo (5 vs 4 events). 
Systematic evaluation of diabetic retinopathy complications was only performed in the CVOT and not in 
the remaining phase 3a trials. 
Renal safety 
Semaglutide was consistently associated with an initial decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR), but at end-of-treatment the eGFRs did not differ significantly between semaglutide and 
placebo. There was a decrease in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) with semaglutide in the 
CVOT. In the phase 3a trials excluding the CVOT, the UACR was similar with semaglutide and placebo. 
In the CVOT, fewer AEs and SAEs related to acute renal failure were reported with semaglutide 1.0 mg 
than with semaglutide 0.5 mg and placebo. In the phase 3a pool, AEs related to acute renal failure 
were very few and with no apparent difference between semaglutide and comparator products. 
Semaglutide was not associated with acute renal failure or progression of UACR. 
Gallbladder-related adverse events 
In the phase 3a pool, gallbladder-related AEs were reported more frequently with semaglutide 
(0.5 mg: 1.3%; 1.0 mg: 1.7%) than with comparator products (0.8%); this difference was primarily 
driven by AEs of cholelithiasis, especially with semaglutide 1.0 mg. In the CVOT, the proportion of 
patients with gallbladder-related adverse events was similar with semaglutide (0.5 mg: 3.5%; 1.0 mg: 
3.2%) and placebo (3.4%). In the non-incretin subset, the proportion of subjects with cholelithiasis 
and the corresponding rates were 1.0% and 0.6% with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, respectively. 
With the non-incretin comparators, no AEs of cholelithiasis were reported. 
There was no clear pattern between extensive weight loss and events of cholelithiasis, events were 
seen in patients with weight gain as well as those with weight loss. Also, there did not seem to be an 
increasing number of events with increasing amounts of weight loss. In addition, there was no clear 
temporal pattern in the occurrence of cholelithiasis as the events were dispersed across the duration of 
the trials. The lack of a temporal pattern supports that these events were not set-off by the rapid or 
extensive weight loss usually observed with semaglutide treatment during the first 16 weeks of the 
trials. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 146/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The incidence rates of cholelithiasis in a T2DM cohort have been reported to be 1.2 events per 100 
PYE.16 The rate of cholelithiasis reported in the phase 3a pool and the CVOT with semaglutide were 
thus lower than, or on par with, the rate of cholelithiasis in a T2DM population in general. 
Thus, cholelithiasis may be causally related to semaglutide, but the nature of the events reported do 
not support the need for cholelithiasis to be included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC. Cholelithiasis is 
adequately listed as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
Thyroid neoplasms 
No cases of MTC were identified during the semaglutide development programme. However, the clinical 
trials in the semaglutide programme are of relatively short duration compared to the expected latency 
of MTCs. Calcitonin is considered a biomarker for increased thyroid C-cell mass and activation. 
Calcitonin levels were assessed at baseline (to exclude patients likely to have pre-existing C-cell 
neoplasia) and at regular intervals during the semaglutide phase 3a trials. Overall, minor fluctuations 
in calcitonin levels were observed throughout the phase 3a trials with no clinically relevant difference 
between semaglutide and placebo or semaglutide and comparators. 
Hypoglycaemia 
Despite significant improvement in glycaemic control with HbA1c levels reduced to a greater extent 
with semaglutide than with all comparators, semaglutide did not increase the risk of hypoglycaemia 
unless combined with either SU or insulin. 
Immunological reactions 
In all trials, either no subjects or a relatively low number of subjects developed anti-semaglutide 
antibodies. Formation of anti-semaglutide antibodies with or without GLP-1-cross-reacting properties 
hampered the HbA1c-lowering effect of semaglutide. 
Injection site reactions were reported by a low (approximately 1%) proportion of patients with 
semaglutide and were not recurrent in those individuals. A causal relationship between injection site 
reactions and semaglutide cannot be excluded, although the risk is evaluated as low, especially in 
comparison to exenatide ER (22.0%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Retinopathy 
The mechanism explaining the increased risk of retinopathy is uncertain. Semaglutide treatment 
generally provides a rapid initial decline in blood glucose levels. The company refers to studies in 
patients with type 1 diabetes that reported an association between rapid glucose lowering and 
worsening of retinopathy. If this association were applicable to the effects of semaglutide, this would 
be reassuring. In type 1 diabetes, the early worsening of retinopathy is transient, resolves after 1 to 2 
years and there is clear evidence of benefit from glucose lowering in the following years (DCCT 
Research Group. Ophthalmology 1995;102:647; N Engl J Med 1993;329:977; the Oslo study, Dahl-
Jørgensen et al. Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) 1985;290:811) (Figure 43).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 147/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
However, the fact that the increased risk of retinopathy with semaglutide does not decrease in the 
course of the 2 year trial (Figure 44) is worrisome and suggests that other mechanisms than rapid 
glucose lowering may play a role. The Applicant suggests that the largest separation of the 
semaglutide and placebo curves is manifested during the first year of the CVOT and that the two 
curves are more parallel during the second year. However, in figures presented in the response 
document a further separation can be observed after the first year. In addition, a mediator analysis, 
shows that a marked decrease in HbA1c is a risk factor for development of retinopathy. However, the 
effect is much stronger in placebo-treated patients than in semaglutide-treated patients; among those 
treated with semaglutide, some are affected by retinopathy without much improvement in HbA1c.

conventional (dashed blue line) or intensive (solid red line) insulin therapy for nine years

Figure 44 Time to first EAC-confirmed events of diabetic retinopathy complication in patients 
with type 2 diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk who were treated with either placebo 
(dashed blue line) or semaglutide (solid red line) for two years- (FAS in trial – CVOT). 
A more specific group with an increased risk of retinopathy complications using semaglutide was 
identified. This risk of retinopathy complications was only observed in patients with retinopathy at 
baseline treated with insulin. In patients without pre-existing retinopathy, there was no effect of 
semaglutide on the development of retinopathy complications. Numbers needed to treat (3-point 
MACE) and numbers needed to harm (retinopathy complications) were 45 and 77 respectively for the 
total population, 19 versus 36 for subjects with baseline retinopathy, and 61 versus 456 for subjects 
without retinopathy at baseline.  
For patients with diabetic retinopathy at baseline and treated with insulin, the number needed to treat 
is 17 for MACE, whereas the corresponding number needed to harm is 29 for diabetic retinopathy 
complications.  
Effect of dose on tolerability 
Based on the results from the dose-finding trial 1821 and the exposure response analysis from four 
phase 3a trials, it is uncertain whether the maintenance dose of semaglutide 0.5 mg is the optimal 
dose. A lower maintenance dose of 0.4 mg demonstrated a relevant decrease in HbA1c and a lower 
number of GI AEs. The population PK analysis showed a significant effect of body weight on the 
exposure of semaglutide. Patients with a relatively low body weight, and thus a higher exposure to 
semaglutide, appear to have a higher incidence of GI events and a lower chance that these adverse 
events subside over time due to tolerance.  
Weight loss was most pronounced in the first two to three months of treatment. It is unknown how 
much GI side effects such as nausea and vomiting contribute to this weight loss. Furthermore, 
although weight loss is a known effect of GLP1-agonists the mechanism behind the weight loss with 
semaglutide is not entirely clear, as there did not seem to be an effect on appetite sensation. The 
weight loss could contribute to the observed decrease in systolic blood pressure, but why this did not 
translate into a decrease in diastolic blood pressure remains unknown.  
It is uncertain whether the additional effect of semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. 0.5 mg is clinically relevant. 
Although semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. 0.5 mg shows benefit on HbA1c and body weight change from 
baseline, the estimated treatment differences were small (range: 0.10−0.43%−point HbA1c and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/715701/2017 
Page 149/156 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
0.81−2.75 kg). Also, the additional reduction of CV risk was small (HR 0.77 vs. 0.71). Semaglutide 
1.0 mg showed a higher number of AEs (trials 3625 and 3627) and GI AEs (trials 3627, 4092 and 
3744) compared with 0.5 mg  
Although the population PK demonstrated an inverse relationship between body weight and 
semaglutide exposure, the weight of the patient is not reflected in the proposed posology of 
semaglutide. The treating physician can select one of two dose levels of semaglutide based on the 
degree of glycaemic control  
Pulse rate 
In the QTc study, the effect of semaglutide on the pulse rate appeared dose-dependent and was 
usually between 8 and 11 bpm. In the CVOT, this did not seem to result in an increased CV risk after a 
follow up of 2 years. When assessed by office measurements, semaglutide seems to antagonize the 
beta-blocker-induced pulse rate reduction. As beta-blockers were not a randomised treatment in the 
CVOT, the implications hereof cannot be assessed. Extrapolation of the CV outcome results to subjects 
without established CV disease remains difficult. In these subjects, the differences in office HR were 
larger than in the whole population. Therefore, the effects of a higher pulse in patients with relatively 
low CV risk are uncertain.  
Other 
In the phase 3a pool, 8 semaglutide-treated patients had events of pancreatitis and 3 events were 
confirmed in patients treated with exenatide ER, while no events were reported with placebo. In the 
CVOT, the number of patients with acute pancreatitis was comparable between semaglutide (8 
patients) and placebo (10 patients). With regard to GI disorders, there was a striking difference in 
Exocrine pancreas conditions. A total of 8 events belonging to this HLGT were registered among the 
semaglutide treated patients (R=0.4) as compared to none in the comparator group. Levels of serum 
lipase and amylase increased with semaglutide. In the absence of other signs or symptoms of 
pancreatitis, elevation of lipase and amylase levels seen with semaglutide did not predict a later 
development of pancreatitis. The lack of a dose-response or temporal clustering, weakens the 
assumption of a causal relationship with treatment. 
On the basis of PK data, the SmPC states that no dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic 
impairment. The clinical pharmacology trial (trial 3651) demonstrated that the exposure to 
semaglutide is similar in subjects with hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function. 
No data in diabetic patients are presented. Therefore, caution should be exercised in severe hepatic 
impairment, as there are no data presented on the use of GLP1-RAs in these patients. The SmPC 
states that the experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment is limited and that thus caution 
should be exercised when treating these patients. The text is considered adequate. Hepatic impairment 
is considered missing information in the RMP. 
Malignant neoplasms were equally distributed with semaglutide and placebo (HR: 0.94 [0.67; 
1.32]95%CI) in the CVOT with no apparent differences for any types of malignant neoplasms. In the 
phase 3a pool there were more malignant neoplasms (HR: 1.61 [0.74; 3.49]95%CI) with semaglutide 
than with comparators; however, numbers were low. There were no single types of malignant 
neoplasms driving this difference.

(56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important favourable effects observed were decreases in HbA1c and body weight in 
comparison to placebo and several active comparators. In addition, there were clinically relevant 
decreases in systolic blood pressure. Despite this improvement in glycaemic control, it is important for 
patients that semaglutide does not increase the risk of hypoglycaemia unless combined with either SU 
or insulin. 
The main goal in the treatment of diabetes is to reduce the progression of microvascular and 
macrovascular complications. It is therefore important that semaglutide had a favourable effect on 
non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke, but it is rather unexpected that the occurrence of CV death was 
similar with semaglutide and placebo. Based on biological plausibility it would have been expected that 
semaglutide treatment will beneficially influence all components in a similar way. Although the three 
individual components of the composite endpoint are clinically meaningful, CV death is considered 
more clinically relevant than non-fatal MI and non-fatal stroke. Importantly, the effect of semaglutide 
on several other important outcome measures was negative. Hospitalisation for heart failure, all-cause 
mortality, SAEs of coronary artery disease, SAEs of cardiac failure and vascular therapeutic procedures 
(particularly cardiac interventions) were higher with semaglutide than with placebo. The duration of 
the trial may have been too short to show positive effects on CV-death. Similarly heterogenous results 
have been observed for statins and PSK9-inhibitors. Results do not indicate that semaglutide has a 
beneficial or negative effect on CV-death and non-CV death. Heart failure is often due to non-
atherosclerotic pathomechanisms, while semaglutide most probably affects atherosclerosis. 
Furthermore, numbers are too small for a firm conclusion. For some Preferred Terms imbalances were 
seen, while no differences were observed for related PTs or high-level group terms. The explanation 
given by the Applicant for these discrepancies is considered acceptable. 
Treatment of 1648 patients with semaglutide in the CVOT resulted in a reduction in the number of 
major cardiovascular events of 38 (number needed to treat 45), but was also associated with an 
additional 21 events of serious retinopathy (number needed to harm 77). Therefore, retinopathy is 
considered a very important risk. The imbalance was observed for all four predefined components of 
the combined endpoint and was similar with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg, suggesting that the 
increased risk with semaglutide is a robust finding. Only for the subgroup of patients with diabetic 
retinopathy at baseline and treated with insulin, semaglutide was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of relevant retinopathy complications. In these patients, the number needed to treat is

17 for MACE, whereas the corresponding number needed to harm is 29 for diabetic retinopathy 
complications. Among patients without pre-existing diabetic retinopathy or insulin use, the frequency 
of diabetic retinopathy complications was low and similar with semaglutide and placebo (number 
needed to treat 61, number needed to harm 456). 
In line with semaglutide, exenatide has also been associated with (transient) worsening of diabetic 
retinopathy in a case series (Varadhan et al. Diabetes Res Clin Pract. 2014;103(3):e37-9). In addition, 
in the liraglutide CVOT (Victoza, procedure EMEA/H/C/001026/II/0042), the HR for the composite 
endpoint reflecting diabetic retinopathy complications, although not statistically significant, disfavoured 
liraglutide (HR: 1.15 [0.87; 1.52] 95%CI, p=0.33). 
In type 1 diabetes, a rapid improvement of glycaemic control is thought to be associated with 
progression of diabetic retinopathy. However, contrary to this experience, the increased risk of 
retinopathy with semaglutide does not decrease in the course of the 2 year trial. This is worrisome and 
suggests that other mechanisms than rapid glucose lowering may play a role. Moreover, semaglutide 
was associated with retinopathy in patients with only small HbA1c reductions. Thus, a persistent 
deleterious effect of semaglutide on the retina independent of glucose lowering cannot be excluded. 
Observations do not permit definite conclusions regarding the underlying mechanism of action. The 
occurrence of early worsening in patients with only small reductions in HbA1C remains unexplained. 
However, it is agreed that net clinical benefit over time due to improved glycaemic control is likely. A 
long-term PASS study will be conducted to examine this. In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled 
study, the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy in terms of ≥2 steps ETDRS 
progression in either eye at year 5 is suggested to be studied in approximately 1000 patients with 
inadequately controlled T2D (e.g. defined as an HbA1c ≥7.5%) treated with semaglutide once-weekly 
versus placebo once-weekly, both added to standard-of-care. In addition, the Applicant has added a 
warning in section 4.4, similar to that in the product information of insulins. The primary endpoint will 
be proportion of patients with diabetic retinopathy at five years. However, time-to-event or similar 
endpoints elucidating the time-response were advised to be included as secondary endpoint(s). 
Treatment effects on CV outcomes were absent for patients with chronic heart failure class II-III and 
lower for patients using insulin treatment at baseline. The Applicant emphasizes that effects on HbA1c, 
body weight and systolic blood pressure were seen in these subjects. For use of insulin at baseline, the 
populations of subjects using insulin at baseline are similar in terms of demography and CV history. 
Subgroups were small, and it is unlikely that there is a true difference in effects on MACE in subjects 
with T2D using premix or basal insulin at baseline. 
Although the gastrointestinal adverse events with semaglutide were typically of limited duration and 
are reversible after stopping treatment, it is important that the percentage of patients that 
prematurely discontinued semaglutide because of GI AEs was relatively large. Patients with a higher 
exposure to semaglutide had more GI AEs than patients with a lower semaglutide exposure. Dose 
finding studies suggest that a lower dose selection might have been associated with acceptable efficacy 
outcomes and lower rates of premature discontinuation. In addition, it is possible that a 12 week dose 
escalation regimen (instead of 8 weeks) might have improved the GI tolerability and reduced 
withdrawals.  
There is no unequivocal evidence for a better benefit/risk profile with semaglutide maintenance doses 
of 0.5 and 1.0 mg in the phase 3 trials as compared to 0.4 and 0.8 mg. The confirmatory trials have 
demonstrated that maintenance doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg have a positive benefit/risk profile. Both dose 
levels of semaglutide can be safe and efficacious and should be based on individual needs. The 1.0 mg 
dose is associated with an increased risk of side effects. Patients with low body weight may experience

more gastrointestinal side effects when treated with semaglutide. This is mentioned in Section 4.8 of 
the SmPC.  
The higher incidence of adverse events with the 1.0 mg dose could be acceptable if the additional 
efficacy of semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. 0.5 mg is clinically relevant. However, in the studies treatment 
differences were rather small. Therefore, the Applicant was invited to explain the clinical relevance of 
the differences. If the differences are clinically relevant, it is important to provide information about 
tapering off the 1 mg maintenance dose to 0.5 mg when the 1.0 mg is not tolerated. The Applicant 
reasons that, as the semaglutide 1.0 mg maintenance dose is reached by stepwise progression from 
0.25 to 0.5 mg, patients must first have demonstrated that they can tolerate the 0.5 mg dose before 
being dose-escalated to 1.0 mg. Thus, lowering the semaglutide dose from 1.0 mg to 0.5 mg may be 
carried out at discretion of the treating physician if deemed appropriate.  
It is unknown how much of the weight loss is associated with GI AEs. There is little doubt that 
semaglutide is associated with GI AE and these include nausea and vomiting. The frequency and 
severity is reduced by titrating the dose over an 8 week period, but the largest observed weight loss 
coincides with the treatment period where GI AEs are also most pronounced.  
Previous studies have shown that liraglutide is associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis and 
cholecystitis. In addition, in the liraglutide CVOT malignant pancreatic neoplasms were confirmed in 13 
patients in the liraglutide group and 5 in the placebo group. Semaglutide may also be associated with 
an increased risk of cholelithiasis, and the effect of semaglutide on pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer 
cannot be excluded. Observations indicate that semaglutide use may be related to cholelithiasis. 
Absolute numbers are small. Cholelithiasis is adequately listed as a common adverse reaction in the 
SmPC and as an important identified risk in the RMP. Pancreatic cancer is listed as an important 
potential risk in the RMP. The risks may be small, but risks may be higher with longer term use of 
semaglutide which may have serious consequences. 
The effect of semaglutide on the pulse rate did not seem to result in an increased CV risk after a follow 
up of 2 years in high CV risk patients. However, the effects of a higher pulse in patients with relatively 
low CV risk are uncertain.  
For a drug that is intended for long term diabetes treatment, the duration of the CVOT (2 years) is 
relatively short (also in comparison to several other cardiovascular outcome trials). Long term follow 
up based on a comprehensive RMP is important. In addition, the inclusion of individuals with a high CV 
risk in the CVOT may limit generalizability to the general diabetic population (in the CVOT a number of 
subjects were included with risk factors “only”. In these subjects, no effect on MACE was seen, but the 
numbers were too small to draw firm conclusions, with 10 events with semaglutide and 9 events with 
placebo). This is an important knowledge gap for low risk patients.  
Semaglutide was not compared to SU. SU is considered the next step after metformin by many 
guidelines and doctors. Therefore, the lack of a trial comparing semaglutide with SU may be 
considered important. However, in the CVOT, the patients in the placebo group were treated in 
accordance with the standard of care, including SU. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Semaglutide was studied in a number of placebo- and comparator-controlled trials. The most important 
favourable effects observed were considerable decreases in HbA1c and body weight in comparison to 
placebo and several active comparators. Except for the combination with sulphonylurea or insulin, 
improved glycaemic control was achieved without an increase of the risk of hypoglycaemia.

Gastrointestinal adverse events were frequent and clinically relevant, but expected with this product 
class. Semaglutide may be linked to an increased risk of cholelithiasis, and an association with 
pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer cannot be excluded. Semaglutide was also studied in a separate 
cardiovascular outcome trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and a high cardiovascular risk; 
semaglutide showed a beneficial effect on some outcomes relevant to macrovascular disease, but the 
effect was neutral with regard to cardiovascular death and death from any cause. Events of serious 
retinopathy were more frequent with semaglutide use, and mostly seen in patients with diabetic 
retinopathy at baseline and treated with insulin. This will be further investigated in a long-term, large 
scale post authorisation study. On balance, the described benefits therefore outweigh the risks for the 
indicated patient population with type 2 diabetes.   
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk balance of Ozempic is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome  
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Ozempic is favourable in the following indication: 
Treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise 
•  as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or 
contraindications 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. 
• 
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and cardiovascular events, 
and the populations studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
Assessment report

within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that semaglutide is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European 
Union. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0095/2015 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

database, the increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in breast and 
lung cancer patients receiving lipegfilgrastim treatment in 
conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy was 
assessed. 
In an observational post-marketing study, MDS and AML 
were associated with the use of pegfilgrastim, another 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), in 
combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in 
breast and lung cancer patients. A similar association is not 
known between lipegfilgrastim and MDS/AML. 
Nevertheless, patients with breast cancer and patients with 
lung cancer should be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
MDS/AML.

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Lonquex in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
The Product Information was updated combining the two 
separate SmPCs for the PFS and vial presentations and is 
also brought in line with the latest QRD template.

Extension of indication to include treatment of the 
PL 
and introduction of an age-appropriate presentation in 
Labelling and 
indication to paediatric patients (2 years of age and older) 
paediatric population for Lonquex and introduction of 
an age appropriate presentation in vials; as a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of 
the SmPC were updated. The Package Leaflet was 
updated in accordance. Version 14.1 of the RMP has 
also been agreed. In addition, the Marketing 
authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
update the list of local representatives in the 
vials.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Lonquex in the approved indication remains favourable, but 
recommended that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the following pharmacovigilance 
grounds: 
The currently ongoing imposed post-authorisation safety 
study XM22-ONC-40041 to further investigate the risks of 
disease progression and mortality associated with Lonquex 
in patients with malignancy treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy is key to the benefit-risk profile of the 
product. The final report for this study is due in December 
2018. 
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Lonquex, which 
requires the submission of yearly PSURs, the CHMP 
concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years’ time. 
In addition, sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC were updated 
to mention that events of glomerulonephritis have been 
reported in patients receiving filgrastim or pegfilgrastim 
and that these events generally, resolved after dose 
reduction or withdrawal of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. 
Urinalysis monitoring is recommended. The package leaflet 
has been amended accordingly.

variation to update SmPC and PIL for lipegfilgrastim to 
include warnings and information on CLS. Sections 4.4 and 
4.8 of the SmPC have been updated to include that CLS, 
which can be life threatening if treatment is delayed, has 
been reported mostly in cancer patients undergoing 
chemotherapy after administration of G-CSF or derivatives. 
Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome 
should be closely monitored and receive standard 
symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for

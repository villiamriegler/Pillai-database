Chronic kidney disease
Jardiance is indicated in adults for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
Type 2 diabetes mellitus
The recommended starting dose is 10 mg empagliflozin once daily for monotherapy and add-on 
combination therapy with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. In patients tolerating 
empagliflozin 10 mg once daily who have an eGFR ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and need tighter glycaemic 
control, the dose can be increased to 25 mg once daily. The maximum daily dose is 25 mg (see below 
and section 4.4).
Heart failure
The recommended dose is 10 mg empagliflozin once daily.
Chronic kidney disease
The recommended dose is 10 mg empagliflozin once daily.
All indications
When empagliflozin is used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the 
sulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see sections 4.5 and 
4.8).
If a dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as the patient remembers; however, a double dose 
should not be taken on the same day.
Special populations
Renal impairment
Due to limited experience, it is not recommended to initiate treatment with empagliflozin in patients 
with an eGFR <20 ml/min/1.73 m2.
In patients with an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 the daily dose of empagliflozin is 10 mg. 
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the glucose lowering efficacy of empagliflozin is reduced in 
patients with an eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 and likely absent in patients with an eGFR 
<30 ml/min/1.73 m2. Therefore, if eGFR falls below 45 ml/min/1.73 m2, additional glucose lowering 
treatment should be considered if needed (see sections 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment. Empagliflozin exposure is 
increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therapeutic experience in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment is limited and therefore not recommended for use in this population (see section 
5.2).
Elderly
No dose adjustment is recommended based on age. In patients 75 years and older, an increased risk for 
volume depletion should be taken into account (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
3
Paediatric population
The recommended starting dose is 10 mg empagliflozin once daily. In patients tolerating 
empagliflozin 10 mg once daily and requiring additional glycaemic control, the dose can be increased 
to 25 mg once daily (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). No data are available for children with eGFR <60 
ml/min/1.73 m² and children below 10 years of age. 
The safety and efficacy of empagliflozin for the treatment of heart failure or for the treatment of
chronic kidney disease in children under 18 years of age have not been established. No data are 
available.
Method of administration
The tablets can be taken with or without food, swallowed whole with water. 
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
General 
Empagliflozin should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (see “Ketoacidosis” in 
section 4.4).
Ketoacidosis
Cases of ketoacidosis, including life-threatening and fatal cases, have been reported in patients with 
diabetes mellitus treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. In a number of cases, the 
presentation of the condition was atypical with only moderately increased blood glucose values, below 
14 mmol/l (250 mg/dl). It is not known if ketoacidosis is more likely to occur with higher doses of 
empagliflozin. Although ketoacidosis is less likely to occur in patients without diabetes mellitus, cases 
have also been reported in these patients.
The risk of ketoacidosis must be considered in the event of non-specific symptoms such as nausea, 
vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual fatigue 
or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed for ketoacidosis immediately if these symptoms occur, 
regardless of blood glucose level.
In patients where ketoacidosis is suspected or diagnosed, treatment with empagliflozin should be 
discontinued immediately. 
Treatment should be interrupted in patients who are hospitalised for major surgical procedures or acute 
serious medical illnesses. Monitoring of ketones is recommended in these patients. Measurement of 
blood ketone levels is preferred to urine. Treatment with empagliflozin may be restarted when the 
ketone values are normal and the patient’s condition has stabilised.
Before initiating empagliflozin, factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis
should be considered.
Patients who may be at higher risk of ketoacidosis include patients with a low beta-cell function 
reserve (e.g. type 2 diabetes patients with low C-peptide or latent autoimmune diabetes in adults 
(LADA) or patients with a history of pancreatitis), patients with conditions that lead to restricted food 
intake or severe dehydration, patients for whom insulin doses are reduced and patients with increased 
insulin requirements due to acute medical illness, surgery or alcohol abuse. SGLT2 inhibitors should 
be used with caution in these patients. 
4
Restarting SGLT2 inhibitor treatment in patients with previous ketoacidosis while on SGLT2 inhibitor 
treatment is not recommended, unless another clear precipitating factor is identified and resolved.
Jardiance should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes. Data from a clinical trial program in 
patients with type 1 diabetes showed increased ketoacidosis occurrence with common frequency in 
patients treated with empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg as an adjunct to insulin compared to placebo.
Renal impairment
Due to limited experience, it is not recommended to initiate treatment with empagliflozin in patients
with an eGFR <20 ml/min/1.73 m2.
In patients with an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 the daily dose of empagliflozin is 10 mg (see section 
4.2).
The glucose lowering efficacy of empagliflozin is dependent on renal function, and is reduced in 
patients with an eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 and is likely absent in patients with an eGFR 
<30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (see section 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2). 
Monitoring of renal function
Assessment of renal function is recommended as follows:
-
Prior to empagliflozin initiation and periodically during treatment, i.e. at least yearly (see 
sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2).
Prior to initiation of any concomitant medicinal product that may have a negative impact on 
renal function.
-
Risk for volume depletion
Based on the mode of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, osmotic diuresis accompanying glucosuria may 
lead to a modest decrease in blood pressure (see section 5.1). Therefore, caution should be exercised in 
patients for whom an empagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could pose a risk, such as patients 
with known cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of 
hypotension or patients aged 75 years and older.
In case of conditions that may lead to fluid loss (e.g. gastrointestinal illness), careful monitoring of 
volume status (e.g. physical examination, blood pressure measurements, laboratory tests including 
haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving empagliflozin. Temporary 
interruption of treatment with empagliflozin should be considered until the fluid loss is corrected.
Elderly 
The effect of empagliflozin on urinary glucose excretion is associated with osmotic diuresis, which 
could affect the hydration status. Patients aged 75 years and older may be at an increased risk of 
volume depletion. A higher number of these patients treated with empagliflozin had adverse reactions 
related to volume depletion as compared to placebo (see section 4.8). Therefore, special attention 
should be given to their volume intake in case of co-administered medicinal products which may lead 
to volume depletion (e.g. diuretics, ACE inhibitors).
Complicated urinary tract infections
Cases of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis and urosepsis have been 
reported in patients treated with empagliflozin (see section 4.8). Temporary interruption of 
empagliflozin should be considered in patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
5
Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier’s gangrene)
Cases of necrotising fasciitis of the perineum, (also known as Fournier’s gangrene), have been 
reported in female and male patients with diabetes mellitus taking SGLT2 inhibitors. This is a rare but 
serious and potentially life-threatening event that requires urgent surgical intervention and antibiotic 
treatment.
Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience a combination of symptoms of 
pain, tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, with fever or malaise. Be aware 
that either uro-genital infection or perineal abscess may precede necrotising fasciitis. If Fournier´s 
gangrene is suspected, Jardiance should be discontinued and prompt treatment (including antibiotics 
and surgical debridement) should be instituted.
Lower limb amputations
An increase in cases of lower limb amputation (primarily of the toe) has been observed in long-term 
clinical studies with another SGLT2 inhibitor. It is unknown whether this constitutes a class effect. 
Like for all diabetic patients it is important to counsel patients on routine preventative foot-care.
Hepatic injury
Cases of hepatic injury have been reported with empagliflozin in clinical trials. A causal relationship 
between empagliflozin and hepatic injury has not been established.
Elevated haematocrit
Haematocrit increase was observed with empagliflozin treatment (see section 4.8).
Chronic kidney disease
Patients with albuminuria may benefit more from treatment with empagliflozin.
Infiltrative disease or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
Patients with infiltrative disease or with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy have not been specifically studied. 
Therefore, efficacy in these patients has not been established.
Urine laboratory assessments
Due to its mechanism of action, patients taking Jardiance will test positive for glucose in their urine.
Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) assay
Monitoring glycaemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1,5-AG are 
unreliable in assessing glycaemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use of alternative 
methods to monitor glycaemic control is advised.
Lactose
The tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total 
lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.
Sodium
Each tablet contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg), that is to say essentially ‘sodium free’.

4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Pharmacodynamic interactions
Diuretics
Empagliflozin may add to the diuretic effect of thiazide and loop diuretics and may increase the risk of 
dehydration and hypotension (see section 4.4).
Insulin and insulin secretagogues
Insulin and insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas, may increase the risk of hypoglycaemia. 
Therefore, a lower dose of insulin or an insulin secretagogue may be required to reduce the risk of 
hypoglycaemia when used in combination with empagliflozin (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).
Pharmacokinetic interactions
Effects of other medicinal products on empagliflozin
In vitro data suggest that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is 
glucuronidation by uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronosyltransferases UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and 
UGT2B7. Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3, OATP1B1, and 
OATP1B3, but not OAT1 and OCT2. Empagliflozin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast 
cancer resistance protein (BCRP).
Co-administration of empagliflozin with probenecid, an inhibitor of UGT enzymes and OAT3, 
resulted in a 26% increase in peak empagliflozin plasma concentrations (Cmax) and a 53% increase in 
area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). These changes were not considered to be clinically 
meaningful. 
The effect of UGT induction (e.g. induction by rifampicin or phenytoin) on empagliflozin has not been 
studied. Co-treatment with known inducers of UGT enzymes is not recommended due to a potential 
risk of decreased efficacy. If an inducer of these UGT enzymes must be co-administered, monitoring 
of glycaemic control to assess response to Jardiance is appropriate.
An interaction study with gemfibrozil, an in vitro inhibitor of OAT3 and OATP1B1/1B3 transporters, 
showed that empagliflozin Cmax increased by 15% and AUC increased by 59% following co-
administration. These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful.
Inhibition of OATP1B1/1B3 transporters by co-administration with rifampicin resulted in a 75% 
increase in Cmax and a 35% increase in AUC of empagliflozin. These changes were not considered to 
be clinically meaningful.
Empagliflozin exposure was similar with and without co-administration with verapamil, a P-gp 
inhibitor, indicating that inhibition of P-gp does not have any clinically relevant effect on 
empagliflozin.
Interaction studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin were not influenced by co-
administration with metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, warfarin, verapamil, 
ramipril, simvastatin, torasemide and hydrochlorothiazide.
Effects of empagliflozin on other medicinal products
Empagliflozin may increase renal lithium excretion and the blood lithium levels may be decreased. 
Serum concentration of lithium should be monitored more frequently after empagliflozin initiation and 
dose changes. Please refer the patient to the lithium prescribing doctor in order to monitor serum 
concentration of lithium.
Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin does not inhibit, inactivate, or induce CYP450 isoforms. 
Empagliflozin does not inhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT2B7. Drug-drug 
7
interactions involving the major CYP450 and UGT isoforms with empagliflozin and concomitantly 
administered substrates of these enzymes are therefore considered unlikely.
Empagliflozin does not inhibit P-gp at therapeutic doses. Based on in vitro studies, empagliflozin is 
considered unlikely to cause interactions with active substances that are P-gp substrates. Co-
administration of digoxin, a P-gp substrate, with empagliflozin resulted in a 6% increase in AUC and 
14% increase in Cmax of digoxin. These changes were not considered to be clinically meaningful.
Empagliflozin does not inhibit human uptake transporters such as OAT3, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 
in vitro at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and, as such, drug-drug interactions with 
substrates of these uptake transporters are considered unlikely.
Interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers suggest that empagliflozin had no clinically 
relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glimepiride, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, 
linagliptin, simvastatin, warfarin, ramipril, digoxin, diuretics and oral contraceptives.
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no data from the use of empagliflozin in pregnant women. Animal studies show that 
empagliflozin crosses the placenta during late gestation to a very limited extent but do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to early embryonic development. However, animal 
studies have shown adverse effects on postnatal development (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Jardiance during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding
No data in humans are available on excretion of empagliflozin into milk. Available toxicological data 
in animals have shown excretion of empagliflozin in milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be 
excluded. Jardiance should not be used during breast-feeding.
Fertility
No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for Jardiance. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Jardiance has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised to 
take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines, in particular when 
Jardiance is used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or insulin.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Type 2 diabetes mellitus
A total of 15 582 patients with type 2 diabetes were included in clinical studies to evaluate the safety 
of empagliflozin, of which 10 004 patients received empagliflozin, either alone or in combination with 
metformin, a sulphonylurea, pioglitazone, DPP-4 inhibitors, or insulin.
8
In 6 placebo-controlled trials of 18 to 24 weeks duration, 3 534 patients were included of which 1 183 
were treated with placebo and 2 351 with empagliflozin. The overall incidence of adverse events in 
patients treated with empagliflozin was similar to placebo. The most frequently reported adverse 
reaction was hypoglycaemia when used with sulphonylurea or insulin (see description of selected 
adverse reactions).
Heart failure
The EMPEROR studies included patients with heart failure and either reduced ejection fraction 
(N=3 726) or preserved ejection fraction (N=5 985) treated with empagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. 
Approximately half of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The most frequent adverse reaction of 
the pooled EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved studies was volume depletion 
(empagliflozin 10 mg: 11.4%. placebo: 9.7%).
Chronic kidney disease
The EMPA-KIDNEY study included patients with chronic kidney disease (N = 6 609) treated with 
10 mg empagliflozin or placebo. About 44% of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The most 
frequent adverse events in the EMPA-KIDNEY study were gout (empagliflozin 7.0% vs placebo 
8.0%), and acute kidney injury (empagliflozin 2.8% vs placebo 3.5%) which were more frequently 
reported in patients on placebo.
The overall safety profile of empagliflozin was generally consistent across the studied indications.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions classified by system organ class and MedDRA preferred terms reported in patients 
who received empagliflozin in placebo-controlled studies are presented in the table below (Table 1).
The adverse reactions are listed by absolute frequency. Frequencies are defined as very common
(≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000), or 
very rare (<1/10 000), and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions
Hypoglycaemia
The frequency of hypoglycaemia depended on the background therapy in the respective studies and 
was similar for empagliflozin and placebo as monotherapy, add-on to metformin, add-on to 
pioglitazone with or without metformin, as add-on to linagliptin and metformin, and as adjunct to 
standard care therapy and for the combination of empagliflozin with metformin in drug-naïve patients 
compared to those treated with empagliflozin and metformin as individual components. An increased 
frequency was noted when given as add-on to metformin and a sulphonylurea (empagliflozin 10 mg: 
16.1%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 11.5%, placebo: 8.4%), add-on to basal insulin with or without 
metformin and with or without a sulphonylurea (empagliflozin 10 mg: 19.5%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 
28.4%, placebo: 20.6% during initial 18 weeks treatment when insulin could not be adjusted; 
empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg: 36.1%, placebo 35.3% over the 78-week trial), and add-on to MDI 
insulin with or without metformin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 39.8%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 41.3%, 
placebo: 37.2% during initial 18 weeks treatment when insulin could not be adjusted; empagliflozin 
10 mg: 51.1%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 57.7%, placebo: 58% over the 52-week trial).
In the EMPEROR heart failure studies, similar frequency of hypoglycaemia was noted when used add-
on to sulphonylurea or insulin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 6.5%, placebo: 6.7%).
Major hypoglycaemia (events requiring assistance)
No increase in major hypoglycaemia was observed with empagliflozin compared to placebo as 
monotherapy, add-on to metformin, add-on to metformin and a sulphonylurea, add-on to pioglitazone 
with or without metformin, add-on to linagliptin and metformin, as adjunct to standard care therapy 
and for the combination of empagliflozin with metformin in drug-naïve patients compared to those 
treated with empagliflozin and metformin as individual components. An increased frequency was 
noted when given as add-on to basal insulin with or without metformin and with or without a 
sulphonylurea (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 1.3%, placebo: 0% during initial 
18 weeks treatment when insulin could not be adjusted; empagliflozin 10 mg: 0%, empagliflozin 
25 mg: 1.3%, placebo 0% over the 78-week trial), and add-on to MDI insulin with or without 
metformin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.5%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 0.5%, placebo: 0.5% during initial 
18 weeks treatment when insulin could not be adjusted; empagliflozin 10 mg: 1.6%, empagliflozin
25 mg: 0.5%, placebo: 1.6% over the 52-week trial).
In the EMPEROR heart failure studies, major hypoglycaemia was observed at similar frequencies in 
patients with diabetes mellitus when treated with empagliflozin and placebo as add-on to 
sulphonylurea or insulin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 2.2%, placebo: 1.9%).
Vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infection
Vaginal moniliasis, vulvovaginitis, balanitis and other genital infections were reported more 
frequently in patients treated with empagliflozin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 4.0%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 
3.9%) compared to placebo (1.0%). These infections were reported more frequently in females treated 
with empagliflozin compared to placebo, and the difference in frequency was less pronounced in 
males. The genital tract infections were mild or moderate in intensity.
In the EMPEROR heart failure studies, the frequency of these infections was more pronounced in 
patients with diabetes mellitus (empagliflozin 10 mg: 2.3%; placebo: 0.8%) than in patients without 
diabetes mellitus (empagliflozin 10 mg: 1.7%; placebo: 0.7%) when treated with empagliflozin 
compared to placebo.
Increased urination
Increased urination (including the predefined terms pollakiuria, polyuria, and nocturia) was observed 
at higher frequencies in patients treated with empagliflozin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 3.5%, empagliflozin 
25 mg: 3.3%) compared to placebo (1.4%). Increased urination was mostly mild or moderate in 
intensity. The frequency of reported nocturia was similar for placebo and empagliflozin (<1%).
11
In the EMPEROR heart failure studies, increased urination was observed at similar frequencies in 
patients treated with empagliflozin and placebo (empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.9%, placebo 0.5%).
Urinary tract infection
The overall frequency of urinary tract infection reported as adverse event was similar in patients 
treated with empagliflozin 25 mg and placebo (7.0% and 7.2%) and higher in empagliflozin 10 mg 
(8.8%). Similar to placebo, urinary tract infection was reported more frequently for empagliflozin in 
patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections. The intensity (mild, moderate, 
severe) of urinary tract infection was similar in patients treated with empagliflozin and placebo. 
Urinary tract infection was reported more frequently in females treated with empagliflozin compared 
to placebo; there was no difference in males. 
Volume depletion
The overall frequency of volume depletion (including the predefined terms blood pressure 
(ambulatory) decreased, blood pressure systolic decreased, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolaemia, 
orthostatic hypotension, and syncope) was similar in patients treated with empagliflozin 
(empagliflozin 10 mg: 0.6%, empagliflozin 25 mg: 0.4%) and placebo (0.3%). The frequency of 
volume depletion events was increased in patients 75 years and older treated with empagliflozin 10 mg 
(2.3%) or empagliflozin 25 mg (4.3%) compared to placebo (2.1%).
Blood creatinine increased/Glomerular filtration rate decreased 
The overall frequency of patients with increased blood creatinine and decreased glomerular filtration 
rate were similar between empagliflozin and placebo (blood creatinine increased: empagliflozin 10 mg 
0.6%, empagliflozin 25 mg 0.1%, placebo 0.5%; glomerular filtration rate decreased: empagliflozin 
10 mg 0.1%, empagliflozin 25 mg 0%, placebo 0.3%).
Initial increases in creatinine and initial decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rates in patients 
treated with empagliflozin were generally transient during continuous treatment or reversible after 
drug discontinuation of treatment.
Consistently, in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, patients treated with empagliflozin experienced 
an initial fall in eGFR (mean: 3 ml/min/1.73 m2). Thereafter, eGFR was maintained during continued 
treatment. Mean eGFR returned to baseline after treatment discontinuation suggesting acute 
haemodynamic changes may play a role in these renal function changes. This phenomenon is also 
observed in the EMPEROR heart failure studies and the EMPA-KIDNEY study.
12
Serum lipids increased
Mean percent increases from baseline for empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg versus placebo, 
respectively, were total cholesterol 4.9% and 5.7% versus 3.5%; HDL-cholesterol 3.3% and 3.6% 
versus 0.4 %; LDL-cholesterol 9.5% and 10.0% versus 7.5%; triglycerides 9.2% and 9.9% versus 
10.5%.
Haematocrit increased
Mean changes from baseline in haematocrit were 3.4% and 3.6% for empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg, 
respectively, compared to 0.1% for placebo. In the EMPA-REG Outcome study, haematocrit values 
returned towards baseline values after a follow-up period of 30 days after treatment stop.
Paediatric population
In the DINAMO trial 157 children aged 10 years and above with type 2 diabetes were treated, in 
which 52 patients received empagliflozin, 52 linagliptin and 53 placebo (see section 5.1).
During the placebo-controlled phase, the most frequent adverse drug reaction was hypoglycaemia with 
higher overall rates for patients in the empagliflozin pooled group compared with placebo
(empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg, pooled: 23.1%, placebo: 9.4%). None of these events was severe or 
required assistance.
Overall, the safety profile in children was similar to the safety profile in adults with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
In controlled clinical studies single doses of up to 800 mg empagliflozin in healthy volunteers and 
multiple daily doses of up to 100 mg empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes did not show any 
toxicity. Empagliflozin increased urine glucose excretion leading to an increase in urine volume. The 
observed increase in urine volume was not dose-dependent and is not clinically meaningful. There is 
no experience with doses above 800 mg in humans.
Therapy
In the event of an overdose, treatment should be initiated as appropriate to the patient‘s clinical status. 
The removal of empagliflozin by haemodialysis has not been studied.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors, ATC code: A10BK03
13
Mechanism of action
Empagliflozin is a reversible, highly potent (IC50 of 1.3 nmol) and selective competitive inhibitor of 
sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). Empagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters 
important for glucose transport into peripheral tissues and is 5 000 times more selective for SGLT2 
versus SGLT1, the major transporter responsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly 
expressed in the kidney, whereas expression in other tissues is absent or very low. It is responsible, as 
the predominant transporter, for the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the 
circulation. In patients with type 2 diabetes and hyperglycaemia a higher amount of glucose is filtered 
and reabsorbed.
Empagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes by reducing renal glucose 
reabsorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuretic mechanism is 
dependent on blood glucose concentration and GFR. Inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with type 2 
diabetes and hyperglycaemia leads to excess glucose excretion in the urine. In addition, initiation of 
empagliflozin increases excretion of sodium resulting in osmotic diuresis and reduced intravascular 
volume.
In patients with type 2 diabetes, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following the first 
dose of empagliflozin and is continuous over the 24 hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose 
excretion was maintained at the end of the 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately 
78 g/day. Increased urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose 
levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Empagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. The mechanism of 
action of empagliflozin is independent of beta cell function and insulin pathway and this contributes to 
a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta cell function including 
Homeostasis Model Assessment-β (HOMA-β) was noted. In addition, urinary glucose excretion 
triggers calorie loss, associated with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed 
with empagliflozin is accompanied by diuresis which may contribute to sustained and moderate 
reduction of blood pressure.
Empagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal 
tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to: increasing 
tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing intraglomerular pressure, lowering both pre- and afterload of 
the heart, downregulating of sympathetic activity and reducing left ventricular wall stress as evidenced 
by lower NT-proBNP values which may have beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling, filling 
pressures and diastolic function as well as preserving kidney structure and function. Other effects such 
as an increase in haematocrit, a reduction in body weight and blood pressure may further contribute to 
the beneficial cardiac and renal effects. 
Clinical efficacy and safety
Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Both improvement of glycaemic control and reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are 
an integral part of the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
Glycaemic efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes have been assessed in a total of 14 663 patients with 
type 2 diabetes who were treated in 12 double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical studies, of 
which 9 295 received empagliflozin (empagliflozin 10 mg: 4 165 patients; empagliflozin 25 mg: 5 130
patients). Five studies had treatment durations of 24 weeks; extensions of those and other studies had 
patients exposed to empagliflozin for up to 102 weeks.
Treatment with empagliflozin as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, pioglitazone, a 
sulphonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitors, and insulin lead to clinically relevant improvements in HbA1c, 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Administration 
of empagliflozin 25 mg resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving HbA1c goal of less than 
14
7% and fewer patients needing glycaemic rescue compared to empagliflozin 10 mg and placebo. 
Higher baseline HbA1c was associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c. In addition, empagliflozin 
as adjunct to standard care therapy reduced cardiovascular mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes 
and established cardiovascular disease.
Monotherapy
The efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as monotherapy was evaluated in a double-blind, 
placebo- and active-controlled study of 24 weeks duration in treatment-naïve patients. Treatment with 
empagliflozin resulted in a statistically significant (p<0.0001) reduction in HbA1c compared to 
placebo (Table 2) and a clinically meaningful decrease in FPG.
In a pre-specified analysis of patients (N=201) with a baseline HbA1c ≥8.5%, treatment resulted in a 
reduction in HbA1c from baseline of -1.44% for empagliflozin 10 mg, -1.43% for empagliflozin
25 mg, -1.04% for sitagliptin, and an increase of 0.01% for placebo. 
In the double-blind placebo-controlled extension of this study, reductions of HbA1c, body weight and 
blood pressure were sustained up to Week 76.

In combination with metformin in drug-naïve patients
A factorial design study of 24 weeks duration was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
empagliflozin in drug-naïve patients. Treatment with empagliflozin in combination with metformin 
(5 mg and 500 mg; 5 mg and 1 000 mg; 12.5 mg and 500 mg, and 12.5 mg and 1 000 mg given twice 
daily) provided statistically significant improvements in HbA1c (Table 4) and led to greater reductions 
in FPG (compared to the individual components) and body weight (compared to metformin).

Empagliflozin 24 months data, as add-on to metformin in comparison to glimepiride
In a study comparing the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 25 mg versus glimepiride (up to 4 mg
per day) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin alone, treatment with 
empagliflozin daily resulted in superior reduction in HbA1c (Table 6), and a clinically meaningful 
reduction in FPG, compared to glimepiride. Empagliflozin daily resulted in a statistically significant 
reduction in body weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a statistically significantly lower 
proportion of patients with hypoglycaemic events compared to glimepiride (2.5% for empagliflozin, 
24.2% for glimepiride, p<0.0001).

Add-on to insulin therapy
Empagliflozin as add-on to multiple daily insulin
The efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as add-on to multiple daily insulin with or without 
concomitant metformin therapy was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 52 weeks 
duration. During the initial 18 weeks and the last 12 weeks, the insulin dose was kept stable, but was 
adjusted to achieve pre-prandial glucose levels <100 mg/dl [5.5 mmol/l], and post-prandial glucose 
levels <140 mg/dl [7.8 mmol/l] between Weeks 19 and 40. 
At Week 18, empagliflozin provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c compared with 
placebo (Table 7). 
At Week 52, treatment with empagliflozin resulted in a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c and 
insulin sparing compared with placebo and a reduction in FPG and body weight.

Empagliflozin as add-on to basal insulin
The efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as add-on to basal insulin with or without metformin and/or a 
sulphonylurea was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 78 weeks duration. During 
the initial 18 weeks the insulin dose was kept stable, but was adjusted to achieve a FPG <110 mg/dl in 
the following 60 weeks. 
At week 18, empagliflozin provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c (Table 8).
At 78 weeks, empagliflozin resulted in a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c and insulin sparing 
compared to placebo. Furthermore, empagliflozin resulted in a reduction in FPG, body weight, and 
blood pressure.

Patients with renal impairment, 52 week placebo controlled data
The efficacy and safety of empagliflozin as add-on to antidiabetic therapy was evaluated in patients 
with renal impairment in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study for 52 weeks. Treatment with 
empagliflozin led to a statistically significant reduction of HbA1c (Table 9) and clinically meaningful 
improvement in FPG compared to placebo at Week 24. The improvement in HbA1c, body weight, and 
blood pressure was sustained up to 52 weeks.

Cardiovascular outcome
The double-blind, placebo-controlled EMPA-REG OUTCOME study compared pooled doses of 
empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg with placebo as adjunct to standard care therapy in patients with 
type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. A total of 7 020 patients were treated 
(empagliflozin 10 mg: 2 345, empagliflozin 25 mg: 2 342, placebo: 2 333) and followed for a median 
of 3.1 years. The mean age was 63 years, the mean HbA1c was 8.1%, and 71.5% were male. At 
baseline, 74% of patients were being treated with metformin, 48% with insulin, and 43% with a 
sulphonylurea. About half of the patients (52.2%) had an eGFR of 60-90 ml/min/1.73 m2, 17.8% of 
45-60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 7.7% of 30-45 ml/min/1.73 m2.
At week 12, an adjusted mean (SE) improvement in HbA1c when compared to baseline of 0.11% 
(0.02) in the placebo group, 0.65% (0.02) and 0.71% (0.02) in the empagliflozin 10 and 25 mg groups 
was observed. After the first 12 weeks glycaemic control was optimized independent of investigative 
treatment. Therefore the effect was attenuated at week 94, with an adjusted mean (SE) improvement in 
HbA1c of 0.08% (0.02) in the placebo group, 0.50% (0.02) and 0.55% (0.02) in the empagliflozin 
10 and 25 mg groups.
23
Empagliflozin was superior in preventing the primary combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, 
non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke, as compared with placebo. The treatment effect 
was driven by a significant reduction in cardiovascular death with no significant change in non-fatal 
myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. The reduction of cardiovascular death was comparable for 
empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg (Figure 1) and confirmed by an improved overall survival (Table 10).
The effect of empagliflozin on the primary combined endpoint of CV death, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal 
stroke was largely independent of glycaemic control or renal function (eGFR) and generally consistent 
across eGFR categories down to an eGFR of 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
study.
The efficacy for preventing cardiovascular mortality has not been conclusively established in patients 
using empagliflozin concomitantly with DPP-4 inhibitors or in Black patients because the 
representation of these groups in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study was limited.

Heart failure requiring hospitalisation 
In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, empagliflozin reduced the risk of heart failure requiring 
hospitalisation compared with placebo (empagliflozin 2.7 %; placebo 4.1 %; HR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.50, 
0.85).
Nephropathy
In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, for time to first nephropathy event, the HR was 0.61 (95 % CI 
0.53, 0.70) for empagliflozin (12.7 %) vs placebo (18.8 %).
In addition, empagliflozin showed a higher (HR 1.82, 95 % CI 1.40, 2.37) occurrence of sustained 
normo- or micro-albuminuria (49.7 %) in patients with baseline macro-albuminuria compared with 
placebo (28.8 %).
Fasting plasma glucose
In four placebo-controlled studies, treatment with empagliflozin as monotherapy or add-on therapy to 
metformin, pioglitazone, or metformin plus a sulphonylurea resulted in mean changes from baseline in 
FPG of -20.5 mg/dl [-1.14 mmol/l] for empagliflozin 10 mg and -23.2 mg/dl [-1.29 mmol/l] for 
empagliflozin 25 mg compared to placebo (7.4 mg/dl [0.41 mmol/l]). This effect was observed after 
24 weeks and maintained for 76 weeks.
2-hour post-prandial glucose
Treatment with empagliflozin as add-on to metformin or metformin and a sulphonylurea resulted in a 
clinically meaningful reduction of 2-hour post-prandial glucose (meal tolerance test) at 24 weeks 
(add-on to metformin: placebo +5.9 mg/dl, empagliflozin 10 mg: -46.0 mg/dl, empagliflozin
25 mg: -44.6 mg/dl, add-on to metformin and a sulphonylurea: placebo -2.3 mg/dl, empagliflozin 
10 mg: -35.7 mg/dl, empagliflozin 25 mg: -36.6 mg/dl).
Patients with high baseline HbA1c >10%
In a pre-specified pooled analysis of three phase 3 studies, treatment with open-label empagliflozin 
25 mg in patients with severe hyperglycaemia (N=184, mean baseline HbA1c 11.15%) resulted in a 
clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c from baseline of 3.27% at week 24; no placebo or 
empagliflozin 10 mg arms were included in these studies.
25
Body weight
In a pre-specified pooled analysis of 4 placebo-controlled studies, treatment with empagliflozin 
resulted in body weight reduction (-0.24 kg for placebo, -2.04 kg for empagliflozin 10 mg
and -2.26 kg for empagliflozin 25 mg) at week 24 that was maintained up to week 52 (-0.16 kg for 
placebo, -1.96 kg for empagliflozin 10 mg and -2.25 kg for empagliflozin 25 mg).
Blood pressure
The efficacy and safety of empagliflozin was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
12 weeks duration in patients with type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure on different antidiabetic 
and up to 2 antihypertensive therapies. Treatment with empagliflozin once daily resulted in 
statistically significant improvement in HbA1c, and 24 hour mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
as determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (Table 11). Treatment with empagliflozin 
provided reductions in seated SBP and DBP.

In a pre-specified pooled analysis of 4 placebo-controlled studies, treatment with empagliflozin 
resulted in a reduction in systolic blood pressure (empagliflozin 10 mg: -3.9 mmHg; empagliflozin 
25 mg: -4.3 mmHg) compared with placebo (-0.5 mmHg) and in diastolic blood pressure 
(empagliflozin 10 mg: -1.8 mmHg; empagliflozin 25 mg: -2.0 mmHg) compared with placebo 
(-0.5 mmHg) at week 24 that were maintained up to week 52.
26
Heart failure
Empagliflozin in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (EMPEROR-Reduced) was conducted in 3 730 
patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] II-IV) and reduced ejection 
fraction (LVEF ≤40%) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 10 mg once daily as 
adjunct to standard of care heart failure therapy. The primary endpoint was the time to adjudicated 
first event of either cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF). Occurrence 
of adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent) and eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr slope of change from baseline were 
included in the confirmatory testing. Heart Failure therapy at baseline included ACE 
inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (88.3%), beta
blockers (94.7%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (71.3%) and diuretics (95.0%).
A total of 1 863 patients were randomised to empagliflozin 10 mg (placebo: 1 867) and followed for a 
median of 15.7 months. The study population consisted of 76.1% men and 23.9% women with a mean 
age of 66.8 years (range: 25-94 years), 26.8% were 75 years of age or older. 70.5% of the study 
population were White, 18.0% Asian and 6.9% Black/African American. At randomisation, 75.1% of 
patients were NYHA class II, 24.4% were class III and 0.5% were class IV. The mean LVEF was 
27.5%. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 62.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 and the median urinary albumin to 
creatinine ratio (UACR) was 22 mg/g. About half of the patients (51.7%) had an eGFR of 
≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2, 24.1% of 45 to <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, 18.6% of 30 to <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 
5.3% 20 to <30 ml/min/1.73 m2. 
Empagliflozin was superior in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular 
death or hospitalisation for heart failure compared with placebo. Additionally, empagliflozin 
significantly reduced the risk of occurrence of HHF (first and recurrent), and significantly reduced the 
rate of eGFR decline (Table 12; Figure 2).

Empagliflozin in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (EMPEROR-Preserved) was conducted in 
5 988 patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV) and preserved ejection fraction (LVEF >40%) 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 10 mg once daily as adjunct to standard of care 
therapy. The primary endpoint was the time to adjudicated first event of either cardiovascular (CV) 
death or hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF). Occurrence of adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent), 
and eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr slope of change from baseline were included in the confirmatory testing. 
Baseline therapy included ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers/angiotensin receptor-
neprilysin inhibitor (80.7%), beta blockers (86.3%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (37.5%) 
and diuretics (86.2%).
A total of 2 997 patients were randomised to empagliflozin 10 mg (placebo: 2 991) and followed for a 
median of 26.2 months. The study population consisted of 55.3% men and 44.7% women with a mean 
age of 71.9 years (range: 22-100 years), 43.0% were 75 years of age or older. 75.9% of the study 
population were White, 13.8% Asian and 4.3% Black/African American. At randomisation, 81.5% of 
patients were NYHA class II, 18.1% were class III and 0.3% were class IV. The EMPEROR-
Preserved study population included patients with a LVEF <50% (33.1%), with a LVEF 50 to <60% 
(34.4%) and a LVEF ≥60% (32.5%). At baseline, the mean eGFR was 60.6 ml/min/1.73 m2 and the 
median urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) was 21 mg/g. About half of the patients (50.1%) 
had an eGFR of ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m2, 26.1% of 45 to <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, 18.6% of 30 to <45 
ml/min/1.73 m2 and 4.9% 20 to <30 ml/min/1.73 m2.

Empagliflozin was superior in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular 
death or hospitalisation for heart failure compared with placebo. Additionally, empagliflozin 
significantly reduced the risk of occurrence of HHF (first and recurrent), and significantly reduced the 
rate of eGFR decline (Table 13; Figure 3).

Chronic kidney disease
A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of empagliflozin 10 mg once daily (EMPA-
KIDNEY) was conducted in 6 609 patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR ≥20 -
<45 ml/min/1.73 m2; or eGFR ≥45 - <90 ml/min/1.73 m2 with urinary albumin to creatinine ratio 
(UACR) ≥200 mg/g) to assess cardio-renal outcomes as adjunct to standard of care therapy. The 
primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of kidney disease progression (sustained ≥40% 
eGFR decline from randomisation, sustained eGFR <10 ml/min/1.73 m², end-stage kidney disease, or 
renal death) or CV death. First occurrence of hospitalisation for heart failure or CV death, all-cause 
hospitalisation (first and recurrent), and all-cause mortality were included in the confirmatory testing. 
Baseline therapy included an appropriate use of a RAS-inhibitor (85.2% ACE inhibitor or angiotensin 
receptor blocker).
A total of 3 304 patients were randomised to empagliflozin 10 mg (placebo: 3 305) and followed for a 
median of 24.3 months. The study population consisted of 66.8% men and 33.2% women with a mean 
age of 63.3 years (range: 18-94 years), 23.0% were 75 years of age or older. 58.4% of the study 
population were White, 36.2% Asian and 4.0% Black/African American. 
At baseline, the mean eGFR was 37.3 ml/min/1.73 m2, 21.2% patients had an eGFR of 
≥45 ml/min/1.73 m2, 44.3% of 30 to <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 34.5% <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 including 
254 patients with an eGFR <20 ml/min /1.73 m2. The median UACR was 329 mg/g, 20.1% patients 
had an UACR <30 mg/g, 28.2% had an UACR 30 to ≤300 mg/g and 51.7% had an UACR >300 mg/g; 
41.1% of patients had an UACR <200 mg/g. Primary causes of CKD were diabetic 
30
nephropathy/diabetic kidney disease (31%), glomerular disease (25%), hypertensive/renovascular 
disease (22%) and other/unknown (22%).
Empagliflozin was superior in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of kidney disease 
progression or CV death compared with placebo (see Table 14). Additionally, empagliflozin 
significantly reduced the risk of all-cause hospitalisation (first and recurrent).

The results of the primary composite endpoint were generally consistent across the pre-specified 
subgroups, including eGFR categories, underlying cause of renal disease, diabetes status, or 
background use of RAS inhibitors. Treatment benefits were more clearly evident in patients with 
higher levels of albuminuria.
During treatment, eGFR decline over time was slower in the empagliflozin group compared to the 
placebo group (Figure 5). Empagliflozin slowed the annual rate of eGFR decline compared to placebo 
by 1.37 ml/min/1.73 m2/year (95% CI 1.16, 1.59), based on a pre-specified analysis of all eGFR 
measurements taken from the 2-month visit to the final follow-up visit. Patients treated with 
empagliflozin experienced an initial drop in eGFR which returned towards baseline after treatment 
discontinuation as demonstrated in several of the empagliflozin studies, supporting that 
haemodynamic changes play a role in the acute effects of empagliflozin on eGFR.

Paediatric population
Type 2 diabetes mellitus
The clinical efficacy and safety of empagliflozin (10 mg with a possible dose-increase to 25 mg) and 
linagliptin (5 mg) once daily has been studied in children and adolescents from 10 to 17 years of age 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a placebo-controlled study (DINAMO) over 26 weeks, with a safety 
extension period up to 52 weeks. Background therapies as adjunct to diet and exercise included 
metformin (51%), a combination of metformin and insulin (40.1%), insulin (3.2%), or none (5.7%). 
The adjusted mean change in HbA1c at week 26 between empagliflozin (N=52) and placebo (N=53) 
of -0.84% was clinically meaningful and statistically significant (95% CI -1.50, -0.19; p=0.0116). In 
addition, treatment with empagliflozin versus placebo resulted in a clinically meaningful adjusted 
mean change in FPG of -35.2 mg/dl (95% CI -58.6, -11.7) [-1.95 mmol/l (-3.25, -0.65)].
Heart failure and chronic kidney disease
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Jardiance in all subsets of the paediatric population in heart failure and in the treatment of chronic 
kidney disease (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption
The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin have been extensively characterised in healthy volunteers and 
patients with type 2 diabetes. After oral administration, empagliflozin was rapidly absorbed with peak 
33
plasma concentrations occurring at a median tmax of 1.5 hours post-dose. Thereafter, plasma 
concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow 
terminal phase. The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 1 870 nmol.h/l and 259 nmol/l with 
empagliflozin 10 mg and 4 740 nmol.h/l and 687 nmol/l with empagliflozin 25 mg once daily. 
Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose-proportional manner. The single-dose and 
steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters of empagliflozin were similar suggesting linear 
pharmacokinetics with respect to time. There were no clinically relevant differences in empagliflozin 
pharmacokinetics between healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes.
Administration of empagliflozin 25 mg after intake of a high-fat and high calorie meal resulted in 
slightly lower exposure; AUC decreased by approximately 16% and Cmax by approximately 37% 
compared to fasted condition. The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not 
considered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food.
Distribution
The apparent steady-state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73.8 l based on the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin solution to healthy 
volunteers, the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 37% and plasma protein binding was 
86%.
Biotransformation
No major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma and the most abundant
metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates (2-, 3-, and 6-O glucuronide). Systemic exposure of 
each metabolite was less than 10% of total drug-related material. In vitro studies suggested that the 
primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 
5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, and UGT1A9.
Elimination
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of 
empagliflozin was estimated to be 12.4 hours and apparent oral clearance was 10.6 l/hour. The 
inter-subject and residual variabilities for empagliflozin oral clearance were 39.1% and 35.8%, 
respectively. With once-daily dosing, steady-state plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were 
reached by the fifth dose. Consistent with the half-life, up to 22% accumulation, with respect to 
plasma AUC, was observed at steady-state. Following administration of an oral [14C]-empagliflozin 
solution to healthy volunteers, approximately 96% of the drug-related radioactivity was eliminated in 
faeces (41%) or urine (54%). The majority of drug-related radioactivity recovered in faeces was 
unchanged parent drug and approximately half of drug related radioactivity excreted in urine was 
unchanged parent drug.
Special populations
Renal impairment
In patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 - <90 ml/min/1.73 m2) and 
patients with kidney failure/end stage kidney disease (ESKD), AUC of empagliflozin increased by 
approximately 18%, 20%, 66%, and 48%, respectively compared to subjects with normal renal 
function. Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were similar in subjects with moderate renal impairment 
and kidney failure/ESKD compared to patients with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels of 
empagliflozin were roughly 20% higher in subjects with mild and severe renal impairment as 
compared to subjects with normal renal function. The population pharmacokinetic analysis showed 
that the apparent oral clearance of empagliflozin decreased with a decrease in eGFR leading to an 
increase in drug exposure.
34
Hepatic impairment
In subjects with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh 
classification, AUC of empagliflozin increased approximately by 23%, 47%, and 75% and Cmax by 
approximately 4%, 23%, and 48%, respectively, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.
Body Mass Index
Body mass index had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on 
the population pharmacokinetic analysis. In this analysis, AUC was estimated to be 5.82%, 10.4%, and 
17.3% lower in subjects with BMI of 30, 35, and 45 kg/m2, respectively, compared to subjects with a 
body mass index of 25 kg/m2.
Gender
Gender had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis.
Race
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, AUC was estimated to be 13.5% higher in Asians with a 
body mass index of 25 kg/m2 compared to non-Asians with a body mass index of 25 kg/m2.
Elderly 
Age did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin based on 
the population pharmacokinetic analysis.
Paediatric population
A paediatric Phase 1 study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of empagliflozin 
(5 mg, 10 mg and 25 mg) in children and adolescents ≥10 to <18 years of age with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. The observed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses were consistent with those 
found in adult subjects.
A paediatric Phase 3 study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (HbA1c change 
from baseline) of empagliflozin 10 mg with a possible dose-increase to 25 mg in children and 
adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The observed exposure-response 
relationship was overall comparable in adults and children and adolescents. Oral administration of 
empagliflozin resulted in an exposure within the range observed in adult patients. 
The observed geometric mean trough concentrations and geometric mean concentrations at 1.5 hours 
post-administration at steady state were 26.6 nmol/l and 308 nmol/l with empagliflozin 10 mg once 
daily and 67.0 nmol/l and 525 nmol/l with empagliflozin 25 mg once daily.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, genotoxicity, fertility and early embryonic development. 
In long term toxicity studies in rodents and dogs, signs of toxicity were observed at exposures greater 
than or equal to 10-times the clinical dose of empagliflozin. Most toxicity was consistent with 
secondary pharmacology related to urinary glucose loss and electrolyte imbalances including
decreased body weight and body fat, increased food consumption, diarrhoea, dehydration, decreased 
serum glucose and increases in other serum parameters reflective of increased protein metabolism and
gluconeogenesis, urinary changes such as polyuria and glucosuria, and microscopic changes including 
mineralisation in kidney and some soft and vascular tissues. Microscopic evidence of the effects of 
exaggerated pharmacology on the kidney observed in some species included tubular dilatation, and 
tubular and pelvic mineralisation at approximately 4-times the clinical AUC exposure of empagliflozin 
associated with the 25 mg dose.
35
Empagliflozin is not genotoxic.
In a 2 year carcinogenicity study, empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumours in female 
rats up to the highest dose of 700 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 72-times the 
maximal clinical AUC exposure to empagliflozin. In male rats, treatment-related benign vascular 
proliferative lesions (haemangiomas) of the mesenteric lymph node were observed at the highest dose, 
but not at 300 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 26-times the maximal clinical exposure 
to empagliflozin. Interstitial cell tumours in the testes were observed with a higher incidence in rats at 
300 mg/kg/day and above, but not at 100 mg/kg/day which corresponds to approximately 18-times the 
maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. Both tumours are common in rats and are unlikely to be 
relevant to humans.
Empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumours in female mice at doses up to 
1 000 mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 62-times the maximal clinical exposure to 
empagliflozin. Empagliflozin induced renal tumours in male mice at 1 000 mg/kg/day, but not at 300 
mg/kg/day, which corresponds to approximately 11-times the maximal clinical exposure to 
empagliflozin. The mode of action for these tumours is dependent on the natural predisposition of the 
male mouse to renal pathology and a metabolic pathway not reflective of humans. The male mouse 
renal tumours are considered not relevant to humans.
At exposures sufficiently in excess of exposure in humans after therapeutic doses, empagliflozin had 
no adverse effects on fertility or early embryonic development. Empagliflozin administered during the 
period of organogenesis was not teratogenic. Only at maternally toxic doses, empagliflozin also 
caused bent limb bones in the rat and increased embryofetal loss in the rabbit.
In pre- and postnatal toxicity studies in rats, reduced weight gain of offspring was observed at 
maternal exposures approximately 4-times the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. No such 
effect was seen at systemic exposure equal to the maximal clinical exposure to empagliflozin. The 
relevance of this finding to humans is unclear.
In a juvenile toxicity study in the rat, when empagliflozin was administered from postnatal day 21 
until postnatal day 90, non-adverse, minimal to mild renal tubular and pelvic dilation in juvenile rats 
was seen only at 100 mg/kg/day, which approximates 11-times the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg. 
These findings were absent after a 13 weeks drug-free recovery period.

1. What Jardiance is and what it is used for
What Jardiance is
Jardiance contains the active substance empagliflozin.
Jardiance is a member of a group of medicines called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2)
inhibitors.
What Jardiance is used for
Type 2 diabetes mellitus

Jardiance is used to treat type 2 diabetes in adults and children aged 10 years and older that 
cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone. 
Jardiance can be used without other medicines in patients who cannot take metformin (another 
diabetes medicine).
Jardiance can also be used with other medicines for the treatment of diabetes. These may be 
medicines taken by mouth or given by injection such as insulin.


Jardiance works by blocking the SGLT2 protein in your kidneys. This causes blood sugar (glucose) to 
be removed in your urine. Thereby Jardiance lowers the amount of sugar in your blood.
This medicine can also help prevent heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
It is important that you continue with your diet and exercise plan as told by your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse.
Heart failure

What is type 2 diabetes?
Type 2 diabetes is a disease that comes from both your genes and your lifestyle. If you have type 2 
diabetes, your pancreas does not make enough insulin to control the level of glucose in your blood, 
and your body is unable to use its own insulin effectively. This results in high levels of glucose in your 
blood which can lead to medical problems like heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, and poor 
circulation in your limbs.
What is heart failure?
Heart failure occurs when the heart is too weak or stiff and cannot work properly. This can lead to 
serious medical problems and need for hospital care. The most common symptoms of heart failure are 
feeling breathless, feeling tired or very tired all the time, and ankle swelling. 
Jardiance helps protect your heart from getting weaker and improves your symptoms.
What is chronic kidney disease?
Chronic kidney disease is a long-term condition. It might be caused by other diseases such as diabetes 
and high blood pressure or even by your own immune system attacking the kidneys. When you have 
chronic kidney disease, your kidneys may gradually lose their ability to clean and filter the blood 
properly. This can lead to serious medical problems such as swollen legs, heart failure or need for 
hospital care. 
Jardiance helps protect your kidneys from losing their function.
2. What you need to know before you take Jardiance
Do not take Jardiance

if you are allergic to empagliflozin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Contact a doctor or the nearest hospital straight away:
Ketoacidosis

if you experience rapid weight loss, feeling sick or being sick, stomach pain, excessive thirst, 
fast and deep breathing, confusion, unusual sleepiness or tiredness, a sweet smell to your breath, 
a sweet or metallic taste in your mouth, or a different odour to your urine or sweat, contact a 
doctor or the nearest hospital straight away. These symptoms could be a sign of “ketoacidosis” 
– a serious, sometimes life-threatening problem you can get because of increased levels of 
“ketone bodies” in your urine or blood, seen in tests. The risk of developing ketoacidosis may 
be increased with prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol consumption, dehydration, sudden 
reductions in insulin dose, or a higher need of insulin due to major surgery or serious illness.
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking this medicine, and during treatment:

if you have “type 1 diabetes”. This type usually starts when you are young and your body does 
not produce any insulin. You should not take Jardiance if you have type 1 diabetes.
if you have serious kidney problems – your doctor may limit your dose to 10 mg once a day or 
ask you to take a different medicine (see also section 3, ‘How to take Jardiance’).
if you have serious liver problems – your doctor may ask you to take a different medicine.
might be at risk of dehydration, for example:



o if you are being sick, have diarrhoea or fever, or if you are not able to eat or drink
o if you are taking medicines that increase urine production [diuretics] or lower blood 
pressure
o if you are 75 years old or older.
52
Possible signs are listed in section 4 under ‘dehydration’. Your doctor may ask you to stop 
taking Jardiance until you recover to prevent loss of too much body fluid. Ask about ways to 
prevent dehydration.
if you have a serious infection of the kidney or the urinary tract with fever. Your doctor may ask 
you to stop taking Jardiance until you have recovered.

Talk to your doctor immediately if you develop a combination of symptoms of pain, tenderness, 
redness, or swelling of the genitals or the area between the genitals and the anus with fever or feeling 
generally unwell. These symptoms could be a sign of a rare but serious or even life-threatening 
infection, called necrotising fasciitis of the perineum or Fournier´s gangrene which destroys the tissue 
under the skin. Fournier’s gangrene has to be treated immediately.
Foot care
Like for all diabetic patients it is important to check your feet regularly and adhere to any other advice 
regarding foot care given by your health care professional.
Kidney function
Your kidneys should be checked before you start taking and whilst you are on this medicine.
Urine glucose
Because of how this medicine works, your urine will test positive for sugar while you are taking this 
medicine.
Children and adolescents
Jardiance can be used in children aged 10 years and older for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. No data 
are available in children below 10 years of age.
Jardiance is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years of age for the treatment of 
heart failure or for the treatment of chronic kidney disease, because it has not been studied in these 
patients.
Other medicines and Jardiance
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
It is important to tell your doctor:

if you are taking medicines that increase urine production (diuretics). Your doctor may ask you 
to stop taking Jardiance. Possible signs of losing too much fluid from your body are listed in 
section 4.
if you are taking other medicines that lower the amount of sugar in your blood such as insulin or 
a “sulphonylurea” medicine. Your doctor may want to lower the dose of these other medicines, 
to prevent your blood sugar levels from getting too low (hypoglycaemia).
if you are taking lithium because Jardiance can lower the amount of lithium in your blood.


Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use Jardiance if you are 
pregnant. It is unknown if Jardiance is harmful to the unborn child. Do not use Jardiance if you are 
breast-feeding. It is not known if Jardiance passes into human breast milk.
Driving and using machines
Jardiance has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Taking this medicine in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas or with insulin can cause 
blood sugar levels to drop too low (hypoglycaemia), which may cause symptoms such as shaking, 
sweating and change in vision, and may affect your ability to drive and use machines. Do not drive or 
use any tools or machines, if you feel dizzy while taking Jardiance.

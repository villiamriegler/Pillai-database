The maximum dosage should not exceed 150 IU/kg, 3 
times per week, 240 IU/kg (up to a maximum of 20,000 
IU) once weekly, or 480 IU/kg (up to a maximum of 40,000 
IU) once every 2 weeks. 
Chronic renal failure patients treated with epoetin alfa by 
the subcutaneous route should be monitored regularly for 
loss of efficacy, defined as absent or decreased response to 
epoetin alfa treatment in patients who previously 
responded to such therapy. This is characterised by a 
sustained decrease in haemoglobin despite an increase in 
epoetin alfa dosage.

Update of section 4.4 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and Section 2 of the Package 
Leaflet (PL) in order to implement the CHMP/PhVWP 
agreed wording for all erythropoiesis stimulating 
agents (ESA) regarding the need to maintain patient 
medication records and the information concerning 
any modification to the ESA prescribed.  The Package 
Leaflet has also been aligned with the SmPC with 
regards to wording on pure red cell aplasia in 
patients with hepatitis C. 
Minor linguistic changes were introduced to the 
Dutch, Greek and German annexes. The list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet was also 
updated. Additionally, minor changes to the product 
information were introduced. 
C.I.3.a - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under A 45/46, 
or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - Changes with 
NO new additional data are submitted by the MAH 
While investigations on the cause of PRCA in these cases 
are still ongoing, the CHMP and Pharmacovigilance Working 
Party (PhVWP) considered it important that accurate 
medication histories are maintained for patients treated 
with epoetins, recording the trade name or the scientific 
name with the name of the manufacturer. It is 
recommended that the product information of all ESAs 
includes a request to maintain patient medication records. 
The scope of this variation is to implement the 
CHMP/PhVWP agreed wording for all erythropoiesis 
stimulating agents (class labelling) to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet  of 
Abseamed/Binocrit/Epoetin Hexal, as requested by the 
CHMP. 
SmPC Section 4.4: Special warnings and precautions for 
use 
."In order to improve the traceability of erythropoiesis-
stimulating agents (ESAs), the trade name of the 
administered ESA should be clearly recorded (or stated) in 
the patient file." 
PL: Take special care with other products that stimulate red 
blood cell production: 
Binocrit/Epoetin alfa Hexal/Abseamed is one of a group of 
products that stimulate the production of red blood cells 
like the human protein erythropoietin does. Your healthcare 
professional will always record the exact product you are 
using.

Information with respect to the results of the Cochrane 
meta-analysis on the effects of epoetins in cancer patients 
and to the occurrence of PRCA in patients with Hepatitis C 
treated with Interferon, Ribavirin and Epoetin should be 
included into the SPC. 
The amendments of Sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SPC have 
been implemented as recommended by the PhVWP / CHMP.  
Minor linguistic and formatting changes have also been

those on dialysis and those who do not require regular 
dialysis. In addition, severe anaemia caused by non-renal 
disease can be corrected or alleviated following treatment 
with epoetin alfa, e.g. in cancer patients on chemotherapy. 
Response to epoetin alfa in these patients is manifested by 
increased haematocrit, haemoglobin, reduced transfusion 
requirements and increase in quality of life. In patients with 
moderate anaemia undergoing major elective surgery 
accompanied by considerable blood loss, epoetin alfa can 
be used to increase the yield of autologous blood in a 
predonation program. Epoetin alfa treatment was shown to 
reduce the exposure to allogeneic blood transfusion in 
patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery.

epoetins compared to patients who did not receive them. 
Following this review, the CHMP concluded, at its June 2008 
meeting, that the benefits of epoetins continue to outweigh 
their risks in the approved indications. However, in cancer 
patients with a reasonably long life-expectancy, the benefit 
of using epoetins does not outweigh the risk of tumour 
progression and shorter overall survival and therefore the 
Committee concluded that in these patients anaemia should 
be corrected with blood transfusions. The decision to 
administer epoetin-containing medicines should be based 
on an informed assessment of the benefits against the risks 
on individual basis, taking into account the type and stage 
of tumour, the degree of anaemia, the patient's life-
expectancy, the environment in which the patient is being 
treated and patient preference.  
As a result, Section 4.4 of the SPC and section 2 of the 
Package Leaflet are being updated to reflect these 
conclusions by incorporating wording requested by CHMP 
for inclusion for all epoetins for which a cancer indication is 
licensed.

PhVWP and the CHMP. The safety review was initiated 
because recent data show a consistent unexplained excess 
mortality in cancer patients with anaemia treated with 
epoetins, and that treatment of anaemia with epoetins in 
patients with chronic kidney disease to achieve relatively 
high target haemoglobin concentrations may be associated 
with an increase in the risk of mortality and cardiovascular 
morbidity.  
As a result, the main changes being implemented are: i) in 
section 4.1, to highlight that epoetins should be used only 
if associated with symptoms, ii) in Section 4.2 to establish 
a uniform target haemoglobin range for all epoetins, iii) in

balance in patients treated with high target haemoglobin 
concentrations, and iv) in section 5.1 to include the 
relevant results of the trials triggering the safety review. 
In addition, minor details in the labelling and the PL have 
been updated.

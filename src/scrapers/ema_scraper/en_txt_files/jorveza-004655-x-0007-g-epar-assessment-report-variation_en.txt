SmPC are updated to reflect the recommended daily dose and duration of treatment of Jorveza for the 
maintenance of remission, to update the list of adverse reactions and the clinical efficacy and safety 
information based on the results of the phase III clinical study BUL-2/EER. The relevant sections of the 
PL are updated accordingly. In addition, a revised RMP (version 2.0) has been submitted to reflect the 
results of this study and to align with the GVP Module V (rev 2) template. The MAH also took the 
opportunity to bring the product information in line with the latest QRD template (version 10.1).  
- A type IB variation (B.II.e.5.a.2) – To add a new pack-size of 200 x 1 orodispersible tablets (unit 
dose) in a blister for Jorveza 1 mg orodispersible tablet (EU/1/17/1254/006) 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
Jorveza was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/13/1181 on 5 August 2013 in the 
following condition: treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis. 
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above-mentioned orphan 
designation.

The CHMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific 
26 March 2020 
discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting 
a marketing authorisation to Jorveza on  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is an inflammatory condition of the oesophagus which causes 
symptoms including dysphagia and obstruction of the oesophagus. It is a relatively new disease entity 
that has been defined as a distinct clinicopathologic syndrome in the early 1990s only.  
Although no single feature defines EoE, a constellation of compatible demographic, clinical, endoscopic, 
and histologic findings establish the diagnosis. 
On 8 January 2018, Jorveza (budesonide) was approved for the treatment of EoE in adults (older than 
18 years of age) as a daily dose of 2 mg orodispersible tablets (1 mg in the morning and 1 mg in the 
evening) for a treatment duration up to 6 to 12 weeks.  
In the present application, the MAH proposes to extend the current indication to a maintenance 
therapy with a treatment duration to be determined by the treating physician and to include a new 
strength 0.5 mg orodispersible tablet. In addition, the MAH is adding a new pack-size for Jorveza 1 mg 
(200 orodispersible tablets). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
EoE is one of the most prevalent esophageal diseases and the leading cause of dysphagia and food 
impaction in children and young adults. 
Different studies with different methodologies have shown that there is a steady and relatively rapid 
increase in the incidence and prevalence of the condition during the last decade, or since the first 
description. According to the newest publications from Europe, the US and Canada, the incidence of 
the disease ranges between 6 and 13 new cases per year per 100,000 inhabitants. The latest 
prevalence data from Europe have shown a prevalence of up to 40-56 cases per 100,000 inhabitants1. 
The disease is similarly observed in children, also with increasing incidence, however, with higher 
variability between the studies. Due to the unmet medical need in the paediatric population the 
applicant was strongly encouraged at the time of initial marketing authorisation to further develop 
Budesonide in this area. 
The disease may occur at any age but has a clear peak in adults at the age of 30-50 years. A clear 
male predominance has been observed in all studies, with a recent meta-analysis showing an odd ratio 
(OR) of 2.01 (95% CI 1.64-2.48)1,2.

The disease is burdened with a considerable influence on Quality of Life, and with the danger of long-
term complications such as oesophageal fibrosis, food impaction, need for oesophageal dilation 
manoeuvers etc. However, an influence on overall life expectancy has not been observed. There is 
obviously no associated mortality. 
EoE is quite frequently associated with allergic disease, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic 
dermatitis, and manifestations of food allergies. Previously, EoE was considered a manifestation of 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), to which the observation of a response to proton-pump 
inhibitors (PPI) (“PPI responsive EoE” (=Proton-pump-inhibitor-responsive oesophageal eosinophilia 
(PPI-REE))) treatment in patients with EoE has contributed. According to the newest European 
consensus guideline, PPI-REE and EoE, are indistinguishable from one another and should be regarded 
to be within the same disease spectrum because they are clearly different from GERD, and the term 
“PPI-REE” is intended to be abandoned in the future1. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
EoE is defined as a chronic, immune-mediated, antigen-triggered oesophageal disease characterised by 
symptoms related to oesophageal dysfunction and eosinophil-predominant inflammation. 
The pathogenesis of EoE is not completely understood. However, it is generally accepted that it results 
from a complex interplay between genetic, environmental, and host immune system factors. The male 
predominance of EoE, as well as studies of family history, twin concordance and genome-wide 
association studies that identified three genes as being altered (the genes encoding thymic stromal 
lymphopoietin (TSLP), eotaxin-3, and calpain-14), suggest a genetic disposition of EoE.    
While the true environmental “cause” of EoE has not yet been determined, and there may be multiple 
factors at play, there are several possibilities. According to Runge et al 20153, these could, among 
other, due to exposition to aeroallergens (e.g. pollen), living in cold and dry climates, living in rural 
areas, food-based allergens, antibiotic use during the first year of life, breastfeeding and penicillin 
allergies4. 
Similar to other allergic disease entities, there is support for the concept that EoE is an entity mediated 
by (an exaggerated) type 2 helper T (Th2) cell activity mainly regulated by TSLP. Th2-associated 
cytokines / chemokines such as interleukin (IL-) 4, IL-5, IL-13, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand CCL-17 
and CCL-18 play an important role in the pathogenesis of EoE. Th2 signals, among them most 
important IL-13, activate a specific, complex transcriptional profile in oesophageal epithelial cells, 
encompassing more than 500 genes, among them a strong induction of the gene CCL-26, coding for 
the cytokine eotaxin-3 and a reduction of genes involved in the oesophageal barrier function 
(Desmoglein-1, Filaggrin). The damage caused by the chronic inflammation of the oesophageal 
epithelium promotes oesophageal remodelling processes which result in sub-epithelial fibrosis and the 
formation of strictures. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
In adults (and adolescents) the disease is mainly diagnosed after presentation of the patients with 
dysphagia, pain on swallowing (odynophagia) and complications, such as food impaction. This is 
different from children, where a variety of nonspecific symptoms, such as feeding difficulty, nausea 
and vomiting, heartburn, and failure to thrive are observed.

The final diagnosis of EoE is, however, only made after upper gastro intestinal (GI) endoscopy, 
including biopsy of the oesophageal mucosa, the diagnosis of eosinophil infiltration of the oesophagus, 
and the exclusion of other disease entities, such as GERD, Achalasia, Coeliac disease, Crohn’s Disease, 
and several connective tissue diseases (e.g. scleroderma). The endoscopic presentation of EoE is quite 
variable. The most common endoscopic findings in EoE patients are white specks, representative of 
oesophageal exudates, mucosal oedema, linear furrows, oesophageal rings and – as a result of chronic 
remodelling – strictures.  
Eosinophil infiltration of the mucosa as such – although pathognomonic for EoE – is regarded to be a 
histological finding that needs interpretation in the clinical context, because it can also be found in a 
variety of other conditions. 
During the course of the disease, patients often develop strategies to avoid symptoms, such as eating 
slowly, chewing carefully, cutting food into small pieces, lubricating foods with sauces, swallowing with 
frequent liquid intake, and avoiding foods likely to cause symptoms. Such ‘coping’ strategies develop 
gradually over years and may ultimately lead to a reduced symptom awareness which can delay the 
diagnosis of EoE by years in many patients. 
As reported above, the disease leads to a considerably reduced Quality of Life, and – along with 
remodelling of the oesophagus – to the development of oesophageal strictures, and the subsequent 
need for dilation manoeuvers. Rarely, complications such as oesophageal perforation and rupture of 
the oesophagus from forceful retching (Boerhave’s syndrome) have been observed. EoE has not been 
observed to be associated with the development of cancer and does not reduce life expectancy. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The current management of EoE is based on the need to improve both the clinical symptoms, as well 
as the oesophageal inflammation.  
Whereas the earlier American Practice Guidelines published in 20135 for the part of the treatment with 
medicinal products refer to the use of topical corticosteroids only, and PPI-REE as a different disease 
entity, the newer European Consensus Guideline1 clearly recommend the use of PPIs, and even long-
term treatment with PPIs in those patients responding to the treatment. A clear recommendation for 
the use of topical steroids, however, is also included in the European guideline, without clearly 
denominating a “first line” or “second line” therapy.  
a) Off label use of Proton-pump inhibitors:  
A recent systematic review with meta-analysis, including 33 studies with 619 patients with suspected 
EoE, has shown that PPIs led to histological remission (defined by <15 eos/hpf) in 50.5% (95% CI 
42.2– 58.7%) and symptomatic improvement in 60.8% (95%CI 48.38–72.2%) of cases. However, this 
analysis also included several “low-quality” studies, and the authors cautioned about the heterogeneity 
in results, and potential for publication bias. Several randomised, controlled trials, published since 
2011 have shown (histological) remission rates of 33% to 36% with PPIs. Therefore, PPI therapy may 
only be effective in a minority of patients. Whereas PPIs are all licensed for the treatment of reflux 
oesophagitis and Non-erosive reflux disease, a specific indication for EoE is not part of the prescribing 
information.

EMA/199925/2020 
Page 9/72 
  
  
 
 
 
b) Experimental and off-label use approaches in EoE, including topical steroids: 
There have been reports referring to treatments with immunomodulators, such as azathioprine, 
biologicals (infliximab [anti TNF-alpha], omalizumab [anti-IgE], reslizumab, mepolizumab [anti-Il-5), 
CRTH-2 antagonists, anti-IL-13 antibodies), anti-leukotriene approaches (montelukast) and mast-cell 
stabilizers (cromolyn sodium), most of which have not been successful. Currently, IL-4 ABs, and anti-
TGF-beta 1 medications are under development. 
Systemic corticosteroids have also been documented to be efficacious, but were usually associated 
with high rates of systemic adverse effects. Recent reviews/guidelines do clearly not recommend the 
use of systemic corticosteroids, apart from refractory cases, including the most recent European 
consensus guidelines. 
The majority of data referenced refer to the off-label experimental use of topically acting 
corticosteroids, out of which the best studied medications are budesonide, and fluticasone. Both 
substances are usually used from inhaler preparations, which are either (after application without 
spacer) swallowed, or which are opened and used for the preparation of individually prepared 
suspensions. 
For the demonstration of efficacy of these treatment modalities, two meta-analytic reviews are 
available6,7. The analysis by Chuang included 7 studies, and the one by Sawas included 11 studies. The 
European consensus guideline clearly recommends the use of topical steroids in the disease. 
c) Dietary therapy:  
Dietary treatment documented in the literature are elemental diet (amino-acid based liquid formula), 
elimination diet based on allergy testing, and the so-called “six-food elimination diet” (SFED). The 
majority of data available refers to the treatment of children, whereas the treatment under 
consideration is intended to be used in adults. Dietary treatment is usually associated with a relevant 
burden to patients, and long-term compliance remains an issue. 
The European Consensus Guideline recommends that there is only a limited place for elemental diet in 
EoE, which is recommended only after failure of medical treatment. The consensus has voted against a 
recommendation for food allergy testing and diets based on these tests, due to unreliability of the 
results, and relatively low rates of treatment success. A more positive vote was given for the SFED, or 
for an empiric four-food elimination diet (FFED). 
d) Oesophageal dilation: 
This form of therapy is only used to treat acute episodes of severe dysphagia and/or oesophageal 
stenosis, and/or concomitant food impaction. The method, however, is effective in providing long-
lasting symptom relief in patients with EoE and small diameter stenosis. However, in most patients 
dilation is associated with post-procedural pain and dilation has no impact on the underlying 
inflammatory process in the oesophagus. It is additionally referred to the fact that reviews of this 
treatment modality recommend to restrict oesophageal dilation for episodes of symptomatic small 
diameter stenosis and to combine it with medicinal or dietary therapy. 
Unmet medical need: 
The product under consideration has been licensed for the treatment of EoE in 2018 with dosing 
recommendations referring to short-term treatment up to 12 weeks maximum only. At the time of 
evaluation of the compound (with the only strength being 1 mg orodispersible tablet), there was no full

clear picture of the need for continuous treatment, and the applicant presented data that were 
directing towards the possibility that intermittent treatment could indeed suffice in this population. 
However, newer data have made it more likely (and led to respective recommendations in the newer 
treatment guidelines on both sides of the Atlantic) that a continuous maintenance treatment is 
necessary. Therefore, at the time of submission of the data underlying this grouped variation 
procedure, there was still an unmet medical need with regard to long-term continuous treatment in 
order to prevent relapse. 
About the product 
Budesonide is a well-known, highly potent, non-halogenated glucocorticosteroid. The applicant is the 
MAH of several budesonide preparations which have been licensed since 1998 and an abundance of 
clinical data is available for budesonide in multiple pharmaceutical formulations (e.g. orodispersible 
tablet, gastro-resistant capsule, gastro-resistant granules, rectal foam) for various indications. 
Budesonide 0.5 mg/1 mg orodispersible tablets are white or almost white, round, biplane tablets with a 
smooth surface and facet. The tablets are placed on the tip of the tongue for disintegration. The 
dissolved material is subsequently swallowed with saliva little by little. The un-dissolved tablet must 
not be chewed or swallowed. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
The applicant has submitted an application for an extension of marketing authorisation for Jorveza, 
under Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I (point 2c) grouped with an 
extension of indication, under Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and a type IB 
variation to add a new pack size. 
In the context of the initial MAA, the applicant received a protocol assistance from CHMP on 26 June 
2014. The protocol assistance pertained to non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier. 
Within this grouped variation the MAH follows the recommendation of the CHMP at the time of initial 
marketing authorisation to present long-term treatment data and to evaluate whether a continuous 
long-term treatment is necessary in the population. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This application is a line extension to the already approved Jorveza 1 mg orodispersible tablets. This 
line extension involves the addition of a 0.5 mg strength orodispersible tablet, an extension of 
indication and change in pack size of the finished product. The finished product part of the dossier and 
sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 6.5 of the SmPC are updated. 
The finished product is presented as orodispersible tablets containing 0.5 mg of budesonide as active 
substance. 
Other ingredients are: disodium hydrogen citrate, monosodium citrate anhydrous, sodium hydrogen

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance part of the dossier submitted for this line extension is identical to that submitted 
and approved in the previous application for Jorveza 1 mg orodispersible tablets by the centralised 
procedure.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Jorveza 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets are white or almost white, round, biplane (
 7 mm) with a 
smooth surface and facet.  
∅
The qualitative and quantitative composition of the 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets and existing Jorveza 
1 mg orodispersible tablets is identical (except for the amount of the active substance). Both dose 
strengths can be differentiated by the labelling design and the layout of the secondary packaging of 
the finished product. Additionally, the 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets are debossed with “0.5” on one 
side. 
The budesonide has a consistent crystalline structure (crystallinity >90%), confirmed by XRPD and 
melting point analysis of commercial batches. The active substance is micronised prior to finished 
product manufacture. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is 
compliant with Ph. Eur. standards, or with other accepted pharmacopoeia standards (i.e. B.P., German 
Drug Codex). There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The 
compatibility of the components of the finished product was confirmed during the initial MA application 
of Jorveza 1 mg orodispersible tablets. 
The active substance is a potent glucocorticosteroid with a high topical anti-inflammatory activity and 
low systemic effects. Jorveza 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets have been developed as an extension to 
the centrally authorised marketing authorisation for Jorveza 1 mg orodispersible tablets. Due to the 
similarity of the formulations additional development studies were not conducted. 
Two different strengths (budesonide 1 mg and 2 mg orodispersible tablets) were used as 
investigational medicinal products in the proof-of-concept, dose-finding and formulation selection 
studies. 
As for the existing 1 mg orodispersible tablets, the 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets are placed on the tip 
of the tongue for disintegration. After swallowing, the budesonide-loaded saliva lines the mucosa of the 
oesophagus and delivers the active substance to the site of action. The ability to hold the active 
substance in the oesophagus and to increase the contact time is supported by using a surfactant in the 
formulation that might facilitate the fusion of the layers and thereby enabling bioadhesion. The finished 
product is therefore not considered to be an immediate release form in the sense that there is not a 
rapid systemic absorption from the lower gastrointestinal tract after being swallowed. 
The manufacturing process that had been developed for Jorveza 1 mg orodispersible tablets at the pilot 
scale was also used for Jorveza 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets. Based on the results of the pilot scale 
process development studies performed with Jorveza 1 mg orodispersible tablets the same process 
was established for Jorveza 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets for commercial supply. This approach is 
justified taking into consideration the orphan nature of the product and the fact that pilot scale 
Assessment report

Page 12/72 
  
  
equipment is to the same extent qualified as production scale equipment. In addition, the finished 
product manufacturing site and the manufacturer of the active substance were unchanged.  
Due to the extremely low amount of active substance in the formulation (i.e. < 0.5%) and potential 
losses during processing the batch formula allows a manufacturing overage for budesonide.  
A short-term storage of the granules and the final blend is allowed for a maximum period of 7 days. 
The final primary packaging is Alu / Alu blister strips. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC 
requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: wet granulation, drying, blending (final mixture 
with all excipients), compression and primary packaging. 
The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process as the active substance 
accounts for less than 2% of the composition (i.e. a low dose tablet). Detailed description of the 
manufacturing process has been provided. Critical steps of manufacturing process have been 
identified, proposed equipment used for manufacture has been described and ranges of acceptance 
criteria have been substantiated.  
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
The manufacturing process has been validated by studies on three full scale production batches. It has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner.  
Product specification  
The  finished  product  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form,  namely: 
appearance  of  tablet  (visual),  appearance  of  blister  (visual),  resistance  to  crushing  (Ph.  Eur.), 
disintegration  time  in  water  (Ph.  Eur.),  loss  on  drying,  average  mass,  uniformity  of  dosage  units  by 
content uniformity (Ph. Eur.), identity (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), tightness 
of primary packaging and microbiological quality (Ph. Eur.). 
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing.  
The specifications of Jorveza 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets are identical to those of 1 mg orodispersible 
tablets except for purity. In this line extension, a previously unspecified impurity has been identified 
and specified in the specification. The impurity limits are in line with the identification and qualification 
thresholds set out in ICH Q3B(R2) guideline. In addition, the specification for sum of all impurities has 
been adapted accordingly.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data of three production scale batches of finished product 
resulting in values below 30% of PDE for each elemental impurity, it can be concluded that it is not 
necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product specification. The 
information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 13/72 
  
  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from six production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 18 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), 12 months under intermediate conditions (30°C / 65% RH) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were 
provided. The batches of medicinal product (one clinical and three validation batches) are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested in line with the shelf-life specification. The analytical procedures used are stability 
indicating.  
At long term storage conditions, all results (including impurities) complied with the proposed finished 
product  specification.  In  addition,  one  batch  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. Both control samples and the samples of 
the primary packed tablets complied with the finished product specification whereas the samples without 
primary  packaging  (“deblistered  tablets”)  resulted  in  a  decrease  of  approximately  30  %  of  the 
budesonide content and an increase of the impurities as out-of-specification. 
Orodispersible tablets are required to be protected from moisture. It was demonstrated that there is no 
transmission or absorption of moisture or leakage and the foil packages including the seals remain tightly 
closed over the period tested. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 24 months with the storage condition “Do 
not store above 25 °C. Store in the original package in order to protect from light and moisture.” as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. The following sentence was also added to SmPC section 
4.2: “The orodispersible tablet should be taken immediately once removed from the blister package”. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
This is a line extension to the already approved Jorveza 1 mg orodispersible tablets. No new active 
substance information has been submitted in this procedure. The development of Jorveza 0.5 mg 
orodispersible tablets was based on the existing 1.0 mg orodispersible tablets. Information on 
development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a satisfactory 
manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant confirms that no new studies have been conducted between the initial submission and 
the actual procedure. A literature search on preclinical data for budesonide for the relevant time period 
(March 2017 to July 2019) has been performed. The available new bibliographic data did not identify 
any change to the current risk/ benefit profile from the preclinical perspective. The applicant did not 
submit an updated non-clinical documentation. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The initial environmental risk assessment (ERA) had been assessed within a type IB application 
(EMEA/H/C/004655/IB/0002) at the beginning of 2019. For the present extension of application, an 
updated ERA was provided, including new PECsurfacewater calculations, taking into account the new 
additional indication and consequently an updated risk characterisation for the surface water and 
groundwater compartment. The respective risk quotients remain below 1 and a risk is not indicated.  
CHMP concluded that the present extension to Jorveza will not pose a risk to the environment when 
used in accordance with the SmPC.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This submission concerns the introduction of a new strength (0.5 mg orodispersible tablet), the 
increase of the treatment duration (to be determined by the treating physician) with submission of the 
respective long-term clinical data (study BUL-2/EER), as well as the addition of a pack size designed 
for the long-term treatment. 
In addition, the MAH submitted the results of a pharmacokinetics (PK) study (study BUL-6/BIO) which 
has been extended to additionally compare the PK of the two dose strengths (0.5 mg and 1 mg). 
No other new PK, or pharmacodynamics (PD) data are submitted, but the revised clinical overview 
submitted refers to the data presented at initial MAA in 2017. This report includes reference to the 
previous assessment as made public in the EU Public Assessment Report (EPAR) comprising the 
previously submitted data, as well as the summary of evaluation of the new data submitted for this 
grouped variation. 
The overview of the submitted study BUL-2/EER is presented in Table 2. The overview of the clinical 
studies (PK study BUU-1/BIO, supportive efficacy/safety study BUU-2/EEA, pivotal efficacy/safety 
study BUL-1/EEA) submitted in the context of the initial MAA can be found in the EPAR for Jorveza. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK parameters of budesonide 1 mg orodispersible tablets were evaluated in a phase I open label 
PK study (BUU-1/BIO) in the context of the initial MAA. The assessment of the study results can be 
found in the EPAR for Jorveza and a summary of the results for the absorption, distribution and 
elimination can be found in the next relevant sections of this report. 
In support of the present application, the MAH implemented the PK characterisation of the 0.5 mg 
tablet as an additional treatment arm into a recent clinical trial (Study BUL-6/BIO). This study was an 
open-label, randomised, 3-period, 3-sequence, single dose change-over trial in 18 male and female 
healthy volunteers (sex ratio 1:1). The dose proportionality is presented in this report. 
Absorption  
Following administration of Jorveza, budesonide is rapidly absorbed. Pharmacokinetic data following 
administration of single doses of 1 mg budesonide to fasted healthy subjects in two different studies 
show a median lag time of 0.17 hours (range 0.00 – 0.52 hours) and a median time to peak plasma 
concentration of 1.00-1.22 hours (range 0.50 – 2.00 hours). The mean peak plasma concentration was 
0.44 – 0.49 ng/mL (range: 0.18-1.05 ng/mL), and the area under the plasma-concentration–time 
curve (AUC0-∞) was 1.50 – 2.23 hr*ng/mL (range: 0.81-5.14 hr*ng/mL). 
Single dose pharmacokinetic data in fasted patients with EoE are available with 4 mg budesonide: 
Median lag-time was 0.00 hours (range 0.00 – 0.17), median time to peak plasma concentration was 
1.00 hour (range 0.67 – 2.00 hours); peak plasma concentration was 2.56 ± 1.36 ng/mL, and AUC0-12 
was 8.96 ± 4.21 hr*ng/mL. 
Patients showed a 35% increase in peak plasma concentrations and a 60% increase in AUC0-12 
compared to healthy subjects. 
Dose proportionality of the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) from 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets to 
1 mg orodispersible tablets has been demonstrated.  
Distribution 
The apparent volume of distribution following oral administration of 1 mg budesonide to healthy 
subjects was 35.52 ± 14.94 L/kg and 42.46 ± 23.90 L/kg following administration of 4 mg budesonide 
to patients with EoE. Plasma protein binding is on average 85-90%. 
Metabolism 
Metabolism of budesonide is decreased in EoE patients compared to healthy subjects resulting in 
increased plasma concentrations of budesonide. 
Budesonide undergoes extensive biotransformation by CYP3A4 in the mucosa of the small intestine and 
in the liver to metabolites of low glucocorticosteroid activity. The glucocorticosteroid activity of the 
major metabolites, 6β-hydroxybudesonide and 16α-hydroxyprednisolone, is less than 1% of that of 
budesonide. CYP3A5 does not contribute significantly to the metabolism of budesonide. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 19/72 
  
  
Elimination 
The median elimination half-life is 2 - 3 hours in healthy subjects (receiving 1 mg budesonide) and 
4 - 5 hours in EoE patients (receiving 4 mg budesonide). Clearance of budesonide is about 
13 – 15 L/hour/kg in healthy subjects and 6.54 ± 4.4 L/hour/kg in EoE patients. Budesonide is 
eliminated only in marginal if any amounts by the kidney. No budesonide, but only budesonide 
metabolites were detected in urine. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
The study BUL-6/BIO has evaluated dose-proportionality of the new dose-strength to the previously 
licensed strength of 1 mg. 
Study BUL-6/BIO was an open-label, randomised, 3-period, 3-sequence, single dose change-over trial 
in 18 male and female healthy volunteers (sex ratio 1:1; mean age 43.7 years, mean BMI 24.75 
kg/m2). The subjects received treatments with an oral suspension containing 1 mg budesonide, 
Jorveza 1 mg tablet and Jorveza 0.5 mg tablet, each separated by a wash-out phase of at least 3 days. 
All subjects completed the trial. 
The study also determined the disintegration kinetics of the orodispersible tablets by documenting the 
time span as well as the number of swallowing actions until complete disintegration. 
Mean plasma concentration vs. time curves of budesonide after administration of Jorveza 0.5 mg and 
Jorveza 1 mg are shown in Figure 1.

The results in tabular form for the two strengths of the orodispersible tablet are shown in Table 3 and

Similar results were achieved for the evaluation of the two metabolites 6ß-hydroxybudesonide, and 
16α-hydroxyprednisolone. 
Based on these results, the MAH concludes on dose-adjusted bioequivalence, and consequently on 
dose-proportional PK of the new 0.5 mg strength. 
The evaluation of the time span until complete disintegration showed a mean time span of 6.14 
minutes for the lower strength, and 6.36 min for the higher strength (median 4.68 and 4.48 minutes, 
range 2.0-14.6 and 2.0-23.3 min). The number of swallowing actions until complete disintegration was 
9.8 and 9.4 with the lower and higher strength respectively (range 2-18 for the lower and 3-21 for the 
higher strength. 
Time dependencies 
Based on the results of study BUU-1/BIO, there was no, or if any, minor budesonide accumulation as 
shown by its accumulation ratio (ACR) in both healthy subjects and patients with CIs not excluding the 
value 1 and a mean value in patients below 1.

Special populations 
No studies on the influence of age, gender, intake of food or the influence of hepatic and renal 
impairment on the PK of budesonide for the new formulation have been conducted. At time of initial 
MAA, the applicant entirely relied on the data available from the literature8,9,10,11. 
With regard to renal impairment, there are currently no data available for patients with renal 
impairment. Because budesonide is not excreted via the kidneys, patients with mild to moderate 
impairment may be treated with caution with the same doses as patients without renal impairment. 
Budesonide is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment. 
For patients with liver impairment some literature data is available (see above references showing data 
in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)-patients), which indicate a relevant increase of plasma levels of 
budesonide, depending on the severity of the impairment. However, no systematic study investigating 
different levels of hepatic impairment is available. Patients with hepatic impairment should not be 
treated.  
The influence of age has been found to be negligible in the available literature. Additional explorative 
evaluations of the PK data have revealed that the PK is overall not relevantly dependent on the factors 
age and gender. 
The safety and efficacy of Jorveza in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years have not been 
established. No data are yet available. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
As known from the literature, budesonide is metabolised by the Cytochrome P 450 3A4, and has no or 
low affinity to the related CYP3A5, and to the frequently associated transporter P-glycoprotein12,13. 
In the context of the initial MAA, the MAH had, in addition, tested a variety of cytochromes and 
transporters in vitro, and no potential for interaction had been detected. The potential for interaction 
with inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 is known from the literature14 . The two main metabolites of 
budesonide, 16α-hydroxyprednisolone, as well as 6β-hydroxybudesonide are known to have no 
relevant glucocorticoid activity. 
The analysis of the potential influence of genetic variations with regard to the metabolism of the 
compound has shown that only a minor clinical impact of genetic variations of CYP3A4 on drug 
metabolism has been documented. Moreover, CYP3A4 is minimally expressed in oesophagus, so it is 
not likely that the genetic polymorphism will have significant influence on budesonide metabolism. 
In the PK study conducted in the context of the initial MAA, the exposure to these metabolites has 
been shown to be higher after the administration of the orodispersible tablet formulation as compared

to the capsule formulation on a dose-normalised basis, which was confirmed with the higher excretion 
in urine. 
Both a high inter-subject as well as a high intra-subject variability was observed in the study BUU-
1/BIO for the novel formulation as well as reference marketed formulation. This is in agreement with 
literature data for other budesonide formulations, and no further information is requested. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of budesonide are well known and no new relevant studies on the mechanism 
of action of the compound have been conducted by the MAH and no new data have been submitted for 
the PD and PK/PD part of the documentation.  
In the context of the initial MAA, study BUU-1 has also investigated the influence of EoE symptoms in 
the patient population, as well as – for all participants – the influence of the budesonide administration 
on endogenous cortisol plasma levels and urine excretion. Therefore, these two elements contribute to 
the demonstration of pharmacodynamics and are briefly discussed in this chapter. 
Mechanism of action 
Budesonide is a non-halogenated glucocorticosteroid, which acts primarily anti-inflammatory via 
binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. In the treatment of EoE with Jorveza, budesonide inhibits 
antigen-stimulated secretion of many pro-inflammatory signal molecules such as thymic stromal 
lymphopoietin, interleukin-13 and eotaxin-3 in the oesophageal epithelium, which results in a 
significant reduction of the oesophageal eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The MAH has conducted only very limited investigations into the pharmacodynamics of the compound 
as part of the Phase I PK study submitted at time of initial MAA. This is – similar to the PK 
development programme – based on the fact that the substance budesonide is well known, and effects 
of glucocorticosteroids do clearly not need to be characterised any further. 
The effects of topically acting glucocorticosteroids on the inflamed oesophageal mucosa of EoE patients 
have also extensively been described in the literature15,16 , and the main molecular mechanism 
appears to be the anti-inflammatory activity on the expression of IL-13 and eotaxin. 
Glucocorticosteroids have also been shown to restore cell integrity by elevating the production of tight 
junction and cell adhesion proteins. In addition, glucocorticosteroids have been shown to reverse 
fibrotic remodelling of the oesophagus by reducing profibrotic cytokines. 
During the multiple-dose administration (7 days) of the PK study BUU-1/BIO, the included 12 patients 
also reported their symptomatic response (with a non-validated symptom score), which showed a 
slight, but relatively inconsistent, and not statistically significant reduction of the symptoms. The 
effects on the blood eosinophil counts were, however, showing a marked reduction, thus clearly 
indicating pharmacodynamic activity. 
During study BUU-1/BIO, the MAH also investigated the development of the endogenous (morning) 
cortisol levels in comparison to the reference formulation, thus investigating the potential influence of 
15 Gross KL and JA Cidlowski: Tissue-specific glucocorticoid action: a family affair. Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2008; 19: 331-
339

the compound on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis). All single-dose observations did 
not show relevant effects on endogenous cortisol levels in comparison to the reference formulation. 
However, after multiple-dose administration, the endogenous cortisol levels were clearly lowered 
(compared to the single-dose reference intake), both in healthy subjects, as well as in EoE patients. 
This was also reflected in the urinary excretion of cortisol, which also showed a relevant decrease after 
multiple-dose administration. The clinical relevance of these alterations of endogenous cortisol plasma 
levels and urinary excretion can, however, not be assessed from the data presented, because the dose 
administered was higher than the therapeutic dose, and no placebo comparison was included. A 
theoretical potential for the influence of the compound on the HPA-axis can be assumed and is outlined 
in 4.4 of the SmPC.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The MAH has conducted only very limited investigations into the characterisation of the PK and PD of 
the compound. This limitation is based on the fact that the active substance budesonide is well known, 
and effects of glucocorticosteroids do clearly not need to be characterised any further. The 
development programme therefore partly relies on extrapolation of the known properties of the active 
substance from other available budesonide containing medicinal products, which is considered an 
overall reasonable strategy. 
As part of the present application, the MAH submitted the results of a recently completed open-label, 
randomised, 3-period, 3-sequence, single dose change over trial in healthy volunteers (BUL-6/BIO). 
The study evaluated dose-proportionality of the new dose-strength 0.5 mg to the previously licensed 
strength 1 mg. The study also determined the disintegration kinetics of the orodispersible tablets. 
The statistical evaluation of the dose-adjusted PK data indicates a similar relative bioavailability of 
Jorveza 0.5 mg tablet vs. Jorveza 1 mg tablet by means of systemic exposure (AUC0 inf, AUC0-tlast) and 
a similar maximum exposure (Cmax). Considering the difference in dose, Jorveza 0.5 mg tablet vs. 
Jorveza 1 mg tablet demonstrated bioequivalence, although this was not an objective of this trial. 
Similar results were obtained for the two main metabolites of budesonide. Thus, based on the 
comparative PK data dose proportionality of the systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC) from 0.5 mg 
orodispersible tablets to 1 mg orodispersible tablets has been demonstrated. This is reflected in section 
5.2 of the SmPC. 
Furthermore, both dosage forms demonstrated comparable oral disintegration kinetics, i.e. similar 
median and mean disintegration times and numbers of swallowing actions. The individual oral 
disintegration time was variable, but none of the subjects showed a disintegration time below 2 
minutes. 
The effects of topically acting glucocorticosteroids on the inflamed oesophageal mucosa of EoE patients 
has also extensively been described in the literature, and the main molecular mechanism appears to be 
the anti-inflammatory activity on the expression of IL-13 and eotaxin. Glucocorticosteroids have also 
been shown to restore cell integrity by elevating the production of tight junction and cell adhesion 
proteins. In addition, glucocorticosteroids have been shown to reverse fibrotic remodelling of the 
oesophagus by reducing profibrotic cytokines. 
The conducted PK-study BUU-1/BIO reviewed at time of initial MAA has also included a limited amount 
of investigations into the primary and secondary pharmacology of the compound. 
During the multiple-dose administration (7 days) of the PK study BUU-1/BIO, the included 12 patients 
also reported their symptomatic response (with a non-validated symptom score), which showed a 
slight, but relatively inconsistent, and not statistically significant reduction of the symptoms. The

effects on the blood eosinophil counts were, however, showing a marked reduction, thus clearly 
indicating pharmacodynamic activity. 
In addition, during study BUU-1/BIO, the MAH also investigated the development of the endogenous 
(morning) cortisol levels in comparison to the reference formulation, thus investigating the potential 
influence of the compound on the HPA-axis. All single-dose observations did not show relevant effects 
on endogenous cortisol levels in comparison to the reference formulation. 
However, after multiple-dose administration, the endogenous cortisol levels were clearly lowered 
(compared to the single-dose reference intake), both in healthy subjects, as well as in EoE patients. 
This was also reflected in the urinary excretion of cortisol, which also showed a relevant decrease after 
multiple-dose administration. The clinical relevance of these alterations of endogenous cortisol plasma 
levels and urinary excretion can, however, not be assessed from the data presented, because the dose 
administered was higher than the therapeutic dose, and no placebo comparison was included. 
However, a theoretical potential for the influence of the compound on the HPA-axis has been 
demonstrated and is reflected in the section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The limited PK/PD data presented in this application do not bring new information on the pharmacology 
profile of budesonide. The results of the recently completed PK study (BUL-6/BIO) demonstrated dose 
proportionality of the systemic exposure from the new strength 0.5 mg orodispersible tablets to the 
already authorised strength 1 mg orodispersible tablets. The new strength is therefore approvable from 
the pharmacology point of view.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose response study was conducted in support of the present application. A supportive and dose-
response study, Study BUU-2/EEA, was submitted at time of initial MAA. This was a double-blind, 
double-dummy, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II study on the efficacy and tolerability of a 14-
day treatment with budesonide orodispersible tablets (formerly called ‘budesonide effervescent tablets 
for orodispersible use’) vs. viscous budesonide suspension vs. placebo in patients with eosinophilic 
esophagitis. The assessment of this study can be found in the EPAR for Jorveza. 
2.5.2.  Main study on long-term treatment - Study BUL-2/EER 
Methods 
Study BUL-2/EER was a randomised, multi-centre, placebo-controlled, comparative, phase III study 
evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of a long-term treatment with two different doses of budesonide 
orodispersible tablets vs. placebo for maintenance of clinico-pathological remission in adult patients 
with eosinophilic esophagitis. 
The study comprised 6 phases: 
•  Screening phase (1 to 6 weeks); 
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 25/72 
  
  
•  Open-label induction (OLI) phase: with treatment with budesonide orodispersible tablets (BUL) 
1 mg, twice daily (BID) for 6 weeks; 
•  Double-blind (DB) phase with 1:1:1 randomisation and treatment with BUL 0.5 mg BID, BUL 
1 mg BID, or placebo BID for 48 weeks; 
•  Open-label re-induction (OLRI) phase: for patients who experienced relapse during the DB 
phase. Treatment was given with BUL 1 mg BID (up to 6 weeks); 
•  Open-label extension (OLE) phase: for patients in remission at the end of the DB phase or 
OLRI phase. Treatment with BUL 0.5 mg BID (with optional escalation to 2xBUL 0.5 mg BID 
(up to 96 weeks); 
• 
Follow-up (FU) phase: 4-week safety FU after last treatment visit in any phase of the trial. 
The data reported in this submission do not (yet) comprise the OLRI, OLE and FU phases of the trial. 
It is expected that the final study report, including the full evaluation of the OLRI, OLE, and FU phases 
of the trial are reported as soon as available. 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria in the DB phase of the study: 
• 
• 
Patients (aged 18-75 years) had to have a confirmed clinico-pathological diagnosis of EoE 
according to the established criteria17 ; 
Patients in clinico-pathological remission at end of treatment (EOT) visit of study BUL-1/EEA or 
EOT visit of the OLI phase of study BUL-2/EER were included, if the following two criteria were 
fulfilled at the EOT visit: histological remission (i.e. peak eos < 16 eos/mm² hpf) and 
resolution of symptoms (i.e. no or only minimal problems) defined as dysphagia ≤ 2 on a 0-
10-point numerical rating scale (NRS) and pain during swallowing ≤ 2 on 0-10 NRS on each 
day of the last 7 days prior to the EOT visit 
Main exclusion criteria in the DB phase of the study: 
•  Patients who were clinically and endoscopically suspected to have gastroesophageal reflux 
disease, achalasia, scleroderma oesophagus or systemic sclerosis; 
•  History of oesophageal surgery at any time or of oesophageal dilation procedures within the 
last 8 weeks prior to DB visit 1;  
•  Any relevant systemic diseases (e.g. acquired immune deficiency syndrome, active 
tuberculosis); 
•  Other clinically evident causes than EoE for oesophageal eosinophilia, any concomitant 
oesophageal disease and relevant gastro-intestinal disease, upper gastrointestinal bleeding 
within 8 weeks prior to DB baseline visit, abnormal hepatic or renal function;  
•  A history of cancer in the last 5 years (except for non-metastatic cancers, e.g. basalioma);  
•  Treatment with systemic therapies (including concomitant treatment with ethinylestradiol in a 
dose of more than 30 μg/d) and treatment with topical therapies that could have affected 
assessment of the primary or secondary endpoints;

Page 26/72 
  
  
 
•  Other non-EoE disease-related exclusion criteria included cardiovascular disease, diabetes 
mellitus, osteoporosis, active peptic ulcer disease, glaucoma, cataract, or infection. 
Treatments 
During study BUL-2/EER, the patients received one of the following treatments: 
•  Group A (‘BUL 0.5mg BID’): Budesonide 0.5 mg orodispersible tablet twice daily (BID); 
•  Group B (‘BUL 1mg BID’): Budesonide 1 mg orodispersible BID; 
•  Group C (‘Placebo’): Placebo orodispersible tablet BID. 
One orodispersible tablet had to be taken in the morning and one in the evening after the meal. The 
orodispersible tablet had to be placed on the tongue which allowed rapid disintegration. The 
orodispersible tablet was to dissolve rapidly and to be swallowed with saliva little by little.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of the DB phase of the study was: 
• 
To assess the efficacy of a 48-week treatment with 2 x 0.5 mg/d or 2 x 1 mg/d of budesonide 
orodispersible tablets vs. placebo for the maintenance of clinico-pathological remission in adult 
patients with EoE. 
The secondary objectives were: 
• 
• 
To study the safety and tolerability in the form of adverse events (AEs) and laboratory 
parameters; 
To assess patients’ quality of life (QoL). 
Further objectives were defined for the OLRI phase and the OLE phase of the study, which are, 
however, currently not (yet) reported. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable of the DB phase was defined as follows: 
Rate (%) of patients free of treatment failure at week 48 or EOT visit, whereby treatment failure was 
defined as one of the following criteria that occurred at any time during the DB treatment: 
-  Clinical relapse, i.e. experiencing dysphagia or pain during swallowing in the past seven days 
(7-day recall period) of a severity of ≥4 points on a 0–10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for 
dysphagia or pain during swallowing, respectively, confirmed by a severity of ≥4 points on at 
least 1 day during the subsequent week on the respective 0-10 NRS for dysphagia or pain 
during swallowing (24-hours recall period) (any of the visits); 
-  Histological relapse, i.e. a peak of ≥48 eos/mm2 hpf at DB week 48/EOT; 
- 
Experiencing a food impaction which needed endoscopic intervention; 
-  Need for an endoscopic dilation; 
- 
Premature withdrawal for any reason. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 27/72 
  
  
Similar criteria as for the “regular” clinical relapse were also applied for any “extra visit” during the DB 
treatment phase. 
Histological relapse was defined as a peak of ≥48 eos/mm2 hpf. The peak number of eos/mm2 hpf was 
derived from the evaluation of a total of 6 hpfs obtained from 6 oesophageal biopsies (two from the 
proximal, two from the mid and two from the distal part of the oesophagus). 
The secondary endpoints were the following: 
The following variables were analysed as a priori ordered key secondary efficacy variables: 
1)  Rate of patients with histological relapse, defined as a peak of ≥48 eos/mm2 hpf at DB week 
48/EOT; 
2)  Change in the peak eos/mm² hpf from DB baseline to DB week 48/EOT; 
3)  Rate of patients with a clinical relapse, have experienced a food impaction, which needed 
endoscopic intervention, or needed an endoscopic dilation during the DB treatment phase; 
4)  Rate of patients with a total weekly Eosinophilic Oesophagitis Activity Index – Patient-Reported 
Outcome (EEsAI-PRO) score of ≤20 at DB week 48/EOT; 
5)  Rate of patients in deep disease remission, i.e., deep clinical, deep endoscopic, and histological 
remission (based on the peak number of eos per hpf), at DB week 48/EOT. 
Of these 5 variables, the first four were included in the study protocol, whereas the fifth was added 
only in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
Further exploratory secondary efficacy variables were evaluated, comprising a list of 38 different 
endpoints. 
All efficacy evaluations of the OLI phase of the study are also included as exploratory endpoints. 
Sample size 
The sample size for the pivotal study was calculated based on the primary endpoint and taking into 
account expected remission rates from the literature. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Patients who gave their written consent and met the respective inclusion criteria at the screening visit, 
or at baseline visit for patients coming from BUL-1/EEA, were uniquely identified by a 5-digit enrolment 
(i.e. screening) number, consisting of a unique 3-digit centre number followed by a 2-digit screening 
number.  
Once the subject was considered qualified for entry into the DB treatment phase of the study, i.e., the 
patient met all inclusion criteria and did not fulfil any of the exclusion criteria at DB visit 1, a 
randomisation number was allocated to the patient via the interactive web-response system (IWRS), 
integrated in the electronic code of federal regulations (eCRF). This consecutive ascending 4-digit 
random number served to randomly allocate a treatment group to each patient, according to their 
sequential entrance into the DB phase of the trial, by means of a computer-generated randomisation 
list. Randomisation was performed using randomly permuted blocks. No stratification of randomised 
treatment assignment based on centre, age, sex, or other characteristics was performed. 
The study was fully blinded with regard to the appearance of the study medication, and the amount of 
study drug to be administered.

Statistical methods 
The evaluation of primary and secondary efficacy variables for the DB phase was performed for the full 
analysis set of the double-blind phase (FAS-DB; intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis) and for the per-
protocol analysis set (per-protocol [PP] analysis). The primary analysis set for efficacy analyses was 
the FAS-DB. 
The evaluation of ‘other’ variables (further exploratory secondary endpoints) relevant for the OLI phase 
was performed for the full analysis set for the OLI phase (FAS-OLI). 
The safety analysis set for the DB phase (SAF-DB) was used for the evaluation of safety during the DB 
phase, the safety analysis set for the OLI phase (SAF-OLI) was used for the evaluation of safety during 
the OLI phase. 
The primary efficacy variable (and the a priori ordered key secondary efficacy variables) were 
subjected to a confirmatory statistical analysis. Hypothesis testing (one-sided) was performed for both 
budesonide treatment arms separately at Bonferroni adjusted significance level of 0.0125. The 
Bonferroni adjustment was applied to account for the multiple budesonide groups. The primary 
hypotheses to be tested were: 
• H0: πPLA ≥ πEff1 vs. H1: πPLA < πEff1 
• H0: πPLA ≥ πEff2 vs. H1: πPLA < πEff2, 
where πPLA, πEff1 and πEff2 (πEff1: BUL 0.5 mg BID; πEff2: BUL 1 mg BID) denote the rate of 
patients who are not treatment failures after 48 weeks of double-blind treatment in each treatment 
group. These hypotheses were tested at a one-sided Bonferroni adjusted type I error rate level of 
0.0125 using the normal approximation tests for the comparison of rates. For estimating the treatment 
effect compared to placebo, two-sided 97.5% (Bonferroni correction) confidence intervals (CI) for the 
difference of rates were provided. 
Comparisons between the budesonide groups, which were performed on the primary efficacy endpoint 
using the test as specified above, were not interpreted in a confirmatory manner. 
A sensitivity analysis was planned in the CSP using the FAS-DB and ‘a logistic regression model for the 
treatment failure rate with treatment group as a factor and baseline peak number of eos/mm² hpf, 
baseline dysphagia NRS and baseline pain during swallowing NRS of the preceding induction phase 
(either BUL-1/EEA or BUL-2/EER OLI-phase) as covariates’.  
In case the actual number of treatment failures did not allow a joint model containing these variables, 
separate sensitivity analyses were to be performed by entering each covariate separately. 
A subgroup analysis was performed, differentiating the patients by their path to remission. 
The evaluation of the secondary efficacy variables for the DB phase was performed for the FAS-DB 
(intention-to-treat analysis) and for the PP set. The evaluation of ‘other’ variables (further exploratory 
secondary endpoints) for the OLI phase was performed for the FAS-OLI. 
Efficacy significance testing was continued in hierarchical fashion in support of labelling claims for five 
key secondary efficacy endpoints as given above, until the first of these comparisons of BUL 0.5mg 
BID versus placebo or BUL 1mg BID versus placebo showed a one-sided p-value >0.0125 (FAS-DB). 
Once a non-significant p-value occurred all subsequent significance tests were considered exploratory 
in nature. Both streams were tested independently from each other, such that key secondary efficacy 
variables were tested in a confirmatory fashion for each active treatment group only if the primary

efficacy variable showed significance for that treatment group. Conversely, non-significance in a key 
secondary efficacy variable for one of the active treatment groups did not imply stopping the 
hierarchical testing in the other treatment group. 
The following methods were used to perform inferential statistics for key secondary endpoints: 
• Dichotomous key secondary endpoints (key secondary endpoints no. 1, 3, 4 and 5) were analysed 
using the normal approximation test for rates (test for superiority, one-sided alpha level of 0.0125 for 
confirmatory analyses). The denominator was all patients included in the respective analysis set, the 
numerator was all patients with ‘yes’. Dichotomous key secondary endpoints with a corresponding 
baseline measurement (key secondary endpoints no. 1 and 4) were in addition analysed using logistic 
regression including the screening/baseline value(s) of the preceding induction phase in addition to 
treatment group: 
For key secondary endpoint no. 1 the peak number of eos/mm2 hpf at screening was used as 
covariate, for key secondary endpoint no. 4 the weekly EEsAI-PRO score at baseline of the preceding 
induction phase was used as covariate. 
• Change in the peak eos/mm2 hpf was analysed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. [The following is 
stated in CSP Section 9.3.2.: ‘Quasi-continuous target variables (change in the peak eos/mm2 hpf) will 
be analysed by fitting a linear least squares model with treatment effect and baseline value(s) as 
covariate(s) if warranted by the number of parameter values actually observed; alternatively, a 
Wilcoxon test may be appropriate.’ As preliminary blinded data suggested peak eos/mm2 hpf values of 
0 for almost all patients at baseline and around half of the patients at the end of the DB phase, it was 
planned in the SAP to use the Wilcoxon rank sum test for the analysis of this endpoint.] 
All tests for key secondary endpoints were done on a one-sided alpha level of 0.0125 (Bonferroni 
correction) with the intent to show the superiority of active treatment over placebo in the context of 
the hierarchical testing procedure. 
Results 
Participant flow 
In total, 297 patients were included in the study: 66 patients were former participants of the BUL-
1/EEA trial and were all randomised for the DB treatment phase; and 231 patients were screened for 
this trial without previous participation in BUL-1/EEA. One of the 231 screened patients was a 
screening failure following his/her first screening visit and was subsequently screened a second time, 
but counted only once. A total of 50 patients of the 231 screened patients were screening failures and 
were not included in the OLI phase of this trial, 181 patients were included in the OLI phase and 
received at least one dose of OLI investigational medicinal product (IMP). Of these, 138 patients were 
considered for transition into the DB phase of the trial. Hence a total of 204 patients were randomised 
for the DB phase, and all of these received at least one dose of the investigational product, and were 
thus included in the FAS-DB population.  
Of note, at the time of submission of the Day120 responses by the applicant, from the 204 patients 
treated in the DB treatment phase, 82 patients entered the 6-weeks open-label re-induction phase 
(OLRI); 186 entered the OLE phase (first 48 weeks; either by switch from DB or from OLRI phase), 
and 159 continued from OLE into the OLE 2 phase (up to 96 weeks treatment). In the OLE phases, the 
majority of patients was treated with BUL 0.5mg BID.

So far, 114 of 204 patients from the DB phase have completed the study and are included into the FU 
phase. Of the 186 patients from the OLE (48 weeks) phase, so far 168 patients have completed this 
phase and only 10 patients were prematurely withdrawn, of whom 8 withdrawals were due to lack of 
patient’s cooperation and 2 due to intolerable AEs, but none due to lack of efficacy.

Recruitment 
The date of first randomisation into this study was 29 January 2016, and the last patient which 
completed the DB phase was on 28 November 2018. As reported above, the recruitment into the trial 
was faster than expected, and the planned interim analysis was not conducted due to this fast 
recruitment. At the time of submission of the data, a final study report is not available due to the fact 
that OLRI, as well as OLE and FU phases were ongoing at the time of submission. 
Conduct of the study 
Major protocol violations leading to exclusion from the PP set included violations of major in-/ exclusion 
criteria, insufficient compliance with respect to intake of IMP during the DB phase, use of prohibited 
concomitant medication, premature discontinuation from DB treatment phase – unless the reason for 
discontinuation was lack of efficacy, or intolerable AE with at least possible causal relationship with the 
IMP, or intolerable AE which was a deterioration of study disease, change of concomitant treatment 
with PPIs during the DB phase, DB EOT/withdrawal visit more than seven days after last IMP intake 
during the DB treatment phase, and administration of IMP during the DB phase for less than 28 days. 
Major protocol violations leading to exclusion from the PP set are presented in Table 6.

The disease characteristics at baseline (expressed as with symptomatic NRS scales, the EEsAI-PRO 
instrument, QoL scales, and histology) indicated that requested state of remission in all treatment 
groups was fulfilled. 
Numbers analysed 
The final analysis was performed on a total of 204 FAS-DB and 173 per-protocol patients. The 
allocation of patients to the per-protocol set for the final analysis was performed before unblinding. 
The reason for non-inclusion of patients into the PP set are given in Table 8 above. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary outcome: 
In the FAS-DB, rates of patients free of treatment failure at week 48 were comparable between the 
two dose groups (BUL 0.5 mg BID group: 73.5%; BUL 1 mg BID group: 75.0%) and higher compared 
with the Placebo group (4.4% of patients). The difference between BUL 0.5 mg BID and Placebo 
groups with respect to the rate of patients free of treatment failure at week 48 was 69.1% (97.5% CI: 
[55.89%; 82.34%]), with one-sided p-value resulting from the normal approximation test < 0.0001, 
demonstrating the highly significant superiority of BUL 0.5 mg BID to Placebo for maintenance of 
clinico-pathological remission in adult patients with EoE. Likewise, the estimated difference between 
BUL 1 mg BID and Placebo groups of 70.6% (97.5% CI: [57.56%; 83.61%, one-sided p-value 
< 0.0001) was also statistically significant and demonstrated the superiority of BUL 1 mg BID to 
Placebo. 
The outcome of the primary evaluation is shown in Table 9.

An oesophageal segment was defined as affected by inflammation if the peak number of eos/mm² hpf 
was ≥16. 
•  Concomitant use of PPIs (yes/no) during the DB treatment phase, 
Entries on the concomitant medication page of the eCRF were classified as PPI during the DB treatment 
phase (yes/no), unless they were stopped before or at the day of the DB Baseline visit or initiated only 
at or after the date of the DB EOT visit. 
•  History of allergic diseases (yes/no, as documented in the eCRF at DB V1), 
• 
Patient’s Global Assessment (PatGA) at baseline of induction phase (Baseline visit of BUL-
1/EEA or OLI Baseline visit of BUL-2/EER), 
For the stratified analysis PatGA was categorised into 4 groups: ‘0 to 2’, ‘3 to 5’, ‘6 to 8’, and ‘9 to 10’. 
An additional stratified post-hoc analysis was performed with PatGA categorised into 2 groups: ‘≤5’ 
and ‘>5’. 
• 
Time interval since first symptoms of EoE at DB Baseline (years): 
< median (years) and ≥ median (years). 
Table 16 shows the results according to these criteria.

Treatment failure after 48 weeks of treatment 
was “yes”, if at least one of the following 
criteria was met at any time during the DB 
treatment phase: 
- Clinical relapse, i.e., experiencing dysphagia 
or pain during swallowing in the past seven 
days (7 day recall period) of a severity of ≥4 
points on a 0–10 NRS for dysphagia or pain 
during swallowing, respectively, confirmed by 
a severity of ≥4 points on at least 1 day 
during the subsequent week on the respective 
0-10 NRS for dysphagia or pain during 
swallowing (24-hour recall period). 
- Histological relapse, i.e., a peak of ≥48 
eos/mm2 hpf at DB V6/EOT, 
- Experiencing a food impaction which needed 
endoscopic intervention, 
- Need for an endoscopic dilation, 
- Premature withdrawal for any reason

Supportive study 
The results of the OLI (=introductory phase) of study BUL-2/EER are presented in this section. 
The number of patients recruited and evaluated have already been shown above. As reported, the 
FAS-OLI comprised 181 patients. 
Overall, efficacy of BUL 1mg BID was shown independently of the outcome parameter used (clinico-
pathological remission rate, resolution of symptoms rate, PatGA, PRA, and patient’s global 
satisfaction). At OLI Week 6 (LOCF), 126 of 181 patients (69.6%) were in clinico-pathological 
remission. The number of patients who were extremely satisfied at OLI Week 6 (LOCF) was 95 of 181 
(52.5%). The main results of this part of the trial are shown in Table 19:

The rate of clinico-pathological remission observed in the OLI phase is in full accordance with the 
results of the DB phase of study BUL-1/EEA. This is taken as a further confirmation of the results of 
this earlier induction trial. 
Currently, for the OLRI and OLE extension phases, only interim results are available (data lock point 29 
Oct 2019).  
In the OLRI phase, a total of 76 of 82 patients (92.7%) showed resolution of their symptoms (i.e., no 
or only minimal problems), qualifying them to be enrolled in the optional OLE phase. Treatment 
success did not depend on the previous treatment received (success rates 80%, 100%, and 93% in 
those previously treated with low-dose, high-dose, and placebo, respectively). 
The OLE phases of the trial, both for those patients switching from the double-blind treatment, as well 
as from the OLRI phase, the documented relapse rates are very low, overall confirming the results 
from the double-blind treatment phase. However, the full interpretation of the data is currently 
hampered by the incomplete reporting, especially for the extended open-label phase, which is intended 
to provide an extended follow-up up to 96 weeks of treatment. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The discussion on clinical efficacy, and the further chapters, mainly refer to the newly submitted data 
from the long-term study BUL-2/EER.  
Clinical efficacy for short term treatment had already been shown at the time of initial approval and 
can be found in the EPAR for Jorveza.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH, in order to document long-term efficacy of Jorveza in the treatment of EoE in adults, has 
presented a well-conducted, and well-planned clinical study of 1-year duration.  
The study was a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III clinical study (BUL-2/EER) 
including 204 adult patients with EoE in clinico-pathological remission. Patients were randomised to 
treatment with 0.5 mg budesonide twice daily (BID), 1 mg budesonide BID, or placebo (all given as 
orodispersible tablets) for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of patients free of treatment 
failure with treatment failure defined as clinical relapse (severity of dysphagia or pain during 
swallowing of ≥4 points on a 0-10 numerical rating scale, respectively), and/or histological relapse 
Assessment report

Page 45/72 
  
  
 
 
(peak of ≥ 48 eosinophils/mm2 high power field), and/or food impaction requiring endoscopic 
intervention, and/or need of an endoscopic dilation, and/or premature withdrawal for any reason. 
The design of the study has been drawn up according to the advice given by CHMP. The investigation 
of a 48-week treatment period is considered adequate, and it was also fully reasonable to investigate a 
lower dose of the investigational agent for the long-term treatment once remission had been achieved. 
The population included is considered fully adequate considering the disease history, and the previous 
inclusion in either the DB trial evaluated earlier, or – as shown in the evaluation of the long-term trial 
– in a short-term open-label induction trial, as part of the long-term trial. All patients (with very few 
exceptions) were in full remission at the time of inclusion. 
The chosen control group is considered fully acceptable at a time with no other medicinal product being 
licensed for the long-term treatment of EoE. 
The choice of the trial endpoints has been according to the protocol assistance given, and according to 
the scientific consensus of the learned societies, that both, symptoms as well as histological and 
endoscopic appearance should be included for the demonstration of efficacy. The primary endpoint 
combined symptomatic and histological evaluation, and the key secondary endpoints were different 
aspects of these components, which is considered fully adequate. Additional aspects have been tested 
with established symptoms as well as quality of life scales, and with endoscopic assessment of the 
oesophageal mucosa. All of these evaluations appeared to be in full accordance. 
No concerns are raised with regard to the study design, the mode of evaluation, as well as the results 
of the analyses conducted. Additional analyses requested with regard to the influence of age and 
gender on efficacy results did not reveal relevant differences with regard to these categories, although 
– reflecting the epidemiology of the disease – truly “elderly” patients were not included in the studies. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
This newly submitted long-term study on the maintenance of remission in adult patients with EoE has 
convincingly demonstrated superiority of both doses (0.5 mg and 1 mg) of budesonide orodispersible 
tablets over placebo. Significantly more patients in the 0.5 mg BID (73.5%) group and the 1 mg BID 
(75.0%) group were free of treatment failure at week 48 compared to placebo (4.4%). 
The results of almost all endpoints used (both the primary, the confirmatory evaluated secondary 
(histological relapse, change in peak eos, clinical relapse, EEsAI PRO score, deep remission) as well as 
the exploratory secondary) have shown highly statistically significant superiority over placebo for both 
doses of the investigational compound. As far as evaluated, all results not only demonstrate statistical 
significance, but also a high level of clinical relevance with a huge magnitude of effect against placebo. 
The results have also shown a vast robustness with regard to the evaluation of subgroups, based on 
several disease characteristics at baseline, and region/country of conduct of the study. The low number 
of female patients included into the trial, and the overall young age of the patient population prevents 
firm conclusion on differences or similarities with regard to gender and age. However, based on the 
limited evaluations possible (and those to potentially be presented in addition from the long-term 
data), an influence of gender and age on the rates of relapses appears unlikely.  
An effect on the long-term sequelae of EoE, namely stricture formation (as assessed by endoscopy) or 
the occurrence of food impaction events could not be demonstrated but might be due to a relevantly 
longer time needed for observation for this type of endpoint. Similarly, the effects of the compound – 
even in the 48-week treatment – on the alteration of eating behaviour appear to be clinically not fully 
relevant, although some effect could be detected, in the relevant subscores of the EEsAI-PRO. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 46/72 
  
  
The data are in accordance with the protocol assistance given during early development and 
considering results on histological remission and the fact that patients did not only maintain a state of 
being free of symptoms in a high rate, but also had a relevant superior experience of their quality of 
life in the long-term, as compared to the patients treated with placebo the efficacy of Jorveza for the 
long-term treatment can be considered demonstrated. 
The most stringent secondary endpoint “deep disease remission”, i.e., deep clinical, deep endoscopic 
and histological remission showed a clinically relevant higher efficacy in the 1 mg BID group (52.9%) 
compared to the 0.5 mg BID group (39.7%), indicating that a higher dose of budesonide is of 
advantage to achieve and maintain deep disease remission. A maintenance dose of 1 mg budesonide 
twice daily is recommended for patients with a long-standing disease history and/or high extent of 
esophageal inflammation in their acute disease state because relevantly higher rates of being free from 
treatment failure were achieved in these subgroups (80% vs 70%, and 80% vs 68%).  
The open-label extension of the study (as well as the open-label re-treatment in part of the patient 
population) was ongoing at the time of submission of the presented evaluation. Currently, the duration 
of maintenance therapy is determined by the treating physician which is acceptable. As final data from 
this study (BUL-2/EER) could however add relevant information to the prescriber, the marketing 
authorisation holder is recommended to submit the final study report for regulatory assessment once 
available. 
The applicant has committed to further investigate the compound also in children, which was, 
however, not the subject of the current submission. The applicant is, however, encouraged to further 
engage into the development in children. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Clinical efficacy of the compound – while being demonstrated already for the short-term treatment up 
to 12 weeks, in order to achieve a state of remission – has now also been convincingly demonstrated 
for the long-term treatment (at either 0.5 mg BID or 1 mg BID depending on individual clinical 
requirement), showing that patients in remission can be kept in such state for at least 1 year in a high 
proportion. Available data from long-term open-label extension studies beyond 1 year support the 
conclusion that remission can be kept up for even relevantly longer duration. 
As stated already in the assessment of the initial marketing authorisation there is a high unmet 
medical need for the development of an age appropriate pharmaceutical formulation in children. The 
MAH is recommended to further engage in this development. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
This submission mainly concerns a line extension, and a change in posology with extension of the 
treatment duration (unlimited). The documentation of safety for the short-term treatment, as 
previously submitted, is therefore not relevantly altered. 
Patient exposure 
In the clinical trials in this submission (both short-term, as well as long-term studies), 368 subjects of 
patients with EoE (i.e. 31 healthy subjects and 337 patients) received at least 1 dose of budesonide; of 
those, 318 patients with EoE were exposed to budesonide orodispersible tablets. The numbers are 
displayed in Table 20, however, this table excludes the numbers from study BUL-6/BIO.

For the DB phase of the newly submitted study BUL-2/EER, the exposure was relevantly different 
between the active treatment groups and the placebo group. BUL 0.5mg BID was administered on 
average on 308 days (SD: 87.0 days‚ median: 337 days), BUL 1mg BID was administered on average 
on 310 days (SD: 80.3 days‚ median: 336 days), and placebo medication was administered on average 
on 164 days (SD: 132.9 days‚ median: 97 days) in the FAS-DB. 
From the overall number of 204 patients from the DB phase, 82 patients entered the OLRI phase. The 
exposure in the OLE phase of study BUL-2/EER with the data lock-point 29 October 2019 comprises 
186 patients from the 3 groups of the DB phase during the first year (OLE 1), and 159 patients for the 
second year (OLE 2). The mean duration of IMP intake during OLE 1 phase was 328 days. At the time 
of the data lock-point, 94 patients have already completed the OLE-2 phase. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) during OLI Phase of Study BUL-2/EER: 
All of the following analyses are based on the safety analysis set OLI phase (SAF-OLI): In total, 300 
AEs occurred in 123 patients (68.0%); 52 AEs in 35 patients (19.3%) were classified as pre-OLI 
treatment AEs, 5 AEs in 4 patients (2.2%) were classified as post-OLI treatment AEs, and 243 AEs in 
112 patients (61.9%) were classified as OLI treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs). 
A total of 95 AEs in 60 patients (33.1%) were rated as adverse drug reactions (ADRs), as a causal 
relationship with budesonide was considered at least possible. All reported ADRs were OLI treatment 
emergent ADRs.

Suspected candidiasis AEs affected overall 13 patients (19.1%) in the BUL 0.5mg BID group, 10 
patients (14.7%) in the BUL 1mg BID group, and no patients in the Placebo group. Some patients had 
more than one candidiasis infection in different subcategories. The balanitis candidiasis, genital 
candidiasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis were assessed by the investigator as not related to the IMP, 
one oesophageal candidiasis and one oral candidiasis AE were assessed as unlikely related to the IMP, 
all other candidiasis AEs were assessed with at least possible relationship to the IMP. During the initial 
application, the applicant has claimed that the rate of candidiasis events was reported high also due to 
the fact that all investigators had been instructed to search for the respective events, and that any 
deterioration was also leading to the suspicion of – besides the deterioration of the underlying disease 
–oesophageal candidiasis. This has indeed been confirmed in additional analyses submitted. 
Nevertheless, oesophageal candidiasis remains the most important ADR also in long-term treatment 
with a rate of 6.6% in the double-blind phase of study BUL-2/EER, and a rate of 14% in the open-label 
extension phase, as reported by the presented interim analyses.

Serious adverse events/deaths/other significant events 
In the SAF-OLI, which includes pre-OLI, on OLI, and post-OLI-FU events, 3 serious adverse events 
(SAEs) occurred in 3 patients (1.7%). One SAE occurred pre-OLI treatment (SAE PT: depression), and 
2 SAEs were OLI treatment-emergent (SAE PTs: fibula fracture, viral tracheitis). All 3 SAEs were 
assessed by investigator as not related to IMP, and the reason for classifying the AE as serious was 
hospitalisation. There was also one SAE in a screening failure patient. This patient experienced Mallory-
Weiss-Syndrome. 
All events were assessed as not related and were resolved at the time of last reporting. 
In the SAF-DB period of study BUL-2/EER, which includes post-induction pre-DB, on DB, post-DB pre-
OL, and post-DB-FU events, 4 SAEs occurred in 3 patients (4.4%) in the BUL 0.5mg BID group (SAE 
PTs: cartilage injury, upper limb fracture, sinusitis, inguinal hernia), one SAE occurred in one patient 
(1.5%) in the BUL 1mg BID group (SAE PT: skull fracture), and no SAE occurred in the Placebo group. 
All 5 SAEs were DB treatment-emergent and assessed by investigator as not related to IMP.

Due to the interim character of the submitted data, and the fact that only single events were reported, 
a final conclusion on causality could not be drawn at this point of time. 
Laboratory findings 
The applicant provided listings and tables of statistics of laboratory values with regard to means/mean 
changes from baseline, frequencies of values within, above, and below the normal range, as well as 
shift tables for changes. As seen in the previously conducted studies, the most pronounced effects 
were seen on eosinophil counts.  
There was also a slight imbalance for the decrease of cortisol, especially for morning cortisol. The 
applicant presented a detailed analysis of patients who showed shifts towards low cortisol (below the 
lower limit of normal (LLN; i.e., 6.2 µg/dL) during the OLI and DB phase of study BUL-2/EER. Although 
some discrepancies in the analysis were noted, it is agreed with the applicant that most of cases of 
reduced cortisol do show levels very close to normal (between 5-6 µg/dl), and there is only 1 case in 
each of the trial phases for which a level at or below 1 µg/dl was shown (and both cases received the 
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 55/72 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
high dose). Overall, in the clear majority of the observed morning (8:00-9:00 a.m.) serum cortisol 
level values below the LLN were assessed by the investigator as being not clinically relevant. 
The parameters measuring bone metabolism did not show relevant changes. 
Safety in special populations 
No analyses in relevant subpopulations or special populations are presented. An analysis of AEs in 
patients with older age (those above 65, 75, or even 85) appeared not sensible for the initial 
submission, and is also not considered sensible for the later submission of the long-term study, 
because the overall number of such patients was too low (in fact the oldest patient was 69 years of 
age). The applicant has analysed an age cut-off at 35 years for the initial submission. However, any 
relevant differences between young and older patients could not be detected. A similar analysis with 
similar results was conducted for gender. 
Immunological events 
No special reports on immunological events have been presented by the applicant. 
There were 3 events during the initial clinical development programme potentially related to 
immunological events, which were labelled as cases of “lip oedema” and of which two cases have been 
identified as being related to the intake of the study medication. Obviously, in one case, the lip 
oedema was associated with oral paraesthesia, but in none of the cases was there any indication of 
systemic involvement, such as skin efflorescences, influence on blood pressure (in the sense of a 
syncopal event), or any difficulty in breathing. Therefore, while the causation of systemic allergic 
reaction cannot be excluded in the future, there is currently no clear indication that the three cases 
were involving any systemic allergic reaction 
For the newly submitted data the number of AEs attributed to the SOC “immune system disorders” was 
one in each of the treatment arms and there was no event in this SOC for the evaluation of ADRs. 
Some regrouping and a re-evaluation of the frequency of events has been proposed for the SmPC/PL, 
which is acceptable. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interactions study was performed in support of this application. 
With regard to potential changes in the safety profile by drug-drug interactions, the MAH referred, in 
the context of the initial MAA, to theoretical considerations only and the data from pharmacovigilance 
with their capsule formulations used in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). An additional analysis of the 
clinical data was performed, but did not reveal meaningful results, because most of the concomitant 
medication was given during the endoscopic procedures as part of the trial conduct, and the AEs 
reported for these cases were also mostly related to the endoscopic procedures performed. A 
conclusion with regard to the causation of AEs by concomitant medication cannot be drawn.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, 7 AEs in 7 patients (10.3%) in the BUL 0.5mg BID group, 9 AEs in 8 patients (11.8%) in the 
BUL 1mg BID group, and 43 AEs in 42 patients (61.8%) in the Placebo group led to discontinuation of 
DB IMP. The AEs leading to withdrawal are displayed in the following table:

Withdrawals were mainly related to the aggravation of the underlying condition. Other events leading 
to withdrawal were only singular in occurrence, and conclusions are therefore difficult to take. 
Post marketing experience 
The MAH included two PSURs into the submission. 
In the period from 08 January 2018 to 07 January 2019 (i.e. in the periods covered by PSUR 2018 
from 08 January 2018 to 07 July 2018 and PSUR 2019, (08 July 2018 to 07 January 2019)), 
budesonide orodispersible tablets were used for an estimated 7,917 patient treatment cycles. 
In the periods covered by both PSURs, there were no changes to the reference safety information of 
Jorveza. 
During the period covered by the most recent PSUR 2019, a total of 182 suspected ADRs in 83 patients 
associated with intake of budesonide (all budesonide dosage forms, i.e. Jorveza 1mg orodispersible 
tablets, Budenofalk 3 mg gastro-resistant capsules, 9 mg gastro-resistant granules and 2 mg rectal 
foam) were reported to the MAH. A total of 152 ADRs in 69 patients were related to the intake of 
Budenofalk (all three dosage forms), whereas 30 ADRs in 14 patients were related to the intake of 
Jorveza. Of the ADRs reported for Jorveza, 1 reaction (PT: angioedema) was serious and unlisted, 1 
reaction (PT: rash generalised) serious and listed. In addition, 22 non-serious, unlisted and 6 non-
serious, listed ADRs have been documented. No reports on deaths were received. 
Most frequently, ADRs relating to the use of Jorveza were reported in the SOC Respiratory, thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders (7 ADRs in 4 patients), followed by Gastrointestinal disorders (6 suspected 
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 57/72 
  
  
 
ADRs in 4 patients), and Infections and infestations (4 ADRs in 4 patients). There were 6 reports of off-
label use.  
The safety information reviewed in the PSURs are in line with the known safety profile of Jorveza and 
did not change the benefit-risk profile. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In support of the present application, the applicant has filed a new study (BUL-2/EER), documenting 
the long-term treatment over a duration of 48 weeks. The study also included an open-label induction 
part, with the documentation of short-term treatment for 6 weeks in 181 additional patients, which 
exceeds already the total number of patients assessed during the initial submission. 
A total of 138 patients from the OLI phase of the study were included into the following double-blind 
part of study BUL-2/EER, documenting long-term treatment for the prevention of relapse. The study 
also included a number of 66 patients transferred from the short-term efficacy trial BUL-1/EEA. 
The DB phase of the study included a total of 204 patients treated (as scheduled) for 48 weeks, and 
therefore relevantly extending the documented length of exposure. The number of patients with a 
documentation of long-term treatment does not fully comply with the ICH guideline E118 (at least 300 
patients for 6 months, and at least 100 patients for 1 year). However, this is considered acceptable 
based on the orphan disease status of the product. 
During the DB phase of the newly submitted study BUL-2/EER, the mean days on investigational 
compound was significantly different between the active treatment groups, and the placebo group, 
with about only half of the time spent on study drug for the placebo group. 
Although a full evaluation of safety is somewhat hampered by the fact that the OLI phase was not 
controlled, the OLI phase of the study BUL-2/EER very closely reflects the observations of the earlier 
short-term studies, in terms of nature, frequency, and severity of AEs. 
In similar way, the number and type of AEs observed during long-term treatment, at least for those 
events occurring more frequently than only once or twice, largely resemble the observations of the 
short-term treatment studies. 
The main type of AEs occurs in the SOC “gastrointestinal disorders”, with a wide range of “functional” 
complaints, but also with uncommon occurrence of erosive gastritis and gastric ulcer. Consequently, 
the following ADRs have been added in the SmPC with a frequency uncommon: abdominal pain, dry 
mouth, dysphagia, erosive gastritis, gastric ulcer, glossodynia and lip edema. Dyspepsia is added with 
a frequency common and upper abdominal pain moved from frequency common to uncommon.  
The highest frequency of AEs is again observed in the SOC “infections and infestations” with oral, 
pharyngeal, and oesophageal candidiasis taking the highest share of AEs in the actively treated 
population, while no such events were observed in the placebo group. During the long-term treatment 
(both DB and OLE phases) the investigators were not instructed to search for (especially oesophageal) 
candidiasis events with the same rigour as in the short-term study. Nevertheless, the fact that the 
overall frequency of such events is not increased despite the most relevantly longer observation period 
of study BUL-2/EER compared with the previously submitted data is considered reassuring.

Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 58/72 
  
  
 
 
Otherwise, common AEs were also observed for headache (which had also been observed in the short-
term studies), and there was a couple of additional uncommon events such as sleep disorder, 
dizziness, dysgeusia, dry eye, cough, dry throat, rash, urticaria and sensation of foreign body. These 
uncommon ADRs have been added in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Also a number of AE cases were observed relating to the potential systemic action of corticosteroids, 
such as “cortisol decreased”. As reported, again, no indication is seen that systemic glucocorticosteroid 
effects would occur in clinically relevant numbers. Blood cortisol decreased is an already known ADR 
listed as common in the SmPC. 
Most of the AEs (and ADRs) observed were of mild intensity, and only a couple of serious AEs occurred 
during the course of the OLI and DB phases of the new trial submitted. After review of the details of 
these cases, it is concluded that in none of these cases a clear conclusion on relatedness to the study 
drug can be drawn. There were no deaths during the newly submitted study. 
Overall, the laboratory evaluations were unremarkable, with the most pronounced effect relating to the 
eosinophil count, rather reflecting pharmacodynamics activity/efficacy (or the lack thereof) than any 
safety related issue. Small decreases in serum cortisol were observed overall, and the number of 
patients with shifts towards low cortisol values was consistently higher in the active treatment groups. 
From the data submitted, however, the clinical relevance of these events appears doubtful. There 
appear to be no consistent effects on markers of bone turnover. 
During the reporting period of PSUR 2019, no changes to the reference safety information have been 
made, and questions arose with regard to the occurrence of especially SAEs from clinical trials. These 
concerns have adequately been addressed, especially with regard to the additional submission of the 
updated safety analysis of the ongoing long-term extension study. Furthermore the marketing 
authorisation holder is recommended to submit the final evaluation from the OLRI and OLE phases of 
study BUL-2/EER for regulatory assessment as soon as available.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
No paediatric data are available at this time point. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The submission of the long-term study BUL-2/EER has broadened the safety database for the 
compound under evaluation in relevant way. Both phases of the trial that have been presented (the 
OLI and the DB phase) have largely confirmed the overall acceptable safety profile of the compound, 
being unlikely to exert the typical “systemic” effects of corticosteroids. However, the known potential 
to cause a relevant number of fungal infections of the upper GI tract has also been confirmed, but the 
fear of relevantly increased rates of these infections in long-term treatment could not be verified. To 
the contrary, the rate of occurrence of these events appeared to be in the same level as in the short-
term studies submitted previously and can be adequately managed with existing wordings in the 
product information. The further effects identified as risks are either well known effects of budesonide 
(headache) or are presumably related to the influence of high concentrations of budesonide on the 
lower oesophagus sphincter or the stomach, relating to the observed cases of nausea, dyspepsia, as 
well as gastroesophageal reflux disease. A couple of other events have also been detected, either 
being identified as ADR by the investigators, or occurred more frequently in the placebo group, as 
compared to the active group. The SmPC is updated to reflect these ADRs as uncommon.  
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 59/72 
  
  
Overall, as for other formulations of budesonide to be administered in the gastrointestinal tract, the 
safety profile is considered acceptable, because only a low risk of systemic effects has been identified. 
Local effects, however, appear to play a higher role (as compared to what is known for the capsule 
formulation), with the occurrence of a high rate of fungal infections and some “functional” complaints 
of the upper digestive tract. This is adequately reflected in the product information. 
Although the safety profile and specific risks associated with the administration of budesonide 
(glucocorticosteroids) are considered known and thoroughly described in the literature, the marketing 
authorisation holder is recommended to provide the safety data from the two subsequent phases of 
study BUL-2/EER for regulatory assessment as soon as available. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
Safety concerns 
The applicant justified the removal of all the safety concerns initially included in the RMP following an 
update to align to GVP V rev2. All risks have been removed based on the fact that these are 
appropriately described in the SmPC and that health professionals are already aware of such risks and 
have the appropriate measures implemented as part of clinical practice.   
Therefore, no safety concerns remain in the RMP.  
Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.1 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
It is considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable as there are no relevant 
changes in the wording of the package leaflet that would impact the readability of the product 
information.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Jorveza (budesonide) is indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) in adults (older 
than 18 years of age). The current recommended posology is a daily dose of 2 mg of budesonide as 1-
mg tablet in the morning and 1-mg tablet in the evening. The usual duration of treatment is 6 weeks. 
For patients who are not appropriately responding during 6 weeks the treatment can be extended to up 
to 12 weeks. 
In the present application, a new additional strength (0.5 mg orodispersible tablet) is introduced. In 
addition, the previously restricted treatment duration (6-12 weeks maximum) is proposed to be 
extended to infinite duration (at the discretion of the treating physician).  
The condition Eosinophilic Oesophagitis had not been subject of a MAA for a medicinal product before 
2017. The condition itself was described in the early 1990s, and during the last 10 years scientific 
consensus in the field, defined the disease, its epidemiology, aetiology and pathophysiology, clinical 
manifestations, as well as treatment and prognosis. 
The disease is defined by an eosinophil invasion to and inflammation of the oesophageal lining, 
presenting clinically in adults with relevant complaints such as dysphagia, odynophagia, food avoidance 
behaviour, and – in more advanced stages – the development of oesophageal fibrosis and stenosis, 
including the clinical manifestation of food impaction. 
The anti-inflammatory treatment with budesonide addresses – by its mode of action – clearly the 
identified molecular pathways of inflammation, and has shown – even before the conduct of any trial 
with the product under consideration – to induce a rapid reduction of the inflammatory changes in the 
mucosa. 
Whereas the postulate of both, clinicians as well as pathologists/pathophysiologists, has been that 
eosinophil blood cells are not regular part of the oesophageal mucosa, and should therefore completely 
be abolished from the oesophageal mucosa, the last years have brought about the development of 
consensus criteria what an “eosinophilic inflammation of the oesophagus” constitutes, and how its 
restitution should be defined. 
In addition, there was growing consensus in the scientific community, that the treatment aims should 
not only be based on a success in the treatment of the inflammatory, histologically diagnosed 
sequelae, but also benefit the patients from the point of symptoms, improvement of quality of life, as 
well as normalisation of eating behaviour and prevention of complications such as oesophageal fibrosis 
and food impaction. 
Recent research has also more clearly clarified than at the time of submission of the initial MAA that 
the condition most likely needs a continuous treatment, and the tendency to relapse is high in most 
patients. 
The aim of therapy is therefore foremost the treatment and prevention of the inflammatory changes 
within the oesophagus, and the reduction (or cure) of the associated symptoms. Long-term treatment 
is aimed to keep the oesophagus inflammation free, and prevent symptoms from re-occurring.  
The long-term consequences of ongoing inflammation and symptoms are the development of fibrotic 
changes in the oesophageal lining, narrowing of the oesophageal lumen, and formation of strictures. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 61/72 
  
  
The consequences for the patients are modification of eating behaviour, avoiding of certain types of 
food, and finally oesophageal obstruction, and need for endoscopic disimpaction, and dilatation 
treatment. However, the current application has not specifically aimed at demonstrating an influence 
on these long-term consequences. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The treatment modalities available before the approval of Jorveza relied on one part on the off-label 
use of available medicinal products. These comprised proton-pump inhibitors, which can be used to 
treat EoE patients, as well as on the extemporaneous use of inhalational topical corticosteroid 
medications (to be opened and swallowed, or used to prepare suspensions), with the inherent dangers 
of missing standardisation, and inconsistent treatment results. This unmet medical need has been met 
by the introduction of the compound with the strength of 1 mg, to be used in short-term up to 12 
weeks of duration. 
The condition can also be treated with dietary treatment, of which for at least 3 modalities (elemental 
diet, exclusion diet based on allergy testing, and “elimination diets” (e.g. SFED, FFED)) clinical data are 
available, and of which the latter has shown the most promising results and may indeed be considered 
to be used before, in addition to, or after failing of, treatment with medicinal products. 
With this application, the applicant has submitted a long-term maintenance trial, documenting the 
need for long-term treatment. This need for long-term treatment was not fully clear at the time of 
filing the initial MAA, and study supporting that indeed a high rate of and usually quite fast occurrence 
of relapse is regularly part of the disease spectrum have only been published in the years 2018 and 
2019. The application with the intent to include recommendations for an infinite treatment duration is 
therefore meeting an unmet medical need, which had not (yet) been addressed by the initial MA. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
For the initial MAA, the MAH had presented study BUL-1/EEA as the one and only pivotal efficacy safety 
study. The study was a randomised, placebo-controlled parallel-group, multi-centre double-blind study 
in patients with EoE being unresponsive to PPIs to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the compound.  
The study was a relatively small study comprising 88 patients which were randomised unequally (2:1) 
to active (orodispersible budesonide tablet dosed 2x1 mg daily) and placebo treatment, and treated in 
double-blind manner for 6 weeks. Patients could enter an open-label extension phase of further 6 
weeks if not satisfactorily treated at the end of the double-blind period. 
For this grouped variation, the applicant has presented the results of study BUL-2/EER. This study was 
also a randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, parallel-group study. It included patients brought 
into remission during the previous study BUL-1/EEA, but also included an open-label induction phase, 
in which patients similar to the study BUL-1/EEA were included, and treated with Jorveza 1 mg 
orodispersible tablets for 6 weeks. Patients in remission from these two “feeder studies” were then 
randomised 1:1:1 into treatment with 0.5 mg budesonide orodispersible tablets BID, 1 mg budesonide 
orodispersible tablets BID, or placebo BID. The duration of this phase of the study was 48 weeks. 
The patients were observed at regular study visits for the recurrence of symptoms, and, in case such 
was observed, also for the recurrence of the endoscopic and histological changes in the oesophagus (at 
the time of the visit, or, in case no clinical deterioration was observed, at the end of the treatment 
period). The included patients had previously – similarly to the short-term study – partially already 
been treated with other treatment modalities (PPIs and dietary).

EMA/199925/2020 
Page 62/72 
  
  
The open-label induction phase of the study comprised 181 patients (of which 126 entered the DB 
phase), and the DB phase of the study comprised 204 patients. The objectives of the trial were again 
the evaluation of efficacy as well as safety. The endpoint chosen was the occurrence of “treatment 
failure”, consisting of either clinical relapse, histological relapse, or the occurrence of food impaction, 
need for endoscopic dilation, or premature withdrawal for any reason. The single components of this 
were defined as secondary, along with (other) evaluations of histology and or a PRO scale. These 
endpoints are also considered to be in accordance with the recommendations given by the CHMP. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
For the long-term study BUL-2/EER, the primary endpoint of being free of treatment failure was 
reached by more than 70% of the patients in the two active treatment groups, while only 4.4% of the 
patients treated with placebo remained free of treatment failure. This effect was highly statistically 
significant (p<0.0001 one-sided), with the lower boundary of the 97.5% CI for the difference showing 
an at least 55%-57% superiority of active treatment over placebo. 
The study included a range of 5 key secondary endpoints which were tested in hierarchical manner. All 
of these endpoints also demonstrated high statistical significance (p-value<0.0001 one-sided) in fully 
consistent manner for both doses. These comprised the occurrence of histological relapse (observed in 
89% in the placebo group, and 10 and 13% in the active treatment groups), the change in eosinophil 
infiltration (assessed by high-power field in microscopy as eos/mm2 hpf), which showed 262 eos/hpf in 
the placebo group, and 38 and 21 eos/hpf in the 0.5 mg and 1 mg active treatment groups. The 
endpoint clinical relapse showed a rate of 10 and 7% in the 0.5 mg and 1 mg treatment groups, 
compared to a 60.3% relapse rate for the placebo group. The rate of “maintenance of remission” 
according to the EEsAI-PRO (with the criterion EEsAI-PRO≤20) was 72 and 73% for the 0.5 mg and 1 
mg active treatment groups, and 20% for the placebo group. The rate of patients being in “deep 
remission” (=being in deep clinical, deep endoscopic, as well as histological remission) was 39 and 
53% for the 0.5 mg and 1 mg active treatment groups, but 0.0% for placebo. 
Similar to the short-term study, the results of the long-term study appeared to be extremely robust 
with regard to the demonstration of efficacy in subgroups (e.g., country, centre, path to remission, 
localisation and extent of inflammation at screening, history of allergic disease, and the time since the 
first symptoms of the disease). Subgrouping with regard to age and sex were presented as far as 
sensible, but did not reveal relevant differences. Further evaluations with regard to the extent of 
inflammation within the oesophagus, and with regard to the disease duration indicated the need for 
treatment recommendations with regard to dose, with the recommendation to use the higher dose in 
those patients with a long-standing disease history, and with more extensive inflammatory changes.  
The study also showed that the median time to relapse was only 86 days for the patients in the 
placebo group (compared to more than 330 days in the active treatment groups), demonstrating that 
more than 50% of the patients can be expected to have a relapse within 3 months. 
In addition, the MAH evaluated a numerous range of exploratory secondary endpoints, ranging from 
scales of global well-being, single symptoms, time-related evaluations, endoscopy-based evaluations, 
subscores of the EEsAI-PRO, as well as quality of life scores, which almost all showed highly relevant 
and statistically significant results. 
Besides the long-term efficacy results, the OLI phase of the trial confirmed in a relatively high number 
of patients (181 patients included as opposed to 59 for which short-term efficacy was documented 
previously) that about 70% of the patients can be brought into remission within 6 weeks. This result is 
considered to be reassuring with regard to the earlier documentation of short-term efficacy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 63/72 
  
  
Interim data available from the OLRI and OLE studies also support the above conclusions. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
As it has been shown in the display of the main results, there was no obvious effect on the avoidance 
strategies of the patients with regard to food intake. It is reasonable to assume that these behavioural 
changes only take place over longer periods of time, and can therefore not be determined by the 
conducted studies. This is true for the short-term treatment trial, but also for the long-term prevention 
trial where on the respective subscales of the EEsAI-PRO scale only minor differences in favour of 
active treatment were found. 
Similarly, the effect on prevention of complications of the disease could not be directly evaluated, 
because only one patient (in the placebo group) during the course of the short-term study developed a 
food impaction. A similar result was observed in the long-term prevention study, where also only one 
patient in the placebo group developed this complication. 
There are subgroups of patients for which the available information is relatively limited which relates to 
the female gender (only 15 patients included in the initial pivotal short-term trial were female, whereas 
35 female patients were included in the long-term trial), and to elderly patients (the oldest patient 
included into the phase III studies was 69). However, overall, the influence of age on efficacy has been 
found to be negligible. Explorative evaluations of the pharmacokinetic data at the time of initial 
licensing revealed that the PK is overall not relevantly dependent on the factors age and gender. 
Furthermore, based on the limited evaluations possible, an influence of gender and age on the rates of 
AEs appears unlikely.  
While the initial small study conducted was not designed to answer the question whether the resolution 
of symptoms, and more so, the resolution of the inflammation does indeed bring about the prevention 
of the fibrosis and stenosis development, it now appears that even 1-year data are not fully suitable to 
document such an effect, at least not in a population that had been in remission at the start of the 
observation period. The number of patients with food impaction which needed endoscopic intervention 
was 1 patient in the placebo group only, and none in the active treatment groups, while in the AE 
reporting, food impaction (without endoscopic intervention) was noted in 2 patients in the placebo 
group, and 3 patients in the 1 mg active dosing group, while no such case was reported for the low-
dose active treatment group. Furthermore, the presented data do not directly address the question 
whether the long-term treatment would alter the disease course as a “disease modifying” agent 
including long term positive influence on the fibrotic changes in the oesophagus, and prevention of 
food impaction, and/or need for dilation. However, considering the clinically relevant results provided 
based on the primary and numerous secondary endpoints of the pivotal study this is not considered 
decisive for the conclusion on risk-benefit ratio in this orphan disease. The need for ongoing 
maintenance treatment, has therefore been sufficiently demonstrated.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the initial submission from the short-term data, the known immunosuppressive effects of 
budesonide have shown to cause a relatively high rate of fungal infections in all tissues exposed to 
(local) high concentrations of the active substance, such as the mouth, pharynx and oesophagus. The 
rate of such infections is obviously up to 5% of the patients for the mouth and pharynx, and about up 
to 20% for the oesophagus. This is regarded to be a high occurrence rate considering the short 
treatment period of only 6 weeks. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 64/72 
  
  
In addition, almost similar rates for these infections occur in those being treated in the open-label 
extension phase with previous placebo treatment, and the rate seems to be little lower in those 
previously treated with active medication.  
During the long-term study, however, the rate of observed (suspected and confirmed) cases of 
candidiasis was not relevantly further increased, and appeared to be overall rather lower than 
observed in the initial study, with a rate of 10.3% of oesophageal candidiasis, and of 4.4% of 
oropharyngeal candidiasis. 
The intake of the orodispersible tablets also induces additional upper GI symptoms such as dyspepsia, 
nausea and gastroesophageal reflux symptoms in up to 5% of the patients (5%-10% in the long-term 
study). The orodispersible tablets also induce the known effects of budesonide in some patients (e.g. 
such as headache with about 7% in short term, and 20% in the long-term), and the adverse effects 
“blood cortisol decreased” and hypertension (up to 5%, but at lower rates in the long-term study), 
which relate to the known systemic effects of all glucocorticosteroids. In the short-term study, none of 
any other observed AE occurred at a frequency higher than in the placebo group, or was attributed to 
be causally related to the study drug intake, or occurred more than once only during the trial 
programme. 
In the long-term study, additional AEs/ADRs were identified by the applicant, relating to sleep disorder, 
dizziness, dysgeusia, dry eye, cough, dry throat, abdominal pain, dry mouth, dysphagia, erosive 
gastritis, gastric ulcer, glossodynia, lip edema, rash, urticaria and sensation of foreign body which now 
complement the listed ADRs in the product information. In addition, based on the evaluation of 
differential frequencies, biological plausibility, as well as previous inclusion in product information of 
other oral dosage forms of budesonide products anxiety was included as ADR in the product 
information with a frequency uncommon. 
The vast majority of AEs were described as mild, and only a minority as moderate and none (in the 
active treatment group) to be severe in intensity. There were no serious AEs during the short-term 
controlled trial, and the serious events that occurred during the OLI or DB phase of the long-term trial 
have been assessed as not or unlikely be related to the study drug intake. There were no deaths 
during the course of any of the studies. 
As far as available at this point of time, the safety evaluation of the long-term extension phase of the 
trial BUL-2/EER confirmed the safety profile of the short-term studies, and of the double-blind phase 
but the MAH is recommended to present the final evaluation of the open-label extension phase of the 
trial BUL-2/EER as soon as available. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
During the short-term trial submitted for the initial MAA, for the main identified unfavourable effects, 
the fungal infections, the MAH has partly investigated the histology specimens to prove or disprove the 
presence of fungal infection, which showed that in the smaller part of the events, such an infection 
could not be verified. However, it is unclear whether this related to a real effect, because no culture (or 
other microbiological method, e.g. PCR-based methods) had been performed to exclude fungal 
infection, and because the biopsy specimens only covered a minority of the oesophageal lining. 
However, it is acknowledged that fungal infection and EoE may not readily be distinguishable from 
endoscopic inspection only and that a part of the fungal infections in the oesophagus might have been 
misdiagnosed. Different instructions have been given to investigators during the long-term trial, and 
only those events related to clinical symptoms have been reported as AEs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 65/72 
  
  
The causation of upper GI symptoms such as nausea, dyspepsia and reflux complaints (and some of 
the additional ADRs identified in the long-term study) remains (patho)-physiologically unexplained, but 
may indeed be related to the high exposure to corticosteroids, with an influence on gastric and lower 
oesophageal sphincter motility. However, for the time being, the events are labelled as adverse 
reactions.  
Also, whether the few cases of hypertension are indications of systemic effects will remain uncertain, 
similar to the clinical meaningfulness of the “investigation-based” AEs of “cortisol decreased”, and the 
singular cases of gastric erosions and ulcer. However, a theoretical potential for the influence of the 
compound on the HPA-axis is reflected in the section 4.4 of the SmPC which is considered adequate. 
The low number of female patients included into the trial, and the overall young age of the patient 
population prevents firm conclusion on differences or similarities with regard to gender and age.  
However, based on the limited evaluations possible (and those to potentially be presented in addition 
from the long-term data), an influence of gender and age on the rates of AEs appears unlikely.  
Similarly, an analysis looking into the potential for drug-drug interactions and their influence on 
unfavourable effects, turned out to be not meaningful due to the small size of the database of the 
short-term study. 
Since the duration of treatment and posology is not limited in the proposed SmPC, the submitted data 
from the 48-week clinical trial does not describe the long-term safety of budesonide beyond one year. 
Whilst the submitted data base is considered to sufficiently support the proposed label, the marketing 
authorisation holder is recommended to submit results from the two subsequent phases of study BUL-
2/EER.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The single pivotal trial BUL-1/EEA was able to show not only the well-known effects on the resolution 
of the eosinophil infiltrations into the oesophageal mucosa as described in the literature, but also a 
highly significant, and overall clinically most relevant reduction of the symptoms to a level which 
patients perceived as either “no” or “minimal” only. The previous results of the trials published in the 
field have therefore been confirmed, despite the relatively short treatment duration, for the endoscopic 
and histological evaluations. But as one of few studies only, a clinically highly relevant and convincing 
benefit in symptom improvement has been shown. It appears somehow self-evident that this could be 
attributed to the new pharmaceutical form, designed for and directed at the treatment of oesophageal 
inflammation. In addition, a multitude of evaluations of symptoms other than the (component of the) 
primary endpoint, of endoscopic signs, and of additional histological evaluations have also shown a 
high magnitude of superiority of the active treatment over placebo, indicating a high clinical relevance. 
Despite the small trial size, a high concordance of the results across relevant subgroups could be 
shown, which indicates an unexpected high robustness of the results. 
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 68/72 
  
  
The results of this controlled short-term trial have been confirmed with the open-label induction phase 
of the trial BUL-2/EER, achieving similar rates of remission (similarly defined as in the controlled study) 
for a considerably higher number of patients. However, no control group was included. 
The DB phase of study BUL-2/EER was able to demonstrate that patients having been brought into 
remission with a 6- or 12-week course of orodispersible tablets 1 mg BID, can be reliably maintained in 
clinical and histological remission for a prolonged time with both doses of the product. At one year, the 
rates of remission were highly statistically significantly superior compared to placebo treatment, and a 
most clinically relevant superiority could be seen, both for the prevention of recurrence of symptoms, 
as well as for the endoscopic, and histological sequelae of the disease. The time to relapse was most 
relevantly shorter for the placebo treated group, as compared to the active treatment group. There 
was no statistically significant difference, or clinically relevant difference between the two doses 
investigated in this trial. The patients not only maintained a state of being free of symptoms in a high 
rate, but also had a relevant superior experience of their quality of life in the long-term, as compared 
to the patients treated with placebo. 
Concentrating on the histological picture, it has been shown that more than 90% of the patients can 
expect the full resolution of the eosinophil inflammation after short term treatment, thereby providing 
the pre-condition for the prevention of the long-term sequelae of the disease, the development of 
fibrosis and stenosis of the oesophagus, and its complications. In addition, the observed (almost full) 
symptom resolution in about 60% of the patients, which is 4-5 times more likely to occur than for 
placebo after 6 weeks, may even be increased to 85% (34 patients in the initial treatment phase and 
16 in the open-label extension phase), if the treatment is prolonged to 12 weeks. 
The long-term study has confirmed the positive influence on the histological picture of the EoE, 
demonstrating that a mucosa without relevant infiltration of eosinophils, or without eosinophil 
infiltration at all can be prevented in a high percentage of patients, while almost no patients under 
placebo did have no eosinophil infiltration at the end of the observation period. 
The long-term extension study – as far as available and although open-label in trial design – could 
confirm the maintenance of the effects with regard to symptoms and well-being, as well as with regard 
to histology and endoscopy.  
However, even during the long-term study, an effect on the long-term consequences of the disease 
could not be shown, because the number of events, such as food impaction or oesophageal dilation 
due to stricture formation were too low. Despite this long-term study having investigated a relevantly 
longer time period, this potential benefit of the treatment could not be established, which could be due 
to the fact that – due to the need for rescue treatment once symptom and histological relapse was 
confirmed – the patients were included in an open-label re-induction trial, and thus the observation 
period on placebo was too short. 
During the short-term trial, the course of the symptom severity in the placebo group during the first 6 
weeks of treatment has indicated that for placebo treatment, no further improvement can be expected 
after 4 weeks. The trial results have also indicated that the deterioration of the quality of life of the 
patients suffering from EoE could be reversed according to the evaluation of the two Quality of Life 
scales used in the trial. However, the observation time appeared to be too short to allow conclusions 
on clear improvements in QoL. 
As a consequence of the limited programme conducted, the safety database was limited at the initial 
time of MA. However, even at that time, the evaluation of the safety database did not reveal 
completely unexpected findings, but confirmed the known AE/reaction profile of the substance 
budesonide. The phase II as well as the phase III study showed a high rate of fungal infections, both 
of the oesophagus as well as the oral cavity (including the pharynx), which may total to about 30% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/199925/2020 
Page 69/72 
  
  
the population treated obviously related to the high (local) exposure of the oral and oesophageal 
mucosa. These infections, however, did not lead to treatment discontinuation, were mostly 
asymptomatic, and were in their majority treated successfully with standard antifungal treatments.  
This result has been confirmed with the additional trial BUL-2/EER, both in the short-term open-label 
treatment phase, as well as in the long-term treatment phase. While the rate of fungal infections 
observed can be assumed to have been mostly diagnosed on symptoms, the overall rate did not 
relevantly increase over time, despite the relevantly longer treatment period. 
According to the currently available data on the long-term extension beyond 1 year, the safety profile 
appears to be similar during long-term extension also. 
Other adverse reactions concern “functional” effects such as nausea, dyspepsia, and reflux complaints, 
as well as headache. The influence on the HPA axis, and endogenous cortisol levels appear to be 
minor, however, some cases of “decreased cortisol” and of “hypertension” have been reported, which 
have to be assumed to be related to this. The SmPC takes due account of all reported adverse 
reactions. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The demonstrated benefits with the high superiority against the placebo comparator, the clinical 
relevance of the effects both with regard to the treatment effects on the underlying pathophysiology 
and the immediate symptomatic benefits to the patients are regarded to clearly outweigh the risks, 
which are – apart from the localised fungal infections and the functional upper GI complaints – not 
qualitatively different from what is known for other formulations of the active substance and can be 
addressed with routine risk minimisation measures. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit risk balance of Jorveza 0.5 mg/ 1 mg orodispersible tablet is positive in the 
maintenance of remission of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults. 
4.  Recommendations

any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or

reached.  
In addition, CHMP recommends the variations to the terms of the marketing authorisation, concerning 
the following changes:

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Neuromyelitis  optica  spectrum  disorder  (NMOSD)  is  a  rare,  severely  disabling,  complement-mediated 
autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by severe, 
immune-mediated demyelination and axonal damage predominantly targeting optic nerves and spinal 
cord 1 , 2 .NMOSD  is  typically  characterized  by  relapses  (also  known  as  attacks).  Disease  generally 
progresses  in  a  stepwise  fashion  due  to  neurologic disability  that  may  accumulate  with  each  relapse, 
with relative stability in between relapses3. 
Epidemiology 
The prevalence of NMOSD among Whites/Caucasians is ~1/100,000 population, with an annual incidence 
of 0.5-0.8/million population. Among East Asians, the prevalence is higher, at ~3.5/100,000 population, 
while the prevalence in Blacks may be up to 10/100,000 population. In AQP4-antibody-positive NMOSD, 
female preponderance is definite (up to 90%) and the majority of the cases are adults4. 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Complement activation is a major determinant of disease pathogenesis in patients with NMOSD who are 
AQP4 antibody positive5. AQP4 is a water channel that is predominantly expressed on the cell membrane 
of astrocytic end-feet, forming part of the blood–brain barrier. Binding of antibody downregulates AQP4 
and  causes  astrocytic  injury  through  activation  of  the  classical  complement  pathway.  Antibody-
complement complex formation results in chemotaxis of T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils 
and eosinophils, principally through activation of NFκB. Demyelination and oligodendrocyte injury occur 
as a secondary effect of this immune response6 . 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The condition is characterized by attacks of predominantly optic neuritis and/or longitudinally extensive 
transverse  myelitis.  Brainstem  signs  have  also  been  described,  which  predominant  manifestations 
described are vomiting and hiccups, occurring mainly at disease onset7. Attacks tend to be severe and 
recurrent, often with incomplete recovery and morbidity and mortality are substantial8.  
In 2015 the International Panel for NMO Diagnosis unified the concept of NMO and NMOSD and developed 
the revised diagnostic criteria, based on AQP4-IgG status. The core clinical characteristics required for

patients with NMOSD with AQP4-IgG include clinical syndromes or MRI findings related to optic nerve, 
spinal  cord,  area  postrema,  other  brainstem,  diencephalic,  or  cerebral  presentations.  More  stringent 
clinical criteria, with additional neuroimaging findings, are required for diagnosis of NMOSD when AQP4 
antibodies are absent or where serologic testing is unavailable9.  
Management 
Treatment of NMOSD is comprised of both acute treatment of relapses and long-term relapse prevention 
therapy.  Acute  treatment  of  NMOSD  relapses  consists  primarily  of  high-dose  corticosteroids  and 
plasmapheresis10. The goal of long-term treatment is to prevent the occurrence of relapses.  
Before approved therapies were available, preventative treatment for NMOSD included the use of off-
label  immunosuppressive  therapies  (ISTs)  based  on  clinical  experience  and  consensus.  Rituximab, 
mycophenolate  mofetil,  prednisolone  and  azathioprine  are  ISTs  that  have  been  used  off-label  for  the 
prevention of NMOSD relapses, with rituximab showing the strongest evidence to support relapse risk 
reduction11.  
Three  treatment  options  have  been  approved  through  the  centralized  procedure  since  2019  for  the 
treatment of NMOSD in adult patients who are anti-AQP4 antibody-positive. Eculizumab, inebilizumab, 
and satralizumab are all monoclonal antibodies that target different components of the immune system 
(C5, CD19, and interleukin-6 receptor [IL-6r], respectively) with the aim of preventing NMOSD relapses.  
2.1.2.  About the product 
Ravulizumab  (Ultomiris®;  ALXN1210)  is  a  humanized  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds  to  complement 
component  5  (C5)  and blocks  its  activation  by  complement  pathway  convertases,  thereby  preventing 
the release of the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin C5a and the formation of the terminal complement 
complex via C5b.Complement activation is a major determinant of disease pathogenesis in patients with 
NMOSD who are AQP4 antibody positive (Hinson, 2009; Nytrova, 2014; Papadopoulos, 2012).  
Ravulizumab  was  initially  approved  in  the  EU  on  02  Jul  2019  under  the  trade  name  Ultomiris  for  the 
treatment of Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in adult patients. Subsequently, the indication 
for ravulizumab was extended and it is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of PNH and atypical 
hemolytic  uremic  syndrome  (aHUS)  both  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients  and  for  the  treatment  of 
generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients.  
The proposed indication for ravulizumab is:  
The treatment of adult patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) who are 
anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody-positive. 
2.1.3.  The 
guidance/scientific advice 
development 
programme/compliance 
with 
CHMP 
The clinical development program for NMOSD in adult patients consists of an ongoing phase 3, external 
placebo-controlled,  open-label,  multicenter  clinical  study  (ALXN1210-NMO-307)  designed  to  evaluate 
the  efficacy,  safety,  pharmacokinetic  (PK),  and  pharmacodynamic  (PD),  and  immunogenicity  of 
ravulizumab in adult patients with NMOSD who areAQP4 antibody-positive. There is no CHMP Guideline

on the treatment of NMOSD currently available. The clinical program as well as the design and outcomes 
of  study  ALXN1210-NMO-307  were  discussed  during  a  scientific  advice 
in  October  2019 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/545125/2019)  and  during  a 
follow-up  procedure 
in  February  2020 
(EMEA/H/SA/3331/5/FU/1/2020/II). The MAH has overall followed the recommendations received.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
A  non-clinical  information  package  was  included  in  the  original  electronic  CTD  for  Ultomiris 
(ravulizumab),  presented  in  2018.  Direct  testing  of  ravulizumab  in  non-clinical  models  of  NMOSD  is 
precluded  by  ravulizumab  being  a  highly  specific  monoclonal  antibody  that  binds  only  to  human  C5; 
ravulizumab has not been shown to bind to C5 from any other mammalian species tested. 
Complement activation lead to the cleavage of C3 into C3b. C3b is also a critical structural subunit of C5 
convertase,  which  activates  terminal  complement  by  cleaving  C5  into  its  active  metabolites  C5a  and 
C5b.  C5b  recruits  the  terminal  complement  components  C6,  C7,  C8  and  C9  to  form  the  terminal 
complement complex (C5b-9) or membrane attack complex (MAC). 
NMOSD  is  an  ultra-rare,  severe,  disabling  autoimmune  inflammatory  disorder  of  the  CNS  that 
predominately  affects  the  optic  nerves  and  spinal  cord,  and  is  typically  characterized  by  a  relapsing 
course. Complement activation is a major determinant of disease pathogenesis in patients with AQP4 
antibody-positive NMOSD (Hinson, 2009; Papadopoulos, 2012; Verkman, 2012; Nytrova, 2014). Binding 
of anti-AQP4 autoantibodies to the AQP4 water channel, which is highly expressed on astrocytic surfaces 
in the CNS, has been shown to lead to hexameric assembly of immunoglobulin G. This in turn recruits 
and activates the complement cascade (Diebolder, 2014). 
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro models  
In  vitro  model  of  inflammation  that  consisted  of  human  astrocyte  line,  NMOSD  serum,  and  allogenic 
peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy individuals, the evidence of pathogenicity of NMOSD serum 
was shown, which by consecutive action of anti-AQP4 antibodies, complement system, and neutrophils 
affected astrocyte function (Piatek, 2018). Anti-AQP4 antibodies binding astrocytes initiated two parallel 
complementary  reactions.  The  first  one  was  dependent  on  the  complement  cytotoxicity  via  C5b-9 
complex formation, and the second one on the reverse of astrocyte glutamate pump into extracellular 
space by C5a-preactivated neutrophils. As a consequence, astrocytes were partially destroyed. 
Animal models 
In addition, animal experiment in mice showed that injection of anti-AQP4 antibodies directly into the 
brain,  either  intracerebrally  or  as  a  continuous  infusion  into  the  cerebrospinal  fluid,  does  not  cause 
disease  by  itself.  However,  in  the  presence  of  abundant  complement,  animals  develop  NMOSD-like 
pathology  (Wu,  2019).  Similarly,  addition  of  anti-AQP4  antibodies  to  cultured  astrocytes  causes  no 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 9/92 
 
  
 
 
cellular destruction unless exogenous complement is added (Alexopoulos, 2015). In mice, inactivation 
of CD59 glycoprotein, also known as MAC-inhibitory protein, or knockout of the gene that encodes this 
protein increased the extent of NMOSD pathology caused by co-injection of anti-AQP4 antibodies and 
complement (Yao, 2017). 
Moreover,  evidence  of  complement  involvement  in  anti-AQP4  antibody-positive  NMOSD  was 
characterized  in  postmortem  studies  of  anti-AQP4  antibody-positive  NMOSD  patients  which  showed; 
abundant complement deposition at sites of pathology, and markers of complement activation (C5a and 
soluble MAC) detected in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid during active disease (Wang, 2014), and 
astrocyte lysis stage in histopathological analyses (Takai, 2021). 
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According CHMP guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) with effective date of December 2006, states that vitamins, electrolytes, 
amino  acids,  peptides,  proteins,  carbohydrates  and  lipids  are  exempted  of  environmental  risk 
assessment because, due to their nature they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
Due to the fact that ravulizumab is a monoclonal antibody and thus a protein, no Environmental Risk 
Assessment is provided for this Type II variation. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
For  a  new  indication,  a  proof  of  concept  based  on  nonclinical  data  is  usually  required.  The  dose  and 
administration  route  proposed  for  this  new  indication  is  the  same  that  were  previously  approved  for 
aHUS and PNH indications; no new concerns are raised. Thus, no additional nonclinical toxicity studies 
are required.  
The existing nonclinical package of ravulizumab already supports the potency of ravulizumab to inhibit 
terminal complement activation. On that basis, complement cascade inhibition mediated by C5 protein 
block with ravulizumab provides the therapeutic rationale for NMOSD indication. For the proof of concept, 
no additional nonclinical data with ravulizumab have been generated for this new indication NMOSD. The 
nonclinical  overview  summarizes  results  from  several  published  studies  including  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
models that evaluated the role of complement to develop NMOSD-like pathology in mice in presence of 
anti-AQP4,  which  constituted  the  rationale  for  evaluating  ravulizumab  in  NMOSD.  Direct  testing  of 
ravulizumab  in  non-clinical  models  of  NMOSD  is  precluded  by  ravulizumab  being  a  highly  specific 
monoclonal antibody that binds only to human C5; ravulizumab has not been shown to bind to C5 from 
any other mammalian species tested. 
Eculizumab, a similar monoclonal antibody previously approved, is also indicated for the treatment of 
NMOSD in patients who are AQP4 antibody-positive. Despite ravulizumab was derived from eculizumab 
by introducing 4 unique amino acid substitutions to the CDR and Fc regions, these mutations are not 
expected to  impact  in  the  mechanism  of  action,  and  both  antibodies  recognize  and  bind  to  the  same 
epitope of the target (C5). Thus, the therapeutic rationale and proof of concept provided by the Applicant 
are considered adequate. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A  full  nonclinical  package  was  included  in  the  original  MAA  for  Ultomiris  presented  in  2018.  With  the 
exception of the published studies discussed above, no additional non-clinical data have been generated. 
This is considered acceptable.  
EMA/182657/2023

Considering the above data, ravulizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

Absorption 
Ravulizumab IV doses are 100% bioavailable resulting from IV administration. The time to maximum 
observed serum concentration is expected at the end of infusion or soon after end of infusion. Over the 
studied dose and regimen range, ravulizumab exhibited dose proportional and time linear PK. 
Distribution 
The mean (SD) volume of distribution at steady state in adult patients with NMOSD is 4.77 (0.819) L. 
Elimination 
As an immunoglobulin G (IgG) monoclonal antibody, ravulizumab is expected to be metabolized in the 
same  manner  as  any  endogenous  IgG  (degraded  into  small  peptides  and  amino  acids  via  catabolic 
pathways) and is subject to similar elimination. Ravulizumab contains only natural occurring amino acids 
and has no known active metabolites. The mean (SD) elimination half-life (t½) and linear clearance (CL) 
of  ravulizumab  in  adult  patients  with  NMOSD  is  64.3  (11.0)  days  and  0.00228  (0.000662)  L/h, 
respectively.

A  popPK  analysis  was  previously  performed  to  assess  concentration-time  profiles  of  ravulizumab 
following  IV  administration  in  healthy  volunteers  and  patients  with  PNH  (PopPK  and  PD  Analysis  to 
Support  Ravulizumab  Dosing  in  Patients  with  PNH,  1  June  2018).  A  2-compartment  model  with  CL 
adequately characterized the concentration-time profiles of ravulizumab. The popPK analysis included 
38  (12.7%)  healthy  subjects  and  261  (87.3%)  patients  with  PNH.  The  popPK  model  in  PNH  patients 
included  the  effect  of  body  weight  on  all  clearance  and  volume  parameters  (CL,  intercompartmental 
clearance [Q], volume of distribution in the central compartment [Vc], and volume of distribution in the 
peripheral compartment [Vp]). The popPK model also included the effect of body mass index (BMI) on 
volume of distribution parameters (Vc and Vp). Finally, the model included the effect of hemoglobin on 
central parameters (CL and Vc). 
In  addition,  a  popPK  analysis  was  previously  performed  to  assess  concentration-time  profiles  of 
ravulizumab  following  IV  administration  in  patients  with  gMG  (PopPK  and  PD  Analysis  to  Support 
Ravulizumab  Dosing  in  Patients  with  gMG,  6  October  2021).  A  2-compartment  model  with  first-order 
elimination  and  estimated  allometric  exponents  for  body  weight  on  CL/Q  and  Vc/Vp  resulted  in  an 
adequate  goodness-of-fit  based  on  peak/trough  concentrations  collected  in  patients  with  gMG.  PK 
parameters of peripheral compartments (Q and Vp) were fixed to those originally observed in patients 
with PNH. 
Rescue  therapy  (e.g,  high-dose  corticosteroid,  PP/PE,  or  IVIg)  was  allowed  for  patient  with  gMG  who 
experienced Clinical Deterioration. The effect of PP/PE or IVIg on CL  were investigated as part of the 
base model development. Based on 2 patients with at least one PP/PE intervention and corresponding 
PK  data,  the  CL  of  ravulizumab  during  a  PP/PE  intervention  was  estimated  to  be  0.793  L/h,  which 
translated  into  a  t1/2  of  3.6  days.  Based  on  5  patients  with  at  least  one  IVIg  intervention  and 
corresponding  PK  data,  the  CL  of  ravulizumab  during  an  IVIg  intervention  was  0.0108  L/h,  which 
translated into a t1/2 of 14.7 days. 
For patients with NMOSD enrolled in study ALXN1210-NMO-307, PP/PE or IVIg interventions may have 
been  administered  along  with  supplemental  doses  of  ravulizumab  Overall,  the  above  2-compartment 
model with PP/PE or IVIg was used as a starting point. All covariates were re-evaluated as part of the 
final analysis. 
Base PopPK Model 
The starting point for model development was a 2-compartment model with first-order elimination, as 
well as estimated allometric exponents for body weight on CL/Q and Vc/Vp. The effect of PP/PE or IVIg 
on the CL of ravulizumab was investigated as part of the base model development. A single patient had 
5 PP/PE interventions with corresponding PK data and a single patient had one IVIg intervention with 
corresponding PK data.

body weight on Q equal to effect on CL; effect of body weight on Vp equal to effect on Vc; effect of BMI on Vp equal to effect on Vc. 
Covariate analysis 
Graphical  exploration  of  the  relationship  between  baseline  covariates  and  individual  random  effects 
(ETAs) on CL and Vc was performed to explore sources of variability. 
A formal covariate analysis was performed using a stepwise forward addition (p-value = 0.01) followed 
by backward elimination (p-value = 0.001). The following covariates were formally tested on CL and Vc: 
BMI,  age,  sex,  race,  markers  of  renal  function  (estimated  glomerular  filtration  rate  and  creatinine 
clearance),  markers  of  liver  function  (alanine  aminotransferase,  aspartate  aminotransferase  alkaline 
phosphatase, and bilirubin), haematocrit, hemoglobin, albumin, and ADA (baseline and time-varying), 
concomitant  medications  (anabolic  agents  for  systemic  use,  antithrombotic  agents,  antianemia 
preparations,  antihypertensives,  antibacterial  for  systemic  use,  antimycotics  for  systemic  use, 
corticosteroids for systemic use, immunosuppressants). 
A summary of covariates included in the model as part of the forward inclusion step is presented in Table 
8

CL = clearance; MOF = minimum objective function, AMOF = maximum change in objective function, confidence interval, level of 
significance for 1 degree of freedom = 6.63 (p<0.01), Vc = volume of distribution of the central compartment.  
The effect of alanine aminotransferase on Vc was removed as part of the backward elimination due to 
not meeting the p-value threshold of 0.001. 
Final PopPK Model 
PopPK parameter of ravulizumab as well as between-subjects and residual error parameters derived with 
the final model are presented in Table 9.

Note: The reference patient was a 70-kg male patient with NMOSD with a BMI of 25.1 kg/m2. Peripheral compartment parameters 
(ie, Q and Vp) were fixed to population estimates originally identified in patients with PNH and no random effects were estimated for 
these parameters.  
a Parameter estimates are back-transformed from the log-transformed domain.

Population estimates of CL and Vc of ravulizumab were 0.00226 L/h and 3.01 L in a typical 70-kg patient 
with a BMI of 25.1 kg/m2, respectively. The CL and Vc were robustly estimated with robust standard 
error (RSE) values less than 5%. The between-subject variability of CL and Vc were 17.9% and 12.9%, 
respectively. The mean t1/2 was 64.3 days.  
The goodness-of-fit derived with the final popPK model is presented in Figure 3.

A bootstrap resampling analysis was performed. PopPK parameters and covariate effects derived with 
bootstrap analysis were within 1% of those derived in the original analysis.

Covariate effects 
• 
The CL of ravulizumab was dependent on body weight. The exponent for the effect of weight on 
CL was 0.772 [(Body Weight/70)0.772] suggesting higher CL values in patients with higher body 
weight. For example, typical patients with body weight values of 41.0 and 125.0 kg are expected 
to have CL values 34% slower and 57% faster (0.00150 and 0.00354 L/h, respectively) relative 
to a typical patient with a body weight of 70 kg. 
•  A  single  patient  presented  with  a  single  IVIg  intervention.  Due  to  the  limited  data  available, 
adding IVIg intervention as a covariate did not show a statistically significant improvement in 
the objective function. IVIg intervention was not included as a covariate. 
• 
• 
• 
The CL of ravulizumab during PP/PE interventions was 3.24 L/h. The effect of PP/PE intervention 
on the CL of ravulizumab was robustly estimated (RSE <5%) despite the fact that a single patient 
received PP/PE interventions. Based on post hoc estimates, the faster CL of ravulizumab during 
the PP/PE interventions (CL = 0.00186 L/h× 1437) corresponded to a t1/2 of 3.4 days. The t1/2 of 
ravulizumab without PP/PE in this patient was 61.7 days. 
The Q of ravulizumab was dependent on body weight. Similar to CL, the exponent for the effect 
of weight on Q was 0.772 [(Body Weight/70)0.772]. The effect of weight on Q had therefore the 
same magnitude of effect as that presented for CL. 
The Vc of ravulizumab was dependent on body weight. The exponent for the effect of weight on 
Vc  was  1.01  [(Body  Weight/70)1.01]  suggesting  higher  Vc  values  in  patients with  higher  body 
weight.  For  example,  typical  patients  with  body  weight  values  of  41.0  and  125.0  kg 
(corresponding to minimum and maximum values in the PK population) are expected to have Vc 
EMA/182657/2023

values 42% smaller and 80% greater (1.75 and 5.40 L, respectively) relative to a typical patient 
with a body weight of 70 kg. 
The Vc of ravulizumab was also dependent on BMI. The exponent for the effect of BMI on Vc was 
-0.548 [(BMI/25.1)-0.548] suggesting lower Vc values in patients with higher BMI. For example, 
typical  patients  with  BMI  values  of  17.7  and  45.8  kg/m2  (corresponding  to  minimum  and 
maximum values in the PK population) are expected to have Vc values 21% greater and 28% 
smaller (3.64 and 2.16 L), respectively, relative to a typical patient with a BMI of 25.1 kg/m2. 
The Vp of ravulizumab was dependent on body weight and BMI. The effect of weight on Vp had 
the same magnitude as that presented for Vc.

is presented in Figure 5.

Comparison across indications- Patients with NMOSD vs Patients with gMG 
Exposure parameters of ravulizumab in patients with NMOSD were compared to patients with gMG, a 
disease characterized by uncontrolled terminal complement activation at the neural or muscle surface. 
The  comparison  was  conducted using  patient  data  from  the  following  two  trials:  NMOSD  (ALXN1210-
NMO-307) and gMG (ALXN1210-MG-306). 
Descriptive  statistics  of  exposure  parameters  of  ravulizumab  by  body  weight  group  in  patients  with 
NMOSD and gMG are presented in Table 10.

state conditions; Ctrough,ss = concentration at the end of the dosage interval under steady-state conditions; gMG = generalized

Ravulizumab dosing in patients with body weight ≥ 40 to <60kg (2400mg LD/3000mg MD q8w), ≥60 to < 100kg (2700mg 
LD/3300mg MD q8w) and ≥ 100kg (3000 mg LD / 3600mg MD q8w).  
Ctrough,ss were similar across indications with the exception of the ≥60 to <100 kg group, whereby the 
median Ctrough,ss in patients with NMOSD was 33% higher than patients with gMG. This is likely due to 
the different body weight distributions <100 kg group. 
Consequently,  additional  comparisons  were  performed  by  stratifying  across  different  body  weight 
groups. Ratios of least-squares mean along with 95% confidence interval (CI) were derived for exposure 
parameters in patients with NMOSD relative to patients with gMG within each body weight group. 
The ratio of least-squares mean with 95% CI of Ctrough,ss in patients with NMOSD (Test) vs. patients with

Impact of PP/PE or IVIG  and Supplemental Doses 
As defined in study protocol of ALXN1210-NMO-307, use of PP/PE was allowed as acute therapy. 
For patients who received PE/PP, supplemental doses of ravulizumab were to be administered within 4 
hours after the PE/PP session completed according to the patient’s body weight as described below: 
• For a PE/PP intervention during the loading dose phase, patients with body weight ≥ 40 to < 60, ≥ 60 
to < 100, or ≥ 100 kg were prescribed supplemental doses of 1200, 1500, or 1500 mg, respectively. 
• For a PE/PP intervention during the maintenance dose phase, patients with body weight ≥ 40 to < 60, 
≥ 60 to < 100, or ≥ 100 kg were prescribed supplemental doses of 1500, 1800, or 1800 mg, respectively. 
For patients who received IVIg, for all body weight groups, supplemental ravulizumab doses of 600 mg 
were to be administered within 4 hours after the last session(s) of the IVIg course was completed. 
A single patient required 5 PP/PE interventions (of 0.75, 1.03, 1.58, 1.90 and 2.28 hours duration each). 
The supplemental doses during the maintenance phase (body weight) were 1500mg (59.4kg) except for 
the last intervention (2.28 hours) that was followed by a supplemental dose of 3000mg (59.9kg).

therapy following an On-trial Relapse. Only one patient required a single IVIg intervention with 4.4 hours 
of duration of PK impact (derived as the time from that start of IVIg dosing to next PK sample). The 
patient received a supplemental dose (maintenance) of 600mg.

exception  of  single  patient  who  presented  an  ADA  positive  sample  at  Week  26.  This  patient    also 
presented a positive ADA sample at baseline. All pre- and post-dose positive samples in patients who 
received ravulizumab were tested to be negative for neutralising antibodies. 
Similar concentration-time profiles of ravulizumab were observed in patients with positive and negative 
ADA status at baseline

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ravulizumab is a terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds to C5 with high affinity. This action 
inhibits 
the  enzymatic  cleavage  of  C5  and 
thereby  prevents 
the  generation  of 
the 
proinflammatory/prothrombotic complement activation product, C5a, and the MAC, formed by C5b-9, 
which are responsible for the Ab-mediated destruction of astrocytes associated with anti-AQP4 antibody-
positive NMOSD. By binding specifically to C5, ravulizumab antagonizes terminal complement-mediated 
inflammation, cell activation, and cell lysis. This mechanism of action provides a therapeutic rationale 
for the use of ravulizumab in NMOSD. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling

Figure 11: Longitudinal Profiles of Free C5 in the Primary Treatment Period Study ALXN1210-NMO-307 
Note 1: On Day 1_Pre-dose, two outlier samples were observed: one patient presented a free C5 concentration of 0.0264 µg/mL and 
a  ravulizumab  BLQ  concentration,  and  another  patient  presented  a  free  C5  concentration  of  0.0335  µg/mL  and  a  ravulizumab 
concentration of 1200 µg/mL  
Note 2: On Day1_EOI, an outlier sample was observed: one patient presented a free C5 concentration of 44.1 µg/mL and a ravulizumab 
concentration at EOI of 972 µg/mL. There is a possibility of a sample switch/mislabel between the “on day 1_predose” and “on day 
1_EOI”sample in this subject. 
A total of 58 patients with at least one measurable concentration of ravulizumab and a corresponding 
measurable concentration of free C5 was included in the PK/PD analysis. Based on a total of 851 samples, 
819 (96.2%) were included in the exploratory PK/PD analysis.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Ravulizumab as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with NMOSD who are AQP4 antibody-
positive  is  being  evaluated  in  the  pivotal  phase  3  study  ALXN1210-NMO-307  (ongoing).  The  clinical 
pharmacology update includes data from the ALXN1210-NMO-307 study (primary treatment period, up 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 36/92 
 
  
 
 
 
 
to  week  50),  which  includes  PK,  PD  and  immunogenicity  observations  in  58  patients  receiving 
ravulizumab. 
The final dataset for the current popPK model development included 792 observation records from 58 
patients  with  NMOSD  treated  with  ravulizumab  in  the  primary  treatment  period  of  the  pivotal  study 
ALXN1210-NMO-307. 
A popPK analysis was previously performed in healthy volunteers and patients with PNH. Ravulizumab 
PK was described using a 2-compartment model with linear clearance and included the effect of body 
weight on clearance and volume parameters. Subsequently, a population PK analysis was developed in 
patients  with  gMG.  A  2-compartment  model  with  first-order  elimination  and  estimated  allometric 
exponents for body weight on clearance and volume parameters resulted in an adequate description of 
the data. In this case, PK parameters of the peripheral compartment (Q and Vp) were fixed to the value 
obtained in patients with PNH and healthy subjects, which could be adequate based on the experimental 
evidence collected. The estimated allometric exponents for body weight on CL/Q and central/peripheral 
compartment volume (Vc/Vp) (0,772 and 1.01 respectively), which are close to the standard allometric 
exponents for clearance (0.75) and apparent volume of distribution (1). Rescue therapy was allowed for 
patient with gMG in the pivotal study and therefore the effect of PP/PE or IVIg on CL were investigated 
as part of the base model development. Finally, the effect of PP/PE and IVIg therapy were incorporated 
on CL. Overall, the modelling strategy and evaluation is endorsed.  
Residuals were described by proportional error model. IIV was included on CL, Vc and the percentage of 
coefficient  of  variation  was  moderate  (17.9%  and  12.9%,  respectively).  Structural  model  parameters 
were estimated with good precision (RSE values of 2.45% and 2.09% for CL and Vc respectively). The 
RSE of PK parameters were below 15%, except for the effect of BMI on volume parameters (RSE=31.9%) 
showing the adequacy of the final parameter estimates.  
The covariate analysis revealed a clinically relevant effect of body weight on Ctrough,ss and Cmax,ss, showing 
that differences >20% are expected in patients with body weight <41 and >125 kg compared to the 
reference patient (70 kg).  
Model performance evaluation of the final popPK through the pcVPC suggests the adequacy of the current 
model to describe the overall data of the ALXN1210-NMO-307 study.  
The exposure comparison across the different indications (NMOSD and gMG) suggested similar exposure 
levels  for  each  sub-group  of  body  weight  patients  evaluated  (40-60,  60-100,  ≥100  kg).  In  general, 
slightly higher exposure levels were predicted in NMOSD patients compared to gMG patients. The overall 
trend suggests lower exposure for high body weight patients (≥100 kg) for both indications compared 
to  patients  with  lower  body  weight,  despite  the  different  dosing  regimens  based  on  body  weight. 
However, based on the PK/PD threshold (175 μg/mL) and the range of exposure levels in patients with 
body weight ≥100 kg, no efficacy concern is expected with the proposed dosing regimen.  
In Japanese patients ≥60 to 100 kg, the median Ctrough,ss, Cmax,ss, and Cavg,ss of ravulizumab were 29%, 
24%, and 25% higher than those observed in non-Japanese patients, respectively. However, it seems 
premature to establish any conclusion since only 2 Japanese patients were enrolled in this body weight 
group. Based on these results, additional experimental evidence is required in order to support the dosing 
regimen in Japanese patients.  
Immunogenicity  was  assessed  in  Study  ALXN1210-NMO-307.  The  impact  of  immunogenicity  after 
ravulizumab treatment showed no relevant concerns. 
The PK/PD relationship was empirically established through the graphical representation of experimental 
PK (serum ravulizumab concentration) and PD (free C5 concentration) observations and no model-based 
approach has been conducted. Based on experimental evidence, concentrations of ravulizumab greater 
EMA/182657/2023

than 175 μg/mL were associated with free C5 concentrations below 0.5 μg/mL. The exploratory PK/PD 
analysis showed that 57 patients presented all ravulizumab concentrations above the threshold and also 
presented values of free C5 below 0.5 μg/mL. Only 1 patient had concentrations of ravulizumab post 
dose below the threshold.  
The exposure-safety evaluation revealed no clinically relevant relationship of ravulizumab quartiles and 
the incidence/probability of adverse events (AE). 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties of ravulizumab as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients 
with NMOSD who are AQP4 antibody-positive has been adequately characterized. A previously developed 
popPK model has been updated based on the clinical evidence collected in ALXN1210-NMO-307 study. 
The results suggest similar exposure across the different sub-groups of body weight patients and the 
adequacy of the proposed dosing regimen based on the PD target levels (free C5).  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The ravulizumab clinical development program in NMOSD includes 2 clinical studies: 
•  An  ongoing  phase  3  randomized,  external  placebo-controlled,  open-label,  multicenter  study  (Study 
ALXN1210-NMO-307; submitted) 
• A phase 2/3, open-label, historical-controlled, multicenter extension study of children and adolescents 
(Study ALXN1210-NMO-317; initiated on 23 Jun 2022) 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No  specific  dose  response  study  has  been  submitted  for  this  extension  of  the  indication.  The 
recommended  body  weight-based  ravulizumab  treatment  regimen  for  adult  patients  with  NMOSD  is 
identical to the approved dosing for adult patients in other indications. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Title  of  Study:  A  Phase  3,  External  Placebo-Controlled,  Open-Label,  Multicenter 
Study  to  Evaluate  the  Efficacy  and  Safety  of  Ravulizumab  in  Adult  Patients  with 
Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) 
Methods 
Study ALXN1210-NMO-307 is an ongoing Phase 3, external placebo-controlled, open-label, multicenter 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ravulizumab in adult patients with NMOSD. 
There  are  4  periods  in  this  study:  Screening  Period,  Primary  Treatment  Period,  Long-Term  Extension 
Period, and Safety Follow-up Period.

1All eligible patients received open-label ravulizumab during the Primary Treatment Period. The end of the Primary Treatment Period 
was triggered when all patients had completed, or discontinued prior to, 50 weeks on study. 
Patients who completed 50 weeks on study prior to this point remained in the Primary Treatment Period until it was completed for all 
patients. 
2 The Primary Treatment Period  ended and the Long-Term Extension Period started when all  patients  completed their EOPT Visit. 
Patients continue to receive ravulizumab during the Long-Term Extension Period for up to approximately 2 years, or until ravulizumab 
is approved for the studied indication and/or available (in accordance with country-specific regulations), whichever occurs first. 
3The primary analysis for regulatory submission was conducted at the end of the Primary Treatment Period, and included all available 
efficacy, safety, and PK/PD/ADA data collected from the Primary Treatment Period.

Treatments 
Patients received open-label ravulizumab, supplied as a 10 mg/mL solution during the Primary Treatment 
Period.  All  doses,  including  the  loading  dose  on  Day  1  and  maintenance  doses  on  Day  15  and  q8w 
thereafter, were administered by IV infusion. Dosages were based on the patient’s body weight: 
Table 17: Loading and maintenance dose based on body weight (kg) 
a Dose regimen was based on the last recorded study visit body weight. This was commonly the current visit as weight was measured 
prior to dose preparation on the day of the visit. If the study drug was prepared the night before a visit, the weight from the most 
recent prior study visit was used. 
During the Long-Term Extension Period, patients were changed from the 10 mg/mL formulation to the 
100 mg/mL formulation of ravulizumab with no change to the weight-based dose regimen. 
As per the study design, the end of the Primary Treatment Period was to be triggered when 2 patients 
had an adjudicated On-trial Relapse and all patients had completed, or discontinued prior to, 26 weeks 
on  study.  If  2  patients  had  not  had  an  adjudicated  On-trial  Relapse  by  the  time  all  patients  had 
completed, or discontinued prior to, 50 weeks on study, the end of the Primary Treatment Period was to 
be triggered at that time. 
Patients  who  entered  the  study  receiving  supportive  IST  (including  corticosteroids,  azathioprine, 
mycophenolate  mofetil,  methotrexate,  tacrolimus,  cyclosporine,  or  cyclophosphamide)  for  the 
prevention of relapse, either in combination or monotherapy, must have been on a stable dosing regimen 
of adequate duration prior to Screening with no plan to change the dose during the initial study period 
(starting from the Screening Visit). Changes were allowed per protocol after 106 weeks in the study. 
Supplemental  Doses:  During  the  study,  PE/  PP  or  IVIg  was  allowed  at  the  discretion  of  the  treating 
physician  for  treatment  of  an  On-trial  Relapse.  If  PE/PP  was  administered  for  On-trial  Relapse,  a 
supplemental  dose  of  ravulizumab  was  administered  within  4  hours  after  each  session  of  PE/PP  was 
completed,  and  was  based  on  the  most  recently  administered  ravulizumab  dose.  If  PE/PP  was 
administered  on  a  day  of  scheduled  dosing  visit,  patients  received  the  regularly-scheduled  dose  of 
ravulizumab  within  1  to  2  hours  after  the  PE/PP  session.  If  IVIg  was  administered,  a  ravulizumab 
supplemental dose was administered after the last dose of IVIg in the series.

Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were tested in a hierarchical approach (numbers included for rank order of analyses). 
a On-trial Relapses refer to relapses as determined by the Treating Physician that occurred during the study treatment period. All On-
trial Relapses were adjudicated by a separate Adjudication Committee. The term “Adjudicated On-trial Relapse” is used to reflect only 
those events that were adjudicated positively by the RAC. 
ADA = antidrug antibody; AQP4 Ab = aquaporin-4 antibody; ARR = annualized relapse rate; C5 = complement component 5; CSF = 
cerebrospinal fluid; EDSS = Expanded Disability Status Scale; EQ-5D = European Quality of Life Health 5-dimension Questionnaire; 
HAI = Hauser ambulation index; Ig = immunoglobulin; NMOSD = neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder; PD = pharmacodynamics; 
PK = pharmacokinetics; QoL = quality of life; RAC = Relapse Adjudication Committee; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event; 
TESAE = treatment-emergent serious adverse event; VAS = Visual Analogue Scale. 
On-trial Relapse is defined as a new onset of neurologic symptoms or worsening of existing neurologic 
symptoms with an objective change (clinical sign) on neurologic examination that persists for more than 
24 hours as confirmed by the Treating Physician. 
Adjudicated On-trial Relapse reflected only those events that were adjudicated positively by the RAC. 
The RAC consisted of physicians with particular expertise in NMOSD and conducted independent reviews 
of all On-trial Relapses. They evaluated each On-trial Relapse as reported by the Treating Physician and 
confirmed whether it met the protocol defined criteria for an NMOSD relapse.  
A Case of Interest was an event judged by the Treating Physician to not be an On-trial Relapse (ie, it is 
not an Investigator confirmed On-trial Relapse), but which met criteria to be submitted to the RAC for 
adjudication. 
Sample size 
The sample size and power calculation assumptions using the primary endpoint were as follows: 
− 
Log-rank test for comparison of ravulizumab to placebo 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 41/92 
 
  
 
 
 
 
−  47 patients in the placebo treatment group 
−  Power 90% 
−  Two-sided 5% level of significance 
−  Drop-out rate 2-10% 
−  Relapse-free rate of 92% for the ravulizumab arm at 12 months 
−  Relapse-free rate of 63% for the placebo arm at 12 months 
With  these  assumptions,  a  maximum  sample  size  of  approximately  55  patients  in  the  ravulizumab 
treatment group provides at least 90% power to detect a treatment difference in time to first positively 
adjudicated relapse. 
Randomisation 
This study employs a single-arm treatment design. 
Blinding (masking) 
This  is  a  single-arm,  open-label  study.  All  study  patients,  site  personnel,  Sponsor  staff,  Sponsor 
designees,  and  all  staff  directly  associated  with  the  conduct  of  the  study  were  unblinded  to  patient 
treatment assignments 
To minimize potential for bias in this open-label study, operational measures were employed regarding 
the efficacy endpoints and adjudication process.  
The  study  database  was  monitored  according  to  prespecified  guidelines  in  order  to  confirm  that  all 
potential relapses were collected and analyzed. An independent RAC evaluated each On-trial Relapse as 
reported  by  the  Treating  Physician  and  confirmed  whether  it  met  the  protocol  defined  criteria  for  an 
NMOSD relapse. An "adjudicated On-trial Relapse" is a relapse that was confirmed following evaluation 
by the RAC. Additionally, while the EDSS Raters were aware that all patients are on ravulizumab, the 
EDSS Raters were blinded to all study data when making their assessments. 
As already stated, the external control is the placebo arm of Study ECU-NMO-301. In order to ensure a 
valid comparison, constancy with Study ECU-NMO-301 was tried to be maintained in Study ALXN1210-
NMO-307, including with regards to the inclusion of similar patient populations, permitted concomitant 
medications,  adjudication  procedures,  and  endpoints.  To  address  any  biases  arising  from  slight 
differences in study designs and unforeseen enrolment differences, sensitivity analyses using propensity 
scores and tipping point analyses (E-value) (VanderWeele, 2017) were performed.

The SAP Version 3.0 was finalized on 09 Jul 2021 before the CSR database lock date (25 Apr 2022). 
The primary analysis of efficacy was to be performed on the FAS. The primary efficacy analysis of time 
to  first  adjudicated  On-Trial  Relapse  and  some  sensitivity  analyses  were  to  be  also  performed on the 
PPS. Baseline was defined as the last available assessment prior to treatment for all patients regardless 
of treatment group. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint was time to first adjudicated On-Trial Relapse. The time to first adjudicated 
On-Trial Relapse was to be evaluated using the log-rank test; the null hypothesis was that there is no 
difference in the survival curves of the ravulizumab and the placebo treatment groups. The alternative 
hypothesis was that there is a difference between the two survival curves, and ravulizumab is superior 
to placebo. 
The study was considered to have met its primary efficacy objective if a statistically significant difference 
(i.e., 2-sided p-value 0.05) was observed between the ravulizumab treatment group and the placebo 
group for the primary endpoint of the time to first adjudicated On-Trial Relapse. The comparison of the 
treatment groups for the primary endpoint was to use a log-rank test. Hazard ratio and risk reduction 
were to be summarized from a Cox proportional hazards model including treatment group as a factor. 
In absence of observed event in a treatment arm, Firth’s Penalized Likelihood (Heinze, 2001) was to be 
used to estimate the hazard ratio, risk reduction, and the profile likelihood 95% CIs. The Kaplan-Meier 
estimates of proportion of patients with no adjudicated On-Trial Relapse were to be presented for various 
time points (e.g, Week 24, Week 48) with a 95% CI based on the complementary log-log transformation. 
A  figure  showing  the  Kaplan-Meier  curves  of  the  time  to  first  adjudicated  On-Trial  Relapse  for  each 
treatment group was to be produced. 
Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Endpoint 
The following sensitivity analyses will be performed (among others): 
•  A sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis described above for the FAS was to be performed 
using the PPS. 
•  A sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis described above for the FAS was to be performed 
in which patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had not relapsed prior to COVID-19 
infection were censored on the start date of the first COVID-19 related AE. 
•  A sensitivity analysis for the comparison of the treatment groups for the primary endpoint was 
to be performed as described above but stratified using propensity score strata. The propensity 
score is the probability of being assigned to the placebo arm vs. the ravulizumab arm and was 
to  be  estimated  from  a  logistic  regression  that  includes  observed  baseline  characteristics  as 
predictors of the treatment assignment. In lieu of having a randomized study, the propensity 
score  serves  to  balance  treatment  groups  on  the  baseline  characteristics.  (Austin,  2011).  A 
propensity score was to be estimated for each patient and categorized into two strata, such that 
each patient is identified as having low (≤median) or high (> median) probability of being in the 
placebo treatment group. The analysis was to be performed using a log-rank test, stratified on 
propensity  score  strata.  Hazard  ratio  and  risk  reduction  was  to  be  summarized  from  a  Cox 
proportional  hazards  model,  also  stratified  using  propensity  score  strata.  This  was  to  be 
performed for the FAS and the PPS. 
•  A sensitivity analysis of the comparison of the treatment groups for the primary endpoint was to 
be  performed  as  described  above,  but  weighted  using  the  stabilized  inverse  probability  of 
treatment weights (sIPTW), which are calculated using the propensity score. The analysis was

to be performed using a weighted log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves were to be presented 
using weighted Kaplan-Meier estimates (Xie, 2005); the hazard ratio and risk reduction were to 
be summarized from a weighted Cox proportional hazards model. Estimates of the hazard ratios 
from the weighted Cox proportional hazards model represent the average treatment effect. This 
was to be performed using the FAS, and the PPS. 
•  A tipping point analysis using the E-value approach proposed by Vanderweele, 2017 was to be 
conducted. The E-value, constructed as a risk ratio, quantifies the level of confounding which 
could  compensate  the  estimated  treatment  effect;  the  smallest  E-value  of  1  represents  no 
confounding. The E-value was to be calculated using the hazard ratio from the Cox proportional 
hazards  model  using  both  the  unstratified  model  described  for  the  primary  analysis  and  the 
model  stratified  using  propensity  score  strata.  This  value  was  to  be  calculated  for  both  the 
estimate and the upper 95% confidence limit using the FAS, and the PPS. 
Propensity Scores for Baseline Covariates 
Propensity  scores  were  utilized  to  account  for  any  differences  in  baseline  characteristics  between  the 
Study ALXN1210-NMO-307 ravulizumab group and the Study ECU-NMO-301 placebo treatment group. 
The variables in the propensity score calculation included region, gender, age at first dose, background 
IST use, baseline EDSS, and historical ARR within the 24 months prior to Screening. Sensitivity analyses 
for the efficacy endpoints stratifying by propensity score strata were performed to balance these baseline 
covariates between treatment groups and further reduce potential bias introduced through an external 
control. 
The median propensity scores were 0.675 for the ravulizumab group and 0.425 for the placebo group. 
Following  stratification  on  median  propensity  score,  70.7%  of  patients  in  the  ravulizumab  group  and 
23.4%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  had  a  propensity  score  that  was  above  the  median.  This  is 
considered by the Applicant as indicating that selected baseline characteristics included in the propensity 
score calculation had a higher probability of occurring in the ravulizumab group than the placebo group. 
The  analysis  of  baseline  characteristics  by  strata  is  provided  in  Table  19.  According  to  the  Applicant, 
while some differences between treatment groups in baseline characteristics were still observed across 
the propensity score strata, the majority of covariates included in the propensity score calculation had a 
standardized  mean  difference  (SMD)  <  ±  0.25,  indicating  that  these  covariates  were  balanced  within 
strata (Stuart, 2010).

As  another  approach  to  balance  the  baseline  covariates  between  treatment  groups  and  more  closely 
match  the  patients  between  treatment  groups,  standardized  inverse  probability  treatment  weights, 
derived from propensity scores, were applied in the summary of baseline characteristics. Following this 
method of weighting, the SMD for all covariates included in the propensity score calculation was < ± 
0.25. The Applicant considers this indicates that the objective of balancing the baseline characteristics 
between  treatment  groups  was  achieved  (Stuart,  2010)  (Table  20).  This  method  of  weighting  also 
balanced on covariates not included in the propensity score calculation, including HAI score and EQ-5D

Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 78 screened patients, 20 (25.6%) were screen failures. The most common (≥ 5%) reason for 
screen failure was not meeting the inclusion criteria of being anti-AQP4 antibody-positive at screening 
and having a diagnosis of NMOSD (n = 9; 11.5%). 
A  total  of  58  patients  were  treated  with  ravulizumab  in  Study  ALXN1210-NMO-307.  As  of  the  clinical 
data cut-off date, 56 of the 58 patients completed the Primary Treatment Period and are ongoing in the 
Long-Term  Extension  Period.  Two  (3.4%)  patients  were  reported  as  discontinued  from  the  Primary 
Treatment Period due to adverse events. Fifty-seven (98.3%) patients were reported as continuing the 
study; 1 patient who discontinued from the Primary Treatment Period due to an AE had not yet completed 
the Safety Follow Up visit at the time of the clinical cut-off date and was listed as ongoing in the database. 
However, this patient subsequently discontinued the study after the data cut-off. 
As of the data cutoff date, no patients discontinued from Study ALXN1210-NMO-307 due to COVID-19. 
Approximately one third of patients overall were enrolled from each of the following regions, as specified 
per protocol: America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.

Percentages were based on the number of patients in the treatment group.

Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 36 sites that enrolled 58 patients across 11 countries (Australia, Canada, 
Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States). 
Date first patient enrolled: 13 Dec 2019

Conduct of the study 
Because  no  patients  had  an  adjudicated  On-trial  Relapse  during  the  study,  the  end  of  the  Primary 
Treatment Period was triggered when all patients completed, or discontinued prior to, 50 weeks on study. 
Patients who completed 50 weeks on study prior to this point remained in the Primary Treatment Period 
until it was completed for all patients. Therefore, the overall treatment duration for an individual patient 
varied and was dependent upon when they enrolled in the study. Based on the estimated enrollment 
rate, the duration of the Primary Treatment Period for each patient was initially expected to be between 
26 weeks (or 50 weeks if < 2 patients had an adjudicated On-trial Relapse) (plus 2 weeks for the EOPT 
visit window) and approximately 2.5 years. 
Per  protocol,  all  patients  who  entered  the  Long-Term  Extension  Period  will  continue  to  receive 
ravulizumab for up to approximately 2 years, or until ravulizumab is approved for the studied indication 
and/or available (in accordance with country-specific regulations), whichever occurs first. Based on the 
estimated enrolment rate of NMOSD patients, the total treatment duration for each patient is anticipated 
to be up to approximately 4.5 years. After the last dose of study drug or ED, patients will be followed 
for 8 weeks. The total study duration for each patient will be up to approximately 4.75 years. 
The study duration for an individual patient as of the cut-off date ranged between 13.7 and 117.7 weeks. 
All results presented in this report are based on the clinical database cut-off date of 15 Mar 2022, with 
the exception of clinical laboratory, PK, PD, and ADA data which are based on a cut-off date of 15 Feb 
2022. All analyses presented in this report are based on a database lock date of 25 Apr 2022. 
Changes in Planned Analyses Prior to Database Lock 
Changes made after the final SAP and before database lock (25 Apr 2022) are described here. 
• A summary and analysis of On-trial Relapses were added. 
• To address the possibility that no adjudicated On-trial Relapses would be observed, an analysis was 
added to arrive at a p-value and the upper limit of the 95% CI.  
• CSF samples were not available at the time of submission and this analysis has not yet been performed 
as part of the Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses. 
Changes Following Database Lock and Post-hoc Analyses 
Histograms showing the distribution of the change from baseline to End of Study Period inEQ-5D index

Baseline data 
Demographic Characteristics 
The majority of patients in both the ravulizumab and placebo groups, respectively, were female (89.7% 
and 89.4%), not Hispanic or Latino (77.6% and 87.2%), and were White (50.0% and 51.1%) or Asian 
(36.2% and 31.9%).

NMOSD History 
The  mean  (SD)  historical  ARR  within  the  24  months  prior  to  Screening  was  1.87  (1.594)  in  the 
ravulizumab group and 2.07 (1.037) in the placebo group. Differences in NMOSD history between the 
ravulizumab  and  placebo  groups  were  not  expected  to  meaningfully  affect  the  results  of  the  primary 
analysis.

In  both  the  ravulizumab  and  placebo  groups,  the  most  common  clinical  presentations  for  historical 
relapses within 24 months prior to screening were optic neuritis (43.1% and 46.8%, respectively) and 
transverse myelitis (58.6% and 89.4%, respectively)

Most  patients  in  both  the  ravulizumab  (n  =  50;  86.2%)  and  placebo  (n  =  45;  95.7%)  groups  used 
supportive therapy for NMOSD prior to study treatment. The most common therapies used for NMOSD 
prior to study treatment were corticosteroids, rituximab, and azathioprine. 
A  greater  percentage  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group  were  on  ISTs  at  baseline  compared  with  the 
ravulizumab group (72.3% and 48.3%, respectively). Two (3.4%) patients in the ravulizumab group and 
1 (2.1%) patient in the placebo group had a concomitant important IST change that resulted in exclusion 
from the PPS.

Exposure 
Median (min, max) study duration was 73.50 (13.7, 117.7) weeks in the ravulizumab group and 43.14 
(8.0, 208.6) weeks in the placebo group. As of the data cut-off, 55 (94.8%) ravulizumab-treated patients 
were followed for > 12 months, with 21 (36.2%) patients followed for > 18 months. 
The  median  (min,  max)  number  of  ravulizumab  infusions  was  11.0  (2,  18).  Two  patients  received 
supplemental infusions of ravulizumab, 1 supplemental infusion in1 patient and 3 supplemental infusions 
in the other patient. No patients in the ravulizumab treatment group had any missed doses during the 
Primary Treatment Period. 
Delayed doses, defined as doses that occurred outside of the protocol-specified window, were identified 
for  20  (34.5%)  patients  in  the  ravulizumab  group.  Delayed  doses  that  occurred>  14  days  after  the 
protocol-specified time point were identified in 9 of these 20 patients; however, no patients had a dose 
delayed > 35 days. 
Numbers analysed 
The definitions of analysis populations for Study ALXN1210-NMO-307 were similar to the definitions used 
in  Study  ECU-NMO-301,  with  any  differences  stemming  from  study  design  as  described  in  Appendix 
16.1.9 Statistical Methods Section 9.6. In total, all 47 (100%) patients randomized to placebo in Study 
ECU-NMO-301  were  eligible  for  inclusion  in  the  comparator  group  in  the  analysis  sets  for  Study 
ALXN1210-NMO-307. 
All 58 treated patients in the ravulizumab group and all 47 treated patients in the placebo group were 
included in the Full Analysis Set, Safety Set, and PK/PD Set. 
The PPS excluded 3 patients in the ravulizumab group for major IST changes, including 1 patient who 
stopped  background  steroids  on  Day  1,  1  patient  who  stopped  background  steroids  on  Day  2,  and  1

patient who stopped prednisolone on Day 42; 3 patients in the placebo group were excluded from the 
PPS,  1  each  due  to  major  IST  change  (initiation  of  prednisone  after  randomization),  key  inclusion/ 
exclusion criteria (IC/EC) eligibility violation (daily corticosteroid dose more than prednisone 20 mg/day 
[or equivalent] after Screening), and emergency unblinding.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Time to First Adjudicated On-trial Relapse 
Primary Analysis 
The study met its primary objective by demonstrating the efficacy of ravulizumab for the treatment of 
adult patients with NMOSD. No patients in the ravulizumab group had an adjudicated On-trial Relapse 
during the Primary Treatment Period of Study ALXN1210-NMO-307, compared with 20 patients (42.6%) 
in the placebo group from Study ECU-NMO-301 (Table 29).

The  hazard  ratio  (95%  CI) 
for  ravulizumab  compared  with  placebo  was  0.014  (0.000, 
0.103),representing a 98.6% reduction in the risk of relapse. At Week 48, all patients in the ravulizumab 
group were relapse free (versus 63.2% in placebo-treated patients). This effect was sustained through 
the end of the Primary Treatment Period, at which point all patients in the ravulizumab group remained 
relapse free. The median (min, max) analysis follow-up time was 73.50 (11.00,117.71) weeks for the 
ravulizumab group and 36.00 (1.86, 117.71) weeks for the placebo group. 
The  E-value  presented  in  Table  29  quantifies  the  level  of  confounding  which  could  account  for  the 
estimated treatment effect observed in the primary analysis. The E-value of the upper confidence limit 
(8.33) indicates that only an unmeasured confounder that is associated with an 8.33 times greater risk 
of  an  adjudicated  On-trial  Relapse  and  that  occurs  8.33  times  more  in  patients  in  the  placebo  group 
would result in a non-significant treatment effect. Therefore, any unmeasured confounder is unlikely to 
have a large enough impact on the results of the primary analysis to account for the observed treatment 
effect. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
• 
Time to First Adjudicated On-trial Relapse Stratified by Propensity Score 
When stratifying by propensity score, the significant effect of ravulizumab compared to placebo on the 
time to first adjudicated On-trial Relapse and relapse risk reduction during the Primary Treatment Period 
was maintained (p < 0.0001); the hazard ratio (95% CI) for ravulizumab compared with placebo was 
0.019 (0.000, 0.153), representing a 98.1% reduction in the risk of relapse. 
• 
Time to First Adjudicated On-trial Relapse Using Propensity Scores in a Weighted Analysis 
Using propensity scores in a weighted analysis, the hazard ratio (95% CI) for ravulizumab compared 
with placebo was 0.014 (0.000, 0.101), representing a 98.6% reduction in the risk of relapse (Figure 
16), which is highly consistent with that of the main analysis.

Subgroup Analyses 
A  consistent  effect  on  the  time  to  first  adjudicated  On-trial  Relapse  and  relapse  risk  reduction  was 
observed for ravulizumab compared with placebo across all pre-specified subgroups, including region, 
age group, gender, race (Asian, White), use of concomitant IST at baseline, and prior rituximab use. The 
treatment  effect  was  notably  observed  in  the  subgroup  with  no  IST  use  at  baseline  (ie,  patients  on 
ravulizumab monotherapy or placebo alone during the Primary Treatment Period); the hazard ratio for 
the subgroup of patients with no IST use at baseline was 0.021 (0.000, 0.176), representing a 97.9% 
reduction in the risk of relapse.

Supportive Analyses 
•  On-trial Relapses as Determined by the Treating Physician and Cases of Interest 
Two patients in the ravulizumab group had an On-trial Relapse as determined by the Treating Physician 
that was adjudicated negatively by the RAC. The results for time to first On-trial Relapse as determined 
by the Treating Physician were consistent with the results of the primary analysis. A significant effect on 
the time to first On-trial Relapse as determined by the Treating Physician was observed for ravulizumab 
compared with placebo (p < 0.0001). The hazard ratio (95% CI) for ravulizumab compared with placebo 
was 0.039 (0.009, 0.164), representing a 96.1% reduction in the risk of relapse. 
Overall, 11 cases of interest in the ravulizumab group and 12 cases of interest in the placebo group were 
identified. All 11 (100%) cases of interest in the ravulizumab group were adjudicated negatively by the 
RAC. One case of interest in the placebo group was adjudicated positively by the RAC. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The  study  met  the  first  2  of  the  5  secondary  endpoints  according  to  the  prespecified  rank  order: 
Adjudicated On-trial ARR (Table 31) and clinically important changes from baseline in HAI (Table 32). 
Since the treatment effect did not reach statistical significance for the EQ-5D Index Score assessment 
(p = 0.0567), nominal p-values are presented for change from baseline in EQ-5D VAS Score and clinically 
important worsening in EDSS score. 
Adjudicated On-trial ARR 
The adjudicated On-trial ARR (95% CI) was 0.00 (NA, 0.044) in the ravulizumab group, representing a 
statistically  significant  lower  ARR  than  0.25  (1  adjudicated  On-trial  annualized  relapse  per  4  patient-
years) (p < 0.0001). The results of sensitivity analyses, including a comparison with the placebo group 
from  Study  ECU-NMO-301,  were  statistically  significant  and  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  main 
analysis.

ARR = annualized relapse rate; CI = confidence interval; NA = not applicable 
Clinically important change from baseline in ambulatory function, as measured by the HAI score, was 
selected as the next hierarchical secondary endpoint to capture the effect of ravulizumab on progressive 
worsening of gait, a key manifestation of neurologic disability in patients with NMOSD. 
HAI Score 
Patients in the ravulizumab group were less likely to experience worsening in mobility-related neurologic 
disability, as measured by HAI score, compared with patients in the placebo group (Odds ratio [95% 
CI]; p-value: 0.155 [0.031, 0.771]; p = 0.0228). Clinically important worsening from baseline in HAI 
score  was  reported  for  2  (3.4%)  patients  in  the  ravulizumab  group  and  11  (23.4%)  patients  in  the 
placebo group (Table 31). The treatment effect of clinically important worsening from baseline in HAI 
score stratifying by propensity score strata, while not statistically significant, was numerically consistent 
with the results of the main analysis. 
ED-5D Index Score and ED-5D VAS 
While not statistically significant, similar trends favoring ravulizumab were observed for the analyses of 
EQ-5D Index Score (p = 0.0567) and EQ-5D VAS (nominal p = 0.0297). Since the treatment effect did 
not reach statistical significance for the EQ-5D Index Score assessment, nominal p-values are presented 
for change from baseline in EQ-5D VAS Score. 
EDSS 
The  treatment  effect  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  for  the  EDSS  score,  clinically  important 
worsening in EDSS score are presented in Table 31.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The evidence of the efficacy of Ultomiris (ravulizumab) in the treatment of NMOSD patients with AQP4 
antibodies is provided by one phase 3 clinical trial, study ALXN1210-NMO-307, still ongoing. 
The  use  of  ravulizumab  in  this  condition  is  based  on  the  role  of  the  complement  activation  in  the 
pathogenesis  of  NMOSD.  When  AQP4-antibody  binds  to  AQP4  channels  on  astrocytes  the  classical 
complement  cascade  is  activated  causing  granulocyte,  eosinophil,  and  lymphocyte  infiltration, 
culminating in injury first to astrocyte, then oligodendrocytes, followed by demyelination and neuronal 
loss12,13. Ravulizumab blocks the formation of terminal complement complex by selectively preventing 
the enzymatic cleavage of C5.

Study ALXN1210-NMO-307 is a phase 3, single arm, open-label, multicentre study in adult patients with 
NMOSD with ravulizumab on top of the background therapy. In general, a single pivotal study could be 
acceptable considering the rarity and the progressive nature of the condition if the observed effects are 
sufficiently compelling. The clinical program as well as the design of the Study NMO-307 was discussed 
during a scientific advice in October 2019 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/545125/2019) and a follow-up procedure 
in February 2020 (EMEA/H/SA/3331/5/FU/1/2020/II). 
The study was a single arm study. The efficacy of a new treatment would normally be demonstrated in 
double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial(s). Three monoclonal antibodies have been approved 
for adults with NMOSD: eculizumab, satralizumab and inebilizumab. All have been tested in randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. During the discussion with SAWP in 2019 the Applicant argued 
that the use of a placebo arm as control was ethically unacceptable when other therapies for NMOSD 
were to be available during the conduct of the study, including eculizumab, already available in a number 
of  countries.  In  addition,  the  comparison  to  eculizumab  under  a  non-inferiority  hypothesis  was 
considered  unfeasible  in  terms  of  required  sample  size  in  a  rare  condition.  All  considered,  it  was 
concluded  that  a  single  arm  uncontrolled  study  could  be  considered  acceptable  in  these  exceptional 
circumstances.  
For comparison purposes, the Applicant has used external data, i.e. from the placebo arm of study ECU-
NMO-301  trial.  This  was  a  randomised  (2:1)  and  double-blind  trial  using  a  time-to-event  primary 
endpoint,  time-to-first  adjudicated  relapse.  As  outlined  above,  this  approach  of  using  a  retrospective 
placebo-arm as control arm was addressed during the scientific advice procedures. As discussed during 
the first advice in 2019, the fact that the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in NMOSD had been previously 
demonstrated,  that  ravulizumab  and  eculizumab  only  slightly  differs  in  their  molecular  structure  and 
have  the  same  mechanism  of  action,  that  the  biological  rationale  for  C5  inhibition  to  prevent 
complement-mediated  damage  is  established  and  that  the  non-inferiority  of  ravulizumab  versus 
eculizumab was demonstrated in two phase 3 pivotal trials in PNH (considered supportive even if the 
indication is different), are considered to provide a reasonable framework for exceptionally accepting the 
proposed approach. In addition, it was noted that to be acceptable it was important that ravulizumab 
study  included  similar  population,  operational  procedures  and  endpoints  in  order  to  get  results  as 
comparable as possible. 
The  study  was  conducted  between  December  2019  and  March  2022  (End  of  the  Primary  Treatment 
Period). One of the main concerns is the comparability of two non-contemporary groups (study ECU-
NMO-301  was  conducted  between  2014  and  2018)  and  the  intrinsic  differences  between  a  group  of 
patients prospectively studied (ravulizumab group) and a retrospectively selected placebo group without 
the protection from bias of randomisation.  
Patient population 
Adult patients with confirmed diagnosis of NMOSD (based on the 2015 international consensus diagnostic 
criteria14) who were positive for AQP4 antibodies were eligible for the study. Additionally, patients were 
required to have had at least 1 relapse in the last 12 months prior to the Screening Period and an EDSS 
score ≤ 7.  
Patients enrolled in the external placebo arm (Study ECU-NMO-301), were selected according NMO 2006 
diagnostic criteria with the requirement of the presence of AQP4-Abs. (NMO 2006/NMOSD 2007). The 
revision performed in 2015 led to broaden the clinical and neuroimaging spectrum of NMO for including 
new clinical entities and better defining brain and spinal cord MRI findings.  It could be that differences 
in  diagnostic  criteria  may  result  in  dissimilar  selected  populations,  limiting  the  interpretation  of  the 
14 Wingerchuk DM et al. Neurology® 2015;85:177–189

results. In this case, seropositive patients fulfil either or both criteria from 2006 and 2015.  15 Thus, it 
may be considered that patients recruited according to the Study ECU-NMO-301 selection criteria also 
meet the 2015 NMOSD criteria. 
Patients  with  active,  relapsing  disease  were  recruited.  Whereas  patients  in  ravulizumab  study  were 
required to have had at least 1 relapse in the last 12 months prior to entry, at least two relapses in the 
last year (or three in the last 2 years) were required in eculizumab study. In this regard more severe 
patients could be expected in the control group favouring ravulizumab.  
Both on treatment and untreated patients were allowed, provided that immunosuppressive agents were 
administered at stable doses at entry. At the time of starting the study only eculizumab was approved 
in  some  countries.  However,  immunosuppressants  were  recommended  for  the  prevention  of  relapses 
based  on  available  data.  In  an  active  population  with  previous  relapses  it  would  be  expected  that  a 
relevant number of patients were on treatment. 
A total of 78 patients were screened for this study, of which 58 patients were finally included and treated. 
Most of them (n=56; 96.6%) completed the Primary Treatment Period and 57 were on the study at the 
time of the data cut-off date (15 Mar 2022).  
The population included had a mean age of 47.4 years (ranging from 18 to 74 years). A total of 7 patients 
(12.1%) were ≥65 year-old. Most patients were female (90%), and predominantly white (50%). There 
were 29.3% of patients from Europe, 36.2% from America and 34.5% from Asia-Pacific. 
Mean age for first relapse was 42.3 year, and patients had had mean 3.6 historical relapses, with a mean 
of 1.4 relapses within the year prior to screening (historical ARR 2.04) and 1.7 within the two years prior 
to screening (historical ARR 1.87). The most frequent relapses were transverse myelitis (58.6%) and 
optic  neuritis  (43.1%).  86.2%  had  therapy  for  NMOSD  in  the  past:  mainly  corticosteroids  (50%), 
rituximab  (36%)  and  azathioprine  (22%).  At  baseline  the  majority  of  patients  (51.7%)  were  not  on 
treatment and 13.8% had not received any prior supportive IST for NMOSD. Most of the patients using 
ISTs during the study were on monotherapy (32.7%), mainly corticosteroids 20.7% and azathioprine 
5.2%. Since any relapse can result in the accumulation of neurological disability, prevention of relapse 
is the principal goal of NMOSD management16,17. For this reason and considering the history of patients 
it would have not been expected that such a relevant number of patients had entered the study without 
background therapy.  
The overall mean baseline EDSS score was 3.30 (fully ambulatory patients) and the mean HAI Score 
was 1.2 (walking patients) 
Baseline demographic characteristics were in general well balanced when the two groups (ravulizumab 
treated patients and external placebo group) were compared although patients on placebo were younger 
(47.4 vs 45.0 vs; with no elderly patients in placebo group) and European patients are less represented 
in the ravulizumab group (29.3% vs 40.4%). More Black patients (10.3% vs17.0%) were included in 
placebo arm. Ethnic differences have been reported in relation to age of onset (younger onset age in 
Afro-American/Afro-European patients than Caucasian patients), severity of the attacks (more severe 
attacks  in  Afro-descendent  patients  than  Caucasian  or  Asian  patients)  and  mortality  (higher  rates 
reported in Afro-descencent patients compared to Caucasian patients).18,19 
In line with what was expected with respect to baseline disease status placebo patients showed more 
disability than ravulizumab group: higher mean HAI Score (2.1 vs. 1.2) and mean EDSS Score (4.26 vs

3.30), and higher disease activity with 6.3 vs 3.6 total historical relapses (ARR 1y: 2.23 vs 2.04; ARR 
2y:  2.07  vs.  1.87).  The  distribution  of  nature  of  the  relapses  shows  a  higher  number  of  transverse 
myelitis (89.4% vs 58.6%) and brain stem symptoms (31.9% vs 15.5%) in patients on placebo. More 
patients in placebo group had been previously treated (95.7% vs 86.2%) and were on treatment during 
the study (72.3% vs 48.3%).  
Importantly, these differences between the placebo and the ravulizumab groups could have a significant 
impact on the primary and key secondary endpoints. 
In  Study  ALXN1210-NMO-307  the  end  of  the  Primary  Treatment  Period  was  to  be  triggered  when  2 
patients had an adjudicated On-trial Relapse and all patients had completed, or discontinued prior to, 26 
weeks on study. If 2 patients had not had an adjudicated On-trial Relapse by the time all patients had 
completed, or discontinued prior to, 50 weeks on study, the end of the Primary Treatment Period was to 
be  triggered  at  that  time.  As  no  on-trial  relapse  was  adjudicated,  the  primary  period  of  study  was 
completed  (50  weeks).  It  resulted  in  differences  in  exposure  between  the  two  arms  when  they  were 
compared;  i.e.  43.14  (8.0,  208.6)  weeks  in  the  placebo  group  vs  73.50  (13.7,  117.7)  weeks  in  the 
ravulizumab group. 
Treatment regimen 
No specific dose-response studies have been conducted for this indication. The selected dosing regimen 
is  a  loading  dose  of  2400-3000  mg  followed  by maintenance  doses of  3000-3600  mg  on  Day 15  and 
then q8w. This dosing regimen is identical to that already approved for the treatment of PNH aHUS and 
gMG and based on the inhibition of terminal complement activation achieved by >90% of patients (see 
clinical pharmacology section). 
During the primary treatment period ravulizumab was administered in a 10 mg/mL formulation.  During 
the long-term extension period patients were treated with the 100 mg/ml formulation, approved at that 
time, on the same weight-based dose regimen. 
Endpoints 
Given the relapsing course of the condition and that accrual of neurological impairment is mainly NMO 
relapses-related the main objective of reducing the risk of relapses is adequate. The primary efficacy 
endpoint is time to first adjudicated On-Trial Relapse.  
Additionally,  the  effect  on  neurologic  disability  was  evaluated  by  as  secondary  endpoints  measuring 
changes on Hauser Ambulation Index and EDSS score. Quality of life was also evaluated with Euro-QoL-
5D. 
The study has included validated scales and the primary and secondary endpoints have been tested in 
clinical developments of medicinal products for the treatment of NMOSD. In general, they are considered 
to measure relevant aspects of the condition and are in line with the variables assessed in study ECU-
NMO-301  as  recommended  in  the  scientific  advice.  The  inclusion  of  an  independent  committee  of 
adjudication  provides  robustness  to  the  adjudication  of  events  although  the  unblinded  nature  of  the 
study cannot preclude the risk of bias. 
MRI was not included among the selected biomarkers. In case of relapse, additional tests (e.g., MRI, 
OCT, laboratory tests) could be performed at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Statistical analysis 
A sample size of 55 patients was estimated, which is a limited number of patients integrating an efficacy 
database. Of note, one of the assumptions refers to the size of the placebo control group (47 patients 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 66/92 
 
  
 
 
from Study ECU-NMO-301) but it should be taken into account that a randomisation ratio of 2:1 was 
followed in the original study, resulting in a total of 96 patients in the active arm. 
The MAH has implemented a number of measures in order to reduce the potential bias related to the 
fact that study ALXN1210-NMO-307 is open label. These measures include the evaluation of the primary 
efficacy measure by an independent committee, and the blindness to all the study data. However, the 
fact that both the investigator and the expert members of the committee were aware of the treatment 
and the lack of objective measures does not dissipate the concerns on the risk of bias.  
It  is  also  noted  that  both  the  baseline  data  and  outcome  results  from  the  external-control  arm  were 
available during the planning phase before the start of the single arm trial. Thus, it is challenging to rule 
out any potential influence to the actual single arm trial patients’ characteristics and results. In response 
to this, the MAH provided a description of the measures taken to ensure that the prior knowledge of the 
external-control data had not affected the conduction of the analyses.  
The  main  analysis  for  the  primary  endpoint,  time  to  first  adjudicated  on-trial  relapse  in  the  FAS 
population, was analysed using the log-rank test with a two-sided 5% alpha level. Hazard ratio and risk 
reduction was summarised from a Cox proportional hazards model including treatment group as a factor.  
This is considered as a standard procedure in randomised trials and per se might be considered adequate, 
with or without stratification, in those designs. However, the two treatment arms do not come from a 
randomised design and comparability at baseline is far from being guaranteed. The proposed strategy 
may be considered adequate as an additional sensitivity analyses, but not as the main strategy for the 
main analysis given the risk of bias. 
The MAH has followed the guidance provided in the scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/545125/2019) 
and efforts have been made to address the concerns of possible hidden effects of confounding factors 
due to the comparison of the treatment arm against an external control. To tackle this issue, a propensity 
score  method  has  been  conducted  to  investigate  both  sources  of  patients’  data  with  similar  baseline 
characteristics. The assessment of the sequential steps taken by the MAH are crucial in the assessment 
to contextualise the final results presented in this procedure.  
The probability of being in the treatment arm compared to the placebo arm, the PS, has been modelled 
by a logistic regression using baseline covariates as predictors. The variables considered in this analysis 
were  the  following:  (a)  region  (Americas,  Europe,  Asia-Pacific),  (b)  gender,  (c)  age  at  first  dose 
(continuous), (d) background IST (yes/no), (e) baseline EDSS (continuous) and (f) historical ARR the 24 
months prior to screening. 
The MAH has considered the following strategies to analyse the data based on the PS: stratification by 
the median PS and sIPTW. In principle, sIPTW is normally preferred but both are considered valid and 
results are provided using both strategies. However, there is a number of concerns that was addressed 
by the Applicant: 
Initially the Applicant provided the baseline covariates by propensity score strata and treatment group 
which are above or below the median scores with the SMDs. However, comparative information on all 
baseline data including raw SMDs and after the sIPTW with no stratification was not initially provided 
(only  initially  provided  for  selected  baseline  data)  and  was  considered  key  to  judge  the  baseline 
comparability of the proposed main (raw/unadjusted) analysis. These tables were provided during the 
procedure.  Additionally,  descriptive  statistics  and  SMDs  for  all  baseline  variables  for  the  raw  and  the 
sIPTW analyses were presented upon request.  
Furthermore,  although  there  is  no  universal  consensus  on  a  specific  threshold  for  a  standardised 
difference to indicate a substantial imbalance, there are many publications where a value of |0.10| has 
been proposed as the “imbalance” criterion. The Applicant justified in their responses the reasons why a 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 67/92 
 
  
 
 
|0.25| threshold was used instead, mainly based on sample size limitations. This can be acknowledged. 
Further,  additional  (sensitivity)  analyses  have  been  provided  supporting  the  originally  estimated 
treatment effect.  
The potential role of all covariates and their impact on the outcome efficacy results was also discussed 
by  the  Applicant.  The  provided  discussion  can  be  followed.  Lastly,  the  Applicant  has  performed  an 
additional post hoc propensity score model using most of the baseline characteristics. The results showed 
a  HR  of  0.014  (0.000,  0.105)  and  a  risk  reduction  of  98.6%  (89.5%,  100.0%).  These  results  are 
consistent with those initially provided.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
During the study On-Trial Relapses were determined by the Treating Physicians once patients contacted 
them with sign/symptom of a potential relapse. If confirmed by the clinical evaluation, the treatment for 
the relapse and changes in the background therapy was at his/her discretion. According to the study 
protocol, the recommended treatment included one gram of IV methylprednisolone administered daily 
for  3-5  days  followed  by  an  oral  prednisone  tapering.  PE  was  recommended  in  case  of  insufficient 
response  to  methylprednisolone.  Once  the  relapse  was  over  the  patient  may  continue  in  the  study  if 
considered  appropriate.  The  RAC  reviewed  the  On-Trial  Relapses  in  order  to  decide  whether  the 
adjudication criteria established had been met.   
No patients in the ravulizumab group had an adjudicated On-trial Relapse. In the external placebo control 
a total of 20 relapses were adjudicated by the external adjudication committee. The primary endpoint 
was met. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for ravulizumab compared with placebo was 0.014 (0.000, 0.103), 
representing a 98.6% reduction in the risk of relapse. All patients on ravulizumab were relapse-free at 
the end of the Primary Treatment Period (versus 63.2% in placebo-treated patients).  
This analysis however, did not take into account the lack of randomisation and no SMDs on the raw data 
were provided to support the baseline similarity of this main unadjusted analysis. There is no information 
either on the similarity of both arms once applied the sIPTW analysis since SMDs are missing and it is 
difficult to assess the similarity in the PS stratified analysis.  However, descriptive statistics and SMDs 
for all baseline variables for the raw and the sIPTW analyses were presented upon request during the 
review  procedure.  Regarding  the  testing  of  the  secondary  endpoints,  once  the  primary  endpoint  was 
statistically significant, a closed testing procedure was performed with a pre-specified rank order. In the 
hierarchy, the Adjudicated On-Trial ARR and Clinically important changes from baseline in ambulatory 
function were met (p-values: <0.0001 and 0.0228 respectively).  
As supportive analysis, the E-value has been provided by the Applicant. This is welcome as it provides 
some reassurance that it is unlikely that the results would have changed the direction of the primary 
outcome (i.e., to be no longer statistically significant), even in the presence of unmeasured confounder 
biases.  
Overall,  the  efficacy  of  ravulizumab  appears  evidenced  but  there  is  a  risk  of  overestimation  of  the 
treatment effect, particularly as the profile of patients according to the baseline covariates appears to 
be better in the active arm. 
For comparison, in the original Study ECU-NMO-301, 3 adjudicated on-trial relapses were reported in 
the  eculizumab  group.  The  fact  that  no  relapses  were  adjudicated  for  ravulizumab  in  spite  of  the 
differences in exposure between the groups may be related to the less severity of patients included in 
ravulizumab study, to the differences in sample size (eculizumab n=96, ravulizumab n=58) and/or the 
lack  of  “power”  of  the  open  label  design  to  detect  one  relapse.  Also,  it  could  be  related  to  a  higher 
efficacy of ravulizumab compared to eculizumab although no relevant differences have been observed 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 68/92 
 
  
 
 
in the rest of indications so far. It is uncertain how many relapses would have occurred (in the placebo 
arm) of a randomized, placebo controlled study, so including two truly comparable arms. At this stage 
the actual effect (size) of ravulizumab cannot be considered convincingly established.  
Two  patients  receiving  ravulizumab  had  a  relapse  as  determined  by  the  treating  physician  but  not 
adjudicated as such by the RAC. In addition, 11 cases of interest in the ravulizumab group and 12 cases 
of interest in the placebo group were identified. All 11 (100%) cases of interest in the ravulizumab group 
were  adjudicated  negatively  by  the  RAC.  One  case  of  interest  in  the  placebo  group  was  adjudicated 
positively by the RAC. 
As  for  the  clinical  (secondary)  endpoints,  mainly  related  with  disability,  the  lack  of  relapses  in 
ravulizumab treated patients makes that no relevant improvement is observed in this group given that 
worsening of visual and motor function is directly related to relapses. This is also the case for QoL where 
no relevant changes are expected with respect to baseline except for the safety profile of ravulizumab. 
In any case, the interpretation of any change is challenging in these circumstances, given the absence 
of  a  concomitant  comparator,  the  limited  number of  patients  treated  and the differences in  exposure 
between the active treatment and the external placebo. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of ravulizumab on prevention of disease activity (relapses) has been established in a single 
pivotal open label study (ALXN1210-NMO-307). No patients in the ravulizumab group had an adjudicated 
On-trial Relapse during the Primary Treatment Period of Study ALXN1210-NMO-307. The study met its 
primary endpoint of time to first adjudicated On-trial Relapse and relapse risk reduction, and some of 
the  secondary  endpoints  tested  (i.e.  Adjudicated  On-Trial  ARR,  and  reduction  of  clinical  worsening  in 
ambulatory function as measured by the HAI score). 
Instead of a concurrent control arm, an external placebo control (i.e. the placebo group from study ECU-
NMO-301)  has  been  used  for  interpretation  of  the  data,  that  diminishes  the  strength  of  the  efficacy 
results presented. Even if the particularities of both the disease and the drug are acknowledged, the risk 
of overestimation of the treatment effect cannot be ruled out in an uncontrolled open label study. In this 
context,  the  Applicant  explained  the  measures  implemented  during  the  study to  reduce  the  potential 
bias  and  provided  additional  sensitivity  analyses.  These  efforts  are  acknowledged  and  although  the 
uncertainties are not fully addressed, there is sufficient evidence to confirm the effect of ravulizumab in 
the intended indication.   
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety evaluation supporting the use of ravulizumab administered intravenously for the treatment 
of  adult  patients  with  NMOSD  is  based  on  the  Primary  Treatment  Period  of  the  pivotal  clinical  study 
ALXN1210-NMO-307, a Phase 3, external placebo-controlled, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of ravulizumab in adult patients with NMOSD. 
Based on the protocol-defined criteria for ending the Primary Treatment Period and because no patients 
had  an  adjudicated  On-trial  Relapse  during  the  study,  the  end  of  the  Primary  Treatment  Period  was 
triggered  when  all  patients  completed,  or  discontinued  prior  to,  50  weeks  on  study.  Patients  who 
completed 50 weeks on study prior to this point remained in the Primary Treatment Period until it was 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 69/92 
 
  
 
 
completed for all patients. Therefore, the overall treatment duration for an individual patient varied and 
was dependent upon when they enrolled in the study. 
Safety analyses were performed on the Safety Set, which included all patients who received at least one 
dose of ravulizumab. 
Subgroup analyses were based on age at first study drug infusion, gender, race, and region. 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  58  adult  patients  with  documented  diagnosis  of  anti-AQP4  antibody-positive  NMOSD  were 
randomized and treated in Study ALXN1210-NMO-307. As of the clinical data cutoff date, 56 of the 58 
patients  had  completed  the  Primary  Treatment  Period  and  were  ongoing  in  the  Long-term  Extension 
Period. Two (3.4%) patients discontinued from the Primary Treatment Period due to AEs. 
The median (min, max) study duration was 73.50 (13.7, 117.7) weeks in the ravulizumab group (Study 
ALXN1210-NMO-307). As  of the data cut-off, 55 (94.8%) ravulizumab-treated patients were followed 
for > 12 months, with 21 (36.2%) patients followed for > 18 months. Overall, treatment exposure was 
84.1 patient-years for ravulizumab. 
Treatment compliance (defined as receiving the full intended amount of study drug) was 100% in all 58 
patients treated with ravulizumab. 
The  majority  of  patients  in  Study  ALXN1210-NMO-307  were  female  (89.7%),  not  Hispanic  or  Latino 
(77.6%), and White (50.0%) or Asian (36.2%). The mean age at first dose was 47.4 years. Most patients 
(n = 50; 86.2%) used ISTs for NMOSD relapse prevention prior to study treatment. The most common 
ISTs  prior  to  Study  ALXN1210-NMO-307  treatment  were  corticosteroids,  rituximab,  and  azathioprine. 
48.3% of the patients in Study ALXN1210-NMO-307 were on ISTs at baseline 
Adverse events 
Overall,  TEAEs  were  reported  in  53  (91.4%)  patients  (Table  34)  in  Study  ALXN1210-NMO-307.  Most 
TEAEs  were  not  related  to  study  drug  and  were  mild  in  severity.  Severe  TEAEs  were  reported  in  9 
(15.5%) patients. Severe TEAEs were most common in the System Organ Class (SOC) of Infections and 
infestations  (1  [1.7%]  patient  each  with  encephalitis  meningococcal,  intervertebral  discitis, 
meningococcal sepsis, pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infection). There were no severe TEAEs 
of COVID-19. In addition, 2 (3.4%) patients experienced severe TEAEs in the SOC of Musculoskeletal 
and  connective  tissue  disorders  (back  pain  and  rheumatoid  arthritis).  Other  severe  TEAEs  included  1 
(1.7%) patient each in the SOCs of General disorders and administration site conditions (fatigue); Injury, 
poisoning  and  procedural  complications  (alcohol  poisoning);  Neoplasms  benign,  malignant  and 
unspecified  (incl  cysts  and  polyps)  (invasive  lobular  breast  carcinoma);  Nervous  system  disorders 
(dizziness);  Psychiatric  disorders  (suicidal  ideation);  and  Renal  and  urinary  disorders  (acute  kidney 
injury). 
AEs considered related to the study drug were reported in 26 (44.8%) patients in the ravulizumab group. 
Related TEAEs were most common in the SOCs of Infections and infestations (9 [15.5%] patients) and 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (4 [6.9%] patients). Related TEAEs in the Infections and 
infestations SOC included cystitis, urinary tract infection, and upper respiratory tract infection (2 [3.4%] 
patients  each)  and  nasopharyngitis,  sinusitis,  encephalitis  meningococcal,  meningococcal  sepsis,  and 
pneumonia (1 [1.7%] patient each). Related TEAEs in the Injury, poisoning and procedural complications 
SOC included 7 events of infusion related reaction in 4 (6.9%) patients. 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 70/92 
 
  
 
 
TESAEs  were  reported  in  8  (13.8%)  patients.  Two  (3.4%)  patients  each  experienced  1  event  of 
meningococcal  infection.  Both  patients  were  promptly  treated  and  recovered  with  no  sequelae.  The 
TESAE of encephalitis meningococcal, along with 2 non-serious TEAEs (bronchitis and stenotrophomonas 
infection), led to withdrawal of the study drug in one (1.7%) of these patients. 
No patients in the ravulizumab group died during the study and, overall, ravulizumab was well tolerated.

TEAEs are AEs with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of study drug. For the ravulizumab treatment group, AEs reported 
as Grade 1 were mapped to mild, Grade 2 to moderate, and Grades 3 to 5 to severe. Percentages are based on the total number of 
patients in the Safety Set in the ravulizumab treatment group. If a patient had multiple events for a particular relationship or severity 
category, he/she is counted only once for that relationship or severity. In the events column, all events are included. Patient-years 
for a treatment group = sum of study duration (years) of all patients in the treatment group; rate per 100 PY = 100*the number of 
events/patient-years.   
a For one patient, the reason for discontinuing was 'Adverse Event'; this event (invasive lobular breast carcinoma) is not included in 
this row, because it was reported as dose not changed. The patient remained on study for approximately 6 months after AE onset. 
AEs  =  adverse  events;  PY  =  patient-years;  TEAEs  =  treatment-emergent  adverse  events;  TESAEs  =  treatment-emergent  serious

The overall rate of TEAEs did not increase with increased exposure to ravulizumab and no trends were 
observed in the rates of individual TEAEs with increased exposure to ravulizumab (Table 35).

A total of 15 (25.9%) patients in the ravulizumab group experienced 16 AEs of COVID-19 during the 
study. Fourteen patients had events coded to the Preferred Term of COVID-19, and 1 patient had an 
event coded to the Preferred Term of SARS-CoV-2 test positive. The patient with 2 events had 1 event 
each coded to the Preferred Terms of COVID-19 and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. No patients died 
of COVID-19 during the study, and none of the TEAEs related to COVID-19 were serious or considered 
related to the study drug. All cases of COVID-19 resolved, including the 1 case of post-acute COVID-19 
syndrome. 
Common AEs 
The most common TEAEs (occurring in ≥ 10% of patients) included COVID-19 (14 [24.1%] patients), 
headache (14 [24.1%] patients), back pain (7 [12.1%] patients), arthralgia (6 [10.3%] patients), and 
urinary tract infection (6 [10.3%] patients). Of note, Study ALXN1210-NMO-307 was initiated on 13 Dec 
2019, and approximately 90% of patients were enrolled during the COVID-19 pandemic (ie, Mar 2020 
or after).

Other Serious AE (SAE) 
Eight (13.8%) patients each reported a single TESAE during the study. The only System Organ Class 
(SOC)  with  TESAEs  reported  by  more  than  1  patient  in  the  ravulizumab  group  was  Infections  and 
infestations  (5  [8.6%]  patients).  These  TESAEs  included  infection  (not  otherwise  specified), 
intervertebral  discitis,  pneumonia,  meningococcal  sepsis,  and  encephalitis  meningococcal  (1  [1.7%] 
patient  each).  Other  TESAEs  included  spinal  osteoarthritis,  invasive  lobular  breast  carcinoma,  and

patients  in  the  ravulizumab  group  experienced  1  TESAE  each  of  meningococcal  infection  (Preferred 
Terms: meningococcal sepsis and encephalitis meningococcal). Both patients were treated promptly with 
antibiotics  and  recovered  with  no  sequelae.  One  patient  discontinued  the  study  drug  and  study  as  a 
result of this event, and the other patient was continuing to receive ravulizumab in the study as of the 
data cutoff date. 
Infusion Reactions 
Preferred  terms  indicating  local  (infusion  site  or  injection  site  reactions),  systemic  (infusion-
associated/infusion-related reactions within 24 hours of infusion start), and in the Anaphylactic reaction 
(Narrow) and Hypersensitivity (Narrow) SMQs were evaluated. 
Table 39: Definitions for Infusion Reactions  
a Includes PTs containing "infusion site" (eg, "infusion site reaction”, "infusion site hypersensitivity"). b Includes selected PTs indicating 
potential systemic reactions occurring within 24 hours of the start of the infusion. 
AE = adverse event; PT = preferred term; SMQ = Standardised MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) Query 
Using these search criteria, 20 (34.5%) patients had 1 or more TEAEs identified as potential infusion 
reactions. None of these events were serious, and none resulted in withdrawal of ravulizumab.

Four (6.9%) patients in the ravulizumab group had infusion reactions that led to study drug interruption 
during a total of 5 infusions. In three patients (Preferred Term of infusion related reaction), the events 
were described by the Investigators as rigors and abdominal pain (1 patient each) and muscle spasms 
and back pain (occurring during 2 infusions in 1 patient). One patient experienced vomiting requiring 
interruption of the infusion. None of these infusion reactions were serious, and the total infusion volume 
was subsequently administered in each case. No patients experienced an anaphylactic reaction.

Adverse  events  are  coded  using  MedDRA  Dictionary  Version  25.0.  Infusion  Reactions  are  derived  from  the  Narrow  SMQ  of 
Hypersensitivity and Anaphylactic reaction, and the special categories of Infusion Site Reactions and Infusion Reactions (within 24 
hours). TEAEs are AEs with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of study drug. Percentages are based on the total number 
of patients in the Safety Set in the ravulizumab treatment group. If a patient had multiple events for a particular SOC or PT, he/she 
is counted only once for that SOC or PT. SOCs are presented in alphabetic order. PTs are in the order of descending frequency in the 
ravulizumab column. 
Patient-Years for a treatment group = sum of Study Duration (years) of all patients in the treatment group; Rate per 100 PY = 100*the

Adverse events related to COVID-19 
A total of 15 (25.9%) patients with 16 adverse events indicating COVID-19 infection, positive test for 
SARS-CoV-2, and/or complications of COVID-19 infection were identified. Fourteen patients had events 
coded to the preferred term of COVID-19, and 1 patient had an event coded to the preferred term of 
SARS-CoV-2 test positive. The patient with 2 events had 1 event each coded to the preferred terms of 
COVID-19 and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Five of the 15 patients (33.3%) developed COVID-19 
infection before their first COVID-19 vaccination, 7 of 15 (46.7%) patients developed COVID-19 after at 
least 1 vaccination, and 3 of 15 (20.0%) patients did not receive a COVID-19 vaccination. The median 
(min, max) time between the first dose of ravulizumab and COVID-19 onset was 378.0 (40, 740) days. 
No patients died of COVID-19 during the study, and none of the TEAEs related to COVID-19 were serious 
or considered related to the study drug. All cases of COVID-19 resolved, including the 1 case of post-
acute COVID-19 syndrome. 
Laboratory findings 
Chemistry and haematology parameters 
No clinically significant trends were observed in any chemistry and haematology parameters over time 
in Study ALXN1210-NMO-307.Of the reported TEAEs that were associated with a laboratory finding, the 
majority  were  mild  in  severity,  not  considered  related  to  the  study  drug,  and  resolved  without 
interruption  of  the  study  drug.  No  patients  in  the  ravulizumab  group  had  a  TEAE  associated  with  a 
laboratory finding that was considered serious. 
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 77/92 
 
  
 
 
 
 
No clinically significant trends were observed in any vital sign parameters, body weight or ECG results 
over time. No safety signals were identified through physical examination. 
One  (1.7%)  patient  with  a  history  of  depression  (ongoing)  experienced  2  events  of  suicidal  ideation 
during treatment with ravulizumab. One of the events was considered non-serious and of Grade 2 and 
the other event was reported as a TESAE (suicidal ideation) and of Grade 4. This TESAE resolved and no 
action was taken with the study drug in response to this event. Both events of suicidal ideation were 
considered not related to study drug by the Investigator. 
No pregnancies were reported in Study ALXN1210-NMO-307. 
Immunogenicity 
Five  (8.6%)  of  58  patients  in  the  ravulizumab  group  were  classified  as  having  pre-existing 
immunoreactivity (ie, an ADA-positive response at baseline, with either all post-first-dose ADA results 
negative or all post-first-dose ADA responses less than 4-fold over the baseline titer level). One of these 
5 patients was ADA positive at Week 26 with a low titer of 1:3. The baseline titer of this patient could 
not be determined. Based on the definition of pre-existing immunoreactivity and given that the only ADA 
positive sample (Week 26) during the treatment phase was at a low titer, this patient was categorized 
as exhibiting pre-existing immunoreactivity. None of the samples that were positive in the ADA assay 
exhibited any neutralizing activity in the neutralizing antibody assay. 
No  treatment-emergent  immunogenicity  (ie,  an  ADA-positive  response  post  first  dose  when  baseline 
results  are  negative  or  missing)  was  observed  following  ravulizumab  administration  to  patients  with 
NMOSD during the Primary Treatment Period of Study ALXN1210-NMO-307.  
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic factors 
Analyses  of  the  safety  profile  by  intrinsic  factors  (ie,  age,  gender,  race,  geographic  region)  were 
performed based on TEAEs and TESAEs. No notable trends were observed in any subgroup; however, 
some subgroups included a small number of patients, which limits interpretation of these results. 
Extrinsic factors 
No subgroup analyses were performed based on extrinsic factors. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Ravulizumab has not been studied in pregnant or lactating females. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with ravulizumab IV. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Two (3.4%) patients discontinued from the Primary Treatment Period due to adverse events. One (1.7%) 
patient experienced 3 TEAEs (bronchitis, encephalitis meningococcal, and stenotrophomonas infection) 
that  resulted  in  withdrawal  from  the  study  drug.  One  additional  patient  in  the  ravulizumab  group 
discontinued the Primary Treatment Period due to an AE of invasive lobular breast carcinoma. The patient 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 78/92 
 
  
 
 
remained on treatment for approximately 6 months following the diagnosis, but eventually discontinued 
the study due to the ongoing cancer and need for additional treatment. This patient is not included in 
Table 41, as the action taken with study drug due to the TEAE was “dose not changed”. 
Table 41: Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Resulting in Interruption of or Withdrawal from 
Study Drug in the Ravulizumab Group (Safety Set) 
Adverse events are coded using MedDRA Version 25.0. TEAEs are AEs with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of study 
drug. Percentages are based on the total number of patients in the Safety Set in the ravulizumab treatment group. If a patient had 
multiple  events  for  a  particular  PT,  he/she  is  counted  only  once  for  that  PT.  PTs  are  in  the  order  of  descending  frequency  in  the 
ravulizumab column. Additional TEAEs resulting in study drug interruption (ie, delayed infusions) were identified after clinical database 
lock. These TEAEs are discussed in text but are not reflected in the table above. For one patient, the reason for discontinuing was 
'Adverse Event'; this event (invasive lobular breast carcinoma) is not included in this row, because it was reported as dose not changed. 
The patient remained on study for approximately 6 months after AE onset. 
AEs = adverse events; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; PT = Preferred Term; TEAEs = treatment-emergent 
adverse events 
Post marketing experience 
The estimated postmarketing exposure to ravulizumab IV since the first Marketing Authorization (21 Dec 
2018) through 31 Dec 2021 was 5733.9 PY for PNH and aHUS indications. 
Meningococcal infection remains an important identified risk for ravulizumab IV based on the mechanism 
of  action,  findings  from  the  ravulizumab  clinical  studies,  and  long-term  experience  with  eculizumab 
(SOLIRIS®), another approved C5 inhibitor. 
The cumulative postmarketing reporting rate for meningococcal infections is approximately 0.05 cases 
per  100  PY  (3  cases  per  5733.9  PY).  The  understanding  and  characterization  of  this  risk  remain 
unchanged  based  on  the  cumulative  data  as  of  31  Dec  2021.  Mitigation  measures  for  the  risk  of 
meningococcal infections already in place for ravulizumab remain appropriate and effective and will be 
applied similarly for patients with NMOSD. 
Additionally, hypersensitivity reaction was confirmed as an identified risk based on a cumulative data 
review of the Standardised MedDRA Query hypersensitivity.  
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Ravulizumab is currently approved for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with PNH and aHUS, 
and for the treatment of adult patients with gMG. From the first Marketing Authorization (21 Dec 2018) 
to 31 Dec 2021, the cumulative postmarketing exposure to ravulizumab was 5733.9 patient-years. The 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 79/92 
 
  
 
 
 
 
safety profile of ravulizumab is already known. Ravulizumab is derived from eculizumab and the safety 
profile of eculizumab is also taken into consideration.  
The safety analyses for ravulizumab for the treatment of NMOSD are based on the pivotal phase 3 Study 
ALXN1210-NMO-307, an external placebo-controlled, open-label, multicenter study. 
The ravulizumab clinical development programme for NMOSD includes results from 58 patients treated 
with ravulizumab from study ALXN1210-NMO-307 and 47 patients treated with placebo from study ECU-
NMO-301 as the external control group. 
A total of 58 patients were exposed to ravulizumab as of the clinical cut-off date (84.1 patient-years of 
exposure). These patients were treated with the proposed dosing regimen for a median duration of 73.14 
weeks. The median (min, max) number of ravulizumab infusions was 11.0 (2, 18). Only 21 patients have 
been  followed  for  more  than  18  months  so  far  (study  still  ongoing).  This  is  a  rather  limited  safety 
database for the global analysis. Given the low prevalence of NMOSD, drug exposure can be considered 
acceptable  for  the  short-term  safety  assessment  of  ravulizumab.  The  available  safety  information  of 
ravulizumab  in  the  already  authorised  indications  (PNH,  aHUS,  gMG)  can  be  taken  as  supportive 
considering  that  patients  have  been  treated  with  the  same  dosing  regimen.  Nevertheless,  long-term 
safety  profile  is  at  present  uncertain  for  the  intended  population.  During  the  procedure  the  MAH 
submitted an update of the safety results. As of the data cut-off date (15 Jun 2022), 81% of the patients 
(47) were followed for > 18 months, with 24% (14) followed for > 24 months. 
With  regard  to  baseline  demographic  characteristics,  about  half  of  the  patients  were  white  and 
approximately 90% of the patients were women. The mean age at first dose was 47.4 years (ranging 
from  18  to  74  years).  Seven  (12.1%)  elderly  patients  were  included  in  study  ALXN1210-NMO-307. 
European  patients  represent  29.3%  of  the  patients  treated  with  ravulizumab,  36.2%  were  from  the 
Americas, and 34.5% were from the Asia-Pacific Region. 
Most  patients  (91.4%)  in  study  ALXN1210-NMO-307  reported  AEs.  COVID-19  (24.1%),  headache 
(24.1%),  back  pain  (12.1%),  arthralgia  (10.3%),  and  urinary  tract  infection  (10.3%)  were  the  most 
frequently reported AEs (≥ 10% of patients). 
The majority of the events were of mild or moderate severity. Severe events were reported by 9 patients 
(15.5%)  treated  with  ravulizumab.  Severe  TEAEs  were  most  common  in  the  SOC  of  Infections  and 
infestations  (1  [1.7%]  patient  each  with  encephalitis  meningococcal,  intervertebral  discitis, 
meningococcal sepsis, pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infection), which is consistent with the 
mechanism of action of ravulizumab. 
Out of the 328 events that were reported, 38 (11.6%) in 44.8% of the patients were considered related 
to treatment. Related TEAEs were most common in the SOCs of Infections and infestations (15.5% of 
the patients) and Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (6.9%). Related TEAEs in the Infections 
and  infestations  SOC  included  cystitis,  urinary  tract infection,  and upper  respiratory  tract infection  (2 
[3.4%] patients each) and nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, encephalitis meningococcal, meningococcal sepsis, 
and  pneumonia  (1  [1.7%]  patient  each).  Related  TEAEs  in  the  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural 
complications SOC included 7 events of infusion related reaction in 4 (6.9%) patients. Related TEAEs in 
the Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC included 7 events of infusion related reaction in 
4 (6.9%) patients. The following adverse events were considered related to study drug in study ALXN-
1210-NMO-307 but have not been included as adverse drug reactions in the SmPC: cystitis, urinary tract 
infection (which was also one of the most common adverse events), sinusitis and pneumonia. The MAH 
provided  an  analysis  of  these  adverse  events  during  the  procedure,  showing  that  in  the  cases  of 
pneumonia,  cystitis  and  sinusitis,  the  patients  had  underlying  medical  conditions  that  may  have 
contributed to the events. However, no relevant medical history was reported for the two patients with 
urinary tract infections that were assessed as related to treatment. Considering the high frequency of 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 80/92 
 
  
 
 
urinary tract infections and the lack of justification for the two events related to ravulizumab, a causal 
possibility  between  ravulizumab  and  urinary  tract  infections  has  not  been  ruled  out  by  the  Applicant. 
Urinary tract infections have been included as an adverse drug reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
No additional safety issues were identified with prolonged and repeated administration of ravulizumab. 
Incidence of AEs decreased with repeated administration: 70.7% of patients reported AEs in the first 
6month treatment period compared to 50.0% of the patients in the > 24 to 30 months period. 
Overall, the AE profile of ravulizumab in NMOSD is consistent with that known for ravulizumab in other 
indications. 
There  were  no  deaths  in  Study  ALXN1210-NMO-307.  Eight  (13.8%)  patients  each  reported  a  single 
TESAE  during  the  study.  The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  those  related  to  infections.  Three 
(5.2%)  patients  reported  TESAEs  that  were  considered  related  to  study  drug,  including  encephalitis 
meningococcal,  meningococcal  sepsis,  and  pneumonia  (1  [1.7%]  patient  each).  The  overall  rate  of 
TESAEs did not increase with increased exposure to ravulizumab, and no TESAEs were reported in the 
ravulizumab group in the 21 patients treated beyond 18 months. 
The  main  risk  associated  to  ravulizumab  and  C5  inhibitors  in  general  is  an  increased  susceptibility to 
infections  caused  by  Neisseria  sp.,  especially  Neisseria  meningitidis.  Patients  are  required  to  be 
vaccinated  against  meningococcal  infections  (as  described  in  section  4.4  of  the  SmPC).  In  study 
ALXN1210-NMO-307, meningococcal infection was considered an adverse event of special interest. Two 
(3.4%)  patients  experienced  one  AE  of  special  interest  each  (meningococcal  sepsis  and  encephalitis 
meningococcal),  which  were  considered  serious.  The  two  patients  had  received  vaccines  against 
serogroups A, C, Y, W 135 and B. Both patients were treated promptly with antibiotics and recovered 
with no sequelae. One patient discontinued the study drug and study as a result of this event, and the 
other patient was continuing to receive ravulizumab in the study as of the data cut-off date. 
Twenty (34.5%) patients had 1 or more TEAEs identified as potential infusion reactions, which is similar 
to  the  rate  reported  in  patients  with  Myasthenia  Gravis  in  Study  ALXN1210-MG-306.  None  of  these 
events were serious, and none resulted in withdrawal of ravulizumab, although 4 (6.9%) patients had 
infusion reactions that lead to study drug interruption during 5 infusions. The total infusion volume was 
subsequently administered in each case. No patients experienced an anaphylactic reaction. 
A total of 15 (25.9%) patients with 16 adverse events indicating COVID-19 infection, positive test for 
SARS-CoV-2, and/or complications of COVID-19 infection were identified. No patients died of COVID-19 
during the study, and none of the TEAEs related to COVID-19 were serious or considered related to the 
study drug. All cases of COVID-19 resolved, including the 1 case of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. 
No  clinically  significant  changes  in  the  laboratory  results,  vital  signs,  physical  examinations,  and 
electrocardiograms were detected. 
Five  (8.6%)  patients  were  classified  as  having  pre-existing  immunoreactivity.  As  of  15  Jun  2022,  no 
treatment-emergent  ADA  response  or  treatment-boosted  ADA  response  was  observed  following 
ravulizumab treatment in patients with NMOSD and no NAb positive results were observed for any of the 
ravulizumab
treated  patients.  The  observed  pre-existing  immunoreactivity  in  the  5  patients  was 
associated with very low titers which were not boosted during the treatment or the extension period. 
This finding is consistent with the few treatment-emergent ADA responses in patients with PNH, aHUS, 
‑
or gMG treated with ravulizumab. Upon request, the Applicant provided an analysis of the safety profile 
of patients with pre-existing ADAs compared to the rest of the patients during the Primary Treatment 
Period of study ALXN1210-NMO-307, which did not suggest a different safety profile between patients 
with and without pre-existing ADA. Therefore, no impact of immunogenicity on ravulizumab safety was 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 81/92 
 
  
 
 
observed  in  any  of  the  patients  with  NMOSD  treated  with  ravulizumab  during  the  Primary  Treatment 
Period of study ALXN1210-NMO-307. 
Since only 7 elderly patients were enrolled in NMOSD program it is not possible to obtain any reliable 
conclusions on safety in this population.  
Regarding  the  safety  of  ravulizumab  in  children  and  adolescents,  a  phase  2/3,  open-label,  historical-
controlled, single-arm trial of ravulizumab in children and adolescents from 2 to less than 18 years of 
age  with  aquaporin-4  antibody  positive  NMOSD  (study  ALXN1210-NMO-317)  was  initiated  on  23  Jun 
2022. 
Overall,  one  (1.7%)  patient  experienced  3  TEAEs  (bronchitis,  encephalitis  meningococcal,  and 
stenotrophomonas infection) that resulted in withdrawal from the study drug. 
The postmarketing data do not seem to show any new safety concern. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety database of ravulizumab in the applied indication is considered limited both in terms of the 
number of exposed patients and the duration of the exposure. The small size of the safety database is 
not unexpected considering the rarity of the condition.  
Overall,  the  reported  safety  profile  of  ravulizumab  in  NMOSD  patients  appears  comparable  to  that 
observed in other indications. The most commonly reported adverse events with ravulizumab in study 
ALXN1210-NMO-307 were COVID-19, headache, back pain, arthralgia and urinary tract infection.  
Meningococcal infection is an important risk of ravulizumab related to its mechanism of action. Two cases 
of meningococcal infection were reported in Study ALXN1210-NMO-307. 
The Long-Term Extension Period of Study ALXN1210-NMO-307 is ongoing. The MAH should submit the 
results when available in order to complete the long-term safety assessment.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The Applicant submitted an updated RMP version with this application.  
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.0 is acceptable. The CHMP endorsed the 
Risk Management Plan version 7.0 with the following content. 
During  the  evaluation  of  this  procedure,  changes  in  the  RMP  were  requested  within  another  parallel 
procedure. In line with guidance on post-authorisation procedures, if the parallel applications reach the 
finalisation  stage  at  the  same  time,  the  consolidated  RMP  version  will  be  adopted  by  the  relevant 
Committee  and  will  become  the  approved  version  of  the  RMP.  Hence,  the  Applicant  did  submit  a 
consolidated RMP version 7.0.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The  new  proposed  indication  for  Ultomiris  (ravulizumab)  is  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with 
NMOSD who are AQP4 antibody-positive. 
NMOSD is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system characterized by attacks 
of optic neuritis, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, and less frequently, postrema syndrome, 
acute brainstem syndrome, acute diencephalic clinical syndrome or symptomatic cerebral syndrome.   
NMOSD  is  a  severe  condition,  which  results  in  early  and  permanent  neurological  disability.  Within  5 
years,  more  than  50%  of  patients  are  functionally  blind  or  have  lost  the  ability  to  ambulate  without 
assistance. Mortality rates are high, most frequently secondary to neurogenic respiratory failure, which 
occurs with extension of cervical lesions into the brainstem or from primary brainstem lesions20,21. 
The AQP4 serum autoantibody is a specific biomarker for NMOSD, although 10-27% of patients with a 
clinical diagnosis of NMOSD are seronegative for AQP-4-IgG22. 
In  NMOSD  patients,  any  relapse  can  result  in  the  accumulation  of  neurological  disability,  including 
blindness  and  paralysis,  which  highlights  the  immediate  need  for  immunotherapies  that  effectively 
prevent NMOSD relapses. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Disability is attack related and the early treatment of the relapses together with prevention of further 
episodes is essential for reducing progressive accumulation of neurologic disability. Acute episodes are 
generally  treated  with  high-dose  intravenous  glucocorticoids  and  therapeutic  plasma  exchange  in 
patients with severe symptoms, unresponsive to glucocorticoids. Regarding the prevention of relapses, 
patients  with  NMOSD  have  been  treated  with  off-label  immunosuppressive  therapies,  such  as 
azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, prednisolone or rituximab. Three monoclonal antibodies have been 
approved  by  the  EMA  since  2019  for  the  treatment  of  NMOSD  in  adult  patients  who  are  anti-AQP4 
antibody-positive:  eculizumab,  inebilizumab,  and  satralizumab,  targeting  different  components  of  the 
immune  system,  with  the  aim  of  preventing  NMOSD  relapses.  No  direct  comparison  has  been  made 
between these three monoclonal antibodies. 
Ravulizumab was structurally derived from eculizumab and they share the same mechanism of action. 
As  a  result  of  the  differences  in  molecular  features,  the  serum  elimination  half-life  of  ravulizumab  is 
longer than that of eculizumab, enabling an extended dosing interval of every 8 weeks as compared to 
a dosing interval of every 2 weeks with eculizumab.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The submission of ravulizumab for the treatment of NMOSD is based on one single pivotal trial: Study 
ALXN1210-NMO-307: A phase 3 randomized, external placebo-controlled, open-label, multicenter study 
(still ongoing). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
No patients in the ravulizumab group had an adjudicated On-trial Relapse during the 73.5 mean weeks 
of  duration.  In  the  external  placebo  control  a  total  of  20  relapses  were  adjudicated  by  the  external 
adjudication committee during 36 weeks. The primary endpoint was met. The hazard ratio (95% CI) for 
ravulizumab compared with placebo was 0.014 (0.000, 0.103), representing a 98.6% reduction in the 
risk of relapse. All patients on ravulizumab were relapse-free at the end of the Primary Treatment Period 
(versus 63.2% in placebo-treated patients).  
The adjudicated ARR (95% CI) was 0.0 (NA, 0.044) in the ravulizumab group.  
As for the neurological functioning, clinically important worsening from baseline measured by HAI score 
was reported for 2 (3.4%) patients in the ravulizumab group compared to 11 (23.4%) patients in the 
placebo group. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The main concerns with the submitted data package relate to the uncontrolled open label nature of the 
pivotal  study,  the  (lack  of/limited)  comparability  of  the  two  non-contemporary  groups  used  for  the 
primary  estimation  of  ravulizumab  efficacy  (i.e.  study  ALXN1210-NMO-307  was  conducted  between 
December 2019 and March 2022 while study ECU-NMO-301 was conducted between 2014 and 2018) 
and the intrinsic differences between a group of patients prospectively studied (ravulizumab group) and 
a retrospectively selected placebo group, without the protection from bias of randomisation. 
Indeed, differences with respect to baseline disease status and in exposure were shown between patients 
treated in the external placebo arm and those included in the ravulizumab group. Overall, patients in 
study ECU-NMO-301 showed more disability, higher disease activity, more had been previously treated, 
and the percentage of patients who were on treatment during the study was also higher. In terms of 
exposure the external placebo group was followed for a shorter period of time.  
From  a  methodological  point  of  view,  the  use  of  the  placebo  group  from  study  ECU-NMO-301  as  an 
external control for study ALXN1210-NMO-307, for the primary estimation of ravulizumab efficacy is of 
concern. 
A  total  of  55  patients  were  enrolled,  which  is  a  limited  number  of  patients  integrating  an  efficacy 
database.  
The clinical (secondary) endpoints are mainly related with disability. In NMOSD, disability is driven by 
uncomplete recovery from relapses. As no relapses were observed in the ravulizumab arm no relevant 
improvement was observed in visual and motor function secondary endpoints. This is also the case for 
QoL where no relevant changes are expected with respect to baseline except for the safety profile of 
ravulizumab. In any case, the interpretation of any change is challenging in these circumstances, given 
the absence of a concomitant comparator, the limited number of patients treated and the differences in 
exposure between the active treatment and the external placebo.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
AEs considered related to the study drug were reported in 44.8% of the patients. Related TEAEs were 
most common in the SOCs of Infections and infestations (including cystitis, urinary tract infection, upper 
respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, encephalitis meningococcal, meningococcal sepsis, 
and  pneumonia)  and  Injury,  poisoning  and  procedural  complications  (7  events  of  infusion  related 
reaction). 
There were no deaths in study ALXN1210-NMO-307. SAEs were reported in 13.8% of the patients during 
the study. The most frequently reported SAEs were those related to infections. Three (5.2%) patients 
reported  TESAEs  that  were  considered  related  to  study  drug,  including  encephalitis  meningococcal, 
meningococcal sepsis, and pneumonia. Two (3.4%) patients experienced one AE of special interest each 
(meningococcal sepsis and encephalitis meningococcal), which were considered serious. Both patients 
were treated promptly with antibiotics and recovered with no sequelae. 
Overall, the safety profile of ravulizumab in this indication is related to its mechanism of action 
(inhibition of terminal complement activity) and is consistent with that known for ravulizumab in other 
indications 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Since only 7 elderly patients were enrolled in study ALXN1210-NMO-307 it is not possible to obtain any 
reliable safety conclusion in this population.  
Given  the  low  prevalence of  NMOSD,  drug  exposure  can  be  considered  acceptable  for  the  short-term 
safety assessment of ravulizumab.  As for the long-term safety profile, the safety database is too limited 
(n=58) to allow to draw any conclusion, but no additional safety issues were identified as of the cut-off 
date of 15 Jul 2022 and the extension study is ongoing.   
With  regard  to  immunogenicity,  no  treatment-emergent  ADA  responses  were  observed  in  NMOSD 
patients treated with ravulizumab and no impact on ravulizumab PK, PD, safety or efficacy was observed 
in any of the patients with NMOSD treated with ravulizumab.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
No patients in the ravulizumab group had an adjudicated On-trial Relapse. The main concern was that 
the  results  come  from  a  single  arm trial. In order to  reduce  the potential  bias  derived  from the  non-
randomised  design  of  study  ALXN1210-NMO-307,  the  Applicant  implemented  a  number  of  measures. 
These  include  the  comparison  with  an  external  placebo  arm  (where  a  total  of  20  relapses  were 
adjudicated),  the  evaluation  of  the  primary  event  by  an  external  adjudication  committee,  the  similar 
design, outcomes and procedures to those followed in study ECU-NMO-301, the detection of potential 
cases of relapses and the additional statistical measures including sensitivity analyses. Overall, it is felt 
that  these  measures  provide  certain  reassurance  even  if  they  do  not  fully  address  the 
uncertainties/concerns inherent to the uncontrolled design of the study. 
The safety database of ravulizumab in the proposed indication is considered limited both in terms of the 
number of exposed patients and the duration of the exposure. Given the low prevalence of NMOSD, drug 
exposure  can  be  considered  acceptable  for  the  short-term  safety  assessment  of  ravulizumab  in  this 
indication.  In  addition,  the  available  safety  information  of  ravulizumab  in  the  already  authorised 
indications (PNH, aHUS, gMG) can be taken as supportive, considering that the dosing regimen is the 
same  regardless  of  the  indication.  Overall,  the  reported  AE  profile  is  consistent  with  that  known  for 
EMA/182657/2023  
Page 90/92 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ravulizumab in other indications, with no unexpected findings. The updated analysis of study ALXN1210-
NMO-307  (data  cut-off  date  15  Jul  2022)  includes  data  from  56  ravulizumab-treated  patients  with  a 
median study duration of 90.93 weeks. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Results from a single pivotal open label study (ALXN1210-NMO-307) have been provided to support this 
application. An external placebo control (instead of a concurrent control arm) has therefore been used 
for interpretation of the data, that diminishes the strength of the efficacy results presented. Even if the 
particularities  of  both  the  disease  and  the  drug  are  acknowledged,  the  risk  of  overestimation  of  the 
treatment effect cannot be ruled out in an uncontrolled open label study. The Applicant explained the 
measures implemented during the study to reduce the potential bias and provided additional sensitivity 
analyses. These efforts are acknowledged and although the uncertainties are not fully addressed there 
is sufficient evidence to confirm the effect of ravulizumab in the intended indication. 
The observed safety profile of ravulizumab in this indication does not raise any unexpected concerns and 
it is consistent with that known for ravulizumab in other indications. However, conclusions are based on 
a very limited safety database, both in terms of number of exposed patients and long-term exposure.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignant disorder of the plasma cells, characterized by uncontrolled and 
progressive proliferation of a plasma cell clone. The median age of patients at diagnosis is 65 years. The 
abnormal plasma cell proliferation accumulate in  the bone marrow, displacing the normal hematopoietic 
tissue. The plasma cells produce a monoclonal antibody, paraprotein (M-protein and free-light chain), which 
is an immunoglobulin (Ig) or a fragment of one that has lost its function (Kyle 2009, Palumbo 2011). The 
normal  immunoglobulins  (Ig)  are  compromised  leading  to  increased  susceptibility  to  infections.  Other 
important characteristics include dysfunction in normal hematopoietic tissue and destruction of the normal 
bone marrow architecture due to proliferation of multiple myeloma cells. This is reflected by clinical findings 
such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, myelosuppression, paraprotein in serum or urine, and bone resorption 
seen as diffuse osteoporosis or lytic lesions shown in radiographs (Kyle 2003). Furthermore, hypercalcemia, 
renal  insufficiency  or  failure,  and  neurological  complications  are  frequently  seen  (Palumbo  2011).  At 
diagnosis,  frequent  and  pronounced  symptoms  impacting  health-related  quality  of  life  typically  include 
anemia  (approximately  73%),  renal  insufficiency  (approximately  30%)  and  skeletal  destruction 
(approximately 80%) (Sonneveld 2013).  
For relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, the treatment is determined on an individual basis where the 
patient’s age, prior therapy, bone marrow function, co-morbidities, patient preference and time to relapse 
are taken into account. Current treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma 
include  combination  chemotherapy,  proteasome  inhibitors  (PIs;  eg,  bortezomib,  carfilzomib,  ixazomib), 
immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs; eg, thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide), histone deacetylase 
inhibitors (eg, panobinostat); monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (eg, daratumumab and elotuzumab), high-dose 
chemotherapy, and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).  
Daratumumab is an IgG1κ human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the CD38 protein expressed at 
a high level on the surface of multiple myeloma tumour cells, as well as other cell types and tissues at 
various  levels.  CD38  protein  has  multiple  functions  such  as  receptor  mediated  adhesion,  signalling  and 
enzymatic activity (SmPC, section 5.1). 
The initial marketing authorisation application for Darzalex was based on data from 2 single agent studies 
(MMY2002 and GEN501) and the European Commission issued a conditional marketing for Darzalex on 20 
May 2016 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior 
therapy  included  a  Proteasome  Inhibitor  (PI)  and  an  immunomodulatory  agent  (IMiD)  and  who 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy with the following conditions: 
• 
In order to address the uncertainties related to the single arm design of the pivotal study supporting 
the approval of Darzalex, the MAH should submit the results of study MMY3003, a phase III randomised 
study  investigating  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone  with  or  without  daratumumab  in  patients  with 
previously treated multiple myeloma. 
• 
In order to address the uncertainties related to the single arm design of the pivotal study supporting 
the approval of Darzalex, the MAH should submit the results of study MMY3004, a phase III randomised 
study  investigating  bortezomib  and  dexamethasone  with  or  without  daratumumab  in  patients  with 
previously treated multiple myeloma. 
The MAH submitted the clinical study reports for MMY3003 and MMY3004 as part of this application. 
The current indication for Darzalex is as follows: 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 8/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Darzalex as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent 
and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy (SmPC, section 4.1). 
The MAH applied for the following extension of indication: Darzalex is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.  
The recommended indication for approval by CHMP after considering all data submitted is: Darzalex is 
indicated in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the 
treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy (SmPC, 
section 4.1).  
The recommended dose is Darzalex 16 mg/kg body weight administered as an intravenous infusion (SmPC, 
section 4.2). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.2.2.  Discussion and Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The justification provided by the MAH for not performing environmental risk assessment studies was 
considered acceptable since daratumumab is a protein therefore, unlikely to result in significant risk to the 
environment. This is in accordance with the “Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 21*). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction

Total Subjects Evaluable for Pharmacokinetic Analysis/Total Subjects Treated: 680/704. 
All daratumumab PK parameters were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods using 
actual times of blood sampling. Background therapy PK parameters, including bortezomib, thalidomide, and 
pomalidomide were calculated using conventional non-compartmental methods using nominal times of 
blood sampling. 
Values presented in the tables represent arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of 
variation (%CV); tmax values are presented as median (range). 
Absorption 
Absorption data are not required since all studies administered daratumumab as an IV infusion. 
Distribution 
In Study GEN503 (combination therapy), mean volume of distribution (Vd) for the 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg 
cohorts was estimated as 100.83 mL/kg and 88.35 mL/kg, respectively compared to 90.19±43.40 mL/kg 
after the first dose and 59.51±54.68 mL/kg following repeat dosing of 16 mg/kg in Study GEN501 
(monotherapy). There was no data for the 16 mg/kg dose group. Overall, results showed that daratumumab 
is primarily localised to the vascular system with limited extravascular tissue distribution. 
Elimination 
By  the  initial  assessment  for  the  monotherapy  indication,  the  elimination  halftime  (T½)  increased  with 
multiple doses: from 25.62±5.61 hours for 2 mg/kg to 154.65±36.48 hours for 24 mg/kg. In the 16 mg/kg 
group, mean T½ increased from 109.9±42.05 hours after the first full infusion to 586.56±486.89 hours after 
the seventh (last) full infusion (Study GEN501, Part 1). 
Regarding the elimination in the combination treatment, PK data from Study GEN503 showed that after the 
first full infusion mean T½ was estimated to be 37.92 hours for the 2 mg/kg cohort and 46.80 hours for the 
4  mg/kg  group.  Daratumumab  elimination  showed  nonlinear  characteristics;  Cmax  after  the  first  full 
infusion increased with dose while AUClast increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality 
Only in Study GEN503, other doses than the recommended 16 mg/kg dosing regimen was used. Data for 
doses 2 mg/kg – 8 mg/kg is available for a total of 10 patients. In Phase 1 of Study GEN503, Cmax increased 
in approximate proportion to the daratumumab dose in the range of 2-16 mg/kg after the first full infusion. 
The observed mean Cmax after the first full dose rose in a ratio of 1: 2: 6: 11 as the dose increased in a ratio 
of 1: 2: 4: 8. Mean daratumumab serum concentrations (μg/mL) for the first full infusion for the different 
doses are presented in Figure 2.

Keys: C=cycle; D=day; H=hour; W=week; EOI=end ofinfusion; PK=pharmacokinetics.  
The error bars are mean +/- standard error. 
Time dependencies 
Data is available from Study GEN503 (combination therapy). Accumulation appeared to continue throughout 
the first 2 cycles of weekly dosing in both Phase 1 and 2, after which concentrations began to decrease 
slightly with the less frequent daratumumab administration (Table 3). In the 16 mg/kg cohort (Phase 2), the 
mean±SD trough concentration at the end of weekly dosing (Cycle 3 Day 1 pre-dose) was 546.65±226.34 
μg/mL. The mean±SD concentration at the end of the ninth planned full infusion (Cycle 3 Day 1 pre-dose; 
898.53±242.27 μg/mL) was approximately 3-fold higher than the mean concentration following the first full 
infusion (Cycle 1 Day 1 post-dose; 289.11±90.39 μg/mL).

Table 2: Summary of daratumumab select serum predose and end of infusion concentrations; 
evaluable for daratumumab PK (Study GEN503 Phase 2) 
a Subjects who treated with daratumumab and had at least one post-treatment PK assessment. Only 19 of these 
subjects are evaluable for PK parameter estimates. 
Note: Samples outside of allowed sampling windows are not included. In addition, samples collected after an incomplete 
dose 
(less than 80% intended dose was administered) and prior to the next complete dose are not 
included. Keys: Dara=daratumumab, Len/Dex=lenalidomide/dexamethasone. 
In general, the area under the curve to the last quantifiable time point (AUClast) increased in a greater than 
dose-proportional manner after the first doses. Observed mean AUClast after the first full dose rose in a ratio 
of 1 : 3 : 7 : 43 as the dose increased in a ratio of 1 : 2 : 4 : 8. The results obtained in Study GEN503 were 
supported by the results obtained in Study MMY1001.  
Similar results were observed in the two Phase 3 studies MMY3003 and MMY3004. In Study MMY3003, the 
mean±SD Cmax concentration after the 1st dose (Cycle 1 Day 1 post-infusion) was 329.07±95.89 μg/mL. 
Accumulation  of  daratumumab  through  the  first  9  doses  resulted  in  a  2.9-fold  increase  in  Cmax  to 
972.12±272.35  μg/mL  at  Cycle  3  Day  1  post-dose.  The  mean±SD  Cycle  3  Day  1  pre-dose  trough 
concentration after 8 weekly doses was 607.73±231.98 μg/mL. In Study MMY3004, the mean±SD Cmax 
concentration after the 1st dose (Cycle 1 Day 1 post-infusion) was 317.68±98.87 μg/mL. Accumulation of 
daratumumab continued through at least the first 7 weekly doses (the last PK sampling time point in weekly

Cycle 3 Day 1 post-dose. The mean±SD Cycle 3 Day 1 pre-dose trough concentration after 6 weekly doses

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
In subjects treated with combination therapy, 2  (0.7%) of the 298 evaluable subjects were positive for 
anti-daratumumab antibodies (ADAs) (1 subject each in Studies MMY1001 and MMY3003).  Both positive 
subjects  demonstrated  low  titer  (1:20)  responses  which  were  near  the  lower  limit  of  the  assay  method 
sensitivity. 
In Study MMY3003, the positive status was assigned to 1 subject due to the detection of ADAs following an 
IRR at Cycle 1 Day 1. The ADA positive sample inhibited daratumumab binding in the validated neutralising 
antibody assay; thus, the response was classified as neutralising. The pre-dose Cycle 1 Day 1 and the end 
of treatment (follow up Week 4) samples were both negative for ADAs, demonstrating that the immune 
response was transient. Despite the single positive ADA response, this subject demonstrated a stringent 
complete response (sCR) on Day 139, suggesting no impact of observed ADAs on efficacy, but the patient 
discontinued treatment on Day 302 due to disease progression.  
In Study MMY1001, 1 subject in the DVTd cohort was positive for ADAs at the Week 9 Follow-Up visit; the 
antibodies were non-neutralising. This subject was negative for ADAs on 2 other visits (pre-dose on Cycle 1 
Day 1 and Week 3 Follow-up) and was on treatment for 4 cycles. This subject was not evaluable for drug 
response per protocol and discontinued due to autologous stem cell transplantation. There was no notable 
safety signals observed in this subject. 
The  evaluation  of  QTc  intervals  versus  serum  concentration  of  daratumumab  has  been  provided  in  the 
monotherapy submission. There are no new data to be summarised. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The population pharmacokinetic (pop-PK) analysis was based on 4,426 PK samples from 694 subjects (684 
subjects  received  daratumumab  at  16  mg/kg).  Nine  subjects  were  excluded  because  they  had  no 
measurable post-dose concentrations of daratumumab. One subject was excluded because the actual dosing 
time of the first dose was missing. 
As expected, the PK of daratumumab was similar following the monotherapy and combination therapies. The 
observed concentration-time data of daratumumab were adequately described by a 2-compartment Pop-PK 
model with parallel linear and nonlinear Michaelis-Menten eliminations. The model was parameterised in 
terms  of  total  systemic  clearance  (CL),  volume  of  distribution  in  the  central  compartment  (V1), 
inter-compartmental clearance (Q), volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment (V2), maximum 
rate  of  the  saturable  target-mediated  drug  disposition  (TMDD)  elimination  process  (Vmax),  and 
daratumumab concentration (Km) associated with half of Vmax. 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 14/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The  estimated  CL  value  was  similar  to  the  clearance  of  non-specific  endogenous  IgG  reported  in  the 
literature and the estimated V1 value approached plasma volume. The model-derived half-life associated 
with linear elimination was approximately 23.3±11.8 days (mean±standard deviation), comparable to the 
half-life (18±9 days) derived from the monotherapy data. Similar to what was observed in monotherapy 
studies, apparent steady state seems to be reached approximately 5 months into the Q4W dosing period. 
The ratio of the steady-state peak concentration after Q4W dosing and the peak concentration after the first 
dose was 1.85±0.67 (mean±standard deviation). 
Effects of Covariates 
A  forest  plot  was  constructed  to  compare  the  exposure  (maximal  pre-infusion  concentration)  of 
daratumumab in subgroups defined by specific covariates (Figure 3).

Key:  Solid  blue  circle  represents  mean  and  error  bar  represents  95%  confidence  interval.  Dashed  line  represents 
reference value of 1. Numbers represent ratio, confidence interval, and number of subjects in the comparison groups. 
Gray shaded region represents ±25% from reference value. 
Note: Analyses assumed that all subjects in Studies GEN503, MMY1001, MMY3003 andMMY3004 received 16 mg/kg QW 
for  8  weeks  (8  doses),  Q2W  for  16  weeks  (8  doses),  and  then  Q4W  thereafter.  Maximal  pre-infusion  (trough) 
concentration was derived as the pre-infusion concentration of the 1st dose of the every 2 week dosing period. 
The number of subjects in the reference group for each covariate: normal renal function (N=251); normal 
hepatic  function  (N=598);  age  <65  yr  (N=352);  age  <75  yr  (N=630);  female  (N=291);  non-white 
(N=136);  western  European  N.  America  (N=590);  body  weight  >88  kg  (N=164);  normal  albumin 
concentration (N=513); Phase 2 product (N=44); 1 prior line of therapy (N=282); not refractory (N=42); 
ECOG  =  0  (N=309);  RD  (N=326);  non-IgG  myeloma  (N=293).Body  Weight:  When  daratumumab  was 
administered  on  a  mg/kg  basis,  no  clinically  important  differences  (ie,  <20%)  in  the  exposure  to 
daratumumab were observed in subjects with different weight despite a numeric trend. The CL and V1 of 
daratumumab significantly increased with increasing body weight. The difference in exposure had minimum 
impact on target saturation. 
Age: Similar to monotherapy, no clinically important influence of age on the exposure to daratumumab was 
observed  in  the  population  PK  analyses  in  patients  receiving  combination  therapies.  The  difference  in 
exposure was within 6% between younger (age < 65 years, n = 352; or age < 75 years, n = 630) and older 
subjects (age ≥ 65 years, n = 342; or age ≥ 75 years, n = 64) (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Sex: No clinically important influence of sex on the exposure to daratumumab was observed. The difference 
in  exposure  was  approximately  4%  between  males  (n=403)  and  females  (n=291)  although  V1  of 
daratumumab in female subjects was 15% lower than that of male subjects. 
Race: In the population PK analysis in multiple myeloma patients that received daratumumab with various 
combination therapies, the exposure to daratumumab was also similar between white (n = 558) and non 
white (n = 136) subjects (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Region: The majority (85%) of subjects were Western European (EU), United States (US), or Canadian (CA) 
subjects  (EU+US+CA).  The  effect  of  region  was  evaluated  in  western  EU+US+CA  (n=590)  and  Other 
(n=104). The exposures were virtually identical in western EU+US+CA subjects and subjects from other 
regions as the difference was approximately 3%. 
Renal  Impairment:  Additional  population  PK  analyses  in  patients  receiving  combination  treatments  also 
showed  no  clinically  important  differences  in  exposure  to  daratumumab  between  patients  with  renal 
impairment (mild, n = 264; moderate, n = 166; severe, n = 12) and those with normal renal function (n = 
251) (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Hepatic  Impairment:  The  PK  analysis  of  patients  with  multiple  myeloma  that  received  daratumumab  in 
various combination therapies included 598 patients with normal hepatic function, 83 patients with mild 
hepatic impairment and 5 patients with moderate (TB > 1.5 x to 3.0 x ULN), or severe (TB > 3.0 x ULN) 
hepatic  impairment.  No  clinically  important  differences  in  the  exposure  to  daratumumab  were  observed 
between patients with hepatic impairment and those with normal hepatic function (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Baseline  Albumin:  No  clinically  important  differences  in  the  exposure  to  daratumumab  were  observed 
between  subjects  with  abnormal  albumin  and  those  with  normal  albumin  level.  The  exposure  to 
daratumumab was 21% lower in subjects with abnormal albumin level (<35 g/L; n=181) compared with 
subjects who had normal albumin level (≥35 g/L; n=513). The difference in exposure had minimum impact 
on target saturation  
Type  of  Myeloma:  No  clinically  important  differences  in  the  exposure  to  daratumumab  were  observed 
between subjects with baseline IgG myeloma and non-IgG myeloma. The exposure to daratumumab was 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 16/105 
 
  
  
 
 
approximately 23% lower in the IgG multiple myeloma subjects (n=401) compared to the non-IgG subjects 
(n=293). The difference in exposure had minimum impact on target saturation and the treatment effect on 
efficacy endpoints was similar for subjects with IgG and non-IgG myeloma. 
Immunogenicity:  Across all included studies, 2 out of 298 immunogenicity evaluable subjects (1 each in 
Study MMY1001 and Study MMY3003) in the pop-PK analysis were positive for ADA to daratumumab. No 
discernible differences in the PK between subjects with and without ADAs could be identified.  
ECOG Score:  No clinically important differences in the exposure to daratumumab (≤5%) were observed 
between subjects with ECOG scores of 1 (N=345) or 2 (N=39) and those with ECOG scores of 0 (N=309). 
Refractory  Status:  No  clinically  important  differences  in  the  exposure  to  daratumumab  (˂10%)  were 
observed between subjects refractory to IMiD only (N=103), PI only (N=73), or both (N=89) and those who 
were not refractory (N=42). 
Other Baseline Variables: The effects of baseline disease status such as number of prior lines of therapy and 
various  therapies  in  combination  with  daratumumab  treatment  were  evaluated  on  the  exposures  to 
daratumumab. The daratumumab exposures were similar across the subgroups of these variables. 
Exploratory Exposure-Response Relationships 
The  relative  hazard  for  disease  progression  and  death  decreased  rapidly  with  increasing  daratumumab 
exposure based on the data from Studies MMY3003, MMY3004, and MMY1001 (DPd patients) (Figure 4).  
Figure  4:  Relative  Hazard  of  Progression-free  Survival  at  Different  Predicted  Maximal  Trough 
Concentration 
Key: the solid red line is the point estimate; the grey shaded areas represent the 95% confidence interval. The blue 
vertical dotted lines separate the quartiles of maximal pre-infusion concentration. Minimum Cpre-infusion,max for each 
study  was  used  as  the  reference  level.  Cpre-infusion,max  up  to  the  8th  weekly  dose  for  Studies  MMY1001  (DPd), 
MMY3003, and MMY3004. 
When maximal trough concentration was greater than ~250 μg/mL, the decreasing trend of relative hazards 
appears to slow down, suggesting limited additional benefit at higher concentrations. As the majority of the 
patients (>90% in Studies MMY3003 and MMY3004, and >80% in Study MMY1001) had maximal trough 
concentration greater than 250 μg/mL, it indicated that maximum clinical benefit on PFS has been attained 
for most subjects treated with 16 mg/kg. This observation was consistent with the

grade)  appeared  to  increase  with  drug  exposure,  this  trend  was  not  observed  for  Grade  3  or  higher 
infections. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of daratumumab used as monotherapy is well established. Clinical pharmacology 
data for the combination treatment derive from four clinical studies with a total of 680 patients evaluable for 
PK analyses. Additional, a pop-PK analysis contributed with data. The applied analytical methods for both the 
PK data analysis and the statistical analysis are appropriate.  
The PK findings (bioavailability, volume of distribution and T½) from Study GEN503 are in line with the 
findings from the PK results from the mono-therapy studies (Study GEN501). The results support the 
expectations that as a mAb, the distribution of daratumumab is primarily localised to the vascular system, 
and the elimination is expected to occur via degradation of the daratumumab molecule into small peptides 
and amino acids. Overall, there were no unexpected findings with regards to absorption, distribution or 
elimination. The dose-dependent elimination (nonlinear characteristics) is consistent with target-mediated 
elimination (where clearance decreases as a function of dose).   
No pharmacokinetic interactions are expected and it is acceptable that no formal drug-drug interaction 
studies have been performed. Serum concentrations of daratumumab as well as bortezomib, pomalidomide 
and thalidomide in various combination therapies show that there are no PK interactions for any of the 
products.  
There is only very sparse PK data (from 10 patients) with regards to other doses than the 16 mg/kg 
daratumumab used in combination therapy. As treatment with 16 mg/kg is the recommended dose for 
monotherapy and is also proposed to be used in the combination treatment, more data with lower (or 
higher) dosing regimen is not considered necessary and thus, it is acceptable that there is only very limited 
experience with other doses and limited data regarding dose proportionality. Dose proportionality as 
observed in monotherapy is also expected to apply for combination therapy. 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 18/105 
 
  
  
 
 
Results over time showed consistent results across the four studies and furthermore, in study MMY1001 
where different combination treatments were used, consistent results were observed across the different 
combination therapies. As expected, the AUC last increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner 
after the first doses. Accumulation continued throughout the first 2 cycles due to the frequent dosing, 
thereafter concentrations began to decrease slightly with the less frequent daratumumab administration.  
An additional population PK analysis was conducted in patients with multiple myeloma that received 
daratumumab in various combination therapies from four clinical trials (694 patients of which 684 received 
daratumumab at 16 mg/kg). Daratumumab concentration-time profiles were similar following the 
monotherapy and combination therapies. The mean (SD) estimated terminal half-life associated with linear 
clearance in combination therapy was approximately 23 (12) days (SmPC, section 5.2). 
Several covariates were investigated in the pop-PK analysis. Consistent with the results from the initial 
(monotherapy) pop-PK analysis, results from the present pop-PK analysis showed that albumin level, type of 
myeloma and body weight were the covariates with the highest impact on the PK values. However, when 
further evaluated, it is concluded that though a few numeric and statistically significant differences were 
observed for a few covariates, these observation were in line with the observations from the monotherapy 
pop-PK analysis and more importantly, the differences are not expected to be of clinical relevance. No 
dose-adjustments are necessary.  
A logistic regression analysis of overall response rate and predicted maximal pre-infusion (trough) 
daratumumab concentration showed that a lower dose than 16 mg/kg is not expected to be able to obtain a 
sufficient response in the majority of patients even when daratumumab is given as combination-therapy. 
From a clinical pharmacological point of view, it is acknowledged that the proposed dose of 16 mg/kg is a 
suitable daratumumab dose also when used in combination-therapy. 
With regards to the pharmacodynamics, no new data related to mechanism of action or QTc evaluation is 
presented. This is overall acceptable. There is no formal experience regarding potential worsening of cardiac 
adverse when daratumumab is given in combination treatment (PD interaction), but as described in the 
clinical safety part of the assessment report, no increase in cardiac adverse events were observed, and the 
issue will not be pursued from a clinical pharmacological point of view.   
Across the studies, two patients developed anti-daratumumab antibodies; in one of the patients, the 
antibodies were neutralising but transient. The MAH has provided sufficient information regarding the two 
patients. It is agreed that the immunogenicity profile of daratumumab still appears to be low. 
Immunogenicity is already included as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  clinical  pharmacology  is  sufficiently  covered  with  PK  data  from  four  clinical  studies  and  a  pop-PK 
analysis.  All  results  from  the  combination  therapy  are  in  line  with  the  results  obtained  by  the  initial 
application  for  daratumumab  used  as  monotherapy.  From  a  clinical  pharmacology  point  of  view,  no 
unexpected findings have been revealed and no concerns were identified.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.    Dose response study 
No dose-response studies were submitted. In the study GEN503, 16 mg/kg daratumumab was established 
as the optimal dose for administration of daratumumab as monotherapy (see 2.3.5 section discussion on 
clinical pharmacology).   
2.4.2.  Main studies 
• 
Study MMY3003 was a phase 3 open-label, multicentre study comparing the efficacy of 
daratumumab when combined with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (DRd) with lenalidomide and 
low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
• 
Study MMY3004 was a phase 3, open-label, multicentre study comparing the efficacy of 
daratumumab when combined with bortezomib and low-dose dexamethasone (DVd) with bortezomib and 
low-dose dexamethasone (Vd) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
The MMY3003 and the MMY3004 studies are very similar in the study design. The methods part as well as the

Objectives (MMY3003/MMY3004) 
The primary objective of the MMY3003 study was to compare the efficacy of daratumumab when combined 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) to that of lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd), in terms of 
progression-free survival(PFS) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.  
The primary objective of the MMY3004 study was to compare the efficacy of daratumumab when combined 
with bortezomib (velcade) and dexamethasone (DVd) to that of bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd), in 
terms of PFS in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
The major secondary objectives were to compare the 2 treatment groups with respect to: 


Outcomes/endpoints (MMY3003/MMY3004) 
The primary efficacy endpoint, PFS, was defined as the duration from the date of randomization to either 
progressive disease, according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, or death, 
whichever occurred first.   
The secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
• 
Time to disease progression (TTP), defined as the time between the date of randomization and the 
date of first documented evidence of confirmed progressive disease (PD), as defined in the IMWG criteria, or 
death due to PD, whichever occurred first. 
• 
Response rate of VGPR or better, defined as the proportion of subjects with a response of VGPR or 
better (ie, VGPR, CR, or sCR) according to the IMWG criteria during or after the study treatment. 
• 
Minimal residual disease (MRD) negative rate, defined as the proportion of subjects with negative 
MRD at any timepoint after the first dose by bone marrow aspirate or whole blood. 
• 
Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved a partial response 
(PR) or better (ie, PR, very good partial response (VGPR), complete response (CR), or stringent complete 
response (sCR)), according to the IMWG criteria, during or after the study treatment. 
• 
Overall survival (OS), measured from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any 
cause. 
• 
Time to response (TTR), defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first efficacy 
evaluation that the subject met all criteria for PR or better. 
• 
Duration of response (DOR), defined for subjects with a confirmed response (PR or better) as the 
time between first documentation of response and disease progression, according to IMWG response 
criteria, or death due to PD, whichever occurs first.

The total sample size needed for the study was approximately 560 subjects (280 per treatment group). It 
was assumed, that DRd could reduce the risk of disease progression or death by 30%, ie, assuming the HR 
(DRd  vs.  Rd)  of  0.70.  Analysis  of  the  primary  endpoint  PFS  was  planned  to  be  performed  when 
approximately  295  PFS  events  had  occurred  to  achieve  a  power  of  85%  to  detect  a  HR  of  0.70  with  a 
log-rank test (two-sided alpha being 0.05).  Long-term survival follow-up was to continue until 330 deaths 
had been observed. 
Study MMY3004 
Approximately 480 subjects (240 per group) were to be randomized in the study. The sample size was based 
on the hypothesis of a 30% reduction in the risk of either progression or death. A total of 295 PFS events 
would provide a power of 85% to detect a reduction of 30% in the risk of either progression or death (HR 
[DVd vs Vd] of 0.70) with a log-rank test, assuming a two-sided significance level of 5%. A 16-month accrual 
period and an additional 10-month follow-up were assumed. Long-term survival follow-up was to continue 
until 320 deaths (ie. 2/3 of the randomized subjects) had been observed. 
For both the MMY3003 and the MMY3004 studies, the sample size calculation took into consideration an 
annual dropout rate of 5%.   
Randomisation  
In both studies, subjects were randomly assigned by an interactive web response system (IWRS) to 1 of 2 
treatment groups based on a computer-generated randomization schedule. The randomization was 
stratified by ISS at screening (I, II, or III), number of prior lines of therapy (1 vs. 2 or 3 vs. >3) and prior 
lenalidomide/bortezomib treatment (no vs. yes).  
Blinding (masking) 
Both studies were open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods for key efficacy endpoints is provided in below Table: 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 26/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Table 4 Statistical method for key efficacy endpoints (study MMY3003) 
For both the MMY3003 and the MMY3004 studies, the analyses of efficacy endpoints were conducted on the 
ITT population, defined as subjects who have been randomised: PFS, TTP, MRD, OS, time to subsequent 
therapy, demographics and baseline characteristic.  
Response-evaluable patients were defined as subjects who had a confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma 
and measurable disease at baseline or screening visit. In addition, subjects must have received at least 1 
administration of study treatment and have at least 1 post baseline disease assessment. Analyses of major 
secondary endpoints of ORR, rate of VGPR or better, and duration of and time to response are based on this 
population.  
The per-protocol population was defined as subjects who are randomized and have no major protocol 
deviations due to not meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
The safety population was defined as subjects who have received at least 1 administration of any study 
treatment (partial or complete). This population is used for all safety analyses. The safety analysis grouping 
is according to the treatment actually received. 
The immune response-evaluable population was defined as subjects assigned to the DRd group who have at 
least 1 immunogenicity sample obtained after their first daratumumab administration. 
Two interim analyses were planned for the MMY3003 and the MMY3004 studies by an Independent Data 
Monitoring  Committee  (IDMC).  The  first  interim  analysis  was  to  provide  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of 
safety after 80 subjects had been treated for at least 8 weeks or discontinued the study treatment. 
The second interim analysis was to evaluate cumulative interim safety and efficacy data, and was to be 
performed when approximately 60% of the total planned events had been accumulated. The significance 
level at this interim analysis to establish the superiority of DRd over Rd and DVd over Vd respectively, with 
regard to PFS was determined based on the observed number of PFS events at the interim analysis, using 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 27/105 
 
  
  
 
 
   
 
the  O’Brien-Fleming  boundaries  as  implemented  by  the  Lan-DeMets  alpha  spending  method.  IDMC 
continues to review safety data at regular intervals during the study.  
Response to study treatment and progressive disease was based on IMWG response criteria (by a validated 
computer  algorithm)  with  minimal  response  (MR)  defined  according  to  European  Society  for  Blood  and 
Marrow Transplantation criteria.

Participant flow  
The disposition of Subjects randomized into Study MMY3003 is shown in Figure 8. 
Figure 8 Disposition of Subjects randomized into Study MMY3003 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted in 18 countries, 12 of the countries were in the EU region (68% of subjects), 4 in 
the Asia-Pacific region (20%) and 12% of subjects were from Canada and the United States.  
The first subject was randomized on 16 June 2014 and the last subject started treatment on 15 July 2015. 
The clinical cut-off was 7 March 2016. 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was dated 10 February 2014. There were 2 global amendments and 4 country-specific 
amendments.  
Amendment FRA-1 (8 May 2014): Exclusion Criteria #6 was modified to exclude subjects with a history of 
malignancy within 5 years, instead of 3 years. 
Amendment INT-1 (16 June 2014): The sample size was changed to reflect the median PFS assumption for 
the  comparator  arm.  Lenalidomide  Global  Pregnancy  Prevention  Plan  was  added.  Feedback  from 
investigators and Health Authorities was incorporated. 
Amendment  JPN-1  (26  August  2014):  In  response  to  PMDA  comments,  a  section  and  attachment  were 
added  to  describe  the  enhanced  reporting,  monitoring,  and  review  of  pre-specified  safety  events  for 
Japanese subjects in the DRd group (minimum of 3 subjects).  
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 28/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Amendment  INT-2  (20  November  2014):  The  requirements  for  bone  marrow  sample  collection  were 
modified to allow for differences across countries in local clinical practice. Other protocol procedures were 
clarified  based  on  feedback  from  investigative  sites.  Changes  from  FRA-1  and  JPN-1  amendments  were 
rolled into the global INT-2 amendment. 
Amendment DEU-1 (15 December 2014), INT-2/DEU-1 (7 April 2015): The exclusion criterion #9 text that 
was incorporated into Protocol Amendment INT-1 and INT-2 was replaced with the original protocol text.

Ancillary analyses 
The  time  to  subsequent  antimyeloma treatment  was  significantly  delayed  for patients in  the  DRd  group 
compared with patients in the Rd group (HR=0.38, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.55; p< 0.0001). Forty (14%) and 89 
(31%) of the patients in the DRd and Rd group, respectively, started subsequent anti-myeloma therapy. The 
median time to subsequent therapy or death due to progressive disease was not reached for either group 
(data not shown).  
Patient-reported outcome were assessed using 2 PRO measures, the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and the EQ-5D-5L. No 
statistically significant difference was observed between DRd and Rd in change from baseline or median time 
to  improvement  or  worsening  in  the  Global  Healts  Status/QOL  subscale  of  the  EORTC-QLQ-C30  or  the 
EQ-5D-5L Utility score or EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (data not shown).

Patient-reported Outcomes  
Functional  status  and  well-being  were  assessed  using  PRO  measures,  the  EORTC-QLQ-C30  and  the 
EQ-5D-5L.  Compliance  was  comparable  between  treatment  groups  and  baseline  scores  on  all  subscales 
were comparable between treatment Groups. The PRO results indicated no statistically significant difference 
between DVd and Vd in change from baseline or median time to improvement or worsening in the Global 
Health Status/QOL subscale of the EORTC-QLQ-C30. For nearly all timepoints, no statistically significant 
differences between DVd and Vd were observed in change from baseline in the EQ-5D-5L Utility Score or 
EQ-5D-5L VAS and no statistically significant differences were observed between DVd and Vd in median time 
to worsening or improvement in the Utility Score or VAS (data not shown).

Supportive studies 
Study MMY1001 
The  study  MMY1001  was  designed  to  evaluate  daratumumab  in  combination  with  various  background 
therapies,  in  this  application  the  combination  of  daratumumab  with  pomalidomide  and  dexamethasone 
(DPd)  was  investigated.  Additional  data  from  bortezomib-containing  cohorts  are  included  in  the 
pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity analyses.  After a median  duration of follow-up of 9.8 months, the 
median DOR was 13.6 months. At the time of the clinical  cut-off, 48% of subjects had experienced PFS 
events; median PFS was 10.4 months. The median OS was not reached, but based on the Kaplan-Meier 
estimate, the 12-month OS rate was 72%.

Study GEN503  
The study GEN503 had 2 phases, phase 1 was a dose escalation study evaluating 4 doses of daratumumab 
(2-16 mg/kg), data are included in the pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity analyses. Patients in phase 2 
received daratumumab with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd). The ORR in the DRd group was 81%, 
consistent with the DRd group in Study MMY3003. Sixty-three percent of subjects had a response of VGPR

or better. After a median duration of follow-up of 23.0 months, the median DOR was not reached. The 
median TTP was not reached, but 72% of the patients remained progression-free after 18 months. The 
median OS was not reached and the 18-month OS rate based on Kaplan-Meier estimate was 90%. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Both the MMY3003 and the MMY3004 studies were large randomized, controlled open-label Phase 3 study 
where daratumumab was added to 2 different current standard of care regimens in multiple myeloma. For 
the MMY3003, daratumumab was added to lenalidomide + dexamethasone and compared with lenalidomide 
+  dexamethasone  alone  and  in  the  MMY3004  study,  daratumumab  was  added  to  bortezomib  + 
dexamethasone  and  compared  with  bortezomib  +  dexamethasone.  Both  studies  included  patients  with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy. The study design was 
appropriate, as were the primary endpoint (PFS) and the secondary clinical endpoints. The clinical response 
was  assessed  based  on  IMWG  criteria  validated  by  computerized  algorithm  with  3  stratification  factors: 
number of prior lines of therapy (1 vs. 2 and 2 vs. >3), ISS score at screening and whether subjects had 
received prior lenalidomide/bortezomib treatment (no vs. yes) which is endorsed.  
The study population with its baseline characteristics reflected the target population as well as all patients 
had received at least one, and up to 10-11 prior therapies generally accepted in this population and clinical 
setting.  The  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  adequately  defined  the  population  covered  by  the  proposed 
indication. The final inclusion criteria for IgG Multiple Myeloma is a serum M-protein of ≥1 g/dL, for other 
types of Multiple Myeloma, IgA, IgD, IgE and IgM, the serum M-protein is ≥0.5 g/dL.  
Selection of the dose regimens for daratumumab was based on previous monotherapy data and available 
preliminary  data  from  Study  GEN503,  where  the  dose  of  daratumumab  monotherapy,  16  mg/kg  in 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, was approved weekly for 8 weeks, then every 2 weeks for 16 weeks, 
then  every  4  weeks  thereafter,  administered  intravenously  until  disease  progression  or  unacceptable 
toxicity.  The  dosing  schedule  of  daratumumab  in  the  two  combinations  was  adapted  to  align  with  the 
schedule of background therapies, this is considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study MMY3003 
The primary efficacy analysis of PFS showed a statistically significant 63% reduction in the risk of disease 
progression or death for subjects, when daratumumab was added to the lenalidomide + dexamethasone 
regimen  in  subjects  with  relapsed  or  refractory  multiple  myeloma  and  compared  with  lenalidomide  + 
dexamethasone alone (MMY3003) (HR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.52; p<0.0001). The median PFS was 18.4 
months for the Rd group and was not reached for the DRd group. Sensitivity analyses of PFS were consistent 
across all prespecified subgroups of subjects tested. 
The secondary efficacy analyses of TTP showed a statistically significant improvement for the DRd group 
(HR=0.34; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.48) (p<0.0001). The ORR was also significantly improved in the DRd group, 
93% versus 76%; p<0.0001. The rate of VGPR or better was 76% vs. 44%; p<0.0001, and rate of CR or 
better also showed significant improvements for subjects treated with DRd, 43% versus 19%; p<0.0001. 
The MRD negativity rate at 10-4 was significantly higher in subjects treated with DRd compared with those 
who received Rd, 29% versus 8%, p<0.0001. This data indicates a robust response. The ORRs and rates of 
VGPR  or  better  for  subgroups  of  subjects  were  consistent  across  the  subgroups  tested  and  showed  an 
improvement for all subgroups for subjects in the DRd group. Daratumumab  also induced more durable 
responses with the median duration of response not estimable (lower limit of the 95% CI was not estimable) 
for the DRd group versus 17.4 months for the Rd group. As of the clinical cutoff date of  7 March 2016, 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 59/105 
 
  
  
 
 
median OS was not reached for either treatment group. The 18-month overall survival rate was 86.1% (95% 
CI: 79.9, 90.5) in the DRd group and 75.6% (95% CI: 59.8, 85.9) in the Rd group.  
No statistically significant difference was observed between DRd and Rd in change from baseline or median 
time to improvement or worsening in the Global Healts Status/QOL subscale of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 or the 
EQ-5D-5L Utility score or EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale (VAS) data. 
Study MMY3004 
When daratumumab was added to the bortezomib + dexamethasone regimen improved and compared to 
bortezomib + dexamethasone alone, the primary objective was met, PFS showed a 61% reduction in the risk 
of disease progression or death for subjects treated with DVd versus Vd (HR=0.39; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.53; 
p<0.0001). The median PFS was not reached for the DVd group and was 7.2 months for the Vd group. As in 
the MMY3003 study, the PFS results were consistent for all sensitivity analyses and across all subgroups of 
subjects tested.  
Results of secondary efficacy analyses were supportive in improving TTP for the DVd group (HR=0.30; 95% 
CI: 0.21, 0.43) (p<0.0001). The effect on ORR was higher in the DVd group (83% versus 63%; p<0.0001). 
The rate of VGPR or better (59% versus 29%; p<0.0001), and rate of CR or better (19% versus 9.0%; 
p=0.0012) showed significant improvements for patients who received treatment with DVd. The ORRs and 
rates of VGPR or better for subgroups of subjects were consistent across the subgroups tested.  Additionally, 
the MRD negativity rate at the 10-4 threshold was significantly higher in subjects treated with DVd compared 
with subjects treated with Vd (14% versus 3%, p<0.0001). 
The effect of adding daratumumab seemed robust and deep, with the median duration of response of 7.9 
months for the Vd group compared to not estimable (lower limit of the 95% CI was 11.5 months) for the DVd 
group. The time to subsequent therapy for multiple myeloma was 9.8 months in the Rd group compared with 
not estimable for the DRd group (HR= 0.30; p<0.0001). As of the clinical cutoff date of 11 January 2016, 
median OS was not reached for either treatment group.  
Regarding the patient-reported outcomes for nearly all time points, no statistically significant differences 
between DVd and Vd were observed in change from baseline in the EQ-5D-5L Utility Score or EQ-5D-5L VAS 
and no statistically significant differences were observed between DVd and Vd in median time to worsening 
or improvement in the Utility Score or VAS. 
During  the  assessment,  the  CHMP  raised  a  major  objection  about  the  indication  ‘‘Daratumumab  in  the 
treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma, who have received at least 1 prior therapy’’ requesting 
for its restriction to include the combination treatments. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on the results of studies MMY3003 and MMY3004 a PFS HR of 0.37 and 0.39 indicate a clinical benefit 
of adding daratumumab to standard of care regimens lenaliomide+dexamethasone and 
bortezomib+dexamethasone in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients who have received at 
least one prior therapy. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The assessment of safety was based on safety data from 4 studies (two Phase 3 studies and two Phase 1/2 
studies). Safety data from a total of 1182 subjects are summarized; 664 subjects received daratumumab in 
combination with standard background therapies and 518 subjects received background therapies alone.

From  these  4  studies,  664  subjects  were  treated  with  daratumumab  in  combination  with  background 
therapy and 518 were treated with background therapy alone. Data from all subjects in the Phase 3 Studies 
MMY3003 and MMY3004 are presented in Table 33. In the Phase 1/2 studies, only data from subjects who 
received  16  mg/kg  daratumumab  in  Study  GEN503  or  who  received  daratumumab  in  combination  with 
pomalidomide-dexamethasone in Study MMY1001 are included in the safety analysis. 
Table 33 Data included in the Summary of Clinical Safety 
Due to similarities in subject population (relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma with at least 1 prior therapy) 
and study drugs administered (16 mg/kg daratumumab in combination with Rd), data from the DRd groups 
in Study MMY3003 and Study GEN503 were pooled. For subgroup analyses and AEs of interest, subjects 
receiving daratumumab in all 4 studies (n=664) were pooled for the all-daratumumab population.

Adverse events 
Common AEs 
Only the TEAEs defined as: any AE with an onset date and time on or after that of the first dose of study drug 
through 30 days after the last study drug administration or any AE that was considered related to study drug 
regardless  of  the  start  date  of  the  event  were  summarized.  The  severity  of  TEAEs  was  assessed  using 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI-CTC). Adverse event terms were coded using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 17.0 and were summarized by system 
organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) in table presentations. 
Adverse events were summarized by frequency counts and percentages of subjects with a particular event. 
An  exposure-adjusted  analysis  was  performed  for  adverse  events  in  the  System  Organ  Class  (SOC)  of 
Infections and Infestations.  
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 63/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The  adverse  event  profile  for  daratumumab  in  combination  with  background  therapies  demonstrates  a 
manageable side effect profile as summarized below: 
Discontinuations and deaths due to TEAEs were low and balanced in the randomized studies. 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  across  treatment  groups  were  cytopenias.  Daratumumab  may 
increase  cytopenias  associated  with  background  therapies,  with  thrombocytopenia  the  most  common 
preferred  term  reported  for  subjects  receiving  bortezomib-based  regimens  and  neutropenia  the  most 
common preferred term reported for subjects receiving lenalidomide- or pomalidomide-based regimens. 
IRRs were reported in approximately half of subjects; mainly Grade 1 or 2. Most IRRs occurred during the 
first infusion only, and rarely led to treatment discontinuation.  
Although  the  overall  incidence  of  infections  were  reported  by  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the 
daratumumab  containing  groups  compared  to  the  respective  background  therapy,  the  majority  of  all 
infections were mild (Grade 1 or 2) and did not require hospitalization. 
- 
The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 infection was similar between the daratumumab combinations and the 
background therapies, with the most common being pneumonia. 
-  Discontinuations  from  treatment  and  deaths  due  to  infection  were  low  and  balanced  between 
groups. 
Second primary malignancies (SPM) were reported at a low frequency in the daratumumab combination 
groups (<4%). 
Frequently reported TEAEs (by at least 10% of subjects in any treatment group) are summarized in Table 
356 below.

For  adverse  drug  reactions  summarized  across  daratumumab  monotherapy  studies  (16  mg/kg 
daratumumab, n=156) and combination studies (all-daratumumab population, n=664), assessment of ADR 
terms  was  based  on  the  terms  identified  in  the  randomized  controlled  studies.  The  occurrence  of  ADRs 
summarized across daratumumab monotherapy and combination studies (n=820) is provided in Table 37

Table 37 Adverse reactions in multiple myeloma patients treated with DARZALEX 16 mg/kg 
In  the  DVd  group,  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  that  the  investigator  considered  related  to 
daratumumab were thrombocytopenia (30%), dyspnea (13%), and cough, lymphopenia, and fatigue (11% 
each). The most frequently reported TEAEs that the investigator considered related to other study drugs 
were thrombocytopenia (DVd: 51%, Vd: 34%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (DVd: 47%, Vd: 35%). 
In  the  DRd  group,  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  that  the  investigator  considered  related 
todaratumumab were neutropenia (19%), cough (14%), fatigue (12%), and dyspnea and diarrhea (11% 
each). The most frequently reported TEAEs that the investigator considered related to other study drugs 
were neutropenia (DRd: 58%, Rd: 38%), fatigue (DRd: 29%, Rd: 20%) and diarrhea (DRd: 29%, Rd: 11%). 
In  the  DPd  cohort,  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  that  the  investigator  considered  related  to 
daratumumab  were  neutropenia  (44%),  anemia  (31%),  thrombocytopenia  (26%),  leukopenia  (25%), 
lymphopenia (16%), cough (14%), fatigue (12%), and dyspnea and diarrhea (11% each). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
Infusions related reactions 
As  was  observed  with  daratumumab  monotherapy,  infusion  related  reactions  (IRR)  were  frequently 
observed among the daratumumab-treated subjects in the combination studies. In all 4 studies, 47% of the 
664 subjects who received daratumumab experienced an IRR. The vast majority of IRRs occurred during the 
first infusion and most subjects had IRRs only once at the first infusion and did not continue to experience 
IRRs with subsequent infusions. Only 3% of subjects had an IRR in more than 1 infusion. The majority of 
IRRs  were  mild  (Grade  1  or  2).  Grade  3  IRRs  were  reported  by  6%  of  subjects.  No  Grade  4  or  5  IRRs 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 67/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
occurred. Infusion–related reactions were managed with supportive medications, a pause in infusion or a 
decrease in infusion rate, and did not usually result in treatment discontinuation. 
The most frequently reported AE terms used to describe IRRs were respiratory disorders: dyspnea (10%), 
cough (9%), and bronchospasm (5%). Other common IRRs were chills (6%), nausea (5%), and vomiting 
(5%).  The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3  IRRs  were  hypertension  (2%),  dyspnea  (1%),  and 
bronchospasm (1%). 
Of the 315 subjects who experienced IRRs, 307 subjects (97%) had the reaction during their first infusion. 
Nine subjects (1%) had an IRR in their second infusion and 21 subjects (3%) in subsequent infusions. The 
range of AE terms used to describe IRRs was similar between those that occurred in the first, second, and 
subsequent infusions. The median time to onset of an IRR was 85 minutes while delayed IRRs (onset more 
than 24 hours after start of infusion) were rare and only reported in two subjects. One subject with Grade 2 
pyrexia after about 1 day and one subject with Grade 1 pruritus after about 3 days.   
Pre-infusion  medications  required  to  manage  infusion  reactions  included  antihistamines,  analgesics,  and 
corticosteroids  before  each  daratumumab  infusion.  In  all  3  daratumumab  containing  treatment  groups, 
100%  of 
subjects 
received  an  antihistamine,  usually  diphenhydramine, 
chlorpheniramine, 
dexchlorpheniramine, or clemastine. All but 1 subject in the DRd group and 2 subjects in the DVd group 
received paracetamol. The cortisteroids were administered per protocol as part of the background therapy. 
In  addition  to  regular  administration  of  background  corticosteroids  as  part of  post-infusion  medications, 
subjects at higher risk for respiratory complications were also recommended to use additional post-infusion 
medication. Only a small percentage of subjects were treated with such post-infusion medications. In the 
DRd  and  DVd  groups,  6%  to  7%  of  subjects  received  an  antihistamine  and  2%  of  subjects  received 
salbumatol. Such post-infusion medications were not used by any subjects in the DPd cohort. 
Treatment modifications in response to IRR included infusion interruption, infusion aborted/drug withdrawn, 
or infusion rate decrease. Nearly all subjects who experienced IRRs (280/315) had their infusion interrupted, 
aborted  (or  drug  withdrawn  in  GEN503),  or  the  infusion  rate  decreased.  The  TEAEs  that  led  to  infusion 
modifications, are nearly the same as the ones already identified as IRRs. 
Neutropenia 
More subjects receiving daratumumab combination therapy reported neutropenia compared to background 
therapy alone (DVd: 18%, Vd: 9%, DRd: 62%, Rd: 43%). Neutropenia was reported for 79% of subjects in 
the  DPd  cohort.  Most  frequently,  neutropenia  occurred  in  the  first  2  or  3  cycles.  Incidence  of  febrile 
neutropenia was low, 2% for the DVd group and 0.4% for the Vd group, 5% for the DRd group and 3% for 
the Rd group and 7% for DPd group, all were rade 3 or 4. Neutropenia was managed by dose modifications 
and growth factor use and rarely led to treatment discontinuation. 
Infections and infestations 
In the 4 daratumumab studies, adverse events in the Infections and Infestations SOC were overall among 
the most frequently reported TEAEs. Infections were reported by a higher percentage of subjects in the 
daratumumab containing groups (DVd: 68%, DRd: 83%) compared to the respective background therapy 
(Vd: 53%, Rd: 73%). However, Grade 3 or 4 infections were similar (DVd: 21%, Vd: 19%, DRd: 27%, Rd: 
23%). In the DPd cohort, 70% of subjects had infections (28% Grade 3 or 4). The majority of infections were 
mild  (Grade  1  or  2)  and  did  not  require  hospitalization.  The  most  common  infections  were  respiratory 
disorders  such  as  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  bronchitis,  sinusitis,  or  nasopharyngitis,  which  were 
common across all regimens. 
Discontinuations  from  treatment  (2%  to  5%)  and  deaths  (0.8%  to  2%)  due  to  infection  were  rare  and 
balanced between groups. Pneumonia occurred in 11% to 13% of the study population and was the most 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 68/105 
 
  
  
 
 
commonly reported severe (Grade 3 or 4) infection (7% to 10%) and also the most commonly  reported 
serious infection (7% to 9%). The occurrence of pneumonia was balanced between treatment groups, and 
seldom resulted in treatment discontinuations or deaths (0.4% to 2%). 
Herpes zoster 
Bortezomib  and  lenalidomide  exposure  poses  a  known  risk  of  herpes  zoster  reactivation  and  antiviral 
prophylaxis is recommended. The protocols recommended, but did not require, anti-viral prophylaxis for all 
study subjects. 
Daratumumab with Bortezomib-Dexamethasone (DVd) 
Herpes zoster as an adverse event was reported for 13 subjects (5%) in the DVd group (8 of these subjects 
received  prophylactic  anti-viral  therapy)  and  7  subjects  (3%)  in  the  Vd  group  (1  subject  received 
prophylactic antiviral therapy). Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs of herpes zoster was reported for 4 subjects (1.6%) in 
the DVd group and 1 subject (0.4%) in the Vd group. 
Daratumumab with Lenalidomide-Dexamethasone (DRd) 
In Study 3003, Herpes zoster as an adverse event was reported for 6 subjects (2%) in the DRd group and 
5 subjects (2%) in the Rd group. Two subjects in each group received prophylactic antiviral therapy. Grade 
3 or 4 TEAEs of herpes zoster was reported for no subjects in the DRd group and 1 subject (0.4%) in the Rd 
group.  
Daratumumab with Pomalidomide-Dexamethasone (DPd) 
Two subjects (2%) had TEAEs of herpes zoster. Both events were Grade 3, neither was serious and neither 
led to treatment discontinuation. One of these 2 subjects was taking antiviral prophylaxis medication.  
Thrombocypenia and bleeding 
Thrombocytopenia  was  similar  between  the  DRd  group  and  Rd  group  (27%  in  each  group). 
Thrombocytopenia  was  reported  by  more  subjects  in  the  DVd  group  (59%)  compared  to  the  Vd  group 
(44%),  but  bleeding  events  were  low  and  the  majority  were  Grade  1  or  2  events.  In  the  DPd  cohort, 
thrombocytopenia was reported by 41% of subjects. Grade 3 or 4 bleeding events were experienced by 1% 
or less of subjects in all treatment groups. 
Hemolysis and interference with blood typing 
Daratumumab  binds  to  CD38  found  at  low  levels  on  red  blood  cells  and  could  theoretically  result  in 
hemolysis. One subject (in the DPd cohort, Study MMY1001) experienced a Grade 1 TEAE of hemolysis on 
Study Day 70 which was diagnosed based on the presence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. The 
TEAE occurred 13 days after the last blood transfusion and 12 days after the last daratumumab infusion. 
There was no immediate exacerbation of anemia. No new cases of daratumumab interference with blood 
typing have been reported. 
Cardiac events – atrial fibrillation 
Atrial fibrillation was observed in 2% to 7% of subjects across all studies. Atrial fibrillation was balanced 
between the DRd and Rd groups but was slightly higher in the DVd group compared to the Vd group. The 
majority of subjects with atrial fibrillation had a prior history of atrial fibrillation or cardiac risk factors. 
Cardiac events – QT prolongation  
No subjects in DVd, Vd, or DPd groups had an AE of QT prolongation. QT prolongation was reported as an AE 
for 6 subjects (2%) in the DRd group and 1 subject (0.4%) in the Rd group. All were Grade 1 or 2. Only 1 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 69/105 
 
  
  
 
 
subject, in the DRd group, had a corrected QT interval greater than 500 msec. This subject had an ongoing 
history of heart failure, and a one-time QTcF reading of 532 msec was reported on Study Day 50 as an AE of 
electrocardiogram  QT  prolonged.  Baseline  electrocardiogram  findings  were  normal.  The  investigator 
considered  this  event  as  very  likely  related  to  lenalidomide  and  not  related  to  daratumumab  or 
dexamethasone. The event was considered resolved 7 days later and the subject continues to receive study 
treatment. No further QT prolongation has been reported. 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
A review of all AEs from hepatobiliary disorders showed the incidence of AEs to be very low and balanced 
between daratumumab combination therapy and background therapy alone. There is no specific AE event 
associated with hepatobiliary disorders identified. Liver enzymes were within the normal range for over 95% 
of subjects across all studies. 
Second primary malignancies 
Second primary malignancies  (SPMs) were  collected using  a separate  eCRF  page  in the Phase  3 studies 
throughout  the  study  including  long  term  follow-up.  SPMs  have  been  identified  as  a  rare  but  important 
consideration in the treatment of multiple myeloma. A recent review evaluated the  reports of SPM from 
several  retrospective  and  prospective  studies  identified  lenalidomide  and  alkylating  agent  exposure  as 
potential (but not exclusive) risk factors. The incidence of SPMs is likely between 0.5% and 4.5% with a 
latency period of >12 months. Hematologic SPMs were more common than nonhematologic SPMs with a 
higher  prevalence  of  myelodysplastic  syndrome  and  acute  myeloid  leukemia.  Based  on  data  from  all  4 
studies, no increased risk of SPM due to daratumumab treatment has been observed.

Laboratory findings 
Hematology values  
Daratumumab with Bortezomib-Dexamethasone 
Low platelets are a common laboratory abnormality in subjects treated with bortezomib. The most common 
Grade 3 or 4 hematology abnormalities for both treatment groups were low platelets (DVd: 48%; Vd: 36%) 
and low lymphocytes (DVd: 51%; Vd: 30%).  Grade 3 or 4 low neutrophils were 16% in the DVd group and 
6% in the Vd group. Similar proportion of subjects in both treatment groups had Grade 3 low hemoglobin 
(DVd: 17%; Vd: 16%). No Grade 4 hemoglobin was reported in any of the treatment groups. 
Daratumumab with Lenalidomide-Dexamethasone 
The most common Grade 3 or 4 hematology laboratory abnormalities were low neutrophils (DRd group: 
54%; Rd group: 41%) and low lymphocytes (DRd group: 54%; Rd group: 40%), with higher proportions 
reported in the DRd group compared with the Rd group. The percentage of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 low 
platelets was similar between the 2 treatment groups (DRd group: 14%; Rd group: 16%). Grade 3 
hemoglobin low was reported for 14% of subjects in the DRd group and 21% of subjects in the Rd group. No 
Grade 4 low hemoglobin was reported in either treatment group. 
Daratumumab with Pomalidomide-Dexamethasone 
The most common Grade 3 or 4 hematology laboratory abnormalities were low neutrophils (82%) and 
lymphocytes (73%). Grade 3 or 4 low platelets was reported by 20% of subjects. Grade 3 low hemoglobin 
was reported for 32% of subjects, no Grade 4 low hemoglobin was reported. 
Clinical Chemistry 
The incidence of chemistry laboratory abnormalities was low, and the majority was Grade 0 or 1. 
Daratumumab with Bortezomib-Dexamethasone 
Changes in chemistry values to Grade 4 were uncommon, and did not exceed 5% of the population. Changes 
to Grade 3 values were also uncommon, and rarely exceeded 5% of the population except for Grade 3 low 
sodium levels (DVd: 5%, Vd: 6%) and Grade 3 low phosphate levels (DVd: 9%, Vd: 5%). The majority of 
Grade 3 and Grade 4 values represented shifts from Grade 0 or Grade 1 at baseline. Mean creatinine levels 
were generally lower for the DVd group compared with the Vd group over time during the study and 
reciprocally, creatinine clearance values were higher for the DVd group compared with the Vd group and 
increased over time for both treatment groups. This observation of improving creatinine clearance over time 
supports a beneficial impact of treatment since renal failure is a notable complication of untreated or poorly 
controlled multiple myeloma. 
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin levels were normal 
throughout the study for over 98% of subjects. Grade 4 AST high and ALT high were recorded for 1 subject 
(0.4%) each in the DVd and Vd groups, no subjects had Grade 4 bilirubin high. Grade 3 ALT high was 
reported for 5 subjects (2%) in the DVd group and 1 subject (0.4%) in the Vd group. Grade 3 AST high was 
reported for 2 subjects (0.8%) in the DVd group and no subjects in the Vd group. Grade 3 bilirubin high was 
reported for no subjects in the DVd group and 1 subject (0.4%) in the Vd group. 
Daratumumab with Lenalidomide-Dexamethasone 
Changes in chemistry values to Grade 4 were uncommon, and did not exceed 5% of the population. Changes 
to Grade 3 values were also rare, and rarely exceeded 5% of the population except for Grade 3 low

potassium levels (DRd: 5%, Rd: 3%) and Grade 3 low phosphate levels (DRd: 12%, Rd: 11%). The majority 
of Grade 3 and Grade 4 values represented shifts from Grade 0 or Grade 1 at baseline. 
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and bilirubin levels were normal 
throughout the study for over 95% of subjects. No Grade 4 values for these laboratory parameters were 
reported. Grade 3 ALT high was reported for 8 subjects (3%) in the DRd group and 5 subjects (2%) in the 
Rd group. Grade 3 AST high was reported for 3 subjects (1%) in the DVd group and no subjects in the Rd 
group. Grade 3 bilirubin high was reported for 2 subjects (0.6%) in the DRd group and 1 subject (0.4%) in 
the Rd group. 
Daratumumab with Pomalidomide-Dexamethasone 
Hypercalcemia (9%) was the only Grade 4 biochemistry value that was reported by more than 5% of 
subjects. Other frequently reported Grade 3 biochemistry parameters were low sodium (11%) and low 
phosphate levels (10%). 
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST, and bilirubin levels were normal throughout the study for over 95% of 
subjects. No Grade 4 values for these laboratory parameters were reported. Grade 3 AST high and ALT high 
were recorded for 3 subject (3%) each. Grade 3 bilirubin high was reported for 2 subjects (2%). 
Immunogenicity Assessments 
Evaluation of anti-daratumumab antibodies was conducted for all subjects participating in the 4 studies 
included in this submission. Evaluable blood samples were obtained after the first dose of daratumumab 
from 298 subjects. Results are summarized in the Table 41. 
Table 41 Summary and Anti- Daratumumab Antibodies: Immune Response-evaluable Analysis 
Set (Studies: MMY3003, MMY3004, MMY1001 and GEN503) 
As shown in the table above, one subject in Study MMY1001, in the DVTd cohort, was positive for ADA at the 
Week 9 Follow-Up visit; the antibodies were non-neutralizing. This subject was negative for ADA on 2 other

visits (predose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Week 3 Follow-up) and was on treatment for 4 cycles. This subject was 
not evaluable for response per protocol and discontinued due to autologous stem cell transplantation. There 
were no notable safety signals observed in this subject. 
Daratumumab  binds  to  CD38  found  at  low  levels  on  red  blood  cells  and  could  theoretically  result  in 
haemolysis. One subject (in the DPd cohort, Study MMY1001) experienced a Grade 1 TEAE of hemolysis on 
Study Day 70 which was diagnosed based on the presence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. There 
was no immediate exacerbation of anemia and this TEAE occurred 13 days after blood transfusion and 12 
days after daratumumab infusion. No other TEAEs related to hemolysis have been reported. 
Interference  with  blood  typing  is  already  included  in  the  Warnings  and  Precautions  section  of  the 
daratumumab Product Information, however, no new cases of daratumumab interference with blood typing 
have been reported in the present pivotal studies.  
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
A review of vital signs in the randomized, controlled studies did not identify any safety signals.  
Safety in special populations 
A separate analysis of TEAEs was performed for the daratumumab groups (DVd, DRd, DPd) combined from 
all 4 studies to evaluate potential differences in the safety of daratumumab in subgroups of subjects defined 
by age, gender, race, baseline renal function, baseline hepatic function, and geographic region.

Intrinsic Factors 
Adverse Events by Age Group 
Of the 664 subjects, 336 (51%) were 18 to <65 years of age, 269 (41%) were 65 to<75 years, and 59 (9%) 
were≥75 years of age. The incidence of TEAEs by age subgroup was similar to the total population. The 
safety profile observed in elderly subjects was consistent with the expected age-related morbidity in this 
population. Subjects ≥75 years, had an incidence of deaths due to TEAEs (3.4%) compared to all subjects 
(4.8%). However, the sample size in this subgroup was too small to make meaningful comparison.  
Adverse Events by Sex 
Of the 664 subjects treated with the combination regimen with daratumumab, 282 (42%) were female and 
382 (58%) were male. The incidence of TEAEs by sex was similar to the overall population. 
Adverse Events by Race 
Of the 664 subjects treated with the combination regimen with daratumumab, 527 (79%) were White, and 
137 (21%) were non-White. The incidence of TEAEs by race was similar to the overall population. 
Adverse Events by Baseline Renal Function 
240 subjects (36%) had a normal baseline creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥90 mL/min, 249 (38%) had a 
baseline CrCl of 60 to <90 mL/min and 159 (24%) had a baseline CrCl of 30 to <60 mL/min. The incidence 
of TEAEs in the ≥60 mL/min was similar to the overall population. However subjects with moderate renal 
impairment with (baseline CrCl of 30 to <60 mL/min) had a higher incidence of serious TEAE, 59% compared 
to 46% in the overall population, mostly due to Infections and Infestations SOC (31% versus 24% in the 
overall population). Subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl of <30 mL/min) were too small in number 
(n=12) to make a clinically meaningful conclusion.  
Adverse Events by Baseline Hepatic Function 
Daratumumab  being  an  IgG1қ  mAb,  is  presumably  biotransformed  in  the  same  manner  as  any  other 
endogenous  IgG,  and  is  subject  to  similar  elimination.  Hepatic  enzyme-mediated  metabolism  of  intact 
daratumumab  is  therefore  unlikely  to  represent  major  elimination  routes.  As  such,  variations  in  hepatic 
function are  not expected to affect the elimination of daratumumab.  570  (87%) subjects treated with a 
daratumumab  containing  regimen  had  a  normal  hepatic  function  at  baseline,  and  86  (13%)  had  mildly 
impaired hepatic function. In general, the incidence of TEAEs by baseline hepatic function was similar to the 
overall population. No clear pattern in the incidence of TEAEs for subjects with normal versus mildly impaired 
hepatic function was reported. The differences may be due to the small number of subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment, precluding any meaningful comparisons. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Adverse Events by Geographic Region 
In general, the incidence of TEAEs by geographic region was similar to the overall population. 398 (60%) of 
the subjects were from Western Europe, US and Canada, and 40% were from other regions, such as Asia, 
Australia, Mexico and Eastern Europe. 
Overdose 
There has been no experience of overdose in clinical studies. Doses up to 24 mg/kg have been administered 
intravenously in a clinical study (GEN501) without reaching the maximum tolerated dose. 
There is no known specific antidote for daratumumab overdose. In the event of an overdose, the patient 
should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment 
be instituted immediately. 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 76/105 
 
  
  
 
 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
There are no data available on the use of daratumumab in pregnant women and no animal data to assess the 
potential  effects  of  daratumumab  to  increase  the  risk  of  developmental  abnormalities  or  feto/neonatal 
toxicities. 
Women  of  childbearing  potential  using  the  drug  should  use  effective  contraception  during  and  up  to  3 
months  after  treatment.  The  3-month  washout  for  females  is  related  to  the  linear  terminal  half-life  of 
daratumumab  in  plasma  of  about  18  days,  which  can  be  expected  upon  complete  saturation  of 
target-mediated  clearance  and  with  repeated  dosing  of  daratumumab.  Theoretically,  daratumumab  is 
expected to be eliminated from the body in approximately 5 half-lives (90 days). The recommendation for 
women  to  avoid  becoming  pregnant  until  3  months  after  the  last  dose  of  daratumumab  is  a  fairly 
conservative approach which is supported. 
It is not known whether daratumumab is secreted into human or animal milk or affects milk production. 
There are no studies to assess the effect of daratumumab on the breast-fed infant. Maternal IgG is excreted 
in human milk; however, published data suggest that antibodies in breast milk do not enter the neonatal and 
infant circulations in substantial amounts. 
Drug Abuse 
Daratumumab is administered in a controlled setting by healthcare providers. There is no known drug abuse 
potential with daratumumab. 
Withdrawal and Rebound 
No clinical studies of the withdrawal or rebound effects of daratumumab have been conducted. Treatment is 
to be continued until disease progression. 
Effects on Ability to Drive or Operate Machinery or Impairment of Mental Ability 
No clinical information is available related to the effect of daratumumab on the ability to drive, operate 
machinery, or the impairment of mental ability. The effect of daratumumab on the ability to drive or operate 
machinery or the impairment of mental ability has not been formally studied; however, in the integrated 
safety  population,  TEAEs,  such  as  fatigue,  that  could  potentially  affect  the  ability  to  drive  or  operate 
machinery should be considered. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions  
No  formal  drug-drug  interaction  studies  have  been  performed  with  daratumumab.  It  is  expected  that 
daratumumab is metabolized in the same manner as any other endogenous immunoglobulin (degraded into 
small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways) and is subject to similar elimination. Renal excretion 
and hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism of intact daratumumab are therefore unlikely to represent major 
elimination routes. As such, variations in renal and hepatic function or drug metabolizing enzymes are not 
expected to affect the elimination of daratumumab. As a monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to 
a unique epitope on CD38, daratumumab is also not anticipated to alter drug metabolizing enzymes. 
As part of Study MMY1001, PK profiles of combination agents (bortezomib, pomalidomide, and thalidomide) 
were assessed and compared to literature values. Pharmacokinetic values for daratumumab are assessed 
and  compared  with  monotherapy  values.  Overall,  there  is  no  indication  of  clinically  relevant  drug-drug 
interactions between daratumumab and small molecules typically used in treatment of multiple myeloma. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events  
A  summary  of  the  reasons  for  discontinuation  from  study  treatment  is  presented  in  Table  47.  A  lower 
percentage of subjects receiving DVd (31%) or DRd (24%) have discontinued treatment compared to those 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 77/105 
 
  
  
 
 
receiving  background  therapies  alone  (Vd:  44%;  Rd:  47%).  In  the  DPd  cohort,  57%  of  subjects  have 
discontinued treatment.  
Table 43 Summary of Subject Disposition of Study Treatment: Safety Analysis Set (Studies: 
MMY3003, MMY3004, MMY1001 and GEN503) 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment 
Discontinuation of all study treatment due to TEAEs was low and balanced between treatment groups (Table 
48). Across all groups, pneumonia was the most common reason for discontinuation of all study treatment. 
Discontinuation of daratumumab alone was infrequent (1% to 2%) across all studies.

Dose modifications due to AEs 
Daratumumab dose modifications consisted of dose delays and dose skips. The TEAEs that led to a delay or 
skip prior to the start of the infusion in 2 or more subjects are summarized in Table 17. For all daratumumab 
groups combined, the most frequent reasons for interruption of daratumumab dosing were neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia. 
In the DVd group, 87 subjects (36%) had modifications to daratumumab dosing. The single most common 
reason for daratumumab dose modification was thrombocytopenia, reported for 28 subjects (12%). 
Pneumonia was the next most common reason, reported for 11 subjects (5%).  
In  the  DRd  group  (excluding  GEN503  as  this  information  was  not  collected),  105  subjects  (37%)  had 
modifications to daratumumab dosing. The single most common reason for daratumumab dose modification 
was neutropenia, reported for 29 subjects (10%). Pneumonia was the next most common reason, reported 
for 10 subjects (4%). 
In the DPd cohort, 50 subjects (49%) had modifications to daratumumab dosing. The single most common 
reason was neutropenia, reported for 24 subjects (23%). Thrombocytopenia was the next most common 
reason, reported for 9 subjects (9%).

Dose Modification of Background Therapy 
A higher proportion of subjects from the DVd group were reported with a TEAE leading to dose modifications 
(dose delays, dose skipping, schedule change, or dose reduction) of bortezomib (DVd: 64%, Vd: 54%) and 
dexamethasone (DVd: 46%, Vd: 39%) compared with the Vd group. The most commonly reported TEAE 
leading to dose modifications was peripheral sensory neuropathy for bortezomib (DVd: 32%, Vd: 23%) and 
upper respiratory tract infection for dexamethasone (DVd: 3%, Vd: 5%).  
In Study MMY3003, a higher proportion of subjects from the DRd group were reported with a TEAE leading 
to dose modifications (dose delay, dose skip, dose reduction) of lenalidomide (DRd: 71%, Rd: 54%) and 
dexamethasone (DRd: 58%, Rd: 44%) compared with the Rd group. The most commonly reported TEAE 
leading  to  dose  modifications  was  neutropenia  for  both  lenalidomide  (DRd:  34%,  Rd:  22%)  and 
dexamethasone (DRd: 7%, Rd: 4%). 
Seventy-three percent (73%) of subjects experienced TEAEs leading to pomalidomide dose modification (ie, 
dose  delays,  dose  skipping,  dose  re-escalation,  or  dose  reduction);  the  most  common  reason  was 
neutropenia (48%).

A  cumulative  review  was  performed  on  all  post-marketing  spontaneous  cases  of  daratumumab  and  all 
events received by the MAH and entered into global safety database cumulatively through 15 May 2016. The 
results suggest that the drug’s post-marketing safety profile is consistent with the known safety profile of 
daratumumab as a single agent indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma. 
The search of the global safety database retrieved a total of 289 cases. Of these, 266 were further analyzed. 
Among the 266 cases, 138 were serious and 128 were non serious. Of the cases reporting patient sex, 52% 
(93/179) concerned males. The patients ranged in age from 38 to 88 years (mean age 64.4 years, median 
age 65 years). The outcome was non-fatal in majority of the cases (92.1%; 245/266). 
Review of the serious cases (n=138), which reported 366 events, revealed that the following 4 events were 
reported with greatest frequency: IRRs (9.6%; 35/366), dyspnoea (4.4%; 16/366), death (4.1%; 15/366) 
and decreased platelet count/thrombocytopenia (5.2%; 19/366). In many of the cases, the reported events 
are consistent with listed events in the company core data sheet for daratumumab. 
Of the 138 serious cases reviewed, event outcome was fatal in 21 cases, in 13 cases the cause of death was 
unspecified and in 8 cases, the fatal MedDRA PTs reported were: death, pancytopenia, plasma cell myeloma, 
and  sepsis  (reported  twice  each);  acute  respiratory  failure,  asthenia,  cardiac  disorder,  cardiac  failure 
congestive,  central  nervous  system  necrosis,  cerebrovascular  accident,  disease  progression,  febrile 
neutropenia, leukocytosis, leukoencephalopathy, metabolic acidosis, plasmablastic lymphoma, tachycardia, 
and tachypnoea (reported once each). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety  data  from  a  total  of  1182  subjects  were  collected  in  order  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of 
daratumumab  together  with  standard  background  therapy,  664  subjects  received  daratumumab  in 
combination with standard background therapies and 518 subjects received background therapies alone.  
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 81/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The proposed treatment dose  applied (16 mg/kg) corresponds to the treatment dose  of the majority of 
subjects included in the studies. Long term data (>6 months) was obtained from 141/243 subjects in the 
DVd group and 282/318 subjects in the DRd group, including a total of 158 subjects who received treatment 
for more than a year. The number of exposed subjects and degree of exposure is considered sufficient to 
evaluate the safety of daratumumab in combination with the background therapies. 
The  majority  of  subjects  in  the  studies  experienced  AEs.  Most  notably,  infusion  related  reactions  were 
common  and  justify  the  recommendation  of  pre-  and  post-infusion  steroid  treatment.  Other  frequently 
occurring  AEs  were  fatigue,  nausea,  anaemia,  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection, diarrhoea and peripheral sensory neuropathy.  
The TEAEs reported for subjects in the daratumumab+ background group were similar to those reported in 
the background group, and included known toxicities of lenalidomide/bortezomib and those of daratumumab 
as  monotherapy.  In  the  daratumumab+lenalidomide+dexamethssone  (DRd  and  Rd)  group,  the  most 
commonly  reported  TEAEs  were:  neutropenia,  diarrhea,  fatigue,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and 
anemia. Neutropenia was more often observed as a TEAE in the DRd group compared with the Rd group 
(DRd: 59%; Rd: 43%) particularly in the first 2 cycles of treatment (DRd: 48%; Rd: 26%) and in subjects 
≥ 65 years (DRd: 60%, Rd: 41%). This difference could be due to a more frequent dosing of daratumumab 
treatment during this period. For the daratumumab+bortezimib+dexamethasone (DVd and Vd) group, the 
most  commonly  reported  TEAEs  were:  thrombocytopenia,  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy,  anemia,  and 
fatigue. Peripheral neuropathy is a well-known adverse effect due to bortezomib, this may also be affected 
by comorbidities or underlying multiple myeloma.  
Grade 3 and 4 adverse events seemed to be higher in the DVd group (76% and versus 62%, respectively). 
This increase in Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs was mainly due to haematologic TEAEs as thrombocytopenia (45% 
versus 33%), neutropenia (13% versus 4%) and lymphopenia (10% versus 3%) and was more prominent 
in early cycles of the treatment. However the incidence of bleeding was low during the study (DVd: 7%; Vd: 
4%). The cytopenias are more prominent in the early cycles of treatment. 
Infusion-related reactions are usually associated with administration of daratumumab. The TEAE terms used 
to describe IRRs and the timing of the IRRs with respect to the start of the daratumumab infusion were 
consistent with the IRRs previously reported  for daratumumab in monotherapy studies. Most  IRRs were 
Grade 1 or 2 and were experienced on Day 1 of the first infusion of daratumumab. In the MMY3003 and 
MMY3004  studies,  IRRs  were  reported 
in  48%  and  45%  of  subjects  respectively 
in  the 
daratumumab+lenalidomide+dexamethasone (DRd) and the daratumumab+bortezomib+dexamethasone 
studies (DVd). Few subjects discontinued daratumumab due to IRRs, 1 subject in the DRd group, and 2 in 
the DVd group.  
Infections and infestations, a common problem in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma, were 
reported in 83% of subjects in the DRd group vs. 73% in the Rd group, and 68% in the DVd group vs. 53% 
in the Vd group. However the incidence of grade 3 or 4 infections was the same between the treatment 
groups, both in the DRd/Rd group (28% and 23% respectively) and in the DVd/Vd groups (21% and 19% 
respectively). The majority of infections were mild (Grade 1 or 2) and did not require hospitalization. The 
most common infections were respiratory disorders such as  upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, 
sinusitis, or nasopharyngitis, which were common across all regimens.  
Daratumumab may increase neutropenia and thrombocytopenia induced by background therapy. Complete 
blood cell counts should be monitored periodically during treatment according to manufacturer’s prescribing 
information for background therapies. Patients with neutropenia should be monitored for signs of infection. 
Daratumumab  delay  may  be  required  to  allow  recovery  of  blood  cell  counts.  No  dose  reduction  of 
daratumumab is recommended. Supportive care with transfusions or growth factors should be considered 
(SmPC section 4.4). Based on the above, both neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have been classified as 
important identified risks in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Patients  treated  with  daratumumab  combination  therapy  (n  =  299)  were  evaluated  for  anti-therapeutic 
antibody responses to daratumumab at multiple time points during treatment and up to 8 weeks following 
the end of treatment. Following the start of daratumumab treatment, 2 (0.7%) of the combination therapy 
patients tested positive for anti daratumumab antibodies; 1 of the combination therapy patients developed 
transient neutralizing antibodies against daratumumab (SmPC section 5.1). 
Daratumumab binds to CD38 found at low levels on red blood cells (RBCs) and may result in a positive 
indirect Coombs test. Daratumumab mediated positive indirect Coombs test may persist for up to 6 months 
after the last daratumumab infusion. It should be recognised that daratumumab bound to RBCs may mask 
detection of antibodies to minor antigens in the patient’s serum. The determination of a patient’s ABO and 
Rh  blood  type  are  not  impacted.  Patients  should  be  typed  and  screened  prior  to  starting  daratumumab 
treatment. Phenotyping may be considered prior to starting daratumumab treatment as per local practice. 
Red blood cell genotyping is not impacted by daratumumab and may be performed at any time. In the event 
of  a  planned  transfusion  blood  transfusion  centres  should  be  notified  of  this  interference  with  indirect 
antiglobulin tests. If an emergency transfusion is required, non-cross matched ABO/RhD compatible RBCs 
can be given per local blood bank practices  (SmPC,  sections  4.4 and  4.5).  Educational  materials will be 
distributed to Health Care Professionals (HCPs) and blood banks to advise on the risk of and solutions for 
interference for blood typing. Patient ID cards will be distributed to increase awareness to patients about the 
interference of blood typing occurring with daratumumab. A survey to measure awareness of blood banks 
and HCPs on the interference of blood typing is requested and results are expected to be provided in the 
PSUR (please see RMP section 2.6). 
No subjects in DVd, Vd, or DPd groups had an AE of QT prolongation. QT prolongation was reported as an AE 
for 6 subjects (2%) in the DRd group and 1 subject (0.4%) in the Rd group. QT prolongation has been added 
as an important potential risk and the secondary objective of study SMM2001 which is a randomised Phase 
2  trial  to  evaluate  3  daratumumab  dose  schedules  in  smouldering  multiple  myeloma,  is  to  determine  if 
daratumumab has an effect on QT interval. The study results are expected to be submitted by the end of 
2018 (please see RMP section 2.6).  
Discontinuations  from  treatment  (2%  to  5%)  and  deaths  (0.8%  to  2%)  due  to  infection  were  rare  and 
balanced between groups.  
Pneumonia occurred in 11% to 13% of the study population and was the most commonly reported, severe 
(Grade 3 or 4) infection (7% to 10%) and also the most commonly reported serious infection (7% to 9%). 
The occurrence of pneumonia was balanced between treatment groups, and did not result in a high rate of 
treatment discontinuations (DRd/DVd: 3 subjects in each group, Rd/Vd: 2/1 subjects) or deaths (DRd/DVd: 
2/1 subjects, Rd/Vd: 2 subjects in each group). The rate of opportunistic infections across all groups was 
generally low. 
Dose modifications of daratumumab typically were dose delays or skipped doses prior to the start of an 
infusion. In the DVd group, 36% of subjects had modifications to daratumumab dosing, the 2 most common 
TEAEs  were  thrombocytopenia  (12%)  and  pneumonia  (5%).  In  the  DRd  group  37%  of  subjects  had 
modifications to daratumumab dosing, the 2 most common TEAEs were neutropenia (10%) and pneumonia 
(4%).  
The tolerability of the DRd combination is supported by the low frequency of study treatment discontinuation 
due to TEAEs (DRd 7%, Rd 8%) and the DVd combination, DVd 7% and Vd 9% respectively).  
Both bortezomib and lenalidomide increase the risk of herpes zoster reactivation, but despite prophylactic 
antiviral therapy was administered; herpes zoster was reported in some of the subjects. However not all 
subjects received prophylactic antiviral treatment. The incidence of herpes zoster reactivation was low and 
balanced  between  treatment  groups.  Although  small  numbers,  herpes  zoster  reactivation  was  lower  in 
subjects who received prophylactic treatment than in those who did not. This is reflected in the SmPC. 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 83/105 
 
  
  
 
 
Peripheral neuropathy which is a well-known adverse effect due to bortezomib and also might be due to 
underlying disease was reported in 46% of the DVd group and 38% in the Vd group.  The MAH analysed 
possible risk factors of peripheral neuropathy, in conclusion, the higher rate of peripheral neuropathy was 
due to longer exposure to bortezomib, but factors such as prior history of peripheral neuropathy, diabetes 
mellitus,  prior  exposure  to  thalidomide  and  older  age  might  potentially  contribute  to  the  symptoms, 
although no statistical significant difference was noted. 
Overall the frequency of severe AEs is considered acceptable. Of note, 21/138 patients died, and it may be 
questioned whether this number is higher than expected. It is endorsed, that the patient population was 
heavily pretreated with refractory/relapsed disease. The MAH has reviewed the post marketing data for the 
cause of death as reported in spontaneous reports, 18 deaths among 2711 patients/months exposure were 
reported. A detailed analysis of fatal TEAEs showed that cause of death could be attributed to end stage 
disease or events associated with the underlying malignant disease, eg. infection and multi-organ failure. 
Thus the numbers of death are not higher than what could be expected in this clinical setting. 
Blood samples from the study participants were analysed for anti-daratumumab antibodies. In 2 out of 298 
evaluable patients anti-daratumumab antibodies were detected, however the titer for the positive samples 
(1:20) demonstrated detection only at the minimum required dilution of the method, and thus was near the 
lower limit of the antidaratumumab antibody detection method. In order to improve the immunogenicity 
method’s  ability  to  detect  anti-daratumumab  antibodies  in  the  presence  of  high  trough  levels  of 
daratumumab, a study has been requested for which study results are expected by the end of 2018 (please 
see RMP section 2.6). 
No drug-drug interaction studies were performed. However, as daratumumab is an IgG, renal excretion and 
hepatic enzyme-mediated metabolism is considered unlikely.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Based  on  data  from  664  subjects  included  in  the  pivotal  and  supportive  studies,  the  safety  profile  is 
consistent  with  the  known  toxicities  of  the  respective  background  therapies  and  daratumumab 
monotherapy.  Daratumumab  may  increase  the  rate  of  cytopenias  known  to  be  associated  with  each 
background  therapy  (neutropenia  with  lenalidomide  or  pomalidomide  and  thrombocytopenia  with 
bortezomib). However they appeared to be manageable by supportive care and dose modifications, and did 
not  result  in  an  increase  in  discontinuation  of  study  treatments  or  deaths.  Both  neutropenia  and 
thrombocytopenia have been classified as important identified risks in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Thus, 
overall 
daratumumab 
in 
combination  with 
standard 
background 
therapies 
as 
lenalidomide+dexamethasone and bortezomib+dexamethasone is well tolerated, with a manageable side 
effect profile.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan:

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. Particularly, a new warning with regard to neutropenia/thrombocytopenia induced by background 
therapy has been added to the product information. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, Annex II is updated to reflect on the fulfilment of the specific obligations following submission 
of the final results of studies MMY3003 and MMY3004. As a consequence, the conditional marketing 
authorisation is switched to a full marketing authorisation (see section 3.7 and section 4).  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a new user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
• 
The package leaflet included in this current application has the same format as the one previously 
tested. 
• 
With the proposed indication extension, minimal changes have been introduced to the package 
leaflet and the proposed changes reflect language and a format that is consistent with that in the currently 
approved leaflet. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignant disorder of the plasma cells, characterised by uncontrolled and 
progressive proliferation of a plasma cell clone. The median age of patients at diagnosis is 65 years. The 
abnormal plasma cell proliferation accumulates in the bone marrow, displacing the normal hematopoietic 
tissue. The plasma cells produce a monoclonal antibody, paraprotein (M-protein and free-light chain), which 
is an immunoglobulin (Ig) or a fragment of one that has lost its function (Kyle 2009, Palumbo 2011). The 
normal immunoglobulins (Ig) are compromised leading to increased susceptibility to infections. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment options for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma include combination 
chemotherapy, proteasome inhibitors (PIs; eg, bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib), immunomodulatory 
agents (IMiDs; eg, thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide), histone deacetylase inhibitors (eg, 
panobinostat); monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (eg, daratumumab and elotuzumab), high-dose 
chemotherapy, and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The clinical package of daratumumab for the treatment of subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma is primarily supported by data from 2 pivotal phase 3 randomised open-label studies, MMY3003 
and MMY3004, where daratumumab is added to one of two established standard of care background 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 88/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
regimens. In the MMY3003 study, the efficacy of daratumumab when combined with lenalidomide and 
low-dose dexamethasone (DRd) was compared with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd), and in 
the MMY3004 study, the efficacy of daratumumab when combined with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
(DVd) was compared with bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd). Both studies were performed in patients 
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, who had received at least one prior therapy.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study MMY3003 (daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide (DRd) compared with Rd): 
Treatment with DRd resulted in a 63% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with 
Rd alone (HR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.52; p<0.0001). The median PFS was not reached for the DRd group 
and was 18.4 months for the Rd group. The PFS results were consistent among all pre-planned sensitivity 
analyses and across different clinically relevant pre-specified subgroups, such as number and type of prior 
lines of therapy, staging, cytogenetic risk group, and whether refractory to last treatment. 
The ORR was higher in the DRd group, 93% compared with 76% in the Rd group (p<0.0001).  
The rate of VGPR or better was 76% in the DRd group compared with 44% in the Rd group (p<0.0001). 
Subjects in the DRd group had higher rate of CR or better (43%) compared with the Rd group (19%) 
(p<0.0001). 
More subjects were MRD negative at the 10-4 threshold who received DRd, 29% compared with those who 
received Rd, 8% (chi-squared odds ratio 4.85; 95% CI: 2.93, 8.03; p<0.0001). 
The 18-month OS rate was 86.1% (95% CI: 79.9, 90.5) in the DRd group and 75.6% (95% CI: 59.8, 85.9) 
in the Rd group. 
Study MMY3004 (daratumumab in combination with bortezomib (DVd) compared with Vd): 
Treatment with DVd resulted in a 61% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with 
Vd (HR=0.39; 95% CI: 0.28, 053; p<0.0001). The median PFS was not reached for the DVd group and was 
7.2 months for the Vd group. The PFS result were consistent among all pre-planned sensitivity analyses and 
across different clinically relevant prespecified subgroups, such as number and type of prior lines of therapy, 
staging, cytogenetic risk group, and whether refractory to last treatment. 
The ORR was higher in the DVd group, 83% compared with 63% in the Vd group (p<0.0001). 
The rate of VGPR or better was 59% in the DVd group, compared with 29% in the Vd group (p<0.0001). 
Subjects in the DVD group had a higher rate of CR or better, 19% vs. 9% in the Vd group (p=0.0012).  
More subjects were MRD negative at the 10-4 threshold in the DVd group, 14% compared with 3% in the Vd 
group (chi-square odds ratio =5.37; 95% CI: 2.33, 12.37; p<0.0001). 
The 12-month survival rates were 82% for both treatment groups. 
Generally the subgroup analyses and the secondary endpoints support the robustness and clinical 
meaningfulness of adding daratumumab to standard background therapies as lenalidomide + 
dexamethasone and bortezomib + dexamethasone. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There are no uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects. 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 89/105 
 
  
  
 
 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The  safety  profile  of  daratumumab 
in  combination  with 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone  and 
bortezomib/dexamethasone was generally consistent with the known safety profiles of daratumumab and 
the respective background therapies.  
Treatment with daratumumab induced a relatively high incidence of IRRs, 47% subjects experienced an IRR, 
the majority (approximately 95%) occurred during the first infusion and the incidence is reduced during 
subsequent cycles of treatment. The majority of IRRs are mild (Grade 1 or 2) and no Grade 4 or 5 IRRs 
occurred. Both acute and delayed onset infusion-related reactions have been observed and for this reason 
both pre-and post-infusion treatment with steroids is recommended. 
Overall, other frequently occurring AEs were: fatigue, nausea,  anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
upper respiratory tract infection and diarrhoea.   
While  the  incidence  of  Grade  3  or  4  TEAEs  and  serious  TEAEs  was  slightly  higher  in  the  daratumumab 
combination groups, TEAEs were managed by supportive care and dose modifications, and did not result in 
an increase in discontinuation of study treatments or deaths. Discontinuation of treatment due to TEAEs was 
low and balanced between treatment groups, the most common cause being infections. 
The incidence of death within 30 days of the last dose of study drug was relatively low and balanced between 
treatment groups, the most common reason was due to infections (1% to 2%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Daratumumab may increase the rate of cytopenias known to be associated with each background therapy 
(neutropenia with lenalidomide or pomalidomide and thrombocytopenia with bortezomib). However they 
appeared to be manageable by supportive care and dose modifications, and did not result in an increase in 
discontinuation of study treatments or deaths. Both neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have been classified 
as important identified risks in the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The two pivotal studies demonstrated a positive effect on PFS. This endpoint and the effects observed are 
considered clinically significant, when compared to background therapies alone. The effects are convincing 
and supported by secondary endpoints including response rate and MRD negativity. Although mature OS 
data are still not available it is reasonable to exclude a possible detrimental effect. Overall, the effect 
observed in PFS is sufficient to establish the efficacy of the combination of daratumumab, lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone, and of the combination daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone in the proposed 
indications. 
The safety profile is as expected in the context of the patient population and for standard background 
anti-myeloma therapies and manageable.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy of daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or bortezomib and 
dexamethasone in the target population is considered clinically relevant and, in the view of the manageable, 
and consistent with the known safety profile of daratumumab and the two background therapies, the 
benefits are considered to outweigh the combined risks.  
Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The initial marketing authorisation application for Darzalex was based on an ORR of 29% obtained with 
daratumumab in pivotal study MMY2002. This effect was considered significant and clinically relevant in 
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a proteasome 
inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017

therapy despite the absence of confirmatory controlled data. Patients were heavily pretreated, and 79.8% 
and 69.4% had received more than 3 lines of prior therapy in the MMY2002 and GEN501 studies 
respectively, further 95% and 95.8% respectively were refractory to both PI’s and IMiD’s. Together with an 
acceptable safety-profile in patients in the proposed indication, the benefit-risk balance was considered 
positive. However, there was a need to provide controlled data in a larger target population within the same 
condition in order to further define the benefit-risk of daratumumab in the initial indication as follows: 
 
In order to address the uncertainties related to the single arm design of the pivotal study supporting 
the approval of Darzalex, the MAH should submit the results of study MMY3003, a phase III 
randomised study investigating lenalidomide and dexamethasone with or without daratumumab in 
patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. 
 
In order to address the uncertainties related to the single arm design of the pivotal study supporting 
the approval of Darzalex, the MAH should submit the results of study MMY3004, a phase III 
randomised study investigating bortezomib and dexamethasone with or without daratumumab in 
patients with previously treated multiple myeloma. 
With the current application, given the convincing effect and manageable safety profile, comprehensive 
clinical data has been provided to confirm efficacy and safety of daratumumab in the initial indication. Even 
if Study MMY 3003 and Study MMY 3004 were conducted in combination, the results are relevant in view of 
the overlapping populations and the design of the study allows assess the effect of daratumumab in the 
studied combinations.  
In conclusion, the controlled data confirm the efficacy and safety of daratumumab monotherapy, and that 
the risk-benefit balance of daratumumab in the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent 
and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy is favourable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and 
dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one 
prior therapy is positive. 
In conclusion, the controlled data of studies MMY3003 and MMY3004 confirm the efficacy and safety of 
daratumumab monotherapy, and that the risk-benefit balance of daratumumab in the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a proteasome 
inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last 
therapy is favourable. The CHMP agreed on the fulfilment of the specific obligations.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Darzalex is not similar to Thalidomide Celgene, Revlimid, 
Imnovid, Farydak, Kyprolis and Ninlaro within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning

order to update the information on the target patient population, posology, warnings, interactions, efficacy 
and pharmacokinetics. A new warning is introduced in section 4.4 regarding neutropenia/thrombocytopenia 
induced by background therapy.  
Furthermore, the CHMP is of the opinion that all specific obligations have been fulfilled following submission 
of the final results of studies MMY3003 and MMY3004 and in light of the data generated and the evidence of 
compliance with the specific obligations, the CHMP recommends the granting of a marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation No 726/2004.  
The Package Leaflet and Risk Management Plan (RMP version 2.1) are updated in accordance. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
As a result of the fulfilment of the specific obligations, they are removed from the Annex II:

The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
This CHMP recommendation is subject to the following conditions, amended to reflect on the deletion of the 
above table from the Annex II.E: 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation 
 
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation.

Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
• 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being 
received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an important 
(pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures  
Prior to the launch of Darzalex (daratumumab) in each Member State (MS) the Marketing Authorisation 
Holder (MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational materials, aiming at increasing 
awareness about the Important Identified Risk of “Interference for blood typing (minor antigen) (Positive 
Indirect Coombs’ test)” and providing guidance on how to manage it. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where Darzalex (daratumumab) is marketed, all HCPs and patients 
who are expected to prescribe, dispense and receive this product have access to/are provided with the 
below. 
The HCPs and Blood Banks educational materials, shall contain the following key elements: 
 
The guide for HCPs and Blood Banks, to advice about the risk of interference for blood typing and how to 
minimise it; 
 
The Patient Alert Card. 
The Guide for HCP and Blood Banks shall contain the following key elements: 
  All patients should be typed and screened prior to start treatment with daratumumab; alternatively, 
phenotyping may also be considered; 
  Daratumumab-mediated positive indirect Coombs test (interfering with cross-matching of blood) may 
persist for up to 6 months after the last product’s infusion, therefore, the HCP should advise the patient 
to carry the Patient Alert Card until 6 months after the treatment has ended; 
  Daratumumab bound to Red Blood Cells (RBCs) may mask the detection of antibodies to minor antigens 
in the patient’s serum; 
 
 
 
 
The determination of a patient’s ABO and Rh blood type are not impacted; 
The interference mitigation methods include treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) to disrupt 
daratumumab binding or other locally validated methods. Since the Kell Blood group system is also 
sensitive to DTT treatment, Kell-negative units should be supplied after ruling out or identifying 
alloantibodies using DTT-treated RBCs. Alternatively, genotyping may also be considered; 
In case of urgent need for transfusion, non-cross matched ABO/RhD compatible RBC units can be 
administered as per local bank practices; 
In the event of a planned transfusion, the HCPs should notify blood transfusion centres about the 
interference with indirect antiglobulin tests; 
  Reference to the need to consult the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC); 
  Reference to the need of giving the Patient Alert Card to the patients and to advise them to consult the 
Package Leaflet (PL). 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 94/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
The Patient Alert Card, shall contain the following key elements: 
  A warning message for HCPs treating the patient at any time, including in conditions of emergency, that 
the patient is using Darzalex (daratumumab), and that this treatment is associated with the Important 
Identified Risk of Interference for blood typing (minor antigen) (Positive Indirect Coombs’ test), which 
might persist for up to 6 months after the last product’s infusion, and a clear reference that the patient 
should continue to carry this card until 6 months after the treatment has ended; 
  Contact details of the Darzalex (daratumumab) prescriber; 
  Reference to the need to consult the Package Leaflet (PL). 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC.  
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers by consensus that the new therapeutic 
indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2). 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 8 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
Scope 
Extension of Indication for Darzalex in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib 
and dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least 
one prior therapy. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated in 
order to update the information on the target patient population, posology, warnings, interactions, efficacy 
and pharmacokinetics. A new warning is introduced in section 4.4 regarding neutropenia/thrombocytopenia 
induced by background therapy.  
Furthermore, the CHMP is of the opinion that all specific obligations have been fulfilled following submission 
of the final results of studies MMY3003 and MMY3004 and in light of the data generated and the evidence of 
compliance with the specific obligations, the CHMP recommends the granting of a marketing authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation No 726/2004. Annex II is updated to remove the fulfilled specific 
obligations. 
The Package Leaflet and Risk Management Plan (RMP version 2.1) are updated in accordance. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet.

1.  Introduction 
In accordance with the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) Janssen-Cilag International N.V. has applied for an additional one year marketing protection 
period in the framework of Darzalex procedure (EMEA/H/C/004077/II/0002). 
The  request  was  based  on  the  MAH's  position  that  Darzalex  represents  a  significant  clinical  benefit  in 
combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone for the treatment of 
adult  patients  with  multiple  myeloma  who  have  received  at  least  one  prior  therapy  in  comparison  with 
existing therapies. 
2.  Justification of significant clinical benefit as presented by 
the MAH 
2.1.  Demonstration of new therapeutic indication 
A conditional marketing authorization was approved by the European Commission on 20 May 2016 for the 
treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a 
proteasome  inhibitor  (PI)  and  an  immunomodulatory  agent  (IMiD)  and  who  have  demonstrated  disease 
progression on the last therapy. 
The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) is now seeking to expand the indication for daratumumab based 
primarily on data from 2 comparator controlled Phase 3 studies: MMY3003 (daratumumab plus lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone) and MMY3004 (daratumumab plus bortezomib and dexamethasone). Based on results 
from  these  trials, the MAH  is  seeking  to  update  the indication to include  the  treatment  of subjects with 
DARZALEX in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. 
In accordance with the reference to Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the applicant wishes to 
claim an additional one year of marketing protection as the new therapeutic  indication for daratumumab 
(DARZALEX  is  indicated  in  combination  with  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone,  or  bortezomib  and 
dexamethasone, for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one 
prior therapy) represents a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.  
2.2.  Details of existing therapies 
Please see below 
2.3.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy 
The  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma  has  emerged  covering  a  number  of  treatment  options,  such  as   
proteasome  inhibitors  (PIs):  bortezomib,  carfilzomib,  ixazomib;  immunomodulatory  drugs  (IMiDs): 
thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide; histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors such as panobinostat, 
as well as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as Elotuzumab. 
For  the  treatment  of  relapsed  or  refractory  multiple  myeloma,  strategies  involving  PIs  or  IMiDs  used  in 
combination with a steroid have become the standard of care treatment because they have demonstrated 
good clinical efficacy along with acceptable and manageable safety profiles. 
Immunomodulatory Agents  
Two agents in particular (lenalidomide and pomalidomide), have been used to treat patients with relapsed or 
refractory  multiple  myeloma,  especially  patients  who  are  bortezomib-refractory  or 
intolerant. 
Progression-free survival from 2 phase 3 trials of lenalidomide and high dose dexamethasone (RD) versus 
dexamethasone alone (D) demonstrated a PFS of approximately 11 months for RD and 4.7 months for D 
(Weber et al. 2007). Clinical studies of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Rd) compared to RD, 
showed a survival advantage and a significantly reduced toxicity profile compared with the RD treatment 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 98/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
(Rajkumar  et  al.  2010).  Toxicity  associated  with  the  Rd  combination  are  myelosuppression  and 
thromboembolic events, which are usually manageable (Latif et al. 2012). Rd therefore became one of the 
standard options for patients with multiple myeloma.  
Pomalidomide as a single agent has a low anti-myeloma activity, but in combination with dexamethasone 
(Pd) to patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (≥2 prior therapies, including lenalidomide 
andbortezomib), the clinical outcome was improved. The PFS was prolonged, 4.2 months vs. 2.7 months for 
pomalidomide alone and the response  rates were 33% vs 18%, respectively (Richardson 2014).  After a 
median  follow-up  of  10.0  months  in  a  separate  Phase  3  study  which  compared  Pd  to  high-dose 
dexamethasone, the median PFS for Pd was 4·0 months versus 1·9 months for highdose dexamethasone 
(HR=0·48 [95% CI 0·39–0·60]; p<0·0001). (SanMiguel 2013).  
Similar to lenalidomide, the manageable toxicity risks of pomalidomide include thromboembolic events and 
infection,  anemia,  and 
myelosuppression  and  also  neutropenia  (including 
thrombocytopenia.  
febrile  neutropenia) 
Proteasome Inhibitors 
Three agents in particular (bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib), have been used to treat patients with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The bortezomib-dexamethasone (Vd) combination is widely used 
and has yielded ORRs of 62% to 70% (Dimopoulous 2015, Kropff 2005) compared with 38% to 50% when 
bortezomib was administered as a single-agent (Jagannath 2004, Orlowski 2007). In a Phase 3 study of Vd 
versus dexamethasone, the PFS was 6.2 months and 3.5 months respectively.  
Retreatment of bortezomib in subjects previously exposed to bortezomib who now have relapsed disease 
demonstrated  a  40%  ORR  (Petrucci  2013).  Toxicities  associated  with  bortezomib  use  include  peripheral 
neuropathy, hematologic toxicities, diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, and zoster reactivation (Merin 2014). 
Carfilzomib  administered  in  combination  with  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone  (KRd)  resulted  in 
significantly  improved  PFS  (26.3  months)  compared  with  Rd  alone  (17.6  months)  (HR=0.69)  (Stewart 
2015). The ORR was 87% vs 67% in the KRd vs Rd groups, respectively, with 38% and 9% of patients 
having a CR or better, and 14% and 4% of patients, respectively, having a stringent CR (sCR). Separately, 
carfilzomib administered in combination with dexamethasone (Kd) resulted in significantly improved PFS 
(18.7 months) compared with bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd, 9.4 months) (HR=0.53) (Dimopoulos 
2016).  The  percentage  of  patients  having  a  CR  or  better  was  11%  and  4%  in  the  Kd  vs  Vd  groups, 
respectively, with 2% of patients in each group having a stringent CR. Hematologic toxicities, pneumonia, 
hyponatremia, fatigue, hypophosphatemia,  infusion  reactions, chest pain, and heart failure are  common 
toxicities associated with carfilzomib (Merin 2014). Carfilzomib product labels carry a warning due to risk of 
cardiac  arrest,  congestive  heart  failure,  myocardial  ischemia,  sudden  cardiac  death  and  pulmonary 
hypertension (Kyprolis Product Information).  
Ixazomib is an oral PI, when administered in combination with Rd, PFS was 20.6 months compared to 14.7 
months when compared with Rd alone [HR=0.74]); ORR was 78% vs 72%, respectively, with 48% and 39% 
of  patients,  respectively  achieving  VGPR  or  better  (Moreau  2016).  Hematologic  toxicities,  fatigue,  rash, 
decreased appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting are common toxicities associated with ixazomib (Merin 2014).  
Therapies With Other Mechanisms of Action  
Other agents such as Panobinostat, an oral pan-decetylase inhibitor, is a more recent anti-myeloma agent 
for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Although a positive effect on PFS and OR was 
demonstrated when combined with Vd, panobinostat is associated with severe and dose limiting toxicities. 
The drug seems more effective in  more heavily pretreated population i.e., patients who have received a 
median of 2 prior therapies, including treatment with both bortezomib and an IMiD.  
Elotuzumab,  a  monoclonal  antibody,  is  a  recent  addition  to  the  treatment  of  multiple  myeloma  and  is 
indicated in combination with Rd for the treatment of patients who have received 1 to 3 prior therapies. A 
number  of  other  classes  are  also  available  which  include  HDAC  inhibitors,  alkylating  agents  as  well  as 
anthracyclines.  However,  in  addition  to  these  existing  therapies,  there  is  still  a  need  for  more  effective 
treatments  with  different  mechanisms  of  action  that  provide  alternative  treatment  options  for  these 
patients.

Daratumumab is a first-in-class, human IgG1 mAb with a MoA that is novel and completely distinct from 
other anti-myeloma treatment available.  
Following scientific advice from the CHMP (Procedure: EMEA/H/SA/2456/1/FU/1/2014/PA/II) the applicant 
has  conducted  two  comparative  randomized  Phase  3  studies  of  daratumumab  in  combination  with 
established  standard  of  care  background  regimens;  either  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone  (Study 
MMY3003)  or  bortezomib  and  dexamethasone  (Study  MMY3004).  The  objective  of  both  studies  was  to 
compare the efficacy of daratumumab when combined with these background regimens and to assess if the 
daratumumab based combination would improve clinical outcomes in subjects with multiple myeloma who 
have previously been treated with at least one prior therapy when compared to the background regimen 
alone.  
The addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) (MMY3003) or to bortezomib and 
dexamethasone (Vd)(MMY3004), results in  an improvement in  PFS,  with a 63% reduction in the risk of 
disease progression or death when daratumumab is added to Rd (DRd) compared to Rd in Study MMY3003 
(HR=0.37; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.52; p<0.0001). In the MMY3004 study a 61% reduction in the risk of disease 
progression  or  death  was  reported,  when  daratumumab  was  added  to  Vd  (DVd)  compared  with  Rd 
(HR=0.39; 95% CI: 0.28, 053; p<0.0001).  In both studies, the benefit was robust and consistent among all 
subgroups based on gender, race, age, baseline hepatic and renal impairment and geographical regions.  
The  positive  effect  was  supported  by 
including 
improvements 
time-to-progression (TTP), overall response rate (ORR), depth of response as reflected by the rates of a very 
good  partial  response  (VGPR)  or  better  and  complete  response  (CR)  or  better,  rate  of  minimal  residual 
disease (MRD) negativity, and duration of response (DOR).  
In Study MMY3003, the ORR is significantly higher in subject receiving DRd, as compared to Rd alone (DRd: 
93% vs Rd: 76%; p<0.0001). The responses are robust, with higher VGPR or better rates (DRd: 76% vs Rd: 
44%) and rate of CR or better (DRd: 43% vs Rd: 19%). In addition, the MRD negativity rate is significantly 
higher (DRd: 29% vs Rd: 8%).  
In Study MMY3004, the ORR is significantly higher in subjects receiving DVd, as compared to Vd alone (DVd: 
83% vs Vd: 63%; p<0.0001). The responses are robust with higher VGPR or better rates (DVd: 59% vs Vd: 
29%) and rate of CR or better (DVd: 19% vs Vd: 9%). In addition, the MRD negativity rate is significantly 
higher (DVd: 14% vs Vd: 3%). 
in  key  secondary  endpoints 
In addition the applicant also conducted two Phase 1/2 studies where daratumumab was administered in 
combination  with  either  pomalidomide  and  dexamethasone  (Pd)  (Study  MMY1001),  or  lenalidomide  and 
dexamethasone (Ld) (study GEN503). The primary objective of these studies was to evaluate safety and 
tolerability, and for the MMY1001 study, also to evaluate the overall response rate.  
Adding daratumumab to another immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (Pd) 
in heavily pretreated subjects in Study MMY1001, results in ORR (59%; 95% CI: 49; 69) CR or better rate 
(14%), and a median DOR of 13.6 months. Although these data are interesting, they should be interpreted 
with caution since no comparator was identified.  
2.4.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety 
Safety  data  from  a  total  of  1182  subjects  are  included  in  the  safety  population:  664  subjects  received 
daratumumab  in  combination  with  standard  background  therapy  and  518  subjects  received  background 
therapies alone.  
With the exception of infusion related reactions (IRRs), the safety profiles of daratumumab in combination 
with Rd, Vd or Pd were similar to those of the background regimens.  
Similar to the daratumumab single agent data, IRRs were experienced by approximately half of subjects 
receiving daratumumab-based regimens (DRd, DVd, DPd). The majority (94%) of IRRs were Grade 1 or 2, 
with 95% occurring during the first infusion. No Grade 4 or 5 IRRs occurred, and only 5 subjects (0.8%) 
discontinued treatment due to IRRs. 
The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs and serious TEAEs was higher in the daratumumab combination groups, 
the TEAEs could be managed by supportive care and dose modifications, and did not result in an increase in 
discontinuation of study treatment or deaths.

Daratumumab may increase cytopenias induced by background therapies, with thrombocytopenia being the 
most common for subjects receiving bortezomib based regimens and neutropenia the most common for 
subjects receiving lenalidomide- or pomalidomide-based regimens. 
Neutropenia, which is a well known effect of lenalidomide and pomalidomide, was reported more frequently 
in the daratumumab combination groups than in background therapy alone (DRd: 62%; Rd: 43%; DPd: 
79%). Most frequently, neutropenia occurred in the initial cycles, it was managed by dose modifications and 
growth factor use and rarely led to treatment discontinuation (<1%). The incidence of febrile neutropenia 
was low (≤7%).  
Thrombocytopenia,  a  known  effect  of  bortezomib,  was  reported  by  more  subjects  in  the  DVd  group 
compared to the Vd group (DVd: 59%; Vd: 44%); however bleeding events were low and the majority were 
minor (Grade 1 or 2).  
Anemia, all grades and Grade 3 or 4, was similar among all treatment groups in the randomized studies (all 
grades DRd: 31% vs Rd: 35% and DVd: 26% vs Vd: 31%;Grade 3 or 4: DRd: 12% vs Rd: 20% and DVd: 
14% vs Vd: 16%). 
Although  the  overall  incidence  of  infections  were  reported  by  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the 
daratumumab  containing  groups  compared  to  the  respective  background  therapy,  the  majority  of  all 
infections were mild (Grade 1 or 2) and did not require hospitalization. 
The  incidence  of  Grade  3  or  4  infection  was  similar  between  the  daratumumab  combinations  and  the 
background therapies (DRd: 27%; Rd: 23%; DVd: 21%; Vd: 9%; DPd: 27%), with the most common being 
pneumonia. 
Discontinuations  from  treatment  (2%  to  5%)  and  deaths  (0.8%  to  2%)  due  to  infection  were  low  and 
balanced between groups in the randomized studies. 
Second primary malignancies (SPM) were reported at a low frequency in the DRd and DVd groups (<4%); no 
SPMs were reported in the DPd cohort. 
Discontinuation of treatment due to TEAEs was low across all treatment groups (DRd: 7%; Rd: 8%, DVd: 
7%; Vd: 9%, DPd: 13%), with the most common reason for discontinuation being infections (2% to 5%). 
Infections were also the most common treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to death (1% to 
2%), but TEAEs with an outcome of death were low across all treatment groups (DRd: 4%; Rd: 5%, DVd: 
5%;  Vd:  6%,  DPd:  7%).  Subgroup  analyses  showed  generally  comparable  safety  profiles  in  various 
subgroups based on age, gender, race, baseline renal function, baseline hepatic function, and geographic 
region. 
2.5.  Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care 
Patient-reported outcome concerning functional status and well-being were assessed using 2 PRO measures, 
the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and the EQ-5D-5L. Compliance was comparable between treatment groups and 
baseline scores for daratumumab added to the 2 background therapies (DRd and DVd) compared to 
backbone therapies alone. The PRO results indicated no statistically significant difference between the 
combination of daratumumab to background therapies (DRd or DVd) and the corresponding background 
therapies in change from baseline or median time to improvement or worsening in the Global Health 
Status/QOL subscale of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 or the EQ-5D-5L Utility score or EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale 
(VAS). When median time to worsening or improvement in the Utility Score or VAS was analysed, no 
statistically significant differences were observed between DRd and Rd or DVd and Vd. 
3.  Assessment of the MAH's justification of significant clinical 
benefit 
3.1.  Demonstration of new therapeutic indication 
CHMP’s position: 
Daratumumab was previously approved in May 2016 as monotherapy to treat subjects with advanced stage 
multiple  myeloma.  The  studies  (GEN501  and  MMY2002)  supporting  the  approved  indication  included 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 101/105 
 
  
  
 
 
end-stage refractory subjects who had received 4-5 (median) prior treatments with 69% and 80% of the 
subjects having > 3 prior therapies in the GEN501 and MMY2002 studies respectively.  
The  applicant  is  now  extending  the  indication  to  include  subjects  who  have  less  advanced  disease  and 
received  at  least  1  prior  treatment,  i.e.  as  second  line  treatment  in  multiple  myeloma.  The  proposed 
additional  indication  for  daratumumab  in  this  application  is  for  the  treatment  in  combination  with 
lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone,  or  bortezomib  and  dexamethasone,  of  adult  patients  with  multiple 
myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy.  
The  CHMP  acknowledges  this  is  a  new  indication  of  daratumumab  earlier  in  the  treatment  pathway  of 
multiple myeloma.  
It is also acknowledged that the two randomized studies, MMY3003 and MMY3004, daratumumab added to 
2  standard  of  care  background  regimens,  either  lenalidomide  and  dexamethasone  or  bortezomib  and 
dexamethasone, show a significant efficacy improvement with an acceptable and manageable safety profile, 
and that this represents a new indication.  
3.2.  Details of existing therapies 
CHMP’s position: 
The  applicant  has  satisfactorily  reviewed  and  detailed  the  characteristics  and  limitations  of  existing 
therapies. 
3.3.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved efficacy 
CHMP’s position:  
Daratumumab is a novel monoclonal antibody targeting CD38 on multiple myeloma cells inducing tumour 
cell death through multiple mechanisms of action. The applicant has conducted 2 pivotal comparative phase 
3  studies  of  daratumumab  in  combination  with  1  of  2  well  established  standard  of  care  background 
regimens; either lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Study MMY3003) or bortezomib and dexamethasone 
(Study  MMY3004).  The  objective  of  both  studies  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  daratumumab  when 
combined with these background regimens and to assess if, through this addition, the daratumumab based 
combination would improve clinical outcomes in subjects with multiple myeloma who have previously been 
treated with at least one prior therapy when compared to the background regimen alone.  
The clinical trials were well-controlled and had clinically meaningful endpoints. Daratumumab added to Rd 
(DRd) (study MMY3003) or daratumumab added to Vd (DVd) (Study MMY3004) results in a 63% and 61% 
reduction in the risk of disease progression or death respectively, when compared with Rd (HR=0.37; 95% 
CI:  0.27,  0.52;  p<0.0001)  or  Vd  (HR=0.39;  95%  CI:  0.28,  053;  p<0.0001)  in  subjects  with  multiple 
myeloma who received at least 1 prior therapy. In both studies, the PFS results were consistent among all 
preplanned  sensitivity  analyses  and  across  different  clinically  relevant  prespecified  subgroups,  such  as 
number and type of prior lines of therapy, staging, cytogenetic risk group, and whether refractory to last 
treatment. Further the benefit was robust and consistent among all subgroups based on gender, race, age, 
baseline hepatic and renal impairment and geographical regions.  
The  superiority  in  efficacy  is  supported  by  improvements  in  key  secondary  endpoints  including 
time-to-progression.  
In the Study MMY3003, the ORR is significantly higher in subject receiving DRd, as compared to Rd alone 
(DRd: 93% vs Rd: 76%; p<0.0001). The responses are deep, with higher VGPR or better rates (DRd: 76% 
vs Rd: 44%) and in the rate of CR or better (DRd: 43% vs Rd: 19%). In addition, the MRD negativity rate is 
significantly higher (DRd: 29% vs Rd: 8%). Other phase 3 trials using lenalidomide+dexamethasone (Rd) as 
background therapy have previously been published. Carfilzomib + Rd vs. Rd alone, elotuzumb + Rd vs. Rd 
alone and ixazomib + Rd vs. Rd alone (Stewart 2015, Lonial l2015 and Moreau 2016). Although comparison 
and interpretation with these data should be done with caution, HR for PFS was in the range of 0.69 to 0.74, 
ie. they showed a reduction in risk of progression or death of 26% to 31%, compared to a 63% reduction in 
the present MMY3003 study. The ORR results were overall consistent with the PFS results. 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 102/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
In Study MMY3004, the ORR is significantly higher in subjects receiving DVd, as compared to Vd alone (DVd: 
83% vs Vd: 63%; p<0.0001). The responses are deep, with higher VGPR or better rates (DVd: 59% vs Vd: 
29%) and a rate of CR or better (DVd: 19% vs Vd: 9%). In addition, the MRD negativity rate is significantly 
higher  (DVd:  14%  vs  Vd:  3%).  Similarly  phase  3  bortezomib/dexamethasone-controlled  studies  with 
panobinostat+Vd and carfilzomib + Vd, along with a phase 2 trial with elotuzumab+Vd have been published 
(San-Miguel 2014, Dimopoulus 2016 and Jakubowiak 2016). HR for PFS in these studies ranged from 0.53 
to 0.72, compared with 0.39 in the daratumumab study, i.e. a reduction in risk of progression or death of 
28% to 47%, compared with 61% in the MMY3004 study with daratumumab. Although comparison between 
studies is difficult, these data indicate a clinical meaningful benefit of daratumumab combinations with RD 
and Vd.

Note: Lenalidomide, thalidomide and pomalidomide are not included in the tables in sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 
and 4. Thalidomide and pomalidomide are not studied with any of the backbones as in the daratumumab 
studies (MMY3003 and MMY3004) and therefore the comparison is not relevant. In addition the approved 
indication for thalidomide is 1st line, and for pomalidomide it is 3rd line. Finally, lenalidomide is part of the 
backbone in study MMY3003. 
Having  considered  the  data  submitted  by  the  MAH,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  claimed  indication  for 
Darzalex brings a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies based on an improved efficacy compared 
to Kyprolis, Empliciti, Ninlaro and Farydak. 
3.4.  Significant clinical benefit based on improved safety 
CHMP’s position: 
Safety data from large comparative studies is included in the application. A total of 664 subjects received 
daratumumab  in  combination  with  standard  background  therapy  and  518  subjects  received  background 
therapies alone.  
The safety profiles of daratumumab in combination with Rd, Vd or Pd were similar to those of the background 
regimens, with the exception of infusion related reactions (IRRs),  which were reported by approximately 
half of subjects receiving daratumumab-based regimens (DRd, DVd, DPd). The majority of IRRs were low 
grade and occurred mainly during the first infusion, they were manageable and the pre-and post medication 
as suggested in the product information is endorsed. 
The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs and serious TEAEs was higher in the daratumumab combination groups, 
but  were  managed  by  supportive  care  and  dose  modifications,  and  did  not  result  in  an  increase  in 
discontinuation of study treatment or deaths. 
Although daratumumab may increase the cytopenias induced by the background therapies, neutropenia was 
managed by dose modifications and growth factor use and rarely led to treatment discontinuation (<1%). 
The incidence of febrile neutropenia was low (≤7%), and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia were low and of 
minor grade. In the clinical setting, cytopenic adverse effects are well known and manageable.  
Although  the  overall  incidence  of  infections  were  reported  by  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the 
daratumumab  containing  groups  compared  to  the  respective  background  therapy,  the  majority  of  all 
Darzalex EMA/193295/2017  
Page 103/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
infections  were  mild  (Grade  1  or  2)  and  did  not  require  hospitalization.  The  incidence  of  Grade  3  or  4 
infection was similar between the daratumumab combinations and the background therapies (DRd: 27%; 
Rd: 23%; DVd: 21%; Vd:9%; DPd: 27%), with the most common being pneumonia. 
Discontinuations  from  treatment  (2%  to  5%)  and  deaths  (0.8%  to  2%)  due  to  infection  were  low  and 
balanced between groups in the randomized studies. 
In  the  previously  published  data  using  the  lenalidomide  or  bortezomib    backbone  treatment,  common 
toxicities associated with carfilzomib combinations include except from hematologic toxicities, pneumonia 
hyponatraemia, fatigue, hypophosphatemia, IRR and especially high grade cardiovascular events. Common 
toxicities with elotuzumab combinations involved mainly infections, incl. opportunistic infections IRR and 
new  primary  malignancies  except  from  the  hematologic  toxicities.  Adverse  events  due  to  the  ixazomib 
combination  include  except  from  hematologic  toxicities,  fatigue,  rash,  decreased  appetite,  diarrhea  and 
vomiting. Toxicity due to panobinostat combination especially includes high rates of gastrointestinal adverse 
events and discontinuation of the treatment. Based on the above, it is not possible to agree on the claim for 
“improved safety” in comparison to existing therapies based on indirect comparisons.

3.5.  Significant clinical benefit based on major contribution to patient care 
CHMP’s position: 
It is considered a benefit to patient care, that a novel drug as daratumumab with a completely distinct 
mechanism of action from any other anti-myeloma treatment has become available to a group of patients 
with a dismal prognosis. Daratumumab offers no new mode of administration, however the treatment 
schedule is adapted to 2 standard of care treatments, this is considered relevant to subjects compliance.  
Besides from the fact that an increase of PFS together with acceptable and manageable safety profile is 
considered a benefit to patient care, the applicant also evaluated the functional status and well-being of the 
subjects. No detrimental effect in median time to improvement or worsening in the global health status was 
demonstrated between the combination of daratumumab and background therapies (DRd or DVd) and the 
corresponding background therapies.  
The applicant has not focused on this issue which is considered acceptable considering the novel mechanism 
of action, the overwhelming benefit on efficacy, and the acceptable and manageable adverse events. 
Combining daratumumab with the 2 standard treatments lenalidomide/dexamethasone or 
bortezomib/dexamethasone doses not add on any concerns related to patient care.

4.  Conclusion 
CHMP’s position: 
Yes 
Yes 
In conclusion, it is agreed, that addition of daratumumab to standard treatment regimens as lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone or bortezomib and dexamethasone results in a consistent clinical benefit as compared 
to standard background therapy alone. The superiority in efficacy is further supported by improvements in 
key  secondary  endpoints.  When  compared  with  historical,  published  data,  the  daratumumab  based 
combinations seems to be superior in relation to PFS and ORR, however due to a historical comparison, the 
results should be interpreted with caution. Concerning the safety profile, the toxicity of daratumumab is 
consistent  with  the  known  toxicities  of  the  individual  agents  and  clinically  manageable.  Compared  to 
historical,  published  data,  the  safety  profile  of  daratumumab  combinations  seems  to  be  superior  to 
carfilzomib  and  panobinostat  containing  regimens,  and  especially  not  to  be  detrimental  to  other 
combination. Based on the above, it is not possible to agree on the claim for “improved safety” in comparison 
to existing therapies based on indirect comparisons. Finally, there is no indication of a detrimental effect on 
quality of life not in this application or compared to historical data.

5.  Recommendation  
The CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH, taking into account the provisions of Article 14(11) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the “Guidance on elements required to support the significant clinical 
benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication in order to benefit from an 
extended (11-year) marketing protection period”, and considers by consensus that the Darzalex in the new 
therapeutic indication brings a significant clinical benefit in comparison to existing therapies.
